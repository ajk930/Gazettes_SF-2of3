Aguinaldo's highest rank. Abroad belt
of yellow satin and silver, wide cuffs
of blue satin, spangled with silver, and
four decorations in the form v of silver
leaves,, which were worn . upon-.the
breast, are also parts of this glittering
insignia. Here are the great silver star
and hatband that decorated the som
brero and complete the' paraphernalia
which rendered Aguinaldo a gorgeous
figure when worn over his white suit at
dres* parade â for he never wore this
regalia over â¢ a khaki uniform, ,
Mr. Cooper was offered large auras
from officers anxious to Â¦ purchase this
regalia as a remembrance of Aguinaldo,
but*. declined, considering it the 'more
valuable from the -fact that only one
other such suit of regalia owned by Ag
uinaldo is known. According to a.cur T
rent army rumor that suit was presented
by. the insurgent leader Jto Major Gen
eral E. S. Otis and, is now-in-Wash-
ington.*
,. As a.scout.one of four sent out from
the front of the regiment to locate .the
insurrectos, Private-; Cooper had- 'a
his experience WITHy,; but graphically,
"When we were sent out the colpnel
.warned 'the . corporal who was with us
to watch out for Filipinos in ambush
while going down through the depth*
of , the bamboo jungle. But he was a
new man, eager for the fray and glory.
He followed his own way and led u*
straight into the teeth of three or four
hundred 'Goo-goos,' as we called tha
natives. Then came hot and bloody
work and before I .knew, it my com
rades were killed by. the natives' bolos.
At close quarters my horse was shot
through the breast and as he fell I made
a jump for another horse" from which
one of the boys had just fallen. As I
did so â ping! came another bullet, and
with a wound in my leg. I fell, into; a
jungle well about four feet deep, one
of the many surface wells dug by the
"natives anywhere and everywhere.
"As I fell I fired my pistol, which in
some way I had managed to keep free,
and the last I heard was the clatter of
the regiment behind as they came charg
ing down and put the 'Goo-koos* to
flight. But I was lucky to get nothing
.-.Â¦Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦.,:Â¦Â¦.Â¦Â¦Â¦_
worse than ten days in the hospital"
Piwtee*. But to hot was the pursuit
and so near did it come at one point
to capture that some of the ponies in
Aguinaldo's band were shot and the
leader threw away bundles of clothing
and other stuff in his mad desire to es
cape his pursuers.
It was in one of these critical mo
ments that Corporal Belding, a friend
of Cooper, picked up in the trail amid
the bamboo jungle a small bag 6f mus
lin which contained this regalia, a small
flag of the province of Vigan, and
wrapped in it a curious dagger with a
point of needle-like sharpness.
Bclding took out- the sash first, and,
it being similar to a decoration worn by
a priest, thought it belonged to one of
them, but hid the bag hurriedly for fear
the Fourth Cavalry, which was passing,
might get it. When he showed it to
his friend in the morning Cooper asked
him if he might take it and show it to
some one. Belding thereupon mado
him a present of the bag and its con
tent*.' t-
Cooper showed it to Captain Agnew
of the Eleventh Cavalry, who exclaimed
at once at sight of the red and silver
star: ' "Why, man, you've got a prize
there! That regalia is Aguinaldo's own,
for I have seen him wear it many, times
during dress parade before the out
break. I know that star."
Since then Mr. Cooper has treasured
the regalia jealously, and the pennant

are among his most prized relics of the

?* *T OTWITHSTAXDING the numer
/\ I ous theories published and the
I \I now almost universal practice of
V^ the science of whist as a science
and for amusement, it is a fact
that the majority of so-called good play
ers outside of whist clubs do not know the
alphabet,- as It may be termed, of the
same.
The reason of this T. Matthews, in his
fourth London edition, published almost
a century ago by Inskeep & Bradford,
New York (and the reason is a good one
to-day), says "that in all other arts and
Bciences no man but commences by mak
ing himself master of the first rudiments,
but the whist player in general gits down
to lose perhaps considerable numbers of
points without further preparation than
the having got a few general maxims by
rote, which from want of comprehending
he applies universally, and is consequently
much oftener wrong than right In their
application."
To beginners it Is absolutely necessary
to begin gradually, and before sitting
down to play at all they should make
themselves masters of the leads, at least,
and the reasons for them. When they
feel that they" have acquired some Insight
Into the theory let them begin to reduce
it to practice, with the strongest whist
players they can meet with. Beginning
to play with "weak" players who have
never read anything about the game will
prevent Improvement.
When a student of the game learns the
leads, the follow, management of trumps,
second, third and fourth hand play, the
signal for trumps, the echo, unblocking,
the suit echo, discarding, j forcing, finess
ing, underplaying, leading through â¢ the
strong hand, leading up to weakness,
throwing the lead, counting the hands,
changing suits, the laws of whist, penal
ties and departing from rule he is tn a
lair way to become a good player from
practice.
ten and nineâ are led from two combina
tions only (the ten from one and the nine
from three), the other cards being termed (
"low cards," and from all other comblna- .â ,
Uons they are led as fourth. best cards.
The combinations pf bigh cards are as
fojlows: The ace is led from two combi
nationsâace and any four other cards or
more which do not include both king and
queen.
Ace, queen, knave and any one or more.
The ace marks five in suit or more/or
when led from the second combination
may have only four in suit.
The king Is led from two combinations
and marks a suit of exactly four cards
ace, k^ig and any. two; king, queen and
any ! two. , â¢
The queen 'is led from two combinations
and marks five or more in suit â ace, kiug,
queen und any two or more in which the
knave Is not included; king, queen and '*
any three or more in which the knave is
not included.
The knave is led from two combina
tions and marks five or more In suit.
Ace, king, queen, knave and any. one
or more; king, queen, knave and any two
or more.
The ten is led from one combination
oi:ly and marks five or more in suit.
Queen, knave, ten and any one or more,
including the nine, as a small card.
The nine is led from three combinations Â¦
and shows exactly, four in suit in two
combinationsâ ace, queen, ten, nine; ace,
knave, ten, nine; king, knave, ten, nine
and one or more small. . Â¦
It must be understood that the leads
are for plain suits only. Trumps; are not
led the same originally, unless you hold
three honors with one, 'two or three more
small, with five trumps, headed by, the
ace. the rest smaller than the queen;
: the. lead here would be the fourth best. - .
If, however, you have seven trumps, ace
â¢at the top, lead, out , the ace, as the
chances are in favor o,f bringing down
an honor on the; first round. . Â¦
Never lead a singleton â¢ as an original
lead. If you have a weak suit of trumps
and think to ruff- the suit on the second
round, your opponents, if strong players,
will detect your intention and if they take
the trick will lead out your trumps. Had
you waited until 'some one else. led that T Â» Â¦â¢
suit your poverty in it would hot have
been known on the first round and your ,
chances would be much better of obtain- ."'
Ing the ruff. . Had you led the singleton, â¢
.besides telling your - partner a "whist ".."
falsehood" you might have "killed"-- a'
good card in his hand. Your lead said to "
partner in the conversation of the cards,
"This is my best suit." . ,
The next lesson will take up the lead of
the fourth best - ? r^'-C
Whist, besides being a pastime, tends
to increase social intercourse and is some
thing more. It brings into action facul
ties of observation, judgment and knowl
edge of character. It can be played by
people of advanced age when more active
pursuits are denied them.
If whist were only a mere pastime It
never would occupy the place it now holds
or would never be reckoned among the
sciences by such intelligent men and
women as it now is. "
We will endeavor to take up each part
of the game and explain it In a manner
to make it understood to the beginner, as
based upon the system of leads known as
American leads, for which we are indebt
ed to the literature of the game and some
practice.
Many persons consider that a very good
memory is necessary in order to play whist
well. Poor memory is really lack of ob
servation, You must observe every card
played; otherwise you must not blame
your memory. Do not study your hand
while playing: arrange it in the order of
play, keeping the trumps always in the
same place, and you will never be at a
loss to' know what the trumps are. After
you have arranged your cards in their
order and have taken note of their
strength or weakness, watch each card as
it falls from your opponents' and partner's
hand and draw your'inferences then to be
used later in the same.
Having set rules for leads, etc., is for
the purpose of imparting information to
your partner as to the strength or;weak
ness of your hand to enable both players
to combine forces and thereby play twen
ty-six cards instead of thirteen. The orig
inal leader is the first player' after the
cards have been dealt, and although the
leads apply to all the first' leads it does
not bear the same responsibility. The ad
vantage of the original lead is that you
can develop the game in any direction
you choose. So being the original leader
you are responsible for the play that fol
lows. Â¦ Therefore it behooves you to choose*
a card that will tell your partner the chief
component of your hand. ' ,
All strong whist players open from their
longest and strongest suits. Kxperience
has demonstrated that this is usually
best. The card to lead is the one that will
at once afford the most information. It
follows if partners adopt the same sys
tem they are enabled to combine their
forces and Â¦ really play a partnership
game.
The American lea'ds are now adopted by
the best players all over the world. Stu
dents should make themselves so familiar
with this rule so as to know at a glance
what to lead. Each of the following

FIRST OF A SERIES OF ARTICLES THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO PLAY A GOOD GAME OF WHIST
Â£-p#HERE IS a plague of grasshoppers
I In the West and Southwest, and
I farmers are much alarmed. Start
1 ling reports on the BUbject are com-
JL Ing in from New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming and Nebraska,. but the situation
In Southern Texas Eeems'to'be worse than
anywhere else. One correspondent says
that "the wheat fields are alive with 'hop
pers';" another states that "desolation is
Imminent," and a third, writing from
Xorth Platte, Neb., remarks that this is
the third year of the pest in that region.
The Government is doing what it can to
mitigate the misfortune, and to that end is
adopting- a new and very extraordinary
means for combating the insect swarm*.
Under the direction of Professor L. O.
Howard, chief of the bureau of entomoj
ogy. It Is putting up In bottles disease
germs of a fungous kind, deadly to grass
hoppers, and is 6ending them to parts of
the country where the damage threatens
to be particularly severe.
The fungus is obtained In South Af
rica, where it has been used with great
success recently, vast armies of grass
hoppers being literally wiped out by it.
It is propagated artificially by applying
a bit of it to a sterilized preparation of
gelatin and blood serum, on which the
germs multiply rapidly. .Thus, prepared,
the "cultures" are sent out in glass' tube?
corked with absorbent c6tton~and sealed
with red wax, each one being enclosed
in a pasteboard cylinder. Directions for
use accompany the package.
In Colorado last summer there was an
outbreak of fungus disease among grass
hoppers, and quantities of the dead in
sects were shipped to Washington and
utilized there for making "cultures." A
whitish, threadlike growth on the bodies
of the victims furnished the requisito
germs. These "cultures" have been dis
tributed during the iireeent year in Colo
rado, experimentally, while the disease
from South Africa Is being tried in Texts.
On receiving a bottle of the fungus, the
farmer - is directed by an accompanying
printed slip to put a number of live gra=h
hoppers in a wooden box, together with a
portion of the germ material. They will
quickly become infected, when he niay lib
erate all but half a dozen or so.
Thfcse^wbsn dead, will serve to commu
nicate the disease to other living grass
hoppers placed in the box for that pur
pose. The box should, be covered with
slats to admit air. and (some grass should
be put in also, dampness encouraging .tlitf
growth of the fungus. As fast ag they aro
infected the "hoppers" are set* free in the
fields to distribute the plague among their
fellows.
The grasshopper is one of themestseri
ous problems encountered by the farmer
in the West. Owing to the settlement, of
great areas which formerly were its per
manent breeding grounds, producing reg
ular and enormous crops of the voracious
IK'Jst.s every year, the inject no longer h i
pears fn those devastating swarms and
devour everything green. But even nowa
days not a season passes that the "h-jp
1 rÂ»" do not appear in alarming num
b'ts'in some parts of the country,- de
stroying the crops and bringing great Io3s,
or even ruin, to the helpless agricultu
rist.
In former times the grasshoppers some
times appeared in swarms multitudinous
almost beyond belief. Twenty-six years
ago the Bfg and Little Blue Rivers, tribu
taries of the Missouri, were crossed at
numerous places by vast bodies of the in
sects, which would, proceed to the water*)
edge and begin Jumping in, one upon -an
other, until they actually pontooned the
stream. ; ' '-' :
Two of these hosts chanced to meet, one
moving eastward and the other westward,
on a river bluff in the same locality, and,
both turning their course together, down
ward from a perpendicular cliff thirty feet
high, -they passed over it in a sheet six or
seven inches thick, with a rearing noise
like that of a "cataract of water. It is
stated on reliable authority that grass
hoppers have been seen to twim over the
Dniester Itiver in Europe, for a 3tretch
of one and a quarter miles, in a layer
more than a foot thick.
Nothing ehort of lire will check the
progress of a** array of grasshoppers on
the march. Yfater, unless In wide rivers,
is no#bar to their progress. Before their
advance the unfortunate farmers are well
nigh helpless. The^ plague arrives, and lo!
as if by magic, the crops are swept from
the face of the earth/ -,,'.,:,.'. , .
As for the "hopper^y- they' sow their owji
crop, planting in one season the egg's
which are to be hatched in the next. The
female drills a hole in the ground with
the horny tip of her abdomen, and in this
she 1ay8 about twenty eggs, which are
bound together in a mass with mucus ex
creted by the mother insect. The burrow
is filled up with mucus, which makes It
watertight.
Now the farmer's best chance is to de
stroy the unhatched eggs, and this he
tries to do in various ways, the most ef
fective perhaps being to slice off an inch
of the top soil, dry it and pass it through
sieves to separate the egg masses, which
are buried in deep pita. In the wheat
growing regions burning machines, which
are open grates on runners, filled with
the Northwest,, traveling at a rate 200 or
300 miles a day, the wind being favorable.
Some grasshoppers are among the most
beautiful Insects in the world, with wings
resembling in beauty and delicacy of hues
the petals of flowersâ pink, green, blue
and otherwise tinted, with many varia
tions.
There are some of huge size, which have
a spread of nine Inches or more from wingf
tip to wing tip. Anybody who will exam
ine a grasshopper cannot fail to admiro
the beauty of its construction, and partic
ularly of the armor in which it is clad,
though it is a peaceable creature and by
no means inclined to combat.
In China grasshoppers are a fearful
plague at times, and occasionally the Gov
ernment orders out the soldiers to repel
the invaders. Each soldier carries, instead
of a gun, a coarse hempen bag attached
to a bamboo pole, which, with wide open
mouth, is used as a net.
A bounty is also paid to farmers for tha
dead insects at 40 cash per pound, and for
the eggs they collect. But the most ef
fective destroyers are ducks, which are
driven over the infested fields In flocks
numbering thousands, and gorge them
selves greedily with the hoppers.
In that country there ia a curious and
widespread belief in the existence of a
king grasshopper, called Wang, of colos
sal size and quasi-supernatural character,
who hovers invisible in the upper regions
of the air, directing the migratng swarms.
Sacrifices are made to him to persuade
him to spare the particular locality In
which his petitioners dwell.
lighted pitchplne, are drawn by horses
across the fields. Another method con
sists in digging pits, into which the
swarms are driven, with the help of wide
spread wings of canvas stretched on
sticks.
The eggs are enveloped In tough little
capsules, not .easily broken by pressure
between thumb and finger, but when
ready to hatch the coat of .the ovum is
dissolved and releases the insect. "When
new born the young grasshopper is cov
ered with a sort of veil, which presently
splits along the back and is kicked off be
hind. So long as there is plenty of food
in the neighborhood he does not move
about much, but when the available pro
vender is exhausted he starts out to look
for another spot, f
It is in this way that the great migra
tions are begun, an army of grasshoppers
on the' march being often as much as a
mile wide. They cover the ground dense
ly, devouring as they go all grass, grain,
and garden truck. Sometimes two such
armies cross each other, but each keeps
right along in its own course.
It is when grasshoppers develop their
wings that they really become rapid in
their movements. Some species of them
are much better flyers than others, while
certain kinds have only rudimentary
wings, 'and so cannot fly at all. Immense
clouds of the insects sometimes pass over
the plains and thinly settled regions of

A Daughter of Ne-nr Francs.
Mary Catherine Crowley has taken an
Interesting epoch of history as a setting
for her story. "A Daughter of. New
France" â Quebec and later the founding
of the American city of Detroit at the
end of the seventeenth and the beginning
of the eighteenth centuries. The. book Is
not of the red-handed melodramatic or
der, but is written with a care for exist
ing facts of that time and a careful re
gard for consistency of plot.
The greater part of the story c^a 1 * vrith
the parly French settlement of Detroit
by the gallant Sieur Cadillac. There in
rnouph of Indian "warfare, fights with tho
British and local conspiracies to give the
reauislte dash for a mild un"-to-date his
torical novel.' To further heighten the
dramatic coloring, the author introduces a
seeress and a mysterious red dwarf, who
play no Insignificant part in the destinies
of the principal characters.
The main interest centers In the lov-p
of Normand and Barbe. The-vonnz man
has the usual stupidity of a certain class
of lovers -in fiction, for he loves and vÂ«t
cannot believe that he is loved in return.
The author even has to marry Barbe off,
then kill her husband Immediately aftor
the wedding, and then bring up two .or
three Â¦ more lovers as a menace to the
faithful though slow Normand before h<Â»
finally realizes that Barbe has ever been
his at heart. The book is well written
and several strong scenes are laid out,
but not brought to skillful consummation
âthey seem lacking in climax.
*'A Daughter of New France" Is of more
value as a pretty picture of those early
days In French-Canadian history than it
Is as a romance, consequently its sales
are apt to be limited. It lacks Just those
points which have put "The Crisis." "The

Masters of Music.
An admirable book for music lovers Is
"Masters of Music." by Anna Alice
Chapin. It. cannot fail to appeal to all
interested in musical literature., for. It is
so concise and yet so full of facts. In"
brief M!ss Chapin gives biographies of all
the great composers and a characteriza
tion of their work.
Naturally the first name to rank with
the "masters" is that of Giovanni Pier
lulgi da Palestrina. "the Raphael of
music." who possessed the inspired genius
of music in sunny Ttaly of. the latter par*
of the sixteenth century. He was, and
Is. Justly considered the master of church
music.
Then, came Alessandro Scarlatti, 1643. of
whom comparatively little Is knownâ the
man who wa3 one of the founders of
symphonic and of operatic music and
also tHe forerunner of Gluck and Mozart.
Next to carve his name as one of genius
was George Friedrlch Handel, whose
music and name are both more familiar
to us to the present t day. s Then Miss
Chapln gives the life*of John -Seciastlrin
Bach, who. as the says, is justly entitled
to be*called "the greatest of all masters:
one of the musical heroes, before whom
â¢we how our he^ds in homage." -
Next she tells us the story of Bene
detto Marcello. who "has been called the
Titian and the Veronese of music, for
â¢what they have done with visible colors
In representing the vast Venetian spirit
he 'has done with subtle and expressive
shades of sound." Pergolese. Gluck and
Haydn all receive due space and then
she tells us* in an Interesting way 'of the
life and work of Mozart, that musical
marvel who accomplished so much in the
brief period of a life of Cii years. .
All the great masters receive due con
sideration In chronological orderâBeeth
ove^n. Weber. Meyerbeer. Rossini. Schu
r-ert. Ber!!oz. Chopin. Mendelssohn.. Bar
tholdy. Schumann. Liszt and Wagner.
After every biography is given a list of
the composer's most famous compositions
and interesting notes concerning them.
Miss Chapin's. book will doubtless find a
place in the library of every one who has
a regard for good musical literature. She
writes in perfect sympathy with her sub
ject and with a knowledge only acauired
by close and careful study. (Published

J DEVLINâ BOSS" is a book that
should soon take Its place among
e the best sellers of the day. It has
in It all that goes to make a popu
lar novel, besides a certain originality of
Theme that all of the popular novels do
not possess.
Mr. Francis Churchill Williams gives
his work the further title of "A Romance
of American Politics." The title of Mr.
Williams' book has a certain amount of
vagueness that night cover anything. ,
The word "romance." however, is rather
comfcrting to the general reader and
promises that the bock may not be dry.
But be not misled by names or titles, for
"J. Devlinâ Boss" belongs to that class of .
"once begun, never put down until
finished."
It i? in every sense a "Romance of
American Politics." with just enough of
politics to cast a shadow acaint; which ,
stands o"Jt strongly the romance of two
as pretty love stories as It has been my
pleasure to read for many a day.
In g-eneral works of fiction that cover a
man's life from boyhood to middle age
are not of the best.
This 1i= an exception.
Mr. wniiams holds his friends for
"Jimmy" right from his first boyish
Â¦pranks as newspaper kid to his last-polit
ical fight and final retirement. "Jimmy"
is so thoroughly "Jimmy" from the be
cinnirpr to the end that one. must praise
the author for that consistency of writing
generally found lacking. He develops his
character so gradually that the transitions
from boyhood to manhood are perfectly
natural and the reader unconsciously
stops his laughter at the odd tricks of the
child to follow with breathless interest the
political schemes of the man.
As a "Boss" Jimmy is unequaled and
rises until he has reached the top rung
of the ladder in that most peculiar of all
American tradesâ politics. But Jimmy
has that abcut him -which is a serious
drawback to the lasting success of one of
his kirdâ he has a heart, a great big heart
that eventually proves too much even for
such a clever scheming politician as
he is.
From the very beginning you can see
that Jimmy Is out of the ordinary. -
He is introduced to the reader while in
the act of receiving a beating at the hands
of one of the b'.g office boys of the Even
ing News. Jimmy knows how to lo.Â»e as
â¢well as to win. but it is not often that he
Is on the loslne: side.
He learns much as a small boy with the
paper. He finds a scheme for the Invest
ment of the other small beys* funds that
pays a small dividend to Mr. J. Devlin:
he levies tribute on all the editors by a
mild form of blackmail process; he goes
to the circus after inventing a brilliant â¢
excuse. This last proves his undoing.
for he "fakes" a runaway !n which he Is
the victim and then dramatically poses
8S a hero by seeing that the copy he had
at the time is sent 4.o the paper. The
Evening News prints a glowing account
of his heroism. Unfortunately the assist
ant city editor happens to be at the circus
and recognizes Jimmy there, hale and
pound He reports the "fake" to his chief
and Foon Jimmy receives an intimation
that he is about to be discharged.
Jlmiriy Is equal even to this emergency.
He decides not to be retired In disgrace
end therefore promptly hands In his resig
nation.
This resignation Is characteristic of the
boy and of the man as well. Many a time
before his final political downfall his
enemies think that they have done for
Jimmy only to find that he has merely
dropped that line of attack for a time and
is at them with some new scheme harder
ttian ever. Here is what he had to say to
the city editor:
Mr. W. S. Carp Es<v. City Editor, of the

As I said before, in "J. Devlinâ Boss"
there are two love stories that will take
their places among the very sweetest in
modern fiction. You cannot tell until the
very last page how either of them will
turn out, so to say-a'nything more about
them in a review would be to bring- the
wrath of the reader on my head.' Mr.
Churchill tells the romantic part of his
story too well to have it spoiled by
"hints" and "extracts."
There are some fine strong scenes of
dramatic interest In "J. Devlinâ Boss" and
one of the best points of the book is that

Elsewhere in the book are told the stories

interested in the academies of Babylon

perusing the articles on these subjects.
Topics of more general interest abound m
this volume, and one turns reluctantly
from the interesting theme of agriculture
to the more tragic history of Alsace,
trusting for new light on the sad events
of 1794. ip which hope he is not dlsap- ,

One of the most interesting features of
this work is the rr.ass of biographical ma
terial that has been collected and is here
presented for th-Â» first time. Thl3 mate
rial, embracing as it does the stories of
the careers of prominent living and of
famous deceased Jews, affords many sur
prises: but above all it shows what a
thoroughly versatile people the Jews real-,
ly are.
Ministers of all schools of theology will
find a unique feature of this encyclopedia
in the manner of treatment accorded to
Biblical subjects. These are treated, from
three or sometimes four polnt3 of view,
the first being always a purely Biblical
presentation. This is followed py a dis
sertation on the topic from the standpoint
of rabbinical literature, that vast collec
tion of commentaries, responsa and trea
tises which Jn this field has specially en
riched Jewish literature: and this In turn
Is followed by the views held by modern
scholars of the critical school. By these
means the trend of thought on Biblical
subjects, from Talmudlc times to the
present day. has been preserved and ts
printed here for the first time. This sys
tem also embraces all such topics as hnve
special interest for Juualsm from the Mo
hammedan side. ' â¢ .
A noteworthy characteristic cf this
Â¦work Is the fair and outspoken yÂ«t' un
biased presentation of matters affecting
the Jews. This may be observed especial
ly under Anti-Semitism and I/Antl-Juif.
Evidently the effort has been to give facta.
and not opinions on such subjects.
The typographical appearance of the
first volume is as near perfection as it i3
. mechanically possible for It to be. and the Â¦
paper used is of superfine auallty. The

A. M.; ROBERTSON.As he looked into the gloom he drew
back with a feeling of superstitious dread,
but the fierce hoots coming nearer over
came his momentary feaÂ» and he quickly
smoothed the marks left upon the sand
and entered the opening. , A fire burned
low in a far recessof thecave arid over
it was a. small, caldron that gave forth a
savory 'odor. Dried fuel was piled near
and some corn bread, lay within ireshly
"picked leaves. Jack threw, himself upon
a. large bear skin covering the rocky floor
Nearer crept the heated air until It
seemed that physical fortitude could bear
no more,\ then ready hands reached for
ward and pierced the tender flesh with
the cruel burning brands. Several' had
been thrust into his limbs when he felt
the thongs that bound his wrists suddenly
cut and a knife slipped into his closed
palm. A moment later a shriek of the
keenest agony rent the air, and a short
distance away Wailla rocked back and
forth, her face distorted with pain. The
critical moment had come. While the at
tention of the tormentors was turned to
ward, the shrieking girl Jack severed the
binding cords and bounded away with the
speed of a frightened deer. Nearly a
hundred yards were gained before the
Umatillas were whoeping, leaping and
running in his wake. Up; the acclivity,
which was not steep, but which proved
painfully oppressive to one contending
for life, he sped until he reached the sum
mit of the hill, where for a moment he
stood while the savage yells of his pur
suers rent the air." Then one desperate
leap and twenty yards below his feet were
buried in the soft, yielding sand.. Rank
sagebrush grew in .profusion, and beneath
its low branches he crept several rods
until he reached a small opening in the
rocks described by his dark-eyed rescuer.
ho had expected to be liberated.
gEFORE a* fire upon a great robe
made of raccoon skins sat, or rath
er reclined, a young man who look
ed strangely out of keeping; with
his uncouth and rude surroundings.
A glowing lire seemed to have been kin
dled within the depths of his dark eyes
and his head was held erect with a
haughty air, while a disd.-iinful smile
curved the lips and gave to the usually
gentle face an expression of stern, unre
lenting forbearance.
Upon one side nearly 200 grim warriors.
In black paint, relieved only by a head
dress of gayly painted feathers, stood
Â¦with stoic countenances awaiting- a sign
from Kawawa, their chief. Upon the
other side were nearly as many squaws;
great chains of white beads about their
necks, glowing like pearls above the
freshly painted flesh of red; their heads
bedecked with the white down of birds.
To the rear were the maidens, their long,
glossy hair parted and combed low over
their foreheads and hanging in braids,
plaited with beads of the richest hues,
adown their backs. Short skirts, made of
the finest skins, from which beads in pro
fusion dangled, covered the unpainted
portion of their bodies wiiile they, stood
in readiness for the signal they eagerly
watched to see given.
Noiselessly they passed from the
shadow of darkness Into the radiant light
of the campfire, where they arranged
themselves in a circle and then began a
weird, fantastic dance, round and round,
now treading upon the earth and again
seeming to float upon the quiet evening
air so lightly touched the tips of their
moccasined feet. Not a sound broke the
stillness until a yell of diabolical triumph
burst from the entire crowd of painted
warriors, the maidens vanished and" hand
in hand or singly these savage partici
pants danced until the perspiration, stood
in great drops upon their foreheads. The
mountains echoed the sounds of their
fierce cries and rude Bongs while one by
one they dropped upon the ground in ut
ter exhaustion, but to be replaced by
others.
For the first few hours of the evening
Jack Kennelworth had little knowledge
of the fate awaiting him at the hands of
his captors, but he felt, while he watched
with interest this weird dance, that it was
but the prelude of a long chapter of hor
rors that would close but with the dawn-
Ing of the day unless Providence, in
mercy, released the spirit from, the tor
tured body earlier. It was a common ex
pedient of the savages to test the nerves
of their victims with the severest proofs
and eagerly to watch for some sign of
weakness or yielding, when, instead of
lessening the severity of their infernal de
vices, they would redouble them and
laugh In fiendish delight at their victim's
sufferings. Knowing this and that es
cape was Impossible, their prisoner de
termined to die with the courase of tha
bravest warrior and to bear anything with
fortitude rather than disgrace his color.
Two maidens, one bearing a piece of
bark filled with water and the other a
bunch of feathers Instead of a towel,
stood before him and motioned him to
trash, after which they feasted him in the
beet manner their barbarous custom al
lowed. When this was completed it
seemed to be the signal for the ferocious
passions of the tormentors to spend their
force In cruelties.
The night was Intensely dark, but the
fagots were piled higher and higher upon
the brigfttly blazing campflre, which
lighted up the \ little valley with its
reddened glow and scattered the shadows
upon the mountain sides. The prisoner
Â¦was securely bound with ropes of bark
and fastened to & tree but a short dis
tance from the blazing fire, where he was
left to the mercy of the females. It being
a common practice for the women to
throw their victim Into an ungovernable
rage by their taunts and then suddenly
turn him over to the fiercer members of
the tribe in a frame of mind unable to
bear with heroic fortitude the agonies of
bodily pain. All the names of the lower
and least respected of the animals were
hurled at the fettered captive, and all that
ferocity and Ignorance could frame into
language tending toward effecting their
purpose fell from the lips of the excited
crowd without any apparent result. The
greater Indifference Jack manifested the
more greatly enraged became the savage
hags. The voices â¢ of the maidens, 6of t
and melodious as they usually were, be
came harsh and discordant sounds min
gled with the menaces of the older ones.
In their excitement they did not notice
Wailla as she passed and repassed again
and again so close to Jack that her low
whispered words were unheard and her
actions unheeded.
The warricrs rushed Into the circle and
scattered brands were drawn nearer to
the tree to which Jack was bound; fresh
sticks were eagerly gathered, and the
splinters which were to be thrust into the
flesh of the victim and then lighted when
the heat from the larger fire became al
most intolerable were collected and laid
in a heap near by. The flames began to
wave their forked tongues in close prox
imity, white the countenances around the
sufferer expressed neither sympathy, nor
mercy. He looked in vain for the face
that had but once that evening shone
with kindly light, but she, too, expressed
bv her manner only indifference to the
Icte Uom which fur a few brief moments

and lalnler as the warriors one by one
ascended the hilltop and descended in an

Mingled ' emotions -. caused his strong
frame to tremble like a tiny leaf before
the summer's breeze and the lonely howl
of a. coyote or. the call of a passing bird
made, him 'spring to his feet in terror. A
- ray j from the morning sunlight, penetrat
ing the darkened cave only aggravated
his fears lest his savage pursuers in re
doubled numbers should: trace him to his
hiding place, in which case he dared not
think to what torture their ferocious in
stincts would subject him. Thus, hour
after hour passed in a sleepless vigil until
the - light faded and' in . place the moon
l'ght, in silvery cadence, breathed* forth
peace and security and closed the tired
eyelids In repose so sound that Wailla
and her dusky companion. Song Bird, en
tered the cave and waited " with impa
tience his awakening. . Fearing lest lh*
-dawn would . reveal their absence Wailla
"touched Jack lightly upon the arm, at tha
same time saying, "Bu ho 'f raidâ Indian
gal'no'tell not'ing 'all. Warrior in dark
no no not'ingâ paleface safe."
V Wailla," said Jack, springing to his
feet and grasping the sun-browned hand
that trembled within his own, "how can
I ever thank you for .what you have done?
You are an angel of light to me, even
though you have been reared in darkest
savagery _ and .â belong . to yonder blood

.Wailla. " 'Tis well. She no like you talk

"Are. you sure Song Bird can be trust

"You mean no tell?"
"Yes, no tell, warrior where I am and
that' you visit me."

out 'all. Me tell when go awayâ no e*n
arer hereâ red man watch no get way yet."
As the days passed Jack grew to watch
with Impatience for the coming of his
nightly visitors and to miss the eager,
broken sentences of the one and the silent
companionship of the other. The low, soft
voice of "Wailla became as sweetest musio
to his ears, and he looked forward with
regret to the time when hla captivity,
fhould end.
Wailla had often drawn Song: Bird Into
conversation by repeating In the Indian
dialect Jack's messages and giving him
hers in return, but gradually this ceased,
and the v once light-hearted maiden was
forgotten as she crouched at the far end
of the cave, with eager jealous eyes not
ing every movement of her companions
and listening to the sounds which she
longed to Interpret yet could not.
* One evening Song Bird came alone at
an earlier hour than had been their cus
tom, and with motions made Jack un
derstand that ehe wished him to follow
.her. Thinking that some accident had
befallen "Wailla, he eagerly set out. It
was hard to keep up with the fleet feet
of the girl as she steadily followed an up
ward course, but her excited manner and!
hasty steps served as a stimulus, and In
fear and trepidation Jack hurried Â«tÂ»ward.
Song Bird stopped suddenly, and with
horror depicted upon her countenance
pointed downward over a jagged wall of
rocks. Jack drew nearer until his feet
rested upon the very edge of the chasm;
then he stooped forward to penetrate its
depths and shuddered as he thought of
what his eyes might rest upon.
Noiselessly Song Bird stepped forward:
one push from her strong, sinewy hands
and Jack fell forward, while a wild, ex
ultant laugh rang in his ears and echoed
among the mountains era It died away
Into silence. The Indian girl had kept
her trust of silence, but her wild, uncon
trollable love for the paleface captive
could not endure the fierce pangs of jeal
ousy-that rankled in her heart.
Jack's feet struck the hardened earth
and it was with difficulty he kept from
falling. On every side rose the rocky
walls, from whose crevices bright tangled
vines had taken root and trailed careless
ly over the loosened stones. Nestled,
among leaves of the glossiest green there
seemed to be gems of the rarest bright
ness, piercing and beautiful, growing
larger and more lustrous a3 the eyes of
Jack became fixed upon them, held as by
a magic spell. A subtle, burning, faacij
natlng gleam seemed darting directly Into
his eyes from every direction and formed;
a cloud of brightly hued colors that lulled
to sleep the senses of discrimination and
confused that of perception. He felt dizzy;
and sick, his blood seemed to run cold
through his veins, and yet he stood irreso
lute, unable to even cast a glance upward
toward the blue canopy of heaven. Pow
erful eyes shot forth fatal darts of fas
cination, malignantly bright, paralyzing
with terror and denying their victim the
pewer of flight even if the rocks had
parted and opened a way of escape. A
single cry above him awakened his con
sciousness but to the realization that his
feet rested in a cave that had long been
the nest of monstrous rattlesnakes. He
strove to scream, but his voice died away
like a feeble echo from afar off, and he
sank senseless upon the rocks. While flat
heads, distended mouths and curving?
necks threatened with Instantaneous
death; the long, tubulated fangs,
charged with venom, were ready to pierce
the flesh, -while the audibly articulated
ring announced the nature of the danger
ous presence by which he was surround
ed. "When Jack opened his eyes the cool
evening breeze gently fanned his brow
and above him bent the form of "Wallla.
while at his side lay a lasso of twisted
bark. He shuddered as memory returned
to him, but the dark eyes gazing into his
with love mirrored in their dusky depths
â¢filed the frightened heart and served as
a soothing balm to the overwrought
nerves. Again his eyes closed and the
-power of sense was lost while Wailla,
Wrapt him closer, last the air. too raw,
Should reach his blood; then o'er him. still
as death.
Bent, with hushed lips, that drank hiÂ« scarce
drawn breath.
"Â¦Wailla." Jack said, softly, "again you
have saved my life. "With ail possible
haste now I must get back to the settle
ment, for It will not be- long- before yon
v der hounds are upon my" track and further
efforts upon your part would be futile.
. Girl, can't you go, too? I cannot leave
you here. Some way you 'are different. I
had a sister once, a tiny, laughing tot.
whom we all fairly worshiped. She was
stolen when but 5 years old. My mother
has never recovered from the loss and my
father "still mourns the child who would
now be a woman grown. Come back with,
me to that home, Wailla. My parents will
never forget the preserver of their only
remaining: child, and all that loving hearts
can do will be done to make, you happy."
Wailla could not understand all that
Jack said, but her knowledge of English,
enabled her to comprehend his meaning.
She grew deadly pale as Jack continued
speaking and then, tearing from her neck
a tiny locket, she thrust it Into his open
palm. To his utter amazement Jack
found within the closed cases the pic
tured face of his mother. Â«|SMMM|
"Floss, my stolen sister," he cried.
"Come, for the love of heaven, comÂ©, be
fore it Is too late."
The remainder of our story is briefly
told. "Wailla proved to be Floss Kennel
worth, who had been stolen by the Uma
tillas and brought up as one of their own.
The locket she had been permitted to re
tain, ' as the Indians supposed it to be a
charm against evil. The child grew to
young womanhood, often looking at tha
mirrored face, little dreaming it was that
of her mother. She had a dim recollec
tion that her surroundings In early lif â¢
had been different. The palefaces cap
tured by the tribe always aroused her
deepest sympathy, and the wild, savage
scenes enjoyed by them were but visions
of horror to her white nature. As Jack
related the story of his lost sister mem
ory seemed to return to her of earlier
days and she wanted but the proof of the
picture to vefify the relationship "her heart
told her existed between them.
After, several days of traveling without
shelter or food, excepting a few herbs.
Jack and Floss reached a colony of . emi- '
grants who provided them with donkeys
and the necessary provisions to carry
them farther eastward, where anxious
parents welcomed their long-lost child.
Home surroundings and the advantages of,
education soon obliterated all traces of
the years spent with thosa of another race'
and color.

Did you know that a grassy California
hillside is the very place to ,take your
sleds on. a warm day? I^et me tell you
what I saw the other day near Pasadena.
I'd like to see it everywhere m the State
that there are boys and girls, for it's one
kind of a good tirfte. .
There were eight or ten. boys and a fol
lowing of girls going up along hill, with
immense unpainted single, sleds on their
backs. ....-â¢ ..-,:. , . .. : .
I tied my horse under the shade of a
giant live oak and started out in the boil
ing sun on a. tour of inspection, overtaking
the climbers about half way, up the hill.
I called to a boy: "Hello, there! What
are you dcinjf?" ; :
The entire tiock stopped with. faces :full
of surprise and . curiosity, mingled - with
alarm. Undoubtedly they took > me - for . a
landlord. I called out again: "What on'
earth. are" you doing in : this . hot sun?-
They looked at one another, in some sort
of dismay, as if they had never taken the
trouble to ;name their -pastime; ; then one
big. boy;~ whose .vocabulary was broad,
very politely - replied: Â¦; '"Coasting, Â¦Â¦. air!".
"Coasting?".' . I shouted, with not v a few

upon this matter is because, as has been

The first part of it !s so dim to him now
that it has to be gathered from the neigh

It runs that he is an East Indian Prince
who was- kidnaped in a very -faraway
youth and taken to the South Sea Islands.
From there, where he worked as a slave
for colonists, he broke away and made
and people in the neighborhood brinfe
him food. It is a miserable way for him
to get along, and his friends proposed
that he be taken vhere he could be looked
after professionally, as befits his rank.
"What shall we do?" they all sa'.d. and
kept saying it over and over in the way
that people have.
"We'll telephone to the Asfoclatec
Charities." said Captain Canty of Engine
31, going at the matter with a blow from
the shoulder. Thereupon he telephoned,
the Associated Charities took up the mat

the City and County Hospital.
There was no time lost. The hospital
eent its ambulance and all looked like
smooth sailing ahead for the Prince.

drive to the door, owing to there being

He opened the door and entered in Joy

exactly what he must want; he was proud
and cheerful and he greeted his Highness
pally.
"Here we are, Aupi. Come on. You're
off at last."
"What? What? Who are you?" Aupi
mumbled in a turmoiL
"I'm the City and County Hospital.
You're in luck, Aupi. to be taking a trip

As he reached a pair of sturdy arms into
the bunk preparatory to heaving ho he re

bed and walked. Aupi, only somewhat
larger than a good-pized cricket, stone

him and seized his stick. It is as long as

A Fall From a Great Height
Will Tear the Shoes
From Your Feet
I ASKED the men on the new. East
River bridse it any of their mates
who had fallen from the top of the
tower had lost their boots In the de
scent, said an old engineer. "They all
declared that they had not, but I believe
that they did. If they didn't. East River
bridge builders are setting a new' stand
ard for the workmen of the future to fall
by. In the past the men who fell from
great heights were pretty sure to lose
their boots before they reached the
ground. Miners who fell down deep
shafts struck the earth barefoot, and the
builders of high towers who were so un
lucky as to lose their footing reached
terra firma in the same condition. Of
course there were exceptions to the rule,
but in all these exceptional cases the
footgear was laced skintight, and the
general conditions of the fall were such
as to prove the rule of loosened shoes.
â¢'This subject always held especial in
terest for me, but nowhere have 1 found
a satisfactory explanation of the phe
nomenon. In the summer of 1SS6 I was on
an Ohio River steamboat plying between
Cincinnati and Cairo. Once we pulled
out from Cincinnati about 10 o'clock in
the evening. By'the time we reached the
lower bridge we were making pretty fair
headway. I was standing on the upper
deck, about two feet from the railing,
looking up into the network of the
bridges' wires. . Just as we entered the
shadow I saw. something large and black
fall from the railing above and shoot
down toward the water. For a few sec
onds I held my breath, and not until I
heard a thud on the deck beside me did I
collectmy wits sufficiently to realize that
a man had fallen off the bridge and that
I must give the alarm. Even then I
picked up the object at my feet before
calling to the rest of the crew. The thing
that had brought me to my senses was a
bootâ a high top boot of fine leather and
email -size. My mites had been aroused
by a splash in the water at the stern of
the boat and we put quickly about and
summoned aid, but although boatmen
beat about in the river half the night
they found no trace of the man.
"Most people inclined to the belief that
he had escaped, for an examination of thÂ«Â»
boot revealed that hÂ© had good reasons
for avoiding pursuit. Inside the lining
of the boot were found important docu
ments that had been stolen from a promi
nent business man of Covington. At first
it was believed that the boot would prove
a valuable clew whereby the. thief might
be traced, but it was destitute of telltale
marks and was utterly useless so far as
the clearing up of the mystery went. The
papers were the thing coveted, however,
and once they had been restored 1 their
owner did not feel inclined to spend much
time and money in trying to answer the
questions. 'Who was the thief?' 'Where
was her and 'Did he fall from the bridge
by accident or design?' \ But although
those problems are "yet unsolved the ad
venture demonstrated to my satisfaction
that boots do slip off feet in a swift d*>
scent from some great height,- and the
next time some poor fellow tumbles from
East River bridge I hope his friends win
pay particular attention to hi* boots."

to frighten the boys.

He went off into a cackle of laughter.
"It was all I ever could do to support

It appears to have been even, more. Two

ashes and the Junk these two years and
in the same neighborhood in another cabin
for some half a hundred years before that
and you could no more transplant him
than you could the Charter Oak. He won't
go. For it is too late to return to his
people.
His idea of a hospital is that it is a
chamber of tranquillity. He is firmly con
vinced that his days are numbered if he
enters there, and as it is, being not a day
over 130, Aupi looks forward to being here
when wireless telegraphy connects us with
Mars. He isn't going to be duped into
dying, not he.
His age Is something that nobody is
quite sure of, but it is certainly not over
130. H is anywhere between that and 125.
He lived here before pioneer days, before
the gringos came, and those who remem
ber him then say that he was a very old
man at that time.
Thirty years ago he had a sickness and
people said then that it must be his last,
for he was too old to withstand it.

THE Prince of Washerwomans Bar
lies sick unto death in the royal
residence.
What's more, he won't be moved
from that same residence, although
the draughts play hide and seek in and
about the crack under the door and cer
tain neighbors have a careless Way of
helping themselves to the provisions that
charity furnishes, and the Prince, being
blind and without retinue at present, has
no way to guard his own.
There is a bulldog dwelling near him,
but the bulldog is a lazy cuss.
Consequently when* the officer of the
City and County Hospital went for the
Prince the other day to take him away
there was nobody, not even the bulldog,
to defend him. And the officer, who in-
Fists that he had the best intentions in
the world, blundered straight into the
residence and was for carving him oft,
when he took matters into his own hands,
rose from his bed and beat off the in
truder with a stick. It should have been
the duty of a royal bodyguard.
The Prince has a delightful name. It is
Aupi Maru Mori, which sound's some
thing like a college yellâ as for instance:
Aupi Maru Mori
Naughty-two for glory!
And wind up with a "Rah!" Or, better
yet, like a counting-out:
On*, two, who told a utory? *
. Three, four, Aupi Maru Mori,
And so on to "You're it."
He has lived in the Washerwomans
Bay region ever since anybody can re
member, and he has been old enough to
die for all of that time. He Is Aupl to
everybody around there, and everybody
has seen him for years, bent like a car
penter's square, creeping along with his
big stick.
Now that he has reached the time when
the grasshopper has become a burdenâ
the grasshopper in this case evidently be

enough to that of a brittle little brown

THE PRINCE OF
WASHERWOMAN'S
BAYTHERE are many people who from a
false idea of economy fail to get tha
best results from the use of Ice and
refrigerators. A common mistake is
getting a small piece of ice every day or
every other day instead of filling the Ice
chamber two or three times a week. The
small piece of ice cannot reduce the tem
perature sufficiently, and the result la
that each new piece melts rapidly and the
food cannot be kept long. It will be found
at the end of the season that the cost of
ice and waste of food have been much
greater than if the ice chamber had been
kept filled. Another mode of economiz
ing is to wrap the ice in woollen cloths or
paper. This would be all right If the idea
were to preserve the ice, but thus wrap
ped it cannot cool the refrigerator, and so
fails in doing Its legitimate work. There
are. on the other hand, people who are
perfectly reckless in the way they waste
ice and lower the temperature of the re
frigerator. Such people place warm food
in the refrigerator, and even on the ice.
hoping to cool it more quickly, thus rais
ing the temperature and producing a va
por which is bad for both the food and the
refrigerator. People should learn that
.food cools, to a certain point, more quick
ly in the open air than in a closed refrig
erator.âLadies* Home Journal
THE ECONOMY
OF ICE
There are twenty variations of the trick.
In case one is exposed there are nineteen
others to fall back on. There are wireless
telegraphy; the Ridden camera, that com
mands the house; a little silken thread,
running from the '.man in the gallery, to
the little spring trigger under the per
forated shoe of the girl at the piano, held
high above the audience by the big chan
delier or a pendant from the celling. This
Invisible silk thread is worked' by the man
in the gallery repeating the signals by*, a
tick-tack code, giving the numbers to the
pianist on the stage. Then .there 'Â¦ is the
telegraph wire, laid down along the aisle
or to the gallery, the 7 - signal being given
looking screen/ panel Deanng a double
headed eagleâ the Austrian coat of arms â
surmounting the large cabinet of cos
tumes occupying so much space on, the
stage. The programme does not explain
that this screen panel Is transparent from
behind, and that an accomplice with a
.strong magnifying lens reads every move
'made by Svengali; and not a word is said
of the other man in the Â¦ gallery, who
faces Svengali and repeats his signals to
the man behind the transparent coat of
arms bearing the imperial eagles of Aus
tria, who directs the pretty .girl at tha

But how?

Here is an illustration of how the figure

songs and operas "are on numbered" lists.
Svengali in the aisle,' with his code of sig
nals, has all these numbers committed to
memory. 1 '.'Â¦* ,' $'r\\^0'.
The Systems Explained.
In the present performance by the Sven
galis the key signals, so few and simple
as to be unobserved by a majority of the
spectators, : tell the chief operator, con
cealed behind a transparent screen on the
stage", what has been ; whispered as clearly
as if the word were shouted through a
megaphone.
with the foot fo deftly that the man at
the operator's elbow, his eyes glued to
the stage, knows nothing of it, -all of
which may be verified by visiting Martin
ka's Palace of Magic, in Sixth avenue,
where other equally .wonderful tricks are
exploited and explained to visiting magi
cians, from: Kellar. to Herrmann.
You can label your ; eyes, your move
ments or even your glances, meting, them.
: If you label the Lord's prayer No. 4 and
the Declaration of Independence No. 5 you
may instantly telegraph the mighty liter
ature, through wireless space-^enough lit
erature to save all Europe from* anarchyâ
by two natural' movements of: the hand.
Thus you have the code/ system by
which operators can communicate vol
umes by using a codified list of numbered
words or. sentences.' . . â¢Â¦ .
Say the human . head Is .used for this
purpose. Imagine the top of the head,
right hand side, as No. 1, the right ear as
No. 2, the jaw. as -No. 3 and the neck as
the cipher; the forehead No. 4,' the hose
No! 5, the chin No. 6,-the top of the head
on the left side as No. 7, the left ear No. 8
and'the, left side of the jaw No. 9. Â¦" -
trates the system of communication by
numbers, nine figures and a cipher (0), by
which all the wealth of the world may ba
measured, and. any, number of words may
be communicated without a word of
speech./One has but to â¢â¢ map out a square
on his face, breast or body and number
it with these nine-figures, with "an extra
space for the cipher, to. be ready for the
Svengali business. That is,? when he has
memorized the names and the numbers
representing, them.
But it may be asked, How does Sven
gali, or his confederates, rather, know
which list the names are to be found in?
That is easy to answer. A separate sig
nal designates it. When the Svengali shot
his hand into the air two fingers were dis
played, meaning list No. 2â the list con
taining the operas. Each signal tells its
story, tells the confederates on the staga
exactly what to' do, and so thÂ© perform
ance proceeds, as wonderful to the spec
tators as if the spirits of the other world
were in control of the show and could pro
duce Caesar or Cleopatra in flesh, bones
and blood.
In all these spooky exhibitions the par
ticularly wise man in the audience who
was the wonder of fond parents. in his
boyhood sees everything but how tb'e
trick is performed." , > .
Even experts are now and then deceived
by some - new feat of legerdemain by a
new magician.' Look at the* wonders per
formed by Kellar and Herrmann. Last
week two professors of the art were dis
cussing new tricks in a friendly way,
when one of them said: "Have you seen
the latest? Here is a poker deck. Select
any card you please."
The friend drew, the queen, of hearts.
"Now write a line to my wife at the "Wal
dorf, asking her what card you have
drawn.". The friend wrote the. note,
handed it to the magician^ "sealed," and
asked if . the . address was correct. The
wizard barely took the envelope in his
. hand; ' handed > it back, - and a messenger
boy carried it* to the lady at the Waldorf,
immediately returning with the answer: '
Wonderful is the power of numbers
all the great libraries of statistics and
tabulated- statements are the magic ma
nipulation of nine little figures and a lone
ly cipher. v \
"Let them fight it out. I'm out of k.
Glad I'm happy, though rich."
Mr. Shaffer, having a little code of his
own on behalf of the 'strikers, puts "his
palm against his ear, saying, "Strike 'em
for "more than we want, and take what
you can get,\ or I'll skip the works and
jump the job v ." v
Not a' word had been uttered aloud, yet
to-morrow the continent may tremble and
Btocks go waltzing up and down the list.
And Mr. Carnegie, three thousand miles
away across the damp" sea, .puts his
thumb to ' his nose and says without
words: â¢ :. : - :â¢'â¢ y'' r -X'~r
Thus a conversational code may be im
provised and with such a list once coiu
mitted a lot of noiseless conversation may
be carried on by magnates or strike offi
cials at critical moments, as, for example:
, -Scene, corner of Broad and Wall streets
â Mr. Morgan, touches his chin, saying by
his private code to Mr. Schwab, "Make
terms with the strikers or I'll smash the
combination."
Any One Can I>o It.
take the places of the nine omnipotent
numbers. Again: Glance upward to the
right for No. 1, straight upward for No. 2
and upward to the left for No. 3. Re
peating, glancing horizontally for Nos. 4,
5 and 6. Repeating the same again, by
glancing downward for Nos. 7, 8 and 9,
and stroking your chin for the cipher (0).
With your back to the audience you can
telegraph in a similar way, using your
arm and elbow to make the necessary
signals.- Let the right arm, hanging down,
represent No. 1; the elbow, projecting
from the side, No. 2; elbow raised, No. 3.
Repeat with the left arm for Nos. 4, 5 and
6; with either hand placed naturally be
hind you, on the small of the back, above
the belt and over your shoulder for Nos.
7, 8 and 9, and on the back of your head
or neck for the cipher (0).
"Tou drew the queen of hearts from my
husband's pack."
The friend was astounded. Then tha
trick was explained. When the magician
took the envelope to glance at the super
scription he pinched the lower right-hand
corner, leaving the impress of his thumb
nail on the envelope. It told the lady that
the card was the Queen of hearts, in ac
cordance with a code of signals which
they had worked on for a month, with a
view to performing just such feats.
With a pencil divide an envelope into as
many squares as there are cards in a
pack, and number each square accord
ingly. By practice the operator will be
come perfect, able to tell at a glance on
any blank envelope Just what card may
be designated by the mark of
identification.
Another way Is to give your friend tha
number of the room, say 23, which is In
correct, it being the number of the card,
drawn. "I made a mistake," he said;
"the number should be 42." It is erased,
the right number (42) substituted. Tha
lady, seeing the number canceled by a
stroke' of the pen, knows it is the num
ber of the card.
Still another method la to let tha falsa
room number stand, as the hotel clerk will
send the note to the lady regardless of the
error, and by this false number on tha
envelope, supposed to represent the room,
the lady will know what card the friend
has drawn. How simple are the tricks
that mystify the wise and coin money for
the hard working magician!
"The moral of all this," said an expert,
"is that the really honest men are tha
professional magicians. They maka no
pretense that their feats are of a super
natural character, but the slat* writers
and bogus clairvoyants claim supernat-
ural power and demand money for com
municating with the dead, which is Im-
position and fraud.
"The tricks of Kellar and Herrmann fas
surpass the most expert of the mediums,
and no claim is made that they axa ofi
spiritual agency."
"ine situation was tersely summed up
yesterday by a distinguished "magician,"
who said: "The age of miracles is past.
Only one man performed miraculous
feats, and he was crucified."
eaid it was "great," and Svengali, the
genius of the show, wore a smile that
reached around ' the block.
If you don't know how such feats are
dene they simply bewilder the Imagina
tion. If your whispered thoughts can be
read by a stranger at the further end of
the hall, why isn't it all true, you ask
yourself â every claim made for the super
natural, communication with the absent
and dead, voices in the air, whispers at
midnight, voodooism and witchcraft,* ami
the telepathy that carried the news of
the Sepoy mutiny across Hindostan In a
moment of time. ,
"Th-re are more things in heaven and
earth than are dreamed of in your phil
osophy, Horatio," you murmur to your
self as the exhibition goes on, and weird
possibilities thrill those hungry for a
word from some dear friend beyond the
grave. Even the vteiting detective, who
got in on his badge, with telescope nose
end gimlet eyes, thinks it clairvoyance or
spirits. And so the tests go on, up one
aisle and down another, Spiritualists
Â¦whispering, "I told you so," and country
mediums believlns it all a part of the
spook gospel originated years ago by Ka-
piano.

7 WO persons (lady and gen

toward the stage, to receive the
wishes of the audience. If the

emphasized that the lady and gentleman
on the stage have'their backs to the audi
ence, while Svengali down in the aisle has
his back to the stage, making collusion
apparently impossible. This makes a pro
found impression on the. public.
The few experts present pay little atten
tion to the stage. Their eyes are fixed on
the man Svengali in the aisle, noting
every move he; makes. It is observed
that his numerous gestures, his frequent
use of his, handkerchief, the pressure of
his fingers on his eyes, i as if to hypnotize
his assistants on the stage, .are natural
movements, attracting no attention, yet
necessary to hide the vital 6ignals in tha

whirls around disguised as Bismarck,

It is reserved for the Call-Herald to de

may be performed. The chief thing is a
perfect performance. Art must conceal

the tricks so simple that every eye is de

When the curtain rises the master of
ceremonies, well dressed, with a modest
flower in his buttonhole, walks to the
front of the stage with the confidence
that inspires confidence and in a pleasing
voice begins: "Ladies and Gentlemen: I
have the pleasure of introducing to you,

that the audience must confine their whis

nerves of well-known personages, songs
and opeias of international fame," etc.

In the women's doubles" the strongest
teams will be the Suttons and Miss Hall
and Miss -Hoffman, j The latter is a very
aggressive player and shows to" better ad
vantage in doubles than in singles..
The men's doubles has a very open look
and will in 'air probability .go to ono of
the following teams: . Bell -arid Braley.
Hunt and Murdock, Collier and 'Cro well,
MacGavln and Smith or Sinsabaugh and
Hendricks. . ;
In the mixed doubles it was the original
intention of the committee to limit the
entry to six teams, but as it is to be a
championship affair it must necessarily
be open to all. , Heretofore none but local
players have figured in the coast cham
pionship tournaments, but this year the
presence of several cracks from Southern
California will add to the interest In > the
different events. It will be a struggle for
supremacy between the north and the
south, with the odds slightly in favor of
the former. V Those who will surely como
up from the south are Champion Alfonso
Bell, Harold ' Braley,' Sinsabaugh and
Hendricks. The two former are the cham
pions of Southern Calirornia â¢ in doubles.
The â¢ ladles who . have:, come up are the
Misses May and Violet Button,' Mrs. Sey
mour and Miss Ruby Garland. Miss May
Button is the lady champion of the south
and Is expected to carry off the cham
pionship. . Local people will , pin their
faith to Miss Hall, the present champion,
who. is the only one having much of a
chance . against the Suttons. . â¢
The coast, championship tennis tourna

gles. This year two new events will be
addedâ the .mixed doubles and doubles.
The doubles will begin on Monday and
will be followed by the â¢ mixed doubles.
The singles, being the most important,
will be played last, at the end of the weelt.
The finals of the singles will, be played
Friday afternoon and the championship
match on Saturday afternoon. The

Â¦ 'The committee of the Pacific Coast Golf
Association feels hurt at the behavior of
the Los Angeles golfer3. The contest for
the Poniatowski cup at Burlingame was
postponed from July 4 to August 15 in or

fornia an opportunity to compete at Bur

two journeys; yet no women from South

up to' Del Monte to measure her strength
against Mrs. R. Gilman Brown.
The qualifying round of the contest for

NOTABLE DOGS
WITH REC0RDS
CHAMPIONSHIP
TENNIS GAMES
Beacon is technically" barred from par-'
ticipaUng- In any of the Union Park
stakes. It seems a shame that because
of. some trivial excuse a dog of Beacon's
caliber is lost to the coursing world.. There
are many steady patrons who figure the
blue dog the best greyhound in the State,
and it is a mooted question of superiority
between him and Palo Alto. In the last
John Grace cup event Beacon was runner
up to Sacramento Boy In a final that cre
ated the greatest enthusiasm and one that
will go down in history. Now that the
event Is again at hand something should
be done' to straighten matters, that the
great courser may again be seen on the
field. Some arbiter should be selected to
settle the dispute.
Luxor' is the best of the "old" stake
winners, and at four years and ', three
months holas the record for good, steady
work. - His brother. Young America, could
always lead him, but Luxor would beat
him to a decision. Young America won
>take after stake until three years of age,
at which time he was taken from 'the
same.
Rosette, too, was a youngster of "win
ning ways" and after being beaten by
Benicia Boy won everything in which she
Â¦was entered. She died when two and a
half years of age, at a time when she had
â¢won more and lost fewer courses than
any hound in the running. â¢ .
Lottie 51 started at eight mdnths and
at fourteen months had an open stake to
her credit. Cavalier commenced at nine
months and was an earner from the start.
Recording 'Angel won a sapling stake at
eight months and when lacking ten days
of being eleven months old took fourth
money In the Produce stake, a wonderful
performance. She led her opponents
many lengths in every course and beat in
succession Controller, Lady Davenport,
Whitehead and Cash. Her work was the
feature of the stake. As this extraordi
nary eapling advanced In age she showed
the effects of her hard work and failed to
better her record.
â¢T. J. Cronln'a Vandal is a performer
who has earned the title of champion.
Whelped in January, 1899, In December
of that year he divided a thirty-two-dog
sapling stake at Union Park with Daisy
Dale and during the next month divided
another sapling event with Vixen. Before
this, and when but 10 months old, he won
three courses In an old dog stake and
was then withdrawn. Later at the age
of 13 months he took third money In an
all-age stake. This kind of going broke
the youngster's heart, though it showed
that, he was not lacking as a courser.
doga, Is the critical age of a courser. Palo
Alto has been a money maker. His first
win was when at 14 months he annexed
a puppy stake at Ingleside and finished
the season with five stakes to his credit.
Last year he broke the record with nine
stakes.
Next Saturday, August 31, the event set
down on the programme of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club Is to start at 3 p. m. on
a cruise to Drakes Bay, with sports, fish-
Ing a picnic on September 1, return-*
ing to Sausallto on the 2d. As the flag
ship Ramona Is at present on an ocean
cruise there Is little likelihood that, the
cruise to Drakes .Bay. will take \ place.
Yacht. owners do not care much for out
side cruising, and at this season fogs are
very prevalent. - It is much more proba- "
blr that the cruise In squadron will be
and that the Sausallto yacht
owners will follow their . time-honored
practice of sailing at their own sweet will.
The annual cruise of tne Corinthian
Yacht Club began last Saturday, Commo
dore H. D. Hawks flying his flag. from J.
M. Mattorn's Amigo. The fleet comprised
the sloop Speedwell, the yawl Arcturua
and E. F. Sagar's sloop Edna. Frank
Bartlett .started with Mrs. . Bartlett last
Monday on a two weeks* cruise, and H.
H. Gorter's Sans Soucl left Tlburon on
August 12, the owner's intention being to
take . a two weeks' trip. Last night the
yachts returning from the up-river cruise
were met at Vallejo by several yachts
from Tiburon and to-day the fleet will
cruise down from Mare Island to the cove.
Nor was this all. for the stakeboat
marking the outer extremity of the start
ing line off Powell-street wharf a small
yacht's tender was employed, though the
committee had been warned that it would
not serve the purpose. In the strong tide
way the little tender was half pulled
down by the weight of its own anchor
line, and when the twenty-footer Anita
fouled It quickly filled and swamped, be
coming entirely useless as a mark." When
Dr. T. L. Hill, at the close of the race,
tried to get hold of the tender he had
very great difficulty in doing so. as the
tide had turned and the water was lumpy.
In the course of his efforts the small boat
got under the, yacht's . centerboard and
generally misbehaved herself, while, to
add to the trouble; the yacht had several
ladies aboard and very few men and CO
other yacht would lend any assistance.
The sloop Mischief lost some lime in
looking for the leeward stakeboat. but
covered the course, and will receive a flag
in class 1. The sloop Aeolus made thÂ»
fastest time around the course, but It is
not certain that she had on board a mem'-'
ber of the San Francisco Yacht Club, as
the rules require. She certainly commit
ted a breach of good taste in flylnjr a
Corinthian burgee throughout the day. It
she Is found to be indiglble, the flag In
class 2 will go to Paul de Martini's Siren*.
The Â¦whole event was practically handed
over to one man, who was dumped on
Powell-street wharf with a brass cannon,
half a dozen shells and the time allow
ances. With these and any casual help
that might offer itself he was expected
to run the whole show. Fortunately for
him a present and a past member of the
regatta committee of another local yacht
club turned up on the wharf and freely
lent their services. Even the shells pro
vided for the starter were defective, the
start of the boats in class 2 beins de
layed two minutes from the failure of one
of them to explode and the difficulty of
extracting it from the gun.
The annual regatta of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, held last Sunday over
the new course, was a very poorly man
aged affair, a result largely due to the
fact that the regatta committee consists
entirely of yacht owners, all of whom
were engaged in sailing their own boat3
Instead of performing the functions of a
committee. s Two of the committee took
part In the race, while the third sailed his
yacht out to serve as a stakeboat. ThÂ«Â»
leeward, stakeboat was considerably out'
of position, arid as soon as Surprise., tho
last of the entries In class 2, had rounded
the. stakeboat the owner made â¢ sail,
weighed anchor and cruised away, so that
the twenty-footers Anita and Dewey had
no leeward mark to round. /-'Â¦:! 'Â¦'Â¦'
At the last regular meeting of the Dol
phin Boating Club a set of engrossed res
olutions was presented to Alexander W.
Pape, thanking him for his services to
the club and complimenting him on his
many victories on the water.
Next menth the Alameda Boat Club
will hold Its annual club championship
regatta either on Oakland. Creek, near Its
boathouse, or on Lake Merrltt. In order
to excite more" interest one of the San
Francisco clubs may be invited to send
over a barge crew for a match race.
It seems probable that th3 Pacific As
sociation -will not hold any annual row
ing championship meeting this year, as
nothing can be done until the return of
the oarsmen from Astoria, Xo adequate
amount of money is in hand and no suit
able course is ready. An attempt might
be made to hold a regatta on Oakland
Creek, so as to demonstrate the value of
that water as a rowing course. But to
bring this, about some aid must be re
ceived from the railroad company, as
sheds at least would have to be erected
on the Alameda mole for. the accommoda
tion of the contestants.

such as are given here so successfully
from tirr.e to time. â¢ Â¦
In the South End four are Jenkins,
Harris, Cashman and Foley, all of whom
are more or less known as ' barge-rowers
or single scullers. The South End crew
has been going out nearly every evening.
If onlr four crev.s can go it certainly
seems as though there should be a try
out to determine which shall be the lucky
crews. The intention is to go by the
steamer leaving this city for Portland
on August 26, but if the steamer should
be tied up It will probably prevent any
rowing 1 men going from San Francisco
or vicinity, as the Astoria committee la
not prepared to furnish transportation
by rail, and the rowing clubs would not
care to run the risk of sending their rac
ing barges, skiffs and shells on so long a
journey by train. If the oarsmen, scull
ers, swimmers, track and field men from
San Francisco all succeed in reaching
Astoria it is likely that the carnival there
will eclipse the similar events of previous
years. The track and field team of the
Olympic Club will consist of s'.x men and
a trainer and there will be boxing, wrest
ling and other sports. John Hammer
smith, leader of the Olympic Club, has
South End bcathouse.' whereas the Ari
els have practiced little for the past few
weeks.
The Ariel four Is made up of E. L.
Smith, Harry Foley, W. T. Howe and
Robert Ellis, all of whom have some
reputation as oarsmen, two of them be
ing seniors and the other two intermedi
ates. It is said that the Olympic crew
feels sure of going, but It comprises no
men who have any reputation as barge
rowers, the only man who has ever done
snytning- in a boat being T. J. Sherry,
who vras second In the junior skiff race
en Lake Merrltt. Cornell and Melrose
are fine swimmers and Prendergast was
in the Olympic four which came In last
Et the Belvedere regatta In 1300. Thvjy
have been going out regularly from the
JC. ilcCITE, secretary of the execu
tive committee of the eighth As
toria regatta, has written to the
chairman of the regatta cotnmit
â¢ tee .cf the Pacific Association In
this city, stating that transportation for
only four crews can bo provided. As five
crews are looking forward to going to
Astoria, this leaves one out in the cold.
The shell four of the University of Cali
fornia and the barge crew of the Ala
meda Beat Club are pretty certain of
their places, so the struggle will come
in between the South End, Ariel and
Olympic fours.

REGATTA FULL
OF ACCIDENTS
SARATOGA. N. Y./Aug. 22.â Better rac
ing has marked. the second week of i the
meeting than was had before the horses
got settled to new track conditions and
the public got a definite line on form.
Saratoga has had a fortnight of sport far
above the level of that seen here since
the old days, when the' champions of the
East and the West assembled every year
to do battle.
The Saratoga meeting has served to
bring to the front .an aggregation of
young horses that .make this year's crop
of two-year-olds superior to any since. His
Highness, St. Florian, Nomad, Merry
Monarch and the extraordinary lot; of
' youngsters out in 1891 were fighting, for
supremacy. Perhaps there is not a colt
here or anywhere else that can be fairly'
ranked with Domino or Robbins. None
has shown enough * to be classed* with
Commando, but there are more good juve
niles in training than has been the case
In several years, any one of which is
liable to demonstrate his claim to rank
as the champion of the year before many
more races are run.
Something of a sensation was created
when it became known that Blue Girl,
the undisputed queen- of the "fillies, and'
reckoned by a majority of the smart peo
ple the best of her age in training, is a
bleeder. The daughter of Sir Dixon and
Bonnie Blue is one of the raciest thor
oughbred specimens that ever, wore ..a'
plate. She, is in .miniature a living like
ness of the peerless Yo Tambien in every
thing but color. In! her preparation for
the Saratoga Special Blue Girl bled freely.
It was with the utmost reluctance that
John Madden confirmed the rumor to that
effect, which ! spread like wild fire before
the filly had been gotten back to ' her
stall. It Is questionable whether Blue
Girl's usefulness will be impaired by the
rrialady. She was started in the big race
on Madden's assurance that she would do
herself full justice, and she did. Nobody
can detract from the : magnificent per
formance of Goldsmith, winner.' of the
race. He is in every line and inch a race
horse of superb finish and courage. A
compact mass of bene and muscle, the
son of Meddler is a treat' to the discrimi
nating eye when In action. He has thews "
and sinews like a three-year-old, sugges
tive inVevery sense of Ben Brush at his
age. and the colt or filly that beats him
Â¦ in the Futurity will have a-plenty of work'
cut out â¢ before getting to \the judges'
stand. - ' ' Â¦" ' ' . â¢ ' ", ' Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
It is not exaggeration to say there are
at least four two-year-olds this : year,
taken Â¦ collectively, that will compare' fa
vorably with, the four best out last season.
Commando was undoubtedly In a class by
.'himself..- He was not in the Futurity.
Blue Girl is the equal and doubtless a bet

FROM SARATOGA
Charlie Mayberry, who has been so suc
cessful in the past with Ellison's horses,
is out after a severe attack of typhoid
fever. Perhaps Mayberry's sicknessis in
a measure responsible for the bad show

has been a wonderfully successful trainer

It has been a disastrous meeting for the
bookmakers to date. An unusual 'per
centage of favorites have won the money,
and the summer crowds are always par
tial to what seems the best horse. Eddie
Burke, one of the biggest, layers In- the
business, is more than $100,000 loser on
the season, half of. which has gone put
of the wrong end of the box since cut
ting in here. George Rose, who makes
a' colossal book and handles a , fortune
every day, has come nearer to standing
them off, although he has a considerable
balance coming from the losing side.
Frank Eckert, a fast gambler and clever
bookmaker, has had a severe drubbing
since the, meeting began. His losses ag
gregate $35,000. Joe -Rose is also many
thousands to the bad, and has probably
lost all the money he made. earlier in the
season. George Wheelock, once the king
pin of the bookmaking fraternity, is more
conservative- no w^ but he is behind on his
season's work. J. J. O'Neill, formerly of
Chicago, Is also short many of the big
bills he began the season with. Abe Levy
is in the same fix, and probably the only
Â¦winner substantially to the good is I-eo

Bohemian outdoor gatherings. ItThas oft

night, for the marvelous .. fidelity . .with
which he produces that cold, steely at

the query. He does not paint, but the
night owls are familiar with the sight of
this artist wandering about, making â¢ a
study sketch here, Jotting down certain
tor.es or details and studying the differ

are still fresh in the memory, Mr. Peters

There is a well developed sense of hu
mor in elephants. In the early career of
the Ringiing circus Erutus was the name
of their only elephant. The youngest
Ringiing brother, John, was a leader in
mischievous pranks at their home in Bara
boo, Wisconsin. When the show returned
for the winter, John thought he could
show off a little before his pals at the ex
pense of the big elephant, and invited sev
eral of his friends to go with him. Hav
ing come .to the elephant's barn, John
first gave him candy, then cake, and
finally cried, "Now boys!" and slipped a
piece of bad tobacco Into his trunk, in
tending, to get out of danger a'nd enjoy

her forehead to the end of the thing apd
pushed It forward. She would have pusft

that lift, and the wagon came, up and
moved forward to solid groundâthe most
surprised wagon that ever was.
An elephant called^Sandy was a regular
practical joker.'- When the Ringlings trav
eled by wagon an extra watch had to be
kept on Sandy, to keep him out of mis
chief.. He had found out that cattle out
in the country were scared to death of
him, and he used to take advantage of it
every time he cot a chance. When the
wagon train was moving . from . town to
town and he saw a bunch of steers graz

the column. Tnen he .would gather up
as much dust in his trunk as he could car

Elephants are not tralned\when they
come to this country. In India they do
not let their trained elephants out of the
country if they can help it. The animals
are too valuable. Yet they are the most
easily taught of all wild animals. Aristo
tle tells us that in ancient times elephants
were taught by their keepers to throw
stones at a mark, to cast up arms in the
air and catch them again on their fall and
to dance, not merely on the earth, but on
a rope. The first who exhibited elephant
rope-dancers was Galba at Rome. The
matter of teaching them to dance on the
ground was simple enough (by the asso
ciation of music and on a hot floor), but
we are not informed^ how they were
taught to skip the rope* or whether It was
the tight or the slack rope, or how the
rope might be. The silence of history oh
these points is fortunate for the figurantes
of the present day, since but for this their
fame might be utterly eclipsed. Elephants

an entire herd noisy with fright and a
rat will put them In a condition of des
perate fear. While it may seem odd on
the face of it. an elephant may defend
itself against a Hon. tiger or any other
natural enemy, but the Insignificant size
of a mouse baffles his conception of of
fensive and defensive warfare. The mouse
is too quick to be crushed under foot or
to be caught by his trunk and can tan

helplessness against such a diminutive foe

assistant, to make the elephant keep his
position, threw fruits into his mouth, and
often pretended to throw them without
doing so. The beast became irritated, and
as if knowing that the painter was to
blame, rather than his servant, turned to
him and dashed a quantity of water from
his trunk over the paper on which the
painter was sketching his distorted por
trait.
Last fall she stole from winter quarters
several times and made her way to To
bacconist Slegel's shop on the outskirts
of the village and literally "held him up"
for what she wanted. She broke a show
case and helped herself upon the first
call, , and thereafter the packages . were
handed out without argument. Herr Sle
gel knew if he didn't do this the angry
dame would wreck his shop, and to give,
up promptly was the lesser of two evils.
This escapade cost the Ringlings a pretty
sum, more than they fancied, and "Old
Baldy," the moral censor of the elephant
troop, was pressed Into service to reclaim
or, at least, correct the erring beast. Ho
caught Fanchon as she was leaving the
tobacco shop on her last expedition, and
nipping her ear with his trunk, he twisted
It until she cried with pain, and then pick-
Ing up a poker he belabored her all the
way back to the animal barn. Fanchon
has been on her good behavior since, for
Baldy gave her a walloping she will not
eoon forget. She cannot graft any of the
worKtnen. because smoking- amons them
is forbidden. It looks as if Fanchon would
be saved from the ravishing cigarette
habit.
The tradition that elephants are put into
a rage by tobacco is not borne out by
facts. Fanchon. a good-looking girl of
this family (ghe is about 40 and yet In her
teens, as elephants grow), really craves
tobacco, and will take anything from
round plug to Turkish cigarettes, with a
smacking relish that shows her preference
for the papered poison that dwarfs the
youth of humankind. She will even steal
to gratify this habit, and is cunning in de

There are two species of elephants, the
Ind'.an and the African. The Indian has
a concave forehead, small tusks and ears,
twenty-six teeth, five nails to the forefeet
and four to the hind feet The African
has a concave forehead, large tuEks. with
attain eight feet in length, big fan-shaped
cars, ten teeth, four claws to the fore feet
and three to the hind feet In the Ring
ing circus herd of thirty there are fine
epedmens of each. The pioneer tusk
bearer of this troop Is named "Old Baldy."
He Is famed among showmen and scien
tists, here and abroad, for Intelligence and
cbedlence. Many anecdotes are told by
his keeper, Edward Souder, to show that
he has not only mind, but a heart, and. if
tome of the menagerie men are to be
taken seriously, even a soul.
Only a few months &go a baby ele
phant was added to the big herd. She
was taken from her mother and brought
direct from Ceylon to Baraboo. After a
E*>od rest and tender care there she was
Ehlpped to the show. When placed among
thÂ© family of her kind Ehe fretted and
pined until it looked serious. The rogues
of thÂ« herd made it all the harder for
her, much as mischievous boys do with
a new comer of a boarding school. She
Â¦was chained next to Old Baldy as a last
resort. All the other elephants have
great respect fcr Baldy. He is a sort of
guide and protector and has quite as
much to do with bringing to book any
who go out of the way of right doing
es their master and trainer, Herr Sou
der.
Baldy at once began to caress the
lonesome youngster and turned fiercely
upen thoee who had picked out the baby
for a teasing mark. He divided his rice
/ with the little one, played with her and
took the young stranger completely
tinder his care. As Baldy Is boss of the
herd none dare g-o against his wishes,
and now the little one Is pet of the whole
tribe. Baldy and the v baby are insep-
Erable. The youngster has been named
"Jewel." and she Is now as serene as a
bowl of milk.
Nearly every one has noticed the friend
ly relationship that seems to exist be
tween elephants and their keepers. This
Is entirely due to the efficacy of kindness.
An elephant will resent cruelty as sure as

There is probably nobody in the .world Â»
who has a pair of ears perfectly matched.'
In most people the two differ, perceptibly
not only in shape, but also In size. Fre
quently they are not placed precisely alike
on the head. The age of a person may be
judged 'with great accuracy by. the ear**,
which after youth is past assume an,in

these telltale features will surely tell the
story of the flight of time. Then there is
the little wrinkle that comes just in front
of each ear. during the thirtiesâ a fatal
and ineradicable, sign.
Why ears should go on growing all one's
life, any-more than noses,- is a : mystery.
There are a good, many other points about
them that are instructive, their shapes be
ing markedly persistent through heredity.
An ear will be handed down,' so to speak,
from father to son for generation", after
Â¦generation with comparatively little modi
fication.''Some, authorities in criminology
assert that criminals are' very apt. to pos

nizable by an" expert in such matters.
THE systematic examination of more
. than . 40,000 pai rs of human' ears in
England and France has resulted in
'-535^ some interesting conclusions.
one thing, it is ascertained that the ear
continues to grow in the latter decades of
life; in fact, it appears never to H stop
growing until death. If one will take the
trouble to look around in: any assemblage
of people, as at church, he will discover
that the old folks have ears considerab'y
larger than those. of the, middle-aged."- A
woman who has small, shell-like ears at
20 years of age. will be very apt 'to.pos

There are two scenes In the fifth actâ
the first represents the castle where John
is.imprisoned^and he appears on the wall
loaded down' with chains and attended by
a jailer.. Here he Is visited by, Herodias,
whom he vehemently upbraids for her
wantonness. She departs in wrath.:
The second scene is a view of the in
terior of the palace, where Salome has
just completed the historic dance, which
so delights Herod that\ us a reward he
promises her anything that she may k wish,
even to the half of his kingdom. Hero
dias, filled with anger "and impelled to do"
vengeance, prompts her daughter to ask
for the head of John the' Baptist.. Herod
at . first refuses, as he admits . being
strangely fascinated by. John, ' but upon
being reproached for breaking his prom
ise' he orders the execution of the : im
prisoned exhorter.
% In the fourth act a view is given of the'
market-place in , Jerusalem where John, :
surrounded . by the ' traders, is exhorting
them, to a spiritual life and inculcating
In '.their minds the teachings of the new
creed.; He Is hidden from view by the
populace as Herod and Pontius Pilate, ap
pear^ accompanied by an escort of guards.
They decide upon the arrest of Joh*n,
who steps forward and surrenders him
self into- custody.

was only tempting ! the ' Baptist, and , is",
again restored to' his favor arid affec-?
tionV ;. .

to fall upon John's followers and destroy ;
' them' and their homes' in the lowly quar-
Iters of Tiberias if she gives* a signal. ; .

light â¢- from the window, of her apart

vehemence her offers. '
' She then threatens him with torture and
death and goes toward .the window to
draw the drapery that will permit the V
glow of light to signal -the soldiery to do
their work of-.butchery, all of which she
has explained to. the .-preacher, ' but he
stands unmoved. Just as the curtains are
drawn and a gleam of red flames flashes,
.up signifying that, the carnage has com
menced,. Herod, who has been an unob
served: witness of what has transpired] [
thrusts aside the draperies, behind which
he has been standing. Herodias cowers
at the apparition and Herod advances and
gives to John his ring which he is to use
to protect himself and his people.
When the herald of Christianity has de-.
parted " there ensues a strenuous scene.'

her by. the "throat is about to plunge the'
dagger into bosom: : But she is an
adept at diplomacy and vehemently pleads'
with him and. defies him, then proclaims
her love for 'him. v *; Â¦

opens upon Herodias,' magnificently fur

girl, to inveigle John the Baptist to ap

while Herodias, in a frenzy,', begs of him
to repent and forego . his ""teachings,; but
John refuses. During this scene -the ; . fol
lowers of the prophet have gathered in
force and. crush in the gates to the palace
yaTd. They make an' onslaught " on " the
guards, "whom they drive away, and rush
toward Herod and^ Herodias, whom they

upon the scene with John Ftanding before

Herod to such a pitch of anger and fury
that he commands that the conscientious
preacher be given over to the- tortures
until he repents. . . '.
The guard, not finding John, promises
to return. After their departure the Man
of God appears before his followers and
Is about to preach to them when they
are startled by the approach of a leper.
They etone him and cry: "Unclean, un
clean." John commands them to desist
and, going to the crouching outcast, he
Â¦rives him comfort, saying: "Never shalt.
thou be a scorn in the sight of heaven."
The Roman guards then reappear and
the captain reads to John the mandate
of Herod prohibiting him from preaching.
John sends back to the Prince his deter
mination to carry on his mission and to [
tell of him who is to come oven under the .
very gates of Herod's palace.
The second act opens upon a brilliant
aEsembly gathered in the gardens at ,
Herod Antipas. While feasting and games
are in progress the assembly denounces
John the Baptist for his treasons and his
teachings, which he Is then delivering out
side the very gates of the palace. Herod
In anger commands that he be brought
before him, but. when John appears- his
commanding presence and spiritual bear
ing captivate the Prince. He is loth to
heed the clamors of his courtiers, and
would set him free were it not that John
refuses to cease preaching. The nobles
and slaves surround him and strike him
down, and Herodias, appearing, requests
that he be turned over to her for punish
ment and torture. She, too, recognizes in
him a mysterious power which she is un
able to resist, and as her Spouse depaVts
with his court she falls' on her knees be
fore the prophet of the Messiah. She begs
that be will not denounce her and that be
exhibit mercy for her.
John tells- her that she must return to
her lawful husband and look to heaven
.for grace. He spurns her offer of affec
tion, and In the midst of this scene Herod
returns. John upbraids them both for
their sinful association, and this rouses

Invasions From Colombia.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.â The Govern
ment of Venezuela has decided to place a
report of its differences with Colombia
before the State Department at Washing
ton. Senor Eduardo Blanco, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, cables from Caracas that
President Castro has instructed him to se
cure every detail of the Invasion of Vene
zuela by Colombian troops, and draw up
a report for presentation to this Govern
ment.
There has Just been printed in Caracas
by the Government a pamphlet containing
in detail the accounts of other invasions
from Colombia since 1839. This, It Is said,
has been published to disprove the asser
tion of the Colombian Government that
two recent raids were by Venezuelan rev
olutionists and not Colombian troops.
The list published shows that since 1S53
there have been twenty-two incursions
from Colombia, and nearly all these came
from Cucuta and Invaded the State of
Tachlra. the scene of the latest attacks
on the Venezuelan frontier.
Castro's Secretary Sanguine.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 24.âPresi
dent Castro declines to give personal In
terviews with any person and whatever
statements are made the spokesman is
Dr. Torres Cardenas, the President's gen
eral secretary. The Call correspondent
had an Interview with Dr. Cardenas at
Miraflores Palace to-day In the course of
which he said:
"The situation in Venezuela Is satis
factory. The capture and immediate re
lease of General Juan Pletrl. who was ar
rested upon a charge of conspiring against
the Venezuelan Government, proved that
the administration fears nothing.
"The elections will take place In com
plete peace. The people are united." Dr.
Gardens s, speaking very gravely, con
tinued:
"The Colombian Government has not
given a satisfactory explanation of the
recent Invasions Into Venezuelan territory.
Minister Rico's - departure from Caracas
seems to condemn the conduct of the
Colombian Government Venezuela docs
not intend to Invade Colombia, which she
considers a sister nation.
Venezuela on the Defensive.
"Our army 1Â« only for defense. We
have 10,000 men on the frontier, and we
are ready to repel any invasion. Sons of
the beat and most prominent families of
Caracas dally join the army. This is
proof of the enthusiasm of the people.
Venezuela does not attribute . the recent
Invasions to the people of Colombia. These
invasions were conducted by Conserva
tives and the Clerical party In Colombiaâ
persons whom everybody hates.
"The Colombian revolution Is progress
ing dally. It will finally conquer. Mean
while we remain at shoulder arms."
France Not Interested.
PARIS, Aug. 24.â The French press has
not been giving much attention editorial
ly to the Venezuelan-Colombian question,
but what comment has been made has on
the whole been adverse to the United
States, which is accused of exaggerating
facts In order to have an excuse to Inter
vene and 6eize the Isthmus of Panama
and the canaL
The Call correspondent learned to-day
from a well-informed source that the
French Government has not yet consid
ered the contingencies which may arise If
the United States intervenes, nor has any
exchange of views with the European
chancellories on the subject taken place
or even been suggested. So far as France
i* concerned she does not contemplate

a point between Bradford's and Ken

that she was sinking rapidly, the officer
in charge backed her up to a mud
bank, as the stream is fifty feet deep in
midriver 'at that point. The Garratt re

WASHINGTON'S GOVERNOR
PARDONS "KID" WEST
Loaned to Canada as a
Witness.
Freedom for the Burglar Who Was
OLYMPIA, Wash., Aug. 24.â Governor
Rogers has pardoned "Kid" West, who is
serving a term in the penitentiary for
burglary.
"Kid'-' West while under sentence was
loaned by the authorities of Washington
to Canadian officials that they might use
him as a witness against George O'Brien,
who was accused of the murder of Linn
Relfe, Lineman Olsen and William Clay
son on the Yukon trail. There was no
precedent by which the authorities of this
State could legally turn their prisoner
over, to the- Canadians, but the problem
was discussed by prosecuting attorneys.
Judges and the Governor, with the final
outcome that they simply told the Cana
dian officials to take West and go to
Dawson with him.

proposition to him to rob people on the

should have been executed yesterday.

deck, and when the T. C. Walker came
along he took a. flying leap that landed
him in the middle of that vessel's cabin.
"Billy" is now making a temporary home
on the opposition boat.
- The Mary Garratt is a larger vessel than
the Dauntless and was laden with nearly
500 tons of grain. She is of 723 tons gross
burden, 172 feet long, 45 feet beam and 8
feet 3 inches deep. The Garratt dis
charged at Port Costa yesterday and went
back to Stockton last night.
I was not on watch at the time the col
lision occurred, and Sperry Dye had the
wheel. There were seventy-five passen
gers aboard. As soon as the Mary struck
us the ma^e, the purser and the stew
ard went the round of tho staterooms
and knocked at every door, tellinsr the
passengers to dress immediately and get
out on deck. We opened up the rack
containing the life preservers .on the
Texas deck and â¢ the officers were sta
tioned there to put them on as soon as
the passengers came forward.
"The Garratt came head-on with full
steam and struck us about amidships on
the port side, her prow going in as far
as it could and making a hole* as large
enough to drive a horse and cart into.
The Garratt was only slightly damaged,
some of the planks being smashed, but
she was not stove in. Our boats were
jrot ready to lower immediately. We
backed up on the mud-flat, but the Gar
ratt in maneuvering around to save the
passengers, crot us Â«part way off and the
boat is now on the outer edge of the
flat. The freight loss will be consider
able."
Captain Goodell refused to discuss the
auestion of blame and Captain Horace
Strother of the vÂ»arratt continued on to
San Francisco with h!s boat. It is ex-
The Dauntless was built in 1892 for the
Union Transportation Company. About
that time there was dissatisfaction on' the
San Joaquin with the California Naviga
tion Company and some of the farmers
and business men got together and built
the Captain Weber and the Dauntless.
Both vessels were of 613 tons gross bur
den, 174 feet 5 inches long, 36 feet 5 inches
beam and 8 feet deep. Captain G. H.
Goodell . has ' been commander of the
Dauntless since she went into commis
sion, and this is his first accident.
Among the crew cf the Dauntless was
"Old Billy." Everybody called him the
"boatswain." and there certainly never
was a sailorman who could load a band
of sheep aboard a river steamer as quick
ly as "Billy." Although on the ship's
articles as one of the crew, "Billy" Is a
sheep. He saved his life by his own pres
ence of mind. When all hands on the
Dauntless were looking after their own
affairs "Billy" was looking after his.
Wet and miserable he stood on the Texas

"I don't believe the correct number of
lost will ever be known. There were a
number of stowaways aboard and with the
little-kr.own members of the crevr and sev
eral unknown passengers who paid their
fares I believe the number of the lost is
almost double that now given out as cor-'
rect."
Learning that they were being watched.
Gates and his child-wife left the train,
took a hack and were driven to South
Tacoma. where the Northern Pacific lim
ited train was held ten minutes for them.
Here Gates escaped arrest a second time.
The police in South Tacoma were asked
by telephone to arrest him. but the tele
phone wires were working badly and be
fore they could get instructions from' po
lice headquarters the train had 'departed.
Mrs. Boyle is greatly wrought up over
the affair and it is claimed that charges
of bigamy and perjury may follow that
of kidnaping. v
raft was overloaded and a number of per
sons went into the Jtvater before we could
get it righted. On the same raft with me
was Pilot Le. Blonde and Simpson. They
were saved.
As near as can be learned they went to
Chehalis about a week ago and were
married. They kept this fact secret and
only diligent watching made it plain as
late as Thursday that they were prepar
ing to leave together. The girl's mother
tried unsuccessfully to detain her after
she had reached the depot. A police-,
man was then sought and requested to
arrest Gates. This was impossible at the
moment, because the officer was called
upon to arrest another man who turned
out to be a horse thief.
Gates came out from Dawson in July
and has been having a gay time in Seat
tle and Tacoma since then. On reaching
Tacoma several weeks ago he found that
his niece, Lydia, and her parents had
moved to this city. He visited them fre-
Quently and soon showed much fondness
for the girl. Her mother, who is Gates'
own sister, sought to discourage any inti
macy between them, but "Swiftwater
Bill" doled out so many alluring tales
that the child was quickly won to his
way of thinking.
This Is the third time Gates has been
married | since he was lucky enough to
make a small fortune from his Klondike
claims. His first wife was Grace La
moore, a San Francisco girl who posed as
a variety actress in Dawson. She ob
tained a divorce from him In San Fran
cisco the following year, his second wife,
another of the Lamoore sisters, is report
ed to be dangerously ill in either New
York or Washington. Her child is being
cared for by her mother in Dawson and
Gates is said to pay something toward Its
support-.

Hesser was disarmed by bystanders and
turned over to Officer Chandler, who
rushed In as soon as the shot was fired.
He waa taken to jail, where later he de
clared that he did not know a single thing
that had happened from the time he was
talking to the proprietor of the saloon
until he was landed in jail.
Pollerano was carried to a physician's
office, where he remained in a comatose
condition until near midnight, when he
passed away.
The bullet struck Pollerano in the side
of the head, about two inches above the
left eye, and while one portion of It cir
cled about the skull the second portion
penetrated the brain and was not located.
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 24.â Rels Pollerano
was shot and killed to-night in the Tele
phone saloon by William G. Hesser,
There waa no provocation and the mur
derer claims he did not know what he
was doing. Hesser. has been living on a
ranch in the New River country, but has
been in San Diego on a spree for several
weeka. This evening he was sitting at
the rear end of the saloon when Pollerano
and two companions, both Mexicans,
came in to get a drink. They were at
the front of the saloon when Hesser sud
denly got up from his chair, drew his re
volver ** and fired. One witness asserts
that Hesser said something about seeing
what he could hit, while others assert
that not a word was uttered when the
shot was fired.

SEATTLE, Aug. 24.â One of the arrivals
frcm the north today was &t. G. Greene,
a member of the Northwest Mounted Po
lice, who was a passenger on th? Inlander
and who saw Captain Foote sink. He
does not hesitate to blame the officers of
the vessel for the disaster.
The estimate of treasure on the Islander
ranges from S22S.000 to S2.0u0.000. while in
some quarters thf> steamer is said to have
had one of the largest consignments of
sold yet brought out. Possibly the exact
amount will never be known, as a num
ber of individual fortunes wore lost. Con
stable Joyce of the Mounted Police, who
has been stationed at Dawscn, says there
were four boxes of bank gold containing
350 pounds each, or u total of 1400 pounds.
Kstimatinj? it rougrhly at J203 per. pound,
this would bring the amount up to $2S0.
<W0. Then there were individual amounts,
such as that of Mr. ijart. some of which
had been ccrsigrr.eu vo the care cf the
Mr. Hart ss.Sd that his grip con
fiiined $33,009 and he un<iers:ood that one
of the unfortunates who was drowned
had an equal amount. Probably the
treasure of th? steamer amounted to
more than ?400.Â«>0.
Mrs. Minnie Ross, whose body has been
brought down, was from Los Angeles,
whither she and her husband, who had
kept a boarding house on Hunker, were
bound. When the accident occurred both
j-emained with the ship until she was
sinking. They stood together, Mr. Ross
says, on the stern of the vessel until the
water rose to their feet, and then they
stepped hand in hand off into the sea.
Both had on life preservers, and would
In all probability have been saved had it
not been for the explosion. They went
under water as the explosion occurred.
Â¦\Vhen Sir. Ross came to the surface he
called loudly for his wife, but he never
saw her again. He subsequently climbed
onto a piece of wreckage from which a
boat afterward rescued him. He is a. man
SS or 40 years ct age, and his wife was
fibout the same age. They had no chil
dren.
VICTORIA. B. C. Aug. 24.â The ap
pearance of the bodies of the Islander
victims who have been brought to Vic
toria and the fact that they were picked
up shortly after the accident elves rise
to a new theory regarding the cause of
death In their cases. Even' one of the
bodies brought liere bears bruises about
the face and head, even the Infant vic
tims being thus marked. It is not un
likely that, when the explosion to which
each frequent reference has been made
occurred, parts o"f the house and super
structure struck the passengers, fatally
injuring or killing- them. A. C. Beach,
one of the survivors, tells of having been
struck by a piece of wreckage which
made an ugly gash in his throat, -while
â¢-hose w_o picked up Dr. Duncan say
_-.iat the blood was still flowing from his
-*Vmple when the body was recovered. A
local medical man says that this ex
plains the fact that the bodies floated,
as the lungs would be full of air instead
of water, which would be the case where
passengers were drowned. Those who
were drowned, he said, would not rise
to quickly to the surface.

"Judge Updyke was the only official in
that part of the country." said Mr. Barnes
to a Nome reporter, "and I handed the
bottle over to him to give to the Naviga

have drifted there a short time before I

VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 25.â News was
received to-night of the discovery of a
ship's medicine bottle at Bristol Bay
which tells of a tragedy of the northern
seas dating back twenty-one years.
Harry Barnes, a prospector ; who has ar
rived at Cape Nome on the schooner Bear
from a trip to the Kuskokwlm district,
was the finder of the message of death. He
picked up the bottle, which was tightly
corked, on the sandspit on Hagenmeister
Island, in the north part of Bristol Bay.
Believing that it might contain something
of value he opened It and found a single
sheet of paper, on which, in faded Ink and
apparently hastily written, were these
words:'

Two blocks south of St. Mary's. Church
and nearly on a line with it on New York

for an opening at the theater. Two lions
that are used In the play, were in cages
on the stage when a sudden 1 rush of wind
made the building tremble. Warning
cries' caused the performers to leave the
stage not a moment too' soon. Bricks
came down from the high walls,' rulnlnK

The lions roared in terror. As the per
formers rushed out a shout was raised
in the street that the lions were loose

In the corridor fled panic-stricken The
lions did not escape, but, their cages were
hit and. the: beasts were cut by the

At 3:30 o'clock Jersey City began to ex

Blasts of wind carried widespread de

in the neighborhood of Newark avenue
and Barrow street, and a cyclonic condi
tion resulted. Horses standing in , New
ark avenue and the wagons to which
they were hitched were blown over.
Telegraph poles and wires fell.' A mo
ment or two later the steeple of St.

On board, the Erin, as guests of the
Shamrock's owner, were Lieutenant Col
onel Burbank and' his daughters and sev
eral other officers. Captain Sycamore and
Navigator Hamilton Â¦' also saw the race
from the Erin. The former laughingly
said to the newspaper man:
"The weather was bad for racing and I
think the Constitution did the right thing
in stopping when she. did. In that thick
weather there was no use taking chances
of an accident, either of collision or of
running aground. : â¢ Our . yachts on both
sides of the water have had experiences
enough of that, kind." Sir. Thomas re
frained from saying anything regarding
the merits of either the Columbia or the
Constitution. Â¦ - - Â¦ â¢ â¢ Â¦
NEW YORK, -Aug. 24.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton, when seen; by an Associated Press
representative after the race, said: Â¦ -.
Sir Thomas Talks.
When the accident occurred she was
ahead of the Constitution in the weather
berth, and it is the general opinion that
she would have beaten the new boat had
she not been obliged to luff into the wind
for more than five minutes. However, the
performance of the Constitution on that
day was a grand one. The wind blew to
twenty-four knots at times, and she took
the heavy seas and hard puffs, even with
a club topsail aloft, in admirable style.
The first race, cn July 1, was won by the
Columbia in a ten-knot southwester. On
July 3 the Columbia became disabled three
miles from the start, when she. had a lead,
and the Constitution refused to take a
walkover. On July 6 and 8, in very light
airs, at no time blowing over six knots
and most of the time under four, the Con
stitution showed up in wonderful fprm
and gave the old boat two decisive beat
ings.
On the" 10th of July the Constitution
started, but soon withdrew on account of
the. thick fog. The Columbia and Inde
pendence went over the. course, however,
unable to finish within the time limit. On
July-H and '12 the Columbia won two vic
tories, one in a nine-knot southwester and
the other in .. a . fresh i northeaster. Then
came the races during the cruise of the
.New York Yacht Club in the light breezes
of the Sound. The Constitution took three
Â¦ to" the Columbia's' >6ne. ' On July 14 the
Columbia took the Astor cud on the
Newport course in handsome style, and
the Constitution went to Bristol to change
her rig. her managers not being satisfied
with her performances. They next came
together on August 10 in the hard race al
ready mentioned. On August 13 the Co
lumbia won on time allowance in a very
close finish in a light and fluky wind. They
.started -.August 14 in a light breeze on a
windward and leeward course. The wind
fell flat and after-.four hours of drifting
both withdrew, being then on even terms.
Then came the light air Larchmont races
in. the Sound .on. August 16 and 17, which
the Constitution took, one by a large mar
gin and the other by only fifty-eight sec
onds. The two boats came to Seawanhaka
course Thursday and -the decisive victory
of the Columbia is still fresh in the minds
of the yachtsmen. To-day's race, the last
of the long preliminary series, tells its own
story. . â¢â¢ -. Â¦ ...-â¢'
Beginning on July 21 the two candidates
for the honor. of defending the cup have
made nineteen starts. Out of these there
have been sixteen finishedâ an unusually
large number. The Constitution has won
eight and the Columbia eight. But these
figures, taken a.lone, do not quite repre
sent the respective merits of the two boats
as shown. by ..ne contests already sailed.
A brief review of the results shows that
the Constitution has showed superiority
in light breezes and smooth seas only. The
Columbia has never been beaten In any
thing like a strong and true wind. with one
exception, which was on August 10 off
Newport, when she suffered a mishap in a
hard hammer to windward in the strong
est breeze of the whole series. .
To-day's race marks the, finish of the
preliminary or tuning up series between
the Constitution and the Columbia. They
now come to the-trial races off Newport;
under the auspices of the -New York
Yacht Club. The boat winning two of the
three races, | provided there has been" a
fair test of speed in average cup condi
tions.-will undoubtedly ber selected by the
America's* cup committee to sail in the
international races against the Shamrock
II.
Â¦ -v Columbia First on Form. â¢ <
After sailing once around the triangular
course of the Seawanhaka Club, with the
Columbia ' forty-seven seconds a winner,
having gained on every leg, both boats
ran Into a terrific rain, squall. They
groped about for some time In the down
pour and shifting breezes, hardly able to
see two lengths ahead. Atlast the weath
er cleared a bit. â¢ The Columbia picked up
the mark and stood for it.;. The Constitu
tion, however, had already withdrawn,
and having sent down her big topsail was
headed for Oyster . Bay. The Columbia
kept on, finished the race and won the
CUp. ...'"..Â¦Â¦ Â¦. . :.Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦

Precedent Established for the
Payment of Police
Pensions.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that the Police Pension Fund Commis
sion must pay the $1000 death benefit to
direct heirs of deceased officers who havÂ»
served faithfully for more than ten
years, even though such members of the
department may have been retired from
active service. The test cajse was
brought by Annie Kavanagh, widow of
John Kavanagh, who served for twenty
years on the police force of this city.
The claim was brought under the police
pension fund act of 1SS9 as amended in
1891. which says, "Whenever any member
of the Police Department of such county,
city and county or town and county,
shall, after ten years' service, die from
natural causes, then his widow or chil
dren or if there be no widow or children,
then his mother or unmarried sisters
shall be entitled to $1000 from such fund."
The commission maintained that as Kav
anagh was on the retired list he was not
a member of the department.
It was shown- by the claimant that
Kavanagh had served faithfully and hail
been retired In accordance with legal re
quirements. The Supreme Court re
viewed the act creating the fund and
shewed that from Its language there
could be no doubt that a retired officer
still retained membership In the depart
ment, even though he might not be in
active service. . -i :Â¦" Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Until another amendment Is mad*
therefor, heirs of deceased retired offi
cers have eaual claims with heirs of
members of the department who die in
active service. -Â¦
Cuba's Tobacco Industry Safe.
HAVANA. Aug. 24.-Gustave Beck in
the course of a report to the Clgarmakers*
Union regarding the outlook of the cigar
and tobacco industry, expresses the opin
ion that there is no danger to be appre
hended from American competition, so far
as Cuban cigars are concerned. He takes
the ground that, even if Cuba sent all her
cigars to the United Statesâ and she pro
duced 200,000.000 last yearâ this could not
seriously affect the American producers
and manufacturers, who last year sold
5 500 000,000 cigars in the United States.

The Columbus Loan and Savings So
ciety has increased its capital stock from
tS2,C00 to J2.Xi.000. The purpose of this is
to enlarge its latitude for the placing of
loans. Realty, State, national and mu
nicipal bonds were the only securities that
could be accepted by a savings bank that
had a capital stock of less than $100,000,
under the State law as amended by the
California Legislature at its last session
Formerly the limit of capital stock that
enabled a savings bank to invest in other
securities was $300,000. Real estate de
mands only a Bmall part of the money
that the banks have been rapidly accum
ulating during the last few years In Cal
ifornia.
S. E. Tooker, the mining operator, has
just completed and moved into his .two

A petition is being circulated and signed
by ail the residents of the Sunset dis
trict asking the Market Street Railroad
Company for an extension of the electric
car line now running to the Affliated Col
leges on J street to Ninth avenue, thence
sonth on said avenue to JC street. It would
be a feeder to the main line and a great
benefit to the hundreds of people in the
district. The improvements made and
residences built in the last year warrant
it.

Berkeley Is Booming. . ; *J
Berkeley Is having a building boom that
has been improving verious sections. Re
cent activity has been largely manifested
at North Berkeley, or Berryman. In the
last few months there have been extensive
street improvements under way from Lor
in to Berryman. These have been fol
lowed by the extension of the building
area. In some sections houses are rented
for long periods before they are com
pleted, and the tendency is upward for
rents. Real estate dealers have flocked
into the university town, and their signs
and placards ara to be seen in all direc
tions. The north end of Berkeley has
been benefited greatly by the extension of
the line of the Telegraph avenue electric
road, which runs up Spruce street and
down' Oxford on a loop. This has prac
tically placed the section, that was former
ly isolated, in immediate touch with Oak
land and San Francisco. Formerly the
dwellers In North Berkeley were com
pelled to rely upon the local trains of the
Southern Pacific Company for passage to
this city. During a part of the day and
at night these trains from Berkeley run
only hourly. This was a disadvantage
that the beauty of the high hills and the
salubrity of the climate were not suffi
cient to overcome. The electric road has
now conferred upon the north end of
Berkeley that T/hich it needed to make it
popular. Several very fine residences are
planned to be erected in the near future.
Meanwhile the street Improvements are
going ahead on a large scale. ' Spruce
street, which is the continuation of the
county- Toad -that leads in from the hills
of Contra Costa County, is about to be
paved, and the creek that has been fished
over and hunted over for many years is
about to be spanned with a costly bridge;

The question of giving a bonus is one that has
been argued since the very first days of letting
work Â¦ by - contract.' If ' an owner is very par
ticular to insert in a document that: the con
tractor shall forfeit so much per diem for every
day the contractor shall exceed a certain date
to have I the structure completely finished why
ought not the same owner be willing to allow
a bonus if the work' is- done ahead , of time?
Take a large brick building,- for instance: -- The
contractor, by using Improved methods â¢. and
adopting the very latest ideas in regard to dis
tributing materials at different stages ' of the
work, may have the building ready for occu
pancy a full month before the data set for, com
pletion. If the building be rented or occupied
by the owner a" saving in rent alone would
amount probably to ?1000. "- Then why notglve
a goodly portion of this amount i to the con
tractor for performing his work in a faithful
manner? Of course the other side will-argu*
that the work could not have been done as well
as if a greater time had been taken. But, in
these ' days , of lynx-eyed .architects,' that is a
fallacy not worth arguing. Try the bonus plan
a- little more frequently and note the . general
happiness all around of those who work on a
building.- The owner gives a bonus to the con
tractor and the latter, "divvies" with his work
men, v ?-â¢Â¦ ;â¢>.':â¢ :..?;'"';"Â¦;
pany. The structure will cost something
over $100,000 and must be completed, un
der the terms of the contracts, by April 1,
1902.. In the contracts isÂ» a clause which
has _ already occasioned some* discussion
and Is destined to incite more. This pro
vides that a bonus of $20 per day shall be
paid to the contractor for evefy.day that
he lessens the prescribed period of con
struction, and rhat a penalty of $100 shall
be paid by the contractor for every day
after, the contract time that the building
is incomplete. The Building News and
Review takes up the cudgel- in favor of
the bonus and says:
. A contract was recently let in Los An

A novel way of opening a package of
food is shown on the Grape-Nuts pack-
age, where a line Indicates that a slit
ehould be made with a knife, and the
package squeezed, which makes it gap
enough to pour out what is needed for a
meal, then the package automatically
closes, preserving, the contents from the
moisture of the air.
As a rule. Grape-Nuts packages are not
kept on hand very long in any family, but
v It is v.-ell to know how to keep the contents
of the package in prime condition. Grape-
Nuts Food is ready cooked, very crisp,
v and can be served immediately with a lit-
tle rood cream or milk. This feature Is
ef great advantage to those I who appre-
ciate ease and convenience in preparing
breakfast. . '

COAL OILâ A. H. L., City. Who first
discovered coal oil in the United States
Is a question that " cannot be answered
with posltivenessi for the discovery of
such oil has been traced to several locali
ties and persons. As early as 1832 oil was
noticed floating on the surface of a well
near .Titusvllle, Pa. This was collected
and used for medicinal purposes. In 1853
a Dr. Brewer suggested that such oil be
used for illuminating; also for lubricat
ing purposes. ' In 1858-9 Colonel E. L.
Drake of New Haven, Conn., investigated
the oil region and sank a well j on Oil
Creek at Titusvllle, and on ' the 26th of
August, 1859, was rewarded by! "striking
oil." the product of that well being from
400 to 1000 gallons a day. The first flowing
well was struck that year in that region
and it produced from 800 to 1000. barrels a
day. .

MAZUZAâ Joseph Siebel of this city
furnishes the following in relation to what
a mazuza is and it is a fuller answer than
was given recently in this department:
"The mazuza contains In Hebrew charac
ters verses from the Holy Bible, viz.,
Deuteronomy vt:4-9, also same book xi:
13-21. On the outside appears the Hebrew
word Shaddai (Almighty). The mazuza is
known In America as well as In Europe
and other parts of the world. In Jewish
houses it is nailed to the upper right hand
of a door frameâ that is, the right hand
on entering of any door in the house. On
passing a mazuza a Jew has to touch the
same with his right hand and express in
Hebrew a supplication, as 'May the Al
mighty keep me from doing evil' or 'pro
tect me from evil desire.' "

WE are fallen now upon the drab
days of criticism, a grudging,
thin-lipped fashion of praise, a
split-strawed, sublimated, Hen
ry James' way of judgment.
Listen to a lovely old Irish critic on the
subject of Sarah Siddons, in the Dublin
Journal, more than a hundred years ago,
and acknowledge that the rascal's beau
tiful brogue, glorious extravagance and
sumptuous bulls are infinitely better
reading than the criticisms of the aver
age impassionate paragrapher of to-day.
Here he is:
Yesterday Mrs. Siddons, about whom all the
world has been talking, posed her beautiful,
adamantine, eoft and lovely person for the
first time in the Theater Royal. Emock alley,
in the bewitching, meltnur and all-tearful
character of Isabella. From the repeated
panegyrics in the London papers we were
taught to expect the sight of a heavenly an
gdj but how were we eupernaturally surpris
ed Into the most awful joy in beholding an
earthly eoddess. The hcuse was crowded with
hundreds more than It could hold (!) with
thousands of admiring spectators who went
away without a eight. This extraordinary
phenomenon of tragic excellence, this star of
Melpomene, this comet of the stage, this sun
of the firmament of the Muses, this moon of
blank verse, this queen and princess of tears,
exceeded expectations, went beyond belief and
soared above all powers of description. She
was nature itself; she Is the most exquisite
work of art; in short, she was the bouquet of
Parnassus. Sexeral persons fainted before the
curtain went up, but when ebe came to the |
scene of parting with her wedding ring, oh,
what u eight was there! The very orchestra
"albeit unused to the melting mood," wept
like hungry children. Nature sure. In one of
her beautiful moments, in one of her humane
leisure hours, in one of her smiling days. In
one of her weeping months, made this acme
of perfection. Oh. happy HIbernia! blessed
Isle, what bright excellence of excellence
stands on the turf of thy fruitful earth.
COINAGE STOPPED-I. S. L.. City.
The coinage of two and a half dollar
pieces of the United States was discon-
Truly, like a rew Arabian night's enter
tainment It reads, and the tour was
crowned by the presentation of a farewell
address (In a silver casket) to this rejected
and despised member of the American
stage from all the theatrical managers in
Bombay. There should be a moral in this
etory, that' you may have if you can find.
Like the small boy with a certain minis
ter's tales, I myself like best stories that
have no morals. Perhaps you do.
Edmund Russell is the man's name, and
by a Hindoo paper that I have before m<S
now, an Indian Advocate of last Juno,
Russell seems to have attained both his
desires. He plays Hamlet, Romeo and
Macbeth, and according to Mr. Baliwala,
the "Irving of India," is the "finest actor
that has ever visited India." How much
that Is saying I cannot vouch for, but as
Russell is now probably somewhere In
Australia or the Sandwich Islands and
will presumably pass through here on the
completion of his leisurely tour of the
world we may have early opportunity of
judging. He has quite evidently been
taken very seriously in India, the de
scription of his progress through the
country reading like an Oriental fairy
tale in the magnificence of its attendant
circumstances. Princes, rajahs, royal
highnesses, gaikwars and every kind of
Hindoo royalty has done him honor, load-
Ing him with jewels, sacred robes, ivories
and such like.' Even queens and their
veiled ladies have looked upon his Ham
let from their latticed balconies, and Ilia
priests in the temples have covered him
with gifts and flowers. Nautch girls have
danced for him, elephants fought for his
amusement, actors have acted for himâ
"Sakuntala." the great epic of India, s.ti'1
played with boys in the women's parts
as in Shakespeare's time with usâ and
theatrical managers have hung upon his
lips as he lectured on the future of the
Hindoo drama. He seems indeed to have
left behind him both a thorough liking
and respect and to have brought away,
what must now be almost that perfect
collection of gems that he planned to
make. Here are a few of them, just for
the sake of the plcturesqueness of the
thing. His Highness, the Galkwar of
Baroda, presented the actor with "a
Prince's choga and a magnificent neck
lace of ancient workmanship, in enamel
set with diamonds and rubies and strung
with pearls and pendant emeralds."
The Nawab of Junagadh's gift was a
turban pendant, in catseyes, pearls, dia
monds and sapphires. The Maharajah of
Kashmir gave a superb Kashmir shawl,
and his brother Rajah, Sir Amar Singh
("whose beauty and culture are unequaled
among the Princes of India"), his portrait
set in a splendid piece of Kashmirett lac
quer. The Rajah Ravi Vamlr of Agra,
where is the wonderful Taj, gave some
exquisite wines, a girdle of the incanta
tions of Buddha worn by the Grand La
ma of Thibet, a great turquoise carved
with a figure of Ganesh and a girdle clasp
of black jade set with jewels made from
the handle of a dagger of the time of
Akbar.
critics, who accused him of every sin in
the artistic decalogue, and it further kept
him steadily to his purpose. This man
had other and curious "" claims to consid
eration. He had a collection, of jewels,
rare, quaint and rich gems, that was said
to equal even that of Sarah .Bernhardt.
He used to pose in these, -with the delight
of a woman in that kind of beauty, and
this collection, its perfecting, was his aec
ond ambition.
Â¦ The league can do this. It says "the trusts ride rough-shod over the people." There
ought, then, to be marks enough left to identify the culprit, and evidence to convict the rough
shod rider should not be wanting. Therefore will the league cease to talk nonsense and do
something? . â¢ â¢ . . -
It is notoriously in the power of any citizen to lodge in a Federal court an information
which will begin such a suit. The prosecuting witness need not be even a member of the Anti-
Trust League, nor belong to the platform committee of the conventions, Democratic, Republican
or Populist, which are now engaged in racing against each other for hard words in which to de
nounce trusts. Of course it would look better if some such person would back up his zeal' in
language by substantial action, but so far none has offered.
If the league know of the existence, of the evidence for" which it wants a reward offered,
its duty is to bring that evidence to the attention of the Attorney General ,by bringing suit in any
Federal court, or before any Federal Court Commissioner. When such suit is docketed the De
partment of Justice has jurisdiction of its prosecution, and the intention of the Attorney General
to enforce the law will be made known through the use he makes of the evidence in the case.
That is'so well calculated to muddle' the issue that one is at a loss to decide whether it is the
result of ignorance or design. The Attorney General is a Cabinet officer, the head of a department
which has for expenditure only such funds and for such purposes as Congress may appropriate.
It .should be known to the Anti-Trust League that the. Attorney General has no authority to offer
any reward for a drag net expedition to find testimony in a case that has no existence. If he did
this he would be subject to impeachment for unlawfully using the funds of his department. There
are many Federal statutes besides the one on trusts. He has no more authority to : offer a reward
for evidence of the violation of one. than of another. It is. ; therefore, whimsical or worse for the
league to propose that the Attorney General shall violate the law -himself "to get evidence on
which to begin a case against, other violators of the law. Â¦
. None of the volunteer doctors of the trust evil has ventured to puf in complete form a bill
for an act of legislation which medicates the v malady. They prefer to inflame partisan activity by
torrid denunciation. The last letter of the Anti-Trust League to the Attorney General is of this
class of matter. It says: "We will now give him (the Attorney General) an opportunity to reas
sure the people as to his desire and intention to enforce the law against trusts. Will Attorney Gen
eral Knox offer a reward for the production 'of the incriminating, evidence against the trust for
which we asked, and he says he does not possess? Will he announce to-morrow that the
Department of Justice of the United ' States will pay a substantial reward to any person or persons
who will produce evidence that will lead to the arrest and conviction of any person or corporation
guilty of violating the Federal statute against trusts?"
It is in the interest of the people and of 'our national commerce that the trustquestion be cir
cumnavigated by the courts. If these combinations are only evil they should be judicially abolished,
killed dead. If they are a mixture of good and evil the evil in them should be judicially restrained
and the good encouraged. But neither will be done by political platforms and irrelevant discus
sion. The public mind is not enlightened by these and therefore has no light to cast upon legis
lation, to be enforced -by the courts.
CORRESPONDENCE has passed between the Anti-Trust League and the Attorney Gen
eral of the United States.
The league seems to be -very much dissatisfied with the result of the interchange,
and indulges in personal charges against the Cabinet officer, . intended to impeach his
enforcement of the law.
' Finally, the league makes a proposition which partakes of the unfortunate character of
most of the anti-trust political talk.
PERSONAL MENTION.
The "Mefistofele" I can answer for aa
a surprisingly good performance. It is
one of the features of the season and has
very apparently been more fully rehearsed
and carefully directed than la commonly
practicable in the Tivoli productions.
Our own operas this week, to leave the
sublime for the local, have been Rossini's
merry masterpiece. "The Barber of Se
ville," and Boito's "Mefistofele." I hear
that the "Barber" was good as usual,
with the same cast as last year, and that
the hit of the performance was Russo
and.Repetto's naive rendering in English
of "Because I Love You" in the "singing
lessW scene. . v
There is much ado in Bayreuth just now
about the new Munich theater, the Prinz
Regent, that has been built with a view
to giving the Wagner operas in their per
fection exactly as they are given at Bay
reuth. The plan naturally meets with
some opposition at Bayreuth, that the un
kind Munich folk allege is not so much
concern for the purity Â¦ of Wagnerian art
as concern for Wagnerian dollars that
will naturally flow Munlchward If people
can get as good performance as at Bay
reuth for half the price. Bayreuth's art
has been a myth to the middle classes,
say the Munich people, and the Bayreuth
aristocrats \ would . keep it so. At any
rate the new theater has been officially
inspected by Prinz Regent Luitpold and
accepted. Ernest v., Poasart will be mu
sikdirector, and the theater opened on
Thursday last, two days after the closing
of the Bayreuth festival. " "Â¦>'.â¢
"Parsifal" has also been heard and
criticized, and our 'favorite, Van Dyck,
was said to be in brilliant voice through
out his rendering of the name role. His
exceptional histrionic abilities are also
awarded a high meed of praise, and only
a poor German pronunciation unfavorably
criticized. â -~
THE accounts from Bayreuth are
beginning to come In, with the
usual rhapsodies and enthusiasms
only explicable to those fortunate
enough to have been there. Otto
Floersheim of ; the Courier thlsweek
treats his readers to an epic of enthusi
asm concerning the "Flying Dutchman'
that this year opened;the season Gen
eral Musikdirector Mottl conducted and
to the performance from. a purely musi
cal standpoint,. save for a certain slow
ness of tempi, Mr. Floershelm^accorjs
"unalloyed praise." Mme. Schumann-
Helnk is the I only singer in the cast lo
cally known, and. of course, sang Mary s
part, and again, of course, admirably.
Van Rooy sang the title -role, and he
must bo a wonder from the accounts.
Miss Emily Destlnn of Berlin was the
Senta. and she is highly praised â¢ both
from the histrionic and vocal standpoint.
The Erik seems not to have been so suc
cessfully undertaken by Burgstaller, who
was -over-vehement in the part.. Peter
Heidkamp from Cologne . sang Daland s
part, to the full as well as Van Rooy
sang the Dutchman, says Mr. Floersheim.
The "Ring" has also been given, with
Herr'Hans Richter conducting, and with
a splendid "Die Walkure" and a poor
"Siegfried," says the Concert-Goer's critic.
As "Siegfried" is mostly Siegfried it may
have been -comparatively poor, but as
the same critic acknowledges that the
"scenery was splendid; Frledrichs as
Alberich was splendid; Frl. Feuge-Gleiss
as Brunnhilde excellent; Bertram as
"Wanderer and Schumann-Heink sufficing
to' raise the -first two acts above total
failure,'.' it Is possible we might have
found it bearable. Schmedes was the
Siegfried and Breuer. Mme. Bertram's
Wotan seems to have made a. profound
impression.
Dado sings the title role very satisfac
torily, looks the part very handsomely,
but lacks largely on the dramatic side.
His defiance to the heavenly powers In the
first act Is unpardonably tame â perhaps
owing to a somewhat precarious position
on a sort of jaunting, car of a cloud where
he is perched. He is wanting entirely, too,
in the splendid mischief that made Plan
con's Mephisto such a marvelous affair,
that even ! Nicolini'3 devil was not found
wanting in. But he sings his "whistling
song" splendidly, and is always safe
vocally. Montanari's Marguerite is good,
and had she wisely confined herself to
roles like this would have been even bet
ter. .But her voice has suffered from the
strain of heavy dramatic roles that do not
come within her vocal domain, and It Is a
pity, for it is a very sweet, pure, round
quality that ' she' has.. Agostlnl Is the
Faust, and though it is not so fine as his
Ferdinand.' is yet a very pleasing perform
ance. His. voice is notably .free from the
"bleat" of so many Italian tenors! "U
Trovatore"- will be the other, bill' of the
coming week, with Salassa, who is bad
ly cast as the Count dl Luna, Collamarlnl
as Azucena, a fine : performance. Bar bar
eschi in one of her best parts aa Leonora,
and Russo as her miniature but vocally
sufficient lover.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
"Meflstofele" is. much nobler In scope
than . the Gounod edition of the story.
"Faust" ha3 4 in It dramatic thrill and
easy tunefulness, and one truly misses in
"Meflstofele" the "King of Thule," thÂ»
"Calf of Gold," the "Soldiers* Chorus" and
the "Cavatina." But "Faust" is Goethe
Gallicised, popularized,- metamorphosed,
but in no sense Interpreted, which is Just
where Boito comes in. That the Italian
composer dared to produce his "Meflsto
fele" not ten years after the Gounod opera
shows that he was very fully persuaded of
its vital significance and radical difference
from the first setting of the opera. ThÂ»
work has all the broad reach and high
imaginative qualities of Goethe's poem,
and is also* original and beautiful from a
musical standpoint. That the composer
did not always attain his high end is not
to be wondered at, but "Meflstofele" re
mains one of the most Important works
of the Italian school. It reminds much of
Berlioz in places, and the thinness of thÂ»
Tivoli orchestra was sometimes unpleas
antly apparent in its interpretation there
fore. One needs an orchestra of sixty In
stead of sixteen, to get all the tone-color
possible, six harps instead of onÂ« for thÂ«
celestial chorus, and so on. Still, It is all
the more creditable to the house with Its
limited resources to have given bo good a
performance, and one is very glad to get
It even so.
Then the staging, barring a bars and un
comfortable paradise In the . first actâ tn
alarming contrast -to the spruce and welt
furnished mansion of the Greek blend that
later appears, be it' notedâ Is much mora
elaborate than one has any right to ex
pfcct at the price. The Brocken scene la
a really excellent bit of stage manage
ment, a fine. picture, well lighted, cos
tumed and grouped. So, also, is the Greek
heaven aforesaid, and the chorus in the
market scene gets quite a respectable dis
tance from Its usual indifferent pose. It
has also been trained iiito a real dramatic
effectiveness in the Brocken scene, where
Faust and Mephisto go wandering around
the picture in a quite "Wagnerlan fashion.
It is to.be conceived that even the chorus
enjoys a novelty, and certainly in "Mefls
tofele" there is' admirable material for
their appreciation. The orchestra also
plays a noble part, and Mr. Stelndortt has
done more than well in hia work with thÂ»
opera. The management has wisely de
cided to keep !t in the bill another week.

Within the next thirty days work will
begin on a large scale on the Plcacho
group of mines on the Colorado River, in
the eastern" part of San Diego County.
There are twenty-seven claims In the
group, that have passed by purchase to
the California King Gold Mines Company.
This company is reported â¢ to have paid
$2,000,000 for the Dorseyand Janes estate
groupa. John P. Jones Is the president of
the company. The mines are forty miles
above Yuma, on the California side of the
river, and are located in what is known
as the White Gold basin. I On the. bank
of the Colorado a 600-ton cyanide plant
will be erected. Eventually. 1000 men will
be employed by the company. The opera
tions will be the most extensive of any
ever conducted on the desert. '
The late storm on Humbug Creek, says
the Yreka Journal, has supplied that
creek with a good body of water, which
still holds out. The cloudbursts made
more. water in the creek than was there
at any time during the winter, and had
the miners expected it they would have
been prepared to work placer claims | for
nearly, a month more. The sluices were
not prepared and the hands had all been
discharged until the winter season.
Water Runs to Waste.
State Mineralogist Aubury gives notice
that the employment department of the
State Mining Bureau will be open about
September 1. Mine owners are requested
to correspond with the bureau when they
need any kind. of labor for the mines,
which will be furnished. The bureau will
make no charge. Those who desire em
ployment in the mines are requested to
register and furnish the necessary Infor
mation concerning capability and expe
rience. The department is for the benefit
of those only .who have the necessary
mining experience to qualify them.
If one may judge by the many prospecting
parties coming and going over the trails of

Prospectors, according to the Calaveras
paper, are now In all the old workings
near Highland Lakes, twelve miles from
Silver Mountain, and in Green Rock,
farther south. A successful run Is re
ported to have been recently made in Al

Mogul Makes Strike.
The Calaveras Chronicle reports that a
strike has been made in the Mogul dis
trict. A prospector sank a shaft under an
old coal mine not far from Boulder Hill
The Amador Ledger says that. 150 men
are employed at the Oneida mine. The
sixty-stamp mill crushes 300 tons per day
and. the yield is reported to be about $3 50
per ton, which would give a product of
over $30,000 per month in free gold. The
company will soon erect sulphide works.
Negotiations are progressing for the sale
of the Defender mine to W. M. Gwin. A
new corporation has been formed to run
the Horn gold mine in the Pioneer dis

From every train arriving at Redding
lately, so says the Redding Free Press,
mining men or miners alight, looking for
investments or work in Shasta County.
They are coming in from California camps
and also from other States.
The Redding Searchlight reports that
the Lowden and Friday holdings in the
Backbone district have been bonded to the
Trinity Copper Company. The holdings
amount to about 200 acres of copper claims
and patented ground. The property is
near the Mammoth mine. * '
Two tracts recently changed hands In this
county, which land Â¦will be worked in the near
future by dredsrlngr. These purchases are lo
cated on the south side of the Yuba, about
ten miles east of this city, one formerly owned
by James O'Brien and one by.S. Mitchell.
Besides these, several claims recently were
located by Hubert Vischer and associates,'
amounting to more than 1500 acres. The
anxiety to obtain land is shown In two loca
tions made on the same tract by different per
sons within four days, after one had bought
a possessory right from a homestead claimant.
Three dredffera will be constructed by one
company soon and they can be steadily em
ployed ten years to work out -the pay chan
nels of the land recently purchased. A bor
ing machine is at work locating the pay dirt
or travel and when finished a map of the
tract will be prepared showing the course of
the channel, which can then be followed by
the dredjte and worked to advantage. "With
the improved machines and electric power
ground can now be worked to profit that a
few years ago was considered of no value
for mining. Â¦ These channels i and pay streaks
can be traced' and mapped In such a way that
capitalists can figure out the income from it
very closely, as well as the cost of working
by dredge process. Between Marysville and
Timbuctoo there are several of these channels
branching out from the old original stream.
These are covered by deposits of debris many
years ago, but the gold is there hidden from
view and It can be extracted by the new pro
cess. This class of mining is not confined to
the river prpper, "but the dredge follows the
pay dirt out into adjacent fields.

as much of the essential element of blast
ing powders in that section as has been
reported by prospectors," and It can be
transported and refined cheaply enough,
California may be able to afford serious
competition to Chile not only in the mar
kets of this State but also in the world
at large. Now the Chilean nitrates have
the whole world *f or their, market. Great
fortunes have been made by the lucky
holders of stock in companies that have
exploited the Chilean nitrate beds. ' f-^an
Francisco has been a large importer from
Chile, there being some of j the largest
manufacturers of blasting powders about
the bay, not far from this city. . State
Mineralo&Ist Aubury believes that the in
vestigations in Death Valley may lead to
important commercial results. Professor

The shipment of borax from the Fraaier
mines has been resumed, so .says the
Bakersfleld Californian. Six-horse teams
are engaged in moving the borax to Bak
ersfleld. It is expected that large quanti
ties will be brought in from the other
mines in the Frasier Mountain country
this fall to Kern. A heavy rain has In
terfered with the work of development re
cently.
According to a report in the Union-
Democrat, the Tansy mine, on the east
ern outskirts of Sonora, Tuolumne Coun
ty, has developed a pocket from which
$15,000 has been taken. Out of the same
shaft some years ago A. Colby took ore
worth $42,000.
When the work of Investigating the cop
per deposits of the State is completed the
State Mineralogist will have the quick
silver looked up and there will be a bulle
tin in due time concerning quicksilver.
That will be followed by a bulletin giving
all the information accessible concerning
gold dredging in California. The data

all gathered and the reports of the field
assistants are cominc in. . . v

a medicine or eeal merit.
A Doctor Tells How a Patent Medi-
cine Cured His Patient.
"The number of suffering people ' who
are cured by patent medicines is really
astonishing," said a well-known physician
the other day.
â¢ "Why, don't you know I believe more
people are cured by patent medicines
than by doctors. It is difficult to explain
how some of these medicines do cure, but
the results are so plain we doctors can-
not go back on them.
"Wait a moment and I will give. you a
personal Instance. Some months- ago I
had a patient by the name of W. B. Fitch,
who is employed at the Bay Station,
Alameda, Cal. Mr. Fitch had a bad at-
tack of indigestion and suffered consider-
ably from rheumatism in his legs. I gave
him prescription after prescription, but
somehow his system would not respond to
the medicine and he kept getting worse
instead of better. I could not understand
his case at all. My Ill-luck actually con-
fused me, so I studied up on rheumatism
and even â¢ went so far as to consult a
specialist, but it didn't do any good. Fin-
ally I quit going around to see him and as
he did not come to see me I presumed that
he left me for another doctor.
â¢ "Imagine my surprise yesterday when I
was coming over on the boat to see Mr.
Fitch strong and hearty. I thought, of
course, it was the result of my work and
walked up and shook hands and asked
him how he felt. . â
" 'Oh, I'm all right,' he said, 'but no
thanks to you.'
"Upon further inquiry I learned he had
been induced to take a few bottles of Dr.
Halpruner's Pain Remover, and it had
cured him. How this medicine- could cure
him, when mine did not, I do not know,
but I do know that he had been a very
sick man and here he was perfectly cured,
and he swore Halpruner's Pain Remover
did it. So I am satisfied that some patent
medicines have a good deal of real merit."
Dr. Halpruner's wonderful Pain Re-
mover has cured over 100,000 people suf-
fering with neuralgia, malaria, indiges-
tion, rheumatism, sore throat, catarrh of
the head, throat, stomach, kidneys, etc.
It is also remarkably effective, for head-
acho and toothache, sprains, bruises,
burns, mosquito and flea bites, poison oak.
etc. It .can be taken internally ,or exter-
nally. .

1 "Weakness." 5
There Is no auch condition aa weakness in a man under fifty years of age, j
S other than general debility. In a stomach damaged by an ulcer or inflamma- j
Â§| tion, symptoms of disordered function arize. Prematureness, losa of vitality g
5 and the disorders known as "weakness" are but symptoms of some damage to gg
m the reproductive system, caused by a contracted disorder or early dl33lpa- g
S tion. In looklngr for the location of this damage we generally find an en- gj
K larged, swollen and lnflammed prostate gland. As this gland is the very cen- ' g
mn ter of the reproductive system, it can readily be understood that inflamma- Rj
q tlon of it must cause disordered function. These cases are promptly benefited gj
ra by proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes from bad to worse. The ea- B
ra sential point in all of: them is the necessity of the cure of the focus of the *B
Â» trouble, in the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully treated for a weak- B
Â£ ness which never existed, when if the damaged tract had been repaired a E3
B cure would have bean the result. In our experience there is no drug in the R
Eg Pharmacopeia, taken into the stomach, that will even benefit this class of H
B cases. Our plan of treatment Is entirely a local one and prompt results are 19
B obtained, as indicated by Increased circulation and return of natural vigor. B
g Varicocele, . |
63 Varlcocele is an enlargement of the most vital blood vessels in man. In J
B their normal condition, their function is to carry oft waste material, thus g
B enabling the organs to receive fresh nutrition. Owing to the breaking down g
H , of the valves, caused by the paralysis of the muscular coat of the veins, they g
B become dilated and local stagnation of the blood follows. The vital organs, |
3 being deprived of their proper, quality and quantity of nourishment, impaired S
~ functldn is the result. Statistics prove that 25 per cent of the male population g
Â¦ are afflicted with varicocele in some stage of the disease. "We guarantee to cure g

NAVT DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON.
Aug. 21, 1901.â Sir: The receipt of your letter
of the 21st Instant, explanatory of what was
designed by your former letter of - the 13th.
upon the subject of the competency of Rear
Admiral Howison to sit as a member of Â¦ the
court of inquiry, convened at your Instance Is
acknowledged. Very respectfully,

Rear Admiral Winneld 8. * Schley, U. 8. N.,

6. I Â¦ therefore respectfully state that the
department has not put the proper construction
upon my letter when it treated it in the nature
of a preliminary challenge for cause. I could
not challenge for cause until I discovered there
was a cause and the object of my communica
tion, as is evident upon its face, was to ascer
tain if Rear Admiral Howison had made this
statement. Tou will observe in this connec
tion that in his original statement he cays:
"I have made no public utterance relating to
this subject." I submit that his private ut
terances would affect his qualification as much
as his public utterances and my request was
only to have this alleged Interview submitted
for his consideration. Very respectfully,
W. S. SCHL.ET, Rear Admiral, U. S. N.
4. It was with the desire to avoid the neces
sity of making a formal challenge that I re
quested the department to lay before Rear Ad
miral Howison the statements that he is
alleged to have mads and thus give him the
opportunity of such retraction as his Eense of
propriety might suggest.
"I have enjoyed every moment of the
time I have spent abroad," said Cardinal
Gibbons to a Call correspondent t^day.
"My first visit was to his Holiness the
Pope, and I can but say that I was
amazed at the wonderful mental activity
displayed by him. His mind is perfectly
clear and his memory faultless. lie talked
of questions of the day and seemingly as
a master of the situation. Physically he
is a weak man, but this is not surprising
truth of the statements made ln the newspaper
clipping which I enclosed.
To-morrow Cardinal Gibbons will cele
brate mass in Brooklyn in' the home of
Major J. D. Keiley of 213 Clermont avenue,
whose guest he is, and on Monday he will
go to Baltimore, where an enthusiastic
welcome has been planned by the leading
Catholics of that city.

Commenting on the "fantastic idea of a

tions against- the' United States" the Out

"One might. as well try to hang a Vene

clude the influence of American indus
tries from the wcrld. For one thing, Great
Britain would-be no party to the bond,
lor another,' the power of American re
prisals would be terrible. Even now Ger
many is on the. verge of a struggle be
tween classes caused by the proposed
tariff. Under, the German tariff Austria
would ! suffer grievously." .
"They perceive," he added, "that we are
just getting ready, and in no respect is It
likely they, can beat us in the future. How
long can Europe stand to pay a balance
of trade of $650,000,000 a year after all our
securities are sent back? Some able Con
tinental observers to whom I put the in
quiry were unable to answer. x They fear

pressly 6tated my opinion of the high personal
character of Rear Admiral Howison and I
avoided any expression .of opinion as to the

A lengthy platform and . a declaration
of principles were adopted. The platform
deals with local issues entirely. The
building of homes for working people is
urged, as Is also the erection of

of the People," to be constructed of stone
and' steel, not . less than twelve stories in
height, and to contain halls,: meeting
rooms, free library and all other public
utilities. that It might be possible to crowd
into the space to be set apart for the
building.. :.... . v-
The declaration- of principles or mani
festo is intended as an Introduction to
the platform,- and sets forth in detail the
principles of the Socialist party..
The selection ' of two ; candidate: for Po

take the matter, up at a', later date to be
selected by the City Central Committee.

Socialist Labor Party
The Democratic County Committee has
not fixed a time for the convention of
the party to assemble, although a report
was- published that the delegates would
convene ' early In October. Jasper - Mc-
Donald, Gavin McNab and Mayor Phelan
have not decided on any plan of action.
The only thing 1 that seems to be definite
ly settled in the Democratic camp is that
Supervisor Wesley Reed's . chances of
getting the "Union Labor party's nomina
tion for Mayor have gone glimmering.
As a matter of consolation the Supervis
ors might ask; Mr. Reed to preside at
one of -their regular meetings. He is not
likely to: get a closer â¢ acquaintance with
the Mayor's office. .' , - -Â¦ Â¦ - .
Charles S. : Laumelster ' has not boldly
declared his candidacy for Mayor, but
there is some active work in his behalf.
Charles L. Patton, Judge Bahrs and
Auditor Wells are recognized as actual
candidates. . ._ * -
Delegate Fiegenbaum of the Forty
first has come out openly in . favor of R.
H. Webster for Mayor. Beyond all doubt
the Superintendent .of Schools is\- Mr.
Fiegenbaum's "unanimous" choice.
When. Fiegenbaum was; a pupil and
Â¦Webster a principal in the public school,
the former conceived the notion that he
would, some day, of the dim and misty
future, arise in convention and nominate
Webster for Mayor.
ment of the labor party for another term
in the office that he now hojds.
In the labor camp there are agitators
who are utterly opposed to the scheme of
placing a union ticket in the field, but it
seems to be settled that the convention,
called to assemble at Metropolitan Tem
ple on September 5, will nominate a full
municipal ticket. The story goes that
Hearst will be here' in a few days to size
up the situation and give his advice.
There is -not much activity in the Re
publican camp. Martin Kelly is still at
work on his speech, but is disturbed at
intervals by reports that Herrln and
Lynch, through secret connivance of Crim
mins, are stealing a. delegate here and
there: Boss Kelly professes to be con
fident of his ability to organize the con
vention and dictate the nominations, de
spite the reported organization of the in
dependent anti-boss forces. He "expects
to make Herrin, Lynch and Crimmins toe
the mark when the time for action ar
rives and to openly display their colors
in opposition to the rule of good citizen
ship. - >
The big boss, in the .vanity of his lead
ership, may be deceived as to the num
ber, of his followers. There is a growing
. sentiment among delegates in favor of
smashing all the slates and turning down
every programme proposed. At the pres
ent time* the anti-boss delegates have no
leader, but the progress of events may
develop leadership.- Whatever happens
Kelly will make his speech. If the Re
publican convention ignores him he will
probably get out and .knife the ticket.
He did not hesitate to bolt the State
ticket. in the Estee-Budd campaign.

SAN FRANCISCO Lodge of the
Benevolent and Protective Order
of Elks was five years old yester
day.'and last hieht celebrated its
wooden anniversary" in -Union
Square Hall., It .was an event for Elks
only, so ssaid the cards' that were printed
"on broad" beechwood shavinss',' and^ohly
such, with a few exceptions, were admit
ted into the tastefully decorated hall.
. There were about 350 of "the b?st people
.on earth" seated at many small tables,
which were used as rests for collation and
refreshments that were served with that
hospitality for which the Elks are re
nowned.
There were in addition to membership of
the local lodge many Elks from Vallejo,
Sacramento San Jose and other places.
At 10 o'clock Thomas Dunne, the exalted
ruler stood "1n a rose-covered bower and
delivered a short address, reviewing brief
ly the history of the lodge, and then bade
all be' merry. Then followed an impromp
tu programme of music, song and recita
tions by professional talent from all the
theaters and it was after 2 o'clock when
the last number was presented. Among
the many who assisted in making the
event a pleasant one were Barton Hill,
Â¦William McDonald, late of the Bostoni
ans; James Jones, the saxaphone sextet,
the only Cathcart, George Webster and
Zerka, the contortionist. â¢ />
Just before the 11 o'clock toast to the ab

lodge -a handsome gavel made of wood

WASHINGTON, Auff. 24.-The War De
partment has received a number of orders
of the division of the Philippines contain
ing facts' regarding the trials of the dif
ferent persons charged with various
crimes from murder to aiding and abet
ting the enemy of the United States.
The most Important Is the trial of BriJ
Haelterman, a Belgian, who was charged
with "relieving the enemy with money lr
violation of the laws of war." In the speci
fications brought before the military com
mission it Is pointed out that Haeltermai
enjoyed certain privileges as a neutral
The specific sum which he furnished th<
Filipinos is given and the dates upor
which the money was furnished.
Haelterman also was charged with fur
nishing the *enemy j with provisions and
harboring the enemy and generally violat
ing the laws of â¢war. He was found guilt}
on nearly every charge and was sentenced
to death.
The case was reviewed by General Mac-
Arthur, who says that "the sentence is
wholly warranted by the evidence. ~bui
the rapid passing away of the conditioi
of war moves the department commande;
to recommend that the sentence be com
muted," and this is done by fixing thÂ«
sentence at imprisonment for flf teer
years.;,' j- i-
Private" John English, Company H
Fortieth Volunteer Infantry, was con
victed in Mindanao of desertion and Ben
tenced to death. General Kobbe, in -re
viewing the case, says the court-martia
tried four other cases, two of them in
volving the death sentence, and he severe
ly criticized the methods, charging grosi
carelessness 'and neglect of duty. .Unclei

flict the dfeath penalty and commutes th<
sentence to ; twelve years' imprisonment.

sent to each his certificate of membership.
There will be a programme of entertain
ment for the. new and the old members

close the. evening. Several . plans have
been presented to the executive committee,

OAKLAND, Aug. 24.â In accordance
with agreements between the Brotherhood
of Teamsters, the Stevedores* Union, the
Building Trades Council and the coal and
lumber dealers, the union members went
to work to-day at James P. Taylor's
yards, Charles R. Allen's bunkers and at
the lumber yards where their services are
required to handle cargoes recently dis
charged. This agreement is to remain In
force for ten day3, but will not relate to
new cargoes. The effect is to check the
possibility of a present shortage of sup
plies, particularly in the lumber trade.
There was danger that building, contrac
tors would be compelled to stop work and
thus throw a large number of carpenters
and allied craftsmen out of employment.
The Oakland branch of the Union Labor
party will meet Sunday afternoon at- 2
o'clock at Justice Qulnn's, : courtroom,
southwest corner of Eighth street and
Broadway.

on Water Front.
UNION MEN AT WOBK
Â¦ Captain Wittman Informed the police
men when they were assembled to report
off at S o'clock of his arrest and \ again
advised them to do their duty regardless
of the conviction of Officer Knight and
the Issuance of the warrant for his own
arrest.
' Masse and a "number of other strikers
were standing on Brannan street creat
ing a disturbance when Wittman charged
the crowd. Masse ran into a saloon, fol
lowed by the captain, who concluded: that
he was the leader of the crowd. After
chasing him to the roof of the . adjoining
house Wittman struck him with his club
and then ordered one of his men to. lock
him up for disturbing the peace. The case
Is still pending in Judge Conlan's court.
"He is sore because I, criticized him for
'convicting 'Police- Officer Knight.*,- Not
withstanding the. feeling he has against
me I do not intend to apply for a change
of venue. If I am convicted I intend to
"take an appeal to the Superior Court."
"Cabaniss, in my opinion, has i made a
grave mistake," remarked tha captain
when discussing hl3 arrest. V.
"We were always wondering what be
came of non-union men who were- Induced
to go to the teamsters' headquarters, and
now -we have solved the mystery. ThÂ«
brakemen on the railroads are in sympa
thy with the strikers, and when men ars
taken to the headquarters of the team
sters they are detained there till darkness
has set in. Then they are taken to empty
boxcars and locked in by the brakemen,
and when- the freight train reaches a point
a considerable distance from the city they
are dumped out and allowed to shift for
themselves. I presume that would have
been the fate of the four sailors If one of
them had not given the alarm."

Judge Cabaniss Issues Warrant , on
Battery Charge.
Judge Cabaniss yesterday Issued a war
rant on complaint of James Masse for tha
arrest of Captain "Wlttman, charging him
with battery. Masse Is the striking ma
rine fireman who was clubbed by Captain
"Wittman last Tuesday during a lively
scrimmage on Brannan street.
As soon as he learned of the issuance
of the warrant Captain "Wittman gave $20
to'. Sergeant Moffltt to place with Chief
Bond Clerk Peery for his release. After
the necessary order of release was .made
out Sergeant Moffltt went to tbe> City
Prison and had the name of Captain
"Wittman and the charge against him re
corded on the prison blotter. '.
The case will be heard to-morrow morn-
Ing. * * . â¢
After being there for about two hour3
Greenburg promised that he would Join
the union and askeÂ«J to be allowed to go
out to purchase some' tobacco. He went
out, followed by ; Rafferty and McLaugh
lin. A car was passing at the time, going
south, and he Jumped on It. determined to
make his escape. ' Rafferty and McLaugh
lin also Jumped on the car, and when it
reached the depot at Third and Townsend
streets, Greenburg says, they dragged him
off and beat him. Hir cries for help were
heard by Sergeant Christiansen and posse,
and they soon rescued Greenburg, and
placed Rafferty and McLaughlin under
arrest on a charge of battery.
., Greenburg told the sergeant that' three
of his companions [were. locked "up at the
teamsters' headquarters, and Christiansen
went there and compelled their release.
He placed "Walsh and Murphy under ar
restand took them to the Hall. of. Justice
along with Rafferty and McLaughlin. He
consulted the District Attorney as to what
charge to. place against Walsh and Mur
phy, and was advised' to book them for
false Imprisonment, which was done, on
the complaint of Shafter. Shortly after
ward the four defendants were released
on 55 cash bail each, accepted by Assist
ant "Warrant Clerk Greeley.
Captain "Wittman in speaking of the ar
rests said: !

so they, allege, that, they had better leave
the vessel! otherwise they might get killed
for working as "scabs." - They .were finally
induced-to leave the. vessel.' and were

Fourth street; near Townsend. There,
they allege, they .were locked up in a room
and a guard placed at the door.

THOUSANDS OF STRIKERS PARADE THROUGH STREETS OF CITY
IN PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION TO FURTHER CAUSE OF LABOR
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, AUGUST 25, 1901.
The greatest crowd collected at the
corner of Market and Third streets, and
as the line swung around into Third
Ftreet cheers were given repeatedly for
the Examiner. No halt was made, but
as sections of the various unions passed
come one would propose three cheers for
the newEpaper and they were generally
given, though occasionally there was no
response. Numerous times ' when the
marching men were oblivious Â¦ to the
Cheers and Groans Distributed.
There was an utter absence of the
banners. usually seen in a labor parade.
A few of the men carried small Ameri
can flags. The piledrlvers carried a
miniature piledriver and the stevedores
a huge hook for handling bales, as in
signia of their unions.
In the wholesale district there was llt
tli demonstration, though a number of
Â¦enthusiastic girls employed across the
etreet from Lev! Strauss & Co., who
wived flags and cheered the strikers.
Incited the men in line to a few groans
and hisses for the firm named.
The Marine Firemen marched flrst In the
cecond division, the Bailors' Union and the
Marine Cooks and Waltem following.
Next In line were members of the Iron
Molders' Union, with union cards thrust
under their, hat bands; Boiler-makers
wearing conspicuous red badges, and a
number of machinists. Xo attempt was
made to get a strong showing of the iron
trades unions, only those men marching
who collected at headquarters volun
tarily.
The Porters, Packers and Warehouse
men, led by President O'Neill; the Box
makers, and the United Brewery Werk>
era comprised the last section of the di
vision. â¢ A stalwart member of the last*
named union bore at its head a large and
handsomely embroidered American flag.
Absence of Banners.
Longshoremen's Union followed, and be
hind them marched the Hoisting Enel
neers. The third section of the first di
vision was made up of the Steam and Hot
Water' Fitters, with Joseph Gallagher in
command; the Ship Joiners, led by J. D.
Sherwood; the Pile Drivers and Bridge
Builders, in charge of N. Burnham; the
Coal Yard and Trestle Men, and the Coal
Cart Teamsters.
Chief. Aid E. Anderson commanded the
second division, with Second Chief Aid
J. Bell to assist him. A band headed
each division, and a drum corps In the
middle of the flrst division stirred the
martial ardor of the strikers.
Michael Casey, Andrew Furuseth, Ed
ward Rosenberg and August Holmgren
marched at the bead of the column. Be
hind them came members of the execu
tive committee of the City Front Federa
tion, among them being Robert H. Lough
ery. Charles Kelly. Michael Monahan,
Thomas "Westoby, J. C. Christlanson, J.
Harper, L. Barry, J. McDermott, C. Ho!
loway. J. Markley and J. Smirch.
The place of honor was given the team

hood of Teamsters, was in command, and
a stand of colors was carried at the head
of the column. The four locals of the

early, and long before 1 o'clock .East
street was black with men waiting for the
start to be made. "With much skill Grand
Marshal Michael Casey and his aids had
these men in their assigned places on time
and at 1:05 the march began.
Thomas Westoby, secretary of the City
Front Federation, estimated the columr
ns it passed the ferry depot to contain
M21 men. but all the estimates made far
ther tji> Market street placed the number
nearer 4000. An old National Guard officer
set It at 4200. A citizen -who counted the
men in line as accurately as possible set
his figures down thus: "2720 men, two
bands, one drum corps." Three reporters
who attempted to connt the strikers as
they swarmed past arrived at these flÂ«r

their sympathizers In the crowds that
lined the streets kept the slogans of the
etrlke ringing even after the strikers were
tired and dusty from the long march.
There was plenty of shouting, banter for
policemen and bitter railing at luckless
non-union men at -work who came within
eight cf the parading strikers. But not so
much as a pebble was thrown, and after
the marching was over the leaders took
the men to the various headauarters and
from these they dispersed to their homes.

loaded in front of a warehouse. While the

any serious trouble ." occurred.' , several
leaders of the- City Front Federation
stepped forth and stood guard around the
team and the non-i#iipn ' teamster. The
strikers- were told to â¢march quietly on
and -not to offer to molest team or. driver.
They obeyed orders and not another jeer
was heard nor was any further attempt

Occasionally non-union drivers and po
licemen or specials, whose drays .were
blocked by the parade, were . mercilessly
abused verbally by the strikers as they
marched past, but the officers, smiled in
indifference and the non-union j men
wlseljf swallowed any anger they ' may
have felt. .- .
The line of march was as previously,
announced â along East street to Battery,
along BatteVy to Market, up Market to
Third, down Third to Brannan, down
Brannan to the Mail dock, and along the
water front 'back to East and Mission
streets. Â¦ .
At a time when the men in line were
catching breath after cheers for the
Brotherhood of Teamsters, a Hibernian
among them caused a laugh by an earn

One striker of German birth waved a
small flag of the country and shouted,
"This Is the flag- that conquered Eng
land and It'll conquer | the capitalists,
too!"
The Call was given groans several
times and at other times they were
called for by men in the crowd when the
strikers did not apparently consider them
due and did not respond.

bera of the Ship Joiners' Association, or
ganized in 1857, stood in front of the head
quarters at 14 Folsom street and waved
a large American flag. The longshore

and cheered the old man enthusiastically.
The parade was completed at 3 o'clock.

The hares that wexÂ« furnished for thÂ«
rundown of yesterday's Reserve staks at
Union' Park proved the fastest lot that
has been seen on the field for many days,
and as a result heavy scoring prevailed.
Relief dogs were liberated in many of thÂ«
courses and helped to make the day's
sport an Interesting one.
A total of eleven upsets gave the piker*
a chance to fill their purses. The first fa
vorite to kick over the traces was the ex
champion courser. Royal Flush, - Against
Captain Clarkson's Sofala the wise ones
had figured that Flush was an easy win-
ner and sent him to the slips with 4 to 1
on his chances. Flush laid off his game
and by his . careless work lost to Sofala
by a point. Achilles beat St. Ives at 2 to
1. Game Cock beat Hickory Dick, Three
Cheers beat Prompto, Bonus beat Lilac
at 5 to 3. At the- bottom of the card the
short end players reaped a harvest. Three
times the Pasha kennels won with the
odds against them. Rollicking Airs beat
Aeneas at 5 to 3, Real Aristocrat beat
Cotton Ball at 4 to 1, and Real Article
beat Agamemnon at 7 to 2.
In close proximity, Thornhill, on whom
the talent - had banked at 6 to 1, was
beaten pointless by Noe Maid. Day
light beat Rosie R at 2 to 1 and Lady
Glenkirk got the flag from Strayaway,
an 8 to 1 choice, by a clear margin. â¢-â¢- Â¦
Probable winners in the second round
are Faraway, Naughty Girl, Black Flush,
Greenback, Floodgate. Chicago Boy, Flora .

Floodgate, Rocker, Tralee Boy and Real
Article are well played for the stake. In
the class event the management has of
fered the best lot of champions that could
be brought together. The goes between
Vandal and Fine Fire, and Palo Alto and
Rector will be heavy betting ones. In the
long odds book Palo Alto Is at 3, Dew

eral edicts issued within recent months
by the Empress Dowager urging upon the
officials of China every exertion to secure
men of talent for conducting Government

The. edicts direct greater liberality in
classical examination and provide for the
study of political economy in addition to
the studies under the old regime. The
\buses and corruption which have existed
under the boards that heretofore have
ruled China are set forth in emphatic lan
guage, and all officials are directed to as
sist in rooting out evils and establishing
a better system of administration.

was some slight show of enthusiasm.
Fusillade ruled a decided favorite In the

further laurels by capturing the hanil-.
some trophy with Fusillade, a handsome
little chestnut by | the English sire St.

. The game Itself was one sided, the An
gels finding Johnson, â¢who pitched the first
few Innings, with such ease that Babbitt
was substituted. Hale was too much for
.the Dudes, who played in shipshod fash
ion. Pop Hardie, dressed in a minstrel
coat of blue with yellow collar, officiated
as an umpire in Graves' place. . .
The rowdyism of the players will be in
vestigated by the league in the near fu
ture. Morley tides with Captain Reilly,
and says that Spies will be fined not only
for his failure to keep moving after his
hit but also for connecting with Reilly's
right ear. Spies says he does not care
and if the worst comes to the worst will
heave his Job Into midair. Score:
But that was not all. When the teams
filed out of the grounds ex-Umpire Graves
was there, and he used evil sounding
â¢words to Hutchinson, at the same time
displaying a knife. Hutchinson threw his
bat at Graves and the gathering crowd
prevented further disturbance.
rhiring the eighth inning, when the
southerners were on the bench, a wordy
war arose between Spies and Reilly.
Spies lost his temper and smote Reilly
on the right ear, drawing blood. Reilly,
filled with the fury of. vengeance, seized
a bat and was about to use it on the
pugilistic catcher, when Spies closed in.
wrested the bludgeon from his hands and
grappled with htm. Then the police and
the small boy put in an appearance and
for the time all 'was noise, riot and con
fusion. The crowd cheered for Spies and
hooted at Reilly, whose kicking methods
have not won favor. After that the game
went on, but as the crowd had been gra
tuitously treated to a real fight the base
ball end of It was submerged as far as
Interest went.
Manag-er Morley, feeling none too happy
over certain fistic demonstrations of Um
pire Graves on Friday evening, was In
attendance at the game yesterday after
noon at Recreation Grounds.' This time
his team of bellicose Angels broke the
Ice of defeat and Â¦whitewashed, the Dudes,
but that was of no moment to the public,
as the game was listless and of the drag
ging- sort until the eighth inning, at which
time" Internecine war broke out. In the
ranks of the Angels and blood was let.
The police and an army of small boys
who jumped the fence and swarmed upon
the field Quelled the riot- â¢
This is how It happened. About the
middle of the game, during an Inning of
the Angels, Spiesâ mirthful, mild, docile
Hank â was at bat, with two men out and
a man on third. He hit the ball within
the limits of the lnfleld and stopped run
ning, thinking he was a dead one before
the umpire pronounced his fate. As luck
would have It, the ball was juggled.. and
but for this slowing, down of Spies a run
would have been scored and he would
have been safe at first. Then Captain An
gel Reilly said something nasty to him
end levied a fine of $10 -on his salary. â¢

United States, which treaty is to be re
spected, the Government should take ad
vantage of any favorable opportunity to
influence the United States to reverse the
clauses curtailing Cuban independence
and sovereignty."
Then follow four clauses dealing with
the question of the commercial treaty be
tween the United States and Cuba,
"which should tend toward free trade,
but at present Cuba needs some income
from customs."
"We think the following would be an
appropriate programme in the country's
present condition."
HAVANA, Aug. 24.â A meeting of twen
ty-four notable persons was held to-day
to coflsider the letter drafted by Juan
Gualberto Gomez, at the request of the
committee appointed to address a com
munication to Thomas Estrada Palma,
asking for a more specific statement from
him regarding the programme he would
follow if elected President of the Cuban
republic. The letter saye:
The bullet shattered one of the short
ribs and passed within half an inch of the
spinal column. He did not know that he
was shot until he felt the blood running
down hi3 legs. He walked two blocks to
a surgeon's office and lost a great deal of
blood before, the flow was stopped. 'He
has now passed the critical point and Is
on a fair road to recovery.
NAPA, Aug. 24.â Edward .;: Eustace, ' a

could get out of the house the man shoi
him in the back. â¢.."-â¢"

Dr. Oren Root, professor of mathemat
ics at Hamilton College, Utica, N. Y., a
brother to Elihu Root, Secretary of War,
has been a guest at â¢ the Hotel
St. Nicholas during the past week.
Dr. Root Is a keen observer as well as
a traveler. He has journeyed all the way
from Utica to see and then to air hi3
opinion on California and its Inhabitants.
His views have been printed and spread
broadcast by his home paper and the resi
dents of that place have been given a
splendid Idea of this city and her people.
As a descriptive writer Professor Root
deserves to take his- place among the
gifted writers of the country, but he Is
modest and calls himself a "rural peda
gogue." As a sample of his descriptive
Â¦work the following excerpt may be en-
Joyed by Call readers:
The rural pedagogue has continued his ab
sence from familiar scenes and has railroaded
of late along the Pacific Coast. The distance
between points that touch each other Is about
the same here as elsewhere; but points that
don't touch each other are a great way apart.
The Journey from Portland to San Francisco
by the Shasta routeâ Southern Pacificâ is
worth taking if one had to do it on foot or
in a wheelbarrow. For details, friends can
consult any dictionary unabridgedâ the largest
preferred. They have arranged to hold down
most of the "sand lots" in San Francisco, but
enough of them float around to make trolley
and cable travel very disagreeable. There
are hills in San Francisco and the way the
cable cars climb them should be a magnifi
cent encouragement to freshmen and other
small boya and girls who have to tackle
mathematics. My notion of California is not
exhaustive or accurate. I feel quite sure in
saying that in the main it Is a State of one-,
story houses and two-story men and women.
If any one has said that before I congratu
late hlm-he had Bense. The "rural peda-
Eocue" driving about Oakland reluctantly
consented to a drive through the campus of
the - University of California. The site Is
superb. The buildings . are temporary but
convenient. As two Hamilton men are In the
faculty, the teaching part of the Institution
Is sound.
He pays a tribute to Colonel Oscar
Long, saying:
More than all else here the rural pedagogue
has been impressed with the work of con
trolling and shipping the new growthâ a
great army, suddenly called into service, to
be sent across an ocean for work in a new
land. The East was too far off. From the
ground- the- work was built upâ the men,
thousands on thousands of them â nearly 100,000
In all, outfitted and iorwarded by army trans
ports to Manila. A handsome, quiet gentle
man, growing now a little gray at the tem
ples, has 1 done the work. He was a Utlca
boyâ Ut lea Academy and Bryant and Stratton
âand Hopson and Shepard, before West Point.
He has his vote in Utica yet. No general In
command, no general in the field, no general
In headquarters has done more for American
success than the quiet,, clear-eyed, firm
mouthed manâ Quartermaster Oscar F. Long.
It is a shame in the service that men brave
In ection. but no braver than Long, and not
having done one-tenth his work,' have gone up
to hleh rank. , " . .
The R. P. expects to spend a little 'more
time in estimating California and then 'more
on the I Yellowstone region, which is not to
be estimated because It belongs to the I gen
eral Government. Any one who estimates on
a general United States Government proposi
tion should have the wisdom of the Supreme
Court of the United States and the conceit of
a newly appointed lieutenant of. infantry.
The rural pedagogue : being - noW; well "and
happy, may hereafter waste time, Ink and
paper along,, these lines.

GIVES HIS VIEWS
OF CALIFORNIA
"Water Front U"otes.
Charley Murrey and Nick Sullivan are
among the missing on the front. They
are both well-known non-union sailors,
and it is said the union has sent them on
a vacation up the Sacramento in a yawl.
Others again assert that their absence is
due to an urgent inquiry tfiat Beadle &
Co, -the ship owners^ are making about
them. In either event Murrey and Sulli
van are missing and their friends are
wondering.
The steamei Alliance got a rope in her
propeller at Coos Bay and was detained
there some time. Since the strike she
has been running between the Columbia
River and Eureka, leaving San Francisco
out of her itinerary.
J. T. Cardoza went out as purser of the
Pomona to-day. He takes the place of
Purser Harry Skinner for one trip. Mr.
Cardoza is the Coroha's regular-purser,
but as that vessel is laid up he takes the
place of Mr. Skinner, who remains ashore
on business.
Loading 1 for Europe.
Four of the grain fleet are nearly loaded
at Port Costa and the agents expect to
get them away for Europe this week.
The Santa Clara, the first of the salmon
fleet, went alongside the British ship John
Cocke, lying at Beale-street wharf, yes
terday and the work of transferring the
salmon from one vessel to the other was
begun at once. The Cooke expects to get
away for Liverpool before the month is
out, while the Santa Clara will return to
Alaska for another load of salmon.
County of Haddington Given Up for
Lost by Her Owners.
The British four-masted ship County of
Haddington is now out 204 days from
New York for Shanghai with a cargo of
coal oil and her owners have about given
her up for lost. At the present time 90
per cent is offered to reinsure vessel and
cargo, with no takers. The County . of
Haddington is a sister ship to the County
of Inverness, which arrived here on the
10th Inst. in ballast from Pisagua to load
wheat for Europe.
The British bark Calluna Is now out 149
days from Calcutta for Tocopilla, and 20
per cent is being paid on her.
The Norwegian bark Prince Arthur is
now out 103 days from Port Gamble for
Port Pirie and 20 per cent is being paid
on her chances. The Prince Arthur was
formerly the British bark Hoghton Tower,
but was sold to the Norwegians several
years ago. She loaded 1,292,640 feet of
lumber en the Sound and is making a
long run to the Australian coast. Ship
ping men fear that she was caught In a
gale and dismasted.
HE Erltish ship Manydown ar-
I rived from Swansea Friday night
I after a run of 1C6 days. She had
JJL a hard time of it and was in
three storms that carried away
nearly two suits of sails. Strange
to say. the Manydown arrived here Au
gust 23, 1S25, after an almost similar voy
age, which occupied exactly 166 days. On
that occasion she raced with the British
ship Lord Templemore, and they made a
dead heat of It. On her last voyage the
Manydown sailed against time and time
won.
The coal laden ehip left Swansea on
March 9 last. In the Bay of Biscay she
â¢R-as caught- in a thunderstorm, which
lasted lour days and carried away the
inner and outer Jib and the upper topsail.
From that on fair weather was the rule
until May 8, when another thunderstorm
was run into, during which the chip la
bored heavily and some more sails were
blown out of the bolt ropes. On May 30
Cape Horn was sighted and on June 7 the
good ship was In the middle of the heavy
weather that generally prevails off the
Cape of Storms. On June 26 and 2S the
Manydown was running before it, but the
heavy beam seas that followed her wash
ed the chocks from under the lifeboats
and swept everything moveable on deck
away. It was as much as a man's life
was worth to move around the deck and
many a time the crew had to take to the
rigging to escape being washed overboard.

Remarkable Coincidence in Two Trips of the
British Vessel From Swansea, Each Taking
166 Days and Ending on the Same Day
NOTEâ The hlph and low waters occur at
the city front (Mission-street wharf) about
twentv-flve minutes later than -at Fort Point:
the height of tide is the same at both places.

BUSINESS CHANCES.
Aâ $25C0 will buy an interest in the greatest In-
vention of this century; the Solar Stove, or
cooking, by heat of the sun; heat, and plenty
of it, without fuel of any kind; do you real-
ize what this means? If eo, investigate it at
once; I have invented a "stove" or cooking
apparatus that will cook half a dozen kinds
of food at the same time, without any fuel,
utilizing the heat from the sun only; it can
be placed on top of the house and, working
jj automatically, the heat is carried through
pipes down to the kitchen, basement or
wherever you want it; no smoke, no dirt, no
ashes, and no sweltering over an old-fash-
ioned stove during the hot summer months:
plenty of heat all day long fram an hour
after sunrise until an hour before sunset; hot
water always ready, if you want it; capacity
of "stove" can be increased until it develops
enough heat to run a 10 or 15 horse-power en-
gine, and by putting in a number of "stoves"
enough heat can be developed to run the
largest engines; can also b* used for heating
purposes in winter.
It will cost me about $10,000 to take' out
patents in all the 90 or more countries that
issue them, and 1 am about $5000 short of
that amount, and in order to raise the money

ngnts to tnis state tor $ZaOO cash, and also a
half-interest in any other State (excepting
New York) for the same amount (one-fourth
Interest for $1250); there is a fortune in this
Invention for several different persons; it will
stand the strictest investigation, and you
will not be asked to pay me a single dollar
until I have cooked a meal on the Solar Stove
in your presence: explained its workings to
you and given you a bill of sale or assign-
ment of the territory you are buying.
If you have that amount of cash that you
are willing to invest as soon as I have satis-
fied you that my invention is all I claim for
it, let me hear from yeu; the half-Interest of
either of these two States can be an undi-
vided half-interest or exclusive control over
half of the State (named by counties), as the
buyer â¢ prefers at the time of closing deal.

"WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST. \
Generally cloudy weather prevails over West
ern Washington and along the coast from
Cape Mendocino northward; elsewhere west of
the Rocky Mountains the weather is fair.
The pressure has risen rapidly over the north
western portion of the Pacific slope and faller
along the Southern California coast.
The temperature has fallen slightly over
Â¦Washington and Oregon and risen over Califor
nia and Arisona.
Confiitlons are favorable for fair and warmer
â¢weather in California Sunday.
Forecast made at San Francisco for thirty
hour* ending midnight â¢ August 25:
Northern Californiaâ Fair Sunday; -warmer;
light northwest wind.
Southern Californiaâ Fair,' warmer Sunday:
llcht west wind.
Vevadaâ Fair Sunday: light northwest' wind.
Ban Francisco and vicinityâ Fair, warmer
Sunday; light northwest wind..
. It appears quite probable that the movement
of cash to Philadelphia was really below the
minimum amount estimated. The loans of the
bank were increased by $3,027,100, which sum
may be regarded as fair, considering the dispo
sition of bank managers generally to curtail
.discounts as much as possible, in view of the
tendency of the demand for money for the crop
movement. The deposits were augmented $3,520 .
400. which very closely corresponded with the
total of the gain in loans and in cash. Hence
the statement was harmonious In this respect
The surplus reserve was reduced by the com
paratively email amount of $273,800 to $18 148 -
100. Borrowers would need, It would seem
to be under .no apprehension* regarding the
supply of money for all legitimate . objects
though doubtless lenders will seek to convey
the impression that because the ! Inquiry for
crop" purposes has apparently actively begun
rates for loanable funds should rule higher On
Monday of â¢ the current week the treasury Â¦ will
receive $1,000,000 4 per cent bonds, the deliyery
of which has been contracted for, and there

I Toward the end of the .week, however, ' there
was an urgent demand for Philadelphia funds,
which caused the shipment to that city of va
rious amounts * of currency estimated
at from â¢ $1,500,000 to $3,000,000. If neither of
these sums of money was sent to Philadelphia
it follows that the apparent gain on the week's
movements was wiped out. It should be ob
served, however, that the cash sent to Phila
delphia will doubtless be promptly returned
when payments shall have been made for the
bonds for which the money was required.
The cash returns of the New York Associated
Banks last week were largely affected by what
may be characterized as extraordinary move
ments, not only through Sub-Treasury opera
tions but through the interior transfers 'of
money. Early in the week the Sub-Treasury
paid $1,500,000 and later $450,000 for assay office
checks representing Australian and Yukon gold,
which has been deposited at Pacific. Coast as
say offices. Disbursements for pensions were
large, amounting to $2,091,000. and- bond pay
ments were $78,601. These various items made
a total of $4,119,501. . The' extraordinary- receipts
by the. Sub-Treasury were $1,100,000, which
amount was deposited by the banks for transfer
to â¢ the Interiorâ $300,000 to : New Orleans and
$800,000 to Chicago. "Deducting these . receipts
from the disbursements above leaves â¢ $3,094,501.
It should be noted, however, that the payments
for Australian gold probably counted in the
bank average for only four days, while the re
ceipts from the banks for transfers to the inte
rior counted for but two days of the week. The
net ordinary operations of the Sub-Treasury
were, owing to large customs and internal rev
enue receipts. - sufficient to counterbalance the
net extraordinary disbursements / as . above,
causing the* banks to lose on Sub-Treasury ac
counts . $162,000. The Interior movement 'Of
money, so far as traceable, resulted 1 in a gain
to the banks of $1,245,114, and, deducting the
loss to the treasury of $162,000 as above, there
was "an apparent gain in the week's movement
of $1,083,000.

CHICAGO, Aug. 24.â Traffic > in .wheat was
in small quantities and as the situation showed
no material change the usual dull and feature
less affair known as the "Saturday market"
was the result. September opened a shade to

A recovery to 70%c followed on profit-taking
by shorts. Prices fluctuated the remainder of
the session within the range thus established
and closed steady, September a shade higher
at 70%c. . â¢ -
Corn gave indications of having shaken ' out
all doublets or insufficiently margined sup

The market opened weak, but gradually: im
proved when offerings of long torn were
eeryed to be comparatively small. Septeipber
closed a shade down at Eoc. " Â¦ -Â¦.....
Continued liquidation ' by , September longs
caused a further decline in oats early, but
the market rallied in -sympathy with corn.
September closed Vic lower at 34c. - - _
Provisions were dull, but firm and made a
slight improvement, without j the aid of the
grain markets. This was due to buying for
the outside account. The range was narrow.
January pork closed 2%@5c higher, lard 2%c

the professionals found little difficulty In sup
porting Drices and held the market . pretty
steady aiTd near the top until the close. The
public 6tilU hangs back, but evidently the hope
is entertaljed that Monday morning will bring
more outsiders into the market, attracted by
yesterday" â¢ greater activity and strength arid
Its persistence to-day. The bank statement
was About as expected in the cash Item, except
that the supposed shipments to Philadelphia
were not disclosed. The moderate loan ex
pansion was attributed to the stirring of pools
In the stock market, which has developed dur
ing the week. .The leaders to-day were Atch
ison, Erie, the Pacifies, Amalgamated Copper
and Sugar, about in the order named. The
strength was well distributed, but some of the
recent strong etocks hung back somewhat,
especially the Pennsylvania group, the Wabash
issues^ St. Paul and Southern Railway. The
United States Steel stocks were quiet, but the
preferred rose a point In the late dealings.
There has been no revival of speculative ac
tivity this week, except in a. few spots. The
volume of dealings has been somewhat less
than last week, and on Tuesday the dealings
in bonds fell to the low level of the year.
There was increased activity of speculative
bondB later In the week. Notwithstanding the
dullness of the market the tone has been quite,
firm and there were periods of positive strength.
Closing up of outstanding contracts on the
fhort side was responsible for some part of
the strength, thus eliminating a potential re
quirement for stocks and giving promise - of
even greater dullness In the future. There
were, however, the usual operations by the
always industrious room-traders to try to reap
advantage from requirements of shorts by bid
. ding up stocks and even to inaugurate bull
.movements by. the formation of pools in special
etocks. The covering by shorts was largely
attributed, to Western sources, from which
selling had been large on the early indica
tions of damage to the corn crop. The sus
tained character of the demand ' indicated that
the crop damage had been overdlscounted by
the selling of Etocks and possibly over-esti
mated also. . The continued high level of rail
road earnings in the region affected had a
cheering effect upon holders of securities, and
the fine condition of the . spring wheat crop
and the large total crop of- wheat Indicated
have received increasing attention. Last week' 3
record exports of wheat, although not fully
maintained this week, add to the importance
of our wheat crop ana reinforce the statistics
of foreign wheat crops â¢ as showing large re
quirements to be met from qur 'surplus sup
ply of wheat. The conditions thus presented
ere a forcible reminder of the outcome of last
year's marketing of crops. The development
of a. shortage of spring wheat last year, which
caused acute weakness in the securities of all
railroads In the Northwestern region, proved
to be neutralized by the very heavy traffic in
general merchandise, so that railroad earnings
were' not checked in the increase. The steel
strike cloud still overhangs the market. The
claim of the London Standard that American
consumers of finished goods are placing orders
In Great Britain on quite' a large scale is con
sidered significant in that respect. Wall street
opinion, however, is" inclined to a determinedly
optimistic view of the. outlook in the steel
trade. Operators in stocks are inclined to con
tinue their analogy with last year's events
and point to the ultimate improvement In the
anthracite trade in spite of the shut-down of
the- mines. This sentiment may be the effect,
rather than the cause, of the firmness of the
United States Steel stocks, in which the deal
ings have been email and insignificant. The
real pressure upon the stocks came in an
ticipation of the strike and forced the drastic
liquidation' early In July, when fore-handed
financiers were preparing for what they saw
was the inevitable. Amply retrenched as a
result of that foresight. â¢ under the generalship
of the most skillful manipulators in Wall
Etreet, the feeling in financial circles is thus
eeen to be one of confidence in the ultimate
values of securities and continued prosperous
conditions. Speculation halts because of a
doubt of the capacity of the money market in
the immediate future to supply the sinews of
war fOr operations on a sufficient scale to at
tract a large outside share in a speculative
movement. Money on call rules easy at the
moment, but there is no Inducement to make
large commitments In stocks in reliance upon
call loans. Already the interior ia withdraw
ing funds from New York for the annual crop
movement. The payments to the field laborers
and to small farmers necessitate the use of
actual currency, the disuse of checks making
impossible- the economy of the circulating
medium which results from clearing-house
operations with checks between banks. But
this currency must be drawn from the cash
reserves of the banks, thus contracting pro
portionately their credit resources based on
cash reserves. \ The permission under the bank
ing laws to interior banks to count as part
of their legal reserves taÂ»h resources which are
actually on deposit with New York banks has
the effect of converting this annual demand
for currency almost directly upon the cash re
serves of the New York Clearing-house banks.
The prospects are that the demand will be
heavier than usual this fall. Government fiscal
operations are making requirement* upon. the
money market several million dollars in ex
cess of last year. The . ease with which the
Bank of England is conserving its reserves,
ehown by the maintenance of the bank rate
this week, indicates that foreign money mar
kets expect demands upon them from New
York tp replenish the drain to the interior of
this account. About $1,400,000 of Australian
gold by way of San Francisco found its way
Into New York bank reserves this week and
J2 500. COO additional gold now at sea on the
Pacific will find the same, destination. Bank
ers profess to have no fear of stringency. In
view of these relieving tendencies, but they
look for an active money market.
The "railroad t>ond market has been narrow
and dull, but .firm.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
call prices, of last week. â¢

Mr. Farmer died , and his ,' wife inherited

Bryant streetsi ..There are five of the
Kelly brothers; and they are all long
shoremen. They are all' union men and
quit their work here on. the order of the
federation. They were not content to lead
idle lives, however," and went to Port
Costa to work with the non-union hands
employed; loading' -the vessels, there.
They returned from Uhere last night and
visited their old haunts on Bryant street.
They were followed-, by. union hands and
two of them were dragged off the car at
the corner of Third and Bryant streets
and badly beaten. ; They *were treated at
the Emergency . Hospital.- Â¦ Joseph â¢ Hayes
took it upon himself " to .whip .the other
three, but was worsted In the encounter.
Suppose this conspiracy succeeds! Suppose
the plans of its promoters were consummated!
Suppose labor unions were crushed and we de
prived of the 'right to combine. What then 7
Can any freeman in the commonwealth of Cali
fornia bear the prospect with equanimity?
Think you that these men would be content
with their victory over us? No. They would
exploit the entire State. . Drunk with success
and wealth they would dictate, terms to the
farmer and the fruit grower, the miner and the
entire producing classes of the State.. They
would levy taxes on the interior and make
your readers pay for the special police and the
spies, the expenses they have undergone and
4he losses they have suffered. If we fail what
chance have individuals against them? Skilled
laborers. would shake the dust of California off
their feet. The mills would rust in idleness and
the wharves grow green with grass, for no man
who calls his soul his own would submit to the
dictation of a secret . conspiracy of merchants.
This Is but one phase of the question, but it
iÂ« the most important. This Is the phase we
wish to bring before the people of Calif ornla.
Beslde this all others dwindle into insignifi
cance. â¢ Human rights are more sacred than

Not, many rich, not many > proud,- read your

and the farmer's home. Hence we desire that
you should state this question in its important
bearings to the people of the State. The press

rights and it has not failed In its mission in
these, . our days. Tou .have no interest but
the good of your readers. You have no ax . to

SALINAS. Aug. 24.â A man was found
on the Monterey side of the Pajaro rail
way bridge this?, morning, badly mangled
and covered by blood. He was uncon
scious, and upon slightly : recovering gave
his name as William Black. ," Later, after
gaining } fUjlU consciousness, he said his
name was William Conrad. He claims
that he ..laid . down near the â¢ track and

his shoulder blade and three ribs. He
says he , Was ; at one time a section em

was to have been witnessed there were
no- two persons who would have been
more likely to be called In or to have
been on hand. The will is drawn upon
yellow paper in' handwriting apparently
the same as that in the letter, although
the will is. in' ink and the letter in pencil.
Dr. Â¦ Lowery came to 'Santa Rosa from
Missouri, where he Is said to have some
property in his own name. He is a great
temperance advocate. The alleged will to

there seems - little reason to doubt the

The letter accompanying the will states
that the reason the writer did not comply
with the promise she made to Mrs. Lowery

was brought to bear upon her to induce
her to destroy the will, as both of the
subscribing witnesses were dead and no
one would be the wiser. The writer, while
not saying that this proposition -had been
agreed to. leaves as much open to. infer

This conspiracy has been backed up by a
reign of terror In San Francisco. Everybody
admits that our men have kept the peace.
.They have been orderly and law abiding, under
bitter provocation.' Whatever scenes of disor
der have . disgraced Â¦ the ! streets of San Fran
cisco have come from those few low fellows of
the baser sort who have tried to fill our places.
Still the majesty of the law has been invoked
against us. The ' president of the Police Com
mission has been -the loudest and most voluble
demagogue in inciting to riot and * bloodshed.
He- has declared in stentorian tones that this
city is a scene of disorder. He had demanded
proclamations. He has even gone so far as to
Invoke the military power. He- has â¢ been" a
veritable bull of Bashan roaring on the moun
tains^ He brayeth like a wild ass of the desert
and no man regardeth him. Such is the man
at the head of the Police Commission. The
police have been placed on wagons in order to
strike terror Into the hearts of the locked -out
laborers and to advertise them as law breakers
and rioters. The streets have gone unprotected
in order that every delivery wagon with a. few
dollars' worth of groceries might have an ofn^
cer to . act as guide Â¦ and guardian : of new
comers. I Hundreds of special officers have been
mustered ââ¢ into service 'and Invested with- the
authority, of this municipality. - These men are
unknown and . irresponsible. â¢ No inquiry has
been made into. their past history or their fit
ness as guardians. of thÂ« peace. On the prin
ciple that any old stick is good enough to beat
a yellow dog with the alleys -and the â¢ by
ways have been searched- and the low lodging
houses have , given up their habitues to ter
rorize us, the working men of this city.: >j â¢
Lest they might 6hoot us at, sight- for the
crime of being locked out they were- informed
that we were not Filipinos by the Chief* of
manfl â "thou shalt Â¦ not organize." 'They are
ashamed of the deeds .of their, own hands. They
are ashamed to speak out for themselves. They
use as a mouthpiece an attorney unknown to
fame until this struggle brought him into noto
riety. These men know that they exist on us
and on our brother . tollers and I producers
throughout the State and hence they "fear" piib
llo opinion. Strong in the Justice of our cause
we are neither afraid nor ashamed to proclaim
our principles. â¢ We place our cause in the peo
ple of California. It is theirs to Judge and . de
cide. Public opinion is in our favor, but we
want the citizens of the State to speak out 'in
no uncertain tone and. to let our enemies know
that, under a free government, in; the opening
year of this twentieth century, they cannot at
tempt with Impunity to rob any class of their
natural rights. "Eternal vigilance is the price
of liberty" and if liberty is to nourish in this
State the sentinels on the watch. towers must
be continually on guard. ' -
According to the Summerland Advance
Courier, the companies \ taken into the
combine formed by the oil producers of
Summerland are the Marine. Santa Bar
bara, Eureka, Consolidated, Southern Pa
cific, Duquesne, North Star and Seaside.
The consolidation has incorporated as the
Summerland Consolidated Oil Company.
That development work in the varlouÂ» oil
fields of the county will be resumed during: the
fall Is as admitted fact, but which one of the
districts is to be the scene of the preatest ac
tivity Is not as yet known. It looks, how
ever, that the Sunset district will receive the
rreatest attention during the next two months.
Many of the companies having holdings in this
field are already planning to berin sinking a
series of holes &nd a number of the old com
panies will soon resume drilling..
The Bakersfield Californian speaking of
the outlook for development work in the
fields of Kern County, says:
Developments in Kern.
Twenty-seven wells were recently signed
with the Los Angeles Oil Producers' Asso
ciation in one day. The companies in the
association now own 450 wells.
Desert oil claims covering 17,650 acres
were recently filed in one day at the office
of the Recorder of San Bernardino
County. E. J. Scott and his associates
were the largest filers, their claims aggre
gating 10,400 acres. The lands are in the
Barstow district and on the desert near
the Los Angeles and San Bernardino
County lines. J. C. Turner and his friends
filed upon 6S40 acres. . - .
The Arbuckle Independent reports that
there axe six rigs operating in Colusa
County, the companies being the Colusa
Oil Company, the Chehalis Oil Company,
the Williams Oil Company, the Bear Val
ley Oil Company, the Herron Oil Company
and the Smith & Gorrill Company.
There is opposition at Bakersfield to the
proposed combine. The Californian sa>ys
the necessity does not appear for the sur
rendering to a central concern of the prop
erties cf the several companies to secure
a better price for the oil in the market.
"The raisin men and the prune men," says
the Californian, "worked out a successful
plan for disposing of their products and
Â¦maintaining prices without placing their
properties in the hands of others. There
is apparently no reason why the oil pro
ducers should not operate on the same
line." The Kern City Echo says that "It
would be little short of insanity for the
owners of land or leases to merge their
comparatively small interests in a colos
sal concern in the management of which
they would have practically no say."
Opposition at Bakersfield.
Within the last week the appraisers
have sent out letters of inquiry asking
the producers of oil to furnish estimates
concerning their lands, this being exclu
sive of the personal property- thereon, the
pumping jacks, tankage and apparatus
generally. Not all the oil companies have
sent in v responses. The reason alleged for
this, in some instances, is reluctance to
give . out . business secrets of the I com
panies. Waile it is true the pledge of
secrecy has attended these inquiring let
ters, doubt is expressed by some of the
oil men whether secrecy can be pre
served when the letters giving the Inside
information are accessible to as many
persons as are connected â¢ with the ap
praising committee in one capacity or
another. The present plan for combina
tion, based upon the pending appraise
ment, tshould not be confounded with the
original scheme for a combi nation upon
the basis of the maintenance of the iden
tity of all the companies, acting inde
pendently, with the important exception
that the products of all were to be
marketed by a committee. That scheme
has been laid on the shelf, seemingly,
and no progress has been made with it
for some time. The appraisement in prog
ress will occupy some time yet.
There has hardly been a movement in
California In recent years that has awak
ened more interest than the present ap
praisement of the oil producing properties
of the State, which has begun In Kern
County and will be extended to all sec
tions where oil is actually produced * in
large quantities. This is preliminary to
the Idea of forming a trust of the oil pro
ducers. Whether it will ever get beyond
the stage of appraisement is a matter for
lively debate whenever owners of pro
ducing properties come together to talk
about the outlook. The impression pre
vails that a combination would be good
If it could be based upon a fair appraise
ment of all properties and resulted Uj a.
proportionate. distribution of stock in the
trust among the present owners of the
respective ' properties which it. is proposed
to .combine.. But the question of what is
a proper price for land upon which there
are -producing wells is a difficult one to
answer to the satisfaction of all who . are
concerned. That habit of mind has char
acterized the owners of oil properties that
has led" them generally to believe that
they all have the choicest locations. Un
questionably there must be many tracts
that are worth more per acre than other
tracts. Also it is true there is a wide dif
ference in the value per. acre of lands in
the same location. How is the value per
acre to be decided? That is what many
axe asking. Â¦ ' v
