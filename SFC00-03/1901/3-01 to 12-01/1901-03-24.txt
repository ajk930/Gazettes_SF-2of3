Feaching young girls how to use the foilsTO MEET the growing demand for
artificial jewelry the process of
. making "precious stones" ha's been
greatly improved within the last
few years, and its further development
has enlisted the services of some of the
most skillful chemists.
The material chiefly used Is glass, but
it Js not the ordinary glass of commerce.
It Is prepared with the greatest care by
highly skilled artisans, for upon its clear
ness and perfect homogeneity depend the
quality of the Imitation gems, which are
far superior to the cheap grade of coun
terfeits that rely on silver backings for
their' luster.
This glass can only be made from abso
lutely pure quartz, or. better still, from
rock crystal, as quartz frequently con
tains minute veins of iron, which would
impair the clearness and color of the
glass. The bicarbonate of potash and the
oxide of lead. which are mixed with It
must also be chemically pure. Other In
gredients of less importance are borax,
which promotes the flux, and a small
quantity of arsenic.
The best glass for imitation gems cor.
sists of rock crystal, 32 per cent; bicar
bonate of potash, 17 per cent; oxide of
lead. 50 per cent; borax. 1 per cent, and,
a trace of arsenic. Carefully prepared by
competent hands, this mixture produces
a grade of glass which In brilliancy and
iridescence yields little to the genuine
diamond Itself, and these qualities may
be further enhanced by the substitution
of potassium for the bicarbonate of pot
ash and an Increase of the quantity ot
uxlde of lead used. .
Stones carefully made by this process
can only be distinguished from the genu
ine by experts.. This Is true, however,
only so long as they are new, for imita
tion gems wear off. become blind and lose
their fiber with age. and. .it is to remedy

Scientist Predicts Another Eruption of Vesuvius
Will Soon Take Place
Professor R. V. Matteucci. the distln-.
gulshcd Italian scientist and careful stu
dent of Vesuvius' vagaries, predicts that
a new eruption will take place within a
short time, and from various Indications
he feels satisfied it will be no light one.
He has considered it well to utter a time
ly warning, as experience has shown that
Vesuvius, . when it vents its wrath unex-
I>ectedly. does a great deal of damage to
persons and property in the vicinity.
Professor Mattered is no alarmist,' but
bases his prediction on the fact, which
he has noticed, that various new fissures
p.re now being formed near the summit of
the mountain, and this, in his opinion. Is
an unquestionable proof that masses of
lava and other matter will soon be again
belched forth. His close study of the vol
cano during 'the recent eruption confirms
him In this opinion.
Day after day he continued his investi
gations, often at the peril of his life, and
as a result the account of his work, which
Ire has Just forwarded to the French
Academy of Sciences, contains more facts
about Vesuvius than were ever known be
fore. He noted the daily changes that
took place in the crater during the erup
tion and he even measured the height
v:hich was attained by the great masses
of igneous matter after the mountain had
\omited them forth.

A California Girl in New YorkThe Part a Well Chosen Title Plays in Making the Book a Hit
o Is these days of the making of many
books, notably novels, the increasing
II difficulty of finding good, strong, at
" tractive titles is preoccupying the
minds of busv authors, and still more,
perhaps, those of the hard-worked literary,
advisers of the publishing' houses, for the
duties of these gentlemen are many, far
more numerous than the public which
accepts cr rejects tne novels^they select
for publication can possibly suspect. Not
the" least of these duties is' the finding 'of.
pood titles for good books, for not allau-.
thors have the knack to do this. It is of
ten a thankless task; your writer is gen
enally a sensitive being, clinging as fran
tically to a title that is bad as to his be
lief In a story that Is really good; but oc
casionally virtue finds Its reward in the
gratitude of a man who willingly surren
ders the meaningless name selected by
himself in favor of. a title that Ms sonor
ously alliterative, or ruggedly' strong, O r
felicitously inviting.
The tlt:Â« must fit the book, of courpe:
but when a title is found that, while ap
propriate, arouses curiosity or interest on
its own account, perfection is reached in
a difficult flfld. It is not perhaps too
much to eay that one-half of the 'English
and American novelists of the past an-1
present have lacked this form of Invent
iveness, and that of the remaining half
but few have been signally: successful.
Gcorre Kliot. did not nossess : the gift,
neither did Dickens, or Thackeray,"Van
ity Fair" being the exception. that proves
the rule in the latter's case, as "A Tale of
Two Cities." and perhaps, "Hard Times"
and "Barnaby Rudge," on account of the
ruggedness, in that of Dickens. George
Eliot made one deliberate attempt, it
would appear, and failedâ In "The Im
pressions of Theophrastus Such." ..-/Â¦:
Successful titles may, be roughly, divided
into two classesâ the absolutely, and the
.â¢datively good. The former arrest atten
tion even before the book Is read; they
give full promise of what the prospective
reader is to expect, but the' book must
fulfill the promise thus made. Â¦ The appro
priateness of the relatively good title is
only recognized after the book, has been
real. "A Window in Thrums" is an ex- 1
ample -of this. relative merit of titles, and
so is "Unleavened Bread.".
These titles are excellent, because 'they
at once attract the .attention and arouse
curiosity. Charles Reado, too." had this
knack, apparently so simple. ".'Foul Play."
"A Terrible Temptation," "White Lies,"
"A Woman Hater" and "liard Cash',', were
titles well calculated- to extract- the shil
lings from the pockets of a public avid. of
entertainment. For his best-known book,
however, he could only -find "The Cloister
and the Hearth." which really deserves
to be classed in the second category,' that
of titles whose excellence is Been. after ihe
book itself has been read.
Our own James Fenimore Cooper is an
other author who must not be overlooked
in the tionor list of novelists with a talent'
for titles, his having the added advantage
of being admirably simple.- "The Last^of
the Mohicans. â¢ "Pathfinders," .."Leather
stockings," "Deerslayer." . "The \ Spy'.' â
how directly these titles . must , have
spoken tothe readers of his day and gen
eration! There was no mistaking their
meaning, and the, prdmlse they gavewas
conscientiously kept. . '
Hawthorne stands high in ;thls : small
company. ."Twice-Told Tales." "Mosses
From an Old Manse," -."The House of the
Seven Gables.'; "The ScarleU. Letter,'.'
"Tfre Marble Faun," "Tanglewood^Tales''
are attractive titles,' alluring rather" than
explicitly promising; .with ', a, supremely
clever use of alliteration andâ¢ assonance,'
one of Â«. the great ' aids 'i of ' the maker ' of
titles. Anthony Trollope, ; too. had ? - his
happy moments in 1 "Can \ You '"Forgive
Her?" "The^ Way .We. Live Now," "The
Prime Minister" (how many English
Prime Ministers we have had In English
fiction lately). "The American Senator."
"The Duke's Children" (a Duke is always
asafe venture in England) and "Is He
Popinjay?" We may add here* for curios
ity's sake, the. titles. of four unfinished
novelsâ Hawthorne's "Dr. Grimshawe's
Secret,". Trollope's .''The Land Leaguers."
Dickens' "Mystery of Edwin Drood" and
Thackeray's "Bcnis Duval," three of
which show, alliteration.
There are fashions in titles, and some
of; them persist. Green's "Philomela \he
Lady, Fitz Water's Nightingale" and "Mo
rando, tho Tritameron of Love", of Eliza
bethan days find their successors: in Miss
RhoJa Broughton's "Red as a Rose Is
She," "Alas!" "Not Wisely^ but Too "Well"
and in that undercurrent of minor fiction
in which shone "The Duchess" with
"Beauty's Daughters,". "Molly. Bawn" and
"Airy, Fairy Lillian," and which reaches
low-water mark in such inventions as
"Sweet Sin," ."Oh. What "a Plaugue" is
Love" and ail their kind. ' â¢

of bhert stories. As the title implies^ all
the sketches are connected by the com

much variety that the little book makes
a reading in one sitting a 'pleasure' from

Mr. Sonnichsen's narrative reads like
the romances of Dumas for dramatic Inci

whole book, for it holds tho attention by
the crowding of thrilling events the one

merit as a story of adventure, but it oc
cupies the higher plane of r illustrating the
life and character of one of our most in

The Ess Ess Publishing Company will
focn publish In book form "The Love Let
ters of a Liar," by Mrs. William Allen.
They wera flrst printed in, The Smart Set
last September, and owing to their charm
ing style and fascinating "humanness" at
once attracted much attention. The social
prominence of Mrs. Allen In New York
and in the South, and the chargeâvehem
ently denied by the authorâ that they
were letters written to her by one of her
admirers. 'â¢ have made them a subject of
conversation In fashionable drawing
rooms. The New York World says: "All
the world is talking about 'The Love Let

not compare with 'The Love Letters of a
Liar" In brilliancy, knowledge of men and
the world, and Â»thelr daring."
McClure. Phillips & Co. will publish
shortly Edward H. -Sotheni's Prompt
Book on. Hamlet, as it was prepared fcr
his own successful production for the first'
time at the Garden 'Theater, New York,
on September 17, 1900. The publisher
have endeavored to . make thts tiook m
every way worthy of th* play and the
production. The format is the same as
that of the Mansfield edition of King
Henry V, which they published recently,
and it is printed on toned deckle edge
paper. Sixteen half-tones illustrates thu
volume, eight of which show Mr. 3othern
and Miss-Harned as Hamlet and Ophelia,
the rest exhibiting whole scenes* in the
play. The cover design is the most ela
borate ever attempted on a book of this
character, being a representation in six
colors on imitation Japan vellum of the
b'.rial of Ophelia, and is the work of a
distinguished English artist. The volume
is a narrow octavo, "bound In a flexible
board cover and sells for 50 cents net.

Maurice Thompson did not live to see
the dramatization of his novel, "Alice of
Old Vincennes." There is great pathos In
his. lea vine this world almost at the be

he had worked and waited. But his tal

Whenever an author scores a success
his earlv efforts are sure to be dug up,
however deeply they may be burled In ob
livion, and offered to the public, with or
without his consent. Anthony Hope re
vived more than one of his early novel3
-after "The Prisoner of Zenda" had
brought . him popularity, but in his case
there was no attempt at deception, and
the quality of his work In the earlier
books proved to be fully as good as that
of his later ones. . "The God in the Car."
for Instance, was published several years
before "The Prisoner, of Zenda." and
apathetically received. It was reissued

While their Jail was strong enough to
keep its prisoners from escaping, still it
would have amounted to a poor defense
in case of mob violence, and frequently
their lives were in danger.
At about 9 o'clock a mob of bolomen gath
ered outside the prlcan and amused themselves
by Jabbing their long knives In between the
bars at us. We were now alone; the native
prisoners had dlFappeared. It was bright
moonlight, and plainly could we see the crowd
of half-naked savages outside, the long blades
of their bolos flashing in the yellow light as
they flourished them , overhead. Again those
vicious cries of "Muerte! muerte! muerte a los
Americanos!" Then they tried to force our
doors, tut they were strongly bolted. Every
moment their fury Increased, and it seemed to
us that the long-dreaded climax had arrived.
But Just then in the veriest heat of the ex- m
citement we heard the trampling of horses'
hoofs outside, and. the next moment a mounted
officer dashed into the m!d?t of the turbulent
mob. laying about him with a heavy riding
whip and thundering out oaths in Spanish and
Tagalog. We could hear that whip whizzing
through the air. followed by cries of pain. In
two minutes the horseman was alone, glaring
about him as if seeking some more victim*
Approaching the bats, he shouted to us: "All
right: I told 'em; they not trouble you again!"
It was Pera. the Comandante or Military

Â¦\Vhat the author has to say about the
attitude of the Filipinos toward the friars
is not without interest or political signi
licance.
Not only do the Tagalos hate the friars, but
all the native* of Luzon. Ilocanos, Macabebes,
Mestizos, and even the Spanish soldiers regard
them as human birds of prey, and the stories
I have heard of their fiendish cruelty and cun
ning trickery 'would fill volumes and make a
fitting parallel to the Snanish inquisition.

have I heard a word in their defense, and the
native clergy unite In calling them oily hypo
crites and tyrants. There were, of couiss. ex
ceptions, for once I heard of a good friar who
lived In a small provincial town and as "cura*.
ruled his flock with sympathy and love, but
then he died. . " ; . . ''Â¦;"â¢
They were mostly of the Franciscan, Recol- Â¦
let, Agurtin _ and Jesuit order?; and, strange
to say, the Filipinos are not so averse to the
latter aa to the reet. The Jesuits- have -
founded schools and done less harm, ' but Â¦ the
Recollets seem to be the Â¦ nioet hated. ' I. have'

As Scnn'.chfcn and his party. were taken
almost the entire length of the island
they had an excellent opportunity to
study the different tribes. Here is what
he has to say about the Negritos and
Igorrotcs:
I had never seen a Neirrito before, so was
much Interested. They were not well built
and almost dwarfish In stature. Their skins
were coal black and their hair crisp and K.nky
like that of an African negro, but their heads
were better formed, I think, not being so egg
ehaped. They are practically primitive sav
ages, their only approach v to clothing being; a
cloth around their loins. Their teeth they file
to sharp points. â¢ â¢ â¢ The Ig-orrotesare by
no means similar to the Negritos, except In the
absence of ail manner of superfluity of dress,
barring a breech clout of the most economical
dimensions. Their straight blueblack hair U
long and coiled up loosely en the top of tha
head. Their color *is of a light coffee brown
a. J differs but slightly from the average Tata
leg. Mon of them are tattooed, some even in
their laces. In physical appearance they are
email, but well shaped, every muscle developed
!n f ytr.metrical proportions, and compare ia
vorably wltb the Negritos, whese legs seem to
have an almost uniform thickness from hip tj
calf. What caused us to wonder was the fact
that we fceldom observed an Igorrote who was
not leading a string of dogs. Inquiry revealed
the fact that dog forms the favorite dish in
an Igorrote bill of fare, and to obtain a gjfi'
cl-ncy they often come down to the lowland*
to trade horses, calves, goats, copper ore an I
even gold dust for curs that would hardly t>e

Considering the circumstances, the poverty

who really have come in sufficiently close con

are as entitled to be called civilized as other
nations, and even more so than some whose
representatives we receive at' our capital and

Any attempt at an explanation was useless.

LBERT SONNICHSEN. who was
/L\ quartermaster of .the Zealandia
jl when she left here on her second
expedition to Manila in IS??, has
written a very Interesting account of his
experiences in "Ten Months a Captive
Among Filipinos." The main : value of
The book lies in the fact that It is an
American account of a people and country
seen under the stress and" unfavorable
conditions of war and gives an excellent
idea of the character of the Filipinos. Â¦
Mr. Sonnichsen reached Manila Bay on
July 23. in plenty of time for the capture
of Manila, on August 13. when the Fili
pinos and the Americans worked side by
side to defeat the Spanish. He became a
member of the Utah Battery and the
American forces entered the fallen city,
while the Filipinos were forced farther
and farther back from the suburbs.
Aguinaldo had taken C000 Spanish prison
ers in conquering the territory outside of
Manila and Oavlte and felt that he and
his force should be placed on an equality
with the Americans, therefore when the
Filipinos were held back from the city
the feeling changed from friendliness to
suspicion.
Mr. Sonnichseri- Is a San Francisco boy
and his immediate companion through all
thJs trouble was Harry Huber, the son of
C. O. Huber, the well-known advertising
agent of Oakland. It will be remembered
"by cur readers that on April 22 last year
the first account of the thrilling and ro
mentic experience cf these lads was pub
lished in The Sunday Call Magazine Sec
tion. This was from the pen of Han-y
Huber himself and gave a detailed recital
of the terrible experiences through which
the boys passed during their period of
captivity among the Filipinos.
Mr. Sonnich^en, not being limited as to
Fpace. has treated the subject much more
fully than could be done In the pages of a
daily paper.
Sonnichsen and Huber were old ac
quaintances and naturally spent their
<-arly days In Manila together. They took
an active Interest in affairs, and being of
adventurous spirit, were Trilling to take
rifks in satisfying their curiosity.
On' Friday morning. January 27, 1S9!),
they decided to take a little trip to
Malolos. the capital of the Filipino repub
lic â this little excursion resulted in a pro
tracted tour of ten months. They took
â¢w'.th them a camera and endeavored to
pass themselves off as English newspaper
men. with the result that they were ar
rested as American spies and dragged
around from town to town and from
prison to prison over the greater part of
the island of Luzon. Finally their little
party was joined by Lieutenant Gillmore
and his menâ also prisoners. They were
all finally rescued by the gallant men of
the Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Infan
try, under the personal command of
Colonel Hare and Lieutenant Colonel
Howze. Bcnnichsen had managed to
escape arid so got word to the Americans
of the critical position of the rest of his
party.

Thus the time calls for a systematic pro.
test against the return to Orientalism
which has marked the last fifty years of
European and American thought, and the
present essays are an attempt at a philo
sophic rehabilitation of rational individ
ualism. They expound a view of ultimate
reality which might properly be called
harmonic pluralism. Their central thesis
might be stated to bo the eternal reality
of the Individual as person. This is
worked out in the three chief fields of hu
man concern â science, art, religion. In
the latter domain It leads to personal
theism, strictly, as against every form of
pantheism however subtle and toward the
complete christianizing of theology by
making this better express the teaching
and the spirit of Christ himself.
These essays present, in a literary and
untechnicai form, the main features of a
new system of philosophy, which is, how
ever, an organic outgrowth of the chief
historic systems ot . idealism, especially
those of Aristotle, Leibnitz and Kant.
The purpose Is to curry the pluralistic or
individualistic insights of these master
thinkers toward~a consistent completion.
The essays aim to refute and supplant
the monism which in various forms, ma
terialistic, idealistic or agnostic, has come
so extensively to dominate the thinking
of the century now passing away. These
monistic systems are all hostile to the
ethical principle that has been the root
and life of western civilization, which is
based on a belief in the Individual respon
sibility arising from each .person's beins
the real cause of his own conduct.
A work of considerable philosophical In
terest will be Professor G. H. Howlson'3
"The Limits of Evolution." and other es
says in philosophy illustrating the met
aphysical theory of personal Idealism.
Professor Howison i3 Mills professor of
philosophy In the University of California
and- the essays Â¦ alluded to in the- title of
his book are: The limits of evolution;
modern science and pantheism; later Ger
man philosophy (exhibiting the trend to
personal idealism through the self-disso
lution of pessimism, materialism and ag
nosticism); the art-principle as repre
sented In poetry: the right relation be
tween reason and religion; human immor
tality; its positive argument; the har
mony of determinisTn and freedom (in
cluding a new establishment of freedom
and a new proof of the existence of God).
Perhaps ther<Â» Is not another citizen ot
the republic whose autobiography would
exceed the direct human Interest of Book
er T. Washington's life story in "Up From
Slavery," which will be published by
Messrs. Doubleday. Page & Co. within a
few da vs. This is the work of a large
minded, forceful man who, by sheer
weight of character and energy, mads
himself the leader of a race. Twenty-flvo
years ago he, as a negro boy. slept under
a sidewalk in Richmond; now he Is known
as the founder and "head of one of the
greatest educational institutions of the
South, which has property and an endow
ment of nearly a half million dollars. And
not only that, he probably has done more
than any one man toward solvins the
"negro problem," and has given the great
est human document on the subject pub
lished since the war touching the civiliza
tion of the whites In the South as inti
mately as the problem of the negro. It is
interesting to recall that an honorary de
gree was conferred upon Mr. Washington
a few years ago by Harvard University,
this being the first one conferred by any
New England university upon one of his
race. Mr. Washington days his whole Ufa
has been one of surprises, and doubtless
none has been greater than the warm re
ception given his autobiography when It
began iU serial publication in The Out
look. He has stood as much as any man
for the good old Anglo-Saxon gospel of
work, and this new flood of praise from
his greatest fellow citizens does not turn
him from It. The serial publication haa.
it is said, brought about a large demand
for the .book before publication. This Is
the sort of a storyâ full of romance and
practical wisdomâ that will make one of
the widely read books of the year.

Having inspected the principal sources

labyrinthine depths. The descent was ac
complished by means of th^double-decked
electric cage, which at the first dizzying
drop through the black, grewsome shaft
precipitated us to the 700-foot level. Upon
quitting the car at this point we found
ourselves in a spacious subterranean ante
chamber, at Intervals In the walls of
which appeared the low timbered portals
of the various tunnels radiating to divers
parts of the mine. Entering one of these
we . followed its tortuous course for the
distance -of --a -mile,- when we suddenly
came out upon an Immense rock-roofed
fissure extending at a sharp angle across
our way. Turning into this strange ap

after a short, brisk climb came upon a

lies the chief significance of the new pow

it. is adapted in localities where ' fuel Is

within reason to expect that with the im

as time goes on the present maximum will
be much increated.
It is In its relation* to irrigation, how
ever, that the successful utilization of sun
power will excite the widest public inter
est. Mining Is an industry which flour
ishes in spite of all obstacles. There is no
country so far nor climate so " severe
there Is no peril and no expense which

noted that no lenses are used, but that the
heat is reflected from plain mirrors and
so centered upon th<=i boiler.
The reflector measures 33 feet across Its
diameter at the top and 15 feet at. the
bottom. It contains exactly 1788 mirrors
3%x24 inches in size. The reflector is set
in meridian like a telescope, the axis being
due north and south and the movement
from east to west. The boiler is tubular,
13 feet 6 Inches long, with a capacity for
100 gallons of water, and 8 cubic feet ad
ditional steam space. It is made of fire
box steel, covered with lamp-black and
other . absorptive material. * Before this
boiler is thrown Into focus its black cyl
inder is but an inconspicuous feature of
tlie novel mechanism which | stands f aco
to face with the sun. But when, with a
few turns of the crank, it swings into' the
concentrated rays reflected from hun
dreds of mirrors, it uuddenly assumes the
appearance of shining silver, or perhaps
of a great, gleaming icicle, and becomes
the irresistible cynosure of all'eyes. . Here
at last is the sun harnessed. A long pole
is reached " to 'the glittering boiler, and
soon begins to smoke and then takes lire
and bursts into flame. Evidently It is hot
up there, and this simple test carries con
viction on that point to the most unsci
entific mind. In about one hour the In
tense heat has "raised the cold water to a
hjgh temperature, evaporated It into
steam, and a pressure of 130 pounds is
shown on the gauge in the engine room.
For, be it understood, the solar motor is
not a sun engine- in the sense that It is
operated without the Intervention of
steam power, as the water wheel is turned
by the ' falling stream. The sun strikes
the mirrors; the mirrors reflect the heat
upon the boiler; the heat turns the water
within - the boiler into steam; the steam
passes from the head of the boiler
through a flexible metallic pipe into the
engine cylinders, and from that point the
process Is the , familiar operation of the
compound Â¦ engine, and. the centrifugal
pump. There 'Is nothing occult, nothing
new. Every boy has felt the concentrated
In the arid region as a whole is 70 per cent
and this figure would correctly represent
the proportion of the year in which sun
power could be relied upon. Making due
allowance for the hours of idleness after
sunset, 1400 gallons per minute, which
equal 155 miners" inches, would irrigate
about 200 acres of alfalfa, about 300 acres
of oranges, or about 500 acres of decidu
ous trees. Although there are large dis
tricts where water may be had at a depth
of twelve feet, that is by no means an
average lift, so that the actual capacity
of the solar motor cannot fairly be set
so hiirh. Its capacity will vary with the
lift, with the character of crops, and with
differences of soil.
The important consideration is that the
new power effects a complete saving : of
the item of fuel, since it gathers all the
heat for its boiler directly from the sun.
Water-pcwcr might be Just as cheap if
It were as widely diffused as the Â¦ sun
power, which unfortunately, it Ik not.
Water-power is being more and more used
to generate electricity for pumping, but
this can only be supplied by companies
which have made a large investment and
who then charge the irrigator an annual
rent of $iÂ»0 per horsepower. In addition
to this, the Irrigator must supply his. own
pumping plant, eo that his expenditure
for electricity is practically a total loss
as compared with sunpower. The natural
comparison of the solar motor is with the
windmill, since both are automatic, being
operated by the. elements.

will naturally be asked. It looks not un
like a huge umbrella, although this illus
tration should not be construed to mean
that the solar motor is a frail structure.
On the contrary, it is large and substan
tial, weighing 8200 pounds. But In shape
it much resembles an umbrella open a*nd
inverted, and Is so disposed as to catch
the sun't rays on the mirrors which line
its inside surface and to reflect both light
and heat with concentrated energy on a

The ostriches at the farm near Los An
geles surrendered one of their paddocks
to a mechanical engineer and a business
man from Boston a few weeks ago and
the newcomers proceeded to set up a
etrange device which casual onlookers
have variously considered a windmill, a
searchlight, a merry-go-round and a look
ing-glass of gigantic size and fantastic
design, but which proves to be a new in
vention of extraordinary interest and
wide sractical usefulness. It is the solar
motor, and it solves the question of ap
plying the sun's rays directly to the pro
duction cf steam power.
There were a good many attempts dur
ing the past thirty years, and. indeed,
more than a century ago, to make a com
mercial proposition of sun-power. Some
of the more recent of these efforts have
been announced In a highly sensational
way as likely to furnish power for mov
ing trains and steamships and even fcr
leveling down great mountains. No 6uch
absurdities have been associated with the
solar motor whSch is now attracting the
attention of scientific men smd popular
crowds at South Pasadena.
Indeed, nothing has been claimed for it.
The device speaks for itself in the modest
but Impressive language of actual dally
performance.
It drives a ten-horsepower engine from
an hour and a half after sunrise to with
in half an hour of sunset. Its perform
ance has gradually increased with each
day'e trial and the perfecting of details
and there is no reason to suppose that its
maximum ha* been reached, nor that It
wwl be with the present modeL At this
writing its best record is the raising of
1400 gallons per minute at a lift of twelve
feet. The average percentage of sunshine
heat of the sun gathered In the burning
glass held by a mischievous neighbor, or
had his eyes momentarily blinded by tho
reflected light cast from a hand mirror.
These principles are old and known to us
all. In the solar motor they are applied
on a* larger scale and made to perform
useful work in connection with the steam
engine and the pump.
Now that the thing is accomplished, it
doea not seem at all extraordinary that
we have found a way to apply a little of
the sun's enormous heat to actual eco-'
nomic uses. It marks but one more step
in the assertion of rr.an's control over the
forces of nature. Lung ago we harnessed
the winds and the waters, making them
bear our burdens and perform our tasks.
More recently, and far more wonderfully,
it seems to me, we made the subtle cur
rents of electricity the docile servants of
our will. Science long since demonstrated
that the solar heat falling normally upon
four square feet of surface during on*
minute is equivalent to one horsepower.
Professor Langley of the Smithsonian In
stitution recalls the fact, in his interest

in the eighteenth century Bernleres, a
Frenchman, and an English \ optician
named Parker each constructed burning
glasses of great size and power, under the
influence of which "iron, gold and other

those glasses was presented to the Em

WATCHES often suffer from
changes of temperature. After a
watch has been worn next to a
warm body all day it should not
be left over night on cold marble or near

contract the Â«nctal pivots, and, however
slightly, tighten up the works. The next
morning, for no apparent reason, one's
watch will be found to be losing time.
It frequently happens that watches are
slightly magnetised by ctatlc electricity
given off by the human body. It has been

This influence is, besides, more common
among women than with men. Persons of

usually to the catching of the delicate

car. The jolt must come at the exact
fraction of a second when the spring Is in

such an accident are rare. A watch should

The best household friend, in my
humble opinion, is a liberal supply of

full significance of that word "pure'';
for few articles of commerce are. more
generally adulterated than this Sam's
innocent-looking white powder. Very
little of the really pure article finds ,
its way into the home because borax
is not a proprietary article and the
demand has . sometimes exceeded the
supply. So it is mixed with various
ingredient's which destroy its virtues
in a measure, generally *soda, which
works havoc, with the skin and deli

It is always wise to test borax be

the bowl of a spoon, pour on a little
vinegar, and if it foams the least bit
return it to the dealer of whom it was
purchased, with a request for this
pure article or the money you paid
f cr the stuff. It has a liberal per
centage of soda in its make-up and
will not do the work of pure borax.
In . an unadulterated state borax
softens the water and becomes a won

There is something objectionable in

other unpleasant things which can

IN ITCHINGâ A friction with

It is unfortunate that our civil

about their pleasures and comfort
and so little about the foundations
of their health; that they should be
so partial to heat and so fearful of

digestion, nutrition, easy sleep, in
short, all the functions of the body
of day and night, are promoted or

impaired by breathing warm air.

Persons zvho arc susceptible to
frequent attacks of coryza should

then at Jack and rai'seif.
He who had thus officiously interfered
was a squat, broad-jawed fellow with a
eatyr's face, and I felt In some instinctive
manner that he was going to make him-
Eelf disagreeable.
In another moment th!s proved to be the
case, for with an oatn the tulip owner had
whipped round on us, and after' a-mo
mentary inspection of the bulbs thrust out
his fist into our faces, and demanded
something or other from us Instantly.
Jack and I glanced at each other won
derlngly, then at our challenging opposite,
who. growing quickly hotter, commenced
to gesticulate vehemently with both hands
under my very nose.
Extending fingers and thumbs, he
seemed to indicate the number ten: then,
closing them, he held up two separate lin
gers; finally, with reiterated passionate
gestures and a rasping oath; he held up
his ten lingers again.
All at once I grasped his meaning.* Out
of his twelve tulip bulbs 'tvv^o, had seem

my head Indignantly, held out open palms
to protest Innocence and commenced to
stammer in broken Du:ch to repudiate the
accusation.

our foe. a : moment, after whipped out a
knife and made some remarkably ugly
pusses with.it ver>\near our. faces.
On the instant- Jack, spread out both
nrms (he seemed* to think it was but. a
matter of a'/'maul" in goal), then, thrust
ing me back with sundry other i bystand
ers and .tucking ba"ck his' cuffs; cried loud
ly. "No knives, you, coward; drop it, or
I'll knock you down."
< Excessively at his folly (his
mother. y.-as an Irish woman, and Jack had
been born with a shlllelahjn his mouth),
I clutched his rrm and whispered; "Don't
be a confounded- fool;: the man's accusing
us of stealing his bulbs, and the thing's
serious enough * without your ... making, it
worse."
,. ."Oho!" sald : Jack; standing . hls.'^round,
not a whit abashed, "that's- the game, is

that he pjolnted to. the .Very . man 'who

Now this supposition had crossed my

Drawn by the prospect of amusement
we wound our way. rcentlng the sound,
Jn and out of a number of narrow pas
rages and across lifeless canal*, and
shortly found ourselves in what was
evidently the seaman's quarter, for in
the lurching gait of the strollers and
"wake" of rankest tobacco the race of
"Tarry-Johns'" was perceptibly betrayed.
A quick-time riotous music, such as
railors love, sounded in all side3 of the

other side a stram organ roared its

I was slowly repeating them to myself,
when my arm was firmly pinned into his
own by my companion, to whom scholar
ship was as anathema and "a row" as
the seventh heaven.
'â¢I say, this Is ripping." he whispered:
"I vote we go into one of these cafes and

Now It was all very well for Jackâ who
played football for the 'varsity and bore

to thrust himself Into Circe's den. but
'twas a totally different affair for a quiet

the unruffled mirror of books.
My companion, however. Insisted; I hes
itated and was lost.
Passing by the siren of the doorway
with a lift of his hat Jack led the way
through the green baize curtains into the
sanded hall within. Down he sat with a
Jaunty air as of a midshipman s..ore and
called for "schnapps." while I, timidly
razing about me. took stock of our sur
roundings. . v ;
The hall was cloudv with cigar smakc:

It was evident that they had just been
paid off. for money was plentiful among
them. and. judging from their brick-red
complexions and the pets they had about
them, they were probably East Indian
merchantmen borne from a long cruise.'
One had a wizened, evil-eyed monkev
perched on h!s wrist, a second a green
parrot, a third a minor bird, while others
were setting forth from bulging pocket*
various strange curios and cuaint com
modities of merchandise.
Presently the hum of talk grew louder,
attracting the" attention of the general
company. By twos and threes the crowd
thickened arcund the sailors: exclama

were momentaily laid aside, so that It was
evident some special object of curiosity

"Ay, the young Englishman's right; it's
that ugly black fellow's stole the tulips."
And at once, to my amazing aston!sh

ell about me. Some said one thing, some
another, but all seemingly fancied It as an
excellent Jest, and It was evident to me
that they were one and all chaffing the
man I had accused. "Old Mother S.," said
a cheery looking follow beside me with a
wag of his head. "Is always for the good

"Well," I continued hurriedly, inwardly
chafing at her impudence, "What I want
you to say for us is that I propose all
present should be searched, for we have
been accused of stealing, and that is the
enly way to have the matter cleared up,"
for I felt certain that notwithstanding
this most lucky diversion, so quickly ef
fected, we could scarce net away till the
bulbs were found, more especially as two
hulking bullies seemed to be guarding the
curtained exit.
Mother S. promptly translated my sug
gestion, which teemed to meet with favor
from the owner, for he at once commenced'
to discuss the matter with his compan
ions.
In order to quicken their deliberations
I stepped forward, and. pointing' to my

sign from the owner of the bulbs his two
companions seized me by the arms while
he himself commenced a vigorous search
all over my person.
Finding nothing gave a few letters, a
pipe and a pouch of tobacco, he grunted,
then handing them back to me commenced
to treat Jack in like manner, whose in
cipient protest at the Indignity of the pro
ceeding I cut short roughly.
Nothing, of course, was discovered on
Jack, so It was inow our opponent's turn
to be searched. After some shuffling about
he surlily gave way and surrendered him
self to the hands. Nothing,
however, to my exceeding chagrin, having
been found, I feared a repewal of the row,
but Mother S., again proving our friend,
suggested schnapps all around, for which
I willingly offered to pay.
The owner of the tulip bulbs still looked
dangerous, but the schnapps which Moth
er S.now handed round mollified the rest
of the company.
Having tossed down his. glass. the sailor
at once drew his friends around him. and
having gathered up the bulbs and various
other treasures departed, swearing a gen
eral vengeance and threatening Jack and
myself with the. police emissary.
When they had gone I. was at once for
following their example, but Mother S.',
with a soft and ogling eye. insisted that
we must first pledge her for having stood
our friend in a bumper of Hollands I hesi

I longed to be back safely at. the hotel
again. Just at that moment one of the
tiddlers passed me closely, by, so closely
as to make me turn sharply round, with
the result that he Jostled me slightly, and
at -the same instant I felt him press' a
scrap of paper in my hand.
I caught his rye: it was full of meaning,

very pleasant to the palate. Drinking it

Jack, meanwhile,, as I saw, had al.-o

the end of a cigar which the siren was
offering to him. Profiting by their ab

glanced at the paper on which, in good
English characters, was written, "Take

straight to the doorway. Jack's move-.

I felt the mole mark beneath the chin I

inflow of water. It seemed momentarily
to deepen, "however, and all at. once with
a sickening shock I realized the situation.

ONE of the most persistent delusions
pertaining to the uneducated coun
tryman Is that which physicians
have now got to Â¦ all the "reptile
delusion." It is a delusion which attaches
to people of the agricultural class. The
victim believes that he has .swallowed a
cnake. Usually he is sure he has swul
lowed the snake when it was a little one
while he was drinking from a spring. In
certain parts of New England for one to
laugh at the Idea of a victim of persistent
Intestinal inflammation having swallowed
a snake would be considered by the old
women of the community littie short of
heresy. Dr. W. von Eechterew of Ger
many recently wrote on this reptilian de
lusion, and he shows that the Gernjan
farmer and the New England farmer have
the same delusions.
In New England 'the orthodox remedy
for the man who has swallowed a snake
is to hang him up by the heels and place
a pan of warm milk near.his mouth. Then
the enake" comes out to drink the milk,
and Is caught by the waiting family. In
traveling through the rural parts of Xew
England one can find many a story of
people who "know" of such occurrences.

The usual theory Is that the patient,
who is most often of the lower classes,

doors, the details of the awakening with
the sensation of the descent of the cold,

to be a frog or lizard the explanation is
more simple, for it' is a matter of common
belief among country folk that' the spawn
of these animals, swallowed in the drink-'

Of course, the central idea of this jew

Salique, often make the jewel, whatever
It- may be, with direct reference to the
appearance and personality of the.woman
who is to'wear It, and this; opens up an
endless vista of suggestive and symbolic
possibility.
Then again the' jewel may be made

color, but very often the seml-preclouj

MR. BOWSER'S TRIBULATIONSNow They find That the Arc Lamp is
Inclined to Be Musical.
*-j|â SHE time may not be far distant when

,eovery, which results from much

W. Duddell. The arc, Â¦ of^cburse, :js\the
blaze of lisht which: exist; between rjtwe
sticks of carbon placed end on and be

Two different kinds of* carbon . are. em

the. carbon stick .is: made" hollow ' and' is
filled* with a powdery material,; whileiin
the^other kind the carbon is homogeneous,"
The* >fonner". type of ? carbon ; is' caiied

Now, the cored ; carbon arc : "po8sesses"no
musical soul. It is deaf to : all persuasion",
whereasithe solid carbon arc, he finds. Is
hke the mouthpiece > of a) flute, ready to
emit any note. â. The note -of ; the -flute- de
pends, of course, on' the length of the pipe,
as determined^ b'yi the (position of ' the fln
gers and the raising of the keys,* whereas
the . note . civen out ? by . the 'solid carbon
arc_ depends on" theriature'of a bypass or
"shunt" that fs putlacross the carbons. P.
Mr. Duddell," having'evoU'ed these facts,
arranged Â¦ a ': keyboard * of .two 'octaves,", iso
that be could play tunes.\In'demonstrat

THE grandest bridges of the Romans
were aqueducts, but. after centuries
of unrest, the* noblest conceptions of
;i architecture .were realized In the
Gothic churches. There;was little demand
for roads land" bridges,' "and 'still less for
aqueducts/ : Yet the monks did not build
cathedrals' and monasteries only. To them
we' owe ' the introduction 'Â¦ of flat arches.
The /Romans .had â¢; preferred semicircle
arches, which rarely exceeded seventy
feet in span. -The founder of the Brothers
of ;the Bridge? St. 1 Benezet. adopted for his
Rhone' bridge of 1178. at Avignon, elliptical
arches, "which had- their smaller radius of
elevation at the, crown instead of_at the
haunches. The famous Ponte Vecchoi at
Florence and the original 'Augustus bridge
at".; Dresden date from the' twelfth cen
tury. ,The aqueduct of Spoleto. which
looks as' if many, high and narrow win
dows had-.been cut wit of a massive wall,
is thirteenth-century. Gothic work. So- is
ihe Devil's bridge, near Matorell. In the
province of Barcelona, with its apparently
reckless pointed arch, which is crowned
at its weakest part by a heavy toll-house.
The builders, no doubt, understood that
the'load]dld;not endanger the* structure.
The ! eprlrigirigs of this "arch are certainly
of i antique origin, Roman or Carthaginian.
An inscription .of the 17C0. when the
bridge; was restored. , ascribes ; the founda
tion to* Hannibal." The' span of the 'stone
arch over 'the A<Wa; near Trezzo; 236 feet/
built under Barnato Visconti of Milan
in 1370 to 1377, (destroyed again in war time
in 14H>>, has not been surpassed yet. But
the piers were in general made unneces
sarily heavy, and many a bridge failed
because the Roman art of laying con
crete foundations between piles had not
been rediscovered from Vltruvius' forgot
ten architecture. French engineers first
used caissons and suggested iron bridges.
The first cast iron bridge, really e'em
pleted In 1779. however, and still standing,
is. according to Engineering, the well
known Coaibrookdale bridge over tho
Severn. The arch consists* of five ribs. It
found many imitators. The Pont des Arts
at Paris, with nine openings, and the
Southwark bridge of 1S14. with a center
arch of 214 feet and a rise of 21 feet, are*
fine examples. Failure of some of these
briges, however, brought another ma
terial to the frontâ puddled Ironâ which
helped us to suspension bridges. The first
specimensâ the Tees bridge at Middletou of,
1741; Telford's Menal Straits bridge; fur
ther, the bridge over the Danube at Buda

ably, supported by two rows of chains on

remarkably tine presentations at the
American at short intervals during this

â¢gave the first pan.tomime, "The Millers,"
at the same house October 1, on which
date the name of Armory Hall was temp

There was evidently a brisk competi

the American in the fall of '5?, for then
occurred the first reduction of prices to
the scale of 23 cents to a. dollar at- tho

that action foreshadows political persecu

that all considerations of personal dig

amateurish and after the first duet was

historical sketch of the growth of the
custom of exchanging Consuls between
the civilized nations, and outlined the
rights and duties appertaining to the of-'
floe of Consul.
In closing Mr. Foster said that the
method of choosing foreign officials abln
vogue under our Government savored too
much of the spoils system. The student
who studied hardest for such a position
usually Licked the "pull" necessary to
gain hlnwhe appointment when he was
prepared ~o fill its requirements. How
ever, he felt that it would not be long be
fore the American Government would
send only trained men Into the consular
service. When that was the case young
men would have an inducement to make
the preparation necessary for the peculiar
duties which be-fall the official in foreign
lands. '

BERLIN, March 23.â In the lower house
of the Diet to-day President von Kroecher
communicated the result of his audience
with Emperor William yesterday when
the officers of the Reichstag and Diet ex
pressed the Indignation experienced by the
members of their respective houses at the
recent outrage at Bremen. Hia Majesty
said to President von Kroecher that he
was sorely pained by the outrage because
It convinced him that since the death of
Lmperor William I respect for the author
ities had decreased among the people, par
ticularly among the youth. The Emperor
thought that everybody without distinc
tion should share In the blame for the
present conditions. He considered that
the press should be a potent instrument
In upholding the authorities, and he was
confident that the Deputies of all parties
would do all in their power to see the nec
essary steps taken to assure the full meas
ure of respect for the authorities.
A lively debate followed President von
Kroecher's declaration in the Diet. Herr
Richter contending that such admittedly
unauthentic statements of the Emperor's
words spoken without the presence of a
responsible Minister were unconstitutional
and had never happened before during the
last thirty years.
When Herr Richter began sharply crit
icizing the Emperor's words. President
von Kroecher called him to order. Herr
Richter said this proved the truth of his
contentions.
To-night's papers are full of references
to Emperor William's remarks.

SHORTAGE IN MILITIA
CAPTAIN'S ACCOUNTS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 23.â The ne*v
military bill will become a .aw. This an
nouncement was made by Governor Gago
to Adjutant General Stamans late thU
afternoon.. The adjutant general is great
ly pleased with the assurance that the
measure has received the approval of th<s
Governor since he is confident that It will
bring abouFa vast reform in the National
Guard organization- Its general effect
will, be' to modernize the militia laws and
bring them into accord with the laws gov
erning, the United States army.
I One bf the features of the new law Is
that it makes the Naval Militia separate
and distinct from the National Guard or
ganization to conform to the United State*
law and practice and places it under thÂ«
direct orders of the commander-ln-chief
'without reference to division headauar
ters. Under the existing law it Is impossi
ble to call a court-martial to try offenses
in the Naval Militia, but such authority
Is clearly designated In the new law.
.The present regulations prohibit''"" the
wearing of other than certain specified
medals, and hence the returning Califor
nia soldiers from the Philippines could
not. under the law, wear the medals pre
sented to them some months ago by^the
Native Sons "of the Golden WestrbThls
prohibition is removed bv the new -law.:.
Under the old law, wh*Â»n a member of
the National Guard enlisted In the,regu
lar army for service In the Spanisa-
American or Philippine wars the act was
equivalent to a discharge, and if an officer
were on the retired list he lost his stand
ing thereon by such enlistment. Th* r.rw
law changes all this, gives thÂ« militia
men credit for such enlistment in regular
service and provides for their full rein
statement on their .return. !:â¢ short ..hÂ»Â»
term of enlistment of a Nation*! "luanl^
man under the new *.Â» w amounts merely
to a leave of absence.
Under the new law a trained regular
army man will. not bÂ«Â» i'.;sbarred from ao
pointment as a gener.ij because he may
not have served the rjnuired time in the
National Guard. : i eBÂ£aH%i3&ti3Â£Â£f*fe' >

TheÂ» arrest to-day Is alleged to be a part
of their scheme. v Â¦
The charge filed against the Collector
created a tremendous sensation through
out the State and. the feeling as mani
fested between him and his opponents Is
exceedingly bitter. Just before his arrest
Collector Dillon said:- .
"I have violated no law or regulation
of the civil service and have not done
anything wrong in connection with this
office. My acts and the books of the office
are open to investigation at any time, anJ
I do not fear the results. There have
been some men on my force who have en
deavored on more than one occasion to
injure me. The action taken to-day i?
the outcome of their .- antagonism, but
there is an old saying to the effect that
'He who laugrhs last, lauerhs heartiest.* "
Dillon was formerly a member of what
Is known as the Geon faction of Texas
Republicans and was appointed as such,
but he attended the last State -convention
â¢with an instructed Hawley delegation. It
Is said that the Hawleyltes are making
an effort to oust him and axe adopting
desperate measures to carry their point.
The complaints against Dillon were filed
by well-known local Republicans, includ
ing: Messrs. Fink. Marr and Kitchens.
Some of them hold positions under tfie
Collector. The Assistant United States
District Attorney ewore out the warrants
and had tnem served on tbe Collector at
Tnls office, where he was' found by a United
States Marshal. He made a bond for hid
appearance at a hearing before the United
States Commissioners next Monday. Tho
Collector evidence-d no surprise at his ar
rest, but was highly indignant. He at
tributes it to the machinations of political
enemies and asserts that he can establish
his Innocence.

THE SAN FBAJrClSCO CALL, SUNDAY; MARCH 24, 1901.
ALAMEDA. March 23.â Mrs. L N.
Chapman is tbe one woman can
didate for election to office at the
coming city election. She has
been Independently nominated
for member of the Board of Education, a
position which ehe, as a mother directly
interested in the schools, believes should
be filled by a woman.
Mrs. Chapman and her friends of ; the
Political Equality Crub called at *, recent
meeting of the executive committee of the
Harmonle Hall Non-Partisan party , and
Inquired for "pointers" on how . to get a
nomination for School Director." Chairman
George. H. Perry enlightened the women
on thÂ« subject and told them how men
usually got In on the "slato" of a conven
tion. They immediately set to work on the
150 delegates to the convention in the ef
fort to make them partial to Mrs. Chap
man's candidacy and. their canvass was a
vigorous one.
The result of the work done by the
women showed itself in the convention,
where only a narrow margin of votes sep
arated Mrs. Chapman from getting one of
the two nominations. If they had com-,
menced to "do politics" Just a few days
.sooner there would have been a different
story to tell. But the UrnÂ© was limited
and it was something of a struggle to see
even a portion of the delegates.
Now Mrs* Chapman is going to try for
election by running independently. She
has chosen her campaign committee and
filed her petition and done air the things
that a modern politician does when he
runs for office. Her campaign committee
is making a house to house canvass,
pleading with the wives and daughters to
persuade the husbands and brothers to
vote for their candidate. The city hjÂ»s
been placarded and campaign literature is
finding Its way to everv voter.
"If you please, woman suffrage ; has
nothing 1 to do with my campaign." saya
Mrs. Chapman. "This effor*. to elect me
to the School Board is entirely apart from
the doctrine of political equality. The only
reason I am seeking- election . Is because
I believe a woman should be on the School
Board. Women are closer to the chlldran

SANTA ROSA, March 23.â Shortly after
midnight last night some one deposited a
girl baby about 10 days old upon the front
doorsteps of J. B. Reid's residence, a short
distance from town. Although Mrs. Reid
heard some, one open the front gate dur
ing the night she paid little attention to
the fact until her -ears were greeted a
half-hour afterward by an Infant's wall.
This afternoon it was ' learned that an
attempt had been made to leave the child
at the home of John B. Silva, a short dis
tance from the Reid residence. An - un
known man- pried- one of the ; windows
open, evidently with the Intention of plac
ing the child inside the front room. , The
noise awoke " Sllva's two children, who
were sleeping in the room, and their cries
frightened the man away. He. was seen
hurrying toward the front gate carrying
a package in his arms. There is no clew
to the Identity of either man or child.

Reaction Follows a Period of Activity,
and an Adjustment of Wag-M
Is Necessary.
LONDON, March 23.â The Speaker says
to-day there are unmistakable signs of
more trouble between the masters and the
operatives In the cotton trade. A period
of activity has been followed by a re
action, accelerated by the high prices of
raw cotton and other materials, a poor
demand from India and an almost com
plete stoppage of buying from China. Tha
Lancashire spinners and weavers have
held out longer than their rivals in the
United States or on the Continent, but
the rapid closing down of the mills shows
their turn is coming-. As the American
crop is likely to be insufficient even for
the reduced consumption, there is not
much prospect of low level quotations for
raw cotton to invigorate the demand for
yarn and cloth. If some agreement where
by wages may be adjusted according to
the state of trade Is not soon concluded,
declining profits will force the masters to
reduce wages.

.As an orator with eloquence to sway the

while Â¦ having an Influential uncle in

CURES MADE EVERYWHERE.
Every Form of Piles Yields to It.
In spite of the fact that the Pyramid
Pile Cure is so well known at a certain
cure for every form of plies,' there are
Btill many people who think a surgical
operation the pnly sure cure.
Hundreds of thorough trials In the
hands of physicians and patients have
proven beyond a doubt, however, that
surgical operations for plies are unneces-
sary, cruel, many times dangerous to life
and a relic of barbarism. The Pyramid
Pile Cure will cure any form of piles ef-
fectually and without a particle of pain
or inconvenience, at slight expense and no
danger whatever, as it is perfectly harm-
less. The way It affects patients who use
it may be inferred from the following
from Mr. E. Crook of Waterloo. Iowa:
Gentlemenâ I have used the Pyramid Pile
Cure and it is out of sight, the best thing
I ever tried. I think it has entirely cured
me. I have told Mr. Knapp. our druggist
here, about It and he has ordered some.
This remedy is a great thing for piles.
From Mrs. C. G. Spillman, Huntsville
Ala.: Not long since you sent my hus-
band some of your Pyramid Pile Cure,
and it did him so much good that I want
to write to you and tell you about it, as
he suffered very much and nothing seemed
to reach his case until he tried the Pyra-
From J. D. Roberts, Mount Moriah, Mo.:
I have used the Pyramid Pile Cure and
results have been entirely satisfactory.
There can be no question but that it is a
certain and lasting cure for plies, at least
It has so proven in my. case.
Miss Easter. Nunley of Tracy City
Tenn.. writes: The Pyramid Pile Cure
has done my sister more good than any-
thing she has ever taken. I have
nothing but words of warm commenda-
tion for it.
The Pyramid Pile Cure has become rec-
ognized as the only standard pile cure
strictly on Its merits ana. what it has re-
peatedly done In obstinate cases, both In
private practice of reputable physicians
and In individual cases.
It Is so cheap as to be within the reach
of all classes v of people, and druggists
everywhere state that' it gives, universal
satisfaction, which can hardly be other-
wise when It Is remembered; that It Is
composed of the best remedies , known to
the medical profession in treatment of
rectal diseases. It is prepared by the Pyr-
amid Drug Co., Marshall,' Mich.;" and for
sale by all druggists. - ::

THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Few Facts on the Same Sub-
We hear much nowadays about health
foods and hygienic living, about vegeta-
rianism and many other fads along the
line.
Restaurants may be found In the large
cities where no meat, pastry or coffee is
served and the food crank is in his glory,
and arguments and theories galore aa-
vanced to prove that meat was never in-
tended for human stomachs, and almost
make us believe that our sturdy ances-
tors who lived four score years in robust
health on roast beef, pork and mutton
muet have been grossly ignorant of the
laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do
than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind from bacon to acorns.
A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet? and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment in a
highly concentrated form and is digested
and assimilated more quickly than *Vege-
tables and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run down
In health and of low vitality should eat
meat and plenty of it. If the digestion is
too feeble at first it may be easily cor-
rected by the rejrular use of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal. Two of
these excellent tablets taken after dinner
â¢will dicest several thousand grains of
meat. eÂ£Â£s or other animal food Jn three
hours, and no matter how weak the stom-
ach may be no trouble will be experienced
if a regular practice fs made of using
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because they
supply the pepsin and diastase necessary
to perfect digestion and every form of in-
direction will be overcome by their use
That large class of people who come un-
der the head of nervous dyspeptics should
eat plenty of mea.t and insure its proper
<5ig-estion by the dally use of a safe, harm-
less digestive medicine like Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, composed of the natural
digestive principles, pepsin, diastase, fruit
acids and salts, which actually perform
the â¢work of digestion. Cheap cathartic
medicines, masquerading under the name
of dyspepsia cures, are useless for indi-
gestion, as they have absolutely no effect
upon the actual dipestion of food.
Dyspepsia in all its many forms is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest food
and the sensible vray to solve the riddle
and cure the dyspepsia is to make daily
use at mealtime of a preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which is in-
dorsed by the medical nrofession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples.

Tablets at 50c for full treatment.

Mrs. Dudgeon (cutting her. short) â Oh.

Mrs. Dudgeonâ Wake up: and be
ashamed of yourself, you- unfeeling, sin
ful girl, falling asleep like that and your

The Girlâ I didn't mean to. I dropped
off
The Girl (sitting up)â "What Is It?
Mrs. Dudgeon (threateningly) â Well,
why don't you wake up? (She sees that
the girlâ her nieceâ Is asleep and Im
mediately raises a clamor of heartfelt
vexation). Well, dear, dear me! Now
this Is â (shaking her) wake up, wake up;

Who that ever lived In a little New
Kngland village . can fall, to recognize
Mrs. Dudgeon? Her face "even at Its
best, is grimly trenched by the channels
Into which the barren forms and observ
ances of a dead Puritanism can pen a
bitter temper and a fierce pride. She is
an elderly matron who has worked hard
and got nothing by it except dominion
and detestation in her sordid home and
an unquestioned reputation for piety and
respectability among her neighbors â
phort of flat felony she enjoys complete
license except for amiable weakness of
any sort and Is consequently, without
knowing It. the most licentious woman in
the parish." Would I had space to quote
here the entire opening scene where by
action and interaction the traits above in
dicatedâher characterâ are admirably
brought out. But two or three speeches
must suffice. ;
Into Mr. Shaw's humorous explanation
of this paradox, lack of space forbids me
to go; to be appreciated It must be read.
Suffice it here to note that his construc
tion, as he so frankly concedes, is in
deed perfectly conventional and. on that
account, successful with the groundlings;
were this all. his play would not be worth
printing. What gives it vitality Is the
portrulture of three charactersâ Mrs.
Dudgeon, the Puritan mother; Mr. Ander
son, the fighting preacher, and General
Burgoyne. the aristocratic \ soldier â all
drawn to the life. In the most finished
stylo of dramatic art. - . .
Of the three plays In this book. I pro
pose to-day to deal only with one, "The
Devil's Disciple." As Mr. Shaw points out
In his sub-title, this pretends to be noth
ing more than a melodrama, and was
evidently written (for Mr. Mansfield) with
a direct desire for financial success. To
quote from the author's preface: "It
does not contain a single even passably
novel incident. Every old patron of the
Adelphl pit would, were he not beglam
ored in a way presently to be explained,
recognize the reading of the will, the op
pressed orphan finding a protector, the
arrest, the heroic sacrifice, the court
martial, the scaffold, the reprieve at the
last moment, as he recognizes beefsteak
pudding on the bill of fare at his restau
rant. Yet when the play was produced
In 1S97 in New York by Richard Mansfield,
with a success that proves either that the
melodrama was built on very safe old
lines, or that the American public Is com
posed exclusively of men of genjus, the
critics, though one said one thing and
one said another as to the play's merits,
yet all agreed that it was novel â original,
as they put itâ to the verge of audacious
eccentricity."
HEARD melodies are sweet, wrote
Keats, but those unheard are
sweeter-thls is generally true of
plays also. A few of the plays
we hear may be sweet, but
sweeter (that is, better) are the many we
don't hear, but which fortunately we can
new read, thanks to the passage of the
anti-piratical international copyright law.
To speak plainly, the proper place for the
dramatic critic, three times out of four,
is not in the parquette chair but in the
study chair; when occupying the former
he is doing little but help the theatrical
manager to earn a handsome interest on
his capital by giving him a free advertise
ment on Tuesday morning; when occupy
ing the latter he is at least engaged in
calling people's attention to something
worth reading, since he cannot discover
for them much that 13 worth hearing.
Look, for Instance, at the play b.iils of
the San Francisco theaters for the past
week: "The Colleen Bawn," a fair melo
drama forty-one years old â and what
else? Nothing! For Italian opera has
long since ceased even to suggest any
thing dramatic.
As we turn wearily away from the drear
prospect of this dramatic desert, the last
direction in which we should think of
looking for relief is Chicago, yet oddly
enough it is from Chicago there comes to
me this week a book of plays interesting
enough to renew my waning faith In the
possibilities of the drama and to make me
believe again, with Charles . Lamb, that
the theater is indeed "the most delightful
of recreations." For I defy any one whose
nervous system Is less stolid than that of
a mastodon to read Mr. Shaw's "Three
Plays for Puritans" (Stone, Chicago)
without feeling that life has a new zest,
that the possibilities of wit. humor and
fantasy are not yet exhausted; that the
soul of Sheridan has returned to earth,
that it is now inhabiting the recomposed
body of Schopenhauer, and that the com
bination is masquerading under the name
of Shaw. That a man's avocation should
bring to him the joy of reading such a
book almost reconciles him to the sad
task of having to go to the theater fifty
two times a year.
I find I have quite forgotten to tell you
the story of the Devil's Disciple and why
he was so called. Well, better, far better
that you should buy the book and readlt
for /ourself. Each play In the volume
will cost you but one-third of wbat it
would to go to the theater and will prove
thirty times more amusing. .

SHAW'S THREE PURITANS
and Their Place in
DRAMATIC LITERATURE.
BY this week-end we had hoped to
be the richer for the Sembrich
Rosina, Violetta and Norina, but
Ate unkind has ordered our oper
atic programme otherwise. Once
only. In her Incomparable Rosina last
Monday evening, have we heard this lav
ishly gifted singer, who was even then
seriously indisposed and who has been in
charge of the throat rpecialists ever since.
It is positively announced, however, that
she will be able to appear to-morrow
night in "La Traviata." "Don Pasquale"
will he given on Wednesday evening.
If Mme. Sembrich could sing as on last
Monday evening with a throat and chest
as raw as the proverbial beefsteak â a con
dition that the management curiously de
nied, by the wayâ it is open to suspect her
of almost impossible perfections. It is
the richest, sweetest, warmest soprano
voice that we have jet heard here, even
as she was heard the other evening, liquid
and clear as a bell, and used with the
brilliant intelligence only possible to the
â¢widely cultured musician. The lower
notes are marvelously full, having- almost
the contralto depth and roundness; there
Is one even quality from end to end;
while her range Is extraordinary- Mme.
Sembrich can act. too. Her Rosina was
rarely satisfactory from the dramatic
etandpoint, charmingly humorous, grace
ful and coquettish. It is a prophecy of
the other opera huffa heroines. Donizetti's
Jforlr.a, which we shall hear on Wednes
day evening next, and which is awaited
with much pleasurable anticipation. Th->
Saturday matinee programme has not yet
been announced, but will probably be
either "Lucia" or "Faust."
The first chamber music concert of the
Zech String- Quartet was given on Friday
afternoon at Sherman & Clay Hall, before
a. large and generously enthusiastic audi
ence. The quartet consists of W. F. Zech,
first violin: E. B. Lad a, second violin; W.
G. Callinan, viola, and A. M. Lada. 'cello.
The programme of the afternoon was the
Schumann A minor quartet, and a quar
tet by F. Zech Jr.
"The more the merrier," may be as good
& musical as a social rule, and this may be
a eufflclent ralson d'etre for another string
Q-uartet than the good one already exist
ent here, led by Glulio Minetti, but the
Zech Quartet hardly justifies Its existence
on artistic grounds. There Is a lack of
cympathy between the members of the
quartet, that first essential of g-6od en
semble playing, and finish, spirit and au
thority were'all wanting in the interpre
tation of the Friday programme. Neither
was the intonation what it should be, and
there were ragg-ed edges even in the tech
nique of the performance.
Perhaps the strain of a first public effort
of the kind accounts for some of these
things, and at any rate there Trill be
ample opportunity of Judging next season,
Â¦when Mr. Zech purposes giving a series
of chamber music concerts. It is to be
hoped that there exists here a sufficient
patronage of the rarer kind attracted by
chamber music to justify the existence of
a second series of this kind of concert.
A pleasing recognition of artistic Cal'
fornia by the authorities of the Pan-
American Exposition Is the engagement
of one of our most prominent local or
grariists. Dr. H. J. Stewart, for a eerles
of recitals In Buffalo during the exposi
tion. The recitals are to be given on, the
large four manual organ now being erect
ed la the Temple of Music and will taÂ«o
place some time in June, The engagement
may be regarded as a distinct honor to
the organist and also to the State, as
only representative players have been in â¢
vited to take part in the programmes.
Dr. Stewart's numbers for the week'y
half-hour recital after the vesper service
this afternoon at- Trinity Church. will be:
Overture, "Occasional Oratorio" Handel
Melcdie la E Rachmenlnoff
Andante la G minor (varied) Schubert
Finale (Symphonic Pa.thetique)..TÂ»chalkowEky
Concerning the orgnn recital. Some two
or three months ago I made a request
through these columns for programmes of
OT^an recitals that were to bÂ« given in or
about San Francisco, that they might be
â¢used in time to be of service to the organ
lover and the cause of organ music. I
have received but four programmes since
the request was made (not including the
Stewart recitals), and two of these after
tho eventâ from Stockton, by the way,
and through the kind offices of the or
ganist of St. John's Church, Lewis
Tcwaltes.
But does this represent the Bum of or
gan activity on the coast? If so, the cause
of the kins ot instruments is in but a
parlous state. Apart from its perhaps
nobler functions as an accompaniment to
the intimate occasions of life and deathâ
the birth exmg, the marriage hymn, the
death chant, the undertone of adoration â
the organ has another and wide mission
to perform In the domain of music pure
and simple. With its obvious defects it
yet has noble Qualities that distinguish It
from all other instruments â splendid and
unique effects, tone values and coloring
not otherwise obtainable, besides possess
ing the attraction of being still in the ex
perimental stage of its history. There is
also a rich Individual literature to which
the great musicians from Bach to Widor

them.
On Tuesday evening at Native Sons*
Hall the third concert of the, twenty
fourth season of the Loring- Club will be
given, under David W. Loring'e direction.
The club will be assisted by Mrs. E. F.
Schneider, soprano, a singer new to San
Francisco and who will make ber first ap
pearance at the Loring Club. Mrs.
Schneider is a native 1 of Copenhagen and
was for several years a pupil of Mme.
Joachim In Berlin, and later of Coslma
Wagner at Bayreuth. '
Believing that music is one of the most
potent factors in the uplifting of hu
mankind, the club has sought to provide
good music at prices that shall suit the
slenderest purse, and hopes in the future,
with the loyal support of the music-loving
public, to make these even more reason
able than they now are. It is a good
cause, and our good wishes go with the
club in Its worthy endeavor.
It will be remembered that the purpose
of the Twentieth Century' Club in inau

educational one.

still growing- in an ascending- scale of In
terest as the instrument itself is reaching
toward that limit of perfection that the
violin found more than one hundred years
ago. that the piano has but reached to
day. The value of the organ as a solo in

multitude,* its peculiar heart-reaching
quality, the largeness and variety of ef
fect, is well recognized In the older East
ern and European cities, where the organ
recital is one of" the most popular forms
of entertainment. It Is true these recitals
are more commonly given in the concert
hall, which is usually provided with a
worthy instrument, but they are by no
means strange to the church. Though we
have here but the Metropolitan Temple,
with Its clumsy and Ineffective organ, yet
in the churches we have more than our
share of good instruments. If these are

to call it, I ask again for a notification of

TO HIS countrymen Mr. Andrew Carnegie seems to have the appalling touch of Midas when
it comes to making money. If that were all he had he would excite the fear of all men.
Beginning as a poor boy, dependent on himself, struggling for what education he could get,
he has achieved success and wealth that dazzle and might distress thebeholder.
LORD BOUNTIFUL CARNEGIE.
That is the condition which the President desires to end. Count Cassini, the Russian Em
bassador at Washington, evidently regards the report of his Government's intention to seize
Manchuria as a fabrication, invented by the other European powers as a pretext for seizing terri
tory themselves. He says that Russia has,a concession for extension of the, Siberian railway across
Manchuria to Port Arthur, and that all she has required is protection of her interest in that con
cession. He] declared that agreement '-y|ith China would contain only two essential
features â first, adequate protection for Russian railway interests in Manchuria, and, second, the
If this be the extent of Russia's. demands their verj r modest proportions afford no adequate
provocation for the position of the other powers and they are no violation of the spirit in which
The Japanese press strongly backs the President's position. The Nirokee Shinpo, at Tokio,
says: "It will be acknowledged that it is the duty of a civilized nation to set a good example to
a semi-civilized nation. But what shall we. say when the proudly uniformed soldiers of civilized
nations in China have exhibited the worst possible example by robbing, outrages of women and
slaughter of innocent men, women and children? No wonder that terror and excitement among
surviving natives are so extreme that they are shocked by the mere sight of white soldiers on the
road arid run like frightened deer on the approach of the hunter."
President McKinley. has issued instructions to Commissioner Rockhill, at Peking, to the
effect that it is the desire and policy of this country to cease demanding blood atonement, and
to leave China free to administer justice to such of her subjects as have violated treaty obliga
tions. It is further conveyed to the other Ministers in Peking that it is the opinion of the Piesi
dent that China will remain in dangerous unrest until Von Waldersee ceases his punitive expedi
tions and his boasted battles, which consist of the slaughter of fleeing non-combatants.
But, other nations have dealt in a bloodthirsty spirit with China. Pretending to desire the
preservation of the territorial integrity of China, they have deliberately created the situation which
imperils that integrity. By the most fantastic and unreasonable demands for the heads of Chinese
Princes, and men high in public authority, they have made it possible for Russia, if. she choose, to
exact Manchuria as a consideration for protection against the bloody policy of the other nations.
If there be danger of Russianizing Manchuria, of provoking o war with Japan out of which other
nations will hardly succeed, in. keeping, the, fault will lie at the doors of France, Germany, Austria
and the powers which have compelled China to submit to one kind of disgrace in order to^escape
a worse. '
President McKinley has gone that far with China, and has nobly refused to go farther.
Missionary fanaticism has girded at him for not acting in a spirit of vengeance and inflicting un
discriminating punishment. But he has wisely chosen to treat China just as he, or any American
President, would have 'treated any other nation. In pursuing this course he has contributed to the
civilizing of China in the Western sense. The statesmen of that empire, especially the very able
and enlightened Ministers at Washington and London, and; Li Hung Chang, have asked, and with
reason, that their country be treated in that spirit, and through their influence have done all that
could be done to impress that idea upon the allies. . . ; '}'-, !;,
This has been the consistent aim of the President from the beginning of the Oriental
troubles last June. We could not have done less than we attempted and carried out in joining
the effort to raise the siege of our legation at Peking. We'wbuld have done the same if, ins-.ead
of at Peking, the startling situation had developed at Paris or St. Petersburg. If in one the
commune, or the other the nihilists, either by overpowering the Government or by the acqui
escence and connivance of some of its officers, had attacked our, countrymen or beleaguered our
legation, we would have thrown toward the point of danger, as speedily* 5 as possible, a sufficient
military . force to have vindicated our honor and rescued" those in danger. We do not think that
even the unreasoning critics of an American administration could have found courage to object
to such a course. We would also probably have insisted firmly upon the punishment of the few
guilty who may have represented the offending governments mthe ounages.

GRANTING that the world will:" be bettered and benefited by inducing China, in her inter*
national dealings and treatment of foreigners, to adopt the lnethotl? of Western civiliza
tion, it is well to have an eye to those methods and try to make .them equal to our
theory and our professions.

lot of parlor suits â seventy of
them â just from their own fac-
tory on the premises, made up
during the winter months. The
finest upholstering, too. It is the
richest and handsomest line ,pf
suits that was ever shown for
twice the money, $15 to $150, in
solid mahogany.
"Blessed be he who invented
sleep," said Sancho Panza. But
doubly blessed be he who sells
you beds to sleep in at such ridi*
culously low prices. All this week/
a new lot of bedroom suits will;
be shown. Over 100 different^
patterns â oak, walnut, maple ot
mahogany â at prices that na-
downtown store could think of
offering them at.
A blunder is a bright intention
with dust in its eyes.
There is no let-up to the ruri

new* patterns have just arrived.
A special lot of a new pattern
with heavy frame, brass rod and

The averaee Venezuelan will die and load
into a dump car 24 to 3 tons of asphalt In an
eight-hour working day aa a task, and it is on
record that some of the more hardy ones have
loaded as much as 8 tons In 10 hours. They
receive 50 cents per day for their labor, and
one ration, averaging in cost from 18 to 19
cents per day. They are fond of new rum, but
it is very rarely that they drink to excess. The
laborers at the Bermudez plant usually are
half Venezuelans, the other half being
West India negroes, with a sprinkllnr occa
sionally of coolies from Trinidad, who have
completed their seven years' labor contracts,
and do not care to return to the East Indies.
There axe rarely ever more than five or six
American citizens at; one time on the com
pany's premises, all of them being superior
officers, charred with administrative affairs.
A few scattering Indians now and then camp
about the lake, but they seem averse to com
ing In contact with their more civilized breth
ren. At present the New York and Bermuder
company has two chartered steamers under
foreign flags to bring up asphalt to their re
finery at South Amboy. - -
asphalt Is found In a lake and Is said to
be almost pure. The supply is practical
ly inexhaustible. The article reads:

The first finished. well in the Midway
district Is. according to the Bakersfleld
Californian, flowing at the rate of 200 bar
rels a day. After, the pump had been
worked a few hours pumping was stopped,
but the flow of oil continued. .
â¢The Union Pacific Railroad Company,
boring for water in Wyoming, gave rise
to an oil boom. Within the past two
weeks claims covering In the aggregate
6000 acres of supposed oil land have been
filed. These claims were mostly taken up
by associations of men in ttiuuha and Salt
Lake. The field is near Evanston. It has
been known for some years that there was
petroleum in that vicinit}'. but â¢ the pros
pect has never been sufficiently inviting
to Induce capitalists to engage in exploit
ation of the hidden oil sands.
The experiment of drilling a number of
wells of large caliber, going down only
from 100 feet to ISO feet, to bale and not
to pump, is about to be tried in the vicin
ity of Brea rancho, near Los Angeles. The
Idea Is that possibly the first sand. can,
in the way indicated, be worked profit
ably, even where a great amount of water
in the lower sands makes working imprac
ticable. The Southern Pacific Company ia

The Red Bluff People's Cause finds that
tho amount of wood consumed in~ Shasta

of oil as fuel -In the place of wood will
obviate that trouble, which is another
pointer concerning the benefits that the
oil -industry promises.
' The Bakersfleld Californian says that
the hydraullcklng process of cleaning out
wells that are Inclined to choke with sand
has not operated to the entire satisfaction
of the Kern River Company, which ex
perimented with the method in Its wells at
McKittrick. The effect obtained is not
favoraJale, the water driving back the oil,
a condition that can be overcome by
pumping, but a more serious result is
noticed. In elevating the sand and silt to
the surface, the larger stones and pebbles
are left behind and finally accumulate in
quantities at the bottom of the bole, and
are found to be so packed that they can
be moved only by means of the drill, a
dangerous undertaking-, as the casing is
apt to burst open.

The trouble otarted last July, and since
that time the country has not had the

were sent over private wires by brokers
or in private messages, or in newspapers
after the market closed. In making the
announcement President Warren said:
"The board f.-nd the telegraph compa

way satisfactory to the board. I do not
care torflve out the details of the agree
ment until the formality of signing the
contract.? has been observed. The tele
graph companies. will be free to send out
the quotations 'April 1."
It is understood the agreement calls for
the payment of an aggregate sum of $30,

to the board, the maintenance of rates in
the local field so as not to crush out the
Cleveland Telegraph Company, which has
been handling the quotations-, in Chicago

1, and -in the Plttsburg district, the lead
ing: iron. and steel center of the country,
over 50.000 employes in the mills and blast
furnaces will have new employers.
It is not tho intention of the new. cor
poration at present to make any changes
in : the management of the constituent
.companies, but it Is 'likely that new sys
tems of operations will be introduced.
Among the' concerns embraced in the big
steel combine 1, the : Carnegie Company
heads the list as to the number of em
ployes, and Is closely followed by the Na

Steel and, Wire Company. All are open
mills, enly those of the American Tlnplate
Company and t several of the American
sheet steel companies being under the Ju
risdiction of the Amalgamated Associa

wages paid being regulated by an annual
scale agreed upon by that organization
and the companies. The wages at the
other plants are arranged by agreement
between the workmen and the companies.
It seems likelv that thir system will be

Juardo was of a troublesome nature and
too quick to use his revolver. He had
served a term in Yuma, having been sent
from Jerome for an assault to commit
murder. He was a desperate man and
the community does not mourn his loss to
any extent. - The verdict" of the : Coroner's
jury has not been rendered, but undoubt
edly it will clear the officer.
On the way to jail, Foster released his
grip on Juardo for a moment. The des
perado took advantage of this and seized
a revolver from Foster's holster. Juardc
jumped back and half-cocked the weapon.
Foster, disarmed, yelled to Johnson.
"Look, he la after you." But Johnson
was too quick for Juardo. It was u
test of the skill of the two men in draw
ing their revolvers for action and Johnson
was the quicker. , The shot from John
son's weapon hit the desperado in the
neck, just under the ear, killing him in*
Btantly.
He fired a number of shots in the 'gulch
and intimidated Mexican residents. Offi
cers Johnson and Foster went to the gulch
when they heard the shots and got after
the desperado. They found him; in. a sa
loon. . Juardo, when he saw Johnson ap
pear, drew his revolver, but Foster, who
had entered the saloon by another door,
stepped behind him and Jerked the
weapon away - from him.
Juardo was an officer until a short time
ago, when. he was discharged for having
killed a man whom he was attempting to
arrest. Yesterday he started to '.'shoot
up" the camp and made threats against
officers. -v --, - '- - , Â¦' Â¦;

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PETALUMA, March 23.â Petaluma social
circles were treated to a tremendous sen
sation to-day when it became known that
Mrs. John Coleman, daughter of Dr.
Galen Burnell and his late wife, had been
.quietly divorced and had almost immedi
ately remarried at Reno.. So secretly was
it aJl done that even : the 'lady's closest
friends were in ignorance of the proceed
ings. The gentleman who has won t her
heart is Edward Smith, son of Francis
Smith of San Francisco. The divorce was
granted two weeks ago and preparations
for Mrs. Coleman' s remarriage began im
mediately, the ceremony taking, place in
Reno on Wednesday. The discarded hus
band is now in Bakersfield.
Captain Coleman married Miss Burdell
in Europe several years ago, while she
was traveling with her parents on the
Continent. Lipon their return to Califor
nia the couple -took up their residence
upon the vast acres of the Burdells at
Burdells station, south of here. Later
Captain and Mrs. Coleman moved to this
city and he was installed as superintend
ent of the Western refrigerating plant and
creamery, erected by a company com
posed of the Burdell family. Mrs. Colo
man was a leader in social circles and her
husband was no less popular. â . .

of Mrs. Coleman, several weeks agro, thÂ«
latter Inherited a large part of. the Bur
dell acres. One child, a little girl, had
.been born to the Colemans, and this little
one also -was given a large portion of the
estate. .The ice. and creamery plant hero
was bequeathed by the mother to James
Burdell, only brother of Mrs. Coleman,
and the Colemans again moved to Bur
dells station. Since that time Mr. and
Mrs. Coleman have often entertained their
friends 'at their country home.
To close friends it has been known that
the married life of the Colemans did not
run as smoothly as it might, but the sud
den climax came as an unexpected sur
prise.
The Burdells are one of the old Spanish-
American families that peopled California
before the influx of the gold seekers.
Through grants they acquired great land
ed property, extending from the Petaluma
Valley almost to the ocean and compris
ing an enormous portion of Marin County.
Their wealth and high social standing
make the romance Just recorded one of
sensational interest. . '

Broadwav and Twenty-sixth Street, New York,
I stated last week that I regarded soap as a medicineâ that it either benefited or injured the whole system; that the pores of the
body, take into the system more or less of the soap. I endeavored to show how important it is to avoid poisonous fats and strong alkalies.
I wish to emphasize this point to-day, and call special attention to the virtues of Witch Hazel as Nature's greatest remedy for the sldn.
That the public has found out the truth of this is shown by the hundreds of testimonials I have already received commending my \Vitch
Hazel Soap. I had no idea that the demand for.it would be so instantaneous â so large. Orders are coming in from every part of the
country 'and our factories are taxed to their utmost capacity to fill the orders. I feel confident that every cake of soap sold will sell many
more. The Soap is all that I claim for it. I want the people to have the same faith in it that they have in my remedies. Ten years ago
when I told the public I had a Cure for Rheumatism, they did not believe me. Time has proved the truth of my statement. To-day when
the entire country is stricken with Grippe, there are no remedies on the market having so extensive a sale as my Cold and Grippe Cures.
They are demanded because the people know from experience, and from the "say so" of others, that they relieve the Head, Nose, Throat and

f-TfSHE voyage of the French bark
I Commandant Marchand was not
I the uneventful trip that. Captain
IL Arneau made it out to be. One of
the sailors made things so lively on
board that everybody from captain down
was afraid of him. Finally things came
to such a pass that it was decided to put
the Bailor in Irons. Jack showed fight and
before he was overpowered everybody in
thÂ» crew, except the man at the wheel,
was engaged in the struggle. -
When tbe Commandant Marchand sailed
from France for Australia she had a
mixed crew aboard. | Among them was
Carl Rickards, a A. B. Carl be
lieves in having things his own way, and
came pretty near doing bo during the first
part of the voyage. After leaving New
castle. X. S. W.. ; Captain Arneau decided
that Rickards should be brought to time.
When the sailor became insolent he waa
knocked down with a belaying pin. but
Quickly recovering himself he knocked the
captain into the iee scuppers. , Several of
the crew went to the captain's assistance,
but none of them, were willing to tackle
the German.
A few days alter this occurrence the
captain and mate held a consultation and
decided to have it out with the mutinous
teaman. Rickards was ordered below, but
refused to go. The captain hit him in the
eye and the mate 6truck him under ' the
fifth rib. Rickards was stunned for a mo
ment, but was quick to recover, and mak
ing a rush at the captain and mate was
proceeding to throw them overboard when
all hands went to their assistance. A gen
eral melee followed and the end of it was
that Rickards was put In irons and fed
on bread and water for seventeen days.
Rickards shipped on the Commandant
Marchand for the round trip, and had
Captain Arneau so desired he could have
had him locked up ashore for insubordin
ation and fined him a dollar a day for
every day he was in Jail. On the ship's
arrival in France the fine would be deduct
ed from Richards' pay. The- captain would
not take any chances, however, and sooner
than take the mutineer home with him he
paid him off yesterday and sent him
ashore. Sailors are scarce and Rickards
will have no trouble In getting another
chip. _

fruit store of A. Cassini on the northeast
Clifford Hernemann, who, the police say.
Is a gay deceiver of women,' Is being anx
iously sought for by the sleuths of Â¦ the
"upper office." He Is wanted for big
amy, it being claimed that he - recently
married a young woman when -he -had a
wife living. Last night several detectives
were specially detailod to arrest him, but
beyond learning that he had given up his
room in a. house on , Howard street they
failed to get a trace of him.
Hernemann, who Is represented as be
ing 1 about 45 years of age, and who dresses
with' taste, about a year ago married a
young woman who lived at Newman, Stan
islaus County. Shortly after their mar
riage they came to this city and rented a
flat on Fourteenth street. Several months
ago Mrs. Hernemann suspected that her
husband had another wife and she started
an investigation. In some way Herne
mann became aware of .his wife's suspi
cions, and evidently scenting trouble he
packed his ajid left for â¢ parts un
known. Before leaving- he sent a note to
his wife admitting his guilt and pleading
with her not to have him'arrested. ' Mrs.
Hernemann lost no . time after receiving
the note to hunt up wife No. 1. '.. She found
her living in the Mission with her son
who is about 20 years. of age. The orig
inal Mrs. Hernemann was greatly sur
prised when she learned that her hus
band had taken unto himself another
wife. . . : ; , â¢ Â¦' â¢ :
She promised to do all in her power to
have her fickle husband brought to Jus
tice and even promised to specially em
ploy an attorney .to prosecute the charge
of bigamy against him In case he Is ar
rested. -
It is believed that Hernemann has left
the city for good, presumably knowing
that the police were after him. A war
rant will, be lssuedfor his arrest-to-mor
row and every effort will be made. to run
him down. .. V-

Sergeant Who Claims Lofty Lineage Goes
Unsaluted by Patrolmen.
haps, or a slight smile* as much as to say
"Well, even an officer as a man."
But alack and alas, while the gallant
sergeant mused thus pleasantly the four
patrolmen brushed past him, with never
a glance to show they realized in whose
presence they moved.
- Thunderstruck for "a ' minute stood the
man whose ancestors fought with Brian
Boru. Perhaps they had not 6een him.
Was it not a phantasy? But no. Ma
honey pinched .himtelf. . He was real.
Nor were the retreating patrolmen dim
shades, but too,- too solid flesh, who had
passed unnoticed as a petty malefactor
.the great Mahoney. It seemed like some
weird dream. But when Mahoney found
that they were "Cold Feet" George's men
the memory of an immemorial feud with
the north side Sergeant came back to him
and all was explained.
Mahoney Is attached to the Southern
force, but at the next meeting of the Po
lice Commissioners the four remiss patrol
men must appear befote the potent, grave
and reverend board to show rause why
a royal blooded Irishman andX.thelr su
perior officer should be treated with frigid
discourtesy by common patrolmen. **
TThose heart so faint and blood so slug
pish th&t his imagination does not kindle
at. storied page of the doings of one
Brian Boru and other royal Celtic war
riors of olden time? And who so slow
to do a descendant of these same war
riors reverence as four doughty police
men at the City Hall stationâ a, quartet
of patrolmen attached to the forces of
the redoubtable "Cold Feet" Georgre, to
Â¦wit. Privates Harris, Butler,' .MacLeas
and Merrick. who slighted in the afore
said manner Sergeant Pat Mahoney.
Sergeant Pat Mahoney is, as his name
suggests. Irish In all that that title
Ftaads for; more, he is an offlcer (and a
gentleman), but beyond and above all
this he can trace his descent from the
house of one Mahoney who fought Â¦ side
toy side with Brian Boru. . In a line as
straight es the ideal, or Mahonean, pa
trolman's walk. And yet four patrolmen
have slighted this son of the great.
The other aay as the descendant of
Irish Kings -was 6trol!!ng about j at the
City Hall who should he encounter but
four jolly patrolmen, strolling arm-in
arm, a la musketeers. Strict discipllna-'
rian as the sergeant is, he ha* been known
at times to unbend, and the sight of these
good fellows' jollity caused him to leel
txtra amiable. Maboney' anticipated the
abashed look which would overrproad
their faces as. covered with .confusion,
they would raise their palms to their fore
heads and humbly saiuie their superior
offlcer when they discovered him In their
midst. He thorght. with a pleasant cpn
descension. of how he would acknowledge
their respectful protestations when tfcey

During the last few weeks at least three
jewelry, stores- south' of -Market street
have, been entered "and property valued at
several' hundred dollars taken. Detective
O'Dea learned.; that one of the burglars
had tried to dispose "of part' of the booty
to a Third street pawnbroker, . and \ from
the description he arrested Davis. .When
searched at the City Prison, a gold watch,
which was identified as the property " of
a. Fourth street joweler, .was found in
Davis" possession. Shortly after this man
was locked up O'Dea arrested his partner
in crime and took him to police headquar

revolver and as soon as the detective
placed him under arrest he reached for it,
as if he intended to use it. O'Dea prompt

struggle succeeded Â¦ in placing his hand

The wedding was altogether Informal,
and under those conditions proved even
more impressive than 6uch affairs usually
are. The ceremony was performed in the
library of the home of the bride's
mother, Mrs. E. L. G. Steele, corner
cf Sixth and Jackson streets, Oak
land, and no floral arrangements or
elaborate decorations robbed the room, of
its homelike appearance. The , dozen
puests bidden to the wedding formed' a
semicircle round the happy couple and
listened in impressive silence while the
eolfemn binding words were spoken. There
was no best man and no maid of honor;
no white satin and no orange blossoms.
Just two earnest, loving hearts, anxious
to be made one. and their few. near
friends, eager to shower good wishes upon
them.
After the ceremony the health of the
newly wedded pair was pledged in spark
ling bumpers, and then Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas H. Williams Jr. slipped quietly
away "to hide for a few hours."
The bride made a charming picture in
her pimple gown of soft gray and white
foulard. The sÂ»kirt was made en train
and hung In clinging folds round her slim,
happy couple vowed to love and honor
one another "until death do them part."
The ground of the appeal will be that
Herllhy was not notified of. the = existence
of any charges against him and; was not
placed upon trial; that the revocation of
his license was the taking away from him
of his property and his means of livelihood

trait of Mr. Hallidie. He was of Scotch blood.
So am I. He cams to California In the early
days. We two grew up, a* It were, together.
He had a double share of Scotch integrity, en
terprise and noble qualities. For thirty-two
years he devoted himself to the affairs of the
university of this State. He was on the first
Board â¢ of - Resents In 1S68 and continued bis
work until his death. His work was a life
long devotion to the University of California.
As chairman of the committee of finance he
laid the foundation of the success ot the uni

economic management of finance and he con
tinued that devotion until he died. It Is now
my duty and honor to show you the present

President Charles Hays of the Southern
Pacific Railroad evidently Intends Intro*
ducing Eastern methods into the manage
ment of the company. It Is a method that
will not be appreciated by the - employesâ
for it means a cut in salaries. The men in
the employ of the corporation are on the
ruixious seat. It has reached their, ears
that their salaries will, be cut before the
end of April. The cut may come sooner,
and the new schedule of - wages may be
put Into effect at the end of the 'present
month. The men are now'discu3singthe
advisability of entering a formal protest
against the proposed action of President
Hays. "While such a protest might -have
but little effect, it will be presented, how
ever, if definite knowledge of the proposed
reduction is obtained by the men.
v The two offices affjectecT by the reported
cut employ fully 300 men. There are about
160 employes in the local freight office.
They were the first to receive "a tip" that
their salaries were to be scaled down.
They next heard that the clerks in the
freight auditor's ofttce were also on the
"books" and marked. for a cut in wages.
The men of both departments are now
waiting and watching for developments.
They will not submit to a reduction with
out a struggle, for they say that they are
now receiving less pay than their services
should command. >r^ -
While the men are not willing to make
public their grievances they are discuss
ing among themselves the best course to
pursue when the drÂ»ad day arrives. They
are certain that it is coming and they
feel that it is not far distant. It is known
that the heads of the departments in
volved have approached several of the
clerks longest in the employ of the com
nany "to sound them" on the matter.
These clerks have all answered that they
will not under any circumstances willing
ly submit to the proposed reduction. The
evident intention of quizzing these old
clerks was to obtain an insight. Into the
feelings of the clerks in the two depart
ments.
The employes freely talk among them
selves, but they do not express their feel-
Ings to the heads of departments. The
report sent back to the departmental
heads by the clerks approached Is to the
effect that if a cut lt> made it will not be
with the consent of the men and that they
will make an appeal for their rights.
Some. of the men are In a position that
would ordinarily, compel them -to remain
quiescent. They have families. dependent
upon them and feel that "a half-loaf is
better than no bread." But while feeling
this way they are willing to stand by
the decision of the majority and will
abide by the result.
It is expected that the matter will come
to a head within the next few days. The
strong feeling: evinced bythe clerks may

The college men were : outplayed. Of
them Gardiner did the, best work. . He sent
Hamlin and McKeown'home on a'two
base hit and made two neat doubles with
Hunter. Â¦ Smith would undoubtedly have
made a home run had he not been stopped
by McKeown at third. The latter miscal
culated Smith's speed and. thought he
would be unable to score. â¢â¢ McKeown in a
measure retrieved his mistake by making
a neat steal to second and letting Ken
nedy score. Van- Hal tren and Krug- did
good work for the firemen.* . v

that the matches In the opening round
of fourth contest for tho Council's cup
for men should bÂ© played not later than

H. C. Golcber beat TV. H. La Boyteaux I up
3 to play; H. C. Breeden won. 4 up 3 to play,

Breeden and H, C. Golcher will play tho
winner of the Tevis-Pagre matca. Tho

tween J. W. Byrne and H. C- Golcher.
There la talk of having at an early data
a match -over thirty-six boles between
Warren Gregory, H. C. Breeden, Captain
D. J. Rumbaugh and one or two other

For the first time in their careers Eg

battery of the Examiner team.- found
what It was to face hitters of the hercu
lean stripe and men who could throw a
ball in from the field without' working In
relays. , One . inning proved the undoing
One feature of the game was L. Honlg's
sprinting. He ran. so slowly to first that
the> '^spectators thought he was coming
back; - - ' ' .
None other than Jake Holtman. the
starter at Oakland, and Dan Mills, sport
ing editor of the Philadelphia Times, um
pired this marvelous match game. Both
are agreed- that it was more of baseball
than they expected.
j All this, and other thinga, happened at
the 'Recreation Grounds yesterday morn-
Ing, when the Examiner and Call repprto
rlal and art staff nines played for the
baseball championship of local newspa
perdom. The Call came upon the field
with.no record of defeat, but with no vic
tories uppn its baseball banner. The Ex
aminer had In a former engagement
trailed the Chronicle in Recreation Park
dust. This game was for blood, some thir
ty-two-year-old whisky donated ' by
Charles Newman, a keg of beer from Tom
Walsh, a demijohn of whisky from the
Davy Crockett. and a dinner, the ". bill for
which The Call Btaff will take particular
pleasure In paying. *
TWO men had come and gone their
graveyard ways-, Harwood of The
Call team was decorating the third
sack.' it was the last part of the
last inning of a most feverishly
exciting game; the score read. Examiner
6, Call 5, and Costello, The Call's twirler
and recent "also ran" ball player, was at
the bat. When Pitcher Matthies faced
Costello he was all a-trernble. A hit
meant a tieâ possible victory for The Call
nine,- â¢ probable â¢ defeat 'for-. t,he -.i^wuninpr.
baseball forces. "Costello was the real
Casey, at the bat. He struck out and the

SCENES OF THE BASEBALL GAME BETWEEN THE EXAMINER AND THE CAXJ, TEAMS AT RECREATION
GROUNDS. SOME OF IT WAS BASEBALL, MUCH OF IT WAS ROT, BUT ALL, ARE AGREED THAT THERE
WAS PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT.
By TP. E3. MUXiHOLLiAND.
EFORE an exceedingly fashion
able gathering of turfgoers, that
iilled the grand stand, trampled
__â_ the grass on the paddock lawns
and I'umped and jostled each
other in the betting ring, DAndy Jim.
a plebeian graduate from the selling
plater class, snatched the rich Pacific
Union handicap from Telamon and Can
more, the more aristocratically bred ones
.''nd greatly more favored in the speculat
ing realm, yesterday at Tanforan Park.
For all that, Handicapper Brooks of the
California Jackey Clpb. it being one. of
that organization's stakes, made no mis
take with Jim. asking him to carry 115
pounds to 120 on Telamon and Canmore's
127. It seems the booking fraternity and
public In general were more fooled than
Mr. Brooks, for as good as 20 to 1 was laid
about the winner. It appeared to be in
the air that neither Telamon nor Canmore
could win. for Pat Dunne's light-weighted
Benson Caldwcll, with Winnie O'Connor
and 103 pounds up, closed favorite at odds
of 5 to i The distance was one' mile and
a furlong, and as the field swung into the
stretch It seemed as if Caldwell had a
chance, but the stiff breeze blowing
proved too much of a facer for him. Can
more had all the time been cutting out
the play with ]J)om?nick on his back, and
as St. Rica, a possibility at fair odds, re
tired the Jennings colt was conceded more
than a "look-in." When Mounce asked
Dar.dy Jim the question. Canmore passed
up the lead as tjuietlv as a poker player
would the "bu<k," and while tardy Tela
mon was thn better horse Henry had ill
timed his move-, for the little plater won
by a neck in 1 :55. No bouquets were
handed over the footlights to Dandy Jim.
as Tuthill, winder of the race preceding,
covered the same route in 1:53%. To Can
more wenv the short end of tha *2000 prise.
It Was a slashing good betting affair, and
as. the winner received considerable sup
port the books were not benefited.
Only Two Favorites Score.
Only in two instances did favorites es
cape slaughter, the exceptions being Olin
thus, now a cross-country performer and
hurdler, and Billy Magrrane's Tuthill. Tho
books have experienced few busier days
since the opening of the season. Young
Dominick, the most consistent rider in
this, or, for that matter,^ possibly any
other country, carried off tne saddle hony
crs with three winning mounts.
Ridden according to the notion of Win
nie O'Connor, Articulate cut a curry
figure in the mile and a furlong handicap,
In his endeavor to concede a year ami
twelve pounds to Tuthill. When it be
came known that Articulate was to be
rated the wise ones got aboard Tuthill
at 6 to 5 and Domlnick won from start
to Jlnish with the Magrane entry. O'Con
nor moved up from the king row with
Articulate, downing The Fretter for
place honors. Formero was the only
other starter.
The educated coin in various denomi
nations cut the price' against Princess
Titania In the betting on the opening
scramble from 4 to 13 to 5. sending her
to the post equal -favorite with Moon
bright. Henry rode the latter and as the
odds, went up from 8 to 5 the mare was
dismissed from mind. She showed Inter
mittent bursts of speed, finishing among
the "also rans." Small Jack led to the
paddock, where J. Daly on the 30 to 1
cutsidey Sublhne passed him, and stalling
off thÂ«r tardy rush of Mounce with Prin
cess Titania. won by a neck in 1:14V4-
Tola, with O'Connor up, ran an indiffer
ent race.
Phoenissa Huns p. Superb Race.
Commissioners were busy planting the
checks about the ring on- 'Tom Ryan's
Fhoenissa to take the seven-furlong sell
ing event, and she did it: It was a superb
race and views of it at different^tag-es
would find ready sale with any^klneto
scope company. Vohicer and Alas were
cut off at the start and High Hoe ran
like a 100 to 1 shot. Boundlee, a 30 to 1
chance, led out Maggie Davis, the favor
ite, for place honors. Henry piloted Tor
sina with rare Judgment, getting In all
the pockets possible. It was a magnifi
cent contest, and although no records
were broken the distance was covered in
1:27%.
Only five started in the steeplechase
over two and a half miles and the favor
ite Olinthus. scored a decisive win over
May Boy. the closest contender. Worth
ington handled the winner, carrying 164
pounds, with excellent judgment, and al
though the Red Iron horse nearly made
a mistake over the ridiculously low water
jump he outclassed the others. Lord Ches
terfield and Periwig both came -to grief,
allowing old Mestor to get the show.
Enough money was lost on Wyoming in
the last event to fill 4 cold storage ware
house. O'Connor, to be consistent; suc
ceeded in getting away the worst of a
ragged start, and if the Eastern rider
leave* here with his popularity it's not in
the cards. Haviland. the third choice,
was never headed, finishing at the wire a
length ahead of Sir Hampton, with Wy
oming a busy third. It was the talent's
saddest fall.
No Chance for "Skeets" Martin.
LONDON. March 23.â The friends of J.
H. (Skeets) Martin, the American jockey,
attribute the refusal to grant him a
license to ride during the coming season
to the fact that Martin offended a promi
nent member of the Jockey Club by his
method of riding at Cairo this winter.
The papers are inclined to treat him len
iently, but the inexorable rules of the
Jockey Club seem fatal to his chances.

The college men were : outplayed. Of
them Gardiner did the, best work. . He sent
Hamlin and McKeown'home on a'two
base hit and made two neat doubles with
Hunter. Â¦ Smith would undoubtedly have
made a home run had he not been stopped
by McKeown at third. The latter miscal
culated Smith's speed and. thought he
would be unable to score. â¢â¢ McKeown in a
measure retrieved his mistake by making
a neat steal to second and letting Ken

good work for the firemen.* . v

There la talk of having at an early data
a match -over thirty-six boles between
Warren Gregory, H. C. Breeden, Captain
D. J. Rumbaugh and one or two other

of The Call teamâ the nasty thirdâ when
Costello's coils were % unraveled and one
infielder of 'The Call nine .committed a
baseball crime which merited capital pun

Examiner men dallied with the rubber

Then The Call staff steadied down and
the Examiner could do nothing with Cos

For the first time in their careers Eg

battery of the Examiner team.- found
what It was to face hitters of the hercu
lean stripe and men who could throw a
ball in from the field without' working In
relays. , One . inning proved the undoing
One feature of the game was L. Honlg's
sprinting. He ran. so slowly to first that
the> '^spectators thought he was coming
back; - - ' ' .
None other than Jake Holtman. the
starter at Oakland, and Dan Mills, sport
ing editor of the Philadelphia Times, um
pired this marvelous match game. Both
are agreed- that it was more of baseball
than they expected.
j All this, and other thinga, happened at
the 'Recreation Grounds yesterday morn-
Ing, when the Examiner and Call repprto
rlal and art staff nines played for the
baseball championship of local newspa
perdom. The Call came upon the field
with.no record of defeat, but with no vic
tories uppn its baseball banner. The Ex
aminer had In a former engagement
trailed the Chronicle in Recreation Park
dust. This game was for blood, some thir
ty-two-year-old whisky donated ' by
Charles Newman, a keg of beer from Tom
Walsh, a demijohn of whisky from the
Davy Crockett. and a dinner, the ". bill for
which The Call Btaff will take particular
pleasure In paying. *
TWO men had come and gone their
graveyard ways-, Harwood of The
Call team was decorating the third
sack.' it was the last part of the
last inning of a most feverishly
exciting game; the score read. Examiner
6, Call 5, and Costello, The Call's twirler
and recent "also ran" ball player, was at
the bat. When Pitcher Matthies faced
Costello he was all a-trernble. A hit
meant a tieâ possible victory for The Call
nine,- â¢ probable â¢ defeat 'for-. t,he -.i^wuninpr.
baseball forces. "Costello was the real
Casey, at the bat. He struck out and the
game was over. '

SCENES OF THE BASEBALL GAME BETWEEN THE EXAMINER AND THE CAXJ, TEAMS AT RECREATION
GROUNDS. SOME OF IT WAS BASEBALL, MUCH OF IT WAS ROT, BUT ALL, ARE AGREED THAT THERE
WAS PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT.
By TP. E3. MUXiHOLLiAND.
EFORE an exceedingly fashion
able gathering of turfgoers, that
iilled the grand stand, trampled
__â_ the grass on the paddock lawns
and I'umped and jostled each
other in the betting ring, DAndy Jim.
a plebeian graduate from the selling
plater class, snatched the rich Pacific
Union handicap from Telamon and Can
more, the more aristocratically bred ones
.''nd greatly more favored in the speculat
ing realm, yesterday at Tanforan Park.
For all that, Handicapper Brooks of the
California Jackey Clpb. it being one. of
that organization's stakes, made no mis
take with Jim. asking him to carry 115
pounds to 120 on Telamon and Canmore's
127. It seems the booking fraternity and
public In general were more fooled than
Mr. Brooks, for as good as 20 to 1 was laid
about the winner. It appeared to be in
the air that neither Telamon nor Canmore
could win. for Pat Dunne's light-weighted
Benson Caldwcll, with Winnie O'Connor
and 103 pounds up, closed favorite at odds
of 5 to i The distance was one' mile and
a furlong, and as the field swung into the
stretch It seemed as if Caldwell had a
chance, but the stiff breeze blowing
proved too much of a facer for him. Can
more had all the time been cutting out
the play with ]J)om?nick on his back, and
as St. Rica, a possibility at fair odds, re
tired the Jennings colt was conceded more
than a "look-in." When Mounce asked
Dar.dy Jim the question. Canmore passed
up the lead as tjuietlv as a poker player
would the "bu<k," and while tardy Tela
mon was thn better horse Henry had ill
timed his move-, for the little plater won
by a neck in 1 :55. No bouquets were
handed over the footlights to Dandy Jim.
as Tuthill, winder of the race preceding,
covered the same route in 1:53%. To Can
more wenv the short end of tha *2000 prise.
It Was a slashing good betting affair, and
as. the winner received considerable sup
port the books were not benefited.
Only Two Favorites Score.
Only in two instances did favorites es
cape slaughter, the exceptions being Olin
thus, now a cross-country performer and
hurdler, and Billy Magrrane's Tuthill. Tho
books have experienced few busier days
since the opening of the season. Young
Dominick, the most consistent rider in
this, or, for that matter,^ possibly any
other country, carried off tne saddle hony
crs with three winning mounts.
Ridden according to the notion of Win
nie O'Connor, Articulate cut a curry
figure in the mile and a furlong handicap,
In his endeavor to concede a year ami
twelve pounds to Tuthill. When it be
came known that Articulate was to be
rated the wise ones got aboard Tuthill
at 6 to 5 and Domlnick won from start
to Jlnish with the Magrane entry. O'Con
nor moved up from the king row with
Articulate, downing The Fretter for
place honors. Formero was the only
other starter.
The educated coin in various denomi
nations cut the price' against Princess
Titania In the betting on the opening
scramble from 4 to 13 to 5. sending her
to the post equal -favorite with Moon
bright. Henry rode the latter and as the
odds, went up from 8 to 5 the mare was
dismissed from mind. She showed Inter
mittent bursts of speed, finishing among
the "also rans." Small Jack led to the
paddock, where J. Daly on the 30 to 1
cutsidey Sublhne passed him, and stalling
off thÂ«r tardy rush of Mounce with Prin
cess Titania. won by a neck in 1:14V4-
Tola, with O'Connor up, ran an indiffer
ent race.
Phoenissa Huns p. Superb Race.
Commissioners were busy planting the
checks about the ring on- 'Tom Ryan's
Fhoenissa to take the seven-furlong sell
ing event, and she did it: It was a superb
race and views of it at different^tag-es
would find ready sale with any^klneto
scope company. Vohicer and Alas were
cut off at the start and High Hoe ran
like a 100 to 1 shot. Boundlee, a 30 to 1
chance, led out Maggie Davis, the favor
ite, for place honors. Henry piloted Tor
sina with rare Judgment, getting In all
the pockets possible. It was a magnifi
cent contest, and although no records
were broken the distance was covered in
1:27%.
Only five started in the steeplechase
over two and a half miles and the favor
ite Olinthus. scored a decisive win over
May Boy. the closest contender. Worth
ington handled the winner, carrying 164
pounds, with excellent judgment, and al
though the Red Iron horse nearly made
a mistake over the ridiculously low water
jump he outclassed the others. Lord Ches
terfield and Periwig both came -to grief,
allowing old Mestor to get the show.
Enough money was lost on Wyoming in
the last event to fill 4 cold storage ware
house. O'Connor, to be consistent; suc
ceeded in getting away the worst of a
ragged start, and if the Eastern rider
leave* here with his popularity it's not in
the cards. Haviland. the third choice,
was never headed, finishing at the wire a
length ahead of Sir Hampton, with Wy
oming a busy third. It was the talent's
saddest fall.
No Chance for "Skeets" Martin.
LONDON. March 23.â The friends of J.
H. (Skeets) Martin, the American jockey,
attribute the refusal to grant him a
license to ride during the coming season
to the fact that Martin offended a promi
nent member of the Jockey Club by his
method of riding at Cairo this winter.
The papers are inclined to treat him len
iently, but the inexorable rules of the
Jockey Club seem fatal to his chances.

Alfred Holland's Terrible Crushing
Poreseen in Vision That Came
to Bis Friend, David
Oakland Offlc# San Francisco Call,
1118 BroÂ«dway. March 23.
The horrible death of Alfred N. Holland.
the engine Inspector, who was fatally
crushed Wednesday at the West Oakland
yards by a locomotive, was revealed to
David Parker, a friend of Holland, in a
dream Tuesday night. Such Is the story
Â¦which Parker has told, and it is borne
out by the remarks of Holland as he was
on the operating table at the emergency
hospital In the yards.
"I -was xrarned that I would die to-day,"
said the patient. "I had a message that
this was my last day on earth."
Parker Is a workman in the track re
pair department. Wednesday morning he
met Holland, soon after the inspector's
arrival at the roundhouse to begin his
day*e duties. Parker called Holland aside
aad cald that during the night he had a
dream in which he saw bis friend Holland
c "JÂ«hed under the wheels of a locomotive.
The dream had such an impression
upon Parker that he eousht out the in
spector as soon as he came to work and
urged him to be particularly careful as
he went about his duties during the day.
Both men declared that they were not be
lievers in the supernatural, but some way
or another the circumstance had more
than passing Interest In It to the two
friends.
The men separated after their conver
sation, each goinjr to his daily routine of
Â¦work. A few hours later Holland lay '
crushed and <lyirie: under the wheels of
locomotive 122L Th^re had been enacted
In reality the scene which was so vividly
presented to the mlna of the sleeping Par
ker the night before. Friends of the dead
Inspector. Parker included, do not pretend
to attempt explanations. They know the
Btory. which is the subject of much dis
cussion In the railroad i-ards.

Shortly after noon. yesterday 200 fltters
up employed' at the Union Iron "Works
struck for a nine-hour day for,' the pay
now given for ten hours of labor. .The
walkout has been expected for some time,
but came In the nature of a surprise, as
the Union Iron Works people thought that
when it occurred it would . be general in
stead of being confined to one branch of
mechanics.
The Utters-up struck at this time for the
reason that there is a rush of work on at
that plant. The men have been working
on the trading vessel Alaska/the battle
ship Ohio, a ferryboat and the steamship
Spokane. They expect to gain their point
much quicker on account of the presence
of these uncompleted vessels. Their labor
is needed ana it is thought the Union Iron
Works people will concede their demands
on account of the necessity for the early
completion of the vessels. \ -
The fltters-up expect to be supported by
the other mechanics employed at th<j
works and claim that unless the'r claims
are allowed a general strike will follov/.
This has been expected at the Potrero for
some time and it is almost certain that
the walkout of these mechanics has pre
cipitated the affair.

Names on Union Bolls.
The Barbers* Union now has a member
ship of 1400 and is increasing at the rate of
100 a week. Since its organization in June
of the present year the union has grown
rapidly, and the members have succeed
ed in unionizing all but a few shops m
this city. They hive a so secir?d S f ate
recognition, and will ip^ue the c^rtU'cates
called for by the new law as -io<)n ;is the
Board of Examlnen are appointed. It i3
reasonably certain that the members of
the board from this city. will b-i J. R.
Blelly and J. J. Calish. The th'ul mem
ber will probably be appointed from Sac
ramento or Los Angeles.
The organization of the Barbers' Union
is due to the efforts of J. . R. Blelly, I.
Less, G. Barrett, J. B. Leonard, J. Schnei
der, M. A. Graham and V. ,A. Newcomb.
The names of these seven stanch unionists
will be placed in a conspicuous place in
the barbers" headquarters as a mark of
distinction.
At a meeting of the San Francisco La
bor Council held last night reports to the
effect that employers had generally
yielded to the demands of the council
were received. The report of the organiz
ing committee showed that several new
unions had been admitted and that their
delegates had been seated In the council.
The Shirtwaist and Laundry "Workers'
Union reported that the new schedule of
working hours had been accepted.; Tha
new hours are from .7 a. m. to 7 p. m.
The schedule also provides that the mem
bers of the union are to receive 25 cents
an hour for overtime. Three other union*
reported that their schedules for work
ing hours and scales of wages had been
adopted.
Blacksmiths' Helpers' Union No. 8922
and the Cracker Bakers' Union were or
ganized. An appeal to the various labor
councils throughout the United States and
Canada calling for positive action In event
that the schedule submitted by the In

not accepted was ordered sent out. Â¦ >

Circuit Court Clerk Hoffman and Dis
trict Court Clerk Morse have recorked
the quart bottles of ink that they had
opened In expectation of a grand opera
rush of Chinese and Japanese with $3 10
each to file their declarations of Intention
to become citizens of the United States.
Not a single applicant put In an appear
ance yesterday, and the overworked
clerks heaved a sigh of relief.
The Mongolian, as a rule, does not care
to dp a useless thing, especially' when, he
is required to pay a fee, and he is doubt
lessly aware of the decision rendered on
April 29. 1878. by United States Judge Saw
yer In the celebrated case of Ah Tup, who
attempted to become naturalized. In that
case Judge Sawyer said that the only
questions before the "court were:
"Is a person cf the Mongolian race 'a
white person'?" ; .,..-.
"Do the provisions of the statute ex
clude from naturalization all but white
persons and; persons of African nativity
or African. descent?" -. Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ -.
Â°T*jT ot T cfi ,'Â»f -the. Revised Statutes, was
quoted by Judge Sawyer as follows:
.â¢'Section 216&-The provisions of this title
shall apply to aliens i,oin K f ree white per
sons and to aliens of African nativity and
to persons of African descent."
Four years after Judge Sawyer rendered
his decision Congress passed -an act, ap
proved May 6, 1S82, in which the following
clause occurs:
Judge Sawyer in his decision mentions
the unsuccessful effort of Senator Sumner
in Congress 10 strike the word "white"
from the naturalization laws, and stated
that "the opposition to his efforts wai
based on the sole ground that the effect
of striking out the word "white" would
be to authorize the admission of Chinese
to citizenship. "It is clear," said Judge
Sawyer, "that Congress Intended to ex
clude Mongolians from the right of natur
alization." â¢ â¢ -Â¦
: "Hereafter no State court or court of
the United States shall admit Chinese to
citizenship."
Mongolians are defined to be the inhab
itants of Tartary, China and Japan, and
they are excluded by the word "white."
Notwithstanding the legal obstacle, Chi
nese and Japanese have taken out papers
of declaration for the purpose of evading
the rule of the military department ex
cluding from service In transports and In
the field all aliens except those who have
declared their 'ntentions'of becoming cit
izens. But this Is a mere subterfuge, as
the courts. will hold that only white per
sons and persons of African nativity or
descent may be naturalized, and that the
filing of. declarations of intention by per
sons of the excluded classes is an unnec
essary and useless proceeding and of no
legal effect. A Chinese or a -Japanese
who had filed such a declaration would
not be allowed to vote In any of the sev
enteen States in whicn "first intention
aliens" have the privilege of casting their
ballots for State officers, because the fil
ing of a declaration by such non-white
persons would not be bona fide or con
templated by the law. . ,
"Clerks are not judicial officers," said
Deputy Clerk Beaizeley of the United
States Circuit Court yesterday, "and they
are not called upon to decide whether-the
applicant is a Mongolian or a white man.
All that, the clerk can do Is to take the
declaration." Â¦ .< >
Declarations of Intention by
Mongolians Are 'Null
and Void.
California Theater's Doors Are Also
Closed for Three Weeks and
Oppenheimer Goes East
To-Morrow.
The chief topic of conversation along
"the rlalto" yesterday was the action : of
the ..Theatrical Managers* Association In
closing up the Alhambra Theater. This
association, after several meetings, de
cided that If the Alhambra â¢ was perma
nently closed It would boom business all
the more- for the other seven theaters
that now form the local theatrical syndi
cate. â¢ , Â¦*
Alf EJllnghouse, the lessee of the Al
hambra, still retained a six months' lease.
It was agreed to buy Ellinghouse's lease,
and $2000 cash was paid for It. The house
in the future will be permanently closed,
excepting for occasional benefits and at
times when the manager "of a theater
finds himself In the terrible predicament
of lending his house for charity. In the
future all these performances will be
"pulled off" nt the Alhambra. The rent
of the house, which up to Ellinghouse'a
regime was paid- by the Orpheum circuit,
will in the future be assessed pro rata to
all seven theaters.
Alf EllinghouEe was seen last night. "I
have sold my lease of the Alhnmbra
Theater ..to the Theatrical Managers' As
sociation," he said. "I had a six months' |
lease and they paid me cash to sell out.
I am . at Â» present only interested in the
California Theater. Oppenheimer is my
partner, and we will keep the house closed
for three weeks. .- Oppenheimer goes East

rlsh -blood in the veins of the scrotum,
due solely to imperfect circulation, and

a slnele case. Gran-Solvent heals tha
Prostate and restores healthy circulation.
Varicocele disappears and the sluÂ«rlsh
accumulation Is replaced by pure,

from ' the north that E. ' J. Baldwin, the
man on whom fortune loves to smile. Is
again on the road to wealth. A strike
that promises to be fabulously rich was
recently made on ! the property of the
Wild Goose Trading and Exploration
I Company, of which .Charles. "D. Lane is
j the. principal stockholder. The. holdings of
the company are : located in the Anvil
Creek district and adjoin the claims that
were staked by "Lucky" Baldwin. There
is every reason to believe that the rich
vein extends through Baldwin's claims. .:
The man of luck went north last year,
against the protestations of his friends,
and staked ' several claims in the Anvil

The Eschscholtzlas.
Owing to the boundless wealth and un
exampled prosperity of the nation the
tax for the maintenance of veterans Â¦ Is
hardly perceptible and every State in'tha
Union that supports a home for the vet
erans is fulfilling the promise made by
Abraham Lincoln that the men who
fought to preserve the Union should be
cared for In their declining years. â¢ =
On March 20. 1900, the number of vet
erans actually present at the home in
Napa County was 673. On ' March 20 of
this year the number present was .733. The
entire membership, embracine the vet
erans present and absent, was 762 m
March, 1900. At the present time the mem
bership 4s 820. Of the number present 170
must be cared for in the hospittal. From
year to year until 1905 the. demands upon
the hospital will increase. *
While the whole number of veterans is
decreasing: at a rate exceeding 30,000 1 a
year the maximum of those attaining the
afre of C2 years will not be reached until
1905.
In ,1900 the number cf survivors wa<?
997,339. It is calculated that in 1905 there
will be living, 82S.6S7 veterans, of whom
106.000 will have attainea the age of 62
years.
Among the bills before Governor Gai^e
are two that relate to the Veterans' Home
of California. It . is estimated that the
number of veterans to be cared for In the
homes throughout the United States will
gradually increase until 1905 ' and there
after the attendance will annually dimin.
lsh until the last survfvor of the Civil
War passes away. â¢

Captain Cosullch of the Austrian steam
ship Marlanna. broke the rules ef thÂ« Im
migration Bureau a few days ago and was
haled before United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. â¢ It appears that the
captain paid off four of his crew and put
them ashore without ' first having: the men
passed by the Immigration officer. Yes
terday the Austrian Consul appeared be
fore the Commissioner and explained that
the breach of the United States laws was
due- to the advice he grave Captain Cosu
llch. Thinking that only Immigrants were
subject to Inspection, he told the captain
to pay the men off. and he did. After the
explanation of Consul Korbel the casÂ»
against the captain was withdrawn.

was carried en in the nock market, is an lm
rwFfive demonstration of the new scope of the

Business In railroad bonds continues large,
the speculative issues being the favorites. But
bond dealers report some disposition on the
pert of customers to sell high-grade bonds and
reinvest In railroad stocks with good dividend
prospects. - - - --
The strength of the sterling market In spite
of the continued large trade balance In our
favor Is conclusive evidence of the continued
employment of American capital in foreign
markets and shows that our capital will par
ticipate either directly or Indirectly In the
coming British war loan. The prospective
drain upon the money market of the Govern
ment's collections of surplus revenue Is bound
to receive attention. In \-lew of the large re
quirement*. Disbursements for pensions have
reached the high level for the month during
the past week and will now progressively de
cline. Yet the revenue requirements nave been
Rfi large as to have absorbed nearly $1,000,000.
Owing to the unprecedently high prices for
Government bonds the Secretary of the Treas
ury expresses his disinclination to buy bonds,
which is the only method open to him to re
lieve the money market. But there Is a feel-
Ing of confidence In Wall street that any ac
tual utringency in the money market would
Irduce action by the Treasury Department.
Confidence- In the strength of the general busi
ness situation and the substantial basis of the
country's prosperity broadly underlies the se
curity market and overrides . fear of conse
quences from technical considerations, such as
overextenslon of speculation and undue -exten
sion of credits, which might go to Inflation
of values.
ccme. There was some renewal of the realis
ing here and there, but the closing was ani
mated and the undertone strong, with prices
n<ar l**t. A number of Influences combined
to precipitate a very active i>peculat*on for
the rise with the opening for the week and a
heavy speculative profit taking had been well
nbsorbed by the growing new demand, so that
the general strength of the market has been
well sustained. L,aÂ»-t Saturday's bank Ftate
mÂ«nt, with Its record of loan contraction, was
interpreted to mean that the large syndicate
fc< rrcwers for the various consolidation and ab
sorption plans were In a position to liquidate
l< ans to offset any encroachment upon money
market resources Irom other sources. The con
test for control of Burlington apparently con
tinued and was supplemented by excited spec
ulative buying of stock. By Tuesday afternoon
the speculative profit taking had overborne the
force of the buying and Wednesday taw some
erarp reactions. But new points of strength
developed and rallied the market. The buoy
ancy of a number of minor railroad stocks
gave color to reports that the process cf ab
sorption and combination In the Interests of the
larger railroad systems was still actively pro
ceeding. Many stocks with . a comparatively
short hii<tory owing to reorganizations in re
cent years touched higher prices than any
previous records and others went higher than
fr.r tome year*. Louievllle and Nashville and
Missouri Pacific crossed par for the first time
in the new generation. Missouri- Pacific Is
pointed to as a unique example of a non
dividend paying railroad stock selling above
I-ar. There Is a conviction in Wall street that
this property Is to b* made the center of a
far-reaching consolidation of Southwestern rail
roads. The heavy buying of Wabash securities
remained something of a mystery and It Is
attributed to various other railroads, including
Missouri Pacific Interests. The concurrent
strength of several of the Junior Vanderbilt
stocks gives plausibility to a supposition that
Wabash may be involved In places concerning
them. The notable strength of the Eries was
accompanied by many rumors of plans for ex
tensive rehabilitation of the property, promis
ing large profits available for distribution as
dividends. Such possibilities as were perceived
of unfavorable developments in the situation
were kept In the background, as Is usual In
a period of speculative enthusiasm In Wall
street. During the midweek reaction some con
sideration was given to the threatening Anglo-
IlL.ssi.in difficulty at Tientsin and the* failure
cf negotiations for peace In South Africa was
df-pressing the foreign markets. The announce
ment that an agreement had been reached be
tr.-een Russia and Great Britain was an influ
ence in rallying the market. The prospective
developments In the money market and a rise
in the call loan rate received some attention.
Put considering the magnitude of the week's
financial transactions and the comparatively
rmall effect speculators adopted an optimistic
view of the outlook and they were encouraged
by assurance* from the capitalists concerned
In great syndicate arrangements In their con
fidence In the safety of the situation. The
payment last week of 120.000.000 in dividends
by the Standard Oil Company and this week
of a $10,000,000 Installment on the $40,000,000 sub
scription to the new Union Pacific convertible
t<.nd Issue and the call for a $25,000,000 payment
en Mondr.y of the syndicate's subscription ot
?2<X).000.000 to the steel merger were regarded as
emple tests of the condition of the money
market and of the nice adjustment of thjj
plans of the great syndicates to their respect
ive needs. This adjustment and equipoise Is,
In fact, the key to the whole situation, as has
been previously pointed out.

NEW YORK. March 23.â The weekly state
ment of the averages of the Associated ' Banks
Is as follows: Loans, $910,779,100, decrease $4.
033.C00; deposits. $1,000,458,300, decrease $5,277,-'
300; circulation. $31,525,100, decrease $60,5000;
legal tenders, $71,898,700. decrease $222,200; specie,
tl88.4S8,3CO, decrease $939,800; total reserve, $260,
387.000, decrease $1,162,000; reserve require
ments; $250.114,o75. decrease $1,431,825; surplus
reserve, $10,272,425, increase $269,825.
The Financier says: The continued contrac
tion of deposit liabilities, mounting during the
current week to $65,727,300, is lessening the
amount of reserve which the New York banks
are required to carry, and therefore the steady
loss of cash Is not affecting materially the
total of surplus reserve. In fact the decrease
of $1,162,000 In cash holdings for the six days
ending Saturday was | more than offset by the"
process mentioned and the surplus reserve
made an actual gain of $269, S25, compared with
the last previous week's exhibit. The totals
In this respect do ; not agree with unofficial
estimates of money movements, the. lose hav
ing been placed at not more than one -tenth
that actually reported. Operations with the
Treasury resulted In a loss of nearly one mil
lion, but this was minimized by gains from the
Interior. The actual position of the banks is
probably stronger than shown by Saturday's
report of averages. The changes in the items
of loans and deposit* are traceable directly to
several large Institutions concerned in pending
deals of magnitude and therefore are of only
temporary importance. The principal factor at
this time centers In the movements of money,
which are of rather contradictory character.
The Treasury continues to gain from the banks,
although, as pointed out last week, the losses
thus occasioned should grow smaller from this
time on. Some attention was attracted during
the week to foreign exchange, whclh grew
stronger and preliminary talk of gold exports In
the face of an enormous trade balance was not
lacking. This view, however, seemed unfound
ed, as the variation of lntere'st rates here and
abroad led to technical advances tJmt will ad
just themselves automatically. It will be seen,'
however, that the demands to which the New
York banks arc subject are not growing less
and where one reason for easier money can
be advanced others quite as logical . can be
offered on the other side of the question. Con
servative Interests look for no great changes
In the market. Interior points seem well sup
plied with funds and are seeking commercial
paper here. The consummation of the steel
deal will require heavy payments at the be-
Klnnlng of the current week, but this is a
shifting process more than anything else and
Is not likely to create much disturbance. The
banks so far this month have decreased their
deposits $12,OOO.CCO; loans $4,600,000 and 'cash
holdings .$7,500,000, while excess reserve has
fallen $4.coo,000. , ; .

Theater-goers will have a chance next
week to pass judgment upon a San Fran- j
cisco boy who has adopted the stage as ]
his profession. In the performance of I
Charles Frohman's "Little Minister" the
part of Gavin Dlshait will be taken by
Ira A. Hards, a graduate of the Univer
sity of California in the class of 1S94.
The "Little Minister", opens at the Co
lumbia to-morrow rilght. Mr. Hards has
achieved considerable success in the the
atrical profession since his appearance
upon the stage in minor parts immediate
ly after his graduation. Upon leaving
college he went to New Tork and per
formed in many of Mr. Frohman's plays.
His ability soon attracted attention, and
Frohman made him assistant stage di
rector for the "Secret Service" company.
In which "William Gillette was starring.
Mr. Hards went with the company to
Europe as stage director, and afterward
filled the same position in the "Little
Minister" Company. The part of Gavin
IMstiait was taken by Robert Edson when
the "Little Minister" was first performed
in New York. He was taken suddenly ill
and Mr. Hards was given an opportunity
to exhibit his talents. He was fitted for
the part physically and also showed him
self possessed of frreat dramatic ability.
He made a great hit with New Tork audi
ences.

order to subsen r e the needs of the community.
Public - sentiment . is the name given to the
feeling which gives effect to these virtues of
patriotism and public devotion. It Is because
it exists that we have remained thus -far a
free people. : ylt must and will develop as our
problems - develop. ; The man .who ; says that
tlits cannot be done is inviting political sui
cide. J : : r\-..- â¢.-Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
Of the power, of such * sentiment, when once
aroused, : there can be no question. The recent
hazing . investigation at West Point show how
much stronger is an unwritten code of honor
In a social body:than are air the laws passed
by Congress. But can Â¦ it be thus aroused
to do any large portion of the work which we
now demand of government?- If may be frank
ly admitted that It will not do all those things
for which numbers of people now deslra legis
lation. . If ... our people can .' accept cheerfully
the burdens < imposed In â¢ the duties of Â¦ private
life," ' there Is no . inherent reason -why they
should fall to, accept the ; trusts of public life.
' Kxactly what. rules of conduct public opinion
would prescribe, ? or what . specific obligations
the public â¢ conscience .. when once .aroused,
would regard as binding in matters like those,
it > is : too early .to say. .: It , is : enough for the
moment to call attention to the necessity and
the" possibility, of ... such a development. The
power of publlc!oplnlon. "In its true sense, lies
for the., time, unwd; but it Is: an Instrument
fitted ; to :.. meet . Â¦ the - needs . of societyâ strong
whore" strength is needed, slow where conser
vatism la required, capable of . Infinite expan
sion without threatening the foundations of
self-government. Â¦
True Qualities of a Gentleman.
The question is often asked what constitutes
the essential i mark of a gentleman.' as, distinct
from the i accidents of \ birth Â¦ and . of clothes, of
manners'.' and T of ; speech. " I â¢ believe it Is to . be
found ': in ; the . readiness ;. to accept : trusts, : even
when . they, are i personally Â¦' disadvantageousâ
the t readiness ' to subordinate '' a. Â¦ man'* own
convenlcncn " and desires to a social .code.- In
this: sense I believe that the great body_of.the
American jjepple are gentlemen,' and are there
fore capable "of self-government. It is for the
young men who are just growing up to carry
Into i thÂ« larger worlds . of business and legis
lation' the- spirit Â¦ which will' subordinate per-
Bonall convenience to collective 1 honor." In this
development ' of Â¦ the : principle ; of political â¢ trus
teeship : lies the hope Â¦ of Â¦ the- republic for Its
future, i] '*' â¢
â¢ .The~ Rev. Dr. Clampett then pronounced
the benediction and the exercises were
brought to an end.

Ovation Given President Hadley.
President Wheeler in a few Words then
Introduced President Hadley of Yale Uni
versity. * When the distinguished professor
from the East advanced to the front of
the ' platform '- the â¢ college ; cry was : given,
over and "over again,"; by the students, to
the amusement of the orator of the day. .
President Hadley took S for ' his â¢ subject
.'Government by Â¦ Public : Opinion," and he
was listened "to witnt attention. .': An ap
parent nervousness that marked the open
ing of the address gave way after a few
minutes and % then ; President Hadley held
his : vast audience spellbound for more
than an hour. Professor Hadley said in
part: -
There are two theories of democratic govern
mentâthe individualistic, which relies on ' the
self-interest of the various Â¦ citizens ' acting I In
dependently. Â¦ and â¢' the socialist ic. . which - relies
mainly on the votes of these citizens acting ai>
a body. Neither i has proved wholly - satisfac
tory. . ,. . . .-.. ,Â¦Â¦ .;.;.; ,.; : .r, Â¦_', ; . r .y.\,- r
With regard to the individualistic theory,
this -Is now generally admitted.- Self-interest
has done a great deal 1 for us, but it Â¦ will ' not
do everything. It is a ; powerful ; stimulant to
good, but neither in economics \ nor In morals
is it that panacea for rocial'ills which so many
persons | two generations ago Â¦ thought It to be.
Free competition Â¦ wm : far better than the Â¦ old
systems of class legislation, which It superaeded.
But Â¦ we cannot have ' free competition '; every
where; nor ; is it* certain Â¦ . that ' In ' those cases
where we can . have it 1 It produces* so 'Â¦ great a
degree of justice -as was once supposed. â¢
Public Interest Is Real Power.
Under, these circumstances the Socialists, and
many 'who'are 'not "Socialists, " demand that
these evils be controlled -;by Â¦ the use of i the
machinery .of government. Â¦=Â¦ But the power to
use this > machinery in ; the : public . interest is
in some respects more apparent than real:. ." A
democratic ; Government - Is ; subject ;. to special
dlf ficultles Â¦ In exercising - this power. - It lacks
the compelling ', force - behind i lt^ which v Is relt
in a monarchy, or an aristocracyâ for what " Is
everybody's business is not'Ody's business,' and
laws which were passed with enthusiasm often
go unenforced.-; It lacks continuity Â« of policy
and tenacity of purpose. This difficulty Is seen
when we, compare our own foreign policy, with
that Â¦ of . a' country.; like " Ruusia. â¢/ It Â¦ lacks self
restraint in the , use of the Â¦ law-making I power. Â¦
It devises its statutes .with the best of i Intent,
but they : often ' end > In notillng except evasion
and Inconvenience. . .-â¢â¢ \ z â¢ Â¦Â¦- â¢*Â¦ â¢ > â¢

Tailored suits for Easter.
Smart, snappy stylesâ the very cream of this season's productions. ~ r â¢~
We wouldn't have it otherwise.
If the tremendous quantities ourcloak man buys for these six California

concede that. What's more.
Ev- ry suit here is made to our special orderâ with a style dis-
! tinctive'y our own.
You may feel certain that one of our suits will never pet common. No
woman cares to go on the street with a dress she is apt to meet at every cor-
ner. We. give our public exclusive style. Many of the medium and lesser
priced ones, would puzzle vour friends. They'd surely think you had a made-
to-order outfit.
