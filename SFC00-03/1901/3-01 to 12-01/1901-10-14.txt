CAPTURE OF ANARCHISTS IN HOME
OF PRESIDENT SALLES OF BRAZIL
Lawson says he could not give his
friends any advance Information concern
ing this break for the simple reason that
he did not possess the Information; that
certain directors and insiders of the Amal
gamated Company sold their holdings pre
vious to the announcement of the cut in
the dividend.
In his opinion the cut in the dividend
was not compelled by any business neces
sity. Rumors to the contrary notwith
standing, says Lawson, he is not going to
fail, but is in a financial condition to meet
any exigencies which may arise.

laborer from Milpltas, was fatally stabbed
in the abdomen, at 10 o'clock to-night.
While standing on the sidewalk ln front

dagger in Anderson's stomach. Anderson
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
the police are now looking for the men.
Anderson will die.
BEAUMOKT, Tex., Oct. 13.â Three new
Rushers have 'been added to. the list of
wells on Spindle Top. The Hogg-Swayne
Syndicate's No. 4 came in late last night.
=' The German-American Oil Company's
second well on Spindle Top came, in this
morning, spouting a steady stream of oil,
and the Houston-Beaumont Oil Company,
brought in a gusher late this afternoon.
The flow of oil from the latter, which was
allowed to escape through a horizontal
pipe, was tremendous, tearing loose one
joint of the hose on the air pipe and
throwing it asid# -'.,' v^
to him a loss of about $7,000,000.
He declares that he not only did not know
the break was coming, but had been in
formed that the rumor that the extra div
idend would be passed was without foun
dation; that he did not sell a share of
Amalgamated on account of the break;
that he holds at the present time more
than he had at the time of the break, and
that these holdings amount to more than
142,000 shares. . .

also burned while trying to, get out his

the wind at an opportune moment saved
the structure.
Cause Is a Mystery.
As yet : no satisfactory conclusion has
been arrived at as to the origin of the
conflagration. The theory of incendiar
ism is advanced by some, as there was no
fire kept in the building at that time of
night, but so far nothing definite has
been proved. - -
Great credit is due the firemen for
their successful efforts in: saving the
bridge./ Had this been, burned it would
have been a severe loss to the town, as
it affords the only connection over which
teams can pass between the east and
west side of town. This was the second
conflagration In the town's history. The
first occurred in July, 1891, when nearly
all of the business houses on the east
side of the bridge were destroyed. Since
that time the "greater part of the business
of the town had been transacted on the
west side. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0/.

IN EXPLOSION
That Douglas contemplated a stern re
sistance to capture, only afterwards real
izing its futility, was shown when the of
ficers entered. Against the wall stood a
loaded double-barreled shotgun, with an
open box of shells beside it. In his hand
was a revolver, one shell dischargedâ the
ball that had pierced his brain. More
than fifty cartridges were in easy reach,
placed ready for rapid loading. The
pistol was not the same that had proven
so ineffectual in the hands of Aloha
Agnew. It was a late style, hammerless
weapon with an extra long barrel.
Drs. Van Dalsem and II. C. Brown are
attending the injured woman and child.
There are chances that both may recover.
Trepanning will be resorted to in order
to relieve the ' pressure upon Aloha's
brain. She was removed this afternoon
to the hospital and the operation will
take place to-morrow..
Crime of a Maniac.
That the crime was the act of a mad
man, temporarily Insane, is the most gen-

the balance took up the search of the
house and outbuildings.
v A locked carpenter shop was the last
place entered. â¢ A window at the end gave
a fair view of the interior and several
times as the morning light increased the
place was surveyed from this point.
Deputy Bachc broke out a pane of glass
and attempted to force the window for
entrance, but found it impracticable and
sent to the Ridley house for the key to
tha door. Mr. Mason, one of the neigh
bors, secured the key and turned the
lock. As the door opened there was a
shot and Douglas fell from his place of
concealment to the floor, a bullet through
his temple. He had ended his crimes
with suicide.
LORD DOUGLAS
IN A DISASTER
"I have a statement to make," she said
t Â» the Sheriff, "but not till I am stronger.
Let this rest till then." Whe she became
aware of her husband's suicide, she said
"Thank God! He will never frighten me
again."
Mrs. Douglas refused to make any fur
ther statement to the Sheriff this evening,
but promised that later she would explain
matters fully. To one of the neighbors
she .said that she was awakened by her
husband- tightening a rope about her
neck and attempted to struggle. . He
struck her over the head with a heavy,
earthenware chamber and then beat her
with the bone. There are ten incisions,
some three inches long on her face, and
i her condition is critical.

seems no evidence of any predilections to

and little is known of hi#; past." At the
inquest it was shown that his own ac
counts of his past are misleading and
mystifying. At different times he said he
came from Iowa, New York and Kansas,
and he told one witness three distinctly
separate stories of his past career. He
first came to Santa Clara County about
three years ago and married Mrs. Agnew
within a year. ...
Mrs. Douglas was the widow of Harry
Agnew, a. well-known breeder of fine
horses and at nis death she inherited a
r.:nch worth over $50,000 besides other
property. Douglas' first introduction to
the widow was in the capacity of a pur
chaser for some of the valuable horses on
lue ranch. The courtship was of only a
few weeks' duration and to-day Mrs.
Douglas said that she knew no more of
his past than the neighbors. She could
not tell his nativity nor give any inform
ation about him prior to the marriage.

Considine made a statement to-night
to the effect that Sherman had threat

as he was running at the time he could
not say how the shooting was done.
Mr. Sherman and his family were pre

to-morrow.
LEADV1LLE, Colo., Oct. 13.â The town
Is wild with excitement to-night -over tne
killing of one boy and the fatally wound
ing of two others this afternoon by Jesse
Sherman, a prominent ranchman residing
near Leadville, and who is among the
most respected residents of the place. He
caught a crowd of boys supposedly
poaching on his rabbit preserve, and
jumping from his buggy started after
them with a heavily loaded shotgun in
his hand. Sherman claims it was acci
dentally discharged while he was run
ning. Ed Dorringten, 16 years of age,
was instantly killed; Earl King, 17, was
shot through the right lung and is dying,
and James Considine, 14 years of age, was
fchot through the back and hips.
Sherman immediately brought the
wounded boys to town and then gave
himself up. He has been arrested on a
charge of murder. All of the boys were
running at the time of the shooting urvl
can give no account of it excepting to say
that he ordered them to halt.
There is considerable criticism here of
the recent statement? of Congressman
Weeks cf Michigan regarding Filipino
character and possibilties. Members of
the commission refer to his remarks as
"loo sweeping," and as "based upon too
fchort an experience."
The native press condemns the conclu
sions of Weeks as "unjust and viciously
false."
There is intense feeling among the na

c^.-S. few m Â«nÂ«tes after 4 o'clock the
Sheriff s office received the telephone
message and a posse consisting of Sheriff
Langford, Deputies Bache, Starbird and
Arthur Langford went to the scene of
the crime. A hurried search was made of
the premises, but a near neighbor had
seen a horse and buggy answering the
description of Douglas, driving towards
San Jose, and consequently the posse was
divided. Two deputies hurried back to
Before the Sheriff's posse arrived Mrs
Douglas staggered, into the Ridleys' a
mass of blood, dragging her three-year-old
girl. Erma Agnew. A five-months babv
the child of her second husband, she had
been unable to bring, and it was still
peacefully sleeping in its cradle when the
Sheriff arrived.
Ridley and another neighbor hastened to
the nearest telephone, three miles away
to notify the Sheriff. As they left the
house, Aloha, wrote: "Let me know as
soon as you can if mamma is all right."
She has not spoken since the blow was
struck. Her tongue and the side of her

of the skull having been forced upon the
brain.

Aloha, as soon as she knew the maniac
had gone, managed to get upon her feet
and somehow made her way to the near
est house, the Ridleys', an * eighth of a
mile away. When she fell against their
door she could not talk and was gasping
for breath. The rope was still tied about
her neck and had to be cut away. She
motioned for pencil and paper and while
still striving for breath, wrote in short,
broken sentences an outline of the horri
ble story. These memoranda are stained
with the blood from her wound.
Douglas \u25a0 used the great bone upon her,
striking such a blow that his weapon was
broken and splintered. The girl fell
to v the floor and the madman,
picking up a rope, pulled it about
her throat. Twice he wound it
around her neck, then knotted it, drawing
the ends so tightly that she could barely
breathe. She struggled to crawl away
but he forced her to the bed where his
battered wife lay. Then he left the room.
Early this morning Charles Douglas, a
rancher living about seven miles south
east of San Jose, entered his wife's room
and struck her with a large bone, the
femur of an ox or a horse. Blow after
blow was struck," Mrs. Douglas struggling
to escape from the pinioning bed clothes.
In the next room, Aloha, the daughter
of Mrs. Douglas by her first husband,
heard the crash and cries and rushed to
her mother's help. She knew where a re
volver lay, and she seized the heavy 43
caliber weapon. At the door she pointed
the weapon at her stepfather and pulled
the trigger three times, but it failed to ex
plode. Then she'srappled with the man,
so insanely bent on murder. She is not
a big child nor strong for her age, but
she fought like a ' tiger cub tor her
mother's life. \

Gangs of men have been at work since
ecrly morning back-firing and fighting it
in every way in an endeavor to keep it
from the house, and now since the wind
of the afternoon has died down their
efforts are more successful. The flames
are within half a mile of the town itself
now, and if the wind rises during the
night the consequences may be very seri
ous. The nre to-day destroyed a large
area of timber land on both the Jacka
and \u25a0 Doud - tracts, and the loss will be
very greats Last night a new fire started
on the . Pacific. Improvement Company's
saventeen-rnile drive reservation. It was
caused by the dropping and rolling of
burning pine cones and burned over a
large territory, evrn reaching : the main
gate at the town of Carmel Hill. It wa3
controlled before crossing the drive.ihow
ever, and has done little injury to the ap
pearance of this famous roadway. The
fire is now fairly under control on the
company's property except in one place,
about two miles back of Pacific Grove,
and there it has jumped on to the hill
top on the Gomez ranch and near the
ranch house. The danger is great, since
the hill is covered with timber and brush
and a fair wind is driving cinders in the
direction of the town. The flames are
running rapidly down the hill and many

WASHINGTON. Oct. 13.â In well in
formed Catholic circles here it is believed
that the next consistory of the Catholic
church at Rome will be held In February,
when Pope Leo XIII attains the twenty
fifth year of his pontificate. It is thought
likely that this assembly will open the
jubilee to signalize the closing of the
quarter-century of Pope Leo's regime,
and that he w.'ii take advantage of It to
deliver an allocution, taking a strong po
sition on the question of assassination
among other tilings.
Cardinal Martinelli will remain In office
here until about the time for the consist
ory. It is quite likely that he will be as
signed in Home to the congregations of
the 1 holy omVe known as the "inquisi
tion." which watches the morals and dis
cipline of the church, and the propaganda,
which deals with the propagation of the
faith.
Cardinal Martinelli and two or three of
the newly created Cardinals will receive
the red hat at the coming consistory.

The Sun has been for some time in posses
sion of information gained from one in close
touch with the Vatican that no new Cardinals
will be created at the coming consistory; but if
any names are presented no prelate in the
United -States will be honors. This informa
tion is in harmony with what is said to be
the intention of Pope Leo that no other Amer
ic-an Cardinal will be created as long as Car
dinal Glbbcns lives.

Weather Report.
LONDON, Oct. 13.-The outlook for the '
money market is now fairly easy. The
rate of discount. outside the Bank of Eng
land last week did not go above 2 per cent,
and settling day, thanks to generous Gov
ernment dividend disbusements, passed
without a strain. There Is a strong-proba
bility, however, that Paris will soon de
mand a considerable portion of the gold
of which London has had the use for some
time.
The Stock Exchange closed with a rally
during the last three days of the week
after a decidedly unpromising opening
The recovery followed the upward turn
in Wall street, which was the only bright
spot on the horizon.
There was but little of interest in tho
fluctuations of the week. Canadians were
bought with some freedom. Mexican Na
tional improved slightly. The Speyer "re
organization plans were responsible for
this. The American section rose generally
on the talk of a compromise of some sort
which is believed to be imminent in con
nection with the Northwestern lines,,
thereby releasing large amounts of money
heretofore tied up by the Northern Pacific
dispute.
While the immediate conditions of the
Stock Exchange are rather stagnant and
negative, a look into the future shows
but small cause for optimism. The Statist
in the course of a long article on the trade
outlook, takes the Government severely to
, task for mismanagement and for not look
ing the South African situation squarely
in the face. It predicts a- further depre
ciation in securities, owing to the decreas
ed earning capacity and the increased ex
penditures.
The fact that Russia is only keeping her
factories going by Government contracts
Indicates, In the opinion of the Statist, a
poor continental market for British pr6d
uts with increasingly keen competition
because continental manufacturers are
forced to sell at most any prices they can
get.
On the other hand, the Government must
apply for further funds, the Statist be
lieves, to carry on the operations in South'
Africa; while the mere fact that Great
Britain has begun the third year of a
seemingly endless war adds to the eloom
of an outlook already cheerless I
Â« BE i RL^i, Oct ' J 3 T'^ ftcfr th^ brief re
vival which marked the previous week "
begins the Frankfurter Zeitung's Bourse
report, "there followed last week complete
depressions and despondency, worse than '
had been thought possible. The hopes
which many had begun to cherish again
proved deceptive. Neither in industry nor '
anywhere else was the slightest trace of
permanent improvement perceptible On
the contrary, such strikingly bad 'news
came that there is absolutely no cause for
wonder that universal despondency is in
creasing."
The bad news referred to was the re
duction of dividends or the passing of
them by many first class companies in the
iron trade. Such Instances are multlply-
The production of raw sugar during Sep
tember was 63,189 tons, as compared with
38,183 in September. 1900, and that of re
flned sugar was 48,535 tons, as comtmred
with 35.900 in September of last vear Th*

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
THE United States army transport
Grant is not going Into retirement
after ail. On her arrival here
from Manila a few weeks ago she
v.ent cut of commission and all
her stores were sent ashore. m Nearly all
of her crew was put aboard the Thomas,
snd it was generally understood that re
pairs and alterations to the extent of JWO,
000 were to be made to the vessel.
It now transpires that there are nearly
1000 discharged soldiers and civilians
awaiting transportation from the Philip
pines to the L'nited States and there are
no vessels to carry them. The Thomas
Falls irom here next Wednesday, but the
Kilpatrick v.ill be sent East as soon as
fhe reaches Manila on her next run, as
v.ill also the Meade. There was therefore
nothing for the Government to do but put
the Grant hack into commission. Tem
jmrarv repairs will be made to the ves
sel arid she will get away for the islands
about November 1.
Chief Steward Herbert of the Grant and
nearly all his men are now on the Thom
as, while the deck hands and firemen
have been paid off. A new crew will have
to be engaged and the supplies put back
aboard before the vessel can go to sea.
Luck of Ship Australia.
The British ship Australia, which ar
rived here from Antwerp on August SO
last, has played in great good luck. Dur
ing the voyage the vessel was caught in
a succession of storms and once she was
under two lower topsails. This was in
the Pacific and the gaJe lasted thirty-six
hours. In spite of storms and adverse
winds the Australia made the run in 124
days. On her arrival Captain Korff
found tl-e strike in progress, but, nothing
daunted, he went to work and discharged
the cargo himself. It consisted almost
wholly of wines, spirits, cordials, bitters
and mineral waters, valued at more than
J'l^O.<viO, and yet the breakage was almost
rMtthtnjCi and the clerk -who tallied the
cargo says It came out In better shape
loan any similar shipment that has come
here in years.
Ths Australia is one of fifteen vessels
owned by P. Denniston & Co. of Glasgow.
Strange "to say, all the masters save one
are Germans, the exception being -a
Welshman.
To Wreck the Pyrenees.
Captain L E. Thayer, the marine sur
veyor, and a party of wreckers will leave
liere on the 24th inst. on the mail steam-
Ehip Australia for Tahiti. From Papeete
they will go to Manga Reva. and attempt
to get the British ship Pyrenees off the
beach and into deep water.
The Pyrenees left here the beginning of
the year for England with a cargo of
â¢wheat. The cargo caught fire and the
captain ran for Pitcalrn in the hope of
obtaining assistance. The islanders could
rot help him, but one of their number
\u25a0was eer.t to pilot the burning ship to
Manga Reva, where she was beached.
The crew escaped and some of them went
to Australia, while the remainder came to
Can Francisco. Some months after the
<Heaster the wreck was sold at auction
and purchased by Kschen & Minor of this
city. The owners refused to confirm the
sale and are now making a movement to
vard salving the vessel themselves.
Improving- Sausalito Ferry Service.
Th Eausalito ferry service Is now In
splendid shape for the winter. The steam
er EauEalito, after a thorough overhaul-
Ing, went back Into commission again
yesterday. She was not on the regular
run, but took out an excursion party. To
day she v.ill take up the San Rafael's
time-table and the latter vessel will go
Into retirement. Her new boilers have
been ready for months and they \u25a0will be
put in at once and an electric light plant
Installed. When her overhauling is com
pleted the San Rafael will be the fastest
and most comfortable ferry steamer on
the bay. As soon as the San Rafael is in
oomroisslon ag^aln the Tamalpals will
Jiave her furnaces fixed to burn oil.
Water Front Notes.
Two French sailors from the Colonel fie
Vlllabois Mareull nad a gray time of it
along tne front yesterday. They finally
decided to visit their compatriots on the
Marechal de Turenne, lying at Green
street. While trying to g-et aboard one of
them slipped and fell on a fender and
from there into the water. He was fished
out and taken to the Harbor Hospital,
â¢where his bruises were dressed.

MAY BE CHALLENGED
Tammany Men of the Bronx Insin
uate That the Humorist Is a
Colonizer.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â Mark Twain is
worried over the threat of Bronx Tam
many men that when he attempts to vote
on election day he will be challenged as
a colonizer. Clemens rented a house at
Riverdale-on-the-Hudson, which ia the
home of W. W. Appleton, head of the pub
lishing firm. . He took possession on Octo
ber 2, which entitles him to register and
vote. Said he:
I tried to convert a Tammany policeman out
at my gate the other day. I used all the elo
quence of cart-tail campaign oratory on him
to show him how foolish he was. I tried to
prove to his satisfaction that there was no rec
ord of any Tammany man ever getting to
heaven. He did not seem to get enthusiastic.
He was a very Judicious policeman â one of
those fellows who never let you know what
they are thinking about.
I'll bet a squirrel' a nest that if he is watched
at the polls on election day he'll be found
voting for Low. If I were a policeman I would
do just what this Tammany cop did when I
tried to get him over to my way of thinking
and then vote according to my conscience, but
never expose that conscience to public view.
I must admit, though, that for the last/few
days I have felt a cold chill run down my
spinal cord whenever I think that I will only
be a little more than thirty days in this dis
trict when election day comes, which subjects

The aeronaut is accompanied by two

He expects to reach Algeria on Wednes
day night or Thursday morning:. He took
with him seventy-five carrier pigeons to
be released in three batches dally. The
balloon, which Is decorated with the tri
color, carries accumulators for electric
signal lamps and an electric pump to
draw up sea water for ballast whenever
necessary by tubes immersed in the sea.
Comte de la Vaulx, by a . system of
floats, intends to keep about 400 feet above
the water. . , .;â¢\u25a0 â¢
Comte de la Vaulx with difficulty re
placed the apparatus. Then a portion of
the balloon shed collapsed in a gale and
tore the balloon. This damage was re
paired, but a few days ago another acci
dent delayed his departure.
Finally the aeronaut's luck changed.
Weather and wind improved and at the
last moment M. de Lassen revoked his de
cision and ordered the French second
class cruiser Du Chayla to convoy the
balloon, which is also convoyed by a pri
vate yacht. â¢ " y
PARIS. Oct. 14.â Considerable interest
is manifested in the attempt of Comte de
la Vaulx, the aeronaut, who left Les Sa
blettes, near Toulon, last night, on a bal
loon voyage across the, Mediterranean,
with a" view of testing. the possibility of
using baloons between' France, Corsica
and Algeria in time of war.
The success of tne experiment has been
frequently endangered of late by hitches
in the arrangements. Comte de la Vaulx
has received semi-official support in the
way of subscriptions from the Ministers
of Marine and War. The former had
promised a cruiser as a convoy and also
lent the inflating apparatus. A fortnight
ago, however, M. de Lassen decided that
the season was not propitious for the ex
periment and withdrew the cruiser and
the apparatus.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â A dispatch from Tou
lon says a carrier pigeon arrived there At
5 o'clock last evening from the balloon of
Comte de la Vaulx, bearing the report
that the balloon was being driven by a
northeast wind, going at a fair speed, the
weather being very line and all well. ' .' \u25a0

yesterday (Sunday) about 12:30 p. m. The

The car. was about sixty feet above the
sea. The Comte de la Vaulx signaled that

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â It is probable
that-a liberal building policy with respect
to naval ships will be urged upon Con
gress at the approaching; session. No
authorization for new construction was
given by Congress .at the last session
owing in part to a disagreement as to
the i-espective merits of single and super
posed turrets. Congress contented itself
with a direction to the Navy Department
to submit full plans .for two battleships
and two armored cruisers to it at the ap
proaching session, so that the body could
itself choose between the designs. Sec
retary Long, however, does not regard
himself as estopped by this direction
from recommending the construction of
additional warships, and as a full year
has been lost in the execution of tfie
naval building scheme laid down by the
policy board, and as more time has been
lost through the great delay In construc
tion of the ships already authorized and
contracted for, owing to the steel strilfe,
a considerable increase must be recom
mended in order to avoid falling hope
lessly behind in the erection of the ideal
American navy.

The De Lima case involved the validity

Our nine-dollar suit is not an ordinary suit for nine dollars: It is distinctly different
from any other nine-dollar suit you ever saw â different and better in workmanship, mate-
rials, style and other points of superiority. . .
This suit has been the result of a great deal of planning, figuring and studying on our
part. We have gotten the cost down so that we can sell the suit for $9.00 by buying the cloth
in large quantities direct from the mills â we buy for four large stpres â two retail stores *in
San Francisco, one retail and one wholesale store in New York. Through buying the cloth
so advantageously we can sell the suits at retail for the same price wholesalers must pay â
you get this benefit. At last we have succeeded in making the suits from all the popular
materialsâ serges, cheviots, tweeds and worsteds in solid colors and mixed patterns. Every
taste or fancy can be satisfied. "
The suits are union-made and bear the label. They are guaranteed with a money-
back and a repairing guarantee. They are the most stylish and desirable suits we ever sold
for $9.00. That's saying a good deal, too â but the clothes back it up.
The second floor of our store is devoted to children's, boys' and youths' clothing,
furnishing&4nd hats. Our idea is to make buying as easy as possible for mothers. Whatever
the age of the boy is, she can bring him to this department and outfit him complete, with the
exception of shoes. The stock contains an assortment of everything in these various lines;
it is thoroughly up-to-date and seasonable. The prices are low. They are consistent with
our policy of small profits and many sales. Our earnest endeavor is to make this the most
economical store in town. One purchase,, however small, will get you acquainted with our
methods and values. ' â¢
Children's and boys' suits from $1.35 to $10.00. Young men's suits from $5.50 to
$20.00. -There is an equally big range of saving prices in the other departments.

crowded to its utmost capacity. Father
Parrish, pastor of the church, officiated at
the altar, and a full choir was in attend

twelfth chapter of St. John, twenty-fifth

The services were, conducted by the

Hall in his sermon said:
"We are unable to do things ourselves
for our own salvation and the only way
in which we may accomplish that end is
to seal ourselves with the. spirit of God.
This, should not be merely a crown
stamped on our forehead or an external
sign, but it should be indelibly impressed
on our souls in God's own likeness. It
should.be even as St. Peter said. 'Ye are
partakers of. divine nature.' Not of his
omniscence, omnipotence or other infin

and attributes. â¢ .

AT ST. PETER'S
"What delight to be able to preach the
truth to the benighted races of the earth!
If at times the battle Is hard, remember
that there is a comradeship which com
pensates for every discomfort. It is the
duty of Christians to support those who
have devoted their lives to the* cause of
Christianity. You must evef be vigilant
in your work, for it is at moments when
you are off guard that Satan attacks your
soul. Onward In prayer, onward in the
panoply of God. and. you have his word
for It. Satan will practice his wiles against
you in vain. Like the Greek who wrested
victory from his competitors in the Olym
pian games for the glory of Greece, 'you
should wrest victory from your efforts in
the field of Christianity for the glory of
Jesus Christ." â¢ \u25a0Â» . Â»
In closing the Bishop paid a" tribute to
the admirable work being accomplished by
the Young Men's Christian Association,
and he urged his hearers never to allow
their enthusiasm to lag. After a solo by
Miss Judson and a selection by' the asso
ciation quartet the meeting came to a

The speaker went on to say that com
mercial enterprise was based on the sams
principles by which- the affairs of the
church are forwarded to successful con
clusions. The church seeks to win con
verts in every land under the sun. When
he went to Brazil twelve years ago he was
r.mazed to find Virginia floor on sale in
the towns through which he passed. Why
was this flour sent abroad, when, in fact,
the very brand was unknown to- most Vir
ginians? Why did not the manufacturers
first make their brand known to their own
people before sending it- to lands across
the sea? Simply because it is the nature
of business to expandâ to broaden until
the most distant landa of the world are
reached and conquered. â¢ For the same
reason the church sends out Its mission

tian Association at thÂ« audi
torium yesterday afternoon.
The speaker of the day wan
the Right Rev. Ludan L?Â»
Klnsolvlnir. Bishop of Brazil. Bishop
Klnsolvlng had no specified subject for
discourse, but he coruntod himself, with
the utterance of general remarks upon
the need of more missionary work by
Christian men and women In all walks of
life. The Bishop Is a native Virginian, and
a marked Southern accent, coupled with
brilliancy of thought and fine power of
expression, rendered his address more
than ordinarily interesting.
After scriptural reading by Archdeacon
C. B. Crawford of Kansas and the usual
announcements by Secretary H. J. Mc-
Coy Bishop Kinsolvlng waa introduced by
Rolla V. Watt. The Bishop expressed his
appreciation of the high and lofty priv
ilege afforded him of speaking to an audi
ence of young Christian men and women.
It was not his intention to speak of th-=i
cardinal principles of the church to which,
he owed allegiance, but to speak in a gen
eral way of missionary work in and out
of the church. Resuming, he said In part:
DETAILED BY THE MASTER.
"Christ's life to the world was without
pompous honor. His property was a
benediction to men. The world was better
for His having lived. And when I die
I hope I may join that choir of immortal
invisible dead who speak the words of
Christ."
Delves after him. This Is not only the
revelation of Christ but reason Also. And
now, my friend*, many of us are Illustrat
ing this pagan Greek life. We are sacri
ficing every day everything for that which
we love. Why should we be afraid to
stand before people who are Immoral, peo
ple who glvo way to the empty pomp and
worldly dissipations? Why should we bo
afraid to stand up and condemn that
which In not right; that which is against
all the teachings of Christ? And there is
much need to-day of the preacher speak
ing of these things because we seem to be
in an ace of revival of these pagan Greek
ideas which brought her realms and sub
jects to desolation and ruin. An enthu
siasm for material wealth has seized and
bound some of our people. We are not
aaked to sacrifice our very lives or be
hermits and live in a desert, but we are
asked to distrust and discourage this pom
pous display of worldllness, because we
are men and children of Christ. â¢ . â¢
"Not because you want to be conspicu
ous but for Christ's flake. My friends, we
shall never meet again as we are to-night.
Coming as I did here to-night on my way
to my far distant home, it seems that I
must speak of it.-
PALO ALTO, OcL 13.â Rev. Mr. Rous
manlere of Providence, R. -I./ preached in
All Saints Episcopal Church In Palo
Alto this . morning. In the evening the
pulpit was occupied by Dean Hart; of
Denver. Both of the clergymen are in
attendance at the General Episcopal Con
vention in San Francisco.
Services at Palo Alto.
"God divided man into men of all con
ditions,, colors and races not . that they
might trample upon each other, but that
they might assist one another. I believe
that there are no people eolow or. sp de
graded that they cannot be reached by. a
conscientious and persistent missionary."
"At present we are not prosecuting
work among the Mexicans. We withdrew
from that country three years ago as a
matter of necessity. The Mexicans be
long to the Roman Catholic church, and
among these people that church is doing
its work fairly well. It will do it better
and better when influenced by the advent
of other Christian people. I would like
to help the Mexicans. I would like to
construct a school for their benefit."
Dr. Holly. Bishop of Haiti, -stated that
as ' a. culmination- to his forty years of
missionary labors he desired to construct
an industrial school for the hitherto
neglected mountaineers of the West In
dies. Ke declared that the construction
of such a school would enable the na
tives to- learn the use of the plow and
harrow and that thus they would be en
abled to take advantage of the rich fer
tility of the sofl. He stated that the na
tives in the interior of the islands had
not been reacr.ed by the Catholic church
or by the Protestant -denominations.
He attributed the success which has at
tended the efforts of the Episcopal mis
sionaries to the fact that they had trained
up an efficient corps of native ministers
to assist them. * . â¢ . . â¢ . â¢
The honor of concluding the speech
making of the evening fell to the Right
Rev. Dr. Hare, Bishop of South Dakota.
He said:
"This section of the United States has a
future. The \u25a0 mines . of Arizona already
have a world -wide fame. People came
there for their health, thus rnaking the
country a sort of hospital or sanitarium.
We are there to care for these people. The
missionaries who have come to Arizona
during the last two years have been men
of exceptional worth.
"The history of this section of the coun
try is fascinating. The very climate is
fascinating. It was once the habitation
of a people who have withered from the
land, leaving nothing but the ruins of
their cities. These strange people have
passed away and their land is occupied
by another race, that lives in the same
primitive manner as when the Spaniards
first came upon \u25a0 them. The Spaniards
came for gold, but they were accompanied
by the Franciscan fatherg, who came for
God.
ing the Chinese out of tfteir foul, ill-smell
ing streets, out of their ignorance and out
of their superstition and degradation.
The Right Rev. Bishop Henerick of
New Mexico, in speaking of the strange
races of people who formerly lived among
the hills and in the valleys of New Mex
ico, Arizona and Mexico, said in part:
"One difference between Christianity
and heathenism is that the one is clean
and orderly, while the other is dirty and
disorderly. In the hospitals you will find
Christian doctors ministering to the suf
fering natives. In the Christian churches
you will find the Chinese worshiping as
you worship here. You will hear the
choir singing praise to God and- you will
hear the men pray and give in response
the 'amens.' You will hear the minister
tell In plain words of the life of Christ.
"The missions in China are being con
ducted by men trained by long experience
in actual work and equipped with a
knowledge on the character and needs of
the natives. These missionaries are lead-
capacity and four Bishops,
renowned for their devoted labors in the
missionary fields, delivered interesting ad
dresses. The Right Rev. Dr. Graves,
Eishcp of Shanghai, described the manner
in which the missionaries are waging war
against heathenism in China. The Right
Rev. Bishop Kenerick of New Mexico told
of the aborigines who once lived in the
States contiguous to the Mexican border
and described the work which is being
prosecuted to win their descendants to
Christianity. The Right Rev. Bishop
Holly of Haiti spoke interestingly of the
manner in which the natives of tne West
Indies are being converted, and the Right
Rev. Bishop Hall of South Dakota fur
nished many interesting facts concerning
missionary work among trie Indians of the
Northwest.
The Right Rev. Bishop Satterlee of
Washington, D. C, acted as chairman of
the evening. In introducing Dr. Graves,
the first speaker, he said that missionary
work should be placed above parish inter
ests. He declared that when this would
be done God would bestow a blessing upon
the parishioners and the church that
would more than compensate for ihe ex
tra labors expended in the missionary
Jields.
Bishop Graves spoke in substance as
follows:
"They tell us that missionary work
among heathen people and especially
among the Chinese is a most stupendous
task. Such people draw pictures of un
conquerable superstition, ignorance and
degradation. Suppose you go with me to
China and to the mission station. You
will have to pass through the narrow
streets reeking with odor. You will be
jostled by the Chinese and perhaps in-
Eulted because of being a hated foreigner.
But when you arrive at the mission sta
tion you will find nothing but decorum
and order. You will see a school yard, a
quadrangle, a school with a dornutory at
one end. When you enter the school
room you will not be greeted with insult,
but the little boys will jui rise with re
spect: if you examine their books you
will find that besides studying -the Chi
nese language they . are learning your
algebra, your arithmetic and your geom
etry.

we must attest It by having the right

and surrendered to the spirit of God in
order that he may accomplish his work.

The sacraments are pledges through life

impression on the soul which he came to

fuller and better life. Prepare yourselves
to bo more worthy of his grace so that a
restoration may be made of your being to

At the meeting of the Brotherhood of

George S. Baker of San Francisco and
H. R. Braden of Berkeley.
"Some say: 'Speak not to us of faith,

will shield us and he bids us stand fast

Corinthians. God's facts are fundamental
and immutable. They need no change. If

Dr. Hopkins, the rector of Epiphany
Church, Chicago, the Brotherhood of St.
Andrew convened for short addresses by
the laity.
"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith," was
the keynote of Dr. Hopkins' sermon. !
He said: "No good is obtained from
watching others. You must watch your
self. When St. Paul exhorted the people
to cultivate a state of watchfulness he
meant that each man should have in his
own inner life and consciousness a clean
liness and purity of belief. Watch ye,
look into your own conscience and see
how far you fall short of faith. In these

have not cultivated a deep and truthful

preached the sermon. His text was taken

theme was "The Relation of the Modern

he said:
The relation of Christianity to humanity is
the same now as it was in the days or 1 its

nature has not in itself been altered, but social
characteristics have undergone â¢ a ! change.
Those who would tell us that we have a
modern Christianity to meet our modern re
quirements are not to be trusted. They even
pretend to explain to us according to what is
termed "the higher criticism" the meaning of
the Bible. Some scientists, while professing to
believe' in God, make woful mistakes in en
deavoring to account for his actions and works
by natural means. Science has done much to
enlighten the world, but Christianity has done
more. How often are science and scientific
deductions found to be in error? Instances are
not lacking and they are becoming more nu
merous every day.
The Christian church has from its origin
always been the friend and helper of human
ity, the ennobler of man and. woman and the
guardian -of liberty. Even in the Middle Ages,
when the power of the Christian church was
thought to be greatly weakened, its Christ
given leaven worked in the masses to the up
lifting and betterment of mankind.
We are living in a strenuous age. The sordid
spirit \u25a0 of commercial greed and covetousness
would seem to have preoccupied the field as
against the spirit of i Christianity. But we
should not despair at . this apparent obstacle.
It is in the home where the doctrines of Chris
tianity should be Inculcated. There they can
be' implanted In the hearts and minds of the
young with a firmness that is always productive
.of lasting fruits. It is a lamentable fact that
the boys and trirls of our | country are giving
five days in every week to other studies than
those of religion and Christianity and but one
hour on Sunday, to learning, about- their God
and his teachings. Who will deny," in looking
at it in : this, light, that the parochial school
system of the Roman church is not a wise
one?

The greatest curse that has ever come to the

There is something more precious than peo

Covetousness changes politics into a scramble

BERKELEY, Oct. 13.-The stu
dents of the university were
addressed this afternoon - in
Hearst Hall by the Right Rev.
Thomas F. Gailor, D. D., Bish
op of Tennessee. The sermon
dwelt principally i upon the
dangerous gro-wth of covetousness and ir
reverence among people ah.d the ill effect
they have upon the nation's institutions,
and the need ol individual responsibility
for the attainment of the highest develop
ment. The speaker conducted the devo
tional services.
Bishop Gallor's sermon in part was as
follows:
Patriotism becomes a subject for a Christian
discourse before men especially engaged in
that best of all Christian work, the work of
education. Virtues of civilization are virtues
given to us, or emphasized at least, by the
Christian' gospel. The great qualities that be
long to manhood are the virtues that belong
to truth, the virtues that relate to law and
obedience to the law and the virtues that re
late to purity. These have built up the family
life, the idea and fact of home. These quali
ties have no cause adequate to account for
them except the Christian gospels and teach
ings.

One of the greatest dlfficultes that we are
compelled to face is the low moral tone that
exists in many Bections of the empire, and
unless the zour.g Christian who goes there is
strong and determined he is likely to fall.
When there is such a fall every advantage is
taken of it, and it is quoted as an evidence
of the unstabllity of the Christian religion.
The writinp? of Ingersoll and the agnostic and
atheistic writers of the Christian world have
been translated into Japanese and widely cir
culated against us.
Yet in Â«pite of all this. Christianity haa
made greater strides In Japan In the last five
years than ever before. The general influence
of the press is with Christianity, for they
f par that unless a higher standard of morals
than now exists is set up that the empire it
self will l>e endangered.
We are frequently asked if our converts are
not from the poorer classes. This Is not eo,
for most of those who embrace Christianity are
from the middle classes, the lawyers, doctors
and ekilted mechanics. Thirteen members of
the Imperial Diet are Christians, and the presi
dent of \he lower house of the Imperial Par
liament la a Christian and earnest Sunday
school worker. There is even hope that has
some good foundation that the Crown Prince,
when he aecends the- throne of Japan, will
openly avow the lowly Xazarene.
And I would say a word for the Young Men's
Christian Association work In Japan. It Is a

The Christian religion Is struggling against
great difficulties in the island empire, but
despite everything that it is compelled to face,
the work of Christ is going 6teadily forward.
Speaks Upon Japan.
The ques=tiÂ»n may arise in the man, how
must he live that he may be fit to come to
God? He must believe in God. He ought to
conduct himielf in this world as if there was
no other. Vc know there is another world
where a'.l is grand and beautiful, but It is not
it that we Ere now seeking.
It is for 'us to prepare for the resurrection of
this body. In all these centuries men have not
exhausted tne f^crets of the body. God meant
that you should keep them clean, that they
must not be contaminated by the polutlon of
Â«=in. When the body is dead the life is out of
it and it it only fit for the grave, but Christ
pays. "I am the resurrection and the life."
and when the body is cleansed of Bin we are
prepared to enjoy the beatific vision of the
holy epirit, restoration to the presence of God
and the glory of his power.
Bishop Seymour delivered the sermon at
this evening's service, when there was an
other large congregation and special mu
sic.
of Springfield, 111. The visiting
Bishop was assisted by the Rev. Robert
Ritchie, rector of the church, and the spe
cial music was directed by E. Dunbar
Crandall. Bishop Seymour founded his
sermon upon St. Paul's epistle to the He
brews, vi:2: "He that cometh to God
must believe that he is and diligently seek
him." The Bishop said in part:
"He that cometh to God must believe that he
Is" is a statement that embodies the sug
gestion of what ve ought to do in this Hie.
God has revealed to us in this precious book,
the Bible, -what our duties to him and our
fellow beings shotld consist of. It is not possi
ble to seize upon and devour the fundamental
verities of the entire book, consequently the
church has provided that we shall know by Its
offices as many things as possible in it that
have application to our lives. This text brings
us to the summary of Christian faith. It is
one that serves to reveal to us the character of
God. We must remember that God reveals his
existence not merely to satisfy men's curiosity
but to exhibit to them his infinite power. Too
many men reject the Bible because they do not
and will nol understand revelation and there
fore cannot accept !t.
God placed us in this world, which is a great
palace, and gave us the key to its door that
we might by knowledge open and find its
treasures. There are many questions that
puzzle us; for instance, the question is asked,
when a man <J!es how can he be absolved from
tin? Science cannot fathom such an enigma,
but revelation es it is written in the Bible
tells us the answer for It.
Many a man has said to his sorrow that he
van not come to God. But I say that if he
\u25a0won't go to God, God will go to him, for God
tuyt, he will judge the quick and the dead, and
fee is omnipotent. Man may Kay that it will be
as well with me as with others who haVe
rejected God, but his rejection only goes so far
as life lastsâ he Is soon dead and then he will
have to answer before the throne of God.
OAKLAND." Oct. 13.â St. Paul's
Episcopal Church was crowded
this morning with parishioners,
eager to hear the address of
the Right Rev. Seymour, the
venerable Bishop of the diocese
. "You are part of the Sunday school auxil
iary," said Mr. Thomas to the children. "You
Men may be ever so busy, but if they, have
the will and the inclination they can find time
to come to church and to do their share of
church work.
Bishop Nichols presented Mr. Thomas
as one of the leading Sunday-school su
perintendents of Philadelphia. The Bishop
commented upon the fact that despite Mr.
Thomas' enormous business demands he
found time to attend to his church work.
Said the Bishop:
The children occupied the central pewa
of the main floor of the church. They were
accompanied by their teachers. The theme
of the addresses was that of missionary
work at home and abroad. Dr. Duhring
gave a very happy talk to the young,
using colored pasteboard cards, cut in a
circle, to illustrate his explanation. The
white represented the world in its original
Innocence, the black being sin, the red
the redeeming blood of Christ and the
blue the hope in heaven and eternity.
During his talk Dr. Duhring said:
We have done better during the paat year
than ever before in our missionary work. Now
we have 600,000 people, old and young, in our
Sunday schools, with 60,000 teachers and 6000
Sunday schools. This year the Sunday schools
gave $105,000 for missionary work. Twenty
four years ago they gave only $7000, so you
see we are growing. We must grow and ex
pand the gospel. We must send it out to the
Philippinesâ the McKlnley Islands, I hope they
will be called, for our dead President deserved
that they should bear his nameâ and to China
and Japan we must send the story of Christ.
We have done well, but there is vastly more
to do. There are a thousand million heathen
who do not know Christ and the story of sal
vation. There are 33.000 people who die dally
In heathen lands that do not know the story
of Jesus. Let us remember that we are told
to send out the gospel to all lands and people.
Children Hear the Word.

the Rev. Herman L. Duhring, D. D-, of
Philadelphia, special agent of the Board
of Managers for the Lenten offering;
George C. Thomas of Philadelphia, treas
urer of the Domestic and Foreign Mission
ary Society, and by the Right Rev. Sam

of California, a missionary meeting: was
held this afternoon at St. Paul's Episco
pal Church, the children of all of the Epis
copal churches of. Oakland taking part in
this union service. The Rev. Robert
Ritchie, rector of St. Paul's, and the full
vested choir of the church, assisted during
the services.
At St. John's Episcopal Church this
morning-, the sermon was preached by the
Right Rev. Reginald H. Weller Jr., Coad
jutor of Fond du Lac. The Bishop is a
rapid but interesting talker and his ser
mon, with the text "God so loved the
world," was full of beautiful thoughts,
beautifully expressed. He dwelt particu
larly on the humanity of the Savior and
said:
Why did he not come to us \u25a0 a full grown
man? He had the power to do so had he so
wished. But he came as a little baby. There
Is something wonderfully attractive about a
baby. It is so helpless, so dependent upon our
strength and our love. A remarkable thing
about our Lord was that he never lost that
attractiveness, but itÂ« increased with his years.
Because of his humanity, we can feel that God
Is our brother, our master, our king. It will
always be so, because Christ built his empire
on human hearts. No one loves our Lord aa
Mary does, as Joseph does. And why? Because
during his helpless babyhood he was dependent
on them. His welfare, his very existence de
pended on their love and care. But now it is
not them, it is you he depends on. He depends
on your love, he wants your love. The highest
angel in heaven would like to stand where I
stand, to speak to men's hearts of him. I
wonder why It has been left to me? Because
he depends on men to build up his church, to
support his religion. God trusts. conflde3 in
us. Shall we betray that trust?
Would that some heart in this house of
prayer to-day awake and give back to God
love for love. Some of us to give more, some
of us to do more, all of us to love more. God
so loved the world. # .
At St John's Church.
it is due a large measure of the success of
the grospel of Christ. If Its work were not
so faithfully carried on it would be used as
an argument against our religion. " :

STANDARD TIMEâ A. P. G., City. Pri
marily, for the convenience of the rail
roads, a standard of time was established
by mutual agreement in 1883, by which
trains are run and local time regulated.
According to this system, the United
States, extending from 65 degrees to 125
degrees, west, longitude, is divided into
four time sections, each of 13 degrees of
longitude, exactly equivalent to one hour.
The first (eastern) section includes all ter*
ritory between the Atlantic coast and an
irregular line drawn from Detroit to
Charleston, - S. C, the latter being its
most southern point. The second (central)
section includes all the territory between
the last-named line and an irregular line
from Bismarck, N. D., to the mouth of
the Rio Grande. The third (mountain*
section includes all territory between the
last-named line and nearly the western
borders of Idaho. Utah and Arizona. The
fourth (Pacific) section covers the rest ot
the country to the Pacific Coast. Standard
time is uniform inside each of these sec
tions, and the time of each section differs
from that next to it by exactly one hour
Thus at 12 noon In New York City (east
ern time), the time at Chicago (central
time) is 11 0 clock a. m.; at Denver (moun
tain time), 10 o'clock a. m. and at San
Francisco (Pacific time), 9 o'clock a m
Standard time Is sixteen minutes slower
at Boston than true local time, 4 minutes
slower at New York, S minutes faster at
Washington, 10 minutes faster at Charles

CONSUL GENERAL STOWE of Cape
Town, in the October number of Consular
Reports, gives a gloomy account of the pres
ent conditions of trade in South Africa, but an
nounces that the prospects of future trade are much
brighter than would have been expected of a country
that has been so harried and wasted by war.
Of the present situation he says: "The war. drags
along, trade in the Transvaal and the Orange River
Colony languishes; . the fields are bare, and practi
cally no planting has been attempted. Several thou
sand Uitlanders have returned to Johannesburg to
prepare the mines for future operations. A number
of these are at present engaged in working up the ore
mined before the outbreak of the war, but the mines
cannot be run at the full capacity until the return of
the native refugees/ which will probably not be until
after the cessation of hostilities." .
War has not been the only thing that has interfered
with trade. The Consul notes that there is a large
amount of merchandise and machinery at the ports
awaiting transportation to the interior, but just at the
time the railways were released from military traffic
so that they might handle the commercial shipments
there came a panic fear of the bubonic plague that
checked business^ prevented the moving of trains,
caused an exodus of the population and upset values.
Under' such circumstances the discharging of cargo
was "slow, and the Consul says: "At one time there
were in the harbor no fewer than 'ioo steamships and
quite as many sailing vessels, with cargoes valued at
nearly $25,000,000." : ~<f?fÂ£Â£

The cereal markets have shown little change dur
ing the week, the Government report issued Thurs
day being considered bearish on oats and bullish on
corn, though the changes in crop conditions were
not sufficient to produce any violent variation in
prices. Exports of wheat for the week fell off jome
what, owing to favorable crop prospects in the
Argentine and the United States, and to heavy offer
ings of Russian wheat "in England, but were still
large.
The country's failures for the week were 231,
against 232 for the same week last year. This is a
noteworthy change for the better, as the failures thus
far this year have generally been more numerous
than last year, though of srrlall liabilities as a rule.
Conditions in Wall street did not vary much last
week. The market was irregular and subject to brief
fluctuations, leaving the net proposition not far from
where it was at the close of the preceding week.
On this coast there are few new features. Since
the termination of the strike we have been doing an
increased business, and the commercial decks are
being rapidly cleared of large lines of merchandise
accumulated during the labor trouble, Renewed ac
tivity is seen in almost all lines, the downtown
streets arc thronged with drays and trucks, and the
wharves present their normal bustling aspect. Most
merchants say that business was never better at this
time of the year. .
Last week was one of many similar ones. Its very
activity made it devoid of especial feature. The bank
clearings showed the usual gain over the correspond
ing week in 1900, and the different sections of the
country reported the same unvarying active demand
for merchandise. This prosperity is making rather
monotonous reading, if making money can be said
to ever become monotonous. The distributive trade
fell oft somewhat in the West and Northwest, owing
to wet and warm weather, while several Southern
markets reported delayed collections, owing to the
restricted movement -in cotton. The Western job
bers reported less call for dry goods, clothing and
shoes, but these lines generally ease off in activity
at this time of the j'ear, when the wholesale stocks
have been completed.
But what may be called progressive work, such as
construction of buildings and appliances for manu
facturing, continues with unabated activity to such
an extent, indeed, that the iron and steel mills are
running to their full capacity to keep even with their
new orders and catch up with their old ones â some
thing that few have thus far been able to do, many
of them having work enough ahead to keep them em
ployed until well along into next year. The foot
wear factories all over the country report business
lively, and there is no immediate prospect of any
lower prices, especially as hides and leather a're firm,
with a pronounced tendency toward- still higher
prices. The Eastern shipments of boots and shoes
are twelve per cent larger than at this time last year.
There is less activity in dry goods, as mentioned
above, but sellers are very firm, and are in many in
stances asking prices above the views of buyers, both
at home and abroad.
ALL over the country there is a brisk demand
for goods, comprehending the usual fall and
winter, and in some lines even the spring de
mand. The movement is said to be remarkable. This
word has been used so often to characterize trade
during the past three cr four years that the public is
beginning to accept i+ as a regular descriptive ex
pression. Several times this year a slackening off of
business seemed at hand, and every time the lull
proved only a matter of a few days, being succeeded
b}' lively orders for merchandise from all over the
country. And this has been the course of trade for a
long time. No such prosperity has ever been experi
enced in the United States, and the end is evidently
not yet. S

A stranger to San Francisco might -well inquire
with surprise Why all those corporations should em
ploy the same attorney, and how it is that the one
man can serve them all, since each of them neces
sarily has a large amount of law business to occupy
the attention of its counsel. " The resident of San
Francisco, however, feels no surprise on the subject.
The services which Herrin renders to the corpora
tions do not keep him busy poring over law books.
They are of a nature which lead him to employ as
associate counsel such men as Kelly and Crimmins.
They are not so fatiguing to the brain as exhausting
to the conscience.
Had,he been a man of any. greatness of ideas or of
any tact, Herrin might have made his power useful
alike to the community and to his employers. He has,
however, preferred to associate with the lowest bosses
of politics rather than with the business elements of
the city, and to elect corrupt or corruptible' men to
office rather than to support good men. He has,
therefore, made enemies for every corporation he has
served, and has done them more harm than good.
He has so mismanaged the affairs of his employers
that they are now virtually compelled to stand in with
and support the worst elements of municipal politics
because Herrin has brought them into a position of
antagonism to the better elements.
With his dismissal from the Market Street Rail
way law department Herrin's power will to that ex
tent be curtailed. Then it will be for President Har
riman to determine how much longer he will retain
at the head of the law department of the Southern
Pacific Company "a man who' g;ves so much of his
time to other corporations, so much to private prac
tice, so much to associating with Kelly and with
Crimmins, much to corrupting Supervisors and
so much to alienating from the road the favor and
the friendship of merchants, of manufacturers -and of
the community as a whole.
Herrin's relations to the corporations of, which he
acts as attorney have been peculiar. If he devoted
himself strictly to law matters, or if he undertook a
faithful supervision. of the law business of the South
ern Pacific Company,. he would have enough to do in
the work of that corporation alone to occupy his time
and employ all of his energies. It happens, how
ever, that the. kind of service he renders under the
name of "law" is of sr.ch a nature that he serves not
only the Southern Pacific, but the Market Street
Railway, the gas company and water company as
weii. . - " ' ' \u25a0 ; ... .
WITH the transfer of the Market Street
Railway system to a syndicate of Baltimore
capitalists who operate street railways as a
matter of business and 'not for politics, there will
come to the people of San Francisco many benefits.
One of the most important of these will be a cur
tailment of the pow<r of W. F. Herrin, who will no
longer hold the position of attorney for the road.
THE ELIMINATION OF HERRIN.
The organization -in London of a tobacco trust

The French battleship Jena reflects
great credit on the expedition shown In
construction and the satisfactory result of
her trials. Her keel was laid at the Brest
dockyard, January 15, 189S, and the launch
took place September 1 of the same year.
On-January 19 last the ship went to sea
to undergo trials under medium speed and
everything worked well, a mean speed of
fourteen knots .with 5100 horsepower being
attained. Four subsequent trials of four,
six, six and twenty-four hours, under
varying conditions, have taken place with
gratifying results, her average speed with
maximum horsepower being 17.4 knots
during six hours. Neither engines nor her
twenty water-tube boilers gave any
trouble' whatever. The. Jena is of 12,052

take third place in the list of the world's
naval powers.
Five destroyers, or high-sea . torpedo
boats, have been contracted for. to "be
built at the Germania yards," Kiel, for the
German navy. ; Their ( horsepower .will be
600(5, or about 1 the same power as that of
the coast defense 'ship Lachsen, a vessel
twenty times larger than built twenty
four years ago. The acceptance trlal3
are severe in the German navy and there
is no chance for "jockeying," or getting
up artificial speed. The vessel is manned
entirely by naval officers, navy engineers,
firemen and machinists and the series of
trials are no less than six in number, the
successful outcome of all being pretty
sure to establish â¢ the efficiency of the
boat. The most important is the so
called "storm trial," in which "the tor
pedo-boat-destroyer must pass four hours
on the open sea,with a force of wind of
thirty-five to . sixty-five miles an hour,
the propellers making a -number, of revo
lutions corresponding to fifteen knots in
smooth water and upon the behavior of
the boat under these conditions depends
its acceptance or declination.

EXCLUDES ANARCHISTIC YELLOW JOURNAL
THE bird of freedom is the generally
accepted ornament serving as a
figurehead on American war ves
â¢ sels. It is- bronze â¢ casting and: is
as much apart of the ship as the
ke >I plate or any, portion of the , ma
chinery. The appropriation bill providing
for the building- ; of new ships has this
provision since 1890: "In all their parts
said vessels shall be of domestic manu
facture." Prior to 1889 there were certain
articles such as hpllow shafting and par
ticular steel castings which it was found
necessary to import, but this necessity
no longer exists, yet the- law is being con
stantly violated and parts of engines
have been purchased in Europe. The
latest instance of disregard of the law
referred to -is- the arrival in New York
on October 5 of the British*, steamer
Maristow from Havre with -six cases of
bronze eagles to decorate United States
war vessels. The work was done .In
France, where the workmen receive $150
a day, against $3 50 paid to our work
men. The work could have been done
as well in this country and it is to be
presumed that only the comparative
cost prompted violation of spirit and let
ter of the law.
Four torpedo boats recently completed
for the United States navy have passed
successful trials, all exceeding their con
tract speed. The Shubrick, calculated to
make twenty-six knots, made 26.75; Bag
ley and Barney exceeded their contract
for twenty-eight knots by 1.2 and 1.1
knots, and the Bailey made 30.2 knots, or
.2 knots over the contract. The new tor
pedo-boat-destroyers have been less suc
cessful, notably the Perry, which reached
a maximum speed of only 28.20 knots, or
.8 knots short of the contract, although
the horsepower was 7752, or 752 in excess
of the power calculated. The failure was
due to defective design and several boats
similarly affected are having their sterns
reconstructed with a view to overcoming
the defect in speed.
The growth of the German navy since
1879 has been almost as phenomenal as
that of Japan. The naval' force In 1879
was seventy-four ships of all classes,
which ten years later had increased to
198. By 1920 the navy will include thirty
eight battleships,* twenty large and forty
five small cruisers, and Germany will
able to keep station during the recent na
val maneuvers at thirteen and onÂ«-half
knots only. The ship was', launched In 1S93
and is credited with a trial speed of 17.5
knots, and the deterioration, in her sU
years' service is something remarkable,
equaling that of our Indiana and Iowa,
which in a couple of year**: became nina
and eleven-knot battleships, although their
trial "speeds had been Â£3*17 and 17.057
knots, respectively.
The -Syren, torpedo-boat destroyer, built
by Palmer at Jarrow-on-Tyne, has made
her official trial and averased 670S horse
power and thirty knots for tlaree hours. Iu
six runs over the measured mile course.
the horsepower was 6689 and the speed
29.812 knots'. â¢ I
Japan is rapidly developing shipbuilding
operations in Its dockyards and within
five years will be independent of foreign
shipbuilders. At the present two protected
cruisers, named Niikata and Tsushima,
each of 3120 tons displacement, are being
built at'the Yokosuko dockyard. They are
334.6 feet in length, 43.76 feet b<am and 18
feet drausht. with engines of MOO horse
power, calculated to give a speed of twen
ty knots. Four destroyers of 381 tons and
twenty-nine knots speed are aso being
built at that yard, while at the Kure dock
yard six torpedo boats of 152 1 tons and
twenty-nine knots are in course of con
struction.
The armor and steel plant nov beinj? es
tablished by the Japanese Government is
estimated to cost $3468,732 and Jo be com
pleted in five years.
The Russian Pacific squadron will in*
the future consist of six battleships, eight
armored-- cruisers, seven seafoingr gun
boats, two torpedo transports} five tor
pedo-boat-destroyers and a flotilla of tor
pedo boats. The agienregate displacement
of this fleet is 143.524 tons. dj-rying 21S
heavy guns and 686 smaller qilck-flrers.
Spain has ordered two school ihips built
by contract- They are to be oj 2500 tons
displacement, ship rig-ged and -tfith auxil
iary engines to give a speed qf twelvo
knots, and a coal capacity for 4 cruising
radius of 2000 miles. The baturies will
consist of eight six-pounders, tw> smaller
guns and and two torpedo tubes.
Rhodes is quite safe in putting any color he chooses
upon the bribe he says he paid, for both Schnad
horst and Gladstone are dead, and ' neither can
confront him. But we believe the character of Glad
stone stands in testimony that nothing can impeach
against the implied charge that Rhodes evidently de
sires to make. At present the Liberal party is,, in
such a condition of demoralization that Rhodes can
hardly hurt it, and the Conservative party, led by
Lord Salisbury, is in such a position that nothing
can help it. It is held together solely because there
is no opposition to which -men can safely go, and it
will retain power indefinitely, until new issues arise
and compel a new partisan alignment. These issues
are not at present apparent in the germ. The Jionor
and integrity of the empire have been made to de
pend upon the complete conquest of South. Africa
and the extermination of the Boers, and while Eng
lishmen chafe at the delay and at the cost of the war,
and criticize the Ministry, they have no choice but
to support it.
It is probable that Schnadhorst, like many other
campaign managers, was willing to replenish the
party treasury from any source and to make any bar
gain that would bring money. These things are in
cident to politics and campaigns, and such bargains
are repudiated by the real leaders more frequently
than they are kept. Special bargains have been made,
in campaign emergencies in this country, and usu
ally have led to trouble. Lincoln was involved in
one by his managers in the Republican National
Convention of i860, by which they obligated him to
put Simon Cameron in the Cabinet, an appointment
that led to no end of trouble and scandal, that finally
compelled the President to expel Cameron and ap
point Stanton. The treaty of Mentor, between Gar
field and Conkling, was another bargain made in the
necessities of a campaign, to be broken by the Presi
dent, and the breach brought in its train many tragic
and grievous consequences.
But neither Lincoln nor Garfield ever became in
volved in a transaction that made necessary a promise
to violate party principle or sell out a party policy.
This is the intended implication of the affair which
Rhodes has divulged, and the world will not believe
that Gladstone was a party to any such arrangement.
His political career knew many 1 reverses, and the ups
and downs of his public life make an intensely inter
esting chapter in the history of British politics, but
he never purchased power by a sacrifice of principle.
In justice to. his great rival, Disraeli, the same must
be said of him, and of the other great party leaders
of England in the nineteenth century. The princi
ples of parties in Great Britain were as definite as in
this country during the last century, and there, as
here, parties were willing to die but not to surrender.
He declares that he bargained with Schnadhorst, a
Liberal campaign manager,' that for the sum of Â£5000
the British army was to be left in Egypt by Glad-,
stone, and that Ireland was to retain representation
in the British Parliament, no matter what Home Rule ,
bill was passed. As for the latter, there would have
been no inconsistency in giving Ireland home rule
and representation in the Imperial Parliament. That
is a plan that has been canvassed to secure the gen
eral Parliamentary federation of Great Britain and
all the crown colonies. They could well have home
rule and each its own Parliament to legislate in all
local concerns, and representation in the Imperial
Parliament to take care of their interests in the fed
erated empire. Such a system would be exactly like
ours, for here the States have home rule and home
legislation and a representation in Congress in re
spect to their Federal interests and relations. There
would have been no sacrifice of principle in the adop
tion of such a system by Gladstone. Nor is it clear
that he held as a cardinal principle of his politics
that Egypt should be evacuated, though Rhodes re
garded his attitude upon that subject with suspicion.
.To make out a case against Gladstone's memory,
however, Mr. Rhodes must establish the fact that
the bargain with Schnadhorst was known to and ap
proved by Gladstone, the leader of the Liberal party.
Of this he submits no evidence, and therefore his
revelation fails as an impeachment of the integrity
of the Grand Old Man. . *T
MR. GLADSTONE seemed to belong so much
- to all mankind that human interest in his
name and fame will long survive in the
world.
Because of this the recent letter of Cecil Rhodes
excites great interest, far outside of England. Rhodes
seems to seek to put Gladstone in the position of_
having sold out his own principles and the policy of
his party for a campaign contribution of .Â£5000. It
is true that Rhodes has, in making this revelation/
the pretext of a denial of the transaction by Sir Wil
liam Vernon Harcourt and Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, which impeached his veracity. But that
denial was apparently' provoked by him for the pur
pose of opening the way to his full narrative of the
affair. \u25a0

190a The increase is due' of course to the demand
for war supplies and foodstuffs. With the return of
peace the war demand .will fall off, but the Consul
believes the reviving industries of the people will
more than compensate for any diminution^ on that
score. .\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0-\u25a0
In speaking of the future he says: "It is said plans
are matured for expending $50,000,000 in new rail
ways; that several thousand miles of telegraph lines
are to be erected and renewed; that $5,000,000 is to
be expended for public works and $15,000,000 on har

in Natal; that $25,000,000 or more is to be expended
in the Transvaal ami a like amount in Orange River
Colony." â¢
The machinery and the material used in these
works will of course be obtained from the quarter
where they can be had cheapest, for South Africa
will have no money to spare- when the task of re
building begins., There is therefore a chance for
Americans to enter the market in competition with
the British. The Consul says: "Our trade for 1899

ness their trade will be again open. to us, and in time
a great improvement will be witnessed, particularly
in Johannesburg. The streets will be properly paved

stalled. A beginning has been made in opening up"
the mines, hotels and stores. Goods are being for
warded by the military authorities. ; As soon as mer
chants have ample stocks the military stores will be
closed." "
It will be seen, then, that the outlook for trade in
South- Africa is' by no means bad. The vast amount
of Government work to be done will be particularly
.attractive to American manufacturers, and so the
ruin that has been wrought by British war will be
remedied to a large extent by American industry
and enterprise.

AT STANFORD
Jacob's ladder, the preacher pointed
out, was a symbol of the Christ. Christ
waa sent to earth to be the mediator be
tween man and God. His qualifications
for this office were his intimate acquaint
ance with human nature and his ability
to share the thoughts of the Supreme
Being. Like Jacob's ladder the Christ
character rested on earth and reached to
the great white throne.-
He told how Jacob, after realizing the
omnipresence of God,' determined to Jive
down his past and how he so succeeded
that God changed his name from Jacob
or the supplanter. to Israel. He com
pared Jacob's experience with that of the
young man who is reared In a religious
atmosphere and going out into* the world
leaves behind him the* teachings of his
youth. He recommended the example of
Jacob's struggle against a naturally base
nature and pointed out the shining top
of the ladder as the goah where reward
awaits all such persistent effort.
Bishop Morrison of Duluth preached
yesterday afternoon at the King's Daugh
ters' Home, 317 Francisco street. A num
ber of visitors attended the service.
Homer Henley contributed a solo and
members of St. Peter's choir lent tha as
sistance of their voices to the choral part
of a service that will be long remem
bered by the inmates of the home. Rev.
W. M. Bours, rector of St. Peter's Epis
copal Church, conducted the service.
Bishop Morrison used as his text the
last verso of the first chapter of St.
John, "And he saith unto him, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall
see Heaven open and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the son
of irian."
The right! reverend visitor spoke in part
as follows: \u25a0 . . -.
"These words refer us back to an ear
lier chapter in Bible history; to the
promise made by God to Jacob at Bethel.
Jacob, you will remember, was in flight
from the wrath of his brother, Esau. His
scheme for securing a fortune had failed
and he found himself a fugitive and ab
solutely dependent upon hia own efforts
for whatever measure of prosperity the
future^ might hold for him. . â¢
â¢Jacob's only hope lay in finding? iiis
wealthy uncle. It 'was during this search
that he had the wonderful vision of the

JESUS CHRIST
THE MEDIATOR
Contrast the condition of women to-day with
the condition of women at the Roman courts.
The generatiorÂ»vto-day are calling woman
blessed because she is the mother of the son
of God. The rule at Rome was. to put the
crippled and deformed children on the hills to
be torn by wild beasts. How is it to-day that
the house with the cross on it stands on these
hills and outstretched hands wait to receive
these children? Such things come directly and
immediately from that open grave where the
eleven men are standing, saying. "He has
risen." There is more evidence for the truth
of Jesus Christ's resurrection from the dead
than for any other fact in the world. If be
cause of that evidence I yield my will to him.
I am Joined to him am saved. 1 will be saved
saved here In this world, that I may resist tha
temptations of the world around me. "
Remember that God almighty is seeking to
make character. He wants to make me to bÂ«
something else, not to be counted something
else. \u25a0 Believe in him, not in my theory about
him nor in another man's theory about him.
â¢'Can I believe that man gone down to death
can arise again?" That Is the question that
men and women all over this country are ask
ing, not with flippancy, but with tears and a
tremor In their voices. Do not denounce men
who are asking: this question. It is too easy
to make hard words take the place of hard
arguments. -Shall I tell my friend that just
as he came through the closed doors of the
supper room, at Jerusalem, so has he come
through tho closed doors of my heart? But
my best friend has said, "I don't deny tha
spiritual visitation on your part.' but there has
been none such on my part." Shall I tell him
that he has the book in which to find proof and
let him make answer that it has been torn >to
pieces by scientists; that he cannot understand
the scriptures because they are old? I have
come this day to declare not a theory, dogma
or supposition, but a fact that God has raised
Jesus Christ from the dead.
Saint Paul, who wrote this .epistle to the
Romans, was no. Ignorant fisherman. He waa

Bishop Dudley took as his text Romans

mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
in thine heart that God hath raised him
from the dead thou shalt be saved." He
spoke very eloquently and with great feel
ing, saying in part:
Bishop Wells Interspersed his address
with many pathetic and humorous anec
dotes. As illustrating the zeal of men
who traveled thousands of miles in order
that they might locate their home near a
church, he told of a man who left his
home in Iowa with a sick wife in order
to settle In Washington. When they
reached the settlement in which the Bish
op at that time was residing, the first
object to attract the emigrant's attention
was a gilded church spire. In a voice trem
bling with emotion, he called to his wife,
but she answered him not. On turning he
found her cold In death. Then came a
snowstorm, in the midst of which he
reached \u25a0 the Episcopal residenceâ a poor
log hut. There the Bishop welcomed the
stricken husband and father, and made his
miserable lot comfortable. On the follow
ing day the remains of the wife and
mother were laid to rest on the bleak hill
side within the shadow of the church she
had traveled so far to see, yet never be
held. The speaker- related -other anec
dotes Illustrative of the practical work
being done by missionaries In the cause of
Christ in the great Northwest, and closed
his address with a plea to all to remain
steadfast in the labor imposed upon them
by God and the church for the regenera
tion of men.
Bishop Leonard of Salt Lake followed
with an Interesting account of, the work
being done In the missionary field in
Utah, Nevada and Colorado. Of the 400,000
people in his lurisdiction, 250,000 are Mor
mons. Yet the situation wa3 most en
couraging. Polygamy was in Its death
throes, and according to the- speaker It
will have died out with another genera
tion. Resuming, he said:
"The church is growing rapidly In my
district in despite of many difficulties. We
are erecting houses of worship, and not
one of them is encumbered with debt. That
there is a wide field for missionary work I
can assure you. One day I went to a town
In Nevada and talked to the children in
Sunday-school about Christ. I asked them
if they could tell me who and what Christ
was. One girl said she could. I asked
her if Christ was a man like me, and she
replied, 'No, he was a good man.' On
another occasion I went to a place in
Colorado where, one Sunday, a special col
lection- was taken up for the cause. A
rough miner was asked to pass around the
hat, and the first man put in twenty-five
cents. The miner, pointing a revolver at
the head of the man. made the announce
ment that- no donation , under a dollar
would be received. The result was one of
the largest collections in the history of
the church. This zeal, when the religious
spirit is once aroused, accomplishes won
ders. I believe In advertising the church
as a business man does his wares. When
I travel, I travel like a drummer for a bus
iness house. I let everyone know that I
am a. servant of the Master. Sometimes I
am mistaken for another. One day, while
on a train in Utah, I observed a woman
eyeing me, as well as my grips, which, I
confess, had a very business-like appear
ance. Finally she asked me if I would
not kindly lend her my corkscrew, as she
had a. bottle of wine she desired to uncork
â¢ While 'I could not provide the desired ar
ticle, I was gratified to learn 'that I had
a business-like air. about me. What we
The subject of missionary work was
the theme discussed last evening in a
very entertaining manner by three Bish
ops at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church.
The Bishops were Rt. Rev. Funsten of
Boise, Idaho; Rt. Rev. Wells of Spokane,
Wash., and Rt. Rev. Leonard of Salt
Lake/City.
Bishop Funsten was Introduced after
the praise service. He said he was glad
to see signs of vigorous growth " in St.
Stephen's Church. His experience taught
him that it was much easier to talk with
progressive than non-progressive people.
Resuming, he said:
"Material progress means spiritual
progress. To those who have the true
missionary spirit the work of extending
the kingdom of Jesus Christ is one of
supreme pleasure. In the jurisdiction of
Boise we are working zealously. That
city, being the capital of the common
wealth, exerts an Influence and Impor
tance far beyond anything the size of
its population would seem to warrant. My
missionary district is 600 miles long and
about 200 miles wide, the tract embrac
ing 112,000 square miles of territory. We
cannot cbmpare with your proud State of
California, except, perhaps, in earnest
ness of purpose. Since I came to this city
I. with many others, have felt that the
greatness of this State does not exceed
your hospitality, nor does the magnifi
cence of your resources equal your Inter
est in the affairs of our church."
The speaker then alluded to the charac
ter of the people of the missionary dis
trict of Boise. The residents of the coun
try, forests and mountains, he said, 'were
unaccustomed to the comforts of civiliza
tion such as are found in the older com
munities, but they represented the true
spirit of American citizenshipâ that spirit
which enabled them to adapt themselves
uncomplainingly to circumstances. Men
engaged In the mines thought too much
of material and not enough of spiritual
things. Yet the work of rescuing men
and women was progressing most satis
factorily. Among the Indians, too, the
gospel was spreading, there having been
122 Indians baptized on the reservations
last 'year. Throughout the entire district
the Christian spirit among men was
growing, and the promises of the future
were most brilliant.
Bishop Wells of Spokane was the next
speaker. He illustrated in a practical
way the missionary work being done in
Eastern Washington. When he went
into the field there was one town of less
than 1000 people, and of that number
there were only six church communi
cants. Since that time 18 church build
ings have been erected, with 3 diocesan
schools and 1 hospital. Instead of 1 town
with 1000 Inhabitants there are now in
the district 30 towns numbering from 1000
to. 30,000 people. The vast extent of terri
tory, as well as the remoteness of com
municants from houses of worship, ren
dered ministration more or less diffi
cult.

Bishop of Albany, preached at Grace
Church yesterday morning and In the
evening the sermon was delivered by-
Right Rev. William. Nellson McVlcker.
Bishop Coadjutor of Rhode Island. Both
services were largely attended.
Bishop McVicker, the gentle, genial
giant of the convention, took for his text
the thirty-first verse of the sixth chapter
of St. Mark: "And he said unto them
come ye yourselves apart into a desert
place and rest a while."
He said in part: "These are the words
of Jesus to his twelve closest and best
beloved friends. They are full of exquisite
tenderness and thought. The twelve dis
ciples have just returned from, their first
missionary journey. They are tired and
discouraged and their spirits have been
further dampened by the news of the
death of John the Baptist. They are un
strung and worn out. They come to Jesus
full of fear at the\turn things have taUen,
full of perplexity and doubt. He Invites
them to 'come apart and rest a while.'
"Alone! Alone with their Master. Alone
with the teacher that had opened their
eyes to the new life. Alone with their
comforter in many a dark hour In the
past. We are not told what happened In
those moments. We can realize their
anxious questioning and his patient, com
forting explanation., We can imagine his
telling them that nothing has happened
which he did not predict when- they took
up the burden of his work. We can pic
ture them in that quiet desert sanctuary
gradually finding rest for their wrought
up nerves, peace for their anxious hearts
as they listen to the words of friendly art
monition from the lips of their beloved
Master.
"Have^we never felt in our own lives
the strength-giving influence of contact
with some one stronger, better, wiser,
nearer to God' than ourselves? Oh, this
wonderful American life! Where Is it go
ing to lead us? When do we ever take
the time to 'take ourselves to a desert
place and rest a while'? In the old days
men found time for these periods of rest,
but nowadays men even die with a rush
Instead. of peacefully wearing away as did
our forefathers.
"But rest we must have if we wish to
maintain our proper place among the na
tions of the earth. People of America! a
nation that never finds time to go apart
has no time for the best that is in this
life. In our Sunday we have this oppor
tunity. On Sunday we can go apart and
rest a while. Let us preserve our Sunday
to this purpose.

Ross denies emphatically that he was at
the Carlson house Saturday afternoon. He
said after he left 1419 Taylor street he
went down town and asserted that he
could produce a number of witnesses who
saw him on Montgomery street about the
time he is accused of having been on
Sixth avenue. After the hubbub made by
the women over the loss of the $500 he
went down town and had several drinks
before going to his rooms at 121 Mont
gomery street. He has only been married
a few months and hints that his wife is to
blame for his arrest.
Ross has been in several scrapes recent
ly. He was accused some months ago of
signing Judge Kerrigan's name to a de
cree of divorce in the case of Frank Kel
ler. Proceedings were brought against
him for disbarment, but were quashed. He
has also been arrested twice for embez
zling funds of clients, but the cases were
dismissed.

the case and, accompanied by Carlson,
went to Ross' room at 121 Montgomery
street. He was asleep in bed. Dillon found
a $20 gold piece In his bureau drawer dur
ing a search for the money, and when
they woke Ross up he was told of what
he was accused. He denied it and said
all the money he had was 15 or 20 cents.
In his pockets was $5 50, and when asked
about the $20 found In his bureau drawer
he said he knew nothing: about it.
Dillon and Crockett ascertained that
Teller Richter of the California Bank, who
lives at 157 Sixth avenue, saw a man an

gate at the Carlson home and go to the
rear, -about 4:30 Saturday afternoon. He
described the man to his wife, who re
marked it must be Attorney Ross. The
detectives found a jack knife c'ose to the
trunk with a broken blade that had been
taken from the kitchen to force the trunk
open.
J." K. Ross, an attorney, was arrested
yesterday morning In his room, 121 Mont
gomery street, by Detectives Dillon and
Crockett and booked at the City Prison
on a charge of grand larceny.
Ross is accused of having stolen $500
belonging to Mrs. Rheinholdt Hohshuter.

Mrs. Harns, a widow living at 1419 Taylor
street. She is Mrs. Carlson's mother. Sat
urday afternoon Mrs. Holzhuter and Mrs.
Carlson called upon Mrs. Ross. Ross was
there. and remarked that he would "treat"
them, but he had only 5 cents. He left the
house in a few minutes and returned in
about two hours, telling them that he had
plenty of money and was going into busi
ness with a friend. Mrs. Carlson and Mrs.
Holzhuter left for home about- 7 o'clock
in the evening and when they reached
there they found the rear door open. Mrs,

After the addresses the congregation
heard closing prayers and benediction by
Bishop Nichols, all then joining in the
singing of the Coronation hymn.
"!No man ever succeeds in this world unless
he is earnest I say be earnest in your work

an interesting account of the work
among the peopls'of North Dakota, recit
ing- some entertaining stories of his ox
periences among the Indians In the
Northwest. He told the children that
they could all be missionaries right at

cans of this city. There were possibly
1000 present to greet him. Assisted by the
pastor, a considerable part of the Bpisco
pal service was- fallowed, and the splen
did choir rendered very appropriate and
beautiful selections.
The sermon was based upon the Acts of
the Apostles, in which Peter and John
testified to the waiting multitudes as they
preached "that they, could but speak of
the things they "had seen and heard."
After explaining the context the Bishop
told of the efforts of the early church to
preach, the Gospel to all nations, both
Jews and gentiies. - He said: \u25a0
"Jeeus Christ was their leader, so that
wherever they went they were not alone,,
but with Jesus. There is no other way to
go forward in any line of Christian ser
vice, and being soldiers for him, he would
never desert us as our captain. The
Lord's Prayer which you spoke this morn
ing: in your beds/ and which we together
united in repeaMng- to-night, should come
\u25a0with great force and power upon us as
Christians.
" 'Our father' means' that he Is the
father of us in San Franciscoâ in Amer
ica. But it does not stop there. Our is
plural, and means that he is our father
in Africa as well as In Europe and Amer
ica. So I come to you to-night to ask
you to remember your heathen brethren
in far-away, dark Africa. lam praying
that large numbers of young "men and
young women, such as. I find In San Fran
cisco and In all this land, will hear the
call and will offer themselves to go with
me and help redeem our native African
brethren from the curse of sin, error and
superstition." \u25a0 y
The Bishop was clad In hfs clerical robes
and with a great deal of nervous energy
delivered an interesting discourse. He
said that he was born in Charleston, S.
C.Â» and was taken by his slave parents
when he was only 6 years old to Liberia.
He was early converted, and at 20 was
made a lay worker in the Episcopal
church. Later he was ordained a deacon,
and then a 'priest. After many years of
labor he was, in 1884. consecrated in Grace
Episcopal Church. New York City, to the
missionary bishopric of Cape Palmas. Li
beria, West Africa, where for sixteen
years he has had absolute supervision of
that work.
He closed his sermon by announcing that
on "Wednesday night, together with Right
Rev. James Theodore Holly, D. D., Bishop
of Haytl, West Indies, he would lecture
at Bethel Church, by the courtesy of Rev.
Dr. Nelson, the pastor, and would then
tell the people of the progress and present
needs of their respective mission fields.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13.â Only 200 persons
turned out at Pastime Park to-day to see
the American Waterloo Derby for grey
hounds decided. The weather conditions
were disagreeable, a driving rain falling.
Notwithstanding this the Derby and the
all-age stake resulted in some good work
by the hounds. The Derby resulted in a
surprise, as it \u25a0went to Linlethgow Lass, a
California puppy, owned by P. J. TJwyer of
st Louis, 'iroublesome, owned by Allen
& Wilson of Chicago, and Lord Brazen,
entered by B. F. Jackson of St. Louis, the
favorites for the Derbv. finished well up

ciding course.

ported greyhound owned fr" J. J. Lavin
of St. Louis, we from Mac's Melody, en
tered by T. W. Bartels. of Denver.
,Tne diamond if laid in the sun and then
cErrried into a dark room shows distinct
phosphorescence.
Other recommendations are that the
caliber of tv>p cavalry revolver be en
larged, and that the knapsack or pack be
supplied .to the Infantry soldier in placs
of the blanket bag now in use. A signifi
cant statement by Chief Surgeon Kimball
of this department is that "with compara
tively few exceptions youths under 20
years of age are not able to bear up un
der the hardships and privations of an
active campaign and serve only to incum
ber the hospitals and to diminish the ef
ficiency of the army."
Surprising progress toward the goal of
self-support by the Apache prisoners of
war is recorded in an appendix by Cap
tain Sayre, in charge of those prisoners.
He shows that they now have on hand
2784 head of cattle of their own raising,
that they have built many miles of new
fences and repaired as much more of the
old, and that no clothing was issued to
them during the year. On the other hand,
these Indians are suffering severely from
tuberculosis, contracted while in captiv
ity in Florida, and there were thirteen
more deaths than births among them.
They are declared to be generally a moral.
Industrious, truthful, honest and docile
people.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â General Henry
C. Merriam, commander of the Depart
ment of the Missouri, in his annual report
devotes particular attention to the neces
sity of better drill work by the soldiers
caused by the incoming of many recruits.
General Merriam says there is a notion
too often prevalent in the army, especially
among the older officers, that a soldier
who has once learned the details of the
drill regulations may be excused from
drill without detriment, forgetting that
bodies of men can maintain the power of
collective action only by frequent collec
tive practice even in the simplest exer
cises.
General Merriam strongly indorses a
recommendation of Captain Michie of the
Twelfth Cavalry for a change in the cav
alry bit. He says that even with the re
cent improvement which renders the bit
less severe upon the mouths of young
horses there is still a considerable per
centage of horses maue victims by undue
seventy in the use of the bit. He believes
a return to the double rein is fully justi
fied for at least half of each troop.
ST JOSEPH. Mo.. Oct. 13.â Several
months ago a prominent attorney of this
city, who had formerly been emploved bv
Pat Crowe, received a draft from *Crowe
from South Africa for legal services ren
dered.
Chief. I ask but I do not expect to g-et
justice. There is some one who wants to out
me away and I know the god of gold.
Crowe says that he has been In South
Africa, fighting with the Boers, recites
reminiscences of the \u25a0war and discusses
the contest. He directs that Chief Dona
hue s reply be made through a local paper,
and says if his offer Is not accepted he
""I!. 1 J*L turn 1Â° ? foreign country, from
which he probably will never return
Chief Donahue said to-night that he
would request thÂ© city and Mr. Cudahy
to withdraw the rewards offered for
Crowe, with the provision that Crowe sur
render himself. He said that If Crowe
gave himself up he would be given all the
advantages the law provided
Edward A. Cudahy said to-night: "I am
opposed to entering into any special ne
gotiations for the return of Crowe. It is
only a matter of time when he will be ap
prehended. However. I will withdraw the
reward offered for his arrest and convic
tion.
Your answer to this must bear the signatures
of Edward Cudahy, Governor Savage Sheriff
John Power, Attorney Shields, Chief J J
Donahue and the Judge that fixes the bond.
Mr. Donahue. I want you to understand that
I am not afraid of the combined wealth of all
thÂ© Cudahys on earth and the efforts of all the
scrub detectives that their money can hire The
man that tries to pinch me will bite the dust
for I am ready to die in the mix. I will not be
kangarooed.
I can give a bond for JoCO, and that is all If
the court will not accept that I will remain a
fugitive from Injustice.
Now, Mr. Donahue, I will give myself up to
you if you will promise me upon your word of
honor that I will not be locked up until th*
Jury says "Guilty." And If the jury says that
I will take my punishment like a man, without
a murmur.
Chief Donahue expresses himself as sat
isfied that the letter came from Crowe.
Donahue has known Crowe for several
years and Is acquainted with his manner,
handwriting and style of speech.
The Chiet also received to-day a letter
from Crowe's uncle in Manchester, Iowa,
submitting similar terms for Crowe's sur
render, which leads the police to believe
that they are dealing with the right man.
Crowe in his letter takes the detective
agencies to task, defying them to attempt
his arrest, and continues:
Now. Mr. Donahue, let mo tell you all I ask
la Justice, a fair trial by twelve men, citizens
of Douglass County, Neb. Not by Herod or
any of his kind. Their god 18 gold, and with
that power they rule the world.
Donahue, all I ask Is a square deal. Grant
my request and I will give myself up.
Mr. Cudahy has known me for thirteen years.
He now believes me guilty: nevertheless, I
think he will give me a fair trial, as all he
wants is the public to know the truth.
Crowe says he has known Governor
Savage ever since he was a barefooted
boy on the farm In Iowa, e.vpre3d2i regret
that he (Crowe) L*fl fallen into ill repute.
fi.i-.cl Then laya down the condi'io is (,t hi3
surrender as follows:
OMAHA, Oct. 13.â Chief of Police Don
ahue to-day received a letter from Pat
Crowe, naming the terms on which he will
surrender. The letter came in care of an
Omaha newspaper, in which it is pub
lished, and covers fifteen closely written
pages of manuscript. The postmark Is il
legible, but the letter was mailed at S
o'clock in the morning and reached this
city .at 8 in the evening of the same day.
indicating that it had not traveled a long
distance.
In the letter Crowe agrees to give him
self up at once and stand trial for th<Â»
kidnaping of Eddie Cudahy, provided ha
is not locked up until a jury shall adjudge
him guilty. He says he is unable to fur
nish bonds in excess of $300, and demands
that bail be fixed In that sum.

QKOR'GE SHARMAN'S clever greyhound Little Sister won first honors in
the open stake yesterday at Union Coursing Park, beating Ed Neaye'9
Spiteful pointless In the deciding course.
The talent used poor judgment in making Spiteful the favorite in
the final. Little Sister ran in great form and not unlike her champion
ship style of a short time ago. She had the advantage, too. of having had short
courses. From the slipping of the pair in the final it was plain that Spiteful was
against a hard opponent. Sister led two lengths for the first turn, and picked
up the hare. Spiteful was a 3 to 5 choice.
Roman Athlete had the speed over Spiteful In the semi-final, but was unlucky
in having the hare favor his opponent.
Flora McDonald displayed considerable speed. Her improvement brings her
close to her old stake-winning form.
O'Hara proved the friend of the short-end players. He beat Minnie Sankey
at 3 to 7, outworked Loyal Lad, a 1 to 5 favorite, and secured the flag from
â¢Prompto, a 1 to 2 choice, by a clean score.
The fast youngster A. J. Martin was a 1 to. 4 choice in his go with Ollta In the
second round, but could not make good to his backers. Ollta's experience told
against the young champion, and though he showed the speed Olita's close work
on the hare kept him from scoring further.
"Warship, the stake favorite, was put out by Spiteful in the second round. Ho
was a 2 to 5 choice for the course.
Following are the day's results, with Judge John Grace's official scores:

Frank Carr is the latest man to be sug
gested by his friends for the position of
referee of the Jeffrles-Ruhlin fight. The
big fellows will meet at Harry Corbetfs
on Wednesday to settle this important
question.
In Carter he will meet a man the exact
opposite of Gardner. The latter Ie a
boxer trained for fighting, while the for
mer is a fighter pure and simple. How far
Walcott will go with him at
this game remains to be seen
That he wants to win all his fights
on this coast is well known to his friends.
The betting, in which he has been in
stalled favorite, would indicate that his
friends believe the statement that he was
not in good condition when he met Car
ter in the East. It is generally predicted
the fight will be a slam-bang affair. The
"lucky punch,' â¢ which has sent many
good men down and out, may be expected
to be in evidence when two such hard
hitters commence mixing matters in the
ring.
Phil Wand will referee all three fights
on the programme.
The patrons of boxing in this city will
be afforded another opportunity to-mor
row night of seeing Joe Walcott in ac
tion. He is to lace Kid Carter, and there
is the usual diversity of opinion as to the
outcome. This is no new experience for
Walcott, as there are always a number
of people predicting his defeat every time
he enters the ring.
He blames his former defeat by Carter
to thÂ« fact that- he was not in condition.
He can offer no such excuse this time, as
he is in the best possible trim for a fast
fight. He showed but few signs of dis
tress in his fight with George Gardner,
and has had two weeks in which to fresh
en up a bit.
The impression prevails that Walcott is
a shirker in training, but the contrary is
the case. When he has an important en
gagement he does a lot of work, not
slighting any part of his programme for
the day. either on the road or in the
gymnasium.

the beach the crowd was more dense
than it was in the park. The regular
swimming races, which were scheduled
to take place at the- Sutro Baths, had to
be postponed on account of the large
crowd of bathers in the tank. At the

FATHER McNALLY TO TAKE
REV. MR. MORRISON'S PLACE
Mr. Fogg had resided in Oakland for
twenty-four years, having been actively
engaged in life insurance work most of
that time. He was a native of Maine.
Three children survive him, one of them
being W. \V. Fogg, a teacher In the even
ing schools of San Francisco. There ia
a daughter 16 years, of age and another
son 22 years old.
James L. Fogg, one of the best known
life insurance men in this State, passed
away last night at his residence, 77D
Thirteenth street, death being caused by
paralysis. Mr. Fogg was suddenly
stricken a week ago last Friday while
he was in the back yard of his home.
The stroke was very serious from, the be
ginning, the patient losing the power ot
speech and suffering the impairment of
his other faculties.
Although he was under the almost con
stant attention of physicians. Mr. Fogg
showed no improvement, and slowly suc
cumbed to the attack. It is supposed
that the stroke was caused by Mr. Fogg'3
overactivity. He was a very energetic
man, despite his 65 years, and did a
great deal of work about his home
property and his ranch at Niles. In some
way he overexerted himself, and was
seized with the fatal illness.

At Brigham City the church organiza
tions marched behind the casket from the
railway depot to the cemetery, where the
casket was placed in a specially con
structed vault on the Snow burial grounds
with appropriate ceremony. After the
dedication of the grave the funeral party
returned to Salt Lake City and the last
rites connected with the interment of
the fifth president of the Mormon church
were at an end.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Oct. 13. â The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints, commonly known as the Mormon
church, to-day paid its last tributes to
the remains of Its late president, Lorenzo
Enow. The widespread popularity and
clerical eminence of the deceased drew
to the city church members from every
corner of the State, as well as thousands
of gentiles who had known and respected
the late. Mormon leader. Long before
dawn anxious thousands croweded about
the Snow residence, eagerly waiting for
the doors to open at 7 o'clock that they
might obtain a farewell view of the face
of their beloved president. From 7
until 10 o'clock it is estimated that more
than 2000 people, including nearly all thj
venerable leaders of the church, rever
ently filed beside the casket. Promptly
at 10 o'clock the casket was raised by
the twelve apostles and borne to the
tabernacle, where not less than 20,000
people had gathered to witness the fune
ral ceremonies. This included addresses
by Apostles Brigham Young, John Henry
Smith and John W. Taylor and First
Counselor Joseph F. Smith, who presided.
The service was one of impressive " sim
plicity, the absence of ritual, the earnest
ness of the speakers and the beauty of
the floral offerings and decorations of
white drapery trimmed with pale green
leaves combining to form a scene seldom
witnessed in the historic house of wor
ship. The Tabernacle and Temple choirs,
combining more than 500 voices, rendered
several numbers between the addresses.
At 12:30 p. m. the tabernacle service con
cluded and the procession was formed for
the Oregon Short Line depot, where the
funeral party entrained for Brigham City
which for many years was the home of
the deceased. The procession was headed
by a platoon of police, followed in order
by the first military band, the first pres
idency and the twelve apostles of the
church, the pallbearers, including the
sons of the late president and the seven
presidents of the seventies, the casket,
the mourners (family only), the presiding
Bishops, the presidents of stakes, minor
church officials in order of rank and the
general boards of church societies and
associations, followed by the boards of
directors of the companies In which the
deceased had a controlling interest and
the general public.

end witness a performance af Mason and
Mason's roaring farce comedy. â¢'Rudolph
and Adolph." '. "\u25a0 '
Thi? is ih* first production of the sketch
in this city and it certainly was voted a
eucce^B by the audience- last evening.
â¢Judging from the laughter and applause
that met every comical situation and
funny joke.
Mason and Mason are great exponents
of low comedy. ThÂ«Â»y are both cast for
Uutoh comedians and they are both very
rlever. Their dialect is most humorous,
their makes great and their whole de
portment a clevrr piece of character
There are eome novel specialties
srlvcn throughout the performance. Miss
Lottie Williams Salter made a big hit In
her coster songs, which were greatly ap
plauded; The Sister* Laurence give a
unique dancing and acrobntlc specialty,
â¢which is a new thing in San Krandsco.
The performance throughout Is good.
There were Fume new things at the Or
pheum last night that pleased the usual
nig audienc*. The whole bill was attrac
tive, but Tommy Baker, monologist, and
Monroe, Mack and Lawrence, who ap
peared in a sketch entitled "How to Get
Rid of Your Mother-in-law." pleased the
audience most. Baker sings well and had
clever songs to sing. Wilfred Clark and
company presented a new farce, entitled
"in the. Biograph," and It caused whole
some laughter.
Little Waud fcorenson. assisted by Mas
ter Tom Dunn and Gladys Sorenson, per
formed very cleverly, and the De Courcy
brothers made a great hit with their mar
velous acrobatic worÂ«c. . .
Joe. Myra and Buster Keaton, Mitchell
Â«nd Barnard xnd the Sisters O'Meers are
still on the bill, and the biograph displays
some interesting moving pictures.
There should be a good performance of
"The Liule Minister this week at the
Grand Opera-house, with Herschel May
all, who has been winning much favor of
late, as Oavin Dishart and Miss Hall as
Lady Babbie. IÂ»liss Hall has quite recov
ered from her recent severe illness, and
v.ith her sympathetic intelligence, girlish,
ingenuous spirit and quaint coquetry
should make a captivating Lady Babbie.
Burr Carruth will take the part of Mr.
Ogilvy, Agnes Maynard that of Nannie
Webster and William Greenleaf Lord Rin
toul.
John Stevens* fine old melodrama "Wife
for Wife" goes on at the Central to-mor
row night, and will be elaborately mount
ed and cast to the full strength of the
Central Company.
The Central and the Alcazar theaters
are both closed ior to-night on account of
the death of Mark Thall. To-morrow
night the Alcazar will open with an
amusing farce called "The Girl in the
Barracks," by the author of "The Proper
Caper," that some time ago made a euc
cacs with Alcazar patrons. "The Girl in
the Barracks" recently scored a hit at
the New York Casino, where It ran for
several months, and will probably repeat
its success hers.
The Tivoli will celebrate to-night the
birthday of Verdi with a varied pro
gramme taken from the works of the
famous Italian maestro. Scenes from "II
Trovatore," "Otello," "Aida," "Lombar
di" and "Nabucco" will be given, and al
most all the clever people of the grand
opera casts will be heard. On Tuesday
evening "Ernani" will be put on, with
Barbaresrhi as Elvira, Castellano in the
name roK Ferrari as Carlos. King of
Spain, and Dado as Don Silva â an excel
lent cast. Dado sings in this the beauti
ful "Infelice." and his fine voice will
doubtless be heard at Its best therein. On
Wednesday evening the debut of Miss
Barnetta Mueller, a charming young sing
er, xvho has just returned from study in
France and Italy, will take place. She is
to sing Nedda in "I Pagliacci." Salassa
will sing his famous part of Tonio the
clown, and Ruseo will make his first ap
pearance as Canio this season. "Cacalleria
Rusticana," of course, accompanies the
"I Pagliacci." and besides, Agostinl in
his splendidly successful Turiddu, Mon
tanari will essay Santuzza and Collama
rlni will be seen in the small part of Lola,
â¢whirh ie very good of Collamarlni and
Fhould make the double bill altogether
one of the best of the season. /
There will be concerts every evening
this week and matinees every day ex
cept to-day. Go and hear the band it
you can.
Mme. Barili is the singer of the organ
ization, axid has a light, sweet, pleasing 1
soprano voice. She sang "Robert. To!
Que J'aine" and as an encore "Annie
Laurie."
"Royal Purple," that at once "placed"
the leader with the audience. A splendid
rendering of the 'Tannhauser" overture
came next, in which Creatore tossed his
!>">cks to the tune cf one of the finest
climaxes that has been, heard here. The
v.ood wind could not be distinguished
from strings here. Miss Heintzen fol
lowed with a harp number that had no
particular reason for existence, but
seemed to please, and the band then
played "Traumerei," a somewhat over
sentimental interpretation.
The sextet from "Lucia." with Signorl
Palma. Aila. Marino, Curti. Ldberatore
and Basile as soloists, was magnificently
given: also the "La Gioconda" numbers.
The Chopin "Funeral March" was an
other fine numberâ a little slowâ and some
popular selections as encores aroused, an
unlimited enthusiasm and showed that
"Creatore and his men are amply compe
tent to meet Sousa on his own ground.
It is nicely balanced, has a splendid
wood wind force and some golden brass.
One thing only, the band has yet not quite
got the pitch, of the house, especially in
the lighter .numbers, that need toning
down. They could better fill a place three
times as large.
Last night's programme opened with a
fine, swinging inarch of Creatore's,
Mr. Ellcry's new conductor has dort'T
splendid work with the band. In less
ihan. a year he has brought it to a pitch
of precision, a perfection of ensemble
that even Bousa has not excelled. His
ways are not Sousa's, though it has been
declared that he out-Sousa's Sousa. But
no t^o men could be 'more unlike. Crea
tore conducts with every hair of his head
âand there are a lot of them â with great,
swinging arm strokes, with every inch
of him, and with the most evident ab
sence of gallery play. He is after his ef
fect and doesn't care how he gets it, and
furthermore does get it every time. The
band plays as if it had played together
for years, with, a brilliantly clean attack,
rtne ensemble, color, swing, shading, pre
cision, climax.
I^ast year, a little later In the season
than the present date, a few Â«muslclans
who did not find their jray every night to
Mr. Gra-u's grand opera at the Grand
Opera House, went about town with all
the enthusiasm of discoverers, talking of
one Creatore, a trombone player. Crea
lore. it seems, belonged to an Italian band
That was playing at the California
Theater good music and to poor houses.
Minoliti led the band and Creatore. with
a wonderful old Italian key trombone, was
one of the solo attractions. His magnetic
and muEicianly art created a deep and
highly favorable impression that lost
nc thing from his sincere and pleasing per
sonality and his eix feet of good looks.
Therefore, when It became known that
the band had split into two factions,
Minoliti taking one and the manager.
Changing Ellery, the other, with Creatore
as leader, there was considerable Interest
and curiosity expressed as to the result.
Last night the result was shown, though
echoes of the young leader's extraordinary
success had before reached us from the
East. The Royal Italian Band gave its
first concert last night at the Alhambra
Theater to a house only half full, but
crammed with enthusiasm, and Creatore
is now the vogue so far as the audience
of last night is concerned.
GRAVE RECEIVES
MORMON LEADER
A telegram from Ciudad Porflrio Diaz
says that the United States Consul at
that place was refused admittance to the
jail when he railed to see the prisoner.
The American residents of Mexico are
greatly stirred up over this outrage of
American citizenship, and a petition in
behalf of Mealy signed by 5000 members
of the American colony In Monterey has
been wired to President Roosevelt. In a
letter written in his cell at Ciudad Por
firio Diaz last night and received by one
of his close friends here . to-day Mealy
says: "The Noriasde Bajan mining prop
erties were not taken from me by the
courts, but by in arbitrary decision of the
Minister of Finance. He outrageously re
scinded the decision promulgated In the
official Government organ, and refused to
let the case be tried in court. They took
and held the properties arbitrarily by
right of might."
Another wealthy resident of Monterey
writes: "In all my twenty years in Mex
ico this is the boldest attempt ever made
at a hold-up. A short time ago they ar
rested an American at Lampazos and im
mediately offered to release him for $1500.
In the Mealy case they trumped up. a
charge of contempt of court. The Mexi
can authorities have boldly refused bail
on a charge on which, even if Mealy were
guilty, the penalty would be a fine of
from $10 to $100. Mealy and his friends
say that powerful influences in the of
ficial circles of the Mexican Government
are behind the prosecution that is being
waged against him."
AUSTIN. Tex.. Oct. 13.â The case of W.
H. Mealy, a prominent American mining
man of Northern Mexico, who was ar
rested a few Cays ago and thrown into
prison at Monterey, has assumed an in
ternational phase. He was taken from
Monterey last evening and transferred to
the jail at Ciu-iad Porflrio Diaz, State of
Coahuila, Mexico. At Ciudad Porflrio
Diaz he was placed in a cell reeking with
filth and having a mud floor. This ar
bitrary act occurred twenty-eight hours
after the expiration of the constitutional
limit of imprisonment for contempt of
court, which is the charge against Mealy.
Eall is denied him, and all applications
of his friends for an immediate hearing
are refused.

After burying the treasure there he
sailed as far north as Acapulco and cap
tured two more Spanish vessels, killing
both passengers and crew and transfer
ring- the bo6ty to his own vessel and
sailed again for Cocos Island, where the
treasure was buried. In .one excavation
was buried 300,000 pounds of silver and
silver dollars. In another cave was
deposited 733 bars of gold, each in size
4x3 inches and 2 inches thick. Another
cache contains 273' gold-hilted and be
jeweled swords, precious stones and sev
eral kettles filled with gold. Marks were'
made describing the locations, but as the
pirates fell out and nearly exterminated
the entire party no one has been able to
ascertain the exact location.
1 With 1 , a remnant of . the crew Captain
Benita sailed south. again, capturing an
other'treasure-laden Spanish ship. The
treasure obtained from, it was also buried
on the island. Then it was proposed to
return to the West Indies, get what had
been left there, return to Cocos Island
and have a general division: But the pi
rates were captured by the British man
of-war. Magician, and eighty-one of them
were hanged. The Magician afterward
visited â¢ Cocos Island and recovered a
part of the treasure. Other parties hava
also succeeded in finding part of it, but
the bulk still lies buried. -
Stories of Buried Bullion.
Consul von Johannsen at once placed
himself in communication with Captain
Hackett at Victoria, informing him that
he and his expedition would find a Costa
Rican gunboat awaiting his arrival and
a force of soldiers on the island which
would prevent his landing. It is there
fore likely that the widow's information
will be useless and that a peculiarly
constructed Instrument, which it is said
the expedition was to take along to aid
in the search, will remain idle.
There is an old story to the ef
fect that an immense amount of
treasure is buried on the Island.
In 1820 Captain Don Pedro Benita, com
manding the brig Relampago, after bury
ing some treasure gained by piracy in
the West Indies, sailed to the Pacific
Ocean through the Straits of Magellan.
He left part of his crew in Valparaiso and
sailed northward. He fell in with a Span
ish galleon laden with treasure, captured
the vessel and sailed for Cocos., Island.
As soon as Governor. Gissler read the
dispatch in The Call -he 'at once sent a
letter to "W. E. von Johannsen, Consul
General of Costa Rica, in which he says
that no_company with any such inten
tion would have the right to even land
upon Cocos Island, as Governor Gissler
holds a concession from the Costa RicaÂ©
Government in regard to the treasure,
in which the Government is interested.'
'I happen to be here in San Francisco,"
says Governor Gissler. "on a business
visit, but certainly anything that might
be undertaken by such a company from
Victoria would amount to naught without
my consent."
"Would Find Gunboat Waiting.
August Gissler, Governor of Cocos Isl
and, off the, coast" of Costa Rica, where a
large amount of treasure is said to have
been buried and which has been made the
quest of many expeditions, has taken
steps to. prevent any further attempts to
recover the treasure on thÂ« part of out
siders. A dispatch from Victoria. B. C,
announced yesterday that an expedition
was -being -.fitted out in that city by a
Captain Hackett to search the island^ a
widow in Nova Scotia having furnished
the information s= to the whereabouts of
the treasure.
Mrs. Rodgers .informed the detectives
that Mrs. Ohe bore all the evidences of the
beating upon the occasion of this visit.
The husband denies that he ever assault
ed his wife, but that he is a heartless in
dividual appears from his answer to a
statement of Detective. Gibson.
"Your wife is going to die," said Gibson.
"I had to get rid of her anyhow," an
swered Ohe. Ohe refused to make any
further statement, but people who were
neighbors to the Ohes at Fifteenth street
and-Portrerq avenue, and on Laurel ave
nue, say that he beat -the woman con
tinuously.
The children of the couple are suffering

"According to the investigations of the
police the unfortunate woman was beaten
on the evening of October 6, a week ago
Sunday. The woman was visiting the
house of Mrs. Irene, a neishbor, who re

tered. He dragged her out of the house,
and, according to the police, locked her up
in a room In the Ohe home and beat her.
She finally escaped from this room and
sought the home of a Mrs. Rodgers, who
resides in the fiat above Mrs. Irene, for
safety. .
Ohe denies having assaulted his wife,
but the detectives have secured evidence
against him that indicates that she receiv
ed the brutal beatins at his hands.

ganization is famed the world over and
will arrive from Sydney to-day on the So

up at 1 o'clock there is no doubt that the
big theater will be packed from pit to
dome. As there will be seventeen num

be allowed. Mayor Phelan will deliver a

SAMUELS CONFESSES
TO TWO BT7RGLABIES
The police are more firmly convinced
than ever that William Buckley, Charles
Donnelly, Thomas Moran and Edward J.
Duncan, now in the "tanks," are respon
sible .for the murder of George W. Rice,
the non-union machinist, at Twentieth and
Howard streets Friday, evening. Detec
tives Ryan and Fitzgerald were at work
on the case yesterday and brought sev
eral people to the City Prison -to see if
they could identify the suspects.
Among them was L. . R. Levy, 2736%
Howard street, who gave chase to the
man who fired the shots. .Heonly saw
the back of the man. The four suspects
along with other prisoners, were placed
in line with their backs turned toward
Levy. He picked out Buckley and said
his back, and his clothes resembled those
of the man who did the shooting
Frank Keaveny, a boy living at 1130
York street; J. Wallace, 84S Capp street;
J. Bosshart, 10O9.Capp street; Superintend
ent Harris; Tenth and Howard streets
and a' Mr. Kidd, 721 Shotwell street, who
were on the car. also had a look at" the
prisoners, but were not positive in their
Identification. They will be subpenaed
to give. their testimany at the Coroner's
inquest to-day at 10 o'clock. Mrs. Curzon
3380 Twentieth street, who was at her
window and saw the men running away
Mrs. Remmensberg, 2394 Howard street
who was on the front stoop of her house
and also saw them running away, will be
subpenaed. Two important witnesses are
Mrs." R. Nicholas, 531^ Shotwell street
and her friend. Miss Hammerton. They
were standing in front of Mrs. Nicholas'
residence and saw the men running awav
after the shooting. One of the men was
putting Bomething black into his pocket
as he ran. It might have been a revolver
and it might have been a club. The de
scription fits Duncan.
The conductor and motorman of the; car
will also be subpenaed. The police feel
certain that Buckley's guilt will be estab
lished by the testimony at the inquest

Shortly after the robbery Station Officer
Davids arrested two desperate looking fel
lows who answered the description given
of the thieves by the victim of the hold
up. After being detained for a short time
they established an alibi and were re
leased. â¢ â¢
A well dressed man, giving his name as
William Lee, was knocked down by two
thieves on Grant avenue, near O'Farrell
street, early yesterday morning and
robbed of 560. Lee was about to enter the
lodging-house where he is rooming when
he was suddenly struck from behind, pre
sumably with some blunt instrument. As
he fell the criminals went through his
pockets, taking his money. Police Officer
Davids found him lying. on the sidewalk
a short time after the hold-up and took
him to the central station.
To Lieutenant Martin, Lee said he had
been visiting friends and did not return
to his lodgings until Kfter 1 o'clock in the
morning. He said: "As I walked down
Ellis street on my way to my room I
noticed that two men were following, me,
and, thinking that they were bent on
holding me up, I quickened my pace. Just
as I was about to open the door of the
house in which 1 live the desperate fel
lows attacked me, knockink me down.
After threatening . to send me to the
Morgue if I raised an outcry they pro
ceeded to search me for valuables. I am
satisfied that I could identify the men in
event they are arrested."

ITALIANS CELEBRATE
DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
The Rev. Mr. Kozlowski Immediately re
taliated by forming a church of his own,
which was known as the Polish Catholic
church of the United States. He also
brought suit against Archbishop Feehan
for the eum of 550,000.
The specific charge against the Arch
bishop was that he had allowed a letter 10
be read from the pulnits of the diocese
forbidding all true members of the Roman
Catholic church from associating in the
slightest degree with the plaintiff under
pain of being themselves placed under i.ne
ban of the church.
Father Kozlowski asserted that through
this letter, which was read as directed In
the churches, he was put to great incon
venience and had suffered financial loss.
He did not win his suit.
ThÂ« Right Rev. Anthony Kozlowski,
Bietiop of the Polish Catholic church of
the United States, arrived here yesterday
and is at the Grand. The noted ecclesi
astic Is here on a short visit, presumably
to collect funds for his church and char
itable institutions , In Chicago, but when
interviewed he was very reticent about
the object of his trip.
Bishop Kozlowski has the reputation of
oeingr an agitator and of causing much
trouble among the Polish Roman Catholics
in this country. He was excommunicated
from the Roman Catholic church by Arch
bishop Feehan of Chicago in October, 1895.
The history of the controversy and
eventual excommunication of the priest
dates back to the time when the Rev.
Mr. Kozlowski was pastor of St. Hedwlg's
Polish Church. He had a large following
among the congregation and he seceded
from the Roman Catholic church. The
majority of his flock followed him. The
trouble was over the ownership of church
property. Archbishop Feehan, after re
ceiving the proper authority from. Rome,
excommunicated him.
