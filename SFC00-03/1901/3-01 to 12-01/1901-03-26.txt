Only Short Spur Track Needed.
- A spur track of less than a mile is -all
that Is needed to bring the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe system Into Oakland
over the California and Nevada 1 line, i The
California and Nevada Railroad is little
more than a. right of way, but it is a very
valuable riitht of way into Oakland city.
It is a narrow gauge road and most of
its rolling stock bad passed its days ; of
usefulness, but by building the short spur
track and constructing a substantial road
bed upon the right of way the Santa Fe
system could run Into the heart of Oak
land. It would also give the Santa' Fe
system a valuable - feeder from Walnut
Creek through the San Pablo Canyon.
A. A. Grant, who admittedly holds the
bonds of the road, has been for years the
principal contractor of the Santa Fe road.
He . built much "of ' the old Atlantic . and
Pacific Railroad and was at one time an
officer of that road. He did many miles
of construction work in Southern Califor
nia f Or the Santa Fe system- and has al
ways been one of their confidential men.
It may be .technically said that the Santa.
Fe system 'has not yet got the California
and Nevada Railroad, but . it - can get . it
whenever It. chooses to take .possession
from Mr. Grant, and no other road will be
permitted to take it. .. . < i
The difficulties In the way of the trans
fer of the little road are being/rapidly
cleared away and ' Mr. . Smith's statement*
that this decision' means another railroad
into San Francisco through Oakland is an
important one.
The Circuit Court's Decision.
The .following is a synopsis of the deci
sion: fflWEttÂ»?BKfBB
The plaintiff. Charles H. Smith, a citizen of
Colorado, seeks ' to recover ' from .the Â¦ defend
ants ISO bonds * of â¢ the Â¦ California '; and . Nevada
Railroad Company. It is alleged ' that the' de
fendants are in possession of >' the property;
that C. K. King claims '^the* property iiiT the
administrator ;of /th'e[ estate . of ' J." r W.', 1 Smith.'
deceased, and that the California Sail Deposit
and Trust Company claims to hold the bonds
for King as such administrator. '
The bonds in controversy, are part of a lot
of . 304 bonds pf ; the jj California and . Nevada
Railroad Company, ". each . bond of th* j par
value of $1000. .These bonds were originally
issued by the California and. Nevada Railroad
Company in 1S39, and 229 of them were deliv
ered' by- the company to J. W. Smith, the
father of the plalntifr,' in satisfaction, of a con
tract relating to the buildingr of a; portion of
the road. J. "W.^Smlth also received an order
upon the Central. Trust Company of New York
for, 73 additional. bonds, making a total of 304.
. . It appears ' that . on _â¢ Mairch 15. .1823. J."'W.'
Smith entered Into an . agreement with J. â¢ S..
Emery for. the sale^ to' Emery: of the 304 bonds
for* a stipulated .'price/. Payment was to be
made ' in '.'installments,'-, the bonds Â¦ belne : de
posited ,Â¦ during .the : existence of the contract
with ' Abner Doble of â¢ San . Francisco until Â¦ the
full payment should be made by Emery. ' This
agreement ;' was â¢ not : out : - and another
agreement dated October" 24, ;is93. was substi
tuted, wherein â¢ J.* W. â¢; Smith agreed to sell the
bonds to F./M." Smith upon the terms provided.
The : acreement'waa"- for .an '^option for :*a ' year
with an, extension upon the same' terms for an
additional year." This;contracf was not carried

CHARLES.H. 6MITH, WHO HAS. FINALLY- GAINED',TITLE TO THE C.
AND N.; RAILROAD BONDS HE IS SUPPOSED .TO ''Â¦ HAVE NEGOTI
ATED TO THE SANTA FE COMPANY. . / *
THTS is the important feature be
hind a long decision handed down
by Judge Morrow in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday.
The decision <Ud not carry any hint of this
very important result and the title of the
case was not very prolific in furnishing in
formation as to what was behind it. But
the property sued for, the desires of the
parties to the suit, a few bits of important
fac 4 - brought out during the trial of the
case and the statements of the orlndoals
all combine to show that some railroad is
in a hurry to reach San Francisco through
v akland- â¢ That that railroad Is the Santa
Fe there is but little doubt.
The decision was in a suit begun by
Charles H. Smith of Denver against C. K.
King, administrator of the estate of John
W. Smith aad several other parties to*dA>
clara Charles H. Smith of r>enver the
owner of SOI bonds of the California and
Nevada Railroads Smith claimed that the
bonds nad been delivered to him by his
father both out of hand and by bill of
tale. This claim was contested, not by
any near members of the family,' but by
one nephew with a. counter claim that
partook largely of the nature of a claim
merely to cause delay and force a com
promise. But Charles H. Smith refused to
compromise and brought a suit to enforce
his title to the bonds. He produced a bill
of sale from his father, and it was said
that he had forged the document. He
proved his father's handwriting and then
it was said the document had been writ
ten above an old signature of the father.
But the charge of forgery and the charge
<>t having prepared an Illegal document
were swept away by Judge Morrow, who
taid that while the bill of sale was not
in the usual form prescribed by law there
was enough evidence without that docu
ment to vest the title of the bonds in
Charles H. Smith, and so the forgers
charges Â¦were demolished.
Sued Merely to Clear Title.
This decision vests the title of the bonds
of the California and Nevada Railroad in
Charles H. Smith, and It was brought out
during the trial of the case that, just as
The Call published some months ago.
Charles H. Smith had already disposed of
his bonds and that he was merely bring
ing this suit to clear his title to them in
order that he mlffht transfer them.
It was asked of Mr. Smith during the
trial If he had made a sale of the bonds
end he replied that bt had, but there the
Inquiry ended, owing to the limited scope
of the suit. But yesterday Mr. : Smith told
a little more about the sale of his bonds
and he asserted flatly that the decision
of Judge Morrow cleared the way. for an
other railroad to enter San Francisco by
way of Oakland, an J he added that had
it not been for the opposition that was
ma<3e to ills title the deal would have
come to a head long ago, when the story
of the sale was first published In The Call.
â¢MVwnÂ« Another Bail road.
"This decision means another railroad
Into San Francisco by way of Oakland,"
said Charles H. Smith yesterday after
noon after Judge Morrow had handed
down the document which gave Mr. Smith
title to the bonds on the little railroad
across the bay. "If there had not" been
eo much filibustering on the part of peo
ple who sought to delay the sale of these
bonds the deal would have been well un
der way by this time. I am not at lib
erty to say anythlnc more in detail ex
cept that it means that there will be an
other railroad running through Oakland
and reaching San Francisco directly from
that sidÂ« of the bay.
"It was brought out during the trial
that the bonds had been sold, and I be
lleva that it has been otherwise stated
.that a transfer has been made.' That is
true Jn effect. I have been trying to get
actual possession of the bonds in order
to keep my, portion' of an agreement to
sell.' The 'agreement was entered into
with A. A. Grant, who has been interested
in the road to a slight degree. But when
It came to an actual delivery of the bonds
some persons got it into their heads that
a sale had been made and they sought to
retard the actual delivery. Why it.waÂ»
done people must Judge for. themselves,
for It .has been held repeatedly that they
had no shadow of a claim.
"I have been compelled to fight this at
every turn of the road. First I was con
fronted with an Illegal issue of~gXX),OuO

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, March 25.â From 'news re
ports which have been received. 'b^ere It
is evident that there is a wide discrep
ancy between the official reports of the
political situation ln Havana and those
sent by the small group of correspond
ents' stationed here. Granting for a mo
ment that the action of the convention
Is doubtful, It may be said with accuracy
that the official reports and various pri
vate reports which Indorse .the official,
can only be based upon a. general ground
of belief that the convention will come
to see the error of Its way and to a reali
zation of the hopelessness of struggling
against the inevitable.
. The contrary view, that of the corre
spondents, is based directly upon the
positive statements of the members of
that convention. Of Â¦ those who advocate
tho acceptance of the Platt â¢ amendment
because, they" abhor It, I have found not
one. Such advocacy as I have found has
rested in the general proposltlpn Â¦ that a
disagreeable dose had best be swallowed
and the best' made of a' bad bargain, lest
worse should follow.
Neither disorder nor disturbance Is
anywhera manifest on the island. There
has been and is political unrest in many
sections, some feeling, and - numerous
wholly peaceful public manifestations - of
support of the convention in. its atti
tude. In the event of the acceptance of
the Platt amendment by. the convention,
there may be disturbance, | though not
extensive, in Santiago Province and pos
sibly in Santa Clara Province." i , â¢
- Â¦ Opposition to Convention.
"Within â¢the last two Â¦' weeks ' there has
developed a recognizable sentiment of op
position to the 'convention. It Is not ex
tensive and finds representation - in two
or three papers of no important stand
ing. They make much of the recent dis
patches asserting a marked opposition
to the convention in Santiago 'Province
and ln Clenfuegos. To-day, as v for the
last two weeks, all evidence obtainable
from members of the convention points
to some more or less direct rejection of
the terms of the Platt amendment. There,
is a desire to come to some acceptable
mutual agreement upon the matter or
relations.
Action may be '. taken by â¢ the conven
tion at 'any time. One member declares
that the present intention is to reply to
the amendment ln detail . by clauses, ac
cepting this. and declining that and giv
ing the reasons for special action upon
each. Of any probability * of acceptance
in totoi there is no sign In the body it
self. Evidence of that Is only*. found in
American official assertions. ". .

Japan the Only Power to
Oppose the Treaty With

Special Difpatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. X.
W.. WASHINGTON. March 25.â China
made a filial appeal to the United States
to-day to intervene and support her in de
clining to sign the Manchurian treaty to
morrow as demanded by Russia. This
appeal, personally made to Secretary Hay
by Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister,
was also communicated by Chinese repre
sentatives abroad to the Governments to
which thew are accredited. It was further
supported by urgent messages from
Southern Viceroys asking the powers to
bring pressure to bear upon Russia to in
duce her to withdraw the treaty,
So far as the United States is concerned
the appeals were barren of result. Other
than expressing its objection to the nego
tiation of any secret arrangement by
China, and communicating this objection
to Russia and other powefs, this Govern
ment will not act. In fact, it seems to be
the general opinion that none of the pow
ers, with the exception of Japan. Is dis
posed to do more than to state its posi
tion in opposition to the signing of the
Manchuria convention. Failure on the
part of the powers to interfere will be
followed by instructions from the Emperor
to Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang to
Firn the treaty. If they refuse to carry
out the instruction^, which is extremely
doubtful, nothing will happen.. Russia
â¢will not withdraw from China, as she is
reported to have threatened, but will prob
ably maintain the status quo. Prince
Ching and Li Hung Chang are expected
to Flgn the treaty.
Minister Wu thinks the United States
might prevent the signing of the treatv
and ward off future dangers if the Presi
dent would admonish Russia* that her ac
tion is in violation of the "open-door"
agreement and objectionable to the
I'nited States. The President, however,
has no intention of taking any such ac
tion, having had assurances that there Is
nothing In the treaty prejudicial to the in
terests of the United States.
Japan is the only power expected to pro
test against the signing of the convention,
but whether she will go beyond such ac
tion cannot be learned here. It is thought
probable ln diplomatic circles that a Jap
anese fleet will occupy- Fuchau and Amoy;
the principal ports of the province of
Fukien. , . .

President nitchell Says He Has Received
No Offers of Compromise but: Is Hopeful.
If his Majesty's Government were to agree
to such an amendment, while the United
States would have a treaty right to interfere
Â¦with the canal . in time of war or apprehended
war and while other powers could, , with a
clear conscience, disregard any of the restric
tions Imposed by the convention. Great Britain
alonp. in spite of. her enormous possessions
on the American continent, and In spite of
her Australian colonies and her Interests in
the East, would be absolutely precluded from
resorting to any action or from taking meas
ures to secure her Interests in and near the
canal.
Lord Lansdowne instructs the British
Embassador to explain to the Secretary of
State tho reasons -set forth in this dis
patch why his Majesty's Government
feels. unable to accept the convention in
the shape presented to it by the Amer
ican Ambassador and why it prefers, as
matters stand at present, â¢ to retain un
modified 'the provisions of- the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty. He continues:
His Majesty's Government throughout these,
negotlaions gives evidence - of its earnest
desire to meet the views of the United States,
It would in this connection have beeii
ready to consider In a friendly spirit any
amendments of the Government of the United
States not inconsistent with the principles of
both Governments which the Government of
the United States might propose, and it
would sincerely regret a failure to come to
an amicable understanding in regard to this
important subject.
The amendment, Lord Lansdowne
thinks, not only removes all prospect of
the wider guarantee but places Great
Britain in a position of marked disadvan
tage compared .with other powers. HÂ«
says:
"If that adherence was given the neu
trality, of the canal would be secured by
the whole of the adhering powers; with
out that adherence it would depend only
upon the guarantee of the two. contracting
powers." -
Lord Lansdowne states his objections to
the amendment which strikes out article
III of the convention, under which the
high contracting parties (engage immedi
ately upon the convention being ratilled
to bring it to the notice of other powers
and to Invite their adherence.
The banks of the Suez Canal. are within the

United States but to Central Amenican states,
of whose sovereign rights other powers cannot
claim to dispose. â¢ -' i ' .Â¦"Â¦','"

So far as I know the miners have not,
up to this time, been offered or granted
any concessions. Of course we all hope
to avert the strike and we are putting
forth our most urgent "efforts to that end.
.We came to New York for the purpose
of holding a conference if possible and

Senator. Hanna visited several- places in
the financial district . to-day. When asked
'whether his presence here had any con
- nection with coal-strike rumors- the Sen
ator replied emphatically that It had none.

- "I have nothing to.do with this affair
and I do not know anything about It save
-what I have heard and read the last few

ing this matter at all."
." .The Herald to-morrow will say that the

roads that are largely Interested in that

â¢that there will be no strike ordered on

There seemed to be equal positiveness in
the assertion that as an organization the

nized'by, the operators.

SAN JOSE, March ffi.â A meeting of
the board of directors of the California
Cured Fruit Association .was held to-day
at which President Bond, who has Just
returned from Europe, submitted a report
covering" his observations concerning the
prune market in - the East â¢ and abroad.
While no official statement has yet been
made public it is understood that he ad
vised a cut in prices on prunes for export.
* A modification was made- in prices on
such prunes. The official announcement
will not be made public before to-morrow
or Wednesday, but it is understood that
prunes for. export are cut another quarter
of a cent a. pound, and possibly some re
strictions holding the export- trade in the
hands of California packers are removed.

Â¦Lord Lansdowne shows that under arti
cle ,-1 of the Clay ton-Bulwer | treaty the
two parties agreed that neither would oc
cupy or fortify or I colonize or assume or
exercise any dominion : over any part of
Central America, nor attain any of . the
foregoing objects by alliance with any
state or people of Central "America. There
is no similar agreement in the convention.
If, .therefore, .the treaty-'were- wholly .ab
rogated both powers would, except In the
vicinity of the canal, recover entire free
dom of action in Central America. This
change, he thinks, would certainly be of
advantage to the United States and might
be of substantial importance.
The other two amendments, in the opin
ion Â»of~ Lord Lansdowne, present Â¦* more
formidable difficulties. The first of themâ
the so-called Davis amendment, which re
serves to the United States the right of
taking any measures which it may find
necessary to secure by its own forces-the
defense of the canalâ appears to his Ma
jesty's Government to involve a distinct
departure from- the, principle which' has
until :Â¦Â¦ now found acceptance with both
governments, namely, that in time of war
as well as In time of peace the passage of
the canal is to remain unimpeded and is
to be maintained by the power or powers
responsible for Its control.- ' '
'.With this amendment added tcv the con-'
vention the United States would be :it is
presumed, within ' its 'rights if at any

Mr. Rowan came to Los Angeles 'in 1S61

Since that time he has retired to private

to again become the party's standard
bearer he has persistently refused.
As a mark of respect Mayor Snyder to

LOS ANGELES, March 26.â In the suit
of I. H. Polk asralnst the State of Califor
nia Judge York to-day sustained the
State's demurrer. On April 22, 1898. Polk
was employed by the State Railroad Com
missioners as an expert to examine the
books of railroad and transportation com
panies with a view/ to the fixing of rates
of transportation. He completed his work
on December 31. 1S98, and the Board of
Examiners fixed his compensation at
$7709 50, but did not order the amount paid.
The total appropriation available that
year for all expenses connected with the
work of the Railroad Commissioners was
only $1500.* -> Nothing was paid Polk and he
brought suit to recover . tha . amount
awarded him by the Board of Examiners.

OF THE LOWER COURT
Col will how take the offlce as soon as
the remittltur from the court is received
and hip bond arranged. The county will
be the loser to the extent of J1000. as both
contestants wi:i have received pay for the
earae office.
This decision will affect the office of City
Justice, which is now being filled by O. D.
Richardson, who was seated over Charles
W. â¢ Cobb in a similar contest by Judge
Rhodes.
Col had been appointed by the Super
visors to fill a vacancy in the Auditor's
offlce caused by the resignation of C. A.
Barker. At the last general election the
Supervisors failed to include the Audit
or's offlce in the. election proclamation.
The Repnblicans. following an opinion by
District Attorney Campbell, made no
nomination for the office of Auditor. Mar
tin Murphy was nominated by the Demo
crats and elected. Judge Rhodes ordered
Murphy's name placed on the ballots, and
later when the Supervisors refused to
count the vote3 can for Murphy the court
was appealed to. Rhodes decided that the
appointment of Col to fill the vacancy
held only until the first Sta.te election,
and not until the expiration of the teim.
which was in 1902. Under this ruling Mur
phy was given the offlce about a month
ago. ousting Col. Subsequently Murphy
collected X&26 bqck pay. a similar amount
having been paid to Col also. An appeal
to the Supreme Court was then taken.

herself.
The young woman was married while
yet in her teens to a man named Smith.
Her married life was of short duration,
and she returned to her home and re-
Bumed her maiden name. "â¢ Then she met
Matthew Zwinge and they became-.en
gaged. Zwlnge seemed to have lightly re
garded his obligations to the girl, and she
soon returned his ring. They effected , a
reconciliation, but apparently the young
lover regarded the girl as a plaything, to
be cast off at will, Â¦ and , he kept . her in
constant uncertainty. ; Several times she
attempted to take 'her life, but her ef
forts were thwarted. :
On" Saturday evening the young woman
returned from Stockton, believing that
Zwlnge was about to keep his promise to
marry her. They met, failed to reach an
understanding, parted and met again in a
restaurant on Bunday" morning. She ap
pealed to him to marry her. but * he put
her off with the assurance that "perhaps
he would/in tho future."-. , -
When Miss Oentany left him she wrote
a touching farewell to her family. She
told of material that had been purchased
for a wedding dress and -could now be
used as a shroud. Said she: .-. ,\: : :
To the last he will not marry m?. Hb knows
the condition I am in.; They have disgraced
me by saylns: I am crazy, but I am not; only
lie has fooled me. Â¦ _â¢ * :
Pinning this to her. dress, she all but
drained the phial of poison. She fell to
the sidewalk and died in a short time. !
The Coroner's inquest was held to-day.
The girl's uncle said she had: intimated
that her despondent acts were caused by
Zwinge's treatment of Â«her. He declared
that without a doubt Zwinge's persistent
refusal to marry the girl he had wronged
caused her to take her, life.

SEATTLE, March 25. â The newspaper
situation to-day in is more inter
esting than, at any! other time since the
announcement in 1S90 that D. E. Durie,
Judge Thomas Burke and several other
prominent old-line Democrats were to
commence the publication of a morning
daily to be called the Telegraph. At that
time Leigh S. J. Hunt, the most remark
able, man who has ever lived in* Seattle,
owned the. Post-Intelligencer,. which sub
sequently passed out of his control. The
struggle between the Post-Intelligencer
and the Telegraph, resulting finally in the
absorption of. the Telegraph by the older
paper,, is a matter of history. From that
time to the present the' Post-Intelligencer
has been In possession , of the morning
field in Seattle' without opposition.
To-day articles of incorporation of the
Washlngtonlan Publishing Company were
filed with the County Auditor, by Clark
Nettleton and F. H. ' Brownell. The
trustees are the same as the lncorporat
ors, with the addition "of C. W. Adams.
-As a matter of .fact, while Leigh Hunt
"refuses to'disciuss' his. plans -at thepres
ent time, every. one knows. that Nettleton
is his most intimate friend. For. years
Nettleton was Hunt's private Secretary.
In New York some time ago Hunt made
that statement '.that he_int6nded' to start
,a new_morning paper in Seattle, and it is
certain 'that; he has ; now. perfected his

"If that is the only objection," said To

Stafford thought that the opening of

of disgust on the part of the people

"It seems to me that it is a mistake to
pustain the vÂ«Â»to. The IngleMde track has
papse>i into the hands of one corporation,
which is capitalized at 51.000,000. In arder
to make money on Its investment it will
be compelled to have an almost continu
ous sr-ason of racing in other counties. It
is Idle to talk about legislative interfer
ence when we consider the present as
cendency of the Republican party and the
control exerted therein by Dan Burns. On
that account we should act for ourselves-,
and therefore 1 think the veto should be
defeated.** Â¦ Â¦

Suicide Ends the Tragedy.
John Mulherron immediately set out In
pursuit of Crawford, who was making hi3
way across the country toward the Strat
ton ranch, three miles away. When Craw
ford arrived > at the Stratton ranch he
found the farmer and his wife at supper.
Without warning he drew his revolver and
fired three shots at Stratton. Two lodged
in the left breast and' one In the heart.
Stratton died instantly. The remaining
two shots Craw r ford fired at Mrs. Stratton.
Neither took effect and he knocked her
down and dragged her into the yard by
her hair. â¢ ; â¢
This morning he took the 10 o'clock
train from Compton to this city. While
here he purchased a 38-caliber revolver
and one hundred cartridges.. He returned
to Compton on. the 5 o'clock train this
evening and went to the Mulherron ranch,
where he met John Mulherron. , ,
Crawford Â¦â¢' asked for John's brother,
Ralph, and was 'told he was In the bunk

and a moment later five shots rang out
and he "was seen to emerge and start to

into the bunkhouse and found his brother

Insanity is the reason assigned V or

it soon -became evi'Jent that he was in

CARNIVAL OF
BLOODSHEED
The authorities are many that where the ap
pointment of a receiver Is superseded It may
become his duty to restore that which has coma
to his hands to the parties from whom It has
been withdrawn and that this may be directed
to be done. It Is at all events evident that
an order that he should do so Is not void In
itself. We cannot on this application review
the Judgment of the Court of Appeals sus
taining euch an order and approving pf thÂ«
writs as Issued.
The court below had refused to *raat an
appeal and as appellate the Judge of the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals had the power to *ward
It and to grant a supersedeas, and. if. in his
Judgment a writ of supersedes* was required.
unÂ«er the particular circumstances the order
for it to Issue was not In itself void, nor was
the process void. Issued under such order.
Obedience to an order granting a sopersedeas
Is as much required as to an order for & writ
of supersedeas and to the writ .thereupon is
sued. The essential point is that the order of
decree below is superseded and the parties ar
fected must govern themselves accordingly.
Respecting: the claim that so much of
the order of the Circuit Judge a3 directed
the receiver to restore the property taken
by him was void, the court said:
As to the claim that the writ of super
sedeas of the Circuit Court of Appeals to
the -Alaska Court was void for want oC
authority to issue it, the Chief Justice

application of Alexander McKenzie for

In California under the proceedings of thÂ»
Circuit Court of Appeals for contempt in
connection with his conduct as receiver
of certain mines in Alaska, The decisiou
ot the court was based on the ground tha:

Winnie O'Connor rode the last three
winners on the card.
JF a Kansas "twister" had passed
through the betting ring at Tanforan
yesterday It could not have caused
any more desolation and grief among
the booking fraternity than did the
victories of the four favorites. Imperious.
Kenilworth, Topmast and Specific. Not
only this, but Muresca and Hainault, the
first two past the wire in the two-year
old scramble, and Gauntlet, winner of the
closing event, were backed by the talent
for all they were worth. Eighteen firms
laid odds, and it is. estimated their Joint
losses figured more than $30,000. While
the track was a trifle slow from the light
downfall of rain the fields from liberal
scratching were sxnoJl, thus obviating all
danger of the best horse being beaten.
Heavily speculated on at scant odds in
the gambling -on the six and a half fur
long run, Harry Stover's Kenllworth gave
Rolling Boer three pounds and a belting.
As in his previous races Kenilworth
framed up a merry clip for the other
starters and with the goal in sight seemed
to be stopping. Still he stood for hard
urging from Nash Turner, beating- out
Boer a neck. For a time Beau Ormonde
gave hot pursuit for the brown colt, but
grew groggy, finishing third.
DomTnlck on the 0 to 5 favorite Imperi
ous clearly outfinishod R. Murphy astride
Bogus Bill for the opening seven 'furlong
purse. The moist going was quite to the
liking of Imperious, . and after he had
passed Silver Garter In the stretch it
looked all over. Opposite the paddock
though Bogus Bill collared and passed the
leader, but .when Dominlclt *ave Imperi
ous a couple of whacks with the whip the
latter again forged ahead, winning by a
head. Silver Garter, at CO to 1, ran third.
Catastrophe seemed. Tunable, to 'false a
gallop. â¢ ,
Tommy Magee. the; ex-jockey, cut a
good thing loose far the two-year-old
dash In Muresca, a brown filly by Imp.
Prestonpans-Mura. A 5 to 1 chance, with
Mounce in the saddle, she won, eased up
the last sixteenth, covering the four fur
longs In 49 seconds. Halnault. a 15 to 1.
shot backed to 8. took the place from
Divina. Mil&s was favorite.
The veteran Topmast, which seems to
sharpen and thrive on hard campaigning,
appears to be as good right now as ever
In his career. Installed a. pronounced fa
vorite for the mile ajid a furlong selling
event he i*an over Opponent and MacGyle
through the stretch, scoring under re
straint. Opponent. outlasted MacGyle. se
curing the place. El Mldo passed the
stand under double wraps and then died
away to nothing.
If Specific had not been fifteen minutes
the best Winnie O'Connor" would have
tossed the race away. Ellison's horse,
when owners had done with the scratch
ing blank, closed a 1 to 2 choice over St.
Rica, Hungarian and Mamie Hildreth.
Winnie managed to get cut off at the first
turn, clun^ with bulldog tenacity to the
rail and after being compelled to take up
half a dozen times finally beat St. Rica
a head. Hungarian finished behind Mamie
Hildreth.
Andy Blakeley's . Walkenshaw. with
Heivy in the saddle, enjoyed first call in
the oetting on the last event of the day,
a mile selling number. Out in front until
well on -toward the wire the favorite was
then passed and downed with ease by
Gauntlet, piloted by O'Connor. The win
ner's odds -were backed down from 4 to
14 to 5. Spike, a 15 to 1 shot, ran third.

H. I., on March 18 at 7:20 a. m., the four
masted bark Olympic was passed. She
left here on February 12 with a general
cargo and when the Sonoma arrived last
week without any news of her the owners
and charterers began to get anxious.
Captain Finch of the Gaelic reports that

mast was gone, the jibboom had been car
ried away, the main topgallant mast was
gone and the mizzen topsail yard was ap

that Mrs. Barneson was to be a passenger
they had her stateroom decorated In a

lilies, lilacs and other flowers. When Mrs.
Bsxneson entered her room she thought
she had made a mistake and was about
to retire, but Captain Harrv Struve as
sured her it was her apartment and that
the decorations were a surprise pot up
by the officers on the ship. Mrs. Barne
eon will remain over at Honolulu for the

San Francisco has been wanting a. <JÂ«

to have their heart's desire. The Cham*
ber of Commerce has talked about the ne

L Howard will be the general agent !Â»â¢
San Francisco, but the Manila agent has
not yet been decided upon. The Mon
mouthshire is scheduled to sail from San
Francisco on Anril 10 and the Carmarth

more food â¢ Is required to protect the body
against the vicissitudes , of ; the "climate.
Digestion has been prodded to Its utmost.
As Â¦ spring* approaches ' the " system re-
quires less, and , soon becomes clogged by
excess of nutrition. This loads the blood
with unnecessary nutritive material. Very
quickly". the digestive . organs themselves
become deranged. Except by the strictest
diet this cannot \ be avoided. .- '
A catarrhar condition of the whole t.-

restores digestion /by bringing the mucous

gestive organs into ; aj normal condition.
This immediately clears the blood of all

DANGERS OF^THE* .CENTURY.
YESTERDAY the Supreme Court of the United
States denied the application of Receiver Alex
ander McKenzie for a writ of habeas corpus to
release him from imprisonment in the Alameda jail
upon the judgment of contempt rendered against him
by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals on ac
count of his disobedience to the process of that court..
The Supreme Court also at the same time denied Mc-
Kcnrie's application for a writ of certiorari to re
view the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in
the contempt proceeding. This action would seem
to insure the enforcement of the judgment which Mc-
Kenzie so richly deserves and will be* a wholesome
example to those who may hereafter feel inclined to
trifle with the Federal courts. But the good work
should not stop with McKenzie. The testimony taken
in these contempt proceedngs shows clearly that cer
tain attorneys aided and abetted in the commission. of
this contempt. One of them, in endeavoring to save
McKenzie, boldly testified that the receiver acted un-.
der his advice. As attorneys are popularly supposed
tr be officers of the courts in which they practice and
expresslj' bound to uphold the dignity and honor of
those tribunals, it will not be clear to the ordinary
laymanhow the client can commit a contempt by the
advice of an attorney while the latter is exempt from
the same dereliction. To the contrary, it would seem
to the average understanding that the attorney was
the more culpable. 2\othing has occurred for years
in the United States affecting the administration of
the law which has excited such widespread interest and
consternation as this Nome exposure. There should
be nothing left undone to make the vindication of the
courts Complete. Nor the Judge who caused
this burning scandal be permitted to longer wear the
ermine which he has so defiled? The President of the
United States should act promptly to relieve ths
bench from such a disgrace. It is true that the friends
and defenders of Noyes and McKenzie have been
found in high places, geing even so near the President
as his Cabinet and the Senate, but thus far thcti
vaunted influence and' power have been unavailing.
Only lately Senator Hansbrough of North Dakota
was heard from his scat in the United States Senate
in defense of his "friend" Judge Noyes. As it is well
known that this Senator is the creation of McKenzie
through the peculiar political methods in which he is
an expert, it was only natural that -Hansbrough
should come to the front when McKenzie pulled the
string.

hies of France â Their 'Trade and Govern
ment.", will be published next Tuesday.
Paris,' France.
There-is.alreadya question of military
utilization of Western Africa. But it goes
without saying that the tax-burdened
Frenchmenâ approximately 100 francs ($20)
a head, merely for state taxes â cannot be
expected to provide all ' the expenses of
such an enterprise. The colonies will have
to provide partly for this themselves. This
leads, us to examining the development of
industry in the French colonies in another
paper. " Â¦'Â¦'â¢''',, Â¦
The garrison of Algeria never has been
distinguished from the army of the re
public, whpse nineteenth corps It forms.
The rule has been established that the re
cruits from Algeria shall perform their
military service . hereafter In the capital
of France. Every year 6000 of these young
men are thus. brought to Paris. Besides,
the military organization of the Arab
population, which is now completely sub
jected,' is more and more available every
year, and in case of war, Algeria and
Tunis would, put into the field at least
120,000 soldiers for France.
Soldiers From Algeria.
The colonial army will be composed of
3299 artillerymen in the colonies and about
the same number in France, 28.166 soldiers
of colonial -infantry and 24,968 native
sharpshooters, half of whom are to be
drawn from Indo-Chlna, the other half
from. Africa. All these troops have a pro
portionate number of officers, ensigns and
special corps. Of the 18,166 soldiers of co
lonial infantry 16,373 will be in garrison in
France and. will form, with that part of
the colonial artillery also sojourning in
Europe, an army corps capable of partici
pating in the defense of the metropolis.
â¢It is probable that instead of endeavor-
Ing to increase the number of permanent
troops stationed in the colonies, reserves
will be organized there that can be mobil
ized at first call. In Reunion, Guadaloupe
and Martinique this is already being done,
and in each of these islands-6000 men could
be called together in case of war. s
In more extended possessions the same
system will be applied. on a much! larger
scale, and already the desire is clear to
look no longer upon the colonies merely
from the viewpoint of military defense,
but rather to find in them elements of
strength for France. Such elements have
been revealed already in Algeria. In 1870
71 the Algerian troops played an import
ant part in the war with Germany.
Organizing a Colonial Army.
war with the. Boers show. what the trou
bles'would be if even the greatest naval
power were to attempt an attack upon the
colonies of a nation prepared* to disturb
her military transports. ' There has been
adopted in France a naval programme
carrying $140,000,000 for vessels and naval
stations from 1901 to 1907, without count
ing the $60,000,009 which we devote regular
ly each year to the navy. .
Moreover, an effort is in progress to
adopt a positive military method for the
defense of the colonies. The creation of
a special colonial' army has just been
voted. .

. TRANSFERâ A. C. R., Oakland. Cal.
The California street line of cars receives
a transfer from a passenger who comes
from the Union street line at Hyde street
and then gives a transfer to California
street line and one to the shore line to the
Cliff. By this system the California" street
line does not retain any of the half fare
It Is entitled to from the Union street line.
If. however, the passienger does not ask
for a transfer to the California street line,
then the company gets the benefit of the
half fare on transfer.

United States gold dollar weighs 25.8 troy
grains, and a troy pound contains 5760
grains. But a pound of gold, according to
avoirdupois, would weigh 7000 troy ounces
therefore $1,000,000 in gold welshs 36S6 4'
pounds avoirdupois. A United States sil
ver dollar weighs 412.5 grains troy, and
$1,000,000 in silver dollars weighs 66 931
pounds avoirdupois, or nearly 2SU tons.
Knowing the weight of one dollar of each
currency, it is only a matter of calcula
tion to determine what a given number of
dollars will. weigh. * .

without- considering * the ? possibility .of a :

conquered ifinally; a ;vasf empire ; without

Â¦ The cÂ«lonial forces need a further word
of explanation. They do not serve merely
for, the purpose of " maintaining order
among the natives. . They are augmented
because of the fear of a* possible Invasion,
from without. France's colonial-- troops
constitute much less an army of dominion
than one of defense. It would, in truth, bo
a serious mistake to believe that the con
quest . of Â¦ the ' French ' colonial empire Â¦ has
given -rise Â¦ everywhere to struggles with
the natives. The history of ; the warfare
in Algeria must not crea-te -a wrong ' im
pression In. that . respect. It was only
through a number of mistakes in Mussul
man politics, which even an extraordinary
display ofmilltary. heroism could not cor

tended over more than . twenty Â¦ years and
has â¢ often - put :â¢ In * movement . more than
100.COO soldiers all at once. , . . ' ;
To Defend the Colonies.
Under such conditions "it seems that the
uppermost care of -France would be the
defense and domination of her colonial
empire. One's first care: generally is to
keep what one has acquired. France has
amply provided in that direction. In fact,
139,77a French soldiers are maintained in
tho colonies, or 22 per cent of the total
army, at a total annual cost of $38,000,000.
The colonial army is particularly burden
some,' requiring twice the list of officers
actively employed normally, for the peri
odical sojourn of those officers in Europe
for the eake of health, including both voy
ages, takes up as much time as their stay
in the colonies. â¢ . . " Â¦ Â¦ '- - ' â¢ .
â¢ The size of the army and of the budget
shows : with what weight the . colonies
press upon France, and also to what de
gree the â¢: country has become enamored
of a colonial policy that lays such burdens
UDon It. Some even go. so far as to' say
that it compromises ' her security in Eu
rope, and It. is; certain that tho distribu
tion of such an important share of the
French military forces In 'various parts
of the globe would render her weaker in
the presence of a Continental storm.
Cost of Colonial Armies.
Such an expansion could not fail to have
an important influence ' upon the people
concerned in it. In the opinion of all the
younger generation the real adversary of
France. : is no longer . the nation which
took two provinces from her thirty years
ago, but .rather the one she' has met for
twenty years on every road that leads her
toward colonial : empire. â¢ Certainly no
Frenchman yet renounces the hope of re
gaining Alsace-Lorraine, but at the bo:
tom of.their hearts Frenchmen expect It
no longer from 'Â¦ a war against Germany,
which was considered . only a few year3
ago a ; necessity to oe â¢ accepted almost
gladly: -now they hope for Â¦ it mainly
through the advent of a sort of European
millennium. To-day the French must ex;
pect eventful clouds of war rather, from
the northwest than from the east.
Extending Colonial Possessions.
France reached out into Asia and tooK
an active part In the apportionment of
Africa. She took possession of the east
ern half of Indo-China and secured Mada
gascar, which she conquered a little later.
Algeria/enlarged by Tunis, began to ex
tend 'across the desert toward the south,
while Senegal, the small colonies of the
coast of Guinea and .: the French Congi>,
became real territories and stretchea
toward the center of tne' continent, so that
they all at last met on the banks of Lake
Tchad. - This joining ol all: the African
possessions of France into a single empire
became a concrete reality on the day when
three columns, one from Algeria, a sec
ond from Senegal and a third from Congo,
united south of Lake Tchad and crushed
and killed Rabah, the last , great slave
holding chief, who had. continued to luy
waste the interior of '.he African conti
nent. . ,
Suddenly toward 18S0 France came out
or her torpor: 'About that time all Eu
rope, indeed, arrived at a historic turning
point. Italy and Germany had becomo
something more -than mere .geographical
terms. The nations were united into great,
solid masses that offered no longer the

had .become so much more terrible than

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
BrepaMd by Experts and Specialists for
The" San â¢ Francisco Gall.
The whole world has an interest in the struggle thai
is going on in Russia "between the people and the Gov
ernment. Bad as the Government may be it is prob
ably the only means, of saving Europe from an out
burst of Pan-Slavism that would fill the Continent
with a war in comparison with which the French Rev
olution would be a little thing. The Russian Govern
ment desires conquest in Asia, but the Pan-Slavs de
mand the union of all the Slavonic countries in Eu
Â¦ * . " ... ... ' -
rope. They desire to absorb not only, the Slavs of the
Balkan states, but'all the Polesjof the Austrian'and the
German empires. Consequently the Russian menace
which the Czar's Government now holds over China
would, in the case of the success of a popular revolt
among the people, impend over. Europe. How long
the military government at St. Petersburg can hold
down the growing power of the people it is impossible
to predict, but it is safe, to say that in the end Europe
will have to. reckon with the spirit of Pan-Slavism,
and the reckoning may be called for much sooner than
is generally thought probable. , - v; .;<.-
In the meantime it will be noted that the outbreak
of open revolt implies that the policy of conspiracy
and assassination which the nihilist leaders have so
long maintained in Russia is no longer regarded by
the excited populace as. sufficient to bring about, the
reforms they desi~e. Such conspiracies _ may go on
and assassinations may be attempted and even ef
fected, but the surging discontent of the people is not
going to rely any longer wholly upon those methods.
The spirit of revolt can no longer be held in subjec
tion by the Government nor restrained by the
leaders of the conspiracies. There is to be open
fighting. - ..
The troubles between the universities and the,Gov
ernment are "of long 'standing. It will be remembered
that last year the students at the University of Moscow
came very near precipitating a riot in that city by rea
son of the refusal of the Government to grant certain
concessions the students demanded. .The outbreak
was promptly suppressed at the time, but the discon
tent continued. V\Ve are now informed that at the
meeting of the council at St. Petersburg on Sunday
it was decided not to repeal one of the laws to which
the students most strenuously object, but to refrain
from enforcing it at present. It .would appear,'there
fore, that the Government has learned something of
wisdom and the students have gained a virtual vic
tory. A law f hat is riot, enforced "will' soon become
obsolete and in time may be quietly repealed. In th.it
way the university men will have gained redress to
that extent at any rate and the' Government will have
"saved its face." .
Two features of the report stand but with sufficient
clearness" to afford reason. for believing them to be ac
curately reported. The first is the announcement that
the disturbances were caused partly: by workingnieri:
and partly, by students, and the;second is that the
situation was sufficiently grave on Sunday to cause
the Czar to hurriedly summon a council of Ministers.
Those facts lead to the conclusion that something
more thanj a riot has occurred.' A cause which will
bring together two classes of persons so distinct "from
one another as are the university students and the
laborers in a- country like Russia is "evidently bnc
which has affected with' discontent nearly, the whole
mass of the population.;
tZIJ OR the first tinie in^many years the discontented
I elements of Russia have broken out : into open
t . ; fighting.. -To \viiat extent the rising has gone it
is, impossible "at this 'time ,to tell. : Reports of Russian
affairs are>hardly revere reliable- for 'the I censorship is
not only strict,':but is powerful enough; to so.enfo r ce
its orders that the' full truth concerning any particular
event of^'a disturbing nature leaks out only by slow
degrees.^ The reports- that have been sent abroad of
the affray in St. Petersburg on Sunday night maybe
exaggerations, but it is just as likely they are under
statements. Consequently' the i outer .world does not
know whether, the Russian' Government at this time
is confronting a mere outbreak of riot in the capital
or. the first ; symptom of a widespread ; insurrection.

We would be glad to know of any, more
statesmanlike and â¢ feasible method of taking care oi
the public range and deriving a revenue for irriga
tion.
When Colorado and New Mexico are included in
the. calculations the sum is slightly less to each State
and Territory.
This would leave a balance of $1,842,459 59 to pay
the cost of administering the leasehold system. '
Idaho .....;......,.... 1,271,628 19
Total .â¢â¢â¢.... $8,157,540 41
Putting the total revenue fronrthe leasing of the
public ranges at $10,000,000 a year, divided equally
among the foregoing arid States, the amount would be
to each $1,428,571. By giving, to each a percentage of
the latter sum equal to the percentage of public land
to. its whole area the allotment would be: v
California . $S28.571 18
Arizona .......1,085,713 96 '
Montana 1,114,285 38
â¢ Utah ...:..:...... 1,271,628 19
Nevada .............:....,..... U57.142 45
Wyoming Â»:.'.;... 1,228,571 06
Wyoming 86 per cent
Idaho â¢ 83 per cent .
An examination of the above shows that the public
domain remaining in Federal ownership riscsVwith
aridity and falls with moisture. The States and Ter
ritories most needful of irrigation, therefore, have the
greatest amount of public domain to rent for provision
of the means of* irrigation. California, needing the
least, would get it.
An idea of the proportion lin which "such a fund
would be earned in and allotted'to the States and
Territories may be obtained from the amount of pub
lic domain remaining in each. Of their total area the
following percentage is public land: . â¢
California 58 per cent '
Arizona-- 76 per cent â¢-
Montana 78 per cent
Utah J.... . 83 per cent
Nevada .* .. ,.... 95 per cent
What would an individual business man do under
such circumstances? He would solve both problems
at once. He would make the stock grazier pay rent
for the public property he pastures and would devote
the proceeds to irrigation works.
The arid ranges; under leasehold control, would
yjeld nearly $10,000,000 a year.
Leaving out of the question the erratic nature of
such appropriations, their wasteful expenditure, and
forgetting such experiences as the venerable proposi-;
tion to make a harbor in Oakland, a Western man
may well put himself in the place of the Eastern farmer
and taxpayer. That' distant but good fellow citizen
of ours has had no help from the Government. . He
has planted and reaped and gathered into barns, while
the Government has been indifferent to his rainfall o r
the fertility of his fields. Outside the public land
States that taxpayer had to put up a high price for
his land, and acquired it by no such cheap and easy,
method as 'the pre-emption or homestead law. He
feels taxation and the burden wears upon him. He
gets tired and rests one leg while he stands on the
other. Senator Carter desires to tax him to aid farm
ers in the West who under the homestead law can get
land for nothing, provided ther Government will water
it for them, at the expense "of the unaided Eastern
farmer, for whom the Government does nothing.; Is
it any wonder that heads are shaken and discontent is
voiced in those Eastern farmhouses? s~
Again, the Eastern farmer is a citizen of the repub
lic and part-owner of the public domain." He used
to keep sheep on his farm, under fence, and found
them profitable farm stock. That part of his busi
ness is broken up. On his property, the public do-r
main, out West, sheep are grazed without paying him
anything for what they eat. To raise them costs noth
ing in comparison with the expense of raising them'
on his inclosed farm. He cannot compete. He has
parted with cne valuable means of diversifying his in
dustry and turning an easier penny, and he sees his
rival getting rich rapidly on pasture that does not
cost a mill. So these two Western visions disquiet
him. The property of which he is part-owner is, used
'without rental, and its use is destroying its sole value,
and he is called on to pay taxes to water another
man's land. Honor bright, is such a situation just
to our hard-handed fellow citizen, and is it creditable
to American statesmanship?
It is well for the. whole country to examine the
policy for which Senator' Carter spoke thirteen hours
without stopping. It is proposed to ask Federal ap
propriations to build irrigation works in the arid re
gion, in order that soil now barren for lack of mois
ture may be made fertile.
on the brakes.
He wanted money in the bill for irrigation works in
the arid country of the West. He wanted a larger and
not a less sum total appropriated by the bill.-and in
default of that talked the measure to sleep. The inci-.
e'ent is illustrative and suggestive, and we are glad
that the press of the country has found its true rea
son. In the first place it illustrates the log-rolling
method by which the river and harbor bill is built up
and voted through. Objects of expenditure that have
no merit at all are included in it to secure votes. It is
the purpose of those who were behind Senator Carter,
to force to the front another object of very large ex
penditure,' and beat the. bill- until that object receives
an appropriation.
The taxpayers would be glad to see the objects of
expenditure decrease rather than increase, and will by
their representatives soon open a more active cam
paign for the limitation of taxation. We are not am
bitious to hold the ribbon permanently as the costliest
Government on earth, though we do not insist that the
cheapest is necessarily the best. But a billion dollars
is a lot of small change, and the expenditure of that
sum per year is already in sight unless Congress puts
THE Eastern press, .and notably' the New York
Independent", has at last discovered Senator Car
ter. Eastern papers started to >ail an unknown
sea in quest of an economist, and supposed they had
found one when they landed on the Montana, Sena-"
tor's thirteen hour speech against the river and harbor
bill.
Just so Columbus started to sail for India and
thought he had found that land when he bunted
against an island in the Caribbean Sea. The economi
cal heart of the East is bowed down by the discovery
that Senator Carter's motive was not economy, but
quite otherwise. /.: .Â¦Â¦

DR. PATTERSON LECTURES .
ON TEMPERANCE ;CATJSE
Presbyterian Pastor Says Mrs. Na T

, Enemies of Alcohol.
A number^of workers in the cause of
temperance assembled in the lecture-room
of the Young Men's Christian Association
building last night and listened* to a bril
liant lecture on "The Drunkard's Broth
er" by the Rev. C.J. Patterson, pastor pf
the Holly. Park Presbyterian Church. The
speaker showed a J familiarity with . the
methods of workers in the cause of tem
perance, and his address was replete with
figures and statistics tending to prove the
best manner to overcome; the evil.
Dr. -Patterson said he believed the out
break of Mrs. Nation. in Kansas set back
the efforts of the enemies of intemperance
indefinitely.: Continuing the speaker said:
"MInistersof ihe Gospel may differ con
siderably in their methods of overcoming
the evil. - What we want is a leader, one
such as John b: Gough: I believe that
God will raisa.up just such a one. De
spite our efforts I believe that so long as
rye. barley or ; the grape Is raised there
will be memwho will abuse Its, use. 1 Unite

CHINESE SLAVE GIRL

Yue Gum Nim, a Chinese slave girl of
fifteen summers, sat in the witness . chair
yesterday in United States | Commissioner
Heacock's. chambers and gave an example
of the facility with which the Mongolian
can fabricate' testimony. She was taken
on January 14 last from a brothel in Chi
natown to the Methodist. Episcopal Mis
sion on Washington street on a charge of
being illegally in the country. While in
the. mission she was interviewed by Chi
nese Inspector Gardner, Mrs. ' Lake.' three
Christian Chinese girls and others, and to
them I she made statements" that she was
born in China and had been living in this
country about ten- years.
Ex-.Tudge | D. J. Murphy Â¦ and a' i burly
Chinaman: represented the little slave, or
rather her. owners. After the witnesses
had made their statements she was placed
upon the stand and : flatly contradicted
them. She swore that she was born In
Chicago fifteen years'ago and went back
to China five years ago, returning with
her mother to this country last May. She
did not know where her mother was at
present, but had heard that she had gone
East. She was taken out of the brothel,
she said, against her wish or consent and
by force, and she did not want to remain
in the '.mission..'-'. She had been -visited in
the mission, she said; by Jndge Murphy
and the burly , Chinaman, who acted â¢ as
interpreter for Judge -Murphy on those
occasions. . . .1

TVO LAKGE DEALS IN
DOWNTOWN REAL ESTATE
The newcomers this week are awaj' up
toward the top of the list, and -with the
excellent holdovers fill an enjoyable pro
pramme. Marie Wainwright, assisted by
Edward Eisner and C. Harry Robertson,
appears in the comedietta entitled, "Lady
l>ye"Â« Escapade." by Justin Huntley Mc-
Carthy. It is a snappy piece with some
serious play in it, and takes well. Scott
end Wilson flppear in a clever sketch en
titled "The Farmer and the Athlete," and
the farmer is a thoroughbred. As ex
ponents of quaint humor C&llahan and
r.Iack stand at the head of the class. The
rkctch is enlivened by the clever play
lc* on the Irish pipes and the exquisite
bit of character acting of the old man.
Burt Shcpard, the tnonologlst. is fat.
fair and Jolly, and readily established
himself as a favorite. The holdoversâ
Techow'B cat?, the Bunth and Rudd Com
pany, Smith and Campbell and Papinta.â
hold their own in popular favor, and the
hiograph with the funeral of Queen Vic-
"Too Much Johnson," the Alcazar bill
of the week, kept a large audience in an
almost hysterical condition of merriment
throughout the three clever acts last
night. The piece is well staged, goes
smoothly and left the masculine half of
the audience dovoutiy hoping for the dis
tinguished ingenuity of its plausible hero
The next time they happen to be. "up
against it." Augrusfjs. otherwise Billings,
alias Johnson, etc.. the prince of accom
plished prevaricators, was well taken by
Joseph Kilgour. more especially In the
later scenes. Fraak Bacon gave' one of
l.is admirable old ia-;n. a really distinct
ive end quietly realistic character sketch.
Howard Scott, always reliable, was a
very amusing Jeaiaus French husband,
â¢wuh a serviceable .-iccent and a genulnc
<;sll!e wealth of gesrure. The redoubtable
Johnson himself was played for rather
more than it is worth by George P. Web-
Fter: Edwin T. Emery is a good male in
genue, punctuating his mock heroics as
Henry Mackintosh with the dishpan. and
Harry Bradley. Charles A. Smiley, Her
bert Carton and Howard Hickman all did
pood service. The feminine honors go to
MIsh Margaret Marshall for her cleverly
offensive sketch of the comic weekly
mother-in-law. Miss Lila Convcre Is a
tweet thing as Mrs. Augustus Billings
and Agnes nankin has a pretty part,
prettily played, as the ingenue. Leonora
Faddish.
Alcazar.
fsyi-^HAT charming play, "The Little
I Mlnistrr." is too well known to
1 1 need any detailed description. In
LL speaking, then, of the production
at the Columbia Theater last night
the critic has but the simple duty to per
form of paying whether, in. his opinion,
the-rrrprntatlon is worth thÂ«Â» $150 which
Mr. Frohman demands as the price of
witnessing his"""two hours' traffic."
Under the circumstances I think I must
snÂ«=wer this question in the affirmative
nnd for three reasons: First, it is not
probable Miss. Adams will ever play the
part again, fo it's now or never for Call
tornlans; second, the company, though
had in some places and indifferent in
others, is irood in still others, and there
fore avej-ages fairly well: third, the play
itself, though an early work, is still the
work of the greatest humorist that has
erisen in England since Dickens, and
Â¦would therefore be worth feeing, even if
it were rendered more poorly than it is.
Prominent among the "good" in the cast
comes Mr. Hards, who plays the part of
the Little Minister. He has an excellent
elocution, an appearance that fits the part
and a quiet strength of manner which
never falls away into tameness or weak
ness. The part offers innumerable oppor
tunities for overacting along farcical
lines. Mr. Hards, like his predecessor in
the part. Mr. Edson. has been too well
trained ever to forget that he is playing
a comedy and not a farce. Excellent, too,
are the Nannie Webster of Miss Hender
pon â played better by her than by the
original in New Yorkâ the Chief Elder of
Mr. Valentine and tbe Rob Dow of Mr.
Henery.
The part r-.f L&dy Babbie was written
for Miss Adams, and r.o one who has seen
her in it can f !nd any one else satisfac
tory- Miss Palmer, therefore, starts with
n heavy handicap, which, it is to be re
grretted. she apparently makes no serious
effort to overcome. Lady Babbie Is a lady
masquerading: as a sypsy, and that is the
way Miss Adams plays the part. Miss
Palmar plays it like a gypsy masquerad
irir as a lady. Her voice Is quite incapable
of variation and melody, nor does she
Fcem to understand the expressing of
those delicate shades of emotion that give
The part Its charm. It cannot be said that
Mies Palmer's rendition is a failure, but
it is far. very far, from what it might
end should be.
In a Scotch play surely all the common
people should speak with a decided Scotch
accent. But Mr. Frohmaa evidently thinks
that German and cockney are common in
Thrums; some of his Scotchmen must
have been boro by Elbe or Thames bank
and have never been able to forget the
tong"ue-twists of their childhood.

When Lennon recalled Witness McGln
nis to the stand a scene occurred between
the attorneys. Lennon nought to test Me-
Ginnls' ability to Identify his own hand
writing and asked him to look at a signa
ture on a sheet of paper. Byington asked
to bff allowed to inspect the document, but
Lennon sprung his ever ready objection.
Judge Melvin ruled against Lennon and
Byington secured possession of: the paper.
While looking at it, Lennon j shouted at
Byington:
"You are looking at the part of the pa
per that is folded ovjer. Be a gentleman
for once if you can." w Â¦
Opposing Counsel Clash.
When District Attorney Byington said
to Lennon. "You have argued this matter
before," Lennon came back with a're
mark that "the attorney is not telling the
truth." Byington countered by saying, "I
don't care to enter into a discussion with
you," and Judge Melvin threw oil on trou
bled waters by telling counsel to "pro
ceed wlih the proper conduct of the case."
Lennon fired a long string of legal and
technical objections to the admission of
the alleged forged warrant as evidence
and when he desired to make an argu
ment on the matter the prosecution tem
porarily withdrew the offered document;
John H. Ryan, clerk to the Board of
Supervisors, was examined at length as
to the modus operand! of handling salary
warrants. He testified that McGlade had
received from him the alleged forged war
rant after it had passed through the office
of the Supervisors. . .
T. B. McGihnis. clerk to the Board ot
Supervisors, testified that the signature
of his name on the alleged forged war
rant was not written by him, nor' did he
authorize any one to sign his name to the
document* . . â¢ .. . - â¢
McOinnis Tells of Forgery.
A. J. Donovan, deputy superintendent of
streets in 1S97-98, identified the books and
records of the office, despite Lennon's ob
jection to having the books introduced In
the case. The witness tnen examined the
books and stated that no person of the
name of John Sullivan -appeared on the
pay roll or time books In 1897 or 1898. It
is ajleged that McGlade forged salary
warrants in the name of "John Sullivan.

ment, working as a cleaner and repairer
of city sewers. â¢ . - ' â¢
When cross-examined by Attorney Len
non. the witness Showed by the books that'
"J. Sullivan" .had worked for the depart
ment in 1897-98 as a hodcarrier in the de
partment of streets. Sullivan, the hod
carrier, had- worked for $3 per day, while
the alleged forged warrants 'in the name
of "John Sullivan" called for pay at the
rate of $4 per day. .
. Martin Fleming, deputy In the Regis
trar's office in 1898. identified the registra
tion papers of McGlade and the signature
of the defendant. The papers were intro
duced as anÂ« exemplar of McGlade's writ
ing.
Thomas F. Clark, deputy In the street
department in 189?, testified that he never
had a man named "John Sullivan" work
ing under him in sewer work.
John Sullivan Is a Myth.
As far as the testimony was concerned
It was the same* as was given at the pre
vious trials of McGlade. The principal
witnesses plainly showed that they .did not
intend to give any evidence derogatory to
McGlade. Ex-Superintendent of Streets
\V. F. Ambrose was the first witness of
the day.' He identified the warrant of ap
pointment of McGlade, but would not
swear to his own signature on the docu
ment. He evaded the question by answer
ing "it might be mine" or "it might be
so." â¢ â¢ . Â¦
Harry Piper, chief deputy' to the County
Clerk in 1S97-98. also suffered a lapse of
memory when asked to identify his signa
ture on McGlade's oath of office. Attorney
Lennon strongly objected to the witness
stating whether the document was an of
ficial record, claiming that Piper was not
authorized to . administer an oath. The
objections were overruled.
County Clerk. TV. A. Deane, who was a
deputy in the County Clerk's office in
1S97-98. testified that the oath of office wae
an official document and that it had been
duly recorded. Deane recognized the sig
nature of Harry Piper on the document,
being perfectly familiar with Piper's writ
ing. -. - . ...-.â¢-
Detective Tom Gibson testified to having
secured the oath of office of McGlade
from the flies of the County Clerk's office,
giving a receipt for the same. Lennon rig
idly cross-examined Gibson as to his
knowledge of what constituted an official
file, but did not rattlo the witness.
Memory of Witnesses Is Bad.
Judge Melvin many times was compelled
to rebuke the attorneys for the language
which passed between them, Attorney
liennon being the aggressor In chief.
When Lennon asked Byington : "to be : a
gentleman for <5nce/if you can". Judge
Melvin took a hand in the affair and re
minded counsel that there must be no
more such unseemly passages.
Almost every question asked- by the
prosecution was objected 'to by Attorney
L.ennon, and in the majority of cases
Judge Melvln overruled him.
The features at the trial ot Peter J. Me-
Glade, ex-clerk in the. office of Superin
tendent of Streets, charged with forging

tinued objections of Attorney Lennon to

IN McGLADE CASE
Mrs. Ogden said last night: , .
"I would have no cause to suspect the>
Chinaman but for the tact that he was
the only one who knew of the location of
the tin box. He. left me last Thursday,
three days before the robbery, and to
commit the crime he must have got into
the house after we had retired. I always
hang the keys to my room in the kitchen,
and I found them there after the robbery
was discovered. Some time ago I was
robbed by a Chinese boy. and the one
whom I now suspect asked me before
leaving If I had ever caught him. I told
him .10, 6O I suppose he thought himself
safe in Imitating him."
Â¦ The ir.ctter has been reported to the po
lice and detectives have been detailed on
the case. The tin box contained also a
certificate of deposit for a large amount,
payment on which, however, has been
stopped. ' Â¦
-Shortly after 7 a.' m. a man named
Brown, who keeps a small store near by,
found the tin box on the sidewalk In front
of the house, broken open and rifled of
everything but the papers. He immedi
ately reused Mrs. Ogden . and informed
her of her loss.- She searched her room
and found that, in addition to the three
purses stolen the thief had rifled a drawer
In her writing desk and taken a diamond
sunburst valued at $1000, lorgnettes valued
at ?150 and a pearl chain valued at $100. In
the drawer which was rifled was a valu
able chatelaine, a purse containing $60
and numerous other pieces of jewelry
which were not taken. â¢ .
Dolly Cgderi, ' keeper of a house at 228
Mason street, has been robbed of consid
erable coin and a quantity, of jewelry and
Is somewhat at a loss to name any one
who would be guilty of the 'crime. Her
suspicions, however, are cast on a Chi
nese * servant, who left her employ ; last
Thursday. He secured leave to remain
away from his work on the plea that he
was not feeling: well. Mrs. Osden in
formed-him at the time he complained of
feeling . sick that he could lay off until
such time as he felt able to return to
work, but it Is now doubtful whether she
will seek for him again other than
through police channels.
According -to Mrs. Ogden, the robbery
occurred between the hours of 4:30 and 7
a. " m. yesterday under the moat peculiar
circumstances. Mrs. Ogden retired at 4:30,
but before doing so made certain' that a
tin box containing three purses and sev
eral "papers of value to herself was in its
usual piece in the closet where she buns
her'clothes. x She did not occupy her own
room that night, sleeping with another
woman in the house after assuring her
self that her valuables were safe. ,

NEW TORK. March 25.â The clcninr of to-,
day's Â£tock market was in contrast with the
â¢jpenic^r. The first prices of stocks showed the
effect of the large buying demand which had
lieca attracted from outside speculators over
l-unday by the fat-enable bank statement and
1 he resulting upward spurt of prices In the
fc'atunlay market, but the results of to-day's
cr^rationB Indicate pretty clearly that un

Ufiy Quieted by the Saturday bank Ktate
rrtent. Professional operatora fed the outside
tferr.and very freely during- the first hour. Â»o
trmt there were no Important advances after
the oiwnlng. except where some special influ

Ifrfn worked off this profit-taking began to get

lation during the rest of the day was to make
an imposing chow of sharp advances In the
Â«iookÂ« r.f minor railroad companies concerning
*hirl) plausible reports of consolidation with
larger systems could be devised and of which
tlie capital ifi-up or the flouting supply of stock
is sufnÂ«-i'*ntly narrow to make possible effec
tlie Rianitmlatlon by speculators of large re
ncurcrs. There were to many, of thcee gains
and thpy werp eo impressive In extent as to

and they made a general attack on the market

declines In the Grangers. Pacifies 'and South

the apparent difficulties ahead . of the foreign

lstect move on the coast is difficult to "esti
mate inths prevailing dull and narrow mar
ket ou the fpot. Thtre is virtually no demand
for I-croun and 3-cror.n loose raisins, and the
trade In seeded raisins is entirely of a hand

â¢ LONDON. March 23.â On the resumption
to-day of the hearing of the libel actions
brought against the Star and tho Morning
Leader by Arthur Chamberlain and his
son. Neville Chamberlain. In connection
with charges tearing on War Office con
tracts counsel for the defendants, contin
uing his address, declared Arthur Cham
berlain had only decided to sue as an
afterthought on consultation with Joseph
Chamberlain, when the latter found he
had no ground for action. Counsel found
justification for the articles in the man
ner in which orders were secured for thÂ©
Arklow Works and the fact that the Kt
nochs secured Government orders when
their tenders were higher than others.
Counsel considered that it was a thou
sand times to be regretted. In the Interests
of honor, purity and public life, that Jo
seph Chamberlain's Parliamentary state
ment to the effect that he had no Interest,
direct of Indirect. In the contracting com
panies was not corrected. Joseph Cham
berlain should have been notified that his
Interest in the Birmingham trust involved
an interest in other companies.
Sir Edward Clarke, rising to reply In be
half of the plaintiffs, contended that tha
articles were purely and simply attacks
on Joseph Austin Chamberlain through
Arthur Chamberlain.

Government Has All It Can Attend
to in Preventing an Onslaught
on the City.
; KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 25.â The
British mail steamship Para, from Colon,
brings reports of renewed activity on the
part of the rebels in the vicinity of Pan
ama.- The hands of the Government arÂ©
full In their effort to keep the rebels out
of the city. Excessive war taxes are be
ing levied and last week a party of busi
ness men protested against these high
rates. They were thereupon arrested and
charged with being rebel sympathizers.
Two of the prisoners managed to leave
the country by steamer, but the others
were kept in prison until they had paid
the. heavy fines imposed against them.
Passengers by the steamship Para say
that the revolution shows no signs of end
ing in the near future. Business Is car
ried on in Colon and Panama with the
greatest difficulty and the enormous price
of foodstuffs is causing general suffering.
The Liberals are expecting large rein

The first mine explosion to occur In thÂ«
New Klondike region of Fayette County
happened to-day. One man was killed in
stantly, five will die and ten are burned
and crushed so terribly tha.t It Is doubt
ful if they will recover. The body of tho
dead 'man is missing, the injured men
have been brought to the Cottage State
Hospital, and as a result of the explosion
the mine Is on fire.
The cause of the explosion was an ac
cumulation of gas in the heading of tha
Gates mine, one of the new mines opened
up this winter by the American Steel and
Wire Company. The dead man Is an Ital
ian, whose name is unknown. The most
seriously injured men are Robert Nelson,

of OHphant, James Murphy of 5ew Salem,
Michael Soloka, Alexander Bullayontls,
George Yonkers and Michael Goble of
Adelaide. . *
The Gates plant Is located Just across
the Monongahela River from Masontown.
When the explosion occurred at 9 o'clock
this forenoon a group of sixteen miners
had gathered In a cross entry about 600
feet from the bottom of the shaft and
fifty feet from the face, awaited the dis
charge of a blast. The charge of powder
was put into the blast as usual and
touched off by Michael Goble. the blaster.
In the meantime a pocket of gas had
accumulated at the face and gradually
drifted out toward the heading. The
same instant the fuse was touched off
there was a blinding flash which suddenly
filled the entry In which the miners had
taken refuge. There were two explosions.
The first was so terrific that it left the
men dazed and stiffened; then there was
another rush of air. bringing with It a
second puff of gas and then another ex
plosion, i

They Carry Off Belie of Franco-Prus-
Eian War Weighing- Four
Hundred Founds.
Thouph there is always a fire in the
cooking range at the Ocean Beach Pa
vilion, hence tt Js always hot enough for
all culinary purposes, Proprietor Kruegex
ordered It chained to the floor yesterday
morning. This was to keep It from being
stolen. From an occurrence at the resort
Sunday afternoon his course Is a wise one.
Among the relics once prized by Pro
prietor Krueger was a bronte cannon,
weighing 400 pounds, which had seen ser
vice and -whose brazen sides had run red
with blood in the Franco-Prussian war.
ThtÂ« cannon pointed out over the road,
and for years has rested at peace on its
trunnions out by the ocean.
Sunday afternoon some relic hunter or
prosaic junk dealer drove an express
wagon up near the cannon. They had
their coats off just to show that there
was no deception about the game and
that they had no derricks concealed in'
their sleeves. No one paid any attention
to them, and finally the express wagon
drove off. After it had been gone about
an hour Herr Krueger noticed that his
cannon had accompanied the wagon and
its occupants.
He was frantic for some time, but the
reaction finally brought calmness, and he
reported the theft to the police. While the
junkshops are being searched by some de
tectives others are vlsitinj? the pawn
shops. In the meantime Herr Krueger
wishes the public notified, and he requests
that he be immediately informed in event

otherwise.

the challenge that greeted Lee when he
reached the corridor. .Then there was- a
mixup and Lee went under. Bailiff Troell
rushed to the corridor and ordered a
cessation of hostilities.
"Show you' star or keep out of dl3
trouble," ordered one' of Lee's assailants.
Then an elderly, gentleman of color, who
early in the morning picked his way. Into
court :\Uth.. a cane, occasionally stopping
to adjult his heavy black goggles, made
a rush mtthe bailiff. . He came to court
practically blind, but trouble gave sight
to his eyes. He was engaged In- swinging
rights at the rapidly swaying head of the
bailiff when Clerk 'Watson, In obedience
to Judge Hunt's command, came as a re

enemies, -who after. Watson's arrival on
the scene of -battle went home In a rush.
The case will be called again .this morn-

Valid Policy Insurance Law Proves
Unpopular in the Silver ;
State.
CARSON, Nev., March 25. â Governor
Sadler is in receipt of a number of peti
tions requesting him to call a special ses
sion of the Legislature to repeal the
Hardesty insurance bill, known as the
valid policy law. The Governor Is in fa
vor of an extra session* providing the
members return with a promise. to right
the matter. Said he:
"I am in favor of some action that
would repeal this law or the passing of a
law that will give the people protection
against fire. As the law now stands, tho
insurance companies will not do business,
and it leaves the people In a bad plight.
The calling of a special session is a seri
ous question. How could I know that by
calling such session the asked-for relief
would be given? If a session were called
and no action taken In this matter the
people would have more cause for com
plaint than at present. Should the-legis
lative members that passed the valid pol
icy bill over my veto give absolute assur
ance that they would pass a bill repealing
the law I could give the . question serious
consideration. Without such positive in
formation there will be no extra session."

BLYTHE ESTATE
ACQUIRES LAND
Mrs. Sawyer Sells to It a
Small Frontage on
Geary Street.
Key Let Needed to Make an Almost
Complete Line and Finally
Close Brook
Street.
By a deed of record filed yesterday A.
A. Moore Sr., father-in-law cf Mrs". Flor
ence Blythe-IIincklcy-Moore, has secured
possession of a email piece of land on
Geary street which will give to what is
popularly known as the Blythe estate a
frontape en Geary street that will only
end at the building located on the south
east corner.
The consideration named In the deed Is
$50,000. By it Jeanne Lydie Sawyer, also
known a> Jeanne de Saint Marie, conveys
to A. A. Moore Sr. the lot of land thirty
feet cast of Brook street, with a frontage
of 20 feet 6 inches, a depth of 77 feet 6
inches and a 3-foot L,. for $50,000. Prac
tically this settles the controversy over
Brook ftrect and insures a frontage on
Geary street extending from the building
now in course of erection by the Mutual
Savings Bank up to the building com
monly known as the Blythe blocjt.
Contrary to the general understanding,
the land on which the so-called Blythe
building etands is not owned by the in
heritors and beneficiaries of the Blythe
estate. It Is owned by a man named Buch
and may be a valuable piece of property
if .any one wants to buy a large section
tor business building purposes. .
While A. A. Moore Sr. is the ostensible
purchaser of the Sawyer property, it is
generally understood in business circles
that he is merely acting for his daughter
in-law. A transfer of the property In or
der to Ftralehten out the title is looked
for any day. The figure at which the land
was purchased was approximately $2500 a
front foot, a value far in excess of that
usually obtained on that block of Geary
Ftreet. The lot was the key to the parti
tion of the property, and will probably re

& short time.
Minister of Justice Issues Reprimand
and Strong Disciplinary Measures
May Be Adopted to Stem
rH " " the Movement.
YOKOHAMA. March 6.â Japan is in a
whirl of excitement and perplexity over
the complications which have suddenly
and simultaneously arisen in her foreign
and domestic affairs. The attitude of Rus
sia in regard to Manchuria is announced
at the moment of a grave Cabinet crisis
over a question of taxation, while the
machinery of government is threatened
by one of the most extraordinary strikes
upon record, the Judges or the courts
throughout the empire threatening to
adopt that means to obtain an Increase in
their salaries.
The threatened strike among the Judges
has this to justify it, that the service,
based. upon the ancient economic system,
is wretchedly underpaid, and the" in
creased cost of living during the last ten
years has rendered it at last well nigh
Impossible to obtain competent men for
the Japanese bench. The course of the
recalcitrants is. however, stigmatized as
undignified, and as to its demoralizing ef
fect upon the empire there can be no
question. The Minister of Justice has is
sued a reprimand, and strong disciplinary
measures are Hinted at to stem the move
ment, but It has already resulted in se
rious delays and a perceptible blocking of
the machinery of government.
As a general result of these numerous
complications the business conditions
here have by no means Improved. Many
of the smaller banks are reported as on
the verge of bankruptcy, while the steady
depletion of the reserve of the Nippon
Ginko (tbe Bank of Japan) is viewed with
alarm.

SEATTLE, March 25.â For several
weeks an agent of the underwriters has
been engaged in what appeared to be a
successful attempt to . float the bark Pol
talloch, which was stranded on North
Spit, ' near the entrance to South Bend
Bay, early last winter. . An immense
mushroom anchor was planted In the Wil
lapa channel and connected with a huge
donkey engine on board. Two other large
anchors were planted seaward to hold the
vessel from going further up in the sands.
The first pull taken on the vessel moved
her sixty feet, and almost every day since
she has moved a little nearer to the chan
nel. It was necessary to drag her through
thousand for more than half a mile, but
off Thursday word, came that the pre
ceding day- she had made 800 "feet and was
almost in the channel and would be towed
up to South Bend on Friday. . : . . Â¦

gale from the southwest," and as. she was
laboring heavily the captain ordered the
pea ward lines slackened to : ease her up
against the beach In shallower water. For
some reason the line was given' too much
slack, and Friday morning found . her
again high and dry on the beach ' and
months of labor and- thousands of dollars
gone for naughty, : .... /Â¦-. . - .
j The wrecking crew. deserted In a body
on Friday and came to this place to-night
on the mail steamer, .bringing Â¦< the news
of the disaster . and , claiming that they
were literally starved on board the ves
sel. As to-night's tide will be a very
high one the vessel will probably go
higher than she has ever been' before. It
is . not yet known â¢ whether another at
tempt will be made. to float her.

the pilot, abused and threatened him while
toe doctor, with a shiny silk, plug hat on.
w.as hanging on* to the ship's ladder. The
physician was not allowed to come up the

snowplows and a rotary are stuck in a
cut half a mile west of Ogalalla, which Is
full of- drift snow. The snowstorm- has
somewhat abated, but the wind continues
to blow. The railroad people expect to

> Forty-five machinists employed at the
Honolulu .: Iron" Works - went, on a" strike
Saturday. The refusal of the. men caused
work In ; the machine department ; to close
down temporarily. The principal cause
of the strike was , the refusal of the pro
prietors of -the > iron works to recognize
Hawaiian â¢ Lodge Noi '241,. International
Association Of Machinists. .The members
of the new' union' required that only its
members be employed.v Eight hours was
also- demanded .as a' regular day's work.
Wages do -not appear to enter,: into, the
demand of the ' strikers. Â¦-. The proprietors
of . the iron works ' say ' that they will not
agree to hire only members of the union.
No agreement 1 could be reached, however,
so the strike. Is still in force. â¢' .-'â¢Â«*
"What is regarded as the most Important
measure which' will come before the Leg
islature was presented in the Senate Fri
day.March 15, when D. Kanuho of; the
native party presented the' dispensary bill
providing 1 for Government control of the
liquor .- traffic. 'The -bill differs somewhat
frorii the South Carolina measure. ..It is
not of such length and eliminates the con
stably or, spy system.. Officers are given
police authority and they alone are ex
pected to carry out the 'provisions of the
act. . Â» The â¢ other details as laid Â¦ down by
the - Soujth 1 Carolina; law are observed so
far as they relate to .the TJcu'ernment own
ing and ; controlling::, saloons, inspecting
I liquors, selling. in .bottles and not percnit
1 ting drinking , on the . premises 'wBere the
liquor is sold. - The; department is to-be
controlled by, a commission composed of
three 'men"-' and: an executive officer who
is to be appointed by the Legislature.; The
right is' given* to every election' precinct
to decide whether it will have dispensaries
established or not. The principal idea of
the bill is to reduce the price of liquor as
much as possible. . ' , . ..
A bill will be presented, to the House
this week : to prohibit persons afflicted
with leprosy or tuberculosis from being
admitted to the Territory. . Reports from
the Board of Health show that the latter
disease has increased in these islands at
an alarmlris.' rate -and .some stringent
measures, to restrict it must be 'taken: â¢'-,
I Recent -experiments'- with ' the wireless
telegraphy- seem to indicate that. a portion
of the systenrin these islands is working
satisfactorily.' Communication â¢ Is claimed
to be established ; between ' the Islands of
Oahu,' Molokai and ' Maul . . and both . press
and commercial messages have been sent
through to the: various stations. .

Severely Arraigns Scott
THE signing of the Tyrreir bill bt
the Governor yesterday twill result
in a. bitter confllct'in the'' courts
over the civil .lervico; provision of
the charter which : governs this
municipality. -The bill prohibits the- re
moval of any 'city official who has taken
the oath of office and in effect- nullifies tha
civil service law and . prevents the ap
pointment of any more employes . from
the eligible list in place of men already In
positions. The battle over the constitu
tionality, of the bill will be waced wllh
Tax Collector Scott on the one sidft ana
the Civil Service Commission, fortified Dy
Mayor Phelan," on the ether. -s â¢â¢
Tax Collector Scott notitied the Board ot
Civil Service Commissioners yesterday
that, acting under the advice of; his at-*
torney. he would refuse to â¢ accept the
fourteen deputies certified by the com
mission. ' Late Saturday - night Scott sent
a messenger with his ultimatum and an
elaborate opinion written 'by his political
adviser. Abe Ruef.* to the rooms of the
Civil Service Commission. - It i being Ion?
after business hours, the ' messenger; wno
had received his orders, shoved the com
munications under - the Â¦ door, where they
were found yesterday morning by - Secre
tary Moran. The ooinion advised Scott
not to remove his present deputies, being
based mainly on the prospective signing
by the Governor of the Tyrrell bill. ;
The attention of Mayor Phelan was di
rected by the Civil Service Board to
Scott's attitude, raid his Honor immediate
ly submitted the question to his attorneys
to determine whether ho has the power of.
suspending Scott- for violating the. charter
and of finally removing him â¢ from -office,
with the aid of fourteen Supervisors. Scott
laughs at this threat and will take refuse
behind the provisions of the Tyrrell bill;
which was signed* yesterday. "Even --with
that factor out of the way Scott savs- It
will be a difficult matter. to get fourteen
Supervisors to support the Mayor, suould
he attempt impeachment proceedings:
Mayor Phelan Is Angry.
Mayor Phelan is -WTOth at what he
terms the questionable ~ tactics , employed
by Scott in evading tha plain provisions o,f
the charter regarding the merit system.
The Mayor has issued the , following
statement: . Â¦ .
I regret that the Governor did not see fit
to veto the Tyrrell bill, (j It is an attempt on
the "part of the Legislature to give a false in
terpretation to the Â¦ constitution,* but . the Su
preme Court will put Its own interpretation
upon .the constitution. The constitution â¢ for-,
bids any test for office except ~. the' oath ' to
support the constitution of the nation : and
State, . and the Legislature by this btll : seeks
to. prevent a municipality, through Its : char
ter, from requiring the test of fitness . to be
determined by examinations, : practical, . public
and free. Nothing could be more absurd.
The bill also attempts to confer on | courts
the | power - to enjoin the Mayor from "any ac
tion, Â¦ as; conferred upon him by I the charter,
to remove officials. who are appointed by, him,
or to suspend elected : of flclals to , be tried ; by
the Board of Supervisors.: If the cause alleged
ba the violation of the civil service provisions
of trie charter. Â¦ " -" ' . Â¦ " ' Â¦'.â¢'Â¦Â¦ ' -Â¦ '
The civil service provisions " of . the charter
are as much a part - of it as the - provisions
requiring all fees, for Instance^ to be paid Into
the treasury. If an officer pockets the T fees,
lie should be removed... If he fills his office
with "heelers" and' "ward strikers," without
retfpect to the charter, which says only com-"
petent persons,: who have passed the'examina
tion, can be appointed, . he should be suspended
or removed. 'Â¦' -..-'Â¦ -
Our attorneys advise, " however,' that â¢ in view
of the fact that tho Supreme . Court - is now
considering ; two - civil i service ; cases . which in
volve the competency of the , charter ,to | estab
lish the civil - service system. ; the . speedltht
way of determining- the validity of, the Tyrrell
bill which the Governor signed I to-day > would
\m to sue . out a. : writ of mandate Â¦ in the Su
preme Â¦ Court," compelling the Tax Collector .'to
appoint the deputies certified to him/, and for
Â¦frhlch ' he made requisition. â¢ This > course - will
probably be [ pursued, and"; the Supreme I Court
will then" be' in a position 'to decide the. whole
question Â¦ In , a short time. ,..â¢â¢Â¦ ;-.: ;Â¦_;<
'The- trouble ; between the .Union , Iron
Works -"and its ; shlplitters is tending
toward a compromise, â¢ for " hours and
wages . are not concerned in the state
ment' of -. grievances.'! It Is ' a"; question of
apprenticeship and skilled hands, and if
a proper conference can be arranged.it
is .believed the strike can be declared off
in short order. There is a fear, however,
that if the strike be not settled within
a short time other trades, kindred to the
shipfitters, such as the riveters, .heaters,
drivers â¢ and others will be. affected, ! and
that" the situation become serious.
The Â¦union -of * shipfitters does not belong
to the local federation .of trades, so that
in any event it is not likely to affect the
general labor situation, but it will serious
ly :â¢ interfere * with â¢ the - Government con
tracts If it be not" settled without ; much
delay." -;'Â¦'Â¦ . :Â¦â¢;'Â¦Â¦ â - - ' - : â¢

There is trouble among the machinists

places : of these who have walked out of
his ';' shops. : â¢ They . want shorter hours
there as well as in- the United Staes.and
in default of them, have struck. There Is

; The "question ". of ,f strike';', or' no - strike
among ; the machinists; will be settled -be
fore} May; .20,\ at "which time a nine-hour
day ] will . be inaugurated in all the' shops
belonging to the National Metal Trades
Association." Â£ It is still ; a debatable mat
ter, : howeyeri* as ; to - whether, or , not those

members of -the association,; for there are
none ; of ; those^ west of .Denver. V -
.According ; to R.. : I./ Wisler, ; secretary of
the local; branch of the 'International As
sociation of Machinists, I the* course of the
local machinists has not yet been decided
upon. The nine-hour day- to ;'be inaugu
rated on May 'M is the' result of an agree
ment J entered â¢; ihtoV by \ the Metal Trades
Association, an organization of employers,
and; the -Machinists'- International; Union.
The- agreement was - made May. 18, -1009,
and- Its . terms provided for a* day of niivj

months ; after '.the date of Ae agreement,
andanine-hourday to be Inaugurated

the nine-houriday start on a' Monday the
date has Â¦ been Â¦ put : forward from the 13th
to the 20th, and . on ; that date all shops In

ment ' will inaugurate ; the ' nine-hour day.
â¢The question what' to do about the out

an important one. | It is; believed to be a

tion now under consideration by the local
machinists. '.There., is no 'Increase | of pay
asked except { the increase which .will fol
low .the reduction- of 'the ihours ; of , work
without ' a ; corresponding : reduction â¢ lu
wages. ' Mr.: Wisler, denies that there has
been any serious; talk of, a strike, but" ha
admits that Intervening -labor . complica

tion: and- the "machinists may have, to
"change their pfans." ;ih any case it Is

The meeting of representatives of five
commercial organizations of the city,
â¢which was announced exclusively in The
Gall yesterday, came off yesterday after
roon in the rooms of the San Francisco
Bonrd of Trade, the business belns: the
consideration of a successor to Major
Harney as member of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners. The meeting was
fhort. A. A. Watklns. prtsident of the
Fan Francisco Board of Trade, presided.
The doors were promptly closed upon a
eecret session.
In fifteen minutes the meeting was ad
journed. A press committee gave out the
information that no candidate was pro
posed or puceested. but that the impor
tance 6f having- a well qualified man for
the position was fully discussed. It was
unanimously resolved that the chairman
of the meeting: and C R. Allen, who acted
as secretary, "should write to the Gover
nor, asking him "whether he would con
fer with the representative* of the com
mercial organizations .or the purpose of
having a Harbor Commissioner appointed
to fill the vacancy who would be well qual
ified for the position and acceptable to the
commercial community."
This leuer was to be drafted immedi
ately and sent to the Governor without
delay. No other business was transacted.
Those who were Dresent were:
Chamber of Commerce. President New
hall and Secretary Scott: Merchants' As
*oc!ation. President Dcjinnaiin and Direc
tor W. P. Redington; San Francisco Board
of Trade. President Watkins. T. J. Par
sons and E. R. Lilienthal; Manufacturers*
and Producers' Association. XV. J. Casey.
P. McG. McBean.and Charles .R. Allen;
Produce Exchange. President McNear and
TViiliem Babcock.
Those who were appointed to attend but
failed to apoear were Messrs. . F. J.
Srmmes and Huso Rothschild.
No- one claims yet to know where tlie
movement to get the merchants to in
dorse some one at the meeting originated.
President Ncwhall of the Chamber of
Coirmerce openly opposed having the
chamber take part as a body in local pol
itics and he did not appoint' any delega
tion to attend to represent the chamber,
hat went himself, accompanied by Secre
tary Scott. There was opposition* in the
Merchants' Association also, but the turn
that the affair took did not make it-neces
sary fcr it to be voiced. The publication
by The Call of the fact that a secret meet
ing was to be held killed the political
scheme behind it.
It is generally believed that Governor
Gage will appoint the new Commissioner
before the end of this week. When the
Governor was in San Francisco a few
days ago he said distinctly that the first
announcement of the appointment would
be made through the executive office, at
Sacramento. Tiie politicians who consider
themselves insiders as far as the State
administration goes confess that they
have not received the slightest hint of the
Governor's intentions. It is the impres
sion the appointment will create surprise.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Hewett remained in
the courtroom until after all papers had
been signed by the court, and. then.' ac
companied by their respective counsel,
left the hall. Prior to the hearing of the
action for divorce it was threatened that
Hewett would be proceeded against for
bigamy. The decree of . yesterday places
him out of the- path of danger.
After glancing over the marriage con
tract Judge Hunt pronounced it valid and
binding, and the proofs furnished by Mrs.
Hewett sufficed to entitle her to a decree,
and the order was made. - .-..' â¢â¢.'â¢*

of matrimony are as binding: by means of the
contract marriage a* by any other means that
has been practiced In this State; therefore, 1.
John B. Hewett. of the city of Redding. Shasta
County. California, do hereby take Mrs.' M. E.
Vollrath as my wife to have and cherish and
obey, abd I, Mrs. Mary E. Vollrath. of the city
of Redding. Shasta County. California, do
hereby take John B. Hewett as my lawful hus
band to have, cherish and obey, and that we
both, believing that this form of a marriage Is
as binding as though U had been performed by
the usual forms as ia practiced, therefore enter
Into this contract of marriage with the full de
termination of carrying out the said marriage
vows, as though a llcenre was procured and
the ceremony was performed by a clergyman or
other officer of the law qualified to perform
such ceremony. Â¦ .

When the case was called yesterday
Mr*. Hewett took. the stand and told of
her husband's desertion and neglect. Mrs.
Hewett was corroborated by Mrs. E. M.
Tobin. The proof of marriage was then
made clear to *he court by the production
of the following marriage contract:
REDDING. ", March 23. 1832.
Judge John Hunt in orderlng'yesterday
that a decree of divorce on the ground of
willful neglect issue in favor of 'Mary E.
Hewett and against John B. Hewett set
tled the dispute as to the validity of the
contract marriage entered into between
the litigants !n March of 1S92. Contrary
to expectations, Hewett;"who is a capital
ist of Bakersfield and whose desertion of
the plaintiff in the present action .and
subsequent marriage has been -fully ex
ploited in The Call. Instructed his attor
neys to answer Mrs. Hewett's complaint,
join the issues, produce the marriage con
tract and permit her to procure a divorce.
After bo instructing his attorneys Hewett
effected a money settlement with Mrs.
Hewett. and though her attorney is Tin
willing: to state the exact amount she re
ceived It Is certain that it will keep her
in comfort for some time to come.
