whom he expected to bear the name with
honor and to continue his branch of the
family, but the drug habit had fastened
itself upon the young man, wrecking him

TT^V ICHARD B.' POTTS, an Oakland
|_Wj young man of excellent ' family,
\t<S^ committed suicide early yesterday
morning by hanging himself in his
cell in the Alameda County Jail;
He had been sent to jail at his father's
instance and with his own consent in the
hope that he might be freed fronv the mor
phine habit, but despondency and the tor
ture of unsatisfied craving for the drug
caused him to^ take his own life.
Â¦All of this was sacrificed
by the young man through
the insidious influence of
morphine. The habit made
an abject slave of him, until
he became the associate of
dissipated wretches, his rea
son tottering and his body a
wreck. His imprisonment
was the last of a long series
of fruitless efforts to effect
his regenerations -
Young Potts had bright
prospects in life. His father
possessed wealth and social
position. He was an only
son, the last of , his branch
of the family. His father's
paternal love and pride and
hope of posterity were cen
tered in him, and exceptional
opportunities to obtain cul
ture and to satisfy ambition
were at his command.
Sick and despondent, a
miserable wreck from the
use of 'morphine and lack
ing the strength to struggle
longer against the habit,
Richard B. Potts, the only
son of a prominent Oakland
man/ put an end to his
wretched existence by hang

curred in a prison cell, where

secure'the drug would work his regenera

"I consulted with friends and physi
cians before taking- this step," said Mr.
Potts last evening, "and we decided that
this was the final effort. He was sent
to jail on, March 22- I found him getting

Young Potts was not strong mentally
when he began to use the drug. In 1893.
while at Chicago on a visit, he became
violently insane, and was brought home
to Oakland In charge of nurses. Imme
diately upon his arrival he was examined
and committed to the State Hospital at
Agnews. After six months of treatment
Potts was released on probation, and
never since had developed violent tend
encies. His actions were at times Indica
tive of mental aberration, but the physi
cians were not willing to pronounce him
a I subject for recommitment.

to be ready to resist the railroad aggres

To-morrow the Pomona City Council
will probably grant a franchise to the
street to the Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railroad Company. It may be that the
fight for the street will be continued only
in the courts from this time forth, but
the guarding of the city's rights will not
be relaxed a moment. Chief .Engineer
Swain says that he was sent here by the
Southern Pacific Company to construct a
side track on First street'and that he was
unprepared for the angry resistance his
men met with here. He says, however,
that the track will be laid when he wishes
to lay it and that the railroad company
owns half the land on First street.

The conduct of the Ministers of the pow

verse comment among the military
authorities. Their dilatory tactics have
prevented what might have been accom
plished two months ago. Even now the
meetings of the Ministers are postponed
for the most trivial causes, for instance,
the desire of one Minister to go on a pic
nic to the tombs of the Ming dynasty pre
vented the holding of a meeting for a
number of days. Then M. de Giers and
other Ministers insisted upon celebrating
Easter, and thus* a week was consumed.
In a third case a visit by one Minister to
Tientsin held up negotiations for four
days. These are fair illustrations of what
has been almost continuous since the be

will magnify a village quarrel into a big
rebellion. Th* ' missionaries, naturally
timid, take these reports in good faith."

of the highest importance as affecting the

at least 20,000 men if possible. These
troops, it was further contend?d by the
Japanese Minister, must be sent Into Man
churia, as the Russians reported great
disturbances there and it was not right
that the task of quelling the trouble
should be thrown upon the 'shoulders of
one nation. Finally Prince Ching was as
sured that if the 20,000 Chinese troops
could not suppress the disorders, in _ Man

Gill of this city, writing his mother
from Eureka Creek, Indian River district,
Klondike, tells of how -the rich, strike re
ported from that quarter was ' made on
March 2. Another Nanaimo man, one of
the large party of men from here now
working in Klondike, found rich pay dirt
Ih No. 12, Eureka Creek, and reported his
find quietly to McGlll, who at once let all
the other Nanaimo miners Into the secret
Arrangements were then made to travel
the sixty-two miles from | their, camp to
Eureka Creek during the night. Imme
diately after dark McGill, Pearson W
Speck, Willis, Pettigrew and Swanson set
off, and got clear of the camp without at
tracting the attention of their neighbors
They covered the sixty-two miles in rec
ord time, promptly staked out all they
wanted' and' then returned to. record It
was found that the dirt runs as high as$l
to the pan, and In some places more. The
discovery is on a hillside claim, .as most
of the claims are in â¢that locality, and it
will be very easy to work. â¢ .
McGill says that it will take a month dr
six weeks to determine. the full extent and
value of the discovery. As soon as the
news got out that a strike had been made
on Eureka a- qtampede set inland in a
short time every foot of land within miles
was under claim. The Nanaimo miners
are now developing as fast as they can
A settlement has ; already- grown up at

that the couple- should be returned there,
and if no case can be established against
them here they will be taken back to San

The persons mentioned In the foregoing
dispatch are known to the police of this
city, but whether a connection can be es
tablished between the woman and a series
of burglaries in the Mission is yet a. % ques
tion with- the police.
Captain Seymour received a dispatch
yesterday from ' Los Angeles, but, owing
to Its .Indeflniteness of description, was
unable to form any conclusion. ' The Los
Angeles officers were -instructed to hold
the couple pending further developments.
The woman was recently engaged as a
cook in the Meyberg home, and on Friday
afternoon disappeared. ; At the same time
about $1000 worth of jewelry also disap
peared. She was later seen in . the com
pany Of Gardella. At the time she had a
valise supposed to have contained the
stolen jewelry. â¢ ' .â¢
When the Â»man and woman parted, the
latter retained the valise, â¢ but when ! ar
rested the jewels were gone. The police
are of the opinion that the jewelry was
secreted in the Arroyo Seco, and all day
officers have been searching, the arroyo,
but so far without success. *

the claims of all the powers are paid. Af
ter years a chance could be given to China
to acGUire the properties out of the net
earnings, after the indemnity had been
provided for. Any surplus, and I believe
there will be a surplus,: could be used to
develop more railroads. >By that time the
Chinese problem would have been solved."
"Railroads will do more to enlarge the
prospective" of tho Chinese than any one
agency. They will teause the people of
the interior to travel and to acquire that
breadth of view which comes from con
tact with the world. Now China, is in
great need of railroads, while the rest of
the world is clamoring for broader trade
facilities. The situation seems to have
been created for reciprocal negotiations
along a certain line.
"I believe that this is the golden oppor
tunity for the introduction of "Western
ideas into the Flowery Kingdom, and the
apparent disaereement of the powers up
on the amount of indemnity to f|e paid for
the Boxer disturbances should lead to
some sort of compromise having: for its
object the' development of undeveloped
Asia, rather than the levying of a mere
monetary fine which could be raised by
additional taxation and in the end peri
haps leave the real situation of the coun
try unchanged. I have a plan in my own
mind which I think worthy of the atten

would be a civilizing influence. It is thhir
Let the powers agree upon the amount of
indemnity 'to be paid -; and to contract

Department Says Second
* Class Matter Privilege
Is Closed.
Of the many means by which publica
tions not properly entitled to this favored
postage rate spring into existence and
thrive, no other, it is asserted by. Mr.
Madden, is so fruitful and so insidious as
the permission â not of law or rule, but of
uninterrupted practiceâ that subscriptions
may be obtained by offers of premiums or
merchandise, chances to draw prizes In
guessing contests and countless ingenious
inventions oT similar character. Circula
tions running into the thousands and into
the millions, the circular says, have been
built up by this premium process for pub
lications which, upon actual merit, could
command no public patronage whatever.
Such "subscriptions." except In an occa
sional instance where some actually mer
itorious publication employs the plan, rep
resent In no literal sense a public interest
in the literature or in the news to which
it is claimed such publications are de
voted.
Mr. Madden asks that the matter be
given prompt attention, and says that the
reform proposed can scarcely Â¦ be carried
on successfully without the aid and moral
support of the standard newspapers and
periodicals of the country.
The circular asserts that the loss of
revenue to the Government from the
abuses of the privileges of second-class
matter is enormous, being estimated con
servatively to be "between $15,000,000 and
$25,000,000 a year. Existing regulations,
however, faithfully administered are in
adequate to accomplish immediate re
forms, and the most prolific Â¦ means by
which the law is circumvented remains
undisturbed by regulation.
It Is believed that such a rule as that pro-
Iiosed would be of great benefit to legitimate
journalism, and 'that In a very large measure
it will check this draft upon the public treas
ury for private advantage with no compensa
tion or public benefit, through the elimination
of an immense number of publications which
are wholly sustained in their second-class
Etatus by patronage Induced Â¦ by some ex
traneous thing in conflict with the spirit of
the law. Such a consummation has much of
promise in the direction of better postal facili
ties and cheaper rates for other classes of
mall matter. I
Mr. Madden adds:
In the Judgment of those addressed will a
departmental rule ba regarded as Injurious to
legitimate papers and periodicals which will
stop absolutely all premium inducements, dl
rfct or Indirect and of whatever character, for
subscriptions? In other words, after a pub
lisher has fixed a price on his publication any
bonus or premium given to the subscriber or
any combination with anything except a sec
ond class publication shall .vitiate that sub
scription In Its relation to the second-class
rates of postage.

delegation has been received from the
Governors of Missouri, Maine and Mon

The call for the conference Is signed
by the leading economists, tax experts
and public men representing all portions
of the country and ali interests. The let
ter of invitation says: _
For many decades the States have been
building- up Independent systems of taxation
without reference to each other until now we
have a state of affairs bordering on chaos
where each State is practically fighting nearly
everj- other State. Some property Is taxed
three or four times, while other property is
not taxed at all. Corporate activity has
largely changed the character of individual
investments. Industry has overstepped the
boundaries of any one State, and commercial
interests are no longer confined to mere local
limits. This conference will be the first at
tempt In this country to work out some uni
form principles. It is not expected to settle
any .of" the problems in the two days' dis
cussion, but it will be a beginning and may
result in the appointment of a permanent

WASHINGTON, April 14.â Secretary
Root has approved the report of a re
vision and codification of the army reg
ulations prepared by a commission con
sisting of Assistant . Secretary of War
Sanger, Lieutenant Colonel Davis of the
judge advocate general's department and
Lieutenant Colonel Johnson of the ad
jutant general's department. This re
vision and codification was necessary on
account of the -many changes that have
been made In the army regulations by
law and general orders since the last
book of regulations was printed, also by
the changes of the conditions in th*
Â¦United States. '
One of the regulations, drawn in times
when troops were stationed upon the
frontier of the United States, allowed the
commanding officer of a post or camp to
issue arms and ammunition to settlers
for the purpose of self-protection against
the Indians.
This was not made specific and as the
frontier of the United States has practi
cally disappeared the order could now be
interpreted to allow the Issuance of arms
to people in the Philippines, Porto Rico,
Cuba or . Alaska. It was thought neces
sary to rescind this regulation.
The change from a regimental to com
pany . organization' of the artillery also
has necessitated many changes. Some
minor changes also were made regarding
payments of troops and also regarding
the transport service, as transports were
not a part of "the army establishment
when the old regulations were drawn up.
It is Intended to have these new regula
tions printed at once and placed In the
hands of all the army officers appointed
and to be appointed under the reorganiza
tion law. â¢ _

THE County Fair," the favorite old
New England pastoral, appears to
have lost none of its quaint power
to charm. Last night the Cali
fornia Theater was crowded to
the doors, and the orchestra moved out
to make way for the audience that came
to greet Neil Burgess in his famous part
of the shrewd and kindly New England
spinster, Miss Abigail Prue. His work
has lost none of its quaint flavor since his
last visit here, seven years ago, with the
same play. The lovable Miss Abby, with
her sound "hoss" sense, good heart, fine
simplicity, full of quaint saws and kindly
wisdom, is just as Mr. Burgess drew her
seven years ago, and a person with whom
one is glad to renew acquaintance. John
C. Fenton, who as Otis Tucker is four
teen years in learning to "speak for him
self, John," takes excellent care of the
shy wooer's part, and Nicholas Sebastian
is a fairly elective villain as Solon Ham
merhead. Harry Burkhart does good
work as Joel Bartlett, and Tim is well
played by Harry S. Stafford.
Miss Blanche C. Rice has a good Bow
ery accent as Taggs, the waif, showing all
the requisite impishness in clever fash
ion. Sue Seymour is a rather stiff Sallie
Greenaway. . /
There is a- good quartet with the com
pany, that sings a trio of melodies at the
husking-bee in quite effective manner.
The horserace illusion created the usual
excitement, and the audience went home
highly pleased with its evening's enter
tainment. On Friday evening next some
of the prominent jockeys of Tanforan will
ride the horses in the race scene.

Blanche Walsh's engagement at the Co
lumbia Theater continues throughout this
week. Her performance of Josephine in
"More Than Queen" Is a splendid work
and the staging of the play is all that
could be desired. The last performance
will take place next Sunday night. Next
week and the following week also the Co
lumbia will be dark, this being a result
of the cancellation of James K. Hackett's
tour, owing to that actor's illness.

This week at the Central Theater will
be seen the rarely produced "Julius
Caesar," with Robert Downing 1 as Marc
Antony. Mason Mitchell, a clever legiti
mate actor, has been engaged to play the
part of Cassius, and Brutus will be
taken by Robert Cummings. The large
company at the Central will also be fur
ther augmented for the production,' and
the management has put forth an extra
ordinary effort in the mounting of the
tragedy. The play will doubtless call out
large audiences, as the opportunity of
hearing. is so seldom afforded.
Among those who have signified their
intention of being present are President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University
of California, President David Starr Jor
dan of Stanford University, General W.
R. Shafter, Rev. D. D. Crowley. and Hon.
R. H. Webster, Superintendent of Schools,
who all unite in warmly commending the

AUSTIN, Tex. April 14.â Arch Arnold
has been released from thÂ© State Peni
tentiary on a full paidon granted him by
Governor Sayers. The man who has been
thus given his liberty was a fugitive from
justice for over a quarter of a century.
He returned to Texas and voluntarily
surrendered to the prison authorities of
the penitentiary on December 30, 1900, and
asked that he might be permitted to serve
the remainder ox the sentence that had
been hanging over jim for so many years.
He was again placed in the prison and
has just been pardoned at the earnest
solicitation of his old friends in the State
who were familiar with the remarkable
case.
In 1873 two men were murdered in Lam
pasas County. Texas, near the Coryell
County line. One of the murdered men
was named LlttlefioM and the other was
named Fetner. Jim Arnold and his three
sons, who resided in Coryell County, were
accused of the crime. The' two elder sons,
"William and Allen, were charged with
having directly committed. the deed, and
their father and his then fifteen-year-old
son Arch were charged with being ac
cessories. They all tied the country be
fore they could be arrested. Two years
later old man Arnold and his son Arch re
turned to Coryell County. They were ar
rested and tried for murder. The old man
was convicted and sentenced to a term of
ninety-nine years in the State peniten
tiary. The case was appealed and re
versed by the highei court and a change
of venue was taken from Lampasas
County to Burnet County, where an ac
quittal was secured on the second trial of
the case against him.
Arch Arnold, his son, was tried, con
victed and given a sentence of five years
in the penitentiary. After serving two
years of the sentence ho escaped from
prison and was not heard of afterward
until he put in an appearance at the State
penitentiary a few months ago and asked
to be allowed to serve out the remainder
of the interrupted sentence.
After escaping from the penitentiary
over twenty-five years, ago, the young
man went to California, where he secured
employment. He worked honestly and
faithfully and saved enough money to buy
for himself a fruit farm. He married and
has a family of children almost grown.
He and his family have the respect of
the people of the community in which
they reside. During all these years Ar
nold kept the fact of the shadow that was
hanging over him in Texas from his
family and it was not until he had raised
his children and accumulated a sufficient
amount of this world s goods to keep him
and his devoted wife and children from
want during the remainder of their days
on earth that he revealed the secret of
his life to them and informed them that
he was going- back to Texas to serve out
his sentence in prison in order that he
might live the remainder of his days with
out the fear of arrest. Immediately after
securing his liberty the pardoned man de
parted for his California home.

Southward and westward from New England come
tales of a similar purport. Spring has come to all that
wide region beyond the Rockies, but it has brought
no ethereal mildness. Storms, rains, freshets, floods
and thunderbolts have taken the place of the April
showers that have gladdened the Pacific Coast, and
the pec pic are feeling in anything rather than a picnic
hvmor. Nor have the inhabitants of. that section
much better things to look for ward. to. As soon'as
the spring tempests are over the heats of summer
will come, and then the folks who are now swearing
at the wind will be sighing for a zephyr. Truly, there
are good people who remain in the East, but the wise
ones come West. *
While these disasters were* occurring on land the
coasting vÂ«?sels suffered at sea; for the rains were
<icompanied by storm winds, and there was' scarcely
a danger point along the New England coast that did
not have its wreck to show the fury of winds an.i
waves.
New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts were
no better off. Their rivers were as uproarious os
these of Maine. Many of the mill towns were flooded,
and repcits announce that mill after mill was shut
down because of the floods. The damage, though
not great in any one locality, was in the aggregate a
very heavy one, amounting to many millions of dol
lars in value, and several lives were lost.
CZ^ROM all parts 01 the country east of the Mis-
I sissippi and north of the Ohio our exchanges
come to us filled wth wailings over a wild and
stormy spring. There was rain on Easter Sunday,
*o the church parade was spoiled, and since then there
have been bigger rains that have done even worse
damage.
All ever New England the rains have been so con
tinuous as to' raise tltf: rivers to flood height. On
April 7, Easter Sunday, it was announced from Maine
that the Pcnobscot was then higher than for mqny
years \ nst, and was still rising. The waters of the
romantic Kcnduskeag were roaring and carrying
bridges down to the sea. The Piscataquis, the Great
Qssipcc and the Little Ossipce were also raging, and
all the towns along them were in the swim.
SFRINGTiME IN ThJE EAST.

As a prophet he is improving, but it is doubtful if
he enjoys the improvement.
1HE markets of the country showed more or less
irregularity last week. The iron and steel trades
showed the greatest strength, and while the pro
cuction of pig iron is very large, approaching the
maximum of last year, stocks continue to decrease.
Finished products are very active and most mills are
scld fully up to July. The export (jemand has fallen
oft somewhat, though some good orders are still being
received. The decrease in stocks during the past six
months foots up the l?rge total of 203,656 tons, and
when the enormous production is considered some
idea of the activity in the iron trade may be gained.
The other staples t!o not make such a brilliant
exhibit Cotton is laboring under the burden of low
prices, and there is some talk of reducing this year's
acreage, though planting is apparently going on as
sctively as ever. Cotton products, however, are show
ins a little more strength, which leads to the hope
thr.t bedrock has been touched. Wool continues
t 4 uiet, and the New England mills have suffered from
enforced idleness on account of high water in the
riven. The boot and shoe trade is reported good in
the West, but in the East business is falling off again.
Wheat was weak and declining for some days, and
the Government issue 1 ? very bearish crop report,
showing fine crop prospects almost everywhere. It
produced no effect, however, and the market actually
hardened at Chicago on the day of its issuance, show
i:.g that it had been discounted. Fluctuations in
wheat, however, have been narrow for some time,
and with all the appreciations and depreciations the
market docs not get much away from $1 per cental
cither way. Hides continue weak and depressed, and
in this market stocks are accumulating. Provisions
are weak one day and fitm the next at Western cen
teis, but stocks are still light all over the country,
owing to the scarcity in hogs, and the general tone
of the market is firm, while prices are above the nor
n'al: Livestock of all descriptions is also higher than
the average for a number of years, though a declin
ing tendency is noted in mutton.
In general trade the Northwest and Pacific Coast
continue to make the best^howing in point of activ
ity. The Northwest reports large numbers of buyers
â¢n the towns, with a very satisfactory distributive
business, both wholesale and retail. The East re
ports wholesale trade dull, but retail trade good.
The bank clearings of the country gained 34 per cent
over the corresponding week last year, all important
cities except Milwaukee showing an increase, the
largest being 45.8 per cent at New York. The' fail
ex rs for the week were 203, against 193 for the same
week last year. Both sets of figures are satisfactory,
the large clearings showing an expansion in trade'
while the failures are comparatively few.
Speculation in Wall street, while still active, is char
acterized by more conservatism, owing to a hardening
of the money market, which, while not approaching a
stringency, is still sufficient to check the recent rapid
advance in prices. This was the only feature of the
week in Wall street.
Our local markets -have shown no noteworthy
changes for several months. Business continues good
all along the line, with the exception of two or thr*e
branches. Prospects for smaller crops of fruits, ow
ing to frosts, north winds, and the failure of the'trees
to set heavily, in consequence of their enormous crops
hst year, have given the frait market a stronger tone,
though no advance :c prices has resulted. Rain is'
needed in most sections; though no seroius "damage
is reported anywhere, and with an occasional spring
rain from now on the usual good crops will probably
he harvested. The Government report gives the con
dition of the California wheat crop at 100. The ex
port business of the coast is not as rushing as it was
last year, and vessels are not as hard to obtain, but
rc are still shipping out large quantities of goods to
the north, south and the Orient by every, steamer.
No complaints of the condition of trade are being
heard from any quarter.
CONDITION OF BUSINESS
pUjROM air international festivities there naturally
I grow sanguine hope of lasting intAnational
friendships. The men of the different nations
who meet together where wine flows free and music
fills the air, where every accessory adds to. the joyous
ness of the time and promotes good will to all the
world, find so much of congeniality in each other
that they can hardly avoid becoming victims of 'the
delusion that between their own people and the peo
ple of their new-made friends there can never more
be ill will or antagonism.
Such being the nature of men it is not strange to
learn that the French and the Italians who shared
in the recent festivities at Toulon have concluded that
between France and Italy there is now to be lasting
amity and an understanding that will virtually amount
to an alliance.
One of the enthusiasts, the editor of Figaro, exultant
ly says: "If any one ten years ago had predictecUo tha
French that the day would come when- Italian sailors
would be acclaimed at Toulon, when the uncle of.
the King, at the head of a squadron, would pay a visit
to the President of th= republic and would be re
ceived with, enthusiasm, that person would have
passed for a lunatic." After recounting the various
expressions of antagonism between the two countries
at that time, he adds: "Those unhappy days are
passed. Italy has no longer any fear of our inter
vention, and we, on our side, no longer wish any harm
to the ally of Germany, for at bottom we no longer
hate Germany. Our soldiers are fighting side by side
with theirs, and our capitalists are disputing who will
lend Germany money."
Even persons at a distance have been affected by
the spirit of the fete, and St. Petersburg authorities
are reported as declaring that, while they do not
anticipate a French alliance with Italy as the outcome
of the festivities, they deem it qujte likely that the
friendship there affirmed will cause Italy to modify
the text of her treaty with Austria and Germany, $0
as to make it less inimical to France; and conse
quently that the important results will flow from the
new feeling of international friendship.
Sanguine expectations of that kind are always
pleasant to contemplate. Anything which tends toward
preserving the peace of the world by promoting
friendliness among tha peoples of different nations
is always gratifying. People who are lacking
in enthusiasm of temper will, however, be doubt
ful of any important results flowing from what
is. after all, but a holiday merry-making. The
very quickness with which the French have put
aside their attitude of watchfulness against Germany
and Italy is itself a proof that as soon as any
change comes over them they may just as quickly
pass once more to an attitude of antagonism. . Inter
national diplomacy cannot permit itself to be affected
by the passing impulses of the general mass of people.
It must be based firmly upon the permanent interests
of nations, and not until those interests are more har
monious than at present will there be any consider
able alteration of existing alliances. France and Italy
have had a good time in their mutual interchange of
courtesies and hospitality and should rejoice in it with
out counting too much on the future. Â¦ â¢ â¢
THE TOULON FESTIVITIES.
According to our Consuls, Germany has in opera
lion an electric motor tiain that covers 125 miles an
hour, and the English are to put one in operation
that will make the trip from, Manchester to Liverpool,'
a distance of thirty-four miles, in twenty minutes. It
will be seen that Uncle Sam will have to get a move
on or he will lose his reputation for speed.
The young manâ he is but 46â who has
accomplished all this did it by no fierce
and wasting efforts of his own cr of oth
ers. He did not sit up nights or co?oe to
his desk at dawn, nor did he expect extra
ordinary performances of those associated
with him. He did not fume or scold or
worry when his bank was emerging from
obscurity In the trying days of the early
80s, nor did he lose heart when to most of
his board of directors It seemed that the
struggle against powerful competition was
too severe for ultimate success. The same
imperturbable, gracious calmness which
distinguished him then characterizes him
now. There are no wrinkles on his brow,
the light and colors of youth are yet in
his face and care has made no marks
upon him.
For tha last ten -years he has been re
cognized as the representative financier of
the Great West. In London and Paris his
name is better known than that of hl3

Chicago have been for years the informal
meeting place of Chicago and Western
millionaires who made a practice of
"dropping in" casually to chat over great
financial projects, feel the pulse of the

Mr. Mitchell Is the eldest of six children
of William II. Mitchell, vico president or
the bank of which his son is president.
He was born in Alton, 111., on Novemb >:â¢
2. 1S54, and he may have inherited a love
If not a genius for banking, for hla father
was then regarded as a leading financier
and was president of the First National
Bank of Alton. Bolng the son of a rich
man, as wealth was estimated In tho?e
days, he had the advantages of a good
home and the opportunities of education.
His parents were of quaker origin. It
was a very old-fashioned household, and
the children seemed to flourish morally
and physically in it.
When he was 1G years old ho was sent
to the Union Wesleyan Seminary nt
Kents Hill, Me., and after two years to
the Waterville Classical Institute. His
father was willing tf not anxious to have
him complete his collegiate course and
go to a university, but the son preferred
to "do something." It was about th's
time that the Illinois Trust and Savings
Bank was organized, with L. B. Sldw^y
as president. William. H. Mitchell hat
moved to Chicago with his family, and
was one of the original stockholders lit
the bank. John, coming home from
school at this time, eager for work and
and with the advantage of a quick intelli
gence, a practical education and his fath
er's good name, was appointed to a hui.i
ble position in the bank. There were not
more than half a dozen clerks in it,
and young Mitchell quickly displayed a
willingness to turn his hand to the. least
attractive duties. He had the rare qual
itv of concentration, and whether stick

Ask any of the directors and stockhold
ers of the great Institution at -Jackson
boulevard and LaSalle street, "Who *s
chiefly responsible for the phenomenal
success of your bank?'" and he will quickly
answer, "John J. Mitchell." When he first
took in hand the reins of manaspment the
capital of the little bank was only JiOO.fO)
and the stockholders, tired of its tailure to
earn a decent percentage on thei*- invest
ments, were eager to wind up its aifairs.
To-day its resources aggregate about $78,
000,000, Its stock commands an extraord
inary premium and its name 13 a synonym
for all that is safest, wisest and best in the
banking and trust business of the United
Stales.
Managing a Great Bank.
If the dynamic unit of Chicago financial
life is sought for, go to room 9, Illinois
Trust and Savings Bank, where John J.
Mitchell presides. Mr. Mitchell began his
career as a banker twenty-seven years
ago', or,, to be exact, on May 7, 1873, in an
unpretentious little savings bank which
led a precarious existence in a, room at the
northwest corner of Madison and Market
streets, Chicago. He was 19 years olJ tho
oay he took his place on a high stool be
hind the dingy grated window, above
which, in newly painted letters, gleamed
the words "assistant teller." His duties
combined those of messenger boy, office
boy and collector. His salary was $35 e
month. To-day he Is personally the man
ager, as for years past he has beeii the
guiding spirit, of the richest, busiest and
most influential bank west of New York.
The National City Bank of that city is
the only one In the United States that has
a greater volume of as highly profitable
business.
' No considerable financial hns
been worked out in Chicago during the
last decadeâ certainly none since the
World's Columbian Expositionâ without
an assenting opinion from his lips or the
sanction of his remarkable judgment. But
he is much more than adviserâ his Is the
comprehensive mind in which are evolved
,the endless minutae of great financial un
dertakings; and small, indeed, is the do
tail, trifling the contingency, which he
does not anticipate and provide against.
When Eastern capitalists seek a Chicago
outlet for their money they send their con
fidential agents,. their engineers, their au
ditors and their legal counsel to report on
the details. 'But .when all the surveys are,
made and all the "expert opinions" are In
then they come in persojh to lay everything
before John J. Mitchell, whose judgment
and sagacity outweigh much technical
verbiage. Then they are ready to act.

Another point of interest in the report 'is that com

the' last few years, the effect of which is that they no
longer send up the long stalks so necessary to set
off the showy blossoms, but carry their flowers within
a few inches of the ground. The lily industry of Ber

bulbs for shipment, and these, transplanted to Ameri

Let the world's rage and contempt for such a gov
ernment be uttered by the students of the free coun
t-ties, and let those of -the United States lead.
The Russian students have no arms, no means of
defense. They are herded by the most beastly sol
diery that ever defiled the earth by marching on it,
witli no human instinct and with habits that the
beasts of the field do not disgrace themselves by
practicing.
It is a condition of affairs which, considered in its
origin and consequences, should rouse the indignation
of the world. If it be possible to make a govern
ment feel the contempt of mankind, Russia should
have that sensation. The student bodies of the
United States should in some organized way express
their sympathy for their fellows, the young men and
women of Russia, who aie denied rights so commonly
enjoyed here that to abridge them would be instantly
resisted.
When this miserable outrage was committed on the
students at Kiev, others in the universities at St.
Petersburg and Moscow expressed sympathy for the
hapless lads, and for this have been shot down, their
flesh cut by Cossack whips and their lifeless bodies
trampled in the snow.
The sentence was not by a regular court of law,
but by a court-martial, though the condemned were
civilians and therefore answerable to the civil courts
only.
The meeting was quiet and no conclusion was
reached. But it was against the law to meet at all.
Five of the students who participated were arrested
and put in prison, and n number of others were repri
manded. No student of Kiev had before been put
in a penal cell, unless guilty of a crime against person
or property. Another meeting was held, at which
it was resolved to ask the university authorities to
remit the severe punishment of their comrades. The
rector of the university refused to grant them an,
audience, whereupon they resolved to stay in session
until he would see them. At 8 o'clock that evening
the Cossacks and soldiers arrived with General Novit
zky, head of the police, and many other officials. . The
troops present and under arms numbered 8oo. The
rtctor appeared, refused the request of the students,
and they quietly dispersed: But their names were
U-kcn, and^for doing just what we have narrated and
nothing more, two hundred of these young men have
been condemned to the barracks, which means mili
tary servitude of the most degrading and galling
nature.
A student in the University of Kiev had robbed a
woman of some personal property. The students felt
his conduct as an imputation and stain upon thein
all, and held an orderly meeting to take measures to
clear themselves and their school of any ill-repute that
might result from the crime of one of their number.
In Russia all meetings of the people are prohibited
by law. Such peaceful assemblages as are known and
common in this and other civilized countries are a
crime in that barbarous autocracy.
IN order to understand the enormity of the current
Russian persecution of the students it is necessary
to know its cause.
RUSSIAN PERSECUTION.
him the important work of calling off
items to the teller, he did It with n.d
whole heart.
Working Up the Business.
Being modest and cheerful, the other
clerks did not deny him the Information
which they had spent years In mastering,
and while he. was running errands for
the bookkeeper, the teller and even the col
lector, he was learning the details of
each superior's duties. When he was pro
moted he did not learn to despise the mes
senger boy, but rather went out of his
way to help him.
In 1S75 the bank moved to Clark street,
between Washington and Madison, and
Mr. Mitchell, still a teller, came to be
recognized as a valuable Influence in tlÂ»e
institution. He knew more about things
connected with the bank than any of
his colleagues, and hl3 influence at tho
window came to be felt in Increased de
posits and new customers who asked for
"John." In 187S the Fidelity Bank failed,
and the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank
removed into its abandoned quarters on
Randolph street, being encouraged to ex
pand by a gradual growth of deposits and
credit. H. G. Powers became president
upon the retirement of Mr. SIdway that
year, and John J. Mitchell was advanced
to the position .of cashier. But then trou
blous days came for the savings bank's,
and the small earnings of the struggling
institution fell away. The capital stock,
which had been made $500,000, was reduced
to $100,000, and many of the discouraged
stockholders, prophesying disaster, urged
the dissolution of the business.
Becomes a Bank President.
It was then that the cheerful and well
considered opinions of young Mitchell
came to be of dominant weight in the
directors* room. He had plans for the
safe enlargement of the business, saw
where Imperfect methods could be improv
ed and lost opportunities regained. His
suggestions were adopted and the fading
profits of the bank came back in larger
measure; no loans were made except upon
â¢sound collateral, the bank reached out tor
new business and got it upon the most
conservative basis.
In 1880 Mr. Powers retired and the ques
tion of choosing a new president became
all important to the success of the insti
tution, then In the most critical stage of
its career. John J. Mitchell was only 26
years old, yet a majority of the directors
at once agreed that he was the man for
the place. His father and a few of the
other directors said it would be ridiculous
to place a boy at the head of a bank. A
well-known, wealthy man of long exper
ience and of standing as a financier was
what they wanted. Finally the adherents
of young Mitchell prevailed over all but
his father, who continued to insist that
John was too young. Some members of
the board finally said that they would
withdraw if the appointment was not
made. They had been leaning upon his
judgment and profiting by his efforts and
they would have no other man for their
president. So the elder Mitchell was
compelled to acquiesce.
Building Up a Great Business.
That the confidence placed In him was
merited became quickly evident- Ener
getic and unhampered work by the young
president soon brought the deposits to
$1,000,000â a wonderful showing for a new
bank at that time. In 1SSS the business of
the bank had increased to so great an ex
tent that its old quarters was no longer
sufficient and the ground floor of the
Rookery svas chosen for the place for
the third removal. The capital stock had
been increased to $2,000,000, a sum twenty
times greater than the capital of the in
stitution when Mr. Mitchell began to take
part in. Its direction, and its surplus was
$2,500,000. Its quarters became one of the
show places of Chicago, and even Presi
dent Mitchell and his most optimistic ad
mirers did not then believe that the bank
could ever outgrow its new home.
For twenty years President Mitchell has
been so much the head and motive power
of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank
that its history J3 hla history. Until three
years ago his vacations were few and
short. He was married in 1S90 to Alias
Louise Jewett.of Cambridge. Mass. but
even his honeymoon did not keep him
many months from hla office desk. The
business crew until he Raw within reas
onable possibility the chance to make of
it the greatest bankin* institution in the

for years hla chief recreation has been

The Great Financier of To-Day.^
Tho later history of the growth of Mr
Mitchell's bank Is familiar to tlnanclors!
When the space in the Rookery becam'o
too confined for its expanding business
the directors, advised by tho president
determined to secure a permanent homo
and one that would surpass any similar
structure in the world. The building at
tho northeast corner of Jackson Boule
vard and La Salle Street is the result. It
cost nearly $750,000 and Is by architectural
critics conceded to be the most beautiful
and most complete bank building in the
world. Every feature of its plan and
every detail of its construction received
the personal attentiqn of President Mit
chell himself.
Soon after the completion of tho new
building his health was threatened and
he took the first long vacation of his busi
ness career. His vigor soon returned and
with it renewed ambition for the future
of his bank. Recently he has become in

Brings Many Soldiers.
The army transport Thomas, twenty
nine days from Manila and twenty days
from Nagasaki, arrived In port yesterday
afternoon. It was after sundown before
she was passed by, the quarantine officer,
so nobody was allowed to come ashore un
til this morning:. The run -across the Pa
cific was marked by one fatality. Louis
Smith, a cabin boy, fell overboard an-1
was killed. He went aft to ' empty a
bucket over the stern. As he tilted the
receptacle the ship Â¦ gave a roll and the
boy, losing his balance, fell headforemost
between the revolving screws. He must
have been cut to pieces, as the body did
not come to the surface again. The lad's
father is chief plumber aboard the
Thomas, and he has been nearly crazy
with grief since the accident.
Captain Buford of the Thomas says the
Rosecrans, with the remainder of the
Thirty-fifth Infantry, Is coming home via
Honolulu. The Lawtdfc left Nagasaki a
day ahead of the Thomas, and should ar
rive to-day. The Garonne, now out twen
ty-flve days with the Twenty-sixth In
fantry from Nagasaki, was not sighted
during the voyage. The transport offi
cials expect her to-day. . ,

GRASS VALLEY, April 14.â The second
marriage . of Mrs. Angelina Nelson . and
Frank - Nelson- of Grass .Valley occurred
at Reno, Nev., this week.,- The couple
were divorced some months ago, but they
found life dreary Â¦ without each other.
Nelson is engaged in the. plumbing busi
ness in this city. â¢
Divorotd and Then Bemarried.
There has been a great scarcity of
sailors along 1 the water front for the last
two months and the boarding masters
have been driven to many an expedient
in order to secure men to man the grain
fleet. In several instances vessels have
gone out with "ereen" crews while the
salmon fleet took awav the best men "on
the beach."
When the Otto Gildermeister was towed
In here in distress from San Diego she
had a full crew of A. B.'s aboard. All
the men had from $75 to $100 coming to
them, however, and not one of them coulrl
at first be induced to desert. They wanted
their money and if Captain Wilmsen was
willing to pay them off they would agree
to accept a passage to New York instead
of to Germany, where the ship's articles
say they should be paid off. This the
captain would not agree to. If the men
wanted to leave the ship well and good: if
they elected to stand by until she was
ready for sea again also well and good.
This state of affairs did not suit the
boarding masters, however. Each man
was worth $40 "blood money" to them and
as much more as thev could get out of
the first month's advance. Thev there
fore concocted a scheme to get the men to
desert. A lad known us "Snake" Hennesy
was pressed into service, and after a
careful training was smuggled aboard the
Otto Gildermeister. A few days later it
was whispered along the front that tha
dismasted German was haunted. Fully
half the crew had seen the ghost of a dead
and gone comrade capering around the
forecastle while the other half had heard
him groaning m his last agony. "Snake"
did his work well and Inside of three days
there was not an able seaman on the Otto
Gildermeister who would not swear that
the ghost of Hans Peterson, who fell from
aloft and was killed, was haunting the
ship. :
The trick of the boarding masters now
began to bear fruit First two of the men
slipped quetly away, leaving $150 In p*y
behind them and twenty-four hours later
they were on their way out through the
Golden Gate on one of the grain fleet.
Then two more got ashore and were
shipped north on a steam whaler. An
other brought suit against the captain, to
recover his wages but was rushed aboard
a ship that wanted one man to conmlete
her crew and the lawyer has been com
pelled to drop the case.
The ehost did its work well. The Ottc
Gildermelster is left with only a couole
of A. B.s and the boarding masters are
richer by $500. ?:..:'<

Tne Wellington's Narrow Escape.
The collier Wellington had a narrow es
cape in Oakland Creek yesterday. She
was leaving Taylor's wharf and the tug
Redmond was assisting her. Captain Sal
round was giving .the signal "half-Epeed
astern" when the Indicator broke at "half
speed ahead," which order the engineer
obeyed. While trying to rectify the mis
take the Indicator moved around to "full
speed ahead." This signal was also
obeyed, and in a few seconds the Welling
ton was speeding for the wharf, with the
Redmond doinjr her best to hold her back.
The first officer made a Hying trip to the
Vnelne-room and had the engines reversed
just In time to avert the threatened col
lision. Â¦ ' Â¦

REV. DR. WILLIAM "J. TUCKER,
president of Dartmouth College,
occupied the pulpit in the First
Congregational Church at the
Â¦ morning service yesterday and
delivered an eloquent sermon on "A Man's
Soul and His World." In anticipation of
a sermon by the distinguished educator
the church was crowded, and during the
whole of the discourse Dr. Tucker held
the complete attention of the congrega
tion. The entire sermon was devoted to
his text. At the conclusion of the service
Dr. Tucker held an informal reception and
was introduced to many Dartmouth grad
uates wha reside in' this city. Rev. Dr.
Tucker preached in part as follows:
"The questoln of personal salvation is
not what we are saved from but what we
are saved to, what we take up with us in
the process of our salvation. You send
your ship to sail the sea. It comes back
to you almost a wreck, the cargo lost,
and with only enough of its crew left to
bring the dismantled hulk to port. That
may be a grand sight. It may tell its own
story of suffering and heroism. A whole
city may turn out before it in welcome.
But that was not the object for which
you sent your ship to sail the sea. You
waited its return freighted with the riches
for which you built your ship and picked
your crew to man it.
"God sends a soul into this world and
it comes back almost a loss, alone, and
empty-handed. That may be a, grand
sight. It may tell its own story of tempta
tion and struggle and victory, a scarred
soul, but saved. All heaven may turn out
to give It welcome. But that was not the
end for which God sent that soul into the
world. He waited its return rich with the
earnings of the years of time.
"Heaven, it is a common saying, is re
served for those who fail here. Men may '
so fail here that there is no place In
heaven too high for them. But men may
so succeed here as to enrich heaven. I
read in the vision of the holy city? "They
shall bring the glory and the honor of
nations Into it.' That .is the honorable,
the legitimate, the actual contribution of
earth to heaven.
! "Who can compute the earnings of great
souls? Your roll of honor may disclose
hereafter the names of those who have
fought for their souls as men fight for

I regard soap as a medicine. It either benefits or injures. The
pores of the body take into the system more or less of the soap, and
the blood carries the same to every organ of the body. Therefore,
it is important that people should use only soap that is free from all
poisonous fats and alkalies. Witch Hazel is used in every hospital
throughout the civilized world, and is endorsed by physicians as Na-
ture's Greatest Skin Remedy, Having combined Witch Hazel with
other known healing and curative medicaments, Imostpositively assert
that lam offering to the Public th2 Best Toilet Soap Ever Made. I mean
by this that it is best for the complexion, best for the scalp, best for
the baby, best for curing all skin eruptions. It will soften the roughest
skin; it will cure chapped hands and lips in a night, it wili positivelv
cure dandruff and all scalp diseases, and allay all forms of itching. It
is more soothing than Cold Cream, more healing than any lot-on,
liniment or salve, more, beautifying than any, cosmetic. Every ingre-
dients this Soap is pure enough to eat. I want the Public to hive the
sameconfidence in this Soap that they have in my remedies. â MUNYON.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS
FOR NEW YORK- RACING
Season Will Open . at the Aqueduct
â¢ __ Track Under Eavorable
. * Conditions.
NEW YORK, April 14.â The racing sea
son'in the Metropolitan district will be
gin to-morrow and | will continue until
winter. . The occasion will be the spring
meeting of the Queens - County Jockey
Club at the Aqueduct track, and there
is every pfospect.of a successful season.
Th(f Aqueduct meeting bids fair to have
animals of good class to compete for the
purses, as many will be tried out there
for the: richer fixtures at the big tracks.
The Carter handicap will be : the chief
feature of the day, and a lot of good ones
are engaged, \ many with reports of fast
trials. . - i .
: Rarely has a racing season . opened with
more promise. The stakes will be larger
all the year than in any other season, and
the class of horses which will be there to
try for them will be better than in some
years. Last year there was a dearth of
three-year-olds, but. this season such good
ones as Commando, Bellario, Beau Gal
lant; Water Color, Garry Herman, King
Pepper, Cap and Bells, Blues, Dublin, Cri
terion, Â¦Â¦: Demurrer, Far Rockaway, All
Green . and Bonnibert give good promise.
In the all-aged division are such as Kin
ley Mack, Ildrim,- Star Bright, Voter/Un

ready early. Several fairly good young
sters have been shown at ; Washington
and more will appear before many days,

STANFORD TEITHTS MEW !
: PI/AY LOCAL CRACKS
The doubles tryout held at Stanford
Saturday .morning .resulted in a victory
for Harry "WIehe and S. H. Adams, as was
expected. Four teams enteredâ Wiehe
and Adams, R. L. Leib and George Gage,
H. Boyle and 1 Holbrook and F. ' A. Leib
and Baker. Tho first match was between
Gage and Roy Leib and Boyle and Hol
brook and was won handily by the former.
The score was 6â2," 7â 5. The next match
was the match of the day, in which
Wiehe and Adams Â¦were pitted â¢ against
Frank A. Leib and Baker. The former
won the first set easily, G-t-2, and with a
lead of 5â2 against them they pulled the
second set up to 4â5, but lost It, 6â4. The
pace began to ' tell on Leib and Baker,
and the ponies won the final set easily,
&â 3. The complete score was 6â2, 4â6,
6-3. . ' . . - â¢
The final match was between Wiehe and
Adams and Gage and R. Leib. At no stage
of the a|ime were the latter in- the con
test. The score, in favor of Wiehe and
Adams, : was 6-r2, 6â2. These two clever
players will represent their college , in
doubles next Saturday. Â¦
In a match Friday at Stanford Grant
Smith of the California Club and William
Roth of Stanford defeated Wiehe and Ad
ams, the Stanford doubles team, three
sets out of four, the. score. being 7â5, 1â6,
6 â 4, 6-r4. . This was a great surprise, -as
Roth and Smith had never played to
gether before. . The pony team was In-poor
form, and will have to put in a lot of
practice next week to get into their best
form. In this match Roth, the other,
Stanford man, -played a very good game,
and will undoubtedly be at his best by
next Saturday. .
The Olympic Wheelmen's race was a
sealed handicai) at ten miles, and the re
sults of the ride were not made public,
as it is so near the time of the relay that
the members of the racing- committee do
not wish 'the other clubs to know just
what the Olympic riders are doing. It
was given out, however, that John Hob
son made the best time, and that he cov
ered the course in something over 25 min
utes. ' :
Â¦Â¦ The annual meeting of the California
Cyclists' Association will be held to-mor
row nicht at the Olympic Club at 8
o'clock,-.
The Bay City and Olympic clubs will
both hold ten-mile events next Sunday
and the Sunday after, after which their
respective captains will be ready to choose
the men to constitute their relay teams.

"They came full of rejoicing and su
preme gladness sat in their hearts and
victory shone upon them in their first en
counters; then as they were about to leave
the country they met with disaster after
disaster and returned whence they came
full of sadness and gloom."
That is what happened to the Los An
geles nine. They are not Sabbath per
formers. On Thursday. Friday and Sat
urday they know how to win, but when
it comes to a Sunday game, even an um
pire who presents them three runs cannot
pull them, out of the tire. .
San Francisco won the morning^ game,
played yesterday at Oakland, and the aft
ernoon game, played" at Kecreation
grounds. There was enough in the mati
nee to souse the soul ot the fanaticus
maximus with all kinds of baseball rervor.
Jack O'Connell gave a decision that was
altogether badâ very much unlike himself
â ai.d which for a time seemed to maice
Los Angeles the ultimate winner; the
score oscillated lrom one side to another
and the final result was always In chan
cery. These elements added to a big, ulu
lating crowd, sidelight incidentsâ the play
ing of a hose on a crowded roof overlook
ing the groundsâ perfect weather and
gingery play were the Joy producers for
the spectators.
Oscar Jones wound himself up and then
unwound on the Los Angeles slab. The
local team found no difficulty in connect
ing with his curves, but only nine efforts
prcduced safe hits, most of the stick per
formers finding an end in the field pockets
of the Orangemen. Jimmie Whalen was
much better. But for a single inning, the
seventh, when .the Angels played the very
devil with Whalen, his pitching was per
fect. In this lachrymoseâ to the locals
inning they mustered five hits, one of
which was a home run by Householder.
One other hit was all that was a-coming
to the visitors throughout the game.
Krug and Hildebrand were the stick
wonders of the game. Krug rolled out a
couple of doubles and a single and Hilde
brand's record shows three singles.
SAN FRANCISCO.
Along in the seventh inning the score
read 3 to 1 in favor of the Wasps. Whalen
had been pitching remarkably steady
baseball. Then Swindells and Bowman
found themselves on the. sacks by good
hitting, but Bowman was very gay at
second and was put out on a sneak by
Hildebrand and a throw by Whalen.
Jones went out. Then came the decision
that made things blue for the crowd.
Brockhoff hit a little to the right side of
first base, but O'Connell said it was fair,
and after that the hitting and the scoring
began. When the Inning ended four
Angels had gone the route and the score
was Los Angeles 5, San Francisco 3.
But the joy for the Orangemen was
short. In the next Inning the locals un
loaded on Jones and made the score what
it was till the end, which in detail is as

MORNING GAME.
San Francisco 4, Los Angeles 2.
The Oakland patrons of the game turned
out in force yesterday morning, and they
were well pleased with the game played
between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Los Angeles made the errors and that -was
what lost the game.
Not until the eighth inning did the
Wasps send a man over the plate. Then
Hale, who, pitched an exceedingly fine
game, was found- for a couple of hits,
whlVh, combined with many Angelic er
rors^ gave San Francisco a victory. A
.couple of errors by Kelly, a halfdose by
Hale and Brockhoff and hits by Holland
and Schwartz were responsible for the
runs made by Nordyke, Fltzpatrick,
Schwartz and Krug.
In this same inning Fitzpatrick was
solved, a base on balls, a two-bagger by
Kelly and a three-bagger by Householder
giving the Angels their only runs. The
score:

Roman Athlete, undoubtedly the glad'
at&r of the Pasha kennel, won the 10S
dog open stake at Union Park yesterday,
beating Frank McComb's Bona Fide for
the last flag: of an event that furnished
g-ood sport for a lars,-e crowd of enthusi
asts.
Beyond being a bit lucky In the semi
final where Wedgewood was his opponent,
the young hound wa.s deservedly tne vic
tor in his trials, sitrons and clever he
made short work of his opponents, despite
the Tact that the talent forced him en the
small figure in the betting: on three occa
sions. Scottish Chief was unable to score
agu!Â»st the Athlete and Mamie Pleasant,
a S to 3 favorite, lost- Dy a point. King
Cotton failed to get a mark on the clever
performer, nor could I'lne Fire, whosj
chances to win were figured at 2-1, do any
better in the next go.
Wedgewood, in making- a heavy drive
got off the game. The Athlete got pos
session and oy clever work kept Wedge
wood from further figurng as a factor.
Three to one were the odds against the
winner.
Luxor, the stake favorite, was put out
in his first course. Ireland, on the short
end at 5 to 1 was one ol the best ahots of
the Oay. The Emerald Isle courser led
Curtis' flyer a length for the turn, plac
ing Mm for a point. Ireland got posse.-.
tiion and followed it out for a clever kill.
Homer Boy reached the semi-ttnal by
good solid work. Thl3 young hound Is an
energetic traveler and before long will
muice the best of them run a bit to keep
within distance.
Bona Fide ran well out wont against a
strong one in the stake winner.
The puppy stake was won bv D. J.
Healey's iZiista. with T. Barre's Amadee 1
as runner up. In the final Amadee led
three quarters of the distance up the field,
but Elista let out, got the turn by two
lengths and won out bv B clear score. Her
performance in thia event places her on
thp list of coming coursers.
The short ends were: Miss Wilson belt
Santonin 6 to 1; Ireland bea.t Luxor 5 to
1; black Head beat Agamemnon. Royal
Union beat Brutus at 3 to 1; War Ea^le
beat Sir Pasha 2 to 1 .and Laurene* at

Narrowly Escapes Asphyxiation.
David Atkinson, a laundryman at the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, at 426 Baker;
street, had a. narrow escape from asphyx
iation Saturday morning. He secured a
room in the Leland House, and In turning
off the gas left the cock half open. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and
restored to consciousness.
Dr. Novy, who attends Hare, wears a
germ-proof rubber garment that covers
him from head to foot, with two little eye
holes for sight, whenever he goes Into
the contagious ward, and he also Injects
preventive doses of serum Into himself.
Dr. Vaughn told the board that Hare
contracted the disease by an accident al
most -identical with that which occurred
In Viena in 1S9S. At that time Professor
Nothajele and his assistant. Barlsh. were
conducting bacteriological experiments on
bubonic plague bacilli. Barlsch caught
the disease and died, as did also Dr. Muel
ler, who attended him. , "
' ANN ARBOR. April 14.â Dr. Victor C.
Vaughn, dean of the medical department,
and one of the most noted bacteriologists
in the country, appeared before the State
Board of Health yesterday and practical
ly acknowledged that the case of Student
Charles B. Hare was one of bubonic
plague. He assured the board that there
would be no spread of the disease, as all
precautions had been taken to prevent It,
and the student would recover.

Rev. Henry "Woods Delivers an Ad
dress in Academy of Sciences
Hall.
Rev. Henry Woods of St. Ignatius Col
lege spoke In Academy of Sciences Hall
last evening on "The Rights and Duties
of Labor According to the Â¦ Catholic
Church."
He said the laboring man has a right to
live, to lead a human and a Christian Ufa
and to lead a Godfearing life. Under
present conditions, he said, all a- laboring
man has time to think of is how. to keep
himself alive, and that many of them do
more than this, he declared, was not due
to their surroundings or the conditions
of their. labor. There should be more In
life, for the laboring man than merely ex
isting, he said, and he had a right to all
the uplifting and refining Influences that
are open to the best.
He believed it was the duty of laboring
men to preserve their own dignity and
the dimity of their labor, and so to live
that they would be worthy the reward of
the rig-hteous. Â¦ â¢ , Â¦

The Berlin Tagreblatt believes that "the
New York movement has entered a crit
ical phase." On the other hand, the Na
tional Zeltung. which takes a different
view, says: "It would be a grave errjj?
tj overlook the fact -that a magniflce- 1
impulse Is throbbing in American . busi
ness life. A crisis cannot soon be ex
pected."
Speculators, however, are ' becoming
skeptical, and Berlin sold 'Americans all
the week, particularly Northern I Pacific.
There Is some apprehension regarding the
American situation. Â¦ The German mar
kets were unfavorably affected by var'
ous factors. . Â¦
The Frankfurter Zeitung also returns t.i
the subject, sugge-ting that New York's
money rate foreshadows a culmination of
the boom^ and adding: "There has been
an excess of. speculation in -New York,
which sooner, or. later must find its cor
rective in a 'corresponding setback."
. "American speculators," says the Vos
sische Zeltung, . "are nossessed with a
degree of overcqnfldence, which is a dan
ger for " all the world. 'Nevertheless,

- When ' her parents were seen to-nlcht
they refused to discuss the matter, or to
say whether they knew of. her where
abouts or not. . '.
But the time came when there was an
epidemic of disappearing hotel cashiers
in Oakland. After the Metropole . cashier
left town with $1,000 the microbe that in
duced this condition found' its way Into
the Raymond Hotel,., and Miss Lucv
Knutzen decided that she was going to
enjoy all of the masculine prerogatives of
the position. She forthwith assumed the
prerogative of disappearing. And one
morning. Miss Lucy. Knutzen coui>- not be
found. She was traced as far as Berke
ley, and there the disappearance became
complete.-
It was found that she had not. only fol
lowed the example of others In aisaDDear
ing, but had copied the masculine method
of taking along. with her the collections of
the hotel â¢ for the month. The exact
amount that she secured in this 'way was
never ascertained, for her parents stood
by her and refused to tell. .The taking of
the money was a serious embarrassment
to her parents, but they said nothing and
made It good to tha guests and trades
people. .
â¢ Where she â¢ went has .- been a comnlete
mystery until she was located in Port
land, Ore., a few days ago. She purchas
ed a Jodging house with the money that
she took with her, and Is r^rv In business
for .herself. .
Miss Lucy Knutzen is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Knutzen. Her father
is the proprietor of the Raymond Hotel
in this city. Miss Knutzen- was a Kreat
help to her parents. She handled all the
cash, receiving the money from the
guests, paying the bills and keeping the
accounts straight. She did this for sev
eral years, during which time the pur
veyors of the hotel learned that "the bux
om blond little lady knew just what
should be paid, and there was no use add
ing a few cents a pound to any com
modity: while , the guests learned that,
long standing accounts were not in favor
with the cashier. â¢ ;
Miss Lucy Knutzen Is running a lodging
house in Portland, Or., after having kept
her parents In Ignorance as to her where
abouts for exactly two months. In fact
her parents are not yet aware of her lo
cation, for since the fourteenth day of
February they have not heard a word
from their missing daughter, and the
nearest they have been able to guess at
her whereabouts Is that she "might have
gone to Los Angeles on a "visit." The
Call published the story of her leaving
home and parents and boarders who had
paid her for board due her parents, and
It is now able to publish the news of her
present whereabouts. -.

At 3 o'clock of the day on which Cor
delia Baxter becamo the bride of Hugh
Tevis I saw her in a Kearny-street store,
lost to all things except golf vests, which
Fho was busily selecting. Her selections
made, she had them fitted, and even that
trying process did not disturb her. It was
â¢fully 5 o'clock on that auspicious day be
fore she finished her shopping. However,
she fa.ced the clergyman to the minute set
In spito of her trials of the afternoon, and
a handsomer bride I never looked upon.
Charlotte Cunningham, nowever, sur
passed anything from a standpoint of
cool self-possession I ever expect to see.
A bunch of girls went up to see her dress
they were the girls that had worked on
that marvelous gown of hersâ and she
kept them staring at her all through, that
trying process, wondering what marvelous
thing she would do next She thought of
everybody but herself, and she was giving
orders for their benefit while her veil was
being adjusted. First she saw that each
and every one of those girls was provided
with a box of wedding cake. Then she
sent the girls who had decorated the home
downstairs to supper. Next she had her
mother pass in critical review before her
and complimented her on the beauty of
her gown. Finally she went downstairs,
passed through the flower-adorned rooms,
gave vent to many delighted "Ohs" and
"Ahs" and was driven to the church.
The nervous bride is a thing of the past.
She may have existed in the time of our
grandmothers, even, if you will, of our
mothers, but to-day there Is no longer
such a thing. The nervous bride went out
.Â¦with the promise to obey,' which almost
every clergyman has cut out of the mar
riage ceremony^ I knew of the passing
of the girl who trembled and blushed and
went into hiding on her wedding day, but
in spite of . my modern education I must
confess that I was. hardly prepared for
the wonderful coolness of the two most
charming brides of the weekâ Cordelia
Baxter, now Mrs. Hugh Tevis, and Char
lotte Cunningham, now Mrs. Percy Kess
ler.
Alice was the first one of the Tevises to
fall in love with Cordelia Baxter. She
met her down at Monterey and conceived
a violent attachment ; for the "pretty
lady." It was little Alice who first called
Mr. Tevis' attention > to the lady who Is
now his wife.
No matter what the grown people think
about Mrs. Tevis. she has one little girl
admirer, who boldly declares that "she is
the prettiest lady in. all the world." This
enthusiast is no less a personage than lit
tle Alice Tevis, Hugh Tevis' eight-year
old daughter.
""She comes upon you," said. one of the
most decided pros, "and. takes your
breath awny, but she won't bear critical
inspection." . . .
With all these pros and .cons no one,
however, has ccme forward to declare
that Mrs. Tevis is not beautiful. They
(the pros) only object to the term, "a
beauty." ;'.' â¢
NEVER saw people so divided as upon
the delicate question of Mrs. Hugh
Tevis' beauty. I have heard people
go into ecstasies over her, an,d then'
again I have heard others declare that
there were dozens of girls In this city
many times more beautiful.
' I den't propose to set myself up as a
critic on that most difficult of all sub
jectsâfeminine beauty. I only say that
I would not call Mrs. Tevis a beauty. She
has a wonderful skinâ fair and smooth,
with a delicate peach tint in It that one
looks for only in the skin of a baby. Then
she has a fine pair of eyes, blue as the
heavens, .well pet and wide apart. But
i with them her facial beauty ends.
Stolen Stock Mysteriously Disappears
in Black Hills Country, the Head
quarters of an Organized
Band of Bobbers,
i
LIVERMORE, April H.-Organlzed
bands of cattle thieves, with a rendezvous
in the Black Hills, are raiding among the
ranches of Livermore Valley, driving off
stock with such boldness and cunning
combined as to completely baffle the dep
uty sheriffs hereabouts.
Only once during the past two years
Dave the peace officers been able to find
any clew to the raiders. They did suc
.ceed in landing dne stock thief In the pen
itentiary. Of late the descents of the hit
men upon the valley farms and stock
ranges have been so frequent that the
ranchers are seriously, contemplating the
organization of a vigilance committee to
ferret out- the raiders, and to use every
means, even to shotguns and rifles, to
protect their cattle from these depreda
tions.
The latest theft that has aroused the Ire
of the ranchers was the driving off of
twenty-two head of beef cattfe a few
nights ago from the range of P. Fcbian &
Co., located between Midway and Cwral
Hollow. i
TJie raiders herded the stolen stoct
through the Mulqueeny ranges, cutting
the wire fencing with nippers, and drove
the cattle on to the Johnson ranch.
Whether the thieves became alarmed, be
lieving they were pursued, or from some
other cause, they abandoned a portion of
the herd there and continued on the drive
with ten head, of which two were owned
by the Mulqueeny estate.
The cattlemen made their way across
the range into San Joaquln County. They
traveled for a portion of the route on the
county road, but after getting into the
mountains all trace of the cattle and the
thieves was lost.
The> Fabian steers were all branded and
can be easily identified if they have not
already been slaughtered. The ranchers
are much excited over the theft and have
offered a reward of $100 for the arrest and
conviction of the thieves.

Dean and Every Member , of th?
Faculty of the School of Peda
gogy Will Quit the
Institution.
NEW YORK, ADril 14.â The resigna
tions of the dean and every member of
the faculty of the school of pedagogy of
the New York University ' have been
placed in the hands of Dr. Henry Mac-
Cracken, chancellor of the university.
Three of the retiring professors are
practically in open revolt against. the uni
versity authorities, and, emulating the
example of certain professors who were
recently forced out of the Leland Stan
ford University of California, they have
appealed their case to the public through
the medium of a signed statement issued
to-day to the newspapers.
In this statement it is hinted that the
activity of the woman's advisory commit
tee, an organization of women of high at
tainments devoted to the interests of the
university, has been Instrumental in
bringing the revolt to a crisis. Miss Helen
Gould, Mrs. Henry Draper and Mrs. Eu
gene Smith are the members of this com
mittee. Chancellor MacCracken admitted
that these women had not been entirely
satisfied with the edification they derived
from attendance at certain of the pro
fessors' lectures, and had not hesitated to
voice their disappointment.
There have been long-continued disa
greements within the faculty of pedagogy
on points of general policy.

REVOLT AGAINST
COLLEGE POLICY
NEW YORK. April H.-For, the fir^t
time since they were oisanizsd the prin
cipal trades unions in this city decided to
day to so Into politics and to start an
independent labor party. This decisicn
was reached at a meeting of delegates
from twenty- one unions represented >n
the board of walking .iclogp/.es. held this
afternoon. Philip Wienf:emer of the Amal
gamated Society of numbers and Gas
litters presided.
The meeting was called en account cf
the recent decisions of the Court of Ap
peals declaring: the prevailing rate of
wages law and the Stat e stone dressln,;
law unconstitutional. The laws, the most
radical of their kind that have yet been
passed in the interest of labor, cost the
labor unions Biany thousands of dollars in
carrying on the agitation in their favor,
and their annulment Is admitted to be a
severe blow to labor. Those who con
ducted the agitation now say that the
city officials who were supposed to be
most friendly to labor did not stand by
the labor unions as they were expected
to do. and that their professions of friend
ship were not carried out in practice.
Annullment by Court of Appsals of
Laws Costing" Large Sums to
Agitate Causs of the
Step.

Off"Pop"Lenhardt.
Suns Him Bound a Circle Until He
Ducks, and Then Friends
Holl Him in the
Sand.
As the landlord was the r.oicier the spec
tators took up his case first, and while
the machine cavorted around the road
like a dissatisfied bonfire, tJ^ey rolled him
off the road and into p sand bank like a
harrel. and there they proceeded to
bury him. They put him out before he
had* lost more thin one layer of clothing
p.nd after the interment had proceeded
far enough to becom-e serious. But the
automibbiic had looked cut for Its owa
fire. It was still reeling around spitting
sparks and some one *elÂ»phoned to a spe
cialist to come out and talk to it and qul*t
it. but before one could get there the ma
chine had finished evcryth!ng burnable
about itself and was rapM'y accumulating
a little heap of ashes with spokes and
nxies on the side. When its owner reached
the Casino there was nothing left but a
Flrong smell of burning paint and gasoline
and there was nothing heard but Len
harfit, who in an inner room was still
enmrpenting on fiery untamed automo
biles quite as warmly as the occasion de
manded.
There was no stopping either of them,
r.nd on the thitd lap the machine over
hauled thÂ» stout landlord and fouled him.
If it had stopped there it would have been
all right, but <t didn't; it went on over
him, and when it l.ad passed it was found
that Lenhardt had caught the infection
and the fire was burning lustily on his
clothes without the aid of gasoline.
While they were in the Casino the ma
chine became overcome with the fumes of
its gasoline and set fire to itself. Mein
Host Lenhardt was the first to scent the
danger and the burning gasoline. He
rushed through his doorway, sounding the
alarm as he went, and proceeded to elect
himself chief of an amateur fire depart
ment. He and the two ch.iffeurs pranced
:iround the th'.ng until some one mon
keyed with the starting handle, and with
a "snort the machine started across the
road after the rotund boniface. The
Fteeriner handle was eet for a circle about
Â¦the width of the road, and around this
circle the machine chased the perspiring
I-onhardt. who had forgotten the way in
through the door of his house and thought
of nothing but the animated bunch of fire
that wanted to get at him.
They reached the park in safety and in
pood time, and feeling that they needed
some stimulant after the run they turned
out of the park and drew up in front of
Lenhardts place. It was Floyd's deci
sion that the thing did not need to be
hitched, so they left it to itself while they
went Inside.
The machine belonged to Miles Baird.
He did not Intend to use it Saturday even
ing, so John Floyd, a colored boy, who
works for Baird's mother, and a friend
named Clifford Middlemlss. decided they
would take the thing out and give It some
exercise to keep spavins out of its bear
ings. Middlemiss is a stable boy in
"Welsh's stable, and while the horseless
article was not quite in his line, still his
experience was of some value and Floyd
felt safer with him alon^.
There were n!ia times around 'Top"
Ler.hardfs Park Casino Saturday night,
caused by the eccentricities of an auto
mobile that had discharged its passengers
iind got control of itself. Had it been
honestly on the road it might have be
haved better, but it had been tooled away
without the consent of its owner and was
therefore somewhat irresponsible.

Montezuma Copper and CoaL
Has it ever occurred to the reader of theÂ«Â»
advertisements that the Montezuma Mining Co.
lias by reason of its new coal leases, an lm-
ir.ense advantage over any other mining com-
pany -less favorably situated? Such is the fact.
The Montezuma Company will mine Its own
coal make its own coke and burn that coke in
Its own smelter, thus reducing operating ex-
penses to the minimum. At the same time it
Â¦will escape the probable exactions of the smelt-
"The Montezuma Mining Co. Is selling stock
to continue development on Its 24 copper prop-
erties and to build a smelter on Its own lands.
Over 40 men are working on the copper and
coal properties.
If you don't know it now you will one day
awake to a realization of the fact that "Cop-
per is King," and that the Montezuma Is in
1 a position to richly reward for a lifetime the
holders of its stock. We have in our office the
copper ores, the coal, the coke- and printed
matter containing valuable information.
Our special excursion for Tacoma and Seattle-
will leave San Francisco Juna 15. Send for
excursion folder.
For a short time the stock is offered at loo
per share cash or 12c per share on Installments.
Any amount will be sold for cash, but not less
than 500 shares on the installment plan. In-
stallment termsâ 500 shares, $6 down and {3
monthly: 1000 shares. $10 down and $10 monthly:
larger quantities at proportionate prices: 3000
shares. $50 down and $12 monthly, including
free round-trip excursion ticket.
Did vou ever before hear of a mining com-
pany that was willing and anxious to show it*
properties to its shareholders, big and little,
and would pay the expenses of a trip to thÂ»
mines? That's what the Montezuma will do.

minder of a fit of ungovernable rage to
which her husband gave way early Sat-'
urday morning at their home at 3(J9 Third
street. That" the life of the child was not
extinguished outright was due to the ef
forts of the mother, who, forgetting her
own pain, fought the flames that were
eating the tender flesh of her youngest
born, while neighbors struggled with the
brutal husband to prevent him doing fur

Manning went to his home early yester

I James P. ; Cummins, ased 21 years, living
at 146 Fulton street, is among the missing
and his relatives fear that he has com
mitted suici.de. .
Cummins was interested with Charles
Agner in a photograph gallery at 3 Taylor
street. He has been suffering with heart
failure and frequently spoke of ending his
trouble in the waters of the bay.
Last Wednesday Cummins left a note
addressed to his partner saying that he
was tired of living and intended to do
away with himself. Â¦
"If I don't see you any more," he wrote,
the mule is yours." -, â¢
The "mule," his friends think, referred
to the photograph gallery.- Last "Wednes
day Cummins left his home and went di
rectly to his place of business. After writ-
Ing the note to Agn^r he mounted 1 is
bicycle, telling one of the employes that
he intended to ride to Golden Gate Park.
Since then he has not been seen. Tha
relatives believe that after leaving j tho
gallery he rode to the water front and
threw himself Into the bay. The â¢ police
are endeavorlns to locate the wheel, in
the hope of finding some trace of the miss
ing man."
Cummins is about 5 feet 5W inches in
height and weighs about 140 pounds. He
was dressed in a dark serge suit, black
derby hat, and a white soft shirt. He has
brown hair and when last seen- wore a
light brown mustache. Captain Seymour
and his men' are working on the case.

French Firm Fails in Mexico.
MEXICO CITY, April 14.â The failure of
D. Olivier & Co., large French dry goods
merchants here, is partly due to the
money stringency. The firm was engaged
also in cotton manufacturing. The lia
bilities are said to be between $500,000 and
$900.000,. Bankers say the concern will
probably be able to pay 90 cents on the
dollar. The principal creditors are the
National Bank of Mexico, the Bank of
London and Mexico, the Central Bank of
the State of Mexico and the City' of Lon
don and a large dry goods house.

A reward of $100 for the arrest and con
viction of the thief. or thieves who broke
into showcases at the Park Museum and
extracted their contents has been offered
by the Board : of Park Commissioners.
Though. the detectives have been busy on
the' case since its discovery on Friday, as
yet no â¢ clew to the perpetrators of the
crime has fceen discovered. A close watch
will be kept on the cases hereafter, and
hence It is not likely that the thieves will
again attempt to ply their trade at the
museum.
The fact that the sun shone brightly In
the downtown districts â¢ deluded large
crowds into the belief that it was pleas
ant at the park and beach. It was foggy
and cold, however, at the city's pleasure
places, and hence the crowds did not re
main long out in the open.
La Lesta, the fire aueen; Barnes* dog,
pony and monkey show and Leah May,
the giantess,, are the attractions at the
Chutes this week. A large crowd enjoyed
these and the other features yesterday.

It was shown to him.
"I don't remember any such occur
rence," said Schmidt at the prison. "I
was out drinking all dav yesterday and if
I went to the house this morning I don't
know how I got there. I never had a row
with Mrs. Drasdo. My relations with her
had been friendly until recently, when,
owing to a quarrel, I left the bakery she
owns. Last night I drank too much.'
I cannot stand much drink, anyway.

no reason to harm her. They say I had a

matter."
Schmidt claims that his parents live
at Lorin station, Berkeley, and that
he is separated from his wife. Until a
month ago he roomed at a lodging: house
on ; Third street and- recently sljared. a
room with a friend at a lodging house on

Schmidt was taken to the City prison at
the Hall of Justice, where he was violent
and profane. He was booked on charges
of making threats against life, exhibiting
a deadly weapon in a. threatening manner
and also for disturbing the peace, bail be
ing fixed by Judge Mogan, who was at
the hall, in the sum of $5000.
The revolver, which Miss Petersen and
another woman in the house claimed io
have seen in Schmidt's hand, could not be
found by Officer Robl when he searched
the premises.
Miss Petersen stated yesterday that
Schmidt had formerly worked for her
aunt. Mrs. Drasdo. in'the bakery, and that
she had discharged him a month ago for
insulting her. â¢ -' .

STILL LAUGHING
AT FATHER TIME
Uncle George Bromley Cele
brates His Eighty-Fourth
Birthday.
Yesterday was the eighty-fourth anni
versary of the birth of Uncle George
Bromley, and, as has been, the custom for
years back, he was given an anniversary
breakfast at the Bohemian Club by
Raphael Weill. Mr. Weill is in France,
but he sent word out here that the break
fast was to go on just the same, and his
brother, Sylvain Weill. represented him
and did the honors. There were twenty
at the table. They sat down at 12 and
did not finish until 3, and in the meantime
what could be said in honor of the guest
was well said and often repeated.
Colonel A. G. Hawes presided, and after
a. few opening remarks he introduced
Uncle George, who told how it feels to
laugh at the passing years and keep
young in defiance of the flight of time.
He expressed his appreciation of the
honor done him, and to prove that years
have nothing to do with age he joined
Sylvain Weill in a verse of the "Mar
seillaise" and drank his own health with
the youngest.
General Barnes also epoke, his theme
being the affection which all who know
him- feel for Uncle George. Horace ;G.
Platt, Al Gerberding, Barton Hill. Gen
eral Lucius H. Foote, Byron Lathrop and
several other* added their word of cheer
and congratulation, and the breakfast
passed with the ease and interest of a
true Bohemian banauet.
Telegrams of congratulation from a
number of friends were received and read
and a double armful of flowers and Â¦ a
basketful I of dainty ', notes from . Uncle
George's feminine admirers helped to
make the occasion the success it .was.
Uncle George was well and gay as a
spring morning. The years have dealt
lightly with him, and no shadows are
gathering in his path. Eighty-four may
be old for some, but not for the stanch old
Bohemian, whose heart is still in the
thirties, a good half-century behind the
rert of him.

T>t. Sulcer of Riverside Speaks. Before
a Great Audience at Metropol
itan Temple.
Abraham A. Siilcer. M.D.. C. B. S.. of
Riverside, delivered an address yesterday
afternoon in Metropolitan Temple under
the auspices of the r lrst Churcn oi Cnnsi,
Scientist. The hall was tilled to the limit
of iis seating capacity. Dr. Sulcer said in
part:
Some of the so-caJled occult forms so vehe
mently denounced by both the church and
physicians, are now reviving the sanction of
the best thinkers. Medical men are. as a rule,
yc-t ignorant of the true healing principle.
So far from using hypnotism as an aid, the
will of the patient should never be surrendered.
It ehould be stimulated. Nothing enervates
the eystem and the mind so much as fetr. We
banish it by charging- the current of thought.
Once conscious of the literal presence of God.
faith in his power gives physical health and
spiritual blessing.
From the beginning: both synagogue and
church have taught that the infinite brought
Into trf-ing- all that Is. Xow is It not a logical
deduction that since God Is Rood there can
be no real evil In the world? It remained
fcr our beloved teacher. Mrs. Eddy, to grasp
the true meaning of the great principle and
to bring it within the understanding of all.
I do not believe In administering drugs, either
In allopathic or in homeopathic doses. The
only true way to f.ght the fire of the devil
is with purest holiness.
WITH a pistol in one hand and
a razor in the other hand,
Louis Schmidt, a baker, cre
ated considerable excitement
yesterday morning at . 11
o'clock in the lodging house, 112% Grant
avenue, kept by Mrs. Paul' Drasdo. who
also runs the Vienna bakery in the store
of the building:.
Schmidt, who was under the Influence of
drink, accosted Miss Minnie Petersen,
niece of Mrs. Drasdo. as the your.g
â¢woman was coming along- a hallway from
her room. Pointing the revolver at Miss \
Petersen and wildly waving the open
razor, Schmidt shouted to the affrighted
woman: "Stop where you are. If you
move a step I will blow your brains out."
Miss Petersen, who knows , Schmidt,
begged the man not to harm her, as she
had never done him any wrong. She par
leyed with him for a few minutes and
when some of the lodcers â¢â¢ in Â¦ the house
came upon the scene, the youne woman
rushed into the room of R. Schrensky,
who keeps a saloon on Market street.
Miss Petersen told Schrensky what had
happened and he hid her in a clothes
closet and then opened the window to
call for assistance. The sound of Schren
sky's police' whistle attracted Officer F.
W. Robl, who rushed to the house. Gotns
up stairs, Robl met Schmidt, who still
had the razor in his hand.
The officer grappled with Schmidt, dls-
After nearly twenty consecutive years
of service as grand secretary of. the Na
tive Sons of the Golden West, Henry Lun
eteot, at the meeting of the Grand Parlor
at Santa Barbara next week, will have to
contest with a rival, who promises to give
him a battle royal for that position.
S. A. D. Jones, formerly a life insurance
agent in Los Angeles, has entered the con
test for the grand secretaryship. He has
been elected as a delegate from Pacific
Parlor of this city, after having served
a term as an officer of Ramona Parlor of
Los Angeles, of which he is a past presi
dent. He is also a member or' the Past
Presidents' Association, composed of the
ex-dignitaries of the order.
Sacredly upholding the traditions of
the order, Jhe Native Sons have decided
that no parlor shall have more than on-:
office. Pacific had two candidates re
grand officers, and the members say thut
Jones sadly disavowed any intention of
being- a. candidate. Soon after his' elec
tion as a delegate he announced his In
tention of entering the field as a candi
date for the grand secretaryship. An
other member of the parlor had prc^Iou:?-
Iy declared his intention of becoming a
candidate for grand trustee.
Politics are booming amonsr the dele
pates to the Santa Barbara convention,
nearly S00 delegates from the various par
lors throughout the State are accredited.
As to the fight for the other offices, the
regular procedure will In all likelihood
obtain. But over the secretaryship,
â¢which, includes a comfortable salary. th<Â»
contest is waxing- warm.
