The police expect serious trouble
Â¦with the striking teamsters when the
trucks and teams attempt to leave the
barns this morning. At 2:30 a. m.
a large number of patrolmen were,
called in off their beats and sent to
the barns as a precautionary measure.
BETWEEN lockouts by employers
and knockouts by policemen, a
busy day was spent by many
strikers. The ominous looking
riot club of the police officer,
stripped of its red-corded trim
mings so effective on parade, was
conspicuously carried In plain
sight and it frequently descended
upon the head of him who refused to
move on. Sometimes the crowd was sur
ly, but one or two cracks on the head suf
ficed to disperse the gathering crowd.
Street cars were stopped, stones were
hurled, ropes on loads were cut, nats
were unscrewed from - wheels and every
ingenious method to annoy the drivers of
recognized non-union teams was utilized.
In some cases the mischief: -was done- by

during the day, the result of disabled
trucks that broke down on the tracks.
Changes came thick and fast during the
day. The first was the lookout of the
boxmakers, some 500 in number, followed
a few hours later by a lock-out of the
beer bottlers. The packers, porters and
warehousemen seemed to fear a similar
fate, but no general lookout was an
nounced. The brewery workmen, who re
cently secured a concession on the part,
of the employers, fear similar action on
the part of the Brewers' Protective Asso
ciation.
Efforts to arrange a meeting between
the employes of tHe Union Iron "Works
and President Henry T. Scott were not
completed yesterday, but it'is expected
that the meeting will be held to-day. Two
o'clock is the hour set, and the men who
will compose the committee from the shop
have been carefully drawn.
The iron-molders will hold a special
meeting this morning at 10:30 o'clock to
take action regarding some important de
velopments of the last few days.
A mass meeting under the auspices of
the Federation of Improvement Clubs 13
to be held and Mayor Phelan Is to be
asked to name a committee of 100 to In
sure the success of the proposed meeting.
As soon as he can be communicated with
and a date selected a hall will be en
gaged, unless conditions change for the
better.
But little change was observable yes
terday In the conditions affecting the
lockout and strike of the teamsters. A
larger number of non-union men were em
ployed and worked under the escort of
police. Many are coming from Interior
points, attracted by the large wages now
being offered.
Business Agent Casey and Secretary
McLaughlin of the Brotherhood of Team
sters were not around headquarters all
day. It was said they were endeavoring
not to patronize the plaintiff, were carried to
and fro In front ' of plaintiff s restaurants. The
defendants deny that any acts committed as
above stated were accompanied by any element
of violence, fraud,"' misrepresentation, intimi
dation or threat of any unlawful act whatever,
or that they, were done in pursuance of any
conspiracy to coerce plaintiff to subject his
business to their control. As. to the latter
point. : I â¢ think the only proper Inference from
the papers before the court is that such acts
as appear to have been committed were com
mitted pursuant to a common understanding
of the defendants and with their sanction and
consent. ." '
On these facts various legal questions arise.
The court Is asked to issue an Injunction re
straining the defendants from the further com
mission of acts which are resulting In damage
to plaintiff's business. The affidavits raise an
issue as to the â¢ Insolvency of the defendants.
Despite this I have no doubt that, so far as the
acts complained of are unlawful. Injunction is
the proper remedy. The suggestion that the
injury complained of is not irreparable has
some force In the present state of the record,
but the jurisdiction of equity to enjoin a
threatened wrong In order to avoid a multi
plicity of actions Is well established, and finds
an appropriate exercise In cases of this char
acter.
, Nor is it . any objection to the is
suance of the writ that some of the
acts complained of are criminal of
fenses. , . . - "
Complain of Unlawful Acts.
Assuming, then, that the acts of the defend
ants, so far as they are unlawful, may be. en
joined, we are met by the question, how far. If
at all, are the acts complained of unlawful?
Struggles between employers and employes
have In recent years given rise to a considerable
number of decisions by English and American
courts, and, while there is a great divergence
of authority on some of the questions involved,
I take it that others are settled beyond the
possibility of dispute. Thus (leaving out of
consideration any question of breach of con
tract). It Is clear .that an employe' may with
draw from his employment whenever he may be
dissatisfied with the remuneration or other con
ditions of his employment; and that a combi
nation Of' employea to so withdraw is equally
permissible. (Arthur vs. Oates, 63 Fed. Rep.
310. Allen vs. Flood. 1S98, App.Cas. 1.-.129 1 .)
.'On' the other hand, there' can be no doubt
(and; Indeed, It is conceded by. counsel for de
fendants)-' that it j is an actionable y wrong , for
persons by | means of violence," threats of vio
lence, intimidation or defamatory statements
George Renner, secretary of the Dray
men's Association, In speaking of the
conference proposed by the Municipal
League, stated yesterday that his asso
ciation was perfectly willing and even
anxious to treat with the men themselves,
but that it would never consent to treat
with the leaders or with the paid agi
tators. He declared that the teamsters
who wanted to come hack to their work
could . do so at the same schedule of
wages that was paid before the trouble,
provided that each was willing to obey
orders. He stated that the employers
cared not whether the men were union or
to effect some kind of a settlement, but
that their efforts were futile.
REGARDING the decision handed flown by Jndtje Sloss, At
' tome-y H. "W. Hntton, representing the defendant labor
unions;, raid:
"The decision simply restrains the unions from doing:
thing:* -which I claim they have not done. As I read the
decision! it does not restrain the . unions from 'pickctlnsr.' The
injunction prohibiting the use of the word 'unfair* does not meet
with my approval. The -word 'unfair* may be slanderous, as the
other side contended. If this is a fact its use should not have
been enjoined, for there is other remedy aealmt one who slan
ders you. I consider the decision a practical victory for the de
fendants, and if I take an appeal It will be only for the par
pose of ascertaining the vlcvra of the Supreme Court upon the
issues involved."

solicited plaintiffs employes to leave 'his em

'defendants caused men to be picketed In front
of plaintiffs restaurants and to march up and
down and call forth In loud and threatening
tones not to patronize plaintiff, that the plain
tiff was unfair and kept an 'unfair house. By
reason of these acts large crowds congregated
in front of plaintiff's places of business and
blocked the . passageways thereto. The defend
ants organized processions of men displaying
transparencies on which were inscribed notices
not to deal with plaintiff; they caused r men
hearing placards (1. e., sandwich-men, so called),
to walk in' front of plaintiff's restaurants, such
placards being Inscribed: "Don't .patronize

"You have been severely criticized of
late for starting to Siboney on the morn

your reason for so doing?"'
"I went to Siboney upon the urgent re

to me, it was incumbent upon me to go
to him rather than him to xne. I chose
a time of day when it seemed the least
likely that Cervera's fleet would come out

until Just before dark, when he -would

"From many sources, admiral, numer

The Secretary added that the court
might commend Rear Admiral Schley and
recommend him for promotion, or it might
find reprehensible conduct on the part of
other officers which would necessitate fur
ther action. .
EXPLAINED BY SAMPSON.
"It Is the legal right of an officer to
know specifically the matters affecting his
conduct which are to be investigated. It
is just that this should be so. not only to
the officer under investigation, but to the
court which is making the Investigation.
In the preparation of a precept the de
partment was careful to avoid anything
that looks like an accusation. It simply
mentioned points which, to use Admiral
Schley's own phrase, "have been matters
under discussion.''*
Legal Bight of an Officer.
"The statements are not presented as
facts," the Secretary went on. "They sim
ply repeat what has been set forth in the
newspapers, and Admiral Schley declares
that he wants a complete investigation.
The precept is in the usual form observed
in the preparation of documents of like
character issued for the guidance of
courts of inquiry.
The Secretary read each specification,
calling attention to the care with which
it had been prepared.
"Even' effort was made," the Secretary
continued, "to make the precept as im
personal as possible."
Secretary Long explained that the word
"disobedience" was used because In his
own message to the Xavy Department
Commodore Schley stated "much to be re-
CTetted, cannot obey orders of depart
ment."
"While the precept does not limit or re
strict the scope of inquiry into the "entire
matter." the court is specifically directed
to submit its conclusions upon ten points.
Supporters of Rear Admiral Schley imme

had. by language employed in the precept,

This precept shows that the court will

Admiral Schley, but also of all other offi
cers who participated In the Santiago

JUDGE M. C. SliOSS of the Superior
Court yesterday rendered Judg
ment against the defendants, In
the action in equity instituted by
Mathias Johnson, restaurant keep
er, against the Hotel and Restaur
ant Employes 1 International Al
liance and the Bartenders' Inter
national League of America. The
effect of the decision is to enjoin
the labor unions from Interfering with
the business of employers.
In his complaint the plaintiff averred
that the defendants had entered
Into a conspiracy to coerce him Into
the subjection of- his- business to
ihe conti'cl of lire â¢ defendants and
for that purpose threatened that unles?
he complied with their demands they
would declare a boycott against him,
would call out all cooks and waiters In
his employ and would permit no union
waiters or cooks to fill the vacancies. '
The threat of the unions was unheeded
and they moved to force compliance with,
their demands. Johnson filed suit In
which he prayed Judgment restraining the
defendant labor organizations from Inter
fering with the conduct of his business.
Bishop. Wheeler & Hoefler appeared for
the plaintiff. The defendants were repre
sented by Attorney H. W. Hutton. The
allegations of the plaintiff were supported
by affidavits. To some of these affidavits
denials were entered by the unions. Argu
ment on the law governing the issues in
volved was ordered by the. court and the
case was submitted.
Yesterday the judgment of the court
was filed, directing that an Injunction Is
sue, "pendente lite," "restraining the de
fendants, their servants, agents and em
ployes from persuading or inducing per
sons in the employ of the plaintiff to leave
his employ, from intimidating by threats,
express or implied, of violence or physi
cal harm to body or property, any person
or persons from entering into the employ
of the plaintiff or from dealing with or
patronizing him; from. preventing or at
tempting to prevent, by the use . of the
word 'unfair* or any other false or de
famatory word or words, statement or
statements, oral or written, any person
from entering into the employ of the
plaintiff or from dealing with or patron
izing him."
Judge SIoss* decision ordering. the Issu
ance of the injunction follows in full:
Charges of the Plaintiff.
The plaintiff above named having- filed a
complaint, the allegations of which will be
summarized hereafter, a Judge of this court
Issued an order on the defendants to chow
cause why an Injunction, pendente lite, should
not Issue as prayed in the complaint. - â¢
The motion for an Injunction Is based on the
verified complaint. The defendants, who have
appeared, who Include all upon whom the order
to show cause has been served, have filed affi
davits in opposition, and plaintiff has presented
reply affidavits.
The substance of the complaint may be stated
as follows: Plaintiff is the proprietor of two
restaurants in the city and county of Ban
Francisco. Some of the defendants are labor
unions or organizatibns, and others are officers
of or persons In sympathy with such organiza
tions. One of the defendant unions Is com
posed of cooks, waiters and bartenders em
ployed In hotels and restaurants. The defend
ants entered Into a conspiracy in order to
coerce plaintiff into the subjection of his busi
ness to the control of the defendants, and for
that purpose stated to him that unless he com
plied with the rules of the Cooks' and Waiters'
Alliance, Local No. 30 (one of the defendants),
they would declare a boycott against him and
would call out all cooks and waiters in his
employ and permit no union waiters or cook*
to enter, his employ. The defendants further
requested plaintiff to sign a certain agreement
with said Cooks' and Walters' Alliance Local
No. 30, providing In substance that plaintiff
I should employ none but members of said union,
that certain hours per day and days per week
should constitute the maximum of work to be
required of plaintiffs' employes and that a cer
tain scale of wages should be paid.
Unions Order the Strike.
Upon plaintiff's refusal to enter Into such
agreement the defendants requested the pa
trons of plaintiff not to deal with him, "falsely
and unlawfully declarins that plaintiff was an
enemy to labor and was unfair and kept unfair
clacM of business." The defendant*, further.

Trades Council announced that there
would be a special meeting of the iron

o'clock this morning. /
Delegate May, from the Journeymen
Butchers' Union, reported that those who
had remained , with the organization
would endeavor to reorganize it thorough

the present. -
From the City Front Federation came
the statement that the executive com
mittee had decided not to engage in any
sympathetic, strike until all peaceful
measures had been exhausted.
The law and legislative committee
called attention to an alleged Violation of
the franchise by the Market-street Rail
way Company in hauling loads of sand
and gravel over its various electric lines
for private, parties. The same committee
reported that the petition to Congress in
reference to the continuance and exten
sion of the Chinese exclusion act was now
ready for distribution.
Secretary Rosenberg on behalf of the
executive committee reported that while
the conditions at present confronting la
bor were very serious, and that many
unions were threatened with lockouts, the
unions did not propose to give up with
out a struggle. â¢ â¢
"By Saturday or Monday, he continued,
"we will know.all about the situation. I
think special meetings of all unions
should be called as occasion demands. If
goods come to vour place of business
under police pn .ectlon, we do not want
you to handle them. The water front
unions are doing everything possible to
preserve the: peace."'
â¢Efforts will be made to ascertain
whether the police now employed are re
ceiving the $2 50 a day which the charter
requires for special work.
Resolutions declaring the action tne
Council will pursue were adopted and Ine
following officers elected:.
.Under the head of reports of unions, the
delegates from the Boxmakers' and Saw
yers' Union reported that their demands
had been, submitted' to the employers on
May 16, to go into effect as soon as they
were granted. They said they were sur
prised when the notices were posted In all
the mills on Thursday night and were in
a quandary to know what to do. It was
decided that the best thing to do was to
let the executive committee handle the
matter. The union will meet to-night .at
B'riai B'rith- Hall.
Although some of the more' ardent
trades union delegates in the San Fran
cisco Labor Council last night were in
favor of calling out every labor union in
the city, in- sympathy with those now
on "strike" or locked out, wiser councils
prevailed. It was decided finally to refer
the troubles 'of each organization to the
executive committee, â¢ which will have
power to direct its affairs and endeavor
to arrange some sort of a settlement. ;

Â£lari<Jer, ( one form of defamation, is defined by
the C*vH Cod* (section 46) as "a false and un
privileged communication other than libel
which tends directly to injure (any person) In
respect to his office, profession, trade or busi
ness, either by Imputing to him general disqual
ification In those respects which -the office or
oÂ»J>er occupation peculiarly require*., or by im
puting something with reference to his office
profession, trade or business that has a nat
ural tendency to lessen Its profit." Can It be
doubted that the statement that a man is "un
fair" and that he keeps an "unfair house"
tends' directly to injure him In his trade or
buKir.ess; that it not only Imputes to him die
qualification of one of the prime requisites of
any business, viz.. honesty, but that its natural
tendency ie to lessen the profit of hia business?
To Ray that a man Is unfair Is substan
tially to accuse him of dishonesty; to say
that he keeps an unfair house is equiva
aient to an assertion that patrons of his house
Â¦Bill be likely to encounter treatment that is
neither fair nor honest. (See Century Diction
ary, tit, "Unfair.") Tbe only justification at
tempted by defendants for the use of the word
Is that plaintiff paid his employes less and
worked them longer than. the defendants think
proper. But I see nothing in this to warrant
the conclusion that plaintiff' Â« conduct was
"unfair." The regulation of wages and condi
tions of labor is a matter of contract between
employer *Â»nd employed. As in other cases,
each party seeks to make the best terms pos
gible for himself. : ' '- Â¦
it is no more "unfair" for an em-
Inder the Civil Code (Sec. 43> â.
*vell as under the common law
every person has the right of pro
tection from defumntion.
Again, I think it is an unlawful act for the
men engaged in this conflict with plaintiff to
u*e as one of their weapons the statement that
plaintiff is "unfair" and that he keeps an "un
fair house."
Unlawful to Say "Unfair."
Tben, as to the allegation that the men walk
ing up and down in front of plaintiff's restau
rants called out to the public in "loud and
threatening tones." Clearly, a request- not to
patronize plaintiff, if such request be^ uttered
in Â«ich manner as to imply a threat of violence
In the Â«vent of non-compliance, is an unlawful
act, giving rise to a cause of action ifdamage
result therefrom. ! It is true that the defendants
deny that any statements or requests were
made in aupht but a quiet and orderly manner
This issue of fact is difficult to determine oii
affidavits. Without determining It at this time
I think the proper course Is to restrain the de
fendants from inducing the public, by threats
express or Implied, not to patronize the plain
tiff, since the plaintiff will suffer more damage'
from a continuance of such methods If they
are permitted and used, than will the defend
ants from the restraint thereof, whether they
have been used or not.
Whatever may be said cf the right of a workv
man. acting Individually, or of a number of
workmen, acting in concert, to leave an em
ployment, and whatever may be the law in
other jurisdictions. I think there can be no
doubt that in this State the section above
quoted applies to the state of facts here pre
sented. The plaintiff and his employes bear the
relation known to the law as that of master
and 6ervant, and one who. though not himself
a servant of plaintiff. Induces his servants to
leave him, violates one of plaintiff's legal
rlehts.
That is an act which, under the law of thl*
State, is an actionable wrong. Section 49 of the
Civil Code of California crovides:
"The riK'Iitu of personal relation
forbid: â¢ â¢ â¢ The abduction- or
enticement of r wife from her hus
band, of a child from a parent or
from a gruardlan entitled to its cus
tody, or of a- servant from his mas
ter."
Wrongs That Are Actionable.
Now, some of the acts alleged by the com
plaint to have been committed by the defend
ants are clearly unlawful in themselves. It Is
ecideat, also, xnat the acts complained of have
resulted in damage to the plaintiff, and that
their further continuance would cause him ad
ditional damage. The commission of such un
lawful acts should,- therefore, be enjoined.
What, then, are the things which are shown to
have been done, and which are, in themselves,
wrongful? In the first place it is alleged that
the defendants^ who do not appear to have been
in plaintiff's employ, induced persons, who were
In fcis em;'lo>. to leave It.
to induce workmen to leave the employ of their
xnasten, or to prevent others from entering such
ercplQj. or to prevent a trader's customers or
prospective customers from dealing with him.
In other Horde, the cue of means,
-Â£t>at are per fee unlawful, for the ac
cuxnplishment of auy purpose that
rrcnults in damage to one, {rives hint
a cause of action ap;ainst the person
or persons committing: the unlawful
act-
As the' court announces in.' the decision
above quoted that it is difficult to deter
mine the issue of facts on affidavits, and
In view of the fact that the defendant
labor unions deny that, they conducted
their boycott against the plaintiff or made
any statements or requests in. aught but
a quiet and orderly manner, Judge Sloss
ordered that. the injunction issue pending
further litigation. The case will now go
to trial on Issues of fact. If from the
evidence the court : determines thai the
defendants did conduct themselves as al
leged by the plaintiff . the injunction will
be made permanent, and .unless overen
thuslasm leads. organized labor to risk the
wrath of the trial court the cry "unfair"
will not again ring In the ears of the
plaintiff's patrons. ... .. ,

An Injunction, pendente lite, will therefore

the sum of $1000, and such Injunction will re
strain the defendants who have appeared, their
agents, servants and employes, from persuad
ing or Inducing persons in the employ of plain
tiff to leave his employ, from intimidating,
by threats, express or Implied, of violence - or
physical harm to body or property, any per
son or persons from entering Into j the employ

Concerning these cases.^ and some others cited

not. In my opinion, reconcilable on principle
with the Mogul Steamship Co. case and other*
of like character, and that I believe the cr.ses

In that view . of the facts the case is not
opposed to the opinions here expressed. ' In
Vegelahn vs. Guntner, . 167 Mass., 92, It was
held that an Injunction ' should Issue against
a patrol of two men maintained in front of
plaintiff's place of business, although the pat
rol was dissociated from threats of phyical In
jury to person or property. Field, C. J., and
Holmes, J., dissented, the latter handing down
a very able opinion which has been heretofore
referred to. ....... . . .
The opinion is brief and regards
the banner as a "standing Â¦ menace
to all who were or wished- to be in
the employment of the plaintiffs. :
A decision similar to the one last cited was
rendered In Barr vs. Essex Trades Council
(N. J.). 30 Atl. Rep., 881. j\
In Massachusetts there have been decisions
on the specific propositions of carrying ban
ners and "picketing." In Sherry vs. Perkins,
147 Mass., 212, It was held that the carrying
of banners requesting persona not to enter
plaintiff's employ should be enjoined.
Such, too, was In re Debs, 158 U. S., 564,
In which the court, speaking through Brewer.
J., says, p. 598: "The scope and purpose of
the bill was only 'to restrain forcible ob
structions of the highways along which Inter
state commerce travels and the malls are car
ried.' " Other cases In the Federal courts, how
ever, go so far as. to enjoin . the so-called
"teoycott," even though free from any violence
or acts which are In themselves violations of
law. See Casey vs. Cln. Typographical Union.
45 Fed. Rep., 135. In Hopkins vs. Oxley Stave
Co., S3 Fed. Rep., 912, the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that an
injunction was properly granted against a
combination to compel a manufacturer to dis
continue tne use of a certain machine by re
questing customers of plaintiff, members of
labor organizations and persons In sympathy
with them, not to"" purchase goods manufac
tured with each machine. The case, was de
cided by a jare majority, Caldwell, J., filing i.n
elaborate and vigorous dissenting opinion.
Debs Case Is Cited.
It ir uot to be denied- that there if a rtrong
line of authorities reaching a different con
clusion on the questions here discussed. A
number of cases In the Federal courts hold
that combinations of workmen for the purpose
of Injuring or stopping the business of a plain
tiff are illegal and should be enjoined. In many
of these cases the strike was accompanied by
circumstances of violence and Intimidation.
Such cases were Old Dominion S. S. Co. vs.
McKenna, 30 Fed. Rep., 48; Thomas vs. Â¦ On.,
N. O. and T. P. Ry. Co., 62 Fed Rep., 803;
Consolidated Steel and Wire Co. vs. --Murray,

If it be true that worklngmen may combine
with a view, among other things, to getting
as much as they can fqr> thelfc*ilabor, just as
"capital may combine; with a -view to getting
the greatest possible return. It must be true
that when combined they have- the. eame lib

One of the eternal conflicts out of
-which life is made up is that be
tween the effort of every man to

and that of society, disguised under
the name of capital, to set his ser

Combination on the one side is pat

the other is the necessary and de

The only question "to be determined here Is
whether or not defendants have a legal right
to do what they are doing; not whether their
acts, viewed on grounds of ethic or propriety,
meet our approval. The struggle going on be
tween plaintiff and defendants is an economic
one. which. In my view, the courts should not
undertake to settle unless one side or the other
resorts to acts which are unlawful. In that
event, those acts, and those only, should be
stopped. As Is said by Holmes, J., In his dis
senting opinion In Vegelahn vs. Gunter, 167
Mass. 92, at p. 108:
In each of these cases the result of the com
bination was to damage the plaintiff's business;
In each the motive of the defendants was to
bring about a result which. In their opinion,
would advance their own Interests. Is not that
what defendants have done here?

But, assuming that all acts done pursuant to

unlawful purpose here? It Is claimed that de
fendants conspired to "coerce plaintiff to sub
ject his business to defendant's control." The

have been the signature by plaintiff of. the form
of â¢gr^ement proposed by the Cooks' and Wait

anything unlawful In proposing this agreement

While it does not follow from these examples
that motive Is immaterial in all cases, the
Supreme Court, -in -Boyson vs. Thorn, seems to
have gone to the length of saying that where
a man -has a right to do an act to the dam
age of another, the. fact that he was actuated
by malice or any other Improper motive can
not convert the lawful act into an unlawful
one.- Such too. Is the decision of the House
of Lords in the recent and much discussed En
glish case of Allen vs. Flood (1838); App. Cas. 1.
where", the defendant, a member of a union of
bollermakers. Â¦ had secured the. discharge of
plaintiffs (shipwrights) by ' their employer by
representing to such employer that if the 1 plain
tiffs were not â¢ discharged the bollermakera

Co:, 13 I>ea '(Tenn:') 507, cited with approval In
Bovson vs. Thorn, the defendant railroad com
pany had maliciously, for the purpose of in
juring the plaintiff In his business, posted no
tices to the effect that any of Its employes
who traded .with plaintiff would be discharged.
This act was held to be within the- rights of
the defendant .and to give no cause of action
to plaintiff. Indeed, the principle that cei tain
acts may be "done, however . harmful they may
be to another and whatever the motive of the
doer, is -a : perfectly familiar one.
It was held that no action lay
against one- who, from -malicious
motives, but .without threats, vio
lence, falsehood or deception, in
duces another to violate, his con
tract with the plaintiff.
And there can be doubt that a man may,
for any proper motive (for example, trade com
petition) advise or request a ! prospective cus
tomer or employe of plaintiff not to enter into
business relations with him. The mere fact
that this advice, or request causes damage to
the plaintiff does not give him a right of ac
tion. -Is the question affected in any *ray by
the motive of the person giving the advice or
making the request? While there is a consid
erable divergence of authority on this point. I
think that, .under the decision of the Supreme
Court in Boyson vs. Thorn. 98 Cal. 578, the law
of this | Stale â¢ must be held to answer this
question '. in Â¦ the negative. In that case the
plaintiffs had been guests at the Palace Hotel
in this city, j The defendant had maliciously,
1. e., for the purpose of annoying- and injur
ing the plaintiffs. Induced the proprietor of
the hotel to eject them. '
Considers Bight of Action.
Â¦ Does the -fact that a defendant commits an
act otherwise lawful, with the Intent to Injure
the plaintiff in the conduct of his business,
render that act unlawful? Any Individual in
the city of San Francisco has a right to pat
ronize Mr. Johnson's restaurant or to refuse
to patronize it as he sees fit. If he decides
not to deal with the plaintiff the plaintiff has
no cause of action against him. It makes no
difference what his motive may be, whether It
be a desire to get cheaper food or a feeling
that he can get better food elsewhere, or a
dislike for the plaintiff, or a desire to injure
the plaintiff. Similarly, any man whom the
plaintiff may desire to employ as a waiter or
a cook has an absolute right j to refuse feuch
employment, be his reason for so doing a good
one or a bad one or no reason at all.
This consideration, however. Is covered by
the injunction which will be granted as here
inbefore stated. It is assumed, further, and
It Is obviously the fact, that' the placards or
banners carried by the "sandwich-men" con
tain no statement which Is not either true,
as a matter of fact, or a mere declaration of
opinion.
The question, then, resolves Itself into one
of requests, verbal or written, by the defend
ants to others not to enter Into business rela
tions n with plaintiff, whether as customers or
as employes. If such requests are unlawful.
It must be because they are made for an Im
proper purposeâ viz., to Injure tha plaintiff or
to compel him to accede to certain demandsâ
or because a number of persons have combined
together to make them or because of the exis
tence of both elementsâ viz., improper motive
and combination. -
Unquestionably the business which
the plaintiff is conducting: is a law
ful and proper one. Unquestionably,
too, he has the rifrht to conduct that
iiusiness as he *eÂ«s. fit. V '
(I do not overlook the fact that
threats may be made without the
use of menacing: words or a show
of force; that a deadly display of
weapons is not essential to intimi
dation.)
Intimidation Without Force.
This brings us to the more difficult question
In the caseâ whether, as contended by plain
tiff, the other acts alleged to have been com
mitted by defendants are wrongful and should
be enjoined, or whether, as defendants Insist,
they have an absolute legal right to perform
the acts In question. That Is to say. should
this court enjoin the defendants from, peace
ably and without violence, Intimidation or
false statements, requesting or persuading per
sons who might deal with plaintiff, not to deal
with him, or persons who might enter Into his
employ, not to accept employment from him;
rrom requesting other labor organizations to
prohibit their members from dealing with
plaintiff, and, more specifically, from "picket
ing" plaintiff's places of business with men
who request the public not to deal with plain
tiff; from causing "sandwich-men" to walk
up and down in front of plaintiff's restaurants
with placards, requesting the public not to
deal with plaintiffâ all of these acts belr.g al
leged to be done in pursuance of a conspiracy
to coerce plaintiff, "to subject his business to
the control of the defendants" ?
It will be observed that all of the acts named
are, In themselves, peaceable and lawful; that
Is to say, they are acts which an Individual,
acting by himself under the Inducement of a
proper motive, might do. It Is assumed lhat
the ptcketera use no threats, no intimidation,
no misrepresentations.
The courts cannot undertake to regulate con
tracts of employment by saying that one scale
of wages and of hours of labor is" right and
another wrong or that one Is fair and another
unfair. In the absence of legislation, I do not
see how any terms that the parties may agree
upon can be denominated "unfair." The use
of this term by defendants and their agents
should, therefore, be enjoined.' '
Â¦With reference to the allegation that the
acts of defendants caused crowds to collect In
front of plaintiff's restaurants and blockade
his passageways, acts having this result are
unlawful and should. If there were any likeli
hood of their continuance, be enjoined. The
complaint and affidavits taken together, how
ever, lead me to believe that a recurrence of
the formation of such crowds is not to be
feared. - â¢ ; . â¢

COURT TAKES A HAND.
State Federation of Labor, representing the
trades unions of the State, which provided that
no court should Issue an injunction in any dis
pute between employer and employe restraining
a trades union or any other combination of In
dividuals from doing that which they would
have a perfect right to do If acting Individually.
The Legislature failed to pass that bill largely
because. as ai>pÂ»ared from the expressions of
the Judlciarj' committees of both houses, there
was a lack -o/. evidence of any marked use of
the writ of injunction in this State. The de
cision of Jurige Sloss will serve at evidence to
a future Legislature of the necessity of -such a
measure. Â» To that extent it may be regarded
as perhaps a not unqualiaed evil.

William Macarthur, editor of the Coast
Seamen's Journal, said:
I t&lnk that Judge Sloss' decision Is In line
tvtth the recent policy inaugurated by the ju
.rflciary of the United States and respective
States to effect the abrogation of the right of
workingmen to organize tor the protection arid

to the precise details of the decision, I am nut
prepared to give an opinion, as I have not yet
had tin*Â« to read and study It carefully, but
as to its effect upon the cooks' and waiters' at

to tblnk that It will be very small either way,
tor the reason that there has crown out of the
experience of the workers in the matter of
government by Injunction a disposition to re

sonal opinion of the Judges rendering them
rather than as an exposition of law which the
Â¦workers are bound to respect. In other words,
â¢ he workers do not believe that the courts in
Issuing injunctions are guided by any law, but
merely by inclination. It may be to some ex
tent by pressure of their surroundings to fur

ticularly when the injunction Is the only means
available for that purpose.

EDITOR MACABTHUR'S VIEWS.
Leaders in the labor struggle freely ex
pressed last night their views of Judge
Sloss" decision.
Ed Rosenberg, secretary of the San
Francisco Labor Council, gave the follow
ing opinion:
As I understand It, thÂ« injunction Issued by
Judg-e Kioss does not restrain the parties en
joined from anything they have been doing, ex
orpUng the u*e of the word "unfair." W'n have
bj- Ued and under Injunction can continue to
ask the jÂ»eople of this city who sympathize
with tne struggle of the cooks and waiters for
one day's reel in seven and ft shorter workday
uot to patronize Johnsons restaurant because
he opposes th* improvement of the cooks' and
waiters' condition. We can place pickets in
front of Johnson's place to inform the public
of this state of affairs. As to the order re
straining us from persuading or inducing per
sons in the employ of plaintiff to leave his em
ploy, that does not <?nter into our acU as far
as Johnson's employes are concerned.
As to the right to ask an employe to quit the
employment of his employer, Judge Sloss. in my
opinion, feas driven a wrong decision and no
doubt mill either dissolve that part, or. If ne
cessary, the case will be carried to a higher
court. S..cticn Â« of the Civil Code, prohibiting
the abdu :t!on or enticement of a .servant from
his master, certainly never was meant to apply
to industital or mercantile calling, only to the
relation of. say, a house servant to hla em
ployer. And even as thus applied the law Is
a relic or' slavery times, and no doubt has been
copied into California statutes by mistake. Jf
ever enforced, t*iis part of the section would
Ions ago bare been repealed. It certainly Is
opposed to all our practice and "thought to send
a person to /ail for aski&g another person to
quit the env,k)y of his employer, eKher to go
to work for; the party making: this request or to
quit for any other reason made apparent to
the employe.

More strikes at the present time are not
desired by the Labor Council, and J. D.
Pierce of the American Federation of -La
bor and the executive committee of the
Labor Council were on hand last night to
dissuade the Porters, Packers and Ware
housemen from taking immediate action.
The members of the executive committee
and Mr. Pierce made strong pleas for the
deferment of action until after the peace
committees have an opportunity to act to
day. Any delay was exceedingly disap
pointing to the majority of the associa
tion, and many of the members made
strong appeals against it. . A resolution,
fcowever, was finally passed putting off
action until Sunday afternoon, when a re
port will be received from the City Front
Federation as to the advisability of a Joint
strike. The resolution carried with it the
proviso that if before Sunday afternoon
conditions had not been bettered the Por
ters, Packers and Warehousemen should
prepare to go on a strike Monday morn

The meeting which was held last night
was called for the purpose of considering
the best policy to pursue in the cases of
merchants who have discharged their
men for refusing to do scab work or
work which was prohibited- to them by
their union rules. The men met with the
purpose of declaring for an Immediate
strike. They feared that if action was
longer delayed the merchants would dis
charge every union man In their employ,
as it has been generally reported that the
merchants intend to take ; such steps.
Their action for the past few days cer

Upon the developments of the situation
within the next twenty-four hours de

Packers' and Warehousemen's Associa

2200 men, will go out. The men are all
prepared and in some cases are even anx

last night at California Hall, on Bush
street, the leaders of the Labor Council
restrained them with difficulty from de
claring an immediate strike. At the most,
action was only postponed until Sunday

The unrest and unnatural tension which
has existed among the porters and pack

strike was greatly increased yesterday
morning, when it was learned that the
Standard Oil Company had discharged
twenty-two of their warehouse men for
refusirg to load and unload trucks driven
by clerks who had replaced the striking
teamsters. One of the wagons which they
were required to load was driven by a
"scab." The feeling of unrest and dis
satisfaction was intensified when it was
ascertained later in the day that the Fed
eral Salt Company had discharged four
men for refusing to load a boat at the
Hathaway wharf in conjunction with
"scab" stevedores. There was a general
walk-out on the schooner, and the vessel
is now tied up at the wharf with half of
the load of salt still on board.

The army of strikers and unemployed
was greatly swelled yesterday morning,
when five of the principal box factories of
the city closed their doors. This action
on the part of the factories was occa
sioned by the teamsters refusing to haul
the goods which' were made by the facto
ries. In. all about 500 .men were thrown
out of "employment.
When the managers of the box factories
found that they could not ship their goods
nor haul lumber from the wharves nor
the mills except under police protection
they held a meeting- and decided to close
down until the adjustment of the present
difficulties. The following mills are in
volved: Hobbs, Wall & Co., Commercial
Box Fictory, Pacific Box Factory, Ameri

When the fruit merchants and cannery
managers learned that the box factories
had closed their doors they were greatly
exercised. They recognize that within a
very few. days they will have to close
their stores an3 canneries if they are not
able to secure boxes. ,The loss to the 500
men who were deprived of their positions
will be slight in comparison to the dam
age that will be done to the commission

it has been estimated that thousands of
dollars' worth of fruit has been diverted
to other markets because of the team

On the third proposition, where the court re
strains as follows: "From preventing or at
tempting to pitevent, by the use of the word
unfair or any other false or defamatory word
or words, statement or statements, oral or
written, any person or person from entering
Into the employ of the plaintiff, or from dealing
with or patronizing plaintiff"â I am convinced
that the court had no right to Issue an injunc
tion restraining you from using the word un
fair, or any other word, but the court has
done so In this case, and It simply means that
in your ilan of action against Mr. Johnson in
the future you must refrain from using the
word "unfair," or any other false or defama
tory statement against him, so long as the in
junction reinains
With that exception, I fall to see anything In
the Injunction to prevent you from proceeding,
in so far as Mr. Johnson Is concerned, as you
have been doing from the early part of May
of the present year.

the labor organizations the right that has Been
denied to them by almost all courts In the East,
namely: The Judge recognizes the right of a
labor organization to persuade a person from
patronizing a third, maliciously or otherwise,
even provided it led to the breaking up of the
employer's business. The only thing that the
court has restrained In this case Is what It sees
fit to term "unlawful means," but as long as
lawful means are used the right is recognized
in the opinion. Tours very truly,

. ."... ; . V. ... Decision. .......
The following communications were
written by H. W. Hutton,- attorney for the
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance: . .' ,
- ' SAN FRANCISCO. July 2Â«. 1901.
Ed Rosenberg Esq.â My Dear Sir: InclosÂ«d
you will find copy of a letter I sent to tie
Cooks' and Walters' Alliance. The Injunction
rendered by Judge Sloss this morning is very
mild compared with the injunctions issued in
the Eastern Â¦ States. â¢ Â¦ -.. ' . , â¢ .
I am convinced that he had no riMt to
Issue an Injunction to stop any one from using
the word "unfair." That Is an expression ot
an opinion, and I have the right to express
my opinion about any one. That Is dangerous
as it stands, but it is not near as dangerous
as the Injunctions that, were Issued by Juage
Sanderson and another by Judse Gart * r *"
the breweries and bakers' strikes of some years
ai The first part of the injunction is 'based upon
the following section of the Civil Code, section
49, subdivision 2, which, reads: .... ty , a
"The rlffhts or â¢ personal relation â¢ forbid tne
abduction or- enticement of a wife from ner
husband, of a child from a parent or from a
guardian entitled to its custody, or of a
servant from his master.". .
The Supreme Court has held that thereis no
distinction - between the word "Â¦arvant and
the word "employe." and I suppose that Judge
Sloss thought that there "was sufficient au-.
thority to warrant him in issuing the injunc
tion as it now stands. ".
On the other part about threats, etc.. that is
somewhat in line with the Eastern Injunctions,
but aÂ« the cooks and waiters never used an>
threats, I fall to;Â«ee how It in any way affects
or how It will In any way prevent them from
pursuing the course that they have previously
pursued aeainst Johnsoj*,' except merely * n
the use of the word "unfair." .
I would suggest one thing; that is it mlgnt
be well to ftnd out how the Supreme Court of
this State stands upon the proposition. This
injunction can be appealed from. There -u
nothing to ston an appeal being taken torth
with and having the matter authoritatively
decided. In the meantime the cooks and wait
ers can proceed as they have always done ;
leaving out the use of the word "unfair.
Yours very truly. Â¦ H. W. HUTOON.
P. S.â I will add that I am convinced that on
the comnlalnt as It stands and the affidavits
proposed thereto no Injunction should have
been Issued at all. but aa far as the present
case goes, to wit, as it does not affect the
Cooks' Â»nd Walters' Alliance except In the u<?Â«
of the word "unfair," I am glad It is no
worse.- Tours very truly. HUTTO K.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 26, 1901.
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance No. 30âGentle
men: In the case of Johnson vs. yourself and
others Judge Vgioss this morning rendered an
opinion, as follows: '
"An injunction pendente lite will therefore
issue upon plaintiff filing an undertaking In tne
sum of $1000, and such Injunction will restrain
the" defendants who have appeared, tneir
agents, servants and employes from persuading
or Inducing persons in the employ of plaintiff
to leave- his employ, from Intimidating t>y
threats, express or Implied, of violence or phys
ical harm to body or property, any person or
persons from entering Into the employ of the
plaintiff or. from dealing with or patronizing
plaintiff, from preventing or attempting to pre
vent by the use. of the word unfair or any
other false or defamatory word or words, state
ment or statements, oral or written, any per
son or persons from entering Into the employ
of the plaintiff or from dealing with or patron
izing plaintiff." â _.-Â»."Â¦
While I ani of the opinion that a.' court nas
no right to restrain a third' party from peace
ably asking the employes of another to quit,
still it does not affect you, as you have not
been doing that, and never desired to do that.
On the second proposition the court restrains
you as follows: "From Intimidating by
threats, express or Implied, of violence or phys
ical harm, to body or property, any person or
persons, from entering Into the employ of the
plaintiff, or from dealing with or patronizing
plaintiff"â that Is a thing you never have done,
or never claimed to do, consequently that part
of It does not affect you In any way.

About one hundred men are affected by
this order. The beer bottling establish
ments are separate from the breweries ex
cept in one instance, and in this place no
notice was posted. This establishment em
ploys about twenty-five men. A meeting
of the" executive council of the Brewery
Workmen's Union was held last night,
and it was decided that all the men should
return to work In the morning. II tney
were asked whether they were union men
they were instructed to answer in the al
firmative. If they were asked further to
obey the instructions contained in the
circular letter of their employers they
were instructed to refuse employment un
der any other conditions than those em
bodied in the agreement signed last week.
This movement is said to foreshadow a
similar movement on the part of the other
branches of the brewery business, and In
dicates the course that will be pursued. It
is expected that the notices to the other
branches of the trade will be posted as
soon as the effect on the beer bottlers Is
ascertained.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUI/T 2T. 1901.
All day yesterday the police officers in
the business districts, about the wharves,
the railroad sheds and the southern por
tion of the city where'the majority of the
stables of the leading draying firms are
located had a busy time of It. Mounted
on horses, riding on express wagons,
drays and trucks, with riot clubs plainly
in view, they spent the day in protecting
property in transit or dispersing gather
ing crowds. Â¦
One of the favorite tricks of the locked
out teamsters or their sympathizers Is to
unscrew the nuts of wagons ajid drays.
In many instances wheels dropped off
at the most inopportune time. At Fourth
and Harrison streets early yesterday
morning an accident of this kind occur
red. A police officer was on the seat and
was nearly thrown into the street. As
the street cars were stopped a grea..
crowd gathered and in a few minutes the
street was crowded with people. It was
not until additional reinforcements were
received that tarfflc could be resumed.
Later in the day similar .accidents oc
curred at Fifth and Bryant. Sixth "and
Bluxome streets and many other points.
About 5 o'clock, while one of the Stet
son-Renner Draying Company's teams
was returning to the barn on Fifth street,
near Harrison, just as it was turning out
of the track to go in the hind wheel came
off. A large crowd was gathered along
the sidewalk and Sergeant Bush charged
them single ha#ded. With his club swing
ing without regard to age or sex. he
struck one woman a glancing blow on the
shoulder. She fell to the ground, but wai
picked up by some companions and hur
ried away. Any one who refused to move
on felt the force of a police officer's club.
Mounted officers rode down the side
walk, scattering every crowd that col
lected. The same plan was pursued on
other streets where the teamsters, have
been in the habit of congregating. No
one was allowed to stand about the cor
ners of any of the streets. Captain Witt
man sent a large force of officers Into
the district and will have all his force on
hand to-day. - _ .
Paul Caraffa, a helper for James Kossi
ter & Co., draymen, was assaulted by
striking teamsters last evening at Rlncon.
and Harrison streets and rendered uncon
scious. - ,. - Â¦
Harry Rossiter was driving one of the
trucks under police protection and
Caraffa was on the vehicle. At First and
Bryant streets the pole of the truck broke
and Rossiter sent Caraffa with a pair of
the horses to the stables. A crowd of
striking teamsters followed Caraffa and
made an attack upon him. He was bru
tally beaten and left unconscious m the
middle of the car track and narrowly es
caped being run over by an electric car.
The traces of the horses In Caraffa's
charge were cut and the animals gal
loped along the street until caught by a
Chinese.
Caraffa will swear to a complaint to-day
and ask the police to arrest the men who
assaulted him.
Three of the many men who wer a
clubbed and beaten by policemen and
strikers were treated at the Emergency
Hospital last night. Adolph Thller, a
cabinet maker who lives at 23 Bruce place,
became mixed up In a crowd at Fifth and
Bryant streets and felt the weight of the
policeman's club on his cranium. He was
taken to the hospital and treated.
R. Bishop and J. E. Estes also suffered.
The former allowed his curiosity to get
the better of him and as he failed to move
fast enough received a blow on the head
to accelerate his speed. He does ' not
blame the officer who struck the blow.
Estes' is one of the men imported from
Los Angeles. He was in the vicinity of
Ellis and Mason streets and a striker
came behind him and pummeled him for
being a * : scab."
John H. Stiles, a striking teamster, was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Police
men Smith and Hooper and booked at the
City Prison on charges of malicious mis
chief and disturbing the peace. He broke
a window in a grocery at Third and Bry
ant streets and raised a disturbance by
abusing a teamster who was driving the
team he formerly handled. He tried to
escape, but was pursued and captured by
the two officers. â¢

- Acting Governor Cooper- has signed both
of the appropriation bills passed by the
Legislature, vetoing only one item, and
has issued a proclamation continuing the
special session for fourteen days longer,
to pass other appropriations which he
deems necessary. The continuance is very
distasteful to the Home Rulers, who want
a general extra session. ~
.,In both House and Senate this morning
motions were carried to table the mat
ters submitted by the executive, and a
motion to notify the Senate thÂ»t the
House was ready to adjourn sine die was
carried In the House.
The acting Governor in his message
asked for the passage of a loan bill and
also for a bill to' appropriate money for
the payment of unpaid bills amounting to
about $90,000. A majority of the Homo
Rule members are opposed to taking any
action at all. as It is thought that if
nothing is done now the executive will
be compelled to call a general extra ses
sion within a few months. Then the leg
islators will be free to act on the county
government bill and other measures
which they failed to get through in the
regular session.
Cooper's veto was of an appropriation
of $20,000 for a site for a. hospital for in
curables In Honolulu. He vetoed the Item
on the ground that the appropriation was
illegally made. Both houses concurred in
the veto. The session may come to an
end to-morrow morning.

experienced a series of heavy earthquake
shocks about 2:20 o'clock this afternoon.
The vibrations generally -were from north
to south, and At one or two points lasted
for five seconds. So far as learned no se
rious damage was done, though 'the force
of the shock was great enough to shake
dishes from shelves. The extent of the
earthquake north and south is not known.
At Elko, Nev., the shock was unusually
severe. The High School, a big new brick
edifice, was badly cracked by the violence
of the vibrations, and other buildings
were badly damaged.
The earthquake at this point was preced
ed and followed by rather remarkable
meteorological phenomena. For some
time preceding the shock the air was per
fectly still, while the heat was extremely
oppressive. A few minutes after the
shock, however, a violent wind and rain
storm, accompanied by heavy thunder
and lightning, burst over the city, the
'rain continuing for several hours.
At Deeth, Nev., goods were shaken from
the shelves of the stores. The shock was
not felt fifty miles north of Elko.

Own Packing.
SAN JOSE, July 26.â A contract was
placed on record to-day for the erection
of a large fruit warehouse at Santa Clara
for the California Cured Fruit Associa
tion at an estimated cost of $19,544. This
is the result of a long and heated discua
sion of the directory of the association,
threatening at one time to disrupt the
board. The move is said by Its Opponents
to be the first step in the plan for the
combine to do all Its own packing of
prunes, and was opposed on the ground
that it was in violation of the packers'
contract. The warehouse will be erected
on land owned by the town,' near the rail

act as agents for the Northern Pacific in
the operation of the Oriental liners.
The Pacific Coast Company is nego

Pacific Coast Company probably will also
consummate a pending deal for the Puget

Gala Days for Fishermen.
ASTORIA, July 26.â The great run of
salmon continues and packers are unable
to handle the fish offered them. To-day
the seiners suspended operations 'for a
time and the supply was shortened some
what, enabling canners to accept limited
quantities of tish from the gill net fisher
men. Scarcity of labor is felt and 50
cents an hour Is paid by the cold storage
houses. If the run falls off slightly, as
is now indicated, the fishermen will make
from $30 to $100 nightly. The present run
means $100,000 a day to Astoria. About
10,000 cases are being packed here daily
and this year's pack will undoubtedly ex
ceed that of last year.

and Harry Sanford of Â¦ Guadalupe were
driving along the county road, when their
attention was directed to a piece of cloth
ing lying, partly hidden, close to the
fence. Upon picking it up it was found
to be a waistcoat that had literally been
soaked with blood. As it was found on
the road to Guadalupe, the direction
which the murderer took, it Is beyond
question that it was worn and discarded
by the man who murdered Harry Bloch
man. The finders of the garment turned
It over to the constable at Guadalupe, who
sent It to Sheriff Stewart. , Â¦ .
The finding of this garment may make
the identification of the slayer of young
Blochman comparatively easy. Those who
worked with William Kelso, the suspect,
will know whether it was -worn by him.
Though the evidence of Kelso's guilt has
appeared so conclusive that there is little
doubt he would have been lynched had he
been captured at the time when scores of
citizens were engaged In the search for
him, there are a few who are not quitÂ©
certain that he is the murderer. The
blood-stained garment found by the road
side should put an end to these doubts.
A grand jury has been drawn to pass
upon Kelso's alleged connection -with thÂ©
crime. It will meet on Friday of next
week. â¢

To Admiral George Dewey, XT. S. N.. Wash

Winfleld S. Schley, U. S. N.. made in a let
ter dated July 22. 1301, copy herewith, a court
of inquiry, of which you are hereby appointed
president. Rear Admirals Lewis A. Kimberly
and Andrew E. K. Benham, U. S. N.. mem
bers, and Captain Samuel C. Lemly, U. S. N.,
Judge advocate general, Judge advocate, is
hereby ordered to convene at the Navy Depart
ment, Washington, D. C, at 1 o'clock^ p. m.,
on Thursday, the 12th day of September, 1901,
or as soon thereafter as may be practicable,
for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct
of the said "W*. S. Schley, commodore in the
navy during the recent war with Spain, and
In the connection with the events thereof.
WASHINGTON, July 26.â The precept to
the Schley court of inquiry was issued
this afternoon. It is as follows:

To the best of my recollection â and I be
lieve my memory on this point is clear â
the New York participated in but one
chase during the blockade of Santiago.
This was on the day of our arrival or on
the following day, I think."
The correspondent then said: "The
message which you sent to the Navy De
partment immediately after the victory,
and which read. 'Fleet under my com
mand offers nation as a Fourth of July
present, etc' That message, admiral, as
you know, has caused much criticism.
Was that written by you or at your dic
tation?"
"No, the message was written by a
member of my staff. T 'don't clearly
recollect which one. I approved the mes
sage, however. I must say if I had dic
tated the message my,Â«elf I should have
expressed the facts jllfferently." /
WIDE SCOPE OF THE INQUIRY.
"A press correspondent who was on
board the Brooklyn during the war makes
the assertion that you also frequently
weakened the blockading line by taking
your flagship, the New. York, away, to
chase schooners for prize money."
state that Shafter had represented to the
War Department that the- navy was not
co-operating, at least from his point of
view. As I remember it his complaint
was that I would not take a fleet into
Santiago harbor.
"Before my departure for Siboney to
attend the council of war I had received
telegraphic orders from the Navy Depart
ment informing me of Shatter's , com
plaint, directing me to confer with him
and to see if a- mutual understanding
could not be arrived at. This order, to
the best of my recollection; reiterated the
positive order received once or twice be
fore that I must not risk any of my ves
sels on the mine fields before the destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet: I must say
that before starting for the council of
war I had "consulted with Shafter by
proxy, but to no effect. He insisted that
I should make a personal examination of
his lines, which he stated were so attenu
ated by losses sustained in attack and by
illness that they could no longer be held.
Judge Lemly has not yet decided who
the witnesses before the court shall be.
They may be taken from the navy or from
civil life, for undoubtedly some of the
newspaper correspondents -will be called
in. the case. It is even probable, in view
of the recently published interview of
Captain Eulate of the Spanish navy,
that he and "Admiral Cervera himself will
be called if Admiral Schley desires It. Of
course the court of inquiry has no author
ity to compel their attendance, and it is
more than doubtful whether they would
respond to a summons, but the opportun
ity will be afforded. No word has been
received from Admiral Kimberly, who. it
was reported, had written to the depart
ment; saying that his health made it In
advisable for him to attempt to serve on
the court. He will not be officially noti
fied of his' selection as a member of the
court until he receives the precept, -which
was mailed to him to-day. A copy of
the precept will: also be sent to Admiral
Dewey and Rear Admirals, Benham and
Schley.
WASHINGTON, July 26.â Judge Advo
cate General Lemly, who was designated
as judge, advocate of the Schley court to
day, will now proceed with' the prepara
tion of his case. He will examine all
documents and prepare a list of witnesses.
The court will . probably sit for several
months, more than likely until after Con
gress convenes in December.

Mr Foreman and Gentlemen: During six
days we have listened to a painful recital of
one of the saddest tragedies ever presented to
a Jury. A beautiful girl. Just budding Into
womanhood, was shot down and her brother
has been accused of the crime. The Govern

was not shot by burglars: It has endeavored to
exclude all other members of the family from
the affair, and, third, to prove that the shot
was fired by her brother, Robert S. Fosburg.

proof, and so a great deal of evidence has been

End of the Tenth
Bound.
DENVER, July 26.â "Young Corbett" of

look like an amateur in their ten-round
go at Coliseum Hall here to-night and
was given the decision at the end of the
bout. Corbett had no trouble in landing
on Broad, and put him to the mat three
times during the bout. " > He landed an

TENNIS ASSOCIATION
IN B-ECrXTLAB MEETTN'G
Pates and Conditions Determined for
Tournaments in August and (
â September.
At a meeting of the Pacific States Lawn
Tennis Association held yesterday after
noon at the California Tennis Club some
very important business was transacted.
The delegates present were: Harry
Haight, Dr. C. S. Hardy, George Whitney,
William B. Collier and Harold Crowell.
The following tournament committee to
handle the men's tournaments was ap
pointed: Dr. P. J. Lane, chairman; H. W.
Crowell and Grant Smith. The events for
women will be handled by a tournament
committee composed of Miss Alice Hoff
man, chairman; Miss Miriam Hall and
Miss Emma Hunter.
George W. Lane was appointed referee
for all the tournaments to be held in Aug
ust and September.
Mr. Halton, representing the Hotel Ra
fael, on whose courts all the tournaments
will be. played, was present, and although
nothing definite was decided as to prizes
he will undoubtedly make the association
a generous offer. v
The ladies' tournaments were fixed for
the' last week in August, but the exact
dates have not yet been decided upon. The
association will hold another meeting in
the near future, when it will be decided
whether or not there is to be a mixed
doubles tournament. ' â¢
The dates of the men's tournaments
were not decided upon. Some of the mem
bers were "in favor of having the tourna
ments last from September ? to 9, while
others wanted them to be completed in
four days. It was finally decided to leave
the matter* to the tournament committee.
In addition to the yachts named above
the schooner Wave and the sloop Juanlta
belong 1 to class one, and the schooners
Virginia and White Wings to class two,
but ho time allowances have been allotted
to them, and with the possible exception
of the sloop Juanita they will take no part
in the race.
The Corinthians will cruise to Pet&luma
drawbridge to-day and will return to
Tiburon to-morrow.
The Californias had a cruise to Martinez
scheduled to-day, the return to be made
to-morrow, but it is not likely that more
than one or two yachts will make it.
The regatta committee of the Corin
thian Yacht Club wrote several days ago
to the Vallejo Yacht Club recommending
that none but amateurs be permitted to
steer or sail on either the challenger or
the defender for the Perpetual cup, and
requesting that the exact racing length of
the elobp Helen be sent as soon. as possi
ble. No reply had been received up to the
time of writing. â¢ .

I Steamship Company's Coptic ar-
I rived from the Orient via Hono
il lulu early yesterday morning.
While docking she carried- away
a portion of the wharf and gave the pas
sengers a scare, but no serious damage
was done. As the Coptic was nearing the
Mail Company's wharf a scow schooner
grot in the way and the steamship's course
had to be altered. Then the tide began
to carry her down and before anything
could be done the Coptic had sliced off
the big cluster of piles from the. south
west corner of the wharf, tore up tho
planking of the structure for several
yards around and gave herself a list to
port that made several people on board
lose their balance. The crowd on the
wharf waiting for the steamship to doclt
were warned that she would strike and
sought safety in flight. Everybody was
more frightened than hurt and a few hun
dred dollars will repair the damage.
The Coptic brings the news that the
cargo of the ship J. B. Thomas is being
discharged at Honolulu. She sailed from
Australia for Acapulco with a cargo of
ccal. â¢ During a storm the captain was
washed overboard and drowned and the
ship was partially dismasted/ She reached
Honolulu in distress and while awaiting
repairs it was found that her cargo was
hrated. The ship â¢ had to be partially
flooded before the coal eould be handled.
The Thomas is owned in San Francisco
and will probably come here. for an over
hauling.
The cabin passengers who came over on
the Coptic were: E. J. Alexander, A. Van

WRECK OF THE BALAENA.
Captain Leavett Tells of Loss of His
Ship in the Arctic.
Captain G. B. Leavett of the wrecked
steam whaler Balaena is back in town.
He left here several months ago for the
Arctic, but the vessel went on an Â¦ un
charted reef near St. Lawrence Island
and became a total wreck. When the
Balaena left here she was provisioned for
a thirty months' cruise and nearly all of
the $50,000 worth of supplies went down
with the ship.
It was Captain Leavett's Intention to
anchor in a cove on St. Lawrence Island
and in order to reach it he was steering
a course that he had followed' for twenty
years. When three miles oft shore the
Balaena struck, and all efforts to get her
oft were unavailing. Had any other steam
whalers been near she might have been
saved, but it was five days before the
Alexander showed up. By that time the
Balaena had worked over the reef and
was in a very dangerous position.
Captain Leavett ooarded the Alexander
and in her went in search of, the steam
whaler Grampus. The William Baylies
was' spoken and that vessel took the news
of the disaster to Nome. The Grampus
could not be found, so the Alexander went
back to tho wreck, which was found to
ba going to pieces. Nine of the Balaena's
crew decided to remain on St. Lawrence
Island and start a whaling station, others
joined whalers going north and the re
mainder of the men came home with the
captain.
The steam whaler Narwhal, which has
been two years in the Arctic, comes home'
this fall. The Beluga win remain off the
Mackenzie River for another, year and the
Bowhead, which wintered at Point Bar?
row, comes home this fall.
Wreck of the John Gambles.
The British bark John Gambles la a to
tal loss at Tahiti.' While the vessel was
at Salaverry, Peru, the captain was
drowned and the mate took command.
The vessel loaded 1600 tons of sugar for
Auckland, New Zealand, but on May 23
last the captain found himself off the isl
and of Tahiti in a dead calm. The cap
tain lowered a boat and went ashore at
Papeete. While he was uptown the John
Gambles began to drift on a reef and no
body aboard knew how to work her off.
The captain was warned, but before he
could get back to the beach the bark was
hard and fast on the coral reef. A court
of Inquiry was held and the officers were
blamed for the accident, but as none of
them were licensed men nothing could be
done with them.

SACRAMENTO. July 26.â The State
Board of Equalization to-day took up the
San Francisco and San Mateo Electric
Railway Company and the Sierra Rail
way. The former was represented by
George E. Starr, secretary and treasurer,
and the statement presented showed the
following: details, compared with a year
ago:

It appeared from the statements of Mr.
Btarr in response to questions from mem
bers of the board that $125,000 has been
spent In the past year in betterments, in
cluding a new power plant, new cars, re
newal of track, etc. The profits of the
road outside of this were about* $50,000, as
iagainst $34,000 the year before. To the
$59,000 was added an assessment of $75,000
upon the stock and all was put into the
item of "betterments and additions."
making an apparent showing of a loss of
$75,000.
It was said that in the present year it
is contemplated to continue the line to
San Mateo by way of Baden, and that
within a month through cars will be put
on to run to the end of the line at a rate
of forty miles an hour outside the city
limits, intending to compete with the
steam railroad.
In the new power plant the power is not
generated, but is received through trans
formers.
< The Sierra Railway was represented by
S. D. Freshman, assistant general man
ager and treasurer, and the statement
submitted showed the following, in com
parison with a year ago:
â¢ EARNINGS.
Passenger $64,5S< 38 $69,034 49

In the statement this year $92,672 65 was
given under the head of "betterments and
additions." It was shown that practically
all of this was due to permanent improve
ment, not properly chargeable to operat
ing expenses. This will give a showing in
operating- profits of some $S5,000. Last
year $84,953 30 was put under the head of
"miscellaneous expenses." Most of this
was chargeable to permanent improve
ment, making' a showing in operating
profits of about the same as last year.
D. L. Bliee, president of the Lake Tahoe
Railway and Transportation Company,
appeared before the State Board of Equal- ;
ization this afternoon and presented the
first report submitted by that road since
It was constructed. The road is located
principally In Placer County and runs a
littlÂ« more than a mile in Nevada County,
from Trucks* to Tahoe City. It is sixteen
miles in length. The value of the road
way was given as $23,790 and the value of
the rolling stock as $15,400. The net in
come of the past year was shown to be
$14,414 46. The report of the County As
sessor showed that the road was assessed
last year at $1900 a mile. The equalizers
took the statement of President Bliss un
der consideration.

REPORT WITH MAYOR
The engagement between Miss Heyne
man . and Mr. Stephens - was an
nounced early in . May at a dinner given
at the Heyneman home. Mr. Stephens
and Miss Heyneman met some time pre
vious, while the lady wnson a visit to
her uncle, the Mayor of Cincinnati. Mr.
Stephens came on a visit to this coast
with Governor Nash of Ohio and at the
dinner at which the betrothal was made
public, the Governor was an honored
guest. At the time of tho announcement
of tho betrothal it was urranged that the
wedding of the young couple should take
place early in tho fall.
Out at the elegant Heyneman home on
Pacific avenue no explanation is offered.
"The engagement . is . off.V says . Mrs.
Heyneman, "and we' all feel 'It Is best'
that it should be. Our first wish is natu
rally for our daughter's happiness and
she .fully realize^ that. l When the engage
ment was first . announced we all were
happy and thoroughly pleased with the
match. But since then things have, hap
pened." And that is all Mrs. Heyneman
would, say. As for the "things that have
happened," shetreferred the reporter to
Stephens. '
"Wire him. and find out," she volun
teered. "He knows why the engagement
had to be broken off." â¢ , . . Â¦ .
Herman Heyneman, the , well-known
tobacco merchant and the father of the
winsome Dorothy,, yesterday issued a
statement to the effect that the engage
ment existing between the young people
was off and also .apprised the luckless
Stephens that he was not destined to be

the breaking off of a match that seemed
to give satisfaction all round not one

WASHINGTON. July 2G.â The past
twenty-four hours -probably have been
the most favorable to the States of the
corn belt since 'the existing hot wave be
gan, nearly forty days ago. Rains, gener
ally light in amount, have fallen In West
ern Kansas, Western Nebraska, South
western Missouri, Central Iowa, Arkan
sas and a little in Oklahoma, and tho
prospects seem to be favorable for a con
tinuation , to-morrow of more showers In
the section covered by these States and
Territories.
On Sunday showers are looked for in
Northern Illinois and Northern , Indiana.
Still, there has been no general rain, of
which the crops stand" in so much need,
and there are no immediate prospects of
any. On the whole, the Weather Bureau
officials here regard the situation as some
what Improved. â¢'
Incidental to the rains, the tempera
tures officially reported to-day were some
what lower than yesterday. However
they ranged from 92 to 100 in the corn
belt. Conditions will remain practically
the same In the drought section during
Saturday and Sunday, and the weather
will continue very hot, with the possibil
ity of relief from scattered thunder
storms. â¢Â¦ Â¦:Â¦
In the Dakotas and Montana there has
not been any rain of importance in the

ON DRY FIELDS
Some men imagine there is no account
ing for tastes until they are called upon to
foot a dressmaker's bill.
Coroner Leland and his deputies stated
yesterday that from the facts reported to
them in connection with the death of
Breckinridge they felt satisfied that the
suicide was caused by mental suffering,
due to sickness and pain.
No arrangements have been made as yet
by tho Tevis family for the funeral of
Breckinridge. Tho deceased was 23 years
old and was the grandson of tho late cap
italist, Lloyd Tevis. His mother was a
daughter of the capitalist and his father
was John W. Breckinridge, a prominent
lawyer. The parents of young Breckin
ridge separated some years after their
marriage. Breckinridge Sr. died in Mer
ced May 2, 1SS2. Mrs. Breckinridge had
previously secured a divorce from him
and married Fred Sharon. Mrs. Sharon
and her daughter are now residing in
Paris, France, and news of the death of
her son was cabled. to her early yesterday
morning.
. Dr. Tevis said yesterday that there was
no truth In the statement that there had
been any family disagreement Just prior
to the death of Breckinridge.
Cella Kavanagh, a servant in the Tevis
mansion, and Charles Teller, a footman,
stated yesterday that Breckinridge had
been in a depressed mood since his return
from Monterey, but as he was not of a
cheerful disposition his depression had not
caused any comment.
room. Breckinridge was covered with the
bedclothes.
Dr. Harry Tevis, uncle of the deceased,
stated yesterday to Deputy Coroner Me-
Cormack that his nephew had threatened
to end his life owing to the spinal trouble
and paralysis from which he suffered.
William Lathim. the butler at the Tevis
mansion, said yesterday that Breckin
ridge 'had been In a despondent mood
since his return from Monterey three
weeks ago. On Thursday evening Breck
inridge called Lathim and asked him to
bring a glass of water to his room. An
hour later, when Lathim went to summon
Breckinridge to dinner, he received no re
sponse. Dr. Harry Tevis was notified, and I
the door of his nephew's room was broken
in. Breckinridge was found lying on the
bed, fullv dressed and dead. One end of
a rubber tube was in his mouth and the
other was connected with a gas jet in the
The jury impaneled by the Coroner was
taken to the house yesterday afternoon
to view the body of the suicide. An in
quest will be held this morning at 10
o'clock at the Coroner's office. The jury
is composed of the following citizens: W.
B. Gelatte, Tenth and Market streets; L.
F. Weaver. 1701" Market street; George

street.
Autopsy Surgeon Baclgalupi performed
an autopsy yesterday afternoon on the
body of young Breckinridge at the Tevis
residence. The autopsy showed that death
was due to carbon monoxide poisoning,
following the inhalation of illuminating
gas.
No disposition was shown by any mem
ber of the Tcvls family yesterday to keep
back any Information In connection with
the tragic end of young Breckinridge.
The fullest Information was given to Cor
oner Leland and his deputies. The state
ments that mystery was hovering over
the Tevis mansion on Taylor and Jackson
streets have no foundation.
A CAREFUL investigation of the
details surrounding the death of
Lloyd TevlÂ« Breckinridge shows
that tho grandson of tho late cap

Dudes yesterday and they won. , The Ill
luck* that mantles the Ewlngltes breaks
when the best Dude twlrler of them all
looks on the game from afar. One to
nothing was the score, and It represents
a game In which errors were reduced to
a minimum and ,the pitchers were the
planetary stars about which all revolved.
Thomas conducted the Senatorial fight.
He was well up In twists and curves and
Â¦surprised the fanatics by his consistent,
noiseless delivery. The Dudes connected
for a half dozen hits, and. as luck woulu
have It, scored a single run In the third
Inning. Dr. Mosklman, stood In the box
for the Brummels and when the game was
passed and done scurried off the field with
a record a little better than that of the
Senators' twlrler. ( ,
In the third inning Oakland scored Its
only run. Babbitt on a base on balls
reached the Initial bag and went a step
further on Mosklman's sacrifice. Then
McCarthy, who relieved Drennan on ac
count of a death In the family, rolled the
spheroid through the pitchers feet Into
deep center Rnd the only rurl of the day
was scored. The score:
Oakland 1, Sacramento 0.

This pundit, whose name is Serviss and who lives
in modern Ithaca, declares with a confidence which
we share that "the source of this trouble is the sun."

A *-tcrm in the East. Perhaps the term theory or
hypothesis will not properly characterize the positive
statement of his views. One reading them and hav
ing no knowledge of the subject, nor equipment for
applying thereto daily observations that arc within
the experiences of all men, may well be expected to
treat them as facts, since on their face they arc slated
as facts would be. }
Briefly, this professor says that the sun is a variable
star, that the intensity of its light and heat is variable.
He describes these fluctuations as a disease, of which
sun spots arc the symptoms, just as the pustules in
smallpox and the rash in measles arc symptomatic of
disease in man. , Believing the sun to have ah' in
closing envelope or crust which keeps back a per
centage of its heat, this crust, likened to the human
skin, cracks, breaks, falls apart and lets out the full
intensity of the fires behind it, he attributes to this
solar skin disease the heat which afflicts the children
of men on this planet. '

The ritualistic work of the order is impressive, the charges
of the several officers being full of those lessons that go far
toward making strangers who enter the forest better men

famous old guide, who died in May. 1900. at the age of 73,
Known to the world as the guido of the Adirondack Mountains,
is responsible indirectly, for the ideas embodied in tne ritual.

Origin of tlie Order.
The Idea of a monster initiation in California originated
â¢with Deputy \ Head Consul Mertan C. Allen of Golden Gate
Camp, who, after communication with Head Organizer Tem
ple, submitted his plan to Head Consul Falkenberg of Denver,
Colo., who at once approved of it and gave his sanction to
have the idea put into operation. The idea got out and spread
all over the Pacific Coast jurisdiction and steps were taken to
have, such initiations at different points in August. Thero will
be one on Mount Tabor, Oregon, when it is expected that 1000
strangers will be added to the membership of that State.
There will be a similar initiation in other places, where there
will be additions of from one hundred to five hundred. A"he
first of these will be held at Coeur d'Alene to-night; the next
-will be at Tabor Mountain, Oregon, August 3; then California's
initiation at Fernbrook August 10; at Boulder, Colo., the same
night; Taconia, Wash., .August 24, and Seattle August 31. Tho
Pacific Coast jurisdiction is composed of California, Colorado,
Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyomlnjf.
Great credit Is due State Organizer Temple for the work on
hand, Neighbor Temple having made the best record of any
field worker.

. . Much Interest in Local Camps.
Nothing in the fraternal circles of San Francisco has been
the subject of so much discussion as have been the prepara
tions that have been made for the monster. Initiation In the
forest at Fernbrook. It h.is been the topic of discussion in all
' the local camps; the officers of the camps have urged the mem
bers to action, so that the desired number, 1500, may be secured
by the time set for the event. The Individual members have
been buttonholing their friends and acquaintances who are
notmember3 of the order to come in and become neighbors of
woodcraft, the camp physicians hifve been busy devoting many
spare hours to examining eligibles who have signed applica
tion blanks, and the grand medical examiner has been obliged
to devote his whole time to revising the reports of the camp
Â¦physicians. , .
The camps that are interested In the movement, in San
Francisco are Golden Gate, California, Tamalpais, San Fran
cisco, Western Addition, Calumet, Mission, Redwood and Rich
mond. Each of these camps has arranged for headquarters
in the Fernbrook forest, and on the night of the 10th of Au
gust there will be a grand reunion at Pioneer Hall, from which
the procession will . move to 'tho ferry landing. Tamalpais
Camp will have Its own brass 1 band in line, and California
Camp will turn out with its hayseed band, a burlesque musical
organization of thirty; -all nttired as grangers, with hayseed
In their hair nnd "straw In their shoes. It will be under the
leadership of Bandmaster Page, who has spent many weary
hours teaching them tho mystery of musical discord. This
special organization will bo escorted to the ferry by a genuine
brass band of twenty pieces.
Special Features for Parade.
â¢ The other camps are arranging for .special features for the
procession to tho Union depot, but they, will not at this times
announce what those features are to be. It Is expected that
Golden Gate Camp, which already has a membership of more
Â»than 1400, .will. turn out a very largo number to escort about
250 candidates. The other camps will have from fifty to one
hundred candidates each. At tho Union depot the procession

For that very reason others besides the fat capital
ists invest in their securities. The Mail need not draw
on its imagination tor innumerable widows and or
phans and eleemosynary institutions supported by in
vestment in gas and water stock. That, we admit,
has nothing to do with the discussion, but it has as
much as the Mail's Mardi Gras picture of fat capital
ists.
The Mail draws a picture of conditions here to suit
itself, which indicates envy of others. It says: "If
San Francisco owned her own water works, for ex
ample, many a sleek and well-fed and fat capitalist
would have to look elsewhere than to the consumers
of water for his monthly income. Water and gas
stocks are gilt-edged securities in San Francisco.
You can get money on them quicker and easier than
on the best real estate. The banks will tell you so."
All that The Call is doing is challenging denial of
the. statement that in the administration of public
utilities municipal waste equals corporate profit. As
in each case the cost comes out of the people, they
will be paying the same directly and indirectly, and
under municipal ownership will add to the waste the
temptation to corruption. Plus this, the new policy
is at a disadvantage. There is no personal motive
behind this challenge.
The Mail then proceeds to an analogy between a
sewer system and a water supply, supposing the
sewers to be in public ownership. But the analogy
fails because sewers are constructed not at the cost
of the general public but at that of those who use
them by a frontage tax. Main sewers are built at the
expense of the district drained. The citizen who owns
no realty pays nothing for a sewer. While the sewers
are built out of the private and'not the public pocket,
the 'public, the government, takes the money and
spends it for that purpose under its police power, and
the history of Â«uch expenditure is that from one-third
to one-half of it is wasted in administration. There
have been casts ig which the mere advertising of a
sewer and for bids for its construction has cost more
than the material and labor to do the job. This fact
is stated not to promote the idea that corporations
should build sewers and charge for their use, but to
again illustrate the ever present' fact of government
waste. After the private purse has built the sewer
the municipality "pretends to take care of it, with the
result that there is hardly a mile of sewer in any
American city that is in condition to do its service
five years after its construction. In like manner
streets arc paved at the cost of abutting frontage.
The realty owners make the street at their private
cost, and the city assumes to take care of it. Result,
the property created at the expense of individuals is
kept in a state too unclean for decent use, and is per
mitted to rapidly deteriorate and go to waste.
THE Stockton Mail devotes much space to what
it seems to think is a discussion of public owner
ship of public utilities, but it mistakes a reit
erated personal attack on the" proprietor of The Call
for discussion of an abstract principle or a concrete
policy. Generalizing from the supposed personal
state of the owner of this paper, the Mail concludes
that whatever we say about public ownership has be
hind it the personal motive. As well might the Mail
say that if a man proceed to demonstrate that the
hemp crop is unprofitable it is because he had a rela
tive hanged. The profit of the hemp fiber is a fact
demonstrable in the nature of things, and that hemp
rope has choked a felon has nothing to do with the
matter.
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
The 'bosses from highest to lowest perceive the
danger that threatens their hold on' politics and on
their following, and are making a determined effort
to win. They have formed a strong combination, for
Hcrrin and Kelly arc not weak, and accordingly the
advocates of good government and honest politics
must organize to combat them. Much has been
already accomplished in that direction, but the work
should not be permitted to lag. Every member of a
Republican League Club should work diligently to
bring in new members. The whole mass of stanch
and stalwart Republicans should be brought to the
polls, on election day to uphold true Republicanism
and smash the bosses. That is the oivly way to save
the party. It is the only way to assure good govern
ment for San Francisco.
The gross evils growing out of corruption at the
primaries developed the public demand for a primary
election law and have at last brought about the en
actment-of such a measure. In this contest, there
fore, every good citizen finds himself able to com
bat the boss with an effective weapon. There are to
be no more scandals of force and fraud in the control
of primaries. If the predatory, gangs win this time it
will be only because the better elements of the people
are too sanguine of victory to take the trouble to go
to the polls to assure it.
From the first the stronghold of the boss has been
the primaries. Those elections have been subject to
fraud and violence to such an extent that good men
have taken comparatively little interest in them be
cause they knew that no matter how the vote went
the tools of the boss who controlled the primary
would force the result to suit his schemes.
WITH the movement now going on to rid
the Republican party of "the predatory
bosses who have been preying upon it every
gpod citizen is concerned. It means honest politics
for the party, and it means good government for the
city. If it be successful it will bring benefits to every
class of people in the community outside of tax
eaters and tax-shirkers.
Foreign critics of our governmental affairs have
united in "declaring that municipal government is the
weak point in our system. It is in that arena the boss
is most potent and his gangs most pernicious. San
Francisco is one of the cities that have suffered most
from* such creatures, and what has been done in the
past will be repeated in the future unless the boss
and his henchmen be driven out of politics.
KEEP UP THE WORK.
â¢ The nations have agreed that. China is to pay
23,000,000 taels a year, and that most of it is to be
collected by a salt tax; and now if that much talked
of international salt trust be formed, the average
Chinaman will have to live on fresh food for many a
year. Salt fish will be a luxury. ; : .

We stand up for the sun, and believe that its inten
tions are benevolent, and that the cause of trouble
must be sought' nearer Ithaca. ; -
Going from the mechanical to the chemical, it is
legitimate to search for a. chemical cause," originating
in the body of the sun, for varying conditions of our
atmosphere;- but then again why should not such
chemical cause affect equally the whole body of at
mosphere exposed to it? So it would seem that,
whatever the cause, it is local to the planet, and is
localized on its surface, all parts thereof not, being
equally affected. . ' , Â¦ .
Admitting that the sun has a blanket of vapors, a
crust, a skin, the earth has its atmospheric envelope,
which refracts, breaks, the rays of the suny.just'as the
platinum wire breaks the electric current and in the
friction of the process develops heat and light.
Shining into a pail of waterthe heat given thereto by
the sun is equal to the resistance of the medium.
Shining on the side of the metal pail. the resistance is
greater and the degree of heat developed much more.
All this is purely mechanical, but. may we not learn
from it to seek the cause of an access of heat in the
conditions of our own atmosphere, which
varying degrees of density, "of resistance, of friction,
and will account for abnormal heat iii latitudes where
the sun is farther away from vertical, and normal heat
where it is many degrees nearer vertical? This ac
counts for a hot Bismarck and a cool, almost cold;
San Francisco. But Professor Serviss' theory does
not account for this, and depends upon an even heat
in same latitude and altitude. â -
. We are inclined to think that the sun is indicted
.on more counts that can be proved.
To come to a more local comparison^ why should
Fresno have 102 degrees, while San Francisco, '200
miles north, has 56, and San Diego, nearly 500 miles
south, 1 has only 70 degrees? Why do people drop
dead at 98 degrees of heat in New York City the same
day that San Francisco's maximum islonly 54? Each
city is on the shore of an ocean, with similar physical
conditions, except that San Francisco is farther south
and nearer the line of a vertical sun; Professor Ser
viss will concede that the increased heat of the' sun,
jdue to its skin disease, wilt be felt as its normal heat
is, the more severely where the rays are vertical to
the surfa.ee of the earth, and with modified force as
the angle increases. Then why do New Orleans, Mo
bile, Savannah and Charleston have their normal,
summer temperature, while St. Paul and far Winni
peg are shrieking with the unusual heat? . / .-â¢ Â¦

Should Senator Taylor undertake a third time to
set himself right through the press he should explain
first why he proposed to the bill as it came to the
Senate, certain amendments which struck the words
"and revenue" from the measure; why he thereafter
sought to get contracts with saloon-keepers, binding
them to pay him and other attorneys for obtaining for
them the protection from county licenses which the
act gave them; why he told one of his friends that if
he would canvass the liquor-dealers of Alameda
County and get them to sign the contract he would
be "properly treated." Those things constitute the
issue that the Senator is up against.
The facts have been published in The Call fully and
specifically, and if there be any wrong done by them
to Senator Taylor it is to be presumed he has a suffi
cient knowledge of the law to know how to seek re
dress for any injury he may have received. There is
nothing to be gained by blaming "central."
Basing conclusions upon those facts, The Call
charged that Senator Taylor had procured the passage
of the act and was working it, or trying to work it, to
his profit. â¢
It is no sufficient to those charges to say
that he was cut off by "central" when he was going
to explain what he meant by denying that he knew
anything about the "Kelley-Taylor" bill.
The charges of The Call were and are that Sena
tor Taylor procured the passage of Assembly bill
456 with amendments proposed in the Senate Com- v
mittee on Municipal Corporations, of which he is
chairman; # that thereafter a large number of circular
letters were sent out to attorneys in various parts of
the State* inviting them to obtain contracts . from
saloon-keepers to pay certain sums of money, pro
vided that the saloon-keepers' business were relieved
from the payment' of "such license tax now imposed
by the Board of Supervisors"; that the circulars
were inclosed in envelopes of the firm of Taylor &
Mason; that the contracts would have been in the
nature of a cinch for the attorneys, since the passage
of the act as amended made it certain the attorneys
would win.
We give the explanation for what it is worth. In
the affairs of the world in these days "central" has a
good deal to answer for. It may be true that the per
verse person of '.the wires cut Mr. Taylor off just as
he was going to explain, but, admitting that to be so,
the circumstance does not affect the main issue.
Confronted with those facts Senator Taylor now
undertakes to explain his original denial. He says in
a letter to the Oakland Enquirer: "The Call cast
aspersions upon a Kelley-Taylor bill, alleging a
scheme. The hyphen means that there were com
panion bills in each house. I 'phoned a reporter that I
had never heard of a Kelley-Taylor bill and had noth
ing-to do with the drawing or introduction of the
license bill, and this was true. The central then cut
me off when I was hurrying to a train and I did not
conclude my interview."
It did not take long to dispose of that denial. The
Senate Journal shows that on March 11, 1901, there
was a" report from the Committee on Municipal Cor
porations recommending the passage of that bill "as
amended," and the report was signed by Taylor as
chairman. - A little later on the same day the bill was
taken up, by unanimous consent and the five amend
ments submitted by the committee of which Taylor
was chairman were adopted. Among the amendments
was the important one striking from the bill the
words "and revenue," which materially altered the in
tent of the measure;
SENATOR E. K. TAYLOR of Alameda has once
more entered upon an explanation of) his con
nection with the passage of Assembly bill No.
456, relating to the regulation of liquor licenses in
all counties of the State except. San Francisco. In
his first statement on the subject to the Alameda En
cinal Taylor is quoted by that paper as saying: -- "I
had nothing to do with this bill. It was introduced
by Kcllcy in the Assembly and was known as the
Davis bill. From The Call's article, it would be in
ferred that I introduced it into the Senate, which is
untrue. I had nothing to do with its introduction or
passage."

Meanwhile there are well posted busi
ness men who say that the deal will be
consummated shortly, notwithstanding
the denials of the gentlemen who have
the matter under consideration.
W'akefieldi Baker of the "firm of Baker
& Hamilton said yesterday that he had
heard rumors of the proposed consolida
tion. His firm had not been consulted, he
said, and he did not believe the talked of
consolidation would be finally effected. As
far as his firm was concerned, he went
on, it would not be identified with the
movement in any way. as it was not
handling hardware to the degree that it
is a competitor in the local market, the
specialty of the firm being agricultural
Implements. !
Charles Holbrook, president of Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson, admitted that
the matter had been discussed by him.
He said he could not act for his firm in
the. absence of his associates, who are
now In New York, where they will remain
for some time to come. ThÂ© proposed
consolidation had not advanced beyond
the chrysalis stage, he said, and therÂ«j
was no assurance that It would ever be
consummated.
A. L. Scott of Miller, Sloss &' Scott
states that the report was an exaggera
tion. The proposition of consolidation was
first called to his attention by a New
York business man, who Informed him
that it was current rumor in hardware
circles of New York that the wholesalers
of. San Francisco intended to enter Into a
combine. Scott was emphatic in saying
that the proposition had never been dis
cussed by him with any member of the
firms alleged to be in "the deal. Â¦ He did
not believe such a consolidation would be
effected at an early date, if at all. "
Brace Hayden, president of the Dun
ham-Carrigan-Hayden Company, one of
the largest wholesale hardware firms in
the "West, denies that there is any truth
In the . report. He said positively that
there was no prospect of 'such a consoli
dation as far as his house was concerned.
He admitted that the matter had been
spoken of in his presence, but only in an
informal manner.
On the other hand, there are many
business men who are convinced that tne
combination is bound to pome at an early
date. The larger hardware firms, it Is
argued, would be enabled to operate their
concerns under a pooling agreement at a
much less cost than Is the case at present.
An army of drummers now in the field at
an expense of many thousands annually
to the competing firms would be dispensed
.with. The proposed consolidation, It 's
further said, would enable the local
wholesalers to purchase goods in greater
bulk and therefore effect a great saving.
In other words, the proposed pooling of
hardware interests would prevent compe
tition, and while it would lessen the cost
of materials to the members of the pool
it would enable the consolidated concerns
to sell goods at a lower figure and. still
yield a fair profit.
H. J. Morton, treasurer of the George
W. Gibbs Company, denies that the firm
with which he Is connected Is any- party,
to the proposed deal. He stated yester
day that the firm had not even been con
sulted with reference to the project and
that there waa not, in his opinion, any
foundation for the reported consolidation.
A project of tremendous importance to
the Industrial Interests of San Francisco
and involving the consolidation of four of
the leading wholesale hardware and iron
and steel houses into a combination with
a capital stock ranging from $5,000,000 to
$20,000,000 is under consideration. The
firms interested In the matter are the
Dunham-Carrigan-Hayden Company, Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson; Miller, Slosa &
Scott, and George "W. Gibbs Company.
While the negotiations to this end have
in no sense approached completion, the
matter has been generally discussed in
business circles and by members of the
firms named. The parties Interested ad
mit that the proposed pool had been talk
ed of, but that no formal steps to that
end were taken, and that none would be
taken in the near future.
Merchants Deny, However,
That Any Combination
Is Contemplated. â¢

sealed orders are not for him. f
Count Francis Joseph von, Larisch ar
rived in Ban Francisco some weeks ago
with his bride, Miss Saiterfleld who was,
whom he married in June at her home In
Buffalo. After a. trip to Tosemlte the
Count and Countess returned to the Grand
Hotel Thursday. They will spend a week
here and will then visit Yellowstone Park
and continue eastward. They plan to em
bark for Europe in September.
The other Count, the man of exile and
mystery. Is Count Edmund von Larisch.
He was a passenger from Vancouver, ar
riving on the Bteamer Walla Walla yes
terday morning. When the inspectors
from the Bureau of Immigration boarded
the steamer after the Quarantine officers
had given her a clean bill of" health they
were given information which stands
upon the record thus: "Count Edmund
von Lertsch, age 67. watchmaker, nat
uralized citizen of the United States."
When the Walla Walla docked, about
9:30, the Count from the British Columbia
port disappeared at once In the busy
throng and has not been in evidence since.
He did not register at any of the leading
hotels, and neither the German nor the
Austrian consulates heard anything from
him, though the announcedpurpose of his
visit was to receive here sealed orders
from the German Government In relation
to some secret and important mission.
Knows Not the Watchmaker.
The Count at the Grand Hotel Is a
young- man. Blight of figure and with
beardless face, bright-eyed and fresh
complexioned. He speaks English with a
pleasing accent, and Is altogether an
agreeable young man and not in the least
a type of the degenerate nobleman with
whom American heiresses are wont to
contract matrimonial alliances. The
Countess is a tall and handsome brunette,
and is wealthy, her father, now deceased,
having been a Standard Oil magnate.
"I know nothing of this man, who, as
you inform me, arrived to-day," said the
young Count last evening. "When I was
In the East early in this year I heard of
a man who claimed to be a Count von
Larisch. and who told of a duel forty-five
years ago and his consequent exile and
his recent restoration to his title and es
tates. The papers insinuated that he was
a faker â that his claims were unfounded.
I returned to Bavaria in May and talked
with my faiher about this man. He said
nothing of the sort had occurred in our
family, end the name of Count Edmund
von Larisch is not to be found in the
Gothaic 'Almanach.' His claims may be
all right, but he certainly is not a member
of our family, and I do not want my pres
ence here to be tangled up with him and
his supposed secret missions."
Count Francis Joseph von Larisch is the
eon of Count George von Larisch, who Is
living on his estates at Sakrau. Prussia,
although the family is Austrian. In fact,
the family name Is generally written
Larisch-Moenlch. Count Francis Joseph
is a grandnephew of Duke Charles Theo
dore of Bavaria, who has achieved fame
as an oculist. The young Count Is ani
mated with a desire to emulate his distin
guished relative and has studied medicine
with him. When he returns J.o Munich
with his fair American bride he will go
Into his greatuncle's private clinic and
continue his studies there.
Story Much Exploited.
The older Count has got extensively into
the public prints of late.. Earlier In
the year the newspapers contained news
ptories and Sunday supplement articles
In which his life history was related. He
claims that in 1856 he fought a duel with
a superior officer. Count Ponita, a major
in a crack Uhlan regiment. Rivalry for
the favor of a beautiful woman was the
causp of the duel. Ponita was killed and
Count von Larisch fled to America. A
court-martial afterward sentenced him
to forty-five years' expatriation. He
worked in menial positions in New Or
leans, and finally learned watchmaking
and established himself in New York as
Edmund Heinecke. dropping the Von
Larisch and the title of Count His term
of expatriation has expired and he claims
to have been restored to his title and to
his estates, valued at $5,000,000.
Dispatches were sent out from Vancou
ver July 20. tellinpr that Count Edmund
von Larisch was there; that he was go-
Ing to San Francisco to open there sealed
orders which would Inform him of the
nature of an important secret mission
with whicn he had been Intrusted, and
that afterward he would proceed to Ot
tawa, â¢where he was to represent the Ger
man court at the reception to the Duke
and Duchess of Cornwall and York.
And that is how it comes about that San
Francisco harbors two Counts von

The residents In the vicinity of Twen

had considerable amusement within the

Henry Windt to remove Mrs. Elizabeth
Klrsch from the lower story of a house
which he claims Is his property. Mrs.
Klrsch also claims title to the property
and resisted Windt. though ha was back

The property in^questlon is a two-story
building and was formerly, owned by Mrs.
Klrsch. The lower portion of the house
Is used as a store and the upper part as a
dwelling^ Mrs. Klrsch procured the key
to the store a week ago from the family
occupying the upper part of the house,
and, after storing a wagon load of furni
ture in the place, took possession. She
pasted a notice to that effect in the store
window. . *
Windt heard of the woman's actions and
procured a warrant from Judge Caba
niss for her arrest. With Officer Pren
dergast he visited the place Thursday aft
ernoon, and It was only by forcing the
door that he secured an entrance. He
found Mrs. Kirsch in bed, very sick, as
she claimed. The warrant was read to
her by the officer, but she declined to
After the officer and Windt had left she

street police station and gave herself up.
She furnished bonds and was released.
She left the house for a few hours yes
terday and when she returned she found
her furniture on the street. It- had been
removed by Wlndt's agents during her
absence. To prevent her from again tak
ing possession they put padlocks on the
doors. Mrs. Kirsch's 13-year-old son and
the family dog had been removed with
the furniture and were on guard when she
returned. She determined to occupy the
premises again and promptly forced one
of the locks. She chose the main part of
the Btore as her temporary residence arid
brought a chair in from the pile of furni
ture on the street for comfort.
She held her position for several hours

section 1565 of the Political Code, which
in part says:. "And it is further provided
that no more than ' twenty recitations per

secondary schools, and no pupil under the
age ' of 15 1 years in any , grammar or pri

has operated as a disturbing feature in some

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, July 26.â September wheat opened
unchanged to %c higher at 71%@71%c, local
shorts covering on a small scale. Easy cables
and encouraging crop reports from .the spring
wheat country were against the price, and
there were Indications that the spring crop
would receive further rains within the next
twenty- four hours. There was very little de
mand the greater part of the day and Sep
tember gradually worked . down to 70%c. A
better demand developed at this concession in
price and the close was steady, %c lower at
7C%c.
Corn prices followed a comparatively narrow
path, traders apparently laying oft to await
further developments . in the crop situation.
The market held steady, September closing
%c over yesterday at 66%c.
Oats were dull and easier in sympathy with
wheat. September closed %c lower at 35Hc.
Trade in provisions was dull and prices tend
ed downward on the heavy hog receipts. Sep
tember pork closed 17%c lower, lard 5c down
and ribs 2%c depressed.

Under these circumstances large Interests
have been inactive or have only supported
their specialties when the weakness became
pronounced or when the attacks of the bear
traders seemed to be ' dangerous. At the
same time the depressing, tendencies seem to
have limits and the market,' in the absence of
further liquidation,! becomes easily oversold.
This was shown on Tuesday when prices,
which had broken the day before, were rallied
on short coverinsr, induced by reports of some
what better weather prospects in the West.
After that ..the fluctuations were irregular,
within narrow limits, fresh short lines being
put out only to be , taken in again, though
buying for long account, except in a few par
ticular stocks, was absent. Little attention
was paid to any news except that relating to
corn crop conditions, the general impression
being that the serious reduction in the yield
will affect many railroads materially. The
street, for Instance, has apparently come to
the conclusion that no Increase need be looked
for now In the Union Pacific's dividend rates,
or its common stock. The steel workers' strike
was, of course, discussed, but the United
States Steel corporation shares showed steadi
ness and a disposition to respond promptly to
reports that the strikers were making no pro
gress and that an end of the trouble might
be expected. It seems that their anticipations
were exaggerated and the street at large is
certainly disposed to let the Steel stocks alone
for the present, there being no Inducement
to buy them, while the support of the
Inside interest checks t bearish attacks on
them. Money was easy all week . and the
favorable bank statement of last Satur
day -allays apprehension as to high rates of
interest when the demand for funds to move
crops assumes full proportions. " >
Continued drought in the corn belt and a
further reduction of the yield in the largest
producing States have unsettled the stock
market and reduced its activity. Public in
terest is lacking and the commission house
business in Wall street was this week prob
ably the smallest in a long time. The profes
sional operators are bearish on the situation
and Western speculators have also acted on
the short side of the account.
NEW YORK. July 26.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say:
Butter, Cheese and E&gs stand about the
same as last week.
Meats and Poultry are about as before, and
the latter is plentiful.
The fruit" market is not as wen furnished
with choice fruit as txsoal at this time of the
year, as the teamsters* strike has checked
shipments from the country. Real choice fruit
is rather difficult to obtain at the moment.'

ment. Other securities sympathized, but the
finish was feverish. . .

Variations in the corn market on Monday in
dicated manipulation by stock market inter
ests. Weather reports alone were not suffi
ciently distressing to carry the September corn
option at Chicago to within a small fraction
of 60c, while the withdrawal of support caused
6c lower the following day. j The high prices
prevailed 1 throughout the week, however, and
2.449,921 bushels of old- corn were taken out
of cribs and marketed at big profits. Foreign
buying is insignificant, Atlantic exports for the
week amounting to only 1,042,361 bushels,
against 3,099.897 a year ago, when quotations
were about 15c lower. Wheat prices are more
rational and the movement is heavy. Receipts
for the week were 6.898.528 bushels, against
6,043,997 last year, and Atlantic exports 4,873,309
bushels, against 1,604,935 a year ago.
Failures for the week numbered 198 â¢ in the

New lines of woolen goods for delivery after
October 1 opened at reductions from last year's
prices, as generally expected by the trade.
Supplies of heavy*-weight goods have been re
duced to a satisfactory point and the situa
tion in all branches of the industry is such as
to engender : confidence. Raw woolens, how
ever, thus far fail to reflect the improvement,
quotations remaining unchanged at the lowest
average price in four years. A few of the
most expensive grades are held above former
figures and the bulk of the new, domestic clip
has gone Into the hands of speculators* who
await profitable terms. Cotton goods are dull,
neither buyers nor sellers exhibiting any eager
ness to make propositions. Withdrawals of
prominent concerns from the Fall River sell
ing committee suggest lower prices for print
cloths. . Mills are not fully employed, either
North or South. Quiet conditions In the do
mestic' manufacture, light exports and better
Â¦weather on plantations caused further depres
sion in raw cotton. * '-. ..â¢-.â¢''
A fortnight"- of -the steel strike 'Â¦ has passed
without materially altering the position of the
contestants or. adversely affecting the Industry
as a whole. ; Exceptional activity is noticed
at the mills not affected by the strike and the
movement of structural material for bridges,
buildings and track elevation is Etlll heavy.
Steel bars for j agricultural Implement makers
are firm In price and freely purchased. Rail
ways seek freight cars and rails are sold for
delivery next January. Cotton ties, sheets and
hoops are commanding a premium. Piglron is
accumulating, but producers offer no Â¦ conces
sions. Orders for tin plates were not accepted
for delivery before -October 1 when ' the strike
began, owing to the oversold condition of mills.
and distant ' contracts are still taken at' un
changed prices but Jobbers are receiving high
prices for goods deliverable Immediately. Tin
has fallen to the quotations prevailing in May,
owing to the lack of demand here and weak
ness in London. - , . .-<:Â¦'

Receipts were still higher again yesterday,
but the market lacked the snap of the preced

in the demand, which they attributed to the
different strikes, which have taken more or
less people out of employment.' There was no
especial decline in prices, however, and In fact
Peaches advanced on canning account, as will
be seen below. Plums and Prunes ruled firm.
Grapes from Arizona continued to arrive la
bad condition, as for a week back. Pears were
steady and Figs scarce. Berries were slow.
Apricots were hirber.
The strike situation showed no particular
change The number of team3 increases from
day to day and less difficulty is experienced
in receiving and delivering goods, but the move
ment is not yet restored to normal conditions
by any means, and were it not for the light
receipts of fruit the situation would be ae

TONS OF DEAD FISH
ON THE LAKE SHORE
Wholesale Destruction of Carp in
the Chabot Reservoir at
Oakland.
Oakland Ofilce San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 28.
Tons of flsh have been killed by dyna
mite by order of Manager Arthur L. Ad
ams 6f the Contra Costa Water Company,
who has determined to exterminate all
the carp In I-ake Chabot. The edict that
the carp must go was issued after consul
tation with the Game Commissioners, to
whom It was explained that the finny den
izens of the lake were making a nuisance
of themselves by burrowing In the mud
and spoiling the water. The carp were
further charged with harrying to death
the trout and bass with which the com
pany has been trying to stock the lake.
At first the attempt was made to get the
flsh all out with dragnets, and 15.000 of
them were taken in this way and shipped
to a San Francisco glue factory. This
method was found to hÂ« too slow, and, In
addition, it rolled the water. Then It was
found that the receipts from the sale of
the flsh were not paying for the work of
catching them. So Manager Adams de
cided to make them up into fertilizer and
to kill them with dynamite Instead of tak
ing them out alive. â¢ ,
After a stick of the explosive Is set off
under the water hundreds of dead carp
come to the surface and are gathered up.
They are then burled In trenches, whence
they will be taken and Bold after decay
ing.
When the carp are all cleaned out of
the lake It will be stocked with trout and
black bass.
Dr. A. W. Nieuwenhuis. a noted ex
plorer and medical officer of the Dutch
army, arrived here yesterday from Java
and is at the Occidental. He gives a
graphic account of his explorations In
the island of Borneo, and says that he has
traveled the Island from east to west and
visited places never before traversed by a
white rann.
Dr. Nieuwenhuis says that he com
menced his scientific Investigations In
1894, when ho led an exploring party Into
the central part of Borneo. After his re
turn to Java, where he was stationed, he
decided to explore the entire Island of
Borneo. He was advlaed against making
the trip, as It was considered too dan
gerous, but he would not be dissuaded
He started In 1898. accompanied by two
Europeans and threo natives. They land
ed on tho west coast of Borneo and trav
eled alone the banks of the River Kol

CLTIVELAXD, Ohio. July 26.â Amid the
enthusiastic cheers of nearly 10,000 people
Cresceus, world's champion trotting stal
lion, again demonstrated that he is the
king of all trotters by going a mile to-day
over the Glenville track in 2:02%. This
establishes a new world's trotting record
for both sexes, displacing the former
world's record of 2:03Â»4, held by The Ab
bott,
Owing to the heavy rain of last night
the track was not In the best of condition
to-day, and it was about 6:30 p. m. before
it was deemed to be In sufficiently good
shape to warrant the attempt. At that
time the sun's heat had been replaced by
cool breezes. Even then there were few
horsemen who looked for a mile better
than 2:06.
After having been given several prelim
inary miles, George Ketchum came out
with the stallion to attempt what seem
ed an Impossible feat. Ketchum nodded
for the word In the third score, the horse
trotting like a machine. Accompanied by
a runner, the chestnut stallion fairly flew
to the Quarter, the timers' watches regis
tering Just SO seconds. As Cresceus swung
into the back stretch he waa Joined by a
second runner, and, although many pre
dicted that the footing: was such as would
retard bis speed, he reached the half
in l:0L
When the time was hunff out the im
mense crowd broke- Jnto cheers. The
three-quarter pole was reached In 1:31%,
and as the great stallion trotted Into the
stretch, a runner on either side, his fric
lionless, machine-like stride was fairly
eating up the distance. Never faltering,
notwithstanding the terrific clip, he fairly
flew to the wire, not being touched once
by the whip, his sole urging being the
driver's voice and thÂ« thundering hoof
beats of the accompanying runners.
When the time for the mile was an
nounced, 2:02%, the immense crowd fully
realized that a new world'* record had
been established. Ketchum and his fa
vorite stallion received an ovation euch as
has been seldom witnessed on a racetrack.
Thousands of enthusiastic people rushed
out on the track and Ketchum was lifted
from the 6ulky and carried to the grand
stand on tho shoulders of admirers. Cheer
after cheer rent the air and the name of
Cresceus was upon the lips of all.
"Ketchum! Ketchum!" yelled the crowd,
and the owner of the sturdy son of Rob
ert McGregor was almost carried to the
judges' Etand. â¢where he delivered a brief
address.
Cresceus row not only holds the Â¦world's
trotting record for both sexes, but last
Â¦week at the Detroit grand circuit meeting,
by trotting: In 2:06?i and 2:05 in his race
against Charley Herr. secured the world's
record for the two fastest heats ever
trotted in a race, his second mile in 2:05
also being a new world's record for the
fastest mile ever trotted in a race and
also the fastest second heat ever trotted.

bles the news of the first surrender of in
surgents in the island of Samar, 500 men,
with two field guns, thirty rifles and sev
enty bolos, giving themselves up to the
authorities.
The opinion prevails among United
States officers that It will take years to
accomplish the economic programme of
General Cortyn. The civil and educational
authorities hold that a continuance of the
protection over minor posts is necessary
aside from that afforded by the con
stabulary. It is generally expected that
the concentration will be more gradual
than is anticipated in Washington.
The first meeting of the Legislative
Chamber,; held to-day, Â¦was largely at
tended. Commissioner Wright, speaking
of the charter of Manila, said the same
reasons that controlled In making Wash
ington the Federal city obtained In Ma
nila, and Washington, he declared, was
the best governed city in the world.
Representatives of the Spanish Cham
ber of Commerce. vehemently opposed the
charter, asserting that it was inconsist
ent with the principles of the freest gov
ernment on earth to deny the- right of
suffrage to the residents of the metropolis
while granting it to those of other locali
ties. They also declared that the proposed
system of government for Manila was far
less liberal than that offered by the Span
ish authorities, who proposed to make the
representatives of the districts in Manila
elective by the people.

POLICE USE THEIR CLUBS ON CROWDS
John Cullen, 19 years of age, was bru
tally beaten and robbed by three foot
pads last night about midnight on Golden
Gate avenue/between Polk, street and
Van Ness avenue. The thieves, not con
tent with relieving him of his gold watcb,
knocked him down. beat, him over the
head with a revolver and kicked him in a
brutal manner. Â» .
Cullen reported the hold-up to the po
lice and then went to the Emergency Hos
pital to have his wounds dressed. His
scalp was lacerated in several places, one
of his eyes was completely closed and his
body badly, bruised. Cullen, in telling of
the robbery and assault, said:
"The men must have followed me from
a Market-street restaurant. I walked up
Market street after leaving the eating
house to Larkin and along Larkin to
Golden Gate avenue. I was walking along
the avenue and had just passed Polk
street, when a man "jumped out in front
me, pointed a pistol at my head and
'Give me th_at rock.' By the rock he
meant my diamond scarf pin. I had taken
it out of my tie after leaving the restau
rant and put it in my pocket, which is
proof that they followed me from there.
Hardly had the footpad made the demand
when he was joined by two other men,
and the three jumped me. They kicked
me and punched me and the man with the
pistol struck me on the head several
times with it. '
"Some one of the three grabbed my
watch and then the trio ran away." ,
As soon as the robbery was reported
several police officers hurried to the scene
of the crime, but were unable to locate
any of the thugs. Owing to the darkness
Cullen was unable to see the men plain
enough to describe them clearly.

OAKLAND, July 26.â Police detec
tives, armed with warrants, to
day arrested; Mrs. Mary C. Tee
ple and Mrs^E. C. McConnell, her
sister, to whose residence. 30
Sixth street, was traced by trail of earth
a lot of Jardinieres which had been stolen
from the residence of John K. Orr at 149
Eighth street. The warrants were sworn
to" by Orr, who demanded that there
should he a thorough investigation of the
disclosures made by the successful search
for his missing garden pots. The revela
tions to-day have thrown a strange color
upon what the police declare is one of the
most remarkable cases ever brought to
their attention.
Besides the Jardinieres, flower pots, val
uable plants and the like that the detec
tives found at the Teeple home yesterday,
there was uncovered to-day nearly two
' score more of such ornaments, of all eorts
of sizes, shapes and manufacture, that
Â¦were hidden In trunks and out of the way
corners in the cellar. All of these were
removed to the police station, where not
a few. were identified by prominent peo
ple as v having been stolen from. their gar
dens during the past year and a half.
' Work of a Kleptomaniac.
That the thefts were the acts of a klep
tomaniac the police are convinced. They
believe that Mrs. Teeple Is responsible for
most of the purloining, but they can flni
no reason for the thieving Bave that the
unfortunate woman Is afflicted with an un
controllable desire to steal. The case ap
peals even to the hard-headed detectives
as pathetic. When they were sent on
their unpleasant mission this morning
Mrs. Teeple was found hugging her baby
of nine months and in a state of nervous
prostration. Her husband, Harry C. Tee
ple, a Southern Pacific Company conduc
tor, home from a run, was astounded at
the revelations. He declared absolute Ig
norance of the manner In which the stolen
Â¦wares had been taken Into his home. ' Â¦
"As Boon as I learned of this dreadful
occurrence," he Â«"ald, "I went through the
house myself and found many of thÂ« hid
den vases and pots, all of them being
sent at once to the police station. While
I feel positive that many of them woro
purchased by my wife, I do not want one
of thorn In my house. My wife Is in a
terrible condition., and I fear she will try
to commit suicide. I cannot imagine what
Is the trouble.".' â¢
8o far as the arrest of the slater la con
cerned, the police explain that Orr,de
manded that both women should be ac
cused, because they were both In the
house when hln stolen goods were discov
ered, and neither of them gave satisfac
tory explanations.

HAXF-FABE. ORDINANCE
IS PARTIALLY EVADED
Complaint wan made to Mayor Phelan
yesterday that the Sutter-street Railway
Company was not complying with the
terms of the ordinance providing for half
fares for school children recently passed
by the Board of .Supervisors. A lady giv
ing the name of Mrs. Hastings informed
his Honor. that the officials of the road
were imposing onerous conditions upon
pupils who desired to avofl themselves of
the half -fare privilege not specified in the
ordinance. ,
Mrs. Hastings, who has a son attending
the Grant School, alleges that pupils are
compelled to write their signatures in the
office of the. company, whereas the ordin
ance provides that the principals of the
schools shall certify to the correctness of
the signatures of pupils.
Another cause for complaint is that the
conductors on the, road have been In
structed not to accept the half- fare tick
ets from pupils who get on the car before
school is let out. As a consequence of
the company's, action pupils living along
the lines of â¢ the â¢ Sutter-street railway
are declining to take advantage of the
ordinance and are paying full fare. The
Mayor will call the matter to the atten
tion of the Board of Supervisors to ascer
tain if the ordinance is being violated,
and if so steps will be taken to compel
the line. to comply with Its provisions.
of the â¢women, is well-to-do, and so far as
the police can ascertain there was abso
lutely no reason why there should be
theft of such articles as have been found.
Owners Identify Their Property.
A number of pieces of pottery ', among
the vases and pots found at the Teeple
residence were identified to-day by the
owners. Miss Edna Shatter Orr, daughter
of J. K. Orr, found the jardinieres thac
had been stolen from their residence.
Mrs- A. M. Wilkinson, residing at 195
Eighth street, recognized several jars sho
had recently lest. From East Oakland
came H. Abrahamson, who identified sev
eral pieces of ornamental pottery that had
been stolen from his residence. Miss A.
C. Drynen found a large blue jar that wan
stolen a year and a half ago from her
home at 227 Tenth street. Mrs. T. A. Crel
lin secured a Japanese dwarf oak 'which
had been taken from her residence, 1361
Jackson street, and also recovered two
large Jardinieres that were removed from
the entrance to her home several months
ago.
Mrs. Thomas Hagan. who resides at 94$
Oak street, uncovered one large garden
pot which had been stolen from her resi
dence.
Former Mayor M. C. Chapman Identified
two large terra cotta pots that had
formerly stood on the front porch of hla
residence.
The police have no doubt that many
more will be Identified by the owners.
Detectives Are Mystified.
The detectives are as yet undecided as
to the way the thefts were accomplished.
Some of the Jars, tilled with earth,
weighed 140 pounds. That a slender wom
an of Mrs. Teeple' s physique could have
carried them off seems incredible to the
fiollce, who feel positive that If she were
he thief there must have been assistance
given in her strange marauding expedi
tions. . â¢
Teeple is practically exculpated by the
detectives, ' and as to actual connection
with the thefts Mra. McConnell Is not se
riously considered. Her actions in trying
to shield some one when the police in
vaded the residence yesterday were such
that she was jointly accused with her sis
ter.
' Teeple retained Attorney George E. da
Oolla to defend nis wife and sister. Ball
was furnished for their appearance In
court.
"Mrs. Teeple Is undoubtedly a klepto
maniac," said the attorney. "She had ac
cumulated these vases and Jars, many of
them. In her house as ornaments. Her
husband believed she bad purchased
them, and thinking "he had a fad for that
sort of thing made no objection. He knew
nothing of the ntuff that was hidden tn
the trunks, and It was not until after tha
disclosures of yesterday that ho gave any
thought to what might be In the cellar.
Then he uncovered everything he could
find to turn over to the pollen."
Acting Chief of Police Wilson said:
"This case la truly remarkable. The
woman could have had no Incentive to
steal. She does not tteem to have disposed
of any of the property to her own advan
tage. Much of It was burled away in a
cellar, where It could not be of use to
any - one. The detectives say that i Mrs.
Tcoplo always told her husband that the
Jardinieres, which she displayed about the
hquse, had been purchased. It Is one of
those cases that Rive the police and the
medical men something to ponder over."

Adding to Our Territory.
. The United States is steadily acquiring
land from the European powers.
The territory annexed is not gained by
conquest or ourchase.- It comes to Amer
ica in the form of. ballast, and for. the
most part in American ships.
I One thousand tons of Scotch soil were
imported into New York in one week a
short time ago. It came off the Allan
State line . steamer Laurentian. Scarcely
a week passes without a similar importa
tion by the boats of this or some other
line.' This soil is black and stony. It is
chosen for weight and not for its fertility.
It Is : probable that the seeds : of a great
many. Scotch 'plants are imported In this
It.is estimated 'that millions of.- tons of
European -soil has been â¢ imported and
dumped about New*York. Much. of this
is used: for "making land" about the har
bor. "* The soil, as well, as the people of
New :-York ; may be said to be growing
more Cosmopolitan every year.â Chicago

Middle States Leading.
News was also received that an organi
zation called the Village Union (Llenchuan
Hal) hasy risen in five districts lying north
of Paotingr. Inquiries made by the French
from Paoting have disclosed that the in
surgents, who have their headquarters at
Yenchow, number 20,000, mostly disbanded
soldiers and Boxers. They have Issued
circulars calling upon the throne to pay
no foreign indemnity.
The Chinese insurgents crossed the bor
der into Korea, but were driven back by
the Korean troops, the Chinese losing
twelve men. The number of men assem
bled at Antung is some 3000, and the In
habitants of Wlju are much perturbed,
being apprehensive of an eruption across
the Yalu. This Intelligence suggests that
there are two bodies of Insurgents. Fugi
tives arriving, in Chefu give serious ac
counts of the state of affairs. They rep
resent the whole of Shingklng as in a
state of unrest, even to the gates of
Moukden, and they declare that Russia
has not sufficient force to preserve order.
The Japanese Consul at Chefu in his re
port to the Government states that the
pirates who recently appeared along the
coast of Shangtung and Llaotung were
pursued by a Chinese Government trans
port and a number of them were decapi
tated by the Taotal of Chefu, and in con
sequence these places were liberated from
piratical depredations. The Russians have
dispatched a force from Halcheng to at
tack the Insurgents. ,
The Russian garrison in Fenchwang
does not seem to be sufficient to cope with
the movement, and reinforcements will
have to be sent from Port Arthur or
Moukden, an operation requiring some
time. A great number' of Chinese men
and women are reported to have fled from
Tatung to Chefu, the insurgents having
brought the former place within the
sphere of their operations. The rising in
the neighborhood of Fenchwangtlen Is
continually gaining strength, and it is be
lieved that there is practically no t gov
ernment in Manchuria.
The Russian forces are entirely Insuf
ficient to maintain '.:der In Southern Man
churia. At Antung, in the southeastern
part of Shlngking, the insurgents are
daily developing strength. They now num
ber several thousand and have possession
of Kiullen as well as Antung. The effects
of the disturbances are felt even in WIJu,
beyond the Manchurlan frontier. â¢
VICTORIA, B. ,C, July 26,-Advlces by
the steamer Duke of Fife from the Orient
include details of the rising in Manchuria.
Refugees from the affected district are
reaching Chefu, and the Japan Jklail says
they report the whole province of Shlng
king in a state of insurrection. Rebels are
pillaging, burning and killing around
Moukden. All the villages and hamlets
have been burned and hundreds of the
Inhabitants who offered resistance have
been killed. - : â¢

"The strike is not affecting the United
States Steel Corporation as seriously as
was expected by the Amalgamated Asso
ciation. The feeling of the leading offi
cials of the trust is that the strike will
not last long after the summer weathver is
passed. That this is the belief is indi
cated by the little effort that the com
pany is making to force their mills Into
operation. If the officials of the United
States Steel corporation seriously be
lieved that the strike was going to be a
long one they would undoubtedly have
made some organized effort, for break
ing the strike before this."
As viewed by manufacturers not inter
ested directly with the strike, the sit
uation was summed up to-day in this way:
Definite announcement that the officials
of the American Sheet Steel- Company
would start the Deweea-Wood mill in Mc-
Keesport as a non-union plant on Monday
reached the headquarters of the Amalga
mated Association to-day. The news was
received in silence. That the movement
would not be permitted to be made with
out a decided attempt to check it was
subsequently shown by a long and earnest
conference that took place during the
afternoon in President Shaffer's office.
This movement/ fighting fire with flre,
carried consternation into the ranks of
the strikers. The welders are highly skill
ed workmen, and without .their co-opera
tion the big plant will be closed down.
With them in line the plant will probably
keep on running as though nothing had
happened. It was Intimated to-night by
friends of the welders Uat they would
all sign the contracts.
It transpired to-day that late on Thurs
day evening 600 welders of the mills were
paid off and then taken Into the office of
the general superintendent, where they
were presented with individual contracts
to 'bo '.signed for at least a year. Some
demurred, while others signed the con
tracts.
PITTSBURG, July 26.â The National
Tube Works Company at McKeesport has
made an unexpected move Intended to
checkmate the Amalgamated Association.
Their skilled workmen have been asked to
sign Individual contracts to practically re
pudiate any labor union, and they have
been given but a short time to think it
over. It is understood that should they
not sign the contracts they will find their
positions vacant.'

HOW THE STRATTON LAW FELL
Bosses Caused Its Undoing Because
It Checkmated Them.
The primary election law guarantees
to the people of the city fair dealing at
the polls. It gives assurance that the
bosses and rowdies cannot win, as they
won last year, by stuffing and smashing
the ballot boxes. While honest men are
rejoicing in the protection which the law
affords, it is a good time to tell the true
story concerning the overthrow of the
Stratton primary law. In the first pri
mary election, August, 1899, under the
Stratton law, the bosses were defeated
and driven to the wall. When the lead
ing politicians of the push element saw
the power that the law placed in the
hands of the people they resolved to break
it down. In the law office of W. C. Van
Fleet the conspiracy was hatched to over
throw the Stratton act. Van Fleet, a
standing candidate for the Supreme bench,
is a confidential agent of W. F._ Herrin.
The purpose of the scheme hatched in
the law office of Van Fleet was to place
the machinery of . the . Republican party
organization -in the hands of Herrin. How
the Supreme Court was , induced to de
cide against the validity of the law is past
finding- out.- There is nothing in the de
cision to" enlighten the public or edify the
lawyers. r The Â¦ safeguards guaranteed to
the people were thrown overboard by the
Supreme Court on the eve of the election
FORTY-SECOND DISTRICT.
Bossism Denounced at a Meeting of
Citizens in, Golden Gate Hall.
The Republican Primary League Club of
the Forty-second Assembly District held
a meeting at Golden Gate'Hall last night.
R. B. Treat was the chairman of the even
ing and J. E. Slinkey acted as secretary.
In calling the. meeting to order Chair
man Treat said the principal aim- of the
club was to secure good municipal of
ficers. This was to be secured by sending
the best men to the primary conventions.
Heretofore the purity of the primary bal
lot was destroyed through the agency of
political cliques led by creatures known
as bosses. ' " Â¦ ."
"At the present time," he continued,'
"the party is divided into two factions,
one led by the bosses, tne other by men
',who desire that the best men in the city
should be selected to. fill the city offices.
To the latter faction this elubbelongs. Its
main object is to secure a clean, respecta
ble and pure city government. The other
club in this district is controlled by that
faction which is known to be in sympathy
with ; Boss -Kelly. The best Republicans
In. the city are with us,. and if < they go to
the polls- they will win the day. If they
will do their duty the day , of . the bosses
is over. -We may have a. hard fight in
this district, but in any event our faction
will have the support of /the best men in
the district. With their co-operation the
success of the battle is assured."
D. W. Burchard was then Introduced as
one of the speakers of the evening.' He
began with the statement that he was no
offlceseeker, but that he was desirous of
seeing a respectable municipal govern
ment. ' He spoke of the army of - tax
eaters who are maintained, fed and
clothed through the agency of machine
politics without offering anything In re
turn. : .
I. W. Lees called attention to the neces
sity of registration of voters. The mem
bership roll was then declared open and
was organized by representative citizens
to awaken public interest in the coming
municipal election and to bring out a largo
vote' at the primary election on Tuesday,
August 13, is carrying' out the purposes of
its founders. League clubs are estab
lished In every Assembly district except
ing the Forty-first. In that particular dis
trict the Central Republican Club, of
which Horace Davis is president, was in
the field as an anti-boss organization of
demonstrated strength when the league
was founded.
The enrollment of voters under the aus
pices of the league surpasses original esti
mates. Sixteen days remain for citizens
to enroll. In order that the triumph or
anti-boss citizenship should be decisive
and complete the league enrollment should
approximate 20,000 before August 13. A
large enrollment, and consequently a
large vote, will seal the doom of the Kel
ly-Gage boss alliance. Citizens can prop
erly rebuke State interference in local af
fairs by going to the polls and voting for
delegates placed in the field by clubs of
the Primary League. Citizens may rest
assured that the league has no candidates
to favor, and candidates who are engaged
in compromising with boss elements in
order to obtain friendly delegations should
be advised to show their true colors. They
should be admonished to train openly
with' Kelly and Crimmins or come out
squarely for the Republican Primary
League.
-The last lingering hope of the boss al
liance is a light vote at the primary. It
is obvious now that the boss vote will be
very light if material reinforcements are
not brought into action by Sam Rainey
and the Democratic push. The rooms of
the Kelly-Crimmins county committee are
practically deserted. Voters shun the
place. The camera of the photographer
tells the true story of apathy at boss
headquarters, and the truth is that the
Kelly-Gage alliance has no following to
speak of. All the signs point to utter de
feat of the tax looters. At the headquar
ters of the Republican Primary League
citizens meet and exchange views regard
ing contests in their respective districts.
Good men are not ashamed to train under
the banner of the league. During the
evening hours the league rooms are
thronged with earnest and enthusiastic
workers. The afterpoon attendance is
shown by the photographic reproduction.
Most of the talk about opposition to the
Republican Primary League is mere bluff.
It is known, however, that the bosses will
resort to every cunning scheme known to
the adroit in politics to effect compromise
with independent clubs. By resorting to
tactics of this kind the bosses hope to di
vide the elements in favor of clean gov
ernment. When the votes are counted
Kelly and his gang will claim every dele
gate elected by organizations outside of
the Republican Primary League.
and the bosses at once" seized the party |
reins. Where open, free and easy pri
maries were ordered the boxes were
stuffed by the bosses before the polls
were open. In districts where county or
Congressional committees could be relied
on to appoint boss | delegates to the con
vention even the forms of primary election
were disregarded. The result was the Re
publican State convention at Santa Cruz,
presided over by W. C. Van Fleet and
dominated by W. F. Herrin. The State
Central Committee created by Herrin was
Indorsed by Herrin and Van Fleet. Every
thing in sight was delivered to the allied
bosses. W. C. Van Fleet's subserviency
was so deplorably open and flagrant that
he could make no excuse or explanation
of his conduct. Herrin's ownership of
the committee was undisputed. Herrin
regarded the committee as his own agent,
and at the close of the campaign gave his
check for $4500 to pay the committee's
debts. - Doubtless he reasoned that the
railroad ought to pay the debt, as the
committee was appointed to do the rail
road's work. By reference to the records
of disbursements President C. M. Hays of
the' Southern Pacific can ascertain some
thing of Herrin's transactions â¢ in politics.
The allied bosses, are now giving circula
tion to the report that the owners of the
Southern Pacific have countermanded â¢ or
ders recently issued by the president of
the company and ; given Herrin special
dispensation to do politics in the same old
style at the same olfi'stand. .' ,:

er caliber begin to wish that they
had not interfered in the San
Francisco municipal contest. The
interference, which was designed
to save the Kelly-Crimmins. forces from
utter defeat at the hands of the Republi
can Primary League, promises to bring
on a general engagement in California
between the clean Republicans on one side
and the boss-tainted elements of the par
ty on the other. The battle Is extending
to interior and southern counties. Recent
events in the city convince leading Re
publicans who reside " elsewhere in ! the
State that the Kelly-Gage alliance was
created to do politics in the Senatorial
and Gubernatorial campaign of 1902. It is
rendered clear to the outside spectators
that the bosses are rallying in San Fran
cisco to gain possession ot the municipal
offices in order to use the patronage to
fasten boss rule on the State.
SENATOR BARD SPEAKS OUT.
Indorses Thomas Flint Jr. for Gover
nor â Favors Removal of -Lynch. --
The unwarranted and indecent intrusion
of the Republican State Committee in
local affairs practically opens the anti
boss State campaign. Senator Bard'Â«
manly attitude, as shown in the following
dispatch, is sure to be commended by
cood citizen*:
LOS ANGELES, July 26.â The issue between
T'nlted States Senators George C. Perkins and
Thomas R. Bard has been made, and it is
clear cut- and thoroughly understood by both.
The Junior Senator desires the removal of John
C Lynch, and the senior Senator, while he may
ultimately be brought around to the same way
of thinking. Is at present temporizing. In the
hope, apparently, that conditions may after a
time so change that both gentlemen may come
to his way of thinking.
Iroquois Club Discusses Trusts.
.The Iroquois Club last evening discuss
ed "Whether Government Ownership of
Public Utilities Would Remedy 'the Evils
of Trusts." ' This was argued pro and
con with vigor- . William M. j Cubery, who
opened for the affirmative, spoke of the
decision of Judge Slbss. He said. that 'he
was net taking any exception to the de
cision, but he thought that * there was
manifest impropriety in the' son of a mil
lionaire Hitting to decide a controversy
between the Interests of corporations and
the interests of labor. -
Leading representatives of .the Republi
can partyâ men of sound judgment and
high characterâ are signifying a readiness
to engage in the contest which the allied
bosses precipitated. Ex-Senator " R. N.
Now at Issue.
EX-SENATOR BULLA ; SPEAKS.
Defines. His Position in tie. Matters
"Senator Flint advises me that. he .will prob
ably enter the race, - and he. seems . pleased at
the assurances of friendship and support given
him during- "his recent visit to ' Los' Angeles.."
-"Senator Flint called on me 'yesterday, and -I
would be wanting in' gratitude if I did not al
low you to say for publication, that- my best
wlsl-es are with him in his efforts' to secure the
Republican nomination for.Governor. I do not,
however," desire to precipitate any .controversy
upon this subject, as in my oplnion.it is not
the province of a United States Senator to min
gle'offensively In such matters. -As- a Republi
can, however, who is anxious that his party
shall make no serious mistake, I can say that I
am thoroughly convinced 'that in , the nomina
tion of Senator Flint the party will not have
made a mistake, as he is clean. . able and In
every .way. fitted for the position. ... .
â¢ "I have personally investigated all of those
things," said the Senator, "and while Mr.
Lynch" Is now and for years has been active in
politics, hls^ methods, have been different from
those : pursued . by Mr. Kelly, and from what . I
know the' latter I have no hesitancy in in
dorsing Mr. Kelly to the Vrsiaent."
"Senator Perkins wants to. delay- the change
in the Internal Revenue., Collectprship,".- added
the Senator, "but I am In favor of deciding the
matter at once, in order that the' issue may not
become involved in next year's State campaign.
I shall aim. If it be possible, .not to interfere
actively in' the coming campaign."/ Continuing,
he eaid: ' ' . ' j "â¢ - â¢. '. .
the Republican primaries throughout the. State,
for In the event that Stephen Kelly is landed
high and dry, - the battle for Thomas Flint . Jr.
of San Benito. who desires to be the party" s
gubernatorial candidate next year, will -be con
sidered by his Los Angeles supporters as more
than half won; Should John C. Lynch, how
ever, remain where he is, Henry T. Gage will.
It is conceded by his opponents, havÂ«: gained a
point. Senator Bard said to-day:
"I have in the past usually been in accord
with Senator Perkins upon matters affecting
public nollcy. but In the present instance I do
not agree with Senator Perkins' Ideas that there
should be no changes of Federal officials in the
State at this time. ' ' â¢ â¢
"Believing, as I do, that for good and suffi
cient reasons there should be at least one
change.' I shall recommend to President McKln
ley the removal of John C. Lynch . as Collector
of Internal Revenue, and, the appointment In
his place of Stephen Kelly of San Bernardino. 1 '
Senator Bard's attention was- called to the
published statement that while John C. Lynch
is an active politician the same ' charge has
been made against Stephen Kelly. %. .
