just been advised that 'the English Gov

June 1 next. . . ' Â¦ ' ;
The Chicago concern has asked the Ag

it can render. It has pointed out that the
action of the .British Governmen.t is a
severe blow to American beef and cattle
exporters Tand producers and means not

by the sympathy which you show for its

that we are profoundly touched by the

the King of Italy has given to France by
sending your grand squadron here. I

Lessons Taught by" Big Guns.
While on board the Lepanto M. Loubet
discussed with the Duke of Genoa the in
crease and perfection of modern arma
ments, remarking that it would be a ter
rible responsibility to* provoke war. The
Duke of Genoa said: "You are right and
I think such visits as these are calculated
to render the relations between nations
more cordial."
M. Loubet and M. Delcasse spent half an
hour on board the submarine boat Gus

Italian demonstration the Temps to-night,
now that the speech-making is dver, puts
the situation In a clear light with the fol
lowing remarks:
"The words pronounced by M. Loubet
and the Duke of Genoa, especially the tele
grams exchanged between M. Loubet and
the King of Italy, stamp the proceedings
at Toulon with their true diplomatic sig
nificance. France and Italy yesterday
gave one another officially the title of
friends, which accords so well with the
fraternity of their genius and blood. This
la an event which must not be distorted
nor harshly interpreted. But there is lit
tle risk of exaggerating its importance,
which, taking everything into considera
tion, is considerable. Both Italy and
France have greatly changed since the
time of Bismarck and Crispi. We cannot
yet say what fruits yesterday will bring
forth, but we augur much therefrom."
The Journal des Debats says the events
at Toulon will leave a happy 6ouvenlr in
the history of France and Italy, and their
rapprochement will henceforth rank as an
established, avowed and proclaimed fact.
Pacific Sentiments of Powers.
M. Hanotaux. the former Minister of
Foreign Affairs, In an Interview is quoted
as expressing the opinion that the Toulon
demonstrations were a valuable Indica
tion of the pacific sentiments animating
the powers. The visit of the Italian squad
ron marks the end of a painful period of
terEion, Jn the relations between France
end Itaiy and points to an evolution of
the sentiments of the Italian Government
toward France.
At the luncheon on board the Lepanto,
the flagship of the Italian fleet, to-day,
the brilliant function was held on "*~ gun

Governor Hunt Hnds No Further
Necessity for It in Shoshone

BOISE, Idaho,- April 11.â Governor Hunt
to-day issued a proclamation abolishing
martial law in Shoshone County. He re
cites the circumstances under which mar
tial'law was proclaimed there and sets
forth that he has recently made a per

prosperous and peaceful. .
"Martial law," he says,. "Is the spirit of

SANTA- BARBARA, April ll.-The .rec
ord of disaster on the new coast railroad
was appallingly Increased to-night, 1 when
a light engine, racing down to the track
toward this city to connect with a .wait
ing train, left the rails at a- dangerous
curve and toppled over a flfty-foot em
bankment, carrying engineer and fire
man to horrible death.- The unfortunate
engineer was Elmer Balloo and the name
of his companion In the cab was Perry. .
The disaster occurred at 7:20 o'clock.
Engine 1446 was on its . way here to con
nect with No. 2 train for the run south
ward. It had no cars attached and the
only persons aboard were the two men
in the cab.
When nearlng Miramar, a small sta
tion about four miles north of Santa
jfiarbara, the engine was obliged to swing
around a sharp : curve before reaching a
high trestle. What caused the engine to
leave the track has not been determined,
but It Is thought that the roadbed gave
way near the trestlework.

Germany Is Preparing lor

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N
W.. WASHINGTON, April 11.âInforma
tion received by the State Department
shows a decided disinclination on the part
of some of the powers to. accept the sug
gestion of this Government that they ma
terially reduce their claims for Indemnity
against China. Special Commissioner
Rocbhill has earnestly pressed hla col
leagues to urge their governments to be
more moderate, but It is apparent to offi
cials here that his representations will
likely have little effect. Germany is In
sisting upon her pound of flesh. She has
announced her purpose to require pay
ment of every ounce she has demanded.
It will therefore be necessary for Special
Commissioner Rockhill to form a diplo
matic combination against her in the hope
that she will abandon the extreme posi
tion she has taken. While this was pos
sible on the question of punishments it
â¢ does not seem so easy of accomplishment
on the question of indemnity In view of
the exorbitant claims which nearly all the
powers have filed.
. May Remain Permanently..',^^
If the powers Insist upon the payment
of an indemnity such as has been de
manded the authorities say that it will
be almost impossible for the Chinese Gov
ernment to satisfy It. There has been
some discussion In offlelal and diplomatic
quarters as to the methods to be adopted
to Induce China to guarantee payment of
the claims. It was pointed out to-day
that China's entire commerce before the
Boxer revolt was valued at only $260,000,
000 and her trade at present has decreased
;tpÂ«ane::half But the customs
revenues must pay the expenses of collec
tion and are pledged for certain loans. It
is conceded, that the suggestion of Prince
Chlng and LI Hung Chang that the cus
toms duties be Increased must be adopted.
The powers will probably appoint a com
mission to supervise the collection.
If Germany stands by her declaration to
retain troops In China until the Indemnity
is paid the authorities say that this will
mean that, she will remain permanently.
For this reason they are endeavoring to
induce the powers to reduce their, claims
so that payment can be made much more
expedltlously by the Chinese Government.

ex-treasurer of . the Phlllppirfe "govern
ment/' captured at the same time General
Funston made , prisoner of their chief,
were liberated to-day. .
Aguinaldo will probably be removed in
a few days to a private house In the vicin
ity of Malacanan, where he will be pro
visionally held as prisoner under guard.
It is said Aguinaldo fears the vengeance
of the friends of General" Luna, who was
assassinated by order of Aguinaldo, and
the authorities are afraid to let him out
of their hands. The authorities refuse to
say a word on the subject and their ac
tions are not explained; Â¦
Aguinaldo Is said to have prepared a
brief manifesto to the' Filipinos, in which
he advises them to submit, and gives his
reasons for doing so. . ' He ; acknowledges
the Incapacity of the Filipinos to govern
themselves, and advises their . leaders as
for their best interest to give in. This
manifesto is being translated into Taga
log, Spanish and English, but it is not
known whether it has as yet been signed
by Aguinaldo. :
Senor Buencamino, one of the leaders
of the Federal party, announces that he
intends to renounce politics. .He refuses
to call and see Aguinaldo. Senor. Paterno,
the head of the new Autonomy . party,
promises to organize a new party after
the conclusion , of peace. The object of
this party will be to â¢ secure a territorial
form of government.- . ' :

WASHINGTON, April 11.â Preparations
are making for quite an extensive and
Important test of fleld 5 gtins . . at
Bandy Hook some time in May.* At pres
ent the army is not well equipped with
fleld guns, compared with other nations,
and the War Department wishes to obtain
the very best guns possible for the equip
ment of this Important branch'; of the
service. The tests will be Under the di
rection of the Board of Ordnance and
Fortifications. The board, not, only will
test such guns as may be presented . by
manufacturers and inventors, but It is ex
pected that the new gun modeled on the
plan of French fleld guns and construct
ed under the direction of the Board of
Ordnance and Fortifications will be
tested. '
The plans for this gun were obtained
by an army officer who was sent abroad
last summer and who claimed to have
secured complete details of this .-gun',
which artillery experts have asserted is
the best in the world.
The mechanism of this gun has been
concealed and its secret carefully guard- '
ed by the French Government. The report
that the United States army has ob
tained the plans of the French gun caused
considerable comment at the time it was ;
xnade public, and since then the procedure
of the department with reference to the
gun have been watched with Interest
by ordnance experts. The French Gov
ernment has not guarded more carefully
the mechanism of its gun than the Board
of Ordnance has the making- of the new
fleld gun whicn is expected to be tested
in May.
PROTEST AGAINST
SCHOOL LAWS
Mgr. Conaty Claims Educa
tional Legislation Is Un
fair to Catholics.
CHICAGO. April 1Lâ Educational legis
lation in the United States was attacked
to-day in the discussions at the Roman
Catholic educational conference as beiny
unfair, partial rjid prejudicial to the
rights of individuals and to religious in
stitutions in the tendency of the laws to
absolute state control o? schools.
The paper on "Educational Legislation
in the United States," which brought out
the discussion, was read by Rev. James
P. Fagin, S. J., vice president of George
town University.
Professor E. J. Jtyan, A.M.. of Mount
St. Mary's College, Emmettsburg, Md.,
read a paper on "Teaching of English in,
College," in which he pleaded for the
purity and thoroughness of the language.
Speakers a\ the afternoon session de;
-clared that modern educational legislation
threatened the life of the parochial schools
system. All this class of legislative action,
they said, serio'isly discriminated against
the church schools and every other system
of education which seeks to combine re
ligious training with learning. It was ar
gued that under existing conditions Cath
olics were compelled to pay taxes for the
support of public schools which their
children do not attend. It was insisted
that the state should recognize Catholic
schools on the same basis as the other
educational institutions to which financial
assistance is
Monsignor Conaty- said: "We are not
here by sufferance, but we are here ia
American citizens demanding our rights.
We are not asking for favor; all we want
is justice. We want recognition as citi
zens and taxpaj-ers in school affairs. We
believe that no true Â«*ducation is possible
without religious instruction and we have
a right to insist upon our demands. Thers
is no doubt that nearly ail the educational
lairs enacted by the States are aimed at
the Catholic school system. It is our duty
both to ourselves and our people to pro
test and continue protesting until our ab
jections are heeded."
Father Dowlins: of the Omaha Univer
sity expressed the fear that Catholics had
in the past not kept In close touch with
the improved methods advocated by non
sectarian institutions. They failed to pre
sent their arguments to the mass of the
people by means of the newspapers, mag
azines and other publications. -

Son sh? desires the insertion of articles

There is a disposition in quarters not

MARIN RECORDER'S LABOR
TERMINATED BY DEATH
THB LATE JUDGE GARDNER,
WHO WAS MARIN COUNTY'S
RECORDER. â¢"
SAN RAFAEL. April 1Lâ One of
the oldest residents of this coun
ty, Judge Edwin Gardner, died at
his home In this city to-day after
an illness of several weeks. For
the past two years he had served the peo
ple as Recorder of this city, and at the
election held here last Monday the people
testified their appreciation of him by re
electing, him. notwithstanding the fact
that a desperate fight was made for the
office by other candidates. The belief that
hÂ© might get well was all the people re
quired, and the news of his re-election
was carried to what proved to be his
deathbed.
Â¦ Judge Gardner was a native of New
Tork and â¬S vears of age. He came to
this State in 1852 and settled in this coun
ty. Later he engaged In mining in Placer
County, but kept his home here. In 1869
he took a trip East to visit his old home.
In 1876 he was elected Justice of the Peace
for San Rafael Township, and this office
he held until this city incorporated, when
he was elected City Recorder. For many
years he has served as Deputy County
Assessor. At the time of his death he
-was also Deputy State Dairy Inspector.
In the. early days the Judge settled on
a piece of Government land below Corte
Madera and afterward erected a house
that was a mansion in its time. In com
monÂ«*rtth other settlers he lost his ranch,
it being Swallowed in a Spanish grant.
- After nearly half a century's residence
hf re Judge Gardner died without an en
emy; A jjÂ£ep .sense of justice and a strong
moral courage were features in his
character. Kind words and universal
sorrow to-day testify how deeply the peo
ple appreciated his sterling qualities. Two
daughters and a son survive him. There

,. REDDING, April 11.â The plaintiff will
receive the decision in the now famous
case of the Balaklala Mining Company
against the Iron Mountain Investment
Company. "While no decision was gitan at
the conclusion of the trial to-day Superior
Judge Edward Sweeny announced from
the bench that the plaintiff was entitled
to a decision, 'but upon request of its at
torney' the defendant" corporation was
allowed ten days in . which to file new
briefs. â¢
The mining gase has attracted attention
throughout the State. The best of im
ported legal talent was here to represent
the different contestants. The Iron Moun
tain Investment Company is the de
velopment branch of the Mountain Copper
Company. It secured a six months bond
in the sum of $200,000 on the large
Balaklala copper property which adjoins
the Iron Mountain mine on the north. It
explored the ore body and then secured
a month's extension of option. â¢ â¢
. Toward the close of the month It be
gan negotiations for a new bond in order
to further investigate the property. Let
ters passed and at the last moment of
grace a telephone message to San Fran
cisco announced that the $15,000 additional
required, under the proposed new bond
would-be paid and a second option for
$200,000 taken. Â¦ â¢ .-
C. A. Malm of the plaintiff corporation
told the people they were too late. It is
understood his company has other buyers
in view. The . Iron Mountain Company
kept possession of the mine and the Bal
aklala people br-ought suit for recovery
and for $50,000 damages. At the trial the
defendant contended the letters that
passed to and fro regarding a second bond
form in themselves a contract but Judge
Sweeny will hold otherwise. â¢â¢
No evidence was adduced showing dam
age, so that point will not be connected
with the Judgment.

LODI, April 10.â The domestic difficul
ties in the household of "W. H. Spring
field, which have furnished material for
sensational publications in various part-?
of the country, are again' to the fo-e.
There is now on file In the Superior
Court of San Joaquin County a suit
brought by Mrs. Sarah F. Springfield
against her niece. Miss Mary France*
Kershaw for $5000 damages # to soothe the
pain of an alleged alienation of her hus
band's affections!
Since last Friday nothing has been seen
of Springfield in Lodl. He had been ca-
ing for the Kershaw orchard and sud
denly, disappeared. Miss Kershaw de
clares she does not know of the man's
whereabouts, but feels satisfied that ne
will not return to Lodi.
The complaint sets forth that in the
month of May, 1899, at Centerville, Pa.,
while Mrs. Springfield and her husband
were happily living together, Miss Ker
shaw visited their home for the purpose
of alienating the affections of the hus
band and winning them, for herself, and
that she succeeded in doing so. The
complaint continues: -" >"
In pursuance of her wrongful purpose de
fendant remained In the company of plaintiff's
husband against the expressed will and wish
of plaintiff, and in the hearing- and presence
of plaintiff made love to her said husband,
and permitted him to fondle and kiss her, and
wrongfully continued to do so in the presence
and hearing of plaintiff until' the month of
July, 1900, at Rawllngs. State of Wyoming,
where defendant, still wrongfully contriving
and Intending to injure plaintiff and to de
prive her . of the society, comfort and assist
ance of her said husband,' maliciously enticed
him away from plaintiff and Induced him to
accompany her to her cwn residence at | Lodi,
San Joaquin County, State of California, and
ever since has there detained and harbored
him. the said Springfield, against the will and
wish and without the consent of plaintiff. ,.
Mrs. Springfield Is steadily employed
here as a dressmaker, and says she will
remain until the suit against her niece
is decided. Springfield's Â¦> two sons I are
with Miss Kershaw on the neat little fruit
ranch at Woodbridge.

SAN RAFAEL, April 11.â A novel^pro'
ceeding was commenced in the Superior
Court here to-day. â¢ Peter Moran,, an old
resident of thl3 county, 'filed an applica
tion to be 'appointed the guardian of his
daughter. Margret Moran, alleging in" his
application that Miss Moran 'is an in
competent person and not capable of tak
ing care of her property. ' ' "I
Behind the simple wording of the pa
pers filed to-day is an interesting, story.
For years Peter Moran has , conducted a
wayside house and small ranch on. the
road some miles above" this city. His
daughter Margaret, or Maggie, as she
was called, lived with him.i His .son
Nicholas left home and made hfs way '.n
the world, becoming in time an eng^eer
on the Denver & Rio Grande .Ra'.iroad,
running out of E>enver.\ Nick was "much
older than Maggie and after the^Ieath of
the mother he took a. renewed interest
in his little sister. One day several years
ago Nick Moran met his d^ath in a wash-'
out some miles past Denver. â¢Â¦-.-, . Â¦
Shortly after his death It- was found
that he had insured his life in favor of his
sister, Maggie, to the amount of over $5000.
Being of age Miss Moran in- due time col
lected the money and then/ began the
change in her life, Â¦ which culminated* in
the action of he*r father to-day.- Upon re
ceiving her money, ranch life with its
chicken feeding became so irksome that
Miss Margaret departed from her home
and sought the luxury afforded guests
at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.
The story of her life and. dwindling for
tune on her mbre exr>ensive walk in life
would fill a book if all is true that rumor
says. I Trips up and Jown the coast in
state, auiet jaunts toward the East â In
fact, the Joyous life of an heiress whose
purse -the depths of "vhich no hand could
reach seemed to be the portion of this
farmer's girl. Wherever she went her am
bition seemed to be to create the impres
sion that she possessed vast wealth. "Wait
ers were tipped with a lavish hand and
carriages waited at her call. _
About a year &go she met Â¦ W. F. "War
burton, who is now in Jail awaiting trial
for the murder of Matthew Reilly last
January. She has fr&quently called upon
him in Jail and gossip has seized upon thia
fact to say that there is some tender feel
ing between them. This is not believed,
however, by those who claim to know.
Miss Moran is nbw at her father's ranch
In his custody and a small portion of the
legacy Is supposed to repose in a . local
bank. It is to save this that her much
respected father has taken to-day's step.
J. W. Cochrane, the father's attorney,
said to-night that he did not believe Miss
Moran -would contest the action.

Fresh from the land of orange blossoms
and a smiling sun that blisters -in the
summertime, a dozen Orangemen in, base
ball clothes, a Jubilant manager, a special
commissioner from the Los Angeles Her
ald to report. the diamond antics of the
southern team while in" this city; and a
small bunch of perfervid fanatics took
tLeir respective places in the Recreation
grounds yesterday afternoon for the first
diamond onslaught between the local team
and the visitors. The men from the south
cashed their tickets and Henry Harris
went broke on the block.
The Los Angeles nine has some new
faces and some old ones. They play good
ball In the field and some of them know
when and how to swing the stick. Oscar
Jones, the twirling wonder of the south,
was in the box for five innings and all the
local ew&ttere could muster off his deliv

Iho local team did not play even fair
ball yesterday. Holland in left field
dropped a fly that resulted in two runs,'
and the best of the local stickmen vi
ciously fanned the air. But this may re
dound to Oscar Jones' credit and not re
flect bo much upon the Hanxmen.
The first inning brought the lungs of
the Los Angeles sympathizers into free
play. A questionable decision by the um
pirÂ« pet them to noisy speech-making and
threats full of danger to the man who
tells about balls and strikes. On one oc
casion a Btrident youth from below the
7ehachapl asked for half the umpire. He
was baseball mad and expressed himself
accordingly.
In the first inning Los Angeles got a
comfortable lead of three runs, only to
find the locals on the touching creep soon
'after. But the third inning was a bad one
for Iburg and others of the local team
and when it ended the Scoreboard read 6
to 2. San Francisco came back In the
fourth with a couple, and that was the
sad ending of run-making for them. The

as LJpton has given up the idea of taking
the Shamrock I across the Atlantic as a
racing partner for the Shamrock II for
preliminary trials In American waters.
Experts who have seen the- new Sham

Shamrock would never be able to push
her in a windward race. The Shamrock

NOT INITIATED
Beylard Fails to Appear at
Meeting of Hackmen's
" Union.
A Coroner's Jury decided yesterday that
Aileen. J. Sutliff of 1912 Central avenue
died of tubercular peritonitis, "hastened
by exposure and neglect." ,
The witnesses who convinced the jury
that the little four-year-old girl had been
maltreated and unnecessarily exposed to
the rigpr of the weather were Mrs. Bessie
Halpin,* Mrs. Ray Schmidt, Mrs. Chad
bourne, Mrs. Bolin, Mrs. Martin, Mrs.
Clements and indirectly Officer H. Mc-
Murray and Beverly Hughes.
The women, who are neighbors of the
Sutliff s on Central avenue, told how they
had seen little Aileen in the Sutliff back
yard from early morning until sunset "in
all kinds of weather," except rainy, and
clad only in light, washable goods. Mrs.
Chadbourne 1 of 1914 Central avenue said
that her little girl told her that Aileen
had informed -her that she (Alleen> was
obliged to remain in the back yard be
cause her mother, would not let her re
main indoors. The witness often saw the
child digging in the "ash barrel for pieces
of bread. She had seen the child in the
yard as late as 5 o'clock in the afternoon
in cold, wintry weather. She also saw
Alleen's face on several occasions bearing
marks of scratches and bruises.
Other witnesses saw Mrs. Sutliff beat
the child in the back with her. clenched
lists until the littlo one fell on -the steps
and the father carried her into the. house.
Mrs. Ray Schmidt of 1914% Central ave
nue i told about the child being exposed
and of having seen her eat dry bread out
of the ash barrel with evident relish.
Officer McMurrayof the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children nar
rated a visit by himself to the Sutliff res
idence last July, neighbors having com
plained that Aileen was being beaten and
neglected. Mrs. Sutliff would not allow
him to enter the house, but spoke to him
through a window.. .
Mrs. Sutliff went on the stand and de
nied all the charges. ; Aileen, she said,
used to go into the. back yard immedi
ately .after breakfast of her own ! volition
and was never forced to remain there. It
was a sunny yard. Some of Aileen's. sis
ters threw Aileen's bread into the ash
barrel on one occasion and she picked it
out and ate It. The bruises on the child
were produced by falls. The witness ad
mitted that she had beaten Â¦ Aileen â¢ when
ever s.he was bad or disobedient, and then
only slapped or spanked her with the bare
hand. Mrs. > Sutliff , denied - having told
Mrs. Halpin that she doubted that Aileen
was her child, -because Â¦Â¦ when- she was in
the maternity hospital at the time Aileen
was. born* several babies were mixed up.
The fact of the matter was, she said, that
the babies got mixed up by a green nurse,
but the mistake .was rectified shortly aft
erward. She denied that -' she had been
other than a -kind mother to Aileen and
the rest of her children. . . ' Â¦

Of the antecedents of â¢ the Bricks but
little is knbwn. They came here from
Washington. D. C, about the time the
war broke out and started the small place
on Greenwich street. . The original firm
name was Brick & Rubensteln, and ap
parently Interested in the affair were A.
Weinberg and Morris Brick. They did a
big business with mustered-out soldiers,
and reaped a rich harvest. â¢ Later, Abra
ham Brick,, the head of the/ firm, took
apartments at the Hotel Mlramar, where
he still resides . and Â¦ is now watched by

Mrs. Brick, supported on either side by
her husband and brother-in-law, walked
out of the bank vaults just "five minutes
before Attorney Napthaly, a deputy
sheriff and the writ of attachment ar
rived. Now the creditors are guessing
what disposition ''has been made of the
money, pending the new civil and possible
criminal complications that will follow.
Attorney Napthaly went out to the City
Hall yesterday to get a writ of attach
ment and Mrs. Brick went to the bank in
extreme haste to get the money, but for
got her key. Her husband had a dupli
cate one, the box was opened and the
money taken out.
This tale of woe was repeated to each
creditor In turn, but an Investigation was
set on foot, which, it Is claimed, led to
the discovery that Brick, Instead of being
financially blanketed, had stowed away
the proceeds of his sales. Curtin's
agency . was engaged to find out some
thing about him and his actions. By
means of a decoy letter It was ascertained
that Mrs. Brick had a large amount of
money in the vaults of the Columbian
Bank. . Â¦
When Brick went to collect money from
members of the Thirtieth Infantry, re
cently discharged, he was - treated to a
blanket ascension. He claimed that dur

a large amount of money, previously col
lected, and that the discharged soldiers
ran off with it as fast as It fell from his
pockets.

Yesterday's proceedings - In the trial of

the witness stand. Louis Lock acted as
Interpreter. The evidence of the Chinese

he was engaged in the kitcen of the Wind
sor Hotel and between 1 and 2 p. m. was
under the eheds, peeling potatoes. The
witness told how Glaze had passed from
the old bakery to the kitchen and then
en me back in a hurried manner to the
bakery and entered it. The witness stated
that as soon- as Glaze had entered the
bakery the sound of shots was heard.
"I looked into the room." said Ah Fong,
"but if was full of smoke. Then Glaze
came out. He had a pistol In his hand
and I saw cartridges fall to the ground.
He then went into the kitchen and
I did not see him again. I continued my
work for a few minutes and then went
into the bakery and through the kitchen.
I saw Trewhella's body lying on the steps.
I was frightened and ran up to my room.
Then 1 came down again and saw lots of
people running up to the kitchen."
Morley McKimm, employed at the Wind
por en the day of the shooting, testified
that he was in the rear of the hotel on
the day in question, when he heard the
sound of shots. Witness told of how he

He described Glaze as being "calm and
collected" and as being "in his usual
manner." The witness further told how

Policeman Barry Arrests Glaze.
Police Officer N. J. Barry testified that
on January 14 he was on .duty at Market
and Powell streets. He said that two men
came up to him shortly after 2 p. m., and
that cne of them said that "he had taken
a shot at a man."
"I thought that he meant he had punched
a man," said Barry, "and at first did not
realize what he meant. Then he told me
that he had shot his partner at the "Wind
sor Hotel. He said that five shots had
been fired. I took him to the hotel and
found an excited crowd there. I learned
that a man was â¢wounded and telephoned
for an ambulance. Then I took Glaze to
the City Hall. He asked me not to take
him in the patrol wagon and we jumped
on a car and rode out. He talked to me
on the car and said he "had to do it or
this man would ruin him and his family.'
He did not mention Trewhella's name, but
referred to him as his 'partner.' He told
me that his stepson, Shelly, had the pistol.
I asked him if his partner had a weapon
end he said he did not know. I asked
Glaze if he had any friends, who would see
that no weapon was removed from the
man's body if there was one on it, and he
paid he did not know. Then I asked him
If the wounded man had any friends who
rnigrht remove a weapon from his person
and Glaze said again that he did not
know. After I had turned Glaze over to
the prison-keeper I went to the Receiving
Hospital and learned that the man who
had been shot was dead. I went to the
hotel and secured the pistol and cartridges
from Shelly, stepson of Glaze. He told
me that he had received the weapon from
Glaze."
On cross-examination the witness stated
that Glaze had given himself up and had
gone to the City Hall without any resist
ance. The witness also said that Glaze
had stated that Trewhella had advanced
in a threatening manner when he (Glaze)
had approached him. .

The board of trustees is composed of

Charles R. Bishop, William B. Hooper and
S. Prentiss Smith. . . ; . , .
At present there are 165 children in the
asylum, of whom severity-two are girls
and ninety-three bovs. . The cash receipts
for 1900 were $34,845 66, and the expendi
tures were S75S62 less than that amount.
Expenses included the building of a new
steam laundry. Gifts aggregating nearly
$6000 were made to the asylum last Christ
mas. Â¦ Â¦- ' ' '.;-' ' Â¦;, > .,Â¦Â¦-. . Â¦ . . Â¦
During the existence of the asylum 3520
children have been sheltered and educated
in it and have gone out through its por
tals to lead in the main useful lives.
Additions to the building were made in
1859 and 1862. The main wing, begun in
1862, was the gift of the Sansome Hook
and I^adder Company, made on the dis
banding of that organization of volunteer
firemen. The ground for that wing was
given by James Lick. Â¦;Â¦.-.
All gifts to the institution have â¢ been
carefully preserved intact, only- the.in
come being- used, and in consequence a
considerable endowment j fund has â¢ been
collected. The present managers and
trustees feel that the wisdom of those first
in control made the institution what it is.
' The present site, on Haight street! be
tween Lasruna: and Buchanan, was pur
chased from the city February 28, ' 1853,
for the nominal sum of $100. A solid foun
dation was found beneath the sand of the
j'hills that formed the site, stone was qtiar
ried near by and a building begun whldh
now forms the center of the substantial
main structure. It was completed in
March, 1854, and the sixteen children : of
the asylum were moved into it. . -
Donations were solicited and â¢ a cottage
in "Happy Valley," now near Natoma and
Second streets, was occupied as an asy
lum March 19. Five boys and four girls
were the first inmates and a Mrs. Wilson
was matron. In the following December
the asylum was moved to a house on Fol
som street, near Second. .
The San Francisco Protestant Orphan
Asylum was actually founded February
10, 1851, when a constitution was adopted
and a board of managers elected. This
action followed a preliminary meeting at
the First Presbyterian Church on Stock
ton street January 31. This was the in
auguration of the first organized charity
in California, ...
Fifty Years of Noble Effort.
Refreshments were served at tables at
one end Â¦ of Â¦ the schoolroom during and
following the children's songs. Mrs. Hor
ace Davis had immediate charge of that
portion of the entertainment.
The boys were dressed in their best suits
and the girls from the smallest tots up to
those of 14 and even older wore their neat
est dresses. Â¦â¢ Collectively they presented
as pretty a picture of happy, healthy
childhood as one need long to see, and
guests departing beamed with happiness
and gratitude that such an institution ex
ists to make the present bright and the
future hopeful for unfortunate children,
whom death has deprived of parents.
During the afternoon the children sang
choruses and solos and marching songs
and went through the simple dances in
the schoolroom for the entertainment of
the visitors. The programme began with
kindergarten songs and ended with a duet,
"Jerusalem," by two of the older boys,
the older boys and girls joining in the
chorus. It was excellently done, the ef
fect approaching that of the singing of
picked and trained boy choristers.
The hearts of the women managers were
gladdened early in the day by the arrival
of a beautiful landscape-, daintily framed,
the gift of Keith. It was hung in the
schoolroom.
Keith Makes a Gift.
' The members of the board of manage
ment and the. matron,' Mrs. E. A. Mc-
Near, received the guests. The managers
present were the following named:
Mrs. William Alvord, president; Mrs.
William Ashburner, first vice president;
Mrs. C. O. Gerberding,' second vice presi
dent; Mrs. Kirkham Wright, treasurer;
Mrs. Frederick MacCrellish, . secretary;
Mrs. Albert ' T. Spotts, assistant secre
tary; Miss Agnes Center, Mrs.- Horace

present, is traveling In Europe.
< Visitors were shown the building from
cellar to garret. Evidence of excellent
system in management, scrupulous clean
liness and" wholesomeness of irifluence was
to be seen everywhere. The nursery, the
kindergarten,- sewing rooms, kitchen,
storerooms, dining rooms, dormitories
and the infirmary on the . top . floor
were all inspected with interest by the
guests. One lone little tot, sick in the in
firmary, was the oiily visible evidence that
the children cared for by the institution
ever have ills.;.
The rooms' of the asylum, presented their
usual appearance, except that the or
dinary routine was suspended. Flowers
brightened the reception room and flam
ing bunches of popples lent color to corri
dors and dormitories.
The fiftieth anniversary of the founding
of the San Francisco Protestant Orphan
Asylum was celebrated yesterday, after
noon. I . The institution and the children
were in gaga, day attire and hundreds of
friends were received between the hours
of 3 and 5 o'clock. : 'â¢.

1^ , 718 Market ; Street.A TOO SERIOUS KAISER.
Â¥ /OAISER WILLIAM is unquestionably^the mo3t
|\ forcefu^ monarch of thctime. He is, indeed, in
..." *Â¦ personality as well as by his office, one of the
foremost men of Europe., Yet there are times when
he talks more like a spoiled child or a sulky barbarian
than like an enlightened statesman or a stalwart leader
of men. He had a fine chance to makea display of
personal courage and kingly confidence in his people
after the assault made upon him by* the crazy fool who
threw a piece of gas pipe at him, wounding him in the
head, but instead of making good use of the occasion
he has made the worst possible use of it.
We learn' from Berlin that for a- time after the
assault was committed the Kaiser shut himself. in' his
palace and talked about his reliance upon his brave
guards and upon the duly of the army to protect the
imperial house should a mutinous and ungrateful pop
ulace rise' in rebellion and insurrection, as it did
He is reported to have said: "A hand from out of
the people' was recently raised against me, to rriyin-
That was bad enough surely, . but he went on to
make matters worse. Berlin dispatches report that
after the healing of his wound, which; after all,* was not
very, serious, the Kaiser went to the barracks of the
Potsdam garrison, where he summoned the First Reg
iment of Foot Guards and, after taking extraordinary
precautions to prevent sny representative of the press
or other, civilian obtaining knowledge of his remarks,
he delivered a speech, which,; leaking out from ones
source or another, has had the effect of irritating even
the most loyal of his civilian subjects.
Two interesting local gentlemen nave" gone to law
and demand that, under, an' antique, discredited title,
they be given . property involving one-third of â¢ San
Francisco. They have probably" forgotten the fact
that the first day of April has passed and the Commis
sioners of Insanity are still in session.

THE LESSON OF THE ELECTIONS.
WHEN the reports came of the successes of the
in 'the recent city elections in Chi
cago, and St. Louis The Call pointed out that
the' results., were Mue not so much to any increased
strength in "trie. Democratic party as to.dissessibris
among Republicans. .That view of the case has been
confirmed by a statement' of Mr. .Wells, trie gold bug
Democrat, who has been â¢ elected Mayor in St.
Louis, that his success was .due mainly to "Repub
lican defection in North and South St. Louis, hitherto
Republican* strongholds."/; V\ St 1 - !Â¦';'Â¦' . â¢
.It is gratifying to note that in Eastern cities where
"municipal elections are to be held this fall the Repub
licans have been studying the lessons taught by the
defeat of Republican candidates in the -cities named
and are, drawing profitable lessons from' them!- Now
there can be.no doubt as' to what the lessons teach;
Republican success is dependent upon the practice of
horiest'. politics "within; the' party. If there be any sus"-'
picion of ;bbss '' rule or corporation- rule in , a Repub
lican convention it is a 'foregone "conclusion that â¢ a
large number" of the most earnest ' men in.the local
party will refuse; to support the ticket. Democracy
may win under such domination, but Republicanism
cannot. . ; Â¦ - '. -
i That -plain; moral applies to San Francisco as well
as. 1 to. other cities. There is now every prospect of a
sweeping Republican victory, in this city at the com
ing municipal election,- and the promise of the -time
can be blighted ohlyiiy the appearance in Republican
councils and conventions' of that class; of bosses who
disgusted Republicans ir'St. Louis and Chicago. The
election is; not, too far off to makY it worth while to
begin studying the situation now. .'Anything in t'ne
way of r dissension, among- Republican voters <at the
municipal election : will t>e in" the' nature of a public
calamity, so all members ''pi "the; party) who are ear
nestly desirous of providing the city and county with
a good and Â¦ effective administration 1 should resolve
that _when the campaign opens they will' be found
ready, to enter upon all political duties Â¦ imposed by
civic"' patriotism, so as to assure San Francisco Re
Â¦pubHcanism a clean convention, a; clean ticket 'and a
clean sweep at the polls.- ' : ' â¢''"-".:'' " "
Carnegie's prompt denial of the report that he is
to endow an international theater for the production
of legitimate drama may be taken as proof that while
he has millions to give away he has no money to burn.
HELP THE EPWORTH LEAGUE.
ONE of the largest gatherings of young men and
women that ever assembled in t the United
States will be seen in San Francisco when- the
Epworth League opens its- international convention
next July. The gathering 'so far as can be foreseen
at this time will be one of the most notable events of
th- year on the Pacific Coast. It will not only attract
to California the attention of the entire reading public
ci the United States while the convention lasts, but it
will bring here thousands of observant visitors who
will carry back to their friends reports of what they
have seen here and of what the inducements are for
hemeseekers and for tourists. Â» "
Such being the case the whole community of San
Francisco should unite iu preparing a hospitable and
cordial welcome for the members of the league and
for their friends. It is to be an occasion of interest to
jill citizens, and each in proportion to his means
should gladly share in whatever expense the recep
t'or will entail.
In all affairs of this kind there is of course a great
deal of volunteer work done with zeal for "the good
of the cause" and not for pay. The resident members
of the league, with their friends, can be counted on to
do a large amount of such work for the convention. ;
Volunteers, however, cannot do everything. Money
?s well as willing hearts and hands will' be required
in making preparations. To the general public the
lerguers have a right to look for assistance in raising
the money. It goes without saying the expectation
v.ill not be disappointed, for however Califqrnians may
differ and divide on other issues they have never yet
failed to stand together where hospitality is at stake.
It may then be accounted as certain that whatever,
ir.cney is needed will be forthcoming. The only
question is that of obtaining it promptly, that definite*
arrangements may be speedily" made and the work of
carrying them out be entered upon early so there will
be ro. confusion just before the convention meets.
It can hardly be necessary to remind San Fran

everywhere in 1801; it had grown and been
nourished by rumor and suggestion for
four years, ever since the Presidential
election of 1796. While the excited peo
ple were impatiently awaiting at that
time the tediously slow returns of the
votes from different' States, there came to
them Instead in quick succession word of
great fires in Baltimore, Philadelphia,
New York, Savannah. The flre in Savan
nah destroyed 350 houses. Every one was
horror-stricken. Tbe newspapers began
to circulate the charge of "pyrotechny"
against the Democrats; It was declared
that the Jacobins, the shouters of Ca ira,
the admirers of French waysâ in short,
the followers of Jeffersonâ had applied the
torch In all these stricken towns, and
many foretold gloomily that French
modes of public murder, the guillotine,
wouldkSoon follow French flames. .
- . Guarding Against Fires.
Timidity and excitement added to 'the
fright. Men declared they found plain
traces of Incendiarismâ oiled rags in cel
lars, scorched side walls. Strange conver
sations were overheard :Â¦ young men we.e
arrested on suspicion. Rewards -were of
fered for the detection of incendiaries;
night watches were ordered by fright
ened town and city officers. Young men
volunteered- to serve on the comnanies of
watches; but thev soon turned the whole
thing into a gay and riotous lark. The
newspapers were full of advice and warn
ing. Citizens were enjoined -to keep their
servants within doors: * to have their
chimnevs cleaned: to look after- their
pumps." By the side of each man's house
might be, seen, standing a silent, dumpy,
portly sentinel with extended armâ the
pumpâ muffled in old auilts and carpets
to prevent it from freezing. Many threw
salt down the necks of the pumps on biz
ter nights. One duty of the nightwatch
was to give a few turns to each pump
handle as he passed in order that it might
not "run dowh"; if he did, as every one
knows; a tedious duty had to be gone
through with of pouring in water, fetched
frdm some one else's well, 1 : pumping vig
orously the while till "the pump caught"
and suction was established. In case of
sudden fire, such a delay might prove a
factor in destruction. -
Outfit of tlie Volunteer Firemen.
Our citizen was a firemanâ as was every
householder of that day. Perhaps he
might belong to an organized band of fire
men. But whether - he did" or not, he
worked assiduously and unvaryingly at
found two lines of faithful â¢workers formed
reaching to the nearest water supply,
usually the river side: sometimes' it was
only the town pump. There were strong
men In one line passing to the flre from
hand to hand buckets filled with . water,
while a line of boys and even of women
passed back the empty buckets. Over all
stood in charge a dienifled flre warden
with his long painted staff of office. No one
could refuse to work on these flre lines.
The slightest hesitancy In beginning to
help would bring a deluge of water from
many buckets over the offender and. he
was lucky if he was not thrown into tho
river. Often the town had in the town
house forty or fifty buckets. These were
carried to the fire by two men, -who strung
the buckets on poles.
There was rarely a flre engine. When
there was one it was simply a great
clumsy tank, surmounted by a pump. It
Â¦was . dragged to the fxro by a single rope>
and many willing hands, but made slow
progress on its cumbersome wheels of
solid wood. The tank was usually eight
feet long and two or three feet deep and
three or four feet wide, and had to be sup
plied by a special "fire line" of buckets.
The pipe through which the water was"
thrown was of what was known as the
"goose-neck" shape, 1 and it was claimed
that when worked with a will water could
be thrown sixty feet, which gave very
good service in the days of two and three
story dwellings.
Some Early Fire Engines.
The first fire engine seen In Brooklyn
was built In 1785 and Was used for fifty
years by "Washington Company No. 1.
The Columbian Centinel of^pril 26, 1799,
gives this item: ' .
In a late new York paper we notice tlie fol
lowing article: One of Brahm's royal patent
.engines received here on the ship Sarah from
Liverpool was yesterday ' shipped on board a
vessel for Boston. We are informed it ia a
present to the Boston Fire Insurance Com
pany. < s
John Hancock gave ' a hand engine to
the town of Boston and in accepting tho
gift with gratitude it was announced that
the donor's property would always be
given preference in using the engine in
case of a general conflagration.
In 1794 a suction hose engine -was made
in Philadelphia, the wonder of its day.
This pipe was cf canvas soaked in brine
to prevent Its rottins: and it was var
nished. It was many years before rub
ber hose was used.
THE TEXAS WAY.
THE bloody county of /Bowie/^Texas, has been"
represented in the Legislature by Judge Dillard,
probably related to. "Cousin Sally /Dillard" of
the story.
The Judge strove for" a legislative record of the
latest anti-monopoly pattern. His voice was raised in
behalf of the ancient cowpath as against the modern
railway, and in all ways, in season and out, he let him
self be known as the. husky enemy of any business
enterprise wherein two or three were gathered to
gether in the name of progress' and profit., Talking of
Bowie County,, he declared himself a â¢ plain man, a
commoner, averse to the enervating luxuries, such as
baths, which are sapping the strength of the young
mr.nhood of Texas. ,
Suddenly the Tribune 'of the people resigned. He
fell out of the House like a star out of the firmament.
The place that knew him one day could not find him
with a search warrant the. next.' The people Were
without a friend, orphaned and forlorn.
He left on record as a reason for his resignation
that the Texas Legislature is controlled by corpora
tions, and therefore he gathered his toga close about
his shanks and carried it off undefiled.
Back from Bowie County came a chorus of approval.
Dillard was mentioned for Congress, the' Senate, any-,
thing in sight, for nothing* could be too good for a
patriot who refused to lvt evil communications corrupt
his good manners. .' *
Just when he was buoyantly floating on the tide that
bears men on to glory there arose in the Legislature
the Hon.;F. F. Hill of Denton County, with proofs
ami papers in his hand and rebuke in his voice, -and
proceeded to /show .that Judge Dillard. had resigned
and left the- Legislature and the. capital because .tlie
local Grand Jury had indicted him for gambling, and
further, that he had looked upon the wine when it was
$4 a bottle, and had patted with a diamond pin in a
resort that' is not in' the society blue book of Austin. *
. It was a hard day for Dillard of Bowie County,.but
he was not without a champion. In his behalf rose
Mr. Smith of Collins County/ not to disprove or deny
anything Mr. HilLhad said, but to "remind the gentle
man from* DenTori" that Judge Dillard is a dead shot,
and has aiready,' suhy killed two men." He thought
that Hill would not have made such statements had he
known, this, and he desired now to inform the House
of Judge" Dillard's record, in order that the carnage,
when it begins, may be- as- limited as possible, and not
interfere' with a quorum, nor delay the public business.
Mr. Hill inquired what Judge Dillard's handiness With
a gun had to do with his indictment for gambling and
the loss of his diamond. But he got no answer except
a repetition of the casualty list which was already
credited. tothe recent member from. Bowie. ,
Further news ; is awaited by the Legislature with
breath variously bated. . ' - ' . ''._..
There is talk in the East of Judge Taft
forward as a candidate for the. succession to McKin
ley, and while nothing of note is said about his quali
fications, the country is reminded that the Judge is an
Ohio man. â¢; 'Â¦'Â¦ . . . . .
â¢;As we walk quietly, along the darkening
streets in the winter twilight of the year
1801, what is that sudden clamor \ which
rises? i The sound comes closer. In every
house a .window or door opens and then
the cry of "Fire! Fire!", issues" forth with
distinctness in a score of different voices.
The -clangor' of every church bell in town
soon is added, rnng violently, but with no
attempt/ at signaling by strokes or guid
ing to the burning'spot.The good man of
each household seizes his fire buckets and
_flre oag. and ifsues forth with anxious
haste, joining. the crowd of men and boys
hurrying, running,' all bawling. -"Fire!
Fire!" along the. streets toward the as
cending smoke which is the only guide as
to the locality, of the fire. If v the house
holder cannot go for a few moments him
self of If â¢ he cannot run, he throws his
buckets and firo bag to some younger and
more active soul who. is hurrying past,
but, then, he does not delay an unneces
sary moment. - The good â¢ wife sets a
candle at her window pane to help illum
ine the streets; all are eager to help, with
that eagerness that . comes from- a need
of self-preservation. .. Â¦ â¢
For there -was intense dread of fire
every fire as if that were his only busi
ness. He owned a fire bag of canvas or
duck, or osnaburgs, and Â¦which must. have
a strong - drawing- string. . This could - be
packed with household goods to be re
"moved from the burning house;, often he
had afirehook to help pull down build?
ings. In Philadelphia he' tiad a willow
basket with s two handles and a great
clumsy fire syringe. " In the schoolhouse
and meeting house and other public build
ings were fire ladders, and the citizens
had : two, or in some towns four, strong
leather buckets. All these when in disuse
were kept hanging in the front hall of his
hoxise or behind his shop door.
These buckets had Deen the only regular ;
means for conveyance of water since the
earliest colonial days. They were made
of the best sole leather,' and were a mat
ter of considerable pride, being painted
with the name of the owner and often
some decorative design, such as a pious
or moral motto, or even a coat of arms.
They were deemed a very dignified mark
and emblem of house-owning and respon
sibility. Many are preserved to our day,
an old age of honored desuetude.

ALTBRY^NGELDISM.
THERE are evidences that the compound dis
ease Altbryaogeldism has run its course in this
. country. - It was an epidemic of political immor
ality. The symptoms were a quickened pulse, upward
rolling eye, a vocal tremolo, a loud voice and itching
palm. ' i â¢
The disease- appeared in 1896, and many prominent
public men caught it. So; threatening was it that the
peopk ordered a quarantine that year, which confined
it to part of the Southern States and r a few Northern
States west of the Missouri River. In other parts of
the .Union it -was prevalent in sporadic form, and
seemed to have become endemic in Nebraska and Mis
souri. As the sufferers from hay fever have a national
organization and convention, so these victims of Alt
bryangeldism had theirs. It was a peculiarity of the
disease that its victims were spitefully inimical to all
who did not catch it. The Gold Democracy in 1S96
were immune and passed through the epidemic of that
year untouched. On the other hand, a large num
ber of Republicans were infected, and had the misery
in an acute and exaggerated form.
. A careful isolation of the microbe which caused it
proved that it was first introduced into the country by.
the Populists. It incapacitated the patients for dis
tinguishing between a $"20 gold piece and a leather
medal. They chewed a rag and then offered it in pay
ment of debts. They denied the existence of the law
of gravity, and insisted that if it were not for a' class
they called "gold bugs'' things would fall up instead
of down. The disease derived its name from its two
most prominent victims, Mr. Altgcld and Mr. Bryan.
It was very acute in. each. 'It affected Altgeld's sight,
so that when he looked at the constitution of the
: United States it seemed like a\blank : piece of paper.
When Â¦ there was . a conflict' between, the law and its
violator he had a str.ibismatic trouble which to. his
vision made the law. criminal and the criminal inno
cent. Unfortunately, in the height of the attack' he
was Governor of Illinois, and when visiting the peni
tentiary would i marvel that certain desperate charac
ters, murderers and anarchists, were there, and' would
pardon them. When several of these victims of his
diseased clemency immediately committed other mur
ders and lesser crimes he believed that these crimes
were actually committed by a great criminal seen in
his imagination and called by him ''society." There
upon he sought to destroy society. The disease caused
him to believe that came existed only because the
law denned and punished it, and therefore crime could
be abolished by the simple "process of striking down
the law. * , .
He roused the fear of his neighbors and the appre
hension of the whole country, and the people of his
State were compelled twice to isolate him.' 1 :
But in him the disease seems to have run itg course,
and the first sign of his convalescence was his active
support of the Republican candidate for Mayor of
Chicago.
. In Mr. Bryan the disease, was equally acute, with
the sarnie symptoms "as Altgeld's, reinforced by others
that were probably due to his environment. His head
swelled terribly. He vas abnormally loquacious, and
t-lked incessantly. . Among his hallucinations he
thought that' he was Thomas Jefferson, and again that
he was Abraham Lincoln. He was very restless and
traveled all over the country, spreading the disease
by shaking hands, as the ifch used to be propagated
in that far-off period when it was called "the prairie
digs." .' .
Another peculiarity ci the disease In" ;Mr. Bryan
was that it made him avaricious. He 'raved without
ceasing, and the infection made other victims of the
trauble believe that he spoke as a prophet, seer and
revelator, and he made, them pay for listening, and
then they went away.tnd pawed dust on themselves
and bellowed, like cattle. Believing .that he was like
primitive, man in the fable of Plato, combining both
genders in. himself, he would be seized with an active
fit in what he believed to be his female side, and would
insist upon talking to audiences, composed of women
only. This spread the disease to some extent among
their sex, in'which it was attended by violent hysteria
and an .effort to wear trousers and short hair.'
It is feared that the trouble has permanently af
fected Mr. Bryan, having ' passed into the. tertiary
stage. In that. stage he is now 'found denying that
there is anybody in the world but himself. When his
attention is called sharply to any public man in the
country he immediately challenges him to co^ne for
ward and submit proofs of his existence. ._
His neighbors maintained .such a rigid quarantine
against hini in i8o6 and 1900 that the disease has dis
appeared from Nebraska. It is believed â and indeed
hoped â in Lincoln that Mr. Bryan may remain to be
come a permanent asset of the town, that he may at
tract political pathologists who desire to make a study
of morbid morality. By adding a few pickle jars of
morbid anatomy, double-headed rats and five-legge<l
calves, tumors and another jawbone of an ass to Mr.
Bryan it- is believed that the capital of Nebraska may
have a museum of abnormal products that will draw
visitors. . .
GOSSIP FROM
LONDON'S WORLD
OF LETTERS
A few years ago the sales of Lenten de
votional literature were very extensive
and formed an item to be reckoned with
at this time of the year, but during the
present season the demand has been quite
insignificant. Several memoirs of the late
Queen Victoria, which publishers fondly
anticipated would bring good returns, are
having rather a limited sale, but that can
not be said for the Harmsworth publica
tion, In parts, which is written by the
Duke of Argyll and which is selling by tho
thousands. -.
Miss Julia M. Crottie's recently pub
lished story, 'The Lost Land, an Irish
Tale," seems one of. those which are
taking well with readers. The story of
the publication, as told by Justin Mc-
Carthy, Is one of the most remarkable
stories of perseverance under most de
pressing : and discouraging circumstances
ever heard. . .-,.Â¦
Mr. McCarthy says this novel has a
curious history of its own. "When it was
written It was shown to a lady friend of
Miss Crottie. who took it away with her.
read it, and without consent of the au
thoress sent it for Inspection to a London
publisher. The manuscript was lost and
no trace of it could be discovered, so Miss
Crottie went to work again and rewrote
the whole book. *
The new manuscript was then sent to tno
editor of aS London magazine. The sec
ond manuscript was also lost and has
never been recovered. Miss Crottie on
this second failure felt for a time some
thing very like despair. She bore up.
however, went to work again and wrote
out the book a third time, her persever
ance now being rewarded by success and
the appreciation of more than the average
number of readers of a story.
Curious, too, how another successful
novel of the present season came very
near to never seeing the light of the
world. That is Mrs. A. F. Slade's first
novel, "A Wayside Weed." As a matter
of fact the novel was written as far back
as seven years ago, but she thought It
would be hopeless to attempt to find a
publisher for such a purely domestic
story in these, days of feverish lltera-
Th'en a friend came to the rescue of
Mrs. Slade's story, but she was not so un
fortunate as Miss Crottie, for tho friend
took it to Messrs. Hutchinson. who, not to
lose It, immediately accepted It for pub
lication. ._
Of course, when a new writer make*
anything of a success everybody wants to
know something about him or her. Belnjf
asked for something- Interesting concern-
Ing herself, Mrs. Slade replied to the
bookman: "I'm simply a busy mother of
a family, -an ordinary all round sort of
person, as genuinely Interested in serving
up a good dinner as in . trying a. bit of
new music, singing a new son? or read
ing any one of the new books which ap-Â»
peal to my old fashioned taste. I am pain
fully shy, and my dread of a s.tranger is
something you never expect any one out
side a prison to understand."
Who is Charles Marriott, the author of
that other successful new novel, "The
Column," which Is | being widely read
now? Well, it turns out that he holds the
position of dispenser and photographer to
an asylum near Liverpool. He was born
at Bristol in .1869, but his earliest recol
lections are of Moor End, where his
father, who was a brewer, removed from
Bristol when he was about two years
old.
Frederick Macmillan, while congratu
lating the Publishers' Association the
other day on the success of its scheme for
the net purchase of books, showed an In
teresting memento of the abortive at
tempt made about half a century ago to
put a similar agreement in force. .
The memento Is a book of autograph
letters, all condemning the plan for keep-
Ing up prices. The letters were In reply
to a circular sent out by a well known
Strand editor of his time asking certain
eminent authors if he considered the in
tention to sell at a low rate of profit a
good and sufficient reason why the pub
lisher should refuse to sell books which
the retailer was ready to purchase and
keep in stock at his own risk.
Dickens' reply was brief and emphatic:
"No; certainly not." Carlyle wrote: "My
answer Is â tor my own interests and those
of the world as far as I can see them, de
cidedly no; it is not a sufficient reason."
Darwin's opinion was: "I beg strongly
to express my opinion that both for the
advantage of the authors and publishers
booksellers, like other dealers, ought to
settle each for himself the retail price."
Charles KIngsley, in the course of a letter
of great length, wrote: "No intention of
the bookseller to sell at a low price ought
to be any reason why the publisher should
not supply him, but rather the very best
reason why he should soon do so."
Such men at Leigh Hunt, John Stuart
Mill and Herbert Spencer were all of tho
same opinion.
Booksellers In all parts of the country
now report "that there has been no diffi
culty in obtaining the net prices of books
and that satisfactory results of the net
book system have already made them
selves evident In the balance sheets of
most retail booksellers.
The Russian colony about which there
was a rumor some time ago for printing
Count Tolstoi's work in England has now
taken shape. It has been established at
Tucktoh House, near Bournemouth. Vla
dimir Tchertkoft is the founder of tho
little colony, which at present numbers
about twelve persons, consisting of Douk
hobors of the Caucasus, large numbers of
whom three yours ago had to undergo
something very like persecution.
Tchertkoff is one of the three signer*
of the appeal to the Czar in August, 1896.

. Speeches of that kind must be highly incensing to

the blame^for the attack made upon him by a lunatic.
It will be remembered that when the late King Hum
bert of Italy was once fired at by a would-be assassin,
the King laughed and said: "Such things are the
accidents of my trade."- Kaiser William should,- of
course, take every precaution against assault, for a
man must guard against the accidents of his trade; but
he should, not' sulk over an-attack and take it as an
evidence that "serious times are coming," and that the
people are about to rise against him. -The Kaiser, in
fact,' is too serious. -If he'could cultivate alittle more

Captain Jertnim in Trouble.
Captain Johannes Jertrum, master of
the German ship Marco Polo, was arrested
yesterday by Deputy T.'nited States Mar-
Fhal Burnham on a complaint sworn to by
Tnlted States Immierrtion Commissioner
North charging the captain with leaving
here illegally Errst Dau. one of the crew
afflicted with a contac ous disease. H's
examination will Lake place before United
States Commissioner Ileacock at 10 a, in*
io-<3ay.
The Arab was passed by the local in
spectors ' at Seattle, and when she grot
here Captain Wills refused a second ex
amination, as his vessel had been accept
ed as ready for sea on March 11 by the
United States representatives. The Pak
Ling grot away on March 22, and Is now
well on her way to Manila, while the
Arab, which sailed nine days later, is
back in port again, with her load.
The Arab got away early on Sunday,
March 2L All went well for the first few
days, and then the boilers began to leak.
Patches that had been put on at Seattle
would not stand the pressure and the en
gineers could not tinker them up. Then
one or two of the furnaces fell, and the
water leaking out of the boilers began
drowning out the fires. Engineers, fire
men and coalpassers vainly worked like
beavers to repair the damage. On Friday,
the 5th inst., the steamship was within 830
miles of Honolulu and hopes were enter
tained of making that port. But some
thing else went wrong- in the engine room
and the chief engineer reported to Cap
tain Wills that it was Impossible to pro
ceed. The Arab was accordingly put
about" and headed for San Francisco un
der all the steam that could be got on the
pc.liere. Soon after she came to -an an
chor the officers of the transport service
began an investigation, and the inspectors
â¢who passed the vessel as "ready for sea"
are likely to hear more about the matter.
The Arab was not allowed to lie long in
the stream. About noon she was brought
alongside Harrison-street wharf and at
2 p. m. all the animals were landed and
taken to the Presidio. Monday 540 of them
will be put aboard thÂ« Thyra to make an
other Ftart for the Philippines. The re
mainder of the horses will be sent away
on the Samoa. It will probably take two
months to get the Arab ready for sea
again.
THE chartered army transport
Arab, which left here March 31
for Manila \rith 657 horses, came
back to port in distress yester
day. When six days out some of
the furnaces fell and the boilers around
the others began to leak, putting out the
Jires and compelling- Captain Wills to re
turn for repairs. The Arab and Pak LAns
are British tramps. Both were chartered
in Seattle. When the Pak Ling came here
the captain refused to have her inspected
by the United States Local Inspectors of
Steam Vessels. Colonel Long, however,
refused to accept the steamer without the
necessary paper3 and the captain had to
pive in. The inspection showed that
nearly all the furnaces of the Pali Ling
were down, and it took about six weeks
to repair her. It cost over $6000 to get her
ready for sea.

fufar rose an extreme 3U and saved more
of ite train than other stocks. The United
States Steel stocks showed a notable relapse
from their early strencth. dosing at net de
clines of a . fraction to a point.l The selling
pressure was most marked in Burllnirton and
in Northern Pacific, and it was only for a
brief rverlod that they were liftÂ»Â»d at all over
last night's close. The reaction In Burlington
reached 5% and In Northern Pacific 2Â»i. The
requirements of the Sub-Treasury and the de
mand from the interior continued to make in
roeds on banking reserves and the refusal
by the Secretary of the Treasury of bonds of

th* hope of relief from that source. hard
eninp of the money rate in. London also causes
apprehension of a renewal cf pressure for cold
from that point, although the higher money
rate here was sufficient to cause a yielding in
the eterling exchange rate to-<3ay. The weekly
retwrn of the Bank of Encland shows that lt
has made heavy demands upon the open mar
ket for rcrayment of loans and the coming
needs of the money market there give promise
tfcat the outside market must resort to the
NEW YORK. Aorii 1Lâ Speculative liquida
tion v.t.s very clearly at work again in to
day's stock market. It was offset during the
early part of the day by an aggressive strength
{Â¦hewn by a handful of stocks. The advance
in these was helped by violent manipulation,
but it e?rv<?d to Fustain the rest of the market
in face of heavy selling until the call money
rate ran ur> asaln. when the pressure to sell
bseame greater than the absorption power, and
the market turned weak. Even the notably
FtronK FtockF lost all of their gains as a rule
end thr market closed dull and at about the
lotvest and at considerable net losses, except
In a very few stocks. The arrival in London
of the New York financier who has been the
moving spirit in most of the recent vast finan
cial iToipcte in this country aroused tome ex
jiMnatlon that the London market would re
flect his presence there and that action would
be taken on some of the projects which have
twen supposed to b* waiting upon his counsel.
The rumored Burllncton deal was the most
important of thrss and the failure of official
confirmation of the very positive assertions
which have been current that this transaction
ves completed had a good deal to do with
the df>;Â«r<>*sion which permeated the whole mar
ket as the day i>ropressed. It is evident from
the persistence cf disclaimers of the deal that
sn important minority of the Etoekholtleri is
rtlll opposed to lt. Â»ven if it be true that ac
tual control '.as passed to the Hill-Morgan in
terests. The wldeepread belief in the pending
consolidations of importance in the copper
â¢world mc.de Amalgamated Copper very active
and buoyant, but here again the failure of ex
pected official confirmation aroused some feel
ing of distrust among the speculators, who had
boucht most largely and with least infor
mation, and the profit-taking cost the stock
practically all of its 3%-noint rise. The Chi
cago and Northwestern Etocks continued their
remarkable rise, the common advancing 13
points and the preferred it points, each of
them showing G-polnt advances between sales.
Denials from official sources of the rumored
consolidation of this road with Chicago. Min
neapolis- St. Paul and Omaha and with Union
Pacific caused & reaction In the stock of 7%.
There were denials of the rumored sales of
Consolidated Oas' real estate, causing a reac
tion of 4 points from the stock's 5%-point rise.
The advance of 3% In Rock lslan.1 on rumors
of buying for control by Pennsylvania . was
more than lost.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April 11.â The Government report,
having shown about what had been expected
of lt, was of less influence In the wheat mar
ket than the little addendum to it which men
tioned the possibilities of future damage from
Hessian fly. Lower cables and the bearishness
of the report itself caused heavy selling at the
start. May being sold from, 70% to 63%c, com
pared with yesterday's close at 70%@70%c. But
the bulls seized the fly argument and aided by
light receipts and an excellent shipping de
mand succeeded â¢ in alarming shorts, who
covered on a liberal scale. The market dur
ing the first hour climbed to 71c. Heavy clear
ances and reports on damage from Insects ! in
Missouri caused a further rally to 71%c Prof
it-taking caused " a small reaction, but the
close was etrong and lc higher, at 71%@7Hlc. |
Corn was rather quiet but " steady, despite
some selling of May by Phillips, who, like
many other traders, was changing some long
stuff over to July. Wet weather, light re
ceipts and very small country offerings, .- as
well as sympathy with the wheat strength,
were x the sustaining influences. May closed' a
shade up at 43%c.
Oats were quiet but steady in sympathy with
wheat. May closed %c higher at 25%c. â¢
Provisions were dull. The opening was Ir
regular, but the tone of â¢ the market Â¦ became
stronger later on a good cash demand. May
pork closed 7%c higher, lard 2%@5c up and ribs
2%c. improved. : w '. :'

Chicago opened firmer, with an upward tend
ency and good buying of both long and short
Wheat all over the pit. ' It j looked as if the
Government report had either been discounted
or that the crowd were. "coppering" it, as sell
ing-orders were scarce and shorts were act- ;
ively covering, with very little Wheat for
sale. There were a good many damage reports
from the Southwest, and excessive rains in the |
West were retarding field work. New York
exporters reported moderate acceptances from
the Continent and Minneapolis expected a de
crease in stocks for the 1 week of 600,000 bush
els. Â¦ â¢;- -Â¦
The Government report , was no more bear
ish than expected. It gave the condition of
winter Wheat at 91.7, against S2.1 for April 1,
1900, and 82.9 as the mean on this date for the.
past ten years. But against this bearish show
ing it mentioned ravages of Hessian fly from
an almost unprecedentedly large number of
States, which have given. rise to serious mis
givings as to possible developments within the
next thirty days. According, to the estimate a
winter Wheat â¢ crop of 440,000,000 Â¦ bushels is
promised, against 395,000,000 bushels last year.

CLOSING.
The bank has bought Â£553.000 of gold In In
dian bars; Â£25,000 is going out to South Ameri
can ports. The call money rate was 3 per cent.
The Continent sold more than lt bought of
American shares, but London bought freely
all the wav up to a close which was at the
highest prices of the day. In the street after
ward there was a partial reaction, which was
ascribed to tight money in New York. The
steel corporations' stocks are now being dealt
in here. Copper stocks spurted sharply on the
announcement of the Montana deal of the
Amalgamated Copper Company.
American shares were buoyant Â¦ from the
opening to the close. Eries were Che feature.
Other favorites were Union Pacific, Norfolk
and Western and Northrn Pacific, the last ris
ing on the renewal of the reports of the Bur
lington deal. Â¦Â¦* . Â¦
Business was brisker on the stock market
here to-day and the trading In the general list
took on a much more cheerful tone. This was
attributed to the talk about Botha's negotia
tions for a sjttlement In South Africa. The
general tendency, in all the markets. was to
cover Fhortsand this advanced prices.'

CHICAGO. April 11.â Federal authorities
have ordered the flow of the Chicago Rlv- Â¦
er reduced from 300,000 to 200,000 cubic feet
a minute. "Word to this effect came from
Washington to the Sanitary Board to-day.
The board will act immediately upon re
ceipt of the official order and the current
will not be increased before the channel
has been widened and deepened and exist
ing obstructions to navigation have been
removed.
This action on the part of the War De
partment was brought about by theipro
test of local river Interests and the Lake
Carriers' Association, which, since the
opening of the big canal, have complained
that the 300,000 cubic feet provided by law
was dangerous to navigation under pres
ent conditions.
Local authorities are apprehensive of
the effect It may have upon the St. Louis
litigation. With the full flow to dilute the
sewage carried down the canal from the
Chicago River, the board had no fear of
the charge that Chicago was polluting the
water supply of St. Louis. In view of the
action of the War Department, the out
come of St. Louis* appeal to the courts is
doubtful. If the Legislature passes the
bill authorizing the commission to collect
one-half of one per cent tax to be used for
the improvement of the river it is believed
the current can be increased gradually
after September, as the work of widening
and deepening the channel progresses.
Otherwise it -will be four or five years be
fore relief can be obtained. Â¦ * <

WHEN". SEEKING FISH
A sensation was caused in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday afternoon when Fred
Heitmeyer, 2517 Bush rtreet, one of the
jurors in the case*of "Major" Edwin Lew
is, on trial for forgery, fainted in the Jury
box and was carried out of court. Ha
soon revived, but" the Judge under the'cir
cumstances adjourned t court until this
morning.
It is a part of the defense that Lewis is
mentally irresponsible and Dr. Franklin
B. Lord was one of the witnesses in- that
regard. Lord. testified that Lewis was a
sufferer from strangulated hernia and it
had the effect of superinducing mental ab
erration. C. "W. Marwedel, a juror, ques
tioned the accuracy of the witness* diag
nosis. and Lord went into a lengthy ex
planation of the eVil results from stran
gulated hernia and heinia. Heitmeyer
turned deathly pale and with a gasp faint
ed. Bailiff Windrow and other attaches
of the court carrjed Heitmever into the

GARDNER NOT TO BE
TRAINED BY BERNSTETN
Pugilists Have a Palling Out and
Separate â Reasons for the
Split-Up.
Joe Bernstein, the New. York feather
weight, will not train Oscar Gardner for
his .coming battle with Terry McGovern^.
The' coldness that was noticeable between
the two men since their arrival here has
become a veritable snowstorm and now
the twÂ«r go different ways. The trouble
between the pair is of long standing.
Gardner gained a decision over Bernstein
many months ago, and when the i victor
was 'matched with McGovern in this city
it was thought they had buried all (differ
ences. Bernstein, however, has an" ambi
tion to meet McGovern again. He fought
twice with the Brooklyn wonder and. lost
on both occasions, but, he still thinks he
can lower the champion's colors. Gard
ner was aware of this and a feeling of
hostility has sprung up between them.
The breach has widened and now Gard
ner must train without Bernstein's as
sistance.
It is understood that rivalry was not
the only reason for the falling out. Bern
stein was engaged in New York to train
Gardner and believed he had full charge.
He prescribed a set of rules to be fol
lowed by Oscar, but the latter rebelled.
Bernstein was opposed to the presence of
Gardner's wife at the training quarters,
but his quiet suggestion that the lady oc
cupy other quarters went unheeded.
Bercsteln will remain in this city In the
hope of getting on a. battle with Toby
Irwin or some other man in his class.

Dragged.
George McGinn, residing at 20*6 Twelfth
f trec-t. was knocked down and dragged by
car 180 of the Haight-street line last night
and received injuries that rendered him
unconscious and may prove fatal. The
accident occurred on Market street, near
Franklin.
Gripman B. C. Ellis said when he first
paw the man he was standing a few feet
away from the track.
"Juet as I got within a few feet of
where he was standing." said the grip
man, "he turned suddenly and started to
croe* the track. I tried to stop the car,
hut it struck him and knocked him down.
The car went ahead about four feet after
it struck him.". : .
Â¦ McGinn was taken to thÂ« Receiving Hos
pital, but he could not be revived. At a
late hour he was still unconscious and the
doctors fear his injuries are fatal. The
injured man Is well known, having at one
time held the position of commissary . at
the House of Correction. , >
Not too xnuch can be said of the hall
decorations. They vrcre beautiful. It was
like going into fairyland. There were
myriads ofÂ» lights peeping from beneath
foliage and mellowing through soft Jap

ALAMEDA, April lL-It Is hard to
reconcile "standing room only"
with a card tournament., yet it
was necessary to do so this even
ing with the function for charity
â¢ arrarged by the civic section of the Adel
phiari Club. Harmonie Hall held 500
chairs and 125 tables, yet they were in
adequate to seat the people who wanted
to play cards. It devolved upon the over
flow to employ itself by assisting the lady
managers in looking after the details of
the great undertaking. The lady man
agers are wondering what they would
have done if every one who bought tickets
had come, for a good many more than 500
tickets were sold by solicitation before
hand. But luck was with them, as it
should be for such a commendable cause
as a "free bed," and they had' no reason
to worry. There is joy among them, for
now they have a nucjeus for a fund that
is bound to grow and perpetually support
a charity that is a charity In every sense
of the word. â¢ * .â¢
The two large upstairs rooms of the hall
were turned over to the whist players,
who greatly outnumbered those who came
to play euchre. Mrs. Dr. G. C. Bull and
Mrs. G. A. Moore were responsible for the
whist rules and they depended upon the
stentorian voices of Dr. C. L. Tisdale and
Charles Gardner to inform the players
how they were expected to play.
In the banquet-room of the hall the
euchre players pored over the cards. . Mrs.
W. A. Bissell and Mrs. R. H. Swayne
formulated the rules for these players.
G. Â¦ T. "Wright did not have to raise his
voice while explaining them for there was
not a large number of euchre players.
Promptly at 8:30 o'clock the word was
given for the "sharps" to begin play.
â¢ Then for two hours 500 people were ab-'
sorbed in the fascinating intricacies of
whist and euchre. It was interesting t3
.watch the concentration when the signal
announced that play had . commenced
pgain after each interval. Then when the
signal to "progress" was given the bustle
and hum following relaxation would en-

Swayne, Mrs. Dr. C. L. Tisdale, Mrs. S. A.
O'Neill. Mrs. G. A. Tyson and Mrs. S. "M.
Haslett.
As the players wended their way into
the hall they were met and directed to
the tables by the lady managers, assisted
by the young ladies, who afterward acted
as scorers. The managers were the fol
lowing named:
palms. It was under the trained hands
of Miss Lucca Buch, assisted by Mrs.
Amos Mecartney, Miss Meta Mecartney,
Miss Star and others, that this was
brought about. There were many excla
mations of delight from the. card-players
at the beauty of the scene.

When play ended at 10:30 o'clock: the
cards were gathered up and the: scorers
began to add the players' points. In a
few moments the result was announced
by Dr. C. L. Tisdalc from the platform,
where all the handsome prizes, donated
by friends of the civic section, were dis
played upon a table. As the names of the
prize-winners . . were called off applause
greeted them.

PLANS A FETE
FOR McKINLEY
Several years after Mrs. Griswpld heard
of Clark's death and advertised for some
one to adopt the little orphan girl. The
Elliotts responded, and on August 21, 1878,
were granted p&pers of adoption by a
court of San Francisco. In 1S97 the El
liotts learned that Imbray Clark had left
a fortune of $25,000,000. to which there was
no heir, and began a fight for their fos
ter daughter's rights. The estate is tied
up in the English courts, and though hun
dreds of claimants have conm forward
none have been able to prove^laims to
the satisfaction of the British authorities.
Hug-h Haviland's little sister, Kate Hav
iland's other child, according to Lawyer
Goldwaithe of New York, was put by the
mother with foster parents. The girl
grew up, married Imbray Clark and went
West with him. In 1877 they went to San
Francisco and there a child was born.
"Within two weeks the delicate mother,
Kate Haviland's girl, died. The baby was
placed in the hands of. Mrs. Martha A.
Grlswold, superintendent of the Home for
the Friendless, by Imbray Clark, who
sailed almost immediately for Australia.

was "Dr. Keattle", was, it is said, prac
tically established by witnesses in New
York and Brooklyn. But Hugh Haviland
is heir to but half the fortune. . A girl,
who is expected to divide it with him,
tirace M. Clark Elliott. Haviland's niece,
believes herself sole heiress of Imbray
Clark of Australia, who died worth $25,

There have been published recently various versions or statements re
garding the itinerary of the President's outing.' The Call receives authentic in
telligence direct from Washington that the itinerary Js still under considera
tion and will not be approved until next Saturday. It will be published in
this journal immediately after its approval by the President. F. "W. Dohr
mann, chairman of the executive council of finance of the San Francisco
general committee, has completed the work of appointing sub-committees to
collect funds. The following assignments to duty by districts and in special
fields are announced: . > â¢' .
"The President Is a plain man, whose lifelong associations have been with
the people, and I am sure that he will be pleased If his speech making be con
fined to one occasion, and that as public as possible. When he** speaks he
says something, and it will be more satisfactory to him and. the people if it
be said all at once, thus, relieving him of the. burden of serious -speeches on
every appearance. He and his Cabinet have their dally business to transact
during all of the coming trip, and a programme that occupies all of "their
working hours is inconsistent with their comfort and their public duty.
"There will be many ladies in the party and I am sure their welfare will
be consulted if the women of the State relieve them of some of the weariness
of public functions and give them frequent opportunity to see our home life
in; repose.'' . - Â¦ . .
"The President looks forward with the liveliest pleasure to his Western
trip, but I think he is somewhat appalled by the overwhelming heartiness'of
the California hospitality ., which is to be offered to him. The succession of
functions here should not exceed the holiday allowance of the President.
We should not forget that he is a very hard working man and should try to
make his outing as real a vacation as possible. The strain which is hardest
on a man in his position is the making of many speeches. fSun sure we will
please 'and rest, him by having his speech making limited if possible to one
occasion in San" Francisco, and to that the publicâ all the peopleâ should have
access. - â¢ Â¦ . Â¦ .
Colonel Irish in an interview, yesterday said:
Succession of Functions.
Colonel John P. Irish, who came home from the East yesterday, saw the
President several times in Washington, and at every interview the proposed
trip to the coast was a topic that.engaged the President's special interest.
â¢ When The Call on March 21 published the official programme as reluct
antly approved by the President, public attention was called to the number
of functions embraced in the general list. The executive committee sought to
make the , burden lighter, and listened to a suggestion that the proposed ex
cursion to Mount Tamalpais should be excluded. When the suggestion was
submitted to the President he promptly objected to the revision, saying that
he wanted to go to the mountain; provided the morning was not foggy, and if
fog prevailed, he desired to rest In San Francisco. Every message from Wash-'
ington signifies that the President is s parring for rest. -
Tne Accepted Programme.
"visit to this city will not afford him a real , vacation. Every Califor
;nian who has visited the White House recently brings home the same story
of the President's desire for. an outingâ for an opportunity : to rest, visit the
'interesting places and see the sights. The accepted programme, however, â¢ pro
;poses to make his daily life in. San Francisco one constant round of functions
and receptions. If the societies and organizations which have been clamoring
i for ."the President's presence at their special functions do not come for
-ward and make some concessions to his desire for rest and recreation, the ex
ecutive committee should-' proceed to perform the heroic duty of canceling en
gagements. â¢ .
citizens'- executive committee appointed to arrange plans for the
, II President's sojourn In San Francisco may be impelled by force of clr-
II cumstances~ to revise the programme and cut out some of. the func-
UL '; tions. . President McKInley is beginning to be apprehensive that his
rtcKinley Is Seeking Rest and Not a
Round of Receptions and Honors.

SUDDEN SHIFT
OF SERGEANTS

Beats To-Day.

Sudden- Changes In Captain Witt

out Any Explanation
Being Given.
Orders we're Issued last night for a gen
eral shifting around of the sergeants of
Company A of Captain Wittman's division
of the police force and the sergeants are
wondering what It all means. Every ser
geant in the company has been trans
ferred and the only explanation thus far
vouchsafed Is that the changes are made
for the good of the service.
The order goes into effect this morniijg.
Sergeant Duke goes to the north end sta

transferred to O'Farrell street Sergeant
Burnett goes from O'Farrell street to the
Central station, relieving Sergeant Tobin.

It Is said that there is no significance
In these transfers, but the fact remains
that the order was totally unexpected and
caused considerable uneasiness.
HOUSEMEN DECBY POOR
CONDITION OF SPEEDWAY
Drivers' Association. Members Object
to /Neglect of Their Favorite
Stretch.
The San Francisco Drivers' Association
had under discussion at its meeting in the
Palace Hotel Tuesday night the condition
of the speed track in Golden Gate Park.
It developed during the meeting that more
than one of the members had noticed the
"cuppy," dusty and decidedly poor condi
tion of the stretch of road devoted to their
use in the park. The members were not
a bit backward in declaring their opinions
on the decided leaning toward the chauf
feurs and cyclists displayed by those who
know, no thing of the comforts which can
be derived from a drive over a good road
behind a lively horse. â¢
While the drivers concede- that the auto
mobllist and the cyclist are worthy of
even.' attention, and while they are will-
Ing to grant them the same rights which
the horsemen have always enjoyed, they
do not think that those who are not given
to taking up ' the newest methods of
traveling should be neglected. The
cyclists have their pathway and it Is kept
in good condition. This, the drivers con
tend, is what they are entltfled to and they
have not the least objection to Its being
kept ko. but they do think that while the
question cf the rights and privileges to be
afforded the wheelmen and the steam or
electric carriage enthusiast are under
discussion the existence of the driver ajid
the delight he derives from riding over a
good roadway should not be forgotten.
The drivers also say that a drive over
the speedway in its present condition. is
a dri-ngerous undertaking and at- any mo
ment the life of a driver or a valuable
steed is at stake.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
â¢Ask .your, druggist 4 for a 50-cent pack-
age ; of: Stuart's : Dyspepsia Tablets,^ and
after a week's use note. the Improvement
1 in health, appetite ; and nervous energy. .
There is no danger of forming an in-
jurious habit: as the tablets contain ab-
solutely nothing but natural digestives-
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
no place An a stomach medicine -and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are certainly
the best known and most popular of ail
stomach remedies.
People who make a a dally practice of
taking one or two , of Stuart's DysDeosia
Tablets after^ach meal a?Tsure^ to hkvt
perfect digestion.: which means perfect
health.
â¢But many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion and it is of no
use to advise brain workers to eat large-
ly of grains and vegetables where the
digestion is too weak to assimilate them
properly.
It Is always best to get the best re-
sults from our. food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meals to assist the relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years* experience have
proven Stuart's Dyspepsia .Tablets to be
a very, safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive and a remedy which may be taken
dally with the best results. laKen
-Stuart's Dyspepsia- Tablets can hardly
be called a patent medicine/ as they do
not act on the bowels nor any particular
organ, but only on the food eaten Thev
supply , what weak stomachs lack Ded-
sln diastase. . and by stimulating the eas-
tric glands increase the natural secretion
of hydrochloric add. .
â¢ As a general rule, meat once a day is
sufficient for all classes of men, women
and children, and grains, fruit and vege-
tables should constitute the bulk of food
eaten. .
Nearly every one will admit . that as
a nation we eat too much meat and too
little of vegetables and the grains.
For business men, office men and clerks,
and in fact every one. engaged In seden-
tary or indoor occupations, grains milk
and vegetables are -much more healthful.
Only men engaged in a severe outdoor
manual labor can live- on a heavy meat
diet and' continue in health.
Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is Di-
gested.
