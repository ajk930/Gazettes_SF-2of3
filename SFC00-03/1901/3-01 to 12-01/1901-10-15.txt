"The matter has been In the. hands of a

were adopted:
The House of Bishops held a busy ses
e'on in the afternoon. A long: letter was
drafted to be sent to the Episcopal church
or Mexico, asking that institution to adopt
certain regulations before the. church of
America would consecrate Bishops . for
that country. A resolutions was also
In the afternoon the House of Deputies
went into executive tesslon to pass upon
the nominations of Missionary Bishops
made by the prelates of the church. There
were five nominations and four of these
received favorable action. The fifth was re
jected. The nomination was that of Chap
lain Pierce of the United States army and
he was suggested as missionary Bishop
cf North Dakota.
It is thought, however, that the canon
will be defeated when the House of Dep
uties votes upon it by orders. There are
fifty-nine dioceses In the convention, hav
ing a clerical and lay deputation of four
members each. It will require a majority
of the clerical and lay deputations to
make the divorce canon finally operative
In the Episcopal church. The vote will
probably be taken by the House of Depu
ties to-day.
The canon as adopted by the House of
Bishops totally prohibiting the clergy of
the Episcopal church to remarry divorced
persons was then carried In the committee
of the whole by a vote of 182 ayes to 158
noes. - ' -'
THE last day of debate on the !
prohibitory canon on remar
riage of divorced persons
served to crowd Trinity Church
to its limit yesterday, when the
House of Deputies of the Epis
copal General Convention, Bitting as a
committee of the whole, listened to -the
final arguments and voted on the all-im
portant subject.
As on the previous days of the debate
the galleries were crowded with ladies,
who evidently took the greatest Interest
In the words of the distinguished clerics
and laymen, who participated in the reli
gious controversy,
By a rising vote the amendment of the
Rev. I>r. Huntington of New Tork to allow
an Innocent party to a divorce for adul
tery to remarry was defeated by 173 noes
to 155 ayes.
The house agreed to the report of thÂ»
committee on marginal readings and also
adopted the resolutions of sorrow on the
untimely death of the late President. The
Presiding" Bishop was empowered to call
a session of the House of Bishops in the
event a Bishop should resign. Hereto'
fore the church. had to wait until the
house_held its -triennial convention before
the vacancy was filled. A furtl"*r reso
lution was adopted empowering tne- tlousa
of Bishops to declare a missionary district
vacant where the Bishop has been dl*r
abled'or incapacitated. .
The passage of this resolution was dus
to the fact that Bishop Wlngflejd of North
ern California became weak and unabls
to send in his resignation.
The House of Bishops passed a canon
fixing the age of a deaconess at thirty and
direction that she must be unmarried or m
Widow.'. Â»'"

"What did they N do when they came out,
which way did they head?"
"We were to the westward. The entrance to
us was about northeast by north. \u25a0 The fleet
came out south and turned as they left the en
trance to four points southwest, so that they
turned In our direction. -When I first got on
deck the helm had been starboarded, heading
a little to the northward. When I saw the
fleet they were heading southwest and seemed
to be coming straight for the interval between
the Texas and the "Brooklyn. I went in the
conning tower and directed the helmsman.. I
told him what I wanted to do waa to keep
straight for the fleet. ' They wavered a little.
Sometimes they turned one way and then an
other. We shifted helm once or twice, but very
little indeed, and- finally when we were getting
up fairly close, say between 1500 and 2000
yards, it seemed to me clear that they wanted
to pass between the Toxas and the Brooklyn.
The Texas was well on our starboard and she
waa headed to the northward and -westward.
All ships were carrying out the Instructions of
the commander in chief, and that was to head
in for the entrance. Wo were well to the west
ward and headed to the northeast. When \u25a0 I
saw. that I ported the helm perhaps halfway
over. She was swinging starboard very rap
idly. The Spanish fleet was coming straight
for this interval â\u25a0 I stepped out of. the tower
on the port side to get a good look at the spot,
to: see Just what they were going to do as to
our relative positions, and I . saw they \u25a0 evi
dently put helms hard aport and were turning
to the westward. '. We were then turning very
rapidly to starboard with port helm, â¢â¢\u25a0 and we
had : turned, I think, â¢ almost to the east. The
Texas was well on our- starboard side. I then
gave the order -'hard aport' to the helmsman,'
ran through the opening betwen the shield and
conning tower on purpose to see our own fleet
and our relative , positions. Quicker than I
could" tell , it ", the commodore called -to- me:
'Cook, . hard aport! i. Or, is your helm:! aport?'
I answered: "The helm la hard aport," turning
as rapidly \u25a0 as '. possible.' â¢ â¢ As \u25a0 ' I â¢ watched : the
Texas the bow of the Brooklyn seemed first to
point to her port bow. I never saw the star
board.'' bow of the - Texas, and changing our
bearing very ' rapidly the bow of the Brooklyn
passed along the port side of the Texas until
there, was a clear opening between us and the
stern of the Texas. I made a* complete turn,
a very quick turn, with helm hard aport until
we came around and paralleled the fleet on the

"I heard the executive officer call out: 'Clear
tho ship for action,' and as I hadvglven di
rections to have the ship ready, for inspection
I knew, at once something was happening. I
went on deck immediately." \u25a0
"Had you had any intimation the night be
fore that the fleet was coming out?"
"No. I turned in the- night before about
midnight, feeling rather the other way, all
hope of their coming out having been given
up." ' '
"When you came on deck where were the
Spanish ships?" - \u25a0 â¢â¢
"When. I first arrived on the ' forecastle there
were two in sight. The third one was Just in
side the entrance .and the fourth appeared
afterward."- /
.When Spaniards Came Out.
General interest was manifested throughout
the courtroom when Hanna began his in
quiries about the battle of July S. He asked:
"\Wre you on deck when the fleet came out
of Santiago harbor on July 3, -when they were
first sighted?"
'The reply was in the negative; he had at
that time been in the cabin.
"How did you first learn the fleet was com
ing out?" ,\u25a0 .
"It is possible to have an order Mr battle
if you know Just what conditions you are
going to meet. The idea with "us was to be
able to fight the Spanish fleet whenever we
should meet It. I think that was understood
by all. I so understood It."'
"If the fleet had come, out of the harbor
previous to June \u25a0 1, what would you have
done"?
"We would have obeyed the orders of the
commanding officer."
â¢ "Were the fighting ships always in order
for battle"?
"I always supposed they were; the Brook
lyn was always in excellent order." .
Replying to questions concerning the block
ade of Santiago, Captain Cook said that Com
modore Schley'8 constant idea was that the
vessels should be kept well supplied with coal
and kept moving constantly, as his theory
was that the Spanish fleet would come out of
th. Â¥ harbor.
"Why was the circular . blockade not
adopted" ? Hanna' asked.
"There are many forms of blockade, and I
have nothing but praise for the circular
blockade," replied the witness, "but the idea
was to get the Spaniards to come out and to
have our ships moving and ready for action."
"What were your orders of battle from
May 13 to June 1" ?
"We did not have any. The fleet was al
ways in condition for action."
"Do you call that a battle order"?
The -witness J.then in response to questions
detailed the. retrograde movement' of the fly
ing squadron toward , Key .West, beginning
May 2fi. He said his first information that
such a movement was to. be. undertaken, was
when he received orders to" move. He - had,
he said, informed Commodore Schley â¢ on the
evening of. the 27th that he found the sea had
become calm enough to -coal and had found
that the commodore had ; also reached the
same conclusion.
Retrograde Movement.
"What did you say to "him"? '-\u25a0
"I think I said, 'You decided wisely,' "
.|Did you say, 'I congratulate" ?"-
I don't recollect. I may or may not. I
think it was a - subject of congratulation."
Captain Cook related the particulars of the'
meeting with, the scout 3 --off Santiago and told
of Captain Cotton and Captain Sissbee com
ing on board. Speaking, of Captain Sigsbee's
visit he told of his bringing the pilot Nunez
aboard, but, Cap,tAln I Cock j said that \u25a0 he had
not at first , been) inspired- ' with confidence in
that- individual, . Although < he afterward found
that he wp.a a. reliable man." ' .

Admiral Deweyâ May I interrupt? How near
did you pass to the Texas?
NO' Danger of Collision.
"I never thought of a collision. It never en
tered my head. I never for a -moment had
one idea or vicissitude in that respect. Wo
passed, I judge, about 400 yards. I had handled
the ship under all circumstances and I got so
I could Judge pretty correctly, and my im
pression was that we were about the distance
we sailed in squadron. But a collision I never
thought of. She turned perfectly clear of the
Texas, came around and then we had the Vis
caya on our starboard bow and about abeam
was the Oquendo and then the Colon. At the
time I thought it was the Teresa, but I - soon
discovered this vessel was dropping out and
heading for the beach. â¢ That was about the
hottest time of the action. It was a critical
time. There was not any time- for -indiscretion
and I do not think there was any. I have al
ways felt in my mind, in . studying the posi
tions, that the' chances would have been for a
disaster had we shifted helm at such a time.
However, we got around and we had those three
vessels. I looked and could see nothing but
smoke astern and the vessels seemed enveloped
in -this smoke. I could not understand it. I
could not understand exactly how we got I here.
They were all three firing on the Brooklyn.
..when almost immediately, faster than I could
tell it. I saw a large white boat In the water
and through this smoke I saw the bow of a
vessel. I exclaimed at the time, 'What was
that? 1 . The navigator, who was near me, said
It was the . Massachusetts or something to that
effect. I said she was away, and he then Bald
that it was the Oregon. I felt perfectly as
sured from that moment. She came up very
rapidly. She was making more speed than we
were at that time. She had all her boilers on,
had shifted boilers that morning from forward
to aft.. She had steam and hot water on."
"Where was the Oregon with respect to the
Brooklyn at that time?"
"I estimated 600 yards. She passed in be
tween the Texas and the Iowa. She got in be
tween that opening, came to the northward of
the Texas and came out about 800 yards from
ub. I mean a perpendicular course, and that
would account for just what we made to the
southward in turning. We made more than the
tactical diameter because we passed part of
that distance with helm half aport."
"What is the tactical diameter of the Brook
lyn?"
; "About 650 yards. '
"Was it easy to handle the ship under such
circumstances?"
"I never have seen one equal to her."
"Was the starboard engine of the Brooklyn
reversed during that turn?"
"It was not. There was some question about
that. The reason I feel positive of that is in
recalling the circumstances. My impression is
It may have been the commodore or the navi
gator, one of the two, said something about
backing the starboard engine. My reply, I
remember very well, was I did not want to
lose the speed of the ship. That she was
turning all right and rapidly and I wanted to
keep the speed of the ship."
â¢ "At the time you saw the Oregon coming
out of the smoke was she on your starboard?"'
"Starboard quarter."
"And between you and the Spanish ships?"
"Never between us and the Spanish ships."
"Where . were the Spanish ships at that
time?"
"There never was anything between us and
the Spanish ships. She was on our starboard
quarter."
"Nearer in-shore?"
"Yes."
Cook Ordered the Turn.
"Referring back now to certain points in the
story, as I did not care to Interrupt you, you
state you heard the' commodore say at one
time, 'Hard aDort.' That was after you hail
begun to moke the turn and the helm was
hard aport?" - -* t
"Yes, the helm was aport. but not hard aport
There was perfect understanding between the
commodore and myself."
"I will ask if your recollection is clear as
to whether the helm was put hard aport by
yourself first or that you did it in obedience
to an order from the commodore?"
"I gave the order on my own responsibility.
No question about that. It was not after hav
ing heard the commodore. He called out to
me. as I have stated, which I now think \u25a0was
simply to confirm himself in the Idea that she
was turning with a hard aport helm."
"At that time did you hear any conversa
tion between the commodore and the navi
gator?"
"I did not."
"Did you see any torpedo-boats?"
"I did not" . .
"Were you afraid of being rammed at 1 the
time the turn was made?"
"No. There "*a3 something said about It,
but I did not give it a second thought from
the fact that I knew they could not ram
unless they got within my turning circle."
"Were you afraid of blanketing the fire of
our fleet by turning one way or the other?"
"We might have done it by turning the other
way." - \u25a0 \u25a0 .
"Had you turned with a starboard instead of
a port helm, would such action have advanced
you so far as to. bring you within the line of
movement of the enemy's ships?"
"Provided they had taken advantage of it;
that is to say, if they had . continued on their
course southwest straight for ua, and we had
turned so as to bring them within our turning
circle, it would have made ramming possible,
certainly."
"How were they heading .when this order
hard aport was iriven?"
"They were heading southwest."
"Were they then headed so had you gone
;the other way â "
Schley Always Brave.
"And they discovered the movement? Tes,
I think they would. The chart distance given
at the time was 1100 yards. I estimated 1300
yards and so made it in my report. In the
first place we must have lost by shifting helm
at such a time. Then If we had turned the
other way we must have gone 700 yards. They
would not have had much distance to run
to get entirely .within our turning circle. That
Is all conjecture.".. . -T vj* . . - .' .
Hanna â What was the conduct and bearing
of Commodore Schley while under fire on such
occasions that you had the opportunity of ob
servinc? . ,' .
"I always regarded him as an enthusiastically
brave and patriotic officer. Never in any other
way." \u25a0- . ! '

to interrogatories by Hanna, who asked: .

."He started as Boon as he found the Texas
had enough coal. . My Impression is that he
said he should go to Santiago; that if he found
it practicable to coal from colliers \u25a0 there he
should stay. If they got too short \u25a0 of coal
he would go to Gonaives -Bay to try some

There was then, he said, . considerable -talk
on the part of the commodore concerning the
coal supply, he feeling that If the then pres
ent expenditure was to continue it would not
continue long. He was still especially cor
cerned about the Texas and had said to him
(Captain Cook). that "we must lyep the ships
in fighting trim." They had consulted charts
and talked over the case, looking for a place
fit for coaling. . Finally, he said, they had
hit upon Gonaives Bay and had decided to lay
a course for that point. â¢\u25a0 ' . : ' . \u25a0
"The Idea,", he said, -."was' that, we should
proceed in the direction of Santiago and \u25a0 that
if we found the sea such -that we could coal
we would immediately institute the blockade,
but if not practicable to do that we would
proceed to Gonaives Bay and ' coal there."

The next day the. weather was squally and

Describing the departure of the flying squad
ron for Santiago the witness said that it was
made after dark in order to conceal Its \u25a0 in
tentions and that the lights . were darkened
for the same purpose. The run on the night
of the 24th was. he eald, fairly good.
Captain Cook recalled the arrival of the dis
patch; boat Hawk on May 24 with dispatches.
He was told that the Information was to the
effect that the Spanish fleet was In. Santiago,
"but," he said, "I was not especially ' im
preesed with that fact, as I had heard it be
fore."
He was, however, told that this informa
tion was' more positive than any which' had
yet been brought. The commodore, he said,
had toid him that the Hawk had brought
orders to the effect that the squadron should
proceed to Santiago if he (the commodore)
was satisfied that the Spaniards were not at
Cienfuegos, but he said Commodore Schley had
said: "I am not satisfied that they, are not
here. I still believe they are here."
"If satisfied that the Spaniards . were at
Cicnfuesos why did you leave there"? asked
Hanna.
"Because of McCalla' s report from the in
surgents on shore."
"That, then, made it clear that the Span
lards were not , there" ?
Speaking of the coal supply of the vessels of
the flying squadron while at- Cienfuegos Cap
tain Cook said that his only anxiety was con
cerning the Texas, whose supply was light. It
had been found difficult to coal that ship on
account of its sponsons. He said in this con
nection that Commodore Schley had always
been persistent . In keeping the ships as full
of coal as possible, availing himself of every
opportunity to take- en fresh supplies. ' In re
ply to questions he said he had never been es
pecially anxious about the coal supply of the
Brooklyn, "although there were times when he
should have been glad to have more."
"We talked on various subjects at first. ' I
think Captain McCalla 'informed him he had
mining materials' for the Insurgents and that
he was going to communicate. with the insur
gent camp.'.' We brought' \u25a0â¢ up the' .question
about the camp and where it yas. and- then
the commodore said to him: 'We have seen
three peculiar \u25a0 lights, \u25a0 one- ahead of .the other
here, but we cannot make-out what they are
end I believe .it *is ' something in connection
with the Spanish, fleet.' Captain McCalla gave
a. start,- threw up his. hands and said: 'That
is the insurgents from the Insurgent camp.
They want to communicate with you,' and
added, 'Well, I can go there' and find out at
once.' The commodore told htm to go, to get
off as soon as possible, and added, 'You can
send a boat across and- let, me know as soon
as possible." Then thp subject of coaling came
up again about the \u25a0 great difficulty we were
going to ha%e in coaling from colliers, and
Captain McCalla said: "You need not be at all
concerned about me. J.wM get coal if there
is any coai to be obtained.' He was always
cheerful about everything. He started from
the ship almost immediately and .said, 'I
must get off.' In the meantime, closely con
nected with that, was the arrival of the Adula.
This steamer came in from Jamaica and re
ported that the Spanish, fleet had gone into
Santiago and had left on the 19th. I recol
lect that particularly, because that seemed to
confirm the commodore's Idea that they had
reached Cienfuegos. It was a suspicious craft.
They did not give any clear reason for going
in except they wanted to communicate with
their subjects, and in my conversation with
the commodore my impressions were that he
looked upon that as entirely suspicious. Not
understanding the matter and not knowing
exactly his object I said something to him
about letting the steamer go in. He said: 'I
don't care anything about that steamer, but I
am bound to get Information from her. If the
captain does not give it I will certainly get it
out of some of the passengers.' It was ar
ranged that when she came out an officer
should go aboard and get information from
them. She did not come out. That ' confirmed
him still more that they were there. Then the
Eagle came down in the evening and reported
that they had opmmunlcatod with the insur
gents and that the Spanish squadron was not

Nunez was then excused, and the judge ad
vocate was about to call Commander Mason
when Admiral Dewey suggested that as it was
then ten minutes to 4 the court should ad
journ. Accordingly the court adjourned until
11 o'clock to-morrow.
Ot cross-examination the witness said that
Ceb-reco had given him the names of the
Spanish vessels inside the harbor. He gave
the names of those vessels, saying that they
were given to him at that time by Cebereco.
Tbe witness also said that prior to goins:
ashore June 1 he had not seen the Colon. He
ha/1 not seen that vessel. Indeed, until July 3.
Ht said that his reason for thinking the ves
sels could not get into the harbor of Santiago
was that such large vessels as those of the
Spanish fleet had never before been seen there;
hr thought the harbcr both too narrow and too
shallow. He had expressed the opinion that
Unless they had "double machinery" (twin
screws) they could not get in without the as
sistance of tugs.
Captain Parker then read a copy of the let
ter which the pilot said he had carried from
Commodore Schley to the Cubans, In which ha
suggested a code of signals similar to thÂ«
code arranged by Captain McCalla at Cienfue

On June 1 he had gone on tha Vixen to the
Cuban coast with a. massage for General Calixlo
Garcia, which he had delivered to Colonel
Cebereco. Commodore Schley had sent him on
this mission and he had been told then by
Cebereco that the Spanish fleet was in the
harbor. This Information, Nunez said, he had
carried to Admiral Sampson, under the direc
tion of Commodore Schley.
Nunez said he first met Commodore Schley on
May 26, having been taken to him by the St.
Paul. The commodore, he said, asked him if
he knew of the presence of the Spanish fleet
at Santiago. He replied that he doubted it, as
he did not think the water was deep enough for
vessels of such size.
Edward Nunez the Cuban pilot, was called
as the first of Admiral Schley! s witnesses. An
Interpreter waa introduced, as Nunez cannot
speak English. He said, he had been a pilot
for, twenty-one years in all the Southern Cu
ban ports. The interpreter used the- word
"guide" in interpreting his statement aÂ» Â«boiro.
and Admiral Dewey corrected him, raying the
word should be "pilot."
"Pilot," Not a "Guide."
"How far were the vessels of the flying
squadron off the entrance of the port of San

"The blockade was closer and closer all the
time. The nrst night I should say that It was
between five and six miles off and about seven
miles oft at day. They steamed In a circle
from five to six miles from the entrance anil
from four to five miles each side, so as to

WASHINGTON 1 . Oct. 14.â The Coast and
Geodetic Survey has established a mag
netic observatory at Sitka, Alaska, and is
constructing another at Ha
waii, to co-operate with, the; British and
German governments in investigating
problems of the magnetic forces and nee
dle variations throughout the world. Thl3
Is in connection with one German and two
British expeditions for the south pole on
plans long ago formulated. The co-opera
tion of tnis and other governments was
asked by Germany and the movement
now well under way. so far as the pre
liminary work is concerned, contemplates
magnetic observations at fixed observa
tories throughout the world simultaneous
ly withlhe actual scientific researches in
the south polar regions. Both; the Amer
ican observatories will be re^dy to as
sume their part of the co-operation at the
time designated in February next. The
work .of the expeditions is lUccly to oc
cupy 'two or three years, and its value is
largely dependent on the observations
similarly and simultaneously made In dif
ferent parts of the world. It Is expected
to determine tho question vjhether all
magnetic disturbances, and phenomena
are subject to a common and ivorld-widj
cause instead of being of a local charac

!t. It was the custom on board the Brooklyn
for the smooth log, v/hen it was written, to
be read by the officers and signed by them,
afterward by the navigator, when It was sub
mitted to me. I sometimes had time to look
at It and sometimes did not. I do not believe
I looked at It within three or four days after
that battle. I may have looked at it, but the first
real recollection I have of it was when my at
tention was called to the fact that the navi
gator wanted to make it more full and com
plete. I said: 'Write It up as you recollect it
and submit it to me, but no changes are to be
made under any circumstances in the log as
it stands now. It can be added to, but not any
changes In the original log.' So he wrote this,
and I signed it. I have since read It and da
not know which Is the best account."
"You refer now to the addendum?"
"Yes. At that time there was no question
about the way the ship turned. I suppos* I
would have noticed it had it been done, but I
probably did not see it until after that change
was made. I certainly would have seen It be
fore."
Letter Is Not Admitted. .
"Do you recollect a visit of Mr. Sharp to the
Brooklyn and an interview, at which the com
modore and yourself were present, about the
direction in which 1 the Brooklyn turned on that
morning?"
"No. I may state I was not present at any
such interview."
"If the court please, I should like to hand to
the witness a letter, apparently signed by him
self and dated September 28, IS'jS. tho letter
which was' referred to by Admiral Evans- when
he was giving his testimony and which he de
sired to read at that time. An objection was
made then, counsel suggesting that the proper
course would be when Captain Cook went on
the stand."
Captain Cook was handed the letter by Hanna
to identify. \u25a0
Admiral Deweyâ Has the letter anything, to
do with any of these specifications?
Judge Advocateâ Not specifically.
Admiral Deweyâ Then it better not be read.
Captain Cook â Mr. President, I would like to
have it read for this reason: It has been re
ferred to, and seems to convey the idea that
there was an Issue between Captain Evans and
myself. I think, as It is on the record that
such a letter has passed, there should not be
any doubt about the matter.
Admiral Dewey â I do not think It has any
thing to do with the case.
Captain Cookâ It is my letter and my signa
ture.
Admiral Dewey â Admiral Evans is not on
trial; Captain Cook is not on trial.
Captain Cook said there was no Issue be
tween himself and Admiral Evans. The letter
was not read.
The court asked a number of questions of
Captain Cook, which, with the answer', were
as follows:
"How did you become aware of the orders
under which the flying squadron sailed. May
19, to Cienfuecos?"
"Conversation with Commodore Schley."
"What general orders were issued by Com
modore Schley regarding the blockade of Cien
fueeos?"
Schley "Was Enthusiastic.
"I cannot recall that there were any written
orders. I think it was (of course, I understood,
being in command of his flagship) understood
in consultation with the captains In a general
way."
"Was any effort made by boats of the flying
squadron to find a landing place near Cienfue
gos prior to the arrival of the Marblehead?"
"None that I know of."
"Did any conversation take place between you
and Commodore Schley in regard to obtaining
information from Captain McCalla when the
Marblehead passed the Brooklyn -while the last
named vessel was en route to Cienfuegos?"
"None that I can recall.'.'
"What reasons did Commodore Schley give
you for his belief that Cervera's squadron was
In CienfueÂ£os?"
"In. the nrst place, upon leaving Key West,
he was quite enthusiastic at having been given
the command of the south side of Cuba and he
said he expected to catch that fleet; that both
he and Commander in Chief Sampson believed
Cienfuegos was the objective point. I think I
have already stated that he believed he would
find them there. On Saturday night he beard,
or some officers had reported to him, what
sounded like a salute in the afternoon. I never
have known what that was. Certainly some
thing of the kind occurred, and he said it
sounded as if they were having some kind of
jubilee. When we arrived at Cienfuegos there
were the signal lights that misled us all. We
thought that they had something to do with
the Spanish squadron either coming or being
there. And again, the arrival of the Adula and
her strange action. I believed at that time
they were there, and I thought this was a ruse
to get some communication to them. That Is
all I pan recollect."
"Did the Brooklyn have a, fleet night-order
book?"
"I am not able to answer that question. On
the Brooklyn I received my Instructions, of
course, direct from the flag officer. I had my
own night-order book and what orders I re
ceived I put in that."
"Did you examine the sailing directions for
information regarding the possibility of coalin<
ship near Cape Cruz?"
"Yes." H.i -; â¢;
"What orders were given by Commodore
Schley to the ships of tha flying squadron for
their guidance in the event of Cervera's squad
ron arriving at the harbor of Clenfuegos in
the event of Cervera'a squadron being sighted
at sea and in the event ot its coming out of
the harbor of Santiago?"
Governed by Circumstances.
"I know of no written order that would cover
the case, but in consultation with the com
manding officers it was understood that at
night time. we would be In column and ready
During the day time we had our assigned posi
tions: that .we should attack wherever we
found them and I presume be governed by cir
cumstances."

K. W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.~Oflicial
Washington Is finding soirie encourage
ment In the fact that although a week
has elapsed since the expiration of the
time limit fixed by the brigands for the
ransom or Miss Stone, she is still alive.
From Mr. Eddy, Secretary of the Lega
tion In Constantinople, and Mr. Dickin
son, Consul General at Sofia, dispatches
were received yesterday and to-day by tne
tstacs Department. Assistant Secretary
Hill, who has just returned from his va
cation, is now-acting as \u25a0secretary in place
of Second Assistant Secretary Adee and
he is devoting special attention to the
Stone case, The department Is unwilling
to divulge the cablegrams in its posses
sion, but it is known that Miss Stone is
biill alive.
Mr. Dickinson Is not in communication
with the brigands and Mr. IMdy has trou
ble in ccrrrmunicating with them. As soon
as the full amount of ransom is received
in Constantinople he will arrange to con
vey it to thera In such manner tnat simul
taneously with Us delivery the American
missionary will be released. In view of
the assurances given by the Turkish and
Bulgarian authorities the officials here
seem confident that they will not direct
any attack by their troops upon the brl
pands, and Miss Stone is consequently re
lieved from the danger which would* ac
company such a move. All the money for
Miss Stone's release has not yet been col
lected, but a large sum has been remitted
to Constantinople. The State Department
is hopeful that the balance will be
promptly raised and in the meantime its
events will endeavor to induce the bri
gands to sccept a smaller ransom than
they demanded.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 14.â It trans
pires that the Turkish commander had
completed preparations to surround Miss
Stone's cap;ors at noon last Saturday.
Bpencer KdÂ£y, Secretary of the United
States Legation, received advices that

Tf TT -r) ASHINGTON, Oct. ' : 14.â To-
\\ V day, jn the Schley court of
" >\/N\/ inquiry", " "Judge Advocate
V' V Lemly concluded the. pre
! Ecntatlon of- testimony 'for
! the Gcyei-nment, and the first of Admiral
j Schlny's witnesses was introduced. Cap
i tain Francis A. Cook, who commanded
Admiral (then Commodore) Schley's flags.
? hip, the Brooklyn, during the Santiago
campaign, and who acted, though unoftl
cially, in the capacity of. chief of staff for
! the commodore, was on the witness stand
; the greater part of the day. He was f ol
1 lowed by Lieutenant Commander "Wijliam
j Fullham, who was senior watch oincer
I 'on the New Orleans during the Spanish
: war, and former Lieutenant Joseph Beale,
' who was' an officer on the Harvard, trans
lated the cipher dispatches between Cora
1 modore Schley and the 'Navy Department
carried by that vessel. Among those dis- ;
: patches was that sent by Commodore
'. Schley May 28 expressing regret at not
| having been able to obey the orders of the
department and explaining the | reason
I why he could not do so. There are some
i verbal discrepancies between the origi
nal draft of tnis dispatch and the official
print of it, and these Beala explained.
Lieutenant lieale was the last of the
Government witnesses, although Captain
Lemly explained that he would reserve
the right to call others if occasion should
; demand that he do so. He had no sooner
i retired than the first witness for Admiral
Schley was called. This proved to*, be
the Cuban pilot Kduardo Nunez, who told
Schley on May. 28, li>9S,that he did not
believe the Spanish lleet under Cervera
was in the harbor, at Santiago..
Captain Cook's testimony wus a review
of tne entire campaign after Cervera's
rleet, beginning wltli tne departure of the
Hying squadron from Key We3t on May t
19 and concluding with the battle off
Santiago July 3. He said. that at first it
liad been believed by both, Sampson and
Schley that the Spanish fleet was in the
harbor at Cienfuegos and that no infor
mation to the contrary had been conveyed
to Commodore Schley until the arrival
of Captain McCalla on May 24; that it was
Commodore Schley's expectation to meet
the Spaniards in the open sea and his con
stant care whh to have coal enough for
such emergency. He gave particulars, con
cerning the retrograde movement, and ex
plained the Brooklyn's loop in connection
with the graphic account of the engage
ment cf July 8. Asked for an opinion as
to SchleyJs bearing as a commanding offi
cer, he said:
"I always regarded him as an enthu
siastically brave and patriotic officer." .
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOOP.
Brooklyn's Captain Declares He Or
dered the Famous Turn.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Captain Francis A.
Cock was the first new witness called before the
Schley court of Inquiry to-day. He was called
by the Navy Department, but as he also is on
Admiral Schley'6 list of witnesses, he was
considered, like Lieutenant-Commander Hodg
scn and Lieutenant Doyle, as a witness for
both sides of the controversy. During the war
with Spain Captain Cook was commander of the
flagship Brooklyn and also Admiral Schley' s
chief of staff, thus occupying the same rela
tive position to Admiral Schley that Captain
Chadwick occupied to Admiral Sampson/ His
appt-arance on the stand therefore created con-
Eiaerable interest and his testimony was listen
ed to attentively. Other, witnesses eumaion
ed-by the department for the day were Lieu
tenant-Commander William F. Kullam, who
was on the New Orleans during the Santiago
campaign, and Lieutenant Joseph LJeale, wno
was on the scout ship Harvard and who vol
unteered to go ashore and ascertain whether
the Spanish fleet under Cervera was in the
harbor of Santiago.
The first of the witnesses recalled for the
correction of testimony was Lieutenant-Com
mander Staunton, formerly of the New York,
who made an addition to his statement as to
the first news he received from. Captain Allen
at Key West on May 20 concerning the pres
ence of the Spanish â¢ fleet at Santiago. The
addition was as follows:
"The information obtained at that time from
Captain Allen and reported to the commander
in-chlef some time near noon was not con
eindered sufficient at that time to cause a
change- In the plan that had already been
adopted."
Captain F. E. Chadwlck also returned to the
stand for the purpose of correcting his former
evidence.
Captain Cook Is Called.
After previous witnesses had corrected their
testimony Captain Cook was called. He was
questioned by Hanna. He said he had been
at Key West on May 19. ..
"What information did you have at that time
concarn!ng the whereabouts of Cervera's fleet?"
asked Hanna.
"My impressions now are 6imply from ru
mor, that they had left the Canary Islands and
a' part of them had been sighted at Martinique
and from consular information, or, perhaps.
Information sent by the Harvard that they had
gone to Curacao, 'lhat is all from impression."
Giving the reasons for the departure of the
flylns 'squadron for Cienfuegos, Captain Cook
said the squadron had~been eent to that port
"to intercept and meet the Spanish squadron,
it having been determined, as we believed at
that time. to*make Clenfuegos their objective
port." He had understood that the Spanish
fleet carried munitions of war for Havana and
it was believed that they would go to Cienfue
gos because of its accessibility to Havana.
Captain Cook detailed a conversation between
Commodore Schley ar.d Captain Chester while
Ihe squadron was en route to Clenfuegos. He
said there had been talk between them about
coaling- on the southern coast of Cuba,
â¢â¢The only thing I recollect," he eald, "was
that Commodore Schley questioned Captain
Chester very closely, as to the facilities for
coaling ships on the south side of Cuba."
"Do you know what Information was re
ceived?" â¢ -
"I think they consulted a chart at the time,
and. something was said about Cape Cruz. I
recollect afterward looking at the chart there
and it did not seem to be a favorable place. I
know the subject of. coaling was early con
sidered even before leaving Key "West."
Not a Favorable Place.
Admiral Deweyâ Was your arfswer that Cape
Cruz did or did not look like a favorable place?
I did not quite understand that.
"I said I recollect very well my impressions
at that time were that Cape Cruz did not seem
a favorable place for coaling ships from col
liers." . ...
Hannaâ Perhaps the court would like to hear
why you thought so.
"I could not well see how thÂ» larger ships
could get far enough in there so that the col
liers would be smooth enough to go alongside
and coal ships."
Captain Cook recalled the meeting of the
llarblehead with the flying squadron en route
to Cienfuegos, but could . recall only, very in
distinctly the fact that, the Scorpion had de
lfvered to the Brooklyn any information from
the Eagle, at that time.
"I did not receive any Information." he said,
"and did not consider the incident important."
Captain Cook said that upon arriving off
Clenfuegos on the morning of May 22 a block
ade waa immediately established as the firing
of guns was heard and it was believed that
Cervera had arrived and a fete of honor of his
appearance was on. â¢ Earthworks on the shore
aleo were s*en, but they were not fired upon
because it was considered 'desirable not to un
necessarily expend ammunition.
"I think between that time and the arrival
of the Aflula it was presumed that the whole
beach waa occupied," he said., "We saw.cav
alry and others on 'the beach. The possibility
of a boat landing was talked of. >The idea
was that we would have to go in pretty well to
the westward and at night. - I may have had
some conversation with the commodore about
it, but I do not recollect. On the arrival of
the Adula we fully expected to get all infor
mation." / . \u25a0 ;
"Did you see any signal lights on shore while
you were there V :
"Yes. the first thing after we ' arrived, on
May 22." . * - *: - . , ....
"Where were those signal lights and what
were they?" -
"I judged them to have been about six or
eeven miles to the westward, three lights, one
ahead of the other, | very distinct. There was
come discussion on the ship whether these
were signals that the Spanish ships were go-
Ing there or whether they were already there. 1 ,'
ITo Doubt as to Signals.
"There could not have been any doubt what
ever, from the arrangements of these lights,
that they were Intended. as signals?"
"Oh. no: their appearing at the time they
did and remaining so . long, but we could not
determine from whom or to 'Whom, they were
sent." ,';,-\u25a0'". .\u25a0 - "i
Hanna questioned the witness concerning the

It comes from them with a seriousness which
does not always belong to matters which are
brought before us by some individual or some

offered to the canon as reported by the com

It was, or rather leave It Just exactly where
it Ftood before. The smendment means the. old
canon, with which you were dissatisfied. I
quite apree with the criticism which has been

The Rev. Dr. Cameron Mann of West

One thing that has been only faintly recog

matter comes up to this convention, not at the

resent that testimony. The figures do not
agree with him; they show that Italy is not
fven among the most immoral countries of
Europe, but that her standard of morality.,
as shown by statistics, is comparatively high.
If you are to be swayed by arguments of
this kin< I would adduce the instance of Ire

the chastest nation on the face of the earth,

the most obstinately Roman Catholic. It is to
the honor of Ireland that her percentage of il

than that of any other nation that compiles

state that immorality In Italy was the re
sult of the Roman church's teachings,
but it was rather the result of the fact
that divorce was prohibited on any
ground whatever, and that the clergy
themselves had been influenced thereby
to look upon it in a venial way, as the
people had. He certainly did not mean
for a moment to attribute this state of
Immorality to the teaching of the Roman
Catholic priests.
Rev. Dr. Mann resumed, saying:
A great share of the discussion on this ques
tion has been at random. We have been dis
cussing whether people should be allowed to be
divorced and remarried. That Is not the ques
tion. Personally I believe in certain cases
in the right of people to a divorce and to a
remarriage. Personally I believe that there are
other causes besides adultery for which a di
vorce might be granted and one of the parties
be free to remarry. â¢
Those- things are the exceptions for â¢which It
was sought to find some remedy In 'the canon
which will be submitted to you immediately
after this one. the canon on the discipline of
persons once divorced in marrying again. The
question now is simply as to whether the clergy
of this church shall solemnize the marriage
of any divorced person.
The church does not say to any person under
this canon: 'You shall not be remarried after
divorce." It simply says to our clergy: "You
shall not marry any person who Is divorced
where the former partner Is still living.
DE. McKIM ATTACKS CANON".
The Rev. Dr. McKim of "Washington
delivered a stirring 1 speech, as follows:
I would like to say a word or two to clear
up my own position in regard to a question of
the interpretation of Holy Scripture. In an
nouncing my own conviction that this canon
would be in violation of the teaching: of our
Lord Jesus Christ and in contradiction to the
Holy Gospels, I, of course, did not intend to
imply for a single moment that other gen
tlemen upon this floor, who took a different
view of the meaning of the Holy Scripture,
were not absolutely entitled to their own opin
ion, nor did I wish to cast any imputation upon
them; but the question- is simply this: j
Something has been said this morning about
the gratitude which dwells In the heart be-
Between two interpretations of Holy
Scripture which shall control and direct â¢ the
legislation of this church, that which has
controlled among us for a hundred years, that
which has behind it the opinion and the testi
mony of all Protestant Christendom, of the
whole Eastern church and of the united voice
of the episcopate, or shall it . be an \u25a0interpre-'
tatlon which Is defended. chiefly on Roman in
terpretation and by a few Anglican divines,
and in America by Bishop Hall and some others
and the Rev. Dr. Brlggs?
I would like to say that the interpretation
which I believe to be the true one is supported
by a larsre number of the greatest divines In
the old and in modern times.
FURTHER consideration of the '
work of the Board of Missions
was held last night at Trinity
Church. There was a large at
tendance of lay and clerical
delegates and the most Impor
tant topics of interest to the
church were considered. "Go ye therefore
end teach all nations" was the text from
v.hich was preached the sermons of the
visiting missionary Bishops.
An enthusiastic congregation, composed
of workers in the missionary field, asseni
bied to meet the Bishops. As each one
told of the difficulties encountered In pro
pagating the Gospel in his chosen or as
signed Held the auditors listened with
rapt attention. The newly acquired ter
ritories of the United States, gathered In
during the war with Spain, and the in
congruous religious combinations that
were developed since that time came in
for lengthy explanations.
The Bishop of New York, who has
charge of the work in the Philippines; the
Bishoris of Peru and Brazil, who are also
in his province, as is also the Bishop of
"West Virginia, gave interesting details of
the work of their assistants. The work

The Rev. Dr. Roller . of We3t Virginia

I Just ' a single word , in regard to a question
that I trust will touch the hearts and the minds
of all here. I ask the members of this 'house:'
' "Will â¢ you ,. put a ycke.upon the, consciences
of a great majority of the clergy of this church,
a majority of the clergy. of this body,. and a ma
jority of perhaps three-fourths of the clergy
of- the whole '.United States by Imposing this

uary no divorce will be legal in the District of

That was brought about by Christian unity.
Adopt this amendment and you take away
from the 'church this leadership in that re
spect; you make it impossible for us to stand
with our brethern and work with them for the
purification of the family. I regard this meas
ure as absolutely fatal, and I regard it as abso
lutely: fatuous if it is supposed for a single
moment that its adoption is to have any such
effect as that. And ; then I want to say that
it will weaken the moral protest that this
church is now \u25a0 making against unlawful di
vorces. -.'..-.
Consider that at the, present time thlschurch
is leading the opinion of the Protestant
churches upon this matter. Some time ago in
the diocese of "Washington there was a com
bination formed under the leadership of the
Bishop of Washington, different, clergymen
of different congregations came - together - and
agreed to petition. Congress: to -abolish all
causes of .divorce, except, adultery, and that
has been successful; and after the 1st of Jan-
Now, 6lr, I ask these questions: Has this rig
orous theory which some of the committees
confess lies behind the legislation ever been
efficacious ? Has it been efficacious in Porto
Rico for the last four hundred years, or In
Spain. ' cr the Philippines for- the last four
hundred years? In regard to this whole sub
ject I appeal to â¢the intelligence of those who
hear me not to vote to engraft a principle upon
our canon law, which, wherever it has been
tried. : has not conduced to the purity : of the
home,' and if It has reduced the number of
divorces has done so at the . cost of an in
crease of concubinage and adultery.
But it is said that this canon does not touch
the right of the innocent party to marry again.
It is defended upon contradictory . grounds.
Some tell us it means, the indlssolublllty of
marriage. Then other members \u25a0 of : the â¢ com
mittee get; up and tell us no, it does not
touch the question of the right of the inno
cent "party to marry, .it only Is a question re
lating to the use of the marriage service. Then,
gentlemen.^of the convention, .this canon has
lost In moral significance if that Is true. Then
it means only Just, this:
A canon/ to protect the marriage service, ' not
to protect the home;' it is a canon not for the
purpose of conserving.' morality, but . a canon
for the purpose of fencing around . the mar
riage service of our prayer 'book. â¢. \u25a0
Now. sir, here is a confession ., of the impo
tence of this canon. . . -
I hope this convention will not be' stampeded
into legislation of this kind j upon the ground
that we must do something. It Is remarkable,
but it is a fact, that not one speaker upon
this floor has even attempted to show In what
way this canon would help to restrain di
vorce. We have had a great deal of beautiful
eloquence about the purity of the family and
the sanctity of the home, but no one has
given us a single reason . for believing that
either the sanctity of the home or the purity
of the family would be conserved or protected
by such legislation as this. Wny, sir, they came
to us like a quack doctor, saying: "Take this
nostrum of mine, it will cure." We want to
known what is in the prescription; we want to
know how it will have the effect of curing us
before we swallow it. ,.-,.. - \u25a0 . .
cause the House of Bishops has taken this ac
tion. I would like to call attention to the racl
that, although our own House of Bishops, by
a narrow majority, has passed this canon,
nevertheless this is in conflict with the voice
of the universal episcopate of the Anglican
Communion.

The. Rev. j Dr. Hah of Delaware cham
pioned the canon in the following speech:
I submit that this is in the nature of hurried
legislation,- and hurried legislation does not
accord with the conservatism qt this church.
I. know you may smile and consider It pre
sumptuous, in me to say that after this com
mission has had this matter in charge for so
long that ; now we are in danger of hurried
legislation, but I believe it, and because I
believe it I want to offer the following amend
ment: \u25a0. - â¢ ' . . . . .
A delegateâ I would like to ask if it
would not practically amend the mar
riage ' service to read: "Until death or
adultery doth us part"?
Dr.'Roller resumed, saying: ',

tlon, commanded what the church of her
fathers did not allow. What do these things
indicate if they do not indicate that the church
of the living God: is helping to open the gates
through which is rushing the tide which event
ually will engulf our civilization and make our
land the greatest desolation of the ages?
Our Anglo-Saxon civilization Is doomed un
less they who represent it at its strongest and
its best resolve that the sanctity and the integ
lity of the family must and shall.be preserved.
Thousands upon thousands are at this very
hour looking â¢ to this convention in the strong
hope that we, with confidence and courageous
convictions, will give this church" of ours the
prestige of masterly leadership in the great
movement for social regeneration.
.CLAIMS CANON IS "UNFAIR.
The Rev. Dr. Grammer of Southern Vir
ginia said in part:
I am prepared to support five propositions. I
am prepared to support the proposition that the
term translated in the Bible "unchas
tlty" means adultery. I claim that
the general, phrase here acquires a
particular significance, and I assert that it it
does not. then Christ is not a safe moral guide;
first because he will either allow a double
standard of morality, saying that a man can
put away a woman' In case she has been un
chaste before marriage, which if it does not ap
ply to" ' her i makes him uphold a
double standard; If it does not ap
ply to the man. makes Christ have a double
standard, and if does apply to the man makes
Christ open the largest door for divorce that
was ever opened: saying of every man who Is not
perfectly chaste that his wife upon discovering
prematrimonlal Infidelity can become divorced.
But the general tenor of the passage is that
Christ is limiting divorce. I therefore claim he
i is not opening the door; he is closing it. The
word must be considered as havins a special
significance, j It must mean adultery. I call
upon the rector of St. Bartholomew's to bring
out of the secrecy or his own breast, the rea
sons that make him depart from so intelligent
an lntei oretatlon. \u25a0 I call upon him and as*
him to say why it Is he departs from the judg
ment of such scholars as Lisrhtf oot and those
who have been specified. He can't keep it
quiet because we are bound to specify to the
world and It is not a matter of private Judg-
I charge" and claim that this action degrades
marriage, making It a spiritual union that can
only be "dissolved physically by death, instead
of a spiritual union. that can be dissolved by
a spiritual act. one specified by Jesus Christ.
HI claim that this action Is against the prayer
book . and the . language of the â¢ service. | The
gentleman- asks, how is It that they do not
specify adultery? â¢ Our church is a church of
good taste, and so it covers up the whole trans
action in .this "phrase, "I take .thee, John: I
take \u25a0 theey. Mary, according to God's holy ordi
nance." That qualifies It all â "according to
God's ordinance"; and it contains that.speci
fication. I . would . like to ask. how Is it that
you are going, to be so rigorous that the chair
man of .; the â¢ committee on canons will stand
up \u25a0 and i say, â¢ , "I favor- separation," when the
same service says, l "I â¢ will cleave unto. her. I
will cherish her, I will love her." And yet he
says I am in . favor Â» of \u25a0 sesaratlon. I charge
him to answer that' question. \u25a0"Â» \u25a0\u25a0 .."

Upon convening yesterday afternoon

were elected. The fifth, the Rev. Charles
Campbell Pierce, D.D., chaplain In the

The four clerics elected were the Rev

the district of Olympia. â¢
The five nominations were discussed at
length by the deputies and after prayers
had been offered a vote was taken The
reason Dr. Pierce's .nomination did not
receive \u25a0 favorable consideration was due
to his lack of experience. The denutiM

NEW PRELATES
ARE ELECTED
I belong to the class of those men who have
changed their minds upon this subject since
they came to this convention and since they
have listened so far to this debate.'. I came
here in favor of some euch principle as is ex
pressed in this message from the House of
Bishops. I . have . been changed by the consid
erations that have been given.' to the subject
by myself, and I am here to defend the
amendment proposed to that last clause. Then
again I belong to the class that has been
mentioned as having been generally in favor
of the mesrsaze of the House of Bishops un
amended, namely, the class of lawyers. I think
it Is a mistake to say that the lawyers of this
house are. In -favor of this article as it comes
from the House of Bishops. I want to con
sider some objections that have been urged to
the amendment. I want to refer to : the objec
tion based on the nrayer book. It Is almost
wrong- to seek to Influence our actions by an
appeal to a source as high as that, If the ap
peal be not well founded. And I say It ap
proaches a wrong to seek to Influence our ac
tion by the suggestion that the church in this
formulary has Sought to bind people to holy
matrimony until death do them part, regard
less of any or til circumstances. The gentle
men who are opposed to this amendment > say
they do not expect tho woman to \u25a0 love the
adulterous husband until death do them part?
Do they stand here Faying that. they want the
woman to obey the adulterous husband until
death do them part? There Is an element of mu
tuality in this contract and this obligation which
is taken under the sanction of the holy church.
The man says, though he does not say it in
words, "Iii consideration of the promise of the
woman to me I do thus promise," and the
woman says, "In consideration of what the
man hath said I do thus promise." In legal
principle, is that not the meaning of It? They
take each other In consideration of their mu
tual promises. Brethren of the law, don't put
the church as opposed to the principle of this
amendment.
DEPUTY LEWIS CLOSES DEBATE.
Deputy Lewis of Pennsylvania, in clos
ing the debate, said in part: .
Those who espect a display of oratorical py
rotechnics from me will be disappointed. I
feel that I have . a totally different duty to
perform to this house. It Is my duty to help
the house so far as lies In my power to reach
a right conclusion upon an exceedingly impor
tant subject. I may not succeed, .but I shall
try. I am more anxious to get a right con
clusion than I am to come to any, particular
conclusion.
I deprecate two things which have In a meas
ure crept Into this debate.' I deprecate any
suggestion that the persons who have taken
the side that I represent In this discussion are
arrogating to themselves . In any way, any par
tleular desire to pose as the defenders of the
family life of the United States. Such is not
the case. Every man on the floor of this con
vention Is equally interested In preserving the
family life of the United States, and it is a
mere question of methods â¢ as to how we can
best do it. I deprecate, on the other hand, the
suggestions that have been thrown out from
time to time that any particular set of -men
is trying to set at naught he teachings of our
Lord. That may be the effect of things In the
minds of Borne of the gentlemen, but it cer
tainly Is not the intention of, any one who
appears on either side of thla debate.
Again, I have been asked to state a precedent
for any action which would countenance legis
lation based on expediency in any church body,
because it has been said that this Is a" meas
ure of expediency. I recall having rtad In the
Holy Scriptures that pur Lord â¢ stated a i law
of marriage as . having been given In the be
ginning, and he said to Moses -"From the hard
ness of their hearts, suffer them to put away
their wives." , I venture to think that "the
hardness of their hearts 1 ' in the " English
language probably means as a measure of i ex
pediency at that time. 'And. If our 'Lord did
not condemn Moses for that â and he most as
suredly did not â It seems to me this church
to-day is Justified in debating : a measure . of
expediency upe-n this same subject.' ";. ; '
Before I plunge into what' I consider the Im
portant points of this debate I want to get
rid of a few things whlcn in my humble Judg-
In forty-three out of the forty-five* States of

that he had rendered more divorces in the last

sat on the bench In the United â¢ : States. I
asked him how many were baaed on the charge
of adultery. He said 4 per cent. * Are there

I agree that the Innocent party In a divorce
for the cause of adultery has a right to re
marry, and I beg to; say to this house that
at least three-fourths of your own committee
would have been, any time In the last three
years, and are willing to-day to endeavor to
secure that right to the Innocent party, pro
vided anybody can show us any possible way
of doing it In which we will'not do much fur
ther harm than good. Somebody " said . some
thing about the old canon.; I am willing to
talk about the old canon as much as anybody
wants, but If the old canon does not give a
roving commission to anybody to do precisely
what he pleases I am very much mistaken. I
recall having a case brought to me a while
ago under the old canon for divorce and I said:
I will advise you any way you please,, because
I wll} undertake to acquit you In tha ecclesias
tical court on any earthly thing you may do
under the old canon." (Laughter.) - We would
be very willing to bring In a canon here to
allow the innocent party to be remarried by
the clergy of the church If we knew how to
draw, that canon; The people who ask it don't
know how to draw that â¢ canon, \u25a0 and I don't
think they will ever find out, and. that Is ex
actly the difficulty and the necessity ol the
constitution.

ment have nothing on earth to do with it In
the nrat place, we are told that we are adopt
ing the Roman system. If by that it means"
to say -that the Roman Catholic church does
not solemnize the marriage of divorced per
sons, that It is true; it is also true that this
canon does not propose to allow the ministers
of our church to solemnize it. But If It Is
meant to say that we are,, by passing this
canon, adopting all that the Roman Catholic
church teaches on the subject of the lndls
solublllty of marriage, God forbid. In refer
ence to that clause at the end. "Unless the
former were annulled by the decree of a court
of competent Jurisdiction for cause existing be
fore such marriage"â that Is one thing that the
Roman church does and I think is the very
weak point of its system. It does not grant
divorces, but it' annuls marriages for causes
existing before marriage. And upon the part
of some of . our right . reverend fathers In
God, the Bishops, there has been in the last
eight or ten years a little evidence that they
were trying to do the same thing, and when
ever they have tried to-do it they have reached
this result, and as the result the committee
which had charge of this subject took care to'
see that nothing of that Roman theory should
ever get into the canons of this church. (Cries
of "good.") That is the explanation of that
clause. ">
On the recommendation of the Rev. Dr.
Egar, several new sections will be con
sidered by the house on the canon pro
viding for the formation of new dioceses,
the principal object .being? to keep the
question of the formation in the hands of
the General Convention. Both the above
questions were placed on the calendar.
The House of Bishops sent a message
to the House of Deputies for the forma
tion of a joint committee to consider the
prohibited degrees of marriage and to
continue the joint commission on Ameri
can churches in Europe.
The' resolution presented by the Rev.
Dr. McKim of "Washington to provide
for a joint commission to consider the re
lations of capital and labor was unani

At the close of the debate on the canon
on divorce the committee reported to the
House of Deputies. Leave was asked fcr
the committee to sit again and discuss
the canon on disciplining divorced persons
who remarried. The request was granted.
The house then adjourned until 3 p. m.
The Rev. Dr. Huntington, chairman of

are the Innocent parties, and you propose to
give them this canon and say to them that
they must do that very thing or they cannot
bo remarried in the Protestant Episcopal
Church. That is nonsense. -Who are the 4
per cent? I venture to suggest that A3 a ruls
they are not composed of the people that this
church wants to aid In the least; In other
words, as 1 heard It once said, applications
for divorce for that causa are very apt to be
applications for divorce in order to get some
body else. - /â¢
Then there are a great many cases which
come up where there has been what 1 call con
tributory negligence. If a man walks on the
railroad track and gets run o/er by a railroad
train it is a very unfortunate thing, but he
can't get a verdict for damages because he
has been guilty of contributory negligence.
There Is something like contributory negligence
In cases of \u25a0 divorce in this country, aa where
a woman allows her husband to do pretty much
as he pleases, or a man allows his wife to do
pretty much as she pleases and to be surround
ed with this man and that man, and she falls
into trouble. He Is not an Innocent party mere
ly because he has not been guilty of the act
of adultery,- but he is guilty of contributory
negligence; it gets to be a - question. of his
going- his way and she going her way, and ,a
roof Is the only thing that covers them. A
friend 6f mine met another friend In the street
a short time ago and said to him: "Well, I
. suppose you and your good wife are still living
happily 'together?" and hla reply was, â¢â¢Hap
pily, but . not together." (Laughter.) When
you eliminate all those people who do not re
sort to divorce for the cause of adultery be
cause they have other causes, and when you
eliminate from the 4 per cent that you have
In the general proportion of causes the num
ber who do not care much but get a divorce
from one i party In order that they may mar
ry another, v and when; you add to- those the
contributory negligence people there is a very
small residuum left of that 4 per cent, and
It is , not , worth tha while of the Protestant
Episcopal church to legislate for them.
The objection to using the record as evi
dence has been called an attack upon the
courts of the country. I make no such at
tack; it would be Impossible for me or any
member of the bar to make it. I am perfect
ly, willing to admit that, the courts do the beÂ«t
they can. The difficulty about this record.bus
iness Is .that the church Is endeavoring to
upÂ© the record of a court for a p'urpose for
which the â¢ record is never intended. ~The ob
ject of the record in a divorce for the cause
of adultery Is to prove the adultery, and It Is
conclusive on that point. Â»But In this matter
you are proposing to use the record whtch has
established the guilt of A in order to prove the
innocence of â¢ B, and the ' two ' things are not
similar, | and I one " does not â¢ necessarily provÂ«
the other. \u25a0 You are using a record established
for one purpose in order to prove another) fact.
VThe difficulty with this amendment is tr-jt in
the first place it seems to apply only to : the
State of New York, and I am opposed to spe
cial legislation. I do not .think that In any
other State ; you could get those things Into
tho decree of a courts Secondly, because, , if
you are trying: to helo out the innocent party
you are not' helping him by that amendment.
It - Is . a kind of a : gold brick amendment : ' It
does* not do what It Is .'Intended to do. You
mierht. just as well pass a resolution of sym
pathy v with all, the Innocent parties through
out the \ country except In the \ State of New-
York. If. you pass that : amendment, you won't
be ; able to marry anybody at all. Therefore,
excent for the reason . that I don't want to
legislate for the Sta.te of New York alone, and
that I don't want to put the church In a false
position .. before ; the country with :. reference to
an amendment which â¢ can't b<* carried ' out. I
for one.-would.be perfectly wllllnsr to vote for
it. because It is absolutely, Innocuous except In

Dr. Fulton interrupted to say that the
speaker was absolutely misrepresenting
what he said on the floor, and the Rev.
Dr. Mann interrupted demanding to what
point the gentleman was speaking, and
saying that there was nothing in this
section of the canon about remarriage.
The speaker resumed:
I claim that the advocates of this measure
must brins: forth grounds clearer than those
yet offered. I will make this contention, that
the Christian church must found her legisla
tion either on revelation or on right reason
and conscience. I say to the laymen here,
"Don't you take your Interpretation of revela
tion from lawyers, but listen to us clergy,"
end I say to the clergy here, "Don't you takp
your Internretation of natural â¢ law from us
clergy, but listen to the distinguished judge who
sits upon questions of ethics." I would like to
ask some high churchman or broad churchman,
who claims he is the supreme representative of
Atanasian theology, to explain how It Is that
they are found on the side of and standing by
the words of they who are trying to represent
the highest conception of his personality and
wish to retire him .in the background upon
expediencyâ the tyrant's plea. I ask them that
question. .
VIEWS OF LONG ISLAND DEPUTY
Deputy Minders of Long Island opposed
prohibition of remarriage of divorced per
sons, saying:
This canon is an absolute prohibition, of the
remarriage of a divorced person by. this church
and under the doctrine and discipline of this
church. If passed, it will disfranchise every
Euch remarried person, whether . such party
was Involved In the original divorce or not.
It will disfranchise them from the rights of
baptism, confirmation and holy communion.
(Cries of No, No). It will under tha canons
as they stand. None of those services can
be administered by a presbyter of this church
If the fact exists that the purty who is apply
ing for those services is a party to a remar
riage, or a divorced person. An appeal will
He to the godly judgment of the Bishop, but
that judgment must' be rendered upon the facts,
and the only fact for consideration will be
whether or not there has been a divorce for
any cause whatsoever. There are other meas
ures cut forward here before us for the dis
cipline of the laity, so called; measures that
have been put forward in contemplation of
the situation which will exist under the pres
ent canon. One comes to us from the House
of Bishops in which power Is given in a meas
ure to the Bishop to grant dispensation: an
other Is that of discipline of. tha laity. 1 These
measures will never be adopted by this con
vention in the short time that remains to us,
and we shall adjourn, leaving the new canon
to stand with the present canon of discipline.
I am heartily in accord with the spirit of Dr.
Huntlngton' s amendment. .There are greater
reasons for supporting his amendment than
those which I have adduced. ' There Is the
ragular standing policy \u25a0 of the church, which
has stood for years, and under which the
church has gained converts and adherents; â¢ *A
church, of all bodies In the world, should be
conservative, and a change of nrinciple, I pro
cedure or doctrine should not be undertaken
unless the necessity plainly exists. Does It
exist here? Have we heard- any reason? No;
no reason that is a reason. If we adopt this
these i>eo:)le will be married elsewhere. We
are In advance of any other sect, denomina
tion or religious body. We are In advance of
the civilization of the world. A canon in the
terms .proposed la not the way to address the
world on this great subject of divorce. : .

assure the synod of their sense of thÂ» neces
sity that the church In Mexico should have,
at the earliest possible day. Its own episco
pate.
The Bishops are not prepared at once to
grant the request to give the Episcopal order
to the three Bishops-elect and feel that cer
tain conditions must be complied -with before
any Bishop can be \u25a0 consecrated for Mexico. -~
Firstâ There must be definite assurances of
the adoption of the form for tbe ordination and
consecration of Bishops and for the ordination
of deacons and priests, confirmed In all the
essential features of the ordinal of this church,
and that the ordinal of thla church shall be
used until the form of ordination la adopted by
the Mexican church.
Secondâ There must be such evidences as this
church always requires before tho consecration
of a Bishop in the United States of the quali
fication In character and learning of the per
sons proposed to be consecrated.
Third â There must bÂ» on tha part of those
to be consecrated, and those who ask their
consecration, an acceptance of article 4 of
the covenant, which is in the nature of a
promise of conformity required of every per
son before ordination and consecration in this
church.
Kourth â There must be some arrangement of
jurisdiction by which the Bishop, when con
secrated, shall have definite charge of separate
dioceses or missionary districts in the Mexican
church.
Fifth â That a covenant be entered Into be
tween the Bishops of thla church and the
church of Mexico in the same or similar terms
and essentially in form as that made before
the Bishop was conscerated for Brazil. Namely,
that the person consecrated shall before hta
consecration bind himself to the prestdln.se
Bishop, to be amenable to the constitution and
canons of the Protestant Episcopal church of
the United States, both as to Its personal
conduct and to the Episcopal government of
the territory under his charge until there shall
be three Bishops consecrated by thl3 House of
Bishops resident and exercising their Jurisdic
tion In Mexico and by their joint action a na
tional church shall have organized.
The following . resolution was then
adopted:
Resolved, That a commission of fchree Bishops
be appointed, who, having satisfied themselves
that the above conditions are complied with,
may request the^presldlng Bishop to call a
meeting of the House of Bishops to consider
and decide the question of c6nsecratlng not
more than two Bishops for the Mexican church.

Captured Anarchist Commits Suicide.
LONDON, Oct. 14.â "Romas, the leader
of a notorious band of anarchists who
ha.ve destroyed various : public and other
buildings during the last few months,"
Bays a dispatch to the Daily Mall from
Kracow, "was arrested in Stanislavow,
Eastern Galicia, after a severe struggle,
in which he and a gendarme were wound
ed and a child was accidentally killed.
Romas hanged himself in the guard
house."
ly .'nexplicable quelling of the riot, a
crowd of people each doing his little mys
terious turn without any connection with
his neighbor. There is one short scene
that is prettty and effective, between
Lady Babbie and the English captain,
Halliwell, but beyond that confusion
reigns supreme..
Miss Laura Nelson Hall is the star of
the cast, as Lady Babbie. She more than
confirms in the role the favorable impres
sion that she has already made, showing
marked talent in her work, and is a win
some, arch and lovable "Egyptian."
5f Miss Hall's enunciation \u25a0were on a
level -with her intelligence, there would
be considerable hope for her, but at times
she is utterly unintelligible, even to those
seated only a few rows from the stage.
Neither is this only when the pretty
ectress- affects the Scotch that is not Of
this earth that is spoken down at the
Grand Opera-house, but in what should
be good, round English. It should not
be necessary to renjlnd Miss Hall that
one must first hear to enjoy what she
says, but with the exception of Mr.,. May
all every member of the company is de
ficient in this regard.
Mr. Mayall has the title role of "The
Little Minister." but a prodigiously
wrong conception of the character. All
the quaint simplicity and unworldliness of
the Auld Licht minister is. lost, his sturdy
belief in himself and. reverence for Auld
Licht ways, and instead Mr. Mayall gives
us a knowing, flippant, smart, young per
son who discounts utterly Lady Babbie's
conversion to reverence, and it al
together out of key. William Bernard is
well suited as Captain HallVwell, and
dees a bit of very good acting with Lady
Babbie in the prison s-cene. Charles
Smiley also stands out as Sheriff Rlach.
Miss Maynard as the tearful Nannie

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Oct. 14.â Rear â¢ Ad
miral Charles O'Neil. chief of naval ord
nance, has taken measures to prevent
further explosions of steel armor piercing
shells in thÂ« 13-inch guns of battleships.
One sun, that of the Kearsarge, was so
seriously damaged by the explosion of a
shell that it was necessary to remove it
and substitute another gun. The Ken
tucky reported that a shell exploded in
one of her 13-inch guns, but fortunately
the damage was slight.
Rear Admiral O'Neil has received a re
port from Captain Willard Bronson, com
manding the Alabama, regarding an acci
dent to her 13-Inch gun, and he has stated
that the gun, while slightly gouged, will
still be serviceable.
Immediately after the accident on the
Kearsarge was reported to the Navy De
partment Rear Admiral O'Neil began an
investigation. This determined that the
shell was manufactured by the Midvale
Steel Company. A letter was addressed
to the company, calling attention to th*
premature explosion, but the company
was unable to furnish any explanation,
pointing out that the lot from which the
shell had been selected was accepted aft
er the usual teats. '-*\u25a0â¢/Â» \u25a0'
In order to prevent further accident-*
Rear Admiral O'Neil has directed that all
semi-armor piercing shells under manu
facture shall be made with thicker walls
and with a gaa check. JRather than have
another prejnature explosion he will prob
ably request the department to order that
these piercing shells be used without pow
der charges in target practice.

aging professional bicycle contests during
the summer. He â¢will now take a hand in
the big Jeffries-Ruhlin match, which is
scheduled for the middle of November be
fore his club. Regarding the match Ken
nedy said:
I almost wish I had remained here during the
summer. There isn't much in the cycling game
and the awful heat of New York is something
to avoid if you can get away from it.
?\u25a0>> far as fights are concerned, there is noth
ing rery new except that Fitzsimmons is really
anxious to go into the ringr again. It looks as
if there would be a match with the old cham
pion and the winner of the Jeffries-Ruhlin
fight.
JIM KENNEDY, the matchmaker
of the Twentieth Century /Athletic
Club and general sport promoter,
returned yesterday morning, from
"Of course, the offer, in line with my
previous studies and the plans for my fu
ture, was about the greatest piece of good
luck that could come to me, and I could
r.ot do otherwise than take advantage of
it. I thought then that I wanted to go on
The stage, but I am not so sure of it
now," she adde3, smiling over at her hus
band.
"I guess you won't go on the stage for
a little time yet," said Mr. Culver.
After Mrs. Carter left Kellogg in Sep
tember Culver pressed his suit. Miss Gil
bert's parents opposed the match and an
elopement followed. The couple got up at
5 o'clock one morning, took the stage for
Wallace and were married. Foregiveness
by the parents followed.
BPOKANE, Oct. 14.â A romance of a lit
tle mining camp, in which Mrs. Leslie
Carter, the actress, played a prominent
part, has been brought to light by the
arrival in Spokane of L. F. Culver and
his bride. Culver is a cousin of Mrs. Car
ter. He became enamored of the golden
haired little woman who is now Mrs. Cul
ver \u25a0when the two formed paxt of a merry
party in a miner's cabin, where Mrs Car
ter would rehearsa scenes from "Zaza"
and "The Heart cf Maryland." She was
assisted by the young woman, who had
ttage ambitions.
Mrs. Carter, in search of rest and
mountain air, went to Kellogg, Idaho in
the summer. She had relatives in the
mining camp, but to avoid publicity she
used the name "Mrs. Madden." She In
vited Culver, who Is a wealthy young man
of St. Louis, to visit her.
Janette Gilbert soon became acquainted
with Mrs. Carter, and the two were
friends when Culver came. Miss Gilbert
fays she has studied for the stage In San
Francisco. The supposed Mrs. Madden
revealed her identity to .Miss Gilbert,
though few people in the camp guessed
who she was. In an interview to-day
ilrs. Culver said:
"We had a jolly summer. The best fun
we had was during the time we camped
In an old log cabin over on the gulch.
There were eight of us, and we spent the
days in angling or in a search for grouse
and pheasant. In the evenings, gathered
around the eampfire of our cabin home,
we listened to Ftories. It was then that
Mrs. Carter took the floor. She would en
tertain us with choice lines from 'Zaza.'
and once in a while would give us a rem
iniscent bit from "The. Heart of Mary
land.' Sometimes I would do my poor lit
tie In the entertaining line. Mrs. Carter
was kind enough to praise my w T ork, and
even went so far as to offer me a position
as her understudv.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, - Oct. 14.-
Paul Tarpey, left half on the 1505 football
eleven, was elected captain", of the team
by; the members of the .freshmen football
squad to-night. The election was quite
spirited, there being > three candidatesâ
Tarpey, Right Half Bartell and Fullback
Dole â in the field. ' Dole : withdrew after
the first ballot and Tarpey was elected
over Bartell by a vote of 11 to 9.
Tarpey, who will lead the youngsters In
their, fight against .the California fresh
men- next 'Saturday, 1 is a natural football
player, with considerable experience on
the gridiron. He played three; years on
the Salt Lake City High School team be
fore coming to - California .and last year
captained the eleven of . the Palo Alto
High. The new captain is 13 years of age
and a brilliant football player.
To-morrow the fresnnien team will play
its last, practice game prior ' to meeting
the University of California freshmen.' It
will meet the. St. Matthew's School eleven
on the campus gridiron. The St. Mat
thew's team was beaten, by the Lowell
High' School eleven last week by a scor3
of 19 to 0, so the game should yield an
easy victory to- the 1905 te'am.
Wilbur, who has been putting up a star
game at right end on. the freshmen eleven,
will not, be allowed. to play in the inter
collegiate game next Saturday because
through an oversight his name was omit

has refused the request that he be al

will take place this evening in , the Me
chanics' Pavilion. Both men are reported
in the very best shape and right ready to
step into the ring. The betting favors
Walcott, who Is on the long, end of 10-7
odds. Not much , betting has been done,
the Barbadoes man receiving the choice
on account of his performance with Gard
ner. :
A torrid battle is anticipated by the
Judges of form. Both men> are of the
heavy hitting, slam-bang, kind and all pre
judgments look to a knockout. The fa
.vorlte players figure on Walcott -for this
very reason, as they say that Carter is
not as cautious or as clever as Gardner,
whose fine defensive work saved him, in
the match a month ago. _ ;
The preliminaries will bring together
some clever second raters and the even

Vast Interests to Battle

ASTORTA, Or., Oct. 14.â It Is reliably
reported here"*that the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company recently offered A. B.
Hammond $3,500,000 for the Astoria and
Columbia River Railroad. The offer is
said to have been declined, though the
impression prevails that Mr. Hammond is
still considering it.
Along with the story of the reputed of
fer comes a statement to the effect that
thy West will soon-witnesa-a clash- of rail
road interests the like of which has never
before been seen- in this country. The
-contending hosts will be the Hill-Morgan
interests and the Harriman-Vanderbilt
combination. On the one side are said to
be arrayed the Southern Pacific, the Un
ion .Pacific and the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company, while on the other
are the Northern Pacific, the Great
Northern and the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy. It is snid that the Northern Pa
cific is now building into the Oregon Rail
road and Navigation's wheat territory in
the Ncrthwest, while the Burlington is
building into Union Pacific territory, with
an outlet in Los Angeles.
ESCAPE STARVATION
BY EATING THEIR DOG
Miners Lost"' in Alaska Live Upon
the Flesh, of a Faithful
/ Canine.
TACOMA, Oct. 14.â Another story of the
saving of human life by eating dog flesh
conies from Alaska. Passengers from Val
des say that five miners en route from
Chestoehena district to Valdes lost their
entire supply of provisions while crossing
Copper River, several hundred miles
above the coast. They were left without
anything to eat in a wilderness, which of
fered nothing for subsistence. They wan
dered onward several days, hoping to
come upon other miners having plenty of
provisions. . \u25a0
Failing i in this they finally killed and
devoured "Ginger," a dog owned by one
of the party. The dog had been of great
service, having assisted in hauling Benja
min Fisher, one of their number, who had
been disabled from a gunshot wound In
flicted by an Indian. Besides Fisher the
party consisted of J. A. Jacobson, Albert
Downing, Henry Thompson and Charles
Schlosser.

SALINAS, Oct. 14.â Reports from the
scenes of the forest fires hereabouts were
more encouraging to-night. That In San
Miguel Canyon, near Prunedale, is under
control and probably will be extinguished
in the next twelve hours. The fire in the
neighborhood of Chualar and Gonzales,
though still burning, will be subdued
soon. The blaze near Pacific Grove has
been checked before consuming the fa
mous cypress grove, but has crossed the
drive and county road and is burning be

Pescadero beach, where there is heavy
timber land.

feet she picked up a cuspidor and threw
it with all her strength at Rankin. It

A few of the safes were opened tc-day,
but most of them were too hot to permit
handling. Water was turned on the vault
of the Commercial Bank and an effort
will be made to open it to-morrow. So
far as the safes have been opened it was
found that the valuables had escaped in
jury.
Active work has already commenced in
clearing away the debris where it Is cold.
One temporary structure is being built
and the merchants are renting such quar
ters as can be found. Several resumed
business to-day.
LOS GATOS, Oct. 14.-The people of Los
Gatos have set about to rebuild the city
and so far as could be learned to-day it
seems that all whose buildings were
burned will erect. -new- and * substantial
structures. The Commercial Bank people
announce that they will at once construct
a commodious and onramental . . brick
structure to take the place of their former
building. They will commence work a3
soon as the architect, can get ready and
let the contract-
John Lyndon lost fourteen building's.
He will commence rebuilding as soon as
contracts can be let. He will put .up
brick buildings. W. B. Rankin and a
number of others will rebuild at once.
A conference of the property owners has
been held and they determined to build
from four to six feet further back from
the curb, thus giving wider sidewalks.
This will be a great improvement.
The adjusters were in the city to-day
arranging to settle the losses. It is now
said that there is only $55,000 insurance.
Some of the property destroyed was not
protected to the extent of a dollar.

The question "Is a man who was born
to American parents in a foreign coun
try while the father was either a United
States Minister or Consul or while the
parents, citizens of the United. States,
were traveling In a foreign country, eligi
ble to the Presidency of the United
States?" Is one that has been frequently
asked, but It cannot be answered with
certainty and will not be unless the Su
preme Court shall pass on the matter.
The constitution declares that "no person
except a natural-born citizen" shall tie)
eligible to the Presidency. Children born
to American parents while traveling
abroad or are in the service of the United
States in a foreign country are recognized
as citizens of the United States, but there
never has been a decision to settle the
question, "Are such children 'natural
born?' " Until the highest court in the
land passes upon that tLe question win
remain unanswered.
The following communication is of gen
eral interest to attorneys: .
To the Editor of The Call: Referring
to the recent decision of our Supreme
Court against the constitutionality of the
Code of Civil Procedure, one of the San
Francisco dallies (not The Call) says the
lawyers can now throw their new codes
out of the window. The lawyers are not
likely to do that. They are by this time
able to tell at a glance which sections are
in force, and the fact that the new codes
are properly annotated with notes of all
the decisions of the Supreme Court and
of the courts of other States having sim
ilar code ' provisions ' renders the new
codes invaluable to lawyers' and almost
indispensable to State, city and county

CHOIR AND QUIREâ Anxious, City.
Choir Is the term to designate a company
of singers composed of four choruses
trebles, altos, tenors and bassesâ but of
late years It is applied to any body of
singers. The name choir is a corrupt
Spelling of quire which came in vogue in
the sixteenth century, in Imperfect Imi
tation-of the French word, "Choeur,"'or
the original Latin "choruse." Purches,
who lived 1577-1626, in his "Pllgrimes" has:
"They rise at midnight to pray unto their
idols, which they doe in Quires, as the
Faries do." Milton, in "Paradise Re^
gained," has: "Angellck quires sung
heavenly anthems of victory." Tennyson
uses "quire" instead of choir in "Love
and Duty." '
Three rival British railroad routes from
London to Scotland are now striving for
the record between the English and
Scotch capitals, says Black and White.
The distances average 400 miles, and it ia
hoped before the season ends to cover the
trip in 420 minutes. The three routes are
the East Coast, by way of the Great
Northern, Northeastern and North British
roads; the Midland, over the railroad of
that name, and the West Coast, over tha
London and Northwestern and Caledonian
lines. The best records yet made are:
East. Coast, 393% miles, eight hours six
minutes. Midland, 408 miles, eight hours
forty-four minutes; West Coast. 400 miles,
seven hours flfty-eight minutes. In the
races of 1888 the East Coast won after Â»
spirited struggle. In 1895 the West Coast
won. The time had been cut from ten
hours to eight and a hair hours. This year
the Midland has entered the competition
and before the summer is ended it is ex
pected that one of the three roads will
have cut the time to the seven hour limit

THE special industries of which Great Britain
once enjoyed a practical monopoly have so far
declined and in many cases have so completely
disappeared that English observers are driven to. a
search for the cause.
Benjamin Taylor, of the Glasgow Herald, has re
cently published his conclusions as to the cause,
which he finds in the policy of trade unions. Mr.
Taylor sa3*s: "In theory the trade union is an or
ganization for the protection of labor against, the
tyranny and oppression of capital. In practice the
British trade union is an organization for the re
straint of labor and the manacling of capital. . . .
The modern trade union is a combination for the
sole purpose of furthering the supposed interests of
the workmen, without regard to the interests of the
trade or craft as a whole. In the old system there
was the element of solidarity in the relations between
capital and labor. In the new system there is the
element ci antagonism. In the old system the crafts
man prospered according to his skill' and industry.
In the new system skill and industry are reduced to
one common denominator, called the trade union rate
of wage. If American manufacturers are enabled to
undersell their British rivals in some of their pet in
dustries, it is not because the American workman is
a better craftsman than the British â he is, indeed,
often imported from Britain â but because he is an
unfettered producer. That is to say, American labo
is more productive than British."
He declares that the trade union theory that if the
work of the world is spread out thin there will be
just enough to go round is a fallacy, and says that
if England finally falls utterly in the industrial race
it will not be because her workmen cannot create as
well as others, but because they will not. A Ger
man or American workman will give equal and sim
ultaneous attention to three, four or six machines or
tools, while his trade union compels the British
workman to confine himself. to one. in order that
employment may be given to half a dozen men who
cught to be busy elsewhere.
Citing specific instances, he says: "It was, for ex
ample, the exactions and limitations demanded by
the union ship builders of the Thames that drove
the great shipbuilding industry from London to the
northern rivers, where it has flourished, while the
Thames has left only enc shipyard of any importance.
The like exactions and limitations of the trade unions
drove lace making from Nottingham, and the flint
glass and bottle manufacture to Germany and Bel
gium. Flint glass used to be a very large and lucra
tive business in Great Britain, affording highly paid
employment to thousands of workers who had their
trade union. That union waxed fat and kicked on
the subject of apprentices. It succeeded in enforcing
strict limitations on the number of boys who might
he apprenticed in any one year in any one factory.
Then they put the screw on wages, until they raised
the pay of an ordinary journeyman to three pounds
ten shillings and four pounds per week. Their mo
nopoly of labor was complete. The Germans stepped
in and took the trade, bodily from under the nose
of the glass trade union, which does not now in the
whole United Kingdom contain as many members as
there are workers in a single German factory. The
industry is gone, except two or three high class con
cerns making costly tableware for the wealthy."
It will be seen that it is not- so much a question of
-.vages as the limiting of production that has ban
ished many industries from Great Britain and sent
them to take root profitably on the Continent or in
the United States. If Mr. Taylor is right in his con
clusions they carry a lesson . for producers every
where. Free labor and free, capital seem to be the
best and happiest partners in industrial production.

LOST PILOT-BOATâ E. J. C. About
forty years ago the pilot-boat Julia, in
charge of two men, went outside the
heads. One, of these, a pilot, was taken
in .i small boat to an incoming vessel and
while this was being done the pilot-boat
was without any one on board. When the
one who took the pilot to the ship started
to return to the pilot-boat he discovered
that she had disappeared. She was never
found or heard of after that.
WITHIN a time comparatively short there
have come two announcements from Ber
..,. lin which have been taken by the world as
evidence 'of the existence of a plan on the part of the
Germans to build up a colonial empire of great ex
tent. One of these was the statement that a consid
erable portion of the German troops now in China
will not be withdrawn but will be kept in that part
of the worJd. The second was the large appropriation
made by the State Department for maintaining 125
German schools in Argentina, Southern Brazil, Tnr-.
key, China and South Africa.
In each of these programmes there is plainly a
means of advancing a policy of colonial expansion,
whether deliberately designed for that purpose or
not. A detachment of German troops permanently
established in China would easily lead to the need
of German territory on which to maintain them. The
school programme is more subtle. A large number
of Germans have settled in Argentina and Brazil. In
the natural order of things % their descendants would
acquire the prevailing language of the country and
become essentially, South Americans. By furnishing
them,, however, with German schools, the Kaiser
provides a. ineans of retaining, their descendants as
Germans, and consequently should the Brazilian Gov
ernment go to pieces at any time or even become
involved in sectional wars,' there would be a strong
German element ready to set itself up as an inde
pendent state. \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0..-'â¢
It is asserted by some authorities that the German
Government is working for just such an object in
Brazil and Argentina. One of these says: "Germany
calmly sets herself to take over all places where the
life tenancies of the dying nations are running out.
She thinks she sees such places in South America, in
I Asia Minor and in the Far East, and there she plants
her schools. There she hopes in future to direct her
surplus population, for which purpose other legisla
tion has been enacted. There by every sort tof public
and private effort she j strives to develop her com
merce, and there, when dissolution comes of the sick
men of Europe, of Asia or of America, she hopes to
have her sons ready .to 'take possession/' .,.
One enthusiastic admirer of the candidate says:
''All that can be said of Josiah Quincy is that he is a
capital Democrat. He is the kind of Democrat that
I like. He is progressive and he believes in some
phases of socialism." The description fairly fits the
man. Mr. Quincy has himself characterized his polit
ical philosophy as "opportunism." He believes in tak
ing up any issue upon which he thinks he can get
votes. He is making his present race for Governor
strictly upon State issues, and in his platform are
several planks that show tendencies to socialism.
Neither he nor his friends expect him to be elected
this year, but they hope he will receive a vote so
large that his renomination at the next election will
be assured, and then they look for victory.
It is therefore quite within the limits of probability
that the Massachusetts Democrats are grooming a
candidate for the Presidential race. It will be re
membered that in discussing the sort of candidate the
Democratic party should nominate in 1904, the gifted
Mr. Dooley said there is wanted: "A good, active,
inergetic, Dimmycrat, sthrong iv lung an' limb; must
be in favor Iv sound money, but not too sound, an
anti-impeeryalist, but f'r holdin' onto what we've got,
an' inimy iv thrusts, but a frind iv organized capital,
a' sympathizer with th' crushed an' downthrodden
people, but not be anny means hostile to vested in
therests; must advocate sthrikes, gover'mint by .in
junction, free silver, sound money, greenbacks, a sin
gle tax, a tariff f'r rivinoo, th' constitootion to follow
th' flag as far as it can go, an' no farther, civil ser
vice rayform iv th' la'ads in office an' all th' gr-reat
an 1 gloryous principles in our gr-reat an' gloryous
party or anny\ gr-reat an' gloryous parts thereof."
Josiah Quincy does not exactly fill all the specifi
cations of Mr. Dooley, but he comes very near it.
He is a gold Democrat who voted for Bryan, and a
conservative who is willing to move in the direction
of socialism. He appears to be sound of lung and
limb. He has a historic name, but has ( not lived. up
to it enough to make enemies. It is a far cry from
Nebraska to Massachusetts, but Democracy may
have to go that far in search of a candidate, for there
seems to be none at any intermediate point.
MASSACHUSETTS Democracy rarely has an
opportunity to be heard by the nation at
large. Just now, however, it appears to'have
the floor. It is true there are campaigns, going along
in other States, but they do not make much noise. In
the person of Josiah Quincy, however, the Democrats
of Massacuhsetts have a candidate of whom they are
proud enough jto brag, and ever since his nomination
they have been blowing trumpets loud enough to fill
the. land with his fame.

The discredit of it will fall upon the party and will give it a long exile from power.
It is a hard condition when the shortest way to power for the Republican party lie? in
beating a ticket called Republican, but that is the condition that has beeii created here by
the combination of greed and ignorance that usurped control of affairs. -lAn opportunity
is lost and will not soon occur again.
The few names on the ticket that may command respect make too light a float for
the heavy sinker, and the result is shown in the languid interest felt by the people in the
fate of the nominees. ,
San Francisco is now believed to be standing at a crisis in the commercial history
of her people. The uppermost thought is, will she stand still, or go forward, or retreat?
That the city will go forward is likely, but the pace at which she advances was capable of
acceleration by a strong and upright city government which the Republican party was
capable of giving her. Tn the government. of this city there should be neither rascals nor
dreamers. Neither robbery nor reverie should appear in our public administration. Fa
naticism and the raw aspirations of a single and self-constituted class should hot be per
mitted in our local government. We need business men, with a high sense of public
duty and a stake in the public welfare, to manage municipal affairs, maintain .order and
give impulse to the progress which it is possible for San Francisco to make. . \\ j ,
The Call had no persons to advance and none to pull down. We wrought for a
Republican result that would honor the party and benefit the city. But that result was not
attained. The party is not honored by the ticket that flies its name, and the city i? not to
be benefited by the success of that ticket, nQtwithstanding the few. good names, upon it
for positions that.can in no way control the policies that are vital to ;the interests of the
people. The self-elected dictators yho : made the ticke^ must be held :responsibler'and the
great body of the party washes its ;Iiands of: the 'situation, which it did not create and for
which it refuses to be responsible. $\($ -
This could have been done had not the party organization fallen into a control
that forbade its appearance as a body of self-respecting partisans, proud of their party and
of its free hand and independent capacity. This control treated the party as a tool in the
hands of a limited few who had axes to grind or grindstcces to let for the grinding of axes,
and the Republican party was treated as worthy of no" more dignified place than to serve in
turning the grindstone, not even being permitted to hold the ax. The ticket nominated
is pitifully weak, and in some places worse than weak. There are but few strong, re
deeming personalties on it, to lift it above the dead level of a hopeless mediocrity and hold
out a hope that it will redeem any high expectation that may be invested in it. The inter
ests of the party, its good name, its reputation and the claim it makes of representing the
best order of citizenship were no more considered by the persons who had usurped the
organization than a cannibal considers the knowledge of the catechism possessed by the
missionary whose kidneys he is eating, brochette. .
An opportunity has been lost, no matter if the ticket win. It is not a Republican
ticket, for it represents private interests and not a public purpose, but it assumes the Re
publican name, and its maladministration, its weakness, and perhaps wickedness, will be
charged to the party, thus putting still further away an opportunity to prove that it can
faultlessly administer the government of this city. . i ' ','
IT is' pitiful that the Republican organization in this city, did not see and improve its
opportunity, when its ticket was nominated.. The time had come for the actual Repub
lican majority of San Francisco to assert itself and take its rightful control of the city
government.. ThcUack of executive energy in the administration we have been hav
ing, and the mighty distance between the people and the controlling* influence that it put
in charge of the administrative boards created by the charter, had quite alienated from it
the sympathy of the people and they were ripe.for a change, but it must be for the better
and not for the worse. Every condition was ready for a Republican victory, but it must
be the*triumph of the party as a political force, original and in the first person. It must be
a victory won to demonstrate that the Republican party has in it the material for effect
ing" good government; protecting, the taxpayers, keeping faith with public -creditors,- and
wisely administering the trust committed to it. Republicans hang their heads when it is
assumed that their party cannot do this, and they hoped that the time had come when
the aspersive implication could be wiped out. ,

In Jumping to get clear of the stage
three of the passengers leaped clear ovtr
the edge of the precipice., Murphy and

had brought up on a ledge forty lect be-
A dozen persons, including the Judge
and lawyers and Jail officials in a Chinesa
murder trial held at Clinton, were on the
stage and were hurrying down to the
coast. Those on board were: R. L. Reid,
Dennis Murphy, A. D. Mclntyre, George
A. Stewart Potts, Deputy Warden Hutch
lrson of the Kamloops Jail,- Mark Eccle
stene, W. Creelman, A. R. Cameron,
Geoige Lewis and C. Spriggs. The pas
sengers who rode inside were Messrs.
Potta, Hutchinson, Cameron and Lewis.
All went well until they were within a
half mile of the Twenty-Mile House. The
stage was then rounding one of the steep
precipices which abound along that por
tion of the road, when one of the horses
became unmanageable and, after several
plunges, fell, carrying the others with it.
The stage was upset and the king pin
came out of the truck under the front
wheels, detaching it from the rest of the
coach. The horses in their struggles to
regain their feet fell from the adjacent
precipice, taking with -them the front
wheels and the pole of the stage.
As the coach capsized the passengers all
made a wild scramble for safety and those
outside Jumped for the hillside. All wen?
badly shaken up and bruised and three
were seriously injured. They were: R. L.
Reid, hurt^lnternally; George A.' Stewart
Potts, leg bruised,, and A. D. Mclntyre,
face cut. Of thess Reid was the most se
riously injured, being pinned under the
overturned stage for some time before tha
others were able to coine to his assist
ance.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 14.âPassen

of the "cussedness" of a horse. The en
tire load went over a precipice, the stage
bringing upon a ledge forty feet below,
while several of the passengers rolled and
tumbled down the mountainside 100 feat
farther. Three of the unfortunate travel
ers were badly injured.

OMAHA. Neb.. Oct. 14.â By giving Mius
Marie Fisher the title "My wife" in a
casual introduction Jacob E. Byers of
South Omaha lost for hl3 heirs $10,000 in
money and property valued at $15,000 more.
Byers; a prominent livestock dealer, died
a month ago and interested parties hav<;
Just agreed upon a settlement of the es
tate.
Miss Fisher advanced the claim that she
had been married to the stockman at com
mon law, but \u25a0was unable to produce writ
ten evidence of. the union. She produced
James Tillotson, however, whom she had
first met while she was in the company
of Byers. "Tillotson, I wish to present
you to my wife." Byers had remarked.
The girl cherished the acknowledgment
as the only outward sign of their matri
monial relationship.
The young woman also offered testi
mony to ehow that she had resided in a
brownstone house on Park avenue with
the broker and had been known in the
neighborhood as his wife. She was ac
customed to appear with him at church
and at places of amusement.
The contest was brought by N. W. By
ers of Aledo, 111., brother of the decedent,
who has now recognized the young wife's
claim. The latter has withdrawn the plea
that she be appointed administratrix of
her husband's estate and has taken a lib
eral settlement instead. The estate will
grant her $10,000. diamonds given her by
Byers and a deed to the brownstone front.
About an enual amount in money and
property has been left for the Illinois rel
atives.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Congress will
have to determine for itself the charac
teristics of the projected battleships. Con
sideration of the act directing him to pre
pare plans for the proposed "ships has
convinced Secretary Long that . Congress
desired to make a choice of the plans. He
will .therefore transmit to that body the
two designs recommended by the major
ity and minority of the board on con
struction and the compromise plan, -which
is practically that of the minority save
that eight-inch guns are substituted for
seven-inch guns. The board held a meet
ing to-day at which several designs were
considered but no progress was made.
The majority will not change the battery
of four twelve-inch and twenty seven-Inch
guns it recommended, notwithstanding
Admiral Dewey's suggestion that sixteen
eight-inch guns be substituted for the
seven-inch guns.
Secretary Long Will Submit the De
signs Recommended by the
I Board of Construction.

"I never believed In any canal not neu
tral," he said. "The Idea of fortifying
such a highway is absurd and the priv
ilege to do so is of no value. The right
to close it in time of war to any nation
seems eaually absurd."
Referring to the attitude of the Senate
on the reciprocity treaties he said he ex
pects some action, but he was not pre
pared to say of what character. Frye
expects there will be - considerable oppo
sition. The administration Is determined
to press the treaties and hopes to secure
their ratification. The fight will be made
on the French treaty. The Argentine
treaty will be considered after the French
treaty is disposed of.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Senator Frye,
president pro tempore of the Senate, said
to-day that he thinks Congress will take
action on the Nicaragua canal during the
next session. He says he cannot see how
any Senator can object to the treaty with
Great Britain now under negotiation.

needed no assistance.
Prominent bankers and business men
say that the rumor -which caused the run
is groundless and that only small
depositors are withdrawing their ac

during the day by business houses,* and
large sums of money were sent to the
Fidelity Company's offices by local banks.
The Erie County Savings Bank voluntar

sent in $100,000. The money was accepted,
but not as a loan. New York drafts were
sent to the two Institutions for the cash.
At the close of business to-day President
Foreman stated that the withdrawals ex
ceeded the deposits by only $50,000.
BUFFALO, Oct. 14.â A run on the Fi

institution, began to-day. A long line of
anxious depositors stood for hours wait

It is no answer to the evil and criminal
nature of this article' to claim that it was
written for the purpose of destroying crowned
heads. . It inculcates and enforces the idea,
that murder is the proper remedy to be ap
plied against rulers. The fact that It was pub
lished fifty years ago and again republished
about fifteen years ago only emphasizes and
gives added point to the criminality of the re
publishing: of it at any time. It shows de
liberate Intent to inculcate and promulgate the
doctrines of the article. This we hold to be
a criminal act. It is not necessary Â£p trace
any connection in this article with the as
sassination of the late President. The offensa
here. In the eyes of the law, la precisely the
same as if the bloody event had never oc
curred. The murder of the President only
serves to illustrate and illuminate the enormity
of the crime of the defendant In leaching his
diabolical doctrine. *
The article in question was entitled
"Murder Against Murder." In his defense
Herr Most claimed that the paper con
taining: the article was printed and ready
for distribution before the President was
shot. Also that it was a quotation from
an article published fifty years ago and
republished by him. After imposing the
sentence Justice HinsdalÂ« read the opin

STATE CONVENTION OF
STOCKRAISERS CALLED
As the vessel struck at about mid-tide,
there was some apprehension in the mind
of her master, Captain Joseph Gosse, that
at dead low water she might slide from
the natural cradle In which she at first
rested, and so fall back into deep water.
On this account all of the passengers
and crew were landed as darkness fell on
Saturday night and campflres were built
on the rocky shore and tents placed in
position. Under these circumstances all
the passengers awaited the falling of the
tide, and it was not till 1:30 o'clock on
Sunday morning that Captain Gosse al
lowed any person to go aboard the ves
sel. As many of the passengers had fal
len asleep in the big tents, before the
grateful warmth of the fires, it was some
time before all could be awakened and
shown to their staterooms. Sunday was
spent in exploring the island upon which
the vessel was cast, and It was not till
this morning at 4 o'clock that relief was
brought by the steamer Maude, the AVil
lapa following shortly afterward.
The Hating was less than 100 yards out
of her course when she struck and was
proceeding at but half speed. She ran on
the rocks about twenty feet and tore
away her entire forefoot for that dis
tance. Water rushed into her forward
bulkheads and even penetrated her for
ward hold, but In very small quantities.
A diver is now on the scene with wreck
ing apparatus and it is likely that the
vessel will be floated by the latter part
of the week. Cement casing will be
placed in her bulkheads and it is then
likely that she will be able to proceed to
this city under her own steam. â¢
No* panic whatever occurred among the
passengers when the vessel struck, but
a Chinese pantry hand I caused no small
amount of terror by appearing on deck
armed with a knife, which he brandished
furiously as he tore up and down* de
manding that he be given a place In one
of the boats. The terror-stricken Chinese
was forcibly quieted.
â¢ Among the passengers were many re
turning Klondlkers from Dawsonand gold
to the amount of $300,000 was brought
down. Every person ''aboard the Hating
was loud iri nraise of the" master of the
vessel, who is well known in these waters
as a skillful and careful navigator.
Sabine Channel, which the vessel .was
entering when she struck, is a passage
about three-quarters of a mile wide at
its narrowest point and it is customary
for skippers to work through^ it in foggy
weather by the direction of the echoes
from the Bteamer's whistle.' \ â¢
Owing to the accident it is not likely
that the Hating will make another trip
till the" spring. She may be sent to San
Francisco for an overhauling. â¢
VANCOUVER, â¢ B. C, Oct. 14.-The
steamers Willapa and Maude, sent as re
liefs to the wrecked steamer Hating, ar
rived here from the scene of the disaster
this afternoon. The Hating is still lying
on an even keel on a rocky point of Jar
via Island, about fifty miles from this
city. Both vessels came down laden
with passengers and baggage, not a per
son being left aboard the stranded vessel
to-night. The total number of passen
gers on the Hating from Skagway was
170.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct 14.â "The Leg
islative History of the General Staff of
the Army of the United States," which
was authorized by Congress to be printed,
is the title of a valuable and Interesting
compilation made, under the direction
of Major General Henry C. Corbin, by
R. P. Thian, the chief clerk in the adju
tant general's office. It embraces all the
resolves of the Continental Congress and
the laws of the United States from 1775 to
1901, affecting the several staff departments
and corps of the army, each chapter being
headed by brief remarks relative to the
establishment of the particular depart
ment of which it treats, and has a com
plete list of the several heads of that
department from the earliest period to the
present date.
While the history Is purely a military
publication it cannot fail to interest the
historical student, as it throws powerful
sidelights on the difficulties under which
the colonies labored when they- deter
mined on armed resistance to British op
pression, and the various means resorted
to by the Continental Congress to arm,
equip," clothe and feed the army; for in
stance the procuration of arms, the in
centives offered for their manufacture and
that of gunpowder, the providing means
of subsistence-, clothing, etc The want
of proper quantities of clothing is forcibly
shown by the fact that General Washing
ton was forced to offer his men an addi
tional ration for each-' coat turned, and
that the possibility of distributing two
shirts per man was an occasion deemed
by him of sufficient Importance to be an
nounced in general orders; again, he of
fered a reward for the ingenuity of the
troops In submitting the best rawhide
substitute for shoes.
The compilation appears to have been
made with great care and good judgment
and Is exhaustively indexed. As a book
of reference It Is entitled to a prominent
place on the shelves of all military li
braries.

A prominent Boston capitalist said to
day: "There cannot be two copper kings
in Boston. Lawson openly states that
certain Amalgamated directors parted
with immense blocks of Amalgamated
just previous to the dividend declaration.
Lawson is not Jiimself a director of the
company, hence he could not have been

bert C. Burrage, Lawson's greatest rival
for the title of the Copper King of the
Hub and Incidentally for the honor of
being the unrivaled dispenser of Juvenile
charity, Is a director of the Amalgamated

the fight to be one to a finish between
Lawsou and. Burrage to Bee which shall
be the greatest man in Boston, there aro
some mighty interesting times ahead."
BOSTON, Oct. 14.â Thomas W. Lawson's
confessed losses of $7,000,000 in the recent
slump in copper was the topic of wide
spread discussion in financial circles here
to-day. That Lawson had been a heavy
loser -was known about the street long be
for his interview was published and there
were ugly rumors as to his financial con
dition floating about all last week. It was
undoubtedly due to these rumors that
Lawson consented to make a public state
ment of what damage he had sustained
by the drop in Amalgamated, and- while
to-day he stands better with the copper
speculating public, he has undoubtedly
hurt himself with the big brokers in giv
ing away the inside of the affair.
The interview printed yesterday has
served the purpose of making ' Lawson
popular with the small speculators and
to-day there were more people watching
the tape in his office than at any time
last week. A. C. Burrage, one of the
Amalgamated directors, is said to be
Lawson's greatest rival.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 14.â The Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe companies are de
termined that there shall not be another
citrus fruit blockade in Southern Califor
nia if they can prevent it, and already
both companies have begun arrangements
for promptly handling this season's crop.
At the headquarters of both companies
the orange cron to be moved is estimated
at 25,000 carloads, quite as large. If not
larger, than last season's crop. To meet
the enormous demand for transportation
facilities the Santa Fe has already begun
the collection of fruit cars, and every
available siding west of Albuquerque is
rapidly filling up with them, where they
will be held until needed. In order to
meet the increased demand for motive
power the Santa J^e some time ago placed
orders for many new locomotives, and as
soon as these are delivered they will be
used in the transportation of oranges.
At the Southern Pacific headquarters it
â¢was also stated that new motive power
as well as cars would be delivered in time
to handle the crop, and that there would
be no blockade, however large tho crop
might be.

Statistics cf the growth of the Japanese
mercantile marine during- the past three
years show very extraordinary figures.
The number of steamers has increased by
200 (100,000 tons), and sailing vessels by
3000 (200,000 tons). It is a growth almost
unprecedented in the shipping history of
the world. The increase is largely due to
the liberal policy of the Government in
granting large bounties for the extension
of foreign services. The total crews num

there. The Japanese, who know the Chi

skeptical upon this point and are filled
with wonder at the ease with which the
allies have been deceived in " this vital
matter. It is, in fact, to any one ac
quainted with the Oriental character im
possible to imagine that a court with so
exaggerated a sense of self-respect as that

Mrs. Doug-las and her daughter Aloha
are- at the Gates Sanitarium. The girl's
condition is critical. Her skull is crushed
and she may die. Mrs. Douglas will re
cover.
But little is known of Douglas here. He
never told any one about himself, and
always seemed to be hiding his past life.
He was possessed of about $7000 when he
came here, which he Invested In securi
ties.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 14.â The tragedy at the
Agnews stock farm yesterday morning,
wnen Charles Douglas killed himself after
attempting the life of his wife, Angellne
Douglas, and his stepdaughter. Aloha Ag
new, is mystifying to the Sheriff's office,
â¢when it comes to theorizing upon the
cause for the husband's acts. Everything
about the crime recalls the Dunham mur
ders in Campbell in 18%. There is no
evidence to show that Douglas was in
sane. In all his dealings around town he
was careful and particular, and many
now believe he planned his crime, as
Dunham had, for a linancial gain for. his
child. That he did not commit murder
was not his fault, and he took his life
only when he was discovered.
Douglas mucn resembled Dunham in
characteristics. He was close mouthed,
held alool irom eyeryoody, and never
spoke of his past life or artairs. Tho tem
peraments or two men were never more
alike.
Very few who knew Douglas believe he
was "lfjsane, but think he planned the
murder deliberately. When he married
Airs. Agnew a lew years ago she was a
widow, with property wortn fully $50,000.
This she did not turn over to her nus
band, but kept it in her own name v It is
known that Douglas had tried on nu
merous occasions to obtain possession of
this nioperty. It had been deeded to Mrs.
Douglas by her former husband, who
made no provision for ,ihe three children,
knowing nis wite would take care of
them. For some months Douglas has
been turning everything that he could
about the Ajnew home into cash. The
place was beautifully situated and in
cluded one of the finest live oak groves
in the county. Douglas had these trees
cut down and sold for wood. On this he
realized a. couple of thousand dollars.
Other things about the place were sold
and the wnole proceeds went into his
pocket.
There i was one child resulting from
EVouglas' marriage, and, as in the case
of the Dunham murders, this was the
only one not assaulted. In the six mur
ders committed by Dunham his child was
the only one left alive in the house and
came into an inheritance of about 560,
000.
Some days ago Douglas hid under a bed
the large horse bone with which he tried
to brain his wife and the rope he used
In the attempt to strangle her. He at
tempted to kill Mrs. Douglas and the
daughter Aloha, and as Irma, the 3-year
old girl, has a badly bruised face, it is
believed he attacked her, and probably
rer-dered her unconscious before he tried
to murder his stepdaughter. "With these
three out of the way his little boy would
have become the heir to his wife's prop
erty, worth at least $50,000. If his mur
derous plans had not been frustrated it
is believed he Intended to flee, or else at
tempt to prove his Innocence,

A WESTERN CATTLE KINO.
Is upon its marvelous power of nourish-
ing all the nerve tissues and purifying
the blood that Its remarkable cure de-
pends.
Weariness, lack of energy and despond-
ency are more a matter of nerves and
brain than of the muscles. At this season
of the year, when thousands of over-
working people are entering upon thÂ«
drudgery that will have no cessation for
nearly a year to come, many are already
showing the symptoms that sooner or
later result from hurry, care, anxiety and
haste without the amount of rest and
recreation that nature- intended.
Thousands cf tired mothers, school
teachers and too ambitious scholars will
reveal the strain before the winter Is
over.
It is high time for all to strlka at the
root of the trouble. Begin the work of re-
cuperation and cure at the earliest mo-
ment.
All who try it will find strength and
freedom from disease In Paine's celery
compound, which corrects unhealthy
nerve action and supplies the veins with
pure, more abundant, more vigorous blood.
Paine's celery compound Is almost uni-
versally prescribed by physiciansâ who
differ on many other things, but who esti-
mate at its proper worth this greatest of
all remedies for the prevention and cure
of disease. It is no exaggeration to say
that every week brings hundreds of let-
ters from thoso who have used Palne'9
celery compound and have been benefited
by it. Above is the picture of Kepre-
sentatlve G. H. Storms, one of the cattle
kings of Kansas, who says: "I regard
Paine's celery compound as the most
beneficial and valuable of remedies, espe-
cially during the fall months." He writes
as have many thousands of others of the.
' good the remedy has done in his own case.
Let the reader try it and prove for himself
the abundant truth of all that has been
said.
It is not what Paine's celery compound
says, but whar it does, that tells the story
of its world-wide fame.
Paine's celery cpmpound corrects un-
healthy nerve action and feeds the nerve
centers with the elements needed to build
them up again into healthy tissues. It
cleanses the blood of every trace of poi-
sonous humor and encourages a rapid
growth of the red corpuscles upon which
the vigor of the entire body depends.
Its action is' perfectly Intelligible to
every able physician.
Diseases of the nervous system do not
come without warning. Rheumatism, dys-
pepsia, insomnia and diseases of the liver
and kidneys are but loud cries for a
prompt increase of nourishment for the
brain and nerve, centers. Paine's celery
compound feeds these vital parts, and it
Nothing else has ever been known to
cure like obstinate cases. When all oth-
ers have failed this marvelous remedy
for blood and nerves has made sick peo-
ple well.
A medical Journal, says a writer In tho
Eoston Traveler, has the names and ad-
dresses and full histories of hundreds of
cases of chronic and acute rheumatism
that have been permanently cured by the
wonderful remedy which has recently
been attracting wide attention since Gov-
ernor Tates of Illinois publicly endorsed
it.

Michael Powers, Foreman of Labor
ers, Has His Thigh. Fractured
by railing^ Iron Weight.
Michael Powers, foreman of the labor
ers at the Union Iron Works, while
working in the foundry yesterday was so
severely injured by a huge piece of fail
ing iron that he died at 7:30 last night.
At the time of the accident Powers was
superintending the bending of iron plates.
In the bending process a 2000-pound
\u25a0weight is used. This huge weight was
raised to a height of twelve feet above
the ground, and at this elevated position
it was accidentally struck by a traveling
crane. The heavy weight fel.l and struck
Powers on the right thigh near the hip,
lracturing the bone in several places.
Powers was removed at once to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where the injured mem
ber was amputated by Drs. Bunnell,
Murphy and Von der Leith. The opera
tion, however, proved of no avail, as the
system had received too severe a shocTt.
Powers was a native of Waterford,
Ireland. He had been a trusted employe
of the Union Iron Works for a number
of years. He leaves a widow and three
children residing at 702 Tennessee street.

The Michail was formerly the British
steamer Clan Grant, and was built in 1S83
by A. Stephens & Sons, Limited. She is
about the same size as the America Maru
and is owned by the Pacific Steam Whal

unusual kind of stowaway. He is Cap
tain V. M. Jacubowsky of the Russian
steamer Michail. He was master of the
vessel up to a few weeks ago. but got
Into trouble at Colombo, Ceylon. His
steamer is divided into watertight com
partments, and through a misunderstand
ing of an order from the captain one of
the officers let the water run into one of
the compartments, which contained valu
able freight. Quite a bit of damage was
done, and when the vessel reached port
explanations were asked for, and In an
effort to shield the officer the captain got
into hot water. He practically took all
the blame on his own shoulders, and as
the Russian authorities are very. strict in
such cases he had to absent himself In a
hurry. He managed to reach Hongkong
and stowed himself away on the America
Maru. He has not gained much, how
ever, as the captain of the mail boat has
him locked up in the brig and will take
him back to Yokohama, where he will be
turned over to the Russian authorities.

doll show on November 8 and 3 in the
Maple room of the Palace Hotel. It will
be even a more interesting *jtÂ»w
was the last one. and in addition the man
agers of the society have arranged at
tractions the like of which fc'an Francisco
has never seen.
Continuous Performance.
In connection with the doll show will be
a continuous performance, with features
carefully arranged for the benefit jind
amusement of the little folks. This will
be during the afternoons of the doll show
days. The evenings will be enlivened j
with vaudeville of a kind never betore i
dreamed of in this Western metropolis.
The Bohemian Club, which has hitherto
kept ail its brilliancy for its own enter
tainment, is going to contribute to this
Doctor's Daughters' vaudeville perform
ance.
The vaudeville programme will be made j
up on the most approved pattern of i
I\ew York's up-to-date vaudevlllian )
treats. There will be monologists, mas- |
ters of black magic, a lightning change
artist, who will make the biograph look
like an old-fa:Â«iiioned daguerreotype, and
a one-act play.
Bohemian Club Cast.
It is upon this one-act play that the
ladies managing the affair most particu
larly pride themselves. It was written by
a member of the Bohemian Club. It will
be presented by members of the Bohemian
Club. In other words, the Bohemian Club
will contribute to this benefit for this most
deserving charily organization in a man
ner it has never done before for anything
outside of its cwn most sacred ceremo
nials."
Just who wrote the play and who will
be the players are secrets the Doctor's
Daughters decline for the present to di
vulge.
Another feature of the vaudeville pro
gramme will be the "Florodora" double
sextet, presented by six society girls and
as many society men. The admission to I
the vaudeville performance will be $1, but
for $25 one may purchase a box for both
performances.
The doll show, or doll bazaar, for all
the dolls will be for sale, â¢will be the best
of its kind, and will afford a splendid op
portunity for acquiring the ammunition
necessary for popularity among the little
folks at Christmastide. There will also
be a doll's house.
D oil's Mansion.
This house, donated by the Misses
Grace and Lillian Spreckeis. is to be raf
fled. It was designed and built under the
FuperviFion of Reid Bros., the local archi
tects. The structure is now complete and
Is going through a course of furnishing
and decorating, and is being put into
shape generally by those who know best
how to <2o it. \u25a0 When complete- It will be
as properly appointed as the most prince
ly mansion in the land.
The scene of the happenings will be the
Maple room at the Palace Hotel.
Miss Susan McEwen is president of the
Doctor's Daughters' Society.
Mrs. Frank D. Bates is chairman of the
doll committee and will be glad to receive
doll contributions from friends of the
work of the society.

AMERICA MARU REACH ES PORT
WITH MANY NOTABLES ABOARD
OPENINGS MADE
FOR B. P. FLINT
Chance for Asa R.' Wells
to Get His Man on
the Ticket. â¢
Two Candidates for Offlce
of Supervisor Are
Ineligible.
The local Republican Campaign Com
mittee can now easily gratify Asa R.
Wells' desire to have Brilsford P. Flint
placed on the ticket for Supervisor. A. F.
Roberts, one of the eighteen candidates
selected for the convention's ratification,
is not eligible to the offlce for which he
'was nominated. . Fqur years ago he voted
at -San Jose -and the fact, is not disputed
that he was then a resident of Santa
Clara" County. As the J provision in . the
new charter requiring . five years' resi
dence in â¢ the city to render one eligible
for the offlce of Supervisor cannot be
changed at this time, the only course to
pursue -Is to change candidates or leave
a vacancy on the ticket. Herein lies the
opportunity for Mr. Wells to again pre
sent the claims of B. P. Flint. There is
no doubt as to the qualification of Mr.
Flint ; on the score of residence, as he
was -a candidate for Mayor in 1878 and
has Resided here ever since.
Should anything occur to render it em
barrassing or inopportune for Mr. Flint
to succeed Mr. Roberts on "the ticket
there would still be a door open to admit
Mr. Wells' favorite. It is said that Adam
Andrew. . has - not resided â¢ continuously In
San Francisco a sufficient length of time
to qualify him for service in the local
legislature. Should the campaign com
mittee,-composed of Max Goldberg, Pat
Prendegast and .others, find, after careful
investigation, that Andrew is a "tender
foot," according to the charter definition,
Mr. Wells could step, forward and submit
to the managers a statement setting forth
the merits of his friend Flint.
It transpires at this late day that the
wishes of the Thirty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict delegates were set aside and ignored
In the nomination -of Roberts. The dele
gates â desired the nomination of "W. "W.
Allen, but he was turned down. When
he got the first intimation of the turn
down â¢ he threatened to put up $10 and
take a smash at the slate, but 'reflection
cooled his ardor, and lo*-al -friends per
suaded him to nominate Roberts. '
Joseph S. J Tobin, Democratic nominee
for Mayor, will make some remarks this
evening on the occasion of the organiza
tion of the First Tobin Club. ,
Asa R. Wells, Republican nominee for
Mayor, will address his fellow citizens
next Saturday evening.

Mrs., Emma Ohe May Recover.
- Mrs. Emma One, the unfortunate wom
an who was beaten nigh unto death by
her husband, showed a slight improve
ment in her condition yesterday. She
gained consciousness during the day, but
not to such an extent as to give a lucid
description as to how she , came by her
injuries. Her eyes are still closed by the
wounds " about her head. The physicians
think that unless she has received Inter
nal injuries, which have not yet been dis
covered, she will recover in the course of
several weeks. '

the California Anti-Caloric Company,

told Hicks he could have Mlzner arrested
for trespass if he continued his visits.
THE SAN- FRANCISCO GALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 19O1.>
Indolence is to the mind what rust is to
iron. V
Fire broke out in Gimbal Bros.'
candy factory at 530 Washington, street
early last evening:. Before the engines
responding 1 to the first alarm arrived the
blaze had gained alarming: headway and
Chief Sullivan sent in a second call for
apparatus.
. The damage will amount to about $2000,
\u25a0which is partly covered by insurance. Fred
Hillman, employed by the Underwriters'
Fire Patrol, fell down an open elevator
shaft from the ground floor into the base
ment and injured his shoulder.
The origin of the fire is unknown. It
was first seen by Special Officer JoÂ© Gil
len about 8 o'clock. Flames were then is
suing from the third-story windows in the
rear. The drying room is located on this
floor. All the employes had left two hours
before. The damage done to stock on the
first and second floors was principally by
water.

Butter was quoted quieter and weak yester
day. Not all of the arrivals from Humboldt
last week are yet cleaned up. There Is a wide
range between fancy creameries and the me
dium and lower "grades. " "*.J,
Cheese Is steady and unchanged.
Eggs continue to show a very wide range;
according to quality. Strictly fancy ranch
brands are firm enough, but all Eggs not large
and strictly white are Inclined to drag. Stocks j
of all kinds are' moderate.
The retailers continue to run on cold stor
age Butter and Eggs, owing to their cheap
ness as compared with the. fine fresh goods.
Receipts were 10.000 pounds of Butter,

Some Wine Grapes arrived in bad order and
were sold at the bottom quotation. Receipts
of Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons were light
and good stock sold readily. Watermelons were
lower owing, to the change in the weather; one

NEW YORK. Oct. 14.-Efforts by large
rpeculative Interests to sustain and advance
the f tock market continued in evidence to
day. They succeeded In overcoming the early
uneasiness, but as the level at prices rose ever
that of Saturday their following decreased and
the advance. lost in force. It. was not aggres
eive at any time and was restricted to a few
â¢stocks, notably St. Paul and the Pacifies The
elimination, of. a large proportion of the short
interest as a result of the advance late' last
week deprived the market of an Important
element of strength. It was evident that a
sustained advance at this time would have to
depend on the efforts of the larger financial
powers. These elements were supposed last
week to have embarked on a campaign for
the advance owing to inside information of
plans to settle the Northern Pacific tangle
bu* apparently last week's reports, on that sub
ject were either not well founded or were pre
mature. The suspicion has gained force that
the circulation of those reports was a manipu
lative measure against the ehortr. or was de
signed to test the â¢ possible effect upon epecu
latlon of the actual announcement of some
such measures. The perception emerges that
measures to finance the Northern Paciflc set
tlement are the great object to be attained at
present rather than large ulterior projects of
additional consolidations. \u25a0 The prevalent

R says: Salmonâ There is very little change
to report in this market, except that holders
generally are not such free sellers at present
prices. The consumptive demand continues
good throughout the country. In Liverpool
there is a much larger consumptive demand
and prices are much firmer than this day
week. The inquiry has caused a rapid decline
in stocks, and it is more than probable that
there may be a squeeze in certain sizes and
ehapes of salmon before the new goods can

CHICAGO. Oct. 14.â Wheat was considerably
more active and firmer and continued in the
steady upward tendency it has shown for the
past week. Local conditions in the pit operated
to some extent, but the sudden advance on
Liverpool cables, together with outside bullish
conditions, helped prices and December opened
%@%c to %<3%c higher at 70%@70%c. The
Russian, crop fell off, the movement in the
Northwest was hampered by. wet weather,
there was a decrease in the amount of bread
stuffs on passage and In world's shipments,
primary receipts were somewhat decreased and
there was a \u25a0\u25a0 , small Improvement in exports.
These all gave strength to j wheat, but on the
early rise holders of long corn and oats be
gan to unload and thus bereft wheat of some
of Kb buoyant feeling and December sold oft
to 70%c. Â»When this pressure was removed De
cember rose to 70%@71c. Profit taking at the
end of the session eased prices and December
closed firm, %@%c advanced, at 70%c.
Corn ruled steady, â¢ with scarcely anything
beyond a local pit interest. December closed
steady and unchanged at 55%c.
Oats were moderately active. December
closed steady, a shade lower, at 35%@35%c.
Provisions started out with a comfortable
advance due to a firmer hog market, but met
with more of that general liquidation that de-'
pressed prices a week ago. Trade, however,
was comparatively narrow and local. January

Market Street Railroad stock still erratic and
fluctuating. Other stocks quiet.
Business was very dull on the morning ses
sion of the Bond Exchange. The only sig
nificant transactions were in Market Street
Railroad at $90@89 50, an advance. The brokers
report that there is some doubt among specu
lators and buyers over the condition of the
deal with the Eastern syndicate and the cau
tious ones are disposed to go slow. There was
a rumor that the company had declined to ac
cept any more subscriptions to the agreement
among the small holders to sell their stock at
par and this had a tendency to confuse the
market and check buying. The other stocks
were without esneclal feature.
The oil stocks continued dull.
In the afternoon Market Street -Railroad con
tinued erratic, selling up to $32 25 and" back to
$91. Honokaa Sugar was firmer at $11. There
were sales of Alaska Packers' at $141 50@141.
The excitement in California Wine Association
seemed to have subsided, though some stock
changed hands at ?S5 50 on both morning and
afternoon boards.

It is claimed, however, that the resolu
ion represents the sentiment of part
>f the treaty making power, and
Â« a pledge that the treaty should not be
interpreted as Incorporating the Philip
pines as a Territory within the same
neanlng as Porto Rico. No opinion on
his case will be handed down for sev
eral weeks, however, because Justice
3rown has not gU'en any intimation to
lis associates as to which view he will
ake. The court may not hand down an
;pinion until after Congress meets, and
hen some action may be taken that will
â¢lear up the position of the Government
oward the Philippines.
The Philippines case is different from
Doth these case.;. The court will recognize
the Philippines as territory belonging to
the United States, but it may find that
pacification there is not sufficient to take
Them out of the war power of the Presi
dent. In the Srst Dooley case the court
held that the President had power to fix
duties, as Porto Rico was foreign terri
tory held by the war p^wer.
Representatives of the Government be
lieve that the eourt will take this view
of the Philippine* case and decide that the
islands aie no; yet sufficiently pacified
to come within the meaning of the treaty
as domestic territory, waiting for the ac
tion of Congress. The McEnery resolu
tion adopted by the Senate at the time
the treaty was under consideration, de
claring it was not the purpose of the
United States to incorporate the Philip
pine Islands or their people into the
United States, if regarded as having some
weight with the court, though that joint
resolution was never adopted by the
House of Repreeentatives or signed by
the President, and cannot be presented aa
having fcrce of law.
Unlike Porto Rico.
Philippines Case Differs.
CALL BUREAU. 1106 G STREET, X.
XV.. WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Justice
Brown will probably write the opinion in
the fourteen diamond rongs case, which Is
to decide the status of the Philippines in
relation to customs laws of the United
States. There nas been considerable spec
ulation as to what the decision of the
court will be on this case, but the best
information obtainable here is that the
court has not yet reached a final agree
ment. Chief Justice Fuller and Justices
Harlan. Brewer and Peckham are op
posed to the Government contention that
the Philippines are not a part of the
United States within the meaning of the
customs laws, and Justices White, Shiras,
Gray and SlcKenna support the Govern
ment contention. This was the division
of the court on the Downs case, relating
to Porto Rico. It is not known what po
sition Justice Brown will take. He de
cided both 'he Downs and the De Lima
cases last spring, in the former case writ
ing the opinion sustaining the Govern
ment, and in the latter case writing the
opinion against the Government.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Men of the professions crowded tbo
rooms of the Press? Club, on Ellis street,
last night, the occasion being a concerc
tendered the club by the Royal Italian
Band, following that organization's ap
pearance at the Alhambra Theater.
Preceding the concert Congressman Ju
lius Kahn, wh> recently returned from
the Philippines, entertained the gathering
with an interesting talk on his experi
ences in the nowiy acquired possessions.
He gave a humorous sketch of Filipino
traits of character, and said that prac
tically all that was left of the insurrec
tionary movement was embodied in th<s
person of Malvar, whose force, hauntin;;
mountain fastnesses, succeeded In evao
ing the American troops. Yesterday* t
dispatches had shown that Malvar. fol
lowing the late encounter with Maccabebe
scouts, had retreated further into the
mountains. The Congressman believed
the insurgent chief would soon lay down
his arms. . . "
Mr. Kahn said that he enjoyed the ques
tionable distinction of being one Ameri
can citizen who had no Fourth of July
this year.
"I want to lodge a protest against thÂ«
action of the captain of our transport,"
said' he. "You are all familiar with the
fact that in crossing to the Orient a day
is lost somewhere out on the Pacific. In
the hurry and bustle of life one wouM
overlook this, but the captain of our shljj
had so timed the voyage that the day thac
was taken from U3 was the day of all
days for Americans. ' We skipped right
along from July 3 to July 5, and were
cheated out of our holiday."
The Royal Italian Band, composed a!
fifty-four pieces, rendered a number or
classical selections that were enthusiasti
cally received. The acoustic properties
of the club's jinks hall are admirable for
the soft-toned instruments with which the
strangers from sunny Italy deal out mel
ody, and the concert was a rare treat.- -
S. Homer Henley, the barytone of the
Press Club, sang the prologue. to "I Pag
llacci" and, in response to an encore,
Chadwick's "Bedouin Song."
President McLean said that Mark Twain
was directly responsible for the falling
off.
The afternoon session was devoted to
the reports of various committees, ad
dresses and the election of officers for the
ensuing year.
The following officers were elected:
President, A. McLean, Cincinnati; first
vice president, W. S. Dickinson, Cincin
nati; second vice president, B. C. De
weese, Lexington, Ky.; third vice presi
dent. I. J. Spencer, Lexington, Ky.;
fourth vice president, A. B. 'Philputt, In

Miller. Covington, Ky.; treasurer, S. M.
Cooper, Cincinnati; corresponding secre
tary, F. M. Rains, Cincinnati: auditor,
Russell Errett, Cincinnati: medical exam
iner. Dr. P. T. Kilgour, College Hill, Cin
cinnati.
The treasurer's report showed receipts
during the year amounting to $171,888, a
decrease compared with the collections of
a year ago.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. ll.-The annual
convention of the Christian Foreign Mis
sionary Society opened to-day in the Ex
position Auditorium, with President Mc-
Lean in the chair. The attendance was
unusually large.
The principal address of the morning
session was delivered by M. E. Farris, a
young man who has spent the last few
years in missionary work in the Congo
Free State.
Farris was very severe in his denuncia
tion of the Belgian Government, which
administers affairs in the Congo, claiming
that the Government was corrupt from
top to bottom. He had seen natives shot
for failing to turn in their per capita tax
on rubber, even when they lived in dis
tricts which produced none of that com
modity. Furthermore, Government oili
cials did everything in their power, un
officially, to hinder the missionaries in
their work.
The royal party left for Brantford,
Stratford and Woodstock at 4 o'clock, the
Governor-General's section of the train
leaving shortly afterward for Toronto.
A short stop was made at this point, and
afterward the train left for Belleville,
where both sections remained for the
night,
The Duke, as on many similar occasions
before, wore the uniform of the Royal
Irish Fusiliers. He and the Duchess were
met by Mayor Hendrie and escorted to
carriages, amid the cheers of the crowds,
and driven to the City Hall, where loyal
addresses were presented.
In the afternoon the Thirteenth Bat
talion received a new set of colors from
the Duke.
BELLEVILLE. Ont., Oct. U.-Thc Duke
and Duchess of York to-day covered a
considerable distance of their eastward
journey. Leaving . Nlagara-on-the-Lake
this morning, the royal train went west
ward as far as Hamilton, where several
hours were, spent. The train then round
ed the western end of Lake Ontario and
started on its long journey to the At
lantic coast.
The royal party received a series of
hearty ovations. - At fSt. Catherines the
school children sang patriotic songs as
the train pulled into the station. Lady
Minto, wife of the Governor-General of
Canada, was one of the first togreet the
royal party when the train stopped at
Hamilton. â¢ â¢ .

v:bf TraveL
Since his confinement in Auburn prison
several thousand letters have been re
ceived for him at the prison as well as a
large number of express packages, con
taining flowers and fruits. The letters,
flowers and fruit have never reached the
condemned man. The flowers and fruits,
it is learned, have been sent by Christian
societies, as have a number of letters con
poling him in his last moments. Other
letters have come from cranks who have
written about the species of torture to
which they would put him if they had the
execution of lustfee in his case. It is
stated, however, that it. would be a matter
of surprise if the names of senders of
fruit and flowers were made public. The
State Prison Department has pursued a
uniform policy in regard to Czolgosz. An
'effort has been made to prevent the mur
derer from gaining any notoriety while
awaiting death and to surround him by
as perfect an isolation from the world as
possible.
ALBANY, X. Y.. Oct. 14.-Superintend
ent C. V. Collins will send a request to
Secretary, of State. Hay to designate an
official representative of the Government
to be present at the electrocution of Leon
F. ' Czolgosz, the murderer of President
McKinley. Only twenty-six witnesses
will be present in the chamber of death
when the sentence is executed. Warden
Meade of Auburn Prison has sent to Sup
erintendent Collins the requests he has
received for permission . to attend ! | tlie
electrocution, over loiKJ in all. The law
will limit .the number of witnesses and
the superintendent will decide who the
witnesses shall be.
It was stated at the State Department
of Prisons to-day that statements to the
effect that Czolgcsz is m a continuous
State of collapse and that he breaks down
and weeps every time anything is said
to him concerning the electrocution . are
false. Superintendent Collins had a talk
with the condemned man some days ago
and at that time he said he knew he had
to die. He expressed no fear as to the
electrocution, but said that he. would not
care to go outside of the prison, for he
believed that the people would kill him.
But Few Spectators to
Be Admitted to t he
Electrocution. !

KBUGER IS ACCUSED
OF ATTEMPTED ARSON
Charged With Trying to Burn Down
a Neighbor's Barn on Flimsy .
. Evidence.
August F. Kruger appeared before
Judge Fritz yesterday on a_ charge of at
tempt to commit arson. He is accused by
F. de CurtonI, 803 Clement street, of at
tempting to set fire to his barn Sunday,
but when the case was called, Curtoni
said he did not want to prosecute and ad
mitted he had a grudge against Kruger.
De Curtoni was later induced by Attorney
Campbell, who represented him, to 'swear
to the complaint against Kruger. ' ;
Attorney W. G. Burke, on learning that
the defendant was - not represented by
counsel, volunteered to appear for him.
He told the Judge that the defendant, who
was scarcely responsible for his actions,
was a targe.t for his neighbors' children,
who persistently. threw rocks at him and
at his house. Sunday he went to the gro
cery for some coal 611, intending to use
it in burning up a quantity of. rubbish
that he had gathered together. He set
fire to the rubbish and Curtoni had him
arrested for attempting to set fire to his
barn.
Kruger has his mother, who Is 91 years
of age, living with him, and she is. only
able to move, around by crawling on her
hands and knees. Burke asked the Judge
to make an order, permitting Kruger to
goto his home in charge of a policeman,
Â«o that he could explain to his aged
mother why he was compelled to remain
away from home and the Judge sighed
the .order. Fire Marshal Towe is satis
fied there is nothing in the case and when
it is called this morning it will probably
be dismissed. \ - .

So far 112 members have been assigned
to duty and others have signified their
willingness to assist in the work. As each
member has promised to make at least, a
dozen pictures the resulting prints will
tax the committee with a severe task
when the work is completed and' the fin
ished pictures begin to come in.
As a compliment to J. W. Erwin. presi
dent of the club, who originated the plan
to photograph the city, the committee has
prepared a special badge for use on the
days of the expedition.
A ej>ecial bureau in charge of Carl E.
Ackerman, the chairman of the special
committee, will be maintained at the club
rooms on the days of the expedition and
each worker has been instructed to keep
in touch with the club quarters, so, should
the emergency arise, he can be detailed to
cover special events in his district.
This city \u25a0will have Its first complete
picture taken a week from to-day. Last
night the special committee of the Cali
fornia Camera Club completed its work
and all of the members who volunteered
their services have been notified of the
territory to which they have been as
signed.
Every effort \u25a0will be made to portray the
life and action of the city and to further
this end many of the best workers In the
club have been assigned to districts in
the center of the town. An attempt will
be made to catch the matinee crowds at
all of the theaters on the 19th. Market
street has been divided into a large num
ber of districts in charge of skilled work
ers with fast lenses, so that the crowds
that throng the principal artery of the
city will be caught on many plates.
The Harbor Commissioners have placed
one of the State tugs at the disposal of
the committee and will take a number of
photographers on a trip along the water
front. Permission has been obtained to
land a photographer on Goat Island to
photograph the Naval Training School
and to make an immense panorama of
the city from the top of the island.

There Is a very Interesting exhibition of
the art of the miniaturist this week in
Vlckery, Atkins & Torrey's art rooms, the
work of a local artist. Miss Laura Prather
of Oakland. Miss Prather has some nine
teen or twenty portraits on exhibition, all
clever and some of exceptional merit. Her
work has the delicacy and grace that
mark the best - miniature methods; she
draws well and has the happy faculty of
seeing; the best side of her subjects.
Among the portraits perhaps the prettiest
is that' of Master Van Clelf Herrin, a smil
ing baby boy. that is surely like the
model. Mrs. Harry East Miller's is a
charming portrait and with that of Mrs.
Samuel, Hubbardâ a delightful faceâ and
the quaint old-world portrait of Mrs. C. E.
Webb, is perhaps Miss Prather's happiest
effort. Mrs. Thomas Prather has also
been deftly pictured by the artist and the
portraits of Mrs. Phelan and Mrs. Irving
M. Scott when a girl are also charming.
The "Ideal Head" is also clever work.
The other portraits, all Interesting:, are
those of Mrs. Edward Lukens. Edward

Chief Sullivan at once detailed Ed Gib
son to board the vessel outside the heads
and take the Chinaman Into 'custody.
Last evening Gibson hired a tug and
started out to Intercept the bark. The
quarantine boat had preceded him and
when Gibson attempted to board the bark
he was promptly ordered oft by the Quar
antine officers. After explaining that he
had been sent to arrest the Chinese mur
derer he was allowed to speak â¢ to the
captain. â¢ The last named, on learning of
the dispatch from Alaska, said that the
much wanted man was aboard, accom
panied by one of bis victims, who was
shot through the stomach. Gibson gave
the captain a pair of handcuffs and re
quested that they be placed on the wrists
of the murderer.
Chief of Police Sullivan received a dis
patch yesterday from Alaska asking him
to arrest Wong Chet, a notorious, high
binder, who Is wanted there for commit
ting several murders. After giving a

According to the allegations made in a
complaint for divorce filed yesterday by
Mrs. Viola Matteson against Duane Mat
teson, her husband is -a past master in
the. art of making threats to end his ex
istence. Mrs. Matteson is only 19 years
of age and has been married but two
years, yet according to her complaint she
has had trouble enough to last her a life
time. She alleges that her husband while
employed at the navy yard at Bremerton,
Wash., wrote to her and told her that he
was so tired of life that he felt death in
the waters of Puget Sound would be a
relief. He also on another occasion wrote
to her. she alleges, and told her that sui
cide was not cowardly. .To end one's ex
istence to benefit another was a sacrifice,
and Christ himself had set the example,
he declared. In his next letter suicide was
still in his mind, but a change had come
o'er the spirit of his dream, which no
longer pictured him as .the victim. He
saw that it was his wife who was slated
to commit suicide, and in his second let
ter he told her she was the one to make
the sacrifice. '
A number of divorces were granted by
the Superior Judges yesterday. They
were:
E. Avery McCarthy, the well-known real
estate man, was 4 granted a divorce from
Lillian Wagner McCarthy by Judge Heb
bard yesterday on the ground of deser
tion. ,
The proceedings were very brief. Mrs.
McCarthy was not in court, but was rep
resented by her attorney. McCarthy was
the only person placed on the witness
stand, and his examination was very
short. He told how happily he and his
wife lived for several years after their
marriage, which occurred In April, 1892.
Then came the change, and his wife came
to him one day and told him she no long
er loved him. From That time on, McCar
thy said, they lived apart, though under
the same roof. Mrs. McCarthy assumed
control of one of the children, while he
looked after the .other. Such a manner of
living was not a "happy one, and he finally
entered suit for divorce on the ground of
desertion. Before 'commencing the di
vorce proceedings McCarthy turned over
to his wife one-half of the community
property, thus preventing a row over
property rights. Judge Hebbard in grant
ing the divorce did not interfere with the
arrangement made concerning the chil

.There was much satisfaction, expressed
over the verdict. A charge of murder was
placed against the prisoners.
Police Officers Charles W. Brown and
Frank A. Lycett: told how they got into
a buggy at Nineteenth and Howard
streets and pursued Buckley, whom they
overtook on Seventeenth street, between
Folsom and Harrison. The prisoner was
pale, perspiring and out of breath; he
could hardly .speak, but managed to say
that he was running to catch a car on
Harrison street. No oars were running
on Harrison . street, within three blocks
and a half of that point. Buckley denied
all knowledge of the shooting. Fifteen
minutes later on the way to the County
Hospital he said that he had been at the
scene of the shooting, but had not taken
any part in it; that he and two or three
others had gone out to see what he sup
posed would be- a fist fight, but that It
proved to be otherwise, and he ran away
because he didn't want to take any part
in it. When they brought the prisoner
before the dying man Rice said: "I think
you are the man." Buckley said: "Now
be sure about it; don't give me the worst
of; it." Then Rice said that he was- not
positive that Buckley .was the man, but
he looked like him.
A large number of witnesses testified to
the facts of the murder In corroboration
of that of Mr. and Miss Piatt. They all
agreed that the murderer wore a light Fe
dora hat, tan shoes and faded grayish
clothing. Arthur Cleve, a boy, identified
Buckley as the but the other
witnesses could not be positive.
The statement made by Buckley impli
cating himself and his companions In a
conspiracy to "do up a scab" was nar
rated by ; Detectives Ryan, Fitzgerald,
Bailey and s Graham, Sergeant Duke
and others. From this statement it ap
pears that the conspirators met In Ma
loney's saloon at Brannan and Zoe streets
and Buckley .was informed by Duncan
that they were going out "to get a scab,"
that they boarded a Howard-street car on
which Rice was riding and that two
strangers were of the party. The shooting
was done by. a man with a black derby
hat, one of the strangers. Buckley ran
away after the shooting. This statement
is contradicted by all the witnesses, who
swore that the shooter wore a light Fe
dora, and Buckley's hat was Identified
positively by several witnesses. While
they were telling about the murderer's
hat â¢ Buckley placed his hat under his
knees and was trying to get it under his
chair, when Sergeant Duke took - posses
sion of.it and placed it on the Coroner's
desk. . \u25a0, \u25a0 . \u25a0 :
Policemen Tell of Pursuit
The shadow of the gallows loomed up
ominously in the Coroner's office yester
day when Walter J. Piatt and his 14=-year
cl(! daughter walked down from the wit
ness ; stand and placed their hands firmly
upon the rfght shoulder of William Buck-
Icy to identify him as the man who bru
tallj murdered George W. Rice fÂ»t the in
tersection of . Twentieth and Howard
streets last Friday evening. This dramat
ic 'scene; was rendered necessary by the
order of Harry Hutton, the regular attor
ney for^the Pacific Coast Sailors' Union,
who refused to allow the prisoners, Buck
ley, Donnelly, Moran and Duncan, to
stand up for the purposes of identification
or to give their names to the Coroner.
Mr. Piatt was the first witness called.
His story was to the effect that when the
car on which he was riding stopped at
Twentieth and Howard streets at about
six minutes before 6 o'clock last Friday
evening a man who had got off the front
dummy began clubbing Rice. After the
sixth or eighth blow Rice fell to the
ground on. his back. As he fell .the man
v/ho was clubbing him stepped back and
the man who had been on the front dum
my stepped to the front and fired four
shots into the body of the prostrate man.
Man With Club Identified.
"Can you identify the man who did the
clubbing?", asked the Coroner.
"Yes," answered the witness.
"Is he in this room?"
"Yes."
The witness pointed out one of the four
prisoners. In obedience to a request of
the Coroner Moran rose to his feet.
"What is your name?" asked the Cor
orer. . .
'Don't answer it, Moran!" said Attor
ney Hutton. "These men are not here for
the purpose of furnishing evidence against
themselves." ,
In obedience to a request from the Cor
oner the witness placed his hand on Mo
ran's shoulder. He afterward did the
same when identifying Buckley as the
shooter. ' <
, The witness, continuing his testimony,
told how he had started to chase the mur
derers, but .had been recalled- by .the
screams of his frightened -daughter. '
; Erllne Piatt, the daughter of the first
witness, corroborated the testimony of her
father. She saw Buckley on the dummy
in fronfof her, and, had- a good look into
his face. He. had a scratch on his right
cheek, was clean shaven and wore a light
Fedora hat, grayish. clothes and tan shoes.
As soon as Rice fell to the ground Buck
ley stepped off the dummy and fired four
shots from ' a revolver into the body of
Rice, who was lying on the flat of his
back.
"Is the man who fired the shots present
in this room?" asked the Coroner.
"He Is." replied the erlrl.
'"You realize that the life of a man may
depend upon your testimony?"
"I do."
"Then place your hand on the man who
did the shooting."
The little girl walked down to where
Buckley was sitting and placed her hand
on his shoulder,
"I have made no mistake, sir," she said
to the- Coroner. "I am positive that that
Is the man."
Tliat the said George W. Rice, 4O
years of age, machinist, 3353 Twen
tieth street, came to his death. at the
City and County Hospital on October
13, 1901, through shock and hem
orrhage from gunshot wounds of ab
domen and chest inflicted by certain
parties known to the police as Wil
liam Buckley, Thomas Moran, Charles
Donnelly' and Edward Duncan ; and
i'rom the evidence given we charge
the same William Buckley with hav
ing inflicted the gunshot wounds that
caused the death of the said George
W. Rice, and we charge the said Wil
liam Buckley with the crime of mur
der;, and we further charge the said
Thomas Moran,, ..Charles Donnelly
and Edward Duncan as accessories to
the crime of murder. â Verdict of Coro
uer's jury in Rice" inquest.
The bill empowering the Civil Service
Commission to employ a stenographer for
three months v,as finally passed.
An offer of $12,000 was made to the own
ers of the Bay View farm, which it is
proposed to use as a site for the pest
house.
The petition of James H. O.'Brien for
permission to grade and macadamize
Chestnut and Francisco streets, between
Octavia and Lriguna, and Octavia and La
gruna streets between Francisco and
Chestnut, went to the Street Committee.
The petition cf M. H. de Youjig for per
mission to erect a seven-story building of
a height of 109 feet on the south side of
Geary street, between Stockton and
Powell, was referred to the Building Com
mittee.
City Architect Mooser was called upon
for an explanation. He said that his du
ties comprised only the supervision of
building operations and the inspection of
permits. When he took the position he
did not agree to draw plans for public
buildings. To do so woilld require the
establishment of another bureau in the
Board of Works, said Mooser. Reed then
vrithdrew his objection.
A new resolution was adopted fixing the
value of property owned by the city at
$2S,871,200. The first resolution fixed the
valuation at 127.000,000, which was a de
crease of more than $1,000,000 from the
figures of last year. Mayor Phelan di
rected Expert Williams to investigate,
and the latter reported that the error was
due to the fact that the Auditor had re
turned the figures for 1899 instead of for
1900. The new figures show that the value
of city property has increased by $241,000.
The ordinance authorizing the Election
Commissioners to employ a deputy regis
trar and a chief clerk, atta salary of $150
per month each, was defeated. Fourteen
votes were required and it received only
thirteen. Reed and McCarthy voting no.
McCarthy quoted the charter again to
chow that the limit of salaries for era
plo>ies in the registration office Is $100 per
month. Erandensteln stated that the City
Attorney had advised the board that it
had the power to create t"he positions at
the advanced salaries. Braunhart changed
his vote to aye and gave notice of recon
sideration, so that Clerks H. Zemansky
and D. Gordon, who are slated for the
promotions, may be yet able to secure one
more friendly Supervisor.
The bill providing for the full accept
ance of Howard street from Eighteenth
to Nineteenth. Mission from Twentieth to
Twenty-second, Washington from San
eome to Battery a.nd Valencia from Her
mann to Fifteenth was finally passed.
The bill authorizing the payment to T.
J. Welsh of S657 for drawing plans for
the Howard-street engine-house was
passed by the Board of Supervisors yes
terday after Reed had vigorously opposed
its passage. Reed contended that the
Board of Works employs a city architect,
who should have done the work, and that
the additional expense should not be sad
dled on the city.
Braunhart wanted the resolution amend
ed so the Board of Works would ascer
tain the cost cf construction by special
investigation. Reed objected to allowing
the company any more time to give the
information on the ground that it had
not kept its pledge to keep portions of the
streets paved. Reed moved the indefinite
postponement of the resolution and called
for a vote on the ordinance fixing the li
cense at $50 per annum on each car.
Braunhart held that action should not be
taken until a legal investigation had been
made. Brandenstein denied the charge
that the company had refused to give the
Information asked for. He said It was
willing to give figures if granted the
necessary time. Brandenstein opposed re
taliatory measures because the company
had failed to keep its promise, and held
that to impose the tax without proper in
vestigation was unjust.
Failed to peep Fledge.
* Under the rules all measures are re
ferred to committees, and Reed's motion
that his proposed ordinance be sent to
the Committee on Public Utilities, of
which he ! is chairman, was adopted.
Brandenstein's motion to postpone indefi
nitely was declared out of order. He then
argued that the threatened legislation was
not advisable and moved that the bill be
laid on the table. He held that it was
wrong to drive away capital from the
city by adopting hostile legislation.
Reed then submitted a list of streets
having abandoned rails or cable slots un
removed. They include blocks on Post
and Leavenworth streets. City Hall ave
nue, Grove, Polk, Ellis, Shrader and Page
streets. Masonic avenue, California and
Howard streets and the crossings of Fifth
and Howard, Grove and Larkin, Post and
Powell, Hayes and Polk and California
and Montgomery streets.
A resolution was adopted directing the
Market-street Railway Company to fur
nish within thirty days certain informa
tion on the cost of construction of its
various etreet car lines. The company
wanted ninety days for the purpose. The
information is desired so that a conclu
sion may be arrived at regarding the pro
posal to increase the license tax on street
cars.
A bill was introduced by Reed at yes
terday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors fixing the rate of car fares at 3
cents. Reed explained that he submit
ted the bill for the purpose of compelling
the Market-street Railway Company to
rcpave the streets on which are its aban
doned tracks. He asked that the bill be
pasted to print with the understanding
thai if the company repaved the streets
Its final passage would not be pressed.
The ordinance follows: v
Section 1.' The fSre for transporting pas
sengers from dne point in the city and county
of San Francisco, on any street railroad, or
extension or connection thereof, ' Including
transfers, is hereby established at 3 cents.
Section 2. Any person charging or collecting
more than 3 cents for such transportation is
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction
thereof shall be punished by . a fine of not
more than $500. or be Imprisoned for not more
than six months, or by both such fine and im
prisonment.
Section 3. This ordinance shall â¢ take effect
Immediately.
Sent to Reed's Committee.
\u25a0 I think that when the war does break out
that.it will be the bloodiest in the history of
the world, as they are both great nations in
point of numbers and they will nght with mod
ern and improved arms. The cause of the
trouble Is no secret In Japan. It wants Korea.
Japan is not large enough for the Japanese.
The population is too great, and if it was to
secure Korea it could flood Korea with its sur
plus population. Russia practically holds
Manchuria . and Japan does not intend letting
this nation 'extend its influence to Korea if
this condition <can be prevented. Hence the
preparations for war.
Nicholas Senn, M. D., professor of sur
gery of the University of Chicago, ar
rived here yesterday and is at the Palace.
Dr. Senn is one of the best known phy
sicians in this country and is touring the
world. He paid a recent visit to Siberia
and Japan and after a thorough study of
both 'countries he has concluded that a
war is impending between Russia and
Japan. . ,
He says that the war clouds are rapidly
darkening the peaceful horizon of the
Orient and that when the. war between
these -powers does break out it will be
terrible.. He said:
While -I was In Japan I noticed on every
hand that the Japanese were making prepara
tions for war with Russia and they made.no
secret of it. The Japanese are loyal to the
core. Coolies, merchants and princes are all
preparing for the struggle. Â«nd they will all
loosen their purse-strings and give their money
to purchase supplies when the right time
comes. .
I expect to stay in the United States until
the middle of December, when I will go to
England, so as to be In London during the
Christmas season, to observe the* methods ot
handling this extraordinary rush of matter,
which -burdens the post, at that time. In
general I believe we have an excellent service
in Japan now, and that there will be few
things which will be necessary to introduce,
so it is that I shall givÂ« the best part of the
time I am laying out to spend in America to
the telegraph systems which would be appli
cable to our conditions. \u25a0 . â¢ \u25a0 '
Among the arrivals from the Orient yes
terday was D. Aoki, Minister of* Com
munications in the Cabinet of the Japa
nese Emperor. He is accompanied by
Yasuo Riko, chief electrical engineer of
the department. They are touring l \u25a0 the
world and hope in this way to glean in
formation which will be of practical use
to Japan, n an Interview yesterday. Mr.
Aoki said: . - .
As to our affairs as a nation, I believe that
the worst Is passed and that there will be
soon a chance to recover what the present de
pression has brought to us. There is no doubt
that there was a clear case of a financial 1 " de
pression upon us, and its cause perhaps was
Just as plain. Some of our people believe that
we made too much of. our army. We are very
proud of the army, and its showing during the
recent troubles in the East proved that we
were not mistaken in It. The armies of the
world came 'in contact with ours and the
result; was that the methods of our soldiers
were approved by the men of every other
nation. It is the general feeling In Japan that
the close service of our soldiers and those of
the United States will mean much in the con
tinued friendly .relations of the two Govern
ments; â¢ . - 3 â¢

costs nothing whatever, and \u25a0 the Information gained will be worth much to you, even
