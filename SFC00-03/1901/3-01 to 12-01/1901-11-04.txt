ment to Schmitz Corner of the Contest
yi FEW days ago it was feared that the large silent or amstrv-
ativc vote of the city would be divided and thrown about
equally for Tobin and Wells. The apprehension then existed
that Schmits by operation of the division would become the winner in
th? race for Mayor, but the recent tendency of businessmen and
property owners toward Mr. Tobin has convinced many of the leading
pclitkians that the class nominee will be defeated and Mr. Tobin
elected. Nevertheless the election experts figure that Schmits will
carry the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-first, Thir
ty-second and Thirty-third Assembly districts. Tobin' s election will
probably be secured by a good vote in the Schmitz districts and an
immense vote in the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh,
Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, Forty-second and Forty-third
districts.
Sam Rainey is handling the Wells figlU in the Forty- fourth
District and Judge Dibble has charge of the Wells forces in the For
ty-first. Dibble lost the district a year ago, but hopes to liand it over
c bosses to-morrow. The non-partisan vote, composed largely of
Republicans zdw arc dcz'otcd to the cause of clean local government,
k very formidable in the Forty-first and is solid for Tobin.

|I ago, when James D. Phelan and
â¢**- Horace Davis were the leading
candidates for Mayor. 52.000 citi
zens voted- It is the impression
that nearly all the Republicans who
voted for Phelan two years ago will, for
consistency's sake, vote to-morrow for
ToMa, because the latter represents the
Ideas of government under the new
charter which Phelan was pledged to
carry out. The fact that the time-hon
ored advocates of good, clean municipal
governmentâ men like E. B. Pond, George
K. Fitch and Thomas McGeeâ ear
nestly requesting voters to support Tobin
gives color of truth to the assertion that
tho great silent, conservative vote of the
city will be thrown to Mr. Tobin. It Is
known that the real estate and Insur
ance men have resolved to . vote for
Tcbin. Efforts on the part of Republi
can bosses to swing this influence to
"Wells have signally failed.
Managers of Wells' campaign made a
grievous mistake at the outset which
they are now attempting to correct. Dib
bli. Burns, Goldberg and Herrin advised
that special exertion should be made to
heem Schmitz's candidacy, on the theory
that the whole fight would turn on a
contest to obtain the Democratic vote
end that Wells would hold the Republi
can column. It did not occur to the
bosses that the fight would become so
vigorous between Tobin and Schmitz that
etch would appeal to the Republican
Vote for assistance.
Changing Plan of Campaign.
The indications are that half the Re
publican vote will be carried away from
Wells. Republican bosses, now aroused
tc a sense of danger, are seeking to
change the plan of campaign. At the"
outset the bosses gave out money to be
used in booming Schmitz. Now they are
trying to break Schmitz's column, but
every break south cf Market street so
fr.r recorded has been in favor of Tobin.

JOSEPH S. TOBIN, WHOSE ABLE ADDRESSES HAVE MADE HIM THE FAVORITE CANDIDATE.
STATEMENT GIVEN TO THE CALL IN WHICH THE CANDIDATE
SUPPLEMENTS PREVIOUS DECLARATIONS FROM THE PLATFORM
THE campaign is over. A. duty has been performed. We have denned the issues and presented them to the public. To the plan of campaign formulated at the outset we have consist
ently adhered. Our purpose lias been to address the citizens of Sin Francisco not in any partisan char-icter but as taxpayers and business men.
That this practical and reasonable method of reaching the mind of the impartial citizsn has been sif active cannot be denied. Day by day we have strengthened our position
until now we unquestionably hold the first place in the public mind.
Taking Into consideration the position
that v c occupied when this campaign was
initiated, our present position is a sure
indication of success. It could not be
Otherwise. To present the problem of mu
nicipal government to the public mind as
it has been educated and elevated by
study and experience in any other guise
than as a question purely of practical
business would be absurd.
The debates and discussions indent to
the creation of the present charter; the
turning over !n the minds of the public
of the principles of municipal government
at the lime when the charter was present
ed to the people for adoption; the contro
versies that have arisen by reason of the
change from the consolidation act to tlvi
charterâ all these things have had the ef
f< ot of impressing upon the public mind
ti.e principle that municipal government
i* a purely domestic affair.
That the charter has been a success
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1901.
is unquestionable; that It promises to re
sult even more favorably for the welfare
of the city when it shall have become :i
more familiar instrument of municipal
government in ihe hands of the officers oC
the city is also unquestionable. But it
must be continued in operation; it must
continue to be handled by men nominated
by conventions in sympathy with the
spirit of the charter and by men whoso
political character indicates a spirit in
sympathy with the scope and spirit of tha
charter.
Issues Ara Identical.
We have ell e.ong contended that thes*
two issues are, as it were, identical. A
government by the charter, under the
charter and through the charter must hi
a government imploying practical busi
ness methods. We contend that all thosÂ»
who inaugurated and have thus far car
ried forward with success a movement for
clean municipal government in San Fran-
Cisco must support us now. We ltnow
that all those v/ho are interested in .t
proper businesslike administration of the
charter, who are interested in making Sa.t
Francisco wholesome and livable, must
support us, for to this end we have di
rected all cur efforts in the past, and to
this end we shall direct all our efforts in
the future.
We make this appeal to all such citi
zens, and we are convinced that they will
support us. It has been said of the great
Carlyle that he v/ent through life shed
ding the light of his intellect upon the
world in search of a man, but secretly de
lighted when he found a monkey. The
citizens of San Franci3co have for years
and years been in search of an honest,
clean municipal government. Should they
now repudiate that government they will
be placed in the cynical attitude toward
domestic affairs that Carlyle occupied to
ward the human race. But no, there are
no, such citizens. The audiences that we
have addressed in various parts of San
Frar.cisco, by their enthusiasm and atten
tion, have convinced us that all the citi
zens have that same goal in view.
Saved Society Millions.
We have saved the city of San Fran
cisco more than a million dollars. We
have reduced taxation, have reduced the
water rates, have reduced the gas rates,
have improved the Â«treets, have kept the
public buildings absolutely clean, have
beautified the parks throughout the city
and created new ones, and we have done
all this- without the taint of scandal or
'a charge of fraud.
All those who have come in contact with
the present Beard of Supervisors know
that in order to secure the passage cf a
bill or ordinance, the granting of a license
cr any other legislative act, it was . in
cumbent upon the petitioner to present t>
meritorious case. The condition of th

Executive Board of the Building Trades
Council Finds Union Labor Candidate
for Mayor Guilty of Charges as Made
rHE executive board of the Building Trades Council last
night officially declared Eugene E. Schmitz, the Union Labor
candidate for Mayor, to be guilty of the charges of ''scab
bing" preferred against him by three members of the machinists'
craft. A thorough investigation 9 of the charges that Schmitz had
secretly dealt with non-union iron concerns was made zvith the result
that findings zvere returned to the council declaring the charges fully
proved. The standard bearer of the Union Labor party zvas de
nounced as being a traitor to the cause of unionism in San Fran
cisco, increasing by his acts the misery suffered by the families -of
striking machinists. _____
THE executive board of the Build- '
ing Trades Council last night
officially declared Eugene E.
Bchmitz, candidate for Mayor on
the Union Labor ticket, to be un
worthy of the support of the
workingmen of San Francisco.
The meeting of the board was a stormy
one and no conclusion was reached until
midnight. The testimony of Messrs.
Reardon, Twomey and Lane, who signed
the charges against Schmitz, was heard
at length, and the verdict of guilty was
reached unanimously.
When isie meeting was called to order
by Acting Chairman Harry Costen. the
subject matter was at once gone into, and
City Hall itself presents an object lesson.
By the lawyers and litigants who were
compelled to visit it from day to day it
was formerly looked "upon as a disgrace
,to the city.
It is now thoroughly cleaned and reno
vated and In cleanliness and appearance
is the equal cf any large building in t >-.vn.
This in Itself is a small matter, but it m
clcates the practical utility of the charter.

After the stories of the principal wit

principles as a union man â were heard, it
was decided to send for Messrs. MeCab*
and Wisler, president and secretary, re- '
spectively, of the Iron Trades Council,
and hear their statements. This was
deemed necessary in order that no com
plaint might . hereafter be made that the
investigatl an-^jraÂ»_not . strictly * impartial '
and that m opportunity was given*
Schinltz's friends to testify in WÂ» behalf.
When MeCabe and Wisler appeared be
fore the . board and were requested to
state If permission was granted Schmita
by the Council to deal with non-union
concerns during the strike, they returned
evasive replies^ Neither made a definite
refutation '. of Reardon's charges, and
when asked to produce the minute 'book
in which the alleged permission to
Schmitz to deal with non-union concerns
was alleged to be recorded they refused
on the ground that the board lacked juris
diction in the premises. Both men, wko
are warm supporters of Schmltz's candi
dacy, assumed a defiant air and remarked
that no action the board might takÂ»
would Influence the vote of the laboring
people for Schmitz to-morrow.
Documents Declared Authentic.
The publication of the fac-siznile docu
ments by The Call showing beyond ques
tion that Schm'.tz constructed the ammo
nia tank on the steamer Alameda for the
Risdon Iron Works, notwithstanding that
firm was avowedly non-union, was dis
cussed at length. Neither McCabe nor
Wisler could deny the authenticity of the
documents published by The Call, but
they professed to treat the matter as of
no consequence as far as the purposes cf
the investigation were concerned. Th*
signature of Schmlta to the letter accept
ing the contract was a convincing an
damning proof of hi 3 treachery to thÂ«
cause of unionism, which he claims to
support, and several members . of thi
board openly denounced him as a traitor
to the cause of labor In San Francisco.
Little evidence of importance as shed â¢
ding light upon Schmltz's transaction*
could be secured from MeCabe or Wisler.

being a farce, and warm words resulted.

Controversy Comes Near
to Ending in Tragedy
on the Public Streets
THE meeting of the executive board
of thÂ« Building Trades Council at
7 City Hall Square, held for
the purpose of investigating
the charges against Eugene E.
Schmitz, candidate for Mayor on
the Union Labor ticket, came very
near resulting la a tragedy yesterday ait
ernoon.
The lie Vas passed, personalities were
indulged in by a group of Schmitz sympa
thizers who had evidently gathered to In
timidate the witnesses who were to appear
before the board, and a pistol was drawn.
But for the prompt interference of by
standers, the sequel to the filing of the
charges against Schmitz might have been
murder.
The trouble was precipitated by Joseph
Millmore. chairman of the late labor con
vention, Thomas McConnell, a shipwright
and a teamster named Eckles. These men,
surrounded by a number of followers, all
adherents of Schmitz and other labor can
didates, were grouped in front of the Car
pet Mechanics' headquarters on City Hall
Square when T. A. Reardon and Ed Two
mey. the machinists who tiled the charges
against Schmitz. approached. They were
to give their testimony before the board
ana this fact was made the pretext by
the Sctimitz men named to call them to
account for tailing the course they did.
"You're a pair of -scaos,' " said Mill
more to Rearaon and Twomey, as he
nourished a cane excitedly.
"1 can prove that," added McConnell an
grily.
Reardon answered that he was not there
to answer unofficial charges. If the per
sons addressed were not satisfied with mm
they might report the fact to the Council.
Beardon Draws a Revolver.
The discussion became general. The
Scnmitz men appeared to be greatly exer
cised at what they termed the rascality
of the three men who hied the charges
against Schmitz, and they upbraided them
in forcible language for making charges
Â¦which, they asserted, it was impossible lor
any one to substantiate. Reardon indig
nantly denied that he had made false
charges.
"1 have told the truth!" shouted Rear
don, with his hand at his hip pocket. "'I
say Schmitz did do 'scab' work during the
strike, and your statement that he was
given permission ro do the work by the
Iron Trades Council is false. McCabe and
Wieler are the whole works as far as the
Council is concerned, and their statement
in answer to the charges that permission
was given Schmitz to cio scab work is un
true. 1 defy them to produce the minutes
of the meeting at which this permission
was granted, is recorded. They don't dare
to show the minutes, because the books
would prove both McCabe and Wissler to
be liars. My reputation for truth is as
good as theirs, and 1 stand on my charge
that Schmitz is a 'scab* and unlit to be
Mayor. He may have pulled the wool
over your eyes, but he can't do it in my
case."
Millmore made some angry retort
whereupon Reardon sprang back with the
remark that if any one eot behind him he
would shoot. Quick as a flash he drew a
revolver and held it before him on a line
with Millmore's heart. Millmore remained
motonless as a statue, but said nothing to
further Infuriate the angry Reardon.
President McCarthy, of the Building
Trades Council, stepped between the par
ties at this juncture, and Reardon was
induced to pocket his weapon. He an
nounced his intention to shoot the first
man that offered to molest him during the
proceedings which were pending.

Twomey announced also that he would
not permit any one to molest him, where
upon Eckles made some insulting remark
which Twomey resented with a blow on
Eckles' neck. Bystanders separated the
belligerents, and McCarthy and some
friends hustled Reardon and Twomey Into
a side room of the headquarters, while the
Sehmitz men on the outside consulted as
to the course to pursue. After a few mo

FORMAL FINDINGS AGAINST CANDIDATE SCHMITZ
ARE REPORTED BY THE UNIONIST COMMITTEE
THE executive board of the Building Trades Council, having been directed by the council to investigate the charges made against Eugene E. Schmitz, ln
ion Labor party candidate for the office of Mayor, after a thorough and careful consideration of the entire subject matter, presents without fear or favor the
following preamble and findings:
PREAMBLE. â¢ %
The Building Trades Council is a central body which represents in its entirety all labor engaged in the buikling industry.
The Building Trades Council has at all times endeavored to promote the best interests of the city, State and nation. No power or influence of whatso
ever nature behind any political candidate will induce the Council to support an unworthy person, be he a union man or not.
In judging the fitness for office the Council considers the trustworthiness, competency and attitude toward labor of political candidates, regardless of
affiliation or partisanship, opposing only those who by reason of their acts are unworthy of labor's support.
FiisriDiisra-s.
No. 1. We find upon oral and documentary evidence that Eugene E. Schmitz has since June 3 (date of molders' walk-out) purchased the product of non
union molders at Liberty Iron Works, Enterprise Foundry and Beale-street Foundry.
No. 2. That he has continued to do so until Wednesday, October 30, 1901, at which time a cylinder for the Economist Gas Engine Company was dis
covered at the Beale-street Foundry (non-union), and upon the facts becoming known by the president of the Iron Trades Council was immediately removed.
No. 3. That Eugene E. Schmitz between June 18 and August 20, 1901, built for the Risdon Iron Works two ammonia compressors with engines at
tached; that said Risdon Iron Works was then and is now non-union.
No. 4. That Eugene E. Schmitz upon being challenged to refute these charges has failed to do so, but on the contrary, to excuse his treachery; has
brought forth Messrs. McCabe and Wisler, who, according to their statement in the Examiner of to-day, admit Schmitz's guilt in the premises.
No. 5. That McCabe and Wisler by this statement admit their treachery to all union men now on strike, and reveal a plot to boom Mr. Schmitz's can
didacy at the cost of every 'aboring man in the iron trades.
No. 6. That to excuse Mr. Schmitz's conduct Messrs. McCabe and Wisler admit having consented to and sanctioned dealings with non-union concerns,
which have resulted in the prolongation of the strike and serious damage to the iron trades cause.
No. 7. That McCabe and Wisler before this, the executive board of the Building Trades Council, refused to honestly answer questions seeking thorough
information on the charges made, and whatever answers they made were weak and evasive. Both gentlemen resorted to subterfuge in o^r to shield Schmitz.
In view of the foregoing we are convinced that Eugene E. Schmitz has violated every principle of unionism; that prior to and during his candidacy he
has done immeasurable harm to the cause of the iron trades; that Messrs. McCabe and Wisler, to further Schmitz's candidacy, have dishonestly assumed his
guilt, hoping to prevent an upheaval against Schmitz; that it is a regrettable fact that the loyal trades unionists in the iron trades are to-day suffering for the
necessaries of life as a result of the double dealing of William McCabei R. I. Wisler and Eugene E. Schmitz. HARRY COSTEN, Chairman Pro Tern.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 3.â Half a

Vancouver Island, are in jail as the re
sult of a bitter fight between different
tongs of Chinese. The Celestials first be
gan to fight over the arrest of the chief
of one of the factions and now the trou

Chinese on both sides have been arrested.
The first fight on Friday night was a
riot in which a hundred Chinese took
part. Several shots were exchanged and
one man was wounded, though not se

ENRAGED GREEKS TIE MEN TO THE RAILS
IN EFFORT TO COMMIT FRIGHTFUL CRIME
Engineer and a Section Boss at a Nevada Town Narrowly Escape Being
Murdered Under the Wheels of a Train at Night.
CARSON, Nev., Nov. 3.â Frank Krause, a locomotive engineer, and John Shea, a section boss, had thirty
minutes of terrible suspense in anticipation of a horrible fate at Beowawe, Nev., on the line of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, last Friday evening. Both were tied across a railroad track by a mob of infuriated
Greeks and were doomed to be crushed by a train which was soon to pass. The earnest pleadings of their
friends accomplished their release a few minutes before the headlight of the engine that would have ended
their lives flashed upon the rails.
This atrocious attempt at murder grew out of a saloon brawl in which Krause and Shea were concerned.
Both men engaged in an argument, during which Krause drew his revolver and fired at Shea. The bullet missed
its mark and struck a Greek laborer in the shoulder, passing through his body. This accident enraged the
Greeks and about sixty of them, employed as section men, seized the participants and hurried them down the
railroad track to a point about half a mile from the town. A few friends of the prisoners followed, but did
not take the situation seriously, as they little guessed the intentions of the captors.
When the men were tied to the rails those who followed attempted to release them, but were beaten back
by the Greeks, who declared that both captives should be cut to pieces by the first train that passed. Several
times the friends of the men made an effort to rescue them, but their endeavors were, futile. At first it was
hoped the Greeks only intended to frighten the men and no messenger was sent back to the town for assistance.
When the pure cold-bloodedness of the preparations was better realized by the friends of the men, the train that
was to complete the fiendish work was due in a few minutes. Several of the party that had followed the Greeks
tried to escape from the crowd for the purpose of flagging the train, but were prevented from doing so. Mean
while the intended victims were piteously pleading for their lives. At a most fortunate moment the station
agent came to the scene, and at "his earnest- request, which was subsequently supplemented by threats, the men
were given their liberty. They had scarcely risen from the track when the train thundered by.
After Krause and Shea reached Beowawe they lost no time in packing their belongings and leaving the
vicinity.
RAILROAD MANAGERS DISCOURAGED

yesterday afternoon. The park meeting
was advertised as a great rally under the
auspices of the Young Men's Republican
Cluu, but no audience assembled to hear
the orators. An adjournment could not
be taken, as thc-re was no one to make a
motion tb adjourn. The orators simply
corked up their oratory and stole away.
The Wells campaign simply fizzled out
yesterday. He cannot be withdrawn from
the ticket at this late day, but the word
can be given out that a vote for Wells is
a half-vote for Schmitz.
Wells' headquarters in the Grand Hotel
were deserted yesterday. There was no
Sunday closing- proposition, as the doors
was deserted yesterday. There was no
about. The atmosphere of the rooms was
somewhat purified by fresh air. The place
certainly needed ventilation.
Burns' Methods in Vogue.
The old dodge of sending money to
lodging-house keepers, tenderloin joints
and water front saloons has again been
resorted to. This Is Colonel Burns' favor
ite method of electioneering. He tried It
on in the Estte campaign, but learne 1
nothing from the disaster which overtook
him in San Francisco. The Republicans
carried the State outside the city for E3
tee by 12,000 majority, but owing to Burns'
blundering proposition to buy blocks ol
votes and to Boss Kelly's knife Estee
was defeated. Dibble Is the best politician
in the whole bunch behind Wells. Sam
Ralney is a back number. He stands out
in front of the St. George stable lecturing
on the duty of voters to be guided by
lofty sentiments of civic patriotism and
to vote for Wells. Business men can take
their choice in this campaign. They can
follow the advice of E. B. Pond. Thomas
Magee and George K. Fitch and vote for
Tobin, or they can accept the advice of
Sam Rainey, Dan Burns and Dibble and
vote for Wells.
A few days ago a report was circulate!
that the Veteran Firemen's Association
was opposed to Tobin. The president of
Special Dispatch to The Call.
the association, Mr. Bonner, states that
the report Is utterly false. He wishes tho
announcement to be made that the asso
ciation Is in no way connected with poli
tics.
Sam Ralney. Greaney and Maxwell, of
the old fire department push, are inflating
themselves with the notion that they can
swing the department to Wells in the
contest for Mayor. The Rainey talk
about a reorganization of the department
is hot air. In fact Rainey Is regarded by
the firemen as a played out back number,
who was greatly overrated when he was
at his best in politics. A well known mem
ber of the department remarked last
night that there was no truth in the re
port that the firemen were supporting
Wells. He said: "We are satisfied with
the present condition of affairs and are
not alarmed about the future. The de
partment is well governed and effective.
We ought not to interfere in politics and
there will be/ no interference. No one in
the department Is influenced by Rainey.
He is regarded as a back number."

SCHMITZ OFFICIALLY DECLARED
Continued From Page One.
chf-mpion, and while they claimed per
mission was given Schmitz by tae Iron
Trades Council to perform work 1 jr nor.
union shops they declined to produce the
official record in proof of their asjjrtlons.
The flimsy and transparent defense made
in Schmitz's behalf by these officials of
the Iron Trades Council was absolute
proof of Schmita's guilt, and when a vote
on the findings was taken it was pr?c
ticaily unanimous.
The findings were in substance that th
charges as made by Messrs. Reardon,
Lane and Twomey were amply proved.
Official cognizance was taken of the docu
ments published in fac simile by Th--
Call showing that Schmitz had applied
for and was awarded the contract for
building the ammonia tank on the steam
er A'.ameda. This matter was made the
subject of one of the findings of guilt.
Wordy War Follows.
After the meeting a number of Schmitz's
friends who were awaiting the results of
the board's deliberations called Reardon
to account for bringing the charges
against Schmitz. They declared that he,
and not Schmitz, was a traitor to the
cause of unionism, and they accused him
of working in the interests of political
candidates who are opposed to the Union
Labor ticket. Reardon defended himself
vigorously, and a wordy war followed,
which threatened to end at one time in
blows. Considerable bitterness was mani
fested on all sides at the verdict returned
by the board. In anticipation of trouble,
an officer had been sent for, and his pres
ence in the vicinity prevented hostilities
The effect of the finding of Schmitz's
guilt will be to cause many of the union
men belonging to unions affiliated with
the Building Trades Council to switch to
some other candidate for Mayor to-mor
row. That Schmitz's practices" during the
strike will cost him many votes seems
to be a certainty. Union men argued last
night that if Schmitz betrayed the cause
of unionism he might also betray them
after election, and in order to avert such
a contingency many union men who were
stanch for him yesterday will eppose him
earnestly to-day.

WELLS' RALLY
OF SPEAKERS
AND WAITERS
Political Barbecue at
Glen Park Proves to ,4
Be a Veritable Frost
Orators Work Off Their
Speeches on Crowd at
a Bullshead Breakfast
THE Republicans held their last
rally of the campaign yesterday
afternoon at Glen Park. It was a
free barbecue. It was under tha
auspices of the Young Men's Re
publican Club. It was attended by
a select gathering of orators and
the waiters hired to dish out the gratuit
ous refreshments.
Glen Park ha 3 seen few quieter dayÂ»
during the summer months.
The orators, led by Attorney Thomas F.
Riordan, made an early start in search of
the demonstration. For several hours the
residents of Su-inyside were pestered with
inquiries as to the whereabouts of the Re
publican rally. The park was thoroughly
searched and the inhabitants of that dis
trict closely Questioned, but not a traca
of the demonstration could be found until
a policeman informed the searchers that -
he had seen jome kind of a free lunch
counter waiting, for business in a certaia
part of the park.
The Herrinitea finally located the Re
publican rally, xhe search had made them
nungry.
"Well, we can eat. anyhow." remarked
one famished office-seeker.
"What's the use," said Chairman Rior
dan, "of playing Robinson Crusoe? Ifa
too lonesome, boys. Let's get up here to
Sunnyside. The Old Friends' Society ia
having a bullshead breakfast there. We"ll
get something to eat, and you fellow*
with speeches will have somebody to work
them off on."
And Sunnyside went. Fred Raabe made
arrangements to relieve the orators of
their speeches, while J. E. Slinkey sliced
some bulls tongue for the Republican
search party.
They all had breakfast.
The orators sot rid of their speeches.
The representatives of the Republican
ticket had their rally around the hospita
ble board of the Old Friends instead of
amid the solemn silence of their schedule!
rallying ground.
Riordan disappeared mysteriously. One
by one the orators found the friendly
stanchion of a home-going car. They had
had their rally and the campaign was
over.
And one of :he Old Friends was heard
to ask Police Sergeant Blank:
"Who was them worried looking fel

Acting Governor of Hawaii Appeals
for the Admission of Chinese
Labor.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â Authority for
the conversion of all Hawaiian silver
coins into corresponding coins of the
United States, and for the immigration of
a limited number of Chinese laborers, con
ditioned upon their engaging in agricultu
ral pursuits only during their residence in
the Territory and their return to their
own country upon ceasing to be farmers,
are the recommendations of H. E. Cooper,
acting Governor of Hawaii, in hla annual
report.
other recommendations are for the
maintenance of an expert forester on the
islands to investigate and report on forest
conditions and forestry conservation and
extension: the detail of a special agent
of the Fish Commission at Honolulu and
the adoption of restrictive measures to
prevent wanton destruction of the food
tishes of the Territory; the granting of li
censes to divert water from lands where
it is of no avail to arid sections that own
ers are adapting to agricultural pursuits;
the erection of a Federal building in Hon
olulu for the accommodation of the Fed
eral Court, Postofflce, Custom-house and
Federal officials; the retention from the
customs receipts of a sufficient sum to pay
judgments of the Commission of Fire
Claims; the gathering of statistics to
show the shipments between the mainland
and the islands, and the appointment of
a Deputy Secretary to act during the dis
ability of the Secretary of T .he Treasury
tor Territorial purposes only.
The report snows that, though there
has been an increase on the part of the
Hawaiians, the total of those of Hawaiian
descent shows a decrease, the most rapid
in the commercial centers. The prosperity
of the islands, according to the actine;
Governor, depends upon the successful and
economical production of sugar
'The employment of Chinese and Japa
nese by the planters," he says, "never
has interfered and never will interfere
with either American skilled or unskilled
labor, but if an ample supply of desirable
labor can be obtained it means millions of
dollars spent for machinery, buildings
tools, steel and iron and other supplies of
American make."

have made against Jane Toppan. the Rob

This statement, the Herald will say to
morrow, was made yesterday by John
Whitney of thj State police, who reached
his home in Medford Saturday from New
Hampshire. The Herald will say further:
"Miss Toppan probably would not have
been arrested at once had not District At
torney Holmes and Officer Whitney
feared she mignt commit suicide. Officer
Whitney remembered that a short time
before Miss Toppan had made two at
tempts to end her life. A long time be
fore she was arrested the police, had been
trying to confirm a suspicion they ha I
that a patient she had nursed in Lowell
had died from poison. In January. 1900.
Dr. Herbert B. Mclntyre of Cambridge
was satisfied that a patient of his, Mn
My: a S. Coinors, who was nursed by M 3*

BERLIN, Nov. 3.â The German
press, which was at first disposed
to disregard General Voyron's
criticism of Field Marshal Count

ally lashing itself into a rage as the dis
rjssicn of the French general's letters

posed friendliness of the allies during the
campaign was only on the sur
face, and that underneath there burned
that smoldering hatred of French and
clerman for one another that occasionally
manifested itself in minor clashes between
fcidiers of the two nations. Germans
t that General Voyron sought to
make the French officers and troops in

that only Yon Waldersee's skillful diplo
macy prevented an open rupture.
It is not likely that the German Govern

the press is disposed to regard their pub

TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 3.â Owners of
small cattle herds In this State are sell

cf business. This situation is brought
about by the purchase of large tracts of
land by large cattle raisers who have been
protecting their own interests. They

available grazing lands in the upper Col

owners of large herds will pasture their
cattle upon their own lands instead of
Â¦upon common ranges.
As grazing lands en the forest reserves
are very limited the small cattlemen
dare not depend upon these ranges alone
and are therefore selling out. The ranges

Cause Arrest of an
Officer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 3.â With the alleged de
liberate and premeditated co-operation
and assistance of a King County deputy
Sheriff, Captain E. N. Handy, convicted
of swindling and sentenced to a term of
two years in the penitentiary, has escaped
from the King County jail and is now at
large, with small prospect of being re
captured. H. W. Whitford is the officer
alleged to be responsible for Handy's es
cape. He has been arrested for the al
leged crime, which is a felony under the
laws of this State.
Miss Nellie Handy, the missing man's
sister, and Mrs. E. Frackelton, are ac
cused of complicity in Whitford's alleged
crime and have also been placed under ar
rest. Sheriff Cudihee states that he can
find no possible excuse for Whitford's con
duci, and says that he Is satisfied that the
women aided and abetted him in plan
ning and carrying out Captain Handy's
escape.
Captain Handy slipped through Deputy
Sheriff Whitford's fingers In Tacoma at
noon Saturday. Whitford took Captain
Handy to Tacoma, in Pierce County for
the alleged purpose of allowing the latter
to consult with a friend regarding a bail
bond, and there Buffered Handy to go ou;
of his sight for three hours. At the eni
of that time he went in search of hit*

could not be found. Instead of notifying

coma for an hour and then returned to
this city. After arriving in Seattle he
went to bed without taking any steps to
protect himself from blame for Handy's
escape.
First News of Escape.
At 11 o'clock this morning Sheriff Cudi
hee learned from Whitford what had
happened in Tacoma. The Sheriff acted
promptly in the matter. He went befote
Justice Cann and swore out warrants
which were forthwith placed In the hands
of officers for service. Whitford was ar
rested at his home and brought to th 3
County Jail. The two women were soon
found and placed in the cell which had
been vacated by Captain Handy. Justice
Cann fixed the bail in each case at $5000.
Immediately after learning that Hand\'
had escaped Sheriff Cudihee began work
ing the wires for his recapture. Tele
grams were sent to all the principal cities
of the coast giving a description of the
fugitive and offering a reward of $250 for
his arrest and detention- Since Captain

Botha Personally Directs the
Attack Upon Colonel Ben
son's Command.
PRETORIA. Nov. 3.â Further details
have been received regarding the attack
by the Boers under the command of Gen
eral Botha last week on Colonel Benson's
command near Brakenlaagte, Eastern
Transvaal. It appears that General Bo
tha, who had been joined by another 1 big
commando, aggregating 1000 men, attack
ed Colonel Benson's rear guard on October
30 on the march and captured two guns,
but was unable to keep them.
Colonel Besnon fell mortally wounded
early in the fight. Major Wools-Sampson
took command, collected the convoy and
took up a position for defense about 100
yards from entrenchments prepared by
the Boers. The captured guns were so
situated that neither side could touch
them. â¢
The Boers made desperate /efforts to
overwhelm the whole British force, charg
ing repeatedly right up to the British lines
and being driven back each time with
heavy loss. The defense was stubbornly
and successfully maintained through the
whole of the following day and the next
night, until Colonel Barter, who had
marched all night from Bushaman's kop
je, brought relief on the morning of No
vember 1.
The Boers then retired. Their losses are
estimated at between 300 and 400. Colonel
Benson did not long survive.
Not only did General Botha direct the
attack, as already cabled, but he person
ally shared in the fighting.
Boers Charge During Storm.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â The special dis
| patches from South Africa reveal practi
j cally nothing iurther about the disaster
to Colonel Benson's column. It appears
that the first attack was made in a blind
ing rainstorm.
The heaviest casualties occurred while
Major Wools-Sampson, who is a Johan
nesburg reformer and an officer in one of
the colonial levies, was gathering the
convoy under the brow of a hill â a moot
difficult task.
It is assumed in London that the two
fifteen-pounders remained in possession of
the British, but the telegrams are not
clear on this point.
Edgar Wallace, correspondent of the
Daily Mail, writing trom Pretoria on
October 12, again protests against official
optimism and declares that the war wUI
not be ended for another year. He urged
the immediate dispatch of large rein
forcements of both men and horses.
"Even when all that is possible has
been done in this direction," he says, "'t
will be necessary to wait grimly and not
to expect any quick result."
Pro-Boers Attacked by Mob.
A riotous scene occurred yesterday in
Peckham, a suburb of London. A small
gathering of the local branch of the
Democratic League undertook to hold a
meeting to protest against the war in
South Africa. The manifestatloners start
ed in procession for the place of meeting,
but were hooted, buffeted and dispersed.
A crowd estimated at 20,000 gathered to
oppose them. There were many ugly
rushes and the police were barely able to
protect the struggling pro-Boers from the
fury of the populace. After much fight
ing, during which a mar* was stabbed, tlu
pro-Boers were removed under police pro
tection. The victorious crowd then held
a jingo meeting and sang "Rule Britan

KING EDWARD SPEAKS
OF WAR IN SOUTH ATBICA
Firmly Hopes and. Prays for the Re

Prosperity.
LONDON, Nov. 4.â At the dinner on
board the royal yacht Victoria and Albert
last Friday evening King Edward, toast
ing the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall
and York, gave a sketch of their tour.
Referring to their arrival at Cape Town
his Majesty said: "There, unfortunately,
the war is prolonged, but we firmly pray
for the re-establishment of peace and
prosperity."
In conclusion the King said: "In all the
colonies thus visited they fulfilled their
mission, expressing the gratitude of the
mother country for the aid generously ao
ibrded her in the hour of need, and they
were everywhere received with a cor
diality of loyal enthusiasm which could
not have been surpassed. The accounts
of these receptions have touched me
deeply and I trust the practical results
will be to draw closer the strong ties of
mutual affection which bind together the
old motherland and her numerousf*thriv

The Duke of Cornwall in a felicitous re

OwinK to the fact that the fugitive has
a start of more than twenty hours, due
to Whitford's delay in reporting his es
cape and to the further fact that there
13 no clew whatever to his movements
after eluding Whitford in Tacoma, there
is apparently little hope that Captain
Handy will be recaptured
Captain Handy had been a pensioner in
the County Jail for more than two years.
He was last May tried before Judge Grir
fin in the Superior Court and convicted of
having been the accomplice of Dr. E. F.
Adams in the alleged swindling of Dr.
J Eugene Jordan of this city to the tune
of $10,000 in the sale of the ancient steam
ship Professor Morse, in Oakland harbor,
in the spring of 1898.
Famous Criminal Case.
The case has become famous In the
criminal annals of King County. Dr.
Adams, whose home ia at Chicago, was
first tried. The jury in his case dis
agreed. Pending a second trial he was
released on heavy bonds and is now said
to be in Texas. Captain Handy was less
fortunate and subsequently to hi 9 arrest
was unable to obtain bonds, and was
kept a prisoner in the County Jail. His
bail was fixed at $5000 after he was tried
last spring, found guilty and sentenced.
Captain Handy's home is in San Fran
cisco He came to Seattle several yÂ»ars
ago He is well known all along the coast.
He is 50 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches tall,
rather heavily built, weighs about 200
pounds and wears a Van Dyke beard
closely cropped. His right arm is crippled.
During his long residence In the county
jail Captain Handy established for him
self the reputation of being a model pris
oner and was as a consequence allowed
many liberties not accorded ordinary in
mates of the prison. To the fact that the
rules were relaxed In his case is largely
due his present liberty.

Admiral Caillard's Orders.
It Is pointed out that the absence ot
news Is not surprising, as the instructions
to Admiral Caillard were to steer due
south and to avoid passing in sight of
Bonifacio, Corsica, or traversing the
Straits of Messina, in order to prevent his
movements being signaled. The vessels of
the division carried only a normal supply
of coal, but this would be much more
than enough to enable them to steam 1500
miles, the estimated distance they must
cover before reaching their destination.
It is expected that Admiral Caillard will
be joined en route by the torpedo cruiser
Condor, which is stationed In Cretan
waters, and may be met by the torpedo
dispatch boat Vantour, which is stationed
at Constantinople. It is also probable that

GRASS VALLEY, Nov. 3.â The home
coming of John May yesterday was as
sad as tr.e shock to him severe. The
young man arrived from the mining camp
of Tonopah, Nev., to visit his father,
whom he had left in usual health at Ne

rived in this city he was grief-stricken to
learn that his rather had died last Mon

communication the young man did not re
ceive it.

It is also said that three other warships

CLERGYMEN URGE
CHOKER'S DEFEAT
New York Pastors Ad
vocate Election of
Low.
Sermons From Many Pulpits
Arraign the Tammany
Administration.
SCJ3W YORK. Nov. The feature of
tlie local campaign to-day was the active
part taken in it by the pastors of the
churches. Thirty-one clergymen and two
leaders of independent church societies
advertised themselves ' to (--peak on the
issues of the election and all took for their
.-subjects the alleged maladministration of
the present city officers. Rabbi Schut
-nan, the one Jewish priest whose ser
mon was reported, urged his hearers to
support the fusion ticket because of the
revelations concerning vice in the tene
ment districts.
All Protestant pastors except two talKed
of the fusion ticket, asserting that vice
and unsanitary conditions existed here,
and a change was needed. The exceptions
Â¦were Dr. Davis, G. Wyiie of the Scotch
Presbyterian church and Rev. Dr. Vande
water of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church,
who advised their congregations to ex
amine the two tickets closely and vote
for the best men on them. Henry Fran*
of the Metropolitan Independent Church,
advised his hearers to vote "againsc
bosses, whether they came from this city
or Tioga County."
Rev. Father J. Ducey of St. Leo's Ro
man Catholic Church was alone â¢ among
those reported who spoke for the Shepard
side.
Women in the Campaign. ,
One of the features of the fusion cam
paign has been the work of the Women's
campaign Committee. A report issueu to
day says this committee had distributed
several hundred thousand copies in Ene
ish and -German of a pamphlet purport
ing to be an expose of vice in the city.
The Democrats also had a women's cam
paign committee actively at work during
the canvass, but no report of its labors
has yet appeared.
While trie fusion campaign practically
closed last night, a few more meetings
have been scheduled for Monday an.i
Monday night. Senator Depew is .down
for a speech during the day. at a meet
ing to last from noon until 5 o'clock.
The Democratic campaign was carried
on with vigor to-nig-ht. The party leaders
had engaged five theaters and from the
stages of these the orators cheered their
supporters with words of coming victory.
The Democrats intend to carry the work
up to the last moment. To-day they had
not changed their forecast which is that
Mr. Shepard will receive a majority in the
greater city of about 50.000. - -
Robert C. Morris of the Republican
County Committee to-day repeated his
assertion of Saturday that Mr. Low's ma
jority would be 70,000 in Greater New
York. â¢
Gangs of Repeaters Formed.
Superintendent of Elections McCullagh
to-day addressed a letter to Police Com
missioner. Murphy, informing him that it
had been ascertained that a large gang
of repeaters had been organized in Jersey (
City to come over to New York to vote 1
In the Ninth Assembly District in this |
city. His information mi also that an
other gang had been formed in that dis
trict to invade Jersey City and he asked
Colonel Murphy's assistance in prevent
ing the repeaters voting. Chief Murphy,
of Jersey City, was also informed of the
alleged attempt to be made to vote il
legally.
REPUBLICANS ARE CONFIDENT.
No "Off Year" Conditions Confront
the Party in Ohio.
riNCIXXATI. Nov. 3.â Following their
closing rally here last night and the re
Â¦r.s to Colonel James J. Kiibourne.
Democratic candidate for Governor, and
the Democratic leaders to-day, the Demo
crats are claiming: that they will elect
part of their ticket in Hamilton County.
It is hardly possible that this will affect
thÂ« local legislative candidates, but it will
materially affect the State ticket if the
â¢Democrats should win part of the county
- here. The Republicans lost <_'uya
and Lucas counties two years ago.
Governor Nash had a plurality of
OJM. Although the result in Cleveland
untl Toledo is likely to be very close, yet
the renditions are not considered so de
liring as they were two years ago.
Tlif- Republicans concede that the result
is doubtful in Franklin County, in which
Capitol is located. The Dem
<->crats are confidently claiming that
â¢ â¢ounty. in which both Governor >Thsh
and Colonel Kiibourne reside. There is
opposition to Governor Nash on ac
inurit of his appointments, and It is as
d that the popularity of Colonel Kii
bourne. especially among the workine
men. will add strength to the Democrat*
â¢ in that county. The Republicans
<an lope both Cuyahoga and Franklin
<'.'untips and still have a majority in the
l^egislature for Senator if they carry
Hamilton and Lucas counties, as seems
most probable.
The election thi6 year is for a full State
â¢ â¢ and county tickets, as well as
members of the Legislature. During the
laet half of the century the Democrats
have ejected only four Governors and.
Â¦with a single exception, they were elected
in years following Presidential elections.
The Republicans have had uninterrupted
control of the State ever since the first
election of McKinley as Governor in 18P1,
and in that time they have controlled
rnorr- of the county and city offices than
in any previous period. They deny that
any so-called "off year" conditions exist
and claim to be in better condition for
ess thar for years.
The manrgers on both Bides are more
reluctant about giving out estimates than
usual. This is due to the uncertainty as
to the shortage in the vote on both sides.
i the Republicans say prevents them
predicting as closely as usual the extent
of their plurality.
The Question of local option has been
prominently agitated this campaign, but
Â¦with the brewers and liquor organizations
on one side and the Ohio Anti-Saloon
League on the other side, this issue is
considered a standoff between the leading
two parties. The only large city in which
this issue has figured is Columbus. It is
directed solely at members of the Legis
lature, and some of the leaguers have
been opposing Senator Forafcer's re-elec
tion by fighting candidates that would
support him.
FUSION FORCES BOASTFUL.
Declare They Will Defeat Republican
Ticket in Pennsylvania.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 3â The cam
paign just closed in Pennsylvania has at
tracted more than the ordinary off-year
interest in consequence of the fusion of
Democrats and Independent Republicans
on candidates for the only two State of
fices to be filledâ State Treasurer and Jus
tice of the Supreme Court. The Indepen
dent Republicans, organized under the
name of the Union party, joined with the
Democrats in the nomination of E. A.
Corey Jr. (Republican) for State Treas
urer, and Herman Terkes (Democrat) for
Supreme Court Justice, against the regu
lar Republican nominees, Frank Harris
for State Treasurer and William P. Pot
tf-r for Supreme Judge.
The fusion leaders are making strong
predictions that their candidates will
carry the State, while on the oiher hand
ihe regular Republican leaders express
confidence in bringing their candidates
safe'.y through, though passively conced
ing that the majority may be lowered
from that of two years ago, when Bar
nett (Republican) was elected Treasurer
by HO, OOO majority over Creaky (Demo
crat.).
The campaign in Philadelphia has been
unusually active, the interest centering in
ihe fipht for District Attorney. The regu
lar Republican?, backed by the city and
State administration forces and I'nite.j
.State? Senators Penrose and Quay, placed
in nomination John Weaver for District
Attorney, while the I'nion party and Mu
nicipal League named the incumbent. P
H. Rothermel. a Republican. A faction
of the Democratic party, however, refused
to Join the reformers and placed in regu
lar nomination William Wilkes Carr, a
STRICT BLOCKADE OF SAMAR PORTS
FAILS TO SHUT OUT FILIBUSTERS
Â¦
| Small Boats From the Island of Leyte Elude the Fleet of
American Gunboats and Land Supplies for Insurgent
Force That Still Refuses to Surrender to General Smith
Â« cw AXILA, Nov. 3.â The October re-
JiW/ll port of the insular treasurer
fW 11 shows that nearly $4,000,000 is
L V I\." available for appropriations.,
The financial condition of a ma
i jority of the provinces Is slowly' improv
| ing. ' Several of them have Â£ surpluses
Â¦ amounting to $10,000.
i Owing 10 high prices of all kinds of sup
plies here the Philippine Commission. has
i issued an order masting optional the pay
ment of laborers in rice or money in the
i poorer districts. Â¦ ' '--â¢
Fourteen warships are maintaining a
I very strict blockaae of the island of Sa
mar, but advices from Catbalogan, # Sa
mar. say it is well known that, in spite of
the fact that all ports of Samar are
closed, supplies still reach the insurgents.
Most of this work is done during dark
nights by small boats from the island of
i L.eyte. Every available gunboat Is now
1 trying to prevent this. The capture of
'â¢Â¦ Lukban's commissary has proved a great
; blow to the insurrection, as it renders fu
i ture supplies very precarious.
Conditions in the island of Leyte are
very annoying to General Smith. A large
number of junks are used with the ex
press object of aiding the insurgents in
fcSamar, covering the movements of fugi
tives and landing provisions and clothing.
Captain Spellman and Lieutenant Jones
of the Forty-third Regiment, who. were
convicted of Illicit trading and bribery,
have been sentenced to live and three
year.-' imprisonment, respectively. They
.have been brought to Manila en route to
l'ort I^eavenworth, where they will be im
prisoned. %
There was a public discussion before the
Philippine Commission to-day on the draft
of the act against treason and sedition.
Many prominent Filipinos were present.
Vice Governor Wright explained the ob
ject of the bill, saying that the Spanish
code was unsatisfactory. Said Mr.
Wright:
There are a number of people living in the
Philippines w,Jk>, so long as there is no punish
ment for treason, will take advantage of the
fact to flop the wheels of the .Insular govern
ment. It must net he overlooked that turbulent
spirits exibt in the pacified . provinces. The
masses of the people are Fusceptible to inflam
matory utterances and liable to be influenced
by scheming demaEosties. - It would be an inex
cusable weakness en the part of the commission
to allow people to be aroused to deeds of vio
lence who are gradually drifting to the pur
suits of reace.
The recent renewed attempts at Insurrection
on the island of Samar and in the province of
Batangas <Luzcn), and at a few other points,
due to. noisy Filipino agitators, has caused a
feeling of unrest in the minds of both Filipi
nos and Americans, and the effect of their con
tinuance would be to make impossible the very
things these agitators claim to most desire.
Such endeavors serve to recruit the ranks of
the insurgents and to. postpone the era. of good
feeling and fellowship which must come.
No excuse exists for secret political organi
zations. Their intent must be evil. No matter
what may have been the opinions of the Filipi
nos regarding the sovereignty of the American
Government, the fact remains that the Ameri
cans are here, and, moreover, here they intend
to stay. â¢ v .
The bill was then read in Spanish.
Sabella Reyes, a Spanish journalist, who
has been here for several weeks, said he
was opposed to the bill and objected gen- '
erally to the imposition of the death pen- I
alty for political crimes.. He suggested ]
that persons . committing the offenses I
against which the bill was aimed should I
be deported to the United States and de- I
clared that Italy and Portugal had en
acted the most reasonable existing laws
dealing with the matters under consider- I
ation.
' Proves to Be an Anarchist. '
Commissioner Worcester- asked him if
he considered the killing of King Hum
bert a political crime.
Senor Nothing political is crim
inal. â¢
Vice Governor Wright asked him if he
considered the killing cf President Me-
Kinley a criminal act.
Senor Reyesâ l have already made It
dear that there is no such thing as a po
litical crime.
The Commissioners indignantly ordered
him to take his seat.
Senor Buencamino, on behalf of the
Federal party, objected to the bill.
Senor Bautista. at one time President of
the so-called Filipino Congress, said that
sections of the proposed law had created
a panic in Manila: that ' Spain had no such |
law; that in his opinion private citizens
ought not to be compelled to divulge mat
ters within their knowledge; that the doc- I
trine of treason ought to apply to. offi- !
cials only, and that the bill as drawn of- I
fered a great opportunity to blackmail.
CHAFTEE'S LIST OF DEAD.
Additional Casualties in the Army in
the Philippines.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 2.â me latest
mail report received at the War Depart
ment from Gene-al Chaffee contained the
following list of deaths in the troops of
his command in addition to those made
public yesterday: â¢
Meningitisâ Larry Hall. Third Cavalry.
Tuberculosisâ Thomas M. Browning, Twen
Democrat and Postmaster of the city
during the Cleveland administration.
It is generally admitted that the real
battle at the polls on Tuesday will be be
tween the respective adherents of Weaver
and Rothermel. Many prominent Demo
crats, among them ex-Governor Robert
E. Pattison, have been active participants
in the campaign in the interest of Roth
ermel. The latter was elected in 1898 by
a majority of 73,500, but at that time had
the support of the regular Republican
forces now opposing his re-election.
BOTH CLAIM NEW JERSEY.
Republicans and Democrats Close a
Stubborn Campaign.
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â The gubernato
rial campaign in New Jersey was brought
to a close last night, vith the leaders oÂ£
both parties claiming victory for their re
spective candidates. It was one of the
most stubborn campaigns ever fought la
the State, the Republicans leaving no
stone unturned to hold the State machin
ery, which they have controlled for nearly
a decade, while the Democrats struggled
to take it from them. Both sides are to
night claiming victory.
The Republicans base their hopes on
two thingsâ first, the large majority which
must be wiped out by the opposition, and,
second, that they believe the voters of the
State, pleased at the prosperous condition
of affairs in the nation, will return a Re
publican Governor as an evidence of their
indorsement of the national administra
tion and as an assurance to the present
head of the administration that they have
confidence in him. It was principally on
the latter issue that the party made its
fight.
The Democrats claim victory on the
personal popularity of their candidate for
Governor, James M. Seymoyr. He is very
popular with the working classes and his
strength is acknowledged by his oppo
nents. He has thrice been elected Mayor
of Newark by large majorities.
Both State committees have compiled
tablee made up from reports from various
counties of the State. The Republicans
by their figures show that Franklin Mur
phy, their candidate for Governor, who i 3
also chairman of the committee, will be
elected by about 1000 majority. The tables
compiled by William E. Gourley, chair
man of the Democratic State Committee,
shows that Mayor Seymour will have
about 8000 majority.

Government Employes in Philippines
May Deal in Supplies.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â The Civil Ser
vice Commission has received word that
under an act jusl passed by the Philip
pine Commission all employes of the in
sular and provincial governments sta
tioned outside of the city of Manila will
receive commissary privileges. Commis
sary supplies will be sold them at an in
crease of 20 per cent of the actual cost, to
defray the transportation and necessary
expenses. The headquarters and disburs
ing stores will be located at Manila.
About t>ooo employes are benefited. This
action follows the general complaint of
school teachers sent to the Philippines
that Government assurances as to fur
nishing of supplies were not executed.
ITAVAX OFFICER IN DISGRACE.
Lieutenant Harlee to Be Punished for
Striking a Filipino Boy.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â Lieutenant
William C. Harlee, U. S. M. C., on a wharf
in Manila recently directed a Filipino boy
to take up and cjarry his gripsack. The
boy could not speak English, so did not
understand the order and moved off. The
lieutenant deemed this insolent and pro
ceeded to th.ra.3h the boy with his walk-
rality for the Republican ticket, and any
change from these figures would be
caused by nhe size of the total voteâ the
larger the total, the larger the Republican
plurality.
Frank Q. Stuart, secretary of the Demo
cratic State Committee, believes the Re
publican estimates are too large, but re
fuses to give any figures of his own. He
says that locally the Democrats have put
up in the various counties their strongest
men, and he believes this fact shouM
bring out nearly the full Democratic vote.
J. H. Campbell, chairman of the Prohi
bition State Committee, says he is satis
fled with the prospects for a large vote
for the Prohibition ticketâ the largest. In
fact, ever cast for that ticket in this
State. He estimates the minimum vote of
his party at 25,000.
LIGHT VOTE IN NEBRASKA.
Storm Responsible for Big Decrease in
the Registration.
LINCOLN. x\eb., Nov. 3.â Yesterday's
storm played havoc with the registration
,in this city, which shows a falling off of
more than 2000 compared with a year ago.
The same report comes from other large
towns in the State.
This is not encouraging to the Republi
cans, but as the same apathy is shown
in the city they assert they see no cause
for alarm. The only rally of importance
to-morrow will be at South Omaha, where
W. J. Bryan will make a number oÂ£
speeches at night.
At the two State headquarters the re
spective chairman said to-night they saw
no reason to change their estimates pre
viously made. Both committees predict
a light vote.

Urges Fast Mail Service to Orient.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â The annual
report of the Second Assistant Postmas
ter General, William S. Shallenberger,
made public to-day, urges regular direct
fast mail service between the PacinV
Coast and the Orient, the re-establish-,

ing stick. For this he was court-martial
ed, and the proceedlnes have just reach
ed Washington. The lieutenant was found
guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer
and gentleman. He is suspended from
duty for three months, with loss of half
pay, and is lo "be publicly reprimanded.
Admiral Remcy was not satisfied with
the sentence, which he declared to be en
tirely too lenient. In his indorsement he
regrets that the accused could sa far for
get one of the !i;-sl requisites of an officer
as to lose his self-control on a slight
provocation from an ignorant person.
Says Admiral Remcy:
In view of conditions existing In the islands
and the care that s-hould be exercised by all
persons of the United states service to sus
tain the consistency of the solicy of the Gov
; ernment in endeavorlnr to effect the paciflca
! tion of the Islands acceptably to the inhabi
tants, the convening authority deems the sen
tence awarded by the court as entirely too
lenient for the offenÃe. â¢ â¢ â¢ In view of
the court's own action, the award of the pub
lic reprimand to the accused would be mock
ery and but for the fact that the accused
Â¦would escape punishment altogether, the com
mander-ln-chiaf would disapprove the sentence.
COST OF NAVAL STATION.
! Proposed Philippine Island Plant Will
Require Many Millions.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 3.â The majority
report of the naval board, headed by Rear
Admiral Taylor, which has prepared plans
for the proposed new naval station at
Olongapo, P. 1., shows that the station
may cost this Government $19,359,500, ex
clusive of defensive works, signal stt
tlons, water supply, coaling station, mag
azines, hospital, encampment grounds and
a native village under the control of the
naval authorities, which it is proposed to
provide for the workmen who will be em
ployed regularly at the Olongapo dock
yards.
The board recommends that, in addition
to the four prominent points selected for
the defensive works by Admiral Remey's
boardâ Sllanguln Island, at the entrance
of Port Silanguin; the point on the west
side of the entrance to Subig Bay, Grande
Island at the midentraitce and Point Ilian
on the east side of Subig Bay entranceâ
another fort be located to protect the
landing in Calaguaquin Bay, on the west
coast of ZambeleÃ province, and that the
mountain paths leading to the naval res
ervation on the north and east be forti
fied. The board's estimate for equipping
the station for efficient work in repairing
and outfitting vessels, pending general de
velopment, is $12,903,500. . "
The report concludes with a statement
that much of the material for the sta
tion must come from the United States
though a good part of it can be obtained
at Hongkong. . â¢

NEW YORK, Nov. 3.â lrish-Americans
to the number of 3000 or 4000 from this city
and vicinity gathered to-night at a recep
tion given at Carnegie Hall in \ honor, of
John E. Redmond, M. P., leader of the
Irish Nationalist. party in the British Par
liament. The reception was given under
the auspices of the Amalgamated Irish
Societies in 1 Nfw York, the Irish National
Club and the Irish National League. The
boxes of the upper and lower tier were
occupied by the delegates of the various
Irish societies in this ;-'-.V>
. Redmond was accompanied by Patrick
McHugh and Thomas O'Donnell, his fel
low-delegates from the National Â¦ League.
William McAdoo, â¢ former assistant Secre
tary of the Navy, was chairman of the
evening and "introduced Redmond, who
said in part: Â¦Â¦'/:Â¦ Â¦
When I. last spoke her* Ireland wag torn by
dissensions.. She was divided, distracted and
weak. The great leader who had | banded - the
I: ish race- together all over tie world and had
brought the pause of Ireland to the very thresh
old of victory had -disappeared., the great move
ment which his genius had created had, been
wrecked, the hopes of the Â¦ Irish race had been
dashed to the ground and the enemies of- Ire
land were exultant, and. triumphant. To-night,
thank God, the situation is changed. It is .true,
unfortunately, that the grave cannot give up
its dead; it is true that there is no great politi
cal genius- to-day presiding over, the councils of
the Irish nation, but the Irish people themselves
have come together again. . : Â¦ â¢ "' â¢
â¢ My object in coming here 1?, in the first place,
to proclaim the unity of the Irish people at
home; secondly, to explain the policy which
these people at home have unanimously adopt
ed, and. finally, to say to the Irish. race In
America that if they approve of that policy
they ought to support It, but that whether
they support it or â whether the Irish peo
ple at home are left in- this "crisis of : their
country's history to carry on this struggle
against England without the aid of their breth
ren" throughout the world or not, we at home
are disciplined enough and -strong enough and
earnest enough to carry on this movement our
selves and at any cost we shall do so. a
Redmond said. that the policy, of the
United Irish League movement was to ad
vance the national cause of Irishmen by
making the government of Ireland by
England, in every department, both in
Parliament and out of Parliament, diffi
cult and dangerous," and finally impossible.
He paid it whs proposed to accomplish this
by means of the United' Irish League or
ganization, the lineal successor of the
Land League.
; AlcHugh and O'Donnell followed Red
mond in speaking and ! resolutions were
adopted Indorsing the policy of the league
and pledging the - support of the meeting

MANY SAFEGUARDS THROWN
AROUND DOWAGER EMPRESS
Chinese Officials Do Not Deny That an
Attempt Was Made to Assas
sinate Her.
PEKING, Nov. 3.â The Chinese officials
do not deny that an attempt was made to
assassinate the Dowager Empress shortly
before the court's arrival at Honan a few
days ago, but say they have received no
authentic official information. This state
ment Is regarded as confirmatory of the
report. The court is now in the region
of the allied villages society, the fear of
which caused the change of the imperial
route lying over the southern part of the
province of Chili. The effect of the at
tempt to murder her Majesty will be to
increase the safeguards surrounding 1 her.
It is reported that between 20.000 and 30,000
troops are attending the imperial party.

final report. This will be embodied In one
volume and will be submitted to Con

SINKS ALONGSIDE SHIP CALIFORNIA
Collides With the Schooner Anchored Over the Wreck of
the May Flint â James Coulton, the Fireman, Is Missing,
but Captain Richardson Says He Was Not Drowned
THERE was a narrow escape from
a terrible disaster on the bay Sat
urday nig-ht. As it is. the stern
wheel steamboat Phoenix Is at
the bottom of the bay and one of
her crew is missing.
The Phoenix came here from Eureka
p^rae weeks ago and was added to the
Piper-Aden, Goodall Company's fleet. She
has been towing rock barges to and from
Sherman Island for the contractor that is
filing in China Basin for the Santa Fe.
Sarurday night she started out from Mis-
Bajr with a barjro in tow, and Cap
tain Richardson thought he would have
no trouble in clearing all obstructions. In
stead, however., when the scene of the
May Flint wreck was reached the crew
Â«=tM- that the wrecking barge anchored
over the danger spot could not be cleared.
Ar. attempt was made to cut the Phoe
tow adrift, but it failed and the
steamboat went broadside onto the wreck- ;
ins schooner. She began to fill and James
Coulton, the fireman, is said to have :
jumped from her to the barge. He has
-en seen nor heard from since, and
ms ny of his friends were around the front
locking for him yesterday.
-oon as the Phoenix struck she be- ;
ga i to leak like a sieve, and in a few ;
minutes the inrushing water had drowned
ou" the fires under the boilers. Captain
Riohardson at once headed the vessel for
Htrrison-street wharf and notified the !
engineer to give her all steam. She- rush
ed along with everything wide open, and j
th<>re was just en .ugh steam left in her !
boilers to carry her up alongside the ship |
California. She struck the latter gently,
stsyed afloat long enough to give the crew
time to clamber aboard the ship and then
â¢went down. The chances are that she
wi 1 be raised to-day and taken to the Po
trero for repairs.
Captain Richardson said:
The accident was dup to the unusually strong
tiflf. WÂ« were carried down on the wrecking
schooner anchored over the remains of the May
Flint in spite of all that tteam could do. 1
<Jor"t think Coulton went down with the steam
er, as come one jumped aboard the barge I was
towing as soon ac we struck. The lookout yelled j
to me that one of my men was being left behind,
but I was too anxious to get alongside a wharf
to wait and pick him -up. The Phoenix is
pretty badly etove and will be laid up for sev
eral months undergoing repairs.
Newport Arrives From Panama.
*:"he Pacific Mail Company's Xewport
6r-ived from Panama and way ports yes
terday. She had a light passenger list
and small cargo. Among the latter was
$73,350 in treasure. Those who came up in
thÂ«r cabin were:
I>r. John H. Arton, Ester Hawley, Ade
la Hawley, Emma Schweniosky, Joee D.
Salaverrla. M. C Curtis, Mrs. Curtis,
Harry Curtis and Elmer Curtis. Besides
thise* she brought up two steerage pas

Hongkong.
Water Front Notes.
Four vessels of the Charles Nelson Com
pany's fleet had a race from Eureka
â¢which ended yesterday. They were all
lumber laden, and while two of them
made almost steamboat time, the other
two were away behind. The Ottillie Fjord
came down In forty-eight hours, while
the Laura Pike was only five hours be
hind her. The Guide and Mary Buhne
both took seventy-two hours to come
down. All four schooners will be sent
bÂ£.ck to Humboldt Bay and will have a
chance to see what they can do when in
ballast.
The German steamship Sesostrls pre
sented a peculiar spectacle yesterday. She
was discharging coal from one hatch and
receiving It in another. She was coaled
at. South America and the fuel Is no good.
It has, therefore, been taken out and
hard coal purchased here put in its place.

LONDON MARKET
SHOWS NO LIFE
Rise in Bank of England
Rates Fails to Im
prove Trade.
Berlin Boerse Remains in a
Sluggish and Depressed
Condition.
LONDON, Nev. 3.â Conditions on the
Stock Exchange last week may be fairly
described as moribund. Money was the
dormant factor. The long predicted rise
in the Bank of England rate came just
when many had ceased to expect it, but
it had little effect in the sluggish state
of trading. Most of the professionals who
had no business to -transact made the
! homecoming of the Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York a good excuse for pre
tending not to do business.
Consols continued to fall with the force
of habit. Any recurrence of the recent
! regrettable incidents in South Africa
would be likely to bring them to 91 or
lower. It is interesting to consider upon
what terms the government will be able
to place the next loan, which is surely
due before long. One expert has sug
gested 88 for Â£20,000,000, but the issue,
when it comes, will certainly be for a
much larger amount.
In the meanwhile experts are figuring
whether the rise in the bank rate will
check the now of British gold to Paris.
The general impression is that it will,
thus torcing New \'ork to liquidate its >
own indebtedness to Paris, which is be
lieved to be enormous by shipping Amer
ican gold. Some dissent from this view, I
however, maintaining that Wall street is
concealing several trump cards which it
will play when the game warrants. Chief
among these is the still unsolved North
ern Pacific puzzle. Lntil an authorita
tive announcement is made no one here
will be able to estimate how America's
continental borrowings compare with her
immense trade balance.
Thus speculation without the main
facts, though interesting, is useless.
BERLIN, Nov. 2.â The Boerse last
week showed the same pessimistic phy
siognomy displayed during several weeks
previous. "It is nearly a lifeless body,"
said the Vossiache Zeitung, "and no
longer able to respond to outside influ
ences."
Business has grown so stagnant that
many first class shares could not be
quoted at the lirst make up list on some
days. It is significant that an effort is
1 being made to close the boerse at 2
j p. m. daily, the usual hour of Saturday
I closing.
News from the various industries con
tinues unfavorable. A number of meet
ings of stockholders of coal and iron
| companies were held during the week
i and the opinion was expressed that the
depression had not reached low water
mark. In spite of the discouraging pros
pects, however, quotations were fairly
well maintained, speculators asserting
that the present quotations sufficiently
discount the situation. The only depart
ment which showed life was American
rails, Northern Pacific shares leading.
j Ocean transportation shares weakened I
I upon thje rumor of a war of rates and of
j a continued decline in the spring busi
i ness. It is asserted that the harbor of
Hamburg is full of idle vessels. W hile j
the week brought no news of Industrial |
disaster, the unhealthy condition of the '
; companies is still reflected by the dally
I publication in the Reichsanzeiger of the
| names of directors who have resigned
j from various companies.
The monthly settlement has passed !
( very easily, money being abundant and !
cheap. The advance in the rate of the i
Bank of England produced scarcely any
effect here, but the Frankfurter Zeitung
says that Germany sooner or later must
reconcile herself to r igher rates.
A complete cessation of gold imports
from London has occurred.
EUROPEAN SUGAR
ON THE DECLINE
Marked Falling Off in the
Imports to United
States.
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.â "The obvious !
and sustained friendliness of the United
States Government to Cuba, the impend
ing Increase of su^ar production in Porto
Rico, Hawaii arid the Philippines, added
to the steady and rapid development of
the beet-sugar industry throughout a
large area of the United States, all point
to an inevitable and definite decline in.
European sugar exports to our country."
This statement appears In an interesting
report from Consul General Mason at
Berlin to the State Department, dated
October 4, showing the damage which the
sugar production of Cuba in particular is !
dealing to the sugar exporters of Europe. I
"It is generally recognized," says Ma
son, "that the beet-sugar industry of Cen
tral Europe is approaching a critical junc
ture. Germany, -Austria-Hungary, France
and Russia, it is stated, are now gather
ing a beet crop which will yield an output
of sugar far surpassing In quantity that
of any previous year. Unfortunately for
Germany, this overwhelming production
comes at a time when industrial depres
sion and a short wheat and rye crop have
seriously reduced the purchasing capacity
of the poorer classes. A high commercial
authority estimates the decline in sugar
consumption In Germany during the fiscal
year at 7000 tons.
"To complete and still further darken
the shadow," says the Consul General,
"Cuba has reappeared as a vigorous and
threatening competitor in the United
States, which during the past five years
has taken an average of 283,000 metric
tons of German sugar, valued at $12,614,000
per annum."
These conditions, It Is stated, have sent
the price of sugar in the market at
Madgeburg down to the lowest point
reached during the critical year 1894-95.
Great interest has been awakened in
Germany by the recent visit to Washing
ton of Governor General Wood of Cuba,
and the conviction is growing that, not
withstanding all doubts Â£nd suspicions,
Cuba is really about to begin the career
of an independent State under the gener
ous and sympathetic protection of the
United States and under conditions w.i.cn
will favor the development of the sugar
industry of the island to a point beyond
the highest productiveness of former
years.
Visiting Bishops Conduct Services.'
CINCINNATI. Nov. 3.â The Methodist
pulpits of this city. Covington, Newport
an i other Kentucky towns were tilled to

final action taken on the reports and
other documents that have been sub
mitted to the various committees. The
conference of bishops will continue in
session until Wednesday.
Ship-Building Industry Grows.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. - The ship
building industry of the United States,
exclusive of the United States Navy
yards, according to a preliminary report
r i the Census Bureau, had a total Invent
ed capital of $76,699,651 In 1900.. This is an
increase of 181 per cent since 1890. The
value of products, including custom work
and repairing, was $73,444,753. an increase
of almost 93 per cent. There were 10S3
establishments and 40,121 wage earners
with total wages of $24,388,109, and miscel
laneous expenses of $3,582,257. The cost of
materials used was $33,031,280.

ON OLD-FASHIONED LINES.
FOR some weeks trade has been uniformly active
and featureless. It is .the same story, day
r.ftej day, of briskly moving merchandise, large
experts, Turn prices and general commercial content
ment throughout the land. Even Wall street, which
is the most sensitive spot in the country, has been
without a ripple, if the recent decline in the copper
stocks be excepted. The great staples have moved
along smoothly, passing from the farm^to the mer
chant, and thence to the consumer or to foreign
countries, without especial feature. The labor trou
bles have been left in the wake, and at the moment
the great commercial sea is as tranquil as a mill pond.
A glance at the country's bank clearings for the
past week tells the story. There was the usual
monotonous increase in the volume of trade over last
year, the gain being 25.3 per cent, not an important
city showing a decrease. The farlures were 172,
against 165 last year, and were mainly small and un
important. The iron and steel trade sent in the old
stereotyped reports of an active demand for struc
tural material, with the mills many months behind
their orders, and with new business being turned
down because it cannot be attended to with the
desired promptness. The manufacturers of footwear,
as intimated a fortnight ago, have been obliged to
make a small advance in their quotations, owing to
tlie higher prices for hides and leather, both of which
are active and firm. The textile mills are fully em
ployed, the woolen mills have all the orders they can
fill in the near future, and their purchases of raw
wool are keeping that product firm, the transactions
at Boston alone last week amounting to between
15,000,000 and 20,000,000 pounds.
If there be any distinctive feature to trade at the
moment it is the scarcity of cars, frequently men
tioned of late. This condition applies to all parts
of the United States and is hampering trade every
where. California is calling for cars to move its
grain, hay and fruit, and the coal regions of the East
are unable to meet the enormous domestic and large
) foreign demand for this fuel in cdnsequence of this
lack of transportation. The railroads are doing their
best, but cannot supply cars any faster than the
mills, rushed with all sorts of orders, can get the
material and build them. This condition shows the
general activity in trade throughout the country.
Were there sufficient cars to carry all the freight
offered, the business of the country would be phe
nomenal.
Another feature is the improvement in wheat and
corn, the latter leading in point of activity. The
Southwest is seriously short of this important staple,
and the shortage is effecting wheat and provisions.
The farmers in the Mississippi and Missouri valleys
are feeding large quantities of wheat to their stock
in lieu of the usual yellow staple, and provisions are
also feeling the effects of the shortage. Kansas is
buying corn in Missouri, and the latter State is
buying it in lowa, and much of the usual flow of
this grain to Chicago is being thus diverted to*the
Southwest. Germany is short 110,000,000 bushels of
wheat and* 37,000,000 bushels of rye, and France is
short of wheat, so between all these conditions the
grain market has been steadier than for some time,
though there is no excitement. There is plenty of
wheat in the world, apparently, for the English mar
kets decline to get excited over the current bullish
reports and fluctuate but little.
This is the general condition of trade, and it is
satisfactory. The major part of the world seems
to be carrying on business on old-fashioned lines,
without any more speculation than is necessary, with
plenty of money to meet its bills and with a fair
profit .on the goods. What more does it want?
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
UNDER the new charter there is no more im
portant office than that of the District At
torney,
He has exclusive charge of all the criminal courts.
Without his consent no complaint can issue for the
arrest of any one. This power in the hands of a weak
or dishonest man would be a most severe menace to
the peace and welfare of our city.
The administration of the incumbent. Mr, Lewis F.
Byington, has been honest r capable and successful.
He should be re-elected.

WHEN Herrin and Jerc Burke, the Democratic railroad bosses, undertook to
dictate a yellow dog Supervisor ticket to the so called Republican Conven
tion in this city they were aware they could not make their fight alone.
The corporations back of Herrin and Burke are powerful, but not suffi
ciently so to dominate the city. It was necessary to have allies. Those allies could, not
be found among decent Republicans, and consequently they were sought among that
class of people who are in favor of running a wide open town in the interests of gam
blers, poolroom touts and the patrons of side door saloons.
The candidates for Supervisor nominated by the ''convention at the dictation of these
bosses are pledged not only to grant specified favors tÂ£ the corporations, but to do
whatever Herrin commands. The activity in the campaign of Gunst, Goldberg, Sam
Rainey and Dan Burns is ample warning to the people of what will happen if the cor
poration ticket be elected. We shall have a renewal of all those disgraceful vices whose
suppressor! cost the city suoh a prolonged fight. The poolrooms will, once more he
open for the enticement and the ruin not of men only but of bo^s and even of girls.
We shall have new stories of embezzlements, robberies; defalcations, murders and sui
cides. Dan Burns and his gang do . not do politics either for their own health or for
the health of the city. They are. in it for coin, and, in view of the frequent results of
their methods of getting coin, we might say they are in it for blood.
When they set about selecting candidates for Supervisors the conspirators chose men
most of whom are utterly unknown to the city at large. They bound those men to
specific pledges before they gave the nomination. The character of the men is such
that Mr. Wells, the nominee for Mayor, has himself said that had he known what sort
of men were to be nominated for Supervisor he would not have accepted a place, on the
ticket. It is such a set of men as attracts the support of Sam Rainey from the Demo
cratic camp and of Dan Burns from the obscurity in which he had been living ever since
he was beaten for the Senate. ' .
It is not for nothing that Burns, Gunst, Goldberg and Rainey have rallied to the sup
port of the Burke and Herrin ticket. No intelligent man can be so credulous as to sup
pose these men have been brought together by a mere accident of politics. They are
well known predatory politicians. They are out for loot. They have a ticket of Super
visors pledged to <\o what they wish, and if that ticket be elected San Francisco will
be the prey of gamblers, touts, toughs and every class of men who not only fatten upon
the vices of society but breed vices in order that they may fatten upon them.
We have then to face in the first place a seti of rapacious corporations seeking to
obtain unfair profits from their dealings with the city, and in the second place a set of
gamblers seeking an opportunity to ply their nefarious trades openly where every way
farer may be subject to their enticements and their deadfalls. It is an issue of honesty
and morality against dishonesty and immorality. It is a contest between those who are
seeking to give San Francisco a good government and those who are seeking to subvert
the government to the uses of vice.
There is not one defense to be made for the Burke and Herrin ticket. The men who
compose it are personally unfit to make laws for the city. The pledges they have given
to the corporations are in violation of the first duty of an honest candidate. The class
of bosses whom they have called to their support rouse the suspicions of the intelligent,
and the manner in which they are making their canvass by evasions, dodges and subter
fuges confirms the suspicions and infuses the community with a moral certainty thajt if
elected they will open the treasury and the streets to the corporations, and the city to
Burns and Gunst.
Against that ticket, whose members were selected solely because the conspirators be
lieved that in this campaign "yellow dogs" could win. there is in the field a body of can
didates nearly every one of whom has served on the Board of Supervisors and has proven
himself faithful, efficient, careful of the public interests and indisputably honest. Not a
single scandal has arisen out of the proceedings of this Board of Supervisors. Mr. Wells
himself has borne testimony to their worth and to the value of their service. They are
bound to no corporations nor to any bosses. No disreputable man is active in their
behalf. All the bosses and the* boodlers are against them. They stand forth as the
champions of law and order and decency. Their record is at once their platform and their
guarantee. They merit the support of every Republican as well as that of every Inde
pendent and every Democrat. There is no use to talk about partisanship in an affair of
this kind. Where such Republicans as Burns, Gunst and Goldberg are combined with
such Democrats as Herrin, Burke and Rainey, it is time for good citizens to unite to
save the city from the vultures.
BIT Fi^B:FRETE]SrSB;
DEVELOPMENTS of the campaign have brought to light the fact that the so.
called "Union Labor" party with its candidate, E. E. Schmitz, is making the
campaign largely by false pretense. The very title of the party is deceptive,
since it implies that the party is representative of organized labor, whereas it
represents nothing of the kind. Many of the strongest labor unions in the city have
denounced it, repudiated and emphatically declared that it does not in any way stand for
union labor principles or for the welfare of organized labor.
The protests of genuine labor unionism against the political adventurers who are. try
ing to get votes under the name of union labor have not been spoken hesitatingly 01 in
a corner. On the contrary they have been proclaimed with the utmost vigor and given
the widest publicity Organized Labor, a journal published by tl?e labor unions of San
Francisco, said to the union workers in its issue of Saturday:
If you desire to vote prosperity away from San Francisco; if you desire to vote to disband your
unions; if you want to vote the money out of your own. pockets; if you like to vote the bread away from
your wife and childrenâ then vote the class ticket, the worst class ticket, the Union Labor party ticket
and you will have accomplished all these. Yes, more, you will have put a nail into the coffin of trades
unionism as far as San Francisco is concerned for the next ten years. * * * History is replete with
such examples. Take the bleeding State of Kansas under its Populist administration, or any other com
monwealth or community where a serai-class party secured control of the reins of government. The result
is always the same. Capital has %gone into hiding and labor is begging for employment. Do you want
such a condition in San Francisco? Do you want your unions torn to pieces, your wages reduced to $o 75
a' day and your hours of work increased to ten or twelve? If so, vote the Labor ticket! Vote
against your union! Vote to disband! Vote yourselves into the same condition as those who voted with
Denis Kearney, who are now working on the outskirts of the city for their board and 25 cents a day
while the sandlot agitator is a millionaire. Vote away your independence and self-respect. Vote away
the p-osperity of the cityâ but remember that Organized Labor, as a trade union paper, gave you the
warning!
That warning uttered by Organized Labor shows what the genuine union working
men of the city think of the effort that is now beinj; made under the name of "Union
Labor" to intrude class antagonisms into municipal politics and to involve tabor
unions in political controversies. Class antagonism in politics would retard the progress
of the city and seriously injure all lines of industry, while the introduction of politics into
the^ unions would inevitably result in disrupting them.
While the party itself is thus making false pretense in calling itself by the name and
title of union labor, the candidate for Mayor, Mr. Schmitz, is no better than his party.
Responsible union workingmen have charged him with playing double during the strike,
and of violating the principles of unionism in His dealings with non-union shops. The
charges have been supported by evidence which has been published in The Call, and they
remain unrefuted. Thus Mr. Schmitz no more than the. men who nominated him is a
representative of true unionism. He is the representative only of the disturbing ele
ments of the community. His election would encourage every demagogue, every agita
tor and every discontented blatherskite to at once set about trying to cause new strikes
new class antagonisms and new outbreaks of violence. ,
False as are the pretenses under which the Schmitz campaign has been conducted, it is
none the less formidable. It is sure that as soon a* the advocates of a wide open town
perceive that the defeat of Wells is certain, they will swing their vote for Schmitz
There is but one way to save San Francisco from the double danger menaces^
and that is for every good citizen, every genuine labor unionist, every taxpayer every
opponent of corporate corruption and of unlimited gambling to vote for Xobin and for
his Supervisor ticket.
Henry Watterson is reported to have assured the
temperance people that they will have no occasion to
complaiji of the use of wine at the White House
should he be elected President, so it looks as if Henry
had started his campaign in earnest and expects to
run on an anti- Bourbon platform.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI&, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1901.
The Judge who decided that a woman ought not
to be punished for swindling men who advertise for
wives evidently believes that all matrimony is some
thing of a swindle and that there ought not to be any
unfair distinctions as to the methods 6y which the
swindle is Worked.
GIRLS OF FLORODORA DOUBLE
SEXTET SELECT STUNNING GOWNS
IHAVE found out what the Doctor's Daug>ters* swell
"Florodora" double sextet girls are going to wear. The
whole thing is supposed to be a dead secret, but the girls,
naturally excited over fetching gowns, stunning hats, swell
shoes and "just the dearest boas In the world," got to tell
ing a few "nearest and .dearest" about Itâ and it came to my
ears. At first I was not going to divulge tho secret, and then
I realized how anxious the public was to know It and how very
anxious I was to tell it.
Well, the gowns are dreams. They are of white crepe,
made perfectly plain and clinging with a twelve-inch accordeon
pleated ruffle around the skirt, which is cut en train.. The
sleeves read, only to the elbows, and the corsage is finished off
with a "baby neck." The hats are, of course, the regulation
Florodora hatsâ all black and covered with nodding black
plumes. Long black gloves will be worn and dainty "colonial"
ties. The most fetching feature of the costumes, I think, is
the pink boas, with long streamers and big pink roses. All the
girls in the sextet are pretty. And with that costume onâ
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now that the girls have settled on their costumes, I under
stand that the men are passing through the same form of
troubleâ what to wear. The vexed problem with them Is, Shall
it be frock coats or Tuxedos and manilas or straw sailors or
silk hats? It lÂ« a mighty question to decide, and I know that
the "gentle strangers" are doing some pretty hard thinking.
In the meantime rehearsals are going on every day, and
Bothwcll Browne, who Is rehearsing the sextet, has taken to
drilling tho couples individually. Hard work and close atten
tion is the slogan these days, and there is not the slightest
doubt in my mind that the society amateurs will outshine the.
professionals who lately charmed us at the Columbia.
â¢ -. â¢ â¢
I understand that a surprise verse is to be sprung, by the
sextet. George Carr has "dropped Into poetry" and has reeled
off a verse that is witty, snappy and telling, and .which deals
out little love pats to the Bohemians who are to take part in
"The Billionaire."

INTERESTING FACTS RELATIVE TO THE GROWING
NAVIES OF THE GREAT POWERS OF THE WORLD
THE Russian battleship Retvizan, built at Cramps' yard,
is practically completed. The builders have not only
turned out a faster ship than the contract called for,
but they have also built 4t in better time than any other
contractor for similar vessels. The keel of the Retvlsan
was laid November 5, 1898; the launching took place October 23,
1900, and the steam trial October 23, 1901. The time in building
and completing this 12,700-ton battleship, Including delivery of
armor, guns and other requisites, was therefore a little less
than two years between the laying of the keel and the launch
ing, and exactly one year between launch and trial, making a
total of practically three years' time. The three battleships
Maine, Missouri and Ohio, building for the United States navy
at Cramps', Newt Drt News and the Union Iron Works, do not
show the same speed in construction. They were contracted
for in October, 1898, to be completed as follows during the pres
ent year: Maine, June 1; Ohio, June 5, and Missouri, August
30. The latter is still on the stocks, the Ohio was launched
May 18 last and the Maine July 27. On October 1 last the Maine
was 67 per cent advanced toward completion, the Missouri 45
per cent and the Ohio only 43 per cent. At this rate it is cal
culated that the Maine may be turned over to the Government
in October, 1962, and the other two ships ln ( February, 1908. That
is to say, they will be from fifteen to twenty months behind
their contract date of delivery. The chief cause for this delay
is due to the armor manufacturers, who tried to overreach the
Government, and consequent waste in time to bring them to
reasonable terms. There was no such trouble with the armor
for the Russian ship, nor v.-ere the contractors hampered with
the red tape interference by Government officials which greatly
retards building of vessels for the United States navy.
The Russian battleship Tsarevitch, 12,900 tons, building in
France, was contracted for simultaneously with the Retvizan
in the United States, but is still far from completion. .Her keel
was not laid until May, 1899, the launch took place February 23
last and her trial wIM not come off before July, next year.

Rear Admiral Crowninshleld, chief of the Bureau of Navi
gation, complains of the inadequate number of flag officers in
the United States navy, asserting that the inferior rank held
by commanders of our squadrons as compared with those of
other countries is prejudicial to the interests of our country.
He pleads .for more admirals, vice admirals and rear admirals,
and gives the following figues of foreign navies in support of
his argument:

Hlgginson, Evans and Taylor are carried as additional. Ad

mirals are at sea, while, fifteen are commandants at navy

POLL TAXâ Exempt, Cloverdale, Cal.

that the officials of Sonoma County col

vantageous to have a couple of vice admirals to represent our
navy properly abroad, Â»but the chief difficulty lies in selecting
such officers without running the risk of having the unsuccess

selected were "caitiffs" and cowards and altogether unworthy
of the honors bestowed upon them.

A serviceable class of gunboats, or sloops as they are de
nominated in England, Is building for the British navy. Four
have been contracted for and four are in course of construction
at the dockyards. They are of 980 tons displacement, 1400 horse
power and 13.25 knots speed, and carry a battery of six 4-inch
quick-firers and four 3- pounders. The Rinaldo. built by Lairds,
at a cost of $335,000, made 13% knots on her trial last month.
Four of these sloops are sheathed with wood and coppered,
which, in conjunction with their light draught, make this class
of vessels very serviceable in tropical seas and particularly
useful for navigation of rivers and shallow waters. It is the
type recommended by our Navy Department for service in the
Philippines and of which a number will undoubtedly be built
in the near future.

In France and Russia all mercantile ships are at the dis
posal of the Government in time of war. In Germany but
eighty steamers are subsidized for war purposes, and in Great
Britain forty-eight only are subject to Government use by vir
tue of* subsidies. France pays annually $1,160,000 in subsidy for
ship, construction and $2,440,000 on navigation. Neither England,
Germany, Russia nor the United States pays any ship-building
subsidy, and the . sums granted for navigation are $337,500 by
Germany, $1,639,475 by Russia, including the volunteer fleet, and
$330,000 by Great Britain, granted to the West India and Cana

THe harbor of Emden on the North Sea is being deepened
with a view of accommodating vessels of the greatest draught.
The outer harbor is to be dredged to a depth of 38 feet and the
inner harbor from the mouth of the river Ems will be 33 feet
deep for a distance of ten miles. The harbor is open through
out the year and will be serviceable for the largest steamers
and war vessels.

In the matter of coaling stations Russia is the most defi
cient of all' naval powers at the present time, as along the
ocean highway from St. Petersburg or Odessa to Port Arthur
she has not a single coal bunker. This important question is

looked for In the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian
Gulf.
The French torpedo-boat No. 124 was sunk last month in
collision with another torpedo-boat. No. 139, off the island of
Corsica. The bulkhead forward of the engine room gave way,

1890 and rated at 20 knots.

DRAMATIC SCENE
IN A CATHEDRAL
Excommunicated Catho
lic Priest Is Publicly
Humiliated.
He Refuses to Leave Sacred
Edifice and Service Is
Stopped.
CHICAGO. Nov. 3.â There was an. in
Â¦ tensely dramatic scene in Holy Name
Cathedral to-day, when in the presence of
fully 1000 parishioners Jeremiah J. Crow
ley, the excommunicated Roman Catholic
priest, was publicly humiliated by order
of the authorities of the church.
Father Crowley had entered the church
unobserved, passing up the center aisle,
; and had taken a seat almost under the
j pulpit.. Solemn high mass was being cele
brated at the time. When the presence
cf Father Crowley became known Rev.
Francis J. Barry, chancellor- of the arch
diocese of Chicago, was hurriedly sent
for. Upon'entering the cathedral he went
straight to the seat where the excommuni
cated clergyman was kneeling and or
dered him to leave the church. Father
Crowley refused to go, saying:
"Put me out if you dare."
The strain was intense, and one woman
in the congregation fainted. There was
no resort to force, however. Chancellor
Barry signaled to a man in the choir lott,
and the sound of the organ ceased and
the singing of the choir was hushed. The
priests in the altar stopped the solemn
service at the end of the "Gloria", and
walked to the benches and laid aside their
golden vestments. The altar boys marched
out of the sanctuary through a side door
and the priests, clad in their cassocka,
followed. The next moment the hundreds
of incandescent lights in the vaulted
arches were extinguished and the candle
lights on the altar were put out.
The strain was broken when Chancellor
Barry appeared in the pulpit and said:
"Owing to- the preserice in this sacred
edifice of an excommunicated priest the
solemn high mass has been suspended.
We will proceed with a low mass."
No sermon was delivered, however, and
the mass was a,t an end before the congre
gation was calm again. The parishioners
lingered around the cathedrar and
watched the deposed priest as he hurried
away. None spoke to him.
Sunday at Park and Beach.
Thousands of people visited the park
and ocean beach yesterday. It was long
after dark before the last of the crowd of
pleasure seekers returned home. Sutro
Baths were crowded during the day. Fol
lowing are the results of the aquatic con
tests:

to her own apartments and gave her such
treatment as was possible. Later Mrs.
Overton was removed to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where she was treat- !
ed by Dr, Morrison. Examination dls- |
closed the fact that not a single por
tion of her body had escaped the flames.

STAB CHINESE WOMAN
AS RESULT OF FEUD
Highbinders Assault Merchant's Wife
as She Is About to Enter
Her Home.
Leong Kee, the 18-year-old wife of
Chlng Kee, a merchant at 716 Dupont
street, was stabbed last night by some
unknown Chinese as she was about to en
ter her home at 822 Dupont street. She
had been visiting at the Chinese consulate
and had reached the second flight of
stairs when two Chinese wearing masks
stepped out of the hallway and one of
them plunged a dagger Into her right side
The woman screamed and the Chinese
fled, dropping the dagger in their flight.
The police were immediately notified and
a search- was made for the would-be as
sassins, but no trace of them could be
found. The wound is serious, but not
necessarily fatal.
The stabbing is believed to be the out
come of the murder of a member of the
Ching farrtily by a member of the Won?
family in Buck Oye's gambling place a
few nights ago. The members of the
Chlng family met last night with the Six
Companies and demanded the lives of five
members of the Won* family as a com
pensation for the death of the lookout.
Chlng Kee Is connected with the Wonjr
family, and this is supposed by the police
to be the first attempt In retaliation.
Police Officers Herllhy, Bonner and
Morton began a search for the woman's
assailants soon after the occurrence, but
were unable to find any 'trace of" them.

hospital banquet Boyle said:
"Realising my responsibility for such a
declaration, I assert that the city of LÂ»iv->
erpool does more business with the United
States than the rest of the world together.
I can say that I am not a bit nervous
over this outbreak of the plague in Liv
erpool, if I thought the situation serious
enough to require the quarantine of ves
sels from Liverpool at Ijnited States ports
I would recommend it, but thus far I
have not seen any such necessity."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â There were no
advices to-day to the Marine Hospital
Service from its representatives in Liver

GOES TO PRISON
Court-Martial Imposes
Heavy Sentence on
Naval Employe.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.â To be confined
one year in such place as the Secretary of
the Navy may direct tc do extra police
duty during that time; to lose all pay
except $2 a month for prison expenses and
the further sum of $30 to be paid him at
the expiration of this confinement, and to
be dishonorably discharged from the
service of the United States is the sen
tence imposed by court-martial upon John
W. Stoll, a third-class electrician of the
receiving ship Columbia, lying at the New
York navy-yard, for foul abuse of the late
President McKiiney.
On the date of the late President's death
Stoll in the company of a number of sail
ors is charged with having declared with
an obscene oath that the President
should have been shot long ago and to
have added other foul and profane ex
pressions of the same tenor. He was
arrested and tried by court-martial with
the result above announced on two
charges: First, conduct to the prejudice
of good order and discipline; second,
scandalous conduct tending to the de
struction of good morals.
Stoll made a vehement plea of inno
cence, declaring that his language re
ferred to the President's assassin, but the
evidence of the bystanders and the lan
guage Itself was regarded by the court as
completely establishing his guilt. He will
be confined in the prison ship Southery at
Norfolk. .

MAN OF MYSTERY
London's Indian "Prince"
Guest of a Hotel in
Montreal.
Arrives With Suite of Twenty-
Bight Persons, Includ
ing Dancing Girl.'
SpeelU Dispatch to Tht Ctll.
MONTREAL, Nov. 3.â Among the pas
sengers on the Elder-Dempster steam
ship Lake Simcoe, which arrived in this
port at 4 o'clock this afternoon, was a
mysterious person who styled himself
Prince Ranjit of Baluchistan. He was
accompanied by a dashing suite of twen
ty-eight persons, including a dancing girl,
whose special mission is to while away
the tedium of life. Who the stranger is
is a mystery. The India authorities have
issued an official notice that there is no
BUch Prince, but whether a real Prince or
an impostor he travels as a nabob. He
was the talk of London for several weeks,
during which Lime he stopped at one of
the swell hotels, where he had twenty
three rooms and spent money lavishly.
The mystery as to the man's identity re
mained untathomed and ia still as deep as
ever. He declines to see newspaper men
or even hold conversation with other
people, his only reply to questions being,
â¢ i am a Kin*?."
He is* a man of fine physique, dark
skinned and handsome. I'he fame of the
mysterious person bad preceded him, and
when the Lake Simcoe steamed Into port
this afternoon there was quite a crowd oÂ£
interested spectators on the wharf wait
ing to catch a glimpse of him. They were
doomed to disappointment. The Prince
remained secluded in his stateroom. It
was said he had spent nearly the whole
of the voyage in his room and suffered a
good deal from seasickness. He, however,
patronized a concert that was given on
board and contributed $300 to the collec
tion. His dancing girl was present and
gave a novel entertainment. During the
rest of the time he remained in his room,
where he had all his meals brought to him
by hia attendant.
The Prince and his suite, when most
of the crowd had dispersed, took carriages
and proceeded to the Windsor Hotel. Ha
intends to make a tour of the principal
points in the United States and Canada,
and will return to London in time to be
present at the King's coronation.

WASPS GARNER
DOUBLE-HEADER
Win Last Two Games
of the Series With
Sacramento.
Inglorious Defeat for the Sen
ators at Recreation
Park.
The Senators wound up the present se
ries at Recreation Park yesterday after
noon by suffering inglorious defeat at the
bands of the Wasps. The score was 16
to 8. Of these runs the victors rolled up
a total of nine in the fourth inning after
one man was out. For a time it seemed
the inning never would end. It was not
good baseball, but it was interesting to
watch. ,<
Five pitchers appeared in the box at
different times. Uncle Henry giving Krug,
Whalen and Iburg an airing, while Doyle
and Hoft'er represented the Senators.
The amiable Mr. Flood of Sacramento
was escorted off the field in the sensa
tional fourth inning by a policeman be
cause of his unnecessary objections to
Umpire Harper's judgment on balls and
strikes.
Krug picked out a ball that suited him
in the eighth and sent it sailing like a
ruraway balloon over the center field
fence for a home run. He was the first
batter uy.
The Wasps settled down to business in
the first inning, after losing two men.
Wilson singled; Hildebrand and Pabst
walked, filling the bases. Krug hit to
shortstop. Devereaux had to run to get
the ball and instead of catching it he
bumped it with his knee, sending it roll
ing toward right field. Before it could oe
fielded Wilson and Hildebrand scored and
Krug reached second. Shay followed with
a two-bagger to the left field fence, scor
ing Pabst and Krug. Riley new out, re
tiring the side.
In the fourth the Wasps landed on
Doyle for six hits, on which, as
sisted by errors, they scored nine
runs. Shay opened proceedings by
hitting safe. Reiily bunted and was
safe on the catcher's fumble. Gra
ham sacrificed, advancing the men to sec
ond and third. Nordyke's timely two
bagger sent them home safely. Wilson
singled, scoring Nordyke. Hildebrand hit
safely and Schwartz was hit by pitcher,
again filling the bases. Pabst hit the
center field fence. This, with a passed
ball by Stanley scored three men. Pabst
scored immediately afterward on Krug's
three-bagger. Shay walked and "Heine"
scored on a "double steal." Riley scored
Shay on an infield hit. Graham struck
out and Wilson was out at first. This
ended what gave promise of becoming a
continuous performance.
"Jimmy the Whale" surprised every
body by lining the ball out along the
right field foul line in the sixth, scoring
Shay and Reiily. The batter was out try
ing to make third on the play. Krug's
home run in the eighth ended the Wasp's
run getting.

three men in the seventh. It was only a
flash and ended with that. They had pre

Wasps Win Handily.
The "Wasps had no difficulty account*
ing for the morning game by a score of

a three-bagger. Nordyke ran Into the
fence in catching it and was knocked

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1901.
GUS RUHLIN, THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE TRAINING CAMP AT BLANKEN'S SIX-MILE HOUSE. AND
TWO MEN WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HIS TRAINING, ONE KEEPING HIM IN EXERCISE, THE OTHER
SUPPLYING MUSCLE PRODUCING FOOD IN LIBERAL QUANTITIES.
"Billy" Delaney May Insist on Jeffries Remaining at Harbin
Springs Until the Day Before the Fight.
VISITORS 1 day was observed
strictly yesterday at the train
ing quarters of Gus Ruhlln. From
early morning the road leading
â¢ to Blanken's was dotted with pe
destrians of sporting proclivities eager to
see for themselves the condition of the
man who aspires to be champion of the
wprld.
Ruhlin, in accordance with a life-long
custom, attended church in the morning.
He walked from Blanken's to All Hal
lows' Church, South San Francisco, and
after services strolled leisurely back over
the long road.
The one important incident of the day
was the trying on of the gloves which
Gus will wear in his battle with the
champion. Sol Levinson. the glove
maker, arrived at the training quarters
shortly after noon with a pair of 1 fighting
gloves which he had made especially for
the big fellow. Levinson had taken Ruh
lin's hand measurements earlier in the
week and the gloves which he produced
yesterday fitted the Akron fighter's hands
to a nicety. Gus tried on the gloves, as
sumed a fighting attitude and gripped
them thoroughly before expressing satis
faction. He took them off and examined
them carefully for flaws but found none.
"They're just my size," said Gus, as he
gave them a parting squeeze and handed

them to Levinson. According to mutual
agreement the gloves will be placed in
charge of Referee Harry Corbett, who
will see that nobody tampers with them
before the fight.
Jeff's gloves were sent to his training
quarters for fit and inspection Saturday.
If they are satisfactory, one of Jeffs
trusted followers will be delegated to
place them in the hands of Harry Cor
bett. Gloves may be easily tampered
with before a tight, and for this reason
the referee will be Instructed to keep an
unusually watchful eye upon them.
There have been several incidents in the
history of prize fighting where gloves
have been so weakened by removing the
stitching that they would break and new
gloves would be substituted. In the ex
citement the substitutes would not be
carefully inspected and gross injustice
and frauds were perpetrated. Neither the
principals in the coming fight fror their
managers would stoop to such practices,
but if outsiders were allowed to handle
the gloves some question of fraud might
be raised.
As both contestants have agreed to
wear no bandages of any kind on their
hands the gloves were made snug and
close-fitting. They are the regulation five
ounce glovts. with no finger holes in the
point. A tough ridge of leather running
across the point of the gloves is used as
a substitute for finger holes. This allows
the fingers free play and the blood free
circulation, thus obviating the danger of
cramps.

After the glovemaker finished with Ruh
lin the big fellow settled down to enjoy
his day of rest. He lounged about the
veranda of the training quarters ami
chatted with his trainers, Manager
"Billy" Madden and visitors. He talked
everything but tight and showed a dis
position to discourage any conversation
that had any bearing on the subject of
training or lighting. Gus has been at
Blanken's nearly nine weeks.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Nov. 3.-Jeffries
rested to-day. His trainers were glad, for
they were very tired from Saturday's
work. On Saturday night Jeffries put
them through a course of sprouts that
took all the curl out of their hair. The
champion worked in the gymnasium at a
fast clip. In the morning he boxe.i,
punched the bag, skipped the rope, played
four games of handbail with The Call rep
resentative, handled the medicine ball and
worked on the rowing machine. In thu
afternoon he took a ten-mile jaunt on the
road.
Billy Delaney, the famous trainer, who
is looking after the big fellow, returned
from the city yesterday. He has been ab
sent four days arranging terms for the
kinetoscope rights for the big fight. The
champion missed his trainer and was glad
to see him back. From now on Delaney
will devote his attention exclusively to
Jeffries' work. He is unwilling to let the
big fellow go to the city on Friday night.
He is afraid the change of air and diet
will make him stale. It begins to look
now as if the champion would stay at
Harbin until the day before the big battle.
Passed ballâ Lobman. Time of gameâ Two

showed even better form in this go ami
defeated the Futurity runner-up without
allowing him to score.

Venerable Head^ of the Re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONDA, Sept. 30, via New York, Nov.
3.â Dr. Manuel Antonio Sanclemente, the
venerable President of the republic of Co
lombia, has been kidnaped by orders of
political leaders, who had already
stripped him of power. Locked in a
guardo a miserable parody on a sedan
chair in which courtiers once took their
ease, he is being hurried over rough
mountain roads from his home in Villeta.
department cf Cundlnamarca, to his beau
4<ful hacienda known as Pichihiat, in the
"partment of Cauca. He must be ea~
i^d through the very heart of two great
of the Andes, passing Honda,
-anizales, Cartago, Tulua and Buga,
twns which gave him ovations while h-.e
executive power. The greatest
has been observed and every ef

p ies of the deposed President might at

iblic to-day would dare to print the bare
*:t that Sanclemente had lett Villeta,
Hch less that he waa a prisoner.
Firm in His Attitude.
'he only charge that can be made
Mnst Sanclemente Is that while he re-
VLaeii at Villeta he was a constant men
* to these in control of the government
Hbogota. He had never varied in hir.
1 Hion since the day when he was rele
Â£ed to the background and the Vice
wident assumed executive powerâ July
&190). He maintained that this action
h been unconstitutional and that the
lVers of the Presidency could no more
fclahen from him than the title of Pres
int. Ministers representing foreign
aernments, after long refusing to rec
tfize Jose Manuel Marroquin as execu
zx lead of the nation, gave in and left

Âear the President, as well as to escape
the boon; rigorous climate of the canita!.
suddenly forsook it, knowing that the ex
isting complications rendered casual com
munications with Sanclemente dangerous.
It had been assumed by those who man
aged the coup of July, 1900, that Sancle
mente's chagrin at his loss of power would
Itrad him to leave the neighborhood of Bo
gota. The old gentleman merely stood his
ground, continuing to regard himself as
President and awaiting the moment when
he would be recalled to authority. Those
about him insist that he took no steps
against Vice President Marroquin' s gov
ernment and that he scorned any form of
count erplot.
Rebels Are Still Active.
The plea on which power had been taken
from him was that he was superannuated
and unable longer to discharge the duties
of his office. Dr. Marroquin, upon whom
the executive power was conferred, is in
appearance very nearly as old.
The revolution begain in October, 1899,
and lasted nine months. While Sancle
mente was President de facto his troops
had destroyed the Liberal armies, but
there were grave complaints because the
country had not been entirely pacified.
Dr. Marroquin has had charge for nearly
fifteen months and no apparent progress
has b=en made. Armed bands still roam
through the interior and the skirmishes
that occur daily tend merely to demon
strate the vitality of the rebels. Bulletins
are posted daily on the walls of Bogota
and republished in little newspapers, an
nouncing great victories for the Govern
ment, here, there and everywhere.

NATIVES SAVE
LOST MARINER
Sole Survivor of Halcyon
Tells Story of Suf
fering.
Long Journey in the Frozen
Wilds Nearly Ends in
Tragedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 3.â A thrilling
tale of suffering and rescue in the nick
of time is told by Captain Tuttle of the
revenue cutter Bear, which is to sail for
San Francisco via Comox, B. C. It con
cerns William Egan, sole survivor of the
schooner Halcyon, which sailed from
Nome last November.
Off Sledge Island the Halcyon was
caught in an ice field which drifted
northward until January 8 last, when
land was sighted forty miles away. By
this time the entire crew had died except
Captain Thomas and Egan. They started
for land, but Captain Thomas gave out
and tried to return to his imprisoned
vessel. He has never since been heard
of. Egan concluded that the land signted
was St. Lawrence Island and started for
an Indian village on its further shore.
Eg^an's provisions quickly gave out and
he was reduced almost to the verse of
starvation: He stumbled on a cacne of
walrus heads, and although they had
rotted and froze he chopped them with
his knife and gladly devoured them.
Struggling onward he came to the wreck
of a schooner vrnich proved to be the
Ecarett, which was lost in November,
1900, all of her crew starving to death
except two men, one of whom died from
the effects of trfe privations he had en
dured.
Egan discovered another cache of rotten
walrus meat and also devoured this.
Then, overcome by the cold and suffer
ing, he gave up and lay down to sleep. |
The next thing he knew he was j
being aroused by natives shaking '
him and attempting to question
him. Although he was unable to
answer, the natives placed him on a
pledge and carried him to the Northwest
Cape missionary village of Gamble, where
Dr. - Lerrigo attended him. Both !
hands and both feet were frozfn, but
under Dr. Lerrigo's treatment Egan es
caped with the loss of only a couple of
f ngers and is now employed as a herder
at the Government Reindeer Station. The
cutter Bear reached the station August 2
last and there Captain Tuttle heard
Egan's story.
CELEBKATES EASTER AT
THE HOLY SEPTJXCHER
Rev. Father Caraher Vividly De
scribes Scenes at the Tomb of
the Savior.
"Easter at the Holy Sepulcher" was the
subject of a lecture delivered by Rev.
Father Terrence Caraher at St. Francis
Church last night. The lecture was a ret
rospect of a mass celebrated by the lec
turer in the chapel surrounding the sacre<l
tomb of the Holy Savior in Palestine dur
ing a sojourn in the Holy Lantt. Father
Caraher said that it was his privilege last
Easter to officiate at mass, together with
three other priests, who had been accord
ed a like honor. His descriptions of the
scenes and incidents in connection with
an event which he said was one of the
happiest in his life were vivid and inter
ested a large congregation.
"Many had sought the privilege to say
mass before our Lord's tomb," said
Father Caraher, "and 1 had the distin
guished honor of representing the Eng
lish-speaklng public at the imposing cere
mony. St. HeleÂ« was the first to locate
the tomb of Jesus Christ, and she it was
who erected the first church over the very
spot where his remains were interred.
Other tombs may surpass the holy sepul
cher in grandeur, but it far surpasses them
all in the veneration and respect in which
it is held by almost everybody on the face
of the globe. It is the most sacred spot in
all creation. It is the pivot on which the I
religious world revolves, for it is the |
fountain from which Christianity springs
forth. I was much Impressed with thi I
solemnity of the occasion when I read the j
mass, and the uppermost thought in my
mind was the wonderful resurrection of j
the Redeemer after he had lain in his
tomb for three days."
Columbia Club Scores.
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club had I
good weather conditions for its shootyes- I
terday. Ed Hovey did phenomenal snoot- i
ing with a 32-20 repeating rifle, making a j
run of thirteen consecutive shots in the j
8-inch bullseye and 97 out of a possible 100 j
in twenty shots, Creedmoor count. He
led in the military and repeating rifle
match, though Young pressed him hard,
making with his Sharp's military rifle 45M
in 100 shots, and scoring 233 out of 250 in
a trial for the 50-shot record, Creedmoor
count. The record is 236, made by Ed
Hovey with the game rifle several years
ago. W. G. Hoffmann led in the 22-cali- j

Navigation on the Yukon
Now Ended for the'
Winter.
Preparation at Dawson for
Travel Over Frozen
Trails.
PORT TOWNSBND, Wash., Nov. 3.â
The steamer Dirigo, arriving from Skag
uay this evening, brought 100 passengers
and 700 tons of canned salmon. Advices
brought by the Dirigo are to the e*ffect
that navigation is practically at an end
on the Yukon. On October 27 cake Ice
was running out of Pelly River into the
Yukon and slush ice was running at
Dawson, and the river was daily ex
pected to close.
Great preparations are being made at
Dawson and during the winter there will
be strong competition for over-ice travel.
An opposition stage line will be put on.
A large number of men are working on
roads and trails and when the river
freezes everything will be in readiness
for sledges.
The revenue cutter Rush, with Goyer
i or Brady and the Rev. Sheldon Jackson
on board, is cruising in the vicinity of
Wrangel, visiting the various Indian Vil
lages.
The Dirigo reports Southeastern Alaska
as being swept with a severe wind storm
and that she had a rough voyage down.

Henry Huot, who says he is a carpenter,
was arrested early yesterday morning by
Policeman Eskew and booked at the City

stealing a purse containing $4 10 and a

'TIS PRINCIPLE,
NOT POLITICS
So Says Business Agent
Mullen About th 9
Labor War.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 3.
Business Agent' J. H. Mullen of the
Building Trades Council says the contro
versy that has split the organization he
represents is not a one-man proposition
and denies that he Js the bone of conten
tion for the two factions that are waglnsj
war within the ranks of unionism. Ho
asserts that it is a principle he and his
friends are fighting for, and that they
stand between the opposing faction and
the utter destruction of the Building
Trades Council and its affiliated organiza
tions. Mr. Mullen explains as follows:
The faction of the Building Trades Council
opposed to us is claiming that all this trouble
is due to the fact that J. H. Mullen is busi
ness agent. That, I declare, is not so, an.l
I deny it because I am in a position to know
that I cut a very small figure in this contro
versy. I would like to ask these- people who
are responsible for this disrupted Council why
it is that a few months ago they made a de
liberate attempt to destroy the usefulness of
the Building Trades Council. They certainly
cannot claim that Mullen had anything to do
with that attempt lam prepared to back up
what I say with proof and coin, and I offer
to put up .*!GO against $50 that I can establish
to the satisfaction of an unbiased set of judges'
that what I s-ay is true. I will show where
they struck at the constitution of the organi
zation and defied it on two or three occasions.
The present controversy Is the result of dis
satisfaction among three of the unions with
the apportionment of delegates to the Council,
that Is, they claim it is, but it appears to
be- the old fight over again. When the San
Francisco Building Trades Council settled our
difficulties a while ago it was unanimously
agreed by all the unions that they should with
draw their old delegates and elect new. ln
stenÂ£ of choosing new delegates, however, the
unions re-eiected the old, with the result that
the fight is renewed. Now they are kicking
over the traces on this trumped-up cry of dis
proportion, and for no other reason than to
kick up a row.
Three of the unionsâ the carpenters, the paint
ers and the longshoremenâ have withdrawn
their delegates from the Council, but as I
have not been officially notified of this action
by the unions I. as business agent, have not
taken any action in the matter as yet. I don't
know what I will do until I receive the official
notification. I do know, however, that they
cannot organize another Council in this county.
Our contracts with the employers will be kept,
no matter how the controversy turns out, and
they will be fully protected.

moment serving a warrant upon Tanabe

cisco by the Japanese editor. Tanabe
gave an interview In a Japanese paper

warrant for libel.
BOILERS BLOW
UP AND WRECK
POWER HOUSE
Big Explosion in Works
of Oakland Transit
Company.
Elmhurst Is Saved From Ruin
by Fire With Great
Difficulty.
Workman Is Hurled Across the Street
a Distance of Fifty Feet, but
Escapes With Minor
Injuries.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
118 Broadway, Nov 3. j
The boilers In the power-house of the j
Oakland, San Leandro and liaywards di- i
vision of the Oakland Transit Company's j
system at Elmhurst blew up to-night, |
wrecking the power-house and setting the ;
town on fire. Aid from Oakland was
sought, and had it not been for the Oak
land Fire Department and the most ener
getic work the entire town would have
been destroyed.
Buildings in the neighborhood of the
power-house were injured and wires, ma- â¢
chinery, rails, bricks and woodwork were j
blown through the walls of adjoining
buildings, the wreckage covering blocks j
around. The electric road was tied up for .
nearly three hours and people were com- i
polled to walk from San Leandro into !
Oakland in order to reach home. i
In the midst of all this only two men !
were injuced and those not severely, j
though the fireman, Michael Victor, was i
blown across the street, a distance of lifty j
feet, into another building.
The explosion occurred at 7:25 o'clock, j
and shook the surrounding country. It;
was felt in Oakland, and many believed
It was an earthquake. In San Loandro, a
mile distant, buildings were shaken in a
lively and alarming manner.
The Cause Is a Mystery.
Whatever the cause, it has done fully j
$10,000 worth of damage to the plant of ;
the electric road and a considerable
amount to buildings in the neignoorhood.
Two of the three boilers in the engine
room exploded. One of the boilers bÂ»ew
up and the concussien exploded the sec- !
ond. The explosions were practically i
simultaneous. ;
The eautern and southern walls of the j
power house were blown out, the explo
sion spending itself in that direction. Thij
wall between the engine room and the
fire room was blown out. .One of the
engines was badly damaged, but the othor
three are intact. The explosion shut off
all the power, breaking the engine and
dynamo connections and wires.
Everything was thrown into darkness,
for practically all of the light in the i
neighborhood came from the ruined pow- [
er-house. Debris was piled in all direc- j
tions, and for a while no one seemed to ;
know what had happened. Men were j
groping about in the darkness and wreck- j
age, amid fallen bricks and tangled wirea, !
some trying to reach the scene of the ex- '
plosion and some trying to get away.
Superintendent Mci.enegan of this di- j
vision happened to be in town at the ;
time and immediately took charge of !
affairs. He went right to work to get
things in some kind of shape so that the i
cars could be run. The wires were all '
down around the power-house and the i
uemolition of the power-house shut off
ail electricity, so that not only the Hay
wards line, but all of the East Oakland !
lines were stopped, they receiving power j
from the Elmhurst station. i
There were hundreds of passengers who '
had gone to Hay wards and San .Leandro j
who suddenly found themselves unable 'Â¦
to reach the city, and it was to accom- j
modate these that Mr. McLenegan bent :
his energies. In less than three hours he 'â¢
had got his wires up, had secured power |
from the Bay Counties Power Company i
and set the cars in motion.
While this was going on the people of i
Elmhurst found themselves facing an- Â¦
other danger. The Willows Hotel, across !
the street from the power-house, caught ;
fire from the hot coal that was blown j
against the wooden walls of the building.
It was this fire that necessitated a call .
for the Oakland fire department.
Fireman Hurled Across Street.
John Allanson, the engineer in charge,
was in the fireroom at the time the explo- j
sion occurred, together with Fireman I
Michael Victor and Cotflpasser Nlcolaison. j
Allanson and Nicolalson were unlnjr;ed. Â¦
Victor was blown out of the flreroonv and
across the street, fully fifty feet. Victor
was bruised and cut, but had no bones .
broken, while Billy Faught, a machinist, |
had his leg broken.
Dr. Tormey of San Leandro was sent Â¦
for and the Injured men put under his '
care. John Allanson, the engineer, says !
that he has no idea how the explosion .
occurred, that everything was in good '>
condition and ten minutes before the ex- |
plosion occurred the boilers were full of j
water. :
Superintendent McLenegan says that he !
is at a loss for an explanation, but that :
he will make a careful inspection of the '
wTecked boilers to-morrow, which may re- ;
veal something.
Gray's drug store, in which the Elm- j
hurst postofflce was also located, was
pretty badly wrecked by the explosion, :
but Courant's Hotel, on an opposite cor- '
ncr and nearer the power house, escaped !
injury. A heavy steel rail was |
blown out of the power house and overÂ«a i
car that was standing on the track and t
into the barber shop of the Willows Hotel.
The car was filled with passengers at the ;
time and had the flight of the rail b<Â»en '
shorter death and injury would have fol
lowed. __^__________

Our Growing Trade.
In 1891 the United States occupied fourth
place In the import trade of Germany
with a total of $108,528,000, being preceded
by Great Britain, with 1160,888,000: Austria-
Hungary, with $142,324,000. and Russia
with $138,040,000. In 1895 the imports Into
Germany from the United States rose to
$121,618,000. and after that year Increased
rapidly, until in 1900, when they reached
the sum of $206,750,400.
The United States thus stands far above
any other country in this trade, being fol
lowed by Great Britain, with $199,930,000"
Russia, with $173,740,000; Austria with
$172,312,000. and France, with $72.00.00?
During this period American imports Into
Germany have increased more than those

BERKELEY ELEVEN
IS NOT SELECTED
Coaches Still Trying Men
for Various Posi
tions.
BERKELEY, Nov. 3.â Two days' com- I
plete rest â yesterday and to-day â have
been given California's football squad.
The men were sorely in need of It, for
the weeks of practice had exhausted
them and old bruises and strains needed
care in the shape of complete rest on the
part of the players. Absence . of violent
activity has been of great benefit to the
men even after so short a time, and they
will eater upon the closing week's prac
tice refreshed in body and mind. The
team will remain in town and not spend
th>: last week away aa is sometimes done.
During the next five days the finishing
touches of the season's work will be
added. On Monday, Tuesday and Wed
nesday afternoons hard practice in the
shape of line-ups against the second
eleven will be held. Tnis will be the last
chance the coacjbe* will have to correct
faults on the Held. Besides serving as
days for final instruction, the closing
ht^avy practice will decide the line-up of
the team. On Thursday and Friday there
will be no line-up, but the men will run
through the plays and perfect themselves
in the secret signals. The work will be |
especially light on Friday â just enough
to keep the men on edge tor the struggle
with btantord the day following-.
All of the men who will represent Cali
fornia have not been definitely picked by
Coaches Simpson and Hopper. It will be
with difficulty that some of the closely
contested places are decided. Quarter is
still (.pen, wiih More and Hudson mak
ing a close run for it. At left end Dibblee,
who is recovering rapidly from his
wrenched knee, and Starr are opposed to
each other, and at right half Whipple and
Sherman. There is a possibility that
Womble will be shifted from right end to
right halt. In this case Hudson will go
to right end. leaving More at quarter, ami
Whipple and Sherman will be put en the
substitute list. Left guard Is far from
nettled. Stow'a play there has not been
satisfactory, in spite of past experience
on the varsity. Stroud, a strong, heavy
freshman, is being tried out for the piace
and will probably make it, as he is com
ing up rapidly. Duden is recovering from
numerous injuries and he will be in at
fullback to-morrow.
The men from whom the team will be
picked and the positions they will play
are as follows:
Gendotti, center; Overall, right gufrd;
Stroud or Stow, left guard; Braly or Han
sen, right tackle; Albertson, left tackle;
Womble or Hudson, right end; Starr or
Dibble-*, left erÂ«1 ; Hudson or More, quar
ter; Whipple. Sherman or Womble, right '
half: Duden. full; Mini, left half.

GERMANS SPEND
A MERRY NIGHT
Verein Eintracht Throws
Its Doors Wide
Open.
Places Renovated Building
at the Disposal of
Guests.
Vereln Eintracht l.all, fresh from the
hands of the carpenters, decorators and
oth^r busy people, was. reopened last
night with an entertainment and dance.
More than a third of a century has passe.i
since the Verein Eintract was organized,
and the celebration of the thirty-fourth
anniversary was the occasion selected for
the reopening.
Streamers of vari-colored hues were
strung along the balcony rails, garlands
of evergreens depended from the central
chandelier and lows of electric lights ac
centuated the outlines of the ceiling. Tho
result was extremely picturesque. Then
the ladles of the society, flitting from one
end of the hall to the other, radiant in
their tasteful combinations of color, add
ed to the effect.
After an inspection of the refurbished
building the singing section of the verein
opened the evening's entertainment witn
a song of welcome. A tableau, in whica.
participated representatives of all the
sections of the verein, followed. Presi
dent John Hermann delivered a brief ad
dress, in which he told the history of the
organization and predicted a great futura
for it. An am.ising pantomime, entitled
"The White Statue," followed. The cast
was as follows:
Scbultz, an old farmer Gus Audlbert
Marguerite, his daughter Robert Martin
Humpty-Dumpty, a servant C. EUenberger
Antone, the lover and "white statue"
B. Kaulfuss
Sculptor W. Heineke
Mama Gurken, in love with the servant
A. Freund
Jocko, the monkey.. George Martin
As soon as the floor could be cleared
the orchestra played the grand march,
later breaking into a waltz, and dancing
was then the order for the remainder o'
the evening. The committees in charge
of this most successful entertainment
were as follows:
Arrangementsâ Ad. "Winner, John Loeffler
and W. Scheppler.
Receptionâ August Klein, Carl yon Hartwig
and Robert Scheel.
Floqrâ Manager, C. EUenberger; assistantsâ
A. Freund 'and Louis Scheppler; John Hart
znanshen, Chris Goldzene and Gus Audlbert.
At largeâ X. Suehrstedt, L. Scheib, J. Dus

AGED MAN MAKES
A BRAVE RESCUE
Carries Helpless Woman
From Burning House
to Safety.
Others Barely Escape From
Fire at Powell and Val
lejo Streets.
Several pÂ«ople narrowly escaped death
in a fire that destroyed a building near
the corner of Powell and Vallejo streets
early last evening. AJthougrh the hour
was early some of the occupants had re
tired and were not awakened until the
flames were almost upon them and people
had rushed in from the street. Two aged
people â a man and a woman â were almost
suffocated by the smoke, but succeeded in
making their escape.
The tire was discovered shortly after 7
o'clock in the rear of a building at 1510
Powell street. The upper portion of this
structure was occupied by C. Gianettoni,
his wife and three small children. Mrs.
Gianettoni had gone to church, leaving
her husband and the little ones in bed.
When the blaze started the man and
children were asleep and were awakened
just in time to reach the street in safety.
Another apartment of the house was oc
cupied by Bernard Schussler and wife.
Both are aged people. Henry Koster,
about 80 years of age and a veteran of the
Mexican war, was visiting the couple.
Schussler had gone across the street and
before he returned the alarm was sound
ed. Dense volumes of smoke pouring in
to the room gave the first warning to
Mrs. Schussler and Koster. The lady is
a. cripple and was unable to make her
way to the street. Koster. despite his
age, picked her up and carried her to a
place of safety. As the pair emerged
from the burning building Koster was
cheered by the spectators.
Another apartment was occupied by A.
C. Huntley and family. These people
Â¦were absent when the fire broke out. The
total loss to the building and contents will
reach $3000.
OFFER PRAYERS
FOR THE DEAD
Calvarian Society Unites
in Most Solemn
Servicea
The annual devotions of the Calvartan
Society, consisting of the Way of the
Cross, a sermon and benediction were held
yesterday afternoon at St. Mary's Cathe
dral. It Is the custom of the members of
the society to meet on the Sunday.follow
ing All Souls' <Jay and offer up prayers for
the deceased members and relatives of
members.
Rev. Father Ramm recited the Way of
the Cross, the congregation Joining in the
responses. Rev. Father Dempsey preached
the sermon, dwelling on the objects of
the society and explaining the necessity
of prayer, particularly for the souls in
purgatory- He said in part:
On Friday the Catholic church celebrated the
feast of All Paint?. On Saturday she cele
brated tbe feast of All Soule. We are as
sembled out of respect for the latter date.
Thie date brings us back to a truth In the
Aiwstles' Creed, tbe communion of saints, in
Â¦which we emphasize our belief every lime we
recite our morning prayers.
When we pray for the souls In purgatory, so
do we expect them to pray for us. We are
all of one kingdom, one great family, and
there ought to be a bond of sympathy between
us. The saints in heaven are constantly before
the throne of God, offering up prayers in our
behalf. As they were our friends on earth,
60 are they our friends In heaven.
They have rone through all the trials and
tribulations of this life, just as we are non
doing. By their prayers and petitions to the
Almighty they are constantly seeking to inter
cede for ue that we may enjoy the delights cf.
heaven as they are enjoying them. The chuich
desire* to constantly bring them before us that
â¢Â»c may profit by their example.
The day of the saint i 6 not yet passed. We
may find them in all the daily walks of life.
The man in his office, the woman in her home,
may be lurt as much a saint as those that
are even now In heaven. Doing God's will
will entitle v* to sit at the right hand of
God. and while we may not bÂ« canonised or
belong to the heroic class of salnu, we can
still attain through prayer and religious ob
servances to the came beatific state. L<et ua
then pray for the souls in purgatory that they
may be loosed from their Bine and be trans
lated from the middle state to one of perfect
bliss.
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament
closed the exercises. During this portion
of the services the choir, under the direc
tion of Professor R. J. Harrison rendered

FIVE FOOTPADS CAUGHT BY POLICE
ARE ALL STRANGERS TO THE CITY
It Is Claimed That the Evidence Against Each of Them Is
Very Strong â Two Men Knocked Down and Robbed
by Four Thugs at Leavenworth and Sacramento Streets
FIVE SUSPECTED HIGHWAYMEN WHO WERE GATHERED IN BY THE POLICE IN THEIR RECORD BREAK
ING ROUND-UP OF THE FOOTPADS WHO COMMITTED THE MANY DARING HOLD-UPS THAT OCCURRED
IN THIS CITY SATURDAY NIGHT.
THE police did good work Saturday
night and Sunday morning in ar
resting five footpads, which is a
record that has seldom if ever
been equaled in police annals in
this city. Of the five men arrested two
are dangerous looking characters. These
two are Frank Nelson and Edward Da
vis, who held up Otto Fleissner and R.
N. Hamlin at the corner of Van Ness ave
nue and Jackson street about 9 o'clock
Saturday. night. They are both strangers
to the city and have been here only a few
days, taking up their quarters at 38 Minna
street. Nelson was arrested shortly after
\he robbery by Policeman Dugan, and the
bunch of keys taken by him from Hamlin
was found in his pockets when searched.
Davis is alleged to be the robber whn
presented the revolver at Hamlin' s head
while Nelson went through his pockets.
He wu arrested yesterday morning on
Minna street by Detectives Crockett and
Riordan and admitted to them that Nel
son had induced him to go out with him
Saturday night, for which he was sorry.
He had become acquainted with him in
the lodging-house. When seen in the City
Prison later he denied knowing Nelson,
and claimed he knew nothing about the

refuses to say hqw he got them. Nelson
refused to talk.
James L. Galley and James Roberts
charged with robbing Robert K. Clothier,
a waiter, on Jessie street, and Robert
Dillistone, a plumber, at Jessie and New
Montgomery streets, - Saturday night,
deny knowing arlything about the rob
beries, alt bough the evidence against
them is very strong.

Clothier was choked and robbed of i 2,
but Dillistone saved himself by blowing
a police whistle, which scared the rob
bers. They profess not to know eacii

homa and Roberts from Utah a few days
ago. They look like "hobos. 1 '
Robert Dooley, alias Thompson, who is
accused of robbing James Hosie, a car
penter of Santa Rosa, in a doorway at
1013% Folsom street of $100, denies that hi
is a robber. He is an Australian and says
he has been here about three weeks. He
was in a saloon at Fourteenth and Foi
som streets reading the papers, he says,
when Hosie accosted him, asking him if
he was an Englishman. He replied that
he was an Australian, and Hosie invited
him to have a drink. Hosie was very
much under the influence of liquor, and
PACKEBS'. PORTERS' AND
WAREHOUSEMEN'S OUTING
Afternoon Spent Pleasantly With
Sports and Dancing at Shell
Mound Park.
The Packers', Porters' and Warehouse
men's Union held Its first annual outing
at Shell Mound Park yesterday. The af
fair was largely attended and the guests
passed a pleasant afternoon with sports
and dancing.
Several candidates for public office were
on the grounds working zealously to fur
ther their political ambitions. Numerous
gate prizes of fancy articles and pro
visions were given away. A considerable
sum of money was realized, which will be
used for the benefit of the organization.
That the affair was so successful Is due
mainly to the efforts of the following com
mittees:
Arrangementsâ O. Duffy, C. Jackson, C. Mc-
Cready, E. Parnow, G. Sweeney, D. Barry, T.
Dolan. J. W. Shrakkart, J. J. Smith, R.
Groezlnger, P. Asher and H. Gelster.
Receptionâ R. J. Loughery, G. Rlckarda, M.

and R. Eastward.

Dooley alleges that he got the bartender
to give him "soft" drinks to sober him
up. Hosie asked him to take him to a
saloon on Polsom street, near Sixth, and
Dooley got on the car with him. They
left the car at Sixth street and were
searching for the saloon, so Dooley says,
when he -,vas arrested. Hosie made a pos
itive statement to the police that Dooley
robbed him in ihe doorway and in his ex
citement dropped the $20 that was found
by Miss Bertram on the doorstep.
Attacked by Four Men.
Another holcl-up was reported to Cap
tain Seymour yesterday morning. H. G.
Scovern, 2416 Sacramento street; S. P.
Johnston, 304 Maple street, and R. R.
Vail, 1900 Green street, had been at a sur
prise party ac the residence of Q. Cole
man, 1126 Pine street. They left together
about midnight and Vail took a Hyde
street car to go home. Scovern and John
ston had reached about the corner of
Sacramento and Leavenworth street*
when they noticed a young man standing
close to the building on the corner anj
three other young men not far from him.
As Scovern and Johnston turned into Sac
ramento street they were struck from be
hind and knocked down. Scovern's watch,
eyeglasses and a silver lead pencil holder
Â¦were taken from him, but the robbers ha-1
dropped the watch and it was recovered
later by a conductor. Johnston lost his
hat and had his eye and forehead bruiser!.
Scovern's right knee was injured. The
robbers ran up Sacramento street toward
Jones. Scovern and Johnston describe the
young man who was standing close to the
building as 22 or 23 years of age, smooth
shaven and of fair complexion. Policeman
James J. Barry was notified of the rob
bery and is working^pn the case. It is
thought a colored woman living at 1381
Sacramento street knows two of the rob
bers.
The police are inclined to believe that
Emil Hermon, foreman in rlie Fulton Iron
Works, who was attacked by three men
at Fell and Fillmore streets shortly after
midnight while with Miss Hamilton, wlr>
was also beaten, was not the victim of
footpads, although he lost a watch chain
during the scuffle. They rather believ.<
that the attack was due to the Ironwork
ers' strike. Hermon flred a shot at hi*
assailants and the bullet passed through
the coat sleeve and grazed the skin of F.
L. Dacouillas nf 669 Guerrero street, whs
told the police he was running to Her
mon's assistance, being attracted by the
cries of the woman.

GAMBLERS SEEK
BUCK OYE'S LIFE
Price Set on Head of
the Noted Chinese
Sport.
Buck Oye, the noted Chinese gambler,
has appealed to the police to protect him
from the wrath of highbinders. A few
days ago the hatchetmen of Chinatown
held a meeting and resolved to put Oye
out of the way. It is known that their
action was prevented by the offer of sev
eral thousand dollars* made by rival
gamblers for his head.*
The killing of the lookout for one of the
marked Chinamen's games a few morn
ings ago was the first step toward the
carrying out of the plot to slay him.
The murdered man was seated in an
. inclosure at the entrance of the gam
bling joint when two highbinders, dressed
!n dark clothes and wearing Fedora hats, |
entered the place ana fired several shots !
at him, killing him instantly. Two white
men, who are employed by the boss
gambler as bodyguards, were in the .
place at the time of the shooting. They
hurried after the murderers, but were
unable to catch them.
According to the police Oye's life Is
being sought for the reason that he is
accused of being a "wÃlcher." A short
time ago, it is claimed, two Chinese
gamblers played against his fantan game
and won over $2000, breaking the bank.
The proprietor gave them half of their
winnings and promised to pay the
balance on the following day. When they
returned to get the balance of the money
Oye repudiated their claims and ordered
them out of the den. Realizing he had
"welched," the two Chinamen hired a
Kang of highbinders to wreak vengeance
on him. A price was set on his head,
and with the hope of earning the blood 1
money the hired assassins started out to
get him. Knowing that the lookout was
armed and ready to shoot whenever it
was necessary, the murderers decided to
first put him out of the way. Two of
the best shots of the "gang" were ac
cordingly dressed in American clothes
and sent to the gambling "house to kill
him. Thinking that they were white men
the lookout allowed them to ascend the
stairs. On reaching the cage in which
their intended victim was seated they
cpened fire on the lookout, killing him in
stantly. It is believed that they Intended
to shoot Oye at the same time, but were
prevented by the appearance of thÂ° two
white men who were in the place at the
time.
