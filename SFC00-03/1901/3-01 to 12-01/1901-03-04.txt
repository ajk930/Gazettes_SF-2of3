Size of the Parade.
The final estimate of the size of the In
augural parade as given out at military
headquarters to-night was: Military,
volunteer and tegular, 22,240: veteran or
ganizations. 12,000; civic 'societies. 7S00.
Out of this number a total of about 17,500
arrivals bad been officially reported to
When the two Houses met during Vim
afternoon there was an added attraction
to the throng. Many of the visitors wers
ladles, the bright spring day bringing
them out in all their radiance of color and
costume. "With them mingled Jack tars
from the big monitor Puritan and ths
many other warships anchored In the Po-'
tomac, and troops of soldiers representing
the State organizations of all parts of th*
country- Seldom since the Civil War have
so many uniforms been seen at the Cap
itol. The Capitol police were instructed to
exercise every consideration for the via-
Itlng throngs and there was no disorder
and no arrests. -~\.
Early In the .day several hundred blue
coated soldiers from one of the near-by
States took possession of the House and
of the Capitol. The blouse was In recesa
until 2 p. m., but the emblem of legisla
tive authority, the mace, stood In position
as a warning that the dignity cf thÂ©
House must not be Invaded. But the sol
dier boys were oblivious to such congres
sional fictions. Before the weary door
keepers were aware of It the chamber
was In possession of several hundred, blue
coats. Some of them ascended to the
Speaker's rostrum and hammered for or
der. Others occupied the seata of mem
bers and for the ttxne being the Coor of
the House of Representatives, for the first
time In Its history, presented a completely
martial aspect. The soldiers were- after
souvenirs and some of them got them, to
the discomfiture of members. The of&cers
of the House finally came on the scens
and expelled the intruders.
Soldiers Invade the Souse.
The soldiers and visitors swarmed about
the capitol building where the legislators
were struggling with the remnants of
Congressional work. Throughout the day
and well Into the night they paced ths
Capitol corridors. To-morrow all the doorÂ»
will be closed except to those holding tick
ets of admission. But to-day everything
was open to the public. It Is not often
that the Sabbath calm of the buildings .Â»
disturbed by such a popular Invasion.
The Porto Rlcan contingent. In sombre
ros and tereador jackets mixed with the
Jackles of the naval contingent, and tha
lighter blue of the National Guard was
everywhere In a large majority. There
were not lacking strange combinations of
uniform that distinguished several of the
crack volunteer cavalry trrops. while tha
variety among the members of the varl
ous civic marching: clubs was almost end
less.
The crowd had a distinctly holiday air
on the street. The weather was mild
enough to permit a large display of fem
inine finery, and this, with tha mixture of
uniforms, gave the streets In the fash
ionable section of the Northwest much tha
appearance of an Easter Sunday parade.
Seldom has an inaugural gathering
brought out such an assortment of uni
forms as were met on every streetcar and
every street corner,. The dark blue serv
ice uniforms were relieved by the red
caps and facings of the artillery and thÂ©
yellow of the cavalry.
Like an Easter Sunday.
Inauguration eve was a quiet one, but *
crowded Sunday. The weather opened
threatening with a southeast wind and a
clouded sky, b'it toward noon It cleared'
and the sun set fair, with every Indica
tion of a good day to follow. From early
morning till toward midnight every street
in the downtown section was crowded.
The local churches kept open doors both
day and evening and were crowded with
worshipers at fvery service, many of the
visitors being In uniform and reminding
old residents of war time Sundays. In
the evening the theaters vied with the
churches In keeping open house and they
were equally well patronized. For such
as sought splrltous rather than spiritual
consolation there was a rather dry and
unprofitable time. The local Anti-Saloon
League had appointed a large vigilance
committee to see that the Sunday closing
law was enforced, and their efforts met
with considerable success. There was but
little sign of drunkenness on the streets.
The militiamen, who usually furnish a
good natured but rather turbulent ele
ment at Inaugurations, were dry and
decorous and up to a late hour there had
not teen the name cf a slnarle regular
entered upon the blotter at the station
house.
WASHINGTON. March 3.â When thÂ©
sun set upon the national capital to-day
everything that human effort could do to
make the second McKlnley Inauguration
a success had been done. A majority of
the- troops and civic organizations were
already In the city and safely quartered.

â¢'When the House reconvened at 8 o'clock
the discussion of the .resolution for the
appointment of a; special committee to
visit Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines

earnest speech op the subject of the sit

adoption of the resolution as the best
means of securing information concern
ing the situation, there. "Williams of .Miss

that it was certain that whatever report
the committee made would be a, political
one of no value in framing legislation.
The debate was interrupted by Burton,

on the river and harbor bill agreeing to all

sented the final conference on the postof
fice bill, and it was agreed to. The con
ference report on the bill to restore cer
tain items to the pension roll was agreed
to. The House thfen took up the Dalzell
resolution providing for the appointment
of a committee to visit Cuba. Porto Rico
and the Philippines. It was defeated.

ference on the ' naval . appropriation bill',
saying that complete agreement had been
arrived at on all points of ' difference on
that bill except upon the -Senate amend
ment authorizing the construction of
three additional submarine torpedo boats.

ing, that there was no further disagree
ment except upon the two amendments of

port upon the feasibility of the use of the

the alleged order ever was in possession
of the War Department and where It now
Â¦is.-. â¢ . . Â¦ ..-..Â¦,..,
Hale submitted a partial report upon
the naval appropriation bill. The princi
pal item of differences now . existinc, he
said, was that relative to the purchase of
three additional Holland torpedo boats.
The Senate conferees felt that they could
not recede upon that amendment without
first submitting the question to the Sen
ate. Hale Bald as the time of the session
was growing short he would offer a reso
lution discharging the present Senate con
ferees and requesting that the House
grant a further conference on the naval
bill. It was adopted. The Bafety appliance
bill then vsvas passed without further dis
cussion. ~ â¢ . .

izing the Secretary of the Navy to loan
certain naval equipment to schools.
Whep the Senate reconvened , at 10:30
f>. m. the scene in the chamber, partlcu
arly in the srallery, suggested a notable
social function. The galleries were packed
to the Â¦ doors and hundreds . of persons
were obliged to leave, "unable to grain ad
mission. ,?/â¢Â¦Â¦
The abandonment of the amendment
was "advocated by Platt and Hawley of
Connecticut, Hanna and Perkins. The
Senate was urged to stand firm by Butler
and Chandler. The Senate receded from
its amendment providing: for the construc
tion of three Holland boats. Under the
unanimous consent arrangement the fol
lowing House bills were passed, among
others:
â¢ Wolcott moved that the Senate recede
from Its Olsasrreement upon that point.
Stewart and Tillman antagonized the mo
tion; Tillman said there should be fifty
of such boats. He thought the boats more
effective tha-n battleships.

cost of $2000 more they were able to re
cover her boilers, engines and other, ma

SPOKANE. March 3.â In a fight over a
poker game, in a special car of' Richards
& Prlnglo's Minstrels, Arnle Stevens,
drill master, waa shot by Harry Graves,
a musician.
Stevens is dying at the hospital and
Graves Is held at the City Jail.
This was payday for the company, which
last night played an engagement In the
Palouse country. To pass : . away the
weary hours of travel to-day a poker
game was started, penny ante, and nickel
limit. Five men were in the game when
the cars reached the local Union Depot
to-night. The players were Stevens,
Graves. Allen, MacDonalu, the property
man, James osborne and Charles Hughes,
musicians.
All had been drinking. About 8 p. m.
the game broke up when Graves won a
jack-pot. He accused Stevens of stealing
two poker chips. This started a quarrel
which the others tried in vain to stop.
Stevens applied vile epithets to Graves
and the latter attempted to go to another
car. Stevens grabbed a wooden stool and
followed, threatening to lay Graves out.
As Stevens tnrew the stool Graves noticed
a revolver lying In an open locker near
where he was standing. He dodged the
stool, seized the gun and fired. The ball
from the 38-canber weapon entered the
right groin, severing the femoral artery.
Tne police were notified and Stevens
was taken to the hospital in an ambu
lance. He arrived weak from loss of
blood, too far gone to talk. The physi
cians say his wound is surely fatal.
Graves was taken into custody by the
police. An informal investigation was
had by the Prosecuting Attorney, who de
cided to permit the other members of the
company to continue their Journey to
Wardner. Idaho, where the minstrels Â¦will
give their next performance. Stevens'
home Is at Indianapolis. He Is a single
man. His mother lives in Chicago.
Member of Minstrel TroupÂ©
Is Shot Down on Train

Brothers \ in a New York
Town Make Curious Deal
in HousÂ«holds.
Fpeclal Dispatch . to The Call. '
MIDDLETOJi,'tk Y.~. March 3.â John
and Eli Reddiker. brothers, living near
Cragamoor (Sam's Point) , have traded
wives and families. The men are small
farmers and live but a - short distance
apart, their father having divided his
farm between them. John' is about 15
years old and Ell is perhaps 32. .
The deal in wives and families was the
result of a bantering proposition made
by John several months ago while he and
his wife were spending an evening at
Ell's. The wives took a. part in the dis
cussion and the proposition was laughed
at as a lirst-elass joke. The subject was
brought up again and again at subsequent
meetings of the families and every time
it was discussed tho Idea seemed to grow
in favor with all parties concerned.
John had . two children,- a boy of five
years and a girl of three, and Ell had a
boy about three years old. When it came
to arranging the terms for the deal, Ell
insisted, since the wives were to take the
children, he ought to have something to
boot to make up for assuming the care
and support of an extra child. . The prop
osition seemed reasonable and after much
haggling it was arranged that John should
give him his cows.
Having won out on this proposition. Ell
then demanded more "boot," since his
wife was several years younger and much
more .comely than his brother's. Mrs.
John did not take u.ndly.to this demand,
saying ; that it was a poor way to begin
life together to cast reflections on her age
and attractiveness, but Ell insisted .that
youth and good looks ought to' count in
a wife dicker as well as in a horse, trade.
John offered a hor?e well along in years
to even things up." Ell demanded a wagon
as well, and when this was thrown in,
the deal was made and the wives and chil
dren changed abodes. . . ut'fil:

this is another instance of defective in

MENTO, March 3.â Shall adjournment be
the 9th, the 16th or a compromise some
where along in the middle of the second
week in March? If the legislators had
unbiased say they would adjourn at once.
Were the attaches consulted they would
hold on until next July, and a careful
study of the files shows nothing to be
done that could not have been finished
three weeks ago. It is strange how the
really important legislation sifts down to
the end of the session and causes delay.
The geneial appropriation bill has notn
ing about it tnat shows cause for delay
after February, and the fact that it was
in as early as ever it was does not help
matters. There are few changes of im
portance and much of the bill is but a"
re-enactment of former figures.
The county government bill shows no
excuse for coming in after the fiftieth
day. Apportionment might as well have
been in January and all the tights would
he over now. The primary law that peo
have been talking of and planning for two
years is not completely before the Legis
lature now, and there is no reason on
earth, except a desire to argrue,' why the
code revision -bills should not now be
signed by the Governor.
The China Basin bills are still on file,
when they might as well have come In
the first week and been through the mill
by February--
Had the Se-natOrs and Assemblymen,
been more willing to work and less will
ing to junket through the State they
would be able to adjourn now. Yesterday
was the first Saturday when both houses
held a session, and more than often a
bare quorum has been kept from the
junket in order to transact business.
By the end of this week there will not
be a bill on the file worth taking a vote
on unless horse play and inattention take
the place of work. Captious amendments,
long-winded speeches and calls of the
House and Senate may delay matters,
but without them there Is nothing to pre
vent the adoption of the concurrent reso
lutions providing for an adjournment on
the 9th.
ORGANIZED TO FIGHT
THE REDWOOD PARK BILL
Seven Administration Men Will At-
tempt to Keep It Fropa Ur

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 3.â The ardor shown by
Ralston and his six associates who in
tend to join in a protest if there be any
attempt made to place the Big Basin Red
wood Park bill on the Assembly special
urgency file is now understood. Governor
Gage, it Is asserted, docs not want the
bill passed. The friends of the measure
must overcome his objections if they
want to secure Its enactment.
The men who are banded together to
keep the bill from reaching a vote on final
passage in the Assembly are even' one of
them men who have throughout the ses
sion accommodated their own ideas to
those of the chief executive. Ralston,
Hasson, Broughton, Savage. Henry.
Treadwell and Bliss are the seven, and
thej- are all "administration men." An
Assemblyman who is close to the Gov
ernor said to-night that Gage's desire to
have the bill defeated rather than to
come up to him for veto was the expla
nation of the sudden disregard in the As
sembly for the recommendation of thÂ«
Ways and Means Committee.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO,' March 3. â The Governor's veto
of the bill appropriating $20,000 for addi
tions to the Sutter Fort grounds and for
impro\-lng these grounds has raised some
what of a. storm in XatlvÂ« Sons circles.
Tha bill was a pet measure of the Native
Sons and within the organization con
siderable bitterness of feeling is said to
exist.
Greer has put In a neâ bill, which, as
he stated when he Introduced it, does not
contain the features to which the Gov
ernor,objected in his veto message. Chief
of these was the fact that the money ap
propriated was to become available be
fore January 1. 1902. The intention is to
crowd the bill along on the file If possible
and give the Governor a chance to take
a stand on the bill with his stated objec
tions removed. This late in the session,
however, that will be almost impossible
of accomplishment. The bill may be held
up in committees and on the We until the
most determined efforts in its behalf will
not avail to get it through both the As
sembly and Senate before adjournment.

MEXTO, March 3. â There is prospect of a

on second reading an 1 Its opponents are
getting: ready to make stubborn resistance
to its passage.
The State Printing Office Is united In the
attempt to force the bill through, as the
friendliness of Governor Gage and State

the present regime In office should the
bill become a law. Governor Gape him

PARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE.
DURING a debate in the Commons a few days
ago Mr. O'Donnell of West Kerry obtained
the fldor and began to make a speech in the
old language of the people of that district. Ths
Speaker called him to order and insisted that he
speak English. Thereupon arose a furious debate.
It was asserted there is no law of the realm requiring
a member of Parliament to speak any particular lan
guage. One member pointed out that in bygone
years the Commons had invited a number of Irish
chieftains to address -hem in Irish; another cited the
fact that he had himself heard in the New Zealand
Parliament a native member speak in the Maori lan
guage. All such arguments, however, were summar
ily set aside by the Speaker, who declared that not
for 100 years had there been any other language
spoken in Parliament but English, and that there
fore the member from West Kerry must speak Eng
lish or hold his peace.
Thje incident gives a renewed interest to the per
plexing problem of what constitutes parliamentary
language. The Speaker of the Commons maintained
in the case before him that a member must speak'the
language that is understood by the .people, so that
they may know what is being said in Parliament on
the issues of the time. The rule sounds well, but it
was weakened somewhat by the emphatic statement
of the man from West Kerry that his constituents
understand Irish.
About the time that dispute was occupying atten
tion in Great Britain the United States Senate was
also engaged in consideration of problems of lan
guage. In the course of an address in favor of an ap
propriation for the distribution of seeds Senator Till
man stated that the measure is in the interests of
'agriculture," and he went on to inform the Senators
that the word is derived from the Latin words "ager"
and "cultura," whereupon Senator Beveridge of In
diana asked him what the Latin words' mean. To
that question Tillman replied, "Whether the Senator
is attempting to display my ignorance or to. display
his own, I prefer to let him interpret. I would not
have undertaken to give the derivation of agriculture
if I had not known something about the roots."
Unplacated by that retort courteous and undismayed
by the fear of the Tillman pitchfork, the Senator from
Indiana returned to ;he charge and insisted that the
Senator from South Carolina translate the Latin
words. He carried His point. . Thus in the . United
States Senate as well as in the British House of Com
mons the precedent has been established that a mem
ber must talk the language of the people. He who
would orate in Irish c* in Latin must hire a hall.
It may be further noted that even Eriglish'docs not
always give satisfaction. In a recent debate on the
postoffice bill Senator Mason could not find a docu
ment from which he desired to read. While he wai
lookinc for it Wolcott moved that the Senate vote
THE encouraging aspect of general trade ten
days ago has become even more pronounce 1
during the past week. From all parts of the
country commercial reports are bright. With the
exception of the cotton and woolen industries almost
all lines are reported in good and steadily improving
condition, The activity in the iron and steel trades
resembles the boom of 1899. The different mills arÂ»
supplied with orders far ahead, prices are advancing,
and those for some descriptions are actually over thc^
nominal card quotations. Ecuador, Africa and Aus
tralia are in the market for rails and other rail
way material, and the demand for other forms of iron
is said to be healthy and for actual consumption, and
not due to the operations of pools or combinations.
The boot and shoe business is reported lively, though
the rush of buying for the West is on the wane.
Leather is somewhat higher, but hides are depressed
at Chicago, owing to large stocks. Lumber is very
firm under a heavy demand for building, and Chicago
reports the heaviest business ever done in yellow and
white pine. The Northwest reports a large trade in
farming implements, though cold weather in that sec
tion has interfered more or less with the general dis
tributive trade. The jobbing trade in groceries, hard
ware and iron specialties is said to be enlarging. Thi
sales of wool at the three chief Eastern markets art
twice as large as they were at this time last year,
though it is generally believed th'at the purchases are
for speculative, account, as the demand for woolen
goods continues light. There is some improvement
in the export demand for cottons, but it is far from
heavy, and the domestic inquiry' is moderate, while
the prospects are for liberal crops during the coming
season.
While the merchandise situation makes this particu
larly bright exhibit the statistical showing, while still
favorable, is not as brilliant as for the past several
weeks. The country's bank clearings last week gained
18 per cent over the corresponding week in 1900, but
the gain for the preceding week was 60 per cent. For
several weeks every important city in the country
showed an increase in these clearings, but last week
the tendency was just the other way and of the twenty
largest cities only seven gained. The failures, on the
contrary, which have for some time been larger than
for the preceding 3*ear, have turned the tables, and
are now smaller, those for the week being 167, against
173 for the same week in 1900.
The gigantic steel combine still keeps Wall street
unsettled. It has not affected the money market to
any marked extent, but has made prices for the differ
ent stocks concerned more or less irregular and caused
a good deal of cross buying and selling naturally to
be expected during the adjustment of the stocks to
their new conditions. Otherwise Wall street has de
veloped nothing new" during the week.
Here in San Francisco trade is running along nor
rnalfr, without especial feature. The very warm
weather of the past few days has given vegetation a
remarkable start and plants arc growing rapidly in all
sections. The fruit trees are not generally in blossom
yet, having been kept back by the cold weather of the
first two months of the ycar f> but the color of the
bloom is beginning to show here and there. Fruit
growers expect a later season than last year, which h
a good thing, for it is generally found that late sea
sons produce better and higher-priced fruit. The sea
son has thus far fcecn ideal for crops, and the outlook
in this respect could hardly be better.

McKINLEY'S SECOND TERM.
WHEN Malibran after the triumphs of her youth
and early womanhood 1 , went to Paris in the
maturity of her powers- to meet the critical
audiences of that gÂ»eat_city, Alfred de Musset greeted
her with a phrase whose paradoxical aptness has made
it memorable. He said to her: "You have a splendid
past to look forward'to."
One cannot look forward to the past, yet every on;
understands what the brilliant French poet meant,
and recognizes that he could not have expressed that
meaning more clearly by any other form of speech.
The various stages of human life are so closely linked
together that one reasbnably expects to find the past
repeated in the future. He who has had a successful
career behind him has a right to look forward to a
future equally successful.
President McKinley as he takes the oath of office
and enters upon the second term of his Presidency
has a splendid past to look forward to. His whole
career in life has been fortunate to himself and profit,
able to his country. He has had a splendid good luck
even in his defeats. Had he been chosen Speaker of
the House at the time of his famous contest with
Reed, he would not have made in that office anything
like the great reputation he acquired as chairman ot
the Ways and Means Committee in -draughting the
McKinley tariff bill. He was fortunate again when
he was defeated for Congress in 1890, for that defeat
removed him from the House during the wrangles
over the silver question and enabled him to disclose
in the ofnee of Governor of Ohio those great admin
istrative abilities that convinced the country of his fit
ness for the Presidential office.
His election to the Presidency was attended by an
immediate revival of prosperity, and while that pros
perity was largely due to natural causes which brought
good crops and to improved financial conditions
in Europe which provided good markets, yet it has
been everywhere recognized that McKinley's personal
influence added much to the general good because
his position in the* high office of President of the
United States gave confidence to the people that no
legislation adverse to business and sound finance or of
a disturbing character of any kind would be enacted
during his term. Thus the campaign description of
him as the "advance agent of prosperity" was ful
filled to the letter, and the services of the President
in promoting the general welfare have confirmed the
confidence reposed in him.
The war with Spain came unexpectedly, but was
conducted by the administration both in battle and in
diplomacy with a patriotism and a sagacity which won
as well as merited the approval and commendation of
the people. The great mass of intelligent Americans
were gratified in that emergency by the knowledge that:
the chief magistrate of the republic was one who would
successfully uphold the best traditions of American
statesmanship. The war Was not a great one, nor did
it impose any strain upon the American people, but
it nevertheless served to enable McKinley to reveal
once more the genuineness of his character and his fit
ness for his high office. Consequently having been
thus tried in war and in peace, in. domestic and in
foreign affairs, the vote of the people for the re-elec
tion of McKipley was overwhelming, and he has
closed his first term with a record of which any states
man might be proud.
Such has been the past from which the country
draws auguries of the future. The President enters
upon his second term assured of the confidence and
support, of his fellow countrymen, and under circum
stances that promise ;,n even greater prosperity than
that which has prevailed during his first term. The
grand parades of the inaugural at : Washington will
but faintly express the satisfaction of the people in
their President and in their prospects. The whole
country hails him and salutes him as he enters upon
the second term of his high office, and feels good
cheer in the knowledge that the past will be repeated
and improved in the luture.

square of ground In the center of the
new town and ?5000 in cash. This was
refused, but the ground was nevertheless
donated, and also the money on condi
tion that if It was not expended on a
courthouse It should be used by the com
missioners in bulldlncr roads leading Into

was left to a vote of the people, and

â¢were piling up. The irrigation canals
were being I extended In ' all directions,

making Itself apparent. These early set

surroundings to their friends at home,
and* the work of the Dusons became
easier.
The first Northern settlers brought to
Acadie parish by Mr. Duson were from
Hillsdale, Mich. He was compelled to pay
the freight on their household goods and
to furnish the money with which to pay
the Government fee to enter their lands.
These people to-day are among the most
thrifty farmers in Southwest Louisiana.
They now cultivate 2000 acres of rice
land. / ,
Mr. Duson's headquarters, now at
Crowley, were then at Rayne, the prin
cipal town of the section In those days.
The newspaper of that town was par
ticularly bitter against his efforts, and,
having some old political scores to set
tle, squared matters by misrepresenting
the country and discouraging strangers
from coming to it. To get It out of the
way Mr. Duson purchased the plant and
locked up the office untft he could find
the right man to run it. â¢
Hostility of the Native Acadians
When Mr. Duson began to put into ex
ecution his scheme to develop Southwest
Louisiana he encountered conditions that
were peculiarly discouraging. . Nearly all
the people inhabiting the country were
poor and densely Ignorant. They culti
vated small patches of cotton, weaving
it into cloth sufficient for their own use.
They raised their own sweet potatoes,
they had little fields of sugar cane and
they produced rice enougti ror their own
families, which they prepared for the ta
ble by pounding it in wooden mortars and
pouring It from one dish to another to
winnow the chaff from the grain. This
was only twenty years ago. Ihese people
paid no taxes and wanted no improve
ments. There were also cattlemen who
owned thousands of cattle which occu
pied the prairies. It was not to be ex
pected that this class was anxious to
see the ranges broken up and the land
put under cultivation.. If a stranger stop
ped to look at the country not a man
could be found to speak a good word for
Southwest Louisiana. He was told by the
cattlemen that the land was so poor that
It would produce nothing. He was gruffly
informed, by the shiftless and lawless ele
ment that Northern men were not wanted.
â¢ In 18S0 William W. Duson, native Louis
lanian of small means and Incomplete
education; came to the conclusion that
fortunes were to be made In growing rice
In Southwest Louisiana. At that time he
was a merchant. After a consultation
with his elder brother, C. C. Duson. the
two decided to Invest In land and to ex
periment in rice culture. .The natives o&
that region, who were an easy-going, non
ambitious people, liaa long engaged tit
rice-growing on a small scale, the cereal
produced by them being Irrigated only by
natural rainfall. Men owning half a sec
tion of land planted eight or ten acres of
the lowest ground,* using the rest as a.
watershed. Mr. Duson revolutionized the
industry by damming up the gullies,
building reservoirs and pumping the
water out of them on the fields of
growing rice. In this way it became
practicable to plant the grain on every
acre of land' that he owned. His profits
for the first year were so large that he
bought vast tracts of land and extended
his operations. Up to that time genuine
prosperity had been an unknown quantity
to the people of that section.
He next determined to attract settlers
to the country, and made a trip North
and West in the interest of his plan.- Since
he started on that work over 25,000 north
ern and western men have become inhab
itants of the prairies of Southwest Louis
iana. To-day most of them are prosper
ous, their lands are Irrigated by over 6000
miles of canals, and millions of barrels
of ricte are shipped from their fields to
the markets of the country every year.
Mr. Du9on has established towns and fac
tories and enterprises of various kinds,
and the people look upon him not alone
as the leading spirit and master mind
but as tbe benefactor of their country.
Southwest-Louisiana, the land of "Evan
gellne," has been transformed within the
last two decades from a wild waste of
prairie into the center of- a thriving In
dustry. It has been populated by pro
gressive men from Northern and Western
States, and is now one of* the wealthiest
sections of the country. Towns dot every
parlsh, and the homeseekers who but a
few years ago were practically without
means * are now well-to-do or even
wealthy. The development of this rich
agricultural section Is the work of one
man.

HI. â William "Wilton Duson.
Crowley was declared the parish scat.
A short time later Mr. Duson arranged
a series of excursions from New Orleans
and other places, with free transporta
tion. Auction sales of lots were held,
and hundreds of lots/were sold at prices
ranging from to to $25 each. Many of
these lots have since brought from $3000
to $10,000 each.
To Induce the Southern Pacific railroad
to build a depot at Crowley, C. C. Duson
was compelled to go to New York, visit
the late Collis P. Huntington. then the
president of the railroad, and agree to
pay the expense of putting In the switches
and siding and also to pay the salary of
the railroad agent.
When Mr. Duson moved his newspaper
from Rayne to Crowley the bitter feeling
of the natives broke out afresh. A band
of sixty-two men organized themselves*
Into a Good-of-the-Community League
and sixty of them voted to destroy the
newspaper, plant and burn the home of
W. W. Duson. But Mr. Duson persisted
in his policies and overcame all Ignorant
opposition.
Since these days the growth and devel
opment qf Crowley and the rice country
around it has been marvelous. Emigrants
from Kansas, the Dakotas, Nebraska,
Minnesota and. other States poured Into
the new country. They are now growing
rice. Â¦-Â¦â¢ -.
Until within the last few years 'there
were no manufacturing enterprises In that
entire section and nearly every dollar se
cured by the people was derived from
agriculture, the profits on rice culture so
far exceeding thosa of cotton and sugar
cane that the rice planter has grown
wealthy, while the sugar and cotton
planter has done well to hold his own.
There is now about to be put under way a
plan wherebylarge tracts of swamp land?
In the parishes of Rapides, Avoyelles and
St. Landry will be drained and the rich
alluvial soil given over to the cultivation
of rice. The Dusons are largely responsi â¢
ble for the enterprise. The levee board
representing these parishes a few weeks
ago sold bonds to the amount of $250,000 for
the purpose of excavating eighty-five
miles of drainage canals and earning oft
the water, which now covers a great por
tion of the parishes during a considerable
period of the year. Into the Red River
and the Island lakes. It is a peculiar fact
that In the lowlands of Louisiana the
ground is higher along the rivers than
anywhere else and the slope is from the
rivers to the lakes. Under the new plan
the drainage will be in both directions by
reason of a system of pumping stations
such as thoso at present In successful
operation at New Orleans. These pump
ing stations will be placed at intervals
along the canals and the water lifted an;l
then precipitated down the succeeding
grade. Much of this land is covered with
valuable timber which will be cleared out
and marketed in New Orleans for export
to Europe.
Making a Poor. Country Rich.
Some years ago W. W. Duaon was asked
where liis profits would come from in his
schemes of development. It seemed that
many of his settlers were growing rich,
while he remained In only moderate cir
cumstances. His reply was: "I will be
worth many millions some of these days,
but to make this possible I must first de
velop the rice lands, make the men
around me rich, make a poor country
wealthy and then draw tribute from It."
The work of development has proceeded
rapidly since that day. and though Mr.
Duson and his brother have grown com
paratively wealthy their successes are yet
to bring them in the great' returns they
have long ago anticipated. Their scheme
is a simple one. after all, and is made
complex merely through the extensive na
ture of their operations. Both own vast
tracts of undeveloped land, which to be
come profitable must first be made to pay
a profit to the homesteader. They hold
the key to the entire situation, through
their ownership of many enterprises on
which the country's prosperity rests In
large measure.
W. W. Duson, while all his Interests are
centered In the rice-producing section of
Louisiana, has the active management of
more different kinds of business on his
hands than any other man in the South,
the details of which he looks after care
fully. C. C. Duson is the diplomat. 'He
It is who In Washington has secured the
tariff protection from the Government
which makes the production of rice so
highly profitable to the Louisiana planter.
The securing of favorable freight rates,
helpful legislation and similar benefits has
been left to C. C. Duson, and in nearl*
every instance his labors have been suc
cessful. W. W. Duson, however, controls
the whole organization. The brothers
work together in perfect harmony and for
the common good.
W. W. Duson is now the owner of the
Crowley Canal Company.- president of tne
Roller Canal Company (limited), vico
president of the Ferre Canal Company
(limited), vice president of the Abbott-
Duson Canal Company, president of tha
Midland Canal Comparry, vice president of
the Miller-Morris Canal Company and
president of the Star Rice Milling Com
pany (limited). He is the controlling
power in dozens of commercial and finan
cial enterprises of various kinds. His lat
est undertaking Is the organization of a
J15.000.000 company to control the rice
market of the United States. The capital
is understood to be available whenever
Mr. Duson is ready for operations to be
gin. A number of New York caDltallst 1 ?
and financiers are associated with Mr.
Duson in this enterprise, which is know*
as the American Rice-growers' Distribu
tion Company (limited). Mr. Duson is
the general manager. .
C. C. Duson. through his wide acquaint
ance'with men of means and prominence
throughout the North and East, has aided
largely in the work of development and
Investment. He is the president of tha
American Rice-growers' Distribution Com
pany. He is also president of the Aeadle
Canal Company and vice president of the
Midland Canal Company. He is State
Senator from the Twelfth Senatorial Dis
trict of Louisiana, composed of St Lan

THE GAMBLERS' ORDINANCE
BEFORE the Supervisors to-day the resolution
authorizing gambling at Ingleside race track
will come up for final -passage. The gamblers
and their allies, Hushed by the success attained in
passing the resolution to print, are now sanguine of
victory and will hardly seek to further postpone the
contest. The vote therefore may be expected to be
taken to-day. The issue is fairly before the Supervisors
and before the people. It is to be shown to-day who
stand for morality and who for gambling and all the
vices and crimes that attend upon gambling.
While the vote on the motion to pass to print
showed a strong majority on the side of the gamblers,
it is reasonable to presume that some of those who
voted aye on that motion will vote no on the ques
tion of adopting the ordinance. Moreover it is dif
ficult to believe that Mayor Phelan after his many
declarations concerning the evil of gambling can,
when brought face to face with 'the issue, so stultify
himself as to approve of the ordinance permitting"
gambling even should it be passed by the Super
visors. Consequently, despite the exultation of the
gamblers, the passage of the ordinance is not yet sure.
There remains a chance for the advocates of morality
to win if they continue to resolutely make the fight
against the evil.
Such being the situation, every good citizen who
feels any responsibility to the community should
either in person or by petition and protest appear
before the Supervisors to-day and oppose the passage
of the ordinance. The position of those who support
morality is strong. They have upon their side not
only the arguments of reason and of experience but
the assurances of the Mayor of his opposition to
gambling, the vote of the people against a proposal
to legalize poolselling, and the pledges of the Super
visors themselves that they would uphold and support
the charter, including that provision which enables the
people to have a voice in determining what shall be
permitted and what shall not be permitted unde:
municipal ordinances.
It is true the utterances of the Mayor of late have
not been in strict accord with his emphatic declara
tions against the toleration of gambling made but a
short time ago, and yet even his latest utterances have
not been of a nature to win support for the gambling
scheme. He spoke of it as a license to permit "pocket
picking." That phrase shows the attitude of the
Mayor to the subject. He may be willing to permit
the practice of gambling at Ingleside track in the
hands of the few rich men who are now applying for
the gambling permit, but he does not shut his eye,
to the true nature of their scheme. He sees and
he says it is a license to "pick pockets" that the
schemers are after; and should he approve an ordi
nance granting the gambling privilege he would put
himself on record by his own words of approving
pocket-picking when practiced by men whom he
favors.
Should the ordinance be passed and approved there
will remain an opportunity to take an appeal to the
people at the coming election, but the ordinance
should not be passe-1. The Supervisors know that
the scheme has been virtually rejected by the people
in tne vote at the last election. They know that
petition after petition from men representing . the
business, the finance and the morality of the city has
been laid before them protesting against the threat
ened wrong. What excuse or even apology can they
make for themselves if they enact such an ordinance
in the face of such protests?
Finally, had there been no protest at all the Super
visors should still oppose the ordinance because of
the lessons experience has taught. It was but a few
days ago that a young man of good family committed
an assault upon a Chinaman and robbed him of money
for the purpose of getting means to make up his
losses on the race track. The annals of the police
court and of the Morgue abound with stories even
more horrible of the evil results of the curse of
gambling. There can hardly be upon the Board of
Supervisors a single man who has not had some friend
or acquaintance brought to ruin and to crime by this
hideous vice. How then can any one of them vote to

No less sincere however, was the con
vention's endorsement of the late Judge
Cooney, who had for many years been
a member of the convention that cele
brates the Celtic national holiday. Mr.
O'Connor rend the resolution, and fully
half an hour thereafter was consumed In
the expression of eulogies by members of
the convention. Mr. O'Connor spoke at
length of Judge Cooney's connection with
the body In session, and others who added
their testimonials to his life work and
character were Messrs. McGrath, Can

Intense enthusiasm was created when
the resolution spoke of Mr. White as the
man who had "made illustrious that seat
that had already been filled by three men
of his race. Broderlck, Conness andCasser

the strength of his fidelity, loyalty and
courage, the purity of his home, and re
counted the story of the . noble Impulses
that had ever been his guiding star in
his service to the people. Mr. Barry, Mr.
Heenan, Colonel McGrath and others
spoke feelingly of the deceased, and oth

words of praise. Sympathy was, of course,
extended to the bereaved family of the
ex-Senator, and a suitably engrossed copy

James Robinson, for Southern California.
Thousands of visitors at the Presidio
yesterday tendered a fitting welcome to
the Thirty-sixth Infantry. At an early
hour In the morning the reservation was
crowded, and when the whistles of the
bay steamers carrying the returning vol
unteers were heard, all rushed to tho
wharf. Stationed there were the garri
son troops and the Third Artillery band,
awaiting the arrival of the regiment. Aa
soon as the vessel reached the dock the
band rendered Its choicest selections, and
the escort presented arms.
The men disembarked rapidly, and were
soon In marching order. Headed by tho
band the parade started, the post soldiers
falling in behind the musicians and tho
Manila heroes In the rear.
The regiment was escorted to the upper
portion of ModelCamp and all along the
line of march the spectators shouted
cheering words of welcome. The men
reached the camp after a few minutes*
march and were soon disbanded and or
ganized into working parties. The hurry
and bustle attendant upon preparing a
camp for the occupancy of hundreds of
troops took up the early hours of the day,
but by noon the quarters of the men were
ready for the visitors anxiously awaiting
a chance to ask questions concerning
friends In the Philippines, and to listen
to tales of stirring adventure.
Those who remained on the wharf after
the landing of the Thirty-sixth Infantry
and its 6tart for camp witnessed
a sad spectacle. The unloading
of the bodies of those who died in Manila
began. From the hold of the steam
er were brought up the plain long boxes,
containing the remains of the soldiers.
In a few moments the crowd had. quietly
dissolved, for the contrast between the
â¢home-coming of the living soldiers and of
those who had sacrificed their lives in far
away lands was more than it could en
dure.
Ira Klpp, an artillery private, was
thrown from his horse yesterday after
noon and suffered a fracture of a bone
In his left ankle.
Lt. F. Boughen and Leo de Norbonne
died yesterday at the General Hospital.

Mrs. George Doubleday, who Is visiting
her people In Oakland, will soon return
to her New York home, whence she will
be accompanied by her sister. Miss Lucy
Moffltt. The present visit is Mrs. Double
day's first one since she left a bride, about
a year ago. Her many friends had a
charming opportunity to greet her on
Tuesday last. . when her mother. Mrs.
Moffltt, gave an elegant dinner in Mrs.
Doubleday'o honor at her home in Oak
land. The dinner was a most elaborate
affair, for which fifty covers were laid.
Mrs. Jewett has adopted the prevailing
Eastern fadâ Lenten readings. The first
of these affairs took" place at Mrs.
Jewett's home on Mondav evening last,
and the clever reader. Miss Jennie Long,
presented a delightful programme. Mr.
and Mrs. Jewett did not appear at the
reading owing to the recent death of their
most Intimate friends, Mr. and Mrs.
Rounsevelle Wildman.
public until early In the fall, when they
promise some sort of affair, altogether
new, and with which they hope to fill
tho hospital's coffers.
Although special dispatches from Porto
Plata, Santo Domingo, have shown that
serious trouble with Haytl was expected,
strict censorship has been maintained by
Haytl and such dispatches as heretofore
have been permitted to go out have been
denials of any activity on the part of the
republic.
It Is evident, however, that Haytl Is now
taking steps to offset the gathering of
Santo Domingo's naval and military forces
at Monte Christi, near the scene of tho
recent fighting on the boundary.

The proposed "rummage sale" that the
patronesses of the Children's Hospital
have been worrying about has been de
clared "off." The ladles having the af
fair in hand met one difficulty after
another, until they finally had to succumb
to the inevitable. Anyway, the "rummage
sale" had all the new shine rubbed off it
by the successful little affair gotten up
by a bevy of enthusiastic girl-workers in
the name of the Infants' Shelter. They
had two eales, each of two days' dura
tion, and they netted altogether $300.
Three hundred was much for the infants.
but for the Children's Hospital It would
only be a drop In the bucket. The patron
esses of the hospital. have taken all these
points Into consideration, and their decis
ion is to make no appeal to a generous
Mr. and Mrs. Francis Burton Har
rison are on their way out here, ac
companied by Mrs. Burton Harrison.
They are going, however, for a tour
of Mexico before coming here. I
understand that the desire to be present
at the weddings of Mary Scott and young
Martin and Caro Crockett and Laurence
Scott Is what brings the distinguished
party out here. Caro Crockett and Mary
Scott were bridesmaids when Mary
Crocker became Mrs. Harrison, and the
gossips have It that the bride promised
them to assist at her bridesmaids' wed
dings when this happiness should come to
them.
Mrs. Arnold is more than a lover of
music. She is the fortunate possessor of
a magnificent voice that has been trained
by the finest European masters. When
Frangcon Davies is here Mrs. Arnold will
give a musicale and will sing with the
great man. At present the lady Is sing
ing considerably with Edgar 'Mills. Tha
beau of Menlo has a magnificent voice,
which blends beautifully with that of the.
society impresario.
Although Mrs. Arnold Is new among us,
shÂ« has many friends here, friends who
enjoyed the hospitality of her foreign
home. Alice Ames (now Mrs. Robblns)
and Bessie Ames were known in the Ger
man capital as "Mrs. Arnold's tea girls,"
because they might always be found
pouring tea at the delightful Arnold "at
homes."
I have never seen a more perfectly ap
pointed horne than Mrs. Arnold's. And I
ceased to marvel at it when I was told
that the house was built to suit the re
markable furnishings. All that is in that
elegant Washington-street house was In
Mrs. Arnold's home In Berlin. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Arnold spent many years in
collecting that furniture, and when they
decided to build here they decided also
that all that made their Berlin home
beautiful should be brought out to grace
the house in California.
Mrs. Arnold's home is an ideal one for
entertaining. The apartments are spa
cious and filled with wondrouif carved
wood and gobelin upholstered furnltura
and many works of art. Her nrtisic room
seats 300 people and is as a music room
should beâ destitute of all superfluous
hangings and without even a rug on the
exquisitely polished floor â nothing. In
short, that might interfere with the per
fect acoustics of the room.
Mrs. Flora Arnold is the lady, and her
first act in the transformation scene will
bÂ« the introduction of the world's great
est barytone, Frangcon Davles. Mr. Da
vies will come out here in April by spe
cial invitation of Mrs. Arnold, give two
concerts, probably at the California Thea
ter, and spend one whole month on the.
coast, the guest of his friend and man
ager.
Mrs. Arnold Is already busily preparing
to entertain her distinguished guest. Big
gest among the many things ehe has
planned is a reception in his honor, to
which, in addition to the lady's personal
friends, will be asked all the music teach
ers of this city and their pupils. "I love
all students of music." says Mrs. Arnold,
in explanation of this novel form of en
tertainment, "and I want them to enjoy
the great lesson of meeting a world fa
mous musician."
MUSIC and the love of music â
these have been the cause of
many wondrous transformation
Bcenes. but none, I wager, more
marvelous than thia their last
achievementâ the converting of a society
woman into a full-fledged Impresario.
BY SALLY SHARP.
Considerable alarm Is felt In the north
ern mining 'Â¦amps, which are, however,
prepared to give any marauders a warm
reception. Maxims a.id plenty of small
firms are stated to have been supplied to
the American mining camps in \Vunean
district ar.d it 1* believed they could hold
out for weeks if .necessary.
A- thousand Korean troops under Colo
r.el Kim Yi Chong had. in fact, left Seoul
for Wuju. and 500 more were being dis
patched from Pingyang City, while a Jap
nr.ese warship was to co-operate at a
piven pnir.t on the coast. Meantime* the
Russians, who. it appears, had driven the
l'oxe-rs Rnd banditti south from Kirln,
were following up the enemy and even
cr<i?fed the border and occupied several
Korean villages, which they looted and
rtrore the Inhabitants into the hil!s. The
Russians were still holding the Korean
territory when the' last couriers from the
T"rvjr!>e<! district were dispatched with
rppTts for the Government.
A large number of Koreans found the
Boxersand were making their way south

A fair day and a perfect road aided J.
13. Hobson of the Olympic Club "Wheelmen,
in breaking the 25-mlle PaclHc Coast cy
cle road record yesterday in the annual
handicap of the Associated Cyclists at
j'an Leandro. He covered the triangular
course in 1 hour 8 minutes 18 seconds,
which is eight seconds better than the
best previous time, made by C. M. Smith
of San Jose in 1S9S.
The conditions were perfect for fast
cycle racing. The dry spell following the
recent rains had left the road in excellent
condition and not a breath of air retarded
the racers in their efforts. Hobson start
ed from the scratch mark with three oth
ers and finished ninth In a field of forty
three riders. The winner of first place
was Burton Downing of San Jose, who
had a handicap of 1:30. < Arthur McDonald
of 'San Jose also rode under the former
record, being but two seconds behind
Hobson.
Yesterday's race was the seventh an
nual event of its kind conducted by the
California Associated Cyclists and its pre
decessors. The arrangements were fault
less, and much credit is due Thomas G.
Spillane, chairman of the road racing
committee, and his assistants, In this re
gard. .The entrants were confined to
members of the Olympic Club Wheelmen,
Bay City Wheelmen. California Cycling
Club, all of this city, and the Garden
City Wheelmen- of Pan Jose. They fin

on each Bide were put out at first base.
Six San Bernardino men were left on
bases and six -San Diegans would have
been left on bases had not the sixth
crossed the plate and won the game.
There were brilliant plays in almost
every station except that Egan at third
for San Dieiro did not have a chance in
the entire game. Klauber, who played
first for the first time, accepted twenty
three chances without an error, and
Hutchlnson for the visitors accepted twen
ty-one in the same manner. Brockhoff's
seventy-five-yard run for a foul which he
got was the star play, "and there were
others of the same character. The win-,
ning run was made after one man had
been retired. Drennan hit for two bases
down the third base line and Arellanes hit
for a single into right garden on which
Drennan scored. The full score is:

to rattle this "phenom" of a twirler. "I

The San Bernardinos had lost three
straight games to the local players and
Â¦were prepared for the same of their lives.
Every man was on his mettle to take
every chance and to make no mistakes.
In this, however, they were at least
equaled by the San Diegos, for they also
accepted every chance and if the shadow
of an error was made by a player on eith
er side it was saved by some extra effort
on the part of some other player. In a
dozen ways the game was remarkable.
The Ditchers were In to win, and they
have reason to be proud of their efforts.
In no inning were there more than four
men up. Fifty-one men on each
Bide stepped to the plate and only
one man on each side walked to
first. Two 'â¢men on each side were
side sacrificed, forty-five men on each side
SAN DIEGO. March 3.â The San Diego
and San Bernardino baseball teams grave
the cranks of San Diego something to talk
about for years to come by playing what
was in some respects the most remarka
ble game ever played In California. For
two hours and a quarter the eighteen men
strove against each other in an attempt
to pet a winning run across the plate.
Hardly a ball was sent Into the field or
even Into the diamond that did not find
a player there to attend to it. In every
case it was attended to properly and not
an error was marked up acrainst either
of the teams during the fifteen innings
of play.

REAIi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
NEW YORK, March 3.â Tests are being
made at the Sandy Hook proving grounds
with a new explosive of great power, and
ordnance officials say highly satisfactory
results have been obtained. Great secrecy
has been observed in conducting the
tests, as the War "Department has deter
mined that nothing- shall bo made public
of the experiments at the proving
grounds.
It has been learned that the new ex
plosive is the invention of an American
and as yet is not named. This removes It
from., the class of explosives that have
been named and described, and marks it
as something entirely new.
Loaded with the new explosive, a shell
penetrated seven inches of armor and
then burst destructively. With most of
the explosives the heat generated by the
shell's impact has caused it to explode
before penetrating the armor; hence. If
launched against the side of a battle
ship, the shell would prove far less ef
fective than if it penetrated the armor be
fore exploding. As .a test of the power of
the new explosive, a shell was loaded
with It and burled many feet deep in sand
and a huge pile of timber was placed on
top. The same kind of shell loaded with
â¢an equal amount of other explosive, was
not burst by the explosion. With the
new compound, however,- the shell was
shattered into a thousand pieces and a
burst of lurid flame shot up through the
sand and timber many yards in height.
It was Impossible to learn from those
who were familiar with the result of the
tests with the new explosive further"8Te
talls of the trial. Ordnance officials speak
guardedly of the matter, on account of
the strict order of the War Department
that all information about the testa at
Sandy Hook shall come from the depart
ment headquarters at Washington.
It Is known, however, that they con
sider the results as surpassing those ob
tained with any other explosive yet tried.
Much satisfaction is felt that the in.ventor
of the compound * that promises to have
an Important bearing on ordnance of the
future is an American. Â¦

ated. The fracture caused a rupture qf
blood vessels in the brain. From these
exuded blood that gradually formed a
clot, pressing 'slowly but surely upon the
vital parts of the brain and eventually
causing death. In ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred such an Injury as this man
suffered must have Induced immediate
loss of senses, and this exception Is all the
more remarkable.
"So far as I am concerned, I do not feel
entirely satisfied as to the cause given for
the injury. If James had fallen only eight
feet it seems almost Incredible that the
fracture should have been so commin
uted as we found it. The only evidence
we have now is the story that was told
to Will James, who found some of the
sailors in San Francisco last night. Of
course, I do not know of anything that
would give a different aspect to the case
except the nature of the injury as dis
closed at the autopsy. The surgeons all
OFFICIALS TEST

agreed that it would be most remarkable
If the fracture were the result of an eight
foot fall. I. shall ask the transport offi
cials to investigate the case so we may
be sure what are the facts."
James' residence was Jor many years
in Berkeley, where he was prominent in
political circles. He was at one time a
Justice of the Peace In the university
town. His family, consisting of a wife,
son. and daughter,, resided on Woolsey
street, near Calais. Because of his wife's
ill-health. James had temporarily been
boarding with tho Salisburys. That was
the reason he went to their home Instead
of to his own residence.

shows great Industry and wide research. It la
very diffuse and full of repetition. The style
cf the latter is better, but- it seems to have
been written hastily and does not treat the
questions submitted with tha fullness and
clearness which were evidently contemplated
by the donor of the prize, Neither of these

would wish for second prize. After careful
consideration, however, they have decided tO'
award the second prize to Wesley Newcomb

The Question arose In connection with
the nomination of Frank H. Richards as

had moved a reconsideration of the nom

vcied to a consideration of that motion.
Senator -Stewart led the discussion,
which Â¦aras devoted almost exclusively tc
The McKer.zie case. He read affidavits
to 6how that Richards himself had acterl
in the capacity of vecelver In litigated

ly distrustful of Judpc Noyes and pleadei
with tiie Senate to fcermit the nomination

OAKLAND, March 3.â With a frac
ture of the skull that brought
death in a few hour3 Frank W.
James, a timekeeper on the trans
port Sheridan, retained conscious
ness after the reported fall which causei
the injury, left the vessel in San Fran
cisco, and, unaided, went to the residence
of R. R. .Salisbury. 368 Tenth street. In
this city. As he entered the house Jame3
sank into insensibility. Then Dr. Hubert
X. Rowell of Berkeley Â¦was summon*? .1
James was at once removed to a sanitar
ium, but he died at'2 o'clock this morning
without recovering consciousness.
For nearly three hours after he was
hurt James had full possession of his fac
ulties, and had the power of locomotion,
a condition which the surgeons declare
is phenomenal in the history of medical
practice.
The remarkable nature of the case at
tracted a score of surgeons to the post
mortem examination, which was conduci
ed this evening at the Morgue under th.?
direction of. Dr. Rowell, who was assist
ed by Dr. S. H. Buckley, Dr. D. D. Crow-
Icy and Dr. Frank Adams. The autopsy
revealed a fracture at the temporal re
glon and at the base of the brain on the
left side of the head, and so severe was
the injury that the assembled medical
men marveled at the history of the case.
The reported accident which cost James
his life occurred yesterday morning on
the transport Sheridan at the Folsorn
street dock. According to the statement
which was made to Will James, the son
of the deceased, by sailors, he stepped
Into an open hatchway and fell eight fÂ»-et,
striking head first on a pile of lumber. The
injured man was dazed when assistance
reached him, but otherwise gave no in
dication that he had suffered what was
so soon to prove a fatal accident. He
seemed to recover hims'elf so quickly. that
those who went to him did not suspect
lor an Instant that anything serlouj
would result.
"That's all right; never mind me, boys
Go on with your work," was James' re
mark to his fellows as he gathered him
self together after the fall and walke.1
briskly off the transport. He went to
the Oakland ferry, and held himself in
shape so that he was able to 'go to the
residence in Oakland where he had been
temporarily stopping during his employ
ment on the vessels.
He did not lapse into unconsciousness
until he told his friends to send for Dr.
Rowell. Then the external evidence of
the fracture at the base of the brain, the
hemorrhape at the p&ra and Â¦ throat, was
manifested. The skilled eye of the sur
geon saw there "was no hope, but every
thing possible was done to save the in
jured man's life.
At the autopsy to-night Dr. Rowell, his
brother surgeons agreeing, said:
"The case is one of the most extraordin
ary that ever came to my attention, either
in practice or in the books. That this man
should have boen able to retain his pow
ers and faculties with such an injury to
the skull and the brain as long as he did
is simply phenomenal. The autopsy
proves that James was fatally hurt. TriÂ«s
man with death hanging over him not
only was conscious, but could use his
powers of locomotion. That is a feature
of double Interest to the medical men. '
"The explanation Is In the slowness
with which the cerebral hemorrhage oper-

COLUMBIA, S. C. March 3.â Unusuai
revelations are expected Thursday when
the Grand Jury of Anderson County re
ports to a special ?Ht!ug of the court upon
the investigation ordered February 1Â» by
Judge Bennett. The following alleged
facts will be brought to the attention of
the court:
That in the convict penitentiaries in An
derson County were found negroes guilt
less of any greater crime than refusing
to comply with labor contracts which de
manded absolute slavery. These con
tracts should not nave been held lawful
and the nrgroes, though never taken be
fore a magistrate, were by physical force
kept in bondage and made to work as
felon?. The contr.-icts signed by these
ignorant negroes were negotiable papers.
A land owner having a negro bound to
him for a years work could sell his con
tract to a third party.
The attention of the court was directed
to this matter by evidence in the trial
of Charles Newell, a Dlanter, whos^
farms are worked by convicts. Newell
was charged with murder, having shot
Will Hull, a negro trying to escape from
his stockade, when it was shown that the
negro had never been convicted of a crime
before a magistrate or a judge.

David Irwln lived in the light of three
centuries before death overtook him. At
the age of 101 years he passed away to
day at the home of a niece, Mrs. Sarah
Fairbanks of 1014 Twenty-eighth- street,
this city. Had the centenarian lived 1 un
til April 10 next he would have passed the
102 mark.
, Irwin was born In Lawrence County,
New York, in the year l7iÂ»'J. All his life
he had been a farmer, ile farmed the
place he was born on until he was nearly
4'J years oia, when he went to Kent Coun
ty, Michigan, remaining a tiller of the
soil until he came to California a few
months ago for a rest. >'or sixty years
continuously he lived and farmed the
property he settled upon when he went to
Michigan.
Irwln did not marry until he was 37
years old. Since* then he has had three
wives. The tirst one was Miss Margaret
Gunn, the second Miss Mary Douglas and
the third Mrs. Ann Crouch. The last
named he married six years ago In Alle
gan, Mich., when he was 95 years old. His
wife survives him and is 6o years of age.
She had known him for twenty years.
Â¦ Of the eight girls and f our ' sons that
were born to Irwin, all but three of the
girls are living. The oldest is Mrs. Julia
Thomas of Ailegan, and she Is Cl years
of age. The youngest sou, David Jr., is
43 years old.
Irwin was a twin, his counterpart,
whose name was Jonathan Irwin, having
lived and worked with his brother until
he died, about eight years ago. It was
not a natural cause that took the brother
off, but an accident.
In his time Irwin was the spectator of
four American wars and had the honor
to take an active part in each of them.
During ;i:e war of 1312-14 and while he
was still a boy he was connected with the
commissary department of the American
army.- During the Mexican war he
served as a sergeant in a volunteer regi
ment and fought in threo big battles, re
ceiving a severe wound at Resaca dp la
Pama. Again, when the Black Hawk war
broke out he was at the front, fighting
the savages with energy. Though he was
more than 60 years old when the Civil
War commenced, he entered it with vigor
and by bravery won the rank of lieutenant
of the Second Michigan Cavalry, with
which he had enlisted as a volunteer.
The old man voted for twenty Demo
cratic nominees for President and never
swerved from his allecinnce to the party
of his father, who had be^n a Democrat
before him. When Bryan visited Allegan
In October last Irwln occupied the same
platform with him and made a speech
after the Presidential candidate had
spoken. Bryan then took a badge from
his coat and pinned it on Irwin's.

Adolph Dletz. who shot and killed Rose

Friday night and fired a bullet into his
own brain, died at the Receiving Hospital
yesterday morning. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
Case Quickly Disposed Of.
Sheriff George H. Crawford of Del Norte
County arrived in this city last night
with P. H. Gay, a gambler, who shot and
killed M. J. McN'amard in Crescent City,
and who has been sentenced to spend the
remainder of his life in San Quentin. Gay
committed the crime only four weeks ago.
He pleaded guilty in court and was im
mediately sentenced. The prisoner was
kept in the City Prison last night and this
morning will be taken to his last home on

Expert Cracksmen Pry Open. Door of
Small Safe and Secure
rENXETT'S RESTAURANT
ENTERED BY BURGLARS
About $100.
Pctw^n the hours of 1 and I a. ra. yes
terday burg-la rs entered Dennett's res
taurant. 74? Market street, and pried open
a small safe containing about $100, which
money thpy secured. At midnight a pri
vate Â¦watchmnn on the block tested the
front door of the establishment and
pcrutln'zed the interior, but found noth
ing wrong.
The safe is a small one of inferior make
and usÂ»*d only for holdinpr small amounts
of money over night. Entrance to the
restaurant was gained by breaking a lock
0:1 the rear door, and while the transac
tion savors very much of the work of
professionals, the cracksmen evidently
found upon examining- the safe that it
could be opened without the use of pow
der. A strong vise was applied to the ex
terior of # th* supposed strong box, which
offered little resistance, and the hinges
and locks speedily gave -way.
The spoils represented only the after
noon receipts of the house, as all funds on
hand were banked at noon Saturday.
Millionaire "Bill". - Bradbury, who re
cently acquired fame as aji expectorator
in street cars, narrowly escaped serious
injury in the park yesterday. He was
crivjr.g a spirited horse on the speed
track, when the animal took fright, ran
away and dumped the millionaire out of
his road cart just at the gates at the
cast entrance. Excitement followed the
report that Millionaire Bradbury had met
wuh an accident, but after the wreckage
5ia<2 been cleared away and the vhiUm
of the mishap had announced that he was
going hom* for supper matters quieted
oown.
Bradbury left his home, JSOO Van Ness
avenue, early in the afternoon to take a
drive to the Cliff. He sinned on his way
home about 4 o'clock, entered the speed
track and "let hie horse out." The horse
linaiiy "let a little further out." Bradbury
lost control of tho beast and was finally
dumped out. The- horse continued on its
mad run down the main drive. Mounted
Ofticer J. K. Kavanaugh and Policeman
Dow saw th^ horse coming, hurried to the
road and caught the runaway. The cart
was badly w:ecite<J. but upon Investiga
tion It was found that neither Mr. Brad
bury nor the horse were injured. After
viewing the wreck Bradbury said he
would take a car home.
Th* Bradbury accident' was the only
one reported during the day. The crowds
at the park and beach were unusually
large, as they were at the Chutes and
Sutro's Baths. At the Chutes the play

"BILL" BRADBURY
HAS A RUNAWAY
day It is certain that she must havÂ©
struck on one of these rocks and not on
Fort Point Rock, as claimed.
If she struck on one of these rock3,
then she must have backed Into deep wa
ter a few minutes and probably sank in
thirty 'or more fathoms of water. The
conflicting statements made by the sur
viving officers of the rfhlp ar.d the pil'jt
furnish no proof that the vessel ever
hung on the rock on which she struck.
Important Experiment Tried.
After the diver had made two more de
scents in the region where it was thought
the Rio had foundered. If she had struck
on one of the submerged rocks in the six
fathom depth, an experiment was tried
which resulted In an important discovery.
Second Officer Coghlan stated emphati
cally when testifying before Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger thit from the time the
Rio left the nlnc-fathom buoy to come into
port until the warning light of Fort Point
flashed up. just before the ship struck,
that. the direction of the course. was north
east and that It was never changed until
5:19 a. m., when a light flashed up one and
a half points on the starboard bow and
the vessel went on the rocks.
'Pilot Jordan testified that when he heft
the anchorag-e he" set a course northeast
from the lightship until he had the Point
Bonita fog signal on his beam. Then he
changed his course to nortoeast by north
and maintained it for fifteen minutes,
when he continued to naul north. -
The tug was placed in the two positions
indicated and showed that with the course
described by Coghlan the Rio must have
run ashore near Fort Point, while if sh-s
kept the pilot's course she must hare
cleared the red buoy and come safely in

Unable to Reach Mils Rock.
"Although the divers yesterday deslre.1
to meke descents in , the vicinity of Mile
Rock, where they think the vessel struck,
the captain of the. .tug'A.'ert stated .that
the current was too strong for them. to go
down there. If a descent is made at Mils
Rock it must be done lit the early morning
at slack tide.
On the full ebb tide yesterday- the diver
made a perilous trio. He went down fif
teen fathoms on the anchor of the flsh
lnp boat and the tMe was allowed to
drift the boat with the diver toward Mi) a
Rock. The diver remained down for fortv
five minutes and -finally, when the swirl
of the tide was reached after almost a
mile and a half had been traversed, It was
thouKht to be absolutely dangerous for
the diver to proceed further and he. was
ordered to come up.. . ..Â¦
The full ebb tide, running at seven'mlleÂ»
an hour, made it impossible to go further
toward Mile Rock and the divers were
brought back to the city.

BOGAN AND LEVY CARRY
OFF HANDBALL MEDALS
The Olympic Club handball tournament
came to. a close yesterday.' H. W. Bogan
and Louis Levy carried off the hojpors of
the tournament and each will receive a
gold medal for his skill at the game. The
contests yesterday were the best played
during the tournament. The players had
battled their way through the matches
and the best men were pitted against each
other.
H. W. Bogan and T. J. Powers, both
handicap men, were too much for the
scratch men in the first class- and- won
first and second prizes, j Bogan defeated
Powers a few nights ago and it was
agreed that the first named would repeat
his victory to-day. The prophets were
not .wrong, .but were surprised at the
splendid showing Powers made . against
his cleverer opponent. Both men played
a stronc game and the spectators wera
kept in suspense. â¢ Bogan assumed a lead
near the latter part of the contest and
by Â¦ a terrific toss won out. Score 51-34.
Bogan will be awarded a gold medal and
Powers a silver medal. * <
â¢In the second class Johnson and Levv
were the contestants. On J Friday night
last Johnson put McLeod out of the run
ning in a - -, well-contested game. Yester
day afternoon Levy turned the tables on
Johnson and will be awarded first prize.
The game was even more exciting than
that of Bogan and Powers. Johnson took
the lead. Before half the game was over
he had 35 to Levy's 18. The latter pulled
himself together and managed to overhaul
his opponent. Levy then settled down to
work and mrfhaÂ£red to win the game.
Score 51-37. The victor will bo given first
prize and Johnson second.
William Cartwright and "Jack" Gleason
acted as referee and scorer respectively.

IMPRESSED by the work of the Jap
anese divers, who on Saturday tried
for many hours to locate the wreck"
of the Rio de Janeiro, The Call yes
terday placed every facility at the
disposal of the divers in the hope of their
being able to find the spot where the hull
of the ill-fated steamship is resting.
The powerful tug Alert and a large fish
ing boat, with the Japanese aboard, went
out early in the morning to the Golden
Gate and for many hours the divers made
descents In deep water, but without find
ing a trace of the Rio. Nautical experts
and the divers themselves think that the
Rio did not strike on Fort Point Rock,
but that she struck on Mile Rock, near
Point Lobos. On the day of the wreck
Pilot Jordan stated that the ship had
struck on Mile Rock, and this was the
Information sent all over the world. From
the fact that every possible spot near
Fort Point has been explored by the Jap
anese divers it seems almost incredible
that the ship could have struck near the
point.
The divers yesterday were able to work
with far greater ease than on Saturday,
as they had a large "Columbia River
boat," in which they had all their ap
paratus and could row around in the boat
instead of being towed. The first descent
was made by Hayakawa, the sixth of the
divers of the Mori' Company to search for
the RIo's hull. He went down in six and
a quarter fathoms of water at the spot
where on Saturday the sounding lead had
caught. and white paint had been brought
up on an anchor.'
On the run out to Fort Point the cap
tain of the Alert stated that he thought
he could place the divers right over the
spot where the wreck lay. He was given
a chance to do so by the representatives
of The Call in charge of the expedition
and brought his tug up to tho very spot
where the divers had on Saturday fouled
their sounding leads.
Uncharted Rocks Found.
Thls spot Is one mile southwest of the
fort in a direct line. The captain of the
tug entered the boat with the divers, and
when Hayakawa had been under water
five minutes the captain became excited
and cried: ...
"I think he has her; ho remains in one
spot a long time." Â¦â¢â¢ Â¦
The diver remained Â¦ down for twenty
flve minutes, the boat rowing in a direct
line toward the fort' and, reaching depths
from twelve to eighteen fathoms. The
diver proceeded on the bed of the Golden
Gate for more than half a mile and when
ho came up he reported no sign of the
wreck. Most important Information was,
however, gleaned by the descent. It was
learned that the ocean bottom was not
level there, as had been supposed, but that
it was full of big rocks, which at low
water might strike a ship I drawing as
much water as the Rio did. If the Rio,
being out of her course, passed In the di
rection in -which the diver walked vester-
MYSTIC SHRINERS

Every hotel In San Francisco was
crowded to Its capacity last night in an
ticipation of the arrival of the band of
Mystic Shriners now on the way from Los
Angeles. Many of the men who axe en
titled to wear the red flag but were not
privileged to Join the caravan arrived in
the city, bringing tneir wives and children
in order to assist in welcoming the im
perial potentate, Lon B. Wlnsor, at nooa
to-day.
That is to say. If the caravan does not
get sidetracked In the desert and every
thing goes well, the Shrlners will be en
time. Every arrangement has been made
for the comfort of the guests. Oases have
been established at various points alonj.t
the route, and the desert regions will hi
traversed at extra-camel speed, owlns i~
of valuable wreckage from the ill-fated
Rio de Janeiro. Lieutenant Gardiner has
made a thorough Investigation Into the
matter and says that there is no founda
tion for the story.
"A portion of a deck cabin' drifted into
Horseshoe Cove last Sunday morning,"
said the lieutenant yesterday, "and it^was
overhauled by a crowd of fishermen. They
were stripping it of everything valuable
when several of the soldiers put out in a
small boat and drove \ them ' off. The
wreckage was towed ashore and is now
on the beach. .
"One of the soldiers found a pair of
opera glasses, another a set of razors and
a third has a water pitcher. It is said to
be silver. I wouldn't want to buy it for
silver, however. Oh, yes, anpther of the
men has a cabinet photograph of one of
the survivors of the wreck."
F. J. Matheson, a. journalist of New
York City, who > came here- In the hope
of regaining the body of his brother," H.
Cripps Matheson, who went down with
the Rio de Janeiro, visited Fort Baker
yesterday, having heard that a valise be
longing to his brother had been washed
asnore. The soldiers knew nothing of it
other than they had heard that a resident
of Sausallto had recovered a valise. They
did not know the name of the finder.
Matheson is particularly anxious to find
the. valise, as it contains some valuable
papers.
.A dozen or more small boats hovered
around Horseshoe Cove yesterday, the
occupants believing that some of the
bodies might come to the surface and be
carried inshore by the tide. Yesterday
was the ninth day after the wreck and
the bodies of drowned persons generally
come to the surface on the ninth day.
The searchers were doomed to disappoint
ment, for 'When the sun went down none
of the bodlep had been seen.

family, all of whom went down to death
In the wreck of the R.io de Janeiro, were
paid by Rev. Burr -Weeden at the me

Church yesterday afternoon. The services
throughout were of the most impressive
nature. ... . ., . -;:v-
Near the chancel, which was tastefully
banked with lilies and other floral pieces,
sat the- relatives of the family, and
deceased Consul, spoke feelingly of his
heroism in risking his life, possibly to go
back to the purser's safe to search for
tho papers of his Government, after hav
ing'placed his wife and little ones safely
into the lifeboat. He referred to Mrs.
Wildman as "that young woman whom
we all remember so dearly â so good In her
pure motHerhood," and of the children
he asked, "Are not they such as those of
the kingdom of heaven?" .
"The rod with which our Father smites
us is cut from the tree of life." said Rev.
Mr. Wecden. "It is only he who can hold
the soul to his breast and soothe it with
the lullaby of heaven.- The Lord says:
'These flowers. are mine.: I, planted them
and I pluck them.' Let us rejoice to-day
that paradise-, is gathering- up so much
that is attractive. These flowers are
needed there. Then when- we who are be
hind shall enter the gates of that para
diseâthat flowery kingdomâ and ask at
last for our loved and lost, how you and
I shall gather them up! Oh, how we shall
gather them up!"

While numerous friends -.'and fellow
artists were preparing a grand perform
ance for the benefit of Jacob Mueller, the
pioneer musician, the aneel of death laid
its hands upon the Intended beneficiary
and removed him from the need of the
care and attention so freely volunteered
by the kind-hearted people who offered
their services. The death occurred at the
German Hospital yesterday- afternoon.
Though the various numbers
the programme at the benefit performance
were cleverly rendered, it was evident that
the hearts of the performers were not In,
their work. While the death occurred early
yesterday afternoon, it was not thought
advisable to break up th'e arrangements
made.'and but few or the audience knew
at tlrst that while they were convulsed
â¢with laughter or applauding vigorously
the one for whose benefit the performance
was .given was cold in death. When
the news finally became known through
out the hall the members of the audience,
most of whom were personally acquaint
ed with the deceased, were shocked be
yond expression, and throughout the
large gathering place could be heard ex
pressions of the deepest sympathy for the
widow, Inez Fabbri-Mueller.
The benefit was given last night at Na
tive Sons' Hall, and the number of peo
ple present was ample evidence of the
popularity of the unfortunate artist. The
performance opened with a one.-act farce
in German, after which selections were
rendered by the following well known and
clever people: Sidney Smith, Mr. Roland,
Irene Palmer, E. B. Adams, the Water
man sisters, William Hynes, Lillian Levy
and Queenie Tilton.
The "Operetta of Parquerete" was then
given, with the following named people In
the cast: C. Drawer, Kate Krleg, Minnie
Huff and Daisy Bishop.
