though the President retired
last night at the- late hour of
1 oclock after the fatigue of
\ sitting four hours at a ban
quet table, hÂ»Â» was awakened
tit S this morning to prepare for to-day's
ex^rcisfes. He had barely lime for his
toilet and a hasty breakfast before a vast
crowd began to assemble in the streets be
fore the St. Charles Hotel and call loudly
for him. At 9:15 ho was bundled into ; a.
carriage and with the other members of
the party was driven to the Southern Uni
versity, a State educational institution,
where he m*t some prominent colored peo
ple of ICew Orleans as well as colored stu
dents of the university.
On account of the vast throng! in and
around the St. Charles Hotel it was neces
sary to resort to a little strategy in get-r
ting away. The "common" street side of
the hotel -was comparatively clear, of peo
ple and he was seized by escorts "and
hustled quickly out through a side door
and was. seated in his carriage before. the
great crowd was aware* of it. ". He smiled
broadly and good humoredly at the crowd
as he bowed rapidly right and left and
there was a merry twinkle in his 'eyes at
tjie success of the strategem employed by
his escort. While he was passing St.
George, the chimes of that ..cathedral
pealed forth a welcome and a multitude of

'Â¦'-'' k 'S "the President' stood in the o'd Cabildo building, -facing Jackson Square, he was a figure in history apart
A ' "from the 'usual "place on heripa.se* occupied by\the ebi.efs of the' republic. The Cabildo itself was built by the
â¢ /^B : Spaniards one hundred aiid seven years ago and the sovereignty of the soil on .which it stands has undergone
r\ % interesting changes. Louisiana,, settled by Iber.vill.ejn. 1700, after the treaty of Utrecht was given'by the King
A jRk. oV "France "to Antoine Crozart,- who appointed Cadillac Governor, of the province. It leads us back into a far time
" " Â¦ ' - to think" of' that 'domain "beionging'to "onejnjan as a gift and his", appointment- or a^Governor to" rule" it for him!
Crozart could' not make the domain* pay-another thing to. think about-and finding himself land poor gave the
"whole "of it to the notorious John I.aw. who made, it the basis! of. his, celebrated ."Mississippi scheme." l,aw had the genius
'but not the resources; of our modem trust promoters,. and when his speculative bubble burst French interest in the land
declined so "that the King, finding himself unable to.make a gift of it to individuals stick, in 1762 by secret" treaty conveyed it
all "to Spain! The next r year.by a treaty between France, Spain, Great Britain and Portugal all of Louisiana east of the
Mississippi from its source to the rive'r Ibervillc. thence along the channel of that river and through the middle of Lakes
" Maurepa's and" Fontchar train, 'was ceded to Great Britain. This treaty declared that Louisiana "extended as far aa the
sources cf the' Mississippi/ easterly and westerly. ; The part west of the .Mississippi, remained in the . possession, of Spain
.until 1S01; '.when by :the treatyVof St. . Ildefonzo it ; was reconveyed to France. ! This treaty was kept secret for fear, that
:Great Britain would' seize the '-territory as < spoil from'France.V After ;the treaty of 'Amiens,- which' made a ; temporary
I peace "between France and England. | the loss of San- Domingo lessened French" interest in j Louisiana and made " the na
tives averse to -French- dominion.- but Napoleon determined "to makeit a French colony and ordered Marshal. Bernadotte,
the founder of the^dynastyiOf'Swedeii, with.5000 troops, ; to.go'out and take possession. War with England broke out
again and Bernadotte refused 'the commission,' whereupon Lausat was sent to New Orleans as chief prefect, but the
- sovereignty. was still' in' Spain. Â¦â¢ - â¢ Â¦]Â¦Â¦'"'. '.Â¦".* .' - ' i_ jf . , . Â¦
" About that Uime Governor Claiborne of Mississippi Territory was enraged by. the action or Spain In closing the
ports ofNew Orleans and Mobile- to >' the deposit'of American goods.. Tn 1S03 he wrote Â¦ Madison. Secretary of State:
"Excitement in the Territory is -very .great. -.It if; the general sentiment that the treaty has been grossly violated, the
comity of nations disregarded, our people materially injured, and tiie United States insulted. I have in this Terri
tory 2000' militia well officered and as full of national pride as any men in the Union. I have on the Tombisbee another
regiment who are burning to resent the obstacles imposed by the Spanish comandante. With these forcesâ yes, sir, with
Â¦= S0O of my menâ we can take possession of New. Orleans and expel or disarm the Spanish garrison." In fact. Governor
. Claiborne was spoiling Jfor a fight, but had to.spoil. , _Â¦_
. ' . About that time President Jefferson wrote to -Mr.. Livingston, our Minister at Paris, a remarkable letter, which is in
â¢ teresting now, in. view, of .our political conditions. Jefferson said: . :
"The day that -France '.takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence which is to restrain her forever within low
water mark; It-seals the union of /two nations who. in conjunction, can maintain exclusivve possession of. the ocean.
.. From ' that .moment we must marry, ourselves to the British fleet and nation. Wo must. turn all our attention to a mari
timeforce and, having' formed and connected together a power, which may render reinforcement of her settlements
â¢ here impossible to France, make the first cannon that shall be fired in Europe the signal for tearing up any settlement
'she may -have made and for. holding the two continents of America in sequestration for the common purposes of the
united British. and American nations." 1 :
... This was a. cool proposition to pirtition North and South America between tho .United States and Great Britain!
But circumstances .change, policies.; Bonaparte preferred â¢ to make the United States and Great Britain rivals rather
'than allies and to Livingston's overtures for our ; purchase of Louisiana at once responded. The treaty of purchase was
signed in -Paris, "the tenth day of.Florcal, in the eleventh year of the French republic! the 30th of April. 1S03." by Mon
roe Livingston and. Marbois. Warlike Governor Claiborne after all took New Orleans, but did not need 800 men nor his
reserve force on the Tombisbee. -He and General Wilkinson were the American Commissioners to receive Louisiana from
â¢Â¦the: French. Â¦ - Â¦-.- â¢:.Â¦-Â¦ Â¦ ;'â¢ . â¢ .
December 20, 1S03. therSpanish comandante. Lausat the French orefect. Claiborne and Wilkinson met In the Ca
bildo building. The' Spaniard, -by virtue of the treaty of St. Udefonzo, formally transferred the sovereignty from Spain
to France and, the Spanish flag was hauled down and the French flag went up. Then Lausat, by virtue of the treatv of
Paris, handed! the sovereignty over, to the United States, the French flasr came down and the stars and strides took its
place, and Claiborne and Wilkinson; adjourning to the Place des Armes. now Jackson Square, proclaimed the United
States as sovereign of the soil.*. In air history them has been no other as rapid change of sovereignty. In one aour the
people were the subjects of Spain, France, and this republic. .Jefferson had intended to appoint Lafayette Governor Gen
' oral of ,the province, but our relations with France had changed his plans and Claiborne was made Governor General cf
-'. "Louisiana with all the executive. l^gis!ative. and judicial powers of the Spanish comursdante. So it came to pass that

.CHICAGO, May 2.â The Tribune to
morrow will say: Chicago capitalists and
millions of Chicago money are to develop
the resources of Mexico until the southern
republic becomes one of the Important
factors in the world's trade. .Silver mines,
supplying two-thirds of the silver of the
world;' coal fields hundreds of miles In
extent; great reaches of Iron and other
ore lands; thousands of acres of cotton
and great grazing lands dotted with
cattle are to be made the objects of the
impulse of Chicago money.
As a first step in this direction John J.
Mitchell and Levl 'Â£.. Leiter have been
elected to the directorate of the Mexican
Central- Railroad, i
Bonded warehouses, heretofore unknown
in the republic, are to be erected at the
City of Mexico and at Vera Cruz. Under
present methods the Mexican importer Is
compelled to pay duty on his goods the
moment they are landed. In the United
States imports may be stored until they
can most opportunely be realized on 'and
disposed of.
The concession unOer -which these great
warehouses will be erected grants the
rights for forty years. Into this enter
prise alone it is estimated that from $4.

be placedL â¢

Aside from this island some of the best
naval authorities hold that the Gulf of
Caraico, on. the north coast of Venezuela,
offers by far the most advantageous site
for an American coaling, station if one is
to be located in that part of the world.
In view of the reported -German surveys
in that quarter the naval authorities here
are showing unusual interest in the points
available for American use. The State
Department never has been called upon
specifically to construe the Monroe doc
trine so far as it might relate to attempts
by. a European Government to secure a
coaling- station in the Gulf of Mexico or
the Caribbean * Sea.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â Although thb
matter never haa figured before the State
Department, the Navy Department has
been closely watching the happenings
near Margarite â¢ Island, off the â¢ coast, of
Venezuela, which has given rise to the
report that a German coaling station Is
to be established there. These facts have
been" reported to the department by some
of the naval officers who commanded ves
sels which have cruised In those waters
recently. Last year a German warship
spent ten weeks in looking Into the possi
bilities of Margarite Island, and this fact
led to an examination on our own ac
count, which developed the s presence In
this important strategic point of one of
the. finest" harbors in South America, the
possession of which would afford the
United States or any other nation with a
navy practical control of the Panama
canal from the eastern shore. -

When he had concluded the "President
appeared on the balcony to show himself
to the waiting thousands outside. The
cadets below presented arms and the
square and the buildings surrounding it
fluttered with handkerchiefs and flags,
while the air was torn by the hoarse roar
of the shouts of the multitude. The Pres
ident made an impressive figure as he
stood there waiting for the cheering to
subside. He acknowledged the demon-
I rise only for the purpose of twaklnsr ac
knowledgment to the Louisiana Historical As
sociation for its cordial and generous welcome
to this historic place. It has been a (T9at
honor to be received here by the Governor- of
this great commonwealth, by the Chief Justice
and his associates of its highest court, by the
Mayor of the city, to this place, memorable
not only In American annals, but In the annals
of the world. I am glad to Â¦ stand near by
where that great transaction took place which
transferred the Louisiana territory to the flay
of the stars, a transaction which changed the
map of the world and made this union what it
now is â the atronjreRt and the freest nation on
the face of the earth. . '
The reception to-day was held In the
room devoted to the use of the Supreme
Court of Louisiana and under the auspices
of the Louisiana Historical Society. The
President entered the chamber escorted
by the Supreme Court Justices, dressed
in their somber gowns, and they and the
President were seated on the bench under
a canopy of red plush. The chamber was
redolent with the fragrance of roses,
large banks of them being situated about
the room. There were 300 men and wom
en present to greet the President, and
most of them were members of old creole
familiesâ the social aristocracy of Louisi
ana. President Foster, of the Historical
Society- delivered an eloquent address*,. In
which he proudly reviewed the history of
the State from its Infancyâ sven from the
time when De Soto descended the mighty
Mississippi in guest of the El Dorado, and
from a later period, when La Salle plant
ed the banner of France and took pos
session in the King's name, christened the
great river St. Louis and gave to the
country the name of Louisiana. President
McKinley responded briefly, saying:
Hence the treaty of Paris was signed
just ninety-eight years ago last-Tuesday.
On November 30, 1803, the formal transfer
took place, theihistorlc event happening
in the Cabildo, whÂ«re President McKinley
was to-day received.
On October 1. 1800. Louisiana was retro
ceded by Charles IV of Spain to Napoleon
Bonaparte. Louisiana thus returned to
her French nativity and bo remained for
two years, but on April 30. 1803, the treaty
of Paris was signed, whereby the entire
province" of Louisiana was sold to the
United States for $12,000,000.
After a look into the interior of : the
cathedral, where the President reverently
uncovered his head, the party entered the
old Cabildo, an ancient structure standing
by the side of the cathedral. It was for
merly the home of monks and prelates of
the church, but was afterward converted
into a court building. Erected in 1772, it
hap stood ever since a solid and enduring
monument to the massiveness and stabil
ity of Spanish architecture. It passed
through all the trials and vicissitudes of
changing ownership: twice it was French,
onrfc Spanish, once Confederate and twice
it has been under the United States nom
ination, and four flags of as many differ
ent governments have flaunted from the
.iackstaff in Jackson square in front of it.
There the "governing council" held sway,
and there were tried and sentenced the
unfortunate victims of the La Freniere
insurrection, later to be, shot to death in
the Place d'Armes for Seeking to prevent

a royal, earnest and hearty welcome.
This will afford an opportunity, rarely en
joyed.: tor us all, ' and more especially for. the
school children, to see , the President of the
United States, {one who holds the highest ex
ecutive office, within the gift of the American
people, and- It will .be an event and epoch in
their lives they will never forget.
After a careful estimate the committee finds
that it will require from $3000 to $3500 for the
necesÂ«ary expenditure, etc.
Feeling: that you are in sympathy and full
accord with this movement, and hoping that
you will contribute as much as you conve-i
nlently can to the fund, the undersigned or
their authorized representative will in a few
days call on you for your subscription. Very
respectfully yours, JOHN MITCHELIi,

FEVER CLAIMS
MANY VICTIMS
IT Is estimated that on the 18th of
this month, when the battleship
Ohio Is launched from the Union
Iron Works In the presence of Presi
dent McKinley and the members of
his Cabinet, that possibly 50,000 peo
ple will witness from the shore the
Initial plunge into the briny of the latest
addition to the country's naval strength.
The Market Street Railway Company is
now wrestling with the problem of how to
handle the vast crowds that will journey
to the Potrero. In the course of a few
days General Manager Vlnlng will Issue. a
special circular showing the facilities that
the transportation company will have to
offer to the public on the day of the
Ohio's launching. ;"â¢ Â¦ ;
The Union Iron Works are situated
about three miles from the ferry building
In a direct southerly line. Jw.ffi
roafis run to the Potrero, where the iron
works are situated. One Is known as the
"Kentucky-street" line and the other as
the "Sixteenth-street" line. The Ken
tuckv-street" line runs from the Third
and "Townsend street depot, across tne
drawbridge at Channel street and so on to
the Potrero. The "Sixteenth-street" line
runs from Fillmore and Bay streets, along
Flllmore street to Sixteenth and along the
latter street to. the Potrero. Â¦
Although only two .lines run Into the
Potrero, It will be an easy matter for resi
dents in all parts of the city to reach the
Union Iron Works on the day the Ohio is
launched.
"Ways to the Launching.
All persons living in the Western Addi
tion will have to take either the Fillmore
street line or come downtown to Kearny
street and continue by the Kearny-street
road to the Iron works direct. Those liv
ing west of Fillmore street will take the
Fillmore-street line to the iron^ works,
Â¦while those who reside east of Fillmore
will take the downtown lines to Kearny
street and proceed by the Kearny-street
line to the Potrero, or by the Fillmore
rtreet line if It is nearer to their resi
dence. *â¢
Residents In the Mission district, south
of Sixteenth Btreet, will take the lines
crossing Sixteenth street and proceed by
that line to the scene of the" launching.
Mission residents, north of the Sixteenth
street line, can either take the Sixteenth
street line or the Third and Kentrky line,
whichever may be convenient to them.
It will only be possible for the Market
Street Railway Company to run a certain
number of cars over the portion of the
road in the vicinity of the Potrero, other
wise the cars would be "stalled" on ac
count of the lack of power on that section
cf the line. The question of what lines
will run direct to the launching and points
of transfer will be announced in a few
days bÂ»' General Manager Vining.
The new double-ended cars of the road
vrlll accommodate 150 persons each and
with a rapid "headway" and a few hours'
of travel the Market Street Company ex
pects to take care of all comers.
The management of the Union Iron
Works warns the public that only holders
of special Invitation cards will be ad
mitted to the place on the day of the
launching. A large force of men will be
on duty at the gates to keep all but In
vited guests out of the works. : - .
The hills and roads in the vicinity of the
iron works will afford ample room for
many thousands to see the warship glide
Into the bay. Grandstands are now being
erected close to the ways and others will
be built In the course of a few days. Many
of the choice locations on Kentucky
street, from where the launching can be
witnessed, are at present rendered useless
by the unsightly billboards of a firm of
billposters. II these eyesores were re
moved thousands of persons could witness
the launching with little difficulty.

A committee representing- the commer

their power to prevent thfi bringing of the
disease into tha United States.
Official reports received by the marine
hospital service 6how that typhus fever
has been Increasing in the City of Mexico
with alarming: rapidity. The announce
ment published in the public health re
ports lor March 15 showed one death from
this disease. Since then each week has
shown an Increase, until the report pub

deaths for the week. It is In view of this
condition that Surgeon General . Wyman
has directed that special precautions be
taken. 'Â¦
Quarantine' regulations have already
been In force against- Mexico to prevent
the bringing in cf small dox, yellow fever
and other diseases. . and no action was
necessary on part of the surgeon ge'neral
but to call special .attention to the preva

In view of all these facts It is more im

enough to slip in the navy yard trip it
could be taken from the passage from this

it that way and no particular preparation
to receive it. Besides, the railroad offi

are no stiff grades on that route, and the
rails are heavier and better for such a
heavy train as h that of the President.

bring the President past Vallejo Junction,
where a stop of two hours would enable
him to cross the straits and Bee as much

PORTLAND WILL
HAVE A HOLIDAY
Business in Town Will
Be Suspended During
Stay of Chief Magistrate
PORTLAND,. May 2.â At a recent meet
ing of the executive committee appointed
to take charge of the arrangements for
the reception and entertainment of Presi
dent McKinley and party next month thÂ«
finance committee was directed to raise
$5000. It Is not believed that the expenses
of the reception and entertainment can be
met with a smaller sum. This fund will
cover everything â carriages, . parade,
badges, decorations, hotel accommoda
tions and the expenses of a committee to
mtet the Presidential party at the State
line. It will also cover the erection of
seats or benches on the park blocks for
thfc accommodation of the public school
children, who to the number of 14,000 will
have the honor of reviewing the Presi
dential party parade.
It was decided to request the people of
Portland to observe the afternoon of May
22 as a holiday and make suitable ac
knowledgment of the honor of a visit
from the chief magistrate of the nation by
decoratings their houses and raising the
stars and stripes.
Ii was not deemed advisable to make
further effort by wire to induce the Presi
dent to prolong his stay or make the Co
lumbia River trip, but instead j Mayor
Rowe was authorized to appoint a com
mittee to meet â¢ the President at San
Francisco and lay the matter before him
there. It is believed that the trip to the
mouth of the Columbia River can yet be
given, when once the President is gtven
to understand that It can be made without
loss of time or a break In the Itinerary.
The sub-committees appointed up to
dote, which are already at work upon the
portions of the programme assigned them,
are constituted as follows:

roads announce to-night that they will

tee has fifty carriages to escort the party

My fellow citizens: I have great honor !n
standing on this historic ground to receive the
greetings of my countrymen and to recall ths
fact that here nearly a hundred years ago a
great scene was enacted that indicated a
larger area than \he original thirteen States
to liberty and union forever.
The Presidential party then returned to
the hotel for luncheon. After a brief rest
the party was taken for a boat ride on the
Mississippi. Mrs. McKinley accompanied
the President. Returning to the hotel at
5:39. the party soon afterward' resumed
their trip westward.
Scenes similar to their reception of yes
terday marked the journey to the railway
station, and the train steamed away from
New Orleans accompanied by salvos of
artillery, the ringing of bells and the
cheers of a. vast throng of people.
IN all the round of sightseeing- pro
vided for \ the entertainment of the
President the navy yard at Mare
-Island seems to have been passed
unnoticed. More than once the peo
ple of Vallejo have tried to bring the
matter to the attention of the com
mittee In charge of the week at San Fran
cisco, and each time their efforts have
conic to nothing. For one reason or-an
other the triD has been kept out of the
programme.
Senator J. J. Luchstnger of Vallejo has
written to The Cull calling attention to
the efforts of the people of Vallejo ~ar.il
suggesting that the trip to the yard be
made part of a trip around the bay, a
feature Included In the original-plan, but
later practically abandoned. . The trip
around the bay was held for Thursday
morning in the "event that the weather
should spoil the view from the top of
Tamalpals, but It was never intended that
it should extend to Vallejo.
In his letter Senator Luchsinger says
that the people of Vallejo stand ready fo
render any assistance in their power, and
he declares the visit could be made One
of the most pleasant of the President's
trip.
The navy yard at Mare Island 13 one of
the largest and best equipped naval sta

The arrest of Crill vris one of the most
peculiar nieces of detective work done In
this State. Crlll, for the last thirty days
prior to April 28, had been stopping at the
Topeka Avenue Hotel in Wichita, but
made short trips to neighboring cities to
establish magazine dubs.
About a week after Crill arrived a man
Â¦who registered as E. F. Greiner appeared
at the same hotel. He claimed to be a
land agent from Illinois. He seemed to
take a great liking for Crill. and. it is
said, lent him money several times. Al
though Greiner claimed to be a' real estate
man It was known to the Wichita police
that he had formerly been Chief of Po
lice in Burlington. Iowa. He said he was
familiar with many crooks and was al
lowed to look over the papers <n police
headquarters to see if he recognized any
of the descriptions of men who were
wanted.
Plies Crill With. Whisky.
Last Wednesday Greiner and Crill vis
ited several saloons and Crill was sup
plied with whisky until he was helpless.
Greiner insisted on taking him to the ho
tel but instead of putting Crill. Into his
own room the Intoxicated man was lodged
in Greiner's room.
Greiner. after putting Crill to bed. went
down and got more whisky. At 4:30 the
following morning L. H. Holt, who roomed
with Greiner. was awakened by i a sharp
roise and saw Crill sitting on the bed with
a set of handcuffs on his wrists and
Greiner and a strange man that he nad
never seen before standing in front of
him. The stranger had on blue clothing
snd seemed to be an officer of some kind.
He had a revolver in h!s hand and had
Crill covered with it. They made Crill
Ftar.d up and Greiner searched him and

head under the hair and one on his neck
and a large gold filling in one of his back
teÂ«=-th. Greiner said:
"This is your man. If he is not John
Dunham then I don't know him."
Taken Away in a Carriage.
The man was then taken downstairs
bv the two officers and that was the last
Holt saw cf Crill. The officers and their
prisoner, after leaving the hotel, went to
a livery stable, engaged a double carriage
and drove to Newton, thirty miles distant.
The driver savs the officers talked but lit
â¢tie during the drive and that the prisoner
elept most of the way. Greiner returned
to Wichita on Friday, but staved only
leng enough to leave orders to have his
and Crill's mail forwarded to San Jose.
So secret was the arrest that neither
preÂ« nor police knew of it until v^rlll had
been landed in the California Jail. Crill's
wife is still in a very .serious condition
CHILD STRICKEN
DEAF AND DUMB
Paralysis Attacks Ten-
Year-Old Girl at
Redding.
REDDING, May 2.â While standing be
fore a drainboard, engaged in wiping
dishes and apparently as happy as most
10->ear-old girls generally are, little
Esther Rollins was suddenly stricken
deaf, dumb and motionless this morning.
The '<=hock of paralysis came in an instant
and the child gazed vacantly at the com
panions with whom she had been corners
lag g^yly a few seconds before. There
was r.o" movement of the body.
The children who were with Esther were
preatly frightened and created consterna
tion in the household of Mr. and Mrs.
James Rollins, the parents of the girl,
vl-.o live in West Redding. Dn S. T.
White was quickly summoned. The girl
was carried like a log to her bed and the
physician did his best for her. It Is be
lieved that she will survive the shock and
that the paralysis is but temporary. The
physician says the stroke was caused by
a hemorrhage in the brain, probably the
result of an injury to the skull. It Is
thought possible that a blow from a stone
!n the hands of a boy when the girl was
much younger may have been the cause
cf the stroke.
told to-day by a Call representative that
Mrs. Crill at Fort Scott, Kans., had given
birth, to a child he called .the reporter
aside and asked particulars and said his
mind had been relieved of a great burden,
but when confronted with the report that
he was a bigamist Crill became enraged.
He would neither deny the charge nor an
swer any question, but threatened both
bodily injury and prosecution to | those
making such a charge.* Â¦ Later he asked
that nothing be said about it.
If Crill was regularly divorced there
could be no reason .for these actions, and
this has led to the belief that he has led
a dual life. Crill has been tendered all
klnds.of positions as soon as he is allowed
to go, for many realize his power as a
drawing card. One saloonkeeper has of
fered him $150 to tend bar for a week.
DENTES SHE IS DIVORCED.
Mrs. Dora Crill Says That Her Hus-
band Deserted Her - About
Seven Years Ago.
DENVER, Colo., May 2.â Mrs. Dora
Crlll, the wife of the Dunham suspect un
der arrest at San Jose. Is most emphatic
in her denial that she is divorced from
Crill. She says that they have been sep
arated since 1894 and that for a Inns: time
she lost trace of her husband. She claims
that Crill could not have very well se
cured a divorce from her without serving
her with a copy of the complaint and
summons. No summons or complaint
were ever served on her nor to her knowl
edge was there any attempt made at ser
vice by publication. Mrs. Crill, whose
maiden name was Dora Schreiber, Is liv
ing at Cripple Creek. She is very uncom
municative and declines to state lust what
steps she intends taking, now that she has
learned the whereabouts of her husband.

Crill's Former Father-in-Law â¢ Tells
About the Suspect.
SAN JOSE, May 2â A special to the
Mercury from the Pueblo (Colo.) Chieftain
says: ?
"Crlll was married here in Oetober, 1SS7.
We cannot get the exact date to-night.
M. Schrieber, father-in-law of Crill, says
Crlll lived in Pueblo and the surrounding
cities six or seven years after his mar
riage. He was a man at fine business
ability, but drank to excess. He was
mixed up in several shady deals while
intoxicated and he was kept out of jail
by his father-in-law putting up mdney.
The couple separated about seven years
after the marriage, but the father-in-law
Bays Crill was in Pueblo in 1S96 at the
time of the murder." *

TACOMA, May 2.â Tb/ Tacoma Smelt
ing Company has purchased of the Sather
Banking Company of San Francisco, late
ly disincorporated, the valuable twenty
five acres formerly known as the Pacific
Mills Company's property, adjoining the
smelter property, for $22,500. The adjacent
tide lands have been bought, giving a fine
additional water front of 1200 feet. Upon
this new property an extensive copper
plant and lead refinery will be built.
Plans for buildings are being drawn.
The new plant will enable the smelter
to turn out ore bars, carrying gold and
silver ready for the assay office or mint,
whereas the present product is copper
matte carrying- 50 to 60 per cent copper,
which has to be sent to San Francisco
or Montana for refining. The capacity of
the smelter will be increased from 400 to
700 tons of ore dally. It Is now handling
300 tons a day and will smelt 400 a day
as soon as a blower for the fourth blast
furnace arrives. The present force of 300
men win be doubled.
The total cost of the new plant, includ
ing the site and wharves, will be nearly
$500,000. The smelter is controlled by D. O.
Mills and other large stockholders in the
Treadwell, Bunker Hill and Sullivan
mines.

CBJUL EXPECTS KEU&ASE.
Speculators Now Want Him for a
Saloon Drawing Card.
SAN JOS^ May 2.â Charles F. Crill will
be given his freed om in a few days. While
the Sheriff's office Is reluctant to admit
that the man is not Dunham, this fact has
been pretty conclusively proven. The
public is satisfied he is not the murderer,
but believe he Is wanted somewhere else
for an offenseâ probably bigamy.
A stream of people poured into the Jail
again to-day and only about a corporal's
guard of these hundreds were bold enough
to assert that the suspect was Dunham.
Then these few were not positive and
those who thought he resembled the
Campbell murderer would hesitate about
going v on the witness stand to swear it.
The others declared he was not Dunham.
Most of Crill's story as to his where
abouts is being substantiated. People
who knew his uncle at Flagg Station, Ill
have questioned him and state he tells :
straight story. Former residents c
Rockford, 111., and Pueblo are of the same
opinion. There Is no doubt Crill mar
ried Dora Schreiber at Pueblo in 1887.
Father Leggio has established this fact,
and to C. H. Shumate, who conducted a
grocery store there, Crill related incidents
that happened there In 1S94 that only one
who was there could tell.
Crill Is still detained at the County Jail,
but this detention will be short. He" said
to-day he had no doubt but they would
release him. , Those who have critically
examined Crill, among whom, are scores
who knew Dunham by sight, are con
vinced he is a victim of his own re
semblance to the fugitive. While a pris
oner in name, Crill is given freedom inside
the jail and no one interferes with him
going from room to room.
Sheriff Langford is not yet satisfied with
the proof that Crill is not Dunham and
will hold him a few days longer in the
hops that some one may turn up who can
account for Crill's whereabouts in May,
18S6. This is done on advice of District
Attorney Campbell. B. F. Greiner, who
caused the arrest of Crill, still cherishes
a hope that the suspect is Dunham. To
him it is a matter of dollars and cents.
Greiner will be out about $250. When
Crill is turned loose he will be given
money for his expenses and trip back to
Kansas. The grold for this is now in the
hands of Sheriff Langford and was placed
there in the shape of five twenties before
that official would bring Crill here for
identification.
There is little doubt Crlll Is wanted
somewhere, else. Hie refusal to talk of
his marriages infers it is bigamy. His
memory is bad, or else he does not want
to remember. Last night Crill declared
he obtained a divorce trom his first wife,
a Miss DoTa Schreiber, whom he married
in 1S97 end. a few months later he mar
ried again. He refuses to give the
grounds on which a divorce was. obtained
or the exact date. He separated from his
first wife In 1893 or 1894 and at that time
Mrs. Crill No. 1 resumed her maiden name.
Of his second wife Crill is dumb. When

The stranding of the steamer Willam
ette in the Narrows while on a trip to
Comox on March 16 of this year was in
vestigated yesterday by Captains Bolles
and Bulger, United States Inspectors of
Local and Foreign Steam Vessels. Cap
tain Hansen. Chief Engineer Martland.
Assistant Engineer Thomson. First Mate
John Dlxon and Second Mate Henry
Johnson were the witnesses.
The testimony was to the effect that
the officers tried to run the steamer
through the Narrows in a fog. The fog.
however, closed in so thickly that tne ship
ran upon a reef and lay there for four
davs and a half with "a broken back.
Engineer Martland testified that the
steamer struck at 1:24 in the morning. He
was on watch, as he was at all times
when going into port or passing through
narrow or . dangerous places. There was
155 pounds of steam on and the vessel was
making five and a half knots per hour.
TJnder~the same steam pressure the ship
could have made ten knots if required.
There were no casualties.

AFTER playing faultless baseball
for ten Innings the Dudes suf

and strain and went to pieces- In
the eleventh,, which, gave the
Senators the game. Until thÂ» last toning
the quality of the playing was of the very
finest, both Moskiman and Doyle receiv
ing superb support for their excellent
work in the box. Several times the game
was saved to either side by brilliant field
ing or clever work of the bag guardians.-
Try as they would, neither team could
send a man over the rubber until the elev
enth Inning. In the tenth the Senators
made every show of scoring, but failed at
the crucial moment. A throw by / Dun

work of the latter in putting out. Stanley
retired the side when a run seemed im
minent. : : Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ : .-. â¢â¢: Â¦-..-;-'
The last inning had tb<? Dudes on the
rack. Courtney journeyed on free trans
portation, and when Francks committed
one of hjs egregious j blunders, allowing
McLaughlin a base, he was safe on sec
ond. Then Hanlon hit to Moskiman, who
thought he had time to shut out Â¦ Court
ney going to third, but the umpire called
them all safe. Doyle, who was next up,
hit to Arrellanes, who errored, and Court
ney scored. With the bags full Stanley
drove a fierce one to right field and Held

WITH all the play on Hagerdon
to win the free handicap over
six furlonsrs. at Oakland yes
terday, the bookmakers were
still selling tickets at 9 to 5
around bugle call time. The track was
heavy and slow, which just suited the big
horse. He skimmed by *Dr. Cave early,
w.nning about as he pleased In 1:16. Frank
Bell ran a disappointing race under Ber
gen, dropping the place to Dr. Cave by a
couple of lengths, palpably demonstrating
the track was not to his fancy. Prejudice
was also disinclined to participate in the
festivities, a fast track being his strong
est suit. Rio de Altar clung to stable tra
ditions, running last.
Not many of the different winners es
caped backing from the crowd, evea if
three choices did fail to connect- Com
panion, Barney F and Gusto, comprising
the surprise trio, were by no means
â¢ eagle birds" for the books. The attend
Â£2>et continues good, with plenty of busi
ness for the fourteen pencilers.
In the introductory sprint Companion, a
Schreiber cast-off, upset calculations by
coming from behind with Russell up and
btatincr out the well backed 15 to 1 shot
MatlMa O. The latter mare did not get
away from the post any too well or she
would have earned the verdict. Merida,
played down to 11 to 5 favoritism, ran dis
appointingly, finishing far back at the
wire.
Tompion, a bay youngster, by Altamax,
took tne maiden two-year-old dash. His
price receded from even money to 8 to 5,
and leading from the jump Ransch landed
him first, less than a length before Pres
tene. Learato' ran third.
On form Mamie Hildreth and Screenwell
Lake looked best of the seven starters for
the mile selling purse. The former filly
had first call in the bettjjng, but Ransch
Â¦was compelled to stay. In next .the rail,
where the footing was "deepest, and she
ran third after leading into the stretch.
Barney F'. a 10 to 1 shot, in front almost
the entire route, won- cleverly by ' two
lengths, while ScreenweJl Lake nosed the
favorite out for second position.
Ab Stemler's smart filly PhylHsviefeat
ed a fair bunch in the second two-year
old spin. Always a warm choice, she
riiiickly went to> the front, leading Porous
toy the judges with little to spare.
Tyranus. the second choice, was third.
A seven furlong selling affair closed the
racir.g. Although looking big' and high
after his let-up. Dr. Ro well's Imperious
was installed favorite. Third for a time,
he then fell back from the firing line.
Gusto, ridden by Jack Martin and 7 to 2
in the ring, after making all the play ran
in a length ahead of the 40 to 1 shot For
matus. The latter hefrse showed marked
improvement.

THERESA LOUGHREY SAYS
HER HUSBAND IS BRUTAL
Testifies in Her Own Defense Befor9
! Judge Slossâ In the Divorce
Court.
Joseph Loughrey, manager of a Post-
Street glove house, appeared in Judge
Sloss' court yesterday to prosecute his
suit for divorce from Theresa Loughrey.
Loughrey charges his wife with cruelty
and , infidelity, which she denies. Mrs.
Loughrey also makes charges against her
husband, which, if proven, will entitle her
to a decree and an alimony judgment. ;
Mrs.- Loughrey testified yesterday that
two days after, her marriage her husband
forced her to go out and seek employment
as a domestic. She labored, she claims,
as a domestic for six months, and then, as
her husband refused to support her, went
in search of more agreeable employment.
They finally ' quarreled, Mrs. Loughrey
continued, and as her husband refused to
admit her to their home she threw a
missile through the window, for which of
fense she was arrested.
They then took their troubles to the di
vorce court, but when the case was called
some months ago for hearing Mrs. Lough
rey was taken ill. She was removed to
the City and County | Hospital, where a
child was born to her,, but during- all of
her suffering, she said, her husband re
fused to offer her aid or comfort. : .
Further testimony will be heard v next
Tuesday.
. Decrees of divorce were granted yester
day-to Julia Cllne from William P. Cline
for desertion, Jennie Clark from Edward
R. Clark for failure to provide, Minnie B.
Harris from Edward W. Harris for deser

Defeats Neustadter in
Some Remarkable
. Otto Feudner, the crack trap shooter,
defeated N. H. Neustadter in a special 100
bird race at Ingrleside yesterday. He not
only won a dinner for sixteen devotees of
the sport; but established a record that
will stand for a long time on this coast.
Feudner actually killed 100 straight, but
four of the birds got over the line before
toppling over. Neustadtei - 's sh'ooting was
also of high, order. -Had he not become
nervous near the close of the match he
would have won out, as the handicap of
five birds was to his advantage. He had
the match well in hand up to his eighty
fifth bird. Nervousness then affected him
and he missed three out of five birds.
Both men shot from a thirty-foot rise.
They were in good form and the birds
were a fine lot. Feudner losf compara
tively easy blrd3 and nailed the hard ones.
Neustadter killed forty-seven out of the
first. fifty, and Feudner forty-nine. It took
two hours to finish the match, and- the
scores are the best ever made on the coast
in a lOQ-blrd match. with a thirty-yard
rise. Neustadter will dine his friends on
Tuesday evening next, and among the
guests will be Henry Stelling Jr., who
refereed the match, and Achilles Roos and
George Jackson, who acted as scorers.

FATE IN D OUBT
CAMBRIDGE Mass., May 2.-Altho'igh
the greater portion of the proceedings at
the Eastman murder trial to-day was
taken up in unimportant expert testi
mony, there weie one or tv/o witnesses
who proved to be important. The day's
proceeding^ ended with an ; effort on the
I>art .of the Attorney General to obtain
the admission of the testimony Eastman
gave before the Grand Jury which indict
ed him. The court withheld. its decision.
The most Important witness of the day
was the aged and decrepit mother of Gro
gan. She tottered feebly into the court
room i*nd told of an instance where East
man looked toward her son . ana re
marked :*"'Hls' days are short." This was
a . little over a week before the tragedy.
Two witnesses who were recalled Identi
fied the bullet exhibited at the -trial as
the one taken from the body of the de
ceased. This iast testimony will have a
strong bearing on the case of the de
fense should it be claimed that the bullet,
which has been frequently shown to the
jury, was changed some time after the
autopsy by somo Government official.
Should, the Government's plea for the
admission of the Grand Jury testimony
be overruled to-morrow morning, it is
likely that the case against Eastman will
rest there and that the defense will then
be begun.

President Bond, before taking his seat
gave a : statement of the affairs of the
association, chief of which waa that the
packers' company had not kept their
promise to provide money to meet a divi
dend as they had voluntarily agreed to
do. â¢ Further, he said that the company
was claiming the commission on all the
prunes in the warehouses on May 1 and
that it was not entitled to this until the
fruit was sold. He said the company had
also demanded that the prunes be re
moved and if the association had no place
to put them they could be stacked out of
doors. All these demands he resisted and
he was advised that they could not be en
forced under the contract.
President Bond ruled that nothing could
properly come before the convention until
the roll had been called. It took until
1:15 o'clock in the afternoon to do this
without any recess. At that hour recess
was taken until 2 p.m. It was then an
nounced that only 360 members had re
sponded to their names, but the president
ruled that he would not hold strictly to
the by-laws, which seemed to require a
majority of all the members present, and
that nominations could . be made. All
names regularly nominated, he said,
would be submitted to the annual meet

THE LATE QUARTERMASTER'S
PURVEYOR OP TRANSPORT SER
VICE. WHO DIED SUDDENLY.
Gould Line to Enter Plttsburg.
There is another serious side to. the flght. The
Pennsylvania has been trying to prevent the
entrance of the Gould lines into Pittsburg. A
recent dispatch from that citv stated that the
Wheeling and Lake Erie would not be so ex
tended, but that the Pennsylvania would allow
Mr. Gould favorable trackage rights over the
Baltimore and Ohio. . â¢ :
It is officially stated to-day that, this offer
will not be accepted, but the Wheeling road
will be extended into Plttsburg as raoidly as
possible. This will, directly benefit both the
Wabash and the Missouri Pacific, giving them
a large steel and Iron tonnage. Mr. Carnegie,
before selling out to the steel trust, made a
contract to deliver a vast amount of his ton
nage, aggregating more than one million tons a
year, to the Wheeling road. Mr. Carnegie was
himself to build an Independent line to tide
water, presumably Baltimore. He is understood
to have made an offer for the. Western Mary
land road. Now, it is asserted, Mr. Gould in
tends to carry out some such plan in order to
prepare for any fight that he may have wlthtthe
Pennsylvania and Vanderbllt people.'
Mr. Gould has further irritated William K.
Vanderbllt by planning an extension to the
"Wheeling road to the vicinity of Cleveland.
When the new link of the Wabash in Northern
Indiana and Ohio is built the Gould system will
have a direct line from Cleveland to Chicago,
paralleling the Lake Shore all the way.
Flans Made- Tears Ago.
Mr. Gould's plans, are furthered by the back-
Ing of Mr. Harrlman and Stuyvesant Fish, who
are the leading factors In the Illinois Central.
The Illinois Central has a direct line from Chi
cago to Sioux City and Omaha, furnishing a
connection with the Union Pacific at the latter
point.
Several persons recalled to-day the surprise
that was expressed two years â¢ ago when the
Illinois Central announced its intention to build
into Omaha, It was thought at that time that
the Illinois Central,- a Harriman road would
sooner or later supplant the Northwestern as
the eastern outlet of the Union Pacific's north
ern division, while the Missouri Pacific is the
outlet for the Kansas division of the Union Pa
cific. If the Gould and Harriman faction win
the contest for the control of the Union Pacific,
the plans referred to two years ago would seem
to be prophetic and It would appear that
Messrs. Gould and Harriman began mapping
out their great scheme a long time ago. ,
need of standing shoulder. to shoulder as they
have to-day. It is believed they are acting in
close harmony in the matter of the control of
Union Pacific and Atchison.
If the enormous buying of Union Pacific has
secured control of that property in the Interests
pf the Northwestern. . New Tork Central and.
perhaps, St. Paul, there is no necessity for con
trolling the Atchison, but If the Union Pacific
has been lost to Gould and Harriman the heavy
accumulation of Atchison to-day would Indicate
that that company is needed as an outlet to the
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt lines.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Commercial
Advertiser says:
Friends of E. H. Harrlman assert with much
confidence to-day that the syndicate of which
he is the head has not lost control of the Union
Pacific Railroad. This claim Is significant, be
cause persons closely identified with'the Harrl
man syndicate have repeatedly declared within
the past three days that they could not tell
anything . about the situation. The confidence
manifested by Mr. Harriman's friends to-day is
baaed largely on the supposition that In the
competitive buying of last Tuesday the Gould
and Harrlman - Interest secured enough of the
Union Pacific shares to restore their holdings
to the majority point. -
Discussing' the Union Pacific situation,
the Mall and Express has the following: .
From the current tremendous market move
ments in - Union Pacific and AtcKUon â big: ad
vances occurring in each to-aay â It became clear
that a fight Is going on between great money
interests over the establishment of transconti
nental systems.
It now appears that this fight centers around
the plans of George J. Gould and J3. H. Harrl
man to establish a vast network of roads from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and William
K. Vanderbilt and the Pennsylvania Railroad
people, seeing what was up, have made up their
I minds to frustrate them. . ...
With the Gould and Harrlman people on the
one hand are said to be Kuhn, Loeb & Co., who
are identified with the Union Paelfla manage
ment, while Mr. Morgan Is believed to have
lent his influence to the Vanderbilt and Penn
sylvania forces. The Rockefellers, who are
identified with Mr. Gould in the Southwestern
deal, are said to have stood aloof from the
Union Pacific Incident, and to have done noth
ing which could be criticised by Mr. Morgan,
with whom they are associated in many affairs.
Pennsylvania Buys Atchlson. /
Continuing, the Mail and Express says:
Following the discovery that Gould and Harrl
man wanted to control the Union Pacific, carry
ing with it the Southern Pacific, it became
plain that the Missouri Pacific and Illinois Cen
tral might be substituted for the Chicago and
Northwestern as the Eastern connection of the
Union Pacific, thereby greatly injuring the Van
derbilt position in the West.
In order to protect the Northwestern and New
Tork Central Â¦William K. Vanderbllt started to
accumulate a large amount of Union Pacific,
and Gould and Harriman, learning pf this, also
bought enormous quantities of this stock.
Meanwhile the Pennsylvania, having lost the
Burlington to the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern, also had to fix up its "Western fences.
It bought large quantities " or Atchison. This
road gives a through line to San Francisco out
of Chicago. Good authorities assert that the
Pennsylvania began buying Atchison stock
many months ago, but did not think. it was
to get enough' stock to exercise con
trol. If need be, until the Gould and Burlington
deals develop.
Now, it is, asserted, both the New Tork Cen
tral and the Pennsylvania, which entered into
a close alliance two years ago. never had such

adds: "It would be premature to hazard a conjecture
as. to what department of science will furnish the dis

THE people of Vallejo, through their officials
and most representative citizens, have made a
petition which .should receive the earnest con
sideration and hearty indorsement of the committee
of San Francisco which is planning to welcome Presi
dent McKinley. The people of, Vallejo ask that dur
ing the stay of the chief executive in this city some
arrangement be made by which he can visit Vallejo
and inspect the magnificent governmental station' at
Mure Island, the largest en the Pacific Coast and one
of the greatest in the United States.^ Vallejo agrees
to bear the entire burden of expense and to submit
itself to the discretion of our committee in every detail
of arrangement. / -
This plea is eminently " just We are asking" Presi
cent McKinley to be among,us not simply to feel our
good will and to accept of our*"good cheer but to see
what we are, what'.part we are playing in 1 , the Â¦ great
scheme of national life and what we need that we may
play our part welL It it good- that he be the honored
guest at our feasts and festivals,' but it is better" that
he should carry away with him a^permaneht impres-*
sion of our vast natural and acquired resources.
Among our triumphs is the naval establishment" <?t
Mare Island, : which should be encouraged, preserved
and improved.
A visit of a few hours, a pleasant journey and. a
brief inspection will suffice to. impress upon the Presi
dent, his Cabinet and guests fronj the national Legis
lature the importance of the establishment at 'Mare
Island. In the whirl of receptions,;speeches, dinners,
parades and entertainment which for six days will
rule San Francisco, surciy.a few hours of festivity can
well.be sacrificed to a cause 'in which the entire State
is vitally interested and in which the nation is .con
cerned. The petition of Vallejo should be granted. â¢
A* DUTY TO THE PRESIDENT.
LORD KITCHENER'S I HARD TASK.
LORD ..KITCHENER -in the prosecution"' of
scientific war against the Boers .is. said- to^haVe
divided the territory of the seat, of war into %
series of .squares . liker a chessboard and to have
placed. a troop in each- square '".with orders to clear it
of the enemy or devastate it/ A recent review of the
operations says: "The country: is ruled out into
chessboard squares. To and fro over each a mounted
force equipped with light transport is projected and
withdrawn, like a gardener! s rake. It is not- a process
conducive to the clashof arms, but as the movement
is repeated again and again it draws into the central
ppsts a vast accumulstion of living beingsâ white
families and. black families, horses and cattle, food,
forage. and weapons of war. It leaves the squares as
bare as unsown fields."
The description sounds- well, and it would seem
that such tactics carried out by an energetic, foe Would
soon bring the Boers to terms. As a matter of facV,
however, tlje squares are ."so large and the foe so nim
ble tHat "the rake" rarely brings 'in-any considerable
number of them. Kitchener is capturing a large num
ber of non-combatants, but the warriors of the .Trans
vaal are still free and have their arms.
For an understanding of the situation it ista be
borne in mind that according to a statement. of Lord
Roberts the area^of the disturbed country comprises
about 250,000 square .miles. .If, therefore, Kitchener's
chessboard.squares contained an average of 250 square
miles each there .would be a thousand of them, and
Â£s he has only about 200,000 men at his disposal there
would be only 200 men to each" square. As a consid
erable number are required to guard.the railways and
the supplies, the force available for 'raking cannot be
sufficient; to bring the war to a speedy conclusion.' 1
The-British, indeed, appear to have abandoned ail
expectations- of an, early close of . the war. A cor
respondent of therLqndon Standard, writing from
Pretoria and describing a conversation with a num
ber of. Boers -who --entered the .British'. lines with a.flag
of-truce toobtain the body of an officer who had'bejin
kilkd, says : "They". acknowledged : that . the' outlook
is bad enough, but maintained they are not without
hope of -wearing us. out, adding that in any case they
mean to fight to the end or until terms were offered
which would leave them with a modified indepen
dence. If that be true of the mass of the Boers still
in armsâ some . 20,000 o~ moreâ and there is every
reason for believing that it is, the sooner the rein
forcements^are here the better. The task that faces
Lord Kitchener is as heavy as it is possible to con
ceive:" >Â¦ Â¦'Â¦Â¦'.-''â¢ ' r . ' Â¦-â¢'Â¦â¢.. : ~'-- -.â¢''. â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦:.!

SAN; FRANCISCO and Oakland present a view

'and exhort.
For years in each city an annual deficit has appeared
at the end'of each fiscal year. It is sometimes partly
provided for by shutting off street lights, but usually
it -is made up, or partly made up, by compelling the
school-teacliers to work, a month or two without pay>
during which time the public schools are run not^at
the expense of / the 'taxpayers or the patrons ; but at
the cost of the- teachers.' We are not aware-thait.it
is ever proposed that any other city employes' )hall
give their services to the public. The .pay,- of;;the'
teachers is the least- for service TenderedJin^any.'',de
partment of city administration. by. the
hardest toil performed by any ,pub'lic ' servants. ';It
goes mostly to women, who have the slightest; means
of defense against imposition, and therefore are hot
formidable in the eyes of the practical'.politicians -who.
run city governments. * Â¦'Â¦Â¦ " 'â¢' j-
The Oakland situation has features that are pa
thetic- In years, past the teachers have often been
compelled by their masters, the City Council, to work:
without compensation }n order to keep th~e schools
open "the 'full v schopl year. When the time, came last
year to estimate. the- n.eedslof the' city, that the Coun
cil might make a .tax levy; to nie.et them, the School
i'Bbard submitted its estimates of 'the money required
to run the. schools to the end of the 'schooUyear.
Giving no credit to the judgment \ of!-, the "School
Board, the Council deliberately cut the estimate to a
figure which was known to be 1 inadequate. for the
purpose. When the school year' was within two
months .of 1 its, dose the money was all gone, and the
two. High' Schools "must be shut or kept open at the
expense of the teachers. I ,;â¢,â¢â¢ v ; -rÂ»
.But in .the schools are the classes which -were to
graduate. They cannot : do so if the _ schools^' close.
Upon the completion of their course) and 'regular
graduation depends" their' entry into the universities.
Closing 1 the "school means' waiting a! year beyond the
time^at jwtiichj they expected to * fimsh^To a large \
number this has a most malign and. unconciuerable in
fluence, and is a misfortune which may spoil' their,
whole career.. >The people are passing around the hat
and trying- to xollect $10,000 in a dime at a time to
keep the schools open and avert the blow to the pupils
and the-city, and also -to spare the city the shame of
running the schools at the expense of overworked and
underpaid teachers: All this because a City Council
threwmbney at: birds, -in litigation and boring wells'
-to find a brackish'" wate*? supply to be put undef.'mii-.
nicipal ownership. . ,.-.. .'
In San Francisco It has been "the -regular thing to
meet deficits by making teachers work for nothing
and refusing to pay contracting merchants for sup
plies furnished- to theory departments.
There is a constantly accumulating debt to the mer
chants and obligation io the teachers, which will prob
ably never be paid. The situation, is disgraceful to
fcctri cities and testifies the, inefficiency, cowardice or
demagogy of: the .members, of their. government who,
are responsible for it; j % ; â¢ .
Next time. the Oakland School Board sends its es
timate to the City Council the citizens who are now
holding distress meetings and passing the hat for
nickels to keep the schools running should go to th;
City Hall and read his political .death warrant to.
every Councilman who prppos$s 5 to cut .it. down,-in

half a year. Their scant furnishing was

REDWOOD CITY, May 2.â A three
nights' entertainment, commencing to
night, was begun this evening by Bonita
Parlor, Native Daughters of the Golden
Wc-st, for the purpose of adding money
to the park Improvement fund. Over a
year ago the Native Daughters obtained
permission of the Board of City Trustees
to beautify what is known as California
Square. . â¢ . â¢ -
With this laudable end in view they
commenced giving a series of entertain
ments, which" have proved very popular.
In this way many . hundred dollars have
been raised. With the money already pro
cured the unsightly trees on the square
have been cleared off and the block filled
in with two feet of rich earth and the
place put into condition for planting. It
is now proposed to plant lawns, trees and
flowers and to make the place an attrac
tion to the townspeople.
The large gymnasium on the old- school
grounds was secured, there being no other
place in the city large enough to hold
the crowds. To-night there was a grand
ball, refreshments of all kinds , being
served in booths erected in the large hall.
Friday night's programme will consist of
a musical and literary entertainment, fol
lowed by a social dance. Saturday even-
Ing there will be 'a mixed entertainment
and a sale of fancy articles. On each
evening: a ballot box will be Â¦ open, in
which all who desire may vote on the

Senator McLaurin of South I Carolina to
task for what he declares is his political
flop. At the same time Mr. Bryan ad
mits that Senator McLaurin's action
marks the beginning of a. movement In
the South which will have an influence
upon the politics of the nation. He says:
It is not likely that Mr. McLaurin will be
the leader of the movement because he is
handicapped by the fact that he is using his
official position to misrepresent the views and
interests of his constituents, but some leader
will arise to give direction and force to the
aristocratic and plutocratic element for which
Mr. McLaurin speaks. There is such an ele
ment, in^ every community, and now that tne
race question no longer unifies the white peo
ple of ..the Southern States , it will doubtless
manifest, itself. . â¢ .. ...
Senator Tillman has already taken up the
gage of battle thrown ' down by Senator Mc-
Laurln and will doubtless be able to marshal
a considerable majority in that State, but the

cess. ' .. â¢ Â¦ .- Â¦Â¦ i . Â¦

BRYAN ON SENATOR
M'LAURIN'S CHANGE
LONDON, May 2.â There was a
large attendance in the House of
Commons to-day in anticipation
of the discussion on the new ex
port tax on coal. The Govern
ment had issued an urgent "whip" to the
Unionist members, who were largely
pledged to vote against the tax.'
The full House and galleries had to
wait until nearly 6 o'clock for the begin
ning of the debate.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal,
led with a severe, almost violent, arraign
ment of the Government. He said the
tax would throw .the coal trade ; nto chaos
and confusion. It was nonsense to say
the foreigner would pay the tax because
he would not do without coal. The Gov
ernment of Italy had answered -hat plea
by taking coal from America instead of
this country. The trade. of France was
equally divided between this country,
Germany and Belgium. '
The Chancellor of the Excheauer, Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, Interrupting, said:
"We are beating the others."
"Then go on beating them." said Sir
William Vernon Harcourt. "Why throw
a shilling into the scale against this coun
try?"
Sir William contended that it was class
legislation and that the tax would ulti
mately come out of the miners' wasres.
No Danger From Competition.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer admit

LOST CHILD DIES

Pathetic Fate of a Five- Year-
Old Girl in Wash,- .
ington.
PROSSER, Wash.. May 2.â With her lit
tle hands and mouth all stained with
green from the grass and flowers she had
eaten in her desperate hunger and with
her features drawn In the dying agony
of thirst, the body of the 5-year-old
daughter of W. B. Mathews. former
County Commissioner, who was lost on
the dreary wastes of Horse Heaven plains
nearly a week ago, was found to-day.
The child In her agony had crawled into
a badger hole on the prairie and with her
arms outstretched had died. From the
appearance of the body the child had been
dead about thirty-six hours, so for five
day* and nights she had been without
food and water. \V ,. *Â». ' , ~
The girl with her 7-year-old brother left
her father's ranch one morning to hunt
cattle. In some way during the day the
children became separated. When the boy
returned home In the evening without bis
sister thÂ« alarm was at once given and
searching parties organized and scores of
men on horseback have been scouring the
purrounding country day and night ever
since.
Barefoot when she left home, the little
girl in her wanderinsrs had bruised and
cut her feet and had gathered the tou_h
prairie grass and wound it around them
for protection. Beside her In the badger
hole lay a bunch of flowers and crass
â¢which she had been eating. The place
where the child was found was fullv sev
enteen miles from the ranch and not far
from the lone Springs.
obstruction on trade. The real question
was. Could the export trade In coal bear
the tax? It could. English coal was ot so
good a quality, there was so much of it.
and it could not be got in any other
country. Thus to a large extent it was
free from competition. â¢ *
The Chancellor submitted masses of sta
tistics which he summarized as showing
that 225,000,000 tons were mined in 1900 on
which, after deducting Â£18,000.000 in wages
more than In 1897. the coal owners had a
net profit of Â£29,000,000 on a capital of
Â£110,000,000. He had some difficulty in
keeping his patience when deputations
talked to him' about the unprofitable con
dition of the trade. He had proposed the
tax for merely one year and it would be
on those who were able to bear it. As to
the competition of the United States Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach said:
"Last year the price of our coal at the
port of export rose very much higher than
the price of coal in the United States, but
in spite of that our export of coal was 38,
000,000 tons, or 3.500,000 tons more than the
previous year. The United States exoorts
a little over 1,600.000,000 tons; if the United
States could compete when the price of
our coal was very high It would be ab
solutely Impossible for them to compete
when the price was low." â¢ . Â¦> Â¦
John Redmond, the Nationalist leader,
said the coal tax did not affect Ireland;
and in that respect it was the beginning
of a new era. On general principles, how
ever, he urged the Irish members to do
everything possible in their efforts to de
feat the budget. The debate was ad
journed to Monday next, 1 when according
to the arrangement a division will be
taken. â¢
MINERS MAY NOT STRIKE.
what Modified.
Opinions of the Leaders Appear Some-
LONDON, May 3.â Yesterday Mr. Bal
four was determined to get a vote on the
coal tax before the House rose, and he
rejected Sir William Vernon Harcourt's
private appeal for a postponement. At a
late hour, however, so manV members
were anxious to speak that the Speaker
gave it to be understood that lie would
not consent to an application of the
closure. â¢ The Government was therefore
reluctantly compelled to yield.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach's strong and
effective speech is defense of the tax de
lighted his colleagues. At the same time
It was felt that he gave an unsound argu
ment when he pleaded the enormous
profits of the coal owners as a justifica
tion of the new tax. It Is pointed out
that the Radicals used the same argument
when demanding the taxation of ground
rents, and- that if large profits justify a
tax lean profits would equally justify
state assistance.
The prospect of the miners persisting in
their determination to strike appears this
morning doubtful, consideration of the
matter for twenty-four hours having
somewhat modified the opinions of the
leaders, but no reliable indications are yet
available.

Z BERLIN, 'May 2. -The German Embas
sador in Washington, Dr. von Holleben,
has reported to his Government that, ow
ing to the sudden Increase in attacks up
on Germany in the United States from
many different quarters he called upon
Secretary Hay to ask him for an explana
tion. Baron von PUclithofen, the present
Secretary o^. State for Foreign Affairs,
and his predecessor, the present Chancel
lor, have been keenly alive to the growing
bitterness of sentiment in the United
States' regarding Germany. An order
went out from here to the Embassador at
Washington to pay a visit to Secretary
Hay. The situation, they say, is becom
ing serious. Â» Â¦ . ' .
The following Is an Interview in which
one of the highest officials in Germany
answers, very direct questions on -the sub
ject of United States hostility with
equally direct replies. I had ' asked
whether Germany had really . a' "parti
pris" against the United States. His Ex
cellency replied: y . ,. -^ -}-.:Â¦Â¦
. "We know of the, Hi feeling against Ger
many existing in the United . States. It
has been reported to us by our Embas
sador. We cannot imagine what ground
there can be for any such sentiment
among the people of the United States."
\ Wants Peace With America.
-"But is ; there not some justification for
the talk of Germany interfering with tho
spirit of the Monroe doctrine?" I asked.
. "We are not alone in that," he said em
phatically. "If German subjects are mal
treated or their property and rights in
terfered with we simply do" just what all
other nations would In a similar case and
protect them. This we did by sending two
vwarships to Port au Prince. Nothing is
further from the policy of Germany than
to interfere with the United States." â¢ â¢
"But you do all you can to stop Ameri
can meat?" . ' y
"There have been difficulties; but they
were brought about, by. the Agrarian
party. They are not serious."
"You have grievances against the
United States?" I asked his Excellency
next. % ' Â¦
"Small ones, also," he e replied. "Weâ
that is to say, our merchantsâ have cus
toms grievances."
"Germany is credited in America with
an ambition to possess a port in the
Philippines?"
"There is not a word of truth in It.
There was at the time of the Von Diede
richs incident. â¢ It is forgotten. It was a
mistake. Why, if we want a port in the
far East, we have the Carolines and
plenty of other islands to choose from."
Not Drifting' Toward War.
"And may I ask your Excellency what
you think of Admiral Dewey's prophecy
that America's next war is to be with
Germany?" , - . . .
. Then, sweeping away a look of pain,
he s-miled and, with surprise, replied:
"I really cannot possibly understand it.
"Why, there is not a single question un
settled between the two countries. " There
is not a misunderstanding of any kind.
"While I ask you not to mention my
name, I give you full authority to say
that this is official and that Germany has
not the "least "desire to quarrel' with the
United States; that she, on the contrary,
wishes in every way to cultivate friend
ship and good relations with the United
States, and can see no reason now why
they should not exist."
"Many of tho American public consider
Â¦ that you are waging a war of aggressive
vengeance and territorial acquisition in
China. Do you . not think there is some
thing in that which arouses the feeling
against 'you?"
'Germany's policy In China is to give
Â«"4ual rights to all countries. We wish
' to insure < the payment of the Indemnity
and then get out as soon as possible. We
only claim $60,000,000. America will have
Just as good commercial rights In China
as Germany or any of the other powers."
Â¦ "Is "the augmentation of the German
navy aimed at the United States?" I
asked, changing the subject. '
! "Not one atom of it. That programme
has been open to the world. It is to pro
tect our commerce, nothing more. We
1 would, like a much greater navy, but can-.
' not have it."
GERMANY'S SUSPICIOUS COURSE
Washington Officials Disposed to Dis
; ,:.i :^-*-*: trust the Kaiser., :Cc
"WASHINGTON, May 2.â Though F.m
bassador von Holleben had an interview
with Acting- Secretary of State Hill, to
day It is learned that no reference was
made to recent developments regarding
Germany's attitude toward the United
States. In fact, it is stated on authority
that the German Embassador has recent
ly addressed no inquiries on the subject
to this "Government.
If Embassador von Holleben has re
ceived instructions to ask for an explana
tion he is unwilling to make them public.
Embassy officials regret that Germany's
policy has been a matter of such bitter
comment in this country and they Jn&lst
that Germany entertains only the kind
liest intentions toward the United States.
Their statements are at variance, how
ever, with the views of officials of the
administration. Germany's attitude dur
ing the war with Spain was not conducive
to strengthen the relations existing be
tween the two Governments. Her sur
veys of islands In the Philippines, infor
mation concerninc which reached " this
Government, were .most suspicious and
she was deeply interested in the islands
of Sibutu and Cayagan, Sulu, and.it is
even said that she was responsible for
representations made by. Spain , to this?
Government which resulted finally in their
purchase. The United States and Ger
many have pursued antagonistic policies
in Chinaâ one leaning- toward mercy in
order to' better effect a settlement, the
other insisting upon extreme measures
unless forced to abandon them by a com
bination of. powers in opposition. Â¦ - The
naval war. board sees in Germanv'c col
onization in South Africa, in her frequent
surveys of West Indian islands and in her
aggressive commercial policy reasons for
the United States acquiring a 3trong
n_ivyÂ« " â¢â¢Â¦.Â¦â¢Â¦/
There is not an official - in "Washington
who wants war with Germany. "War with
Spain-would not have occurred, they say,
!had the United States been so powerful
on the sea as to convince the ? Madrid'
Government of the folly of failure to com
ply with American demands. A naval of
ficial of high standing predicted to-day
that if Congress authorized an Increase of
the . fleet . which would make the >United
States the eaual of Germany on the sea
no friction which could not be settled dip
lomatically, would arise.

FREIGHT CABS BLOCK THE WAY
Ferry Slip at Foot of Second Street
Cannot Be Used.
Two freight cars laden with machinery
went into the ferry slip at the foot of
Seccnd street yesterday, and in conse
quence the freight steamer Thoroughfare
could not dock there during the day. The
acrident was caused by an engineer back
ing: his train too fast. The heavy cars
went on to the apron with a rush, and be
fore the train could be started ahead the
apron gave way and two cars went into
the bay. A gang cf men was at once put
to work clearing the obstruction, but it
will be Saturday probably before the slip
can be used again.
In the meantime Sdl the Southern Pacific
Company's freight is going and coming

the accident.

wharf, while the transport service will
take possession of Howard No. 3. The
bulkhead between Folsom and Howard
will be fenced in and all buildings now
congregated around the Folsom-street
landing will have to be moved. The
chances are that the Harbor Commission
ers will move the float to the dock be
tween Howard 2 and 3, 60 the boatmen
will not be inconvenienced very much.
The transport Lawton went on the dry
dock yesterday. She will be followed by
the Samoa to-day.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
i * . Â¦ N old-time cracksman, who holds
1 /\V a cons Pi cuous place on the criml-
ZA\ nal calendar of San Francisco,
A. W. has just come to grief in Chicago
and is almost sure' to round . off
his career in prison with a long-term sen
tence in the Illinois penitentiary at Joliet*.
Chicago papers mention the arrest by, the
Hyde Park police of "Pap" Jones, aged 5S
years. Inspector Hunt in speaking of the
capture said:
"I think I have the captain of a gang of
four cracksmen. I am satisfied that Jones
was in the gang that robbed the safe of
Felichenfeld Bros.' store, because a paper
found on him shows where a division of
$600 between four men had been made."
' Intelligence of the arrest. was conveyed
to W. A. Pinkerton in San Francisco, who
advised Captain John Seymour, Chief of
Detectives, of the capture. At first Cap
tain Seymour did not recognize that the
man taken was Edward Fagan. - The name
"Pap" Jones was misleading, but mem
ory was refreshed when the given name
"Edward" was mentioned.
Edward Fagan, alias W. L". Jewett,
whose true name is believed to be Edward
Jones,' hails from the State of Connecti
cut. In 1S69 he robbed the safe of Neu
berger & Co.. brokers, on Montgomery
street, San Francisco. . He was sentenced
to San Quentin for a term of five years.
On the expiration of his term of servitude
he went to Placer County and was there
arrested for burglary. He gave the name
of W. L. Jewett. Another term in State's
prison was set down to his account. De
siring to investigate other prison resources
of the. coast he went to Oregon. and com
mitted burglary. In this northern enter
prise he assumed the name of James Hay
den. He was sent to the Oregon State
Prison in November, 18S3.
Early in 1888 he was again a free man
and his inclination impelled him to return
to scenes of burglarious activity in San
Francisco. Without wasting much time
in pursuits of idle enjoyment, he resumed
the business by opening a safe > in the
South Park Brewery. With his usual Ill
luck he was captured and again assigned
to another term at San Quentin. He was
discharged in 1893. There is no indication
that he Is sharing largely in the current
prosperity, as the "mem." found in his
pocket credits him with only $200 as his
share of J the spoils derived from the last
burglary in Chicago. . . ,

FATHER DROWNS' HIMSELF
AND FOUR CH.MiT>RE~S
Body of One of the Victims Recov
ered From the River Near
Fort Snelling.
ST. PAUL, Minn., May 2.â The body of
the 9-year-old Rosenfleld boy was taken
from the river near Fort Snelling to-day..
This is believed to confirm the police sus
picion that William Rosenfleld drowned
hia four 'children and himself one week
ago. The crime was most brutal. The
father abducted the children, who were in
the custody of their mother at Minne
apolls^and securing a rig drove with them
to the river. .
William Rosenfleld, the father, had been
separated from- his wife, who lives in
Minneapolis. Rosenfield lived in St. Paul.
One week ago Rosenfleld hired- a buggy
and took his children from relatives who
were keeping them. He tried to prevail
on his wife to accompany him, but she
refused. The next morning the horse was
found wandering by the river side. The
body found to-day was positively identi
fied. A systematic search will now be
made to find the other bodies.

being unable to reach an agreement on
the wage question, all departments of the

dred men are affected. The East Helena
plant being the only custom lead smelter
in this part of- the country, its closing
may , result in the shutting down of nu

BUYS NEW COAL FIELDS
Ten Million Dollars Invested in ths

ATHENS. Ohio, May 2.â From an au-
thority which seems indisputable there
comes the information that almost the
entire coal industry of the Hocking and
Sunday Creek valleys will come under the
management of the gigantic combination
of capital of which J. P. Morgan is tLe
head. A conservative estimate of the
amount involved in the deal approximate
ly places it at from $7,000,000 to $10,000,000.

VALPARAISO, Chile. May 2.â The new

to receive the visiting delegates of the
New York Chamber of Commerce. Be

YOKOHAMA, May 2.â In consequence
of the continued postponement .by the
Japanese Minister of Finance, Viscount
Watanabe, of the carrying out of the ex
pected public works, the Cabinet crisis
reached a climax yesterday. Marquis Ito,
the Premier, after the Cabinet meeting,
proceeded to the palace and tendered hi3
resignation to the Mikado. P "\ ' "-
All the other members of the Cabinet
did likewise, with the exception of the
Minister of War, Baron Kodama. ' It is
asserted that Marquis Ito advised Em
peror Mutushito to entrust the task of
forming a new Cabinet to Marquis Yam
agata, whose government resigned last
October, but it is doubtful whether Mar
quis Yamagata will accept the responsi
bility. The probability is . that. Marquis
Ito will reinstate the Cabinet, â¢ excluding
Viscount Watanabe. 1 .

W., "WASHINGTON, May 2.âNotwith
standing the efforts of the administration
it 4 seems that the powers are determined
to exact an indemnity from China in ex
cess of Â¦ that which she . can reasonably
pay: Following the calls made by Em
bassador Cambon | of France, Mr..Rogest
vensky, representing the Russian Embas
sador,-and other diplomats vupon Acting
Secretary Hill to-day It was learned that
the authorities here feel assured I that the
report- that the Iuitid sum of indemnity
to be demanded has been fixed at $273,
000,000 is correct. This represents a com-:
promise between the exorbitant amounts
originally claimed and the limit proposed
by the United States. What powers have
reduced their claims is not kjiown, but
as the claims have all been liled the in
demnity will be distributed among the
powers ; probably according ; to their
amount, the extent of damage suffered
and the number of troops which'partici
pated in the operations in CHlna.
Two questions which are corollary to
that . of indemnity are under discussion.
The first is: What measures shall China
take to raise the money "necessary to pay
the indemnity? Second: As China must
nave time in which to comply with the
indemnity demand how shall she guaran
tee payment?.- ..
â¢ It Is erroneous to suppose that the
United States is opposing an increase in
the customs tax. it approves the idea,
butinsists that, the' tax shall be uniform
and that it shall- not be applied in such
manner as 'to -benefit any particular coun
try. .Â« Under, his instructions Mr. Rockhill
is seeking to. secure either an abolition or
modification of the "likin" tax.
No agreement has been reached as to
the. manner in which China shall, make
payment. Â¦ It is conceded that she must
have timeâ some 'say ten years â and It is
probable that she will float a loan. . The
authorities. fear that Germany will be dis
inclined to withdraw her | troops until
every penny of the .indemnity has been
paid. This question will be a subject of
serious discussion by the powers/ ' !

W., WASHINGTON. May 2.â Great Brit
ain will bÂ© required to pay indemnity to
American citizens expelled from the
Transvaal If it can be established that
they took no part in military operations
against the British. These claims, includ
ing that of a man named Brown, whose
mining* concession and property were
taken from him by the Government of
the South African republic, amount to
several million dollars.
Ths instructions sent to Embassador
Choate direct him to call the attention of
the British Foreign Office to the claims
and ask for an investigation.
The British Government has declined to
discuss wjiat are known as the Atlin
claims, on the ground that the persons
who filed them axe British subjects and
their redress is before the British courts.
The claimants allege- that they are Amer
ican citizens. Their claims, growing out
of the seizure of their property and the
confiscation of their mines in British Co
lumbia, amount to $15,000,000. The British
Government" alleges that before the men
obtained possession of their claims they
took out preliminary papers a3 British
subjects. The men admit that they swore
to some papers, the exact character of
which they did not grasp. The State De
partment is taking no action in the mat
ter. ?

the spread of the disease they were sent
to Uie island. All danger of contagion Is
row considered over and they will be sent
to the Philippines on the Lawton.
The Thirty-flfth Volunteer Infantry was

With Music and Song.
The "camp concert" given last evening
by the American-British Rifle Corps drew
a large audience in the annex of the Me
chanics' Pavilion, and an enjoyable pro
gramme was presented. The concert was
in aid of the regimental fund and w'as
arranged Â¦ by Al Bentley. Dr. D' Evelyn
acted as chairman and also figured as
one of the talent, giving a 'lurid descrip

served during,. the evening, and the first
"camp concert" of the new rifle corps
was voted a complete success.
The corps is now uniformed, and the
"khaki" dress is very picturesque. The
muster roll is rapidly filling up, and it
Is hoped that the organization will soon
reach the SOOrmark. The staff board is
now making arrangements for the corps
to take part in the military parade to be
witnessed by President McKinley during
his stay in this city.
Lawyer Lyman I. Mowry has an Intel
lectual head,. or, to speak more precisely,
an intellectual looking head, but he is
modest and does not like to see a likeness
of it In the dally newspapers. While de
fending, a [Chinese woman* named Fong
Mey Took before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock J yesterday after
noon he noticed Mr. Johnson, a newspaper
artist, sitting at the opposite side of the
table sketching him.
"Stop that!" thundered the lawyer. "My
face is my property and you have no right
to sketch it. If you don't desist I will
have you thrown out of the room "
Artist Johnson calmly proceeded with
his sketching and Mr. Mowry appealed to
the court, but the court declined to Inter
fere. The court remarked that !t wasn't
aware that Johnson was disturbing the
peace and dignity of the abode of justice
and the triumphant artist placed the craj'
on f ac-simlle of the intellectual head into
his pocket. â¢ Â¦ â¢ .: .
The young woman whom Mr. Mowry
was. defending 1 from the charge of being
unlawfully In the country was one of the
thirty-five captured in the recent Fed
eral raid in Sullivan alley. She swore that
she was born in this city and that she
was taken back to China at the age of 6
years. On her return to this ~ port she
proved to the satisfaction of the Collector
of Customs that she was a native Ameri
can and was allowed to land. â¢ â¢
Quan Quock Suey, one of her witnesses,
told the. court that he knew the prisoner
when she was only a month old and had
seen her a hundred times. at least before
she was taken back to China. The woman
had sworn that Quan had seen her only
once before she went to China and that
was when she was a year old. although
she did , not explain the precocity of her
memory for one so younjr. Judge Heacock

The Board of Public Works has taken
exceptions. to the figures returned by the
Auditor showing that more money Is spent
for, salaries In the Bureau of Streets than
for improvements on streets. The board
claims that the Auditor has Included the
cost of labor in the salaries paid. At the
request of Mayor Phelan the board yes
terday submitted the following statement
covering the subject:
During the six months beginnlnr September,
1900. the total sum paid for salaries In the
Bureau of Streets was $15,064 16. The cost of
labor, consisting of bricklayers, hodcarrlers,
rammers, pavers, carpenters, sewer cleaners,
etc., but not including inspectors and aupet
interidents, who are included in the salaries
account, was $39,631 18. The cost of material,
consisting of basalt blocks, brick. â¢ cement,
shovels, picks and all necessary tools used by
labor, was $12,969 05.: The repairs to. county
roads, miscellaneous repairs and repairs in
front of city property, amounted to $4430 2S.
The necessary teaming for hauling the mate
rial to the bricklayers and pavers, placing: bar
ricades upon the streets, removing detritus
from sewers and placing lanterns on danger
ous streets, cost $15,177 55. The amount ex
pended for bituminous pavement repairs was
$7055 76.
As labor, material and teaming are neces
sary for repairs, it will . appear, by adding
these various items, that for. eix months the
amount expended by the Bureau of Streets for
repairs was $79,263 82, and for salaries $15,054 16.
The. total amount of salaries in the Bureau of
Streets for the six months for the above
amounted to $4650. Â¦
The charter and ordinances require that cer
tain records be kept In the Bureau of Streets,
and It is necessary that employes; whose Bal
aries for the ilx months amount to $6324 16,
be employed. I Salaries paid to - keepers of
bridges . amount, for the six months, to $2280.
Salaries paid to . inspectors of work done by
corporations and of street cleaning amounted
to $1800, making a total of salaries of $15,054 16.
For the year 1900-1901 the sum of $36,604 was
eet aside for repavlngr accepted streets. . Up
to March' 81, 1901, the sum of $27,567 .was ex
pended on the following new work:
Reconstructing Spear-street wharf $634100
Repaving Sixth . street from Folsom to
Harrison â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ <â¢ 1681 45
Repaving Fourth street from Howard to

Repaving Grant avenue from - CB"arrell 1 â¢ (5
street to the north line of Bush., 5370 05
Repaving Main street from Mission to
Howard â¢ 7515 15
The board has entered into contract, in ad
dition to the above, for the repaving of Sac
ramento, Clay and . "Washington streets, from
Montgomery to Sansome, at a cost of $678,
and for the repaving of Pine street, from San
some to Battery, at a cost of $2650. It has
also called for bids for the repaving of Front
street, . from .Washington to Jackson, and also
the crossings of Washington and Front streets
and Clay and Front streets, at an estimated
cost of $5715, making a total for ; repaving ac
cepted streets of $42,810, this latter sum being
$6206 35 in excess of the amount appropriated
Â¦for this purpose. ; _ , â¢ ;.

The trial of the litigation between the
Pennsylvania Consolidated Mining Com
pany and the Grass Valley Exploration
Company is dragging its weary and tech
nical way along in the United States Cir
cuit Court before Judge Morrow without
a jury. The trial was begun, as already
announced in The Call, on April 16, and
since that time, except on Sunday and
holidays', has been progressing.
The suit was begun in the Superior
Court of Nevada County on August 6 of
last year and was transfered to the
United States Circuit Court. By stipula
tion the suit of the Pennsylvania Company
vs. the Grass Valley Exploration Company
for {600,000 and that of the Grass Valley
Company against the Pennsylvania for
$100,000 damages for ejection were con
solidated insofar as the ownership of
the property is affected. After the ques
tion of ownership has been answered the
damage issue will be taken up.
.The Pennsylvania Consolidated owns tho
Pennsylvania claim and the Liberty Hill
mines and the Grass Valley Exploration
Company owns the W Y O D, General
Grant, Parr, Sims and â¢ Telegraph mines
and the J. C. Harry agricultural patent,
several blocks and lots In Grass Valley
and the Crescent quartz mine, lying south
of. the townsite. The Pennsylvania claims
are completely jihut in by the Grass Val
ley Company's mines.
The Pennsylvania Company' contends
that the bodies of ore which they have
been and are working . are being en
croached upon by the underground works
of theWYOD mine and that those veins
and ore bodies apex within the surface
lines of the Pennsylvania's claims. They
contend also that- the ore bodies lie In
bunches connected by stringers, some of
these ore bodies overlapping one another.
They are trying to prove that the Grass
Valley Exploration C om P a ny has stoped
these ore bodies from the 900-foot level and
has extracted therefrom large quantities
Of gold. â¢'Â¦;â¢.
j Among the expert witnesses examined
as to the continuity of the Pennsylvania
Company's ore bodies are W. F. Engle
bright, Bennett â¢ Ople, who worked for
many years as foreman and superintend
ent for the plaintiff; C. A. Brockington,
superintendent of the Orleans; George C.
Starr, manager of the Empire mine and
Charles E. Uren, manager of the Eagle
and Eagle-Shawmut. Yesterday John
Williams, a miner, was on tne stand to
corroborate the evidence of the witnesses
named as to the ore bodies being worked
by the W Y O D apex in the Pennsyl
vania claim. . Â¦ ' t â¢
The cross-examination by the attorneys
of the Grass Valley Exploration Com
pany displayed an intention' to. prove that
the ore bodies spoken of by the witnesses
Â¦were encountered after the bodies - apex
ing the Pennsylvania had pinched out
and were therefore separate and independ
ent deposits. ">r~- ' n .; ,~>:
The Pennsylvania people allege also that
the W Y O D works have encroached by
an upraise from . the 1100-foot level and
Btoped out ore of the value of $600,000.

The Eclipse Cracker Factory has closed
Its doors. It was founded nearly half a
century ago by Thomas J. Chadbourne,
Joseph Chadbourne and H. and W. Pierce
in 1652 on Dupont street, between Green
and Union, and had continued uninter
ruptedly In business, making fortunes for
beveral. Thomas J. Chadbourne has been
identified with the enterprise during the
entire period. His profits in the half cen
tury are estimated at something like $500,
000. In the winter of his life he retires
with a handsome fortune and with not one
dollar of indebtedness outstanding against
the concern.
The costly machinery Is for sale. As
manv as fifty employes have been working
in the factors'. They are out, with the
understanding that the works will not
resume.
Thomas J. Chadbourne said last even
ing that the reason he had finally decided
to close down permanently was because
of the competition among the cracker
bakers, which had reduced the prices so
that there is no money in making crack
ers at this time. It was possible that
there might be some change in conditions
after a while, but he deemed it the best
to stop. The smaller business of baking
cakes, bread, etc., will be continued by his
sen. Howard F.. experimentally, to see
Â¦whether it will pay.
Mr. Chadbourne has supplied the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company with ship bread
for many years arid also has filled large
army contracts. The business has always
been in the same block since It was orig
inally located there, and has been the
largest business enterprise In that imme

Mission residents are very much worked
up over the depredations of one or more
burglars who have been operating in that
portion of the city of late. Captain Sey
mour was a very much surprised man
when it was reported to him yesterday
morning that four houses in the. Mission
had been entered the previous night and
many articles stolen.
The first residence visited by the burg
lars was that of Louis Schnetzler, 3744
Twenty-second street. Entrance was ef
fected by a pair of nippers, by which the
key was turned. Schnetzler lost 75 cents
and a bunch of keys. J. H. Keefe, 3S29
Twenty-first street, was the next man vis
ited by the Industrious thieves. Keefe's
clothing was taken into a building- in the
course ql construction near by Â¦ and the
pockets emptied. Mrs. W. Ordway's resi
dence, 3825 Twenty-first street, was then
visited and robbed of a quantity of jew
elry.
The last place visited by the enterprising
thieves was the residence of H. G. White
at 899 Noe street. A number of watches
and considerable coin were taken from the
Noe-street residence.
A rather unusual feature of the burgla
ries was the leaving of the clothing near
the places from which it was stolen. Cap
tain Seymour has a squad of detectives
detailed on the four cases and has In
structed his men to make special efforts
to capture the daring fellows.

CLAIMS HAXF OF ESTATE
OF CALVIN FENTON FARGO
Alleged Widow of the I>eceased Files
Demand for Share of Commu-
nity Property.
. A legal fight for one-half the fortune
of the late Calvin Fenton, Fargo was in
stituted yesterday by Jenny Dutrit-Fargo,
who alleges v that she is* the surviving
widow of the deceased. In her- complaint,
which was drawn by her attorneys, E. B.
Davis and ex-Judge A; A. Sanderson, the
plaintiff does not state when or where she
married the deceased, simply alleging that
at the time 'Of his death and for many
years prior thereto she was his lawful
wife- Â¦
The claimant set'forth that at the time
of the death of Calvin F. Fargo he was
possessed of property worth $370,000. of
which $240,000 still remains in the hands of
the executors of his will, the sum of $130,
000 .having been distributed to the pre
ferred legatees, Mary Fargo Stewart and
Edward Fargo. - - .
Of decedent's estate the claimant alleges
the. sum of $275,000 was community prop
erty, one-half of which she claims under
the ' law. â¢ The community property, she
says, consists of $70004o. bank, bonds and
stocks of the Southern Pacific Company,.
Eastern Dynamite Company. Hotel . Rose
Company, -Empire Mill and Mining Com
pany, Santa Ana Water Company and the
Ventura Land and Power Company, and
real estate in this city and county and in
Contra Costa, San Mateo and Ventura
counties.
In conclusion the claimant alleges that
the executors of the will refuse to recog
nize her claim and refuse to admit that
any of decedent's property is subject to
the community interest of a surviving
widow. Hence she prays that the court
determine that she is the surviving widow
of the deceased and allow her one-half of
the property found on investigation to be
subject to her community interest.
Though Calvin F. Fargo's most intimate
friends and relatives disclaim any knowl
edge of his alleged marriage, the attor
neys who represent the claimant say they
confidently expect to establish her claim.
These examples of the greatest painters
of the modern French school â Corot. the
wonderful landscape painter; Daubigny,
also a great landscape genius, and Millet,
head and shoulders above them allâ will
prove a splendid addition to the museum
gallery and will perhaps induce further
gifts of equal worth for the artistic bet
terment of the San Francisco public.
The Commissioners received a donation
of three boxes of curios and relics from
the Philippines from Captain E G Curry
of. the Twenty-seventh Infantry, and a
golden key from the Native Daughters.
Immediately on her arrival there will or

That the affairs of the Union Trust
Company are in a most prosperous condi
tion is evidenced by the fact that the di
rectors have decided to increase the al

up capital from $750,000 to $1,000,000.
President I. \V. Hellman says that the
business is in a very prosperous condition
and that the outlook promises still greater
things.
The combined assets of the banking and
trust departments of the business are said
to be in the neighborhood of $20,000,000.
The directors, therefore, have declared a
dividend of 10 per cent, payable on stock
from surplus earnings or credited $123.
000 from the surplus profits to capital.
They have also Called on the stockholders
for 10 per ccht or $100 additional per share,
making in all a paid up capital of $1,000,000.

the maintenance of those libertiesâ especially
In privately endowed institutionsâ I do not see
how either the dignity of the teachers 1 posi
tion or the leadership and social usefulness of
universities in our democratic society can ba
preserved. It has become increasingly ap
parent, however, that the administration of
this university takes a rather seriously diver
gent view of the equities involved in the case?
that have arisen here during ' the year. I
think it necessary, therefore, to present my
resignation.
I need not say that. In very many respects,
I shall sever my connections with the faculty
of Stanford with regret, nor that I shall re
member very pleasantly the "personal kindness
that I have enjoyed during the time of my
service under you. I am very truly your*.

Immediately on receiving the resignation
President Jordan accepted it in a brief
reply. It is announced . that' Professor
Lovejoy's place will be filled by Dr.
Rieber of Princeton University.

ROSS SYMPATHIZER
RESIGNS AT STANFORD
Professor Arthur 0. Lovejoy of the Univer-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STAXFORD UNIVERSITY, May 2.
âProfessor Arthur O. Lovejoy has
resigned his position in the uni
versity as associate professor of
philosophy and the resignation
has been accepted. His letter announces
that this step was taken because of his
sympathy with the cause of Professors
Ross and Howard.
The work In philosophy will be taken
in charge by the newly appointed assist
ant professor of logic. Dr. Charles H.
Rieber of Harvard, who begins his work
with the commencement of the new year.
Professor Lovejoy graduated from the
University of California in 1895; A- M.,
Harvard. 1887; student of Harvard fellow
ship in University of Paris, 1898-99. This
was liis second year at Stanford. In his
letter of resignation he say:
President D. S. Jordanâ My Dear Sir:
Thank lnÂ«r you for the favor of your notice of
reapixjintment. I beg leave at the same time
to place in your hr.nds my resignation as as
poolate professor of philosophy, the resigna
tion to take effect either directly, or at the
end of the semester, as you may think best.
My reasons for taking this step relate both to
the dismissal of Professor Roes In November
and to the subsequent policy of the univer
sity administration. At the time of the orig
inal difficulty you made it known that the re
moval had taken place contrary to your de
eire, and that you were not responsible for
the act. Facts which came to light at that
tfn^e and subsequently made It seem evident
to me that Dr. Hose had been dismissed partly
because of the founder's objection to the par
ticipation of university Instructors In public
political meetings, partly because of the ob
jections to the specific contents of certain of
his public utterances upon matters within the
limits of his own specialty, and partly be
cause of a fear of vaguely dangerous social
tendencies, which it was believed that his
teachings, both within and without the ' uni
versity, were likely to foster.
Recently I have been permitted, with others
o* my colleagues, to review the whole of the
documentary evidence in the case; as & result.
I am forced to the conviction that the fore
poinK conclusions as to the fact* Jn the affair
ate verified beyond the possibility of further
doubt The significance of those facts *eems
to me clear. I do not know what is meant by
the somewhat curt phrase â¢'academic free
dom'- it seems to lend itself freely to subtle
ties of interpretation. But I certainly con
ceive that the dismissal for such reason* of
en Instructor whom the pres dent of the uni
versltv has regarded as a fit person to retain
Involves an abridgment of liberties which it 1Â»
the right and duty of university teachers *o
demand. Unless the members of our prof es-
Fionshow themselves somewhat punctilious In

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
There is a cure for dyspepsia. Sufferers
who have tried noxious nostrums will
probably be skeptical, but skepticism van-
ishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
tried. Whether the trouble Is dyspepsia of
long standing, or merely a simple case of
indigestion, relief is prompt and pro-
nounced. The less the trouble the fewer
tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eatiner. sour stomach,
as Indicated by belching, fatigue with
slight exertion, or with no exertion at all,
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues," these things can com-
monly be set down as symptoms of dys-
pepsia. And dyspepsia is merely Indiges-
tion In an aggravated form.
By promoting perfect digestion. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves,
restful, refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy flesh. They make the
skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind
cheerful.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gest the food and make It easy of assimi-
lation, and they relieve the Inflamed, dis-
eased condition of the membranous lin-
ings and the glands of the stomach and
bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places, and put them Into a
healthy, active condition. They effect a
quick and permanent cure. You don't
have to continue taking them forever, still
it is well to have a box handy and take
one at the first return of the trouble.
Perfectly well people are made sick by
eating too much, or unwholesome food,
but not if they take a tablet after eating.
Treatment with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets does not necessitate dieting or any
change of habits. They digest the proper
food and act upon the other kind in such
a way as to make It pass off quickly and
harmlessly. You may eat and drink what
you like, when you like, and as much as
you like If you take a tablet afterward.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
all druggists at 50 cents for full size pack-
age.

A' preponderance of the total transactions In
the whole market centered in these stocks.
There have been very confident predictions that
the first dividend on Atchison for a half-year
would be 2 per cent and -it is likely that a
large 6hort Interest was accumulated in the

CHICAGO. May 2.â In corn the tight grip of
the leading bull on the May delivery was more
than ever apparent. Prices fluctuated violently
within a range of 5c, but actual transactions
in the pit were very small. Phillips, who has
thÂ£ market cornered, refused to sell. \ Asld*
from the manipulation, small receipts of con
tract trade corn and a report that Argen
tina's exportable surplus had been reduced 50
per cent were strengthening - factors. The
manipulation was, of course, most apparent In
May. although the July delivery profited some
what by it and enjoyed a more general trade

Weather Report.
"In connection with the present high prices
of stocks and Immense dealings therein, which
have caused a great many people to anticipate
Â« disastrous reaction. It must be remembered
tUa.t a very large part of the purchases of
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, Southern Pa
cific. Baltimore and Ohio. Pennsylvania Coal,
Lehigh Valley, Norfolk and Western, Chesa
peake and Ohio, LonÂ£ Island and some time
ego Lake Shore, has been provided for by be
ing unloaded upon leading trunk line corpora
tions. This puts the former owners In a strong
moneyed position to be buyers of other things
for investment to take the place of the un
loaded properties and makes stronger holders
of our .securities than in any previous bull
campaign, besides making the situation a much
safer one than would. appear on the surface."
"Our ability of late Lo subscribe for foreign
securities, which has been done to a . consid
erable extent within the last two years, makes
these properties international, as has always
been the case -with American securities which
had a London and Continental market.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"There Is one good feature connected with the
purchase of English consols on this side â it
will place us much In the same position as
England has been in in connection with this
country almost continuously up to -within the
last few years. Whenever money became
ecarce and rates high at the foreign money
centers they would Jeluge our market with
the return of American securities so as to draw
gold from us. This country is now in a sim
ilar position. Whenever -we get into a tight
place for money, If we ever do again, we
will have European government securities to
send back to them in place of shipping gold.
The Situation in Wall Street.
"Trade in currants, -while still email, shows
come slight Improvement, possibly due to the
receipt by the trade of the news of the recent
advance in Greece. Apples show some activity.
Pales of rood dry prime stock are reported at
4%c. JCuts are dull."
"Prunes are still offering from the coast on
the 2c basis, but whether these are some of
the 30,000.000 pounds reported to have been
bought by the syndicate of 'packers could not
be learned. Five cars were offered yesterday
from California, but there were no 30-40s or
<0-50s and no straight cars of 90-100s In the
assortment. It could not be discovered that
any business was done on this basis. Raisins
continue quiet. Sales of a small lot of Cali
fornia 3-crown loose Muscatels were reported
at 5%c to jobbers. Some business was done
in the 3-crown of good quality early in the
week as lew aa 4%c.
Mail advices from Xew York say: "Because
of the scarcity of pupplies the spot market
for prunes is firm at the advance of about
Uo per pound, and the demand is only slightly
less active than at the former prices. Forties
to 50s and E0-60s -were fceld more firmly than
on Thursday, 40-50s being comparatively bard
to find even at 6%c.

absorption. This collaborates the- current sup
position that the great granger trunk lines
feel themselves at a tactical disadvantage if
they have not an assured Pacific Coast outlet
as well as an Eastern trunk line connection
and that all of them will sooner or later take
measures to secure these advantages. The
movement of prices to-day was cited as giving
evidence that the buying of Atchison was for
the benefit of St. Paul and probably also of
Rock Island. There was a - disposition to at
tribute the late strength of .Baltimore and
Ohio to plans for making that 'road the east
ern outlet and the late spurt in Norfolk and
Western and Chesapeake and Ohio wereisup
posed to indicate alternative possibilities.'*- The
declaration of the first dividend on Norfolk
and Western of . 1 per cent was. however, the
more plausible explanation of the strength of
the last named Etock. The feverish . and er
ratic fluctuations in Union Paciflo were amply
explained by the new uncertainties surround
ing the present ownership of Its control. There
were various rumors both to the effect that
the Vanderbllt Interests had perfected their
control and that the Harriman Interest had
secured the maintenance of their control.
Every movement in the stock and every rumor
regarding the control was looked upon with
suspicion by the uneasy speculators as a de
vice to further the contest and Â¦ underlying all
was their dread that when once the actual
control is decided the high price -will not be
maintained. The extreme range of the stock
was 6 points and the net loss 1%. Atchison
advanced an extreme 11%- and closed within a
fraction of the best. St. Paul Is 2% higher
on the day. Chesapeake and Ohio 3% and Nor
folk and Western 1%. The stocks included in
the Burlington deal, the Erie stocks not ex
cluded. " were all notably heavy. The heavy
profit-taking and weakness of the United
States Steel . stocks had a large sentimental
effect on the whole market. New York Cen
tral was quite severely handled and loses 3%
on the day. Except for the few special points
of strength the market was on the whole re
actionary. The money rate was distinctly
firmer to-day, ruling at 6 per cent early in
the day and It was said that a number of the
banks were calling- loans. The sub-treasury
figures, -which include the payment for the
gold exports, show a loss by the money mar
ket thus far of $5,758,000. The payments of
the Government Interest and of the blocks of
Go\-ernment bonds redeemed yesterday and to
day do not figure yet lu the- statement, but it
Is evident that there must Â¦ have been . a very
heavy movement of cash from the interior
during the week to overcome these losses. The
sterling exchange market had a firm under
tone and there Is still a possibility of gold
engagements to-morrow for Saturday's steamer.
The closing of the market was easy and al
most weak except for the final spurt In Atchi
son.
Union Pacific convertible bonds continued
very active and the bond market otherwise
was irregular. Total sales. $7,165,000. <7t

CLOSING.
The bank has bought Â£203,000 of gold in
American bars. There was a demand. for sil
ver for the India market.
The feature of the day's business, however,
was the gigantic options in Americans, this
being regarded by some . people here as the
only safe method of dealing in them now.
united States Steel was active around 53% for
the common and 103% for the preferred. There
was a big- rush for Grand Trunks on vague
rumors of working agreements being arranged
between them, Northern Pacific and the Ley
land line.
In the American department business- was
active, but confused and irregular. , London
rushed In to take profits during the first hours
of. the morning, but there soon came a furious
demand foT" Atchison, -which went higher and
rallied the 'whole list. There was a pause dur
ing which the market fluctuated feverishly.'
Then the boom was continued when it waa
learned that Pennsylvania was buying large
lines. Union Pacific hung rather heavy al
though 150 was talked for it on the reported
guarantee of 6 per cent on the stock by those
who are acquiring- control.
A large business was done in the Stock' Ex
change-here to-day. Buying orders had ac
cumulated over the holiday, the execution of
which â¢ grave the market the appearance of
great activity, but the tone also waa better,
more buoyant than it has been for a long time.

Furniture Had Been Liberally
Insured.
OAKLAND, May 2.â Investigation has
uncovered many peculiar circumstances
surrounding the incendiary attempt to
burn the residence at 1661 Grove street,
occupied by William S. Linn. The furni
ture which had been set on fire in vari
ous parts of the house after being sat
urated with coal oil was insured in sep
arate companies by two $500 policies, and
was covered by a chattel mortgage for
1200.'
Linn was cross-questioned at much
length by the insurance agents, Fire
Chief Ball and Chief of Police Hodgkins,
but he declared he could not solve the
mystery surrounding the attempt to-de
stroy his household goods. â¢ r.-- â¢: '
Linn had taken out an insurance policy
in one company which forbade additional
insurance on the risk. In â¢ spite of
this condition he bought a second
policy in another company. A few
days before the fire Linn had been
given notice to vacate the premises, . be
cause he was three months; behind with
his rent.
The police are waiting for a report from
the insurance adjusters before taking

JAPAN TAUGHT LESSON
BY FINANCIAL TROUBLE
Secretary of legation at Washing
ton Says That Depression Is
Only Transient.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â Midori Ko
matz, secretary of the Japanese legation
at Washington, In an interview to-day
with an Associated Press reporter, made
an interesting statement on the financial
situation In Japan. He said:
"I do not deny that our financial situa
tion to-day is anything but satisfactory.
It is true that the Government has de
ferred all such undertakings as would in
volve new loans. It is. tiue that a few
local banks have been compelled to sus
pend payment and stringency is prevailing
in the money market. But the foundation
for the financial arrangement is too firmly
established to be affected by any tran
sient depression any more than the bot
tom of a river is apt to be shaken by the
feeble waves caused by a passing wind.
"There is no danger, in my opinion, that
the present situation will result In any
"serious crisis. On Â¦ the' contrary, it will
produoe, I am aulte confident, a benefi
cial effect upon the national progress by
affording the people a lesson that no good
times should be abused by luxury, or. ex
travagance In any form." >i

to Mr. Brennan, the British Consul in
Shanghai, that the Nankin â¢ Viceroy . is
very anxious about the Yangtse move
ment and he asked Mr. Brennan to assist
the Taotai to preserve order by holding
troops .in readiness. . * ' .-Â¦'..
m "It is announced from a German source
that the French have withdrawn their
troops from Hwailu to Paoting-fu,Â» thus
leaving the Germans in sole possession of
all the passes into Shansi.'V
Dr. Morrison, wiring to the Times fr.om
Peking i Wednesday, says: "The indem
nity committee favors a loan raised . on
the guarantee of all the powers. Its pro
posal to increase the maritime customs
to 5 per cent ad valorem applies to import
duties only and not export. All the Min
isters of: the powers, except. the British,
American and Japanese, favor an imme
diate increase to 10 per cent. The report,
which is based on somewhat imperfectly
understood data, has been referred to the

John Downey and John Erickson
Plead. Guilty to a Charge of
Battery.
The ship Dowan Hill arrived In port
Wednesday from England and tnat msrnt
two of the sailors â John Downey and
John Erickson â met Captain George Fux
ley on Market street, opposite the Phe
lan building. They had a grievance
against the skipper and at once attacked
him. He ran and the two sailors chaÂ«cd
him and kept up a running fight till Po
liceman Beach appeared on the rcene and
arrested Downey and Erickson on a
charge of battery. Â¦"--.-â¢ "V"
The sailors appeared before Judge Slo
gan yesterday morning and the explana
tion they gave was that the captain, dur
ing the voyage, emptied a Darrelful of
rainwater because they had taken the
barrel .without first asking his permission.
Another grievance was that the captiin
had refused to allow an extra supply of
sugar for a sick sailor. They pleaded
guilty and when Downey was asked if he
wanted to cross-examine the captain he
replied contemptuously: "No: he ain't fit
to talk to." They will be sentenced this
morning.

tarpet for a. couple of shots from A. Sar
ment's -pistol this morning:- at 2' o'clock,
whenhe surprised the intruders trying to
break into' his grocery store at 808 East
Fcurleenth street. The prowlers escaped
without being hit, the grocer being too
badly excited to make his aim deliberate.
Sarment was working at the rear of his
store when he heard a suspicious sound
at the front door. The grocer; yelled
"Who's there!" and then, grabbing his
revolver, rushed out after the burglars,
firing as he ran. Before Sarment got to
the door the thieves were running: at top
speeed toward East Oakland. He sent a
shot after the rapidly <iisappearing forms
and returned to double bar his doors
against further intrusion.

COMPANY MT7ST PAY FOR
ERECTION OF NEW LIGHTS
Inspector Tupper Inserts Clause ca
Subject in New Specifi
cations.
Light and "Water Inspector Tupper yes
terday submitted plans and specifications
to the Supervisors' Committee on Artifi
cial Lights for the lighting of streets and
public buildings during the next fiscal
year. The specifications differ In one es
sential point from those in force durlns
tho present fiscal year, which do not deft
nltely provide that the company receiving
the contract must erect new lights when
ordered by the Board of Public Works.
As a consequence considerable trouble
Â¦vvs experienced with the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company when lights
were deemed necessary in the outlying
districts. The clause on the subject reads
as follows:
All arc lights necessary to be erected at such
Locations as may be determined by the Board
of Public Works shall be furnished by success
ful bidder when required during the first three
months of the contract (that is, previously to
October 1. 1901) at their own expense, and
the city shall pay lor their maintenance only. Â¦
but if ordered erected after October 1, 1901,
then the city shall pay the actual cost of labor
involved in erecting 1 such lights, but in no
case shall more lights be maintained than can
be paid for out of the street lighting fund.

OAKLAND. May 2.-On Saturday
afternoon, from 1 o'clock until 7,
society will do homage to tho
children at Arbor Villa, the beau
tiful hillside home of Mr. and
Mrs. F. M. Smith In East Oakland. The
children wijl be there, but so will society,
for MrB. Smith's May fete is for the
adults as well as for. the little ones. It is
the great event where the big people
amuse the little people and the little peo
ple amuse their elders, and where every
body contributes to the pleasure of every
body else. It is right that It should be so,
for they all contribute to two charities,
one, for. the .young and one for the oldâ
the Central' Free Kindergarten and the
Old Ladies' Home.
This has become an annual festival for
Oakland, and society has come to watch
for It es one of the few outdoor events
on its calendar. And no place in Oakland
could be more appropriate for it than
Arbor Villa.
A Delightful Spot
With acres of ground in the most per
fect condition, filled with the most de
lightful spots where booths for refresh
ments can be hidden away, where May
pole dances can be held and the tots can
amuse their elders and themselves, where
the little ones can enjoy donkey rides and
the big: ones can enjoy the wonderful gar
dens. Arbor Villa is the place in all Oak
land for such a fete.
And for five years Mrs. F. M. Smith has
turned her grounds over to old and young
for this fete. It has grown each year in
importance and events for amusement un
til the present year, when a most elab
orate programme has been prepared for
the occasion. -
A few suggestions have been offered for
the benefit of those who attend. Carriages
should drive up Seventh avenue to the
trate at the head of that street. Those
v.ho go by car can transfer from any
etreet car line in Oakland to the Fifth
avenue line in East Oakland and from
there to the Eighth-avenue branch, and
v.ill be taken directly to the Eighth-ave
nue gate of Mrs. Smith's grounds. The
hours will be from 1 o'clock in the after
noon until 7 in ihe evening, and there will
Friends of Lelong say that he has not
been qulte_himself for some months. 4 He
was well liked In -Sacramento durins his
official residence of several years and was
one of the most enthusiastic cf local
sportsmen. He was' in, close touch with
the Â¦ horticultural interests of the State
and was regarded as a flr3t-class author
ity on the subject of fruit pests and their
remedies. . .
At 2:15 o'clock this morning, at the re
quest of members of the Elk3, Coroner
McMullen opened the letter found on the
body of Lelong. It was freshly written
in ink upon a letterhead of the State
Board of Horticulture, dated May 2, 1901,
and appeared from the freshness 'Qf the
ink to have been written to-night, prob
ably after Lelong left his house and a
few minutes before his body, was found
in the park of the Capitol, In which build-
Ing his office- is located. The letter read
as follows:
"To the Elks and. Knights of Pythias
of Sacramento: If you are charitable take
care of my body and help my wife and
child a little. I commit this rather than
bring further disgrace upon my wife and
child. I am net responsible, but others
are. (Signed) B. M. LELONG."

his name is forever linked, is published

Captain Dreyfus describes from first
to last the inner workings of the great
event with which he was associated. Ev-'
ery incident is set forth in detail.
The story of his degradation acquires
new. and vivid interest when told by the
sufferer himself. This took . place on
January 5, 1895.' â¢ The following are ex
tracts from his diary:
"I suffered agonizingly, but held my
self erect with all. my strength. To-sus
tain me I called upon the memory of my
wife and children. As soon as sentence
had been read, I cried aloud, addressing
myself to the troops: 'Soldiers, they are
degrading an innocent '. man ! Soldiers,
they are dishonoring an 'innocent man!
Vive la France, vive l'Armee!'
- "A sergeant ' of â¢ the republican guard
came up to me.- He tore of* rapidly but
tons, trousers stripes, signs of . my rank
from cap and sleeves and then broke my
sword across his knee. I saw all these
material emblems of my honor fall at my
feet. Then, my whole being racked by
fearful paroxysm, but with body erect
and head high, I shouted again and
again, 'I am innocent.' Â»
"The -parade continued. I was com
pelled to make the whole round of the
square. I heard the howls of the deluded
mob., I felt the thrill which I knew must
be running through those people, since
they believed that before them was a
convicted traitor to France, and I strug
gled to transmit to their hearts another
thrillâ belief in my innocence."
"How I can' feel between every line
the grief and frightful agony of those
I dear ones. Letters arrived . here at the
i end of March and must certainly have
1 been sent back to ' France. So if takes
more than three months for mail to reach
me. I reproach myself for having written
distressing letters to my wife when I first
arrived here. I should have known how to
bear my^ cross alone- rather than to inflict
a share of ray sufferings upon those who
have cruel burdens of their own.
"I learned of a long series of misdeeds
and disgraceful crimes constituting the
Indictment against my innocence. I was
told of the heroism and tho great efforts
of noble men, the unflinching struggle
undertaken by that handful of men of
lofty character, opposing their own cour
age and honesty to the cabals of false
hood and iniquity. I had never doubted
that justice would be done. My Illusions
with regard to some of my former chiefs
were gradually dissipated and my soul
was filled with anguish. I was seized
with an overpowering pity and sorrow for
that army of France, which I loved.
Special Dispatch- to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 3.â B. M. Le
long, secretary of the State Board
of Horticulture, committed suicide
at 12:30 o'clock this morning In
Â¦y Capitol Park. When found he was
drawing his last breath, and - expired
without uttering a word.
Officer John Campbell and Dr.' Powell,, a
local dentist, were walking up N street at
the hour mentioned, when they, heard a.
pistol shot. Campbell remarked that the
shot was not on his beat and he supposed
it amounted to nothing, but the two men
started off in the direction whence it
came. ; They were joined by Detective
John Fitzgerald, who was on his way
home. -
The three men walked along the path
in Capitol Park to approximately Twelfth
and N streets, when they came across the
body of Lelong- lying on the stone pave-;
ment In the glare of an electric light. A
revolver was clenched in his right hand
and a bullet hole which had torn through
the roof of his mouth told the story of
suicide.'
Coroner McMullen was Immediately sent
for, the gasping of the prostrate man for
breath and the terrible wound which re-
vealed Itself to the gaze of the officers
showing that death was at hand. Lelong
expired a few seconds after the discovery
by the officers. - :
Detective Fitzgerald hurried to the res
idence of Mrs. Lelong at Fifteenth and.N
streets and informed her of the deed. She
was overcome by the sad intelligence and
could give, no explanation why: her hus
band should -be led to such an act. She
said that he arrived home late to-night
and lay on the bed for a while without
removing his clothes. He then got up
and left the house, presumably for his
office in the Capitol to transact some busi
ness which he had neglected.
Mrs. Lelong said that her husband had
appeared despondent for. several weeks
and complained of not being able to sleep.'
The weapon Lelong used to take his life
was a 38-caliber Smith & Wesson..
Lelong was a prominent member of the
Order of Elks and a sealed letter ad
dressed to the president of the local lodge
was found on his person. Coroner Mc-
Mullen was unwilling to open this to
night, desiring that the president of the
lodge, Dr. W. J. Taylor, should have that
privilege.
PLAN THAT IS INTENDED
TO PT{T AN END TO STRIKES
National Civic Federation Back of a
Movement of Great Signifi
cance. "
INDIANAPOLIS, May 2.â President
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers Is
on his way to New York 'to attend a
meeting of an especially appointed com
mittee of the National Civic Federation
to devise means of promoting t%ade agree
ments between employers and their em
ployes. There are fourteen members of
the committee, but a sub-committee con
sisting of Mr. Mitchell, Herman . Justl,
commissioner of the Coal Operators' As
sociation of Illinois, and Vice President
E. D. Kenna of the Atchlson, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad, will meet on Monday
to draw up an agreement to submit at a
meeting that will be held on Tuesday.
â¢ This movement, which' was proposed
some time ago. Is entirely new, and Mr,
Mitchell says that it is of great signifi
cance. The National Civic Federation,
which is a representative body, hopes to
bring It to a successful issue, although it
is realized that it is a difficult proposition.
The object Is to perfect some agreement
between labor and capital that will pre
vent strikes and lockouts, which are so
costly to both. It has been suggested that
In all branches of labor the employers and
their employes enter into a yearly con
tract by signing a scale, as the miners,
tinplate, glas3workers and other trades
do now.
Mr. Mitchell is of the opinion that If
this plan were followed It will Â¦ mean- a
closer organization of both labor and cap
ital and that there would be fewer strikes
and less trouble in settling differences. On
the way to New York Mr. Mitchell will
visit the anthracite fields in Pennsylva
nia.

ASK FOR HELP
IN CIRCULARS
Appeals for Money to
. Keep Schools Open
Are Mada
Ten Dollars for Each Pupil
'Attending Will Be
Necessary.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. May 2.
The active canvass for money to be used
for paying the salaries of the teachers
of the high schools of Oakland has be
gun. Two sets cf circulars were issued
to-day setting forth the condition of the
school funds and asking for subscriptions.
One circular was Issued by School Super
intendent McClymonds and sent to the
parents of the scholars, stating that $10
a head contributed by each scholar would
keep the schools open, but that the parents
could contribute more or less or noting: at
all. as they felt able. The other circular
was by the general committee and was
addressed to the people of Oakland gen
erally, asking contributions without re
gard to amount.
The school circular Is the most impor
tant and the essential portion reads:
In order to pay the salaries of the teachers
for the remainder of the term a little more
than $10,000 is needed. There are. In : thÂ«
various schools affected by this deficiency,
about 1100 pupils. This gives an average of
about $10 per pupil. It will be difficult for some
of the parents to pay this amount, while others
can and will pay more. The Board of Edu
cation therefore solicits from you such a con
tribution as you feel that you can contribute,
to the end that the schools may remain open
until the close of the year. The - funds are
entirely exhausted and this is the last resort
of the Board of Education to maintain the
schools and afford the pupils the educational
opportunities that are their due. No published
list of these pledges is to be made. Each pat
ron 13 to feel at liberty to contribute tha
amount th.it In h!s judgment hta circumstances
will permit and the Importance of the causa
demands. - .- ;
Accompanying each circular Is a pledgrÂ»
slip, which is to be returned by the pupils
on Friday, the pledges to be collected
May 22.
The general circular sets forth *he facts
of the deficit and the classes affected and
then passes the cause of the deficit ur> to
the last Council, ending with an appeal
for funds," to be sent to Fred L. Button.
969 Broadway. Oakland. Portions of thtÂ»
circular read as follows:
These classes were all organized and teach
ers elected in June, 19C0. as required by law.
and an estimate of the cost for the year end-
Ins June 30, 19C1. was submitted to the City
Council In September last, and as the said
Council refused to allow sufficient money in
the tax levy of 1900-1901 for their support for
the entire year, and unless $10,000 can be had
from some source all said classes must be dis
missed and the 1100 pupils in those classes
must be sent to their homes.
While it will be a disgrace to our beautiful
city of Oakland to be compelled to .close tho
doors of our schoolhouses for want of $10,000,
Just when we are to receive a visit from our
honored President, it will be a great wrong
and Injury to the -pupils of these classes, who,
after spending: months and years in study,
preparing themselves either for business in the
central school, or for the normal or the uni
versity In the high school, that they cannot
now finish their .course and must 'be turned out
of school a few weeks before the day of gradu
ation.
Such a result would be especially unfortunate
to those pupils who are eo nearly prepared
to enter the university that six weeks would
give them entry there without the examina
tions which will be required If their course of
study is not completed in tho hish school.

Father Myers Is 32 years of age and a
native of Xew York. He has been con
nected with the seminary since his arrival
on this coast a few years ago. While
completing his theological studies Father
Myers has been teaching the boys of the.
community. He enjoys the distinction of
being the first priest ordained at the new
seminary. . "
The Archbishop was assisted at the ser
vice by the Rev. A. J. B. Vuibert. presi-,
dent of the seminary: the Rev. J. W.

The new priest now makes Ms vows of
faithfulness and devotion, after which all
the members of the audience receive
blessing at his hands.
The most sacred part of the ceremony
then followed. Each of the priests in turn
advanced and laid his hands on the can
didate, after which his hands were anoint
ed and bless.ed He was then given the
chalice containing wine and water. The
mass continues, but now the new priest
recites the sacred words with the Arch
bishop, a form of ceremonial which has
been handed down since the time of the
apostles.
The ceremony of ordination was most
solemn and Impressive. All the clergy
who were present advanced in procession
from the sanctuary to the altar rail. ThÂ»
last of the line was the Archbishop, and
immediately preceding him wa3 the can
didate, bearing on his arm the vestments
which he would soon have the right to as
sume and carrying: in his .hand a lighted
taper. The Archbishop began the mass,
and at the end of the epistle turned to
the candidate and delivered the formal
address in Latin.

The popular impression that candidates
are voted for by individual members and
that a certain proportion of black balls
so thrown will defeat an applicant Is not
exactly correct. The board of directors,
consisting of eleven officers, elect or re
ject candidates. No one knows to a cer
tainty what fate the directors had in re
serve for General Barnes' candidate, but
it Is common talk .amOng- leading mem
bers that the Governor of California was
never in danger of rejection. .
It is all off now, so far as the Governor
Is concerned, and, the officers of the club
consider the Incident officially, closed. The
Governor may be Invited to the lunch in
honor of the President, but the colonels
on the staff cannot see how their chief, in
view of the. situation, can attend the
function. - : Â¦
One reason assigned for the Governor's
desire that his name should be withdrawn
was the knowledge that a resolution had
been adopted by the League providing
that only members of the club should be
invited to the luncheon In honor, of the
President. â¢ The Governor, it is asserted,
fancied that application for membership,
in face of that rule, would be construed
as a bid for an opportunity to join the
party at luncheon. .-
One Reason. Assigned.
with General Barnes' request. A sugges
tion in favor of making the Governor an
honorary member of the institution cre
ated some agitation. On the outside it is
freely said that the Governor has enemies
in the League who are anxious for an
opportunity to turn him down. On the
Inside it is said that the Governor should
have made his application for membership
two years ago. The proposal to make
him an honorary member was also
fraught with tho peril that he might de
cline the honor. It is said that a prom
inent member of the institution sought to
elicit a pledge from him that he would
accept the compliment if the club ten
dered it. but the Governor declined to
commit himself.
There is a flutter of surprise and a deal
of comment in club circles over the defi
nite announcement that the name of Gov
ernor Henry T. Gage, recently proposed
for membership in the Union League, has
been withdrawn by General W; H. L.
Barnes, who proposed the name. The
proposition was seconded by William M.
Abbott, Deputy Attorney General.
Governor Gage was in Los Angeles
when the subject cf joining the League
was introduced to him. He received a
message by wire from General Barnes
concerning the proposition and in response
called up the general by long-distance tel
ephone. . The topic was discussed over
the "phone," the Governor Insisting that
the time for joining was inopportune and
the general contending to the contrary.
The name was proposed, however, and
was on the list of candidates when Gov
ernor Gage arrived in San Francisco last
Monday. Shortly after his arrival there
was a conference at the Palace Hotel in
which the Governor, Adjutant General
Seamans and General Barnes participated.
The result of the conference was a re
quest to the club from General Barnes
that the Governor's name be withdrawn.
Day before yesterday there was a meet
ing of the board of directors of the Union
League. and the withdrawal was author
ized. ' . Â¦

several weeks ago. John L. Truslow, who

presents from the men under him, who
wished to show their appreciation of his
kindness and thoughtfulness.

--L. NEof the dogs that will attract
/jf . yk a great deal of 'attention at the
II II coming bench show of the San
v^^r Francisco Kennel Club at the Me
. â¢ chanics' Pavilion' will be a hand
some ' wire-haired fox terrier which was
rescued from a watery grave on the occa
sion of the wreck of the steamship Rio
de Janeiro. The little animal has been
positively identified during the past month
as the pet'.' that occupied a prominent
place in the stateroom of the late Cap
tain William Ward, and in storm or sun
shine rarely or ever left the side of the
gallant master mariner. People who have
made the voyage to or, from the Orient
on the Rio will remember the handsome
terrier and will Â¦Â¦ recall how fond master
and dog were of each other.
The Pacific Mail Company's Rio de Ja
neiro struck on a ledge of sunken rock
while entering the Golden Gate early one
foggy morning. The news of the wreck
was brought to the city by some of the
rescued crew and passengers who escaped
In a boat. The riews quickly spread, but
still it was many hours after the catas
trophe before help in the shape of tow
boats, gasoline launches and rowboats
reached the scene of the disaster. Sev
eral people were picked up from floating
wreckage, but a mile and a half out to
sea, and just at its last gasp, the terriar
was picked up by the tug Reliance and
brought back to life Captain Dave
Shaw. . It was a long time before the dog
got over mourning: for its master, but
now it seems to have made itself content
ed and comfortable at Captain Shaw's
home on Mason street.
Hescue of the Terrier.
When the Reliance reached the scene
of the Rio disaster the water was strewn
with wreckage. A number of people were
taken off floating timbers and from Ital
ian fishing boats and one or two bodies
were recovered. Captain Shaw was steer
ing the towboat In a circle and when a
mile and a half, out In the channel he
saw a dog struggling in the water. Di
recting the man at the wheel to steer for
the animal, the captain got ready to help
it aboard. Just as the Reliance got along
side the dog began to sink and Shaw
jumped into the water and grabbed the
terrier before it went down. Once aboard
the tug it took an hour's nibbing and
several doses of whisky to bring th* little
dog back to life, and then It was several
days before it could move about.
For some time there was apparently na
sign of an owner for the handsome ter
rier, and as he had to have a name Cap
tain Shaw, called him Rio. About a month
ago Captain Thomas P. Deering, assistant
United States inspector of hulls, and Cap
tain Shaw met on Market street. Rio was
with its new master, but at once showed
signs of recognizing Captain Deertng as
an old friend. Now, CaDtain Deering: and
the late Captain Ward had been the clos
est kind of friends, and in an Instant Cap
tain Deering recognized the terrier.
!'Where did you get that dog?" he asked
Captain Shaw.
His Master Gone.
"He came up from the wreck of thÂ»
Rio and I got a good ducking while sav
ing his life." was the answer.
"Did you never find its owner?" queried
Deering.
"No one ever came to claim him," was
the answer.
"And no one ever will," said Captain
Deering. "That dog belonged to the late
Captain Ward of the Rio de Janeiro and
was aboard when the vessel went down.
He probably was locked in the captain's
stateroom and did' not escape until the
decks were forced out of her. why he
must have been swimming for hours when
you picked Mm up."
A few days after this meeting Customs
Inspector Shepman saw and recognized
the dog, and since then half a dozen
others remember Rio as Captain Ward's
pet and the pride of the steamship's crew.
The dog makes himself perfectly at home
on the tug whenever Captain Shaw takes
him aboard, but directly the Reliance
passes Fort Point with a tow Rio begins
to get uneasy and scampers around the
deck in fear and trembling until Melggs
wharf is once again in sight.

to the request of its , employes . that the
working day include the hours â¢ from i
a. m. to 4 p. m. This association gave no
tice I that j unless the request- was acceded
to before May 1 decisive action would be
taken. The wishes of the employes were
for a reasonable day's work and coming
as^it did, during the height of the fruit
season, it was found necessary, to accede
to the demand. . ' . â¢ Â¦ -
- If â¢ this Is not done â¢ we shall 'call upon or

Justice is meted out to the Cooks' and Wait

move on the part I of the employers' associa

union houses that now exist. If this is true
we- will .try .to keep them busy maklrur pur
chases. Reports coming in from all sources
go to show that the union houses are doing
business- to their full capacity,' and In many

The only change which has taken place so
far as our end of the flg-ht Is concerned is that
we are continually adding: to the list of fair
houses, having placed fifteen more union cards
to-day, and the .demand constantly increases.
The demand, for union men and women has
increased to such an extent that' nearly two
thirds of our members are at present employed
under union conditions. It has come- to our
ears in an unofficial manner that. outside par
ties not directly interested in this controversy
are interfering and . that certain threats ' are
belnsr made. We .wish to state that while we
do not take any great amount of stock in ru
mors, .yet this fight is- of so serious a nature
that we feel a word of warninc at this time
would not be amiss. This fight was not of
our chooslne, . having been forced upon us by
the absolute refusal - on the part of the em
ployers' association to treat with our commit
tee. That being the case, we request those not
directly interested to keep their hands off and
allow us to settle this matter between our

â¢ From the Cooks'- and Waiters' Alliance
the following was given as the condition
governing the situation:
What the Waiters Say.
The restaurant men contend that the strike
inaugurated by the Cooks' and Walters' . Alli
ance is a thing of the past. Several who ac
ceded to the demands of the union found that
it was IniDoeslble to continue business under
their supervision and with the class of l help
that they furnished. One in particular closed
to-day. It seems that he had no cook. and up
to- 10 a. m. the shop steward was unable to
furnish him with any, and consequently find
ing that the union could, not live up, to 'its
agreement he ; apaln Joined the Restaurant
Keepers' Association." At the headquarters
last eveninsr the restaurant men seemed very
jubilant, in fact, considered the fight to be
over, no better verification being: needed than
the fact that bona fide members of the union
had applied at the Restaurant Keepers'. Em
ployment Bureau, for situations and had been
liven ,them.
Both sides present the condition of the
strike in carefully worded statements. At
the meeting of the restaurant-keepers the
following statement was given out;
The principal places closed during the
day were the California Dairy Kitchen,
Swain's Lunch House, Martin A. C. Chris
tensen's and the Golden West Restaurant.
EHfEerent causes are assigned by proprie
tors and employes. In some places it
was said repairs were being made.
Regarding the calling out of the hotel
help, every one is silent, although there Is
an idea abroad that- this will follow at? a
critical time. None of those interested
will speak for publication, - but arrange
ments are being made on both sides to
meet this possible contingency.
, Both sides are confident of victory in the
trouble between the restaurant proprietors
and- -their employes. Yesterday was
marked with - less excitement . than the
opening of the strike.: A less strict patrol
was maintained on the streets. During the
busy j hours 'of the day there was less
than the usual number of people in many
of , the restaurants. > A number of eating
houses were closed through â¢ inability . to
secure the requisite help.' .
Possibly the- great, struggle will com
mence to-night, when the matter of boy
cotting, "unfair" restaurants is brought
before, the: San Francisco Labor Council.
A number of organizations have through

CURT QUESTION
PUT TO KEVANE
Attorney General Wants
to Know About New
Clerks.
Governor Pays Off His Debt
to Curry With Ford's
Patronage.
It Is now In order that Dan Kevane,
secretary of the State Board of Ex
aminers, explain why he wrote to
Attorney General Ford on April 4,
assuring him . that he would- -be
notified When Â«thÂ© ' board met to
consider the appointment of the three ad
ditional clerks, although the choice had
been made March 29. and the Controller
informed of the appointments. The At
torney General wrote to Kevane yester
day morning, inclosing The Call's story of
the manner in which he had been dished
out of his share of patronage, and curtly
asking Kevane for an explanation of the
situation.
General Ford can no longer doubt that
Hark, Taylor and Miss Nelson are in of
fice, as they have drawn salaries for
April, but he is waiting to know
why he was not notified of . the
meeting on March 29. if meeting
there was. and also why he was informed
six days later that no meeting had been
held to consider the appointments, and
that he would be duly notified of such
meeting. General Ford is not talking
much, but his silence is ominous of war
if the reply of V Secretary Kevane > is
not to his liking. He will have scores to
settle then with Kevane and with those,
cf his colleagues on the board who have
shown him a most palpable affront.
General Ford said last evening:
"I would â¢ prefer not to say anything
more at this time. I have just written,
to the secretary of the board at Sacra
mento for information concerning the
matter, and upon the receipt of his reply
1 shall have a better understanding . of
the situation.' I confess I am surprised
that the clerks have really been appointed
pnd have already drawn a month's salary.
However, I must ask you to excuse me
from saying anything more at this time."
As the affair is talked of among poli
ticians in hotel corridors and at the clubs
more details are being added to the pub
lished Ltory. It is said now and gener
ally accepted that Clark and Taylor were
lx>th Curry's appointees. Governor Gage
magnanimously giving up Ford's share of
the patronage to pay off an old debt of
his own to the Secretary of State, while
he turned his own share over to that
prime favorite and useful handy man of
his. Dan Kevane.
In the past the three members of the
board have divided the patronage as
equally as possible and there was no en
croachment. The Governor appointed the
secretary, that office not being part of
the beard's patronage. As a member of
the board, he named the assistant secre
tary as his share of the remaining ap
lwintments. General Ford named the
<lork ar.d the porter. Secretary of State
Curry was to have the appointment of the
expert, but there was Walter Parker to
be cared for, and Governor Gage request
<rd Curry to let him name the expert.
<"urry consented, saying there would be
more patronage in the future and he
would expect an additional appointment
when the time should come.
The time came March 29. but the pat
ronage so graciously surrendered to Curry
was Ford's chare, and not the Gover
nor's.
PENSION ATTOBErEYS
