because at that very moment the British
Consul. W. Clayton Pickersgill. lay
dangerously ill in a sanatorium at Ala
meda. None of us were aware of this
fact, but next afternoon, when the Con
sul's death was publicly announced, we
recalled with a feeling of awe and.won
der the statement made by Norman and
the remarkable astral appearance he
claimed to have seen. It is obvious that
if he had rr.ade his statement after the

perhaps as an attempt on his part to gain

run the length* of the- building. At tht
rear a transverse passage connects these,
so that it is possible for anybody starting
from one stairway to walk right around
the interior and come down at the other
end of the hall. Now, admitting the real
ity of Norman's ghostly visitant, we must
ask ourselves what he was doing in 'the
building at that time of night. . . <Â¦ â¢
Judging from the directlon:in which thÂ«
apparition approached it seems probable
that he had been to the consulate and had
ascended the stairway at the right-hand
end of the hall, /while. Norman used the
one on the left." 'a hen .the captain must
have made his way around the passages,
Peeking, doubtless from sheer., force of
habit,' the room in which his j live body
dwelt so long. All this, of course, is mere
Supposition; any man is at perfect liberty
to disbelieve it. But the death of Consul
Pickersgill so soon afterward supplies a
reasonable motive for this! astral visit,
and we may.well suppose that. his objec
tive point was the consulate, .which, of
course, he found locked at that hour of

<â¢ The -ghost of .Mary that was said to

quent among soldiers. General Deasalx's
premonition on the eve of the battle of
Marenso was another in point.
The next day the battle had been going
or only a Jew hours when Dessaix was
shot through the heart.
He had always been a brave man and
liad won his greatest laurels in Egypt.
He had not fought in any of Napoleon's
European battles, and this battle seemed
to cause him anxiety. The night befor*

ccrs: "Something will happen to me to
morrow. It is a long time since I fought
in Europe and the bullets here don't know
me any more." He went about arrang
ing his affairs as calmly as If he were on
a death bed. He ordered one of his staff
to remain close beside him on the morrow,

General Fitz John Porter tells of thre*
duch instances which he saw_ during 1 the
Mexican war.
. Captain. Drum and First Lieutenant
Benjamin of his battery j both felt tho

the siege of the City of Mexico. They told
Porter of it, and no cheering worda that
he conld say in any way affected their
belief. "IÂ»n't borrow trouble," he urged
them, but to no avail. And their fore
warning proved only too true. It was not
long before the tire of the Mexican infan
try wounded them both mortally.

the same siege who predicted his own
.death. "Good-by, Porter; I shall never

- But ( Norman is not" an imaginative-!
younj? man, nor has he any craving for
notoriety. He is- simply a plain, honest,
hard-working young fellow, and the look
of sincerity stamped on his face shows
that he thoroughly believes the truth of
his own narrative! Whether the specter
really existed or not Is a question upon
which the skeptic and believer in occult
ism may take sides, but at any rate there
is no doubt that Norman is sure he saw it.
Was It a wraith or warning apparition
come to announce the death of some one
connected with the building? Such things
belong to the realms of traditional lore;
primitive folk all over vne world have be
lieved In them for ages. The Scotch
Highlanders have a firmly rooted super
stition that the wraith or spectral appear
ance of a person about to die appears to
his friends at a distance and forewarn*
them of the event. But the peculiarity ;of
this case is that it was not the double "of
Consul Pickersgill which appeared; it was
his old-time friend. Captain Waterman,
who came with the ghostly message.
Now Captain Waterman was an aged
mariner, who had for many years occu
pied a room In this gloomy old building.
In his latter days he had fallen into needy
circumstances and eked out a precarious
livelihood as a peddler or agent. The
kindly hearted Consul Pickersgill sympa
thized with the poor old fellow and many
a time helped him out of a tight place.
Did the late captain, with occult, vision,
see the approach of his benefactor's death
and leave his resting place on the other
side to give what warning he could of the
sad event? If this had happened in ths
middle ages we should not have been sur
prised, but In modern, up-to-date, bust
ling, highly civilized San Francisco it Is
quite a different story.
Dr. Leland, the Coroner, is a clear
headed medical man, whose pra/etice has
given him much experience of the pecu
liarities of the human mind. "I quite be
lieve," he says, "that Norman believes
he saw the vision or apparition, or what
ever it was. But' that does not amount
to saying that it had really a tangible
psychical existence. I should put it down
as a case of hallucination, probably due
to overwrought nerves. All the same, If
I really believed I had seen such an ap-.
"paritlon nothing would induce me to con
tinue living in the building." ..
And Coroner Leland is right, for it cer
tainly Is an uncanny old structure, where
a man of sensitive nerves might, readily
imagine all kinds of blood-curdling things.
It Is one of the few early time large of
fice buildings, dating back fronvthe '50's,
left in San Francisco. With the' huge
Montgomery block, but a short distance
away, it stands as an enduring monument
to the enterprise of the pioneers of that
golden era,* Unlike most of the other
buildings of that time, it has never been
modernized â It l.as never even been fitted
with an elevator. Viewed from the light'
of the present day the Interior plan of the
structure is somewhat peculiar. It is only
three stories in height, "and a -wide stair
way leads from the entrance on Battery
street to the second floor, where, there is
a large, lofty hall. Behind this is a great
room, originally designed for the Mer
chants' Exchange. Later on, in 1861, when
Sacramento was flooded out, it was used
by the California Legislature as a State
Capitol, and afterward it became | the
meeting place of the Federal Supreme
Court. On this foor, in the front, is the
large office of the British consulate,
where the late W. Clayton PickerBgill
Bpent all his working hours and did so
much valuable service 10 his countrymen.
In view of Norman's statement it be
comes important to consider jthe Interior
plan of the structure. Two narrow wind-
Ing stairways lead from this hall to the
/CAME home late last night,
having been to the theater with
a friend. I live on the third
floor, which is reached by a wind
ing staircase turning from the main
hallway on the second floor. The
stairs arc old and creak very much,
so, not wishing to disturb the jan
itor's wife, zcho sleeps on the same
floor, we took off our shoes at the
foot of the hall staircase.
"I went up first, my friend de
laving below. When I reached the
top I could sec clear dozen the long
passage which leads to the rear of
the building. There was a gas
light burning and there zvas suffi
cient light to see anybody quite
plainly. The passage was empty,
but as I zcas about to go along it
I heard footsteps coming along the
other passage at the rear of the
building, which crosses this one at
right angles. I hesitated, feeling
somczi'hat nervous, and wondering
who could be walking about the old
building at this time of night. It
might be a burglar.
"T'-c footsteps sounded quite
loudly on the bare boards. They
came nearer and nearer. Whoever
it was ez'idcntly carried a stick, for
I could hear it tap-tapping on the
floor. Then it turned the corner,
and in the full light' I saw Captain
Waterman, who used to live in the
building, and who died several
months ago.
"I am positive it was the cap
tain, for I knew him well. He was
dressed just as he used to be in
life, in a shabby suit of dark
clothes, and had the same old felt
hat on his head. His stick was the
seme, too, and he leaned on it in
the same way, for he was old and
weak. As he came closer I could
distinguish- his features clearly.
The, only thing peculiar about him
was his eyes, which seemed to have
an uncanny gleam in than.
"When he got about half way
along the passage he seemed to sec
inc. He hesitated, stopped in front
of one of the doorj for a moment,
then titrncd and walked rapidly
back, disappearing around the cor
ner.
"Of course I was frightened. In
fact I think I was paralyzed with
horror for the moment. Then I
gained strength to call out to my
friend, 'Come up, quick, here's
Captain Waterman.' My friend
came up, but lie saw nothing, for
by that time the captain had gone
around the corner.
"I was perfectly sober, for I
hair aki'ays been a teetotaler. I
never bclicz'cd in ghosts before, but
now I think differently. I am as
certain as I stand here that I saw
Captain Waterman."

that the reception was in his honor, but
before he could prepare Â¦ " his speech "of

stepped from the train and. was received
with tumultuous applause. .He proved to

curiosity being excited; I, left; my. grip at
the hotel and instructed my driver to fol
low the military procession, which finally
took position in front of the palace of tile
President of the state of Carabobo.
Crowds of people were looking through
the iron bars of the windows, which in
this climate . are , nearly s always without
glass, into a large room on the ground
floor, where could be seen the executive in
consultation, with some members of his
cabinet. It does hot appear, to be bad
form in South America to look into the
living. rooms of a family or into the of
fice of a merchant or an official. -Indeed,
I was told that to drive people away from
the front of your house will lay. you{ open
positions with his cwn adherents. Then
only does he order :yi election for Presi
dents and Governois of the various
States, which election is little more than
a ratification of the will of the dictator.
This is the course that v/as pursued by
Castro. That he is a man of unusual
bravery even his enemies admit. Twenty
nine times since he came into power he
has been called upon to defend his title on
the field of battle and has done so each
time victoriously. Rome weeks before our
visit last February dissatisfaction had
manifested Itself among the soldiers of
one of the regiments. * When that fact
was reported to the President he ran, un
accompanied by any' one, with drawn
sword into the barracks, rushed among
the mutineers, cut two of them down, and
then, with flashing eyes. looked about him.
and said, "Who else among you Is dis
satisfied?" The soldiers, filled with ad
miration for such bravery, broke into
cheer after cheer for President Ciprlano
Castro and from malcontents were at
once converted into ardent admirers of so
bold a leader.
If political stability could be secured for
Venezuela the republic would be. sure to
attract' sufficient capital to bring^pro
nounced prosperity. At present a valuable
harvest of coffee, sugar, cocoa, etc., is at
the mercy of the first -revolutionary
leader who needs funds. If the planter
whose harvest is taken belongs to 'the
party of the revolutionist he receives
scrip in payment. This scrip, worthless
if the revolution fails, has only moderate
prcrpect . for redemption .if the rising is
successful, unless the crop or merchan
dise so taken belongs to 'a' foreigner, Â¦when
his Government is likely to ask for per
haps ten times the value of- the actual
loss, and a compromise 'settlement Is apr
to be made lor one-half the sum asked.
I had the good fortune to become well
acquainted with the individual who holds
the position second In power to that of the
President of Venezuela, for he is the Gov
ernor of the State of Carabobo, the largest
of the fifteen commonwealths that consti
tute the republic It came about as fol

for the capital; the distance as the bird
flies to Caraccas is six miles, but the
traveler covers twenty-three miles be
tween the two points over one of the most
remaikable railroads in the world, which
ascends four thousand feet to the moun
tain of La Silla, from which the view of
the ocean is inspiring.
After a twenty-four hours' stay in Car-,
acas I* went to Valencia, the second larg
est town in the republic. Arriving at the
station I was surprised by the firing of
It Is the unwritten law of Venezuela

In that capacity he removes all important

Characteristic of the instability of po
litical conditions In the country was the
remark of a wealthy resident of the cap
ital made to the writer .on that occasion.
"It is not impossible," â¢ said hp. "that
when Castro returns the Yellow. House
(President's official residence) may have
another occupant."
President Castro's avowed ambition is
to be considered by his countrymen a
Â¦worthy follower of Bolivar. If the saying
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the
crown" does net apply to the chief mag
istrate of Venezuela it is because that of
ficial wears a wide-brimmed sombrero in
stead of a crown. But that the life of this
ruler of the northernmost republic of
South America is insecure and that he Is
aware of the fact is manifest. When he
drives through the streets his carriage Is
preceded by two armed outriders and fol
lowed by a troop of cavalry. When he left
Caracas for a few hours to dine on board
of our steamer he was constantly sur
rounded in the street, at the station and
in the railway carriage by armed men.
Caracas Is the capital of the country.
The pavements of the streets of the city
are in a deplorable condition as a result
of a recent earthquake. Driving there
lore is uncomfortable, and not a few
buildings are cracked, some even in a
dangerous state. Among the interesting
buildings are the Federal Palace (Yellow
House), Crico del Torro (bull fight rink),
the university, the museum, the theater
and the pantheon. In the market place
stands a sun dial made by Alexander von
Humboldt, the celebrated author of "Cos
mos." The pantheon Is the Westminster
Abbey of Venezuela. Here are buried its
â¢noted deadâ men who have rendered such
Bervice to the republic as entitles them to
a niche in this temple of fame. The chief
place appropriately is given to General
Bolivar, who was In a fight with the
French' In behalf of the American colo
nies, then returned to his own country
and having fired the hearts of his people
with his own enthusiasm for liberty, led
them to victory against Spain, and so be
came the liberator of his country and the
Washington of South America.

The two principal parties ars Liberals,
represented by the nresent Government,
and the Nationals, now in insurrection.
A few years ago a faction of the Liber
als, headed by the then President, advo
cated the division of the country into
twenty-one states in violation of the con
stitution, whiph provides only for fifteen
commonwealths. Castro In this dispute,
which as usual culminated in rebellion,
led the defenders of the constitution, and
being victorious was swept into power.

IS92 to disregard this provision led to a
revolution. Revolutions here, as in all
Spanish- American countries, are frequent.
Bocks on the history "of Venezuela are
unreliable because they are compiled by
partisans. Not many books of history are
for sale, because those written by the ad
herents of one side are suppressed so soon
as the opposite side goes into power. But
without these books sufficient data arc
available to show that the chief magis

â¢ conscious that my sentences were fear
fully' and wonderfully made and must
.have been a source of amusement to the
five or six gentlemen who listened to me,
only an occasional smile showed that the
President or his friends noticed my nu
merous blunders. Indeed, they all ap
peared interested and some one was al
ways ready to, help me out with a word
when I was in' need of a suggestion.
Having received permission to use the
interview for publication I suggested that
it might add to the interest of the story
if the President would let me take his
photograph. After a little hesitation, he
replied: "If you take my picture it must
include that of my official family." This
suited me exactly, and so all stepped out
in the courtyard and submitted to be
posed by my traveling companion, a well
known. Colorado mining speculator, and
the picture was taken. ,
A military officer who had been an In-'
terested spectator . then stepped up and
said: "Senor, since you have taken the
Vcivil portion of the President's official
family, do you not think that you should
also photograph his military staff ?"'â¢ "We
cheerfully consented and soon a group of
officers composing some of the flower of
the Venezuelan,, army were captured by
an unarmed American.
It was then suggested to postpone the
remainder of the interview until after
dinner to permit the Cabinet to finish its
business, and it was agreed that an aid
should be sent for us in the evening. On
arriving at our hotel we found that the
general in whose honor the military dis
'play had taken place earlier in the day
was a guest at the same hostelry. As he
was alone we invited him to dine with us

On returning to the President's mansion
I. spent another very enjoyable hour. Don
Geronimo Maldonado is scarcely 25 years
of age:. he is the youngest man who has
ever held the position of Governor of a
state in either North. Central or South
America. He has taken part in several
revolutions and has proven himself an
able officer in battle and a fearless fighter.
Educated as a physician, he is also an
author, having written and published four
books, one of which treating on the poli
tics of his country*, he presented
to your correspondent. He is as
suming and possesses considerable mag
netism and seems to be 'a born lead
er of men. Personally he is more at
tractive than his picture would lead one
to suppose. Having reached at his age in
point of influence and power and dignity
the second position in his native land, one
need not be a prophet to foresee that
sooner or later he will become the Presi
dent of the entire confederacy. "When I
expressed this view to him I added that
â¢whenever the telegram would announca
his elevation to the Presidential chair I
would claim it as my privilege to be the
hrst one to send from the United States a
congratulatory dispatch. These remarks
did not apparently displease him and they
were received with applause by his
friends. Jokingly I added that I would
try to find some American maiden fit to
be the bride of such a hero, that I would
show her his photo and if it pleased the
maiden send her picture In return. "Who

It is the dream of both CiDiiano Castro
and Geronimo Maldonado to elevate ths
rank and file of their army to the dignity
of European and American soldiers, anil""
if they succeed Venezuela will take front
rank among Spanish-American republics.
The Venezuelan army now consists of
20,000 men. A law for making- military
service compulsory, modeled after that oJ
France or Germany, Js now under con
sideration, but in the past and now when
recruits are needed an officer with a flls
of soldiers is sent into the streets of tha
city or in the country roads and twenty,
thirty or more young^fellows belonging to
the lower walks of life are captured after
the style of the press gang of the English
navy of a century ago. The recruit is
made to serve at a distance from his
home. His family waits for his return a
few days or a week and then first sur
mises and afterward settles into the con
viction that the young man has gone to
become one of the soldiers of his country.
Illiterate, forced into the ranks, with
out pride in their profession, what can
such men know about true courage, mili
tary honor or patriotism? It is- not sur
prising, therefore, that when they are
taken prisoners in battle, instead of going
to prison they join their captors and fight
against their former friends. One regi
ment of American troops under a Roose
ve!t or a Funston could march from one )
end of Venezuela to the other without
successful resistance from the army of
that country as It exists to-day.

The chief point of interest we passed
in the course of this early morning in
terval was a sudden swerve in the road
where the same diligencia had been cap
sized on its last inbound trip, which mis
hap had resulted in a broken leg to one,
besides various bruises sustained by oth
er of the occupants. The detail? of this
little Incident were furnished us by a fel-
For the first four hours of the journey
the darkness of our somewhat spare ac
commodations 'was of an Intensity that,
under ordinary circumstances, must cer
tainly have produced a corresponding de
gree of monotony. Not so in this case,
however. The Yaqui driver and his staff
were too industriously occupied with in
fusing life into the motive power of our
equipage to admlt^of any such tendency
to dullness. The power in question con
sisted of half a dozen diminutive mules,
hitched two abreast in the rear and four
in the van, after the prevalent custom
of the country. The characteristic per
versity of this curiously incorporated
strinsr explained the necessity of so largo
a corps of drivers. Their method was for
the chief functionary to hold the lines,
while his two lieutenants raced along on
either side of the unwilling team, which
they sought to terrorize into a perpetual
scamper through the- agency of long
lashed whips of the blacksnake variety.
This heroic process 'Â¦ the entire trip con
tinuously interspersed with a series of
such hair-curling warwheoops as only the
Indian can devise. AH of which consti
tuted a most suggestive, accompaniment
to our silent reflections on the long list
of casualties, to which we' were" aware
our chosen route was solely indebted "for
its fame.
However, as previously explained, con
ditiens had improved somewhat at the
time we undertook the trip, quite two
Â¦weeks having elaosed since the last mas
sacre had been enacted on the road we
were to traverse. Nevertheless, on the.
occasion of our visit to Hermosillo, it
had occurred to General Torres that wa
might feel more at ease if accompanied
by an armed escort over the most hostile
portions of the route^to which end I car
ried- the necessary credentials, entitling;
us to such protection at any of tha mili
tary outposts we would pass. - ~ â¢
At all events there was clearly no other
salvation for the company's contract, and
the experiment was forthwith put to the
test. The innovation worked to perfec
tionâso far as the mails were concerned.
Tru*. the belligerent hostiles, from their
roadside retreats, continued to make tar
gets of such passengers as were so un
wary as to obtrude their personalities
from behind the wagon screens. . but tfce
vehicle it?elf, so long as a Yaqul driver
was perched on the box, never once failed
to get through on schedule time.
It was the postal subsidy that mast be
protectedâ the passengers could look out
for themselves. .

the leagues of desert highway that must
be traversed each trip are, thanks to the
rigorously conducted campaign of the
Mexican troops, Jess grave than formerly;
which condition, however, does not alter
the fact that the service has continued
right along throughout the whole prog
ress of the war, and with eincular regu
larity, considering: the frequency with
Â¦which the drivers and their crews at the
outstart had to be renewed. The^rel.mt
less policy of the Yaquis in repeatedly
picking off the Mexican drivers, and the
consequent dearth of these functionaries,
that early developed, impejled the stage
company to resort to a desperate expe
dient. It was reasoned that the Yaquis
were in the habit of sending out members
of their band from time to time to seek
employment on the various haciendas
with a view to replenishing their ammuni
tion and -other supplies essential to the
continuance of hostilities. Therefore, why
not secure immunity for the Government
malls by recruiting their stage crews from
among these ubiquitous tribesmen? True,
such a. measure promised no additional
safeguard to their passenger service,*i)Ut

to patrol the district. /.The ".invention,
however, had speedily proved a .failure,
for the first sentry who mounted to the
perch was picked . off by a Yaqui sharp
shooter before he: had secured so much
as a preliminary glimpse of the surround-
We stopped the diligencia long enough
to secure a photograph of the grewsoma
thing in the mesquite tree, and then re
sumed our journey. A little farther on we
drove into the village of Las Guasimas,
the first military post of importance in
the Yaqui country." g The place consisted
of an adobe cuartel, or barracks,' sur
rounded by a wretched assortment of
thatched Indian huts. Here we had ex
pected to secure an armed escort, as the
remainder of our journey lay through the
very hotbed of the hostile district. But,
upon applying to the officer in command,
we were informed that his entire garrison
had gone in pursuit of a band of Yaquis
that only two days before had visited the
suburbs of the village and made off to the
mountains with a bunch of fourteen cattle
belonging to the post. This raid was sup
posed to- have been made by the largest
of the various marauding bands, in retal
iation for the defeat they had sustained
j at the hands of the Mexicans a short time
previously. On the occasion in question
the troops had . tracked ' the hostiles to
their principal stronghold in the Sierras
de la Bacatete, and, in the fight that, en
sued ten Yaquis were killed, forty women
and children taken prisoners and the vil
lage destroyed. The casualties sustained
by the Mexicans in this engagement were
but four wounded. The captive Indian
women and children were confined in the
cuartelat this place, where we were per
mitted to photograph them. "When first
brought to 1the post they were in a pitiable
condition from lack of food and harsh
treatment at the hands of their aboriginal
lords and masters. Hence their present
captivity, insuring them, as it does, plen
tiful food and kindly protection, is in tha
nature of a boon to them.

men, and thus equipped at once proceeded
on our Journey through the Rio TaquI
basin. The Taqul is a beautiful crystal
line stream of considerable volume and,
winds its tortuous course ' through a. val
ley of surpassing fertility. It was this
region that the Indiana ', were formerly *
allotted by the Mexican Government as
their exclusive domain. There is abso
lutely no evidence, however, that Its rich
Iand3 have ever been cultivated by them,
as it is to a great extent densely over
grown with mesqulte trees. In the midst
of these thickets the Taquis have dwelt
for many years, constantly fostering their
deep-seated hatred of the white man and
his civilized tendencies. The missionary
priests have labored among them in vain,
as the more earnestly they would strive
for the uplifting of the Taqul the mora
bitterly they would be despised by him.

Richard should really not be allowed to
fly into literary gardens too far from
home after this latest effort of his pen.
Some day some big collector of rareties
will come along with a net of extra size
and Richard wll! find himself pinned to
the wall as the biggest "Aurore de Pro

Brown & Co., Boston. Price $1 50.)
"The fairy tale he had read to Adeline,
though in some respects symbolic only of
the experiences of his : spirit, was yet in
one respect so externally faithful to . his
own story that there is hardly need to tell
again how he had seen Meriel for the first
time."

One point that I had almost overlooked: i
it; is really of such small. significance in
the" story. ~ I can \ heat the cry, "But why j
is the book called 'The Love Letters of/
the Kins*?"' "The Love Letters , of the '
King" is a bit cf Pagan's own writing, a
fiction that he evolves for the benefit of :
Adeline Wood. Jji j this little, story . he '
tells a.Hegorically ; of .his> o-Â»-n.-. love fpr
Meriel, or, as the author explains:
Here is the end. Pagan "Wasteneys goes

Don't hold your ears and scream, for

Richard is of too kindly a" disposition for
that, as I wrote, in my first lines. He
merely takes the revolver and "from
Fheer glee of living and joy that be was

Wasteneys. gives a house party and is

Then he goes.txick to London and writes
yoetry on â¢The Saa Heart of Pagan Was

As a boy he "had known that mystic
â¢apport with nature in rare complete

I do not wrong the gentleman. This may,
ifter all, be merely a fevered vision iu
luced by a forced reading of the booÂ«c.
If Mr. Le Galiienne had wasted only his
sv.n time there mi?bt have^-been no cause
'or complaint: but think of his publisher's
lime: then think of the compositors' time,
Â«nd lrst. think of the "gentle" reader's
timeâ for Mr. Le Galiienne is not content
tvith allowing' his manuscript to bask in
:be mellow glow cf his own literary sanc
tum, but must needs bring it forth into
lhe glare of worldly light through the
nedium of the volume duly printed and

The publishers and compositors, it is to
Â»e hoped, received sufficient pecuniary
Â«muneration to make ihcm feel that their
ime -was not wholly wasted. It is on the

'alls heaviest. Yet even he may heed a

lis time even on such precious gems as

Richard.
Mr. Le Galiienne calls his book "The
Z-ove Letters of the King", for two prime
â¢easons. First, because "love letters';
lave been the vogue and the advertise-,
aaent Is good; and second, because these:
"love letters"' mentioned in the title have;
tbout a.s little to do with the book as;
inything else. â¢ Two 'cauital reasons.

dowed with a # certain amount of

As in all things else, they don't like to

too, the wind out there' makes it difficult

The southern players nearly all learned
to play in the old country* C. E. Orr,
John Lawson, B. D..Adamson and C. E.
Maud all knew the game as it is played
in Scotland and England before they
were interested in America at all. Each
and every one of them is right at the top
notch. Lawson in particular is a wonder.
He raises his club with a good, strong
swing and the ball flies anywhere from
220 to 250 yards. He practically doubles
the distance that can be made in any oth
er game. One hundred and fifty yards is
considered a great distance in cricket, but
no sport has yet reached the distance
that yclf has.
The best American-born players are
Worthington Ames. E. R. Folger, R. M.
Fitzgerald. W. J. Johnson, C. P. Hubbard,
H. B Goodwin and J. W. Byrne. Folger
plays a remarkably steady and often a
brilliant game. The best one he ever put
up was when he defeated Champion Law

Everybody has been practicing like mad

many others .doing the same thing, not

Besides golf there -will be a fast and fu

A pleasure. That is what she is ever
seeking, and this time it is to be found in
the golf and polo tournaments, in the
steeplechase and the races.
For "swell society, high society, real so
ciety," has gone In head over heels for
outdoor sports. It is her pet hobby and
she intends to prove how well she has rid
den it.
The champions of the south are to com
pete with the bay cities* low scorers. It
is to be a battle royal, and the enthusi
asts are hobnobbing and betting over tea
cups and talking and dreaming of noth
ing else â unless it is what they are going
to wear. Of course that is an important
question everywhere, but it is the vital
one at Del Monte, particularly when the
place is crowded to overflowing with
swelldom's best representatives.-
In golf the two B'sâ Bowers and Brown
â stand the highest- And they both put
up a rattling good game. Mrs. R. Gilman
Brown is a member of the San Rafael
Club and plays morning, noon and night.
It is a regular craze with her. While she
Is not a very powerful player, she is re
markably steady and accurate. Her
*'pick-up" is clean and she rarely "tops"
a ball. She is like the men who drive
epikes with a sledgehammer â never
misses and never varies the sixteenth of
en inch.
On the other side Mrs. J. W. Bowers of
Southern California has a long and pow
erful drive and can reach the "green" be
fore one has time to realize that she has
fairly started. Both are champions in
their part of the country, and it remains
to be seen who will be the champion cf
the Pacific Coast
' The Presidio golfers will give the Pasa
dena and Los Angeles people a good rub.
Miss Alice Hager has come to the front
wonderfully the past year. By the way,
all good players say it takes fully three
years to set up a good, steady game, and
that it takes constant, almost daily prac
tice.
So any one can see that golf is not a
poor man's pastime. It takes too much
time and too much money. It is not un
common to lose six or seven balls, which
cost half a dollar apiece, and it is more
than common to break a club, which costs
In the neighborhood of three dollars.
Then the necessary caddy earns a
dollar and a ouarter or a dollar and a
half a day, to say nothing of the Scotch
and sod', which is a distinct part "of the
game. If there are eighteen holes to
cover It is a dry, long walk. So it is
nothing to spend ten dollars a day.^and
that does not include dues or fees. San
Francisco is behind other large cities when,
it comes to golfing, for she has no public
links, And ordinary folks are unable to
play on the private ones.
Most people imagine that more than
rolt is played ordinarily. That is not so
In this city, and the club is a nine days'
wonder to all the neighboring ones. No
one can say that the girls go to the links
for a quiet flirtation on the side. It is a
very rare thing that the men and women
play together. A man never plays golf
with his wife and very seldom with any
other man's, which may seem stranger.
The ladies are practically barred from
the links on Saturdays, Sundays and holi
days and the men have full sway. When
Jt chances that they meet there is no
loitering. Even at the clubhouse there is
no sociability. The girls have their pri
vate sitting room and they stay closely
at home. The men have their living room,
and while they probably would like to' see
more of the sir Is there seems to be a
"keep off the grass" sign suspended in
visibly in the air.
The Oakland Club has won for itself a
came exactly the opposite. They aie
called familiarly "the big family." <The
girls and boys sit on the porch, swing
tbeir feet and chat by the hour. They
have the swellest little luncheons and the
longest games and the best times that
ever happened. The clubhouse is nearly
always crowded and everybody knows
where to spend a quiet but thoroughly en
joyable afternoon.
And the same thing is virtually true of
the San Rafael links. While there are
not sc many in evidence, the old custom
of "eat. drink and be merry" is attended
to right heartily. The girls have an in
centive to wear flying skirts, red top
boots and soft hats that fall all over their
heads. They know that a swagger, golt
suit is wonderfully becoming and that it
is not wasted on the ocean air as are the
Presidio lassies*.
Whether their playing Is as good re
mains to be seen.
Mtes Maud Mullins has been learning
how to steer clear of the "bunkers," -and
she can teach old hands a thing or two.
When Alice Hoffman challenges her the
game is well worth going out to see. Min

THE GOLF AND
POLO
TOURNAMENTVSITORS of the British Museum, in
specting the antiquities in the
Egyptian rooms, are much inter
ested in the array of cat mummies
in one of the wall cases. Wonder is often
expressed why cats and crocodiles should
have been embalmed and why the gods of
Egypt should have various' animal heads,
such as the lion, the jackal, the Ibis and
the hawk. It seems so incr<*1ibly stupid,
as well as so superstitious, considering
how advanced the Egyptians were in civ
ilization and culture. They could build
temples, erect massive obelisks and carry
out great engineering works. There are
sculptured figures in the museum which
date from 3500 B. C. There are manufac
tured articles and specimens of writing
probably a thousand years older than
that. The ancient people possessed an in
ecnious form of hieroglyphic " writing In
which a feather was the letter A and a
lion the letter L. But a feather was also
the emblem of truth and all the letters
had been emblems or symbols of things
and qualities. ".
Does It not occur to^us that perhaps the
animal heads were symb8lic also and l-th'e
cats and crocodiles were embalmed Â¦ be
cause of their sacred significance? Â¦ The
Egyptians were not fools and we must
not laugh at their, worship of the cat
without seeking to v understand it. â¢ :
Trees, serpents and other things had a
place in the religious symbolism of the
Egyptians. The persea tree .seems to
mark the place of sun rising^on midsum'
mer day, and, curiously, there,. was "a
"g^eat cat" connected with this tree. In
the seventeenth chapter of 'the "Book of
the^ Dead";; the cat Is explained to be Ra
himself, the chief god. A serpent ' was
often carried in long mystical procession

resented in the act of cutting off its head.

symbolism Â¦ of the Egyptians., The â¢ lion,'

other ' animals each had . its ; special sig

a sacred bull called the Apis, was { kept
at Memphis- and treated with great- re

more than twenty-five years, and the
most likely reason is. that he. represented
a lunar cycle of twenty-five years, which
must terminate punctually. jWhen he

procession: people would ask and tell; how
old he was, and heVwould thus be a

urally he>as drowned at the age of 25,
because. the new cycle' had 'to begin/ and
a new, divine 'Apis must be ; found. But
he was honored by-being embalmed and
buried ; in, a â¢ granite sarcophagus in the
neighborhood' of the ; pyramids. }] ,[Â¦
,'; The burial place of the sacred bulls was
cliscovered by Mariette in^ 1831, and every
visitor to" Egypt goes to see , these tombs.
Each of ; the : stone 'coffins had its .mem

twentieth year,- under the reign of King
Psametik I,,; the majesty : of i living
Apis "departed to heaven. This god ' was
carried in peace* (to his burial) to the
beautiful land^of , the blest." . ' -
Â¦ Now' there v was , a ; burial â¢ placed for ' sa
cred cats, as well as sacred bulls, ahd^the
reason was no] doubt the"- sameâ namely,
that they, had' a place in the; symbolic
worship. A cemetery of cats existed near
Bubastis, which is the modern Tel-Basta,
not far from Zag-a-zig Junction, on the
railway. Buried in the . mound ' M. Na
ville. some ,. years ago found v the ruined
temple of Bast or Pasht, the cat goddess,
who gave her name to -the city.' The
foundation of Bubastis carries us back to
the beginning of ; the historical . times of
Egypt and,, is ; contemporary with â the
pyramids, the oldest monuments. . ;
: Herodotus', says: ''The . temple' stands in
the middle of the city and is visible on all
sides as one; walks around it; for, as the
city; has been raised ; up by an embank
ment while the temple has been left un
touched in its original condition, you look
down upon : it .wherever, you*are.. A low
wall runs r around y the rinclosure,; .having
figures engraved upon it, and inside there
is a grove of. beautiful tall trees growing
around the shrine which contains the* Im
age, of the; goddess." And concerning the
goddess ; herself he says: "The
of the Egyptians is the same as the Ar-
temls of the Greeks." To this we may
add that the Artemis, of the Greeks is
generally said to be the same as the
Diana of the Romans, a goddess of light
representing the moon. Â¦
Thus we see that Bast or Pasht was
connected with the cat on the one hand
and the moon on the other. So It Is quite
feasible that puss when she figures as a
symbol In the Egyptian worship repre
sents something in the domain of astron
omy and the calendar. , Ovid calls the cat
the sister of the moon, and says that
Pasht took the form of a cat to avoid
-Typhon. According to Plutarch a cat
placed in a lustrum denoted the moon It
is a ni S ht animal and its eyes glisten in"
the dark. Hyde Clarke remarks that
there are phenomena of periodicity In the
cat which are supposed to have given rise
to its relationship to the moon.- What I
think I have discovered, or at least made
clearer than it was before, is that the cat
was an intercalary month, added In the
one hundred and twentieth year to rectify
the calendar.â Gentleman's Magazlns.

7. OR something over 'two years General Robert A. Friedricli
JL~^ was United States Attorney for Alaska, and during that
time convicted more criminals than all his predecessors-com
bined since the Territory came under the szcay of civil government
in 1884. The result of his labors is that life and property in Alaska
to-dav are said to be safer than in any State or Territory west of
the Mississippi River.
General Fricdrich writes this account of the Horton murder,
and as he was the prosecuting attorney at that trial he may justly
be considered as one in authority to knoiv zvhercof he spcaks-'and
not the man to be other than an impartial judge. In this respect
his story is witness for itself.
That murder of Horton and his young wife on an island in
the wild Alaskan waters is certainly one of the most fiendish and
remarkable in the history of crime. None the less interesting is the
character af Hanson. His evolution from a red-handed savage to a
God-fearing man is made consistent through the virile pen of Gen
eral Friedrich.
Thus far I have attempted to describe
what, up to the killing of Horton and his
Â¦wife and distribution of their effects, was
simply a savage murder and robbery, the
result of a conspiracy which had for its
Inception the belief that in some way
either those or some other white person or
persons were responsible for the loss of
the Indian canoe and it3 . occupants. It
was shown in ' evidence that as they
pushed off from Sullivan Island they all
gave vent to a weird cry, which as given
in court sounded like the angry growl of
a "wolf â "oo-ah-oo, oo-ah-oo." An old
white woman, who had been with the In
dians twenty years, testified that It
responsible party.
After the murder ihe Indians out the
two bodies in blankets, carried them down
near high water mark, dug a hols la ths
sand among the boulders, ' placed ths
bodies, therein, covered them over with
the tent, weighting it down with stones,
and over all they piled branches from
trees. Previous to doing this, they took
from the body of Horton a watch and
some $75 in money. One- hundred and
twenty dollars in. gold was â¢ found on the,
body when afterward exhumed. From
Mrs. Horton they took several rings,
among others her' wedding ring. This
.property was divided among the Indians,
Hanson took the rifle and the money was
divided among the other Indians. The
watch and rings, including Mrs. Horton's
wedding ring, was found by the Deputy
Marshal in Kichtoo's cabin. The shotgun
had letters on it, which one of the In
dians, Mark Klanat, who could read and
speak English, decided to be the initials
of the man they had murdered and that
its retention would be dangerous, so It
was broken over a log and secreted with
the woman's clothing in a little tin trunk,
all of which were afterward found and
produced at the trial.
When they arrived In sight of the tent
the white man with a j gun in his hands
was I standing near the entrance and mo
tioned them to keep off. The woman was
not in sight. As undoubtedly had been
prearranged Mark Klanat spoke to the
white man for the purpose of attracting
his attention. The moment he looked to
ward him. Hanson, quick as a flash and
with unerring aim., shot him through the
heart and he fell without a moan. At thla
moment Mrs. Horton ran from the rear of
the tent screaming and calling to her hus
band, who lay some twenty feet away.
Kichtoo fired two shots at her, both tak
ing effect, one' through the face, the other
In the upper part of her body. She fell
.and as Kesh, the Indian boy, testified,
"squealed." -The Indians gathered around
her and Jim Williams, who claimed at the
trial that Hanson pointed his gun at him
and at the same time handing him a knife.
The story of the Indians materially
differs on minor points as to what oc
curred immediately upon coming upon the
wh!te people, but Jim Hanson's story,
which I believe to be true, was substan
tially, as follows:
leap ashore. As he did so he exclaimed:
"Kahk-won-tons, make "your hearts
strong I" He was followed by seven of the
Indians. Una-hootch, Martha Hanson and
Goos remained with th(* canoe.
â¢ When the canoe grounded Hanson, with
his Winchester in hand, was the first to
leader. Although young, he was a man of
magnificent physique and marvelous cour
age. He was known as a "bear fighter"
and had , killed with his knife (which I now
have) in hand to hand encounters, it was
claimed, over 100 of these formidable
animals. His hunting fields were along
the Chilkat River, its tributaries and the
interior of . that portion of the country
.bounded by the mountain range bordering
on Lynn Canal. â¢

About this time the Indian tribe known
as the Kahk-won-tons arid certain of the
Chilkats concluded to have a: sort of in
ter-tribal potlatch (which is Indian for a
general council), lasting sometimes a week
or ten days, with plenty to eat and all the
alcoholic drinkables; they, can possibly
procure. A brother of Jim Hanson, ac
companied by his wife, and a boy, nephew
of the woman and son of Una-hootch, one
of the Indians subsequently arrested," emA
barked in a canoe for the purpose of visit
ing "other Indians and soliciting supplies
for the great council-feast. These Indians
were never heard of again. 'Undoubtedly
their -.canoe- met with mishap and the oc
cupants were drowned. After waiting
some days an expedition consisting of Jim
Hanson 1 , whose Indian name is Qualth,
Kichtoo. Mark Klanat; Dave Klanat,
Juch Klane, Jim' Williams, John Kesh,
Qua-ni-ish, Una-hootch, Goos,; Day-kan

Hanson, all relatives and -friends of the
missing Indians, after a -of the
tribe, outlitted a* war canoe and went in,
search of their lost relatives. The first
night they camped at Taku Glacier; the
second day out they landed on Sullivan
Island, oppo'slte the camp of the Hortons,
about thirty-five miles below Skaguay on
Lynn Canal, made a camp, cooked and ate
their dinner and then sent out certain of
their members to search' for traces of
their friends. They had agreed that if
anything was discovered a gun should be
fired, which would be the signal for a hur
' vied assembly at "the camp. : Some two
hours later two shots were heard and im
mediately afterward Kichtoo^ and Qua-ni
ish appeared at the "camp with a small
piece of the canoe in which their friends
had embarked. It was recognized by Una-
hootch, who claimed to have himself
painted . the canoe. This fragment was
found on the sands of the. mainland;
where it had drifted ashore,, as it after-,

white people were responsible for the Ios3

council and decided that the white man
and woman. must' die. Immediately they
embarked and paddled across the channel,

to Juneau or Skaguay, generally the lat

.Sometimes he drank, but so far as I could
learn never, had trouble; but once with
white men. 'This was in a saloon at Skag
uay. but had no serious outcome. % 7.
From the hour of. the brutal murder of
the Hortons, in which he was the leader
and chief instigator, Hanson knew, no
peace. ' He said that by day and by, night
the forms of those young people were
ever before his eyes. The dying screams
of Florence . Horton were never stilled;
he heard them, on the trail and on the
water; in his dreams he heard her moan
ing, s, At a religious meeting held in the
Indian village near Skaguay during' the
winter, at which a . missionary Indian,
preached, Hanson became greatly excit
ed. He made a dramatic speech 1 in his
native language and told his hearers, that
his soul had been blasted and blackened
with murder; that he had killed aVwhtte
man and was .the leader Of a party who"
had killed a woman. He implored the
Christian Indians to pray for him, that
he, too, might become a Christian and be
forgiven for his awful'ciime.
At this time there were two earnest and
sincere men ( at Skaguay, laboring in a
humble but effective manner to stem the
tide of dissipation, gambling and many
other sinful practices and callings insep
erable, it seems, from frontier and min
ing towns. They were Adjutant McGill of
the Salvation Army and Rev. Mr. Paulsell.
It was their daily practice to assemble
with a few followers in front of the chief
hundred miles from Sitka.* He could un-

stituted the party, for murder in the first
degree; . one for the ' murder of , Florence

husband. ,. ' . T Â¦]' . . -' . '
All but Hanson, employed counsel. He
was represented by Rev. Mr.' Paulsell; who
had once been "a- practicing- lawyer - of
ability., Indians were sentto every vil
lage in ~ : Southeastern : Alaska, to raise
money to ; pay lawyers to defend .the pris

"*cFor weeks Skaguay ; seemed almost like
an Indian* camp. All the friends and rela
tives, including wives,' mothers and "sis
ters of the accused, were there. The trial
of Hanson; was brief. The; Government
proved beyond ; question that he had killed
Burt Horton. None\df the Indians save
his. wife manifested the slightest interest
in his case; on. the contrary, they did all
in their power to place the entire respon
sibllity^dn him. When. it came to the de
fense Hanson took the stand, and looking
straight at the jury told the' whole story.
He said that he expected to die and was
ready; he wanted, to set an example- for
his people. . .
verdict, which meant death to Mil,"
was quickly returned. "When he was made
to understand its import he smiled.
As no human eye save that of the Indian
indicted witnessed that terrible tragedy I
was compelled to use those which Inves
tigation had shown to be the 'least culpa
ble as witnesses against the jothers, they
having volunteered to testify. For this
purpose I Jismjssed the indictment
against John Kesh, Kictitoo's son. Qua-

pathetic scene- was enacted. Their wivea
and other relatives were all-ther*. ThÂ«

and gave way to uncontrollable grief.
.The action of Hanson undoubtedly wu
the means of bringing to punishment thÂ«
perpetrators' of this brutal crime* In all
human probability it would never hava
been revealed" or known but for him.
There never was a moment that he enter
tained the slightest hope of immunity. la
my letter to the Attorney General recom
mending-a modification of his sentence,
among other things I said: "Without any
sort of question, Hanson at tho tlms ha
made this confession and guve thÂ« names
of those Implicated with him had no other
hope or expectation than that he would bÂ«
executed for his crime."
Again, Indians with their native stealth
iness and secretiveness are far mort
adept at covering the tracks of crimt,
especially murder, than the > whites. Un
less a crime is betrayed by their number,
as in this case, it can never be traced.
Therefore,' in addition to- bains influenced
by the disinterested conduct of Hanson
and his services to the Government In
bringing the crime to light I was movod
from a sense of public policy to recom
mend the interposition of executive clem
ency and that his sentence be commuted
from death to imprisonment for Ufa.
The Attorney General strongly recom
mended this course to the President, and
he has Justly and properly commuted hiÂ»
sentence to life imprisonment at McNeils
Island.
What the aftermath will be no man can
say. There has been much murmurins
among the Indians. They say that six for
two is not fair. They killed two whlta
people, the white people took six Indians
âhence there are four to their credit.

very; dramatic, whicn was greatly inten
sified during the disposition of Hanson's
case. . He was dressed in a bright blue
Salvation Army uniform, with a large
metal badge pinned on his breast which
announced to the world that the wearer
was "a soldier , of. the of Jesus
Christ.'.'. When told to stand up he sprang
to his; feet alert, perfect In physical out
lines, 1 with a look of joyful expectancy on
his face. ;
: Hon. Melville ; C. Brown, Judge of the
United States - District Court, who pre
sided at these trials, asked Hanson the
usual question, after commenting on the
trial and verdict: '."Have you any reason
to offer why the sentence which the law
prescribes shall not be pronounced against
you?" At' this moment, murderer and
desperado as I knew him to have been, I
felt an admiration for him. which it would
be hard to describe. His physical courage
had often been put to the test, and had
never failed or been ''questioned, ' but his
moral courage was sublime. I had never
seen anything 1 approaching It. Judge
.Brown showed by his voice and manner
that he was greatly affected. Hanson evi
dently noticed this and sought to soothe
his agitated feelings. He replied:
"Brother, you must do your duty. I want
to die for my. crime that my people may
live, that they may see what religion can
do, even for one so wicked as I. Let them
see how" a Christian can die, and maybe
they will kill no more white people. May
,be the young men of my tribe will take
warning. Maybe they will not drink so
much, but will ' become soldiers in. God's
Army as I have, jl am ready to die. You
can take' my body and do as you like with
it, that is nothing,- but my soul belongs to
God; you can't hurt that."
\ As this was being interpreted Into Eng
lish, the only persons in the packed court
room who appeared unmoved were the In
dians; every white was visibly " affected,
and as Judge Brown concluded the sen
tence with the .words: "And may the God
you worship be with and sustain you in
the hour of trial," he broke down ut
terly.
At the wharf, when the ship whieii was
the Sound, while a few, who -knew the
treacherous nature of the Indians, their
ancient law of reprisal and that there was
always :-â¢... unbalanced account on their
tribal ledgers against the whites gener
ally for the loss of some Indiah, advanced
tiie theory that the Hortons* had been
murdered.
Meantime the snow .had fallen and cov
ered the location where their camp had
been to a depth of from nine to eleven
feet.
. Jim Hanson was a Sitka Indian. His
trite had dwelt there for over 500 years.
Their vil'age now stretches along the
teach near Sitka, the old capital of the
Territory, both under Russian and Ameri
can control. He remained there until he
was about 10 years of ag^. when he went
to some relatives among, the Chilkats,
who were also formerly from Sitka and
were known as Kahk-won-tons. There are
rcstes among thn Alaska Indians, and the
social l'nes are drawn even more relent
lessly than among their paleface breth-,
ren.. Hanson's family was- high on the so
cial ladder; hfs ancestors had been chiefs
for many generations; one of his tribe,
past ?0 :. ears of af e. has a grjat ha> mide
of finely woven bark, which wa3 their
battle, "tctcm" or flag, and to which they
all refer with great pride. They say that
the dark stains which are now visible
upon it were caused by the blood of Rus
sians, in which it was Foakcd at the time
of >the great massacre of the' Russian gar
rison, together with many women and
children, at Sitka, about the beginning of
the last century.
' So it was that Hanson's family prestige,
coupled v.ith his handsome and splendid
physique, his wonderful courage and his
gxeat success as a bear tighter, made him
naturally a leader of these primitive peo
ple. Old rr,en looked up to him, heeded his
advice and, as well as the young: men,
obeyed his commands without question-
Ing. From Haines' Mission, which Is at
the mouth of Chilkat River, it is only
about 150 miles around the -coast to.Sitka.
For an Indian to row this distance in his
canoe is considered among th?m child's
play. And thus it had come about that
quite a community of his Kahk-won-ton
relatives and friends were residing on the
Chilkat in' O.ctobcr. 189D. They hunted
and. fished in and along the. Chilkat Riv
er and through the great mountain
ranges, Hanson always leading.
I have seen it stated that he hunted
walrus and seal in a "baidarka" â a skin
canoeâ "from, the Aleutian chain and the
Kadiak Archipelago to the far desola
tion of Point Barrow." He probably
never saw an Aleut in his life. Notwith
standing it is asserted in the story-pre
ferred to that he was a member of that
tribe it is extremely doubtful if he ever
euw a "baidarka." The "nearest Aleut
villageâ half-breed Russla'nsâ Is more than
five, hundred miles to the north 'and west
ward of the place of his birth; Point Bar
row is more than thrae thousand miles
distant. It would be easier . to travel
around the world by modern means than
to reach the latter, especially during the
winter season.' Hanson was. never in .his

The scene from beginning to end was
gambling and liquor saloons in Skaguay,
jing gospel hymns and exhort thÂ« crowds
gathered about the entrance to pause in
their downward course. Hanson, who was
suffering from the torments of his guilty,
conscience, happened to pass while one of
these meetings was in progress; he
stopped, and as. soon as he could compre
hend its meaning became greatly im
pressed, not only with the service and r?s
object, but with the men who were con
ducting .it. After three or .four" days he
sought out Adjutant McGill and through
an interpreter told him th< horrible story
in its entirety." This "was about,' the 10th
of March, 1900. After consulting with Mr.
Paulsell the Salvation Army .leader ad
vised Hanson to go to the civil author
ities, tell them the' story, and .surrender
himself in custody.;/
Thishe did, with no other, thought than
that he was going to his death. To Dep
uty Marshal Tanner and Commissioner
Sehlbrede. -he told everything, giving the
names of his accomplices, and offered to
conduct the officers to the place of the
murder and locate the spot where the
bodies had been buried.,
Accordingly Mr. Tanner chartered a lit
tle steamer. The Alert, and accompanied
by- a posse consisting of a sergeant and
squad of United States soldiers and citi
zens of Slraguay, with Hanson a" a guide,
proceeded to the ill-fated camn. . and
though upon their arrival they found all
the low lying coast covored with snow to
a depth of some ten feet, "Hanson in a few

The bodies were taken to Skagua.v,

ning the late Sanger'g Theater, West
minster Bridge road. Sanger at first
"turned her down;" then, as she . was
leaving the stage door, he thought an
other think and called her back.
"Can you play a part?" he asked her.
"Of course, I can," she replied. She
had been touring in "Peter Wilkins" and
afterward in a long repertoire of pieces
that ranged all the way from Â«"East
Lynne" to "Uncle Tom's Cabin." and as
ehe had been a Jack-of-all-trades in the
company she Celt justified in saying that
ehe could play a part.
"Will you play 'Richard III' for me?"
went on Mr. George.
"Just as soon play that as anything
else." Miss Dagmar replied.
"And 1 am to bill you as I please," he
stipulated.
"As you please goes." she acquiesced.
But when the bills made their appear
ance she looked at them aghast. There in
glaring type she read of herself:
"First appearance in England of thÂ«
great American actress. Miss Grant
Washington."
It was the first time she had ever heard
of herself as an American or as Miss
Grant Washington. The. manager knew
â¢wherein money lay.
Later on she came to America and here
found herself announced as:
"The great Russian beauty, the favorite
actress of the Czar."
And the truth of the whole matter., is
that she was born in Denmark and that
Alexandra Dagmar is her real name, and
that she has no desire to be accredited
with any other name or any other race.
She has been on the boards ever since
ehe was a mite of a girl. This part of her
career didn't last long; she got over be
ing a mite so fast that before -she realized
it she was being press-agented as "stun
ning" and "strapping" and. "splendid"
and "queenly." There is so much of her
that she gets a salary in proportion.
In her first teens she was so tall that
she could play a woman's part. She start
ed out on a tour under the management
of Miss Sarah Thome, and "Peter Wil
klns" was the pantomime presented. Ja
net Achurch was the fairy queen, and
Dagmar had to walk on and off the stage
in a very small part until the second girl's
part was vacant unexpectedly. Dagmar
was given her chance then, and she
grabbed it.
Her tuccess as second girl led to her
tour with a road company which was
playing all sorts and conditions of pieces,
and later on &he won her pantomime
successes. Then she took to the concert
stage, and finally to the vaudeville.
Here we know her as a vaudeville queen.
London welcomes her every season in its
pantomimes, and has now come to know
her in what it calls the "variety theater.""
But London, loyal to its favorites, will
never forget her as the prince in "Cin
derella," in which part she made her first
hit. As a ladylike boy with a "swashing
and a martial outside" she is said over
there to have no equal, and she has been
called upon to play the boy in pantomime
after pantomime. Since we saw her here
two j'ears ago she has been appearing in
Ix>ndon in "The Forty Thieves" and
"Robinson Crusoe." And London consid
ers her so much a British possession that
*t would probably tell you to-day that she
Is a born Britisher, and so add another to

S the opening of the college yeai
#^ draws near speculation concerning
I /J the relative strength of the twe
1^\ rival varsity football teams In-
I M creases. From the rumors of tin
' M coming of new material to both
colleges it looks as if the two in
stitutions will draw about equally from
the Eastern talent. California claims tha!
three Eastern men with well-earned rep
utations will be seen with the blue and
gold aggregation this fall. Horan, a bi
guard from Lafayette College, is. already
on the Berkeley campus, while two-other*
are expected from Denver. One of the
Coloradans is a quarterback of ability
and will be an invaluable addition to
Coach Slmpson'tmen. Of last year's team
those: expected- to return- are Womb)"
Hudson and . Masters, ends; OvenM
guard: Albertson. tackle; More and prob-'
ably Gommon, backs.
While the .wearers of the blue and gold
have not yet given up all hope of the re
instatement of Captain "Locomotive-
Smith, it is hardly likely that he would
be allowed to don football armor, even
though he should succeed in registering
as a student in the Affiliated Colleges of
Dentistry. The loss of so valuable a line
plunger will seriously weaken Berkeley'*
back field, Just where she would have been
strongest this season. . The two tackle
places and center will worry the coaches
as Cornish and Pringle are men that
can't be replaced in a year. However,
California has a long list of available ma
terial to pick from and with such old vet
.erans as Frank Simpson. â¢â¢Jimmie" Hop
per. Percy Hail and Pets Kaarsber? as
coaches should turn out. a more effective
team than last year's.
Down at Palo Alto things never looked
brighter for a winning team. In the first
Place Charlie Fickert, Stanford's popular
old guard." has been made head coach
so everybody is satisfied. "Billy" Trae
ger. who won last years game by his well
executed place kick, undoubtedly the best
tackle on^ the Western gridiron to-day
and who scheduled to play with Harvard
this fall, will again wear his cardinal jer-
Fey. Moreover, forever}' position made
vacant by a year's losses, there is an ex
perienced substitute, for Coach Yost's
second team was almost as good as his
TÂ£Â£, n ? r e * "f, 011^ crew.-wlll consist of
Fickert, Spaulding '96 and McMillan, ex-
SÂ«. one time a . guard. Of these two
SPf^'dins has seen the game as
Played In the East while a student at
Columbia Medical School. McMillan. has
been playing football in the Northwest
ever since leaving the local gridiron, first
as captain of the celebrated Butte eleven
then with the Multnomah Athletic Club
of Portland. Both men have followed
the game closely since leaving Stanford.
Barnhisel and Thompson will undoubt
edly fill the places left vacant by Seeley
and De Forest, and Hamilton 'of last
year's Reliance team should take Bur
nett's position .at right tackle, Lee and
McFadden. both of whom had experience
last Thanksgiving, will be back trying for
the snap back's honors.
For the twick field there will be a dozen
likely candidates, among whom are Fish
er, Hill, Smith, Keddie, Narramore. the
Yarpey brothers. Parker. Raitt and
Bansbach and probably Slaker, last
year's fullback, who may return. The
weakest place on the cardinal team will
be the end places, the only experienced
player who will return being Cooper of
last year's eleven.
Naturally the personnel of the' two
"baby teams Is Impossible to forecast.
California will undoubtedly get her sharo
of the "infants" who made up the crack
academic teams. Boone's Academy, Per
alta Hall, Mount Tamalpais. Belmont and
St. Matthew's all make their contribu
tions. Of those who will enter Stanford
quite a little is known. First there are
the Tarpeys from the Palo Alto High
School, two. of the sturdiest players in
the league last year. Voltz, the bucking
fullback from. the Berkeley High School,
will also be seen behind the cardinal line
of jerseys. Among the linemen will be
Sefton from r Belmont and Hamilton from
Lick at , tackles. IX is also rumored that
the Lyceum will send down: a 200-pound
candidate for center rush honors. But
there are always plenty of good men who
enter with records to make, so there is
no doubt that there will' be plenty of
material to fill. the other places.

THAT the greyhound has a canine dis
position or nature peculiar to him
self is evinced whenever a stake is
run. for with no other class of dogs
could a meeting be held where the
absence of snarling, snapping and
lighting among such highly trained
animals is so noticeable. After a dog has
br come a "performer" and has lost hi3
puppy timidity, preparing for k stake be
comes second nature to him. =' Â¦* "
From the time an old campaigner Is
taken from his kennel until the day's
pport is 'ended " he shows by his every
move that h*Â» knows what Is expected of
him. He stands the ordeal of being
rubbed down without flinching, and then
when his time corner for a course > he
passes through tho "office" and on the
field, leading the way to the ' slipper's
stall. Oblivious to conditions and sur
roundings, he awaits patiently his trans
fer into the slipper's hands. Holding up
his head that *he slip may be put on. anil
backing into his position alongside his op
ponent, the wisa courser rests ouietly on
the slippenfs arm until the- order to re
lease the hare is given. When the sound
of the dropping lid tells him that the jack
is loose and he hears the boys shoo "the
game out -into the field, it is then that
the* hound presents the study. With ears
pricked pp waits for a sight of the freed
hare, and once his eye rests en the fleeing
jack It is but a succession" of pleading,
coaxih? whines until the slipper releases
him and his mate a distance Up the field.
As ..a rule the more experienced the
courser the quieter he rests in the hands
of tho slipper, and while some never get.
over their howling there are many houn<Js
that await the slipper's pleasure without
a sound.
. Greyhounds will ch?sÂ« any living thinpr
that will run from them. A bunch of
them out exercising will ignore a cat that
shows_ no fear, but it is good-by to thÂ«Â».
feline if she starts to run. A' strange dojr
will be passed unnoticed unless he tries
to get away. In that event the hound*
start him^ going and his finish is painful.

The. heaviest hound that was ever slip
ped in public was Master Mocking Bird,
an. English dog that performed some fiftv
years, ago. At 89' pounds- he won a sap-'
ling stake and afterward divided an eight
dog event for all ages at the Baldock
meeting. His dam was the celebrated
Mocking Bird and scaled 61 pounds.
Midvllle Prince, who ran'ln England 'n
JSDo.'won two courses in a puppy stake at
Sleaford meeting, weighing 71) pounds.
Drayman performed well at 7S pounds.'
Tullochgorum. who was two pounds light-:
er. made a record at that weight. In hi*
first two seasons he beat almost every
thing he met for one course, and he was
given the flag over Mineral Water In i.
trial before she won the Waterloo cup.
He was sold for a song and brought hh
new owner luck, winning several stake3
and running Into his sixth season.
f-elby made the best record for a heavy
weight. He was last and clever and di
vided the Waterloo in 1SC0. when it was a
C4-dog stake, with dive. Selby weighed,
teventy-five pounds.
Jennie Jones was the heaviest oitch of
record and scaled 63V2 pounds. She ran
Into the semi-final of the Waterloo in 1SK7
after having- met with an accident just
before the stake.
Lancelot was the smallest dog as a win
ner that ever ran in public, weighing an
even 42 pounds. He was a wonder for his
size and scored two or three wins as a
puppy, setting the flag in nine courses be
fore meeting defeat. He went fast to hla
hare and beat defgs- that were half as
heavy again. .-
Phantom II was the nearest approach ra
lightness to Lancelot and did some good
work at 45 pounds
Swift, an English Bitch, was by odds

FULL of the noise of polo and golf,
society will pass this week at Del
Monte in a struggle for purses,
prizes and rewards. The Pacific
Coast Polo and Pony Racing Asso
ciation has perfected all plans for
Its sixth meeting, and all that is
now necessary Is the word for the carni
val to begin its operations on the field of
yport. Golf, polo and pony racing will be
The three kinds of sport that will engross
' mind and body of the men and women
Â¦who are on the list of contestants.
"* This meeting- will be specially note
â¢ worthy on account of the pony racing
feature. Originally the polo pony was of
mustang stock, with some breeding, but
in these days he is really an undersized
thoroughbred, or at least a pony with a
lnr^e percentage of the thoroughbred in
his blood. Such men as Carolan and Ho
bart have given much attention to the
breeding of ponies and a great rivalry
between these two Blingumites always
exists. They will play and race the best
of their stables.
Thirty ponies have been shipped from
the south, to be used by the five or six
Fouthern players, who will take part in
the racing and games. R. L. Bettner of
Riverside arrived at Del Monte on
TVednesday. Mr. Praed has shipped -Red"
Jacket and C. EL Maud Redemption.-
Among the notable new ponies to be seen
will bÂ«Â» Hobart's Silver Dick, which he
recently brought from Colorado. Charles
Dunnhy will race his new pony Topo. The
Tobins, Tom Driscoll and J. J. Moore will
be on the scene with several strings
r*Â»ady to fight for the wire.
The opening day of the golf tourna
ments will be attended by a large num
ber of golfers from San Francisco, San
Kafael. Oakland. Burlingame and South
ern California. The qualifying round over
pightoen holes, medal play, for the men's
amateur competition for the Del Monte
Cup will be played to-morrow morning,
and the opening match play round Â¦will
take pla<*e in the afternoon among the
sixteen men who make the best qualify

with a qualifying round over eighteen
holes, modal play, the ei^ht lowest scores
to qualify-. The match play rounds will

being drawn by lot, and in case of an odd
number of players the executive com

the contestant drawing the bye. In case
of a tie or ties for eighth place in the
qualifying round the contestants will play

SPORTS UNDER COVER
AND IN THE
FIELDRAILROADING in Maine has not
been without its Incidents lately.
A short time ago the trains on the
Canadian Pacific Railroad were
very late, and the story went out that
a terrible accident had happened near
Megantic, near the* western border of
Maine. As the line of the Canadian Paci
fic runs for miles through the wilderness
of Xorthern Maine, the report could not
be verified at first. A press telegram was
sent out, stating that the Colonist Limited
bad gone through the bridge, and that
large numbers had been killed, but at last
the overdue train arrived at Jackman
station, and , the story was told. Before
any person on the train would say a word,
he first made a rush to the general store
near the Jackman station and bought a
bottle of some emollient. As the passen
gers rubbed the soothing compound on the
bulging blotches of mosquito bites and on
the red rash that marked the punishment
dealt by black flies and' midges they re
lated their experiences.
It seems that when the train, composed
of heavily loaded colonist cars, struck the
foot of a steep grade, the engineer noticed
that the drivers began to slip and grind
in a somewhat unaccountable fashion.
The engineer leaned out of the cab and
eaw that numerous green worms were
crawling on the sleepers and the rails. He
yanied the sand lever and set the throttle
AN ARMY OF WORMS THAT HELD UP A TRAIN IN MAINE
\y survey; The situation was worse than
that;of a trolley : car behind a . watering
cart in a narrow street. Â¦
One of the. passengers on the train, a
Western /farmer, going back to his old
home In Germany for. a summer visit, said .
that â¢ he> believed the only way was to
make brooms out of birch withes and
sweep .the tracks. ' He declared -that he
was willing to assist, and on this many of
the passengers volunteered. Getting the
train out of Its predicament was" a matter
in which all were interested. "So. the train
crew. and the others set to .work, cutting
withes down in the ravine, and several in
the -party tied the withes into brooms for
the -use of the v others. In ten minutes 1
fifty, men' were out on the trestle sweeps"
ing away for dear. life. The air below the
framework . was Â¦ filled with: flying worms.
They, pattered 'like green rain on the
leaves of the trees below. ; . '
To be -sure, there was a quarter 'of a
mile of >' trestle to clean, but, It seemed like
a fairly easy proposition. Here, however,
ensued a complication. . The complication
first 'tackled -the men who went' into the,
bushes after the withes. : Up' from their
retreats came the Â¦ black files, the midges
and Â¦ the ;; mosquitoes. They chased the
choppers out of the. woods and -then fell
upon the men who were sweeping the
track. .-.-'.. . .
A person who has not been in the Maine
woods cannot understand the tortures
that these little terrors inflict. They, are
at, their worst in July. Persons , who do
not understand those things : may think
It sounds puerile and cowardly for a man
to admit that black flies :.. have "driven
him." But even hardened woodsmen and
guides will not venture into the woods in
June and' July until they have smeared
their leather hides with grease and tar
and other compounds.
The passengers and the train crew were
who.lly unused to the pests of the -Maine
forest. ; Many of them were from cities,
and if black flies ever laugh these terrors
of- the Moxie must have chortlecl when
Â¦ they espied the fair white skins of these
Â¦="- strangers who had "suddenly dropped
among them like manna from heaven.
By the -wireless telegraphy in use in in
sect land the news was sent -abroad, and
clouds^ of pests came .winging in over
valley and hill. Mosquitoes arrived and
went away/in content. Black files
splotched the faces of the tollers. ThesÂ©
.flies, do not fear any .movement of man.
'and settle, on the face, and hands in
patches. 'Their bite is acute agony. They
must 'use saws where mosquitoes use.
â¢'. drills, to judge from the sensation. â¢ *
'Each worm sweeper was followed .by
clouds of these flies, streaming out be
hind in the air like bannerets. The
.midges, such tiny specks as to be hardly
- visible, ' came too, and : burrowed m the
skin in all the claima that had not been !
staked out by their bigger brothers. ThÂ»'
sting of a midge is not a -whit less agon
izing than the bite of the black fly.
As the workers perspired the p'laguÂ©
grew worse. At last fully half thÂ« men
threw down their, brooms and ran for thÂ»
shelter of the cars, fairly screaming with
the torture the insects were inflicting
upon them. Only a sportsman who has
been in the Maine woods during the sum
mer can understand how infernal the'in
secfc persecution is. Other passengers
worked on, wielding the broom with onÂ«
hand and swatting flies with the other
It was necessary to keep one or both
hands whirling constantly around the
head in order to escape being eaten
alive. But fighting the pests was about
like kicking out against a breeze. The
natural relief, from such ineffectual
warfare is to swear. So the passengers
swore and swatted and swept, and swept
and swatted and swore, their perspiring'
faces puffing redly with the poison thai
the insects were pumping Into them. At
last even .the bravest gave up the Job
and they retired to the cars and left the
worms and the insects masters of the
trestle. - The lilliputians were the con
querors of the day. When night came .
on and the. insects went away the fight
on the worms was resumed, and at last
the train got over the. grade and away.
But when the passengers got off at
Jackman their faces were so swollen that
they. could barely open their eyes suffi
ciently to see the way to the store whera*

It ) was: then suggested that; the train
wait patiently until "the worm army s had
crossed over, but after; watching the pro
gress* of a sample worm ; for, a few mo
ments the 'conductor decided" that this
would not _do. The 'worm did; not hike
right "along, nor did'.any of his fellows.
Each hitched and;, undulated for ; an inch
or so and ; then used ; up '.valuable' time in

jabbed . his stubby shout first to ' right'and
then to left and, took, a long and,contem
plative "survey. -Then . he hitched along a
few more inches and repeated the leisure-'
There was a second council of war. The
engineer suggested that' he take the coil
of hose in the cab, hitch It to one of the
cocks and sweep the rails with water.
This recourse was tried. But as soon as
the water began to run each. worm halted
and 'clung with all its legs, to rail Gr

in such fashion -that the -water sluiced
over him 1 ineffectually. As : soon: as : : the

into' the mess left^bythe first victims.
Even the sand Â¦ could Â¦ not:, cut the
coating so that the drivers could rub the
rails. The locomotive came to a halt witn
its pilot just poked: over the first sleepers
of the trestle. " : ',
Then with the throttle wide open, using
every pound of steam. and with sand valve
pulled tothe limit, he slammed to the foot
of the grade. _ But -half way "up he saw.
that. his charge was going to be without
avail. His first onslaught on the! hosts
had; left the, rails smeared and slimy.
Since . then*new , batches 'of . '.worms'; had
crawled recklessly over the bodies. of tiie
The engineer thought that he could run
back a mi/e or so and get enough momen
tum to run'over'and through the mesi.
He told the conductor that he hadn't been
looking for any Coxey's army on the raite,
and therefore had not taken, the grade at
very determined speed. So ' the train" was
backed two miles. T,hen the engineer took
the engine bpoom, and, with the assist
ance of the fireman, cleaned off as much
of. the worm lubricant as he could.
A few passengers, seeing these queer an
tics,"-started to come forward, but there
were too many worms in sight.
He found the engineer out by the side
of the engine! gazing with intense disgust
at the forbidding mess that was smeared
over his running gear, and even dripped
in thick, yellow streams from the rims of
the wheels. The conductor" and engineer
stood there a moment passing, florid com
ments on the situation and as; they talked
they kicked out first one leg. and then
the other in order- to shake off the deter
mined crawlers .who insisted on a tour of
investigation.
The conductor came 'forward along the
side of the train, scuffling through s the
sand of, the roadbed and stepping gingerly
through :â¢â¢ the - patches : of 'crawling
, Â¦ .. ' â¢ r
At the top of the grade and continuing
for a quarter 'of. a mile is a trestle over
Moxie Brook. As the engine puffed and
snorted toward the end of this trestle,
slipping, grinding, jerking ahead and then
almost slowing to a standstill, the engi
neer noticed that the green worms were
growing more numerous. Behind they had
been in patches and thin processions, like
the stragglers behind an army, but at the
end of the trestle and along the viaduct
as far as theeye could distinguish them
they were packing rails and sleepers like
a carpet of moving, undulating green._ It
was evident that the worm army wanted
to go somewhere and was using the trestle
of the_ great Canadian Pacific over which
to make an exodus. For every : one
squashed by the engine wheels two more
took his , place* on the rails, and ; before
the trestle was reached the wheels of the
locomotive gave a last/despairing buzz on
the slippery- rails .and then the train
jerked to a standstill. , The weight of the
cars even pulled the locomotive back a
bit ere the brakes would take hold. r 2^' : "
up a notch or so. The great wheels came
flogging down on the rails and the engine

And if Chiquita is the oldest in point of
years, undoubtedly the youngest, not even

This is a Filipino baby, born on the Expo
sition grounds, and on the occasion of his
first portrait taking, wrapped in the folds
of Old Glory, on the Fourth of July, was
just five days old, and the first full-blood
ed Filipino child to see the light of day
on 'American .soil. This young citizen,
named in /honor of the director general,
W. J. Buchanan, has been the. recipient/
of much attention on the part of curious
visitors at the Filipino village, and thrives
well in his thatched bamboo cabin on the
Midway. . . *

there are a number, run about In pictur-

archipelagoesâ a cock fight. Several
events have ' been attempted in obscure
nooks of, the Filipino village, but the
watchful eye of the manager in chief pre
vents any poultry bloodshed not strictly
according to New Tork laws. Many of
the Filipino children there are scions of
Kbble stock, as family trees go in our new
possession, and- are distinctly.' proud ot
their native ancestry, claiming to have
s-prung from neither Chinese nor African
forbears. The native Filipino is a very
.v^in personage, and resents the imputa

In many ! cases,- -according .to the
opinion* of the most competent
clinicians, it la best not to persist In ob
taining- a radical cure. -Headache being
the manifestation 'of a diathesis, it is bet
ter to have it than many other\forms;
whence the therapeutic consequence that,
although sick headache should be treated,
all disturbing action should be avoided. '.=
These short preliminaries render It com
prehensive that the , treatment of sick
headache, comprises three indications: (1)
the prophylaxis, (2) the treatment of 'the
painful attacks, \ (3) the treatment of the
constitutional condition upon which " the
malady. depends. -
Every one subject to sick headache
knows one "or more causes special to him
or to her that bring on the- attacks. Ot
these causes some are so commonplace
that it is Impossible to avoid them, and
others. Von ', the contraryâ among them
fatigue and imprudence in dietâ may be
avoided. In many cases headache is due
to troubles relating to accommodation or
refraction; in these cases a remedy must
be sought in the use of appropriate epec
tacles; s ' ; Â¦.'-""â¢â¢>",
At the moment when Â¦ the 1 , symptoms of
a habitual headache manifest themselves
the swallowing . of certain exciting ], sub
stances, such as . black ' coffee or' an . in

headache from coming on.

therapeutics, though doctors -of the old
school made a terrible use of it, and it is
still held . in honor by .the veterinary j pro
fession; j v I prefer to . the Â¦ seton of : former
days. -This ; Manchester surgeon [ asserts

ENGLISH SURGEON'S NEW METHOD OF CURING HEADACHE.
T.HE following official dispatches,
which passed between the Navy
Department and Rear Admirals AV.
T. Sampson and W. S. Schley during
the anxious days of . the latter part of
May, 189S, will throw considerable light
on the much discussed Samp^on-Schley
controversy, bearing as they do directly
upon the chat ges imputed against Schley
of misbehavior prior to the. arrival of
Sampson off Santiago on June I.
These dispatches were copied from the '
official records and are Â¦ printed here
without criticism,' and with merely ex- .
planatory comment The reader is left
to form what conclusions he may from
them.
In the first place, let the situation in
the middle of May be recalled. At that
time nothing was known of the where
abouts of. Admiral .Cervera's Spanish
fleet, except that it had sailed from the
Canary Islands and was due in the West
Indies. On May 12, Sampson with a
division of the North Atlantic squadron
sought Cervera at San Juan. Porto Rico,

the Spanish squadron there started back
for his station off Havana. Schley, with
the flying squadron, was then at Hamp
ton Roads. On May 13-a press boat re
. ported to Sampson that Cervera had re
turned to Cadiz, but on the 15th it was ;
authoritatively - announced that the
Spaniards were at Curacao. Schley was *
then immediately ordered to Key. West.
Sampson on the 16th cabled to Captain
Cotton c f the Harvard, one of the swift
scouts, giving him this information, add
ing: .. â¢ -
"Destination unknownr Probably
Santiago de Cuba or San Juan, Porto
Rico." : '-;â¢*: Â¦)Â¦ .'Â«
* Both sides of Cuba having to be
guarded, Sampson took Havana and the
north side^ sending Schley to the south,
with theifpllowing orders:
"Sir: I send you a copy of a telegram
received last night from the Secretary,
concerning a vessel which was to sail on .
the 15th, and carrying ajarge amount of
specie, and is supposed to be going to
land it at Trinidad, or - to the east' of
Cienfuegos. This may be a blind,, how
ever, and the vessel may be bound for
Cienfuegos, or even Havana.
- "Two cruisers will be sent out to-day,
with the torpedo-boats following them.
' As soon as the Iowa is coaled she will ;
follow them.'n*^
"It is unnecessary focine to say that
you should establish a blockade at-Cien
fuegos with the least possible delay, and
that it should be maintained as close as
possible.
â¢"Should the Spanish vessels show
themselves in that vicinity, and finding
you on the lookout attempt to come
around the island, whether east or west,
please send me notice by the best vessel
you have for that purpose, as to their di
rection'that I may be prepared for them
at Havana. /
"I will try and increase the number of
light vessels at your disposal, in order
that you may have them to send with
messages to me in case you desire to
do so.
"After I have the situation more in
hand I will write you and give you >any
information that suggests* itself.
"Very respectfully,
"W. T-CAMPSON,;^/-;
"Rear Admiral."
Schley sailed,from Key West, in obe
dience to these orders, on. May 19, his
squadron fully coaled, and taking 4500
tons of coal along in the collier Merri
mac. The- same day Cervera entered
Santiago, and the news was wired to
# Washington.
On the 20th the Navy Department
sent this telegram to Admiral Sampson:
"""V report of the Spanish fleet being
at Santiago de Cuba might very well be
correct, so the department strongly ad
vises that you send immediately by the
Iowa to Schley orders to proceed off
Santiago de Cuba with his whole com-* 1
mand, leaving one small vessel off Cien
fuegos. If Iowa has gone, send order to
Schley by fastest dispatch vessel."
Sampson answered this thus:
"Replying to department's telegram
of the 20th, after duly considering the
information therein contained. I have
decided to follow the plan already adopt
ed to hold position with
Brooklyn, Massachusetts, Texas and the
Iowa, Marblehead, Castine, Dupont and
two auxiliaries. There remain the New
York, Indiana and monitors for Havana.

"The Iowa is coaling to-day, having
reached this station with only about half
of her coal supply."
Accompanying the above was an
other of the same date, saying: -

On May 22 Schley wrote the following

.which tie did in Nicholas Channel on the "
27th, he decided to. hurry to Key West .
withthe. New York, coal, and. if author-'
ized by the department, proceed himself
at once to Santiago, but first sending
the New Orleans off to Schley with
these orders to her commanding officer,'
Captain Folger: .
"Sir: You will proceed to Santiago
de Cuba to convoy the collier Stirling. I
You will communicate with Commodore
Schley and direct him to remain on the
blockade of Santiago at all hazards, as
suming that the Spanish vessels are, in
that port.
': "TelL him that I desire that he use
the collier Stirling (the Merrimac was
substituted later) to obstruct the chan

this harbor. Inform him that I believe
it . would be perfectly practicable to

: all her anchors, allow her to â¢ ; swing
across the channel, then sink her, either
by opening the valves or whatever
means may be. best in his judgment.
"Inform Commodore Schley that the

as collier is ready." Speed nine knots."
However, the collier (the Merrimac)
broke down again, and the departure
for Key West was postponed. , .. .
â Sampson arrived at Key West on May
28, where he received orders from
Washington to be ready to convoy the
army transports from Tampa to Cuba, :
: "with the New York, Oregon
and as many smaller vessels with good 1
.batteries as possible, going in person;"
and alqng the r.orthside of Cuba, v
Sampson wired to Schley the same
day thus: . ._
"The New Orleans will meet you off
Santiago with important dispatches.
The Spanish squadron must be block
aded at all hazards. Immediate commu
nications with persons on shore must be
entered upon. You must be sure of the
Spanish squadron-being in port. I sug-
gest communicating Â£ with . Spanish-
American "Company's pier at Baiquiri

Santiago de Cuba. One collier' for you
left yesterday. - Shall send, as soon as
possible, another. If Spanish squadron'
has left Santiago immediate pursuit
must be made." ' K . ' 'Â¦'.
At midnight (May 28) the following
telegram ;from Secretary Long was re
ceived by Sampson:
Sampson arrived â¢ off Santiago on
June 1 and the rigid blockade of the en
suing month was inaugurated. Hobson
took the Merrimac in four days later
and sank her. Guantanamo was seized
a week later and used as a base, the ves
sels coaling there singly, although often
doing so in the open sea off Santiago.
"Enemy in port. Recognized Cristobal
Colon and Infanta Maria Teresa and
two torpedo boats moored inside Mor-
f ro, behind point. Doubtless the others
are there. We are short cf coal. Using
every effort to get coal in. Have about
3000 tons of coal in collier, but not easy
to get on board here. If no engage
ment ne*t two or three days_ Sampson's
squadron could relieve ; this one to coal
at Gonaives or vicinity of Port au
Prince. Brooklyn, Iowa. Massachu
setts, Texas, Marblehead and Vixen and
collier compose squadron here."
Sampson left, at once for Santiago in
the New York, accompanied by the
Oregon, Mayflower and Porter.
Under date ofHthe 29th Schley cabled
to the Navy Department:
"You carry out recommendations to
go yourself with two ships to Santiago
de Cuba. Act at your discretion, with
the object of blockading Spanish divi
sion as soon as possible. Goodrich re
ports Guantanamo . very weak. The
seizure of it immediately is recom
mended."'
Just after this was sent Sampson re
ceived, in answer to his telegrams of
that morning, the following dispatch
from Secretary. Long:
"Congratulate you on success. Main
tain "close blockade at all hazards, es
pecially at night. Very little to fear
from torpedo-boat destroyers. Coal in
open sea whenever conditions permit.

with view to occupying it as a base,

"'Collier now has been repaired tem

(The omitted parts of the above are
unintelligible in the original cipher.) -
\ Immediately upon receipt of this
Sampson cabled to Schley:
Still later on the 29th received the
following. dispatch from Schley. dated
off Santiago: " ..
"Referring to my telegram of ,tb!s
date, I urge immediate reply to my last
paragraph. Failure of Schley to con-,
tiiiue blockade must be remedied at
once, if possible. There can be no
doubt of presence of Spanish squadron
at Santiago."
"Answering telegram, first question,
three days. I can blockade indefinitely.
Think that can occupy Goantanamo.
Would like to start at once with New
York "and Oregon, arriving in two days.
Do not quite understand the necessity
'of awaiting arrival of Schley. txit wonld

principal part of the force tinder his

hyn- by telegraph. Watson will be in
charge of everything afloat : (about Ha

posed action?" .. - .
Later (29th), receiving no answer to
the above, Sampson wired to Long:--..
Sampson answered this as follows:
"There is one collier en route to Molt.
Hayti,: from Norfolk, and another; one
has been ordered there from Key, West,
and others will ' be sent immediately.
Con?ider'if you could seize Guantanamo

.The 'well-known ': political 'abilities of
Samuel . Morse Felton are looked upon in
the railroad .world as' the reason for.: his
selection,' and! because as the president of
the Southern' Pacific he can keep the "old
timers" - hard at work, "doing politics."
It is a" foregone conclusion that when
President : Hays vacates his position in
favor, of Samuel Morse Felton â¢ he will be
accompanied by General Manager Krutt
schnitt and that Nephew Huntington
will dangle Kruttschnitt's scalp at t his
belt and .boast -that he has ousted his

Claims.
When Hays assumed office as president
the Southern Pacific! road on' the first ;
"When Collis P. Huntington died on Au
gust 14, 1900, the Speyer syndicate of the
Southern Pacific road looked around for
a suitable president. After . canvassing
the merits of the likely "timber" Charles
Melville 'Hays was selected. Born in 1856,
he had grown up In the railroad service
of various roads, and his success as gen
eral manager of .the Grand Trunk ' Rail
road system induced the Southern Pacific
syndicate to select him as tHe man who
should wield the baton so long held by
Collis P. Huntington.
Overlooked Young Huntington's
With the accession of Samuel Morse
Felton as president of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, the corporation will resume
business in the political field of Califor
nia and hang- its legal shingle out at "the
same old stand," as it was wont to do
when the late Collis P. Huntington con
trolled its affairs.
The men who have "been forced out of
the Southern Pacific Railroad in the last
few months under the regime of Hays are
likely to assume their old positions once
again, and those who were in sympathy
with Hays will be asked by the new presi
dent, Felton, to "take your clothes and
Chiof among those who will be given
their "walking papers" will bo the pres
ent general manager of the Southern Pa
ciflc, Julius Kruttschnitt, who was the
main Instigator of causing Hays to hand
around the "blue envelopes."
The outgoing \tt Hays and the Incoming
of Felton in the chair of president of the
Southern Pacific road form "one -of the
most important features of the battles
that have been waged In the affairs of
the corporation.
Will Stay in Politics.
When Hays was selected to fill the po
sition of president of the road in succes
sion to the late Collis P. Huntington ' he
announced on assuming office that the
railroad was and would stay "out of poli
tics," and a thrill of joy -went through
the community of the entire State.
After an experiment of some months
Hays has found that the Interests op
posed to his policy of keeping the railroad
out of the political arena are too much
for him. The pressure brought to bear
against Hays has been so strong that he
will give up a five-year contract with. the
Southern Pacific, carrying with it an an
nual salary of $65,000. \
The 8 selection of Felton as president o*
the Southern Pacific road and the retire
ment of 'Hays, when divested of all the
intricacies of railroad diplomacy, \ mean
that, the Southern Pacific Railroad will
stay In politics in the State of California.
his successor will be Samuel
Morse Felton, the president of the Chi
cago and Alton Railroad Company, now
located in Chicago.
THE resignation of Charles M.
Hays as president of the South
ern Pacific Railroad is an as
sured fact and it can be stated
on most positive authority that

The court then asked Winters if he had
any further questions to ask and Winters
replied that he was through. The court
then held him to appear before the Su
perior Court to answer to the charge of
burglary and fixed his bonds at $10,0(KX
The officers took Winters to the scene
of the robbery this afternoon to help lo
cate the rest of the missing bullion.
This answer brought a roar of laughter,
as it was evident that Winters bad made
the Sheriff . admit that no burglary had
been committed, as he had never been In
side the. smelter at all.
"It would," was the reply.
"Then it would be possible for the man
to crawl into that hole under the vault
without getting inside the smelter,
wouldn't it?" asked Winters.
"About three feet."
When Veale had finished tho Judge
asked Winters if he wanted to question
the. witness; Winters replied with a smile
that he did.. li â¢. Â» '; : â¢
; "Mr. i ; Veale,! how far was.it from Â¦ the
entrance of'the tunnel?" asked Winters.
\ "About four feet," replied Veale.
"How deep was the hoiÂ© under the
smelter?". â¢ Â¦
Winters Asks Questions.
The Sheriff then told how he and Moilea
went to San Francisco and saw Winters
after his arrest, and that Winters had ex
plained to him the precautions he had
taken to be sure of his haul. He had
watched the steamer Sunol stop and then
he went to a place where he could see
how much, bullion was locked up in the
safe. When this was done he went to his
cabin, got his drill and went to work.
Veale was at Vallejo Junction when the
divers brought up the gold and Winters
was- on hand to ihelp them out. He said
that. Winters was Inclined to be fair with
the officials who were 'looking after the
gold. . .:
Harry Middleton, an assayer employed
by the Selby, people, testified that he had
helped to check up the loss and placed it
at$2S3,000. He was present and identified
some of the gold bars when they were
brought out*irf the bay by the divers.
Sheriff: R. R. Veale explained how he
and Constable Moiles on the morning of
the robbery went over the ground care
fully, looking for clews. After examining
the books" of the smelter to see what men
were working on the day and night shifts
they finally decided to investigate Win
ters' cabin. Veale said that, in company
with Moiles, Morse and Jackson, he vis
ited Winters' cabin, finding many things
which pointed to Winters as the criminal.
A pistol was found covered with mud of
the kind that came out of the tunnel.
Cloth such as was used on the cover
which fitted over the mouth of the tun
nel was found, together with a spade and
other suspicious' articles.
Sheriff Veale Testifies.
Joseph,, Bulger of : the .'city office of the
Selby Smelting: Works was called' to" the
stand, but his testimony amounted V to
little, except as to the amount of : unre
fined bullion shipped to the smelter the
night of the robbery. . ; :
John M. Owens testified to having locked,
sixteen sacks and four bars of bullion in
the vaults on the evening of August .5.'
On opening the safe at 5 o'clock on the
morning of the 6th he discovered the
robbery. The sacks and the four bars
had been "stolen. He followed the tunnel
to the mouth, and, with other workmen,
traced the red pepper trail to the bay
shore, where he found two bars and some
sacks. He did not know the value of the
gold in the safe on the night of the
robbery.
CROCKETT, Aug. 17.â John .Winters,
charged. with having robbed the vault of
the Selby Smelting Company of bullion
exceeding $280,000 in value, had his pre
liminary examination here this morning
and pleaded guilty. .The preliminary
examination of Winters took place before
Justice of the Peace Pratt.. The great
crowd which filled the courtroom was
satisfied after the examination that
Winters is not the fool many suppose him
to be. When asked If he wanted a lawyer
he redied that he waived that and also
the examination. However, Lawyer Pres

The . oM man notified Sheriff Sparks of
the murder and he was, soon in pursuit of
Valencia with ' a well armed posse. The
trail was easily followed and the posse Is
close upon the Â¦ murderer. The young
woman was stabbed four times, receiving
three wounds in the. back and one in the
neck which struck the jugular vein and
caused death. Feeling is intense against
Valencia, but Sheriff . Sparks will attempt
to bring him back. safely if he once comes
upon him.
The brtde wanted to attend a ball on
Thursday night and persuaded her Hus
band to go with . her. This function was
the cause of the fatal stabbing. Return
ing home Valencia accused ; his wife of
being false to him. He declared that she
paid too much attention to other fellows,
but she innocently protested that she
acted as she always had done, in a man
ner becoming a pure woman. The couple
according to the story of the father of
the girl, who was in the â¢ house at the
time, talked over the accusations, and he
believed they had gone to bed in peace.
During the night the father heard one
cry of pain . from his daughter, and
springing trora his bed ' rushed to her
room. He found that Valencia had
stabbed her and was frantic with rage at
his appearance. Valencia started toward
the old man, swinging a knife which was
dripping with the blood of his young wife,
but the father jumped into a bedroom and
locked the door. Valencia tried to. gain
entrance, but failing ran to the stable
and saddled a horse. Â¦ . ..-..-Â»
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 17.â The people of
Thatcher are aroused, over the terrible
death which came to the twenty-day
bride of Jose Valencia at the hands of her
husband on Thursday night. The victim

At least eleven cars were blown to

crews have been sent to the scene of the
disaster, and at midnight more than 200
men are at work clearing the track. The
tunnel, fortunately, appears : riot -to have
been damaged, though the track and road
bed are torn up for a Â¦great 3 distance. It
is not expected that -the three* wrecking
crews will have the. track, cleared and re

The train, crew miraculously escaped
with only a few bruises and scratches. A
number of tramps who were riding in a
half closed car, escaped, it is believed, but
until the debris is cleared the Ios3 of life
cannot be known. ,
The explosion was felt for miles around.
A car filled with- acid took fire and the
flames spread to the dry brush and tim
ber, causing a fierce conflagration. Cow

track at this point, was filled with debris
and burning wreckage. "The buildings of

parted, the air hose breaking and the

Â« H doan want no trouble," re
*\ marked Mr. Hamilton Thompson
/A\ yesterday as he expostulated with
jX a customer .-who was objecting to
having his face sterilized by im
mersion in a bowl of boinng water. "Ah
doan want no trouble, but de Health
Board nab done sai-id mugs is ter be put
in b'iling watah, an' de ordah am gwine
ter be carried out in dis heah shop."
Mr. Thompson was finally persuaded
that the order concerning mugs was ap
plicable only to those made of china and
the customer was allowed to go after
having 'the back of his neck shaved and
promising 1 to come around at a later date
and indulge in an egg shampoo.
Thls incident is only one of several such
that have occurred since the Board of
Health issued its now famous order re
garding the sanitary rules that must be
observed in barber shops in the future.
The inspiration that , governed the- birth
of these rules had its begiotiing in an in
gTOwing hair discovered under .the cuticle
of a member of the board after that gen
tleman had extended 10 cents' worth of
patronag-e to a south of the slot non-union
Eliop. The doctor was justly, incensed,
and fearing that some of his "colleagues
might be treated to a like distressful and
enortif ying experience "he drafted the reg
ulations, which "were , immediately and
unanimously adopted. . ; \-
The first of these regulations say that
rJI "mugs" must be ' immersed in hot
water 'after being used. The second or-
der says that all razors shall be' wiped
with alcohol before and after being used.
By the barbers who will be forced to wit
ness such a-.sinfuL waste, of .the precious
fluid this order is looked upon in the light
of a barbarous and unusual punishment
Another serious kick that the -knights
of the. razor have is against the rule that
makes it incumbent upon them to disin
fect all the instruments used in their
shops. They contend that this is impos
sible when applied to the literature which
is such an attractive feature of each well
regulated place and that an attempt at
its enforcement is sure to drive trade
away.
The disadvantages, however, are not all
on the side of the barbers. Customers
are made to suffer likewise. Special at
tention is called to the order prohibiting
the use of shops for dormitory purposes.
This will work untold hardship on those
who have been accustomed to pass a por
tion of each morning in luxurious dolce
far niente while an attentive servitor by
th'e use of hot towels removed from' their
countenances the evidences of the mild
and cheering excesses indulged in the
night before.
Altogether the rules seem to be destined
to promote sanguinary as well as sani
tary conditions if they are enforces.
Some such Idea must have struck the
Boaid of Health, for in a resolution fol
lowing- the adoption of the barbers'
troubles it is stated that the City Under-

All cases of female diseases, including
menstrual irregularities, displacements,
ulcerations, inflammations, discharges,
irritation of the ovaries, tumors and
dropsy of the abdomen, should apply at
once and become registered as regular pa-
The treatment will be conducted by cor-
respondence. The doctor will prescribe all
medicines, applications, hygienic and diet-
ary regulations necessary to complete a
cure. The medicines prescribed can be
obtained at all drugstores. This offer will
prevail during the summer months. Any
woman can become a regular patient by
sending a written statement of her age,
condition of life, history and symptoms of
her derangements.
I In view of the great multitude of women
suffering from some kind of female dis-

who has any affection of this kind.
As Is well known, Dr. Hartman la the
president of .the Hartman Sanitarium, an
Institution which has a department de-

male diseases. He Is thus brought to see
thousands of such cases every year, the

treatment had cost her husband, who was
a poor man, hundreds of dollars. They
had been obliged to deny them :3lves
many comforts of life In order ' 3 get
money enough to pay the physiciar i.
Picking up the paper one day she hap-
pened to read an item which contained
the news that Dr. Hartman would treat
such cases free of charge by letter. She
immediately wrote the doctor, describing
her case and giving him all her symp-
toms. She soon received a letter telling
her exactly what to do and what medi-
cines and appliances to get. She began
the treatment (the principal remady be-
ing Peruna) at once, and in a few weeks
was well and strong again and able to do
her own work.

No one knows better than Dr. Hartman
how much the women suffer with diseases
peculiar to their sex. No one knows bet-
ter than he does how many of them suf-
fer with such diseases. Patiently, hope-
fully, wearily and often silently they eke

SEATTLE, Aug. In Fletcher Bay.
Balnbridge Island, about eighteen miles
by water west of Seattle, a two-masted
schponer burned to the water's edge and
sank Thursday night. Her owner,' Captain
Hart, lost his life in the fire. Some of
those who witnessed ' the " destruction of
the vessel believe that \ Hart was robbed
and murdered, that the schooner was then
set on fire and left to sink, so that . all
traces of the crime should be blotted out.
The story was brought to Seattle this
morning by P. Erlandsen, who has a place
on Fletcher Bay and who witnessed, the
burning of the Â¦ schooner. '..'Â¦-Â¦ ' ..-.
"Hart, with his schooner, the Lillie and
Maud, visited Fletcher Bay on Thursday
afternoon," said Erlandsen. "He put in
at about 3 o'clock, casting anchor about
400 feet out from the mouth of the bay.
At 9.30 o'clock in 1 the evening, just as 1
was preparing for .bed, I saw a small
blaze at the spot where Hart had an
chored. The flames began to increase and
soon I made out; the form of , the schooner.
I got my skiff as quickly as I could and
put out to the burning vessel. - .
"Just as I started I heard an explosion
and for an instant the flames increased
in brilliancy. When about 100 feet from
the schooner there came another explo
sion and then I heard a large number of
reports, such as shells would make in ex
ploding. I could do no good by approach
ing any clo/er to the boat and I saw that
I would be endangering my life by do
ing SO. " "
"At first I 'believed the burning 1 , of the
schooner to have been an accident, but
the more I think of it now the more I
become convinced that some black deed
has been committed. When I was .rowing
over to the burning schooner Thursday
night I heard voices to the north of the
boat. As I came within the range of the
light cast upon the water by the flames
I distinctly heard a voice exclaim: 'My
God, there's a boat!* Of course I don't
know whether they referred to my skiff
or to the schooner, but I believe they
meant the skiff. They didn't come near
the schooner and seemed to be trying to
get away as quickly as possible. I be
lieve one of the men whom I heard talking
was an Indian, but I am not quite sure
of that.". . ' .- - â¢Â« *>Â« V

Miller.
Miss Lion has been a leader In San Jose
society, and Mr. Fay is prominent in
social and club circles in San Jose
and the metropolis. It was 'expected
that when the marriage took place it
would be a big social function. It was
quite a disappointment to the society in
which both moved that such was not the
case. Its simplicity was out of deference
to the opinion of the father, L. Lion, who.
although a man of large affairs, main
tains the utmost simplicity in all that con
cerns himself.
The bride is the only daughter of L.
Lion, president of the Commercial and
Savings Bank of this city and a man of
wealth. She has several brothers who are
prominently connected with the social,
commercial and political life of the Gar
den City. Mr. Fay is the private secre
tary of Mayor Phelan and has large com
mercial Interests.
The bridal tour will extend to the prin
cipal points in Southern California, term
inating at Coronado. The" couple drove
from the church to the train and will
make Santa Barbara their first stopping
place. Returning in about two weeks
they will take up their residence in San
Francisco.

disease and that he had fallen upon the
railroad track. Dr. W. J. Wickman per
formed the autopsy. Steadman was

Safety of European

important Capture That Adds to the
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 17.â The steam
ship Indrapura of the Portland and Asi
atic line arrived to-day from Hongkong:
and Yokohama.
The Hongkong Daily Press of July 19
says: "A large and important seizure of
arms and ammunition 'was made at
Queen's Road West yesterday. Many hun
dreds of new Mausers, old hammer and
needle guns, several hundred revolvers
and Chinese horse pistols, with ammuni
tion of every kind, was seized and brought
to the central station. There is no doubt
that a seizure important to the European
colonists of Hongkong has been made."
The Kobe Herald of July 19 says: "The
man who stole 30,000 yen in bank notes
from the treasury has been arrested. He
Â¦was an employe of the treasury."
Marquis Ito in an -interview on the sur
plus population of Japan said: "Korea is
the most natural outlet for the surplus
population of Japan. As time goes on the
flow of Japanese emigrants toward Korea
will render the state of affairs tantamount
to unofficial occupation of the peninsula
by Japan."
He expressed the opinion that South
America would offer advantages for many
thousands of laborers.
Murder of a Cowboy.
PHOENIX, Aug. 17.â News reached here
to-day of the murder of Walter Follis, a
cowboy, at Goat Ranch, near Pinos Al
tos, N. M. Follis and a comrade named
Walter Newman had stopped there for
the night and had quarreled. During
the night Newman beat Follis to death,
using a revolver. Newman escaped to the
hills and a Sheriff's posse Is in chase.
Follis was from New York.
Court Awards Divorce Decree.
SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 17.-Mrs.
Delos Wautenbaugh was to-day granted
a divorce. The case has been conducted
very secretly. The principals are promi

Commits Suicide by Mistake.
PHOENIX Aug. 17.â Juan Gacio, a
Mexican woodchopper, was accidentally
killed* near Chitteiyien to-day. He stood
on a limb about eight feet above the
ground and chopped it off the tree. He
jwent down with the limb and his neck
was broken. \ .
The strike was instituted by the carton
makers, who asked for 15 cents. This was
granted and. after they had gone back to
work the packers suddenly quit and de
manded a restoration of the old prices.
They were ordered out of the house and
finally went to a downtown hall and or
ganized a union, under the direction of
F. A. Clark, head of the American Fed
erated Trades here. Later the packing
house people offered the girls 4% cents,
but this, too, was refused.
To-night, at a big mass-meeting, the
union effected better organization. What
the outcome will be is problematical.
The trouble has been brewing for sev
eral daysâ in fact ever since it first be
came known that the price of packing
thirty-six pound boxes of cartons had been
reduced, under the schedule adopted this
year by the Pacific Coast Company, from
5 to 4 cents. Under the old schedule the
expert workers were able to earn from
?2 to $2 50 a day, while the "green hands"
could make anywhere from 75 cents to
$1 50. The carton makers, under the old
price, received 20 cents for each thousand,
the most expert being able to make about
$1 50 or $2 a day. This year the price was
reduced to 10 cents a thousand. The
wages of the "stickers," who last year
received 15 and 20 cents a thousand, had
been reduced about 25 per cent.
FRESNO, Aug. 17.â Seventy girls em
ployed In the Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin
Company's packing-house went out on a
strike for higher pay this . morning, re
fusing to go back to work- even though
the packing-house owners made a partial
concession to their demands.

D. A. Coe at Colton watched the
meteor's-* flight,- which he described as
resembling a skyrocket. The meteor ap
peared to gain in speed.as it neared the
earth, apparently burying itself In the
San Bernardino mountains. Prom San
Bernardino the report says: "The meteor
seemed "barely to escape the summits of
the San Bernardino mountains, leaving a
beautiful glow upon their peaks."
A great sensation waj caused by the
phenomenon in Riverside. Pedestrians on
the streets declared that the light was
so strong that the finest print could have
been read by it. Its starting point ap
peared to be from the milky way, - and.
it seemed to pass toward Elsinore, eigh
teen miles southeast.
May Have Hit a. Mountain.
At Alpine Tavern, <on Mount Lowe, the
meteor was seen to flash over the ridge,
its passage lighting up the trees and their
foliage more brilliantly than the stro'ng
Mount 'Lowe searchlight.
At Sierra Madre the Impression was
that the meteor was. as big as the moon
and lighted the firmament as brightly as
in daytime.
From Monrovia Henry C. Post, a school
teacher, reported: "It fell straight from
the zenith at Â£>n altitude of seventy de
grees, falling probably twenty to thirty,
degrees to the horizon. Its direction was
due east and toward San Bernardino.
Calling the moon the size of a plate, I
should say the meteor was the size of a
baseball in comparison.' I have seen many
meteors and all were of a bluish light.
This, however,- was decidedly red in
color." . . . ; '
From Flagstaff, Ariz., the Coconlno Sun
reports: "The, meteor was seen low down
in the southwest. Those who saw it say
it was like -a. big ball of fire, scattering
as it disappeared from view."
At Pomona, Fred Smith declares. Its
trail was directly east. He saw the flash
of the falling meteor, which left a bril
liant trail of light in its wake", illuminat
ing the entire sky. .
At Hesperia, ori the Mojave desert,
Richard Qulnby said the meteor had the
appearance of, exploding a trifle south of
east from his. viewpoint. A similar report
came from Summit. . .
The first . impression of those who wit
nessed the phenomenon was that the
strong light came from one of the big
electric headlights of the heavy Pasa
dena cars. Of course this idea was but
momentary, for the entire heavens was
illuminated for probably two seconds,
when there appeared to be a sudden disin
tegration of the luminous body. The
meteor was described by many witnesses
as oblong," while others declared it to be
of globular form.
Telegraphic and telephone Inquiries
were at once 'made by the Los Angelea
Herald at many points eastward, the an
swers indicating . that the visitor made
little change in its -appearance on Its tour,
giving in each locality an apparent disin
tegration for the j benefit of spectators.
*.-..Â¦ " Appeared to Explode.
'LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17.â A' brilliant
meteor shot through the sky tn a south
easterly direction at 7:55 o'clock to-night.
A flash of light, mellow In Its glow, yet
as penetrating and fleeting as the rays of
a searchlight, then scattering Into a
myriad of fragmentsâ such was the vision
beheld by hundreds~of citizens as . their,
eyes were attracted skyward by the sud
den and unwonted illumination. Ordinary
mortals called it a meteor; the scientists
differentiated it into a bolide, distin
guished from the ordinary meteor in that
it 'is not stone producing. â¢

Dr. Marroquin's Address in Behalf of
Colombia's Cause.
A fervent' address or pronuriciamento to
his countrymen has been Issued by Dr.
Marroquin, vice president ln charge of the
Government of Colombia, a copy of which
has been received in this city by Consul
Eeciplon Canal, who represents the Co
lombian Government at this port. In this
address Dr. MarroQuin asserts that the
rebellion has been unjustified at all times
and that it is less justifiable now than
ever. At the beginning "it might have
been less criminal and insane." so writes
Dr. Marroquin, "than now." It has"
brought desolation and ruin upon Colom
bia. When the civil war broke out Dr.
Merroquin was not in charge of the Co
lombian Government. The post of titular
vice president which he now occupies was
taken to satisfy the pressing opinion of
his compatriots, owing to the physical un
fitness of President Sanclemente. Some
of the sentences in the pronunciamento,
which has very recently been published,
give an inkling concerning the white heat

SALT LAKE, Aug. 17.â The Union Pa

wrecked at Table Rock, near Greenrlver,
Wye, this morning. Three of the train
crew and thirteen passengers were in
jured, none seriously, however. '
All of this has been actually proven by the
official publications Issued by the Cabinet in
Bogota '' They, date from the first of April.
This view has not been denied, either by the
Conservative Government of Colombia or by
her Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni
potentiary in this capital. "
While the Government of Venezuela was sur
prised by the first and second Invasions of her
frontier by 6000 and 2000 men respectively, the
invaders were victoriously expelled by the Gov
ernment and the people of Venezuela.
Since said events 10,000 men have been
massed on the frontier for the defense and
integrity of Venezuela and its national honor.
These are quite apart from her active service
troops on other parts of the frontier, as well
as national troop3 scattered over the republic
and the reserve militia now under arms.
Venezuela has not accepted the invasion as
an international attack by the people of Colom
bia against the people of Venezuela, but, know
ing Its real source, recognizes ln It the work
of the Conservative Government of Colombia

** iela - TORRES CARDENAS,
. â¢ General Secretary.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 17.-In the name
of his Excellency, General Castro, I reply > to
your cablegram In the following terms:
The Government of Venezuela, presided over
by General Castro, is fully Justified in all its
works and acts. It is essentially liberal in Its
practices. It Is of the opinion that the Con
ecrvatives of Colombia, probably led by ruin
ous and wicked passions, have resolved to as
sist in a revolutionary movement against Ven
ezuela and her government.
eral secretary of President Castro of Ven
ezuela, in reply to a dispatch addressed
to the President asking him for a state
ment on the Venezuela-Colombia situa
tion:
There has also been talk of abuses ln pre
vious administrations that , were to be. cor
rected, and notwithstanding the unquestion
able fact that the actual - Government works
assiduously and honestly to protect the inter
ests of the nation. It etill is the . object of
vicious malevolence nnd systematic perpecu
tion by the very men that are so favored. " They
*eem to think little, or not at all. that the
day may yet come when the Government., in
order to perform the most sacred: of duties,
which is to maintain order and to re-estab
lish peace, will see itself compelled to proceed
as all Governments have acted in emergen
cies equal to the present one. -
It has been said, by the authors of the bound
less crime which is actually annihilating Co
lombia, that they fight tÂ° regain -political
rights that they seem to have lost; and- yet
those very men obstruct and entangle , the
course and natural development which. In the
democracies prepares the peaceful exchange of
political parties into power.
No Government, ln the same exceptional cir
cumstances through which mine has had to
traverse, could nor would act with more
patriotic and fraternal feeling than has mine.
We have employed benignity and kindness
where others doubtless would have resorted to
force and punishment; and in the face of all
these frequent and exceedingly generous proofs
of good will Â¦ toward our enemies they have
had the inconnlderate boldness and daring to
state, by speech and by the press, ln the coun
try and abroad, that the Government , of Co
lombia has treated the rebels with excessive
severity and even with harshness.
I like to suppose that the rebels are trying
to ertaMlsh something new. Thfs could not be
but a. new constitution and a new Legislature,
but ln our land we have already tasted all
kinds of constitutions and all imaginable Leg
islatures, and we know by experience that the
nation'* happiness could not be secure by
mutability of laws nor by new essays or re
forms. Experience has also taught us that
any political system that prevails after any
revolutionary war, may it be bloody or other
wise, could not last, because the people of our
race do not consent to be governed for a long
time by the same men nor by the same prin
ciples, and also because our people are always
prone to see the Government the orlein of
their adversities, though they may come by
the will of heaven or through the disturbances
of the elements.
In sneaking of the vicissitudes which
have already -befallen Colombia-'Dr. Mar
roquin says: *> ?,:
Those who were then at its head under the
circumstances have had reasonable expecta
tions of success in a short time. To-day
things have changed and those who keep up
the tstruggH are entirely convinced of their
error. However, in their own wrath and eee
ir.c that their downfall is unavoidable, they
wi*h to drag into It the whole nation. The
rebels have no flag to follow." They propose to
demolish that which exists to-day. But no
body knows. what they would build up if they
could entirely accomplish their designs. To
Inflict >enreance on those who are not their
followers and to seize or destroy their prop
erty seems to be the only object of their ef
forts Til" excess to which they have com
mitted themselves and the transgressions into
which they have fallen . would be sufficient
reasons to dishonor and condemn any cause
that would have received their support. â¢

TRAIN CRASHES
INTO ENGINES
Less than five minutes later a message
was received on board the Lucania an
nouncing that her approach had been
flashed to' shore and from that section
into the office of the Herald. A' storm of
enthusiasm was caused among the passen
gers by the announcement that communi
cation with America had been established.
From the smoking room a cheer went up
for .the Herald, and another for Signor
Marconi, the inventor of wireless . teleg
raphy.
. "Nt, Nt, Nt," again and again the ques
tioning signal was flashed out across the
ocean. "Lv, Lv," there was at last the
answering signal.
"Here they are," shouted the operator,
and, sure enough, as distinctly as could
have been accomplished by means of a
land wire, the signal was printed on the
receiving tape, "Lv, Lv, Lv." A computa
tion was made by Captain McKay, who
found that -when communication - was
opened the two stations were seventy-two
miles apart. It was just six minutes after
6 o'clock by the ship's time when the dots
and dashes were received announcing that
the Nantucket lightship had received a
call from .the Lucania and communication
was declared perfected, .
Answering Signal Heceived.
Early signalling was done merely as an
experiment, but at 4 o'clock in the after
noon, while the Nantucket lightship was
still 120 miles to the westward, an elec
trical arm was extended in this . direction
in the first real attempt to establish shore
communication. "Nt, Nt, Nt," between
the brass walls of the Rhumkorff cbilHhe
magnetic spark danced and snapped â¢ in
frenzy and the needle sharply and Im
patiently ticked the signal letters. While
others were impatient and fearful of
failure, the operator, standing with his
hand on the key from which he was send-*
ing mysterious waves scores of miles out
over the ocean, was as confident of suc
cess as he could have been had the two
ships stood side by side. He knew that at
Nantucket Shoals operators as competent
as himself were searching through space
for the Lucania, at the same time holding
themselves in readiness to receive his
messages. Standing just, bedeck of him
were "William Mulock, Postmaster General
of Canada, Representative Joy, member
of Congress from St. Louis, and Captain
McKay.
Early Signalling Done.
Desirous as they were of receiving word
from 'shore, the Lucania's passengers
were not less desirous of telling their
friends of that rush of water^approaching
the maemitude of a tidal wave that had
jumped across the bow, carrying panic
and destruction with it. On account of
the storm which prevailed for. three days
it had been found necessary to lower the
aerial .wire swinging from the lowering
mast and from which the magnetic signals
are given off and through which answer
ing signals are received. At noon on
Friday this wire was raised to Its posi
tion and Operator Hepworth had the
apparatus charged and ready for work.
;NEMT YORK, Aug. 17.â Since the Herald
undertook to establish a wireless teleg
raphy station on Nantucket Shoals light
ship to co-operate with those steamships
that will Install plants on board, experi
ments have been made, usually successful,
in New York harbor, but it has been
arranged that the Lucania should take
the first formal test in passing Nantucket.
On the steamship and on the lightship,
expert operators,; trained under the per
sonal direction of Slgnor Marconi, were
'stationed. The call of the Lucania was
"Nt." The answer from Nantucket Shoals
was to be "L.v." Hig-h up on the middle
bridge of the Lucania a telegraph station
liad been established and about it centered
the interest of all on board. For more than
five days those on the Lucania' had .been
"without news of the old and new worlds.

WOMAN WHO SATS THE ARMY
CANTEEN IS A NECESSARY
INSTITUTION.
â Â¦ â EFORE a large audience last
night Mrs. Clara Belle Brown de
livered a lecture on "The Canteen
_ From an Army Woman's Stand
point." Sherman-Clay Hall had
been handsomely decorated by direction
of Colonel Rawles, post commandant at
the Presidio, and in recognition of the
cause In which Mrs. Brown is now labor
ing the Third Artillery band was present
and rendered choice selections both be
fore and after the lecture.
One of the most amusing features of the
lecture was Mrs. Brown's reference to
Rev. Wilbur Crafts, the sponsor of the
anti-canteen law, and now. according to
her, "talking delegate" of the Interna
tional Reform Bureau of Chicago. Ex
tracts from the testimony of army officers
taken before the Senate committee were
read at length, and as each one favored
the continuance of the canteen her read
ing was frequently applauded.
Mrs. Brown spoke In part as follows:
My 'platform is essentially that of temper
anceâneither total abstinence nor excess.
Country childrenâ and city politiciansâ know
what the see-saw is. It is a machine of
simple construction: a platform with a single
plank, but one end of It is always up in the
air while the other is on the ground. \
. The delirium of total abstlne'nce and fanat
icism is at one end of the see-saw, to which
1 now referâ the delirium of intoxication and
excels at the other. The safe, broad, solid
platform of real temperance is midway be
tween the two extremes.
Webster's dictionary gives this definition 'of
the word "temperance": "Moderate Indulg
ence of the appetite," "Temperately." "Wlth
moderatlon: without excess."
The word "temDerance" has too long: been
used to denote total abstinence from wine,
beer and strong liquorsâ without regard to any
other chase of our moral life.
A total abstainer is not temperate. A total
toper is not temperate. When the society called
"â¢The Woman's Christian Temperance Union"
was first organized it was something to re
vere. Its work was to redeem, not to accuse.
To-day it la an unbalanced political organiza
tion, with yearnings for power at the polls.
Its name is a mistake. It should be called
'â¢The Woman's Total Abstinence Society."
Many of Its members have no claim to the
name of Christian in act or thought. Many
have no right to rally under the total ab
stinence banner. I have talked with many
women who believe that a regular army officer
is a compound of brilliant regimentals and
champagne. That the private .soldier must
become a sot.
The fanatics of to-day. I believe to be the
last remnants of the thought which murdered
a god, burned the martyrs, dragged women as
witches to the stake, in our republic, and to
day cries out that our soldiers are drunkards
through the will of their officers.
The men who hold commissions in the
United States army are- supposed to know
something of what, is good for the private sol
dier. The greatest good to the greatest num
ber might be fitly applied to the government
of American soldiers by American officers. To
keep each soldier In his command neat, clean,
sober and "fit" is the duty and pride of each
man who holds a commission in our service.
There is no subject upon which the officers

One of the sharpest criticisms of Von
Waldersee comes from the Cologne Volks
Zeitung, a leading Centrist organ, which
compares him to Dr. von Mlquel, the for
mer Minister, and refers to him as "play
ing Â¦ the role of â¢ a secret Genen-Kanzler
(anti-Chancellor). 1 The. paper asks whether
Von ; Bulow regards it : in Germany's Â¦ in

such speeches,^ adding: :â'Â¦, . \

Bitter. Comment in Papers.
It is a curious fact that many papers
are discussing which nation Von Walder
see meant as the one whose name paled.
They agree that it could only have been
Great Britain. Indeed, the reference is re
garded as being so direct as to be impol
itic. The Anglophobe papers, however,
rejoice that Von Waldersee "expressed
himself frankly." Even these papers ad
vise him to "speak briefly or not at all."
OnÂ© of the most interesting inferences
drawn from Waldersee's. speeches is that
ho hopes to become Count von Bulow's
'successor as Chancellor. .This is widely
believed, but any one who saw how bent
and weary- Von Waldersee looked -.in the
funeral procession cannot credit the story.
. BERLIN, Aug. 17.â Since the funeral of
the Dowager Empress Frederick this has
been Field Marshal Count von Waldersee's
week. Immediately after the- interment
of the remains a chorus of criticisms of
Von Waldersee broke forth in the press,
owing to his speech at Hanover. ' Papers
of the most different shades are weary of
Von Waldersee's talkativeness, which is
regarded as not only in bad taste In the
allusion to other nations, whose "names
paled in China," but as magnifying the
China campaign far beyond its actual im
portance. *
"My Lords and Gentlemen: It Is satis
factory to be able to close the first Par
liament of my reign with the assurance
that the cordiality of the relations of
Great Britain with the other powers re
mains undhninlshed." . > "
A reference to China is merely congrat
ulatory, on the attainment, of an agree
ment" in regard to the indemnity, security
for its payment and the . punishment , of
the most guilty offenders. In regard to
South Africa the speech says: f Â¦
"The progress of my forces in the con
quest of the two republics by which my
South African colonies have been invad
ed has - been steady and continues. . But,
owing to the difficulty and extent of the
country to be traversed, the length of the
military operations has been protracted."
The speech refers to the signal success
of the Duke of Cornwall and York's visit
to the colonies as "additional proof of the
patriotism, loyalty and devotion of the
people of my dominions over the sea."
The rest of | the speech merely records
the King's satisfaction with the liberal
provisions made , for tho naval and mili
tary services; the arrangements made for
the maintenance of the honor and dignity
of the crown, : "especially those which I af
fect ..the .state and comfort of my royal

Of the 1400. men employed at the Bay
view works 219 belong to the Amalgamat
ed Association. They are the tonnasre men.
Besides the union men there were 200 other
skilled men employed, including roll turn
ers, engineers, machinists, carpenters,
blacksmiths, pipe-fitters and men straight
ening plates and- working on hot beds.
The engineers and roll turners formerly
belonged to the Amalgamated Associa
tion and are in sympathy with It. Em
ployment was given to 1000 unskilled men,
200 of whom worked in the blast furnaces.
Leaders of the Amalgamated Associa
tion now in this city declare that the ac
tion of- the Bayview men will have im
portant bearing on the situation. â¢ They
claim that South Chicago will likely be
influenced, in the same direction. Taking
this view, association leaders gain en
couragement in the war with the United
States Steel Corporation.
W. C. Davis of Chicago, after the meet-
Ing, spoke in strong terms of praise of the
action of the lodge. Davis looks for an
immediate change In the situation at
South Chicago when* -the news of the re
sult of the Bayview meeting becomes
known to the men In his city.
When the meeting was called to order
this afternoon it is said that 157 members
of the lodge out of a total of 219 were
present. Assistant Secretary Michael J.
Tighe made a- long -appeal to the men to
obey the mandate of President Shaffer.
Tighe was followed ' by W. C. Davis of
South Chicago, , vice president of the
Fourth District,- who spoke on. the same
lines. President Joseph Redfern of the
Bayview Lodge took the negative side
and was followed by others who were not
in favor of going out. The speech -making
occupied five hours, and it was close upon
9 o'clock to-night when a secret ballot
was- taken, the result showing a majority
in favor of a strike. When the result was
announced a motion to make the vote
unanimous in favor of obeying the famous
order was carried without a dissenting
voice. The tension throughout the meet
ing was 'great.
Shaffer's order is said to have been unan
imous, after a session of the lodge lasting
five hours. The plant of the Illinois Steel
Company at Bayview will be shut down
indefinitely and about 1400 men will be
rendered idle.
The mass meeting at White's Opera
house at McKeesport to-night was at
tended by 800 tube workers and was very
enthusiastic. There was keen disappoint
ment, however, at the absence of Presi
dent Shaffer, who was unable to be pres
ent. Secretary John Williams and Ben I.
Davis made the principal speeches. The
former said this strike was the , most
peaceable In the history of the- country,
and that it was so because Intelligent
methods were being used. Both reviewed
the situation and urged the men to remain
firm in their position. . The meeting broke
up with cheers for Mayor Black..- â¢
The only feature of this removal worthy of
nctc is the fact that all possible weight - is
being given to its significance. In order to in
fluence the people in the towns that will be af
fect' d by the loss of the plants. The fact,
however, that there will not be enough men
to operate the mills even after they are re
moved Â¦without our people precludes the idea
that the trust will gain anything by this
threat, which is utterly void of significance
when sifted down to the bottom facts.
At a meeting at Benwood City Hall to
night at 10 o'clock the workers in the steel
department of the Riverside plant of the
National Tube Company voted to join the
strike. It was directed to notify, the man
agement that the steel workers would not
return to work Monday morning, and that
In the meantime they would be taken into
membership in Wheeling Lodge No. 5 of
the Amalgamated Association. This leaves
but 150 men of the 8000 in the Wheeling
district mills of the United States Steel
Corporation still at work. These 150 are
the Riverside furnace men, and it Is said
they will be organized next week and
strike.
Ever since the United States Steel Corpora
tion was formed the plan for cencentrating
plants' in towns where economical operation
was the Btrongest feature has been discussed
and practically decided upon. The only mat
ter left to be settled was a favorable oppor
tunity for carrying out this plan. While bus
iness was so rushed It was directed to keep
â¢11 mills In operation. They would not have
been moved for some time had it not been
that the men refused to work In them under
the conditions imposed by the officials of the
company. Now that the mills are idle and the
trust believes that they will be for some time,
owing to the determined attitude of the men,
thin plan of removal will be carried out at
once. ',<?Â¦ \'"\' Â¦-'** :
President Shaffer made a statement
Â¦with respect to the threat of the United
States Steel Corporation to remove cer
tain of their plants from cities where
strong union sentiment prevailed to com
munities that were inclined to be more
friendly. He said:
To Influence the People.
warn the strikers to keep within the law,
but say that If there Is any aggression
against them or any attempt at cur
tailment of their legal rights they cannot
be held responsible for their conduct.
'The Breslau . Chamber of Commerce has
unanimously I passed ( a- resolution . against
maximal minimal, duties, and the
largest manufacturers of Anhalt and the
Province of. Saxony have - unanimously
adopted a .resolution, against every in
crease in duties. .' .
The general secretary of the association,
Herr Burck, : publishes a long reply sup
porting the association's opposition to the
double system of -duties, since It is a
"hindrance to commercial treaties/which
is a life : or death : auestion for â¢ manufac
turers." The controversy seems to por
tend a breach between the manufacturers
and; Agrarians which ; may â¢ have decisive
Influence upon, the tariff legislation.
â¢ The tariff bill continues to be discussed
in a lively manner. The most interesting
event- this week In connection with the
tariff agitation was the declaration of
the Central- Association against maximal
and minimal duty on cereals, and the
Agrarians were there, too. The declar
ation so enraged the Kreuz Zeitung that
the paper threatened 'that the Agrarians
would vote to abolish the iron duties
which are most oppressive to agriculture
and to then wipe out ' all protection on
manufactured goods. "Ehe Deutsche Tages
Zeitung, a leading Agrarian organ, ap
plauds the Kreuz Zeltung's threat.
The Conservatives defend Von "Walder
see's utterances, but the Berlin Neueste
Nachrichten does so clumsily, by pleading
it was a "confidential, informal and
wholly extempore ; speech." ->*.;Â¦ v
The National Liberal , papers criticize
the speech unfavorably.' The Muenicher
Allgemeine Zeitung says it is tactless, and
the, National Zeitung refers to its "vain
glorious challenging tone." j
Challenging and Vainglorious.
Referring to Von "Waldersee's expres
sion "Other nations paled while the Ger
man name mounted higher," the-Ham
burger , Nachrichten continues: "Such
vainglorious expressions unnecessarily
draw the attention of our rivals to us. It
mobilizes them against' us,, the effect of
which we must feel very shortly." It
regards the speech as calculated to foster
anti-German feeling in the foreign press,
causing "fresh suspicions to be aimed at
Germany." ,.'....
"His Hanover speech by.~no means
shows his fitness for the Chancellorship.
It is unstatesmanlike for him to boast of
diplomatic achievements in China In a
form directly wounding to other nations."
' The Hamburger Nachrichten (National
Liberal) disposes of Von Waldersee rather
savagely. It says: ,
enough in internal politics, much more
must many cooks spoil the broth in dip
lomatic affairs. Either the nation will
have to accept the Chancellorship of Von
Waldersee or he. must stop talking."
The plant has been put In a defensive
condition and arrangements have been
made to have the workers on the property
until there is no longer any dancer that
they will be molested. There is also dan
c^r of trouble at the Carnegie plants.
They are all heavily guarded and a dem
onstration against them by the strikers
â¢would, it is feared, provoke a serious
clash. The strike leaders continue to
Good order has been preserved through
out all the districts, but the irritation at
points of contact between strikers and
strike breakers is increasing and it Is be
lieved here that there will be violence be
fore another week elapses. Monessen Is
picked as one of the places where trouble
is expected. It is stirred to the fighting
1>oint by the plan to start the steel mill
A^Kith non-union men. A force of the lat
*ft?r gathered in the South is expected at
7the mill daily, and the strikers have pa
trolled the town in expectation of its ar
rival. They declare that the non-union
men shall not be permitted to enter the
mill and the steel managers are just as
cetermined that they shall.
Good Order Prevails.
One business man denned the strike as
being topheavy. The steel corporation has
made no move toward breaking the strike
in McKeesport, but unquestionably will do
something if there is a further growth of
the reactionary sentiment. The strike
leaders scout the suggestion that their
IÂ»osltion in McKeesport is in any danger.
They say they have the town tied up, and
that they will keep it so until the strike
is won.
It is also claimed that sentiment Is
shifting around in reaction from the wave
of unionism that swept over the city, and
that conservative opinion among business
and professional classes favors the re
sumption of work by all men not directly
concerned- in the strike.
The information from Milwaukee and
"Wheeling came after a day of exceeding
quietness throughout the strike districts.
The forces at the non-union mills in oper
ation were not increased during the day
and neither side had made an important
move. The employes of the Pennsylvania
Tube Works, a. plant in this city con
trolled by the National Tube Company,
completed their organization as a lodge of
the American Federation, of Labor to-day ,
and made a demand on the management
for a general advance in wages. There are
about 1000 employes in the works and it is
claimed that S'b of them have been or
ganized. They threatened to join the
strike unless their demand was granted.
The management agreed to meet a. com.
mittc-e on Monday, and it is believed an
advance in wages will be agreed to. These
:;re the first men outside the Amalgamat
ed Association to couple a demand in their
own behalf with their threat to strike.
The strikers are making a determined
effort to extend their organization among
the men employed by the great group of
Carnegie mills. It is understood they
liave secured a foothold in the Duquesne
property and that the men who have
Jninrrt them will be called out probably
to-morrow or Monday. The officials of the
cempany admit that they may lose some
men. but that the boast of the Amalga
Â¦ crated Association to close the plant down
Thrill never be fulfilled.
Possible Break in. Banks.
There is a strong possibility of an early
break in the ranks of the strikers at Mc-
Keesport- Many of the unorganized men
have become dissatisfied and make no se
cret of their threat to 'go boldly back to
the National Tube Company and ask for
their places just as soon as they gain suf
ficient following to withstand pressure
from the strikers or are given a. guaran
tee of personal protection. Several of
them, in stating their position, say they
*iave everything to lose and nothing to
gain by staying out. They have made no
demands in their own behalf on their tm- :
plovers, but are merely out in an effort to
strengthen the hands of the Amalgamated
Association. Wherever and however the
contest ends, they say, they can see noth
ing in it for them but loss of wages and
possibly a loss of places.
Threaten to Join the Strike.
\\ hen the news from Milwaukee reached
nere to-night it was quickly spread among
j'.ie strikers. They were highly enthusi
astic over it and renewed their assur
ances of their complete confidence in final
success in their contest against the Unit
ed States Steel Corporation. The leading
steel officials had gone to their homes
when the news was received and no ex
pression on the subject was obtainable
irom them. An officer of a subsidiary
company said that it would merely make
the steel corporation more determined to
win. â¢-;.'.
mea in the Riverside plant at Wheeling
had voted to strike, awakened new enthu
siasm, in the ranks of the Amalgamated
Association and its followers to-day.
There had been some doubt as to the
final decision of the Milwaukee lodges and

, Of one tjnng.-alf factions in the islands may be sure. If the frequent messengers to Wash
ington and the numerous lobbyists around Congress become too annoying to the Federal Gov
ernment and their conflicting demands tod importunate, a remedy; will be found by dismantling
Hawaii as a Territory, with large and, life-size territorial ; politics, and attaching the archipelago to
California as a county. We do not favor that, but* the time may: come when it will be necessary.
Then these expert politicians who are accustomed: to revolution and agitation can interest them
selves in electing county officers; and" occupy their genius for statesmanship by selecting a Clerk,
Sheriff and Superior -Judge. They will be less expensive as-a "county and just as. ornamental. Thev
can r come over to our State Fair and make themselves sociable. Their County Supervisors can .
belong to the association of such, and their children' will be qualified to belong to" the Â¦Native Sons â¢
of the Golden West, -and can have parlors -and .celebrate Admission day right in the capital ofthe
Kamehamehas." I S Â» , . â¢ :
Â£Â£r b HE Paradise of the Pacific" seems to have an acute attack of politics. Tempers there
1 are getting more than tropically torrid. It is a surprise when a steamer from Honolulu
I does not bring some messenger, of a faction speeding to Washington' to' inflame'-oni
*â¢ cial ears with the story of outrage upon his side by the other/. When such ' delegates
are lacking in the first cabin, the mails, bring news of the marchings and countermarching of ''the'
vcontending forces, .who -are making life dusty by their quarrels. At this distance it ! seems strange
that people, who sprinted toward happiness in , annexation are so unhappy* in possession of what
they wanted. There seems to" be a good deal of Dole. in the government there. Governor Dole has
the validity of his acts passed upon by Attorney General Dole, and if a Grand jury could be made
up of Doles we might expect justice to be doled out to the satisfaction of one crowi at least.
These divisions will probably cease when the time comes to apply to, Hawaii the law exclud
ing all kinds of Asiatic coolies. When coolie labor ceases there will not be as rich spoils to quarrel
over, and life will be more bland and Quaker-like, and the Paradise of the Pacific will be more
HAWAIIAN POLITICS.

the! steady and continued conquest, and the theory may be correct. It will be remembered, how
ever, that the British have made many a miscalculation in the war, and this may be another.
The steady : and continued conquest' may have to go on a long time yet-before it reaches a
The further claim that the progress of conquest has been steady and continued may be
disputed. Since, the surrender of their cities, which they .were unable to defend without shutting
themselves up to be bombarded by British guns, the Boers appear to have held their own in
every part of the two republics. Outside their camps and the garrisoned towns the authority of
the British extends no further than the range of their guns.. On the very day that Edward de
livered his speech to Parliament a report came from South Africa telling of the capture of forty
British scouts within a short distance of one of. the.'many military posts that are maintained in
the country they are seeking to conquer.
Thus at last the claim of the Boers that their country was an independent nation, and that
the war made upon them is one of conquest and aggression, is acknowledged by the sovereign of
Great Britain in a, formal and official statement.
KING EDWARD has prorogued his first Parliament with one .of- those short" addresses
from the throne Avhich British statesmen have long ago learned how to construct in
grave and diplomatic language that, sounds well and means nothing. On this occasion,
however, the King's Ministers appear to have been more careless than usual. After hav
ing declared many times over that thÂ£ Orange Free State and the Transvaal republic- were never
independent, but have ever been subject to British sovereignty., the royal address from the throne
throws aside all such pretense and frankly informs Parliament: "The progress of my force's in
the conquest of the two republics by which my' South African colonies, have been invaded
has been steady, and continued." â¢ . . ,

It Is a fashion of the year before last,
therefore absolutely. Inadmissible now. to
discuss the morale of a play. "Art for
art's sake" is to-day's watchword, and a
good one. nevertheless I am about to don
the moral gaberdine of that most ancient
of yesterdays and courageously adventure
into the ethical mysteries of "Silver

concerns itself with the story of John the
Baptist and follows closely the Biblical
record, â¢with one Important exception,
Herodias Is made to become enamored of
Johnâ a sort of gospel^ccordlng to Saint
Sardou â and demands his head as revenge
for the apostle's rejection of her love.
This not improbable incident of course
adds largely to the dramatic Interest of
the play, forming, indeed, its central inci
dent. Mr. Eisner has certainly construct
ed an ingenious drama out of his mate
rial. If it looks as well on the stage as it
does in type, and Belasco & Thall are
making the effort of a lifetime in its
mounting. The play calls for fifty speak
ing parts, and will be taken on a tour
after its presentation at the Central by
a company headed by Robert Downing,
who will be John the Baptist, and Miss
Annette Marshall, who appears as Hero
dias. The drama has been submitted to
a number of high ecclesiastical " authori
ties, encountering so far only . favorable
criticism.' Â¦Â¦ â¢
Edward Eisner, author of "A Voice
From the "Wilderness," is not unknown to
fame. He is author of one of the versions
of "Under Two Flags," "Francesca" da
Rimini" and a dramatization of "The
Story, of an African Farm" that Olga
Nethersole produces this season in New
York. "A Voice From the Wilderness"
Another \iewpolnt, one almost beautiful
enough to be true, is that a spiritual re
vival Is taking place among the drama
tists, foreshadowing perhaps a develop
ment of the dramatic art akin to those of
the- great periods of painting and sculp
ture, whose inspiration has always been
of that kind, for Phidias, in his miracles
of sculptured beauty, was no less truly
divinely inspired than gentle Raphael or
Rubens. Perhaps the time has come for
a like uplifting of the art dramatic, for
the long-looked-for "elevation | of the
stage." But we shall see, and meantime
three religious plays are upon us. '
Not to insinuate for a moment that the
above playwriting trio suggest vaudevil
lism in the smallest degree, but the coin
cidence is at least sufficiently singular
that they shall have simultaneously an
nexed the said properties for theatrical
purposes.
THE play scriptural Is the thing
just now and California is very
much to the fore' in the matter.
Almost simultaneously three Im
portant religious dramas will be
produced in Chicago, New York and San
Francisco. The time set for their produc
tion 5f the beginning of September, and
the plays are Stephen Phillips' "Herod,"
to be given by Richard Mansfield in Chi
cago; Clay M. Greene's Passion Play,
"Nazareth." to be produced by W. A.
Brady in New York, and "A Voice From
the Wilderness," a new play by Edward
Eisner, that will be put on here by Be
lasco & Thall at the Central Theater.
It were an interesting speculation to
follow out the causes that have led to the
above curious coincidence, the simultane
ous recognition of the dramatic value of
the divine story by three so different
dramatists as Phillips. Greene and Eis
ner. It comes curiously, for instance, after
a queer blaphemy of George Moore's in
"A Drama in Muslin," where he makes
the Novelist Harding say:
The world has lived through Christianity, as
it has through a score of- other things, and
Bethlehem. Nazareth and the Dove have al
ready been bequeathed to the vaudevillists of
the future.

The woman who goes into the marriage
business for. a livelihood to-day. is out of
her period and asks sympathy in vain.
She belongs to the fainting epoch, to the
era of the cut stay lace.- to the' day when
the kitchen, dairy and field were the' only
professions open to her sex. But Laura
marries Latimer for "home protection, the
right to wear clothes that are honestly
paid for and eat food that is hers by law"
and has not even the up-to-date virtue of
womankind, the business-like sticking to a
bargain. She falls in love with the in
evitable other man, John Darlford, and
confesses it in torrid terms. Then, in all
sincerity, to atone for her sin, she con
templates "saving" her husband by yield
ing to Crevelt' s desires. That is, the wife
of one man. In love with another, regards
the bestowal of herself upon a third as a
sacred atonement to her husband for the
sin of loving the secondâ truly an amazing
situation. <Â¦ - :
Crevelt is frankly the villain, and com
fortably consistent in his dishonorable in
tentions throughout three, acts, until, as
White Whittlesey superfluously mixed atid
muddled it on Wednesday n;ght, Laura
unwittingly owes to him" "the very food
that shelters her, the roof that keeps her
alive!" Also, later, the welcome widow's
veil is added ' to his beneficences. The
fourth' act shows* him repentant, and with
extravagant improbability- reconciled to
his Inamorata's marriage to another man.
It is possible, however, tlm.t.he" had come
to the conclusion that the game was not
worth the candle, the fair Laura in her
way being quite as' curious 'a specimen of
womanhood as- Latimer, Crevelt and Darl
ford are weird types of men."
Now, though there Is some doubt left in
the audience's mind as to which of this
precious trousered trio is intended as the
hero of the play, Latimer, barring a slight
matter of the embezzlement of trust
funds, is evidently regarded by his wife
and the playwright as a reasonably vir
tuous person and a much injured man.
Yet this faithful and affectionate husband,
when pushed to the wall by the villain in
the play, actually permits Creyelt to
leave the room with his teeth intact after
a suggestion that ; the complaisance of
Laura would save him, Latimer, from
financial disgrace. Not only that,, but he
acts upon the suggestion, and In terms
more plain than elegant tells his wife not
"to 'quarrel with her dinner." He further
advises herâ implores herâ to permit Cr-s

thing â a something to be shunned and despised.
After four years of married life "that has been
but a record -of days and nights she meets and
lo\-as John Darlford. It. is her awakening. Cre
velt has made himself the friend of Latlmer to
be near Laura, and to work his ends pushes
Latimer to the wall at a critical turn in his
fortune. He offers to put- him on. his feet, save
him from disgrace (defalcation), if Laura will
come away with him. The plot at the most
critical and hopeless point unwinds itself by
the sudden death of Latimer, who kills him

disgrace. Thus the revenge of Cjevelt com

traction for the patrons of the Opera Comique

was a curiosity to see the fair Callfornlan after
her eventful career during the last few years.
She 'certainly has the same beautiful figure.
Her part in the opera is to pose, which she did
to ' perfection, the only fault to find with her
costume being the queer taste displayed in
wearing a modern Rue de la Paix hat with a
medieval dress. I am waiting for the verdict
of the New York jury of critics, for Dame

next season. My opinion ia that the American

the case over here.

Salassa's Iago has been another event
of the last week, and a truly brilliant
performance it is. To speak of small
things before great, I do not remember
to have seen any actor that used his
hands with the same grace and intelli
gence that Salassa shows. Instead of
being in the wayâ as they so grievously
and commonly areâ they add to the pic
ture as "the famous Van Dyck hands add
to his portraits, as another eminently
useful means of expressing character. He
is singing so well, too, this season, and
Iago is just the subtle. Intellectual,
statesmanlike role- that exacts Salassa's
excellent best. There is really hope for
the "Falstaff," I hear, which is some
thing to be hoped for, look you ! and
Salassa already fully equipped for the
Fat Knight's jovial part. ' Verdi com
posed the opera at the youthful age of
80 years. It is his last, some say his best
work, and belongs, with "Otello," to what
is called his third period. Boito furnished
the libretto and the net result is a setting
of the comedy that should satisfy the
most - exacting Shakespearean that ever
drew 'breath. .Good Mrs. Kreling please
give our "Falstaff," and if that royalty
ogre of ' Italy, Ricordi, does want the
lion's share of the profits, we will cram
your house as it was never crammed be
fore to make- up the difference!
WITH the advent of Signor Agos
tini and Linda Montanarl this
week at tjie Tivoli, the man
agement of the little opera
house completes a grand opera
cast that for completeness and efficiency
has perhaps not been equaled In the his
tory of the house. Agostlnl more^ par
ticularly Is a valuable acquisition. He
has proved himself vocally one of the
most important figures of the season,
with his sweet, full, penetrating voice,
beautifully used even to reminding- one
of Saleza. His acting sense also is suffi
cient, he haying ''shown himself, in his
Ferdinand possessed both of dignity and
power, and much good work covering a
wide range may be looked for from this
singer during the season. Montanari has
so far been .something of a disappoint
ment, but until she is heard in a role
that is more grateful to her than that of
Desdemona, in which she appeared 'this
week, it is wise to reserve judgment of her
capacities. â¢ Her voice is pure _ and flexi
ble, also very sweet and should. do srood
service in roles of the-Mimi kind. Mon
tanari introduced Puccini's charming
grisette to the American public by the
way, as Agostini . was the original Ru
dolfo, and it will take much more than
an indifferent Desdemona to efface the
memory of h,er good work in "La Bo
hcme." This week she will sing Marguer
ite in Boito's ."Mefistofele," the big nov
elty of the season that is to be given as
alternate bill with "The Barber of Se
ville," beginning on Tuesday evening.
Dado will sing the Mefistofele, said to be
,his best role, and Agostini will be the
Faust. The opera is beautiful and un
usual, : both in the music and setting, and
Boito's talent as a librettist has never
been used to better advantage than in
this adaptation of Goethe's "Faust."
At the average price for the last nine months the wheat crop of 1900 brought
$19,462,040. But that sum was exceeded by the value of the dried fruit crop alone, including
raisins. The export value of the product of the forest, field, mines and waters of 'California ior
1900 probably exceeded, $125,000,000. : Each individual article entering into the sum total of our
exports is yet short of the possibilities of production except wheat, which has probably passed
its zenith and will decline until it is not far in excess of the demand for home consumption.' It
will be seen therefore that if wheat were the mainstay of Northern California this part of the
State would see not .far ahead the beginning of marked decadence. , :. Y *
The- adolescent nature of our other industries .is shown by the gain in 1900 over the pre
ceding year. This gain in carloads was, in citrus fruits 9462; dried fruits, 312;- canned. fruits, 31;
vegetables, 1736; wine and brandy, 353. In the decade 1890 -1900 the . increase . in these ship
ments was 50,602 carloads. By the close of the current decade; the traffic wiil amount to. more
than 200,000 carloads" per season, and will show the greatest production i by field;- qrchard and
vineyard that has ever been known by a similar area in any part of the world. By that time the
world will have come to depend on California for its fruit product, and -,the United States. largely
for its year round" supply of Staple and delicate vegetables. ' ' ':* â¢'Â¦â¢â¢-â¢_..-
We cheerfully acknowledge, that Professor, Mead may' be a prime factor in this by pro
moting irrigation. But when he wants statistics of our production will he please put up his sign,
"Information wanted," and Californians will supply it. ...". 'â¢'â¢"â¢'Â¦ ; . â¢ \- I. v ?
Professor Mead would by the same authority have learned that our dairy product for
1900 amounted to $15,493,272; our beet sugar to 30,319 tons; our hops to 38,000 bales; and our;
wheat to 973,102 tons; our wool to 27,500,000 pounds, ami our lumber to 650,981,012 feet, and
our minerals to $31,000,000. If we were really limited to wheat and oranges California would:
hardly invite enterprise and immigration, since a large population would not be expected to exist
on-9117 carloads of oranges. and 973,102 tons of wheat. The deciduous fruit is more valuable
than the wheat crop and brings more money into the State. Â¦
.' If he had gone to the accurate* report of the State 'Board of Trade he would' have learned
that, for the season of 1900, Northern California shipped out, of the State 87,990 and Southern
California 198 tons of green deciduous fruits; Northern California 8273 and Southern California
218,183 tons of oranges and other citrus fruits; the north exported '84,899; and the south 3696
tons of dried fruits, and the north 34,217 and the south 161 1 tons raisins; the north 2141 and
the south 4349 tons nuts; the north. 45,679 and the south 4928 tons canned fruits, and that the
total export of the whole State of the above was 496,169 tons. The State's total export of wine
was 8084 and of brandy 360 carloads; of vegetables green and canned, 5140 carloads.
Because of his relation to the State and the acquaintance; with its resources which that
relation implies, it. is to be regretted that' Professor Mead has not visited. the productive parts
of California or consulted reliable sources of information, to the end that his official report might
be less misleading on the subject of our developed resources. â¢.: <Â¦.. J- 1 ."
An instance of this is found in "the official report of Mr. Elwood Mead, the chief of
the Irrigation Bureau of the Agricultural Department at Washington. Therein'' he speaks of
the productions of California as being- oranges in the southern counties and wheat in the rest of
the State. Now Mr. Mead has visited California, and indeed is a member of the faculty of our
State University, and lectures a class at Berkeley. His work there is made.a large feature in the
new programme of the institution, as.it ought to be, for forestry "and irrigation are the subjects
vital to the"welfare of California and the most important studies that can interest students and
indeed all classes of our people. , . .. . _. -.. .-.

WASHINGTON, Au^. 17.-Felix A.
Reeve, acting Solicitor of the Treasury,
has rendered an opinion on the question
raised by Frederico de Getau, resident
commissioner from Porto Rico, 'as to
whether a customs duty of 5 cents a
pound should not be imposed on all cof
fees imported into Porto Rico from tha
United States under the terms of the For
aker act. The Solicitor holds adversely
to De Getau's contention, and in tha
course of his opinion says:
"It is evident from the care with which
coffee was excluded in the Foraker act
from the free list, in respect to importa
tions from the United States during tha
existence of the 15 per cent duty system,
that it was the Intention of Congress to
recognize and protect the coffee industry,
in Porto Rico. It can hardly be doubted,
also, that it was not the purpose of Con
gress that such protection should cease*
upon the enactment and installation of a
local system of taxation In Porto Rico.
"The duty of 5 cents per pound on cof
fee was, I think, distinctly a protective
measure. But I regret to say that I seo
no escape from the conclusion that the
broad and unrestricted provision of sec
tion 3, abolishing 'all tariff duties on mer
chandise and articles going into Porto
Rico from the United States' upon the en
actment of a local system of taxation,
etc.. embraces the duty on coffee as well
as the duty on any other article of mer
chandise.
"The case seems to me to be one of
mere inadvertence on the part of Con
gress. They merely neglected to mak<Â»
the . exception of coffee from the free
list applicable as well after the adoption
of the new system of taxation as during
the existence of the 15 per centum duty
.system."

According to the OHphant report to the
United States Geological Survey, the to
tal production of petroleum in the United
States during 1900 was 63,362,704 barrels,
valued at $75,752,691. Thia is the greatest
annual output in the history of the oil
industry in this country. Of the total
amount Ohio i-roduced 22,362,730 barrels;
We3t Virginia. 16,^5,675 barrels; Pennsyl
vania, 13,258.202 barrels: Indiana, 4,874,382
barrels: California, 4,099,484 barrels, and
New York. 1,300,925 Harrels. Colorado,
Kansas, Kentucky and Tennessee are also
oil-producing fctates, but the two former
are the only ones in the group that have
any appreciable Importance.
Dr. Clarence Barrett of Salt Lake City
claims to have extracted oil from shales
in Utah at the cost of 3.2 cents per bar

Suit Over a Lease.
A suit is In progress in Kern County
to quiet title to leased oil lands. The
parties are the East Puenta OH Company
as plaintiff and the Zaca Oil Company as
defendant. The Bakersfield Californian
reports the facts concerning the contro
versy as follows:
Accordins to the complaint the plaintiff
leased the property in question . from the Wil
son Oil ComDany of Los Angeles for a period
of twenty years on January 11; 1901. Four
days later the plaintiff leased the property to
the defendant with the understanding; accord-
Ing to the comalalnt. that work should . com
mence within forty-flve days and that one
well should be finished -within ninety days and
a second well ba completed by July 15 last.
It is claimed that the defendant company
claims to hold an interest to the land, but
that it forfeited its rights to develoo the
property longer, as the terms of the agreement
have not been lived up to for the reason that
but one well was finished and that for the
past two months no work has been done at
all by the defendant company.
More wells were drilled in the Pennsyl
vania and Trenton rock oil fields last year
than during anv preceding twelve months.
The official records show the total number
was 14,583, a gain of 1315 wells over 1899.
Of the new wells drilled In the two fields
11,761 were productive and 2822 were
ejther dry or did not produce enough oil
to be profitable.

mule back to Umatilla. before there was
any railroad in the vicinity of the mine.
From Umatilla the ore was shipped to
Portland, and thence to San Francisco. In
later years the ore went to Denver and
Omaha at a profit. About a year ago
the property was bonded to Er F. War

viewing the case, said. in part: "The court
is thoroughly satisfied In. the face of the

this Mefendant. He should either have

In the meantime the relations between
Colonel Reed ' and Consul Coney are
strained, and the Hidalgo Club intends
taking action against, the latter. -, ; ,
years ago. SheHias lived twelve years in
Mexico, and pledges her word as a Valen
cia that her husband is all that he claims
he is. She states that Consul Coney has
made mistakes before and never had the
courage to admit his errors. She says this
is one of his numerous "bad breaks," and
now charges him with prejudice and bias.
The lady believes he "has cut. his own
throat" and will shortly be removed as

DES - MOINES, Iowa. Aug. 17.â Mrs.

weeks ago, in which she and her husband
were severely injured. â¢ ' '

We think that this matter will appeal to you
as being a Just one without going Into the
merits of the same.
It has been called to the attention of the
Grand Jury that an amendment should be made
to the charter providing for progressive pay
ments belnfr made to contractors Â¦who have
secured public contracts. Understanding that
one of the committees of your board has under
consideration certain amendments' to be ' sub
mitted to the people we would respectfully ask
that you kindly, take Into consideration the
above complaint and arrange to have an
amendment inserted lr. the charter providing
for the progressive payments referred to.
The Grand Jury sent a communication
yesterday to the Supervisors with a re
quest that the charter be amended so as
to permit progress payments on public
contracts/ This defect in the charter was
pointed out in an article recently pub
lished in this paper. The communication
says: jj â¢

Colonel Reed's wife is a Valencia. She
was reared In this city and was united
in marriage with her husband fourteen
Despite the Consul's charges it seems to
be a case of mistaken identity. Colonel
Reed claims he never visited the office of
Mr. Coney, never saw him and does not
know the gentleman. He says he never
was compelled to borrow money and never
asked a loan of Mr. Coney. He Is an arch
itect and Has 'lone considerable work for
the Mexican Government. He h^s been
'in this city for the last nine months with
his wife and children. He is now presi
dent of the Hidalgo Society, a prominent
organizatio'n or ' this city, and he claims
that the Consul makes these charges
through jealousy. Colonel Reed calls at
tention to the fact that on September 15
the Hidalgo Club celebrates the anniver
sary of the in-.lependtnce of Mexico, and
on the following day Consul Coney's so^
ciety will celebrate the event. As both
gentlemen have been chosen "presidents
of the day" by their respective organiza
tions, and as these celebrations connect in
a way, the feeling between the two gen
tlemen is strained.
The charge made by the Consults based
on a dispatch he received from General
Reyas, Minister of War, In which it was
stated that no such name as Reed or
Rayed appears on the roster of the army.
Consul Coney stated yesterday he was
led to make inquiries Into the matter by
reason of Colonel Reed having visited his
office some months ago and attempting to
borrow $5. The request for such a small
loan aroused a feeling of suspicion in the
breast of the Consul. He thought that a
colonel would surely 'ask for a much
larger sum and stand as much chance of
getting It. He said that Colonel Reed was
a wanderer from his country and a wan
derer from the truth.
charging that Colonel Juan
Guillermo Reed, president of, the Hidalgo
Club, is not and never was an officer in
the Mexican army. Colonel Reed's friends
ascribe this charge to jealousy on the
part of the Consul.

Acting on the hint contained in the res
olution the board delegated Director
Mark to arrange for the installation of
the playground, and the lease of the prop
erty mentioned followed. Of the appro
priation the sum of $2000 will be used to
pay for the fir3t ten months' rent arid $10,
000 for the laying out of the grounds and
the purchase of a suitable equipment. The
latter will include the apparatus to be
found in all well regulated outdoor gym
nasiums, such as a cinder path, handball
alleys, etc. , The details of the work will
be under the. direct supervision of Physi
cal Director Magnus,- who will begin op
erations at once. -
Whereas, This board appropriated the sum
of twelve thousand dollars in the budget for
the fiscal year 1901-1902 for the establishment
and maintenance of a playground south of
Market street and east of Tenth, for physical
culture; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Board of Education be
and It Is hereby requested to immediately take
such action as may be necessary In order to
carry out the Intention of. this board to estab
lish and maintain said playground.
This action on the part of the School
Board has been long delayed, and was not
taken until the Board of Supervisors had
adopted a pointed resolution directing the_
first named body to take steps to comply
with the terms of the tax budget last
June. The Supervisors at that time ap-^
propriated the sum of $12,000 for' the es
tablishment of a playground in. a district
where It. is sorely needed. The School Di
rectors were disinclined to install the
playground,. > and at , an ; open Â¦ meeting ; of
the Supervisors two of the directors re
fused to answer a direct Question put by
Supervisor Braunhart as to whether the
money appropriated would be used to' es
tablish the playground. They gave as a
reason that they could not answer for
their colleagues. ' As the days went by
and no apparent move was made by the
Board of Education to proceed with the
work the fallowing resolution was adopt
ed on July 22 to remind it of its plain
duty: Â¦â¢â¢ . ' '
The Board . of Education yesterday
closed out "a lease for the lot at Harrison
and Seventh streets from J. Enright of
San Jose for the purpose of establishing
a children's playground In the district
south of Marke.t street. The lot is 275x275
teet in 'area and the rental agreed upon
Is 12400 per year. The lease is to run for
one year, with the option of a renewal for
four years at the same figure.

Robertson is having trouble with his
rafts agrain. Every year he attempts to
tow two or more to this port and once In
a while succeeds. Almost every beach
from San Diego to Flattery has received
a consignment from his ventures, but
nex-ertheless his backers assert that the
mail proportions that finally reached San
Francisco more than paid expenses. This
vear Mr. Robertson built his venture at
Vrestport. and the local paper has this to
say about It:
"The big log raft built by the Robert
eon Company at Wcstport is aground on
the bar between the slough and the river
channel. The departure of the raft for
Ban Francisco has been Indefinitely de
layed by the accident, and it is probable
that considerable dredging will be neces
sary to float it. The two towing tugs
â¢were unable to get the raft off and as the
river is falline the situation will be se
rious."

< .^^, '.
FOR CAMPIN6.
People going into camp should not
t oreet to take along a goodly supply of
Grape-Nuts, the ready-cooked food.
This can be eaten dry and does not re-
quire any preparation by the cook, or the
food can be made Into a variety of de-
lightful dishes, such as puddings, etc.
One of the favorite methods by old
timers is to drop three or four heaping
teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts Into a cap of
coffee. The Grape-ICuts add a peculiar
and delicious flavor to the coffee and give
one a more piquant article of food than
Â«ven the famous doughnuts and coffee of
old New England. . \
People who cannot digest coffee should
not forget that Postum Food Coffee, if
properly made, furnishes a very delicious
beverage, either hot or cold, closely, ap-
proaching the flavor of the mild and de-
licious trades of Java.

A concerted effort was made yesterday
by the .coal men to unload the colliers in

considerable headway was made. Full

in getting ashore a considerable quantity
of fuel. The* discharging of the collier
Tellus was completed yesterday afternoon
and at 6 p. m. she was hauled out into the
stream to make room for the Bristol,
which has been tied up in the stream for
several days. The gang that unloaded

been decided upon.
A phase of the strike which has not
hitherto been thought of was brought to
the attention of the merchants and labor
leaders last night by the arrival In the

The trial of Policeman O. H. Knieht on
the charge of battery upon James Maddi
son, marine engineer, on East street last
Monday, was concluded before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday and the Judge
Miller, while unable to give the location
of the restaurant, is positive that it is
opposite "where the boats land." He de
scribes the robber who pointed the revol
ver at ' him as being about 30 years of
age, and weighing about 160 pounds. . He
was roughly clad and had several weeks'
growth of beard on his face. The other
was younger and had the appearance of
being a laborer. He is satisfied that he
can identify them in case they are ar
rested.
After wandering about for some time
Miller met a special policeman, who took
him to police headquarters, where he told
the story of the robbery to Captain Sey
mour.
Scarcely had he sat down at a table
when one of the men drew a revolver and
threatened to blow his head' off if he made
an outcry. The other robber then struck
him on the head with a blunt instru
ment, and as he fell to the floor the bold
crooks quickly searched his pockets, tak
ing his money and watch. Miller says the
proprietor of the restaurant made no at
tempt to prevent the robbery, but ordered
him to leave as soon as his despoilers dis
appeared.
Fred Miller, a well-dressed, middle-aged
man, was held up by two men in a res
taurant on East street last night and rob
bed of ?240 and a gold watch and chain.
Miller arrived on last evening's overland
train from the East, and as he reached
the ferry he was met by the two men,
one of whom pretended to know Â¦ him.
After a short conversation he was taken
to a restaurant, the exact location of
which Miller is not able to give, and in
vited to have something to eat.

was in attendance upon. Lynch, had in

set in he would be all right in three or
four days. Not satisfied with that, the
captain sent Detective Reynolds to ob
tain a certificate and he returned with
the following: .

shot in the hip on the morning of July 30

.yesterday 'morning. to find the two colored
men, Ruscb. Horn and William Ferguson,
who were out on $500 bail each, and bring
theni. in. .The officers found the two men
at work on the Broadway dock and they
were taken before Judge Conlan. Assist
ant Warrant Clerk Greeley told the Judge
that he had been notified Friday after
noon that Lynch was dying at the hospi

to make, as he said he did not believe' he
was going to die. Greeley said the doctors

Retail Merchants Wifl-Hold Afternoon at IS^tive
Sons' Hall to Consider Means of Restoring the Interrupted
, Industrial Activity of the Gty* _.
Â¦ It Is understood that nearly all the mer
chants appointed by Mr. Kenney on the
committee which is to begin operations
to-day have signified their willingness to
serve. The committee consists ;of live
gentlemen from each branch of the retail
trade and all are well known in their in
dividual lines.
Dear Sir: You are cordially invited to attend
a meeting to be held on Sunday, August 18, at
the Native Sons' Hall,'^ Mason street, at 2
o'clock sharp, of the Retailers' Association. Ob
ject of this meeting is to bring about industrial
activity. You have been appointed on the com
mittee of five of your particular branch of-re
tail trade. ' I would further urgently request
that you or a representative of your firm be
present at this important meeting. j| None but
retail tradesmen admitted. Yours respectfully,
. RETAIL. TRADES ASSOCIATION,
.W. 1. KENNEY, Chairman.
The arrangements for holding a meet
ing of retail merchants at" Native Sons'
Hall this afternoon are completed. Chair
man W. I. Kenney. has issued the follow
ing call for the meeting:
. An admission of this kind was prac
tically made by Attorney Michael yester
day when he said that every day that
passed brought the 'end nearer. His mild
communication to the committee of one
hundred declining a conference at the
present time on the ground of inadvisabU
ity appears to members of the committee
to have but one Interpretation, namely,
that at a more propitious period the as
sociation would be willing. to. recede from
the stand It took on August; 2. That the
period alluded to is almost at. hand, seams
the generally accepted- conclusion. â¢Â¦â¢ ,
Attorney Rothschild of the committee of
one hundred said yesterday that there
Â¦were no new developments in the matter
of his negotiations with the employers for
a settlement of the strike. He admitted
that events were shaping -themselves in, a
manner highly satisfactory to him and to
all who are interested- in seeing, the con
troversy closed as speedily as -possible.
He expected that developments would be
such by to-morrow as to make it possible
to predict the outcome. Attorney Roths
child declined to explain the nature of
the information in his possession on the
ground that he was pledged to secrecy in
the matter. â¢ â¢ Â¦ ,.j ,-
announcement by The Call yes
terday that information of importance
was being withheld by members of the
committee of one hundred as well as At
torney Michael of the Employers' Asso
ciation was generally accepted as mean
ing: that the end of the controversy was
in sight.
THAT the strike la nearlng the end
seems to be the belief of those
who are conversant with the af-'
fairs of the past two weeks. The

has heretofore prevailed. A proposition to
levy a special assessment for label agita

cluding the testimony of non-union print
ers when a union man is on trial was
carried.

When the echo of the last "Amen" died
out there was silence again. Then ;an
other signal. The Sir Knights rose to
their feet, turned to the." standard -and
with â¢ uplifted swords . raised their vvoices
in anthem to the flag they mean to carry
to -victory.- 'â¢ - - Â¦ . â¢
From beside; the reviewing -stand came
the sound of rustling skirts, and out Into
the! open floated a bevy of > "fair 'ladies."
There ,was a lady for each Sir, Knight and
1 There was no command this time. An
almost .imperceptible movement of the
captain's sword and every Knight dropped
to his knees, doffed his plumed head cov
ering and bent his head. Silence for a
moment and then : the sweet tones I of
strong, masculine voices blended in the
prayer of many centuries, ' "Our Father
which art in heaven." â¢
Bend Reverently in Prayer.
The Sir Knights, twenty-five of them,
had marched out into the open space and
passed in review before Eminent Com
mander Sir : Carroll Cook. A few sharp
orders, a few evolutions and the Knights
had gathered in crossllke formation
around the commandery flag.
- Beside the flag stood' Sir R. P. Hurlburt,
the captain of the little company. "In
ancient times," he said, "before knights
set forth on , pilgrimage it was the cus
tom to go down on bended knee and in
voke the protection of God Almighty. It
was also a privilege accorded the Sir
Knight of the olden day to take with him
on his quest some visible token of the
good will of some one fair woman, that
the sight of it might inspire strength in
his good right arm in time of peril and
keep fresh the remembrance of her to
whose service he was bound and - whose
confidence he must Justify even with his
life. Let us now," concluded the-com
mander, "endeavor to emulate the ex
ample of those that .have gone before
us." -v
The Mechanics' Pavilion has rarely . if
ever been the scene of a ceremony so im
pressive as that witnessed last night. A
large open space in the center of the hall
was lined on all sides with row after
row of brightly dressed women and well
attired men. The Sir Knights,. with flying
plumes, bejeweled capes and flashing
swords, lent an Old World light to the
occasion. There was the inspiration of
music and the marvel^ of the clockwork
like evolutions through which the sol
dierly Templars moved 'in response to the
short, sharp commands of their cool
headed captain. But overshadowing every
thing in its beauty and impressiveness
was the simple ceremony which preceded.
JF the brave men of the drill corps
of California Commandery No. 1,
Knights Templar, fail to bring the
silver and golden trophy from Louis
ville it will not be because they
lacked the inspiring' encouragement
of fair women.
When they reappeared, after an inter
val which was. taken' up. with. music and
a speech which General Barnes, should
have delivered, the contrast was startling.
Instead of the plumes and silver-spangled
capes of the first exhibition there was the
severe but neat fatigue uniform, small,
jaunty. "Tommy -tAtkins''-llke caps, and
dark, close-fitting blouses, relieved with
white stripes. . In' the .: fatigue uniform,
however, the Knights,; in spite of the fact
that the change < seemed to Â» bring th<:m
several centuries along. the 'road, of time,
looked more like business and gave their
friends the opportunity of seeing that it
was not the , "fine feathers", of Â¦ the â first
drill which- made it impressive and .'that
if sackcloth: had l been selected as the.ap
parel , for the second -; appearance â¢ the sol
diers would still have been every inch Sir
Knights. , ' - Â¦-*.'"
One of the' prettiest features of. the sec
ond drill was the sword exercise, at which
the Sir - Knights - are as; proficient â¢ as/ at
marching Â¦Â¦ and < counter-marching. Â¦ Then,
for .a finale, -Captain i Hurlburt had his
Knights drawn up in front of the review
ing stand, where they went through move
ment after movement with the regularity
of- clockwork,' Â¦ without 'ever a "" word'of
command. -V The â¢ drill, corps was then
marched - out of the ; open and . dismissed.
Dancing brought ' the evening toa close.'.' :
Â¦Â¦; General .Barnes was -.to .have 'delivered
an address, but failed to put in an appear-*
ance.'V Sir Knight 'Â¦ Dr. ,W. i E. Smith va s
asked to step into the -breach and 'he filled

Dr. Smith Delivers Address.
Â¦ In his introductory remarks Eminent
Commander Sir Carroll Cook spoke of the
hard work done by the drill corps In pre
paring for the coming competition. He
complimented them on their proficiency
and thanked them, for their efforts. He
wished them Godspeed on â¢ their Journey,
and expressed the hope that they would
return covered with the glory . their ef
forts merited. â¢ . Â¦ Â¦ .
There were two drills â one Jn full dress
and the second in fatigue uniform. - Each
was a gem in its way. Sir Knight Hurl
burt.-who officiated as drillmaster, was
thoroughly in touch with his little com
pany and every one. of; the twenty-four
Sir Knights 'responded with machine-like
regularity to the orders which moved
them in fours, in threes. In line, by sec
tions, in cross-shaped formations, and put
them through, evolution after evolution
without ever a: Jar or jumble or even a
sign of hesitancy. ' .. ; .
every lady bore a token for her particular
champion. When the ladies retired each
Sir Knight bore proudly over his heart
a blood red Roman cross and in the eye
of every soldier was a do-or-die look
which portends" trouble for the Sir
Knights they meet in the lists at Louis
ville. Then a sharp word of command
and the Sir Knights proceeded to show
their ladies, f ellov,- knights and friends
how well able they were to uphold the
honor of California Commandery No. 1,
Knights Templar.
barrassed at having to impersonate a real
general at such short notice, but would
do his best. He concluded by prophesying
the return to San Francisco of. the drill
corps with the Kentucky trophy in its
possession.

seemed surprised and anxiously inquired
how they got "next" to It. . as he ex
pressed it. ' .-Â¦.-,
"Let .the ' world* know me only as Rob
ert Stone. tl;e gentleman burglar, and I
will go to prison contented." he said.
Yesterday Detectives Dinan and Wren
located Thompson's room on Mission â¢
street, near Third, but found.no incrimin
ating evidence in it. .There. was a news
paper clipping, giving an, account of
Thompson's burglary of Mrs. A: B. Ham
mond's residence on Jackson street.: , >
Admits His Identity.
A few minutes later. Thompson unload
ed the revolver and taking out the car
tridges placed them in his pocket.
"I'm a desperate fellow," he Is said to
have remarked. "You want to look out
for me when I touch the trigger of my
gun." â¢
He then took fropi his pockets a pair
of brass knuckles and a bunch of skeleton
keys, and holding them over his head re
marked that he was a burglar.
"There is no house I can't enter," he
boastfully remarked. "I expect to get
some easy money in this town before
many days."
. Thinking that the fellow was jesting the
saloon-keeper and his friends paid little
attention to his remarks. - \
Thompson had a drink with the party,
and at the suggestion of Captain Nye the
dice were shaken to see who would pay
for a dinner for the crowd. Thompson
lost, and becoming angry he whipped out
a revolver and placing it in close prox
imity to Captain Nye's head threatened
to send him to the Morgue. Captain Nye
promptly grabbed the infuriated man and
prevented him from using the revolver.
He was then ordered to leave. ;
After leaving the vessel Thompson went
to a saloon kept by Captain Foley at 30
East street and bought several drinks.
Standing at the bar at the time were Cap
tain Foley, Captain Anderson and Captain
R. W. Nye, who is here promoting the
industry of pearl fishing in South
America,
According to the story of the audacious
house-breaker he came to this city several
months ago, and, finding himself without
funds, determined on a career of crime.
After committing several unusually bold
burglaries he went to Seattle and soon
squandered the proceeds of his daring
crimes at the gaming table. Suspecting
that the police of Seattle were shadowing
him he engaged as a fireman on a steamer
bound for this city, arriving here last
Monday.
Shows Vicious Temper.
. Herbert Thompson is the true name of
the "gentleman" burglar, who was cap
tured Wednesday night by Special Officer
Helbush. His home is in Baltimore. Re
cording to the information received by the
police last night his father is one of the
best known pilots in the State of Mary
land. In order to keep his disgrace from
his folks Thompson gave the fictitious
name of Robert Stone when he was taken
into custody.

The hot weather in the East and the
cool weather in San Francisco in the sum

advertising and brought to the attention
of Eastern people to a greater extent than
ever before, with the result, that .there
were a number' of trainloads of pleasure
seekers pure and simple that came West
at the time of the Epworth League con

A representative of the passenger de
partment of the Southern Pacific said yes
terday in speaking of these low rates that
while they were made primarily for the
accommodation of attendants upon the
conventions, yet. an equally important ob
ject was that of v the company to. create a
large, summer. resort travel to California.
; California roads have been very success
ful; in securing through rates from the
East 1 for the various conventions, and
have done a great deal of work to secure
these conventions for California. Tickets
have been sold this year at less than half
rates for the Epworth League convention,
held in July, and will be sold for The Epis
copal convention, that meets October 2.

The agitation over the scalping of spe
cial rate tickets for conventions and the
colonist rates that have, recently been put
in effect by the transcontinental railroads
has created a great deal of public inter

Papers Filed in a Maryland Court

BALTIMORE. Aug. 17.-The details cf
an alleged attempt to swindle banks on a
large scale by means of fraudulent cor
porations and fictitious notes is told in a
petition filed to-day in the Baltimore
County Circuit Court at Towson for a re
ceiver for the Manor Lumber Company
of that town. The amount involved, ac
cording to the petition, is over $1,000,000,
and it is asserted that the scheme nas
been at least partially successful
It is alleged that the Manor Company
was not incorporated for the purpose of
doing a legitimate business, but formed
by Charles E. Corkran as a part of a
scheme for alleged swindling.
Corkran. being already interested in
some legitimate companies, wished It la
alleged, to increase the credit of these
companies with the banks of the country
for the purpose of "kiting" negotiable
paper through them. He organized from
eighteen to twenty-one smaller companies
t is alleged, ostensibly engaged in the
lumber business, from which he would on
demand receive from $1000 to $3000 in ne
gotiable paper, â¢ payable to the" order of
any of the parent companies needing It
This paper was discounted In enormous
quantities, the bill alleges, at various

Several of the interior newspapers ac
cept the result o& the recent primary elf c
tion in this city as a victory for Govemo-
Gage. There is no doubt that deputies
nnd others on the State payroll joined
Martin Kelly and Sam Rainey in the fight
against the Republican Primary League
It is a matter, of record that the league
polled 8000 votes. Another election is to
taks place in November and these SOitO
toother with many other Republicans'
"<*>Kv vote. Time may demonstrate the fact
to Republicans of the interior that the
fctate Central Committee made a great
mistake In intervening Â¦ in the San Fran
cisco local fight and indorsing Martin
Kelly & county committee.
The Democrats are taking more I than
passing notice of the coming contest for
Governor. The Democratic list of aspi
rants embraces the names of Charles D-
Lane of Calaveras, Mayor Snyder of Loa
Angeles, Ed E. Leake of Yolo. W. T. Jeter
cf Santa Cruz. Washington Dodge of San
Francisco. Bernard D. Murphy of Santa
Clara and James H. Budd of San Joaquin.
Ex-Governor Budd asserts that he is
not an aspirant for the office arrd would
not accept the commission if it were ten
dered to him. â¢ ,VÂ« '-,â¢"
Some Democratic Aspirants.
H. G. W. Dinkelspiel of the Forty-first
and T. P. Riordan of the Forty-second
District are candidates for the distinction
of presiding over the convention. Herrin
is inclined to favor Dinkelspiel and Kelly
is partial to Riordan. "Whiskers" Smith
Is sounding the praises of Charles Lau
meister for Mayor. A strong effort is be
ing made to induce Henry J. Crocker to
enter the race for Mayor.
In the campaign preceding the primary
election John Lackmann cleverly plaved
both ends against the middle and is said
to be slated for renomination for Sheriff
It is suggested that the largest hall lri
the city be engaged for the convention
as nearly all the voters of<Â«he Twenty
eighth and Twenty-ninth districts want
to hear Martin Kelly's great speech. It
is said that the orator intends to roast
the newspapers, indorse the State admin
istration and invite Herrin and Lynch to
join him in a crusade for pure politics
The list of Republican aspirants for the
gubernatorial nomination is- growing
larger by degrees. Harold Power of
Placer is the latest addition to the galaxy
â¢V' the aspiring. Dr. George C. Pardce's
avowed candidacy is causing a deal of
comment in the interior press. It was
supposed until recently that Pardee woul.1
stand by and pee Gage. Flint and Davis
fight for the Alameda delegation. His de
termination to enter the race on his own
account will cause a stormy campaign in
Alameda County. It is said that Gover
nor Gage has strong hopes of winning the
delegation in that county.
Tnomas Flint Jr. Is making frlerds
throughout the State. He is not mixing
up in local contests. Railroad CommiF-
Fioner E. B. Edson and Controller E. P.
Colgan have supporters in Northern Cal
ifornia. Lieutenant Governor Neff will
not listen to suggestions that he enter the
race for the gubernatorial prize, although
many of his friends advise him to go In.
Kelly's boesism represents the brutality
of politics. He stands for nearly every
thing that is debasing and degrading in
our political system. He sells nomina
tions and betrays his party. He knifed
M. M. Estee. Republican nominee for
Governor, to get even with Burns. He
did his work openly and waited in sight
of the public at the door of Governor
Budd's office for his reward. He made
an open fight against the Republican Pri
mary League ticket. He rallied or pur
chased a sufficient number of Democratic
votes to overcome the anti-boss Repub
lican strength, but his work was done in
the open. Two years ago the subsidized
,Phelan newspapers went into hysterics
âbecause Horace Davis consented* to an
with Martin Kelly. There was
â¢ a general shriek that Mr. Davis had for
feited public confidence by speaking to
Kelly, and therefore Phelan should be
elected. The same old odious Boss Kelly
is now the head of a delegation in the
convention, and the Phelan press is not
advising candidates of danger in speak
ing to him. Candidates are soliciting his
support. The story goes that he has con
eented to stand in and line up the labor-
Ing men for A. G. Fisk. the Examiner's
candidate for District Attorney.
Candidates for Chairman.
Martin Kelly is not an intermeddling
boss. He holds a commission to represent
the people of his district in the conven
tion. He derives the right to speak for
the people from the people. He did not
sneak under cover on the day of the pri
mary election and wait for the winners to
be announced before declaring which side
he was on. He went to the front and
downed the Republican Primary League
enti-boss ticket. Where was Herrin in
the f.ght? He dodged the Issue by keep
ing away from the polls. In the Forty
first District, where a little help would
have given a victory to Judge Dibble's
boss ticket. Herrin shirked.
Kelly's lieutenants assert that the old
Sacramento Senatorial touts did not win
a delegation at the primary last Tuesday.
John Lynch, who is claiming something
for the old machine, is characterized by
"Whiskers" as the biggest bunko steerer
that ever came down the pike. The war
of words in which Smith, Lynch, Conroy
and the underlings are engaged does not
disturb the serenity of the chief of the
allied bosses, the brazen-tongued and cop
per-lined orator, Martin Kelly. Herrin's
agents talk of reversing the roll of dele-
I prates and placing the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict at the tail end, so that Kelly may
be assigned to a seat in the rear of the
hall. The proposed scheme again exhibits
the clumsiness of Herrin, Lynch and Jere
Burke. They do not take into account the
fact that Kelly can be heard if not seen.
His lungs have been educated to meet the
conditions proposed. He is preparing and
rehearsing for the oratorical effort of his
life. In days of old he carried an ax to
break in doors and smash ballot boxes
when he fancied the tide of battle was
running against him. It stands xo reason
that he Â¦Rill not now tamely submit to a
programme of exclusion prepared by the
fat-witted bosses of the Southern Pacific.
Kelly's Eight to Be Heard. >
Crimmins, it Is said, is off on a "toot" cel

Bee that Herrin does not slip in and put

NETV TORK, Aug. 17.â The ShamrocS
II was floated out of the drydock to-day
and was taken to Tomkinsville. where
the finishing touches will be put on tha
racer. Before she left the dock she was
painted a light green above the waterline.
Sir Thomas Upton's people hope to havÂ©
the Shamrock II in readiness for a cruise
off the Hook on "Wednesday to greet her
owner when he comes In on the Teutonic,
due that day. Captain Sycamore, who
witnessed yesterday's race between tho
Constitution and thÂ© Columbia, when
asked to-day what he thought of these
two boats, remarked that they were so
much alike, that he did not care much
which one would be put against the
Shamrock II. He thought, however, that
the Constitution was a better finished
boat than the Columbia and that so far
as he could judge there was little differ
ence in the sailing qualities of the two
American yachts.
Both racers got a boisterous salute and
repeated cheers from the attendant fleet.
The last race In the Larchmont series
will be sailed on Monday. The two yachts
will then go to Oyster Bay for the Sea
wanhaka event3 Thursday and Saturday.
The New York Tacht Club race, which
was scheduled at Glen Cove for Wednes
day, has been called off.
The constitution had added forty sec
onds more to her lead. Both went about
on the port tack Immediately after round
ing and stood down the Long Island shore
for a long board. The Constitution, hav
ing a good lead, got out from under the
headlands and into the open bay and was
first to get the Increasing breeze. They
tacked around the mark and then stood
for the finish line. \
On this leg the Constitution had gained
twenty seconds more. Both broke out bal
loon jibs and spinnakers for the run 'In,
the wind having shifted a bit into the
south, at the same time coming lighter.
The wind was now about the best of
the day and was blowing well up to ten
knots. Both boats came over to the homo
mark off Larchmont on a broad reach,
with big Jib topsails and balloon staysails.
On this short leg of three miles the Con
stitution added only a second to her lead.
After rounding the buoy and starting;
over the course the second time the Con
stitution's men had trouble in sheeting
home the big reaching sail, which was
shaking in the wind for over a minute.
The wind still held and the two boats
ran to Jhe flrst mark, a six-mile leg. In
less than half an hour.
The Constitution covered tho six miles
in 43 seconds less than the Columbia. Aft
er rounding the Constitution made a short
tack inshore and came about on the
weather bow of the Columbia just as the
old boat luffed around the mark. Both
boats now stood down on a long starboard
tack toward the entrance of Hempstead
Bay. The Columbia was seen to be doing
better close hauled and when half way
down to the next mark went clean
through the Constitution's lee, romping
off with a good hard full. The Constitu
tion, however, pointed well up and ke^t
her windward position. Coming out into
the bay, the boat caught the fresh wind
first and added materially to her lead.
Both boats were able to make the second
mark with one Ion? and one short leg.
The Constitution rounded the second mark
1 minute 9 seconds ahead of the Columbia.
The race was sailed under conditions' s
that best suited the Constitutionâ a steady
eight-knot breeze and a smooth sea. It
was finished, in 3 hours 3 minutes, very
nearly a ten-knot gait, which was fast
time, considering the wind and the fact
that twelve miles of the course called for
windward work, although it was not a
dead beat. The Constitution gained on
her rival on every leg, doing best In
reaching-. It was a fair test of speed, as
the boats got the wind throughout and
there was little to choose in the handling.
It represents about what the new Consti
tution can do to the old Columbia under
the conditions which prevailed, and while
many yachtsmen who have followed the
boats are disappointed that the difference
between them was not greater quite as
many more are satisfied that the Consti
tution, before the trying out i3 over, will
have proved sufficient superiority to war
rant her selection as the cup defender.
The course chosen was a beam reach of
six miles, a beat of six miles witn a long
and short leg and a* broad reach of three
miles, twice around. The start was one
of the closest ever made by the two
yachts, as they got off only two second3
apart. The reach down to the first mark
was made In quick time and it was only
a fast steam yacht that could keep up the
pace.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 17.â Johnson was
knocked out of the box to-day and re
tired to the bench at the end of the fifth
inning. Hodson relieved him and held the
Senators down to four hits, three of which
were bunched In the ninth and resulted
in two runs. The entire game was one of
sharp fielding, seven double plays being
made." Dunleavy took Lohman's position
at the receiving end, the latter having a
finger nail torn off in yesterday's game.
Devereaux pitched for the home team and
did good Â¦work. Score:

Hickory Dick, another puppy, beat a
favorite. Rest Assured was quoted a* 5
to 3 choice, but lost a close race to him.
Naughty Girl resented the talent's action
in offering 5 to 1 against her, and beat
Spiteful, her opponent, by a clean score.
Rocker beat Kittleman at slight odds and
Talk to Me earned the decision from Bona
Fide a 5 to 3 favorite. When White Hat
and King Cotton went to the slips the
Curtis dog carried the best"wishes of the
knowing ones. Without reason the talent
had allowed themselves to pay 6 to 1 for
their choice, and the result showed their
poor Judgment. White Hat proved himself
the better dog and his victory was a
deserved one. BriRht Gold made a better
showing than he has since his debut here
and took the flag from Motto, who carried
the big end of the money at odds of 4 to
1. Crockett Hill beat Master Workman, a
2 to 1 choice. Considering his. recent per
formances the talent should have reversed
the price.
Likely winners In the second round are
Harlean Gladys, Ireland, For Glory,
America, Snapper Garrison, Sir Lawrence,

Cronin's Tralee Boy, a Futurity candi
date, was the first to set the wise ones
thinking. Liberator was the youngster's
opponent and was thought good enough to
run for the talent's coin against the Boy.
Two and a half to. one was the price, but
when the course was finished it looked
that the odds should ha.ve been reversed.
Liberator got away well from the slips,
but Tralee Boy drew out from.' behind,
passed him up the field, and, getting
possession, held his opponent away and
beat him pointless.
The run downs in the two events yester
day at Union Park resulted in a good
programme of sport. In the open stake
the short ender would show itself now and
then, but not often enough to break the
monotony for the piker. f
Better running: could not be asked for,
though throughout the day's 'doing there
was nothing of the sensational order. .

Following are the summaries :
The third race was also a dash for the
"bang-tails." The distance was six fur
longs with a handicap and the event was
open to four-year-olds and upward. Lou
Clieveden, J. L. Rector's chestnut mare,
sold as the favorite, the .bookies asking
odds of 4 to 5. The start was fair and at
the turn' it looked as if It might prove a
close . thing, but Pidalia, with Slocum in
the seat, finished without trouble in 1:15,
Lou Clieveden, Pongo and Whaleback
coming in in the. order named. ''Â¦
The fourth event on, the card, which
closed both the day and the meeting, was
a three-quarter mile handicap for the run
ners,-in which there were six. entries.
The books considered Miss M.O'ConneH's
chestnut gelding Boardman the most like
ly, with George Richardson's Gross as sec
ond choice. Their judgment proved good
in ' the first instance, Boardman finishing
first in 1:16, with Dr. Hart second.- >
The opening event of the day was a
local race and aroused much interest. It
was a contest for a purse offered by. the
Santa Rosa Driving Club and open to
both trotters and pacers. The betting was
lively, but Grace Brothers* "Ole, a son of
Silas Skinner and a full brother to Nick
Russell, who is just now showing up well
on the Eastern tracks, won the race in
three straight heats. Cock Robin, owned
by Frank D. McGregor, had many back
ers and Venus N, a local "phenom" that
once sold for $7 50 as a saddle horse and
afterward developed a speed of something
like 2:17 at-a pace, came in for a great
deal of comment. The mare was nervous,
however/having never appeared in a race
before, and did not show to the best ad
vantage.'. Â»There is no denying . the fact
that she has speed, but she needs work.,
The second event . was a ' three-quarter
mile dash for the runners. - . Gold Baron
failed to respond and the contest was be
tween Catherine Bravo, Blue Bell, â¢ Com
ing Event and Mountain Dew. Catherine
Bravo finished first in 1:14%, with Logue
in the saddle. Coming Event. Blue Bell
and Mountain Dew showing up in the or

SANTA ROSA," Aug. 17.â The week's
meeting of the Santa Rosa Racing Asso
ciation was brought to a close to-day with
a programme equal to that of any day of
the week. The attendance was good, but
the beating was slow. Preceding the card
three horses went- exhibition miles for
new marks. The Santa Rosa stock farm's
Fram set hers at 2:17*4. another of the
same stud, On Stanley, went in 2:17^4 and
R. P. M. Greeley's mare, Winnie "Wilkes,
set a pace of 2:23.

END OF SANTA
ROSA MEETING
Anyway, it's up to Jeff now, and . if be
is willing to fight here is the chanqe."
Ruhlin is in good physical shape as he
stands,- and probably not more than two
weeks of" hard work* would be necessary
to; put him In, fighting trim. His muscles
are hard and compact and there is little
or no fatty tissue to take off. "I will wait
until Â¦ Tuesday Â¦ next before: making any
plans for training," he said." "The sooner
the'flght comes the better, but as long as
I can get at him I, am satisfied. I'll be
ready to sign: the moment we meet next
Tuesday." â¢ " * '
Since Jeffries attained the championship
status he has developed a strong financial
sense. Strikes and lack of sporting ele
ment in a community affect him and his
manager with much dread. The races will
bring a number of prizefight patrons, and
tho absence of strikes will also be good
for the house. So Jeffries will dictate the
date of the fight and Ruhlin will agree.
Such Is the prerogative of champions.
The question of referee might cause
pome opposition on the part of the ctoib
under whose auspices the fight will take
place. The San Francisco Club has its
appointed referee for all contests â Jack
"Welch. But In a fight of this -magnitude
the managers are likely to waive any such
demands for their own referee and con
form to the choice of the principals,
which is George Siler. I The question .of
referee would not be of any moment to
the Twentieth Century Club, for it has no
ordained arbiter of fisticuffs. The choice,
of clubs lies between these two promoting
organizations, with the chances in favor
of the San Francisco Athletic. Both man
agers are willing to fight before Greggalns,
or Jim Kennedy. . . \
.Even though the date of the fight be set
as late as November or December, Ruhlin
will remain on the ground all the time,
and Jeffries will pass ' the weeks and

Mr. Morosco has been a sort of Santa
Claus for the West Oakland Home for
Children for ten years. When he came
to Oakland to" live he became interested
in that institution. He found it conducted
by ladies entirely, who were doing a most
worthy work with very little outside help.
So he began to take a very active inter
est in its affairs and every summer for
ten years he has taken the entire lot of
orphans out.. to his home and supplied
them with everything that they needed to
have a royal good time.
This morning Mr. Morosco sent half a
dozen six-horse 'buses to the home and
took 105 children out to his place. He had
provided pony rides and all kinds of
games for them and a jolly lunch was
given them -under the trees.- After the
lunch every one of the children was given
a bag that was filled to the brim with
good things, candy, cake,* fruit and nuts,
and the.bags were not very small.
Every year Mr. Morosco - furnishes the
entire home with a complete Thanksgiv
ing dinner and every Christmas he gives
them a Christmas tree with all kinds of
presents for the little ones. :Â¦
Among the adults who partook of Mr.
Morosco's hospitality' to-day and who
watched the children' enjoy their; out
ing were Mr. and Mrs. U. G. Bair, Mr.

The boys were caught at the corner of
Thirty-first and Grove streets this morn
ing at 3 o'clock by Special Policeman Jack
Robinson. Robinson noticed the boys
carrying a large advertising mirror be
tween them, and after watching them for
a while placed them under arrest and
sent them to the City Hall. They were
put on the small book and this afternoon
were booked as T. W. Rowland and B.
T. Mackey, both of which are assumed
names, and charged 'with larceny. They
were released upon $100 bonds given by A.
Jacobs and M. Coakley. -
The mirror that the boys were carrying
is a large plate-glass affair taken from
in front of J. L. Champlin's shoe store in
the Macdonough building. While the mir
ror probably cost considerable money as
an advertisement it was worthless to the
boys except as a trophy of their prowess
in stealing signs. The glass is said to
have, cost $35 to have made and an adver
tisement of Mr. ' Champlin's shoe business
is . ground into the glass.
The theft is said to be the result of the
fad that has grown up in Berkeley of
filling the rooms of the students with
stolen signs. The more difficult it is to
secure a sign the greater the prize. The
two students in question are furnishing
their rooms in the university town and
they wanted something that would eclipse
everything else in the stolen sign line in
Berkeley. They selected the Champlin
glass sign and came to Oakland last
night. After- midnight they went to work
and succeeded in unscrewing the sign
from the front of the building, and tak
ing it under their arms they, started to
walk to Berkeley with it. Special Robin
son spoiled their nearly successful game
The boys Intended to place it in their
rooms as an evidence of their superior
ability to steal signs, but "they will now
have to answer in court. The police be
lieve that they have solved the secret of
the -disappearance of hundreds of signs
that have been* stolen. from many places
of business in Oakland -in. the last few
years. > .
Just because two university students
carried the E university fad of stealing
signs to excess they are booked at the
City Prison for larceny and stand a good
chance, of having to pay a' right round
fine.

As the School Directors have provided
for the expenditure of the money in ac

agreed it was proper to give what was
asked. It is proposed to spend $65,000- Â«m
the high school building and the balance

Haight and Wilson schools.

I Marysville and one day surprised her
friends by announcing her marriage to
i Bert Sherwood, the divorced husband of
beautiful Miss Blethen.
The knowledge of Miss Ellis* wedding
to voung Sherwood was a great surprise
to her many friends. The lady was to
have been one of the bridesmaids at the
i wedding of Miss Eleanor Dimond and
I Paul Jarboe, but on the very day of the
! wedding Miss Dimond received a telegram
[from the lady in Marysvllle announcing
'her marriage to Sherwood and declaring
Now these friends of "the unhappy

shortly after the honeymoon days the
fair young wife left her husband's roof to

BEGINS FIGHT
FOR PROPERTY
The man refused to talk about himself.
He said that his name was Herbert Bond,
and' that he' had recently come from the
East and was living in San Francisco.
He dropped a few words that would indi
cate that he was the man who had done
all of the work in Oakland recently, and
there was found in his possession a purse
belonging to Mrs. Fletcher O. Haskill of
1042 Chester street. This purse was
missed yesterday afternoon after the "gas
man" had appeared there and made an
"inspection" of the gas fixtures.
President John A. Britton of the Oak
land Gas, Light and Heat Company is
pleased that the man has been captured,
for It Is unpleasant for his company to
have such- a scheme worked by a thief.
All of the regular gas inspectors of the
Oakland Company are uniformed.
Policemen soon began to arrive at the
house in patrol wagons, ..on trolley-cars,
on bicycles and - afoot.-: Chief itÂ«l ..Police
Hodgkins was right in the running him
self, and the men'were sent to scour the
neighborhood lrt a thoroughly systematic
manner.' â¢ They had an excellent descrip
tion, of the man, and in a few moments
Policeman Moore found a man answering
the Â¦; description i coming out of a house.
He declared himself to be a tea solicitor,
but was placed under arrest and taken to
the City Prison. .; ;-..-.. - â¢ :-.
Mrs. Hanford left him. in the. room while
she went to the back door, locked it and
then telephoned for the police, saying that
she "had the man in the . house. But the
"gas man"- began to suspect trouble. and
bowed himself out of the fronts door, al
though Mrs. Hanford tried to persuade
him to remain and complete- his inspec
tion. He was quite sure that the gas fix
tures, were all right, and disappeared
down the street. V > ; . â¢Â¦Â¦:.-â¢ ,
Burglar Smells a Rat.
This -morning the- "gas- man" appeared
at the residence of.J. M. Hanford, pay
master of the Southern Pacific Company,
at 1205 Peralta street, in West Oakland.
He explained that he had been sent to see
if there was a/ leak in the pipes, . and
wanted a stepla'dder and', monkeywrench
with which. to make a test in . the bed
room. The women in the house thought
that they had their man. .
But the trouble was tp locate the,illu
sive ''gas man." One day he would work
in one part of the, city, and thfe next day
in another. He had no system, and he
always worked in the daytime, and so the
fame of the "gas man"- went abroad and
housewives began to keep an eye out for
anybody who wanted to inspect gas fix
tures or read a meter.
Soon robberies began to be reported to
the police. All occurred in the daytime,
and the amount of plunder ranged as low.
as $5 and as high as $100. But the num
ber was what ..worried the police. They
came in at the rate of two and' three a
day. j The first definite clew came from
the robbery of the. residence of J. P.
Edoff, 913 Grove street. There it was dis
covered that the articles taken had disap
peared Just after an "inspector" from the
gas company had visited the house to in
spect-the gas fixtures. Chief of Police
Hodgkins at once detected the work of a
bogus gas inspector, and his theory proved
correct. â¢â¢-â¢Â¦Â¦ - \
Police Are Worried.
The "Gas Man," as he has come to be
known in police circles, has been working
in Oakland for nearly a week. His plan
was not. particularly new= or, novel, but it
is the. first time that it has been worked
in Oakland and tlie young man made It
a very successful .source of income , "for
himself- and of terror for the women of
Oakland. He would appear at the \ home
of some well-to-do resident in broad day
light and announce that he was. a rep
resentative of the gas company and that
he had been sent to Inspect the gas flx
tureÂ§ of the ho^use. In nearly every case
he would be given full and free permission
to inspect the gas fixtures of the entire
house, and while he was making his bogus
inspection he would appropriate anything
of value that happened to be in sight. He
tried to secure money, but did not hesi
tate-to take jewelry and silver articles
where they, were not marked.
The"Gas Man" has been captured and
is in' jail, and â¢ once more" the ; housewives
of Oakland fc are breathing easily for the

still be able to draw on her "vast re
sources in Siberia., but matters have not
gone well there, though the figures have
not been finally issued. Moreover, the
bumper crops of Siberia avail little, for
Russia has no roads- but the railroads.
Of the hundreds of thousands who per
ished, directly or Indirectly from typhoid
and other epidemics, induced by starva
tion during previous famines, the great
majority were within a hundred or two

Quantities to the ports as to benefit the

LOXDOX, Aug. 17.â Advices from Mos
cow say Russia is on the eve of another
famine. Nearly a third of the provinces
of European Russia are officially declared
to have produced "insufficient," others
"sufficient" and some others still "under
the average" crop of cereals. Only two
provinces out of seventy have really good
harvests.
The official word "insufficient" means
Titter starvation. The famine stricken
area exceeds half a million square miles

In Missoula, Mont., one of our regular
stands, fully one-half of the audience Is
made up of. Indians. They come from, aa
far as two hundred miles on horseback
and even on foot, Btarting on their long
journeys days before the circus date and
arriving promptly on the morning of the
day of exhibition. On circus day it is a
case of every man for himself with the
Indians. The lord of the tepee brings
enough trinkets in the shape of mocca
sins and bows and arrows to peddle
around town, and in this way sets money
for his admission ticket. They generally
come In couples astride of a pony, and if
the market is overcrowded with Indian
relics they will sell the nag.
When the show trains arrive in these
%\ estern towns early ln the morning two
Â°F* t ? r 5 e hundred tents have already been
pitched by the Indians, some of whom
have arrived the night before. Their lit
tle colony Is almost as Interesting aa the'
circus itself. It is a veritable bazaar of
relics and pappoose exhibitions. While
Â£?,.? ld S( * uaws are eetting breakfast the
children are playing games and the chiefs
are taking their nicknacks to the market
;Â£ he> L. are Â» tu , e flr^ fc ones after tR e doors of
the big tents are opened to land on the
blue planks They H1I a good part of the
arena, and they never move during the
entire performance. Applause is unknown
to them. They make as little show of en
thusiasm as their brothers in wood In
Â«Â£"? Â°l tl l e TT hite man>s cl & ar store. If
the trick elephant were to climb the cen
ter poie they would no doubt enjoy the
performance, but they would make no
mo r? 5 h ? w ? f sur PrtJ?e than if they were
molded in clay. If the performing SulS
were to walk out on the hippodrome track
and make a concert announcement in the
Indian tongue they would only grunt
"After the show Is over the chiefs nro
ceed to fill their skins with the whUs
man's firewater, and the squaws with the
pappoosea wait on the lumber piles till
the grey streaks begin. to sprout over the
hills, when the unsteady train winds out
of town over the trail." s out
"You may talk about your city circus
goers," says Alf T, Ringling, one of the
proprietors of Ringling Broth ars' circus,
yesterday, "but the Indian has got them
all beaten to death. There's no circus
goer in the world like the North American
aborigine. He will travel farther, endure
more privations and skimp himself harder
to get the price of admission than any
other human being* in the world. What's
more, I believe he really enjoys the cir
cus more than the negro, though he
doesn't make any fuss about it. The
negro, as every circus man knows, will
sell the family cook stove to get money
to see the elephant, but, the Indian will
barter oft his papoose, his squaw or even
his most cherished possession, his horse,
to get a ticket. After the negro comes the
Chinaman. T"he Mexicans, too, ore not
slow in responding to the toot of the

Mr. Boas narrated his tale of woe yes
terday to United States District Attorney
Woodworth. He said that he had been
visited by a man In the uniform of a first
lieutenant of United States volunteers,
who presented for discount his salary de
mand for $120. being one month's nay from
July 1 to July 31 of this year. Trte lieu
tenant did not haggle over the terms;
he was willing, he eaid. that r Mr. Boas
should make a living, and he cheerfully
accepted what was offered for the sheet
of paper bearing his signature.
Mr. Boas took the paper to army head
quarters and experienced a violent attack
of heart disease on being informed that
Daniel Hyman, his customer, had. been
discharged from the army and that there
was nothing due him from" the Govern

SAYS SHE TRIED TO

Miss Hairies Says 'Mr/ Vail Is Very
Different From Her Other Gen
tlemen Friends. -
After Attorney Joseph C. Campbell had
put Government Expert Ames through a
course, of sprouts yesterday in United
States , Commissioner Heacock's court
Miss Alice Maud Harries, the Mill Valley
girl who caused the arrest of D. A. Vail
of Los Angeles, was recalled to the wit
ness stand. She repeated her testimony
of the previous day that she was positive
that he was the. writer of the indecent
letter received by her last Monday morn
ing. She had known him for four or five
years and had corresponded with him up
to a few months ago.
As to their social relations, she had been
only as a sister to him and had tried to
"make a man cf him," but had given up
the task as "a bad job.'' On being pressed
to explain wherein Mr. Vail was deficient
in manhood qualities Miss Harries replied
that he did not have enough "go" about
him; he was also different in his ways
from other gentlemen she had met, but
what this difference was she was unable
to describe. She had tried to get him to
be like her other gentlemen friends, but
had failed.
The witness reiterated her positive dec
laration that Vail, when he arrived from
Los Angeles last Sunday, asked her in a
very peculiar manner whether she had re
ceived his letter, and she replied that she
had not. Â¦ .
Judge Heacoek took the case under ad
visement until Monday. ; *'

done, thought an additional penalty
should be imposed for neglect in sprink
ling streets during the first week in July,
but Inspector Dutton was unable to pro
duce a list of the "blocks on which the
work had been unsatisfactory.
King explained that the Merchants' As
sociation had withdrawn all objections to
the carrying out of the street cleaning
contract. It was admitted that the sweep
ing was poorly done during the first week
in July on account of the inexperience of
the contractors, but a -great improvement
was noticeable in the latter, part of July.

OMAHA, Aug. 17.â The common mode
of disposing of property by a raffle has
brought Into the clutches of Uncle Sam
three of Nebraska's foremost citizens-
John R. Hays, ex-candidate for Congress;
Isaac Powers, ex-Attorney General, and
Dr. S. A. Baer, a well-known physician.
The trio has been arrested for attempt
ing to dispose of the auditorium at Nor
folk. Neb., by selling tickets at $1 each.
The raffle method has taken such hold
In the last few months that the Federal
authorities propose to make examples of
the present alleged offenders.
The raffle for which the drawing was
about to take place had been widely ad
vertised throughout the "West, photo
graphs and posters adorning places of
public resort. It was a public enterprise
and the names of the promoters gave it
standing. The sales reached such pro
portions that the scheme came to the
ears of the Washington authorities and a
special inspector was sent to Norfolk to
Investigate.
Following the Inspector's report the
Omaha Postofflce was Instructed to re
fuse the use of the mails for the further
ance of the enterprise, as it was a lot
tery and contrary to law. The incident
was considered closed until orders were
received by the District Attorney to bring
active proceeding? against the promoters.
The prosecution will* be conducted with
all vigor.
The Norfolk project is one of many ex
tensive raffles recently held In the "We3t.
The Pierce homestead at Sioux City was
thus disposed of and promoters of the
Kansas City auditorium adopted the same
plan. Many tickets were sold also for
the acaulrement of a ranch In Northwest
Nebraska, but no 'drawing ever took
place. ( Â« â¢Â¦.-'â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Attempt to Sell the Norfolk
Auditorium Nipped in
the Bud.
W. H. Noyes, vice president of the com
pany, was seen at his residence herÂ© to
night. He admitted that Hayden -was a
defaulter. He said Hayden had been with
the company five years, the last two
years in his late position. He was a
trusted employe and highly thought of.
NEW YORK, Aug. . 17.â It became
known to-night that the New York office
of Swift & Co., the. Chicago packers, had
been robbed of a considerable sum of
money by Its secretary and treasurer.
The local office is incorporated as a New-
York corporation, with a capital of $100,
000. Its secretary and treasurer was John
T. Hayden, 35 years old.
Following his usual custom, John Chap
lin, an auditor in the Chicago offices of
the company, came to this city last Mon
day to make an Inspection of the ac
counts. Hayden met Chaplin and turned
over the books to him. Tuesday Hayden
was at the office for a short time, but the
next day could not be found. Chaplin
continued in his work, and at present the
loss is variously estimated at from $10,000
to $50,000.

NEW TORK, Aug. 17.â Expectations of a
h gher money market caused a weak tone to
Â«ha stock market to-dcy, which was accen
tuated after the publication of the bank state
ment. Predictions as to further expansion In
loans were not borne out. the etatement on the
contrary ehowir.g a decrease In , thlÂ» Item of
Jl.C45.200. This .unexpected good showing, how
ever, was more than offset by a loss in cash
of J2.71S.O50, which was quite unexpected, aa
the estimates yesieriay figured on a gain of
nearly three-quarters of a million dollars.
Some uneasiness was also felt at the efforts
making to close various steel mills which
have continued in coeration sine? the strike
was declared, fersirtent selling of the United
States Steel stocks- which mads extreme de
cline* of % and J%, respectively, for the com
mon and preferred, stimulated bear selling at
other points. Prices yielded steadily from the
outset, especially for the Granger*, Pacifies,
local tractions. Sugar and Amalgamated
Copper, which were lowered from - 1 to 2
points. The Southern and anthracite and
bituminous coal roads also relapsed sharply.
In thÂ« final dealings trading â¢ was a ehade

DRIED FRUITS.
Evaporated apples, quiet" and : unchanged;
scarcely any inquiry. Demand bills were '
marked down to $4 S6\, but long sterling was
well held. . â¢ ' â¢
Early in the week consideration of the favor
able underlying conditions gradually eupplanted
the earlierdominant influence of the Government
crop report and steel strike, causing a higher and
broader market. These consisted of the large
volume of the general trade, excellent railroad
earnings, London buying and increased public
interest in the market. Monday's .market,
uhsn the crop report and the strike figured
to their largest extent, showed that these con
ditions were being rapidly discounted. The low
prices of the week were then recorded an-J the
I subsequent recovery, though irregular, car
, ned active stocks from 3 to 5 points . higher.
I Grain-carrying: roads, especially those tapping
Uie corn belt, were expected to be targets for
bear attacks when the week opened. But the
majority losses that followed aroused a be
, lief that the worst was over and the heavy
I demand for the short account that developed
| later colored this view. The failure of the
i general observance of the strike order and the
! euccessful operation of various plants caused
'predictions of Rti enrly collapse of the fcteel
! strike. The United States Eteel stocks were
I considerably etrengthened by thess assertions
and gradually reached a level three points
above last week. This improvement was
maintained until the late announcement was
made that the Joliet mills had shut down,
i This incident, combined with a general dis-
I position to take profits on the week's large
! advances, save a chili to the market in the
closing day?. Preceding this the waning effect
of the crop report and labor situation caused
a more cheerful tone, although the -speculation
retained much of its recent professional char
acter. Bear operators took frequent advan
tage of the rising prices to put out chert lines,
but as their efforts dislodged but little long
stock, they covered quickly and awaited a
more opportune time. These attacks became
less energetic after the early days and the
later extensive demand that arose was credited
to their evenln^-up. Commission houses re
ported an increase in outside orders, which,
though not large, indicated that public in
terest has been reawakened by the betterment
of conditions and advance in prices. London
was a heavy buyer throughout, the improved
I financial and political conditions abroad caus
ing a revived interest in American rails. I.ast
| month's severe decline in prices was generally
I attributed to an' important Western bear party,
and the substantial advances in the Grangers
and Pacific stocks is largely credited to cover-
I Ing by this interest.
Gt. Paul was the leading feature of the week,
1 talk of a possibility of an increase in the divi
dend causing active dealings and a rise of
10 points. Xothing definite developed to sup
port this rumor. Its influence on the mar
ket was very strengthening and the preferred
stock also made a large rise. General move
ments were not eo pronounced, but there were
large transactions in stocks which have not
recently been prominent, especially the ! trunk
lines, coalers and high-priced specialties.
Sugar, however, was hammered vigorously
early on the illness of the president of the
company and unfavorable trade conditions.
> The loss was more than maJeup later, but it
was very feverish. Money rates showed a dis
tinct hardening at the close and call and time
rates stiffened. Sterling exchange rates de
clined sharply, demand bills yielding to be
low $.4 87 on the London buying of stocks.
This setback effectually disposed of any fur
ther talk cf gold exports this season.' The re
corded exnorts of wheat this month, combined
with our balance thus far this year of $323.
000.C00 en international trade, makes the rut
look for large gold imports this winter very
reaFiTiring:.
Railroad bonds showed less improvement dur
ing the week than stocks, but there was more
general purchases of high-grade issues. : â¢ .

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Aug-. 17.â The statement of the
associated banks for the week ending to-day
shows:
Loans, $$84,810,300; decreasei $1,645,340.
Deposits. $564,529,200: decrease, $751,800.
Circulation, $29,039,000; decrease, $1,514,200.
Legal tenders, J77.86S.100; decrease, $1,334,600.
Specie, $181,711,100; decrease, $l,3S4,400.
Reserves. $259,574,200; decrease. $2,719,000.
Reserve required, $:il,157.3C0; decrease, $187,-
Surplus, J1S.421.900; decrease. $2,531,0o0.
The Financier says: The most striking feat
ure ot last week's statement was the slight
change in the loan item. There was a reduc
tion of $1,645,300, which was the more notable
because it followed more or less important In
creases in recent weeks. This reduction would
seem to indicate not only that there were no
negotiations of moment to call for large loans,
but that the banks, as a rule, have restricted
their discounts to current requirements and
have refrained from expansions amounting in
early demand for money for the crops. There
was a loss of $2,719,000 in cash divided equally
in specie and legal tenders. The cash was .in
fluerced last v.-eek chiefly by the subtreasury
operations. Early In the week payments by
this office were unusually large for transfers
to Manila and London and also for pensions
and for other purposes, but at the same time
receipts for" duties and interest - taxes were
heavy and afterward these receipts were suf
ficient to counterbalance ordinary disburse
ments, go that by the end of the bank week
the treasury receipts had exceeded payments,
so far as the banks were concerned, by about
$118,000. On Friday the assistant Treasurer
was debtor $1,339,683 at the clearing-house, so
that the cash return of the banks for the week
was made on rising averages. The interior
movement of cash, as shown by the prelimin
ary estimates, indicated some withdrawals of
money hence for the South, and the movement
apparently resulted in a net gain of about $1,-
OOO.O0Q. The bank statement, however, seemed
to show that there was a larger drain of money
dua to the interior movement than was calcu
lated upon in the above noted estimates. The
subtreasury operations during the week were
so distinctly traceable that it does not appear
; probable that the loss of cash resulted to any
great extent from such operations. The de
crease of only $751,800 in deposits is very, much
smaller than that which was called, for by
; the total loss' in cash and the reductions in
i loans, which total was $4,364,300. One feature
of the statement was the increase of $i,. r >i4,200
in circulation, 'which reflects the elimination
from the statement of national bank circula
tion, caused by the merger of the Bank of the
Republic with the First National. The sur-'
plus reserve was reduced $2,531,050 and it now
stands at $18,421,900. This may be regarded as
a sufficient, margin, in view of the fact that
the banks are now pursuing an extremely con
servative course in the matter of loans and

Under, the ruling publicity within the
meaning and' intent of the liber law of
Maryland J is sufficiently accomplished
when the objectionable matter is dictated
to the stenographer. The libel is "pub
lished" under such circumstances as fully
for legal purposes : as though it were
printed i in a newspaper," and published
broadcast. No. case presenting the same
facts ; appears 'to have been before the
courts of any other State for adjudication.
In view of the universal use of stenog
raphers-as confidential secretaries, it is
important that the decision should be
widely .published.â Pittsburg Dispatch. .
"Neither the prevalence of any business
customs or methods nor the pressure of
business which compels resort to sten
ographic'assistance can make that'legal
which, is illegal, nor make that innocent
which would otherwise be actionable.
Nor can the fact that the stenographer is
under contractual or moral obligation to
regard all his employer's communications

It Is the expectation of both Bradbury
and Chapman that the water -works -will
be r*Â»ady for operation Inside of two
months If all coes welL
Bradbury has a force of men grading
his newly acoulred pmoerty and another
force boring his well. Chanman. with pine
toners and wrench in, hand. Is rushiner Ms
part of the water-works svstem as rapidlv
as possible, forsaking the law for the
nonce to become a plumber.
."Well. Chapman has a pood reservoir"
upon the hill and I have what may be a
good well here, even if I have to go down
100 feet to get the water. I am going- to
bore a tunnel Into the .hill, so as to run
Into the well, and I told Chapman I'd
pump the water Into his reservoir if he
would give me all I needed. So we struck
a bareain and then I told Chapman that
If we had any water to spare we might as
well supply the town. So Chapman turns
to. gets a lot of pipe and meters and fix-
Ings and Is laying pipes to supply the
town as soon as we get jour water works
going.
"Oh. I forgot." he said; "she made me
put in a den for myself. Now what do
you think of that?"
"How about you water supply T'' was
asked him.
"We have a nice house in the city," said
the coming Corte Madera water magnate
"but my wife wanted a. little cabin in the
country- She first wanted a nice sitting
room and I laid one out about 20 by 21
feet. Then she thought it would be nice to
have a large halL So I put one in about
9:6 by 20 feet long. 'Now, Brad, dear.' she
eald, "I can't get along without three bed
rooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, dining
room and a servants' room.'- So I put
those In. Then she wanted the house fin
ished In hardwoods, paper between the
boardings and a whole !ot of other things
Why, when I got through I had a house
48 by 48, as big as two city lots: just think
of that for a country cabin!" and Brad
bury laughed loud and long as he thought
of his little cabin.
Another matter that is engrossing the
attention of Millionaire Bradbury is the
construction of a summer residence.
While Lawyer Chapman, in shirt sleeves
and overalls, is laying pipes, making con
nections and putting In meters. Millionaire
Bradbury has a variety of matters to oc
cupy his attention. He has a large force
of men engaged in boring a we'll big
â¢enough for a* fire department cistern in a
big city. .Although down but twelve feet,
water Is already seeping through the por
ous rock. This point is near the line of
the Chapman and Bradbury properties,
and the village Â¦wiseacres are debating the
<juestion as to what the result Â¦will be if
Bradbury digs his tunnel into Chapman's
property. They do not know perhaps of
the Bradbury-Chapman alliance.
Lawyer Busy Laying Pipe.
: Under the Bradbury-Chapman regime, a
rate of $2 per month, based on a meter
measurement of 4000 t gallons, will be
charged, with an additional charge of 50
cents for each 1000 gallons over and above
the 4PO0. Consnmers wishing a supply are
required to sign contracts for five years.
Two-Inch mains are now being laid
throughout the town and the Pixley dis
trict will be invaded- as soon as. fire
householders will agree . to take water
from the new company. - i>
Under the arrangements made by
householders who are supplied by Pixley
there is an understanding that during the
summer months care shall be exercised
In the use of Â¦water, for. although the sup
ply-is ample for all domestic purposes,
there is but little to waste. In order to
extend the supply further boring of tun
nels into the hills Is now under way, with
Indications of striking a copious supply
at an early date.
Chapman also took a hand in the mat
ter. Tunnels were driven Into other hills,
reservoirs constructed and pipe lines laid.
James McCue. another friend of Pixley.
also entered the water field and . supplied
a section entirely distinct from that sup
plied by young Pixley and Chapman. Ef
forts to increase the supply by boring ad
ditional tunnels into the hills were made,
and then Bradbury came upon the scene.
He purchased a large tract of land for a
summer residence and at once turned his
attention to a source of J water supply.
Chapman was not In a position to give
him all the water he thought he would
need, so an alliance , was made. Brad
bury agreed to sink a well, bore a tunnel
and DumD the Â¦water from his well into
Chapman's reservoirs upon the hill. Then
the idea suggested itself to Bradbury that
the system might be extended to all parts
fit the town, and Chapman and Bradbury
combined forces.
Corte Madera was always Frank PIx
ley's favorite resting place. In its vicin
age his widow and his eldest son reside.
Here, too, E. C. Chapman, at one time
associated with Pixley in the law busi
ness, maintains his domicile. Toung Pix
ley, who is managing the remnants of his
father's estate, bored tunnels into the
hills, piped the water into town and suc
ceeded In supplying about thirty families
with water at an average rate of $1 50 per
month.
One day Bradbury had some words with
a division superintendent about the ex
travagant use of water. The superintend
ent did not care much . for Bradbury nor
his water works eitherâ the engines took
water at other stations, the eating house
was moved away, and Bradbury's Pixley
water works were no longer of use.
But the water works spirit was still in
him. and he is now preparing to again en
gage in his favorite enterprise.
wTater Bates War May Follow.
His next venture In this line was the
building of the water works in Golden
Gate Park for a consideration of nearly
5?0.000. These works proved inadequate to
fcupply the park and have since been en
larged. Next he fell In with the late
Frark Pixley, and a town known as Pix
ley was started In Fresno County. Brad
bury again was to the fore with a propo
sition to supply the town with water. By
promise of free water to Southern Pacific
locomotives he Induced that company to
establish an eating house at the embryo
town. The price of town lots rose in
value, water was in demand and the wa
ter magnate and Pixley, the land owner,
were in a fair way to reap a golden har
vest.
Of course, every millionaire Is privileged
to enjoy his fad. Bradbury's is water
works. Some years ago he had two tanks
located on a let on California street, a
short distance above his present resi
dence, and supplied his neighbors with
water. He applied to the Board of Super
visors for permission to extend his mains.
Spring Valley stepped in and Bradbury
sold out, it Is said, for a consideration of
$15,000. Where the ugly red tanks stood
are now several handsome residences.
Millionaire W. B. Bradbury, of wafer
works, expectoration and elevator-running
fame, has found a new field for the dis
play of .his genius â In the construction of
water works. To the hill and plains that
mark the limits of Corte Madera, nest
ling under the foothills of grim Mount
Tamalpals, he has turned hts attention
ana with that ready discernment that
scents the far-off dollar he is laying his
plans to provide a copious supply of wa
ter, to be drawn from nature's reservoirs
In the surrounding hills and supply it at
bo much per 1000 gallons to the thirsty of
that village.
