2HAJOB. CABBXEBE DENIES
ACCUBACY OF INTERVIEW
Claims That He Has Been Misrepre
sented in. Connection With, the
Dreyfus Case.
PARIS, Dec. 5.â Major Carriere, who
vas prosecutor at the Rennes court-mar
tial of Captain Dreyfus and who has
lately been placed upon the retired list,
has written a letter to the morning papers
In which he characterizes as. unauthorized
an interview with himself published here
this â week. In this interview Major Car
riere was represented as saying he could
get no appointment from the Minister of
Justice, as the Ministry hated him for
urging the condemnation of Dreyfus, and
that General de Galllfet, who was Minis
ter of War at the time of the Rennes
court-martial, had denied that he (Car
riere) had orders to sum up in favor of
Dreyfus' innocence.
Major Carriere says he must have been
misunderstood, as it had not entered his
head that Gallifet had ordered him to con
clude in favor of the innocence of Drey
fus, and that he had never said so.

COURT FINDS
AGAINST HERD
OF SANTIAGO
Naval Men Say That the
Report Will Score
Schley.
Belief That the Admiral Is
Convicted on Five of the
Ten Counts.
Commander of 'Flying Squadron Crit
icized for Delay Off Cienfuegos,
Retrograde Movement and
Colon Affair.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Dec. 5.â The Washington
correspondent of the Inter Ocean tele
graphs his paper to-night as follows:
While the Schley court of Inquiry is not
expected to make Its report for a week or
ten days, It is understood that tha three
Admirals have practically concluded their
work, and the only delay is in the prepa
ration of the formal report.
The proceedings of the court have been
carefaly guarded from the time the pub
lic hearings were dosed, but there is a
well-founded and good-grounded report in
naval circles that the court ; has found
against Admiral Schley on at least five
counts.
>
Alleged Offenses Committed.
There are ten counts in the specifica
tions of the precept, and it Is impossible
to say on which of these the court finds
against Admiral Schley. Naval officers
who have followed closely the whole
course of the Inquiry believe that Schley
will be criticised for the delay of the
flying squadron off Cienfuegos; for his
misrepresentations of the reasons for re
turning to Key West; for his disobedience
of orders in making the. retrograde move
ment; for his failure to destroy the Co
lon, and for conduct unbecoming an offi
cer and gentleman in the Schley-Hodgson
controversy.
It is regarded' as possible that the court
may group several of these specifications
in the general criticism oa the conduct
of Admiral Schley; but that he will be
severely criticised there seems to be no
doubt.
Dewey Has a Blunt Way.
Members of the court practically made
up their minds In the last days of the
public hearings, and it is said Admiral
Dewey was ready to sign a report shortly
after the court began its executive ses
sions. The hero of Manila has a practical
and democratic way of going at puzzling
questions. He was ready to drop formal
ity and proceed to write a general report
upon the case.
Admirals Benham and Ramsey are,
however, greater sticklers for strict form
ality In such proceedings, and they de
sired to follow the rules of courts of in
quiry, go over the specifications and evi
dence upon each, and write their report
In accordance with this method. They
followed that rule In the executive ses
sions of the court and reached their find
ings. They are now preparing a formal
report and will have It ready to submit to
the Secretary of the Navy within a week
or ten days. It is possible that It may be
submitted to the President and made pub
lic from the White House instead of by
the Secretary of the^Navy.
DID HIS DUTY IN BATTLE
Court Will Find That Schley Is Not
Guilty of Cowardice.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N. W..
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 5.â Admiral
Dewey and his associates on the Schley
court of Inquiry are putting the finishing
touches upon then- 'findings. These find
ings are being closely guarded and will
not be made public until after their sub
mission to Secretary Long. The court
completed the rearrangement of the testi
mony of the various officers under each
specification of the precept ten days ago,
and has since been devoting Itself to tha
preparation of its conclusions.
In wen informed naval circles it Is be
lieved the court -will find Rear Admiral
Schley derelict in these particulars:
That he failed to promptly determina
whether or not the Spanish squadron was
In the harbor of Cienfuegos.
That he ordered the flying squadron to
proceed to Key West after arrival to
southward of Santiago without trying to
ascertain whether the Spanish squadron
was In that harbor.
That he disobeyed the department's In
structions- to proceed to Santiago to as
certain If the Spanish ships were there,
and not to permit them to leave without
a decisive action.
That he regarded the coap supply of the
ships under his command as Insufficient
to enable him to remain at Santiago,
when there was sufficient fuel for this
purpose. .
That he failed to deal fairly with Lieu
tenant Commander Hodgson In the fa
mous "Damn the Texas" colloquy.
Officials who believe Rear Admiral
Schley will be found derelict upon these
points are equally convinced that the
court will find:
That Rear Admiral Schley should not
be censured for the alleged slow voyage
made by the flying. squadron from Clen-

BOLDLY SCORES
FRENCH BUDGET
Deputy Ribot Declares
That Proposed Bill
Is Misleading.
Says Tbat the Government
Owes the Country the
Whole Trutt
PARIS, Dec. 5.â The last three sittings
of the Chamber of Deputies have been de
voted to a consideration of the budget.
The discussions on the whole were unin
teresting until to-day, when Alexandre
Ritat, Republican, made a slashing criti
cism of the bill.
M. Rlbot argued that he present budget
was higher by 259,000,000 francs than that
of 1SSS; that all the nations of Europe
were reducing expenses, and that France
must imitate their people, as she cannot
risk committing further faults. The only
way to assure the moral and material
strength of the nation, argued M. Ribot,
is to prevent the expenditures from excit
ing riots. M. Ribot criticized the attempts
to effect economy by abolishing the sugar
bounties and the appropriations for public
worship. He declared that most of the
economies proposed were more fictitious
than real; that the deficit at the end of
tb-i year would be 144,000,000 francs and
tbat the Government owed the country
th-j truth concerning the condition. of its
finances. >
M. Ribot's speech made a great impres
sion upon the Chamber and he received
an rvation when he concluded.

COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA FRUIT
GROWERS.
A special programme was arranged by
the ladies. "Hedge-Row Vineyard Ex
periment," a paper by Mrs. Lucy Hatch
j of Tulare, was read by Mrs. L. A. Ban
i croft of Contra Costa County. It gave a
I graphic account of the struggles of four
I women to undertake the management of
j a vineyard without previous experience.
A 6imllar paper was that sent by Mrs.
Harriet Strong of Whittier. entitled "Les
sons From My Ranch," which was read
by Mrs. John Dore of Fresno. The ranch
is on a historic spot in the San Gabriel
Valley.
I Experience in Fruit Sheds.
Mrs. B. E. Hutchlrison of Fowler was
| extremely witty in her description of her
: four years'* experience on, a ranch. She
| said:
. -I thought I would run the fruit cutting shed
each year and elected myself forelady. Back
; in Michigan, where we came from, they would
: call â  me forewoman. I was forelady for sev
: eral seasons, and all my help wanted to come
back to vs.
' Mrs. 'Hutchinson said she represented
the Oleander Woman's Study Club,
i "California Wild Flowers" was the sub
ject of the paper read by Mrs. Lucy E.
Weister of this city. It was a plea for
the preservation of all varieties of Cali
fornia flowers.
Mrs. Emma Fox of Lemoore told of
â¢ "Ranch Life in California," its hopes and
disappointments and the final crowning
of the efforts of the homeseeker at last.
Mrs. Emma Shatter Howard of Oakland
was assigned as her topic, "The Advance
ment of Women In Agricultural Pur
suits."
Mrs. W. E. Marden of Fowler read a
letter from Mrs. S. P. Reed of Los Gatos
detailing the trials of the family from the
time they landed in the State. Mrs. Mar
den supplemented the letter with an ac
count^of how the Woman's Club of Fow
ler had succeeded in beautifying that
town.
Mrs. Julia Shafter Howard, who man
ages 16,000 acres of land In Marin Coun
ty, mostly devoted to dairying, spoke in a
most entertaining manner- of her experi
ences.
"Making the Most of Our Fruit" was
the paper read by Mrs. W. N. Sherman.
On motion of W. H. Aiken the ladies
were tendered a vote of thanks for their
able papers. The Rev. Joe Waldrop of
Lytton, Sonoma County, added his con
gratulations and advice in a well-rounded
speech. \
Suggestions as to Marketing.
A. R. Sprague presented the following
report, which was adopted:- ;
Your committee to whom was referred the
state of the San Francisco and other coast
markets beg leave to report as follows:
In our opinion the present custom of selling
fruit nnd produce in these markets is waste
ful and unneceEsarily very expensive, especially
In the folio wine particulars:

iRWpPEPSIA
A CURB FOR IT.
Not a Patent Cure All, Nor a
Modern Miracle but Simply a
Rational Cure for Dyspepsia.
In these days of humbuggery and de-
ception, the manufacturers of patent med-
icines, as a rule, seem to think their med-
icines will not sell unless they claim that
it will cure every disease under the sun.'
And they never think of leaving out dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They are
sure to claim that their nostrum is abso-
lutely certain to cure every dyspeptic and
he need look no further. â¢ â 
In the face of these absurd claims, it is
refreshing to note that the proprietors of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have carefully
refrained from making undue claims or
false representations regarding the mer-
its of this most excellent remedy for. dys-
pepsia and stomach troubles. They make
but one claim for it, and that is that for
indigestion and. various stomach troubles
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is a radical
cure. They go no farther than this, and
any man or woman suffering from indi-
gestion, chronic or nervous dyspepsia,
1 who will give the remedy a trial will find
that nothing is claimed for It that the
facts 'will not fully sustain.
It is a modern discovery, composed of
harmless vegetable ingredients acceptable
to the weakest or most delicate stomach.
Its great success in curing stomach trou-
bles is due to the fact that the medical
properties are such that it will digest
whatever wholesome food is taken into
the stomach, no matter whether the stom-
ach is in good working order or not. It
rests the overworked organ and replen-
ishes the body, the blood, the nerves, cre-
ating a healthy appetite, gives refresh-
Ing sleep and the blessings which always
accompany a good digestion and proper
assimilation of food.
In using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets no
dieting is -required. Simply eat plenty of
wholesome food and .take these Tablets
at each meal, thus assisting and resting
the stomach, which rapidly regains its
proper digestive, power, when the Tablets
will be no lonser required. > -â â  â 
Nervous Dyspepsia is simply a condi-
tion In which some portion or portions of
the nervous system are not properly nour-
ished. Good digestion Invigorates the
nervous system 1 and every organ in the

his shipment will- meet, resulting often in
seriously overstockine the markets.
2. He has no assurance of fair treatment at
all times. .
3. The charges upon the product for freight
and drayage owing to shipment 'in small
amounts is a serious burden in excess of the
19 per cent brokerage, and added to this is the
careless loss of boxes which should be re
turned to the shipper.
4. The work of selling is now so compli
cated and conducted by such a multitude of
brokerage firms that it may perhaps be doubled
if these men can afford to do the work at
much less than the present rate, and to main
tain this,' which they say is but a living rate,
they have ' determined to co-operate and are
doing so most effectively.
Your committee . therefore sees no way by
which these evils can be remedied excerjt by
the co-operation of growers who ship to these
coast markets. Th'ey alone must control both
the distribution and sale of their products or
suffer the present evils. .
To this end we recommend:
1. That the growers form local associations
in their several localities for taking charge of
the assembling and shinment of produce de
signed for coast markets, to control as cheaply
as possible the total output ftt such places.
2. That these several local associations elect
representatives who shall form central or
ganizations to make such arrangements for
shipment and sale as the Interests of the pro
ducer may require.
We further recommend that a committee of
five be appointed by j this convention to pro
mote the formation of the above named or-

Chairman's Becommendations.
At the afternoon session the committee
appointed to " consider the recommenda
tions made by Chairman Ellwood Cooper
in his annual report presented the fol
lowing report and resolutions, which were
adopted without discussion: ; > -'
â¢ SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 5. 1901.
To the State Fruit Growers' Conventionâ
Gentlemen:- We, your committee, to whom 'was
referred the annual address of President Coop
er have had the address under consideration
and commend its careful perusal to the fruit
growers of California. ; 4 â 
We especially emphasize the suggestions re
garding the necessity of securing an appro
priation from the next Legislature for secur
ing parasites for Insect pests, for revising the
present horticultural quarantine laws of the
State and for pure food legislation, and would
recommend that these matters be referred to
the State Board of Horticulture for action.
President Cooper's reference to the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition Is timely, and we would
offer the following resolutions: â¢' â¢ *
Whereas, The preparations being made for
a World's Exposition to' be held In the city
of St. Louis in 1903. and â¢ ' >
Whereas. The preliminary arrangements and
financial backing give promise that . the said
exposition will be one of the greatest and
grandest in the world's history, and 7 ' :
ââ  Whereas, Past experience has demonstrated
that under wise, economical and experienced
management participation, by - California In
national and : international expositions has
proven profitable to the State; affording the
most effective means of presenting , our great
resources and unequaled advantages to the
Inquiring world; therefore, : be it
Resolved, That It 18 ' the sense of the fruit
growers of California In convention assembled
in San Francisco, December 6/ 1901.' that Cali
fornia should be adequately â  < represented â  at
the said St. Louis or - the Louisiana : Purchase
Exposition, and we earnestly invoke the united
aid of the counties, and of the * State, I and of
all enterprising men to this end.*; - . : ' . .
i We would suggest the I appointment of I the
following committee to carry out this purpose:
General N. : P. Chipman, - Bed Bluff, chair
man: F,' N. . Woods, San Jose; H. Welnstock.
Sacramento; A. H. Naftzger,' Los'. 'Angeles;

The preservation of forests has received atten
tion at the hands of the : president of this as
sociation â â  In his address, , and, we would sug
gest the adoption of the '. following resolution:
â Resolved, That our members 'in Congress be
requested to present -an act,- and labor for its
adoption, setting aside ' from settlement , for
homes all ' mountain lands unoccupied in '< the
State of California, and "restrict . the devasta
tion '. caused by .prospecting 'for minerals, and
mining purposes. '. , -:o .- â â â ;:
Reciprocity Treaties.
In the address of President; Cooper reference
is made to the . reciprocity .treaties, and â  we
would offer the following resolution . and ask
its adoption by this â  convention : - . * .
Whereas, i The Fifty-seventh -Congress is â¢ now
In session at Washington. D. T C., - and the law
makers of the land will shortly .-be called upon
to consider . and ratify , certain ; reciprocity con
ventions already entered into between : the
. United States of America and t certain f oreign
countries, and we now refer particularly to the
convention ,wlth France and Jamaica; ' and <r-i\- â¢â 
â  Whereas, The fruit growers of California and
the Pacific Coast firmly believe that the ratifl.
cation of these conventions will seriously injure
the fruit, nut and wine industry. on the Pacific
Coast. , and : that :; the , fruit, > nut â  and wine In-
dustry at large In this country will be placed
in jeopardy. and seriously impaired by the rati
fication of the convention for Jamaica, signed
July 22. 1899, which proposes a reduction in
the present tariff of 20 per cent on citrus fruits;
and further, the convention with the French
republic, signed July 24, 1899. which proposes
a reduction of duty of 20 per cent on nuts, 10
per cent on prunes, 15 per cent on olive oil and
a 10 per cent reduction on preserved fruits and
Vegetables; an( j . .
Whereas, Fruit growers of the Pacific Coast
look with alarm upon these unratifled conven
tions, fearing" their ratification in the near
future, in which event serious uncalled for
and unwarranted damage will - accrue to the
fruit, nut and wine industry, in which at the
present time millions of dollars are Invested;
now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the fruit growers of Cali
fornia, in convention assembled, do most re
spectfully but earnestly and emphatically pro
test against any and all reductions or changes
in the existing tariff rates between the United
States of America and the republic of France,
and the island of Jamaica, so far as they affect
fruits, nuts, olives, olive oil, wine, preserved
fruits and vegetables; and be. it further -
Resolved, That our Representatives in Con
gress be and are hereby respectfully petitioned
to use all honorable means at their command
to : discourage and prevent the ratification of
these conventions as at present outlined; and
be it further
Resolved. That these resolutions be engrossed
and the copy forwarded to each member of
the Pacific Coast delegation In Congress in
"Washington, D. C, requesting that this action
on the part of the fruit growers of the State
of California, in convention assembled, on this
5th day of December, 1901, and that the action
herein taken be made known to the honorable
President of these United States, members of
the United States Senate and House of Repre
sentatives. â  " . . - ' â  . '
Favor ; the Isthmian Canal.
We also ask the adoption of the following
resolution on the isthmian canal: â 
Resolved, That this State convention of the
California fruit f growers, in session at San
Francisco, this 5th day of December, 1901.
impressed with the utter inability of the trans
continental railroads to handle the ' enormous
and rapid increase in traffic between the East
and West, urge our Senators and Representa
tives in Congress the pressing need of adopting
the recommendations of the -. isthmian â¢ canal
commission and taking immediate steps for the
construction of the canal. -
Your committee would also advise the pas
sage of the following: .
Whereas. The priceless relic of an ancient
civilization known as , Cleopatra's needle, is
now disintegrating and going to destruction
In Central Park. New York, efforts should be
made at once' to secure Its removal to Cali
fornia, where its safe preservation '.for | the
ages to come , may Impart , the pleasure and

' A. H. NAFTZGER. Chairman.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
university. of California spoke on the im
portance of the work of the State Board
of ' Horticulture, saying In part* as fol

The ultra individualism which tolerated- and
even loved- the little rocky farms . of > New
Hampshire and Massachusetts, and spent its
toil. in building stone walls that served little
more purpose than stone heaps, has done 'its
work ' and lived its day, and a glorious day it
was. The old . New England farmer depended
for his information about what seed to put in
; and; what to ao with' what came up therefrom
chiefly upon the half mythical traditions of the
Farmers' Almanac. It* was a day of small
. things and narrow outlook. I These farms,' how
ever, : even if they ' did â  produce . small . crops,
and apples very rough and very sour, availed
to -. produce a type - of men r that . have , made
themselves felt In the conscience-power of this
whole land. ..'â â : : ..- .â¢-â  â¢"â â â ,â¢'â¢
.The old New England farmer did not look
to the State . to help him . in choosing his crops
or caring for them. Indeed there was very
little the 'State could have done for him, ex
cept to sap his ; manhood. Everybody knows
what the effect of subsidy ' Is and would be
under such conditions. â  There was very , little,
probably nothing the State could have done
for him. Agriculture and â¢ fruit growing were
practiced according to the rule of i thumb.'
Some slender ; traditions derived from. the. fore
fathers â some of them good, some of them bad
â served to make up a body of lore by which
those fine * old farmers conducted themselves
as farmers. In these later days men h have
come to see that the processes of farming and
fruit growing are just as : properly subjects of
scientific . research as any : of the phenomena
which swarm : about â  in . the universe. -'; The un
aided hand of the New England farmer in his
little farm could not. have maintained an agri
cultural - chemist .< or botanist, but â  when*: the
farmers put their heads together and their
hands, and interested the National Government
In encouraging and aiding study which should
take into account the necessities and oppor
tunities of all the farms put together, there
rapidly developed scientific knowledge which
could be ' readily adapted to the uses of the
men on the farms.
President Wheeler was followed by
President David Starr Jordan of Leland
Stanford Jr. University on "Selection â
Natural and Artificial." He said in part:
We have to utilize" the collected knowledge of
the world, whatever we are doing. Germany
has led the way in applying what' science has
discovered to the practical side of life.. The
German protection of forests has made the
name of Germany famous in the courts of for
estry the world over. Germany has " utilized
the scientific work of. the universities. For a
time we did not mind Germany in the markets
of the world. But within the last five years
she has been felt in the first-class markets of
the world. She Is beginning to push England
out. England has relied too much on solid ma
terials. She has trusted too long in amateurl
isms, in war, in diplomacy, commerce and
manufactures, and failed like Germany to util
ize all that science offers' in the way of expert
service. â¢ . â¢ . . â¢ - .

his labors. Embraced in the report is the
correspondence between himself and toe
freight managers of the railroads, through
T.-hich he secured valuable concessions for
growers and shippers. His correspond
ence with the manager of the refrigerator
lines, he said, looking to reductions in
these charges was not entirely satisfac
tory as yet, but he. hoped to secure re
ductions, before the season, opened. â¢
The concluding part of thfe report Is as

Question .of Transportation.
There can be no doubt that the improved
service given _to green deciduous fruit ship
ments this year by the Southern Pacific Com
pany and, Its connections was of great beneSt
to the fruit growers of California. â¢ The time
occupied in transit being materially reduced
greatly aided' distribution and by doing so in
creased its consumption. This has resulted in
restoring confidence In the minds of the grow
ers, who are again beginning to believe that
fruit growing in California, and upon a. much
larger scale than ever before, can be made to
pay a fair profit upon the labor and capital
invested, provided that the time " sched
ule agreed upon between the railroads
and the fruit growers, in May Jaat, will
be put into full force and effect by the rail
roads, the only, party to the agreement that has
the Dower to do so, and the elimination from
the business refrigerator cars that are owned
and controlled by private Interests. _" : :
"We believe that the private ownership and
control of refrigerator cars used for shipments
of California fruit to be inimical to tbe inter
ests of growers and shippers, as affording an
opportunity for discrimination and. favoritism.
â  All cars and other transportation facilities
should be owned and controlled in every par
ticular by the railroads, and all shippers
should have equal facilities and upon equal
terms. â¢ -
We, therefore, in this public- way record our
earnest protest against the renewal or exten
sion of existing contracts with the refrigerator
lines now engaged in this traffic, or the mak
ing of any similar -contracts with any parties
whatsoever.' -râ
We make further" objection to the private
ownership and control of these refrigerator
cars as having the effect to maintain what we
consider excessive refrigeration ' rates.
We feel that the Southern Pacific Company
and the other roads that are engaged in carry
ing California fruit are entitled to the thanks
of the fruit growers of the State for their ef
forts to give an Improved and adequate service
In the transporation of our fruit, and we there
fore suggest that a vote of thanks be tendered
them by this convention for what they have
already done in the way of an improved serv
ice, thus showing that the fruit growers of Cal
ifornia realize and fully appreciate what has
been done In their interests.
V/illlam . Sproule; general freight agent
of the Southern Pacific Company, briefly
addressed the convention . detailing the
difficulties encountered during the year by
reason of the strike and the rush of travel
during the Epworth League Convention.
He said the outlook for better service
next' year was excellent, as new engines
were constantly being adde to the equip
ment. . ; ...
General N. P. Chipman presented a
lengthy report of the committee on the
olive. It was exhaustive in its nature and
very important to the industry. A request
will be made -to the State Board of Trade
requesting its early publication and dis
tribution. He was followed by C. A.
W&shburn ' Of Los Angeles, who read a
paper on ."The Evils of Present Methods
in Selling the Olive and the Remedy.". .
A. G. McAdie of the Weather Bureau
read a paper on "Frost Fighting," in
which he recommended the, smudging pro
cess as the- most feasible one. '
F.. F. Adams of Santa Cruz, offered the
following resolution, which was referred
to the committee: .; â "â â¢â 
Resolved, That this convention directs public
attention to the Importance of speedy and
thorough revision of the water laws of the
State, and that we respectfully urge Congress
to recognize the vigor and ability with which
irrigation Interests are now promoted under
great disadvantages by the Department of
Agriculture by providing and equipping in that
department a full bureau of Irrigation or agri
cultural engineering:.
Dr. Gustav Eisen at the evening session
read a papertm the fig,- dealing particu
larly with the process of caprification. He
was followed by George C. Roeding, of
the Fancher Creek Nursery, near Fresno,
which is the only place in the United
States where the genuine Smyrna figs p.re
grown on a commercial basis. He gave
an interesting account of the difficulty at
tending the procuring of the necessary
insects for caprifying.
"The Orange In Southern California"
was the title of the paper read by J. "W.
Jeffery. The paper prepared by D. H.
Murry, "The Orange in Northern Cali
fornia,"was read by Prof essor .E. J. Wick
son. Hon. Alden Anderson of Suisun read
a paper on "The Almond." The final
paper was "The Future of the Walnut"

BEBEL'S SENSATIONAL

broke its didactic monotony to-day and
lifted the tariff debate to emotional levels.
Hcrr Bebel ppoke to breathless galleries.
He often provoked his opponents, but
sometimes he even enthralled them.
The wasjn-maker is diminutive in body
and has a large head. Pulling at his
pointed chin whiskers he took the tribune
after the peasant larmer, Herr Nissen,
and as the representative of 2,800,000 voters
he lodged the Sociahst protest against the
"hunder duties." as he called the tariffs
on grain. The man seemed to grow bodily
as he warmed up to his work. He spoke,
as always, with astonishing ease and ra
pidity oi utterance. His tuneful voice, in
stead of growing hoarser as the speech
was prolonged, on the contrary grew more
melodious. Herr Itebel said there were
two nations in the German state, "the
plunderers and the plundered."
"The Imperial Chancellor. Count von
Bulow. spoke for the former; I am
speaking for the latter. Fifteen per cent
of the German people are engaged In agri

qui-l, former Minister of Finance, in an
ottlcial declaration three years ago eaid
German agriculture was prosperous. The
Prussian crown knows it is prosperous,
because It is now Investing 3,000,000 marks
in new agricultural holdings. The reduc
tion of farm mortgage foreclosures of re
cent years showed that agriculture was
better off than previously and the value
of lands has increased during the last cen
tury. . Â«
"This bill is intended, not for the better
ment of the farm laborer, but for the bet
terment of the landlord. It any landlord
is not getting on well now it is because
of large hunting: parties, gambling; well
filled wine cellars, sons In crack cavalry
regiments and town houses In Berlin."
At this point In Herr Bebel's speech
Graf von Kardorff, one of the greatest
land magnates, laughed jeeringly.
"Yes," continued Herr Bebel. "That is
the -way with you fellows. You lay taxes
upon the poor and when it i3 proved to
you that they are unnecessary you laugh.
But the world's history rolls on over you
regardlessly."
Foments Insurrection.
Later Graf von Arnlm, another great
agrarian leader, scornfully Interrupted
Herr Bebel while the latter was relating
an incident of a Prussian schoolgirl who
wanted to go to heaven because there was
no hunger there. Upon this occurrence
the Socialist members of the Reichstag
rushed In | a body toward the Conserva
tive side of the chamber, shouting "Or
der!" Interruptions of all sorts were then
made. These showed the rising temper
of the house. The President of the Reich
stag frequently rang his bell .or called
'Herr Bebel and the other members of all
the political groups to order. Herr Bebel.
Inspired by the tempestuous temper of
the house, exclaimed:
"This bill foments Insurrection. The
Chancellor aims to overturn social order.
We shall do our utmost to send this bill to
Hades and we only regret we cannot send
Its authors and abettors there also."
Baron von Rhelnbaben, the Prussian
Minister of Finance, advised Her Bebel
that if the Social Democrats stirred up
rebellion the Government assured them
they would reap a harvest of broken
heads. This was greeted with cheers on
the Right and laughter on the Left. Herr
Moeller, the Minister of Commerce, said
he regarded the new tariff as an effective
weaoon in the hands of the Government
to force to a conclusion favorable com
mercial treaties. ! \ .;.' :

SENATORS TALK
ABOUT ANARCHY
McComas Says Impoten
cy of Federal Laws Is
Humiliating.
Hoar Advocates the Isolation
of All Followers of No-
Government, Doctrine.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S.-^enator Mc-
Comas of Maryland made "" an" extended
and carefully prepared speech in the Sen
ate to-day with anarchy as his theme,
and was followed by some brief remarks
by Hoar of Massachusetts on the difficul
ties in the way of dealing with anarchial
associations. The Senate passed a bill ex
tending the life of the Industrial Com
mission until February 15 next, to com
plete the work it now has in hand. 4
The announcement that Senator Mc-
Comas would inaugurate the discussion
on the suppression of anarchy and an
archists filled the Senate galleries with a
goodly number of- spectators. Before :he
routine business was taken up' Hale of
Maine secured the adoption of a resolu
tion that when the Senate adjourns to
day it be until next Monday. The heavy
Influx of petitions, bills, etc., continued,
much time being taken up in their formal
reception. -T. ' . ..:.-..-
Penrosa*(Pennsylvania) very favorably
reported jrom the Committee on Educa
tion and Labor the bill continuing the
Industrial Commission until February 15
in order that it may close up work now
in hand and secure immediate considera
tion for the measure. The bill was
passed. '- **
Senator McComas' Speech.
McComas was then recognized in sup
port of his bill introduced yesterday pro
viding the death penalty for assaults upon
the President or for inciting, advising or
procuring such assaults.
The Senator spoke of the dangerous
spread of anarchy. President Carnot,
Prime Minister Canovas, the Empress of
Austria, King Humbert and President
McKinley having been foully assas
sinated by anarchists within the last
sevn years. It was humiliating, ho
said, to consider the -. lmmpotency
of our federal laws to punish this
fearful crime. The Senator spoke of the
revolutionary propaganda under the guid
ing hand of Herr Most and the NiniliÂ«t
Hartmann and the formation since W88
of anarchist groups. Congress must now
legislate aginst this peril with courage,
firmness, conservatism and prudence. The
constitutional power of Congress to deal
with the subject was discussed at length
and supported by numerous references to
the Supreme Court decisions.
McComas further urged the exclusion
and deportation of anarchists, the amend
ment of the immigration and naturaliza
tion laws and the negotiation of treaties
with foreign powers permitting the extra
dition of those charged with anarchistic
offenses. In the course of his speech the
Senator argued that international comity
called for action on our part to suppress
the origin of plots in this country against
foreign rulers.
Would Isolate Anarchists.
At the conclusion of Senator McComas
remarks Hoar of " Massachusetts spoke
briefly along the same lines. He said
that while he heartily agreed with much
that had been said, yet the great diffi
culty in all these cases of assassination
was that the assassin was willing and
anxious to give up his life. Fear of death
did not in any way deter the assassin.
Such was the case with the assassin of
William of Orange, who welcomed the
torture inflicted upon him. Every assas
sin of a foreign ruler had expected early
and certain death. The multiplication of
punishment for the act itself, therefore,
would accomplish little. Much good
might be accomplished in limiting the
circulation â¢ of fanatical doctrines. But
the Senator believed that a much mow
effective remedy could be secured if by
common consent of all civilized nations
some tract of land somewhere upon tho
earth's surface, hemmed in from the
outer world, could be set aside for the
confinement of those who counseled the
killing of rulers or the overthrow of
governments.
"LÂ«et the anarchists have an object les
son." the Senator said, "and let the world
have an object lesson. Let there be a
little circulation of anarchy Into the an
archist himself, and lot him have nn an
archistic government amonjf his follow
ers."
Hoar said banishment would bo a
proper punishment under the constitu
tion, and If all nations would agree that
â¢very nuch person be sent to a spot where
there was no government it would be an
effective remedy. Certainly tho anarchist
could not complain, for In being trnnv
ported to a plnee of no Rovenunent he
would have realized his Eutopia.
McCnman' resolution was then laid
aclde for discussion later.
The presiding: officer announced the.
following Senators as the committee to
act with the committee from the Houses

frress may express Its deep senslbilttv at

A message was received from the Pres
ident responsive to the Senate resolution
transmitting the letters of Jefferson to

annexation of Cuba.
At 2:30 tho Senate went Into executive

DUTCH GO VERNMENT STRIVES
TO HUSH THE ROYAL SCANDAL
w , ONDON, Dec. 6.â The Dutch Government and the Dutch court are again strenuously denying the stories of
Eg . _ matrimonial quarrels between Queen Wilhelmina and the Prince Consort, but the scandal has become too pub-
O lie for. any hope of . hushing it up to- remain. According to some reports, a reconciliation between the Queen
H J. and Prince Henry, was effected largely through the influence of Emperor William and the Queen mother,
Aâ^ who, in order to preserve an appearance of concord, even paid the Prince Consort's debts.
The Dutch Ministers at foreign courts continue to aver that the couple live in "an Ideal happy union"
And "are devotedly attached to each other," etc. . ~ .<
- AMSTERDAM, Dec. 5.â With the view of allaying public indignation and excitement, semi-official intimations have
been circulated to the effect that Queen Wilhelmina has forgiven her husband, Prince Henry of The Netherlands, the^
suggestion ' being that the public ought to follow suit.
Since Prince Henry returned to Het-Loo the Queen and he have been dining together 'and gradually resuming
normal relations. Yesterday they walked together and afterward drove in the castle park. The relations between
Prince Henry and the members of the court are, however, very strained. The former cordiality has been replaced by
an attitude of frigid politeness on the part of the Prince Consort and apparently the gentlemen of the court are
equally indisposed to gloss over recent occurrences.
UNION WORKMEN MEET AND DISCUSS
MEASURES OF INTEREST TO LABOR
President Gompers Reviews the Recent Big Strikes and Favors
the Re-enactment of a Strong Exclusion Law.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 5.â Two hundred
and eighty-five delegates; ' representing
more : than a million and_ a half work
men, responded to the "roTlcail at the
opening session of the twenty-first annual
convention of the American Federation of
Labor, which was called to order by
President Samuel Gompers in St. Thomas'
College Hall at 10:30 o'clock this morn
ing. . The convention is said to be the
largest congress of workmen ever held in
this country. Organization, settlement of
questions involving contested seats .and
the reading of the annual report of the
president, secretary and treasurer took
up the -entire session of the convention.
During the course of the day there was
one surprise sprung on the delegates and
one important decision was aiso made.
The surprise came in the form oi an ob
jection to the seating oi the united Alinu
Workers' aeiegates uecause oi an alleged
error in their per capita-: tax. The mo
tion was overruled by an almost unani
mous vote of the delegates.
The most important question decided
related to the contested seat of the dele
gate Irom the Central J^aDor Union of
Richmond, " Va., whicn boay refused to
admit negro workmen to its organiza
tion. The dispute was adjusted by seat
ing the Central Labor Union representa
tive and instructing the executive board
of the American 'Federation of Liabor to
form a strong: central union for colored
men. . â  â 
Contest Over Coal Miners' Seats.
When the names of the delegates rep
resenting the United Mine Workers of
America were- reached on the rollcall a
stir was caused by C. L. Shamp of Chi
cago, international secretary-treasurer of
the Brotherhood of Stationary *Mremea,
objecting to their being seated. He main
tained that the mine workers were not
entitled- to representation in the conven
tion because the epr capita tax of $4009
had not been paid to the federation.
President Mitchell of the mine workers
replied that his organization was nut
asking for special privileges, several
thousand of its members were on strike
almost continually for the past â¢ two
years, and he said he had asked the ex
ecutive board to remit the levy because
the miners had paid an assessment of
$5000 for the aid of the machinists. He
said if the committee decided that his
organization was in arrears, he would im
mediately draw a check for the amount
due: The matter went no further, and by
an almost unanimous vote the coal min
ers' representatives were seated.
The negro question came before the
convention in the shape of a report of the
committee on credentials. William H.
Seal was elected by the Central Labor
Union of Richmond, Va., to represent it
at the convention.
It appears that the Richmond central
body refused to admit to membership
negro workmen belonging to colored to
bacco workers' unions In Richmond.
Henry Fischer, president of the National
Tobacco Workers' Union, was Instructed
by tho two local colored unions of Rich
mond to oppose the seating of Seal on
the ground that the organization he rep
resented drew the color line. The com
mittee heard both aides and, recommend
ed that Seal be seated, and also recom
mended that the executive bonrrt of the
American Federation of Lnbor be In
structed to form a separate negro central
union In Richmond. The recommenda
tions were accepted by the convention
without opposition.

GENERAL DIAZ
NOW IN PANAMA
Surrenders to General
Alban and Signs the
Peace Papers.
COLON, Dec. 5 (via Galveston).â The
following message was delayed by the
Colombian censor: General Alban, wear
ing his uniform and accompanied by a
bodyguard of soldiers, left Panama yes
terday to receive the surrender of the
Liberal General Domingo Diaz. The two
generals met at Girgora. station, on the
railroad, and^returned to Empire station,
where the peace papers were signed. .
General Diaz, wtih about eighty fol
lowers and, accompanied by General Al
ban, reached Panama at 6 o'clock yes
terday evening. General Alban conducted
the Liberal leader, who still -wore the
Liberal emblem, a red ribbon, around his
hat, to a carriage and drove with him to
his family house In Panama.
All persons here unite in agreeing that
Alban is not only a brave general, but a
true gentleman as well.
That part of the Conservative forces
under General Alban which was dis
patched to Agua Dulce has not yet re
turned. It is surmised this expedition is
in pursuit of the Liberal general, Vic
toriano Lorenzo, but there is absolutely
no information as to whether these two
forces have become engaged. â¢ . * .
It is rumored In Panama that 200 Lib
erals from Tumaco have landed in the
department of Panama to reinforce the
command . of General Belizarlo Porras.
The Conservative Government is in no
way disturbed at this rumor.
Since yesterday all trains have been
running across the isthmus without es
cort of American marines. Both ends of
the isthmus are quiet.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â Dr. Carlos

ground for the belief that the unsettled

ROCHESTER, N. Y.. Dec. â  5.â The' second
day's session of the Episcopal Missionary Con
ference opened with a conference on the prin
ciples and methods of administration.
unions. There were four strikes of a
general character during the year. About
these the report says:
That of the river and dock workers of San
Francisco was a distinct victory- The purpose
for which the strike of the Amalgamated As
sociation of Steel and Iron Workers was in
augurated was not achieved, and it was ter
minated upon conditions Ies3 advantageous
than perhaps could- have been obtained. Ow
ing to the widespread interest this strike
aroused, a large number of Iron and steel
workers employed by other companies than
the corporation against which the strike was
inaugurated have been organized under the
Jurisdiction of the Amalgamated Association.
The hope is entertained, too, that the day is
near at hand when every one employed at the
various branches of industry are coming;
under the jurisdiction of the Amalgamated
Association may be enrolled as a member pre
pared to defend and promote the interests of
the entire craft, and to further the great
cause for which we unite and federate, the
cause of human Justice. Officers of the In
ternational Association of Machinists report
that their strike has very largely succeeded In
establishing the nine-hour rule in that trade.
They claim the settlements reached have
given 60.000 machinists a shorter workday,
15,000 others are affected by compromises
reached, â¢ and 75,000 machinists will receive an
average of 25 cents a day Increase In wages.
The report notes a growing tendency to
agreements in industry. To create a de-

had apparently, studied how he might kill
himself in such a manner that his death
struggle would be witnessed by the larg
est possible number of people.
Purchasing a bottle of carbolic acid at
a drug store he walked across Pacific
avenue- and entered the hotel. As he
swallowed the contents of the bottle he
seated himself in a chair in front of the
large plate-glass windows facing the ave
nue. The hotel floor is raised two or three
feet and the view from without was as if
looking on a stage. Â»
McAllister struggled with death for
forty minutes and then died in.
the chair he had picked out and before
the gaze of fully 200 curious people. Within
two minutes after seating himself his
actions indicated that something was
wrong. The hotel clerk and others began
rushing to and fro in an effort to secure
doctors and save his life. These excited
movements quickly attracted the atten
tion of passers-by and within ten minutes
the crowd had gathered. â  Many stood on
their tiptoes and gazed while the physi
cians were pouring olive oil down the suf
fering man's throat.
McAllister was about 40 years old and
had apparently been in ill-health. His
clothes contained but 60 cents. His rela

the shaft, touched a match to the fuse
and started up the ladder to get out of
the way of the explosion. When about
forty feet from the bottom he lost his

CAPTAIN TRIBBLE SAYS "PORT";
M'KENZIE SAYS "STARBOARD"
Skippers Do Not Agree in Giving Testimony at 1 Investi
gation Into Wreck of San Rafael.
CAPTAIN OF THE ILL-FATED FERRY-BOAT SAN RAFAEL TELLS THE STORY OF- THE SINKING OF HIS
BOAT BY THE SAUSALITO TO THE UNITED STATES INSPECTORS OF STEAM VESSELS WHO ARE CON
DUCTIXG AN INVESTIGATION. ' ' '
THE investigation into the wreck
of the San Rafael on last Satur
day night has commenced and a
disagreement between her cap-
tain and that of the Sausalito as
to signals has already developed. Cap
tain J. T. McKenzie of the sunken vessel
says the warning whistle came from the
starboard side. Captain "\V. T. Tribble
gays he heard the signal on his port bow.
On the dense fog the blame for the wreck
is placed, and the United States Inspec
onl of Steam Vessels will pronounce
Judgment.
The Investigation into the cause of the
wreck began .yesterday before Inspectors
O. F. Bolles and J. K, Bulger in the Ap
praiser's building. Captain McKenzie
end Mate Johnson of the wrecked San
Rafael and Captain Tribble of the Sausa
lito told their stories of the calamity
Many other witnesses will be called.
The discrepancy in the testimony of the
two captains lies in the statements as to
the direction of the fog whistles and as
to the signals just prior to, the collision.
McKenzie's report and declaration under
oath holds fast to the statement that he
heard the whistles of the Sausalito on hi3
starboard bow. Tribble, who directed the
movements of the Sausalito on the fate
ful night is just as sure that the San
Kaiael told its warning in the fog from
its port bow, and thus the controversy
begins between the North Pacific Coast
Railroad Company's ferry-boat captains
Besides the two captains, the mate and
the two inspectors there were present at

McKenzie told his story first. The old
captain is hard of hearing and soft of
voice. The questions were shouted into
his ears and he rattled off the answers
like a youngster full of energy and en
thusiasm. He heard all the fog whistles
and signals without repetition, he said,
but sometimes the questions had to be
repeated. His testimony was corrobo
rated in the main by his mate, Johnson.
One thing that developed in the exam
ination was that no regular course was
rollowed, -either in going to or coming
from Sausalito. The east end of Alcatraz
Island was the point which both boats
used for the determination of the inner
or the outer course.
Whichever one made it first chose" its
own going and whistled the opposite to
the. other. Johnson made a positive state
ment that the Sausalito was not In its
customary course. He said that "if the
Sausalito had continued in the- way she
was steaming when the collision occurred
she would have hit the Powell-street
wharf.
Captains File Reports.
Following is the report of Captain
Tribble, filed with the Inspectors:
I left Sausalito in command of the Sausalito
at 6:10 Saturday evening, . November 30, 1901.
The weather;was foggy but I considered it safe
to proceed. AVe passed Aleatraz on the east
erly side and I shaped my course for Lombard
street wharf. The fog, after passing Alcatraz
became very thick and we proceeded at a rate
barely fast enough to keep our steerage way.
J heard the San Rafael on my port bow. I
heard her sound two whistles. I Immediately
put my helm to starboard .and. knowing- she
was on my port, I rang for full speed astern
\\e struck the San Rafael on her starboard
Mde, Just forward of the wheel.
The two boats were lashed together and pas
sengers helped from the San Rafael to the
Sausalito. Immediately after we struck some
passengers jumped from the San Rafael Into
the water. Our boats were lowered and -picked
up those who Were not lifted to the deck.
After we thought we had picked up e^ ery one
we had our lifeboats circle around for nearly
an hour.
I can in no way blame Captain McKenzie br
myself for the accident. Kvery precaution was
taken to- guard against an 1 accident and my
only explanation is that' in a fog of "the char
acter of the one on the bay on Saturday night
signals are sometimes misleading as to distance
and direction. Respectfully.
\V. T. TRIBBLE.
Captain McKenzie's report reads
I have to inform you that we left San Fran
ctsco at-6:25 p. m., with the steamer San
Rafael.- We backed out. and had to make a
round ti:rn. There were a number of steam
ers blowing whistles near our slip. We had to
stop for one Email Steamer to pass while .niak-.
Ing the turn. When ' abreast of Broadway
wharf we met the steamer Tiburon. We then
Fhaped our course for Lombard-street to catch
the bell. We passed Lombard street bell at 6:3tf
p. m. and shaped our course for Alcatraz Isl
and, running only at sufficient speed â¢ to - keep
steerage way all the time. After we got be
yond Lombard-street wharf there was a Very
heavy fog and a strong ebb running. We had
been running for three or four minutes on this
course when we heard the Sausalito's whistle
on our starboard bow. I sounded two whistles
to go to port and put my helm hard a-star
board. .Â» â¢- â¢ , . .
Blows Three Blasts.
Almost immediately I heard the Sausalito's
whistle very near and almost ahead. I then
rang one bell to stop the engine, blew three
blasts of the whistle to let them know I had.
stopped, and immediately rang two bells to
back, so as to stop the htadway of the boat The
first thing that we saw was the Sausalito' boat
coming on our starboard bow toward the San
Rafael Just forward of the wheelhouse in the.
restaurant. She stove a hole in the hull, caus
ing the water to rush in.. Charles Johnson,
who is mate, was at the wheel in the pllot
iiouse with me. I told him to go down into the
hold of the steamer and report what damage
had been done. He reported that a large hole
had been made in the hull. I gave orders to
lower the forward boats. The crew did bo. :
I then sang out to Captain Tribble of the Sau
salito to come ahead with his boat and to throw
us a line, so the boats could be lashed to-
Retner. He -did so and I ordered all the passen
gers to get aboard the Sausalito. They did so'
as fast as they could. I then went down on to
the lower deck, where I found the cook looking,
for his money. I ordered him above and told
?^~Â°. eet "Â°? i he other Â»oat.-I looked Into
the restaurant, but saw no one. Then I went
above tp the ladies' saloon deck and ordered
them all out, and when they had all left and I

were none missing.
We had fears of the stewan!, as he was very
badly hurt, and the last I saTÂ»- of him was in
charge of the barkeeper and a deckhand, who
were trying to get him aboard the Sausalito.

McKenzie Cross-Examined.
Captain McKenzie's report was received
by Inspector Bulger and then the cross
examination began by Inspector Bolles.
".Were you blowing your regular, fog
whistles after the turn?" asked Bolles. i
We were," was the answer.
Captain McKenzie thought from the
way he was shaping his course the Sausa-

"About three points "on the starboard

Captain Tribble Testifies.
Captain Tribble. of ; the Sausalito fol
lowed Captain McKenzie on the stand
His report was read and then came th'e
cross-examination.
"How was the fog in regard to dens
ity?" ,was the- first question.
â¢'Very thick," was the answer.
"Did you see the light at Alcatraz?"
"No. I heard the two bells. I thought
I was about 1200 feet off the east end of
the island." . ' v
"At about what speed were you run
ning?" ;7 r *
"About three-quarters, until the east
end of Alcatraz, when 1 slowed down. I
heard nothing until . Alcatraz was passed
from other vessels." \
"Did you get a good echo from your
whistle?"
"Yes. I passed the east end of the isl
and at 6;36. I know, for I always record
it. The way we always run is if the boat
from Sausalito gets to- the east end of
the island first we go inside, but ff the
city boat gets there first we blow two
whistles and go out." â¢ ;
"How. were you steering this night?"
"Southeast half-east, & little more v to
the southern end. to give him a chance to
pass far to the right and get the. echo
from Telegraph Hill. It was a- big ebb
tide, which was a little on the port bow
I was heading pretty well- into the tide'
which runs pretty straight, and so I did
not think we would drift."
"When did you first hear the San Ra
fael's whistle?" ' - â¢ ' ' ' â¢
"Some time before the. collision, and it
sounded on the port bow about half a
point. I heard the whistle :â - five or six
times before I heard the: signal. All this
time I was, going under a slow bell and
kept blowing the whistle all the time
Her eignal of two whistles was on the
port bow. I was- heading for the end 'of
Lombard street, and felt sure that in go
ing to the right. I would. clear. him."
"How long was it after you heard the
signal of the San Rafael that you came
together?" asked. Inspector Bulger. . â¢
"Not more than a minute," was the re
ply. -â¢â¢' â â  â > â¢â â  .'â â â  â  :
"The first time you heard the fog
whistle,. If you had - put- the wheelhard
down, you would have cleared her. would
you not?" â¢ . ; . â¢' .
"Yes;- but I had no. idea* that she was
going on that course."
Captain .Tribble then ; said ;there was no
agreement how the; boats, should run in
the fog or what course should bo taken.
Mate Johnson on the Stand.
Mate Charles Johnson of the San Ra
fael, .who was steering at the time of the
accident, was called.. He testified that the
fog was dense at,the'start and that after
turning round he could not see the lights
of the city, but afterward: saw the Tib
uron pass./ He heard the, bell at Lombard
street abeam. The boat was 'going slow
ly at this time. He steered northwest by

WILL COMPETE
IN GAS FIELD
New Company Is Formed
With a Capital of
$30,000,000. ,
Incorporators Are t to Erect
Plants Here Within
Five Months.
Articles of incorporation of the Califor
nia Gas arid Electric Company were filed
with the County Clerk yesterday. - The
capital stock is placed at the princely
figure of. $30,000,000, of which 5450,000 has
been subscribed.
The purpose of the corporation is to ac
quire gas plants and machinery for the
manufacture and distribution of gas not
only in, San Francisco, but at Bakersfield,'
Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose and other
points in the interior.
The distributing -points will ': be S3n
Francisco and Bakersfield. The. incorpo
rators are. A. E.Childs of Boston.'R. R.
Colgate of New York City, Eugene J. de 1
Sabla Jr., R. M. Hotaiing, L. P. Lowe,
John, Martin,. William M.,Â«Pierson, J. C.
Coleman and C. A. Grow, all of San Fran
cisco.
The plan of Jhe new company is to dis
tribute gas in. this. city for 75 cent3 per
thousand cubic â  feet. --If, this- is carried
out, the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company will have a formidable competi
tor. As many of the incorporators of the
new company are millionaires of enter
prise, it; seems probable that they mean
business and that the public will get the
oenefrt of cheaper gas in the near future.
Mr. Colgate, president of the company,
is a , multi-millionaire who has long-. been
Identified with gas and electrical concerns
in the East. Mr. Childs Is a capitalist,
and at present president of the light, heat
and power corporation of Boston, a con
cern embracing some fourteen companies
in Eastern cities., Mr. Hotaiing is ihe
well known local liquor man and million
aire. Mr. Martin is president of the Cali
fornia Central Gas and Electric Company,
which is at the present time supplying
many of. the interior- cities with gas and
electricity. Thefother gentlemen are well
known in legal and commercial fields.
Vice-President Martin made the fol
lowing statement last night concerning
the proposed operations of the- company:
We intend to be iri operation in this city
within the next 'five months. We will at once
begin the construction of a plant- here with
a daily capacity of 6,000,000 cubic feet. 1 â¢ Orde-s
for the material will be issued within the next
five days. We do not enter this market with
any desire to injure vested rights, but we in
tend to furnish better gas than is being fur
nished in this city at the uniform- price of
75 cents per thousand cubic feet. It is our
plan to construct a â¢ plant at Bakersfield hav
ing a capacity of 11,000,000 cubic feet. From
this point we will supply intermediate cities
to and including San Jose. The cost of our
San Francisco plant will be about $3,000,000
of which 23 or 30 per cent will be for labor
We have taken -steps to acquire the necessary
franchises here and elsewhere and within the
next twelve months the people of this city
will experience the benefits of genuine competi
tion in the lighting field. Our stock is not
for sale, for the reason that we have all the
money we require. That is all I have to Bay
concerning ,the subject for the present.
.President^ J. B. Crockett of the San
Francisco. Ga s and Electric Company said
last night that his company was ready to
meet' the promised competition. He ad
mitted that the .incorporators of the new.
company were men of wealth, and that
their connection with the project gave it
a standing which could not safely be ig
nored. He was aware that the projec*
was under consideration for some timei :
and was. riot /surprised when the papers
were filed. .He .declined to state what -his
company would, do until after . the new
company , had. commenced operations as
promised and was actually in the field as
a competitor against the existing corpo
ljation... v -Â«; â â¢. â¢ _â â¢ â  -.

Roosevelt's Policy Commended.
At the meeting of the directors of tho
California Retail Grocers' and Merchants'
Association held last night resolutions
were adopted commending the policy of
President Roosevelt in urging the re-en
actment of the Chinese exclusion law in
his recent message to Congress. Mr. Mor
ris of Alameda suggested that the Cali

throughout the State.
Sausalito's fog whistles before you did
anything?" asked Bolles. -
"About three or four times. Then the
captain ordered me to. put the. helm hard
to starboard. We blew two whistles and
the other boat did the same. Very short
ly lit ter the captain stopped the boat. The
boat was still backing at the time of the
collision. Then I left the pilot-house."
Johnson then said he was 'sent below
to report the condition to the engineer and
returned to the pilot-house.. Captain Mc-
Kenzie ordered him to lower the boat.
Two lines were fastened, stem and' stern,
from the San Rafael to the Sausalito. . He
went through the ship, helping the pas-*
sengers out of the cabin.
"Did you- stay until "the ship parted?"
was asked.
"No," was the reply. "Only until the
passengers were all out of the cabin."
."Did you see any people in the water?"
'Yes, some of them, jumped overboard
with life preservers on."
Drilled Once a Month.
"How often did you have drill on
board?" . .- \> .
"About once a month."
Johnson further testified that the boats
were all in order, but that the plugs were
out. He could not explain the necessity
of keeping. the plugs out when the boats
were covered to protect them, from rain.
Johnson â  told â¢ how he helped others up
from, the water before he was hauled up.
He saw none drowned. .
. "Did'the.whistle'of the Sausalito sound

tinued Bolles. -
â¢"Yes," was the reply.
"Do you think the Sausalito was inside
her regular course from Alcatraz to Lom
bard-street wharf?" â¢
"I don't think she was. If she had
stayed to the course, in which she | was
running- when she struck us I. think 'she
would have hit the Powell-street wharf."

his testimony that all the whistles
sounded' to. starboard. â¢ -

heavily played at 7 to 10, met with an ac
cident. Jack Atkin's horse was consid

FIERCE FIGHT
WITH NEGROES
Attempt to Arrest Thief
Results in a Deadly
Conflict.
ANDALUSIA, Ala., Dec. 5.â Sheriff
Bradshaw returned to Andalusia to-day
with twenty- two negroes, who are ac
cused of complicity in the killing of J. W.
Dorsey, a merchant, and Fate Atkinson,
City Marshal, at Opp last evening. The
negroes brought in to-day were chased
with bloodhounds and captured by the
Sheriff and his posse.
The Sheriff landed the negroes safely in
jail here, and has taken precautions to
resist a mob in case one is formed.
. J. W. Dorsey and Marshal Fate Atkin
son went to the quarters near Opp yester
day to arrest a negro who was accused of
stealing a pistol from a white man. The
negro was barricaded in his cabin and
fired on the men as they approached. It
developed that the negro had about fifty
of his fellow workmen in the house with
him. A general battle ensued, in which
Dorsey was killed and Atkinson fatally
wounded, he dying of his injuries shortly
afterward. A white man named JFitzsim
mons, who was with them, was shot twice
in the leg. Two negroes were killed and
several others wounded. The names of
these are at present unknowri.
The attempt to capture the negroes at
that time was given up and Sheriff'Brad
shaw was sent for. He left Andalusia at
once for Opp with deputies and dogs, and
returned to-day with twenty-two negroes:
J. . W. Dorsey, one of the white men
killed, was one of the most prominent citi
zens of Opp, being a merchant, a member
of the Council and Treasurer of the town

ALL ALONG PACIFIC COAST
Ship Nelson Reported Lost and Forty Per Cent. Reiri=
surance Paid, but She Reaches Port.
AMERICAN SHIP SPARTAN THAT WAS THIRTY DAYS COMING FROM THE SOUND WITH A LOAD OF COAL.
THE VESSEL WAS CAUGHT IN THE SOUTHEASTER AND HAD A TERRIBLE TIME OF IT OFF THE CO
LUMBIA RIVER. â¢
THE unusually heavy gale that has
raged along the coast has given
rise to many a tale of disaster.
For Instance, the British ship
Nelson was said to have foun
dered off the Columbia River. She left
Astoria November 25 with 38,230 centals
of wheat, valued at $35,700, for England,
but was caught in the gale and bad to
be towed bacK to port.
Early yesterday morning the Nelson
was reported to nave gone down with all
hands. Later news showed that the story
was at least partly untrue, so the under
writers offered 4U per cent to> reinsure
â¢-heir chances. Some of the gamblers
took a "flier" on the vessel, and one hour
later were $40 on the 5100 "to the good."
The news came to the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday afternoon -that the
eteamer Walla "Walla was passing Flat
tery with the ship in tow. The Walla.
"Walla is the well known liner of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company and
shoud have reached Victoria, B. C, early
vesterday morning. While still many
miles this side of Flattery Captain Andy-
Hall saw the distress lights of a ship.
He at once headed for them and soon dis
covered the Nelson on her beam ends.
As soon as possible a line was passed
aboard and after many mishaps made
fast. Then the Walla Walla went ahead
and some hours later had. her tow on
the Sound. The dispatch to the exchange
cays, *'It was a good job and well done."
The chances are that the Walla Walla
â will get salvage on the tow.
The Nelson had a marvelous escape
from destruction. She crossed the Colum
bia River bar a week ago last night and
before she had gone a great distance she
encountered a severe storm and was
roughly handled. Her cargo of wheat
shifted, causing her to list to starboard
and almost on her beam ends. In this
condition she was picked up by the tug
Wallula and an effort was made to tow
her to Astoria, but the tug had to aban
don her. Later the powerful tug Tatoosh
took hold of her. but found it impossible
to tow her owing to the fury of the gale
and the high seas. The captain of the
Tatoosh decided to tow her to Puget
Sound, but had not proceeded far when
the gale increased in fury and on Tuesday
r right at 10 o'clock the hawser parted and
' the Tatooph was unable to find the vessel
when daylight came. The Nelson fired
rockets and burned flashlights all night,
but failed to attract the attention of ves
sels. On Wednesday morning the steamer
Walla Walla picked her up north of Grays
Harbor.
The hull of the Nelson Is practically in
tact, but her bulwarks are smashed, life
boats and fore rigging carried away and
the cabins damaged. There are only three

inches of water In her hold, but the extent
of the damage to her cargo of wheat is
not known.
The Umatilla Reef lightship No. 67 also
went adrift in the storm. She finally
brought up at Port Angeles, and when
last reported all hands were safe and
well. The Hydrographic Office reports
that new moorings will be placed as soon
a.s possible and inside of a week the
lightship will be back at her post.
In connection with the storm it is
worth mention that the ship Edward Se
vra.ll, on which 15 per cent reinsurance
was paid, has arrived safely at Shanghai.
She is -well known on this coast and 's
one of the latest steel ships turned out
from the Sewall yards.
VESSELS LOSE LUMBER,
The schooners Guide and Jennie Thelin
and the ship Spartan had a hard time of
it on the coast. The Guide was 8 days
getting here from Eureka, the Thelin 28
days from Grays Harbor and the Spartan
30 days from the Sound. The latter is
one of the old time clippers and for a
while was given up as lost. Captain Po
lite weathered the gale, however, and
came in with all his sails.
The Guide lost fifty bundles of shingles
and some of her deckload. while the The
lin lost 30,000 feet of her deckload. All
three vessels had a rough time and the
Spartan was several times in peril. The
old timer is again in port, however, ap
parently none the worse for her rough
experience.
Experimenting on Lights.
The Harbor Commissioners will make a
number of experiments on the penetrat-.
ing effect of lights in a fog during the
coming winter. Acting on the suggestion
of President Kilburn, the commission Kas
ordered Electrician F. E. Whorf to test
all the shades of color from, the ferry
tower. So far his tests show that green
penetrates the fog farther than any other
color. Red shows up well and white 13
almost lost. It is the intention of the
commission to have a searchlight placed
in the ferry tower and during the coming
winter the tests will be held. Should
green prove to be the most prominent
and far-reaching color In a fog it will be
used on all the signal stations, and also
on the ferry tower. The consensus of
opinion among ferry captains and local
snipping men is that green is the coming
color in a fog. ...

Captain C. F. Swan, late of the bark
Aureola and later of the tug Hercules, re
turned from a three years' sojourn in
Alaska on the Umatilla. He came from
Dutch Harbor on the revenue cutter The
tis to Seattle and thence, to San Fran
cisco on the regular liner. He says Alas
ka is destined to be one of the great
States of the Union. He sees no reason
why it should not be as densely popu
lated as Sweden, Norway and Finland,
and asserts that had those countries the
same facilities and means of . livelihood
for the â¢ population there would never a
Swede, Norwegian or Finn come to the
United States. Captain Swan continued:
"The people will have to go to Alaska
and grow up there. They must get used
to the climate and conditions and when
the young Alaskans come to maturity
Uncle Sam will have the sturdiest race
of men on earth to draw from in an
emergency." Captain Swan goes north in
the spring.

Marine Fireman Is Arrested and
Evidence of Theft Is Taken
From Him.
Mrs. Gonzales of 1121 Kearny street
caused the arrest last evening of Aurelllo
Aballi, a marine fireman, on a charge of
burglary. She attended a wake in the
Latin quarter Wednesday evening and on
returning to her home discovered that
the house had been entered and a $20
Mexican bill and jewelry valued at J400
stolen. Suspecting Aballi she went to hl3
home and accused him of havlnz com
mitted the crime. He indignantly denied
that he knew anything about the burglary
and ordered her away. Meeting Police
Officers Holmes and Skaln she told them
of her suspicions and they decided to ar
rest Aballi. He was found last night and
taken to the City Prison. When searched
the stolen bill was found in his possession.

WATTERSON'S PLATFORM.
SINCE Colonel Watterson decided to cease being
Warwick and concluded to be King; since he
looked upon the Governors he has made and
called them bad and decided to be Governor himself,
he has gone into retreat, far from the sound of the
distiller}- whistle when it gives shrill notice that the
worm is in order, and remote even from the tele
phone bell, which heeds no hours and has no set time
or season.
In this seclusion our interesting Mahatma is think
ing out a Democratic party, conducting it to glorious
victory and handing dov.'n party, victory and all the
offices and muniments of power to the Svvamis that
watch by night on the political plains below his
perch. He has selected the constitution of the United
States as the new platform of his triumphant Democ
racy. He has recently looked that document over,
and after the most careful inspection and trial of
every section as carefully as a wheel-tapper tries the
underpinning of a train decides that it is good leather
and any party that takes it for a platform will go
under the wire while the other is foaming down the
backstretch.
The colonel seems to think that there can be no
dispute about the constitution, and that the party
which adopts it entire will have the other on the hip.
If he will some day revisit his birthplace, Washington
City, and go to the law section of the Congressional
library, he will find a bewildering array of books con
taining the cases decided by the Supreme Court to
settle disputes over the meaning of the constitution.
He will discover that different constructions of his
proposed platform have generated legal controver
sies over Federal and State rights, over person and
property, and cover the whole range of the science
of law, from admiralty to eminent domain, from the
dominion of the sea to dominion of the land. He
will find that," from the beginning, members of the
same party have differed about the meaning of the
constitution, and members of different parties have
agreed with each other/ * .
After he has looked over the index of all these
volumes and read several syllabi he will conclude
that all differences of construction have been recon
ciled by the court, and will cry, "Go to! What if
my countrymen have been dull of apprehension and
have differed about this, the court has made it all
clear, and damned be he who cavils further!" But
if he will go to the Capitol he will find sitting in the
old Senate chamber, in a dim, religious light, nine
gentlamen arrayed in black silk gowns, cut full in the
skirt. He stands before the Supreme Court of the
United States in its working dress. Before it is a
docket, so long that it is never cleared and finished,
filled with cases arising in differences of opinion and
construction of that si me constitution. He will see
;.' the bar of that court the legal talent of the coun
try, arrayed, giant against giant, in a mighty conten
tion about what his platform means. Then he will
go back to his Himalaya and say, "Boys, let's fall
back on the familiar, home-made article. Let us con
tinue to view with aversion and alarm the policy of
the other party and point with pride to our promise
to pay, if we win 1 .".
And .that is what it will come to. With that un
quenchable enthusiasm of youth, which time cannot
touch. Colonel W2tterson cries out now: "The Dem
ocratic party is nothing if it be not the party of the
constitution. In that character, adequately equipped
and skillfully marshaled, nothing can resist it. In
Kentucky all is well. ; How is it elsewhere? Watch
man, tell us of the night!"
Well, Henry, outside Kentucky the boys continue
to water it a little.
When the British get tired of chasing the Boers
they sit down and try to think out how the Boers
manage to keep on hand so many fresh horses and
such a supply of ammunition. In the end, however,
they have to give up the problem. They find it about
as tiring as any other feature of the war.
General Buller shows about as much strategy in
bluffing the British War Office as he did in trying
to storm the Boer intrehchments, and he may yet
have an experience as sad as that which befell' him
on the romantic banks of Tugela River.
RECIPROCITY WITH CUBA,
DISPATCHES from Washington announce
that strong efforts are being made to procure
from Congress an act granting many of the
products of Cuba free access to the markets of- the
United States. The movement is supported par
tially by arguments of an economic nature, , but
mainly by appeals to sentiment. It is urged that
since we have done so much for Cuba we should do
something more; that having given her people free
dom we should now make a sacrifice of ourselves" in
order to make them rich.
It has. long been known in the world that business
and sentiment do not mix well. The combination is
always hurtful to some extent, and not infrequently
it is disastrous to both sentiment and business. The
peculiar' plea made for Cuba is therefore in its very
nature open to objection and subject to suspicion.
It may .be fairly asked if the proposed freedom of
trade with Cuba will be beneficial to American in
dustries why talk about the alleged "moral obliga
tion" to grant it? If it will not be beneficial to our
interests why not confine the plea strictly to appeals
to sentiment and leave business out of the question
altogether?
The business argument is invalid. Reciprocity with
Cuba would expose to the competition of the cheap
labor of the island many of the largest of our indus
tries, and even if they were not large the objection
would be just as strong, for the protective system
would be unfair and unjust if it did not protect all
home industries without 'respect to their magnitude.
The study of the reciprocity treaties negotiated by
Commissioner Kasson has given the American peo
ple a wider understanding of the policy of reciprocity
than they had before, and the difficulties of applying
the system in practice are now generally recognized.
The consequence has been the development of a pub
lic sentiment in opposition to the scheme as a whole.
Reciprocity with Cuba as a business proposition
would not be essentially different from reciprocity
with any other nation. It will have to be studied
with respect to its effect on American industries, and
when so studied is found to be objectionable from
every point of view.
The sentimental plea is well nigh as weak as the
business argument. It is a familiar experience that if
you help a man once you will have to help him again.
The more you help him the more he relies upon you,
and by and by you will either have to support him
altogether or quit helping him at all. We have helped
Cuba, and because we have done so it is now argued
we must continue to help her. It is therefore perti
nent to ask how far the help is to go and how long
it is to continue. To what extent are the Cubans to
have a moral right to ask our assistance in promot
ing their business because we gave them assistance in,
establishing their independence? Are the Cubans to
become, like the Indians, "perpetual wards of the na
tion," with an increasing expectation of favors to
come year after year?
If it be insisted that we are bound to help the
Cubans get rich, then the question arises how that
help shall be given. To expose a few of our indus
tries to unrestricted Cuban competition while leav
ing ether industries fully protected would be to throw
the whole burden of helping Cuba upon the exposed
industries alone. That would not be fair. If we are
morally bound to help Cuba the obligation rests upon
the whole people and not upon a few industries. The
help, therefore, should be given in the form of a sub
sidy and not in the fcrm of free trade for her prin
cipal products.
The people of the United States have freed the Cu
bans, and now the Cubans should be left to work out
their own salvation. The plea made in their behalf
is invalid, whether made a^ a business proposition or
as a sentimental appeal. Whatever duty we owe to
Cuba, our first duty is to our own people, and one of
the cardinal features of the home duty is that of pro
tecting the industries upon which our wo-rkingmen
depend fcr a livelihood. As the President himself
has said, "that is the prime consideration of our
entire economic legislation."
Colonel Bryan repeats that he does not agree with
President Roosevelt on matters of politics, but he
commends his disapproval of dock-tailed horses; so
it will be seen the Colonel is getting slowly round to
a friendly and appreciative frame of mind. By and
by he may approve of other things.
GERMAN DEPRESSION.
LET him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall applies to the pride of nations and of
men alike.
Up to eighteen monfhs ago Germany was enjoying
the greatest period of prosperity she has known in
all her history. Profit was High, her staples found
a ready market, her labor was employed, its wages
were greater than ever, and speculation, which is an
inseparable attendant upon national prosperity,
lustily rioted on the Berlin boerse. Bankers had to
enlarge their premises to accommodate customers,
and the Paris edition of the New York Herald, in its
Berlin correspondence, says the brokers became so
suddenly affluent that they bought estates for them
selves and set up establishments that rivaled the no
bility.
In the general exuberance this thick buttering of
bread on both sides was attributed to Germany's ap
pearing in "welt politik" â to her springing into the
ring as a world power. She had seated herself with
out let or leave in a Chinese seaport and had blandly
assumed the head of the table in Asia, ready to ask
Russia and England whether they preferred white or
dark meat at the feast of partition of China.
Now it has all faded like the mirage. By the subtle
operation of that law of reaction which nothing
seems able to exclude from human affairs, the tide
stopped, stood still and began to recede, carrying ruin
on its ebb.
Bankers are left loaded with stocks that are shrink
ing to nothing. ' Brokers find themselves with no
money to support the state and circumstance of their
estates. Manufactories are closing down, shipping is
idle, and in Berlin alone nearly 50,000 laborers have
no work and the harsh winter is piercing their rags.
Men marvel at it and seek the cause. One says over
speculation, another over-production, a third "welt
politik." Combined, these all may be the causes of the
cause. That is the giddy sense of danger that comes
to men when they fly tod high. Sometimes satiety
figures among the causes. A group of men feel that
for the present they have enough. They begin to
"cash in," as it were. Immediately another group
sees in this some hidden meaning and take it as a
sign to get from under, and they cash in also. The
\ first group illustrate prudence and moderation, but
their prudence runs into a panic and the wheels stop,
the sails are furled, and all credit, legitimate' and
speculative, comes to liquidation. In that day of
judgment Asiatic seaports and far islands buffer noth
ing. The pains and penalties of.ovef-conndence must
be suffered, and men must wait until the law, of re
action restores confidence, picks trade out of the

A VANISHED BUGABOO.
DURING the whole of the past summer and
fall a fear of a possible reopening of this
country, to unrestricted Chinese immigration
has been upon a considerable portion of the people.
The Chinese Minister had the floor, as it were. He
began with a Fourth of July speech at Philadelphia,
diplomatically preparing the way for a sentiment in
opposition to exclusion. Thereafter he went on at
different times to speak more boldly and to suggest
special reasons. why Chinese immigration would be
beneficial to the East and to the South. His utter
ances were taken up by influential papers in the East,
and, while they were hot directly commended, they
were neither refuted nor condemned. Consequently
there was good reason on the surface of things -to
fear that the fight for exclusion would be difficult
and the victory by no means certain.
The poll of Congress by The Call correspondent
at Washington shows that after all there was more
talk than danger in the diplomacy of the astute Chi
nese Minister. Public sentiment all over the coun
try has been too firmly formed to be shaken by his
specious arguments concerning the advantages ' of
Chinese labor to the South or Chinese trade to the
East. The arguments of the Minister were taken in
the East as good subjects for midsummer discussion,
and a special interest was given to them by the fact
that they came from a Chinaman capable of making
not only witty after-dinner, speeches at American ban
quets but a first-class Fourth of July oration. The
effect of them, however, v/as virtually nothing. The
people remained steadfast in the resolve that Ameri
can workingmen shall not be exposed in their own
homes to the competition of Chinese, and that re
solve is well understood by Congressmen of all par
ties.
The firm declaration in the President's message in
favor of the immediate re-enactment of the exclusion
law so amended as to make it entirely effective, taken
together with the declarations of members of Con
gress, puts an end to all fears that may have been
felt upon the subject. It is now clear the American
people have had ample experience with race
problems and are not going to expose themselves de
liberately to the coming of another. A Chinese ex
clusion bill will be passed and it will be so drawn as
to provide for exclusion as the permanent policy of
the country.
Such being the situation there is no need to send a
delegation to' Washington, no need to raise money^.to
defray its expenses. The fight for exclusion has been
won and the, issue is settled. We shall have a better
law on the subject. than ever before, and the only
thing required of the people in future will be to see
that it is strictly and honestly enforced.
The French Government is talking abput putting
a tax upon pianos, and it is. scarcely necessary to say
there is music in the air that sounds dangerous to
the Ministry.
EUROPEAN IDEAS OF US.
THE United States is bound by treaty to keep
the Panama railway open to commerce.
Colombia, like all the isthmian and South
American countries, lias the revolutionary habit as a
chronic ailment. There seems to be no remedy for it
but phlebotomy, but bleeding rarely accompanies
revolution down there. The casualties in one . of
those frequent outbursts are hardly equal to the car^
nage of a football game between the students of two
American universities. A revolution among those
people is simply the means of changing an adminis
tration. In Salvador, for example, there has not been
a Presidential election for twenty-six years, though
the constitution of that country requires that such
election be had every four years. An administration
stays in power and stands at the point where the pub
lic revenues are lost by "friction" between the collec
tion and the public treasury, and when some ambi
tious, impecunious patriot concludes that the ins have
fattened enough on friction he strikes an attitude,
raises his voice for purity of government, gets^a few
musketeers together and chases out the incumbent
and proceeds to place himselfj at the friction point
and prospers until his turn comes. The United States
has no desire to interfere with this rotation in the en
joyment of friction, but only to protect the interests
of civilization. For this purpose it placed jackies to
guard the Panama' railway and forbade the bombard
ing of Colon, which .would have destroyed the terj
minus of that road. Thereupon European journals
saw our intention to permanently occupy the isthmus,
and indulged in serious reflections upon our imperial
purposes, and upon the Monroe doctrine in general.
We have no wish to occupy the isthmus. We are
Dy treaty the trustee of the right of the civilized world
to commercial transit of the isthmus, and' we have
asserted our responsibility in the only possible way.
When- the nickel revolution is over and the new or
old beneficiary of friction has his pocket under the
hopper, and is able incidentally to keep the isthmus
open, we will withdraw and go about- our business
elsewhere. â¢â ..â "â 
Perhaps we cannot too much wonder at the mis
construction put upon our action by European jour
nals. After all, they are only paying us back in our
own coin. When England sent a warship into Co
rinto to capture the custom-house and collect,rev
enue to pay a British subject who had been flogged
on K his bare back by the temporary tyrant of that
country Senator Morgan, then chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, to vent his spite on Cleve
land's administration, said in an interview that ; our
supineness had admitted England into Nicaragua and
she was there to stay, and henceforth that country
was to become a dependency of the British crown.
v'. Of course this was rot, for Great Britain was only
doing that which we might with frequent profit imi
tate. She was teaching one of these little irrespon
sible.'tyrannies to keep, its; hands off her people, and
if the lesson had involved blowing up the Corinto
cuartel it would not have been too severe.

OPERA SEASON CLOSES
AMID EXCITING SCENES
AND TUMULT OF CHEERS
Theater Is Crowded by Brilliant Audience
and Flowers Are Showered on Artists.
. Grau Company Departs.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
WELL, It Is all over, the bril
liant song and pageant of the
last three weeks at the Grand
Opera-house, and It closed last
night in a great blaze of glory.
No such scenes as those that marked last
night's performance of "Le Nozze di Fi
garo," with its matchless cast, have been
witnessed here since Patti's day. It was
the old-time sort of reception one has
"heard tell of," but sees once only per
haps In a lifetime: flowers raining upon
the stage, deafening applause, and the
whole paraphernalia of enthusiasm in full
working order.
It began with Frltzi Scheff, whose
choice singing of the Cherubino song,
â¢*Vol che sapete," received an enthusias
tic encore, . and a couple of bouquets as
tall as the piquant little damsel herself, j
â¢ Then Campanari, the competent, came
in for a share of the' plaudits as Figaro,
whose marriage caused all the trouble.
Afterward came the magnificent recep
tion to Mme. Eames. after her "Dove
Sono" aria. I have never seen anything
quite like it so far in my life. It was
more like a Tivoli crowd multiplied by ten
than anything else, that greeted the
opera, and gave godspeed to the singers
last night, and Eames got the first full
taste of its quality. After her "Dove
Sono" she stood under a rain of flowers,
all fair red and white like her lovely
gown, that took three \ ushers to carry
them off the stage, and came out time and
time and time again to satisfy the clam
orous audience. She did not repeat the
aria, as the "letter duet" followed almost
immediately. 1
That, of course, was the signal for an
other flood of enthusiasm, to which Mme\
Eames and Mme. Sembrich graciously re
sponded with an encore. Then came Sem
brich's turn, and the demonstration of the
eeason greeted the most glorious singer
that most of us ever hope to hear. The
progress of the opera was again impeded
by several minutes and Seppilli, with his
sharp little rap on the desk, had to call,
the audience to order at the last.
De Reszke, the magnificent, and all-
Batisfylng Almavina had his greeting, too,
and the close of the second act marked a
distinct triumph for the audience in that
the elusive Mr. Seppilli was presuaded
upon the stage. I don't know how they
got him there. The only other occasion
during the season when the modest con
ductor was found on the further side of
the footlights was when some ingenious
improvisatore told him that Mr. Grau had
asked for him there! I noticed, though,
that Mr. Seppilli seized the occasion to
imprint an admiring kiss upon Sembrich's
pretty hand.
Tavecchia, the excellent Bartolo of the
cast; Miss Bauermeister, the clever Mar
cellina; Reiss, the very worthy Basilio,
and Dufriche, the good Antonio, all got
their welcomes. But the closing scene
surpassed all. Women crowded down the
aisles, waving their handkerchiefs, piping
"bravos" at the top of their voices. They
clambered through the orchestra and
right to the stage to touch the hands of
the reigning queens, who stood there giv
ing audience to scores of their adorers.
Nine times the closing curtain went up
and down and thus ended with all honors
the second cf the Grau season of grand
opera here, a never-to-be-forgotten scene.
Gadski received an ovation yesterday
afternoon for her noble and beautiful per-
SHEEPMEN FORM
A BIG COMBINE
Propose to Lease Ranges
so as to Exclude the
Cattle Kings.
CHEYENNE. "Wyo., Dec. 5.â A gigantic
combination is being: formed at Rawlins
by the sheepmen of what is known as
the Sweetwater country for the purpose
of excluding flockmasters from Utah and
local cattlemen from encroaching upon
what is known as the Red Dester winter
ranges in Sweetwater County. It is pro
posed to lease and buy from the Union
Pacific every alternate section owned by
the company and thereby control approx
imately 1,500,000 acres of the finest win
ter feeding ground in the West.
By leasing all of the land, which will
also give them control of the alternate
Government sections, the sheepmen will
hold full sway, and range conflicts, which
have been frequent, will come to an end.
. The sheepmen who propose to lease the
land have offered the railroad company a
rate of 1 cent per acre, or J4800 per year,
for the land. The proposition has been
wired to the Union Pacific general offices
at Omaha, and it is expected that the
deal will be closed in a few days.

THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL,; FRIDAY* DECEMBER 6; 1901.
THE most remarkable season of
grand opera ever, given on this
: coast terminated last night at the
Grand Opera-house and the Grau
. Company is now speeding toward
Kansas City on a special train that left
the 'Oakland mole at 2 o'clock this morn
ing.
During the four weeks' season the com
pany gave thirty performances and the
receipts have reached the sum of $230,000.
The number of people who heard the
grand opera figures up to more than 80,000,
and it is a record for Captain of Police
Spillane and his men that not a single
accident has occurred at the Grand
Opera-house nor has any property of the
visitors been lost.
Calve, Sanderson and Eames will not
sing with the Grau Company in Kansas
City next week, owing to their voices be
ing affected by colds.
Calve leaves this morning for Florida,
where she will rest until she Is able to
join Grau in New York for the season.
Eames departs for St. vLouis this morn
ing and will rest there for one week until
the company arrives in' that city. Sybil
Sanderson has decided to have an opera
tion performed on her throat and will
probably remain in California for a few
weeks. It is estimated that Manager'
Grau has profited, more than $50,000 on the
season in this citv. !
formance of Elizabeth's part in "Tann
hauser." The prima donna was In splen
did form; as she has been throughout
the engagement, and sang as well, per
haps better, than she has ever sung be
fore here. If Eames has It in the ulti
mate perfection of her Elsaâ and I think
she hasâ Gadski's Elizabeth Is a larger
and more satisfying conception than
Eames' interpretation of the part. It is
a rounded, womanly, tender reading,
having all stateliness and fineness be
sides. Her voice lacks the last perfec
tion of control, but Is so touching and
sympathetic, as well as powerful and
dramatic in quality, that the lack is
largely forgotten. Gadski looks the part
beautifully ' and makes a lovely - picture
in her handsome garb. She was shower
ed with flowers at the second act's end,
and responded in her gracious, character
istic way to the hearty welcome.
"Tannhauser" is many sizes too large
for Mr. Dippel, who yesterday essayed
the erring knight's part. His "Lohen
grin" was so good that I expected much
from his "Tannhauser," but he did not
succeed in filling the bill. Only in the
"Saengerfest" scene did he rise to any
power, but his performance was without
other offense than its weakness. Mr.
Bispham's Wolfram was all that could
be desired, of noble accent and vocal
splendor. This versatile singer does noth
ing better than his reading of the stately
and high-minded Wolfram's part. Mr.
Blass filled in the part of Herman with
dignity and power. Mme. Reuss-Belce
was satisfactory as Venus and Miss Car
rie Bridewell was uncertain and untune
ful as the shepherd.
Only a poor house greeted the music
drama, a house hearty, though eccen
tric, in its enthusiasm, breaking in here,
there and everywhere with well-inten
tioned though ill-timed applause. Dam
rosch conducted with his usual compe
tence, though not quite his customary
spirit.
BARK CRASHES
ON THE ROCKS
French Vessel Ernest
Reyer Meets With
Disaster.
ABERDEEN, Wash., Dec. 5.â At 2
o'clock Wednesday morning, while the
terrible storm was raging along the coast,
the French bark Ernest Reyer went on
the rocks off the mouth of Quinault River,
about thirty miles north of Grays Har
bor.
The vessel struck heavily on the beach
and the full force of the waves pounded
her further up the shore, every incom
ing sea washing clear over her. In the
darkness and storm It was impossible to
see how far away the land lay, but the
officers and men cleared away the boats
and made for the shore, all reaching land
in safety.
When the ship first struck a heavy sea
made a breach over her, carrying off
three of the sailors, who were driven back
on board again by the receding wave and
scrambled Into one of the small boats
just as it was leaving the vessel.
The shipwrecked men are being cared
for on the beach by the Quinault Indians,
but they have no hopes of saving: their
ship, as she now lies hard aground with
the breakers pounding her to pieces.
Masts, rigging and sails have gone and
she will be a total loss.
The Ernest Reyer is a steel-built French
baric of 3500 tons, built at Nantes. France
ten months ago. She was Commanded by
Captain Pullizuyet. She carried a crew
of twenty-eight men. She cleared from
Madagascar on her maiden voyage
touched at Tasmania for orders and
from there proceeded in ballast for Port
land. Mate Rochon came from the scene
of the wreck on the tug- Ranger this after

went through his pockets, taking about
$20 in coin and two gold medals which

Judge Conlan Accused of Refusing to
' Issue His Share of the
Complaints.
The ten grocers and saloon-keepers who
were arrested Wednesday for using
nickel-in-the-slot machines on their prem
ises that paid in checks redeemable in
coin appeared in the police courts yes
terday morning. In Judge Fritz's court
H. Schroeder pleaded guilty and George
H. James and George Wobber were found
guilty. They will appear for sentence
to-morrow. In Judge Cabaniss' court
James Ferguson and George Gibbs plead
ed guilty and were each fined $5. Charles
Wakefleld pleaded not guilty and his case
was continued till December 10. In Judge
Mogan's court Henry Heine, Ed Reid,
George Kroh and Charles Schoene plead
ed not guilty and their cases were con
tinued for a week.
Policemen Levings and Wedekind se
cured the evidence In the cases and yes
terday morning Wedekind went with five
new complaints to Judge Conlan, as Chief
Wittman wanted all the Judges to have
their share. The complaints were not
sworn to and Wedekind reported to the
Chief that Conlan refused to accept them,
as they were "John Doe's." He insisted
upon the names being filled in, but" the
officer told him that he did not know the
names, although he knew the persons
wanted. The Chief advised him to get
the other Judges to accept them. Conlan
declares that he did not refuse to accept
the complaints and told the officer to try
to obtain the names, but if not successful
to return and he would issue the war
rants.
MORGAN CITY CASE
IS STILIi ON TRIAL
Defense Contends That Charter Party
of the Wrecked Ship Is Not
Valid.
The trial of the suit of the La Due Gold
Mining and Development Company
against the Frankfort Marine Insurance
Company occupied yesterday's session of
the, Circuit Court. The case hangs upon
the validity of the charter party of the
wrecked Morgan City, the freight upon
which had been insured with 1 the defend
ant. The defense s has raised the conten
tion that the charter party is void because
at the time it was made between the Gov
ernment and the firm of Barneson & Chll
cott, John . Barneson, senior member of
the firm, was also an officer of the Gov
ernment-and was prohibited by statute
from being a party to the contract.
Captain Barneson raises the point that
at the time of the signing of the charter
party 'he was a member of the firm of
Enrneson' &:Chllcott and was not con
nected with the Government service in
any manner. Several months afterward,
when the Government renewed the char
ter party for. the services of the Morgan
City as an army transport, he was marine
superintendent of army transports, but he
contends that that fact did not Invalidate
the agreement. The case will be resumed
this morningv
To Guard Chinese Immigrants.
As a result of reoresentations made by
Customs Collector Stratton to . the Treas
ury Department with reference to the too
frequent escape of Chinese ' immisrnnts

permission i for the building of an office
on. the Mail dock near the shed for the
use of Chinese Inspector Schell and his
staff, who will be stationed there in the
future i to prevent escapes. The building
will be elected at the expense of tho Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company.

Man advices from New York say: "The spot
Snarket Is very quiet now that Thanksgiving
has been passed and trade undoubtedly will
l>e limited for the next week or so, until the
Christmas rush sets in in earnest. Prunes
meet with a fair demand from the local and
nearby trade, sizes from C0-70s to 90-lOOs being
most wanted and not plentiful- The situation
on the coast is reported firmer, most holders
now quoting at a 3c tasis, price for the large
sizes of Santa Clara fruit* Sizes from 60-70s
up are said to be scarce, some packers not
otering these sizes at elL Sonomas are offer-
Ing at a 2%c basis for 40-SOs, 50-6Ss and 60-70s,
and sonic northern fruit, four sizes, is avail
able at the same basis. At present local buyers
are very disposed to take hold of prunes, al
though reports from California estimate the
number of cars of new fruit in the Santa Clara
Valley tt not over S00 cars. With the old
prunes out of the tray and no longer a menace
to tht market the probability is that buyers
would become interested. Negotiations for the
Kale of the old prunes are still proceeding on
the coast, it is understood.
~A private letter from the coast to-day
stated that stocks of new crop prunes in the
whele of the State of California are estimated
not to exceed 350 carloads. A letter from an
Oregon packer states that stocKs in the North
west fio not exceed 75 carloads, the bulk of
which are la the hands of dealers. Sales of
Oregon prone* to come East are reported on
the 2c four-sise basis. On 40-50s and 50-60s

of 10S carloads at 100-120s are reported on th*

being very scarce.

The loss thus far this week to the sub-treasury
of $5,874,000 served as a. warning note to the
optimists on the money outlook. The disburse
ments on Government account have been very
light during the week and the offerings of Gov
ernment bonds for redemption have receded to
nominal figures, notwithstanding the with
drawal of bonds on deposit to secure circula
tion up to the full limit allowed for the month
and presumably for the purpose of offering
them for redemption. Assertions that receipts
of cash from the Interior on the express move
ment are largely in excess of shipments are
not entirely reassuring, in view of the fact
that deposits at the sub-treasury for transfer
to the Interior already exceed half a million
dollars for the week. New York exchange at
Chicago fell to 40c discount to-day. On the
international exchange there was an easier
tone in the sterling exchange market, but Con
tinental exchange hardened. Money was in ac
tive demand in London to pay the installment
due on the British loan, the price of gold ad
vanced and a stiff rate Is expected there for
the rest of the year and Into January. The
private discount rate rose in Paris to-day and
the sterling rate there receded further. The
possibility of further gold exports next week
is thus clearly foreshadowed. Between now
and December 20 the local money market has
to make provision for the Standard Oil divi
dend disbursement of $8,000,000, and a 1 per
cent dividend on United States Steel common
stock, which calls for upward of $5,000,000.
There was no Immediate indication of money
scarcity in to-day's loan rate, but the consid
eration of future contingencies had much to
do with the quieting of speculation on the
Stock Exchange. A renewed decline in Amal
gamated Copper after some early firmness, in
spite of the recovery in the raw copper mar
ket In London, was also an unsettling influ
ence in stocks. The market closed dull and
generally heavy.
The railroad bond market was steady for a
time, but became Irregular in sympathy with
stocks. Total sales, par value, $4,420,000.

NEW TORK, Dec. 5.â The Commercial â¢ Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Bear covering caused a further all around ral
ly in the stock market to-day.. Consols rose
to 92%d. American shares were . idle though
generally firm. This firmness was assisted by
Secretary Gage's report, - the cessation of gold
shipments and the recovery in 'copper to Â£58
a ton. Rio Tintos sympathetically rose to tZ'A
on rumors that the Amalgamated Copper Com
pany had approached the leading Calumet cus
tomers, offering to supply copper below. Calu
met, whatever the price of the latter might
be.
Silver rallied to 25 5-16d, but America is of
fering heavily a shade above this. Paris ex

New York Grain and Produce.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â Under the Impetus of
a fresh whirl of outside buying orders that
made both the wheat and corn rings a scene
of great excitement to-day new records were
established. Wheat sold at 85%c for May. or
%c higher than it was last August, while corn
passed any point since 1892. For a time the
buying orders seemed unlimited and the mar
kets continued in a bull uproar until midday,
when a lull ln demand gave holders a desire
to take profits, causing general reactions. In
wheat the selling destroyed the day's advance,
but corn withstood all pressure and left off

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.â Booming bull enthusiasm,
the heaviest transactions ln over a year ln all
pits, record prices ln crain and heavy profits
for the fortunate sellers â these were, the char
acterietic features of business on the Board of
Trade to-day. The craze for buying which be
gan to show itself yesterday was present again
at the opening and was augmented on every
hand as the session advanced. The seats, the
floor and the galleries of the board were crowd
ed with spectators and speculators, largely vis
iting stockmen, all eagerly trading.
Wheat, as yet, seemed to be ln most de
mand though It held poorly. A general bull
movement, almost regardless of the usual in-'
fluencing conditions, seemed to control the
transactions. The country side seemed to have
arisen as one man and rushed to this market
to buy. Not since the present bull campaign
began have brokerage and . commission people
been pressed to handle speculative orders as
they have to-day. No man or firm was big
enough ln the perfect storm of business to be
"prominent" in the pit. Offerings, which were
very liberal at the very start, were absorbed
as so much water In a sponge. News in itself
was not very bullish. Cables showed very lit
tle response to yesterday's feeling here. Local
and Northwestern receipts were small and
showed a gradual decrease. But primary re
ceipts were rather liberal and clearances were
not large. Prices for all options were well
advanced at the opening and in the whirl of
trade the tremendous profit-taking by big
manipulators was disregarded until there was
such a volume of It that It could no - longer
be neglected. Gradually the decline came and
with it some siight lull in trade. December
opened %@y a c higher at 75^@75%c,; sold up to
76'4'576%c. sapged off to 75&c and closed firm
%@*8C up at 75%c. May opened %@%c higher
at 79H@S0c. advanced to the record price for
the crop at 80%c. sank back to 73Â»,4c and re
acting slightly closed firm '/4c up^at 79%c.
Natural conditions, backed up by the strong
bullish speculation, held corn well up to the
best advances of any of. the pits. Cables were
strong, the cash demand â  was lively and the
country at large wanted the cereal badly. Out
side markets â¢ were constantly buying corn at
prices considerably above this market and
prominent traders hold that inasmuch as Chi
cago holds the majority of old ' corn dealers
in the country must come to this market to
buy. A*, in wheat buying orders . came from
all sides and sent prices , up to new record
prices. The general range was nearly lc over
yesterday ' and . the biggest part of. this . was
firmly held. In this pit also big realizing for
profits was under way. but the effect was hard
ly apparent. May started ln . spurts. %@lc
higher at 67%Â®6Sc. fold t6 â¢ 68%c. reacted and
closed strong. %@y t c up, at 67%@67%c.
The early trade ! in oata was heavy, , with a
heavy active demand by commission houses.
Shippers also bought freely: and frightened
shorts rushed to cover. Acceptances were small
the shipping demand fair. The cash situation
still strong. A great deal' of realizing for
good profits by prominent longs depressed prices
toward the close. -May opened %c higher at

NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â Reaction occurred In

close was unsettled, with Lake Superior quoted
at $16 50@17, electrolytic at $16 37%@16 62% and
casting at $16, the latter being offered at that
figure. A gain of Â£1 was noted in London tin

Â£111 15s and futures at Â£105 5s. A sympathetic
rise took place at New York, bringing spot up

Wheat and " Other. Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign markets continue to
advance, as will be seen by the quotations.
Chicago reported a higher market with pre
vious â¢ conditions. The professionals- realized
heavily and the outsiders, mostly countrymen
and !the general public, bought. The .room
was crowded with country buyers. In other
words, these - two interests we're wild to buy
and â  the professionals ' unloaded . their ' wheat
upon them. At first the market held up, but
the â  heavy professional selling .was too great
and prices | dropped back again. Liverpool did
not follow the Chicago excitement. The,Cin
cinnati Price Current reported the week gen
erally favorable for winter wheat, and the
condition of the crop fair. Rain: Is still-defi
cient . west of . the Mississippi. The Chicago
market " is now ln : the hands of outsiders and
beyond professional . control. In other words.
It Jef like a runawy horse. New -York was
a heavy buyer at' Chicago, but at the close a
lot of long wheat came out on the .decline.-.:/ :â <
The San Francisco market advanced on call,
but fell. back ln sympathy with Chicago, with
an active business. . Shipping wheat advanced
another fraction. . . .

QTJEEW VICTORIA'S HAIR.
Its Profusion, at Her Age, Has Al-
ways Been a Wonder.
Over SO years old Queen Victoria yet
had luxuriant hair, which had for years
1jcen a marvel. The court physician,
following Prof. Unna's discovery, had
treated Her Majesty's scalp with a
ecrm destroying preparation, which he
has always kept secret. It is now
known, however, that the remedy for
dandruff, the germ destroying element,
JjÂ» ( mbodied In Newbro's Herplcide, the
oily hair preparation on the market
that does destroy the dandruff germ.
Without dandruff, hair will grow pro-
fusely, and falling hair will be stopped.

FOG PORTENDS
HEAVY STORM
Southern Farmers Are
Anxious for an Early
Rain.
Crops Are Not , in Danger,
but More Moisture Is
Desired.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5.â Clear and
sunny days with foggy mornings prevail
in this city and vicinity. The Weather
Bureau predicts rain, following; the grad
ual southward trend of the storm now
passing over Northern and Central Cali
fornia. i3torm warnings were this morn
ing sent 1 to north-bound vessels leaving
locel ports. Crops are in good condition,
early oranges and lemons being shipped in
considerable quantity. On neavy land
rain will not be needed for several weeks.
Farmers are plowing and needing rapidly
and a downpour now would start a new
growth of weeds and hinder the work,
ihe ground in the uplands, where the soil
is light and sandy, is drying rapidly and
necos moisture.
FRESNO, Dec. 5.â Several showers of
rain have been received since 5 o'clock
this afternoon and more rain will prob
ably follow. Although the precipitation to
date is less than half of what it was at
this time last 'year crops are growing
rapidly. The abnormally warm weather
and heavy fog which have prevailed and
the showers coming at opportune inter
vals have made the conditions excellent
for agriculture.
BAKERSF1ELD, Dec. 5.â This city this
morning was enveloped in a dense fog and
it was hoped that the much-needed rain
lall would follow, but a few hours later
all was clear and bright and the chances
for a xtorm are not favorable. The farm
ing community is dry plowing and will
sow grain as soon as possible in the hope
thai the cereals may mature. A late sea
sou is generally looked for.
SAN* DIEGO, Dec. 5.â The northern
storm, which it was hoped would find its
way to this end of the State, has not yet
made its appearance here and there are
no indications whatever of rain in the
near future. None of the crops are suf
fering in this locality, but a good rainfall
wculd be welcomed by the husbandmen.
The nights are "foggy, but the days bright
an.i clear. â¢
SANTA ANA. Dec. 5.â Santa Ana Val
ley is experiencing- an unprecedented
weather condition. In the" valley at this
time of the year clear weather prevails,
with occasional showers, but so far this
season there has been but one rainfall,
with heavy fogs night and day. Rain is
needed badly to help plowing. Crops are
in good shape generally, though the heavy
fogs retard orange picking. The ranchers
expect a late season.
STOCKTOX. Dec. 5.â The rain of the
past few days has been of great benefit
to the farming interests, softening the
ground so as to permit of plowing. Green
feed has been especially benefited by the
moisture. The indications now all point
to a propitious season for the farmer.
Crops will be put in early this year; ear
lier than usual, the chances are. During
the night it clouded up and to-day there
is a drizzling rain falling, but dark clouds
overhang this part of the country and a
protracted storm is looked for. The rain
fall up to date is a little less than Â«t
this time last year, but it has come more
opportunely. â¢
SAN JOSE, Dec. 5.â There have been
several slight showers this forenoon and
there is every indication of a heavy down
fall before nislit. The farmers and
orchardists are in fine spirits, for suffi
cient rain has already fallen to permit
plowing and also put the soil in good con
d'tion for grass growing.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 5.â There was a
light rain last night. Rain becran falling
again at 9 o'clock this morning- and has
been coming down steadily during the
day. Rain was needed on -the uplands,
farmers having complained that the
ground was too dry to plow. Now they
are saying there has been a sufficient
precipitation. The rainfall has been gen
eral throughout the valley. There was a
Kght fall of hail in the mountains last
night.
RAINFALL IS GENERAL.
Tcrccast Official Predicts Continu
ance of Stormy Weather. â¢
A considerable amount of rain fell in
San Francisco and throughout the north
ern part of the State yesterday. In Eu
reka there was a steady downpour -all day
and a depth of 1.2 inches was registered.
Exceptionally high winds swept the conn
try in the region cf Cape Mendocino and
the weather was rather rough all along
the coast.
Xo rain fell south of Fresno, but Fore
caster Willson predicts that Southern Cal
ifornia is likely to receive a drenching to
day. Nevada had some rain and a grc;it
deal of windy weather yesterday. Snow
was reported at Baker City in Oregon.
The storm. seems likely to continue for
some time, and the rainfall is expected to
be general throughout the West. The
weather for San Francisco is predicted to
be unsettled to-day.

SOUTHERN REPRESENTATION.
Republicans "Will Caucus to Define
Some Plan of Action.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.âRepresenta
tive Crumpaeker of Indiana is passing a
petition for the calling of a Republican
caucus to define pome plan of action on
the question of the alleged overrepre
sentation in the South. He said to-day
that many of his party were signing and
he had no doubt that two-thirds of the
Republicans were in favor of defining
some policy. The caucus, if called, will
determine two things:
Firstâ Whether the reduction of the
Southern representation is to be made a
Republican policy.
Secondâ What means shall be adopted to
reach the desired end in the quickest and
easiest manner.
Representative Crumpacker Is one of
the original movers of the proposition to
reduce the Southern representation and
Is working in harmony with Representa
tive Moody of Massachusetts, who pre
sented a resolution challenging the Louis
iana delegation.

JUDGES AWARD
POULTRY PRIZES
Chicken Breeders From
All Over State At
tend Show. â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 5.
The poultry show at the Exposition
building continues to attract large
crowds, and among those that attended
to-day were bird and dog breeders from
all over the State.
The collection of high-born domestic
fowls is ihe largest and oest ever got to
gether on the coast. Poultry raisers In
large numbers are attending the show for
the purpose of studying the artificial
hatcheries which are on exhibition in
great variety and in every stage of op
eration.
Five disconsolate Belgian hares, survi
vors of a short-lived but famous fad,
with rare consideration for the feelings
of the many victims of their one-time
popularity, have been given a place in an
out of the way corner of the Exposition
building. The hares seem to realize that
thev are out of tune â with the times and
an "air of gloom surrounds their quarters.
The judges of the poultry and pigeons
have almost completed their work. The
awards in these classes so far as they
have been made are as follows:

Another life was sacrificed yesterday in
â¢ the highbinder war, which opened with
a carnival of blood in Chinatown on
Thanksgiving night. Ah Mew, a member
of the Hip Ying Tong, was shot and
killed by Ping Kong Tong men at Walnut

and resolved to do their bloody work in
localities where their adversaries were in
the minority and the first man to suffer
the sting of their bullets was Ah Mew in
Walnut Grove. . .
When the report of the murder reached
the headquarters of the Hip Yings last
night they immediately dispatched word
to many places on the coast, ordering Its
highbinders to slay Ping Kong Tong men
and raising the*prices that have been
placed on the heads of members of that
tong in this city. When the police heard
of the condition of affairs they renewed
their efforts to prevent bloodshed.
â¢ The Four Families became divided on
the subject of the war at a meeting held
in Waverly place last night. The Jueng
and Quong families detided that they

NAVY REQUIRES
MORE OFFICERS
Captain Sigsbee Shows
Urgent Necessity of
an Increase; .
Desires to Prepare the De
partment for a Possible
Emergency.
CAU, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., "WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â Captain
Sigsbee, chief intelligence officer of the
navy, has significantly compared the per
sonnel of the American service with' that
of Germany in order to show the necea-,
slty of an increase of American naval
officers. Captain Sigsbee's comparison 1 la
made in an official report to Rear Admiral
Crowninshield, chief of the bureau of
navigation, and has occasioned not a lit
tle comment among the officers, who un
derstand the department's desire -to be
prepared for any emergency which may
be precipitated by German eagerness to
establish coaling stations in tho western
hemisphere. Captain Sigsbee says that
Germany "provides for a systematic In
crease in her naval personnel commensu
rate with the increase in material, which
will result in fully providing the German
fleet with educated and trained line offi
cers in the event of hostilities."
Captain Sigsbee presents a table which
shows that the German navy has already
341 more officers, trained and under train
ing to perform line and engineer duties,
than the United States and that this dis
crepancy is increasing at the rate of 179
per year. "The grades in which we are
weakest," he continues, "are those, of
lieutenant, lieutenant junior grade, and
ensign. Germany is stronger by 132, and
while we have but 126 naval cadets who
could be commissioned in an emergency.
Germany has 426, an advantage of 300.
In addition to her preponderance of 133
lieutenants and ensigns for line duty, Ger
many has 167 in those grades for engineer
duty, which increases the weight against
us to 290. as in our service the line in
cludes both duties. It is respectfully sug
gested that the bureau's recommendation
to the department that the personnel be
Increased in regular ratio with the In
crease of material is the only logical sys
tem and that the longer the necessities of
the service are evaded more radical and
costly must be the remedy when It Is at
last forced upon the country."
OAKLAND OFFICIAL
SUCCUMBS TO APOPIiEXn
George H. Carleton, Superintendent
of Fire and Police Telegraph.
System, Dies Suddenly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Dec, 5.
George H. Carleton, for twenty-five
years superintendent of the fire and po
lice telegraph alarm department of Oak
land and a resident of this city for nearly,
r.alf a century, passed away at 4 o'clock;
this afternoon at his residence, 541 Nine
teenth street, having been stricken with
apoplexy shortly after noon yesterday.
Mr. Carleton was taken suddenly 111 al
most immediately after his noonday meal.
The stroke paralyzed the left side. The
physicians who were called offered from,
the outset bare hope for recovery. The
patient's physique was against him, for
he was very large and portly, a striking 1
figure for many years on Oakland' 3
streets.
The announcement of the unexpected
death of the well-known pioneer was a
startling shock to hundreds of citizens
who had been the companions for many
years of Mr. Carleton. His life was In
delibly connected with the growth of O&k
land. He established and developed the*
present excellent police and fire telephone
system of the city, the service being rec
ognized as one of the most thorough and
complete in the United States. For a
quarter of a century it had been his pe
culiar hobby and all of his efforts were*
centered in perfecting the department.
He also had supervision and control over
the electric lighting of the city, and the
excellent system he devised, with the co
operation of John A. Britton of the Oak
land Gas Light and Heat Company, Is one
of ; the best monuments to hia marked
fidelity to duty.

LARGE ADVANCES
IN GRAIN PRICES
Chicago Market Enj oy s
a Temporary Boom
in Cereals.
CHICAGO, Dee. 5.â "King Farmer" has
corrie to Chicago, taken the Board of
Trade by storm and sent prices of all
grains climbing above record prices. Busi
ness, to-day on 'change was' larger and
more spectacular than, it. has been for a
long . time and has rivaled the specula
tive enthusiasm that marked the days of
Hutchinson and the other giants of the
pits.
Natural conditions are back of the up
shoot in prices, but bull speculation has
been tue main incentive. The whole coun
tryside seemed to be waking up to the
ruinous shortage in the corn crop and the
feeding of wheat to stock as a conse
quence has brought buying in that cereal.
General advances have been made in
all options of wheat, corn and oats dur
ing the past several weeks, but the ar
rival of thousands of farmers and stock
men- to visit the livestock exhibition
touched, off. the fuse under all the mar
kets and sent prices booming. To-day the
floor of the board was a spectacular show.
Hundreds of the big countrymen, in fur
overcoats and cowhide boots, had the
courtesies of the exchange and -were all
eagerly "getting into the game." When
professional speculators saw the farmer
grasping opportunities they immediately
began to plunge. Added to this influence
was a flood of general buying orders from
the country, until the outside interests
practically controlled the market.
May wheat touched its record price for
the crop shortly before noon-r selling at
80% cents. Both December and May corn
broke records of the year's standing, De
cember selling at 65 cents and May at 65%
cents. It is rumored there is a corner in
oats, but trade is so large on both , sides
of the market that it is not certain. iu.ay
oats broke another record to-day at 46^4
cents.
Although the transactions on the board
continued on a' very large scale througn
out the session, prices did not hold to
their record marks at the close. It â was
rumored that Moore Bros, had been buy
ing large quantities of wheat for the past
six weeks. George Philipps was reputed
to have secured a large line of long corn,
and James Patten, Mayor of Evanston,
was supposed to have control of- oats. At
the " high prices enormous amounts of
grain came out in all pits,, supposedly
from these operators. Prices rapidly sag
ged as a consequence, and though the
markets were yet firm, the big advances
for the day were in many cases lost!

ernoon at the company's wharf. War
rington and a companion named Allen
Lock were at work together, when the
former had occasion to go to his workbox
in search of some tools. While at the
box, a pistol, which had been in Warring
ton's possession since the strike, was ex
posed to the view of Lock, who asked
permission to examine it. While the ex
amination was going on Lock pulled the
trigger and sent a bullet into the stom
ach of his companion. The injured man

tion is serious.

TITLE TO SITE
IS IN QUESTION
Order Vacating Streets
Alleged to Be'
* Invalid.
Budd Says Union Iron Works
Is Built on a Public
Thoroughfare.
Ex-Governor Budd, as attorney for, the
State Harbor Commissioners, has been
looking up the records of the Board of
Supervisors in the course of his prepara
tion to oppose the closing of Napa street
in the interests of the Risdon and Union
Iron works,' and he has found what he
considers errors. that invalidate the order
adopted seventeen years ago by which
certain- streets . at the site of the "Union
Iron Works were vacated. If his conten
tion be correct numerous shops of the
great shipbuilding plant are built on pub
lic streets, without even a lease to pro
tect the owners. . â  â¢â¢ '" _ â¢
Budd appeared before the Street Com
mittee oi the Board of Supervisors yes
terday morning and stated that thd Har
bor Commissioners desired to be heard
in opposition to the petition for the clos
ing of Napa street. He said that in 18&J
Butte street had been closed by what he
believed to have been an irregular order,
and that the Union Iron WorKs had im
mediately gobbled it up and built shop3
on it. It was probable, he said, that tno
closing of Napa street would be fol
lowed by the erection of shops on an
other oi the thoroughfares giving a
means of access, to the seawall when it
shall be built along that portion of the
water front.
The members of the Street Committee
informed the attorney that the Napa-.
street petition had been referred to the
Judiciary Committee.' Budd will appear
before that committee this afternoon at
4 o'clock. * â  â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢- . * '
Governor Budd explained later that the
defect which he believed he had discov
ered in the order to vacate Butte street
lay in the failure to follow the provision
of the general law which states' that a
street may not be .vacated except for the
"public welfare and convenience." The
order in question, he said, stated ' that
the closing of the street would result In
great benefit to the city and county of
Ban Francisco,- leaving the public in gen
eral out of the Question.
The resolution to which Budd refers
was adopted by the Supervisors Febru
ary 15, 1884, just before the establishment
of the shipbuilding plant of the Union
Iron Works. It vacated not only a por
tion of Butte street, but also portions of
Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana streets,
none of which were in actual use as
streets and which were necessary to the
establishment of the ship yards on that
site. The clause of the order which Budd
considers defective Is as follows:
Whereas, It is the opinion of this board that
this city and county of San Francisco will'de
rive irreat benefit from the closing of the
streets aforesaid, inasmuch as it is done with
a view to encouraging; a manufacturing in
dustry of immense magnitude, to the success
ful prosecution of which the closing of said
streets is absolutely necessary, to wit: | the
building ol/steel and iron ships, an Industry
which if fostered will tend â  to the material
advantage and proaperity of the -city and
county, of San Francisco and of the State :of
California. â  ; . - ;. .. . ...
! Governor Budd holds that since the
language of the statute, "public welfare
and convenience," is not followed in the
recital the streets involved - have never
been legally vacated, and that it may. be
come the duty of the Harbor Commis
sioners to demand that they be kept open
whenever the seawall at. that point be
built.
On the line of Butte street are some of
the Union Iron Works' most important
shops, including the coppersmith shop,
the blacksmith shop, a large machine
shop, the "bending" shop and the cellu
lose factory.

â¢ . The Caldarella family feud formed the

baniss yesterday afternoon, when George

TO BE PRESENTED AT

William M. Bunker, as Delegate From
Chamber of Commerce, Leaves
,- ' ' \ " for Washington.
William M. . Bunker, trustee of "the
Chamber of Commerce, left for,Washing
ton, D. C. , last night to represent . that
body at the present session of Congress.
It has been felt for some time by the
leading commercial men of San Francisco
that the local commercial interests should
be better represented at the National
Capital, but until 'recently no steps were
taken looking toward . this end.
The Chamber of Commerce finally de
cided to send a member of the organiza
tion without assistance from the other
commercial bodies. San Diego has for
some time maintained a representative at
Washington and Seattle keeps two m6n
there permanently.
Mr. Bunker does not intend to return to
this city for a year at least. He will. be
on the scene of action and means to keep
thoroughly posted in all matters pertain

FORMER SENATOR BOYCE
MAY SUCCEED GLEAVES
Is Asked if He Would Accept the Office oi
United States Surveyor General.
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
N. W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â
Senator Bard to-day telegraphed
ex-State Senator John J. Boyce
of Santa Barbara, asking him if
he would accept the office of United States
Survej'or General for California, to suc
ceed the late General J. M. Gleaves. The
query was sent after agreement had been
reached upon Boyce by Senators Perkins
and Bard and after conference with' the
President. The California Congressmen
were not consulted regarding the selec
tion.
The tender of the Surveyor Generalship
to Senator Boyce Is believed to have an
Important bearing upon the question of
the continuance in office or removal of
Collector of Internal Revenue Lynch.
President Roosevelt has informed Bard
end Perkins that they must agree upon a
successor to Lynch if he is to be removed
and that if they cannot settle the ques
tion between them he will ask the advice
of the California Congressmen. The Con
gressmen assert that they will not con
sent to be called in to settle a draw be
tween the Senators unless they are to be
consulted in all cases of California ap
pointments.
The tender of the Surveyor Generalship
to Senator Boyce was made without con
sultation with the Congressmen, the Sena
tors evidently still feeling able to take
care of the Federal patronage due to Cali
fornia. If the Congressmen stick by their
assertions it will now devolve upon Bard
and Perkins to find a new man upon whom
they can agree as a successor to Collector
Lynch.
Senator Perkins' approval of Boyce for
the Surveyor Generalship is regarded as
an attempt to mollify Senator Bard, in
the nope that he will now be willing to
cease his efforts to have Lynch removed
Boyce was Bard's choice for the office that
has been offered the former California
State Senator and the acquiescence of
Senator Perkins is looked upon as a step
in the direction of harmony between the
two Senators from the Golden State.
BOYCE AN ABLE MAN.

BANK ATTACHES
TANNERS' FUNDS
Garnishees Large Sums
Belonging to McKay
Company.
An attachment was levied yesterday on
alL the money which the McKay Tanning
Company of Benlcia has on deposit in the
Wells, Fargo & Co. Bank, and also that
which is due the company from. Bucking
ham & Hecht. The suit is beyfg brought
by D. O. Mills & Cb.'s" National Bank of
Sacramento. In the Wells-Fargo Bank
the McKay Tanning Company has to its
credit $197,000, all of which is included in
the attachment.
A telegram from Sacramento says the
announcement that the national bank of
D. O. Mills & Co. had attached the funds
of the McKay Tanning Company did not
surprise the business community of that
city, which has been aware for some time
of the embarrassment which had over
taken the tanning company.
The matter has an Important bearing
In Sacramento, aside from the bank's con
nection with it, because of the fact that
the soap manufacturing business of the
W. R. Knights Company of Sacramento
and the McKay Tanning Company at
Benicla are owned by the same peopleâ
W. R. Knights, W. D. Knights, John
Blair- and James Blair.
Both corporations, it was learned from
officials of the D. O. Mills bank, are In
financial trouble on account of losses en
tailed by the tanning company in its sales
of leather for several years. *
The entire indebtedness of the company
is said to be less than $150,000, of which
about $50,000 is owing to the national
bank of D. O. Mills & Co. of Sacramento,
which is secured by collateral notes
amounting to $197,000, upon which it
brought the attachment suit.
The remaining debts are owing to the
bank of Wells, Fargo & Co., the Bank of
California and Sumner & Co. of San
Francisco and John McFarland of Gait,
Sacramento County. It is said that the
creditors and debtors are close to a set
tlement on a, basis of about 60 cents on
the dollar. The Capital Soap Company of
Sacramento, although owned by the same
parties as the tannery, is not in financial
troubles. The McKay Tanning Company
has about $50,000 of good assets, consist
ing of leather, cash in bank and accounts
due it from Buckingham & Hecht and
others.
W. D. Knights of the embarrassed firm"
was a representative of Sacramento
County In the last Legislature. He and
his business colleagues have always etood
high In the business community of that
city and their reverses are attributed to
their taking the earnings of ' the local'
soap company to make up for the losses
at the Benicla tannery, which has proved
a bad investment.

MAKES A DASH
FOR LIBERTY
Detectives Have Exciting
Chase After Frank
Contferas.
The police were notified a short time
ago that a man of good appearance was
in the habit of calling at lodging houses
and, on the pretext of getting a glass
*of water, stealing whatever he could
lay his hands on during the landlady's
temporary absence. Detective Crockett
got a good description of the man and
decided that he was Frank Contreras,
who has served several terms for petty
larceny. \
Crockett was fortunate In meeting Con
treras yesterday afternoon about 1 o'clock
and promptly placed him under arrest.
Contreras did not offer any resistance
and went along quietly till the corner of
California and- Kearny streets was
reached. Then Contreras made a dash
for liberty and dashed along Kearny
northward, with the object of reaching
a place of safety among friends in tho
Latin quarter, where he is well known.
The detective started in pjursult and
blew his whistle as he ran, but no one
joined in the chase. Crockett is a big
man, but showed that he Is possessed of
good sprinting powers, and Con,treras,
seeing that he would probably be over
hauled, darted into a saloon near Jack
son street, , where he was cornered and
Crockett put the handcuffs on him. He
was taken to the City Prison and placed
in the "tanks" pending identification by
his victims. His last exploit was to steal
a valuable watch belonging to a landlady
who supplied him with a glass of water.
Contreras comes of excellent family,
but has apparently decided upon a career
of crime. His grandfather- was a gen
eral in the American army, and the pris
oner has wealthy . relatives in this city.
He has been out of the County Jail, only
two months.
Son of Edward Boss Dies.
The little son" of Edward Ross, concern
ing whose sad condition an account ap
peared iii yesterday's papers, died yes
terday. Mr. Boss desires it to be under
stood, however, that though in straight
ened circumstances,* he is not the recipi
ent of charity, as stated.

MRS. COARUM'S
TRIAL BEGINS
Self-Defense Is the Plea
of the Woman Who
Shot Daniels.
The trial of Mrs. Catherine Coarum,
the white wife of a colored cook on the
steamer Umatilla, for the murder on
April 9, 1901, of a watchman named
Charles Daniels at her residence. at 1133%
Clay street, was commenced In Judge
Dunne's court yesterday.
Mrs. Coarum, who, in the absence of
her husband, who was at sea, .was en
joying herself in the company of Daniels,
killed the watchman at her residence
after he and she had . disposed of several
bottles of beer. . She fired three shots at
him in the kitchen of the house where
they were carousing', killing him instant
ly. She then dragged his body to the
basement of the house and secreted It.
The next day one of her neighbors, hear
ing the woman crying, notified a police
man, who entered the house and searched
the premises. He found the woman cry
ing hysterically over Daniels' body and
arrested her on the charge of murder.
The pistol with which the crime had been
committed was found in the room where
the shooting occurred. When Mrs. Coarum
recovered Irom her spree she claimed
Daniels had fired a shot at her and that
she killed him in self-defense.
Coaruih, the woman's husband, was the
only witness examined yesterday. He
said he married the accused woman at
Liverpool in 1874 and came with her to
this city in 1884. It was while he was
at sea that the shooting occurred. He
testified thatiten days after the affair he
went to his home and made a search of
the house.
In the kitchen where Daniels was killed
he found a razor, closed and in its case,
and under, the steps leading to the base
ment he said he found a bullet, which
corresponded in size and shape to the
three taken from the body of Daniels. A
further search, said Coarum, resulted in
his finding a bullet hole in the steps.
The bullet found by Coarum was placed
in evidence, the lawyers hoping to prove
by it that the woman took Daniels' life
after he had fired a shot at her.
The case was continued at this point
until Monday at 10 a. m. .

GEORGE ALDRICH IS SANE IN FACT
BUT LAW SAYS HE IS INCOMPETENT
George Aldrlch, a j wealthy young
man, who mingles In good .society and
who, according to medical examiners. Is
gifted with about the same amount of in
telligence as the rest of humanity, finds
himself confronted with the statement
from the Supreme Court that he is legally
insane. Mr. Aldrich is, however, a young
gentleman of easy disposition, who does
not care If he Is legally Insane.
Aldrlch's parents were Hawallans and
related to the illustrious Queen LJliuoka
lani. His father acquired a considerable
amount of property, which was be
queathed to the children. George was at
that time thought to be insane, but $125,
000 was given to him in trust. He was to
receive the benefit of the Income so long
as his mental disability lasted, and If ho
should recover he waa to get the whole
amount. If at the time of his death he
should '.still be insane, the money was to
go to the other children.
Aldrich was educated at Stevens Insti
tute of Technology, Hoboken, N. J. It is
stated that while there he developed an
extraordinary ability to spend money. It
is alleged that he then became weak men
tally and shortly afterward became dan
gerous. Judge Hamilton of Alameda sent
him to Napa Insane Asylum in 1888. Al
drich escaped once, but was recaptured.
His father died and he was paroled. Dr
Gardner Is reported to have said that he
considered the young man sane, although
dangerous symptoms might again set in.
These symptoms as far as is known, have
not appeared as yet, and ten years have
elapsed.-
An effort to establish Aldrich' s sanity
was made once before and the examining
physicians reported favorably, but the
young fellow became too anxious waiting
for a- decision and wrote to the Judge
promising a large amount of money for
his legal freedom. When this occurred,
It seemed preferable that he be still ad-
Judged insane. Proceedings were again
instituted in the Superior Court of this
city, but Judge Troutt* decided that he
had no Jurisdiction over the case. Peti
tion was made to the Supreme Court for
a writ of mandate which would make a
hearing compulsory.
This petition the Supreme Court has de
nied, not that Aldrich Is insane, but by
reason of legal technicalities. The court
suggests that a writ of habeas corpus
might be obtained, but Attorneys Wood
worth and Spottswood, who represent the
young man, fall to see how they can ask
for a writ when their client is already
free. They have attempted to make the
asylum people place the young man in
confinement, and the habeas corpus pro
ceedings would be in order. The asylum
authorities claim, however, that they
have no right to imprison him. The mat
ter seems to be in a hopeless tangle and
no way to settle It ia apparent to the
lawyers. â  â¢
Since Aldrich has been at liberty he
has traveled over a large part of the
world. He Is 33 years of age. For some
time past ' he has resided at the Grand
