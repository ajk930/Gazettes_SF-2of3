BEHIND A SYNDICATE
,Mrs. Hancock recites how on one occa
sion' she watched for her husband at the
Laguna-street flat at night time, and that
he came out without his overcoat. Mrs.
Hancock demanded that he go back and
get his coat and go home with hÂ»r. Han
cock refused, and the angry wife ranjr the
bell of the house and had sharp wonls
with Mrs. Westcott, who Is described In
the complaint as having on that occasion
worn "a loose silk -robe only." The wife
secured her husband's coat, and when she
returned to her hubby on the sidewalk ha
"Wore Loose Silk Robe.
Mrs. Hancock alleges that her husband
maintained Mrs. Westcott In gorgeous
style during 1S09-1900 In flats at 1719 Suttel
street and 1904 Laguna street and in apart
ments at 1098 Pine street, and also
charges that the couple were guilty of Il
licit relations on divers and many occa
sions.

union that commences where words fall and
truth is felt.

Joined Mrs. Westcott. - He is charged with
having visited his wife for a couple of

PROMINENT CLUBMAN AND
THE WOMAN WHOM HE - 13
' SAID TO LOVE.
Four years ago Mr. Williams was a very
Kick man. His physician told him that he
needed the quiet, peaceful air of Oakland
to restore him to health, and so he took
a house at Eighth and Oak streets and
P<?ttled down in it to regain health and
strength.
Once in Oakland, Mr. Williams saw a
groat deal of the Stoele family. They wel
comed him cordially to their home and
clld much to make his existence easier
and happier. It was during these days
that the well-known racing man began to
observe Miss JJeatrice. the eldest daughter
of the house. From a kindly interest Wil
liams passed easily into a sincere friend
ship, and then, two years ago, he discov
ered that he had crossed the narrow bor
der line and was In the snares of the
mischievous little god of love.
Last summer Miss Steele, with her
mother and sister, spent the summer at
holds his heart meant no more to Wil
liams than any other maid until a very
fr-vr years ago.
The lady who will shortly become the
bride of Thomas H. Williams Jr. 'is the
**I will go with a few racetrack frlendr
to my home in Oakland and from there
will go with them to Miss Steele's home."
said Mr. "Williams as he Joyfully explained
his plans. "There we will be married
quietly. There will be no white satin, no
orange blossoms, no fuss and no feathers.
After the ceremony my wife and I wi'l
catch the 6 o'clock train, come over to tho
city, have dinner and then'" go : to the
Orpheum. "We will settle down quietly in
ray Oakland home, and later perhap3,
when the racetrack war is over, we will
go off on a short little trip.". . rÂ».-
It Is to be a very quiet wedding. "Wil
liams has attended to all the details and
Miss Steele has acquiesced to all his ar
rangements.
Mr. Williams' camp and it was then and
there that Williams decided to win the
pirl he loved for his wife. The announce
ment of their betrothal tells how gallantly
he wooed and nobly won.
I do so much . want to have you come, you
have Â¦ no Idea how I want . you now. - I was
truly sorry I- did not kiss you good-by. You
had your veil on and _ I . was < mad with ; myself
that "lack "of ; reeerve 'force '" did rattle ' me. I
The plaintiff accuses her. husband of
having in June, 1S99, gone on a trip to. the
southern part of the . State accompanied
by.'Mrs. Westcott, and produces the fol
lowing letter to show how Hancock asked
his fair friend to join him:
After the Lake Tahoe trip, it Is alleged.
Hancock furnished a flat for. Mrs. West
cott at 1719 Sutter street and there main
tained illicit relations with its occupant. .
Mrs. Hancock tells In her complaint how
In August, 1898, her husband went on a
business trip to Slerraville ' f or a month.
That Is what he told her, but she alleges
that. he. spent the time at Lake Tahoe
with Lei Westcott. who took her little
boy and her. sister Hallie along. ..-
The plaintiff then recites how her hus
band . Installed the fair Lei in a sumptu
ous fiat at 1306A Hayes street, and that
he there assumed the position of protec
tor for the dove in the lover's bower.
Makes Many Accusations.
In August, 1897, Mr. and Mrs. Hancock
visited Altruria with Hancock's mother.
Mrs. Lei Westcott went along with the
party, and the complaint alleges that the
conduct of Hancock and Mrs. Westcott
was indiscreet on many occasions during
this summer vacation.
Â¦Â¦ The complaint recites how Lei Westcott
visited the home of the plaintiff and her
husband and .how Hancock openly showed
his admiration for the fair singer. When
Hancock would, after, the- visits, escort
Mrs. "Westcott to the" cars he would linger
longer than necessary, and the plaintiff
gradually shows how the, minutes length
ened out to hours.
The suit filed by Mrs. Hancock, through
Attorneys Galpln and Bolton, Is a remark
able one; as it bristles with charges of In
fidelity against the spouse.. of the plaintiff
and names Mrs. .Lei "Wescott and Carrie
King as being his inamoratas.* The name
of Carrie King figures but once on the
complaint, while Mrs." Lei Westcott. either
by name or as "Jane Doe," is'mentloned

ument'; now 'in the archives of County
Clerk Deane.- -, ', -.â¢...-Â«--'Â» i~-

half : my property- or , an 'allowance more
than I gave her while; we lived together.
As '.regards the lady â¢ mentioned in my
wife's. complaint I will say nothing. This
is not a suit for divorce. I think It shame
ful that this. lady's name should be drag
ged-into the matter. ' If my wife wants an
allowance It ' would have been sufficient
for-her and her lawyers to have alleged
that I left my wife and ask for a certain
sum." â¢ â¢ â¢: .

Robert Hancock gallantly says nothing
in disparagement of his wife and the
mother of his child./ He denied yesterday
that she-had been violent or Jealous to
ward him, and begged that nothing might
be said as coming. from" him which mlgnt
hurt his wife's; feelings. Hancock admits
that he: left his i home some months ago,
but denies that he ever refused a, proper
allowance to -his wife. He declared posi
tively, however, that he would fight to
the end any suit of his wife for a division
Of property or an allowance of 5500 per
month, which she asks for.
Mrs. Hancock yesterday denied herself
to all callers. She gave orders that no
one should be admitted to her home with
out her consent and declined to be inter
viewed.' - .
As worshipers at the California-street
Methodist Episcopal Church, Mr. and Mrs."
Hancock met Lei Westcott. She was
known as Mrs. Westcott and church gorj
slp said that she was a divorcee. Her con
duct was beyond reproach and the ' fair
singer was received in the homes of tha
leading members of the congregation.
Thus it was that the small cloud began
to appear on the sea of matrimony of
Hancock and his wife and which has now
assumed the aspecjt and proportions of a
tornado which threatens to wreck the
happiness cf two of Cupid's mariners and
a dainty child of 9 years, the offspring of
Robert J. Hancock and his pretty girl
wife.
Mrs. Westcott Sings in Church.
Hancock and his wife, after extensi-.e
traveling, had settled down to domestic
;ife in, a beautiful house at 928 Broderick
street and every wish of fchÂ«s wife was
gratified by the young husband. Hancock
denied his wife nothing and" the home was
filled with rare and costly bric-a-brac and
the thousand and one things so dear to
femininity. / Â¦* â¢_% -â¢' Â¦Â¦;'-
Robert J. Hancock is a familiar figure
in athletic and club circles and when. lie

1889, it was thought by the friends of taÂ«
young couple that a;llfe of bliss and joy,
was before the bridal pair. â¢ For .almost
six years there was not a ruffle on the sen
of matrimony. Then in 1S95 a small cloud
appeared. Mrs. Hancock became Jealoas

view in the Inter Mountain this evening
A. A. Campbell of Pryor, who is in charge
of the Pryor Creek sub-agency on the
Crow reservation, states that there are
600 cases of smallpox in the vicinity of
Pryor and that strenuous efforts are be
ing made to stamp the disease out. He
asserts that Billings has forty cases of
the disease, and that with its own cases
and the reservation cases, the detention
hospital there has become so overcrowded
that hundreds of cases are being cared for
privately. The epidemic has reached a
point where the County Commissioners
have determined to erect a pesthouse near
Pryor. A singular fact in this connection
is that up to date not a single Indian has
contracted the disease.
"On Pryor Creek and the Crow reserva
tion about COO persons are quarantined,"
paid Mr. Campbell. "The first case broke
out In Timothy's camp two months ago.
Then the disease extended to McShane's
camp and soon afterward3 to O'Connor's.
As yet every case has been of a mild
character. Everything- possible Is being
done to keep the men from leaving work
and scattering smallpox throughout tho
State. The Indians were all taken up
Pryor Creep when the disease first broke
out. but now they will have to be moved,
as smallpox has made Its appearance on
the upper part of the reservation."
Although the Disease Is Prevalent Near Crow
Reservation the Indians Are Not Affected.

The wreckage near the boiler and in the
east part of the building at once took
lire and through the blinding clouds of
dust and smoke and escaping steam could
be seen, struggling men and women, some
of them half burled In wreckage, others
feebly endeavoring to climb. to some place
of safety, while from various parts of the
ruins came cries for help.
The Work of Rescue.
The Fire Department soon extinguished
the flames and the work of rescue began
at once. One by one the wounded and
bleeding girls were carried to nearby
stores where they were giyen hasty medi
cal attention, being then taken to hos
pitals In ambulances. The dead bodies
were conveyed to tho Morgue. In two
Instances the corpses were so frightfully
mangled that a clothes basket was used
to carry them out. At the Morgue the
bodies were identified by relatives.
Most of the dead were found in the east
end of the building; where the fire raged
the fiercest. Pinioned under tons of heavy
timbers, crushed and mangled almost be
yond identification, and In one or two in
stances half cooked, were found five of
the dead. The wreckage at this point
was so massed that the firemen had great
difficulty In working, and it will be
nightfall before the bottom of the mass
can be reached and the remaining dead,
if any more are in the ruins, recovered.
All of the dozen - or more little stores
attached to the Waverley Theater, facing
on Madison street, were wrecked by the
explosion, and in one of them, a'restau
rant owned by Peter Dean, one " of tho
fntalities Is supposed to have occurred.
The roar of the restaurant was almost
opposite the boiler. Dean, his wife and
two boys were eating breakfast at tho
time of the explosion,* which blew in the
rear wall of the little establishment, bury

extricated. *

/f T 1ST: W.. WASHINGTON. March 11.
IL^ * âThe Washington papers of Sun-
day. had full column accounts of
the call made on the President last
Saturday by a California committee. JJot
only was the purpose of the visit set forth
as being to discuss the new plague report
affecting San Francisco, but purported de
tails of the Interview were- given, and It
was affirmed that no other subject en
gaged the attention of the President ana
the committee during their entire con
tact. ' . " ,,.
The Washington Times to-day follow*
the subject editorially, making the re
markable statement,- applied to San Fran
cisco, that there have been 40,000 cases of
the plague and 18,000 deaths since Novem
ber. To-day there have been made ex
hibits to the administration that were not
thought of by the Ca.lfornla committee,
to the effect that during the past year,
while existence of the plague in SanFran^
cisco has been charged by scientific men
who have no closer acaualntance with'the
disease than In books and pictures, San
Francisco has been ir.ore healthy than
usual, with no excess in the" death rate
and a specially low death rate in China
town, where the scientific eye has founO
the plague to be exclusively confined.
President and Cabinet Coming." '
A little face to face cornmon sense some
times amounts to more than a deal of long
range science, and this bit of vital sta
tistics makes the extravagant statement of
the Times look like bubonic journalism.
That the President Is not In the slightest
degree alarmed by plague rumors is
shown by the pending preparations for
his trip to California, during which ho
will spend more time In San Francisco
than elsewhere on the coast. This sub
ject was not discussed with the bubonic
committee. The President will be accom
panied by the entire Cabinet, except At
torney General Grlggs, who will retire as
soon as his successor can be decided uprm.
" The party will go out by a southern and
return by a northern route, taking In the
Yellowstone Park. It is intended to make
the trip a sort of useful official inspection
of the country. Some of the secretaries
have never made the grand tour of the
Union and are glad to combine a holiday
with a work day. -by coming in contact
with the coast interests with which they
are concerned.
To Yos?mite and Big Trees.
It Is known here to-day that the Fed
eral officers in California are proposing a
programme supplementary to that ar
ranged by the other committee, as to
which they were not consulted. They will
offer the tntlre party &â¢ trip to the Yo
semite Valley, going in by Raymond and
coming out by Big Oak Flat. This will
give the President an-J Cabinet not only
the pleasure of seeing the greatest scenery
in the world, but of inspecting two of the
big tree groves, the Marlposa and Cala
veras, and of seeing the forest reserva
tions about which the Secretary cf tre
Interior is continually pestered by sheop
men who want it ooen for grazing. The
Secretary desires the opportunity to con
trast the condition of the forest and its
floor within the reservations with the con
ditions in the open forest. The Federal
officers* plan is llkdiy ta be quite popular,
as there is more real holiday In a moun-
The published reports of the existence of ba
>KÂ»nlo plague in San Francisco should excite no
alarm there or In the country at large The
plague is not epidemic there, And I do not be
lieve it will be. I would feel as safe living In
San Francisco as in "Washington. The traveling
and business public can communicate as safely
with San Franciico to-day as a year ago. The
Treasury Department is fully advised of thÂ«
situation and speaks with confidence In deny
ing that any occasion for alarm exists on ac
count of health conditions in San Francisco
Any statement that the Treasury Department
or surgeon general's department has taken
charge of thÂ« health affairs In San Francisco
is absolutely and unqualifiedly false.
Assistant Secretary Spauldlng also gave
out a statement as follows:
California is doing her duty; she has no
epidemic now and never had; there has not
been a report of a supposed case of, plague for
twenty-three days, and the death rate in China
town is now the lowest It has bÂ»en for tea
years.
Some disputes having arisen between the au
tnoritlr* ne to the health conditions In Califor
nia and the quarantine at San Francisco, a
commission was appointed by Governor Gase
and Mayor Phelan to confer with the health
autnoritiesr at Washington. Meetings have beÂ»n
heM with Secretary of the Treasury Lytnan J.
Gage. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury O
L. Spauldinjr and Surgeon General W'yman. at
which it was elicited that no single case of dls-
had ever been found in California of the
bubo-pneumonic type-, and that all cases exam
ired (none belnr of white people) were of a non
contagious character. The FedeTal authorities
have expressed themselves as amply satisfied
that California is able to protect the other
States of the Union and herself from any
species of epidemic, and. Instead of a condition
existing that calls for Federal interference, the
report of the surgeon general's office now In
San Francisco is in hearty accord with the city
anri State health authorities.
WASHINGTON, March ll.-In view of
the persistent reports that bubonic
plague existed in San Francisco the Treas
ury Department some weeks ago appoint
ed a committee of experts to examine into
and report upon the situation there. That
report has been received at the Treasury
Department, but the authorities are not
disposed to make it public at this time.
Almost simultaneously with the receipt of
the report a delegation of prominen? citi
zens of San Francisco arrived here and
have since had a number of conferences
with treasury officials in regard to the
matter. This committee gave out ths fol
lowing statement:

NEW YORK. March 11.â The
speech of President Hadley of
Yale at Boston last night has
caused v/ldcspread comment.
That portion of the noted edu
cator's address which has aroused the
greatest attention was:
"We shall have an emperor In Wash
ington within twenty-five yearB unless we
can create a public sentiment which, re
gardless of legislation, will regulate the
trusts."
William J. Bryan ia one of those who
shares President Hadley's views In regard
to imperial tendencies. He said.:
"The sentiment of 90 per cent of the
people is against horse-stealing, but that
would not have the slightest effect upon
the horse itself if it was not enacted into
a law against horse-stealing. There
might be an overwhelming preponderance
of public Eentiment against trust monop
olies, but the manager of this sort of a
rr^>nopoly would have no trouble In find
11: plenty of his own kind to agree with
h'n and public sentiment would bo of no
avail against trusts. Public sentiment
must be expressed in laws to be power-

Senator Mark Hanna â Professor Hadley
seems to state his views at some length,
but they are simply opinions of an imprac
tical man. Further comment is unneces
sary.
WASHINGTOX, March 11.â The long
expected answer from the British Gov
ernment to the State Department's com
munication reciting the action of the Sen
ate upon the Hay-ruuncefote treaty was
leiurned at noon to-day.
Lord Paur.ecfote, the British Embassa
dor, had already acquainted Secretary
Hay with the fact that he had received
a communication from his Government
on the subject, and it had been in his
ixissession for several days. Secretary
liay had acquired a general knowledge
of the character of lhe' liriiish response.
Iyird Fauncefote went to the State De
partment at noon by appointment. He
tock the at;s\ver witn him and sent it to
Secretary Hay. It was in the form of
an instruction from .Lord Lansdowr.e, the
British Minister of Foreign Affairs, to
Lord Piiuncefote, and of these instruc
tions he left a copy with Secretary liay.
The Secretary and the Embaseador were
closeted for hall an' hour. At the conclu
sion of the conference it was stated that
the instruction to Lord Pauncefote was
to notify the Government of the United
States that the British Government did
not see its way clear to the acceptance of
the Senate amendments.
The British answer is long, as such
documents go. ajid would make about
two newspaper columns. The tone of the
reply is distinctly friendly throughout,
particularly so in the concluding assur
ances of good will and a desire to co
operate In the realization of the under
taking. !
Amendments Are Eejectsd.
Although the text is withheld, it Is
understood that the answer takes up the
three amendments made by the Senate
end presents the difficulties in the way
of asf-iining to them. As to the amend
ment whicti struck out all that clause of
the treaty inviting other maj-ltime na
tions to concur in the neutralizing of tho
canal, the British view is that while the
I'nited States and Great Britain can bind
themselves by treaty to neutralize the
canal, they cannot make this action bind
ing on all other governments, unless these
governments consent.
As to the entire abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty as provided by one of
the Senate amendments. It appears to be
the British view that such a step is too
far-reachirs to be taken until each side of
the case is presented.
The so-called Davis amendment appears,
however, to be the chief obstacle in the
way of an agreement, and while the Brit
ish answer makes no suggestion of any
further negotiation it seems to be a fair
inference from its general tenor that if a
modification of this amendment could be
secured there could probably be an ad
justment upon the other points of differ
ence. A reading of the answer makes
plain that while it does not make counter
propositions, or propose further action,
yet it does not preclude such action by
laying down a course which will be ad
hered to without the slightest deviation.
On the contrary, the answer takes the
form of an argument tending to show
that the amendments proposed by the
Senate do not fairly consider the various
liritish interests involved and that for
that reason they cannot be accepted in
the form presented. There is nothing per
emptory in the tone of the answer.
Two Years of Negotiation.
The Hay-Pa uncefote negotiations have
been in progress for something over two
years, and. owing to the great interests
involved, they Lave constituted the lnter
rational question at issue before the
State Department. The treaty was signed
prior to the opening of the Fifty-sixth
Congress, and was submitted to the Sen
ate in December, 1S93. It at once encount
ered opposition in that body, but, after
pome delay, was finally ratified after sev
tr.il amendments had been adopted.
The chief issue was tnade on what was
known as the Davis amendment. While
in terms this did not pive the United
States a right to fortify the canal, yet in
peneral language it expressed the" right of
this country to adopt such measures in re
gard to the canal as were deemed,neces
pary for the proper maintenance of Amer
ican authority. After extended debate in
executive pension two other amendments
wore adopted and the treaty was ratified
as amended. The other two amendments
abrogated the Oayton-Bulwer treaty and
rtruck out the provision of the treaty
which invited other foreign governments
to express their approval of it.
As the amendments created conditions
Â¦w-hici. the British Government had not
concurred in when the original treaty was
made it was necessary to present the in
strument in its amended form to that
Government for its approval. It is under
stood that one moving consideration in
the minds of the British statesmen who
considered the answer to be made was
that thÂ«ir determination affected not only
Groat Britain and her interests in g-eneral
but all the maritime nations of Europe
and of the world at large, as the complete
neutralizing: of the rarsal under the terms
of the treaty would have the effect of con
ferring: the same ripht* and usage to Ger
many. France and other nations that were
enjoyed by Great Britain. It was rather
in the character of trustee for the mari
time nations that the amended treaty was
considered.
Feared a Loss of Bights.
Furthermore, an important considera
tion was piven to the effect of the new in-
Ftrumfint in completely wiping: out the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the rights
Great Hrita'n claimed under that docu
ment. Some of the British ftatesmen held
there shculd be a quid pro quo if British
claims under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
Â¦were surrendered. It was also held that
Great Britain had certain vested rights
in Central America which had given place
to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so that if
the treaty was to b<Â» succeeded by some
thing less substantial, then the old vested
rights of Great Britain were obliterated
without any adequate return.
The effect of the British answer cannot
be to restore the life of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty, as far as now appears. . That
document had a distinct limitation within
which it could be ratified, and no doub
seemed to exist among officials that the
period expired when the Senate adjourned.
The answer is chiefly important, there
fore. In raakinj? clear the attitude of the
British Government along-side the attitude
of the American Government. With the
two poFitions thus clearly defined it re
mains to bo poen whether the United
Btn.tr* Government will carry on euch
further negotiations as may reconcile dif
ferences and bring about a common
ground of action.
CANAL MAY BE CONSTRUCTED.
Senator Morgan Expects That Great
Britain Will Remain Passive.
WASHINGTON. March 11.â Senator
Morgan of Alabama, father of the Nlcar
apua Canal project in Congress, in eom
m^ntlnpr upon the action of Great Britain
in rejecting the amended Hay-Pauncefote
trÂ«Â»Biy. paid to-nisht:
"If it ia true, as I hope it is. that our
canal rights In Nicaragua and Costa

potiationp on the initiative of Great Brit
ain, wÂ«> shall proceed quietly to construct,

Britain will be left to make her objections
In puch form as she may chooae."

but the Reply Does Not Preclude
th.e Possibility of an
Agreement.

Awaiting Botha's Surrender.
A Pretoria special says: The result of
the negotiations between Lord Kitchener
and General Louis Botha Is" anxiously but
hopefully awaited. The presence of Sir
Alfred Milner in Pretoria to consult with
Lord Kitchener Is expected to hasten the
change from the military to the civil ad
ministration.
A special from Lourenzo MarqueB says:
General Botha Is willing to surrender.
He asked an armistice In order to com
municate with General Dewet and Steyn.
Should they decline, it ia believed, never
theless, that General Botha will, surren
der. The BoeT8 have no artillery am
munition and are buying all their, guns.
The railway from Lourenzo Marques to
Pretoria Is practically clear of Boers.
General Colville's Blunder. ,
In the Houso of Commons yesterday
Charles Macklnnon Douglas, Liberal,
moved for an inquiry regarding the re
tirement of Major General Colville, who
was sent home from South Africa by
Lord Roberts for inefficiency In the field.
Broderick, Secretary of War, replied
that the motion compelled him to eay
things he would prefer to leave unsaid;
but that he would - tell the house the
whole truth. After declaring that he had
nothing to apologize for In the course the
War Office had taken, he proceeded to
criticize General Colville's conduct. He
said:
At Sanna's Post, he said, General Colville
blundered or maneuvered about until his force
was weary, while the Boers carried off guns
unmolested. Lord Roberts thought Colonel
L*roadwood did right, although General Col
ville took exception to Colonel Broadwood's
behavior. General Colville left Colonel Broad
v/ood and his shattered force severely alone
and marched his troops In another direction.
Ho showed a lack of enterprise which lost
him the confidence of Lord Roberts.
Lord Roberts, however, postponed his decis
ion until hÂ» could be fully Informed. Then
came the unfortunate Lumlsy surrender, for
which General Colville was blamable. as he
ought to have attempted to effect relief.
I consulted Lord Roberts regarding the Gib
raltar command and I had no alternative after
the advice rrom Lord Roberts and Sir Evelyn
Wood. I gave General Colville an opportunity
to resign, but he Insisted upon being removed.
I consider General Colville has b*en treated
more leniently than If he had been court
martialed. Kvery possible pressure has been
brought to bear in his favor, but so lone as
I hold office I shall not give way to such
clamor.

The alleged adultery of her husband Is
averred as the cause of much mental

Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, March 11.â A gang of coun
terfeiters and moonshiners has been
routed in Clifton, near the New Mexico
lire, and six men have been captured
and imprisoned. \ The rest of the gang,
whese leader is unknown, has left camp
for the San Francisco Mountain fast
nesses of- Xorthern- Arizona. - - -
United States District Attorney Robert
E. Morrison left Phoenix this morning,
after the receipt of a telegram from Cllf
:ton announcing thb Important capture,
going to Clifton to prosecute the captives
and look Into the c6unterfcitlng situation
of Graham County. The counterfeiters of
Arizona have been flooding that section
with bogus dollar?, until quite a percent
age of the money in circulation Is bogus.
They have made no attempt to use cheap
metal, but adhere rigidly to silver of tho
usual coin composition, being satisfied
with a profit of something like 100 per
cent In case of exchanging bad for lawful
coin.
The gang routed in Clifton are simply
agents, for a much iarger combination,
which has a rendezvous in the Luna Val
ley, in the San Francisco Mountains. In
this almost inaccessible spot, cattle rus
tlers, bandits and murderers have fouuu
a safe retreat for years, successfully hold-
Ing off the advance guard of civilization.
Robert McCIutcheon. a cowboy of Mc

outlaw country and joined the gang for
the purpose of learnlnr of it? retreats, atwl
was fortunate enough to return with his
life. He says that the Mexicans and.ren
egades are busy, counterfeiting when not
on marauding expedition; and that there
Is considerable illicit distilling.
It Is not believed much of the moon

registered under an assumed name, but
her Identity soon became known, and she
made no secret of the object of her com

Springfield, the eloping parson of Spar
tansburg, Pa., who recently located
at Woodbridge. in this county, where he
Is living with his niece, Mrs. Springfield
will at once bring suit for divorce. She
makes sensational allegations against her
husband, in addition to the charge of in
fidelity, accusing him and their niece of
attempting to railroad her into an Insane
asylum.
Mrs. Springfield is a woman of pleasant
appearance an.l manner, and evidently a
person of education and refinement. She
says that when she married Springfield he
was not in the ministry and had little
money. She gave him $1700. with which
he purchased a farm. Later he sold the

from Mrs. Springfield, who said she be
lieved her husband had -murdered her
niece. Miss Mary Kershow. for her money.
It was soon found that' the man arrested
was not Springfield, who was later ' lo
cated on a little fruit farm near Wood
bridge, two- miles- from here.- He was
making his home with Miss Kershow,
who owned the property, he managing It.
Springfield at that time told a tale differ
ing altogether from that of . his wife's.
He claimed she was an adventuress, was
of unsound mind, had tried to kill the
niece and at various times had attempted
to rob her of several thousand dollars"
worth of Government bonds. So greatly
was he persecuted, he claimed, that he
was forced to resign from the ministry.
"1 married the woman at Denton.- Long
Island, two years ago," said he. "She Is
an adventuress, as I know now,- though I
thought her a good woman, at the time.
She told me shortly after our marriage
that she thought I was wealthy or she
never would have married me."
Says Charges Are Ridiculous.
It was throur i a marriage bureau
friend, claimed the ex-minister, that he
first met Mrs. Springfield, then a widow
named McGregor.
"She proved to be profane, vulgar and
coarse," continued Springfield. "Before
we finally parted she said she would drive
me out of the pulpit If she could. That
is what she Is trying to do now. I believe
it is partly a blackmailing scheme, but I
have done no wrong, attempted to conceal
nothing and am ready to fa^e these
charges and prove how utterly false and
ridiculous they are."
Rev. Mr. Springfield was in Lodi to-day
and transacted some business In an office
next door to the quarters of an attorney
where his vengeful wife was at the time
arranging her plan of action. Neither
was aware of the presence cf the other
and they did not meet.

County Clerk this morning were the ar
ticles of Incorporation of an Immense
railway, telegraph and telephone scheme,
which, when carried Into effect, will
cover Humboldt with a network of rails
and wires.
The new company, Â¦which will be known
as tho Humboldt Railroad Company, was
Incorporated by A. B. Hammond, G. W.
Fenwick, William G. Gosslln, H. L. Wal

fatuation, and then It was. she alleges,
that her husband and Miss Kershow
spread the statement that she was insane
and attempted to have her placed In an
asylum. This was while Springfield was
pastor ;of the Baptist churches at Spar
tansburg and Centerville, Pa., more than
a year ago.
Soon afterward the family left Pennsyl
vania for the West. At Oklahoma City
they began an overland journey in a prai
rie schooner. Once out on the rolling
prairie, she declares, the conduct of her
husband grew more scandalous than ever.
He and Miss Kershow would sit on the
only seat in the wagon, leaving the wife
to sit behind, v;ith her feet hanging over
the end of the wagon. When she remon
strated and asked to be permitted to ride
on the seat for a: change, her husband
would advise her to get on* and walk. This
she was compelled to do over many weary
miles of rough country. To supply funds
for the journey Mrs. Springfield had sold
her piano for ?150. - This money went by
degrees until, -when/. she decided she could
no longer remain 'With her husband and
Miss Kershow, she had but K0 left. Sick,
worn out and seeing that the pair were
attempting to rid themselves of her in
every way possible, she says, she left
them at Rawlins. There she took passage
for Chicago. Since then she has been on
the lookout for Springfield, and finally lo
cated him, through her Eastern attorney.

SEATTLE, March 11.â The opening of
the long-reserved crown claims and frac
tions of the Klondike to staking and en
try by miners was the cause of a mad
stampede on February 26. It marked one
of the most exciting and perhaps one of
the most Important epochs of the camp.
The time when the bars that so long
had restricted miners from touching the
ground were let down came exactly at
midnight. On the numerous creeks, hill
sides and benches there were hundreds
of men who had waited In Ions:- night
vigil. Many had toiled to the place of
staking through deep snow. A strong
wind intensified the cold.
As the clock hands reached 12 the stam
peders began setting their stakes. A
minute or two more and they had their
notices up, and then they were off on
the race to the Gold Commissioner's of
fice.
All Sorts of Conveyances.
They raced with all manner of Klon
dike conveyances. Some had teams of
horses hitched to light sleighs, some rode
bicycles, some came with fast dog teams
and others by special stago or on foot.
One man came eighteen miles on Norwe
gian skis, aided by a dog running 1 before
and drawing him by a rope he held. He
covered the distance in two and three
quarter hours and beat a horse which
drew a sleigh.
Could the eye have nweDt all the creeks
of the Klondike at midnight, dramatic
scenes would have been seen on nearly all
at the same time. Often several men
struggled to stake the same claim. In
some instances trouble occurred, it is re
ported, and a revolver Is said to have been
drawn by one disputant. At times men
staked knowing some one else was stak
ing the same claim, caul then hurried
away Â¦with the others.
The race was not alone to the stronsr.
Many women were participants. OjiÂ«
woman weighing less than 100 pounds
hurried in by doe team from Bonanza-
Other women came on stages or in private
rigs.
Bicycles Prove TTs?ful.
The wheelmen were perhaps the swift
est of all. on the whole. The trails and
roads of the creeks are packed as hard
as the finest cinder path, and the cyclists
find them superior highways. Many weie
those who came on wheels, and notwith
standing the low temperature they ped
daled like' circuit riders. A man from
Gold Run is said to have nearly killed a
team of horses.
On arrival at the Commissioner's office
all the stampeders had to stand In lino
until 9 o'clock, the regular opening hour.
Perhaps a hundred were in by that time.
Some from near-by creeks had been wait-
Ing to hold places In the line since Ions
before daylight. The first man came from
a crown reserve on Bonanza, elirht miles
away, and got in at 2:30 a. m., with a dog
team. . Shortly, afterward came a man
from Hunker with a norse panting from
the run. Next came a wheelman from
Hunker, and soon delegates were in lino
from other creeks.

Season's Clean-up in the Northern
SEATTLE, March 11.â The Rampart
Forum of January 24 says that the year's
clean-up will confirm the assertion that
the half has never been told of tho wealth
of the camp. Some obstacles that have
been heretofore looked upon as Insur
mountable have been overcome and water
on some of the best creeks has rendered
easy the work â¢which formerly 'was Im
possible.
Peck and Durfey, on Nos. 13 and H

use of steam pumps and siph*ons for clean-
Ing the bedrock of water, with the result
that they are now sinking shafts and
otherwise opening extensive works pre
paratory to putting on a large force of
men. It la believed th!s enterprise will
meet reward, because of a good quantity
of gold having been taken from various
places on the creek the last two years
while working on only such parts of the
bedrock as were dry. thereby forcing 1 the
miner to work reefa and rims.
Even the less valuable parts of tho
ground have shown some of the finest
gold of which Alaska can boast. It ex

has an assay value of $19.66 to tho ounce.

$S7.CÂ»jQ, and the other over an attempt by
I^aird to raise the appropriation for his
1 agricultural district from HMO to $2700.
The Normal School increase had â¢ not
been allowed by the Finance Committee
when the bill was under consideration,
and Smith cf Kern, chairman of the com
mittee, opposed the ineiease on the floor.
l>ut the school had votes enough and the
increase of JSC"'*) was allowed.
It was not so, however, with Laird and
his proposition. He asked for the raise
on the ground that the district had given
no fair last year, and was. therefore, en
titled to the allowances for both years,
but he was not listened to and his amend
ment was voted down.
Poll Tax Amendment Loses.
Johnson's constitutional amendment
abolishing the levying of polltax was
beaten by the Senate to-day by a vote
of 32 to 3. Burnett. Devlin, Selvage and
Welch voted for It, Devlin afterward
changing to aye for the purpose of mov
ing to reconsider. There was a hot de
bate on the question, Devlin and Selvage
supporting the amendment and Davis,
Smith of Kern. Curtln and Shortrldge op
posing it. It was denounced as a meas
ure that would result only In increasing
the tax in other directions and relieving
from taxation those who pay nothing
else for the support of the government.
The vote to reconsider will hardly amount
to anything.
The Assembly to-night refused passage i
to Milice's bill to establish a branch State
prison in Southern California.
Passage was granted Broughton's bill
making it a misdemeanor to falsely brand
or label packages containing fruit.
McWade'8 bill providing for the ap
pointment- of matrons of jails in cities
of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
classes also carried.
Roberts' bill appropriating $20,000 for
linking the highway system of Humboldt
County with that of Shasta passed.
Stuart's (of Amador) bill compelling
parents or guardians of lncorrigJbles com
mitted to Preston or WhittJer State
schools to contribute to their support also
passed.
Wants Certain Laws Codified.
Senator Selvage this afterpoon intro
duced a concurrent resolution 'calling upon
the Code Commission to codify the lawd
relating to private corporations,' revenues,
primary and general elections, the com
pleted work to b<? presented at the next
session of the Legislature.
Smith's (of Los Angeles) bill appropri
ating $7500 for improvements to the Stale
Normal School at Los Angeles passechthe
Senate as a matter of urgency.- Devlin's
bill, requiring County Clerks to supply
city officers with affidavits for elections,
passed, as did BelshT.w's making the cer
tification of the County Clerk sufficient in
the matter of warrants of arrest to bÂ«s
served within the county Issued. 1
Other bills were passed as follows: By
Sutro. protecting the meadowlark: by
McWade. creating tl.e office of matron of
jails or prisons in cities of over 20,000 In
habitants; by Brown of San XIateo, au
thorizing and directing the State Board of
Health to enforce pure food regulations.
Bills Signed or Vetoed.
Governor Gage has signed Smith's (of
K*Â»m> bill appropriating $50,000 for the es
tablishing of a polytechnic school In San
Luis Oblspo County and has approved the
committee substitute for Devlin's bill
which amends the existing Code of Civil
Procedure.
The Governor vetoed the claim of John
V. Powers, stenographer to the Commis
sion for the Revision and Reform of the
Law. Powers claims I11O0 for services ren
dered in the dual capacity of porter and
stenographer. The Governor points oul
that no statutory provision was made for
a porter to the commission in the act of
1Â£95 creating it and calls attention to the
fact that Powers was serving the Com
mission in Lunacy as porter at all times
covered in his claim. Aside from the legal
aspect the Governor leaves one to infer
that Powers, like Mr. Riley of the ryth
mic jingle, "is dolnjr quite well."
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 11.â Senate bill 447, the
legislative rcappcrtlonment measure, was
passed in the Assembly this morning as
emended by a strict party vote. There
Â¦were 47 ayes'ar.d 17 noes.
Knight offered the only opposition In the
vrzy of amendments to-day. He Bald the
Mil practically obliterated his district, the
Thirty-fourth, and he offered a series of
amendments rearranging Senatorial and
Assembly districts with a view to restor
ing: the Thirty-fourth district to its pre
i ious form. These were promptly defeat
ed. James of Los Angeles arose to express
s-yrr.pa.thy for Knight.
Sheridan spoke against the bill, claim
ing- that as it stood it was not constitu
tional. He pointed out to the Alameda
and Los Angeles members that It was
their last chance to secure the Increa.se
In representation to which they were en
titled, and that if the law were declared
Invalid they would he the sufferers. Con
tinuing. Sheridan asserted that politics
r.r.c not population had been the basis
upon which the bill had been framed.
"Not only is that true." said Sheridan,
"but population has been Ignored to the
extent that will leave the courts no al
tÂ«raattve but to hold the law-unconstitu
tional If a test be made of It. The consti
tution makes population supreme over
compactness or other considerations In
m'PÂ»rtlonrr.ent. Inyo Is put with Tulare in
ihir^ bill. xna.king an overpopulated dis
trict, when other contiguous counties are
t-hnrt In population. The constitution ex
pUdtly states that no county shall be di
vided unless it? population Is" large enough
to entitle It to two districts. Humboldt is
given two Assemblymen, though Its
population does not entitle It to them, and
Fan Bernardino, with a larger population.
Than Humboldt. gets but one Assembly
r..;in. That is a flagrant violation of the
t : canto lav.-. .
"Apaln. the Committee on Census* and
Apportionment considered only the figures
if total population, though the constitu
tion provides that aliens not eligible to
j-iiiuralizatlon shall not be counted in ap
;crtlonment. Chinese. Japanese. Malays
ure .-ill counted In the scheme on which
tbis was framed, in direct violation of the
constitution."
Carter, chairman of the Census and
Apportionment Committee. admitted that
no deductions for alien Chinese and Jap
uneÂ«e had been made.
Senate Rejects Amendments.
The amendment to the apportionment
bill came over to the 6er.ate during the
afternoon, and after the afternoon ses
elon was over the Republican members
held a caucus upon them. The amend
ments were made by the Assembly Com
mittee on Apportionment and started with
the consolidation of Sa:i Benito with Mon
terey to form an Assembly district and
then to get a district for the extra Assem
blrmaa taken from Sar. Benito.
The caucus was really for the Question,
ar.d promptly declined to stand for any
puch change. They would accept noth
ing but Pan Benito as an Assembly dis
trict, ar.-l that being settled the other
amendments went overboard. It Is ex
pected that the Assembly win recede from
the amendment, as the sentiment was
r.ever very strong In the lower house and
It is strong in the Senate. San Benito 1r
r:irt cf Senator FIint'6 district, and he Is
Viehind the fight for the Assemblyman for
t-:an Benito alone.
Two More Lease Bills Pass.
Two more bills referring to the China
TViFin lease passed the S<?nate, one this
fifternon and the other to-night, and were
sent over to join the ratification bill in
the Assembly. The bills were those re
".p.tir.g to the jurisdiction of the Harbor
< ' >rnmission. one giving It control of
]<^ase<i property and tlia other an act to
strike from the present law a provision
r'. lowing the commission to make leasrs.
The latter bill was explained by r>avis
bs a. measure to compel the Santa Fe to
stand up to the terms of the lease, as.
with the enabling rlause stricken out, anv
rloLftlldn of the Tease which would entail
a forfeiture would leave them up against
a situation which would not allow of an
rther lease of the property, ar.d so the
road would be effectually and permanent
ly out of it. It was a pieeautlonary meas
\it", Davis said, and its sole purpose w&a
in ir.fjrp an exact observance of the pro
visions of the lease by the Santa Fe.
There was the same old opposition to
both bills, but there was not much of a
debate. "Wolfe and O'Neal opposed them
both and Davis replie-!, but there was no
right.
Assembly Certain to Hatify.
The ratification bill will come up In the
Assembly to-morrow afterr.oon. It loo'ci
Dow u if thc-re is no doubt of its passage,
and some cf its supporters are willing to
claim fifty votes for it. Pendleton, Rai
ston and Flxk are behind it. and the
Democratic minority leaders are working
for it. Johnson will oppose it. but his
opposition may not be so active in view
cf the altered situation.
The Senate to-day concurred In the
amendment added by the Assembly to
l Welch's bill to raise UM salaries of deD
'â¢ry superintendents of public schools. Tne
amendmest by the Assembly was to llm'.t
the provisions of the act to cities with
ever ZSjOM inhabitants, but as San Fran
cisco is the only city that rates deputy
5'jperJntender.ts of schools the bill ;ould
n^t affect any other city, any way. The
fci:i will *now go to :he Governor.

Stevenson and Jessie Streets Not
Likely to Be Extended Between
Seventh and Eighth..
City and County Attorney Lane has ren
dered a decision which will probably bring
joy to the owners and lessees of the prop
erty known as Central Park. A question
was recently raised as to the opening of
Stevenson and Jessie a'reets through tha
two 100-vara lots. 2S2 and 2S3, which block
the opening of those stieet3 from Seventh
to Eighth streets.
Mr. Lane refers to a former decision oi
his predecessor, Harry Creswell, where
in he says they are not open streets. Upon,
an abstract of title furnished by D. R.
McNelll. the lessee, he says: "I find thero-
In no evidence of dedication of any por
tion of said 100 vara jots to public usÂ© as
streets." Under this opinion the property
will remain Intact.

In an elaborate report filed with the
Board of Public Works it is shown that
there are 200 of these stands scattered
over the city and that 640 chcJrs are used
on them. Secretary Park estimates that
the activity of the inspectors will result
in a considerable increase in the revenue
of the city. Active efforts to collect the
$1920 license that all the chairs would do
liable to bring will be commenced'. â¢' '
A rise in the price of shines Is at onco
expected.

As soon a3 the differences betweeti thÂ»
Board of Public Works and the Board of
Education regarding the authority to re
pair dilapidated school buildings is set
tled, extensive repalra and additions will
be made. ; ,
In the Bciencp department of the Lowe'l
Hljrh School 200 pupils are crowded to
gether. They lack proper accommodations
and instruction. At the next meetlr.s of

FAVORITES ruled In the mud of
Tanforan yesterday in five out of
the six races and the one excep
tion was a second choice. So th?
"bookies" raised their voices to
heaven, but not with that degree of con
demnation that usually accompanies a
succession of lucky favorite picking3.
Most of the first choice were odds-on and
were shied at by the bettors. The track
was soft and muddy,, not sloppy or mushy.
Pupil, mounted by Winnie O'Connor,
won the first race easily. It was a tri
angular affair in which Formero and
Gonfalon were the other sides. Pupil was
a 4 to 5 favorite, Formero and Gonfalon
receiving a slight backing.
Soon after the start Gonfalon and For
mero played the team act up the back
stretch, Pupil lying in wait. When they
turned Into the stretch O'Connor shot
Pupil out and Gonfalon seemed to stick
fast. Even Formero found no difficulty
In stealing the place from Gonfalon, wbj
showed a strong dislike for the mud.
The second race was quadrangular and
went to Kenilworth, the favorite. Tommy
Burns in the pilot-box. The race was
run strictly on the form of the bookmak
ers' Blating of chances. O'Connor, on
Brutal, was given a strong play at 3 to
1 until the price dropped a point. The
race was Kenilworth' a at every stage,
Brutal working up peg by peg for the
place, and Ada N coming in for the show.
Kenilworth was the band leader and led
the others a merry dance for more than
seven of the eight furlongs.
The third race was nothing but Astor,
with Burns up. High Hoe found the field
too thick and Dangerous Maid was not f;i
her element. Astor had the headlights
out from start lo finish, High Hoe and
Dangerous Maid playing second and third
parts. Astor was a 1 to 2 favorite.
Barrack, steered by O'Connor, was a
prohibitive favorite in the mile and three
lurlong route. Everybody knew that
Barrack doted on mud, liked the distance,
and that Owensboro and Topmast fancied
the dry footing. O'Connor rode a pretty
race, allowing Owensboro and La Borgia
to wear themselves out until the last turn
Into the stretch.. Then Barrack tore up
tho track and walked in ahead of the
ambitious. Owensboro got the place from
Topmast.
The fifth race over the six furlong route
went to the favorite, Maggie Davis, with
Burns doing the steering act. Maggie
was well liked in the betting and Nellie
Forest, Winnie O'Connor up, was second
choice. Amasa, 12 to 1, ridden by Eno^,
wasn't thought off, but when the race
was run Amasa and Doublet had it all
to themselves until the stretch. Then
Magrgie L>avis came from behind and Nel
lie Forest was urged to the front. Mag
gie proved a winner, Amasa getting the
place and Nellie Forest the show.
In tho sixth race, a mile for four-year
olds, Macy was the favorite. Walken
shaw, with Tommy Burns in the saddle,
rode home for ilrst money, Macy getting
the place. Lomond, who came In for the
show, and Walkenshaw led most of the
way, Macy paesing Lomond for the place.
AT TANFORAN TRACK
BY LOUIS HONIG.
SO well did the talent, have the
mudlarks starting in the different
events at Oakland yesterday sized
up that but two escaped, its prac
ticed eye, the choices taking
everything else. For some reason, per
haps his shifting form, Pat Morrisscy
dees not hold the same grip on the public
affection as of old, for he was one of
those overlooked. The track, sloppy with
mud as It was, seemed made to order for
him. Still, in. the betting on the mile and
a sixteenth selling' affair, with a field of
eight going to the post, Pat's odds de
scribed an "up-shoot," ascending from. 2
to 4. As Dominick had already piloted
three winners over the bar in safety, thu
crowd remained faithful, \>n
Herculean at 6 to 5. "While Dominick was
busy trying to keep the favorite up,
Mounce stole away In the lead with Pat
aiorrlssey and the Celtic named horse,
traveling by easy stages, splashed in as
he pleased in front of Castake, an 8 to 1
bhot, the favorite following.
The attendance was extremely large for
"blue Monday," the betting ring being
well filled. Master Dominick still has his
riding clothes on, llnishing on tour win
ners, and his followers have nothing but
money. Mounce, too, is holding up his
end in the saddle, for besides his win on
Morrissey, he got the decision on Lenne;>
over Beau Ormonde ' in a hard drive.
Throughout no fault could be found with
the sport, even if mud did not add to its
attractiveness. ;
Loving Cup slipped into an exceedingly
soft spot in the opening sprint at six and
a halt furlongs. Tlie mare closed a 1 to
4 chance and won leisurely "from William
E\ the third choice. Romany ran a fa-.r
third, it being his ttrst start in some time.
.Following this came the win of the mile
selling run by Norford, against which 3
to 2 was laid for a little. Dominick, who
had the mount, indulged The Benedict
with the lead to tho back stretch turn.
Then going to the front, the race was fin
ished in professional style, The Benedict
leading out Cromwell for the place.
Although they could be termed equal
favorites, It Is just likely that Prestene
at 8 to 5 did have a shade on Mike Mur
phy in the betting on the two-year-old
scramble. The latter youngster appeared
In rare good fettle, and jumping' away in
front, beat Lento, the Burke entry, with
pounds to spare. Mounce astride Pres
tene lost his whip, and as the filly will
bear touching up, was at a disadvantage,
finishing third.
In the six and a half furlong spin, Len
nep and Beau Ormonde furnished the
most exciting finale of the afternoon. The
first named mare, a 4 to 5 favorite, it was
thought would win "on the bit." Instead,
after passing the Ormonde horse in the
stretch, the latter came again at the pad
dock, and in a furious drive lost by a
short neck only. Good Hope ran Into the
Show.
With some dangerous ones scratched
from the closing chapter. Alice Dougher
ty fell heir to a purse. At that, the books
laid 4 to 5, and she came home by herself.
Midlove secured the place quite as easily
from Clarando.

Water Bate Ordinance
Is Adopted.
Tho Spring Valley Water Compary
filed a formal protest yesterday against
the adoption of the ordinance fixing th>.
water rates for the next fiscal year. CfcieJ
Engineer Schussler submitted a volumi
nous statement in which he used spe
cious arguments to show why the rare*
should be based on a higher valuat'o:i
than 724.667,800 as fixed by City Ehgin r
Grunsky. Schussler presented figures t>
show that undervaluations and omissW.-i
amounting to 5S.217.325 in the City En
gineer's estimate would increase the vaiu-j
to .532.SS5.125. Schussler also vlgorou >\y
protested against being excluded from
the secret session of the board at wt.: i
the r cites were fixed on. the City. Ekjt.

Mayor Phrlan took exception to Schus
sler's assertion that the board had heJl
a -secret session. It was later admitte.l.
however, that only the Supervisors were
present and every one else was exclu>l<.l
from the meeting room.
Scretary Ames stated that Instead of a.
decrease of Jloy.ouo in the revenue la^r
year the company had actually suffers :
a loss of J161.W0 by reduced rates. Araci
said he would prove it, which led Re* I
to remark that the testimony of the com
pany's own witnesses would have to 1 Â»

clusion.
Schussler took occasion to say that h<Â»
had been assured by Connor and Reel
that he would be recalled on the erenln^
the ordinance was discussed at the secrer.
session: Both Supervisors denied the soft
Impeachment.
"Then you have forgotten it," replle I
Schussler. "The evidence has not beer,
closed. I certainly expected to be heaM
in rebuttal of Grunsky'a statement, when
I left at 6 o'clock. I -went to dinner with
Mr. Reed and we discussed what amount
of pipe and number of hydrants the com
pany would place if the rates were not
disturbed. I can prove before a court that
the City Engineer has greatly under
valued the property. In fact he onca
gave figures as a private citizen that wer*
greatly In excess of those he gave as ati
expert to this board."
The discussion was ended by th<Â» Mayor,
who said the rates had been adopted, but
that Schussler's statement would be re
ceived as a protest. In tli-j meantima
copies will be furnished the Supervisors
and final action will be taken next lion
day. ' _
Mayor Deplores Publication

School Board Asked to Move Toward
Enabling Pupils to Take Ad
vantage of Half -Fare
Ordinance.
Tobln presented an ordinance to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday which 13
designed ; to "prohibit the passing, pub
lishing, printing, giving, delivery or cir
culation or distribution of lottery draw
ings or the publishing or distribution of
newspapers, magazines, writings, prints,
bills, handbills, cards, instruments or de-
Vices representing declarations, state
ments or memoranda or copies of the
lucky or winning characters, numbers or
figures in a lottery or lottery drawing,"
The ordinance makes its violation a mis
demeanor, punishable by a fine of $500, or
imprisonment for six months.
Tobln had left the meeting when the
resolution . was read by title, but tho
Mayor, who Is responsible for Its Intro
duction, assured the board that it is a
good measure and Incidentally delivered
his usual fling at the newspapers.
"This ordinance," said his Honor. Is
merely amendatory of the one now In
force and brings the newspapers under
its provisions. A Police Court Judge has
decided that the word 'paper' In the pres
ent ordinance does not mean 'newspaper,
so conviction is impossible. The only rea
son why lotteries exist is because they get
encouragement from the press. â¢ â¢'â¢
His Honor then referred the ordinance
to the Police Committee.
The board re-enacted the present ordi
nance, fixing the maximum price to be
charged for gas for illuminating and heat
ing purposes as the rate lor the ensuing
year. J
The Board of Education was requested
to take such steps as will enable school
children to avail themselves of the privi
leges granted by the 2Va cent fare ordi
nance as soon as it takes effect.
The- resolution recommending to tluÂ»
Boards of Public Works and Fire
Wardens that they approve of the con
struction of a steel, wire lath and plaster
partition, extending from the top of th?
existing wall across the proscenium of
the Grand Opera-house to the stage roof
in lieu of the extension of the brick wall,
was referred to the Joint Committee o.i
Judiciary and Fire.
The Board of Works was requested to
advise whether it is expedient to repave
all streets in the business section of th!-5
city at the official grade.
The ordinance imposing a license of $5
per annum on wagons drawn by two
horses and $10 per annum on those drawn
by more than two horses was Indefinitely
postponed. Similar action was taken < n
the bill imposing a license of (10 for each
load weighing more than fifteen tons.

The John McDonald left Baltimore on
September 18 in charge of Captain Watts,
while his brother sailed on August 23 In
charge of the bark Pactolus on a similar
voyage. The brothers had not met for
years and were in hopes of having a chat
at Baltimore. They were disappointed,
however. On December 6 last the Pacto
lus was In latitude 56 degrees 5 minutes
south, longitude 67 degrees 5 minute* west
(about ten miles south of Cape Horn).
Strange to say, there was no wind to
speak of and a calm sea. When the mists
cleared away. a ship was sighted about a
mile away and it did not take long to
make her out as the John McDonald.
Captain Watts of the Pactolus eoon had
a beat in the water and inside of half an
hour he was shaking his brother's hand.
They had a long chat, and then the cap
tain of the Pactolus returned to his ves
sel and soon both ship and bark were
headed again for San Francisco. The
Pactolus arrived here February 3 and la
now on her way to New Whatcom to load
lumber for Cape Town, but there is no
word from the John McDonald. The voy

Water Front Notes.
During the month of April the captains
of vessels coming from foreign ports aro
sure to do some cursing when they reach
the San Francisco bar. Of course, the
first object they will look for will be the
lightship, but that craft with its warn
ing whistle will not be there. The Gov
ernment has issued a notice to mariners
which states that about April 1 light ves
sel No. 70 will be withdrawn for repairs
and that a red gas buoy with "light ves
sel moorings" painted on it in black let
ters will take its place. The question is
being asked, "Is It not about time that
San Francisco had' a second lightship?"
Surely there were enough accidents last
year when the lightship came in to war
rant the expenditure.

1b a water ballast vessel, but neverthe

Cap Horn is 2372 tons net burden, 303 feet
7 inches long, 44 feet 6 Inches beam and
24 feet 2 inches deep. She sailed from
Newcastle, N. S. W.; on November 6
with about 5000 tons of coal. The con
signees in Iqulque did not want that
much coal, so 1241 tons of It had to be
brought here, and the Cap Horn had no
use for water ballast. This is her first
voyage to San â¢ Francisco.

The owners of the Cape Wrath have
been very unfortunate with vessels sent
to the Pacific. Coast. In 1&99 they sent the
steel four-masted bark Dominion from
Cardiff to Honolulu with a cargo of coal.
Captain Merldeth, who had commanded
her from thÂ» day she went into commis
sion, was given a new shipâ the Annie
Thomasâ and a new man took the Domin
ion out. From Honolulu the- Dominion
started for Victoria, B. C, and from that
day to this nothing has ever been heard
of her.
In -1900 Captain Merideth sailed from
Cardiff for Acapulco in the Annie Thom
as. Neither master nor vessel have ever
been heard from since. The Wrath Is a
new ship and she took a cargo of coal
from Cardiff to Callao. After discharg
ing her cargo she started for Portland in
ballast. Seafaring men are of the opin
ion that the remains of the Andrada, Ber

RIVERSIDE. March 11.â The prelim

of the most remarkable cases ever tried
in jthe State took place before Judg?

Court to-day. The suit Is brought to an

Edmonstone is now. only Its years of age.
having been married at the age of 13
years and 6 months. The plaintiff is 12

Edmonstone seeks to have his marital
bonds severed on the cround that they
were forced upon him bv threats an 1
duress, and he names. the girl's father as
a party to the suit.
The complaint and its answer, which
were In evidence . in to-day's hearing,
agreed on some of the more salient points

arrest for a crime which in Canada is pun
ishable by both whipping and a long term

held a conference and it was agreed thai
if Edmonstone would marry the girl the
prosecution would be dropped. The al

fcrmlty with the laws of Michigan, Minnesota.
Icwa, Oregon and North Dakota, and even
more liberal laws, would create much less
agitation throughout the country than the
practice which ' has heretofore bÂ»en resorted
to of arresting: every few weeks some Mormon
on a charge of unlawful acts and. having: the
crrest announced In glowing headlines by all
those newspapers throughout the country whlojji
can be induced to take up an anti-Mormon
crusade.
Kverybody knows that these arrests have
been made for political and religious purposes,
and not with any patriotic desire to enforce
the law. Within the laft ten years much more
than hnlf of those Involved in polygamous re
lations have passed away by death or those re
lations have been otherwise dissolved. Most
ot those rematning are advanced in years, and
no good cr honorable purpose .can be subserved
by prosecuting the few remaining polygamlsts.
Kvery ons of these prosecutions Is a source of
regret to fully SO per cent of the people of
Utah, for the reason that' such proceedings
create an agitation harmful to the State. It
may be that an agitation more harmful can
b Inaugurated by reason of the passage of this
law, but I do not believe it. To use the old
metaphor, we are between the devil and tne
deep sea, and the bill is Intended to relieve
the State of a condition of affairs more harm
ful, in my opinion, than this bill could pos
sibly be. Surely the United States will per
mit Utah to act In her domestic concerns with
as much freedom as is allowed such States
as those I have named, especially when the
terms of the enabling act and our State con
stitution have been strictly compiled with. I
have in this matter acted with the best mo
tive and according to what. In my Judgment,
is for the best interests of the commonwealth.
" Representative W.*G. Van Horn of Salt
Lake, who made an impassioned speech
against the passage of the bill In the
House to-day, gave the following state
ment:
The first object of the bill is indubitably to
prevent the prosecution of those maintaining
polygamous relations Ions since contracted.
The effect, however, will probably be to have
adopted a constitutional amendment giving
rower to Congress to legislate against polyga
mous and unlawful cohabitation. Laws passed
under curb an amendment will be prosecuted
by United States District Attorneys swern to
enforce the law and violations will be care
fully looked up by United States Marshals and
their assistants. There will thus be a return
to conditions prevalent during the ajtgresslve
prosecutions under the Edmunds-Tucker law,
when hundreds of prominent Mormons were
Imprisoned for their polygamous practices and
numbers of others were In hiding or out of
Utah to avoid arrest.
There will, however. In case of prosecution,
bf additional hardships over those suffered In
former times. Those men convicted were im
prisoned here, near their homes, and were
deemed by their neighbors as martyrs rather
than criminals. Convicted under United States
low they would be confined In United States
prisons "outside of Utah and "away from the
support and consolation of their friends. I
opposed the bill In all friendship for the law
ohiding people of Utah and with pity for the
suffering that those not strictly law-nbicllncr
will brln^.upon themselves. It is a distinct
step backward and can bring naught but
misery.
Author of the Measure Declares It

â¢ Â» â¢
SALT LAKE, Utah, March 11.â To-day,
three days before the Legislature comes
to a close, the House, by a vote of 25 to
17, and after an exciting debate. In which
more than a dozen members participated,
passed the Evans Senate bill amending
that portion of the. revised statutes of
Utah to prosecutions tor Infidel
ity.-Having passed the Senate last week
by a vote of 11 to 7, the document now
goes to the Governor for signature.
This bill, which was Introduced by Sen
ator A. J. Evans of Juab county, has
caused more discussion and more feeling
than any measure Introduced at the pres
ent session of the Legislature. . Its text is
as follows: i.\-r.
Every person who has reason to believe that
a crime or public offense has been committed
by another person may make complaint against
such person before some magistrate having au
thority to make inquiry of .same; provided that
no prosecution shall be commenced except on
complaint of the husband or wife or relative
of the accused within the first degree of con
sanguinity or of a person with whom the un
lawful act Is alleged to have been committed,
or of the father or mother of said- person, and
no prosecution shall be commenced except on
complaint' of the wife or alleged plural wife
of the accused; but this proviso shall not ap
ply to prosecutions under section 420S of the
revised statutes of Utah, 1898, denning and
punishing polygamous marriages.
In answer to a request for a statement
as to the object of the bill, Senator Evans,
its author, furnished the following:
My object in presenting the bill was two
fold. In the first place it was intended to keep
down public agitation by taking away from
certain agitators the opportunity to arouse
periodic furores against the Mormons, directly
and indirectly against the State of Utah, and
for that reason its primary purpose was for
the general good of the State. I believe that

IT'S FOLLY
' ' ' ADVERTISEMENTS.
This picture tells its own story of sisterly affection. The
older girl, just budding into womanhood, has suffered great-
ly with those irregularities and menstrual difficulties which.
sap the life of so many young women. â¢
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound can
always be relied upon to restore health to women who thus
suffer. It is a sovereign cure for the worst forms of female
complaints, â that bearing-down feeling, weak back, falling
and displacement of the womb, inflammation of tho ovaries,
and all troubles of the uterus or womb. It dissolves and
expels tumors from the uterus in the early stage of develop-
ment and checks any tendency to cancerous humors." It
subdues excitability, nervous prostration, and tones up the
entire female system.
Could anything prove more dearly the ef-
ficiency of Mrsm Pinkham*s Medicine than the
following strong statement of Grace Stansbury?
*' Deah Mrs. Ptxkham : â I was a sufferer from female -weakness for
about a year and a half. I havo tried doctors and potent medicines, but
nothing 1 helped me. I underwent the horrors of local treatment, but re-
ceived no benefit. My ailment was pronounced nlcerat;on of the womb.
, . -. I suffered from intense pains in the womb and
ovaries, and the backache was dreadful. I had
<Â£i$J}$%S^fe*. leucorrhoea in its worst form. Finally, I pp*ew so
weak I had to keep my bed. Tiie pains were so Â«
w hard as to almost cause spasms. When I could

- All of that is interesting enough as an explanation
of Kitchener's failure to capture Dewet, or Steyn, or
Botha, but it does not help the taxpayer much. The
British War Office reports show that at the beginning
of the year there were engaged in South- Africa in the
British armies 267,000 men.; The cost'of the war up
to that time had exceeded $400,000,000; wand the War
Office estimates for South Africa for the current year
arc about $300,000,000 more. Evidently, the pursuit of
Dewet is very much like that kind of pursuit of pleas
ure which is known the road to ruin. It cannot
be followed without/having money to burn.'
So irritated has the British public become over the
repeated successes of Dewet that Lord Roberts has
found it advisable to lemind his countrymen of the
magnitude of the field over which their troops have to
keep guard. His statement gives the following table
of distances over which his troops had to travel by
land: \ _
m Miles.
Cape Town to Pretoria 1,040*'
Pretoria to Komatlpoort : 200
Cape Town to Kimberley 647.
Kimberley, to Mafeking 223
Mafeking to Pretoria 160
Mafeking to Belra :..'........ .......... 1,135
Durban to Pretoria 511
It is further recalled to the attention of the grum
bling people at home that Cape Colony contains
something o\'er 277,000 square miles, Orange River
Colony more than 48,000 square miles, the Transvaal
more than 113,000 square miles, and Natal over 18,000
"square miles. Commenting upon those figures Lord
Roberts adds: "It will be seen that the army in
South Africa had to be distributed over 'an area of
greater extent than France and Germany .put to
gether, and, if we include that part of Rhodesia with
which we had to do, larger than the combined areas
of France, Germany and Austria."
1 Â» ROM the ease with which Dewet has managed
I to once more escape the British troops those who
* are watching the progress of the struggle in the
Transvaal will have another illustration of the diffi
cult task that confronts the British. The Boer gen
eral has proven his ability to enter Cape Colony, raid
it for three weeks, oDtain recruits from among the
Boer settlers of the country, get fresh horses and sup
plies, and escape in safety to the big, wild country
beyond the Orange K:ver.
DEWET AND MIS FIELD.
ALL the great nations of the world are busily
engaged, at a large cost, in constructing mighty
warships covered with heavy armor; but at the
same time scientists and inventors are loud in declar
ing that in a few years such ships will be worthless:
that the increasing power of explosives will soon en
able shot and shell to be hurled with such force that
any armor a ship can carry afloat will be as useless
in battle as the mail of a medieval kniglit against a
rifle ball
One of these authorities, Hudson Maxim, recently
said in a lecture in New York: "Some time within
the next six months the Government will undertake
experiments at Sandy Hook for the purpose of testing
the new high explosive known as Maximite. A struc
ture built of the strongest Kruppite plate, twelve
inches thick and as large as a modern battleship, will
be set up as a target. If, as I predict, this plate should
be destroyed at one shot, there will be wrought as
complete a revolution in naval architecture as resulted
from the building of the Monitor. Maximite is the
first high explosive satisfactory in other respects
which could be fired through armor plate of such
thickness as to make it available for armor-piercing
shells. When a projectile filled with Maximite is
exploded in flight it will be hurled at a velocity of
5000 feet a second."
The statement that the tests of the new explosive
are to be made within six months is encouraging.
There is nothing vague about such a statement. It
gives assurance that the Government and the public
are going to learn within a definite' time what Mr.
Maxim's prediction ii worth. His declaration that
the results will tend toward revolutionizing naval
architecture may prove true, but, even so, the revolu
tion will not be effected at once, and the Governments
of the powers are therefore acting with wisdom in
constructing warships they can rely upon under pres
ent conditions. It is not always safe to trust to ?.n
inventor.
In the meantime it will be interesting tonote what
Maxim thinks would be the effect on naval architec
ture should the results of the test of Maximite be
what he predicts. In the same lecture he said: "The
War vessel of the future will be a small unarmored
gunboat, capable of traveling at a high rate of speed.
Such a craft will com-; into use as the natural result
of the success of the aerial torpedo, and will afford
far more protection than the most powerful battle
ship."
The lecturer went on to say that the only foe which
could successfully contend against a swift cruiser
armed with guns using Maximite would be an auto
mobile torpedo boat traveling under water at the ran
of three-quarters of a mile in a minute. Such a boat,
he thinks, will soon be attained by means of a newly
invented propelling force said to be more powerful
than compressed air. Furthermore, he added: '"On
land the changes in warfare must be as great as on
sea. It will be no longer possible for troops to fight
in the open. As soon as they appeared on the line
of the 'horizon they would be wiped out by the new
engines of destruction as quickly and as surely 13
dust is reduced by the use of a garden hose."
The. press reports of the lecture announce: "Mr.
Maxim made various demonstrations to prove his as
sertions." How near the demonstrations came to con
stitutinga sufficient proof is not stated. We /shall

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
In October, 1S91. a regular government
was formed for Zanzibar, with General
Lloyd Matthews. K. C M. G., as Prime
Minister. In February, 1S92, it, was de
clared a free port, but the importation of
spirits, arms, powder and mineral oils is
still under strict regulation. Prior to that
time the revenues of the 'Sultan were al
most entirely derived from customs dues
and taxes upon produce, chiefly cloves.
But under the new arrangement the Sul
tan's privy purse, which is kept wholly
distinct from the general revenues of tho
country, ia fixed at 120,000 rupees annual
ly, while the remainder of the revenue is
devoted to . charges for the internal ad
ministration of the state. -However, no
expenditure can be incurred . without the
sanction both of the Sultan and the Brit
ish agent and Consul General. The other
chief officials are a Consul, two Vice Con
suls and a Board of Agrlcultnre. There
is also a regular native army of about
How Zanzibar Is Ruled.
When ho first arrived. in the Island In
1S66 the sovereignty of the Sultan was
most precarious. The standing, army was
composed of a few miserable, ill-clothed,
unpaid, cowardly mercenaries. Slaves
â¢n^re sold in the open market Upon the
death of the relsnlng Sultan, Sir John Kirk
sedulously cultivated the friendship and
confidence of his successor, Beyd Barg
hash, with the result that at the end of
two years of personal intercourse he was
able to obtain as a concession to friend
ship what Sir 13artle Frere. in spite of his
personal prest'go and position, backed by a
fleet of ironclads, had failed to extort
even under the threat of bombardmentâ
namely, Seyd's signature to a treaty for
the suppression of the East African slave
trade.
After several centuries of quasi-Arab
rule, Zanzibar in the beginning of the
sixteenth century came under the domin
ion of the Portuguese. Later on the Arabs
reasserted their independence, and the
island remained in the possession of vari
ous Arab chiefs till the end of the eigh
teenth century, when the Imam of Muscat
proclaimed and maintained his sover
eignty over Zanzibar and PÂ«mba and the
neighboring coast. In 1S41 the East India
Company first established relations with
the ruler of Zanzibar, who had assumed
the title of sayd. or lord, of the island,
and successive British representatives
were appointed to -the court of Zanzibar,
until in 1873 Sir John Kirk, who had been
appointed vice-consul in 1S66 and subse
quently consul, received his formal ap
pointment to the post of consul general,
and later on attained the further office of
political agent. There is no other man
living, says Sir Harry Johnston, who has
so profoundly influenced- the condition of
Eastern Africa as Sir John Kirk. Born of
an old Scotch family and educated for a
doctor, he served as such with the British
army in the Crimean war, but hlaown
taste and aptitude were for natural his
tory. In 1S58 ho accepted the post of nat
uralist to Livingstone's expedition to the
Zambesi, the exigencies of which, how
ever, forced him to lay aside the natural
ist to become the second in command, in
which capacity, when others failed, Liv
ingstone found him a mainstay in several
critical emergencies.
Influence of Sir John Kirk.
Zanzibar is thus by far the most flour
ishing and Important town In Eastern Af
rica. It Is a great trade center for Afri
ca, India and Arabia, As seen from the
sea. it appears a closely packed town,
built down to the water's edge, "with
Ftately buildings of dazzling whltenes*
standing out clear and sharp against tho
deep blue sky, while waving palms anl
vivid creen bushes, smooth blue sea and
red shore are aglow in the rich warmth of
atmosphere that knows no smoke or fog."
Conspicuous among Its chief buildings are.
the Sultan's palace, rebuilt after the bom
bardment in 1S9S, on the occasion of the
short-lived usurpation of Khalid; tho vari
ous consulates, the French Hospital, the
hospital of the English Universities' Mis
sion Â¦ and their cathedral church, which
stands upon the site of the old slave mir
ket, the holy table being erected on the
very spot where formerly stood the
shameful whipping post. There Is a mag
nificent harbor where ships of all nations
ride at anchor among the numerous
dhows.
Zanzibar ' Â¦ suggests cloves^ â and slaves
Slave labor is still to a preat extent, and
until recently was wholly, employed on
the clove plantations, the product of
which constitutes the principal export to
India, Great Britain, the 'United States
and elsewhere; but there are very largo
exports also of ivory, petroleum, rubber
and copal. The principal. Imports are cot
ton stuffs from England, oil from America
and rice from. India. Prosperous as was
the Import and export trade In 1S9S, the re
turns for 1S99 show a marked advance
Tho total value of all articles Imported
into Zanzibar in that year amounted to
Â£1,596.606, an increase of Â£41,536 over the
preceding year, while the total exports
for the same period reached a sum ofÂ£1.
513,407, exceeding by nearly Â£16,000 those
of tho year before.
The Trade Center of East Africa.
small, are Indian, and, like the Arabs,
Mohammedan, with the exception of some
heathen Banyans. But among the lower
orders are Persians, Egyptians and Soa
nese, representatives of every African
and many Asiatic races.
The country had a look at their sincerity in th*
tragic opposition to the Reed rules in the House.
They fought Reed on the floor, kicked in doors "aid
shrieked like a hysterical woman in a church revival.
They ta tied the issue into the campaign of .i&p and
ekctect so large a majority of the House that' it re
quired a search warrant to find the Republican mi
nority. The3' elected Mr. Crisp Speaker, and that
unfortunate gentleman found himself compelled to
enforce Reed's rules in order to compel that over
whelming majority of his own party to sit in its seats
and transact the public business. That experience
satisfied the country. So those who arc talking about
dead bodies and breathing martyrdom and slaughter
may as well keep their breath for the advocacy of a
"more and a fittener currency," or the other vagaries
for which they stand.
Then the minority stood up and despaired of the
republic once more. It was announced that probably
Vice Prevcent Roosevelt would lock the Senate
doors and force cloture through at the muzzle of a
gun, and Senator Jones of Arkansas announced that
this would have to be done over his dead body. All
of this i ant it for effect. The Senate may or may not
adopt a t!cture, but it is safe to say that if it do and
the Democrats ever come into power in that body
they will not repeal it.
FoIIowirg: Carter's performance Senator Platt re
rcv.ed a proposition for a cloture rule that has been
made before to protect the Senate from license and
the majority from paralysis.
In the earlier history of the Senate such. a feat of
endu' rr.ee as Allen's sixteen-hour speech to defeat the
repeal of the Sherman act, and Carter's recent con
tinuous performance of thirteen hours to defeat the
river and harbor bill, from motives of revenge,
would hi ve "been frowned upon as a licentious abuse
of the -crate rules and the freedom of speech.
It w?.s not intended that it should be used to de
prive the majority of its rights, nor the privilege of
assuming the responsibility for legislation which be
longs to it.
Debate in that body has always been without limi
tation. The Senate has no previous question, nor
motion to lay on the <able, to indefinitely postpone or
ether direct means to stop discussion or indirect
means to kill a bill. Of course in the beginning it
was intended that this Senatorial policy should con
scrve absolute freedom of speech and facilitate legis
lation by the ample illumination of all proposed laws
that must result from such freedom.
WHENEVER the majority party in the United
States Senate has been talked to a standstill by
the minority, and its power to legislate has
been paralyzed, there has been talk of a cloturc rule.

Everything thus appears as fair and lovely over
Kansas as a spring morning, and far be it from us
to predict disaster or look for signs of ill omen;
Nevertheless, it is to be borne in mind that Kansas
is a cyclone State, and newspapers in the hands of
inexperienced editors are among the greatest cyclone
breeders known to man or woman. The Smashers'
Mail may yet prove a storm center, and far and wide
the prairies of Kansas may be strewn with the wrecks
of poems and the hair of Nick Childs.
The wicked man, it will be seen, is in this case sub
ordinate to his lord, and the editor is now. supreme.
There Â¦will 'be no more exclusion of Mrs. Nation's
beautiful articles nor wasting of the poetry of her
friends.
Now Mrs. Nation has a paper of her own, but still
she is not altogether happy. Her publisher, it seems,
does not exactly. suit her, but she accepts him for the
good of the cause. She is reported to have said in
her salutatory: "I have no apologies to make for
having Nick Childs for the publisher of the Smash
ers' Mail. Our Savior ate with the publicans and
sinners to do them good. The servant is not above,
his Lord. This paper will be, as its name implies,
the smashers' mail. I shall put into the columns the
letters I get from all over, even those I get from
across the water. Those wishing to say anything
through the columns of the Smashers' Mail must put
it in the form of a letter and use brevity â the soul nÂ£
wit â for I reserve the exclusive right as editor. I
have had a severe lesson in Peoria from allowing
some one to attend to what I ought to, therefore I
alone am responsible for what goes in."
We learn from our Eastern exchanges that Mrs.
Nation complains that while she was nominally editor
of the Peoria Journal, not one-half of what she wrote
was published.^ The report goes on 'to quote Mrs.
Nation as saying there was a wicked man on the paper
who stole her articles and tore them up "just because
he wanted to get his own stuff in." She added: "I
took to Peoria a dozen pieces of poetry which my
admiring friends had wrote and sent in, the most
beautiful pieces I ever read, but the wicked man
chucked them into the waste-basket. He got a 'talk
ing-to.' 'Hell,' I says, 'is full of such scoundrels a3
jOU.' "
It must not be supposed that Mrs: Nation's week of
experience in editing a paper for some one else was
altogether satisfactory to her. She was pleased, of
course, with the privilege of sitting in the sanctum
and writing exhortations and poems for the world, bu:
her authority in the office was not supreme. The pro
prietor of the paper insisted on having something to
say about' the make-up, and Mrs. Nation was grieved
thereat. His interference was a little thing in its way,
but it spoiled the glory of the thing. With some one
in power over and above her, out of reach of a
hatchet and not amenable to prayer, the editor for a
week did not feel at home/and therefore, while the
experience instilled in her an infatuation for journal
ism, it did not wholly come up to her expectations.
\A RS. CARRIE NATION, having for one week
/ V enjoyed the glory of running a newspaper in
* * Peoria, has decided that life without the joys
of journalism is a failure. Consequently she has es
tablished a paper of her own. It is named "The
Smashers'. Mail," and the Associated Press has al
ready announced to the world the publication of the
first number and given an account of its contents and
appearance.

Suppressing the Slave Tirade.
3ut the great achievement of Great
Britain, conceived long before the protect
orate and matured through many years of
hard struggle in the face of indigenous
customs, has been the abolition of legal
traffic in slaves from Zanzibar and East
ern Africa.
From time immemorial slaves were tak
en from Central Africa to the Mediter
ranean | states, to Egypt and Asia, and
until near the end of the eighteenth cen
tury most people had thought" slavery a
proper instftution. In 1794 an act of the
United States was passed forbidding slave
trade to anv foreign country- In 1S07 an
act of the British Parliament made the
trade illegal for British subjects and a
law of the United States forbade the im
portation of slaves into the Union. The

the slave trade on the east coast of. Africa
were in 1S22, when an engagement was ob
tained from tho Imam of Muskat and con
firmed by him In 1S39. by which he prom
ised to prohibit and prevent tho sale of
slaves to any Christian nation and to al
low British ships to seize all vessels found
within certain limits loaded with slaves.
In ISiy it was furthef agreed -with the
Imam that the export of slaves from his
African dominions, or from Africa into
his Asiatic possessions, should be prohib
ited under severest penalties. In 1872 Seyd
Barghash, yielding to the representations
of Sir John Kirk, ratified a treaty renounc
ing the transport of slaves by sea and
closing all public slave markets in his do
mains. In 1876 he Issued further decrees
prohibiting the fitting out of slave, cara
vans and the bringing of slaves to the
coast or transporting them by land, and
freeing all slaves held In certain ports.
Subsequent decrees were obtained from
the Sultan Khalifa In 1SS9 and 1S00. all
tending to the further emancipation of
slaves, until at last, in 1S37, the present
Sultan agreed to publish a decree abolish
ing entirely the status of slavery in the
islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. This
means, in the words of the then British
Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs â now
Lord Curzon, Viceroy of Indiaâ "that ev
â¢ery slave is at liberty to go before a
court established for that purpose, and to
claim his freedom. All he has to do is to
go before that court, prove his identity,
claim the liberty to which he Is entitled
and receive the papers which registered
that fact. No court can, from the passing
of that decree, enforce any claims upon
him by his former master." In the first
eighteen months SOOO slaves, male and fe
male, claimed their liberty. The freeing
of slaves is now proceeding, slowly but
surely, at the rate of about 2000 a year.
. Work of the Universities.
It was in 1S57 that Livingstone, while on
a visit to England, made his now historic
appeal to the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge to carry the gospel of Christ
to the heathen races of Central Africa.
"I go back to Africa," was his simple yet
eloquent story, "to try to make an open
path for commerce and Christianity. Do
you carry out the work which 1 1 have
begun? I leave it to you."
Half a century has passed and the re
sponse to that appeal is seen in Zanzibar
and on the shores of Lake Nyansa, in a
growing native church, wisely planted and
carefully nurtured by the Universities'
Mission to Central Africa, to whose good
work successive agents-general havo
borno ungrudging testimony. While the
first aim of the mission is to build up a
native ministry, who shall bo able to
bring home to their African brethren the
precious truths of the gospel in a way
that the African can comprehend, the
great linguistic studies and attainments
of Bishop Steere and others have already
aided the work of the Government offi
cials and merchants by reducing to writ
ing the Swahili language, through which
the commerce of the country la mainly
carried on.
At the same time by patiently training
in industrial work ana habits the released
slaves who, for many years past, have
been handed over to the care of the mis
sion, a rapidly Increasing body of capable
and trustworthy citizens is daily coming
forward to take their share in the trade
and well-being of their own land.
Benefits of Strong Foreign Role.
There is a SwahiU proverb that "those
who do a work do not fall to have a rea
son." It must have appeared presumpt
uous for European powers to meet in con
ference and to partition Africa among
themselves without the peoples concerned
having a say in the matter. But the re
sult has been beneficial. To have planted
among them those whose rule is based on
equality of treatment for all alike, with
out oppression on the one â¢hand, and,*
above all bribery on tho other, is in itself
an untold gain and the natives already
show their appreciation of the love of fair
play which has characterized the British
officials In their land. Another boon re
sulting from' the British protectorate- is
security. This was strikingly exemplified
when in lS9t> on the sudden death of Ha
mid bin Thwaln. under circumstances of
the gravest suspicion, Khalld Barghash,
who had already tried to usurp the throne
in 1S93, showed that he was prepared for
the crisis by immediately barricading the
palace and declaring his resolve to reign
or die. The next day Admiral Rawson,
with the Saint George, arrived from the
Cape and gave- the usurper his choice be
tween surrender and bombardment. All
Europeans were ordered on board ship
and early the following morning the
palace was shelled and the town fired.
This proved too much for Khalld. He fled
to the German consulate, from which he
was deported eventually to German East
Africa, where he remained under German
surveillance. His more peaceable elder
cousin. Hamud, the present occupant of
the throne, was proclaimed Sultan and
n*es his dominions in complete accord
ance with those Ministers who at tho
present time carry out the policy which
inspires the British protectorate In Zan

population of 90,000. is inhabited for the

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS.
Yet these Silver Republicans pretend to deceive
themselves in the hope to delude others, by pretending
that they follow the financial ideas of Lincoln by fol
lowing the banner of Bryan.
Mr. Bryan is in antagonism direct and positive to
everything taught on the money issue by Jefferson,
Jackson and Lincoln, as he is to the principles of
Cleveland. â¢ .-. , ,
It is not complimentary to the intelligence of these
Silver Republicans that they pronounce on the prin
ciples of Lincoln and Cleveland. The messages and
writings of Mr. Lincoln prove him to have been the
predecessor of Mr. Cleveland in decfaring the prin
ciples of sound money, which Cleveland made the polÂ»
star of his administration. Both Lincoln and Cleve
land stood exactly in line with Jefferson and Jackson
on the issue of sound money. Mr. Lincoln pointed
out in advance the evils of attempting to sustain the
greenback as a sufficient and permanent currency.
He foretold that appalling danger to the treasury and
the public credit which Mr. Carlisle called "the end
less chain." He especially pointed out the danger to
the wage-earners arising in such a permanent cur
rency, and twice recommended the national banking 1
system in his messages before his party had the cour
age to advance to his position and adopt it. Every
feature in Mr. Cleveland's financial policy was based
on that of Lincoln, so that the Republican party in
its gold standard and ether financial legislation is on
that issue distinctly the party of Lincoln.
These Silver Republicans left their party on th;
financial issue. They followed Dubois and Teller,
Towne and Stewart, in 1896. They deserted on the
one issue of finance. They took pains to pronounce
themselves Republicans on all other issues. Mr. Bryan
industiiotisly cultivated them ;r.d put himself forwari
as the reincarnation of Lincoln on finance. He still
keeps that myth to the fore, and undoubtedly expects
this incorporated contingent of Silver Republicans to
control the next Democratic convention and again
nominate him for the Presidency.
The Silver Republicans of Idaho have promptly fol
lowed the lead of Dubois by disbanding. In a caucus
they have put their little side party in its shroud and
coffin. In their ante-mortem statement they say that
they have examined the Bryan Democracy, have felt
its pulse, examined its palm, read its life line, taken
its temperature and smelled its breathâ in fact, have
examined as if for life insurance, and, as a result, an
nounce that it is as little likely to return to the prin
ciples of Cleveland as the regular Republican,
party is to return to the principles of Lin
coln. Therefore, keeping up the pretense of de
votion tp the principles of Lincoln, they announce
that those principles are now in the custody and keep
ing of Mr. Bryan? therefore, they enlist, enroll and
classify themselves as Bryan Democrats, in order to be
Lincoln Republicans.
No one can tell how long such a pretense will in
fluence the class of men who are dominated by it now.
Patterson, left the Democratic party several year3
ago and did not ever affiliate with" the Bryan wing.
He was president of the Populist national convention
at Sioux Falls and there nominated Bryan, alleging
as the reason for his action that Mr. Bryan repre
sented the principles of Populism and not Democracy.
It remains to be seen what will become of Mr. Pat
terson's Populist followers.
WHEN Mr. Dubois was re-elected Senator from
Idaho he formally abandoned Silver Republic
anism and declared himself a Bryan Democrat.
When Patterson of Colorado was elected Senator by a
fusion Legislature he promptly abandoned, Populism
and allied ' himself formally with the Bryan Democ
racy.

There is a limit, beyond which a ship cannot carry

with Its wonderful scenic effects and
startling changes, is In it3 last week at
the Grand Opera-house. Repetition j has

Paul Egry, the Hungarian violin virtuoso,

Full houses are the rule at the Central

placing before the public such sterling
and attractive playa as It has been doing
of late and of having them played by
talent equal to that which appeared last
night in "Captain Impudence," full housed
wfll be the rule always. "Captain Impu
dence" is well staged and as the curtain
rose on each of the two scenes the audi
ence testified Its appreciation by. a spon
taneous burst of applause. It is a taking
play with Its American soldiers and
swarthy Mexicans, and the leading parts
are acted with. a fidelity to nature that
is not surpassed at houses of entertain
ment where the rates are double and
treble those of the Central. Major Hanni

satisfactory. Clifford Dempsey, the lead

be said of "Taming- a Husband." It has
a moral and Js also fuli of wit that floats
on a steady undercurrent of humor, John
nie Johns, monologist, also furnishes his
portion of amusement. Mr. and Mrs.
Mark Murphy appear this week for the
first time in a sketch entitled "The Sev
enth Son." Like other numbers of the
bill. It has the merit of originality and is
well played and staged. Wilson and War-
Ing, in a farcical skit, conclude an excel
lent bill.
Paplnta is billed this week at the Or
pheum as "Introducing new and sensa
tional effects." The announcement is ac
curate. Papinta has appeared here many
times, and upon eacn visit has presented
Orpheum audiences with some additional
creations of her genius, and they have
been appreciated. Her past efforts, though
they well demonstrated her talent, will
be hidden behind the memory of this, her
present appearance. Papinta's terpsicho
rean efforts are always In the midst of
gorgeous color effect *hat no other word
than "Oriental" will describe. This is
true, but her dances are not "Oriental."
They are the result, as a rule, of her own
thought. Her "fire dance" this week is
truly up to the announcement â "sensa
tional." Whirling in a maze of lire-tlnt^l
silk, she at last sinks to the floor, while
high above her apparent tongues of flame
leap out from the dark shadows below.
Kven more beautiful is the "dance fl th<?
lily." A mass of silver silk Is twirled by
the wands in the artist's hands until it
creeps upward and folds into the contour
of a huge lily, fades In the ever-changing
light and disappears. Though weary fro: n
her efforts, Paplnta was twice recalled to
salute her audience, which offered Its
plaudits, and with its plaudits full proof
of its appreciation.
Enough fun for a teason is being fur
nished nightly at the Orpheum this week,
and the Bunth and Rudd company is the
cause of the concluding spasm of laugh
ter.- The clever eccentrics of this com
pany present a line of comedy features
that hold an additional charm through
their originality. There is nothing old
in all they do, and there is as little that
is not funny as there !i that is old.
Orpheum.
needs the dynamic assistance â other
wise boostâ at the Lands of the other.
"The Highwayman" is a hold-up at the
price, but Loie Fuller may be always
with us and welcome. She brings this
time two dances that have set Paxis afire
for the last year, the "Archangel" and
the "Tempest," and gives besides the "La
Loie Fuller" valse and the "Xanevllle
Danse du Feu," before seen here. In the
new dances Miss Fuher shows herself
even more of an artist that we had before
known her to be. The color effects are
bewildering In their novel beauty. At
once delicate and brilliant, subtle and
daring, a dazzling, shimmering, luminous,
radiant mass of diaphanous drapery,
shifting and curving in lovely line through
an opalescent dream of color. The danced
from beginning to end are amazingly
artistic. The "Archangel," in which the
famous 1000-yard silk dress Is used, quite
lives up to the name, and It is not at all
difficult to understand why Paris, artistic
Paris, should have gone wild over these
color and form creations of the clever
American girl.
As to "The Highwayman," there Is. lit
tle or nothing to recommend the opera.
Had this been the first effort of. the clever
compopersâ as It has every appearance
of being â De Koven and Smith would have
had few laurels to look to, though Lc
Kovcn's part in the affair is the more
worthy of the two. The first act ends
with a very good chorus and tho second
contains two good songs, but outside of
these there is little of worth. The set
ting of the opera is Indifferently good, the
fame with the costuming, and acting and
singing alike lack spiritâ though doubt
less much may here be laid at the com
poser's door.
Edmund Stanley, the highwayman, has
a strong and sweet voice, and did bravo
service In lifting the dead level of the
performance. Helen Ralnsley was a
graceful and sweet-voiced Pamela, and
the comedy interest was indifferently well
taken care of by H. W. Tre Denick as the
detective. Foxy Quilltr. His voice is
good, however, as are also those of Ar
thur Cunningham, W. H. Thompson and
S. H. Forde. La Loie and "The High
wayman" go another week.
IT did not take long last night at
the Columbia Theater to determine

Edwin Joslyri. the four-year-old son of
W. E. Joelyn. advertising manager of the
Emporium, met with an accident last Sat
urday that may result fatally. The tiny
lad was leaning over the baluster on the
cecond floor of his parents" residence, 2016
Bush street, when he lost his balance and
plunged head foremost to the floor below.
He struck on his head and was rendered
unconscious.
An examination of the child's injurie*
disclosed a fracture of the skull. Though
the best care Is being given the unfortu
r.ate child, it is feared ihat he cannot sur
vive his injuries.

Mr. i3ucKlin was for several years man

a year and a. half ago he gave up that

up the What Cheer House he has not
been engaged in business, although he had
laid plans to enter into active work again
foon.
Mr. Bucklin was married in lhe East.
His wife died about five years ago.
The deceased was always distinguished
for his pood humor and charity and in
r.is long life in this section he had ac
quired an exceptionally large number of

Motion Overwhelmingly Defeated.
At trie conclusion of the argument Hon.
Charles \V. Slack, who presided at the
meeting in the absence of the president.
Warren Olney, stated that originally he
had been in favor of ihe proposed scheme
of reorganization of the State's judiciary,
but that upon further reflection he felt
convinced that the proposed amendment
would not afford the desired relief and
that it would occasion Increased delay and
expense in litigation. Ho thought that a
constitutional amendment should tako the
form of; a careful revision of the present
constitutional provlsiohu and the repeal of
the provisions authorizing the Supreme
Court to hear and decide causes in de
partment, restricting the right of appedl
and relieving the Supreme Court, in part
at all events, from the unnecessary task
of rendering written opinions in all cases^.
and thnt with this aid theiSupreme Court
could by revision of Its own rules dis
charge with reasonable satisfaction the
important duties. imDosed upon It.
The motion to adopt Dr. Taylor's reso
lution was then put to a vote and failed,
there being an overwhelming vote in the
negative. _____^_____ v
It was shown that the Supreme Court
under this provision wnuld have no dis
cretion in the matter of ordering- to be
heard before itself causes coming within
the defined class. In view of the many
conflicting decisions to be found in the
129 volumes of the California Reports, It.
would not be difficult, the lawyers de
clared, to find decisions with which a, very
large. majority of all :he cases to be de
cided in the District Courts of Appeal
would conflict. The result would un
doubtedly be that In nearly all cases of
any importance petitions would be made
to the Supreme Court to obtain a review
of decisions rendered in the District Court
of Appeals, and the Supreme Court, if
it dealt with such petitions with any de
gree of liberality, wouid find itself called
upon to review a very Jarge proportion of
all the cases decided by the Court of Ap
peals. The burden imposed upon the Su
preme Court would not be diminished, but
more likely would be increased, and liti
gants, instead of finding the decision of
their cause expedited, would find that they
had merely added to the delay in tho
Supreme Court the delav which undoubt
edly would arise in tho District Courts of
Appeal. The Supreme Court would not be
relieved, the speedy decision of causes
would not be attained and "the peop'e
would be burdened with the expense c-i
the increased judicial machinery.
Several members then addressed the
meeting in opposition to the resolution
and many important, reasons were ad
vanced against its adoption.
In so far as â¢ the proposed amendment
makes the jurisdiction of the District
Courts final, it was declared, the result
would be that the State would have three
co-ordinate courts, each at liberty to es
tablish precedents and to disregard the
decisions of the others. The effect of
such a system would tend to depart from
uniformity of law and toward uncertain
ty and confusion.*
As a means of correcting this defect, it
was pointed out, the proposed amendment
provides as follows:,
* In any cause decided by a District Court of
Appeal, if the decision of such Court of Ap
peal conflicts with a previous decision of the
Supreme Court, or of another District Court
of Appeal, the Supreme Court shall, upon pe
tition to be filed within thirty days after entry
of Judgment in the District Court of Appeal,
order the cause to be heard by the Supreme
Court, and thereupon the record shall be trans
mitted to the Supreme Court, which shall hear
and determine the cause.
Show Faults of Proposed Measure.
. At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon a gen
eral meeting of the Bar Association of
San Francisco was held for the purpose
of considering and acting upon Senate
constitutional amendment No. 15. This
proposed amendment provides for the
creation of three District Courts of Ap
peal and the distribution of appellate Jur
isdiction between such courts and . the
present Supreme Court. This amendment
Is In most respects the same as the
amendment which was submitted to the
people at the last election and failed of
adoption. Several changes, however,
have been made for the -purpose of. meet
ing some of the criticisms which were
directed against that amendment, the
most Important of which is a provision
providing- for the transfer of an appellate
case from the appellate courts to tho
Supreme Court or vice versa, in cases
where the. appellant has appealed to the
wrong court.
Dr. Edward R. Taylor, the chairman of
the committee of the Bar Association, ap
pointed to co-operate with a committee
of the Los Angeles Bar Association to
prepare and present to the Legislature an
amendment of the articles of the present
constitution relating to the judiciary,
moved the adoption of a resolution that
it was the sense of the Bar Association of
San Francisco that Senate constitutional
amendment No. 15 should pass. In sup
port of his motion Dr. Taylor said,
among other things, that this amendment
represented the best thought, not only
of the present committee, but of commit
tees heretofore appointed for this same
purpose during the last fifteen years; that
it was well known that the Supreme
Court was approximately three years be
hind In its work; that its calendar was
overcrowded with cases and that even
with the. aid of the commission It was
unable to keep pace with the constantly
increasing volume of appealed cases; that
the proposed amendment was Intended to
relieve the present congested condition
by providing for a division of labor and
thereby facilitating the speedy determi
nation of litigation.

!CEW YOKK. March 11â To-day's stock
market wan a dull one in rplte of the
...'-Â¦ irJinirfjot.ions s irj wi<3Â© r'^cc niovc"
nu-nts in seme individual stocks. The
inertia Of the peneral market in spite of these
points of activity cove the whole a very spotty
appearance. Professional operations were ob
viously responsible in a large degree for such
<t(-alingÂ« as occurred and for the manipulation
which txapKerated the price movement. Where
professional manipulation was not at work the
tlay*e movement will be tÂ»**n to have been very
felugfris-b Â»n<1 not a few losses are recorded
erea uraont stocks which are usually promi
nent in the market. The Interruption of tele
graphic communication on account of the
ftrom curtailed activity te some extent. Of
the day's ppedal movements that in Burling
ton attracted the most attention. St. Paul
eold ex riehte this morning, the rights being
quoted at 4^ to i\, reducing the price to 150
or under. This gave the supporters of Bur
lington Â«n opportunity to lift that stock over
Ft. Pnul to i;n*. a rise over Saturday of 2*4-
The movement seemed to be based purely on
the consideration that Burlington has had its
Mshts to subscribe to new stock while the
dividend rate iÂ» already 6 per cent, with a 6
ner or-rt rat* for St. Paul still to be estab
lished. There Â»a> no news regarding the
ftock l)Â°votid the old rumor of refunding. The
coal carrying roads were strong with a few
exceptions. Â« here an advance has already been
made. There wan an early decline of over a
point in Sutar on account of the cut In the
price of refined sugar. The stock rallied to
well over Saturday, but cloned the day un
changed. Oreat Northers preferred was marked
tip <> point* In connection with the presence In
this city of the president and rumors that a
melon iw to Â»>e cut. Amalgamated Copper was
irtrcng. The dismissal of the Injunction against
the aonc.rptlcn oC the CugKenhclm Interests by
the American .Snv-IMng Company caused a rise
In those Kt<M-ks of 3'.Â» for the common and 2 for
the preferred. The realiet&g movement In the
last hour cut down ail these advance* to some
extent and in the active stocks reactions ran
from 1 to 2 points, with th* closing easy.

WEATHEIl CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, March 11.â In addition to all the
other detriments to business with which traders
In Wheat have had to contend recently were
added prostrated wires, which not only delayed
news but shut off outsider orders. Trading
was therefore more than ever a family affair
throughout a conspicuously Inanimate session.
The fact that the Government report gave the
quantity of Wheat In farmers* hands which was
due after trading hours rendered speakers still
more loth to take on themselves any unneces
sary obligations. May opened unchanged to VÂ»c
lower at 75 r Jig-75%cj fluctuations were narrow
and few, the close being easy, }ic lower at
75Â»ic.
The same conditions in Wheat were potent in
the Corn market, with a weak tendency. May
closed U6Hc lower at 4O4c.
Oats were dull and easier. May closed Vi@?Â»c
lower.
Provisions were dull and ruled easier under
liquidation, lack of outside support and on large
Hog receipts. May Pork closed 15c lower; Lard,
2Hc down and Ribs unchanged.

CLOSING,
1 The impending, settlement to-morrow had a
dampening effect upon the markets here to
day. Dealings were slack in all departments
and the tone was dull, partly on the report
that negotiations with General Botha had
proved abortive.
American stocks were quiet. Erie shares and
Reading were wanted here on the news that
the companies have offered to maintain the
wages of coal miners.
The . bank statement waa almost entirely ig
nored here.

NEW YORK. March 11.â A drop of 60 points
in tin In the local metal market occurred un
der liquidation as the result of an unfortunate
but statistical situation and a lack of specu

abroad. London closing about Â£1 12s 6d lower

telegraphed large selling orders. Europe, too.
offered several considerable blocks of near
month delivery cotton, while there appeared to
be practically, no . buyers -other than slight
room demand of profit-taking orders, which
were -readily-, appeased. The - factors . which
prompted the selling for both accounts com
prised weak - cables, reports that New Eng
land mills were going to resort to short time,
heavy port receipts. - forecasts for an increased
movement In the Southwest, rumors of urgent
epot offerings South. and claims that planters
were making every preparation to at least
duplicate last year's acreage. -The market was

New Library.
McKINXEY MAY OFFICIATE.
Will Be Asked to Dedicate San Jose's
SAM JOSE. Marcl 11.â It Is probable
that President McKInlcy will lay the cor
nerstone of the Andrew Carnegie free
public library in San Jose. The news of
the iron king's plft of $50,000 to this city
and of the chief extcutive's final deter
mination to make San Jose a day's visit
on his Western trip was received almost
simultaneously and the people of the city
are exultant at the honors granted them.
The suKBe.stlon that the cornerstone of
the library building should be laid by the
President has been taken up by the Rose
Carnival executive committee and every
effort will be made to carry it out.
The plans for the library building have
already been drawn, a competition of the
architects of this cllv and some from San
Francisco having been held and the draw-
Ings of Y. 1), Hensill piven preference by
a committee composed of the librarians
of Stanford and Berkeley. A number of
prominent local men including Mayor C.
J. Martin and O. A. Hale, went to Sacra
mento this mornlnp to urge the immediate
passage of a bill setting aside a portion
of Normal Square for the use of the
library. If this l,c promptly done the
work of excavation may commence at
once and it will be easily ready for the
layinK of the cornerstone by the time of
the President's visit
One of the principal Fportlng features
proposed for the carnival is a great meet
of automobiles an<1 -bicycles. The two
automobile dribs or San Francisco will be
invited to participate in the parade and
in races afterward. The Garden City
Wheelmen have planned to give races at
their park and as soon as Floyd McFar
iand ar.lvcs from Los Angeles with his
bunch of swift riders definite arrange
ments will be completed. The two affairs
âthe automobile and bicycle racesâ may
be combined and > large purses hung up
for the contestants.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 11.â A committee com
posed of Alfred Holman, J. It. Welch and
O. A. Hale came up from San Jose last
evening with a .bill, to allow the trustees
of the San Jose State- Normal- School â¢ to
Bet a&ide. a lot of an acre and a half of
the school grounds to be used as a site
for tl'fe library which Andrew Carnegie
has promised the city "of San Jose. This
mornlnp the bill was introduced In the'
Senate by Onoal. It will go to print and
then will be put. through both houses on
urgency resolutions. Carnegie has prom
ised to build a library to cost $50,000.

there was no trouble at the polls, and only
one arrest was recorded during the day
that was directly traceable to the elec
tion.
The man who felt the heavy hand of the
law was Bert Swan, former Deputy Coun
ty Clerk, and now County Gardener. He
was doing a little politics in the western
end of the city and ran against Policeman
Gardiner. The policeman had been or
dered to keep active politicians beyond the
red flags that marked the 100-foot line
about the polling places. Bert Swan would
not yield obedience to the mandate of the
policeman and there was a little mix-up
that resulted in Swan being- sent to the
City Prison with a charge of resisting an
officer placed against his name. It took
him but a very few moments to get out of
jail, his friends contributing the $30 that
was required, and he was at once released.
Swan has been very active in this fight

known as the "Pondinky Club," that held

the interests of the Municipal League
ticket, and some of the more earnest
members are inclined to. ascribe this ar
rest to politics. '
The election was very quiet,- and fell
nearly a thousand votes short of what
was expected. The total vote was 9705.
whereas it was thought that it would run
nearly 11,000. There was a big rush in the
morning while the commuter voters were
going to their trains, and there was the
usual rush in the afternoon when those
commuters who did not vote In the morn
ing were trying to get their ballots into
the boxes upon their? return.
The long breaths of the .nrght before
election Droved not to be warranted, for
aside from the arrest of Swan there was
nothing that partook of a criminal nature.
Very few were arrested for being drunk,
for the saloons generally closed. Every
body seemed good natured. and while they
were voting against each other with a
hearty earnestness it went no further than
the ballot box.
One of the remarkable features of the
day was the absence of candidates about
the polls. The Municipal League ordered
Its candidates to remain in their home pre
cincta, but this order was too strict to be
literally obeyed. W. A. ; Dow, candidate
for City Attorney; George W.-Dornin. B.
C. Cuvelller and C. H. Daly, all Municipal
League candidates at large for the Coun
cil, strayed off their reservations. Dornin

Seventh "Ward to look about and see
how some of his friends on the Municipal
League ticket were running. -~
Anson Barstow, the Republican nomi
nee for Mayor, made, one trip about the
city, but did not put himself very much
in evidence. Walter G. Manuel, the Mu
nicipal League candidate for the same po
sition, remained in the Third Ward, hla
home. John L. Davle. the Independent
was through the Second Ward and tha
western end of the city all day. Warren

the Fifth, his home ward.
David E. Bortree, the Democratic nomi
nee for Treasurer, who hoped to slip in
between C. B. Morgan, the Republican,

drove about the city alone. Felton, Tay

was on the witness stand during the fore
noon and part of the afternoon in his
$10,000 libel suit against D. E. O'Keefe of
tho Redwood City Times-Gazette. He
was examined along the lines of his tes
timony of Friday afternoon. MansHeltl
denied he had heard any public criticism
of himself or Judge Buck in reference to
the trial of Deslrelio for the murder, of
the Johnson boy. lu reference to an ed
itorial published in a San Francisco paper
criticizing the trial the witness gave it as
his opinion that w all the newspapers like
to stand In with one another, anyhow"
Mansfield said. that on the miming after
the murder he had gone to Colma and
from there to San Francisco, where he re
mained until after the .Goroner's Inquest.
The Sheriff claimed, he was not .pleased

aloof. However, he thought he had done
his duty as Sheriff. '. â¢ â¢'. Â¦
Â¦ Judpe Buck of the Superior Court of

xm the stand. He denied the charpea
made In O'Keefe's paper that he had
failed to aid In tlw prosecution of"De

atlon for Sheriff Mansfield. .He aatd that
official was just and upright, and for that
reason- he- had allowed him to summon
the juries to try l>ealrello. though the
defendant in the case was a friend of the
Sheriff and had been his deputy.
Judne Buck said the Deslrelio trial hid
been conducted with the utmost fairness.
On cross-examination he admitted that
the relations between himself and Editor

OAKLAND. March 11 (midnight).â
The results of to-day's municipal
election in this city as shown by
the count up to this hour leave no
doubt that the Republicans will
control the patronage branch of the city
gcvernrmnt for the next two years-by the
certain election of James A. Johnson as
; City Attorney and Frederick Turner as
I City Engineer, they being- a majority of
| the Board of Works. On the other hand,
the Municipal League will control the
City Council, though extremely close con
1 tests in the First, Third and Fourth wards
make the extent of that control very
i iloubtful. Anson Barstow Is probably
\ elected Mayor, though at midnight the
i vote was close.
The unexpected run made by John L.
Davie cut more deeply into the vote of
F.arstow than into that of Manuel and
made the result somewhat uncertain dur
ing the evening.
If Barstow is elected, as the results at
this hour seem to indicate, it will give
complete control of the Board of Public
Works to the Republicans.
Control of Council Uncertain.
The control of the Council is none too
certain, and the Republicans are claim
ing that they have six votes, while the
Municipal League is not too sure of its
hold.
The only two men who seem to have
teen elected by no uncertain vote are B.
C Cuvelller, Counci' ; man-at-large on the
Municipal League ticket, and Louis Schaf
fer. Republican non:lnee in the Second
Ward. Cuvellier got the highest vote of
any Councilman-at-large and Schaffer
carried his ward by 476.
Some of the ward votes are very close
and the indications are that Charles A.
Bon, for Councilman at large on the Re
publican ticket, has beaten either Burt
chaell or Daly on the Municipal League
ticket. The Republicans, at midnight,
claim three members of the Council for
a certainty â Fitzgerald of the Third
Ward. Boyer of the Fourth, Schaffer
of the Sixth and Wixon, who was an In
dependent Republican, in the Second
Ward, and who will probably vote with
the Republicans In the legislative body
In addition the Republicans claim that
Bon will defeat either Burtchaell or Daly,
the three running very close. If Bon
wins it will give the Republicans five
votes and will leave the First Ward to
control.
1:30 a. m.â The contest in the First
Ward is very close and at 12:30 a. m.
Ruch, the Municipal League candidate,
certainty, with a chance for the First
Ward and a remote possibility of getting
their four men at large. The First Ward,
which is the newly annexed district, will
probably decide, the complexion of the
new Council, and at midnight the League
candidate was fourteen votes ahead.
At this hour complete returns from forty
out of fifty precincts in the city gave the
following results, showing Barstow is
being pressed very closely, but' probably
elected, Johnson for City Attorney and
Turner for City Engineer certainly elect
ed: also Taylor for Treasurer and Breed
for Auditor, while the City Council fight

terests, had failed to take Into considera
tion the gooii will ana business of the

tioners were "William M. Donald. Steven

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 11.â Captain Tuttle of
the United Staus revenue cutter Bear is
authority for the statement that the loca
tion of a fabulously rich gold mine. 120
niles from Xorae, which was foimd fifty
years apo by two whaler* and later lost,
baa been rediscovered.
It was only the dyinpr statement of one
of the men that received any credence. A
half-century elapsed before any one even
took this t-tory seriously enough to even
ittterr.pt to verify it.
This* atiornrit was made last summer
durlus: the Nome rush, through an expedi
tion sent out by Sol Simpson and Captain
Tuttle. W. E. Hartley and Richard P
Turkman of this city led the party. They
not only found the gold mine discovered
live decades* apo but verified everv state
ment of the original discoverers as to its
richness.
Jt was a letter addressed to Captain
1 uttle in April. 1300. by J. F. Dickey a
;.iime*>r of California, that led to the at
tempt to rediscover the gold mine found
by the two whalers. . It part the letter
reads:
As tho great rush now wems to b* toward
the AlH*kan gold fields. It brings to ray mind
a stÂ»ry of nn oM Arctic whaler. Captain De
JV.se by name, told to me about twenty-flve
vrpre aco. The letter said that years prior to
that date he was up in the- Arctic: that it was
late in the eeason â September â and that they
were working their way out. They anchored
Â«ne day near the Ameriran thorn Two of the
F;ulors look a boat and went ashore, where
they discovered nuppets of rÂ»!d lyinj? loose on
the jrroumi. Ttiey -went to filling- their pockets
Â¦w-uh them, but had t*-en so encace'l but a
few rrr.nuies when the captain of the ehiu
fcailfd them and told them to cocie aboard.
The oartaln saw what the men had. but
he coul-5 take no chanres In the pack Ice that
was cnmiiiK In. He had to weigh anchor and
pot oft to prevent being raupht in the Arctic
for the winter. Taptain De Hnise always paid
that he wanted to to back; that he thieved
he could load a ship with gold from that
b^ach. It va* so plentiful. He tried to pet
fhlpowners In San Francisco Interested enough
In the matter to fit him out with a vessel.
but they wr.uld not take any stock In an old
pallor's yarn and he had no mon?y of his own.
< "onsequently he had to aba-ndon the project.
He was finally taken ill. and came to San
IMegn for his health, but died here at the Bay
View Hotel. I pat up with him a couple of
niffhts Marine his sickness, when he told mÂ«
of bis adventures.
If rr.y recollection serves me rirht Captain
T>e Boise said they found this goli about 100
miles n-rtiJ of the Strait*.

FORGER BIRD TRIES TO
END LIFE IN PRISON
Swallows a Dose of Poison and Is
With Difficulty Saved From
I>eath.
LOS ANGELES, March 11.â R. A. Bird,
a prisoner at the County Jail, attempted
to commit suicide to-day by taking poison.
Bird has been serving as bookkeeper of
the prison. The Jailer. Instructed him to
prepare a solution of carbolic acid for dis
infecting purposes. Bird went to the drug
room, compounded the mixture and then,
taking a bottle of chloral from, a high
shelf, ho swallowed about four ounces
of the poison. He returned to his cell and
lay down to his last sleep, but the jailer
happened to enter and noticed his ghastly
pallor. After three hours' work by physi
cians he was restored. When. his recov
ery was assured. Bird said:
"This is a poor return for., all your
courtesy. I am sorry that I have caused
you all this trouble, but it was the im
pulse, of a moment. The delay in the de
cision of my appeal to the Supreme Court
has worried me. I have been-, brooding
over my misfortunes. I. feared that" my
mind would give way."
Bird was the private secretary and con
fidential friend of Griffith J. Griffith, the
capitalist. He was 'charged with having
forgfd his employer's name to a check
for $200. The trial was one of the most
fiercely contested ever held In Southern
California. It is estimated that the cost
to Â¦ the county Â¦ of prosecuting Bird would
amount altogether to about $30,000. Con
viction* followed the first trial and Bird
was sentenced to ten years In San Quen
tln. %
Strike of Natural Gas.
ANGELS CAMP. March 11.â A flow of
natural gas was discovered at Central Hill
last week by. Harvey Spinolla. He was
Kinking a' shaft and had cut through a
layer of sand when he noticed a- peculiar
odor arising from the water. In the bot
tom of the shaft. On placing a candle
near the water the gas ignited. Spinolla
turned his discovery to good acount and
is now pursuing his search for gold by the
light of . natural gas, having dispensed
with the. use of candles. This discovery is
believed to bo an. Indication of oiL â¢
adelphla, praying that the protest be
given due. consideration.
The President gave, the committee near
ly an hour and listened with interest to
their statements. He said he did not feel
like exercising his authority for holding
an extra session of the House of Dele
gates, but would recommend that the ex
ecutive council use the utmost leniency in
enforcing the provisions of the tax law.
The members of the committee hope to
see the President again in the near future.
WASHINGTON, March ll.-The Presi
dent this morning granted a special audi
ence to Wenceslay Borda Jr. and Vlncente
Balbas, members of the- Porto Rican Com
mittee, which was appointed at a mass
meeting of the citizens of the island held
at San Juan on February 2 to protest
against the law enacted by the Legisla
ture known as the Hollander bill. Thli
measure provides for the raising of rev
enue by property and excise taxes.
- Tho Commissioners presented a formal
protest which enumerated a series of
eighteen objections to the law. It is con
tended that there exists to-day in Porto
Rico three taxes levied and collected for
the same purpose "from the impoverished
pockets of the people"â the new excise
taxes under the Hollander law, the old
insular and municipal taxes and the cus
toms duties under the Porto Rican civil
government act. - -
Under the bill $500,000 more will be col
lected Bcml-.innually, in advance, thereby,
the protest says, lessening the money in
circulation (of which there Is less than
$2,000,000) and producinp a state of impov
erishment and business stagnation. It is
asserted that the measure is both an in
come, and property. tax law; that two of
the principal industries of the Island (rum
and tobacco) are .taxed so heavily- that
their production under present circum
stances is practically prohibited; that the
only standard of valuation of property
will be- the personal opinion of. the as
cessors. â¢
Â¦ The people of Â¦ Porto Rico; the protest
says, are ready and willing to meet all
taxes necessary for the maintenance of
orde.r. justice and good government. The
Commissioners ask the President that
Governor Allen be directed to calla spe
cial session of the Legislature to amend
the .law In. a manner which will relieve
the people of the burdens complained of,
and' that the Governor be directed to ex
ercise'care In the appointment of Asses
sors. The Commissioners also presented
a- petition of bankers, merchants and
other business men of New York and Phil-
Porto Rican Representatives

WASHINGTON, March 11.â Vice Presi

with the President to-day, but nothing
was disclosed aÂ» to the nature of his visit.
The Vice President will leave "Washing

this week. His summer plans contemplate
a quiet stay at Oyster Bay. The Vice
President will not accompany the Presi

A number of prominent leaders In both

before departing for their homes. Among
them were Senators. Jones of Arkansas,
Beverldpe of Indiana, Bard of California
and Teller and Patterson of Colorado.
ROOSEVELT CONSULTS
. WITH THE PRESIDENT
Dismissal of the Pension Office Chief
Demanded, but the President
Withstands the Pressure.
WASHINGTON, March 11.â The dis
missal of Pension Commissioner H. Clay
Evans is demanded by many pension at
torneys and Grand Army men.
The reason for the concerted attack
upon the commissioner is not hard to
find. "When the law of 1800 was enacted
pension attorneys reaped a rich harvest.
The more successful attorneys became
millionaires. They skimmed the cream off
profits under that law within three years.
When Commisslonei Evans was appointed
they expected that he would take upon
himself the functlo/u of Congress and
practically enact iiew pension laws by
putting new constructions on those al
ready on the statute books. Commissioner
Evans did not believe tho constructions
demanded by the attorneys were Justified
by the laws and he declined to assume
legislative functions.
From that time until the present a sys
tematic campaign has been waged against
the commissioner. Political pressure of
the most powerful kind has been brought
to boar on President McKlnley to secure
his removal, but thus far the President
has -Â¦withstood this pressure. Up to tha
present time Commissioner Evans has
given no Indication of an intention to re
tire voluntarily and President McKinley
has not authorized any statement' that
his removal is contemplated.

to the Crown. '
.LONDON. March 11.â Another attemDt
Is soon to be made to obtain royal clem
ency for Mrs. Maybrick. Baroness de
Roques, Mrs. Maybrick's mother, has been
In London during the last week In con
sultation with her legal advisers for the
purpose of framing a petition to the crown
for her daughter's pardon. It has been
intimated that the prospect of bringing
about such a denouement has not dimin
ished owing to the accession of his Majes
ty Edward VII, but quite the contrary.
One of the stanchest supporters of Bar
oness de Roques is J. H. Levy, chairman
of the Personal Rights Association of the
National Liberal Olub. He has had sev
eral conferences with Mr. Choate on tho
propriety of presenting a"n address to the
crown through the Home Office. Mr.
Choate, while declining officially to take
part In such proceedings, has nevertheless
assured the friends of Mrs. Maybrick that
he will do everything he can do In .as pri
vate capacity to further their object.
KING WILL BE ASKED
TO GRAirr THE PARDON
BERLIN, March 11.â In the Reichstag
to-day during a debate on the budget for
German r East Africa, Herr Bebel, Social
ist, made several severe attacks upon the
administration of the colonies.
Dr. Stuebel, Secretary of the Colonial
Office, In a lengthy reply, admitted that
the commercial conditions In the colonies
were not so good as ra!gh$ be wished, but
this was principally due' to lack of com
munication. , The revolts were not due to
the collection of taxes, nor to the execu
tion of nineteen chiefs, which had oc
curred under circumstances admitting of
no other course. Slavery was no longer
legal, the only slaves now existing being,
those persons born. in slavery.
Dr. Stuebel concluded his reply by say
ing .that Captnln Kannenburgj- had been
convicted of a fatal assault, sentenced to
three years' Imprisonment and dismissed
from the service. Captain Kannenburg
was charged with having committed a
number ot cruel crimes In German East
Africa and arrived In Berlin In April, 1900,
to be tried by court martial.
Herr Bebel tried to raise the question Of
the commutation of the death sentence of
Lieutenant Prince Prosper von Arenburg
for the murder of a native In German
East Africa In 1S99, but the president of
the house refused to allow the question.
on the ground that the commutation of
the penalty was a special action of clem
ency by the Emperor, of which he need
not give account to any one.
Herr Von Volmar, Centrist, urged that
the immigration of Boers to Southwest
'Africa should be encouraged as much as
possible.
Herr Bebel said the Government had al
ready expended a total of 80,000.000 marks
In East Africa, while German, trade with
that territory had steadily declined,
amounting In 1S99 to only one-third of the
expenditure for the year. Professor Hase.
pan-German, admitted the decline of
trade with German East Africa.

POOR RESULTS
FROM COLONIES
Besides the foreign -.representatives, a
large crowd gathered at the station to Bid
the Minister and his family farewell.
Thus it appears clearly that Mr. Rock
hill is not in any sense a successor of Mr..
Conger as United. States Minister at Pe
king at this time, but remains simply Spe
cial Commissioner, limited In his functions
to the negotiations with the Chinese Gov
ernmentand the other Ministers for a set
tlement of the troubles growing out of the
Boxer uprising. ...
"CONGER."
"PEKING. March 11.â I leave Peking to
day for America. SquJers Is left In charge.'
Mr. Conger's' message was as follows
WASHINGTON. March 11.â A cablegram
received at the State Department to-day
announces the departure of Minister Con
ger, en route to the United States. His
sixty days' leave of absence will begin
when he reaches San Francisco.
Companies A and B of the Ninth United
States Infantry have been notified that
they are to remain In China. It -Is be
lieved that Major Robertson .will com
mand them.
PEKING. March 11.â United States Min
ister Conger left this morning. All the
foreign Ministers bade him farewell at the
railway station.

"Considerable uneasiness In consequence
of the extreme friction- is believed to exiei
between the Yangtse Viceroys and LI
Hung Chang."
LONDON, March ll.-The Times In Its
second edition to-day published a dispatch
from Shanghai, March 11, saying:
"it is reported upon trustworthy au
thority that Russia has notified China that
unless the Manchurlan convention Is
signed at an early named date, she (Rus
sia) will withdraw the convention and
substitute harder terms in Its place. Li
Hung Chang declares that he Is powerless
to resist and has appealed to tne United
States, Great Britain, Germany and Ja
pan to Intervene In China's behalf.
Alleged Threat of Russia.
Whilo accepting the Russian disclaimer
of any purpose to occupy Manchuria per
manently, the administration Is already
taking measures for the protection of
American trade In that province In the fu
ture. Throughout the negotiations the
President and Secretary Hay have not
lost sight of the necessity of insisting
upon the preservation of the "open door."
Being never sure that the negotiations
could be concluded without precipitating
a partition of China, the administration
has been prepared to make a prompt
agreement with any power seizing terri
tory that would protect American trade.
Accepting Russia's explanations, notwith r
standing the doubt cast upon them by the
British press, it has been suggested that
the United States submit an agreement to
the powers, Including Russia, which will
establish forever the free character of the
port of Newchwang. This Is now being
considered. t â¢' Â¦
. CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, ; N.
W., WASHINGTON, March 11.â Positive
denial is made at the State Department
of the stgry that the United States Gov
ernment had made a protest against Riis
slan encroachments In Manchuria. No
circular note urging concerted action by
the powers to resist aggression by Russia
or any other power has been Issued .by
this Government. The note of February
19 Is evidently being misrepresented or
misunderstood In London. It was ad
dreEsed to China and copies were, sent to
all the powers. In it the United States
urged the Chinese Government to refrain
from entering Into any secret or separate
understanding with any power regarding
the cession of territory or financial obli
gations.

A romance In HIspano-Arcerlcan life In
volving the history of two republics was
disclosed yesterday by the Issuance of a
license to marry to Cayetone Bosquet.
aged 74, and Mercedes Sanchez, aged 48.
Lesral Impediments may yet Intervene to>
delay the marriage, but there Is a deter
mination on the part of the woman, who
for over twenty-four years has been Bos
quet's constant companion, to legalize, If
possible, her seven children, of whom ha
Is the father.
Bosquet, whose days are drawing to a
close, has had a checkered career. HÂ©
was born in Guadalajara. Mexico. His
father was a revolutionist, and, as a
young man, he became Imbued with the
spirit of freedom and was forced to leave
his native country-
Mercedes Castro, sister of a President of
the United States of Colombia, had some*
years before â¢ been married to a man
named Sanchez. By him she bore two
children. The union proved unhappy.
Bosquet and the woman linked their for
tunes in Panama. They came to Califor
nia, located In San Jose and seven mora
children were bcrn Into the humble home.
Bosquet, through one of the many revolu
tions which ho had Hc-ured lost "his por
tion of the family fortune. He had been
married several times before, but whether
the decrees or circumstances win permit
the marriage he now contemplates Is a
question for the jurists. Mrs. Sanchez
also suffered In the same way.
But now. in the evening of his life. Bos
quet has asked that the woman who for
nearly a quarter of a rentury has been hla
constant companion, shall be legally mads
his wife. She has procured a marriage li
cense and if legal obstacles do not Inter
vene, the marriage that will establish her
position will be solemnized.
On a cot In the humble home, at 17 Gen
eva street. Bosquet is gasping for breath
His frame Is wrecked with wrackir"
pains of asthma. Hla children cluster
round his bedside, and seek the recogni
tion the mother demands for them. A
priest has been called in and Is now
studying the peculiarities of the matri
monial adventures of the father and,
mother In the hope of finding It possible to
unite them that no taint may be Imposed
upon the offspring.

from several plays to prove that Shakes

that he ridiculed the pedantic student and

morbid stoicism and believed that the best
mental work could be done only when
conducted with pleasure and interest.

A bill which will throw out of court
many N heavy ! damage suits, pending
against the Southern Pacific Company, is
now before the Senate at Sacramento
and Is likely to become a law.
Assemblyman Savage on February 25
introduced the bill, which seeks to amend
section 490 of the Civil Code, relating to
railroads and fares.
On the face of it, Assemblyman Say
age's bill does not seem to be of vital
Importance, but should It become a law
it will effectually dispose of more th:in
$1 000.000 worth of damage suits, upon
which the Supreme Court is expected to
soon render a decision.
The present law provides that a rail
road company must furnish a ticket be
tween designated points when the fare
is tendered and must supply the accom
â¢modation called for on the ticket. The
company must give the holder of the
ticket the trip called for at any time
within six months and falling to do so.
is liable in damages to the holder of the
ticket in the sum of $200
For many years Dr. W. H. Robinson
of Alameda has been fighting the com
pany under this law and has a number
of suits against it. the damages sued for
aggregating more than $1,000,000.
The joker in the bill introduced by As
semblyman Savage is that it seeks to
amend the present section of the Civil
Code by providing that the railroad com
pany which refuses to carry a passenger
on a ticket within six months of its pur
chase shall pay to the purchaser so re
fusd all "actual damages caused thereby,
with reasonable counsel fees expended in
recovering same." ...
The bill was rushed through the Assem
bly last week and sent to the Senate,
where it was read for the first time. Yes
terday It was given -a second reading.
Senator Taylor sought to amend the bill
so that it would not apply to suits- now
pending in the courts, but the amendment
was snowed under. â¢ ' â¢ -'
If the bill becomes a law, there will be
no penalty provided for the refusal, of a
railroad to carry a passenger on a pur
chased/ticket. ... '""; â
The company can designate Its own
time as to when the passenger must trav
el, even though it advertises trains to
travel according, to schedule. The pas
senger must prove that he has actually
sustained damages by failure of the rail
road company to carry him to his destlna-
U Dr Robinson went to Sacramento yes
terday and will use every means Possible
to prevent the final passage of the billfi
by the Senate. If it is given a third read
ing Dr. Robinson will appeal, to the Gov
ernor to refuse -to sign the measure.

an alarm bell frightli'g the midnight air
followed by shots and then solid silence
again. That was all. but to any self

thing smelt of mystery. Some told of

COURTEOUS OFFICIAL PROMOTED â
Frank T. Thompson, stenographer In the of
fice of the United States District Attorney,
has been appointed clerk in the department of
steam engineering in the naval station at Ca
vite under the civil service system at a sal
ary of JUOO per annum. Mr. Thompson will
call on the Meade on the lath of this month.
He is one of the most popular officials in the
Appraisers' building.
the corner of Sutter. and Taylor streets
a few nights ago was sleep.
Percy Williams and his friend Rlg'g re
side In the bachelors' apartment house
on that corner. "Williams' room is on the
third floor and Hlgg occupies the apart
ment directly beneath. This fact and an
alarm clock furnish the rudiments of a
practical joke which Williams esteemed
a good one to put up on Rigg. As the
last car eluded the unwary homeseeker
Williams thoughtfully lowered an alarm
clock of powerful lung capacity, attached
to a piece of string until its face looked
into Rigg"s window.
The alarm had been set. "Williams
waited. The climax came quickly. The
alarm rang out loud and clear. At the
same moment a fusillade of bullets from
a revolver wielded by Rlgg blew the rest
of the clamor and all the works to the
winds. It rained cost and springs for a
few seconds In the neighborhood. Tht-n
all was quiet.
Williams got up laj.e the next morning
and blamed his alarm clock. Rlgg said
nothing. He is a man of action. But ho
told a friend In strict confidence and now
the .people "in the neighborhood of that
boarding-house are boring their friends
with the story, and the daylight of knowl
edge has reunited doubtful neighbors.
Officer N. P. Cocney sent In the alarm
and a .moment- afterward Pryal says he
saw two men running from another direc
tion and both apprised him of the fire.
How these men knew that a conflagration
was In progress the watchman says is a
mystery to him.
He says he went upstairs to Investigate
but could find nothing. Later he detect
ed the odor of smoke and rushed from
the building foÂ»- the purpose of turning in
an alarm. He observed,- In passing out.
that the door was open, when it should
have been closed and locked.
James A. Pryal. the watchman in the
laundry, claims that he heard what he
believed to be footsteps in the furniture
establishment about twenty minutes be
fore the fire was discovered.
"William Bateman is the heaviest loser.
His furniture factory was entirely de
stroyed, entailing a loss of $40,000. He
was partially insured.
The loss on the buildinjr is In the neigh
borhood of $30,000. X. W. Bender, who
with G. Baclgalupi and James E. Gordon,
own the stock of the Electric Laundry,
estimates their loss at $10,000, fully cov
ered by insurance.
In 1897 the building was occupied by the
Standard Biscuit Company. On June 6 of
that year it was discovered to be on fire
and in a short time the west wall caved
In. bringing death to three firemen. Engi
neer Maholy of chemical 6 had been in
jured by a piece of falling debris. Driver
Hallinan of truck 1 and Extraman Keller,
also oLchemical 6. stood by their wounded
comrade until help could arrive.
While the. two firemen were standing
over their prostrate comrade a deafening
roar was heard, and tons of brick and tim
ber crashed to the ground, burying the
trio and killing them Instantly.
The building, which was a three-story
structure, was partially destroyed, and
when It was rebuilt it was reduced to two
stories, each of which was almost imme
diately occupied. The Electric Laundry
plant was located on the first floor and.
Bateman rented the second.
The large brick structure at 835 Folsom
street in which three brave firemen met a
horrible death beneath falling walla and
burning debris In 1897 was again the seene
of a disastrous fire early this morning. No
fatal mishaps occurred, but the Electric
Laundry and William Bateman, a manu
facturer of office and bank furniture, will
lose heavily. The origin of the fire Is a
mystery. A statement made by the watch
man of the laundry company leads to the
belief that it was the work of an Incen
diary, and the autj^ritles are making an
investigation. â¢Â¦
When the fire department responded to
the first alarm the flames were breaking
from the windows in the second story in
the rear of Bateman's establishment. A
second alarm was sounded, but the fire
gained rapid headway and the entire roof
was soon ablaze. The prompt work of
the firemen kept the fire confined to the
second floor, and the laundry property on
the first floor wasnot damaged except by
water. The inflammable character of the
stock in the furniture factory caused the
entire floor to become a mass of seething
flames for a few minutes until the tor
rents of water from tin lines of hose
quenched them. It required two hours of
hard work, however, before the last spark
had been extinguished and the fire was
tapped out.

"Yrs. sir." responded Hodgson, "and I
told EIMncsen mat 1 iiad always stood by
and upheld mv men when charges were
made ajrainst them, but that I couldn't do
so any more â that this was the last time."
"Didn't I sav," asked Major Blakeney.
"that I always supported my men until I
found that they were wrong, and now
that I would tell eve the charges to be
true unlr-ss thev proved their innocence?"
"Yes. sir."
"Didn't I tell von that T thought I could
not restrain my.=^lf If Ellingsen made tbi"t
confession in my presence?" inquired the
Mai or.
"Yes. Fir."
"Didn't I sak you not to let me kill him
or do him great violence, or something
similar to that?" proceeded the Major,
with a bloodtnirs-ty glance at the meek
Norweginn. at the other end of the room.
"Yes. sir."
A recess was taken until 1 p. m.. to al
low the Major to cool off. and at that
hour Mark Ellingsen took the stand and
again swore that he heard no signals of
distress whatever, and that he heard only
fog whistles. He denied that he had made
a confession to Captain Hodgson or any
statement whatever at variance with that
read by Major Blakeney at the morning
Fession.
The Investigation was then declared ad
journed sine die.
The Major Asked to Be Held.
Captain Joseph Hodgson was recalled
and asked to give the distress signals as
laid down in a circular issued by the
supervising inspector of steam vessels in
1SS4. The witness replied that rule 5 pro
vided as a signal the continuous sounding
of a steam whistle or any other fog signal
apparatus.
According to the testimony of the offi
cers, crew and passengers of the Rio de
Janeiro this was the signal given by the
Rio. the valves of the steam whistles hav
ing been tied down In order that the
whistling might be continuous.
Major Blakeney then asked the witness
concerning the confession of Mark Elling
ton that he had heard the distress slg
r.als of the Rio and had not reported
them. Hodpson replied that Ellingsen had
confused that he heard the long distress
â¢whistle, but that Ellinpsen did not want
to call Captain Hodgson because he did
not attach any importance to the signal.
Ellingsen said to the witness: "I feel
sorry, now that I realize what it is."
Ellingsen seemed to feel very mean.
Hodgson continued; he was worried and
nervous, and went about the grounds feel
ing downcast. The witness, at the time,
did rot think that EUingsen would ever
"show up" :.cn:r..
Major Blakeney thÂ«=n read the charges
against Ellingsfn as follows:
Gross and willful neglect of patrol duty: In
this, that Mark Ellimcsen. bring on watch at
th* lookout r^pularly detailed from 4 to 8

JOSEPH HODGSON.
Ellingsen in Blakeney's Office.
The witress then told in detail of the |
viFit of Ellingsen to Major Blakeney's of
fice, when Ellingsen made the following
statement:
1 Â»as on watch at the lookout on February
Z2 from 4 to 6 a. m. During my four hours'
Â¦natch I he&rd a Â£reat many eteam whistles
rafslr.r the lookout, both In and out. One
r**"U'.lar whittle I heard was at 5:30 a. nv.
w-h<>n I heard a whistle of about ten seconds'
duration â no longer. I didn't think it any
th!rÂ»r out of the ordinary, as -we often hear
f-ueh whittles from the lookout. I didn't rec
ognize It as a distress fisrnal or as requiring
to be rpprrtM to the kr-erer. a* If I did so
*HrJ< I would have surrly reported it to the
keeper over the telephone.
In reply to n ouestion bv Major Blake
riey. Captain Hodcscn said that Ellingsen
was a native of Norway.
'Tan he always exprers himself in the ;
English lanfrunpe so as not to be mis
understood?" asked the Major.
"Tes. sir."
'Tpon any subject?"
"Yes. sir."
"Can hÂ«Â» put the English language to-
Ccther anything like grammatically?"
"Yes. sir."
"Didn't I fav" asked Major Blakeney.
"that I hoped that Ellingsen had killed
himself, as It would save me much i
trouble if he had?"
Hodgson Tells of the Confession.
This question. In which Major Blakeney.
puperintendent of the coast life-saving
fervlce. showed the fierceness that really
lies concealed In his seemingly harmless
nature, was asked by him yesterday of
Captain Hodgson at the Major's so-called
Investigation into the neglect of the life
saving station employes to hear the Rlo's
distress s!g-naJ3. The proceedings Â«nded
vesterday.
Captain Hodgson testified as to the con
fession made hy Mark Ellingsen. the look
out rcan at the .'ort Point station, and
Ellingren f\rore that he had never made
any confession. Major Blakeney. in the
questions quoted In L-ie foregoing para
graph, put his indignation Into the record,
but mercifully spared the life of the stal
wnrt Norwegian sailor. The latter, by the
Â¦way. went back upon his statement, per
haps fearinR to meet his Maker above.
Captain George Varney of Golden Gate
Park station was Questioned in regard to
distress signals, and replied that among
other things the international code of 18S9
prescribed the continuous blowing of
steam whistles as a signal of distress.
"Didn't I tell you that I thought I could
nnt restrain myself if Ellinesen made that
confession .n my presence? Didn't I ask
you not to let me s\\\ him or do him great
violence, or something similar to that?"
"Tps, sir."
