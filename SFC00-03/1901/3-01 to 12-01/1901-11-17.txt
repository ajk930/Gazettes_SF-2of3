Nothing Is go gratifying to a hostess as a

At a dinner it is better to partake, of a
little of everything that is passed, or at
least take some upon one's plate. A young

her guests decline certain dishes, thinks
that she has made an unfortunate selec

.'; It. Is a mistake to think such remarks in
bad taste, and that they make us appear,
as though unused ourselves to handsome
surroundings. . On the contrary, It is pre
cisely those who are sensitive to beauty
through its accustomednesa that are most
forward In expressing pleasure, or per
haps they know from experience that dis
criminating pcaise never x gives offense,
but- is treasured by the hostess and re
called with pleasure. Those who second
the efforts of their hostess Instead of
making demands upon her, who help to
entertain her other , guests, are those
whose presence comes to be considered
one of the essentials of a successful so
cial event.
If It be necessary to withdraw early,
before, the rest of the guests, it should
be done as quietly as possible, and the
farewell to one's hosts be as unstereo
typed and as expressive of pleasure as
may be made consistent with truthâ some
think that even truth may be stretched
over a compliment.
. The Guest at a House Party.
In replying to an invitation to spend a
few days or more at a friend's house, It
i:-, a not uncommon error, if obliged to
decline, to say that at "some other time",
one would be pleased to accept. Such
suggestion Is supposed to convey the Idea
that one cannot resign one's self to the
disappointment. ; It often places a hostess
In a most embarrassing position. It would
be considered a rudeness to reply thus to

THE DUTIES OF A GUEST.
an invitation for dinner or luncheon, and
yet it would be far simpler to repeat such
occasions of ; - entertaining a friend than
to .plan twice. for his reception at one's
house for a visit of several days. A
prompt reply Is especially important in
such Invitations, since the plans of the
hostess are contingent upon the answer,
and possibly those of some of her friends
as well. 1 A telegram stating the. exact
time of one's expected arrival is often a
satisfaction', to a hostess, even if it has
been previously agreed upon. It Is an as
surance that : nothing \ has occurred to al
ter the original plan. 'â¢'Â¦'.. -
It : Is, ;of course, safferfluous to sug
gest that- a guest Is bound by every law
of -courtesy to | conform in everything to
the habits of > the household as \ far as
possible. The most agreeable visitors are
these who make no trouble for any one,
who find ,-; everything pleasant that their
hostess arranges for them, who in little
unsolicited ways are ready to make them
\ selves ; useful. The gifts and accomplish
ments of all should be at the call of their
hosts.' Every one should be able to make
some contribution to the general enter
tainment, and with' cheerful alacrity, but
with no shade of ostentation, be ready
to \ comply with the \ slightest , Intimation
of host and hostess of their desire for as
sistance, â¢ Â¦Â¦-â¢' -, "Â¦[ .- .'Â¦'. K . .â¢:â¢ ' '.Â¦"'â¢ ;
.A" guest should never appear thought
less of or indifferent to the convenience
of the rest. Some persons ; think â¢ that be
cause they are visitors they need be only
the recipients of attention. They should
fall in readily with any plan proposed for
their pleasure, but must not seem depend-
t ent for amusement- -. L . .
A . woman may ; take some bit ;of : work
with her. or a book that she has already
begun, that she may not appear to be
waiting helplessly to be provided with
entertainment. : She may take . a napâ or
pretend to do soâ propose to withdraw
to her room under pretext of letters to
write; : and a man may , tramp, ]Â¦ read: or
practice -at -some sport. llf it be suspected
that the.' hosts have something to occupy
them, or even to relieve them of their con
tinuous society. \ â¢â¢
- , Punctuality at all times should be felt
to be an 'â¢ obligation. When outside guests
are invited, the house party should be in
the drawing-room promptly to." receive
them or to be presented, being, in a sense,
part of their host's family during their
stay. . .'. ' '.- Â¦ /-.;" '.. '
: If family 'worship is a custom and the
hour Is mentioned to Â¦ guests, their pres
ence Is obligatory; but if not Invited, it
would be an intrusion. . Â¦
Â» If anything unpleasant occur, a guest
should see nothing, but maintain a dis
creet absent-mindedness; and .the whole
decalogue of good behavior is broken at
once If one visitor criticises to another
either a fellow guest or a member of the
host's family, or discusses any of their
I affairs or interests unless it be to praise.
The Quest's Boom. Â¦
The rooms allotted to visitors are gen
erally dainty, and often contain choice
articles that require careful use. Often
cherished belongings are taken from ac
customed places to minister to a guest's
comfort or pleasure, who will, of course,
keep the room in an orderly manner and
handle Its pretty accessories with due
regard to their delicacy. The presence of
visitors adds appreciably to the servants'
regular duties; so it is only just to lighten
them as far as may be, and ask no special
service if it can be avoided.
It is a matter of bedroom etiquette to
leave the room always In perfect order.
In the morning the windows should be
opened, the bed clothes turned back to be
aired, and, the towels hung In place.
A thoughtful hostess will offer a maid's
services to unpack the boxes of her
guests. The servants should be pleas
antly' thanked for any service, and upon
leaving, visitors should conform to custom
In giving a gratuity to such as have ad
ministered to them personally.
Weil-Bred Guests.
Well-bred guests keep their, belongings
carefully confined to the portion of the
house that is temporarily assigned to
them, availing themselves only of the
closets and drawers that have been placed
at their disposal.
They do not take books and magazines
to their rooms without the express per
mission of the hostess. These are for the
benefit of all the visitors. They never
ride a borrowed horse too far or 100 fast.
They endeavor to show themselves at
their best when others are invited to
meet them, taking pains to second all the
efforts of their hostess.
1 When private .theatricals or musicals
are given.. the hostess, or others who su
perintend the affair, , ,will always be
grateful to those who, putting aside
personal preference, enter heartily Into
the parts assigned them, more anxious to
give pleasure than to display their accom
plishments. An old proverb says, "Never
mention a rope in the family of a man
that was hanged." The application is ob
vious. - : Â¦; : Â¦â¢; :*;
It were well to remember, too, that one's
ailments are never matter of public in
terest, and self and its belongings should
never form a prominent part in one's
conversation. It is optional with a guest
whether or not he will attend church with
his hosts. No worldly etiquette imposes
his presence, but it is usually felt to be
more 'considerate for guests to attend
church If provision Is made to take them
there. " â¢Â¦ ' 'Ââ¢ .;/,â¢. ' :~: ~ .
If visitors have accepted outside invita
tions before their arrivalâ which is "often
the case when making visits in townâ they
should mention the fact to their hostess
as soon as convenient, that none of that
lady's plans be unsettled and that Â¦ their
going may be arranged for. â¢
Guests should not allow their hosts to
incur, needless expense In their behalf.
They should in a city pay their own car
fares, cab hires and .express charges; but
if the host will not permit this, it Is in
better taste to yield' the point than to in
sist upon it. /
.Although the desk of a guest room is
usually provided with note paper with the
family crest' or the name of the house
upon it, and all necessaries for letter
writing, ; guests will be discriminating in
their use of them, and come provided, with
their own, including stamps. â¢
'It is an old-fashioned bit of courteous
attention, but one usually appreciated, for
a visitor to bring to the hostess a box of
bonbons or some fruit, rare enough to
be an excuse for its offeringâ which is
presented soon after the arrival.
â¢ An Ideal Guest.
â¢I have in mind one bright little woman
for the pleasure of whose visits all her
friends contend. She comes like a burst
of sunshine, and every member of the
family hails her with enthusiasm. She
pays a preliminary visit to the confec
tioner's, remembering that there are chil
dren in the household. She always hap
pens to have with her the last new book
of which the world is talking, and her
fund of games, riddles and anecdotes is
inexhaustible. She never fails to have
some bit of fancy work on. hand, upon
which she stitches industriously and with
intense and absorbing interest whenever
there happens to be a dearth of other. oc
cupation, or suddenly remembers an
amusing story that she has brought to
read to us. Best of all, she is ready for
anything and enjoys everything, nothing
comes amiss. She is an appreciative audi
ence to the children's small efforts on
the piano or at recitation. She tells them
stories, plays games with them. She is
Interested In the little girl's doll, for
which she will make "a love of a bonnet,"
and In the boy's . collection ." of
stamps or butterflies, , over which
she wonders to his heart's, content, and
never by chance refers to his geological
"specimens" as "stones." Every servant
is her devoted slave. She remembers
them all by name, has a bright word for
each, and byway of thanking one -m.-i
to confer an obligation.
There is a universal protest when the
time comes for her departure, but shj
has always made an engagement else*
where, which we suspect is intentionally
prearranged lest she be over-persuaded
to "wear her welcome out."
This last idea is to be commended. A
provisory sort of engagement, made so
as. to be a little elastic, enables one to
prolong one's visit, if it be really desired
by all parties, or. will serve as a reason
for not accepting, if we wish to go, or
our invitation seem merely prompted by
politeness.
A bit of - sentiment in the form of a
"guest-book." la sometimes the fad of a
hostess. One ohould welcome any oppor
tunity to give her pleasure.

j. AIBUM .Â¦Â¦"Â¦Â¦? Tic-r specialty.
There are Borne people who have a
genius for philanthropy. it does not lie
i\ the purse that holds enough to spill
over; it does not Ho always in the desire
to be generous. The gift of philanthropy
is born, not made, just, as much as the
gift of poetry, or of song, or of painting.
You remember the little story by
Richard Harding Davis, the heroine of
' which tried the profession of philanthropy
tat a while and in the end gave it up, a
failure? She had money, which she gave
freely. More than that, she gave her
time and labor, personally visiting the
poor and sick. But it didn't work. â¢ The
poor didn't enjoy her visits. She meant
well, but she hadn't the right sort of tact
to reach all classes. "You can do more
good among people of your own kind,"
the man told her when he bore her off to
them.
She hadn't the gift of philanluropy. It
wasn't born in her. It- wasn't one of her
talents.

talent, that enables . her to reach those
who suffer.
Luckily for her and for those whom she
has helped, she has time to give. This is
tha most precious thing In the world and
seldom, belongs to the rich. Mrs. Har
rington's home cares are comparatively
light, for she has no children. So beyond
keeping her charming little house in
smooth running order and making it a
delightful place for a husband to come
home to, she finds her pleasant cares out
side.
She would never be doing this If. she
had greater demands upon her time at

an ideal home maker, Her house on Stei

signs are to be seen with the most be
witching little shades. . '
Her work In the Red Cross was so de
voted "that she came before the public in
spite of herself, for she is the last woman
in the world to seek notoriety. Finally,
when the pressure of that was over, she
took her place as president of Sorosls,
which office stood as a sort of crowning
of her works.
Sorosis is a fashionable club whosÂ«
alms are literary and social. Mrs. Har
rington is the woman to guide both thosa
aims.
She enjoys her club life, although her
heart has by no means* left charitable
work. She considers club life the true
means of broadening woman, giving her a
higher culture and wider sympathies.
"Contact with.; others of the right sort
is education," she Bays. "Contact with
women of refinement is refining. In ltfÂ»

The natural, social system of contact is*
the -one that must bring, about the best
results, and in the woman's, club of tli<* '
present day this Is to be found.
. "Another value of the club life is that
it does away with unnecessary conserva
tism. Not with womanlinessâ never that;
but there is a certain shrinking In many
women which is better overcome, and tha
meeting with others; the speaking before
a- number, overcomes this. a woman
grows, m this way to have the courage
of her convictions."
Mrs. Harrington is small and dainty,
a little white-haired lady of the'" old

goes, although Bhe is distinctly modern
in breadth of thought. a friend says that
she never thinks of her without think

Home Dressmaking, v \Â»^
In home dressmaking the trouble comes
with the flare. There are two "ways of
making the new eklrt. or rather two kinds
of new f.'.urts from which to choose. One
is a skirt that flares gradually to the
street, all the. way down, taking on a de
clded flare at the knees, so as to chow a
very wide foot flare. This is called tho
Funnel akin, for lt'broaderis gradually.
The other skirt is perfectly straight up
and down the front and very tight, having
the appearance of a tie back. Indeed,
there are strings attached underneath to
tie. It back, so it is actually a tie-back
skirt. The front and sides hang perfect
ly straight, but at the back there is a
double box plait, inverted, which Is made
so that H does not flare until the foot of
the skirt is reached when it takes a series
of pretty folds, ending in a little train.
The home dressmaker can experiment
with both of these skirts and see how bho
comes out. She will not succeed If sha
attempts to curtail the length, for tho
skirt must be very, very long, and this
must be the case not only in the back but
in the front, which Is really of such a
length that you wonder how you will walk
in It.
The skirt lift is an Important thing to
learn, for it is so necessary a part of
one's appearance in the street. The skirt,
if properly raised in the middle of the
back, will lift the front also so that it will
Â¦well escape the ground. Tills back lift is
the proper thing for the funnel or gradu
ally sloping skirt
The straight skirt with little train and
box plaited back requires the side lift-
The traJn is lifted in one hand and pulled
around toward the side so as to twist It
around the figure, thus lifting it. Practice
and a pier glass make perfect In lifting
the train.

The Ogden Mills twins are wearing very
pretty cloth suits for first winter wear.
One gown, yin blue, Is trimmed with
white, the skirt and waist showing the
same treatment, which is that of scal
loped bands edged with white satin. A
very wide curved band of cloth trimmed
the skirt of the dark blua.gown about a
foot above the hem. It was cut in big
scallops, the top finished rather sharply.
A piping of white satin appeared at the
top and the bottom of the bands. .
The' waist had bands curving around
It, each band edged with while satin. The
collar was a turnover, bordered with the
, same little band.
Black makes up charmingly Into winter
suits and shows off so well the trimming

design, while the waist had its sailor col"

The Russian cuff, with its tight-fitting

house gowns as well. This sort of cuff
allows for a little bag at the back of the
wrist, but is close fitting to the hand and
very neat. It is made of Persian .em

A cornstalk gown* was one of the Hand
somest dresses seen at an afternoon tea.

AUGUSTA
PRESCOTT
Dana Gibson. The skirt was a very pale
grcc-n and trimming It around tho foot
were husks of corn, looking as though
just pulled off the ear. Even the corn
silk waa visible In pale yellow and light
green falling from under the l.usks.
Around the foot of the gown there was
a hand of green velvet In a little deeper
shade.
Embroidered Gowns.
Â¦Embroidery appears to an alarming ex
tent upon the fall gowns, when one con
siders the work that must be performed
and the stitches taken to secure it.
downs in whita doth are abundantly em
broidered in colors, for dressy gowns
such as are to be worn to hottse wed
dings and receptions. In the tans and
pale colors of all kinds there is seen tha
same beautiful embroidery.
But it is upon black gowns that em
broidery appears to the best advantage.
.Great empire wreaths in all colors, show-
Ing leaves and flowers and a ribbon inter
twined, are seen upo.n black skirts and in
the center of the wreath is a smaller one
carried out in the same way. These
wreaths are embroidered around the foot
of a gown and half way up the skirt, then
comes a pointed design in embroidery to
finish the trimming.
It takes time to embroider a gown like
this, and the couturieres of Paris have
half a dozen girls all at work upon a sin
gle skirt, if it is to be completed within
a certain time. The skirt is first made up,
and is then arranged over a chair, so
that it falls all around ft. The girls seat
themselves In a circle, and. taking- the
skirt upon their knees, proceed to embroi
der the design upon It. In this manner a
much better romilt is obtained than if the
material were embroidered and the skirt
put together afterward.
The embroidered bolero, far from being
a thing of the past, is seen with these
skirts. It has the short sleeve, with an
embroidered ruffle, the sleeves cut off' at
the elbow. The bolero is embroidered
around the edge, and is worn over a little
silk shirt -waist or a delicate waist of
chiffon and lace.
A wide band of silk, folded closely and
finished with a rosette, Is worn as a belt,
and. to the back of this belt there are
fastened wide tabs, looking much like em
broidered postilions, ns. Indeed, they are.
In the accepted use of the term.
Tor Day Receptions.
A light cloth gown was trimmed with
embroidery put on in sharp pointed de
sign. Great embroidered points zigzagged
around the skirt. There were four rows of
this kind of embroidery, one above the
other, coming nearly to the belt. Little
bunches of lloweis in embroidery appeared
around the hips.
The French knot design Is another kind
of trimming that is seen. Tiny French
knots trim the collar and the yoke and
are used in such a way as to make panels
down each side of the vest. The cuffs
are trimmed with them. The foot of the
skirt has an embroidery in French knot.?.
With these gowns the most elaborate
hats Are worn. One hat, a great spread
ing thing, -was turned up at the side and
held in place with two straps of black
velvet. .Knots of black velvet rested upon
the hair. The hat was bound with black
velvet and the top was trimmed with
feathers. This sharp contrast of blaclc
and white is often good in a picture hat,
Â«md can be utilised with any gown, for it
goes well with everything.6

Eating too fast and drinking too much

Win n we eat too fast the. food is not

Most of us are inclined to eat more
than nature requires. We would be in

Deep breathing in the open air la one
of the very best exercises for tilling out
hollows and developing the bust. Inhale
a long deep breath slowly through the
nose and exhale slowly through the
mouth. Do this in the open for at least
ten minutes. At first you will feel weak,
but that will be a good sign. You will
soon be able to take deep breaths for
twenty minutes, and you will breathe
more deeply at all times; the correct way
of breathing will begin to come natu

A very good exercise for the neck is
this:' i .. -i the head fall slowly backward

the left foot, left shoulder ami left ear.
This exercise retches the muscles. in the
neck and shoulders. ' - : . *Â¦ . ;
Raise shoulders straight up as high a3

Here Is an excellent recipe for develop

One ounce pure lanollne. i
Seven droj essence of peppermint.
.Twenty drops almond oil.
Mix well and apply to the bust with tips
of fingers. Massage lightly and always
with circular movement for ten minutes.
Wipe off as much of the. cream as possi

muscle, and the hollows . Will disappear.
Only, give them time.IS MODERN SOCIETY DETERIORATING?
JP It be true that many of tho virtues
are modern, It Is certain that all the
vices ore ancient. " Such was the
qualified and doubtful praise accord
ed to the society of his own time by
the author of "Tho Last Days of Pom
peii" as a comment on the OOgged dice
found in that- unfortunate city when it
was excavated. It would be a strange, if
not a pleasant experience, If some groat
cataclysm of the kind should overtake
and, so to speak, stereotype our mysteri
ous, ugly, but horribly fascinating me
tropolis, which has devoured In the course
of Its varied menu lives of great men de
voted to world questions; of silly women
given up to dress, flirtation and tight
lacing; of financiers secretly pulling a
complicated system of wires; of the
dupes of these gentlemen; of men and
Â¦women (but chiefly the latter) who havo
thought the world well lost for love; of
the disappointed, who run second for all
the prizes of life; of desperate, maddened
gamblers; of jealous and" revengeful lov
ers; of the general public, male and fe
male each unit with its own particular
s.x to grind; of thousands of silent, toil
ing, uncomplaining horses, living, working
and dying at last under the lash.
The lash, we may truly say, has not
been reserved for horses alone, and,
though certain human brutes have been
considered too tender to endure it, it has
been administered freely enough to our
own speciesâ morally, at leastâ and it Is
not the less cruel when self-inflicted.
Man Is Much the Same.
Any comparison between the society of
to-day and that of former times must be
exceedingly difficult, because, though hu
man nature remains exactly the same and
runs like a golden thread up the ages
until It is lost in mythology, it is now so
differently conditioned and its character
istics so modified by circumstances that
its whole form and appearance have com
pletely altered. But if we unwind the
different wrappings which shroud the real
man from our view he will be found un
changed.
The vices and even the virtues of the
parents, however, have sometimes a curi
ously deterrent effect on the children, who
unconsciously lean to the opposite side,
impelled by nature rather than their own
will to trim the boats of habit and cus
tom.
Young Girl Gamblers.
Take two of the cryjng sins which have
degraded society ever since social inter
course became a power in the worldâgam
bling and drink. Our grandfathers and
great-grandfathers indulged In the former
to an extent which made the temptation
to client an almost overpowering one, but
In the days of our fathers and mothers
things were not so bad as they have now
again become. Certainly young; girls who
may now be seen of an afternoon or even
ing at the bridge table losing far more
than they can afford do not figure as
gamblers In the memoirs of former days.
As most girls have spent their quarter's
allowance long before it is due, and as
they have not, so far as I know, the young
man's resources of borrowing cash from
his tailor, it is difficult to see how they
can meet what losses they are certain to
sustain.
The modern girl, too, is in a difficult po
sition. She is expected to dress far more
handsomely than her predecessors early
in the century, for whom a ribbon sash
and a white muslin- dress well damped to
make it cling represented the height of
luxury. The rush and hurry of modern
life, traveling expenses, tips to servants,
dresses for London, others for the coun
try, golfing, bicycling and tennis cos
tumes, riding habits, to say nothing of
shooting, lishlng and "motoring" garÂ«
mentsâ all these things run into far more
money than the ordinary girl can squeeze
or coax out of dear papa.
I honestly believe that with all their ex
tra amusements, freedom of action and
speech and superior education, they are
not nearly so happy as their simpler and
more easily pleased forbears, who looked
reposee. blooming and domestic and had,
if we may trust to the accounts which
have come down to us, all the men at
their feet.

Tipping the Servants.
The feeing of servants upon one's de
parture from a friend's house seems to
gome to be in questionable taste, but it
has become an almost universal custom,
and principles must sometimes make con
cessions to popularity where no question
of right and wrong is involved.
In England the omission 'of the custom
would be regarded as an evidence of par
simony or of ignorance, and it must bo

COUNTESS FMALMESBURY
Now, It seems to mo that the reverse is
the case. There Is nothing more dis
tressing than to Bee a pretty girl at a
party trying to Interest a languid, bored
young man, who feebly responds to her
advances with the same air, if slightly
veiled, of having "a stick to keep the
girls away" which prevails in less ele
vated circles.
Then, again, the hurry and scurry are
so terrible. Society is enormous and fed
to repletion. The area in which calls
have to be paid is appalling, and the fa
tigue of this particular duty such that I
feel sure our successors will dispense with
it altogether or adopt some more conven
ient form of conveying the fact that they
are in town or wish to be on visiting terms
with some one.
Professor Dolbear, in his summary of
the world's progress in science, has said:
The nineteenth century received from its
predecessors the horse; we bequeath the
locomotive, the bicycle and the automo
bile. We received the sailing ship; we be
queath the steamship. We received the
beacon signal fire; we bequeath the tele
phone and wireless telegraphy. All these
discoveries have had a deep and lasting
Influence on society, but whether for good
or ill, who shall say?
Saturday-Monday Jaunts.
In any case, if the aim and object of
society is to enable persons of wealth
anil leisure to spend their lives agreeably
together, guarded by certain unwritten
laws and self-imposed restrictions, 1
doubt whether that result has been at
tained as matters stand.
Formerly the great dining days for the
London world were Wednesdays and Sat
urdays, these days being free from House
of Commons duties, but now the former
only remains to the giver or eater of .
dinners. Saturday is devoted to a hop,
skip and a jump visit into the country till
the following Monday. These Hying visits
are no rest to the overtaxed worldling
or to the tired official or litterateur, and
the amount of fresh air each is able to
imbibe must be considerably counterbal
anced in its tonic properties by the ener
vating effects of overgood cheer, the reac
tion which follows- the airy stimulus of
champagne and the deteriorating effects
on what uur doctors are pleased to call the
"nerves" by a rapid railway journey
down to the country and up again to
town within a limited number of hours.
Add to this that we are nearly all of us
trying to drive four horses while we
stand precariously balanced on the backs
of the other two, and that, what with so
cial "pleasures," "duties" to match, phil
anthropy, education, literary, artistic or
athletic avocations, to which we may add
various forms of serious gambling either
on the Stock Exchange Cr in the drawing
room, we can scarcely pause to enjoy
what we have most desired, labored to
acquire and at length obtained. Such, for
instance, I may say, In the unfortunate
case of certain persons with old-fash
ioned views of the family tie. is the re
sult of the stress of modern life that we
hardly ever see those most dear to usâ
our husbands or our children; they are
all swallowed up, the former in meeting
the terrific competition which confronts
them in every career, our sons in passing;
competitive examinations until they are
well on into the thirties, our daughters in
tearing from one house to another, from
one dinner dance to the next, or in tak
ing up what they fondly believe to be
some serious study, which occupies their
time if not their minds, and deceives the
empty heart with artificial food just as
starvinp men devour the most innutrl
tious substances.
"Bachelor" Girls Not Happy.
This special development of our social
edifice rests on the gradually acquired
"bachelor" habits of our girls, partly ow
ing to the greater safety and rapidity
with whic.x they can move about the
world: their wider knowledge of life so
acquired, which fits them in a measure to
protect themselves, and lastly, on their
more extensive education.
Are they happier? I shrewdly suspect
not. The charmed veil of mystery which
made of their mothers and .grandmothers
longed for prizes, whose society could
scarcely be enjoyed in fullness, has
dropped from our lovely, athletic, accom
plished, but prosaic young women, whom

ology have robbed of something of the
tender freshness which dilated the eye and
flushed the check of their ancestresses.
And yet in SOtne tespectS the position
of women has greatly improved. They
found early In the century habitual
drunkenness; they will leave sobriety.
They found the coarsest of language and
a flow of Oaths on the slightest provoca
tion; and they leave, outside a certain
very limited set which seems to rejoice in
the unclean and the ambiguous, careful it
slangy speech, in which such a thing as a
big, big I) is as rare as plums in :i work
house pudding. The modern hygienic
comforts and facilities of our houses must,
also have their effect; and it is strange
to picture a condition of affairs whtah
compelled the architects of our old castles
to build the bedrooms all opening one out
of another, the innermost one, which had
no other exit, being Inhabited by the
women of the family for their protection.
Dinners Too Elaborate.
Our dinners are too long, too hnt, too
gorgeous, too large and therefore usually
too deadly dull to be enjoyable; but even
if they were perfect in every detail they
could not continue to amuse a person who
dines out every night of his life. Still,
with all their faults, they must nc less
intolerable than those Interminable feasts
of roast beef, cygnet or pea chick at
which our grandfather sat, flanked by
bottles of port and brown sherry, from 3
in the afternoon till they were carried to
bed or perhaps tottered unsteadily into
the presence of the ladies. They drank,
no doubt, to still the gnawing worm of
boredom, which even then must have had
some power; but now we bear our disil
lusions and satiety in soberness, if with
depression and languor.
It is saidâ with what truth T know notâ
that the abstinence of our ladies of to-day
from the flowing bowl is not so conspicu
ous as that of the men. I trust this is a
libel. But worse than this is the secret
habit of taking drugsâ more fatal, if pos
sible, than alcohol, and less easy to de
tect and control.
Another conspicuous change in society is
the worship of wealth and the altered
views of the most ancient and aristocratic
families on the subject of trade. Dukes,
marquises, earls and their female rela
tions keep sh.ops. issue advertisements of
the ir wares, and, in the case of the former,
display their names on p. city prospectus
or the bill of a theater without feeling at
all uncomfortable, unless, indeed, their
venture is not a financial success. The
whole tone of the social mind has altered
In this respect, and if some antiquated
and semi-harbaric ideas have been up
rooted with the tares, much alas! of the
good corn of noblesse oblige has shared
their fate.
Short Visits Necessary.
Life in country houses has undergone
perhaps the greatest variation of all, ow
ing to railways, telegraphs and the scurry
in which we spend our days. Short visits
are not only customary, but necessary,
where each engagement in succession
overlaps the other and has to be fitted
in almost like a Chinese puzzle. I am
told that a book which recently appeared,
and which purported to give a realistic
account of the visits of a young girl to
a series of country houses, presents a
fair picture of what goes on in a certain
set; but, if so, I must honestly declare
that it is not one with which I am at all
acquainted.
Then, agafn. we found (to continue our
paraphrase -of the American professor)
private charity; we leave professional
philanthropy. I hope I may be forgiven
for saying that I consider this one of the
greatest blots on our modern system, for
too often it hardly affords a decent cloak
for the grossest hypocrisy and self-inter
est. It is utilized, on the one hand, by
some to erase a stain from their escutch
eon, and by others to advance themselves
either in society or in the more material,
search after a well paid appointment.
Charity for the love of God, and not either
for excitement, gain, or for whitewashing
purposes, is as rare as it is refreshing and
ennobling to witness. The great name,
the brilliant talents, the cultured leisure,
given by some of our conspicuous men
and women to the cause of the poor and
suffering are beacons to follow and monu
ments raised for future generations to
keep before their eyes.
departure, to make as little trouble as
possible for one's host, whose conven
ience may be better considered in the
choice of .one- . train than another.
Should it be necessary to take an early
train it is considerate for a woman
guest to urge her hostess not to rise
earlier than her habit is, but to let her
say good-by the night before, and trust
to the good offices of gome trusty ser
vant to see her off. A man visitor would
take this for granted, and bid his hostess
and her family farewell before retiring
for the night. Â¦ " Â¦ . ,
When taking leave of one's hosts
adieu x should be said to each member of
the family and farewell messages sent
to any who may not be present.
There is a suggestion that ought not
to be required, and yet is of such im
portance that it were best, perhaps, not
to omit to mention. It is that a guest
should hold sacred anything that he or
she may have learned of the family life,
or of tin 1 peculiarities of any member of
a household where .hospitality has been
accepted. A person visiting at different
houses cannot be too careful to avoid re
peating anything that may reflect in the
slightest degree upon his entertainers, or
satisfy the Ignoble curiosity of one of
tho expense of another,
Buck social traitors there have been,
but their popularity is usually short
lived, every one rightly judging that
nothing secures his immunity from like
treatment, where no honorable reticence
can be counted upon.
In literature, as far as society Is con
cerned, 1 fear we cut a poor figure as
compared with our forbears; for though
we are copious, we are not original, as a
rule, or entertaining.
Too Many Itch to Write.
We found writers of witty and some
times learned letters, diaries or memoirs,
expressed with eloquence and ease; we
leave the new journalism, where titles
fetch their price; postcards, and a lan
guage compounded of the slang of many
nations choicely culled and shortened to
(it In with our telegraphic needs and
fleeting opportunities.
It is not only mine enemy who needs no
pressing to write a book; it is his wife,
Ills family, his seoretary, his valetâ and
eVen his little children contribute in their
degree, either pertly or priggishly, to the
pages of weekly papers. Their poems are
murvelously good, all things considered,
if rather tiresome and obvious; and one
hesitates as to which characteristic in
them is most developedâ preternatural
sharpnrs and a weird instinctive Insight
into tho foibles of their elders, for it
eludes punishment -and reduces the parent
to the condition of a silent witness of the
gambols of his offspring among the eggs
of life and society, not all of which are
strictly new laid, and some of which
break, obviously addled, beneath the un
conscious foot of the little dancer. Will
their precocious knowledge fade away as
problems spread themselves, no longer
simple, but complex, before their adoles
cent eyes? or are they young plants,
seedlings of a future race of strange, un
known forest trees, with virtues which
we cannot reach at, and a nearness to na
ture from which education and experience
have debarred our blunted minds? Whs. t
ever they may prove eventually to be, to
us they seem mysterious little offshoots
of some alien stock, reversions, perhaps,
to a long forgotten typeâ changelings in
which we seem to have no part. What
they are as compared with the social
children of the past it Is difficult to say,
for records on this point are sparse; but
it is certain that their relations with
their elders have suffered a complete rev
olution not entirely in favor of the latter.
One of the great disadvantages of
modern society is the disproportionate
number of wottien, which Is much felt In
a Protestant country, where few seek the
protection of a convent from a world
which has no use for them, and where,
although they know that they cumber the
ground, they must always look bright
and amused even when they are dull and
elck at heart. Many such now resort to
studios and other kindred haunts to es
cape from the trammels of a life where it
is not all sunshine, although it may be
all luxury.
Growth of Moral Laws.
As society becomes more complex,
larger and more elastic, bo the moral law
must fit itself to protect the weak from
themselves and from the strong, and to
enable this large and buzzing beehive of
a world to get along without too much
disorder, just as in the streets we walk
to the right or keen to the left, according
to the rule of the road.
Social laws which often seem hard are
really beneficent, and the relaxation which
seems to have taken place in them In
earnest of late years may not prove a
blessing even to those in whose favor they
are loosened.
.It should be remembered that the
time when Dante wrote his "Inferno" the
story of Francesca da Rimini was barely
ten years old; but it will be difficult to
judge of the true state of the society of
our day from Its published records, which
contain hlerhly Bowdlerized accounts of
its real doings. And in spite of all that
can be said either of our period or of pre
vious ones, pure lives shine out; "the
good deed In a naughty world" casts a
plow round darker prospects, but virtue
is not always triumphant nor vice always
scouted.
The good and the bad flourish together
in the world's great fieldâ flowers and
weeds and corn alike; but It is evident
that the good must predominate over thÂ«
bad, or society and its rules, its petty
laws, its great warm life and historic
continuity would long since have faded
Into nothing, as some day It must and
will, which it shall have fulfilled the pur
pose for which it is allowed to exist.
It has always been a point of etiquette
for a guest, immediately upon returning
home, to write v a polite and cordial note
of thanks to his or her hostess, for the
pleasure of the visit not : forgetting
greetings to the other members of her
familyâ in society slang "bread and but
ter letters."
An Important Custom.
It is sometimes difficult, to be truthful
and kind, considerate . and sincere at
the same time, but the fusion of these
qualities Is possible to those whose lives
are based upon great principles. Charity
leads us to see the beat side of those
with whom we. are brought into contact.
Unselfishness brings to us, the -pleasure
that it always yields to those who try
to promote that of others, and courtesy
predisposes one to an amiable frame of
mind and a readiness to receive enjoy
ment from whatever is offered us. If
these "three graces" of charity, unself
ishness and courtesy accompany a guest
the success of the visit will be a 1 (ore
gone conclusion..
It is a graceful actâ so it be gracefully
doneâ to send one's hostess a trifling gift
Boon after one's return homer-something
of which the attraction does . not con
sist in intrinsic value but in the inter
est or pleasure that it may inspire; a
book, a piece of music, a clever game or
a bit of one's own handiwork. it should
seem to be prompted by pleasant remin
iscent thoughts of one's visit, and never
suggest the idea of the payment of a
debt.

in that of the hornbill, where the female,
pitting on her nest in a hollow tree, is
walled in with clay by the male, so that
only her beak projects; and then he feeds
he.r while the eggs are developing. But
even the female hornbill does not expect
to be fed at any other time.

JULIA W. C. CARROLL.
OF course I think woman in business is a success! It has been both my ex
perience and my observation that women who apply themselves earnestly
make money, but It is not on the financial side that they oftenest fall or
euffer loss. It is on the side of personal sacrifice. How many women come
into my shop, saying. "Oh, how delightful to be .in business and to have a
real, definite interest in life and soroet'.ing to occupy one's time, with a real result
at the end of each day or week!"
My serious views on "Women and Business," if worth listening to, are soon
told, but I must add the opinion of a successful man, whose views on business
must be of more value than mine; for though I am grateful to my customers for
the success that I am Indebted to them for, I cannot but give the superiority
on commercial matters to the other sex, even though necessity demands that some
of us must do for ourselves.
The successful commercial man is usually able (so I am told, at least) to take
a broad, comprehensive view, which, however, does not allow minute details to
escape. If he sells blankets, he buys Â»h?ep wholesale, clips the fleece, refines the
wool and manulacturee it into blanket*
When the blanket is ready to sell your man knows not only what It has cost
him to make it. but what percentage of that cost is represented by raw wool, how
much by the cost of the labor, how much by the proportionate share of his rent,
heat, light. Interest on his investment, -.'.c; how much for dye, for wear and tear
and for the thousand and one other details that go to swell his expense account.
Women, on the other hand, business women who succeed, usually do so because
of their inventive faculties, Imagination and adaptability. They are able to tun
I them to sufficient account to be able to pay less attention to -the methods which
bring success to men.

Woman are growing honester, braver,
stronger, more healthful and skillful and
able and free, more human in all ways.
Day by day the bars go down. More

clearness and strength of the brain of
the woman prove continually the injus

poured upon what was scornfully called
"the female mind."
Woman's progress in the arts and
sciences, the trades and professions, is
steady; but it Is most unwise to claim
from these relative advances the supe
riority of women to men. or even their
equality, in these fields. What Is more

the superiority of the women of to-day

The Cause of All
the Discussion.
A FEW months ago Judge Waldo
M. York of Los Angeles
startled the community at
large by stating his belief that
wives should bÂ« bread-winners.
This decision was brought about by
the divorce suit of Mrs. Flora E.
Stephens against Henry Gh Stephens
cn the ground of cruslty and non-sup-
port.
The Stephenses had several chii-
dren. The father had no trade and
shunned work. Mrs. Stephens was
compelled to take in washing to sup-
port the family.
The case was pleaded and submit-
ted. The next day Judge York ren-
dered this decision, to the surprise of
the assembled Stephens family:
"A wife might easily earn enougn
to support both herself and husband.
I believe that women should honr
some of the responsibility of the sup-
port of the family upon their own
shoulders. We ought all of us to work
and do something to keep the world
i going. The mere fact that this wo-
man and her daughters have had to
', help support the family is not in itself
sufficient ground for divorce.

so or proof of his neglect to do so by

Of course a woman can be as successful in business as a man, but
she must learn it, and the sooner she learns to do business as a man
the sooner will she be just as successful.
DR. E. E. McLEAN.
I BELIEVE that a woman can be as
successful in business as a man. She
is satisfied with smaller beginnings
She is saving and small profits suf
fice for her until she can get her head
above water.
But there is no denying that business
is a hard school for most women, espe
cially so If a woman wants to get rich
quickly. Women must not expect to get
money without working hard for it. A
woman hasn't the chances of money mak
ing a man has. She isn't around among
men; she doesn't hear of the financial op
portunities talked of day by day in the
great business centers. Suppose she has
saved up a few hundred dollars and wants
to invest in stocks. She doesn't know how
to go about it. She is timid about ven
turing into the region where man rules
supreme. This is foolish, and she will
MAYOR PHELAN.
I THINK woman is constitutionally
and temperamentally unfit for com
petition in business with man. They
should not be compared !n this re
spect. They should be regarded ai
diverseâ each supreme In his or her respec
tive sphere, for, as Tennyson says, "Wom
an is not undeveloped man, but diverse."
Man should seek his sphere, woman
hers, and these spheres do not lie together
in the business world.
Woman adds to man's life what is need-
reason of his idleness, profligacy or
dissipation, is insufficient to justify a
divorce. Besides, the law does not
contemplate that a poor man, relying
solely upon his labor for support,
should be the only laborer in the fam
ily. In this case the wife and daugb
ter, by honest and honorable employ
ment, were able to earn a living and
had the courage to do so. Their work
was no harder than that ordinarily
done by laboring people, and for
aught that appears the husband may
not have been able to find employ
ment, and if able to find employment
may not have been physically able tc
labor. All people, rich or poor, should
do their part of the work of the world
and not be drones whose existence is
useless.
"But it does appear in this case that
the husbaud, prior to the separation,
was extremely cruel to his wife in
many ways and that without cause he
inflicted upon her grievous mental
suffering and physical injuries, and
upon that ground she is entitled to a
divorce.

women helping to support the family
as such an extraordinary state of af
fairs as to warrant anybody applying
for legal separation upon that

FRANCIS BELLAMY.
THE partnership of marriage is often
a failure because the husband does
not succeed in business.
It is a real failure, although per
haps not always a dismal failure.
The affection stays, all the obligations are
met, and there may continue a loving se
renity. Nevertheless the ghost of failure
is shut up with the two people who are
bound together and who never dream of
ceasing to love. For when hopes are de
clining because the promise of youth has
not met Its opportunity, or because a
misfit seems to clothe every endeavor, two
ambitious partners in marriage cannot be
thoroughly happy.
The young man makes his great essay
in life: the young woman who has tied
her faith to him looks on, encourages and
spurs. But she can do little more than
that.
If she sees him constantly gaining
ground, then gratification and compla
cency are at the bottom of her conscious
ness, and ease of life keeps her face
charming. It is not because he is able to
give her more things, though such things
may be one-fourth of life, but because he
brings true her. dreams of achievement,
because he opens the door of life wider
and she shares his sense of power.
But if affairs go the other way, if the
man fails to grasp here and to combine
there, or if his all-together cannot get
its place, then begins for them both, and
for her in particular, an ordeal of adjust
ment to a less hopeful outlook on the
future. Here is a deadening of hopes, a
dying of longings, which is written on the
faces of multitudes of women who smile
and yet cannot smile it off.
The pathos of this situation raises a
practical question.
MARSHALL WOOBWQRTH.
I HOLD that the husband is entitled
to sue for support. Mutual duties,
responsibilities and cares constitute
the marriage union. Marriage is Â«
civil contract. If the wife Is entitle!

ground of non-support, the husband, vico
versa, should be entitled to the same priv

MRS. RUSSELL SAGE.
WOMAN, when designedVby her Creator, was never intended for business.
God made her to be a homemaker and homekeeper, not a wage earner.
She may take up business life from necessity, but never from choice.
All a woman's early training tends to fit her for wifehood and mother
hood, through which qualities she becomes the home influence, but in no
case is she trained for financial and commercial life. Therefore, if from unforeseen
circumstances she is thrown out Into thÂ» world to earn her livelihood, she Is seri
ously handicapped.
The self-abnegfjicn and trustfulness of woman are great stumbling blocks in
her path to financial success, and it has always seemed a pity to me that men
should lose the better part of woman in what she Is trying to do outside of her
natural functions.
In saying this Ido not wish to be misunderstood. I do not belittle woman's
capabilities, for I am firmly convinced that, notwithstanding her many disadvar
tages, when she is put /to it she is man's equal, if not his superior. Were a
woman trained as a man is, she could easily take her stand side by side with him
in the financial : nd commercial world, but I pray I may be spared that sight.
The better tart of woman, as God made her, is so essentially feminine and de
pendent that X grieves me to see the gr-wing tendency of the age toward welcom
ing her into the arena of business life. To be a successful business woman she
must have a man's brain, and in gaining this she oftentimes loses her womanly
charms and characteristics. I am so thoroughly oM-fashloned myself that I
shudder to see a woman enter the lists against men, and yet I know in many
\ rases she is driven to It against her will. If she must go into business life, if th's
ris to be the future of the coming woman, then it is the duty of mothers and father*
' to train her for such a life, as they train her brothers.
Is the situation unalterable? If the
man, for reasons beyond help, fails hab
itually In his undertakings, is there any
harm to love or to loyalty for the woman
to acknowledge the fact openly and early
to herself? From such an honest admis
sion she can take a new view of their
united fortunes.
What can she do? The chances are
even that she may have in herself that
talent for succeeding which her husband
lacks. In other words, the family should
be exploited for success, as a business
firm would be amid siSilar circum
stances. In a business concern that
member comes to the front who by na
tive force can make the business* flour
ishing.
The woman sometimes Is this effectual
member of the matrimonial firm. It is
lucky If she finds it out In time and de
termines to take up the problem ration

or by foolish fondness.
But a wife usually waits too long be

her husband's eventual failure. ShÂ«
waits until her own day for doing things
is past,, or until she is called upon to
do. but Is not able to do, the creative
kind of work which she might have done
flva or ten years earlier. Sentimentality
for a vanished expectation has narrowed
her idea of herself. She has let discour
agement eat out her heartâ that essence
of discouragement which is distilled
through another's loss of spirit.
How much simpler it would have been

ative work to her own shoulders a 3 soon

was fitted to bear it the better and more
lightly of the two.

and not the exception. Women, with
great credit to themselves, occupy posi

Intellectual Enjoyment in His Work.
; Should he carry the present negotiations
to a conclusion I do not know j what the
court will take from him; perhaps the
year or two' of life that remains to him,
ion the Viceroy is now 80 years of age.
Certainly that will be the ; suggestion of
Prince Tuan and many other influential
Chinese Princes and Viceroys, and Li'
Hung Chang knows it. I, as well as oth
ers, have often wondered why the Viceroy
consented to take -up the task, for he is
not .intensely patriotic, at least not In
cur meaning of the word.'. Â« ,â¢
Some think' he dido it in the hope of
gain, others yielding to the habit or obe
dience which lias become a second nature
to him during Ms six decades of service
to the throne. .. I: think he accepted the
unenviable post, for the intellectual en
joyment which it undoubtedly affords him.
Physically the Grand Old Man of China
is half dead, but intellectually he remains
a marvel, and he loves to sharpen his
wits and light intellectual battles with th-s
eleven representatives of Europe, .rUntl.
ica and Japan who form this chaotic,
most Â¦ inharmonious <body that is callea

There .was one tning, " however,' that
drew him to Peking, and that was tin
thought of seeing tne Hsit;n-i-.ians-ise, oÂ»
the "Loyal; Goou lempic, " wnere he has
always lived when vibiting tne northern
capital. He came here s.xty years, ago,
when he j took his, examinations,, a very
unimportant though . promising youth.
Here he came to announce the suppres
sion of the Taiping rebellion. In good or
evil repute, me priests have -.aiway*
made him welcome, with or without ins
yellow riding jacket.
. The little ceii-ifke guest-room which he
first occupied has been enlarged 10 a pa

the Viceroy has paid ! for the improve

Increased with his prosperity; in fact, hi
favor is the main asset of the otherwise
dilapidated .and somewhat sidetracked
shrine. The priests strike me as a worth
less, ; degenerate lot, but the Viceroy
loves them -all. They furnish him. wil'i
so much amusement.
Some Â¦ one comes in and tells him h.
scandalous story about one of the breth
ren, and -the Viceroy says deprecatingly.
"It cannot be so. I knew his father and
his grandfather, and they were good
men." Those conversant with the
Buddhistic ' canons, will be surprised to
hear of brethren of the yellow robe who
have sons and grandsons, but this is the
fate lof those who dwell in the Loyr.l
Good Temple. :. _ ' ', .
The abbot, in fact, is henpecked. I woul 1
not say so if the Viceroy had not tol.l
me so himself. They live on very happily,

that utter vacancy of | mind which comes
only wtth single blessedness and a rigid

You would not notice it, and I did not

the strange little red tablets with black
characters upon them which for the rest
of the year are to be found in some ob

sticky glucose candy and an adhesive
pancake, which in case of need might
serve as court plaster. For ten days be
fore the new year this shower of food aivl
honors "continues, and the Viceroy, be

loves to -tell you why.
Laughs at Chinese Superstitions.
"The tablets, you see," he says, "are
inscribed with the names of the guard'ans
and governors of the temple. Four days

great guffaws, "but they could tell a good

A PERSONAL RECOLLECTION OF
LI HUNG CHANG.
By George T. Bromley, United states Consul to China Under President Arthur.
1 THINK I may say that I enjoyed
the personal regard of the late Li
Hung Chang to an extent that was
given to but few foreigners.
My first meeting with him took
place at his yamen in Tientsin in 1884,
the first year of my service as United
States Consul to China. He took very
kindly to me and I am sure I did to
him. His first question was to inquire
my age. always a point of great moment
with the Chinese. When he found that
I was five years older than he the favor
able impression I had made seemed to
deepen greatly.
From that time the only two men in
the foreign "settlement who were received
by Li Hung'Chang at any time without
the formality of sending in a card were
the British Consul and myself.
When General Grant was in China. the
Viceroy nianffested for him a stronger
feeling of kindness than he ever felt for
any other foreigner. Grant returned this
feeling and always called Li Hung Chang
the greatest man of the age.
I orce had an impressive interview with
Prince Chun, the father of the last Em
peror of China, and LÂ»i Hung Chang.
When his son came to the throne Prince
Chun had to leave the forbidden city and

WE have met Li Hung Chang,
who is now dead, having been
sick since the fourth month.
He was a great man both in
mind and in stature. He was also a god
man, therefore a man wGom China will
wish back.
Li Hung Chang gave away much
money. In the winter he bought warm
clothes and sent them to the poor people
of his country who were suffering.
You ask, Was he kind in manner? To
foreigners he was kind and to high offi
cers. But Li Hung Chang was a high
officer himself, and it was proper that he
should treat poor people of a lower caste
as If they were servants. He did this,
and it was right that he should.

I wish you could hear the Viceroy laugh
over th-is story. You would see th;it he is
pretty sound in some ways for a para
lytic, and you would see, too, thai by
birth and breeding he is not a high class
Chinaman, but a man of the people. He
throws hlmsrlf back in his chair, clnps
his hand to side and throws his feet
up into the air.
T-hen he. M.out. 1 * "Li li!" an<-l one at
tendant comes with a tomato can par
tially covered with red flannel, which is
the Viceroy's improvised spittoon. And
when this Is over another attendant
brings him his long stemmed pipe, lights
it, takes a whiff or two and hands it to
his lord. Another order is given, followed
by a great hubbub in the antechamber,
and four or five more attendant* appear,
bearing a' charcoal stove.
The Viceroy is. perhaps, tTie richest
man in the world, but he hates to have
more than one stove goinn: in his house at
a time. The stove is the same as coolies
have and it costs 50 cents. The fuel bill
must be 10 cents a day in these dear times.
but wherever the Viceroy goes, there goes
the stove, and those who are wise when
they interview his Excller.cy in winter put

navy, though he had never seen, a ship
or fortincation. When I saw him he was
on his way to Port Arthur to see fortifi
cations and the Chinese squadron at Taku.
He had never seen a foreigner before.
The Consuls and other officials were
received by the Prince and the Viceroy
at the Treaty Temple at Tientsin in the
order of their seniority. The Russian
Consul came first, myself and my Vice
Consul, a young fellow from Rhode Island,
a fluent Chinese scholar, who acted as
my Interpreter, came next.
The Prince asked my age the first thin^r,
and with a twinkle of the eye Li Hung
Chan? told him before I had a chance to
answer.
The Prince said that I being an Ameri
can he hoped our Government would pro
tect his people in my country. I assured
him he could depend upon the protection
of our army and navy. It was about the
time of the Wyoming massacres, and I
noticed Li laughed at my answer. He
seemed to think it was sarcastic.
The Viceroy was a man of very simple
haWts, despite his great wealth, and his
yamen at Tientsin was a one-story build
ing of clay, very modestly appointed.
XVhen about leaving Tientsin I went with
my Vice Consul to dine with Li Hung
Chang. In speaking of my being five years
older than he, he inquired of my habits,
and wanted to know if I drank mucn

in China. What Li Hung Chang's wealth
was we do not know; the Emperor would
never permit him to tell how much money

country.

champagne. I said, "Not when I can get

statement seemed to make a great im
pression upon the Viceroy. Two years
later 1 received a letter from my Vice
Consul, who remained there, saying that
Li Hung Chang had taken to "drinking
whisky. I think that helped him make his
last trip around the world. He never
could have done it on champagne!
Earl Lia most striking characteristics
were his close observation and knowledge
of men. He was looked up to by Chinese
officials as the greatest man in China,
and was a good friend to foreigners. He
was generous, and it cost him thousands
of dollars every time he went to Peking.
The poor would hold him up at the very
gates of the city.
Of course, he had faults and made mis
takes, but he knew they couldn't get along
without him. and was reconciled to dis
grace when he lost his badges.
China, In my opinion, will never have
another like Li Hung Chang. On my sev
enty-fifth birthday he sent me congratu
lations and presents, and when I was re
moved from the Consulship by President
Cleveland he showed the sincerity of hia
friendship by paying $106 for a cable dis
patch to the Chinese Minister at Washing
ton to ask that I might be retained. As
the appointee was a frierid of the Secre
tary of State his request could not be
granted.

Viceroy himself. The Viceroy's living
apartments occupy one side of this second

pipers and resurrected in subsequent is

even the Mahdi or the many lived Osraan
Digna, and yet these 3tories are not whol
ly without justification.
The Viceroy's Morning Toilet.
Practically every morning at sunrise the
Viceroy Is half dead. All his extremities
are cold, and he lies an inert mas 3 upon
Ms k'ang. His glassy eyes are motion
less, his breathing Imperceptible. It
would take a medical man to tell whether
he la alive or dead. At the hour when vi
tality is iowest his is very low indeed.
Every morning he is brought back from
a deathlike sleep to life, slowly, patiently,
by the care of his attendants and the gal
vanizing force of his mighty brain and
heart. Under the direction of a vwy in
telligent Qhinese doctor from CantoV Mr.
Murk, the tiaily operation of resuscitation
is begun, his arms and legs are rubSed
with flannel soaked in alcohol, and a
white substance containing the essence of
almonds is forced down his physically un
willing throat.
Then the Viceroy half opens his eyes,
and ts confronted with a hard boiled egg,
which he nibbles. Then Dr. Mark applies
electricity, shock after shock, and finally
something like a lifelike glow runs
throiig-h the gray, withered body. Two
of his attendants then shake him Into his
clothes, like a pillow into its case. Other
attendants grip him under the shoulders,
and with their help he reaches his work
ing table. By this time his sleepy ener
gies are revived. You would hardly know
the man. He sits upright in his chair,
reads and rereads hia telegrams and with
out a pause dictates the answers and his
dispatches to a succession of secretaries.
Then, but not until after his assistants
âboys in the heyday of youth though
they beâ are fatigued by the exuberant
energy of their chief, something happens.
What it is would be hard to say. A feel
ing of exhaustion arrests him In his men
tal flight, sometimes, though not often,
before his day's work is done. He has
felt a warning that for this day at least
he must no longer concentrate his mind
upon affairs, and without a word he drops
his work.
His people know the signal well and
they bring him one of the classic books
of Confucius beautifully hand written by
some prince of literature, for In ridicu
lous, benighted China there are stiil
princes of literature. This is the only
luxury which the Viceroy permits him
self, the only esthetic taste in which he
indulges â that of having beautifully bound
and artistically written copies of the
works of the Chinese sages.
And now for an hour or two he is lost
entirely to his surroundings. He copies
the words, or rather the ideographs, with
the accuracy of a mathematician and thÂ»
love of an artist reproducing the faded
work of a dead master. In hia opinion
this patient mechanical labor is the great
est restorative. It banishes every thought
of the intrusive powers, the vanishing
court, the crumbling empire, which, after
all his advice and counsel wa9 unheeded,
has been placed upon his shoulders to up
hold.
All goes well In the Good and Jjnyil
Temple until tiffin time, when the Vice
roy closes his book. and. turning -with
some pride from his own well written
transcript of the sage's sentences, begin }
to remember that, like all men ofhfa
inches and Intellect, he is a mighty feeder.

The truth la that the Viceroy anil pre
serves the healthy, appetite of a growing
boy, while his digestive apparatus ha.*
fallen into desuetude. * However, things
go well generally. The Viceroy la given
long strings, of yellow, doughy staff that
looks like macaroni. Dr. Mark tells him
that if he would eat nothing els* he
might live another score of .years and
more, and the Viceroy groans and stoutly
asserts that he would not wish to at such
a price. As a rule, he eats his string of
dough like a man who can -take punish
ment when he must, but when his friend,
the salt commissioner, who lives Just
across the way and is famous throughout
Peking for his excellent cook, submits a
dish for his honored patron's Judgment
and enjoyment, then comes the tug of
.war. The dish in question is generally a
preparation of pork, which, as the insin
uating salt ' commissioner knows, when
once it is placed before him and the fas
cinating fumes narcotize his conscience
the Viceroy loves better than dear life
itself. Dr. Mark pleads, threatens,, ad
jures. .On bended .knee he asks permis
sion to have the offending dish and the
servants of the salt commissioner thrown
out into the street. The Viceroy, as great
a compromiser as Henry Clay, suggests
a middle way. . Let him have the pork.
and the doctor 'can throw the bearers
into the street and give thÂ»-n bamboo
chowchow .besides.
â¢Then the doctor resigns,, washes hi*
hands of the whole , business and looks
suggestively at the coffin outside. The
Viceroy thunders; the pork is twenty feet
away, and alone he cannot reach it. OnÂ«
by one he calls up his attendants and
orders them to place the dish' on the
table before him. They tremble and
sweat until their, tunics cling: about them
like bathing jerseys, looking . anxlouslv
from the doctor to the Viceroy, and then
to the mess of pork, the -boneless bone of
contention. If they stand firm, obeying
the strict orders which coma from the
Viceroy himself In saner, l<Â»sÂ» hungry
moments, the Viceroy grows plaintive.
Ho* never thought to jive to see the day,
he would rather die, now that all who

Then the sleek, fat heads of the attend

MENT THAT "CALIFORNIA
CAN GROW ANYTHING."
OVE day last week I followed the
State Gardener through the Capi
tol grounds at Sacramento, the
largest capitol ground* in the
worldâ Bnd to Californians the
most interesting. He pointed out trees
from every cline, from the Norway spruce
to the cedars of Lebanon: from the
stunted, thickly foliaged trees cf Japan
to the big trees, the Sequoia Gigantea, of
California, whose majestic form towers
grand above them all and hold out the
magnanimous brawny welcome of the
West to the cosmopolitan grove below.
The chosen executives of our State's af
fairs pass In and out of the Capitol
through a thirty- five-acre grove of trees,
representing the countries of the world.
They form a congress of nations of 350
varieties, their habitats giving a historic
atmosphere to the place, in keeping with
the dignity of the Capitol. The State of
ficials, from the Governor and Secretary
â¢f State down, speak of this geographic
grove *with reverential interest.
Looking from the street through this .

and nod to one another against the white
background of the State House,
Rare specimens of trees from other
lands are planted around three sides of
the park in terraced tiers. At U.e rear of
the Capitol is the Memorial Grove, made
up of trees each brought from one of the
famous battlefields of the nation. The
trove Is young yet. but some day in the
future will see it a try sting place, whose
historic associations will make it a. fam
ous favorite.
Farther back are the hothouses and bud

i Among the rare trees that are planted .
I long the three sides, of the park are the
i.<iwscri cypress from the Himalaya
Mountains, distinguished by their cone
shaped. fern-like glistening foliage.
The outer walks are shaded by Roman
pines, whose great, thickly foliaged tops
measure from thirty to fifty feet in
iameter. These trees come from the
mountains of Italy.
The cedars of Lebanon and the rose of
Sharon are from Palestine. A row of
!hese historic roses border the park. It
?as this rose Solomon chose to repre
tent the matchless excellence of the bride.
"1 am the rose of Sharon; the lily of the
r&lley." The home of this rose is south
if Mount Carmei, along the shore of the
Mediterranean. The cyne Sharon was
proverbial in Bible times to express a
place of extraordinary beauty and fruit
tulcess.
"And these." said John Scroggs, the
State Gardener, "are the cedars of Leb
anonâthe favorites of every one. The
Bible says, The trees of the Lord are full
Df sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he
bath plantedâ where the birds make their
rests.' "
The temples or old were built of this
Â» tacred tree. Zachariah in prophesying
' .he desolation of the temple by the Ro
mans says: "Open thy doors, O Lebanon,
that the fire may devour thy cedars."
Solomon's palace was supported by pli
ers made of these cedars. It is referred
to as the "house of the forest of Leba
ton."
Babylon the great has fallen, but these
trees are some of her historic trade
marks.
They were brought from the famous

Its source. These trees made history for
the bleak mountains of Lebanon that

heavy foliage and rare tint of green, de

They grow in this climate with great
luxuriance. Travelers declare that none
can be found anywhere to match them.
There Is an air about them that holds
the attention even where their illustrious
ancestry Is unknown to the- beholder.

Books and Writers
the World Over.
LAFCADIO HEARN Is one of the
few, the very few, whose writings
possess that lasting qualityâ that
rare something that makes each
readinp more pleasurable than the
one before. His books show a combina
tion of gTeat research, long study and
hard work; yet through it all shines
brightly the light of true genius and the
tool of a poet. You feel as you read that
you are receiving the best that a schol
arly scholar has to give.
Mr. Ilearn shows himself so completely
into his work that hi& very enthusiasm
cantos you away. He treats his subjects
in such charmingly poetical prose that
Urn very expression of his thoughts Is de
lightful. There is not one of his former
N>oks but deserves a place of honor on
the library tableâ and his latest. "A Jap
anpse Miscellany," is far from the ex
ception.
As its title suggests. "A Japanese Mis
cellany" is a little of everything, but that
r- very thing is entirely Japanese. The at
mosphere of the land of art, flowers and
quaint superstitions that Mr. Hearn puts
into his sketches and essays Is at once
convincing and fascinating. In the pres
ent book the contents are made up of*
three sections: "Strange Stories," "Folk
lore Gleanings" and "Studies Here and
Therw."
His strange stories are, as usual, par
ticularly weird and peculiarly Japanese.
The first two tell respectively "Of a
Promise Kept" and "Of a Promise
Broken." In the "Promise Kept" Is de
picted a young Japanese who values his
word so highly that he commits hara
kiri that he may keep an appointment In
spirit which he is unable to redeem in
the flesh. The "Promise Broken" is even
more weird and horrible. It tells of a
dying wife who pledgee her husband to a
life of celibacy, and when he breaks his
vow she deals with his second wife ac
cording to all the most frightful ethics
t f ghostly Japan.
"The Story of Kwashin Koji" is in
more cheerful vein and has quite a bit of
Japanese humor In it. It tells of the
wonderful doings of old Koji, whose per
tinacity and peculiar faculty for gather
ing himself together Just after he has
been cut to pieces would baffle the in
genuity of any wizard of ancient or mod
ern fairy tale lore.
Several other stories are given under
this section, all equally good and all with
just the right touch to make them dis
tinctly Japanese and Instructive as well
6s entertaining.
The second section of "Folklore Glean
ings'" is even more charming and inter
esting.
Here Mr. Hearn e-ives us some more of
those translations of charming little Jap
p.nese verses that have added so much to
his past works. In "Exotics and Retro
r :><?ctives" we found them under "Frogs"
and "Insect Musicians"; "Shadowings"
â¢>nriched with many little poems on
< icadaf and with some old Japanese
:ongp: "In Ghostly Japan" had its "Bits
Â«try." and now he continues- the
series with a paper on the poems relating
â¢m ihc dragon flies and an essay on "The
Gongs nf Japanese Children."
The little legend of the dragon fly's
pearance in verse is very pretty:
â¢For more than ten centuries the Japa
nese have been making verses about
a flies, and the subject remains a
rite enc even with the younger poets
if to-da.v. The oldest extant poem about
a dragon fly is eaid to have been com
rÂ°?ed fourteen hundred and forty years
npn by the Emperor Yurlaku. One day
white the Emperor was hunting, say the
â¢ â¢.! records, a gadfly came and bit his
p.m. Therewith a dragon fly pounced
vpon that padfly and devoured it. Then
Kmperor commanded his Ministers to
an ode in praise of that dragon fly.

. ending with the words:

Â¦\VaitE upon the Great Lord;
Thy form it will bear,
.raato, land of the dragon fly!
; in honor of the loyal dragon fly
;ice of the incident was called Akit
or the Moor of the Dragon Fly."
From that day to the present time the
dragon fly has been a favorite subject
Â¦with the poets of- Japan. Mr. Hearn
many examples of their picture
- on this subject. Microscopic verses
an be properly called, these poems
he old, old school, when time' was
abundant for close study by the poetical
rhi'.osopher. This explanation will give
an idea, and one example will show how
Â»l-fterent this old world of letters was
lrom ours of the present:
"In the form hokkuâ limited to seven
ties syllablesâ the poems on dragon flies
are almost as numerous as are the dragon
â¢hemselves in the early autumn. For
Illustration From "A Japanese MiscelHaoy.
In this measure there are few restraints
placed upon the composer, ' either as to
theme or method. , Almost the only rule
about i hokku â at all a rigid one â is
that the poem shall be 'a little word pic
tureâthat It shall revive the memory of
something seen or felt â that it shall ap
peal to some experience of sense. The
greater number of the poems that I am
going to quote certainly fulfill this re
quirement; the reader will find that they
are really picturesâ color -prints in the
manner of the Uklyo-ye school. Indeed,
almost any of them could delightfully

Hi go nari. / -.'.'. ./.'' ; Â¦'â¢.
, "Dragon files are flitting and the noon
sun is Â¦ shining above the village where
nothing ever happens." ."
Of course, according jto our lights the
foregoing- Is far from poetry. Mr. Hearn
has this to say: i -Â¦',: . Â¦â¢'"*Â¦â¢"'-.
"Of course these compositions make but
slight appeal to the esthetic sentiment;
they are merely curious, for the most
part. But they help us to understand "
something of the soul of the elder Japan.
The . people who could find delight, cen
tury after century, In watching the ways
of Insects, and in making such verses
about them, must have comprehended,
better than we, the simple pleasure of ex
istence. ' They could not, Indeed, describe
the magic of nature as our great West
ern poets have done; but they could feel
the beauty of the world without its sor
row, and rejoice in its beauty, much after
the manner of inquisitive and happy, chil
dren." .....-,. ;
An even more Interesting chapter is the
one on "Children's Songs." Mr. Hearn
gives numerous examples, and from these,
while it seems that children's ideas the
world over naturally run to the same sub
jects for their little songs, still these of
the Japanese are more- delicate, more
filled with imagery/ and a sense and ap
preciation of the beautiful in nature than
those of other nations. ..;â¢ '.. â¢ . ...
. In the third section is given a series
of essays under the title, "Studies Here
and There." Each and every one of them
Is worth a third reading, but one strikes
me as particularly noteworthy for Its les
son between the lines. Mr. Hearn ' has
lived in Japan for years, and has de
t voted all his time to a study of its people.
He is at present the lecturer on English
literature in the Imperial University of
Tokiox Words from a man so well in
formed are not to be lightly put aside,
and therefore the hint to missionaries in
"The Case of O-Dai," it is to be hoped,
may bear some fruit. Not that Mr. Hearn
through this sketch, shows . himself an
enemy of missionary work well done, but
he points out most strongly the hopeless,
pitiful, miserable and wrong ending, that
must result from even well-meaning ef
forts of people who do not understand
any civilization but their own. -_â¢'

J. A. Mitchell, editor of Life, gives us
a love story extraordinary in "The Pines
of Lory." It has much of .the charm that
made "Amos Judd" so many. friends; the
same delightful girl who at .first" hates
and ' then finds : that it was love ! all . the
time, the same; man who has a dash of
the unknown in - his life that appeals to
the feminine mind, and the same choice
of situation out of the ordinary. ;
But the present book lacks the skillful
holding of attention to the very end that
makes "Amos Judd" so Interesting. Al
though Amos Judd dies according to his
own prediction and thus ruins every
chance of the "lived happy ever after
ward," still that Is the artistic finish and
only possible ending for such a story.
"Amos Judd" is clean, clear cut and a
story of undivided Interest. "The Pines
of Lory" has. a story within a story which
weakens both to a. certain extent.
It is only in comparing this last book
"with Mr. Mitchell's first effort that the
former suffers, so it is hardly fair to dwell
on these points, but merely as praise of
"Amos Judd" the truth must be hinted
sotto voce, "The Pines of Lory" is
not as good as "Amos Judd." j
The conditions in "The Pines of Lory"
resemble In a way those given in "The
Master Knot," a book that attained to
some prominence last season. In "The
Master Knot" the author has as hero and
heroine two normal society persons of the
present time who are left as the sole sur
viving human beings on earth. In "Tlie
-â¢ Pines of Lory" the hero and heroine are
left by mistake on an uninhabited shore.
Fortunately they find a house and pro
visions whose owner had just died.
The romantic element is further en
hanced by the fact that the girl has been
considering the matter 'of giving her life
up to the church, and the man has un
wittingly offended her by speaking light
ly of religion. The man has just returned
from the war in South Africa and is prac
tically an invalid, for the fever is still in
his bones. So there is the situationâcer
tainly an interesting oneâ two congenial
people who barely speak to each other on
account of their recent quarrel, the
chance that they will have to remain in
each other's company for an indefinite
time, one house, and provisions for
months.
To add to the dramatic part of the
story the man sleeps in the woods the
first night of their enforced sojourn, and
In the morning the woman finds him ly
ing under the trees- in the rain and en
tirely out of his head with the fever. For
eight days she nurses him and finally
saves his life.
This, then, is the beginning of a pretty
love story. Mr. Mitchell holds the out
ward avowal of their mutual affection for
many pages of excellent reading. The au
thor certainly understands how to make
the most of a pretty love story, and his
powers of Invention give just the right
touch to keep one wondering how the
whole affair will turn out.
While it is with pleasure that the reader
finds the man is really loved by this one
woman of his choice, still it is a matter
for regret that the suspense is not ftept
up until nearer the end ot the story.
After you know that Cupid has won the
game the main interest is goneâ for up to
this time the love affair has been all in all.
Now, you must sit down and try to inter
est yourself in how they are to get back
to the world and also in the second story
the mystery of the former occupant of
their house, all of which occupies nearly
half of the book. This second story is a
very pretty one and told in Mr. Mitchell'9
good style, is quite acceptable, but it
makes an ending too long distant from the
strong climax. (Published by The Life
Publishing Company, New York).

First Principles of Nursing.
"First Principles of Nursing," by Anne
R. Manning, graduate of the City Hospi
tal of the Qulncy (Mass.) Training School,
is a simple and practical book to be used
In cases of emergency or before a trained
nurse is called. The opening chapter dears

nursing, the qualities desirable in a
nurse, relations of nurse and patient,
behavior In the- sickroom, and the nurse's
duties to herself. Chapter two treats of

gargles, etc. The fifth chapter is devoted
to the bed, its structure, care, etc.; how
to give a bath in bed, how to change
nightgown, care of mouth, hair and nails,
and the temperature of baths are dis
cussed In this chapter.
The sixth and seventh chapters deal
with the skeleton, with fractures, disloca
tions and sprains, with muscles and liga
ments, hemorrhage, etc. Chapter eight
is devoted to the composition and func
tions of the blood, and to the arteries,
veins and capillaries, the heart and cir
culation. The ninth chapter treats of air,
of respiration and the organs concerned In

tion and the digestive organs, foods, cook
ing and koumiss. Chafer thirteen treats
of the nervous system and organs of the
special senses; chapter fourteen of un
consciousness and the diseases that are
accompanied by it, heat exhaustion, and

Modern French Socialism.
"The French Revolution and Modern
French Socialism," by Jessica B. Peix
otto. Ph. D., has just been published by
Thomas V- Crowell & Co., New York.
Just at this time, whpn the attention of
the whole civilized world is turned toward
the Solution of the socialistic problemâ
when the stern outgrowth oÂ£ this doctrine
is menacing the heads of all governments
â a work analyzing the first fruits of so
cialism is of distinct value. Such a work
is this study of the French Revolution and
its resultant creed, which during the past
century has left an Impress upon civiliza
tion by begetting socialism in present-day
Dr. Peixotto's study lo on the broadest,
most dispassionate lines. It betrays the
investigation of a scholar who Is seeking
to arrive at the truth. The work Is evi
dently the result of painstaking research
back to the original sources. Beginning
with the "Principles of the French Revo
lution" and the growth of the idea of
political liberty, the author locates the
various Influences, internal and external,
which converged to the final crisis, "de
signed to establish what seemed a social
order more propitious than that which
had been conducted by the long-estab
lished, but now discredited, authorities.
Their guiding principles were not deduc
tions from the history of man, but from
reason."
The purpose of part I Is to show how
Frenchmen of the eighteenth century
came to be at odds with the creeds of an
old social order and how this quarrel bred
a new set of theories winch came to be
counted fundamental truths; then the
general character of these new beliefs is
described. In part II the discussion passes
over to the next century, there to follow
another series of progressive changes re
sulting in another body of principles lev
1 eled against the accepted social order.
The author endeavors to outline the Im
mediate influences which have developed
French socialism into a specific doctrine,
and to define that doctrine at Uie present
time. Finally comes a summary and a
comparison of the social with the political
theory. (Price $1 50.)
Masters of Oratory.
The Illustrations in "Among the Great
MaÃters of Oratory," by "Walter Row

They are the result of painstaking re
pearch and show the hand of the prac
ticed collector, as well as the taste of the
connoisseur. These reproductions of cele
brated paintings, in the most thorough

the text.
Orators are less fortunate than poets
and artists; the poem lives as long as the
language; even the canvas and marble
defy the ravages of time; but the voice
Js forgotten with the speaker, and too
frequently the very subject of an oration
becomes unintelligible to the generation
that follows. Speeches are almost always
of contemporary rather than permanent
interest.
The great orator lives in his personality
or his style. The magnetism of his pres
ence Is gone; the occasions that called out
his great speeches are past; his very
themes are of decreasing Interest. We
must build up that past again; must in
Imagination become contemporary yith

. Wherefore Didst Thou Doubt.
. There are , three j attitudes we can take
: toward any statement. .First, we can say
Â¦ That is trueâ attitude of faith. Sec
ondly, we can ; say. That Â¦is ; not - trueâ the
\ attitude : of ; denial. Thirdly; : we can say
Is that true or not?â the attitude of doubt
Doubt is not denial, although It Involves
the denial of faith which relies upon a
statement as true. And because of doubt
arises the counter query, wherefore?
The walking of Peter on the water Is
analogous to the progress of the soul
througn life; and the terms and elements
of this analogy are clearly and con-
Blstently outlined In "Wherefore Didst
Thou Doubt r 1 by Cleland B. McAfee. The
lesson expounded Is a beautiful onÂ©. Doubt
at the same time a practical one. Doubt
enters into so very many situations of Ufa
that it is soul tonic to stop, face the ques
tion calmly and inquire, wherefore?

Standeth God Within the Shfdow.
"Standeth God Within the Shadow?" by
David Starr Jordan, is a plea for the re
ligion of scienceâ the abiding faith in a
controlling force so vast that no problem,
great or small, can be reckoned with
out it.
Men are slow to recognize that nature
has her own laws and purposes. She is
not the executor of human Justice. "The
rain falls on the Just and the unjust."
When the tower of Siloam falls men are
prone to seek for the cause of it not in
its rotten foundation but in the wicked
ness of those who happened to bo under
It. The ideas which Christ once sharply
rebuked have been the source of many
superstitions. Men In all ages have been
as "the wicked generation that seeketh
for a sign when no sign shall be given
them." God always deals with us in
kind. Of the same nature as the action
is it* reward or its penalty.
This religion of science, then, is retri
butive, and is the Just working "out of the
Immutable laws of nature set and estab
lished by the Creator from the beginning.'
A varying law of nature would be the de
struction of the universe.
It is in this vein that the present book
let presents its viewsâ broad, sane and
Invigorating. The essay is. couched In a
spirit so reverent that it cannot imagine-
God save as Infinitely above the fluctua
tions often ascribed to him by human in
tellects. (Published by Thomas Y. Crow-

Belgian Hare Manual,
rd & Lee, the Chicago publishers,
just Issued "The Standard Belgian
Hare Manual," by Dr. George F. Hall,
who is a member of 'the National Asso
ciation of Belgian Hare Fanciers and an
authority on this new Industry. The
book contains 225 pages, with 35 illustra
tions. The work is compiled and edited
from the world's best authorities, and
embraces all that beginners and fanciers
need to know about the selection, mating,
breeding, feeding, housing, selling and
general management of this newly
crowned king of the rabbit race. The
rise of the Belgian hare is an Interesting
study. The little animal is not only a
charming pet, but commercially profita
ble. From a very small start hundreds of
thrifty boys and girls, and especially wo
men, have made snug. sums. Numerous
authentic instances of big profit are de
tailed in this volume. Many have con
sidered the hare business as a mere fad,
which would soon run its course; others
have prophesied that their wonderful fe
cundity would soon result in their over
running the land as a pest. But Dr.
Hall takes a higher view, and conscien
tiously classifies the raising and market
ing of hares as a pleasant, profitable and
jionorable industry. (Paper, cover in col
ors, 26 cents. Extra cloth, 75 cents.)

make up her new volume is a thoroughly
original and engaging little hero in
knickerbockers, whose adventures with
other children such as his foil the

the American Dauphin.
It has recently been learned that Mrs.
Frances J. Tallmadge of Sheboygan,

painting left with her family by Williams,
and said to be the portrait of Louis XVI,
father of the Dauphin. The Princa de

It cannot but appeal to Americans and
cement the Anglo-Saxon bond the more
firmly to read in the English press the
sentiment expressed and sympathy so
quickly extended after the assassination
of our late President. Even in far-away
Australia Is evidenced the same feeling of
sorrow. In the October issue of Dal
gety's Review, a monthly record of mat
ters connected with the pastoral and agri
cultural industries of Australasia, is an
excellent article on the life and work of
President McKinley. Besides a fine por
trait of the late President, the article is
further illustrated by a halftone repro
duction of "An Australian Mark of Sym
pathy With the American Nation." which
showa a handsome floral piece with the
words on it, "Australia Shares America's
Sorrow." This design stood five feet high
and was comprised of Cape flowers, thÂ»
wreath at the top of t*e pillar being of
laurel leaves and tied with the American
colors in riooons. Best of all." however.
Is the feeling that actuated the expres
sion. Dalgety's says: "The handsome
tribute of sympathy, thoue-h only com
posed of flowers, represented thoroughly
the feeling 01 sorrow so widely felt
throughout Australia."
The contributions to the International
Monthly for November treat of a wide
range of subjects, the majority of which
are discussed by Americans, although
there are several of the highest interest
by Europeans.
Professor Leon Marllller. In an essay on
"Ernest Renan and the Soul of the Celt."
performs a valuable service in that he
offers a thoroughly sympathetic study
of the great writer who. in such wide cir
cles. Is still known chiefly through the
medium of an acrid theological contro
versy.
Professor Hugo Munsterberg. m the
conclusion of his "American Democracy."
removes all doubt. If any ever existed, as
to his thorough appreciation of our in
stitutions; nor does he fall to discover,
in spite of all external differences, a
deeper inner harmony between Germans
and Americans.
Salvatore Cortesl offers a brilliant char
acterization of Francesco Crispi which
will come as a revelation to many to
whom the wonderful Italian was little
more than a name.
Professor N. S. Shaler discusses the
"Future of the Gold Supply"; Mr. Frank
K. Foster "Strikes and the Phllosphy of
the Strikers"; and Professor Jeremiah W.
Jenks writes of "Industrial Combinations
in Europe." with the mastery that comes
from his profound and accurate knowl
edge of the subject.
Professor Dana Carieton Munro. in a
charming study of "Christian and Infldel
in the Holy Land." puts a fascinating
theme in an entirely new light.
The November Outing is perhaps more
especially a football number with an in
structive article on the difference between
English and American football, by the ex-
Harvard athlet*. John CorWn. Walter
Camp, "father of football," tell* of the
likely development of football In 1901. and
Dr. Henry L. Williams, the successful
coach of the famous Minnesota eleven,
contributes a very interesting paper on
the development of Middle- Western foot
ball. There is a paper on "The King i
Horses," telling of King Edward's career
as a breeder and owner of thoroughbreds, I
with beautifull Illustrations! of some of ta\
famous members of the King's stud. Bl*
game hunters will be attracted by a story
of "My First Bull Moose," by the re
nowned African big game hunter, Fred- I
erio Courtney Selous. Then there Is a i
remarkable adventure with grizzly bears .
that Is perhaps the most extraordinary '
experience a hunter ever had. Shotgun '
men will like Edwyn Sandy's paper on
"One November Day" with woodcock,
grouse and quail in the bag; and there <,
entertainment in "With the Wild OÂ«<^,,
In the Northwest" Those who are Inter
ested in Indian pottery will enjoy the pa
per by George Wharton James; and
campers will do well to read Horace K*>d
hart's "Bit of Woodcraft," and Thomas
W. Fralne's "How to Preserve Trophies
In the Field." This is the prime of thÂ«
duck-shooting season, and the article r, n
"Ducking Boats of Many Waters." with
diagrams of types, will be worth the while
of sportsmen. The "Evolution of the
American Designer." by W. P. Ste
will be entertaining just now wh
American designer has again demon
strated his superior ability.

THE FICKLE WHEEL OF
DAME FORTUNE TURNED
AGAINST HIM.
S\ LD S; n Francisco Is passing away.
/ *\ Hut it is not passing so quickly
I J nor mi completely ttiat strangers
V^ and artists have nothing left to
admire and study. The best relio
of "early days" is what is known now
and What was known then as the "Gov
ernor Latham mansion." It was the
finest house on the coast for years, in
fact, until the brownstone house of the
Floods came around the Horn.
Besides being known for its beautiful
Interior and furnishings. it was known as
the heart of society in the est just as
the White House is In the entire States.
In 1850 Milton Slocum Latham came to
San Francisco with Judge Heydenfeldt.
Fire and all kinds of trouble set upon
him, first singly and then In crowds, and
the first thing he knew he was handling
the reins and carrying freight from her*
to there. For this teaming he received
$16 a day.
After caring for his horses one night
he put his hands In his pockets and saun
tered, downtown. A gathering attracted
his attention. Now it so happened that
Colonel John B. Wel*er was scoring Con
gress for not admitting California into
the Union.
Without thinking Latham made a reply
so bright, so to the point and so thor
oughly appropriate that he immediately
attracted the attention of the politicians.
The next day he changed his position
and incidentally hfas profession.
Fortune again seemed to smile upon him
and had he possessed the wonderful lamp
of Aladdin he could not have made money
any faster than he did.
The ill-health of his wife. Sophie Bird-
Ball Latham, caused the Governor to look
about for a home where she could have
perfect rest and untiring care. About that
time Joseph Woodworth built a handsome
home on a double lot on Folsom street,
between Second and Third. The indi
viduality of the place particularly pleased
Latham's fastidious eye and he maae up
his mind to purchase it if money would
do it.
Fifty-five thousand dollars answered the
purpose.
The only change that was then made
-was to buy the adjoining lot and have the
house removed. What he wanted was
absolute quietness for the tired, troubled
mind of his wife.
At the end of two years he found him
self alone in the mansion and commenced
to remodel it to suit his own sweet will.
No such trifling thought as to the price
of anything ever entered his brain. He
had plenty of money, and what was more,
his investments were bringing In 18 and
Â£3 per cent annually. He wanted a bil
liard hall. a music-room and a bowling al
ley. To want was to have with him.
The mantel in the music-room Is said to
be the finest piece of carving on this
coast. It is of solid mahogany and repre
sents the hunt. Two Herculean figures
hold it up on either side and Jheir ta^sk
sextos no light one. Directly over the
fireplace is a wild boar's head and turned
toward it on either side, as though still
in pursuit, are two hounds.
' The cantha leaf is twist-ed and turned
to make the graceful pattern that fol
lows up one side and down the other. A
stag bead, a figure blowing a horn and
another holding a Â£pear*higu in the air.
make an effective top for it.
No euch carving was done here In those
days, nor, for a fact. in these cither. The
carvers were brought over from England,
end the work was done slowly and welL
And that is why those Interested in wood
work are told by authorities in that line
to visit and study thÂ« Latham home.
Bat that mantel was not all by any
aJuii
The dining i corn has on* of oak that
looks every bit as solid and as stable, but
not nearly as fanciful in design. The pil
lars are held up by two heads. The work
Is very heavy until the top is reached,
where two laughing cupids hold a mono
gram "M. S. L." In place.
The wood all over the roomâ and there
Is plenty of itâ is of oak. and years have
softened It and given It a beautiful tone.
The ceiling In the banquet hall represents
a group of cupids at play. Some are
chasing each other, evidently enjoying a
game of tag. while others are perfectly
content to bill and coo.
Placed at different advantageous 1 posi
tions about the room are life-sized bronze
statues holding aloft a water pitcher,
from which spring three gas fixtures. The
stand, figure and fixtures were all brought
from Europe, as was almost everything
else in the house.
The entrance to the mansion surprises
and puzzles one.
The yard ; t!je.t once looked like green
velvet, is now a sun-dried brown. Here
and there stand pedestals, while at their
feet are the fallen heroes that some ex
tra strong gust blew over. At one side
stands Venus de Mllo in all her white
glory, with a clothesline about her beau
tiful throat. The various garments flip
and flap and seem to mock her. As may
be Imagined, the entire appearance of the
place suggests neglect, but through all
the grime and the accumulation of year*
the house and surroundings show what
they have been.
The wide steps and veranda are very
inviting, but the minute the door is open
ed and one sees the beautiful marble
vases and the broken mirrors side by side
a feeling of pity and disappointment
comes.
The vases are about seven feet high,
that Is, stand and all. The lower part is
heavy and made in the form of a pillar,
and with very little attempt at decora-;
tion. The vase proper Is slender at the
bottom, but tapers gradually until the
center is reached, and then It tapers again
the other way. The flowers that ornament
it are raised and after all this stretch of
years not one delicate rose or leaf has
been broken off. /oÂ» /:
They stand at either side of the hall
like two white sentinels. Just behind them
is the large mirror that once reflected so
many pretty faces and so many' hand
some gowns. Now it is cracked into fifty
pieces, and the faces and gowns that
pass it these days belong not tH the aris
tocracy, but to an entirely different class
of people. . .
But nothing can hide the woodwork
that frames the glass. The same carv
ing surrounds it and the same precious
wood is its mounting. The broad stair.
railing and the post at the broaa stair
carved of mahogany and extremely beau
tiful.
The finest room in the house was the
library. Even to this day it is called the
finest in the city with one exception, that
being in the Colton mansion. Everything
used in the construction of this magnifi
cent apartment, from the lattice work
that supports the cushioned seats that
fill the three bay windows, to the ex
quisitely carved mantel, was brought
from Europe. The mantel, by the way,
cost $1500, quite enough these days to put
up a summer hut.
The chandeliers were a glitter of cut
and engraved crystal held In place by
great golden chains. Latham liked Turk
ish rugs and he used them, too. The floor
of his pet room was inlaid with hard
wood, but an immense ra* covered the
center of the 800-foot square room. The
bookcases which surround the room are
made of mahogany with inset trimmings
of ebony. Even the great panes of glass
are thick French plate and have a wide
engraved floral border on every one of
them.
All of these things were selected by
the man who meant to enjoy them, and
carried one from here, another from
there, until the art centers across the
waters had sent their best and proudest
away.
Such an Immense room needed furni
ture to correspond. Great divans, cov
ered with soft pillows, stretched out in
vitingly; deep rocking chairs near a table

tempted one to rest and take lire easy.
Nor was the beautiful left out in the
furnishings. A life-sized statue of "Cal
ifornia," by Hiram Powers, and Rogers'
"Nydia" kept watch over the room and
Its precious belongings. For Latham
spared neither time nor money on his
books. He was a studious man and well
acquainted with the poets. A library to
him was one of his chief pleasures, and
his collection of books was large and well
selected.
Next to the library he built a conser
vatory that was perfect from its daintily
matched Italian tiles to the array of
beautiful flowers that always blos
somed.* His idea was somewhat Roman.
He wanted while enjoying himself thor
oughly to be able to glance up and see
the statues glistening in the sun and to
lose his sight in the foliage that sur
rounded the place. He was in every sense
of the word artistic.
The style of that day was to have
everything stiff and very much alike.
Haircloth furniture was all the rage, and
was there anything mow hideous ever
invented? That didn't appeal to the Gov
ernor Just because all the fashionables
happened to have It in their drawing
rooms, and that was the principal rea
son why his beautiful home was fur
rlshed with European productions. He
couldn't buy anything at home that Just
struck his fancy.
But when the house was complete Is
Itself there was a certain something that
was lacking and that was needed badly.
It was a mistress.
In February, 1870, he married one of the
"Three beautiful Macks"â Mollle McMul
len, Jennie McNulty and Ella Maxwellâ
who were the three acknowledged belles
of the city. With her as a leader, the
Lathams began a reign of fashionable
gayety and lavish entertainments such as
haii never been dreamed of and such as
have never been equaled since.
There were balls, parties, receptions and
dinners in rapid succession and It was no
strange sight to see two and three blocks
of carriages lined up about their home.
To dÂ« Invited to an affair was an nonor
and all invitations issued from the Fol
som-street house were eagerly sought
after and highly regarded.
About that time the Governor startled
the people, of San Francisco by driving a
spanking pair of well-matched thorough
breds. But instead of being & black or a
bay, with well-matched tails and manes,
they were exactly different. On* was
black and the other pure white, but well
Hatched nevertheless.
Consternation was great. Even the
small boy on the street stopped and gazed
with his mouth open and then asked,
"Who Is it?" Invariably the answer
given was, "Governor Latham."
It was in this house that Milton Thur
low Latham was born and lived his baby
hood. A few years later the> Governor
built his summer home in Menlo Park and
It was called "Thurlow lodge" after his
baby. To leave his only child a fortune
second to none in California was his am
bition. His own life had been a towering
success, but he wanted even more for hiÂ»
boy. It is a common trait of all fond
parents.
But the wheel of fortune stopped at the
wrong place. Instead of coining money
hand over fist he lost it and In just as
rapid a fashion. Six millions in one clip
went under in an unfortunate railway
scheme. One thing followed another and
worse went to worse until in 1880 the
Folsom-street mansion, that was so dear
to its owners, had to be sacrificed. Sena
tor Sharon bought It and gave it to his
daughter, Mrs. F. G. Newlands, as a
present, but the broad and delightful hos
pitality was missing. The true master
and mistress were gone.
A few years later the tide of fashion
turned and flowed into another part of
town and no person, who bad means
enough to keep up such an immense
establishment wanted to live in that
neighborhood.
So the house that cost such a fortune,
taste and almost extravagance wa's turned
into a boarding-house. Even that didn't
pay, for some of the rooms required 100
yards of carpet, and while there were
twenty-four of them, they should have
been about three times smaller, to suit a
typical boardtng-house keeper.
An orphanage next moved in. The chil
dren played with the statues, slid down
the mahogany stairrails. threw spitballs
at the laughing Cupids and used the
handsome mirrors as targets.
Even that didn't pay.
Now a "Housekeeping Rooms to Let"
sign is tacked on the massive pillars that
guard the front door, and If the sign and
the black and white marble pavement
quarrel no one is the wiser, but they cer
tainly do not \o9k very congenial.
The people who hurry and scurry up
and down the diamond pathway now are
the very ones who used to stop and star*
with mouths wide open at such glory.
Truly the ways of the world are pass-
Ing strange. .

est story the brush of Peters ever to!<*
is that of the haunted houseâ a painting
which^ recently caused so much ' comment
in the Sorosis Club exhibition and iÂ»
now scanned and discussed from the walla
of the Bohemian Club gallery. The sub

appearance, sagging and reek with
age, stands on the slope of the mountain,
where the road curves; the atmosphere Is
that of chilly middle night or early morn

sweep around the weather-beaten tim-- '
bers; a dim light appears timidly through
a tiny paned window; perhaps with its
assistance some new horror is being en

that statuesque beauty Miss Joan Haden

of last year's club exhibition, will bava
a rival in Miss Ruth Kirkpatrick, a
Salt .Lake belle who has journey to our
coast for the winter months. .
- Not only has Miss Kirkpatrick a com
plexion of. pure transparent olive, that !
will spur any artist on to his highest ef
forts, but she has an easy pose and a
characteristic tut of the chin * which is
admirable. Mr. Clawson, contra i*y to hla

which is worn an elaborate embroidered
kimono of red, trimmed with a ape and
border of the soft-toued fur of the golden

The work, which will be completed for

give the artist a long stride toward fame.
There is also in the same studio nearing
a state of completion the life sized por
trait of the little daugHter of the late
Hugh Tevis; another of a young Del

wonderful purple, an<4 this, which is atÂ»x> -
lor the club, will be entitled "A Sym
phony in Violet." William Keith is mura
busy â¢ than ever this winter. His studio ,
is literally rilled with canvases, beautiful
California scenes. One of the most rseent
from his hand is an early dawn, or
"Morning Star." A pool of water in tha
foreground reflects hazily the reeds fring
ing its edge. An atmosphere of repose i:Â»
there; all nature is asleep, even the tiny
star over the tops of the trees in th.- dis-^
tance shines dimly through a transparent
cloud."
Beautiful in composition Is this canvas,
a veritable poem of nature.
Mr. Keith says that of ail the canvases
he has finished this year the "Morning
Star" is his favorite, for it appeals to
the highest thought of man. - Students In
black and white would do well to take a
few ideas from an original etching of the*
famous Zorin, a little rarity which is on

There are also several W rustlers In th#

far more strength than the labored ef
forts of hours. A Zorin or a Whistler in
its very simplicity is restful. - â¢

Many of the artists who have coma
back to the city for winter are delving
through Chinatown, for the field for art
is almost limitless. Almost any day In
the Â¦ alleys in front of the joss houses, at
each turn and angle, sits an artist, stu
dent or. sometimes a teacher with a class
of two or three, all painting Chinatown,
some in detail, others leaving more to the
imagination; some in soft tones, other*
painting in a high key, for, strange as it
may seem, three artists all at work on
one subject will each see a distinctly dif
ferent : color. An old wall, for instance,
will by one be painted - array, by another
a purple tint, and perhaps a third may
get it blue. By this means nature ha?
happily provided against monotony In our
galleries.
The California Camera Club ; announces
that in conjunction with the San Fran
cisco Art Association the second San
Francisco photographic salon will be held
in the galleries of the Mark Hopkins In

continuing for two week*. The object of
this salon is to exhibit that class of pho
tographic work which shall best exempli
fy artistic feeling and execution, without
regard to ; particular schools or fads. A
special Invitation to exhibit is extended to
Eastern . and foreign photographers. The*
possibilities of photography have so
broadened and . developed in the last few
yaars, and there is such an open field to
exercise individual .taste and judgment;
that this exhibition is sure to be full of
artistic merit and pictorial interest.
Â¦A little incident of an ambitious art
student is going the rounds. A zealous
member of the life class was strolling
along Kearny street, his mind filled with
lights, shadows, harmony, breadth, and
his subconscious dreams of Paris and .
fame, when just ahead of him he espied
the very person whom he fancied the
fates had sent for a mode) to inspire him
and send his name into the Â»?e beyond.
An old. old man. very erect but gray,
and a face upon which nature had painted
vividly the struggles, the pleasures and
pain of many years. :
He noticed also, this student of art and
human nature as wen. that a peculiar
gleam shot from his steel Â«ray eyes and
the shaggy white brows shook defiantly
at fate and the universe. "Poor but
proud." and ""ye gods, what a model!** lie
mused a* he tapped the shoulder upon
which hung a very much worn coat. "My
good man, do you want to earn an nor.'
dollar?" 4HkHBHN0 | iQHO |B 4PHffH
A gleam of humor broke over the wrin
kled visage, and he answered quickly:
"Yes. my boy; show me the way."
A hurried explanation followed about
wanting a modelâ work, good pay.
etc Then Into the palm of young ambt--.
tion, who fancied he had struck a prize
in poverty's grab bag, was thrust a card
bearing the name of the president of one
of the largest insurance companies on th<*
coast. HSHMMMI
The old gentleman quoted a popular
axiom which advises one not to Judge by

the embryo artist in a trance, from whica'
his friends upon learning his story have

STRANGE MISTAKES OF
GREAT AUTHORS.
A SMALL volume might be complied
of the anachronisms and other
slips made by great authors.
Shakespeare had a peculiar faculty for
making the impossible happen in his plays
and he scattered anachronisms with *
prodigal hand. One of his most remark
able feats Is making Desdemona, after she
has been smothered properly by the Moor,
regain her breath and enter into a rational
conversation, even inventing a generous
falsehood to shield her Jealous husband
before she finally decides to die. The Im
possibility of a "person who ha* been
smothered regaining consciousness and
speech and then dying; after having done
so scarcely needs pointing out.

Rome a thousand years before clocks were

John and his barons and transports Bo

V," speaks of a turkey cock, a bird un
known in Henry's time.
Thackeray had a most confusing man
ner of mixing up the names of his char
acters, and in the Newcomes, after killing
[.off old Lady Glenlivat and dismissing her
from the story, he brings her to life again
to help out the plot. Creasy, in his

MADGE
MORRIS
THAT Is a funny name for a big,
long-eared jack rabbit; but I was
not bo big, nor so long-eared when
the name was given to me. A man
picked me up in the grass and
gave me to a little girl for a pet, and
that is how I came to be named Fuzzy
Fluff. The first thing I remember I
opened my eyes and found myself
doubled up in a little bed under a bunch
of weeds. It was not much of a bed.
Jack rabbits do not have as nice beds us
cotton tails do. Close beside me were two
other very small rabbits. They were my
brother and sister. I noticed they were
of a dark gTay color and had a dainty
white line along the edge of each ear and
a black line above it. Such large, long,
thin ears, too. that lay flat on their
shoulders, nearly covering their backs.
They had cunning short tails with a broai,
black stripe on top of them. They had
â¢ ound, innocent dark eyes, and right
en top of each one's head was a longish
white spot. As my brother and sister
were as much alike as two peas, and each
one said that 1 looked just like the other
one, I think we must have been all alikr?.
By and by I ceased to look at my brother
and sister and l^okerl out into the world.
It was a great, fiat. wide, beautiful world,
and the wild poppies were in bloom; I
could see. too, the high mountains all
wH*e with snow.
Our mother came in and fed us her
n::!k. and one day she said we were big
enough to learn to hop, and to stand
straight up on our haunches, and throw
our long ears forward and look scared the
way our mother did. We were afraid of
most everything we saw, bo it was easy
to do. One morning she went away and
did not corr.e back; we were hungry and
wondered why she staid so long. An
other eld rabbit who was a neighbor of
r.urs came by us in the afternoon; she
was frightened nearly to death. Ehe
looked at us as she passed, and we heard
her say: "Poor little things'. Their mother
pot into the rabbit drive."
We did not know what she meant, but
if it were anything about rabbits, wo
thought we wanted to be in it too. We
grew hungrier and hungrier, and the next
morning hopped out of our bed and went
each his way to try to find something to
eat. It was a February day and the sun
6hone, but it had rained In the night and
the ground was wet and the air was
chilly. I am sure there never was a little
rabbit as hungrj- as I was. The grass
was higher than my back, but I had not
yet learned to eat grass, and I was soon
lost in It. I went on and on, and then I
in a large vineyard. I saw some Chi
namen pruning the grapevines, and a tall
white man was walking around looking
at the Chinamen. He came my way, and
I was afraid. I did not know why I was
afraid of him, but I knew I was afraid,
and I crouched down in a furrow and
thought I was hid. He picked me up and
put mÂ« In his pocket. I did not like the
motion of his walking. And. oh, I was
go hungrj'! But it waa warm, and if it
had not been for the pipe in his pocket
I would have gone to sleep. He gave me
to a little girl who came running to meet
him. Bhe danced around and around with
me and laughed, and said to the man:
"Oh, Uncle Charlie, what a cunning,
cute, fuzzy little thing it Is." She held
me up against her throat and talked baby
talk to me. She said: "O, de dacle: v,
de dacle! plttle 'lttle sing." Her hair was
long and like gold and fell over her
shoulders. I nestled to her throat and
crept under her hair nearly to the back
of her neck. She had her hands over me
all the time so I could not fall. She kept
cooing over me and calling me pretty
namec, bet she did not like me on the
back of hÂ«r neck. 60 she pulled me out
from under her pretty, gold hair and cud
dled me under her chin again. I began to
lick her throat. She laughed and cried
out:
"Cleve! This rabbit Is a Httle kitty, and
It thinks I am cream."
Then I saw there was a boy coming
toward us, and he called the little girl
"Morris," which was. I think, quite as
odd a name for a little girl as Fuzzy
Fluff Is for a Jack rabbit. The boy was
a pretty little lad, but there was a big
dog with him. and I was afraid. The dog
sniffed the air and made a leap to catch
me. I thought he had me sure. The little
girl screamed, and the little boy yelled:
"Get out, Doc; get out! You rascal,
you!" And he caught the dog by the
long hair on his neck and turned him
a "somerset." I wanted to laugh, but
was afraid he would come after me again.
The children took me to the house and
fed me warm milk; they fed it to me
with a little silver spoon. In a few
days they sat me down on the floor by a
saucer of milk and stuck my nose In it.
After that when they fed me I always
Bat on the floor and lapped it out of a
saucer. I learned from their talk that
the little boy was the son of the people
who owned the vineyard and the little
girl was his cousin who had come from
a city a long way off to visit him; and
that I belonged to the little girl, and she
was going to take me with her when
she went home. When I was older they
gave me a blade of grass to eat and
c&Ked all the family to see me nibble it.
I was fond of the children and not
afraid at all when they held me in their
hands, but the minute they turned me
loose 1 was wild again, and they would
have to run me down or get me in a
corner to catch me. I suppose it was
my nature to be wild.
When I hud been a pet rabbit for about
two weeks two other little rabbits were
brought to the house and put in my box
with me. They were named Bunny and
Fitz. Bunny belonged to the little hoy.
and Fitz, who was the youngest and
smallest of u^, was a partnership rab
bit. Then it was that they saw how I
had changed in color as I had crown
older. I arms now Â« ]i?rrit. mottled, brown
ish gray color, and the white spot on
my forehead was all gone. My eyes,
that had been all dark, were black in
the center and had a brown ring around
the black. They made a pen for us out
in the yard and put us into it to sleep.
They said wild rabbits slept out of doors
and we must sleep out of doors, too.
Poor little Fitz was not as strong as
Bunny and 1 wore, and in the morning
there he lay flat on his side. He was
cold and stiff, and I thought he was dead.
The children came to give us our break
fast, and took us around on the front
porch in the sun. They took on a great
deal over poor Frits. They rubbed his
legs and head and tried to put milk in
his mcuih. The little girl said: "His
eyes are set." She said it very sorrow
fully, and I could see there were tears
in her eves.
"It's no use," said the little boy, "he's
giving his last kick. Well make a cof
fin and bury him."
They laid him In the sun and went
away. They were gone a good while.
When they came back they had a pretty
box with a lid to it. They sat the box
on the porch and went away without
looking at me or Bunny or Fitz. I saw
them go to the big locust tree that waa
by the sifle of the road close to the
almond orchard. The almond trees were
white with blossonms. They sat down
under the locust tree and began to dig.
I knew they were digging Fitz's grave.
When they came back to the porch again
the bo;- said:
"Arrangements for the funeral are all
made."
They took off the lid of the box and
laid it on the porch, and went to get Fitr.
I laughed to myself at the sight of their
faces. There Bat Fritz in a very natural
way. and when they stooped to pick him
up he hopped off the porch, and they ran
after him and grabbed him by the hlnl
legs just as he was going under the
floor.
They laughed and screamed, and the lit
tle zM called:
"Oh. Aunt Jen! Aunt Jen! the rabbit
has come to!" â¢
The woman she called came to the door
and the boy said to her:
"Fitz disappointed us."
"Well," said she, "you are not sorry,
are you?"
He emiled a funny little smile and
said: "No; but it was a great disap
pointment."
A few days afterward I got out of thÂ«
place they had for us in the corner of the
yard and hid. The children hunted me
and called me and called me, and the lit
tle girl cried because I would not come
back. I heard the little bo^ say to her:
"Never mind, Morris; you can have my
half of Fitzsimmons."
When they gave up looking for me I
slipped out from my hiding place and ran
away. 1 had a very hard time for many
days, and sometimes I was cold and hun
gry; and I was very lonesome. But I
learned to gnaw the bark of the orchard
trees and the young vines, and to eat
wheat and do many other of the things
that make men want to kill Jackrabbits.
Once a dog took after me. I put my ears
flat down on rry shoulders and ran low
and very fastâ l ran for my life. He was
a lean, hungry-looking greyhound. â¢ Ho
was Just overtaking me; I could hear his
breathing; I could almost feel his teeth
in my body, when I tumbled heels over
head into a badger's hole, and the dog
ran right over the top of me. The badger
was not at home, and when the dog was
gone I came out into the sunshine again,
very glad to find myself a!ive.
A year passed away. I was a full-grown
Jackrabbit. I was talking one day with a
very old Jackrabbit, who was telling me
about the country where we lived. He
said it was called Fresno County, and
was the most dangerous place a Jackrab
bit could try to live In. I was just on thi
point of asking him why, when he sprang
up on his hind legs and stood his long
ears straight up; it made him look very
talL I sprang upon my hind legs and put
my ears up. too, but I could not see any
thing to be afraid of. Then I heard guns
firing away off somewhere and heard peo
ple shouting. Just then some rabbits
came loping by us; their ears were all
thrown forward and they Jumped bo high
I thought they were playing a new game.
I asked the old rabbit what the noise was
about and what the rabbits were doing.
He did not answer, and then I saw that
he was trembling all over, like one In a
chill. I looked the way his eyes were
fixed and saw a great many men and boyj
strung out in a line. They were about a
rod apart and each one had a club in hi*
handâ some of them had two clubs. A
dozen or more rcDblts came running past
us; they nearly knocked me over In their
haste.
"Follow me," said the old Jack. He
Jumped high and started directly toward
the men with the clubs. I thought he
had lost his mind. I followed the rabbits
that were running away from the men.
We ran on for two or three miles anl
were soon over our fright. A great many
rabbits were coming from behind us and
from the right and the left of us. They
came by hundreds, and it seemed to me
were all making for the same point. 1
heard the firing again and the shouting.
I ran up on a fclgh knoll and sat as high
as I could on my hind legs and looked
back. Then it was that I saw the great
est and strangest sight of my life, but
truly hope I may never see the like again.
An army of people were marching down
upon us. They came in a semicircle. It
must have been two miles long at the
least. The army was in three divisions.
First came a line of men and boys on
foot, each armed with a club; behind
them was a line of carriages and horse
men. The carriages were of every kind
I had ever seen. The people in the car
riages were mostly women and girls;
some of them were little babies. There
were men and boys and young women on
the horses. Some of the young women
wore bloomers and leggins and funny
little caps, that did not keep away the
sun, and rode prancing horses. Behind the
line of carriages came another line of men
on foot; these men marched further apart
than the others did and they carried
guns. And in front of the whole circling
army, from one end of it to the other,
THE SUNDAY CALL.
tnere were men on horseback; each one
Â«f them bad a long red, white and blue
scarf over one shoulder and tied under his
arm at the other side; the ends of tha
scarfs fluttered back on the wind as they
rode. Some of them had a paper star
pinned on their hat. They rode in a gal
lop all the time, back and forth, back and
forth, and shouted to the army until their
voices were hoarse. Their horses were
streaked with sweat and foam. They
called these men the marshals; they kept
the moving army in a circle, and each
wing of it in its place. There were more
than a thousand people In that army. It
was a grand sight. When a rabbit start
ed toward the army the men and boys in
the first row hurled their clubs at It; if
they missed It, or only broke a leg and tt
got beyond the teams, the men with the
guns shot it. And ever as they camo
nearer and nearer they closed In closer
and closer together. Soon there would
be a wall of people, beyond which no rab
bit could pass alive. I turned from look-
Ing at the advancing army and looked
down at the rabbits below me. I had not
known that there were so many rabbits
in the world. For a half-mile square
every way the ground seemed alive with
hopping, Jumping, frightened rabbits. I
saw a long open space at either side of
them, and wondered why they did not
run out and get away. But a rabbit that
came from the left wing told me there
was a wire netting stretched for a half
mile along there, and a rabbit that had
come from the right wing said it was tha
same on that side. The shouting and the
shooting and the tramping of men and
horses came nearer. The rabbits were
terrified and began to ran over each oth
er. Out of the thickest of them came 8
young rabbit I knew. We had gnawed
the same apple tree one moonlight night;
and another beautiful evening, when the
mockingbirds were singing, we had
played tag together. I thought of those
happy times when she ran up on the
knoll where I sat, and was going to speak
to her, but she did not see me at all; sho
ran straight toward the army. I called
to her, but she did not hear me. I saw
two men hurl their clubs at her. One
struck her; she bounded high in the air
and fell flat, but Jumped up and started
again. One of her hind legs was broken;
I saw It fly up and down as she Jumped.
Another club was hurled at her; she tum
bled over and lay quiveringr in the grass.
I heard the cry she gave, and knew that
was the last of her. A rabbit only make*
that cry when It knows the end of It's
life has come. A boy ran up and gave
her a blow on the head. I turned away,
sick at heart, and plunged Into the crush-
Ing multitude of rabbits. Several clubs
were burled at me, but I was too far
away.
We were crowded ahead and ran here
and there, and round and round, and ran
over each other, but always gradually
moving In the same direction. Once I
found myself on the tops of the other
rabbits' backs. I gave a sweeping glance
around and then I saw how it was. The
two lines of wire netting came together
like the corner of a square, and the ends
of the circle of the army touched the
outer ends of the square and moved slow
ly along against the fence of netting. I
saw that the army had closed in and be
come a solid wall. The first division of
the men was down walking on their
knees; their elbows touched. And the
marshals with the gay. Mattering scarfs
galloped back and forth and shouted in
front of them to keep them In place.
Many rabbits were trampled under the
horses' hoofs. ' The shouting was terrify
ing. Suddenly I felt the struggling mass
of rabbits give way. I slid :o the ground
and was forced along in the rush. I found
out that the cause of it was an opening in
the fence, Wight in the corner of the square
and the rabbits ahead had broken through
t; the others all followed. My heart
leaped with Joy as I went through the
opening in that fence. Alas! it leaped
more wildly with fear when I got beyond
it and saw what it was. It was but the
opening into a corralâ only a trapâ see the
cunningness of it? When I got into It, the
rabbits were already piled up two or three
feet deep against the fence all around the
corral; those underneath were already
smothered to death. Many of them lay
down in the corral and died with fright.
I stopped right In the middle of It. I
could feel my eyes bulging with terror.
I stood there in a kind of squatting pos
ture, every muscle quivering with fear,
and watched the people come up and look,
over the fence at us. One of the marshals
called to the men to stand back and let
the ladles look at the rabbits. After they
had looked at us a while a man called
several times for the boys to bring their
clubs and get in and kill the rabbits.
I saw them begin to come in through
the gate that had been closed behind us.
And I knew, unless a miracle should hap
pen, the end of Fuzzy Fluff had come. I
thought of the sweet little girl who had
cuddled me under her chin, of the kind
hearted little boy who kept the dog from
killing me, and wondered why I bad run
away from them.
The boys and men who came In at th*
gate had begun to kill the rabbits. Th*
fur was flying; the air was full of it- All
at once I ran toward the fence and made
a wild Jump at the top of It. I struck it
first at the top and fell back upon the pal
pitating heap of rabbits. I struggled to
my feet; I felt a hand take me and lift
me over the fence. A boy had me by the
hind legs. He carried me out through th*
crowd of people and out to where th*
wagons were. He went to a carriage that
had several people in it. He held me up
before them and said he was going to
take me home. And then I saw it was
the same little boy I had been thinking
about. And one of the ladies in the car
riage was the very same one the little
golden-haired girl had called "Aunt Jen."
She said to him, "You can't take it home,"
but he stood looking down at me and did
not move. Another said to him: "Kiftit
and take it home to the dogs."
He still stood and held me. it seemed to
me a hundred years. I hoped he would
know me as I did him and I wished I had
never run away from his home. Never
was a rabbit In such suspense. He held
me up and looked at me; I thought he
was going to knock my Drains out against
the wagon wheel. Finally he said to me:
"You look innocent; I don't t
ever ate much wheat."
Then he swung me down at a-~
at his side; my forefeet to
ground. I felt hi* fingers r' -
loosen; I felt myself sliding down ;o I
ground and then I crouched B

THE ODD STORY
OF A SPIDER
IHAVE considerable reaper Â¦ for tha
female spider, notwtthsta :nÂ» the
fact that she does not tree - the mai*
very considerately. I had â¢ 1 oppor
tunity last summer to watch a t-flre on*
that had a web in the top of a decaying
peach tree with so few leaves that it was
in plain view. I caught sight of her when
watching some birds with my glass. She
seemed to be climbing from the top of the
tree on nothing to a telephone wire some
fifteen feet away and somewhat higher
than her web. "When she reached the
wire she went around it and then back.
In studying the situation I found the web
was so located that It required a cable
to hold it up, and the spider had In some
way got one over the wire so far away.
This cable was. of course, a slender silken
thread which evidently she had thrown
out, and on account of its lightness It had
floated to the right place and became at
tached there by its glutinous properties.
It seems remarkable that it should hava
adhered to the wire firmly enough to al
low so large an insect to climb over it,
which she did every day aa lone aa X
watched her, evidently to mend or
strengthen it. The asplder must have
brains in which the ability to construct
Its web and adapt it to conditions is
highly developed. In an article in Cham
bers' Journal the following account of how
the spider forms Its silken threads ta
given:
"One of the most interesting features
in the economy of spiders is their power
of emitting slender threads of a silk-like
substance called gossamer, with which
most of them construct mesh-Ilk* nets,
and a few long, dangling cables, by which
they are buoyed through the air with
nearly as much facility as though they
had been furnished with wings. Th* ap
paratus provided by nature for elaborat
ing and emitting this gossamer la a beau
tiful piece of mechanism.
"Within the animal there are several
little bags or vesicles of a gummy mat
ter, and these vesicles are connected
with a circular oriflc* situated la tha ab
domen. Within this oriflc* are five little
teats or spinnerets, through which the
gossamer la drawn. It must not be con
cluded, however, that there Is only on*
film of gossamer produced by each spin
neret: the fact Is these teats are stud
ded with thousands of minute tubes to*
small for the naked eye to perceive, and
each of these emits a thread of Incon
ceivable fineness. These minute tubes are
known as spinnerulea and tha films which
proceed from them unit* Ilk* so many
strands of rope to form the thread of gos
samer by which a spider suspends itself.
The finest thread which human mechan
ism can produce la like a ship's cable com
pared with the delicate films which flow
from the spinnerules of the largest spider.
The Situs are all distinctly separate on
coming from the spinneret, but unite, not
by any twisting process, but merely by
their own glutinous or gummy nature.
Thus the spinning apparatus of th* dis
dained spider, when viewed by the ey*
of science, becomes one of the most won
derful pieces of animated mechanism
known to man. The Insect has great
command over this apparatus and can
apply it at will as Ions; as the receptacles
within are replenished with the gummy
fluid, but as soon aa this gum Is exhausted
all its efforts to spin are fruitless and It
must wait until nature, by her Inscrutable
chemistry, has secreted it from the food
which Is devoured."â Phrenological Jour

CHAPTER Vlllâ Continued.
THE ABDUCTION OF A PRINCESS.
1WO? There arc at least ten of
' them."*
"'You foe!! The three guards are
disposed of in advance, two of the
Viennese arc left with the horses,
two are chucked < ft" under the Princess'
window. and one stands at the gate. We
can slug the mar. at the gate, the fellows
under the window are harmless, and that
leaves but our two friends find the cook.
Â¦\\\ have every advantage in the world.
< >. n't you see?"
"You are right! Come on! I'll risk it
with you. We will save the Princess of
Graustark!"
â¢'Dent you see it will be just as easy
for us to enter the castle as for these rob
bers? The way will be clear, and will be
kept clear. Jove. man. v.c need not be
more than thirty" seconds behind them.
Is your pistol all right?" Â»
By this time t^e two men were speeding
along the grassy patch toward the road
that ran beside the wall. They looked to
their pistols and placed them carefully in
outside coat pockets.
"We must throw away these heavy
canes." whispered the painter to his
friend, who was a pace or so ahead.
"Keep them! We'll need one of them to
crack that fellow's head at the gate.
"Gad. It's dark along here!"
"How the devil are we to know where
to go?"
"We'll step when we come to The gate
where we climbed up UÂ»e wall to-day.
That is the only entrance I saw along
the west wall and it is near the castle.
Just as soon as the gang enters that pate
we'll crawl up and get rid of the fellow
who stands watch." -
It was 'so dark that they could barely
fee the roadway, and they found it neces
sary to cease talking as they slunk along
beside the fall. Occasionally they paused
to listen, fearing that they might draw
too close upon the men who had gone be
fore. At last they came to a big ; gate
ard halted.
"Is this the gate?" whispered Anguish.
"Sh! Yes, I'm quite sure. We are un
doubtedly near the castle, judging by the
distance we have come. Let us cross the
road and lie directly opposite. Be care
ful!"
Like panthers they stole across the road
and down a short, grassy embankment.
At Anguish's suggestion Lorry wrapped
his handkerchief tightly about the heavy
end of his cane, preparing in that way to
deaden the sound of the blow tliat was
to fall upon the Vienna man's head. Then
they threw aside their hats, buttoned
their coats tightly and sank down to wait,
with bounding hearts and tingling nerves,
the arrival of the abductors, mutely pray
ing that they were at the right gate.
IX-THE EXPLOIT OF LORRY AND
ANGUISH.
During the half hour spent in the
grassy ditch or gutter, they spoke not
more than half a dozen times and In the
faintest of -whispers. They could hear
ihe guard pacing the driveway Inside the
ronderous gate, but aside from his foot
steps ro sound was distinguishable. A
F?nse of oppression came over the two
watchers as the minutes grew longer and
more deathlike in their stillness. Kach
found himself wondering why the leaves
did not stir in the trees, why there were
no night birds, no crickets, no croaking
frogs, no sign of life save that steady,
clocklike tread inside the wall. So dark
was it that the wall itself was but a
deeper shadow against the almost opaque
blackness beyond. No night, it seemed to
them, had ever been so dark, so still.
After the oppres w on came the strnnge
feeling of dread, the result of an en
forced contemplation of the affair in
which they were to take a hand, ignorant
of everything except the general plan.
They knew nothing of the surround
ings. If they failed, there was the danger
of being shot by the guards before an ex
planation could be made. If they suc
ceeded, it must be through sheer good
fortune and not through prowess of mind
or muscle. Once inside the castle, how
could they hope to follow the abductors
at a safe distance and still avoid the
danger of being lost or of running Into
trusty guards? The longer they lay there
the more hazardous became the part
they had so recklessly ventured to play.
In the heart of each there surged a
growing desire to abandon the plan, yet
neither could bring himself to the point
of proposing the retreat from the inspired
undertaking. Both knew the sensible, ju
dicious act would be to alarm the guards
and thus avoid all possible chance of a
fiasco. With misgivings and doubts in
their hearts the two self-appointed
cuardlans of the Princess lay there upon
the grass, afraid to give up the project
yet fearln* the outcome.
"The dickens will be to pay, Lorry If
they dispose of this guard on the inside
and lock the gate. Then how are we to
follow?" whispered Anguish.
Lorry was thoughtful for a while. He
felt the chill of discourag-ement In IBs
heart.
"In that caM we must He outside and
wait till they come out with the Princess.
Then make a sudden assault and rescue
her. In the darkness we can make them
think there are a dozen rescuers," he
whispered at length. After a while An
guish asked another appalliÃg question,
the outgrowth of brain-racking study:
"Suppose these fellows, who will be m
guards' uniforms, should turn about and
rapture us. What then? We are
strangers, and our story would not be be
lieved. They could slip away In the ex
citement and leave us in a very awkward
position."
'â¢Harry, if we are going to hatch up all
sorts of possibilities, let's give up tne
thing right now. I have thought of a
thousand contingencies, and I realize how
desperate the job is to be. We must either
cast discretion to the winds or we must
retreat. Which shall we do?"
"Cast aside discretion and hang our
fears," said the other, once more inspired.
"Weil take chances and hope for the
best. It we see we are going to fail we
can then call for the guards. The grounds
are doubtless full of soldiers. The only
part I'm worried about is the groping
through that strange, dark castle."
"We must do some calculating, and wo
must stick close together. By watching
where they station the two Viennese we
G. B. McCUTCHEON
can figure about what direction we must
take to get to the Princess" room. Sh!
Isn't that some one approaching?"
They strained their ears for a moment
and then involuntarily. spasmodically
shook hands, each heaving the deep
breath of excitement. The stealthy rustle
of moving bodies was heard, faint, but
positive. It was a moment of suspense
that would have strained the nerve of a
stone image. Where were the abductors?
On which side of the road, and from what
direction did they come? Oh, for the eyes
of a cat!
There was a slight shuffling of feet near
the gate, a suppressed "Sh!" and then
deathly silence. The gate opened, a faint
creaking attesting the fact, followed by
the heavy breathing of men, the noise of
6ujjdued activity, the scent of chloroform.
Some whispering, and then the creaking
of the gate.
"They've gbne," whispered Anguish.
Lorry's form arose to a crouching p ,s- t
ture, and a moment later he was cross
ing the road v.-ith the tread of a cat,
his can gripped firmly in his hand.
Anguish followed with drawn re
volver. So still was their approach that
they were upon the figure of a man before
they were aware of the fact. In the dark
lie foremost American saw the out
line of a human figure bending over a
long object on the ground. He could
smell chloroform strongly and grasped
the situation. The Viennese was admin
istering the drug, his companions having
left that duty for him to perform. No
doubt the treacherous guardsman was ly
ing calmly on his buck, bound and gagged,
welcoming unconsciousness with a smile
of security.
As *oon as Lorry gained his bearings
fully he prepared to fell the wretch who
was to stand watch. Anguish heard his
friend's ligure suddenly .bhoot to an erect
position. A whirring sound as of dis
turbed air and then a dull thud. Some
thing rolled over on the groHtid and all
was still. He was at Lorry's side in an
instant.
"I hope I haven't. killed him. " whispered
Lorry. "Quick! Here is his bottle of
ether. Hold it beneath his nose. I am
going to pile the body of this guard cross
wise on top of him. He will not be able
\o rise if he should recover conscious-
DOK."
All this was dene in a moment's time
and the two trackers were headed for the
entrance. The pa'e WHS aiar two or three
feet. With turbulent hearts they stole
through. â¢
"Keep clo.-e alons the wall." whispered
Lorry, "and trust to luck. The cattle i
to the left."
Without hesitation thry crept over the
noiseless grass, close be^cle the wall. Di
rectly they heard sounds near at hand.
The abductors were binding and chloro
forming the guard at the arbor. After
waiting for some nioments they heard the
party gli^e away in the darkness and fol
lowed. The body of the guard was lyin<r
just outside the mouth of the arbor and
the odor of chloroform was almost over
powering. Once inside the long arbor, the
Americans moved slowly and with greater
caution. There was a dim light in a base
ment window ahead. Toward the front
of the castle and En the second story a
faint glow came from another window.
They guessed it to be from the Princess"
room or from that of the Countess.
At last they saw four figures steal past
the dim basement !i?ht. One of them
halted near the window and three crept
away in the darkric-s. Presently one f f
them returned and all activity was nt
an end for the time being. How near it
was to 2 o'clock the watchers could not
tell. They only knew that they were
within twenty- five feet of Geddos aivl
Ostrom, and that they would not have
long to wait.
Soon a bright little blaze of light erossei
the basement c-pening. Then it returntil
crossin? n second time, and a third. AM
was still again. The soft shuffle of a foot,
the rustle of arbor vines, and the form
of a man crawled up to the window. With
inconceivable stealth and carefulness it
glided through the aperture, followed by
his companion.
Lorry and* Anguish were at the opening
a second or two later, lying flat on their
stomachs and listening for sounds from
within. The dim light was still there, tÂ»i c
window was open and there was a sound
of whispering. Lorry raised his head and
peered through, taking calculations while
the light made it possible. He saw an
open door on the opposite side of the low
room, with steps beyond, leading upward.
Between the window and the door there
were no obstacles. Up those steps he
saw three men creep, the leader carrying
the dim light. The door v/as left open,
doubtless to afford unimpeded exit from
the building in case of emergency. Harry
Anguish touched Lorry's arm.
"I took the tv.-o pistols from that Vien- -
na man out there. We may need them.
Here is one for yourself. Go first, Lorry,"
he whispered.
Lorry stuck the revolver in his coat
pocket and gently slid through the win
dow to the floor below. His friend fol
lowed, and they paused to listen. Taking
Anguish by thy; hand the other led the
way straight to the spot where he remem
bered seeing the door.
Boldly the two men began the breath
less ascent of the stone steps. The top
was reached, and far ahead down a nar
row hall they saw the three men and the
dim light moving. Two of them wore
uniforms of guards. Keeping close to the
wall their followers crept after them. Up
another flight of steps they went, and
then through a spacious hall. The Amer
icans had no time and no desire to inspect
their surroundings. The wide doors at
the far side of the room opened softly,
and here the t^io paused. Down a great
marble hallway a dim red light shed its
soft glow. It came from the lamp at the
foot of the broad staircase.
The cook pointed to the steps and then
gave his thumb a jerk toward the left.
Without the least sign of fear Ged
dos and Ostrom glided into the hall and
made for the staircase. The watchers
could not but feel a thrill of admira
tion for those daring wretches. But now a
new danger confronted them. The cook
remained standing In the doorway watch
ing his fellows in crime! How were they
to pass him?
There was no time to be lost. The ab
ductors were creeping up the steps al
leady, and the cook must be disposed of.
He had blown out the light which he
carried, and was now a very dim shadow.
Lorry glided forward and in an instant
stood before the amazed fellow, jamming
a pistol into his face. /
"A sound and you die! he hissed.
"Don't move!" came another whisper,
and a second revolver touched his ear.
The cook, perhaps, did not know their â¢
language, but he certainly understood its
meaning. He trembled, and would have
fallen to the floor had not the strong
hand of Lorry pinned him to the wail.
The hand was on his throat, too.
"Chloroform him, Harry, and don't let
him make a sound," whispered the own
er of the hand. Anguish's twitching fin
gers succeeded those of his friend on the
cook's throat, his pistol was returned to
his pocket, and the little bottle came
again into use.
"I'll go ahead. Follow me as soon as
you have finished this fellow. Be care
ful and turn to the left when you come
to the top."
Lorry was off across the marble floor,
headed for the stairway, and Anguish
was left In charge of the cook, of whom
he was to make short work. Now came
ihe desperate, uncertain part of the tran
saction. Suppose he were to meet the
two conspirators at the head of the stairs
'or in the hall, or that the other traitor,
Dannox, should appear to frustrate all.
It was the most trying moment in the
whole life of the reckless Lorry.
When near the top of the steps he
hugged the high balustrade and cautious
ly peered ahead. He found himself look
ing down a long hall, at the far end of
which, to his right, a dim light was burn
ing. There was no sound and there was
no sign of the two men, either to the
right or to the left. His heart felt like
lead! They evidently had entered the
Princess's room! How was he to find
that room? Slowly he wriggled across
the broad, dark hall, straightening up in
the shadow of a great post. From this
point he edged along the wall for a dis
tance of ten or twelve feet to the left.
A sound came from farther down the
lia.ll. and he imagined he heard some one
approaching.
His hand came In contact with a heavy
hanging or tacestrv. and he atifeETv
He heard the Princess wail: "Dannox! Do not strike again!
You have killed him!"
squirmed behind its folds, finding
himself against a door which moved
as his body touched it. *"He felt
it swinging open slightly and drew
back, intending to return to the hall,
uncertain and very much undecided as to^
the course to pursue. His revolver was in
his hand. Just as he was about to pull
aside the curtain a man glided past,
quickly followed by another. Providence
had kept him from running squarely into
them. They were going toward the left
and he realized that they were now ap
proaching the Princess' room. How he
came to be ahead of them he could not
imagine. Strange trembling seized his
legs, so great was the relief after the
narrow escape. Again he felt the door
move slightly as he pressed against it.
The necessity for a partial recovery 6% his
composure before the next and most im
portant step impelled him softly to enter
the room for an instant's breath.
Holding to the door he stood inside and
drew himself to his full height, taking
a long and tremulous breath. There was
no light in the room, but through the
door crack to his left came a dim, broad
streak. He now knew where he was.
This room was next to that in which the
Princess slept, for had he not seen the
light from her window? Perhaps he was
now in the room of the Countess Dagmar.
Next door! Next door! Even now the
daring Geddos and Ostrom were crawling
toward the bed of the ruler of Graustark,
not twenty feet away. His first Impulse
was to cross and open the door leading to
the next room* surmising that it would
be unlocked, but he remembered Anguish,
who was doubtless, by this time, stealing
up the stairs. They must not be sepa
rated, for it would require two steady,
cool heads to deal with the villains. It
was not one man's work. As he turned to
leave the room he thought how wonder
fully well they had succeeded in the deli
cate enterprise so far.
His knees struck the door and there was
a dull thump, not loud in reality, but like
the report of a gun to him. A sudden
rustle In the darkness of the room and
then a sleepy voice, soft and quick, as
of a woman awakening with a start.
"Who Is it?"
His heart ceased beating, his body grew
stiff and immovable. Again the voice, a
touch of alarm in it now:
"Is that you, Dannox?"
She spoke in German and the voice came
from somewhere in front and to his right.
He could not answer, could not move.
The paralysis of indecision was upon him.
"How is it thnt the outer door is open?"
This time there was something like a
reprimand in the tones, still low. He al
most could see the wide-open, searching
eyes.
X.â YETIVE.
There could be no further hesitation.
Something must be done and instantly.
He gently closed the door before an
swering the third question. In his ner
vousness be spoke in English, advancing;
to the middle of the room. Impossible to
see the woman to whom he hissed thin
alarming threatâ he could only speculate
as to its effect:
"If you utter a sound, madam, I shall
kill you. Be calm, and allow me to ex
plain my presence here!"

THE SUNDAY CALL.
that she might not understand his words.
Instead there was a deathly silence. Had
she swooned? His heart was leaping with
hope. But she spoke softly again, tremu
lously, and in English: \ *
"You will find my jewels on the dress
ing table. Take them and go. You will
not hurt me?" ,-â¢.:. . / '
. "I am not here to do you Injury .""but to
serve your Princess," said the man. "For
God's sake, do not make an outcry. - You
will ruin everything. Will you let me ex
plain?" ~ v Â ;;* ~
"Go! Go! Take anything. Â¦ I can be
calm no longer. Oh, how can- I expect
mercy at your hands!" Her tones were
I rising to a wail :of - terror.' . ' ' , ,
*' "Sh! Do you want to die?", he. hissed,
: striding to the canopy bed, discernible as
â¢his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness.
"I .will kill you if you utter J a sound, so
help me God!" , ' : -
"Oh!" she moaned. ' 'Â¦'<Â¦'
"Listen! You must aid me! Do you
â¢hour?" " Â¦ â¢Â¦' Â¦Â¦ , - .
Another heart-breaking moan. "I am
here to save the Princess. There is a
plot to abduct her to-night. Already there
are men in the castle, perhaps in her
room. You must tell me where she sleeps.
There is no time to be lost. I am no thief,
before God! I am telling you the truth.
Do not be alarmed. I implore you. Trust
me, madam, and you will not regret it.
Where does the Princess sleep?" He
jerked out these eager, pleading words
quickly, breathlessly.
"How am I to trust you?" came back
a whisper from the bed.
"Here is a revolver! Take it and kill
me if I attempt the slightest injury.
Where are you? " He felt along the bed
with his hand.
"Keep vvay! Please! Please!" she
sobbed.
"Take the pistol! Cc calm, and In
heaven's name help me to save her. Those
wretches may have killed her already!"
The revolver dropped upon the clothes.
He was bending eagerly over, holding the
curtains back.
"My friend Is in. the hall. We have
traced the men to the Princess' door, I
think. My God, be quick! Do you wish
to see her stolen from under your eyes?"
"You are now in the Princess' room,"
answered the voice from the bed, calmer
and with some alacrity. "Is this true that
you tell me?"
"As God is my witness! And youâ youâ
are the Princess?" gasped the man,
drawing back.
"I am. Where is Dannox?" She was
sitting bolt upright in the bed, the pistol
in her trembling fingers.
"He is one of the consipartors. One of
the cooks and two other guards are In the
plot. Can you trust me enough to leave
your bed and hide in another part of the
room? The scoundrels have mistaken the
door, but they may be here at any mo
ment. You must be quick! I will pro
tect youâ l swear it! Come, your High
ness! Hide!"
Something in the fierce, anxious whisper
gave her confidence. The miracle had
been wrought! He had composed this
woman under the most trying circum
stances that could have been imagined.
She slipped from the bed and threw a
long, loose silken gown about her.
"Who are you?" she asked, touching
his arm.
"I am a foreignerâ an AmericanâGren
fall Lorry! Hurry!" he implored.
She did not move for a moment, but
he distinctly heard her catch her breath.
"Am I dreaming?" she murmured, faint
ly. Her fingers now clutched his arm
tightly
"I should say not! I don't like to or
der you around, your i-Ighness, but "
Â¦ "Comeâ come to the light!" she inter
rupted, excitedly. "Over here!"
Noiselessly she drew him across the
room until the light fell across his face.
It was not a bright light, but what she
saw satisfied her. He could not see her
face, for she stood outside the strip of
dusky yellow.
"Two men lie beneath your window, and
two are coming to this room. Where shall
I go? Come, be quick, madam! Do you
want to be carted off to Ganlook? Then
don't stand there like aâ like aâ beg par
don, 1 wont say itf*
"I trust you fully. Shall I alarm the
guard?" she whispered, recovering her
self-possession.
"By no means! I want to catch those
devils myself. Afterward we can alarm
the guards!"
"An ideal American!" she surprised
him by saying. "Follow me!"
She lfd him to the doorway. "Stand
here, and I will call the Countess. At
this side, v.'here it is dark."
She opened the door gently and stood in
the light for a second. He saw before
him a graceful figure in trailing white,
and then he saw her face. She was Miss
Guggenslocker!
"My God!" he hoarsely gapped. Stagger
ing toward her. "You! You! The Prin
>sess?"
"Ye?, I am the Princess." she whis
pered, smiling as she glided away from
his side. His eyes went round in his head,
his lags seemed to be anywhere but be
neath him, he felt as though he were
rushing toward tfce ceiling. For the m. -
ment he was actually unconscious. Then
his senses ru'hed back, recalling his mi.s
sion and his clanger.
"She is sleeping so soundly that I fear
to awaken her," whispered a soft voice
at his back, and he whirled. The Princess
was standing in the doorway.
"Then pray stand back where you will
be out of danger. They will be here in a
moment, unless they have been frightened
away."
"You shall not expose yourself," she
said, positively. "Why should you risk
your life now? You have accomplished
your object. You have saved the Prin
cess!"
"Ahâ yes, the Princess!" he said. "And
I am sorry you are the Princess," he add
ed, in her ear.
"Sh!" she whispered, softly.
The door through which he had first
come was softly oDened, and they were
conscious that some one was entering.
Lorry and the Princess stood in the dark
shadow of a curtain, she close behind his
stalwart figure. He could hear his own
heart and hers beating, could feel the
warmth of her body, although it did not
touch his. His heart beat with the pride
of possession, of power, with the knowl
edge that he had but to stretch out his
hand and touch the one woman In all
the world.
Across the dim belt of light from the
open doorway in which they stood crawled
the dark figure of a man. Her hand un
consciously touched his back as If seeking
reassurance. He shivered beneath Its
gentle weight. Another form followed the
first, pausing in the light to look toward
their doorway. The abductor was doubt
less remembering the Instructions to
chloroform the Countess. Then came the
odor of chloroform. Oh, if Anguish rzere
only there!
The second figure was lost in the dark
ness and a faint glow of light came from
the canopied bed in the corner. The chlo
roformer holding the curtains had turned
his screen-lantern toward the pillow in
order to apply the dampened cloth. Now
was the time to act!
Pushing the Princess behind the curtain
and In the shelter of the doorpost. Lorry
leaped toward the center of the room, a
pistol in each hand. Before him crouched
the astonished desperadoes.
"If you move you are dead men!" said
he, in slow decided tones. "Here, Harry!"
he shouted. "Scoundrels, you are trapped!
Throw up your hands!"
Suddenly the room was a blaze of light:
flashing candles, lamps, sprung into life
from the walls, while a great chandelier
above his head dazzled him with Its unex
pected glare.
"Hell!" he shouted, half throwing his
hands to his ej - es.
Something rushed upon him from be
hind: there was a scream and then a
stinging blow acrcss the head and neck.
As he sank helplessly, angrily, to his
knees he heard the Princess wail:
"Dannox! Do not strike again! You
have killed him!"
As he rolled to the floor he saw the
two forms near the bed moving about
like shadows; two red objects that re
sembled dancing telegraph poles leaped
past him from he knew not where, and
then there was a shout, the report of a
pistol, a horrid yell. Something heavy
crashed down beside him and writhed.
His eyes were closing:, his senses were
going, he was numb and sleepy. Away
off in the distance he heard Harry An
guish crying:'-" "
"That settles you. damn you!"
Some one lifted his head from the car
pet and a woman's voice was crying some
thing unintelligible. He was conscious of
an effort on his part to prevent the blood
from streaming over her gownâ a last bit
of gallantry. The sound of rushing feet,
shouts, firearms â oblivion! m -
When Lorry refrained consciousness he
blinked in abject amazement. There was
a dull, whirring sound in his ears and his
eyes had a glaze over them that was slow
in wearing off. There were persons in the
room. Ke could see them moving about
and could hear them talking. As his eyes
tried to take in the strange surroundings
a hand was lifted from his forehead and a
soft, ur?am-like voice said:
"He is recovering. Mr. Anguish. See.
his eyes are open! Do you know me, Mr.
l^crry?" >â¢'.Â¦â¢ ,
The unsteady eyes wandered until they
fell upon the face near his pillow. A
brighter gleam came into them and there
was a" ray of returning Intelligence. He
tried to speak but could only move his
lips. As he remembered her, she was in
white, and he was puzzled now to see her
â¢ in a garment of some dark material, sug
gestive of the 'night or the green of a
shady hillside- There was the odor of
roses and violets and carnations. Then
he looked for the fatal, fearful, glaring
chandelier, li was gone. The room was
becoming lighter and lighter as his eyes
grew stronger, but it wa3 through a
window near where he lay. , So it was
daylight. Where was he?
"How do you feel, old man?" asked a
familiar voice. A man sat down beside
him on the couch or bed and a big baud
grasped his own. Still be could not
answer.
"Doctor," cried the voice near his head,
"you really think it is not serious?"
"I am quite sure." answered a man's
~ voice from somewhere out in the light.
"It is a bad cut. and, he is just recover
ing from the effect of the other. Had the
blow not been a glancing one his skull
would have been crushed. lie will be per
fectly conscious in a short time. There
is no concussion, your Highness."
"I am so happy to hear you say that,"
said the soft voice. Lorry's eyes sought
hers and thanked her. A lump came into
his threat as he looked up into ,the ten
der, anxious blue eyes. A thrill came
over him. Princess or not, he loved her
âhe loved her! "You were very braveâ
oh, so brave!" she whispered in his ear,
her hand touching his hair caressingly.
'My American!"
He tried to reach the hand before it
faded, but he was too weak. She glided
away, and he closed his eyes again as if
in pain.
"Look up, old man: you're all right,"
said Anguish. "Smell this handkerchief.
It will make you feel better." A moist
cloth was held beneath his nose, and "a
strong, pungent odor darted through his
nostrils. In . a moment he tried to raise
himself to his elbow. The world was
clearing up.
"Lie still a bit, Lorry. Don't be too
hasty. The doctor says you must not."
/'Where am I. Harry?" asked the
wounded ; man, weakly. Â:. i
"In the. castle. I'll tell you all about it
presently." V r "' "-. *
* "Am I in her room?"
"No, but \ she is in yours. You are
across the hall in"â he whisperedâ
'â¢Uncle Caspar's room. Caspar is a
Count."
"And she is the Princessâ truly?"
"What luck!"
"What miseryâ what misery!" half
moaned the other.
"Bosh! Be.a man! Don't talk so loud,
either! There are a t half-dozen in the
room." /Â¦ââ¢ â¢
Lorry remained perfectly quiet for ten
minutes, his staring eyes fixed on the
celling. He was thinking of the abyss
he had reached and could not cross.
"What time Is it?" he asked at last,
turning his eyes toward his friend.
- "It's just 7 o'clock. You have been un
conscious or under the influence of ether
for over four hours. That guard hit you
a fearful crack."
"I heard a shotâ a lot of them. "Was any
one killed? Did those fellows escape?"
"Killed! There have been eight execu
tions besides the one I attended to. Lord,
they don't wait long here before handing
out justice."
"Tell me all that happened. Was she
hurt?" '
."I should say not! Say, Gren. I have
killed a man. Dannox got my bullet right
in the head and he never knew what hit
him. Ghastly, isn't it? I feel beastly
queer. It was he who turned on the
lights and went at you with a club. I
heard you call, and was in the door just
as he hit you. His finish came inside of
a second. You and he spoiled the hand
somest rug I ever saw." ; : '. ,
"Ruined it?"
"Not in her estimation. I'll wager she
has it framed, blood and all. The stains
will always be there as a reminder of
your bravery, and that's what she says
Â¦he's bound to keep. She was very much
excited and alarmed about you until the
room filled with men and then she re
membered how she was attired. I never
caw anything so pretty as her embarrass
ment when the Countess and her aunt led
her into the next room. These people are
going out, so I'll tell you what happened
after you left me with the cook. He was
a lone time falling under the influence,
and I had barely reached the top of thÂ«
stairs when I saw Dannox rush down the
hall. Then you called, and I knew the
Jlk was on. in full blast. The door was
open, and I saw him strike you. I shot
him, but she was at your side before I
could get to you. The other fellows who
were in the room succeeded in escaping
while I was bending over you, but neither
of them shot at me. They were too badly
frightened. I had, sense enough left to
follow and shoot a couple of times as
they tore down, the stairs. One of them
stumbled and rolled all the way to the
bottom. He was unconscious and bleed
insr when I reached his side. The other
fellow flew toward the dining hall, where
he was nabbed iby two white uniformed
men and throttled. - Other men In whiteâ
they were regular police officersâ pounced
upon me, and 1 was a prisoner. By
George. I was knocked off my feet the
next minute to see old Dangloss himself
come puffing and blowing into the hail
redder and fiercer than ever. 'Now I
know what you want In Edelweiss!* he
shrieked, and it took me three minutes
to convince him of his error. Then he
and some of the men went up to the
Princess' room, while I quickly led the
way to the big gate and directed a half
dozen . officers toward the ravine By
this time the grounds were alive
with guards. They came up finally
with the two fellows who had been " sta
tioned beneath the window, and who were
unable to find the gate. When I got back
to where you were the room was full of
terrified men and women.' half dressed I
was still dazed over the sudden appear
ance of , the police, but - managed to tell
my story in . full to Dangles ; and Count
Halfont-that's Uncle Caspar-and then
the chief told me how he and his men
happened to be there.". In . the meantime
the castle physician was attending to you'
Dannox ; had been carried away. .^l- never
talked _to . a- ; more \ interested audienc*
in my life! There was the Princess
at my e!bow and the Countessâ pretty as
a picture â back of her, all eyes, both of
'em; and there was the old gray-haired
lady, the Countess Halfont, and a half
dozen shivering maids, with men galore.
Dangloss and the Count and a lot of ser
vants â a great and Increasing crowd. The
captain of the guards, a young fellow
named Quinnox. aÂ» I heard him called,
came in. worried and humiliated I fancy
he was afraid he'd lose his job. You see.
It was this way: Old Danglos* has had
a man watching us all day. Think of It!
Shadowing us like a couple of thieves.
This fellow traced us to the castle gate,
and then ran back for reinforcements,
confident that we were there to rob. In
twenty minutes he had a squad of officers
at the gate, the chief trailing along be
hind. They found the pile of tools we had
left there, and later the other chap in
the arbor. A couple oi guard 9 cam*
charging up to karn the cause of the com
motion, and the whole crew sailed into
the castle, arriving just in time. Well,
Just aa soon as I told them the full story
of the plot, old Caspar, the chief and the
captain held a short consultation, the re
sult of v.'liUh I can tell in mighty few
words. At t> o'clock they took the whole
gang of prisoners down in the ravine ami
shot tflem. The mounted guards are still
looking for the two Viennese who left
with the carriage. They escaped. About
an hour after yon were hurt you were
tarried over here aai laid on this couc.i.
I want to tell you. Mr. Lorry, you I
must interesting object that ever found
it* way into a royal household. They have
been hanging over you as if you were a
new-born baby, and everybody's charmed
because you are a boy and are going m
live. As an adventure this* has been a
record-breaker, my son! We are cocks of
the walk!"
Lorry was smiling faintly over his en
thusiasm.
"You are the real hero, Harry. Yin
saved my life and probably yours. I"l
not allow you or anybody to give me a
bit of thf glory." he said, pressing the
other's hand.
"O. that's ron?ense! Anybody couiil
have rushed in as I did I was only cap
ping the climax you had prepaidâmere
ly a timely arrival, as the novels say.
There is a little of the credit due me, of
course, and I'll take it gracefully but I
only come in -it an accessory, t ort r>f
bushwhacker who had only to do the
shoot, slap-bang work and close the act.
You did the hero's work. But what do
you think of the way they hand out jus
tice over here? All but two of 'em
dead ."
"Whose plan was it to kill those men*'
cried Lorry, suddenly 3itting upright.
'Â¦Everybody's, I fancy. They didn't
consult me, though, come to think of it.
Ah, here Is her Highness!"
The Princess and Aunt Yvonne were at
his side again, while Count Caspar was
coming rapidly toward them.
"You must not sit up. Mr. Lorry," be
gan the Princes, but he was crying:
"Did they make a confession, Harry 0 "
"I don't know. Did they, Uncâ Count
Halfont? Did they confess? Great heav
ens. I never thought of that before."
"What was there to confess?" asked
the Count, tailing Lorry's hand kindly.
"They were caught in the act. My dear
sir. they were not even tried."
"I thought your Police Chief was sucn
a shrewd man, " cried Lorry, angrily.
"What's that?" asked a gruff voice. anl
Baron Dangloss was a member of tha
party, red and panting.
"Don't you know you should not have
killed those men?" demanded Lorry.
They surveyed him in amazement, except
Anguish, who had buried his face in tils
hands dejectedly.
"And. sir, I'd like to know why not?"
blustered* Dangloss.
"And. sir, I'd like to know, since yoa
have shot the only beings on earth who
knew the man that hired them, how in
the name of your alleged justice you ars
going to apprehend him?" said Lorry,
sinking back to his pillow, exhausted.
No reserve could hide the consterna
tion, embarrassment and shame that over
whelmed a very worthy but very impet
uous nobleman. Baron Jasto Dangloss,
Chief of Police in Edelweiss. He could
only sputter his excuses and withdraw,
swearing to catch the arch-conspiratoc
or to die in the attempt.

"Why should they seek to abduct me?

Is It a conspiracy to force me from the

THE most curious of Interesting
telephone office In the world, the
Chinese Exchange of the Pacific
I States and Sunset Telephone Com
pany, has moved into new and more
gorgeously Oriental quarters. If you are
In the heart of Chinatown watch for a
big blue and cold sign and above it a
hanging balcony bravely decked with
palms and lanterns, and ablaze with color
and gilding. . ;
It is a bit of color that Is not American,
but above it all wave the Stars and
Stripes. Go between the big brass signs
cf the entrance, climb Into the dusky at
mosphere of the newly painted stairway,
pass through a doorway of glass and gild
ed scroll work, and you are as far away
from the ordinary American telephone
station as you can Imagine. .
No dull orthodox office interior greets
the eye. no counter with a girl behind it.
no glass panels with seemingly miles of
girls and switchboards in the vista be
yond. Instead there is a big roomful of
color and gilding, of sandalwood chairs
and embroideries. ' :
In the midst of this the prosaic switch
board along, one - side of the room with
the great golden dragon emblazoned above
St. makes but little impression. The
American visitor looks for the "Hello
girl." but he does not find her, for they
are all "Hello boys" .in , this queer ex
change. There is probably no other tele
phone exchange in the world where boys
and men are used exclusively as opera
tors. * â¢
This very fact explains why this branch
office was made necessary In the midst of
Chinatown. The list of Chinese subscrib
ers to the telephone company has grown
so rapidly that the telephone girls of thÂ»
city found that the various tonsues and
dialects . employed were more than they
could handle understanding^. So the
Chinese branch began at 754 Washington
street with ore wa' telephone only, In
November of MR. About six years later
it was removed to the southwest corner
,ot Dupont and Washington streets. The
quarters there was in a dingy second
floor room, like a wedge shaped narrow
sUce cut off from the front of the dirty
yellow building. There was not much
more than room for the long switchboard,
the two lone distance booths, and the
busy almond eyed operators. Yet the at
mosphere there was a distinctly Oriental
one also. In the past year or so business
has increased to such a volume that the
larger and much more convenient quarters
cow occupied at 743 Washington street be
came an absolute necessity. Here all the
Chinese telephone business of the town
Is handled, there being 260 subscribers now
on the list and 100 more expected at once
as. the result of the larger accommoda
tions. These subscribers pay $250 per
month straight, Â¦ all switches outside of
Chinatown being 5 cents extra. It will
probably not be long before there will be
a list of 500 subscribers doing business
through this exchange.
The manager of the telephone system iÂ»
Loo Kun; Shu, an exceedingly affable
and intelligent Chinese gentleman, who
looks \rry grar.d in his stiff silk robes of
crimson and blue when taking tea with
some swell visitor. He J has six operators,
all Chinese men or boys. Little, thin.
pleasant faced Ching Soy Sing is the
chief operator, and then come the "hello
boys." They are Albert Bue, Bing Gay,
Chin Li. Ching Sing and "Wie Park. Three
operators are on during the day and thre^
during the evening, while one remains all
night. Not tr.? least important of the
business of the establishment is done by
little 11-year-old Yick Chun, the Celestial
messenger boy. He knows Chinatown
like a book, and many and varied are the
messages he has to take and the places he
has to visit. Often he, too, may be found
at the switchboard, a coronet of steel on
his head and a black receiver over one
ear, for he can "operate" with the best of
them.
One of the most interesting characters
among the "hello boys" is Bing Gay, the
dwarf of 20 y?ars, very dexterous in his
handling of the "jacks" or plugs cf tho
B;boards. with their numbers ranging
from "China 00" to "China 299." He is
bright, having reached a grade of 28 per
cent in his studies in the public schools.
It is a treat to see Bing Gay manipulate
the plugs and answer a call. In almost
the same second that the indicator falls
on the board in front of him his long, slim
Oriental band has reached ihe plug anj

The Camera to Detect Crime Photography an Aid to Justice.
PROBABLY no human invention has
aided the course of justice to a
greater extent than the snap-shot
camera. It has been instrumental
in condemning criminals, and has also
been the. means before now of saving in
nocent lives.
A case in point is that of Alfred Gray
son, an Englishman who was living a few
j - ears ago at Rio de Janeiro. He was ac
cused of the murder of a Brazilian named
Linares, a clerk in (he same office with
himself. The two were known to have
quarreled some days previous to the Sun
day on which Linares met his death. Ap
parently, however, they had made up
their differences, for they went out sailing
that day on a small yacht which Grayson
bad hired.
In the evening Grayson brought the
aead body of Linares home. His story
was that the latter had fallen from the
mast and fractured his skull. But medi
cal evidence was of opinion the wound on
the head had been made with a stick or
>ar. An oar was missing from the yacht's
Singey. The mast-climbing story, too,
sounded improbable, for the rigging was
all worked from the deck. Taking the re
:ent quarrel into consideration, and Gray
telephone), has got the call she wants.
There are six local "trunk" lines from
this exchange to the main telephone office
now, and the number will soon be in
creased to ten. The principal stores in
Chinatown, the restaurants, the families
and the clubs all use the telephone, and
it would be interesting to hear the varieJ
and sometimes exciting messages that fiv
over these wires. It is the "good angel"'
of the gambling-house, for it often telJs
them of new customers or gives warning
of those raiders who may be about to pen
etrate the inner doors. One can even im
agine it a friendly agency, by strategy oc
stealth, to help the poor slave girl of the
dens.
In conversation over the phone It is
surprising how much English is use.l
among the' Chinese. All are individual
lines, and if you want to talk with a Chi
nese merchant call for China 250, say,
and you will almost always get an Eng
lish "Hello! Who is this?" in return. But
cften at the switchboard after the "hello"
of the operator you will see htm shake
his queue in a deprecatory way and then
call in a mellow Â»oice, "Holar! Mut year
ho so?" This is Chinese for "Hello! What
number do you want?" and you know
that the rest of the conversation will
probably be carried on in that language.
The Chinese operator has to have a good
son's well known violent temper, the case
was black, indeed, against the English
man. The Coroner's jury had â¢already
found him puilty of murder, when a pas
senger on a Marlines steamer, which
had arrived in Rio on the Sunday after- 1
noon, came forward with a new piece of
evidence.
This was a snap-shot photograph taker
as the vessel entered the harbor. Far
away, under the cliffs, a tiny vessel was
sailing, and against the white sail was a
dark mark which a powerful magnifier
proved to be a falling man. By an almost
miraculous coincidence the camera had
been snapped just as Linares fell. The
photograph turned the scale in Grayson's
favor.
Almost equally curious is the way _
which a photograph aided Justice in the
Cooper murder case. Cooper was assist
ant to a young blacksmith named Mc-
Kenna in a Lanarkshire village. Bath
men were known to be fond of the same's
girl. One day Cooper was found dead on
the floor of the smithy. He had been
poisoned with carbolic -acid. McKenna
was suspected, but there was no proof
whatever of his having ever bought or
owned any c>u:holic acid, while Cooper
THE SUNDAY CAIiIi.
was known to have purchased, as a
toothache remedy, the phial found beside
his body. "Death from misadventure"
was the verdict.
Shortly afterward McKenna was arrest
ed. It appeared that an English tourist
memory and remember many names, for
the Chinese, 75 per cent of them perhaps,
call for a party by name instead of num
ber, and insist upon it until they get him.
Though it is a fact that the Chinese lan
guage, probably because it has more
vowels, can be heard more readily and
smoothly through the phone than Eng
lish, the operators are all required to
speak English, and often switch off into
that language in the midst of a conversa
tion started in Chinese. The Chinese op
erators and subscribers can get along well
on lines on which an American heais
with difficulty. But much of the business
of the lines is done in English.
This Chinatown office is run under a
different system from any other in the
world. The operators have in many casss
to act as interpreters for customers, and
among the Chinese the whole office is re
garded almost in the light of a general
information bureau. The operator is sup
posed to know what time the steamer
sails or arrives, all the particulars of the
last fight, etc.. and if the information is
not forthcoming the Inquirer consider*
himself insulted.
provided with a kodak had passed
through the village on the very morning
of the murder. Attracted by the quaint
ness of the old forge, he had taken sev
eral snap-shots of it. The photographer
went on to stay in an out-of-the-way part
of the Highlands and did not hear of
Cooper's death for some days. Then he
hastened to develop his plates. Plain In
one of the pictures were three bottles on
a shelf. Two were beer bottles, the third
was unmistakably one of those fluted blue
glass bottles in which poisons are sold.
It had also a label on it, and Hhough the
wording on this could not be read, yet on
the strength of this evidence the police
made a thorough search of McKenna's
premises. They found the remains of the
bottle in question in an old well and
proved that it had contained carbolic add.
Then McKenna confessed his guilt.

tific photography must make the criminal
feel less secure than he used to. One of

a tub of butter, which he had stolen from
the tail of a wagon as it was crossing a
The two long-distance booths are a
source of trouble also, for often the coun
try subscriber will only know the name of
the man he wants with no further partic
ulars, and the operator or little Yick Chun
will have to go out and look him up. The
good "hello boy" has not a bed of chrys
anthemums or roses, f^r he must know
the various Chinese dialects and English,
and in short, as the manager says, "have
some business about him." Occasionally
it comes to the point where the subscriber
and the operator have difficulties to be
settled out of office hours.
Loo Kum Shu, the manager, has a nice
private office here, and a comfortable
room upstairs, where he resides in order
to be "always on hand," as he ex
presses it. Order and cleanliness are ev
erywhere apparent, and the whole place
is run on business-like principles.
The telephone is not a new thing to
many of these operators, as in China they
have private telephone lines, but no ex
change. Two more sections will soon be
added to the switchboard, now consisting
of five sections. All complaints of suh
scribers are received at this office, and a
bridge in Rochester. N. T. The deadly
witness against him was a photograph
taken by telephotography from the top of
a neighboring high building.
Hindoo criminals succeed by long prac
tice in forming a little bag in their
throats, into which they can guide jewels
when they steal them. Last September
a native was arrested for stealing a dia
mond worth 10,000 rupees from a jeweler's
window in Calcutta. But as the evidence
was only circumstantial and possession
unproved he would have been liberated
had it not occurred to the police to have
an X-ray photograph taken of his throat.
That showed the gem safely hidden in the
little sac. The thief was sentenced to two
years' imprisonment, but he still refuses
to give up the diamond.
The Roentgen ray photography has also
been instrumental in adding several thou
sand pounds to the customs revenue of
Buenos Ayres within the last year. Val
uable jewelry on which no duty was be
ing paid was known to be coming into
the country in letters or stamped pack
ages, so the law-breakers were unchecked
At last, in June, 1900, several registered
letters and packages were examined un
der X-rays in the presence of the Argen
tine Postmaster General. Sixty-six sus
pected packages contained Â£4000 worth of
jewelry, and were, of course, all confis
cated.
rery frequent cans* of controversy is In
trying to explain to an Impatient cus
tomer that the line Is "busy." Thi3
scarcely comes within their belief, and
the operator gets the blame, which is not
wholly Chinese.
Directly opposite the door of this
strange office for business Is an altar gor
geous with embroideries and silken cur
tains, in the recess of which Is the Joss-
It was a "pleasant idea to have him
there," the manager said, and that pleas
ant idea is carried out In the Chinese
characters above the shrine, which trans
lated read thus: "A line will convey good
news to you."
On either side are the gilded glass doors
of the long-distance booths, and beyond
these again Is a carved and gilded grill
work. Through this Is the main room,
with the switchboard In a railed inclosure.
Carved sandalwood chairs, rich vases and
daintily carved tables of ebony are scat
tered around, and on the walls hang
scrolls richly embroidered in Chines* hie
roglyphics. When the operators pause in
their work If by chance they turn around
they read from these scrolls such max
ims as "Industry and attention to busi
ness," etc.
This luxurious part of the office is used
as a sort of waiting-room for those who
are waiting for messages, long-distance
calls, etc. Here a pleasant custom is in
troduced into business life that makes tha
American telephone offices seem thou
sands of miles away. No one i 3 being
treated hospitably while waiting, accord-
Ing to the Chinese Idea, unless he is of
fered a cup of fragrant tea or a pipe of
tobacco. So the richly chased little cups
with their saucer-like lids are always
about, and Ching Soy Sing Is often very
busy brewing a steaming golden bever
age. Then, if you drop into the office at
Just the right time, you may see a pic
ture. Here in one of the gorgeous chairs
sits a Chinese merchant, waiting to send
a message and beguiling the minutes with
a cup of tea and a curious looking water
pipe. The mother of one of the operators
has dropped in for a chat, and she shuf
fles around smilingly, carrying in her
arms a baby San Toy, swathed in brilliant
embroidery and wearing a wonderful
headdress. Through an open door you
catch a glimpse of a group of Orientals
busy with rice and chopsticks. You go
lingeringly down the stairs, fearful less
the spell be broken, and the last thing
that floats down to your ears Is tha
strange call: "Holar, mut year no set"

HOW TO DRESS
BECOMINGLY
yOC can't dress becomingly unless
there is a think behind every one

but what? They know the fashions, they
know the technical tricks of cutting and
fitting, but in most cases they don't know
you. Therefore, if you have anything
artistic about you. design your own
clothes. If not. turn yourself over to a
competent person, who shall study you
and act on the results.
For it is study that does itâ constant
6tudy. The designer of any costume
must consider the figure of the one who
LILLIAN
BURKHART
!s to wear it; he must consider the color
ing of hair, eyes and skin; and he must
consider the mode of life, which makes a
difference in the use of a gown. The key
note of good dressing is appropriateness.
Mark thatâ appropriateness. The busi
ness woman cannot go to business in re
ception costumes and look well dressed,
no matter how swell those reception cos
tumes may be. The stout woman cannot
wear fluffy effects and look like anything
but a ruffled pillow. The petite, kittenish
girl cannot wear the sweeping lines that
are becoming to her queenly sister and
be anything but ridiculous.
Appropriatenessâ remember that.
The woman off the stage must study
herself, her stylei. and decide on what
suits her best. Once settled, her path
ahead Is easy. But to the women of the
stage, who change their personalities
sometimes as olten as once a week, there
is nothing but constant study.
The piquante ingenue of one week may
be the stately queen of the next. To car
ry out the different roles costumes must
be planned with the greatest care and
must be strictly realistic, for the are of
dressing for the stage Is realism.
That may be something of a blow to
tradition. We have often heard that stage
gowns are one thing and human gowns
another. It has been told that grotesque
ly formed hats and gaudy colors and fac
tory-made gems lend "effect." A thou
sand times no. Such things look tawdry
and theatrical.
Actresses cannot wear flimsy, cheap
goods and expect them to look like bet
ter qualities. It is all nonsense. Poor
fabrics fall In ungraceful lines.
There is po art in dressing for the stage
without realism. A swell woman does not
wear tarlatan in the place of chiffon; and
a swell woman cannot be thus deplete]
on the stage.
Parts must be dressed exactly as they
would be in real life. I mean this to the
letter. I mean it even to the silk lining.
Therefore, as there is no difference be
tween stage dressing and off-stag dress
ing, the same law applies to both.
That law, remember, is appropriateness.
Take, for instance, the part of Edith in
"A Leap for Love." She is young, girl
ish, ingenuous. She is in good society.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Now what sort of a high-necked evening
gown will she wear?
In the first place, It will be good, for
she is supposed to be in fashionable so
ciety. There will be nothing shoddy about
her. Every material used in her gc-Vn will
be the best, and it will show as that. The
flare and the sweep that a silk lining give
cannot be imitated and they show even
from the sta^e.
Next, It will be simple, ror the girl
Is young. No young girl in good society
wears elaborate gowns.
As to color. I cho3e pink. This was part
ly because it is a girlish color and partly
because it suits me. There is another
complexity, you see; the actress has to
look to her own complexion at the same
time that she Is considering an imaginary
personality.
The little pink crepe de chine that I had
made for this part depends for its beauty
upon its exquisite quality and modish out
line. The trimming is simple in the ex
treme.
The sleeves are shirred above the elbow.
About half-way down the upper arm this
shirring springs into a great puff which
stops Just below the elbow.
Three broad tucks outline a dip In the
skirt. They have the same value as a cir
cular flounce: they Imitate the waist line
and increase the impression of a dip.
What trimming there is on the gown
consists of cream lace and cream corded
silk, the latter sprinkled with the fash
ionable French knots in black. The lit
tle square blocks In which the lace and
silk are arranged give a unique effect.
Notice again, that the dip line Is repeat
ed In the applique of dotted silk. It fits
over the hips like the yoke of a petticoat
and keeps to the outline of tha belt.
Compare this gown with the wedding
anniversary gown worn in "The Eighth
Year." In this, I must be a woman who
has lived past her girlhood, for the action
takes place on the eighth anniversary of
her wedding. It must be a dressy evening
gown.
Where the other was simple, this is elab
orate. It is of white lace over white taf
feta, and the lace skirt is embroidered all
over with little silver wreaths. Silver
spangles carry out the scheme on bodies
and sleeves.
The train is long and sweeping and over
it flow the long ends of a white silk sash
splendidly embroidered in silver designs.
The sleeves stop just above the elbow
and are close fitting. A puff of Illusion
tWj?s them; the bodice is supported by

straps over the shoulder, one a plain band
of white satin ribbon, the other a garland
of pink baby roses. That little garland
show 3 the only daah of color about the
gown.
You see what a different personality this
costume has from that of the pink crepe
de chine. It is older, more of the world.
And It ?ost my pocketbook a round $275
while the other was covered by $125.
The bolero gown is wsmart littla black
and white affair that I keep for my own
uses. It is appropriate for calling, for
matinees and the simpler class of after
noon functions like Informal teas and re
ceptions. The pattern should be becom
ing to any slender woman.
The beauty of the black silk skirt Is Its
rows of hemstitching. This is put tn in
long bands from waist to hem. The stitch
ing is about half an inch wide. Jet trim- *
ming surrounds the skirt; two rows In
the front and three In the back. The skirt
has a fairly long train.
Bodice and sleeves are severely plain,
made of cream lace over cream satin. The
bolero of black silk and black inserting
is cut In an odd shape that the picture
shows bettei than I can describe. Its two
long points in front are of brocaded vel
vet, a brilliant moss green; there Is no
other sign of green about the gown. That
touch of it gives life to the whole cos
turns.*
The hat worn with It la a cheap thingâ
I picked it up for $7. and I hold that it is
more artistic than plenty of $20 hats. In
fact. I'm not sure that I don't like it bet
ter than my Virot which cost me $28.
There you see a wide brim which Is
equally suited to a wide or narrow face.
The big Alsatian bow, too, gives width to
the whole. But people with very retrousse
noses should not risk a brim which rolls
so far over the face.
The Virot hat is a panne velvet laden
with a huge wreath of white roses and
dull green leaves. It is one of those hats
-which, roll up at the sides and dip in the
â¢
front. In narrow shapes thay are ex
tremely trying to any face, but the width
of this saves it.
That $35 lan ulster would never do for a
very stout woman. Let her beware of the
large, loose cloaks. They are stylish, but
they are Impossible to the stout.
Give a passing glance at the boa that
goes with this. The boa Is one of thÂ«
happiest of modern fashions. It softens
any face; it "dresses up" any gown. This
one is of white chiffon, edged with nar
row black velvet ribbon. This carries out
the season's fad for black and white.
But a warning right there. Don't be
misled by color fashions. There are cer
tain colors suited to every complexion,
and it is doubtful if the woman lives who
dare wear every shade. So unless the
prevailing colors be becoming pay no at
tention to their fashions. Colors are for
the individual, not the times.
Velvet Is In style this winter, and It \t
far more becoming than woolen cloth.
Dark-colored velvet softens the face, as
sealskin does. The black velvet jacket
and skirt costume Is suitable for street
Â¦wear. It Is very warm with its heavy
ermine trimming, and will be good form
only in cold weather. That is another
point on which so many make mistakes;
they dress unseasonably, therefore un
becomingly. If a woman can have only
one winter suit she makes a mistake In
getting anything so wintry looking, for
there are bound to come mild days, on
which the velvet and ermine will be out
of place.
The toque that goes with the suit car
ries out the ermine scheme. The breast
which surrounds it Is white dotted, with
black feathers, that look almost exactly
like the little black tails of the fur. Th>)
toque Is simplicity itself, but It cost me
$16, even though I get professional rates,
you know, as theatrical people do. We
are obliged to have so many clothes that
prices are cut to us.

DID you ever think what happiness
little things can give?
Don't you vividly remember
your own childhood and the inci
dents, small In themselves, that
made a day a crown of glory or a total
eclipse.
Have you ever made a Journey out of
the world of dollars and housekeeping, of
dressmakers and butcher boys. Into the
fairyland of childhood, where all Is light
and laughter and sunshine; where happi
ness is king and mirth Is queen and care
turns back ashamed.
If you have not, then take a trip
through the looking-gla6S Into the chil
dren^ playground at the park.
The parks of the world are many and
large, yet it has been left to San Fran
cifcco and its men of untiring energy to
produce beauties of nature, green hills
and greener turf, beautiful flowers, lakes
and waterfalls from shifting sands. -
There came a time when a great man
died and left a sum to be expended for a
children's playground. Rich men had died
and left funds for hospitals, churches and
cathedrals, but this man, loving them as
be lived, he blessed and remembered them
when he died and left hi* memory to be
kept green by troops of shouting children..
This was many years ago. To-day tlw
ideas of the originator are being carried
out.
To-day as you enter the main building,
where the children and the grown-ups sit
and have ices and cakes and coffee and
bread and butter, you are met with the
sight of flower-laden tables and spotless
floors and an air of breeding that lends
Itself to the whole building and that tells
you that it is Inborn in the one who Is in
charge, this knowledge of the correctness
of things.
And presently you meet her, for a wo
man only could have so regulated things,
who holds sway over the children's five
acres.'
Mrs. Hickok takes you in hand at once,
makes you feel delightfully at home and
still more, in touch with her and -her work
Immediately. â¢ ? â¢': .
In the first place, the main building has
been scoured from cellar to garret and
entirely repainted. It needed it.
. The main room and anteroom are as
pretty and sweet smelling as a hot
house, and the kitchen is something for
all young wives to gaze at.
Mrs. Hickok draws your attention to
the porcelain tubs, to the spotless sauce
pans and, above all, her pride, the gas
range, the largest in California, where the
roasting of a turkey Is as easy as that of
a reed bird.
Formerly the good San Franciscan*
who came out a-picnicklns; to the park
were provided with their coffee or their
chocolate in the main room. Very soon,
however, the floor below, which was
used for a store room, will be ready to
supply the wants of every one who de
sires his coffee Â«nd chocolate, and Mrs.
Hickok hopes eventually to duplicate the
room upstairs by. the one below and con
vert it Into a garden of palms and flowers
and small tete-a-tete tables.
It is wonderful how this little woman
with the serious face and sweet smile
thinks of her children: for they are all
her children, from the youngest to the
eldest. ; -
â¢We use our utmost care In protecting
them from all harm, and we are fortunate
in having had only a few accidents. And,
cf course.", she continues, "trivial acci
dents will occur, although we try hard
to avoid them." And her voice trembled
ever so slightly, and you read the wo
man's heart behind it all.
"The sewerage system." presently con
tinues the quiet voice, "was in a very bad
condition, but now we have the newest
plumbing and everything of the very
best, and more to follow very soon."
The new candy booth is going to be a
great success over the old one. It is a
Email building, cedar finish inside and of
pretty architecture.
"You know," Mrs. Hickok says, "that
the flies have been a pest in the old candy
booth, and then the girls have felt the
cold , r.d draught bo much; and when it
rains it is very hard on them. So I am
co pleased that we have been able to
build this new one."
A duty becomes a pleasure when one
has such thoughts for other people. As
one looks at the children in the swings,
or on the "merry-go-round," singing,
smiling, cooing, laughing, the babies in
the gcat carts,~ shrieking with delight,
the elder ones on donkeys sedately jog
ging, one Is seized with that Inexpressi
ble something, that plays on the heart
strings and brings all nature and its
product nearer home. The children's
playground is no longer a money maker
for one man.
Now it receives from the people to give
back to the people.
In the last six months more than 1200
children from the kindergartens sup
ported by subscription in this city have
been entertained, and that royally, at
the playground. These little ones arrive
usually at between 9 and 10 in the morn
ins and it is one long day's joy to them.
"Poverinos," who have not much to look
forward to at any time! Think of their
pleasure. The green grass, the rides, the
midday luncheon, the icecream, the cakes
and the sweetmeats.
Everything that comes from the mar
kets is of thÂ« very best; no heed is paid
whether butter is up or down or eggs 40
cents a dozen. The best is the order and
that order is carried out to the letter.
The result is obvious. The children sit
down to a perfect cup of coffee, excel
lent bread and butter, home-made cake
as light as air, and they wish they could
board at the pavilion.
Many new changes, or rather addenda,
are soon to be made.
It is intended to have a fcur-in-hand,
to be driven by ponies, handled by a
smart groom, for the benefit of the
youngsters desirous of seeing a little of
the quiet and by-ways of the park. The
merry-go-round will also be improved
and possibly rebuilt, and so the work will
go on.
The rooms overhead are neatly and ar
tistically furnished and occupied by Mrs.
Hickok and her son, who are always there
to look after tlie pleasure of the people
who visft the playgrounds. .
The Park Commissioners have much to
be proud of and to Mr. McDonald, who
has the children's five acres in charge,
the mothers of San Francisco should be
very thankful. He has given to them and
their babies a pleasure that no other city
in the world has yet been able to effect.
The prices in the restaurant are very
reasonable and the quality excellent. The
tickets for goats, donkeys and merry-go
round are 2^ cents. In fact you can get
a great d<*al at the children's quarters for
25 cents, as it is not being run to make
money. â¢
The thoughtful interest shown by xour
Park Commissioners in providing 'for the
pleasure of the children and young people
is most commendable. The lawn tennis
courts are greatly enjoyed by the young
people. Handball is now being provided,
and other improvements which will be
noticed later. Commissioner Martin is the
originator of the lawn tennis court and
other games which are being provided.
RIGHT WAY TO IRON SHIRTS.
Y-TOR Jronlngr, fold the shirt
I I straight down the middle of the
T~\ back and iron the body smooth, tak
ing care to move the iron mainly
JL straight with the warp. Next fold
a sleeve flat along the sloped seam and
iron it upon both sides. Iron first through
the middle, then take hold of the wrist
band or shoulder with the left hand and
hold taut till the Iron goes quite to the
join. Open the wristband, lay it flat, and
iron hard upon the wrong side, then turn
upon the right side. Then comes the tug
of warâ otherwise ironing the bosom.
First Bastes the neckband properly,
next slip the bosom fcoard inside the shirt
and spread the bosom smooth upon it,
pressing it out simultaneously with both
hands. With a thin clean cloth wet the
whole linen surface lightly with weak
raw starch. Rub it in very well, and if
any place feels sticky wipe it off with a
cloth dipped in tepid water. Have the
iron hot enough to yellow dry cloth if left
to stand on it ten seconds. Begin at the
bottom of the bosom and iron straight
toward the neck, up the middle, holding
the neckband in the left hand and pulling
hard against the iron. Here as much de
pends on the left hand as the rightâ the
knack lies mainly in knowing how to pull
properly.
If the bosom wrinkles or forms one of
the warps known to laundresses as "cat
faces," wet the place with clear water,
stretch it smooth, and iron over again.
Rub the iron over the while wax, also in
the salt tray, to insure a perfectly smooth
surface. rÂ£ the starch is rightâ properly
made and appliedâ it will not stick to the
face. But if a yellowy crust forms upon
the iron tip scratch it off with a blunt
knife and be sure to wax and salt-polish
the iron again before settling it on the
shirt.
When the whole bosom is smooth and
nearly dry take one of the polishing irons,
not quiti. 1 so hot as the others, rub tho
face of it with either polishing wax or
white soap and press the bosom hard all

SKAGWAY SCENE
OF CONSPIRACY
THE CALL has received correspondence from an au
thentic source at Skagway telling the astounding news of
the discovery of a conspiracy existing at Dawson and ramify
ing to Skagway, Victoria, Vancouver and Seattle, for the over
throw of the local government of the Northwest Territory and
the establishment of a republic, with Dawson as its capital.
Arms, ammunition and provisions have been taken in over
the railroad and cached at strategic points. Prominent Ameri
can residents of Skagway are said to be ringleaders in the con
spiracy. Miners to the number of 5000 are said to await the
summons to arms, ready to fight for the independence from Do
minion rule of the gold-Held camps and towns. The plan is to
overpower the mounted police, arrest the civil authorities and
take government into their ozvn hands. The rigors of the
Arctic winter would give the insurgents six months' immunity
from attack by Canadian or British troops, and tlxe adventurous
arch-conspirators hope for intervention or outside assistance by
the time the melting of ice and snow will permit the invasion
of their isolated republic. *

anxiety among the Canadian au

LORD SALISBURY'S RETIREMENT
EXPECTED TO BE SOON ANNOUNCED
Premier Appears to Be in Need of Repose From Burdens lhat
Are Too Great for His Strength.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NyN v EW YORK, Nov. 16. â Herbert Paul in a London cable to the Herald says:
"A more important result of Lord Salisbury's speech has been to revive rumors of
his early retirement. Hitherto I have not paid much attention to these reports. But
* it is impossible to ignore the impression made upon those who heard Lord Salis
bury on the evening of Nove.nber 9. He seemed to them like a man who urgently needed
repose and whose burdens were too great for his strength. Yet all men agree that an active,
incessant vigilance of a master mind, penetrating and directing every department of. state, es
pecially the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and War Office, was never more urgently needed
than it is to-day. No one could in the circumstances accuse Lord Salisbury of pusillanimity
if he laid dowri the duties he has discharged so long."

was to have been formed inside
the boundaries of the republic of
the conspirators' dreams, but the
presence of Americans among its
leaders and in the ranks would
give it much the character of a
Fenian cr a Walker invasion and
would in consequence increase
the difficulties of the situation for
the American Cabinet in deciding
upon this Government's attitude,
i The conspiracy, conceived in
1 Dawson, and with headquarters
at Skagway. has ramifications ex
tending to Victoria, Vancouver
and Seattle. It is said that the
arch-conspirators are Americans,
some of them prominent resi
dents of Skagway, officers of the
municipality and ex-Federal offi
cials being implicated. The ma
jority of the plotters, however,
are said to be Canadians. It is
even rumored that some of the
Northwest Mounted Police are
party to the conspiracy and stand
ready to assist in making their
comrades prisoners, thus insur
ing the success of the first step

Republic to Be Formed.
The plan was to gather the dis
! satisfied miners at appointed
I places arid arm them quietly, and
, then, at preconcerted signals, to
! overpower all of the 500 mounted
police who are not party to the
plot. The next step was to be
the arrest of all civil officials from
Governor Ross down, all of them
to be held as hostages. The rail
road would be destroyed, a pro
visional government organized,

free and independent state, and
its flag hoisted.
It is said that an American was
to be made President of the
snowed-in republic.
To sane men, used to the re
straints of government and close
to the centers of authority, the
story of the conspiracy of the ad
venturers ot the Yukon and the
readiness of the men of the min
ing camps to join an army of re
volt seems wholly incredible. But
conditions are such in the iso
lated camps of Alaska that tem
porary success, except for the
timely discovery o^ the plot,
would be certain, and with sover
eign power so easy of attainment,
the adventurous spirits of the
Northwest had apparently shut
their eyes to the certainty of ret
ribution.
Immunity From Attack.
The plotters reasoned that once
the new republic were established
it would have immunity from at
tack for at last six months, as it
would be impossible to march
troops against them over the ter
rible White and Chilcoot passes
during the Arctic winter. This
breathing spell would give them
time to perfect their civil and mil
itary organization,, to fortify and
prepare for attack and to rally be
neath the Mag of the "Yukon Re
public" nearly all the inhabitants
of the region. So far as rumor
goes, the leaders do not reason
much farther into the future, ex
cept to contend in a general way
that once the republic had at
tained so formidable a position
the United States would not per
mit British soldiers to be trans
ported over American territory
to make war upon it, and that the
difficulties of reaching the Upper
Yukon region by an all-Canadian
route would be so great that the
territory of the new republic
could he defended until outside
intervention would secure its
recognition and its independence.
Doubtless the conspirators b.e
lieve that revolt from British rule
and possible future annexation to
the United States would form a
prospect so pleasing as to dispose

of stores that were being shipped
over the White Pass and Yukon
Railroad into the Klondike coun
try â stores, it is now understood,
of such a character and in such
quantities as would be sent in to
supply a small army with food.
These stores, the Canadian offi
cials have ascertained, have
never reached Dawson or any of
the populous mining camps. It
is presumed that they are cached
or hidden in glacial caves, await
ing the mobilizing of the army of
the proposed republic.
Hundreds of boxes of signifi
cant similarity in form and
weight, at the time alleged to
contain mining tools and machin
ery, have also been sent across
the border, only to disappear be
fore reaching the bonanza creeks.
It is now asserted that these
boxes contained arms and ammu
nition.
In ari obscure building in
Skagway, said to be the property
of one of the chief conspirators,
a large iron safe was discovered
yesterday by a United States offi
cial. A rumor has. been current
that in such a safe there were
hidden papers pertaining to the
plot and a large amount of money
to be used in the furtherance of
the conspiracy on the American
side of the border. This safe will
probably be seized and broken
open in the search for evidence as
soon as Marshal Shoup returns
with instructions from Wash
ington.
SEATTLE, Nov. 16.â United
States Marshal Shoup had been
in Seattle for several days past,
but sailed to-night on the Dolphin
for Skagway. While here he took
no one into his confidence con
cerning the purpose of his hur
ried visit, and the evident secrecy
of his mission excited comment.
FIRE IN THE BABY MINE
IS NOW UNDER CONTROL
Bodies of Eight of the Unfortunate
Victims Buried in the Same
Cemetery.
BLUEFIELDS, W. Va., Nov. 16.â The
reports from the Baby mine to-night are
that the fire has practically been extin
guished, three huge streams of water hav
ing been poured into the burning mine
since last night.
Since 2 o'clock this morning- three more
bodies have been taken out, all badly
charred. They have not been identified
and are probably the bodies of Hungar
ians. Walter H. O'Malley, superintendent
of the Baby mine, says that no more
bodies are in the shaft, but a number of
miners say that at least eight more bodies
are in the mine. The list of bodies re
covered now numbers twelve and two or
three of the injured may yet die. Bight
bodies of the unfortunates were buried
to-day in the same cemetery -where are
buried 200 or more miners who met death
in the same mine nearly fifteen year,s ago

BLOW UP TRAIN
WITH DYNAMITE
Two Coaches Derailed
but the Passengers
Escape Injury.
YORK, Pa., Nov. 16.â The Southwestern
express on the Northern Central Railway
was wrecked last night by a charge of
dynamite placed under the tracks near
Black Ridge, a short distance north of
York. The train was running at the rate
of forty-five miles an hour when the ex
plosion occurred. The passengers were
panic stricken, but all escaped injury. A
piece of rail two and a half feet long
was blown off and two coaches were de
railed and drawn over the ties a distance
of 200 feet before the train was brought
to a stop. The engine had its headlight
blown orf and the windows of the cab
were shattered. The trucks under the ex
press car and the day coach were badly
wrecked. A hole was blown in the road
bed large enough to bury a man. Where
the rails were broken they were cut off
as if by shears.
The wreck occurred at one of the loneli
est spots between Harrisburg and Balti
more. The police of this city advance the
theory that the robbers had set the dyna
mite for the Buffalo express, which is
said to carry considerable money, but for
some unaccountable reason that train
passed over the charge without exploding
it.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 16.â Reports of
the dastardly attempt to wreck the
Southwestern express on the Northern
Central branch of the Pennsylvania Rail
way were received at the office of the
company this morning. Detectives were
ordered to begin operations from York
and men were also sent from this city
and Harrisburg. There is little hope that
the dynamiters will be captured, as it is
thought they undoubtedly made their
way to one of the large citie3 before day
light.
The wrecked train is the Southwestern
express which leaves Washington at 8:45
p. m. The train had left York and was
en route to Harrisburg when the explo
sion occurred.

Prominent Man Tells
Why Britons Leave
Suez Route.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â Charles IHidley
Wilhite, a prominent and wealthy Aus
tralian wool grower, whose principal
place of business is in London, is in New
York, en route to Melbourne via the New
Ycrk Central, Union Pacific and Oceanic
steamship line.
Concerning the announcement from
London to the effect that Great Britain
had arranged to send the Australian mail
by this route instead of by the Suez ca
nal, Wilhite said:
"A faster mail service to London ia
what Australians have long desired. The
fast express between London and Brin

of the Peninsular and Oriental line, wa3
a long step forward, but upon the com

course, the British people are lovers of
home industry and would gladly have
continued to give exclusive contracts to
the English carrying company, but busi
ness is business and sentimental reasons
should not prevail.
"There is no denying the fact that
American transportation companies are
much superior to ours. The recent at
tempts made by the Spreckels steamship
line in connection with the New York
Central Railroad to shorten the time be
tween Australian ports and London have
convinced our people that this ia by far
the more expeditious route. We have no
railroad system In England or on the Con
tinent equal to the New York Central,
while in the matter of steamship service
the United States, so long backward in
this respect, is now taking front rank

hardly believe my 3enses, and felt that [

Enjoy Perfect Health Due to Pe-ra-na
Mr. Willis Hughes. President of tha
Century Bicycle Club of Crown Poin\
Ind., writes the following:
"Peruna is very popular in Crown
Point, but I must say that it deserves a!!
the praise it gets. There is natural
prejudice here against patent medicine*,
but Peruna has quietly yet persistent; y
worked its way to hundreds of homes
and is now a welcome visitor.
"I have found it an invaluable help,
especially in cases of catarrh. I suffered
with catarrh of the head and found that
two weeks' treatment entirely cured m<-
I now enjoy perfect health and Peruna
has a staunch friend in me."â Willis
Hug-hes.
There are some' things which are as
sure as fate and can be relied on to occur
to at least one-half of the human family
unless means are taken to prevent.
First, the climate of fall and winter Is
sure to bring colds; second, colds not
promptly cured are sure to cause catarrh:
third, catarrh improperly treated is sur*
to make life short and miserable.
Catarrh spares no organ or function of
the body. It is capable of destroying
sight, taste, 3mell, hearing, digestion, ,
secretion, assimilation and excretion. It
pervades every part of the human body â
head, throat, stomach, bowels, bronchial
tubes, lungs, liver, kidneys, blacder and
sexual organs.
Catarrh is the cause of at least one-half
of the ills to which the human family is
subject. Is there no way to escape from
it? There is.
Peruna never fails to cure a cold. PÂ»-
runa never fails to cure catarrh in the
first stage. Peruna cures catarrh in th*
second stage, nine cases out of ten. Pe-
runa cures catarrh in its last and worst
stages in the majority of cases, and never
fail 9 to benefit every case, however bad.
Peruna alao cures la grippe, coughs and
consumption in the first stages with un-
failing certainty.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman. giving Â»
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratis.

STILL RIOTING
Blood Flows in the Path
of the Galway
Contest.
DUBLIN, Nov. 16.â Rioting between the
Horace Plunkett and Arthur Lynch fac
tions, as a result of the Parliamentary
contest In Gal way, was renewed last
right. The Lynchites stormed the Union
ist headquarters and further demolished
the doors and windows. Numbers of per
sons were injured and several heads were
split.
Colonel Lynch has not yet appeared on
the scene and is not expected. The Na
tionalists assert that if the colonel is
elected he will be "smuggled" Inside the
House of Commons to take the oath and
then "face the music" if accused of trea
son for fighting in behalf of the Boers.
John Dillon is actively campaigning
against Plunkett, his object, it is alleged,
being to^cause Mr. Plunkett's retirement
from the vieÂ« presidency of the Irish Ag
ricultural and Industrial Department,
which will probably follow his defeat. Dil
lon's attitude is in line with his denunci
ation of John Redmond because the lat
ter so warmly supported Plunkett's pro
jects for the regeneration of agriculture
in Ireland, on the Parliamentary commit
tee, whose labors resulted in the forma
tion of the new department.
Four hundred extra policemen were
drafted to Galway to-day and were patrol
ling the streets. A large force of police
is held at the Courthouse, in readiness
for eventualities.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
NEWS FROM THE CAPITALS OF EUROPE
OPPOSE GERMAN
TARIFF MEASURE
Agrarian League Stamps
the Bill as Entirely
Unacceptable.
All Indications Point to Its
Adoption in Its Present
Form.
BERLIN, Nov. 16.â Views differ regard
ing the effect of the Bundesrath's action
on the tariff bill. Friends of the measure
assert that the prospects- of its adoption
substantially in its present form by the
Reichstag have greatly improved and
ever, its opponents do not disguise their
disappointment over the Bundesrath's
acquiescence. The Centrists press de
mands its speedy passage and insists the
longer the debate lasts the more difficult
will be the adoption of the measure. Nev
ertheless a long and heated discussion is
certain. Even obstruction tactics are
hinted at by the Radicals and Socialists.
The Agrarian League pronounces the bill
to be absolutely unacceptable and says
that the Agrarians are profoundly disap
pointed at the Bundesrath's action. The
league urges persistent opposition to the
measure in the Reichstag and is sending
circulars to its local branches setting
fcrth that all increases in Industrial du
ties must be rejected unless the full
Agrarian demands are conceded.
Anti-Chamberlain Meetings.
Numerous anti-Chamberlain meetings
were held throughout Germany this week
and there are no signs of an abatement
of the movement. A number of the meet
ings adopted resolutions which were for
warded to the Imperial Chancellor, Count
yon Bulow. A direct semi-official utter
arcc on the subject is stin lacking, but a
r umber of the current weeklies which
generally reflect the views of the local
officials print simultaneously an article
supposed to have been inspired from Ber
lin, in which the people are warned
agrainst carrying too far the feeling of in
dignation against Chamberlain and allow
ing it to assume the form of general politi
cal hostility to Great Britain. The writer
of the article rejects the demand that the
German Government enter a protest -in
London against the utterances of the Co
lonial Secretary and ask for satisfaction,
as this would overshoot the mark. The
article concludes with saying that public
feeling in France passed over the matter
with light ridicule, and asserts that the
French would rejoice if all Germans, with
the Chancellor at the head, "ran foul of
the English bully's weapon." More sig
nificant is the circular which the execu
tive committees of the German Veterans'
Union and Prussian National Veterans'
Union have., as already cabled, issued,
deprecating the anti-Chamberlain dempn
onstrations and requesting the veterans to
avoid taking part in the movement.
Troubles of Grand Duke of Hesse.
In regard to the approaching action for
divorce between the Grand Duchess of
Hesse and the Grand Duke, the Cologne
Gazette says it learns authoritatively that
no third party is involved, explains that
the disagreement is owing to the Incom
patibility of their temperaments and
tastes and intimates that the lack of a
male heir also has a bearing on the case.
The paper further says that the Czar's re
cently projected visit to Darmstadt was
omitted because of the marital troubles
of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of
Hesse.
Emperor William was hunting yester
day and to-day in Letzlingen forest, near
Stendal, Prussian Saxony, with a large
party of the highest nobility. The Empe
ror's special guest on this occasion is the
Grand Duka Vladimir of Russia, uncle of
the Czar.
All signs indicate that there will be
much suffering among the working
classes in Germany this winter. The au
thorities of this city estimate that there
are 35,000 unemployed persons in Berlin,
and from all sections of the country come
reports of people seeking work. Statis
tics show that an average of two persons
inquired for every vacant job in October,
and the number of unemployed has in
creased since then, several iron furnaces
and other establishments having recently
discharged men. The various German
States have begun investigating the num
ber of people unemployed, preparatory to
establishing relief works.
The latest experiments with electric
locomotives between Berlin and Zossen
show the engines have reached a speed
of 100 miles an hour. The experiments
have been suspended until a heavier track
is built.

it is claimed was paid under protest on a
cargo of sugar brought by them from
Hollo, in the Philippines. Warner, Barnes
& Co. advance the claim that the Island
of Panay is American and not foreign ter
ritory, and that the collection of duties
was contrary to the constitution of the
United States. The suit is in a way a test
case to determine the right to impose
duty on goods brought from any of the
colonial possessions cf this Government,
and will probably be carried to the United
States Supreme Court.

BY CABLE TO THE CALL.
NOT TO RAISE
TAX ON SUGAR
Stir Created in England
by Circulation of
a Rumor.
Chancellor of the Exchequer's
Task In Supplying Revenue
for the Boer War.
LONDON, Nov. 16.â A stir has been
created by the rumor that Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, would impose another tax of a
half penny per pound on sugar, although
inquiries by a representative of The Call
have resulted in discrediting the probabil
ity of any such action. It Is an unwrit
ten rule of the treasury that no industry
shall be tampered with two years run
ning, and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach Is not
likely to break through hard and fast tra
ditions, however hard pushed he may be
for funds to carry on the war. Neverthe
less, the rumor has brought to light a
curious condition of affairs, which would
certainly favor the Government, should
It decide to take the step, despite the tax
imposed in the last budget. The British
consumer is now buying sugar more
cheaply than before the tax was imposed.
This is due chiefly to the surplus supply,
but also to wholesale price cutting in Ger
many, where a sugar trust, is causing the
British sugar trade the keenest apprehen
sion. This German trust will form one of
the chief topics of the sugar conference
which is to meet in Brussels December il
ThÂ«ugh the United States Government
has not been invited to send a delegate to
the conference, the correspondent learns
that it could be represented if it so de
sired, and one of the leading authorities
on sugar in England is now endeavoring
to secure the attendance of American del
egates at the meeting in Brussels.
Until after the conference it can be defi
nitely st,ated Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
will not take any action, and then it is
improbable that he will run the risk of
further disintegrating business, which on
all sides, it is declared, would be In a
sorrowful plight.
Replying to a correspondent, Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach said the coal tax
would be continued next year, but inti
mated that It would not be increased.
This will take a load off the minds of
British coal miners, who have been espe
cially exercised over the inroads Ameri
can coal has made on the Continent.
RESUME NEGOTIATIONS
ON THE CESSION TREATY
Danish Government Placeg Its Inter
ests in Hands of the Minister
at Washington.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â The negotia
tions between the Governments of the
United States and Denmark relative to
the cession to the Lnited States of the
Danish West Indies have been transferred
to Washington.
The transfer was brought about through
the desire of the Danish Government to
place Its interests in the matter in the
hands of Constantln Brunn, Danish Min
ister at this capital. He spent some time
at Copenhagen last summer and returned
to Washington recently thoroughly pre
pared to carry forward the negotiations
directly with Secretary Hay. It is learned
that within the last few days there has
been increased activity in the negotia
tions, and that sensible progress ha^
been made toward the completion of a
treaty of cession.
DTJRPHET'S CONVICTION

land, George, Fraser and Sears handed
down to-day the motion of B. G. Durphey,

insufficiency of evidence and misconduct
of the Jury, was denied.
Judge Sears said that on grounds of
public policy th^ affidavit of certain mem
bers of the Jury to impeach the verdict
would not be admitted. The affidavit re
ferred to alleges that certain members of
the Jury, while considering the case,
brought up. matters detrimental to the
defendant which had never appeared In
the evidence.
Country Coroner Murdered.
CREEDE, Colo., Nov. 16.â Dr. A. N.
Simpson, Coroner of Mineral County, was
found dead in his office with a bullet
wound in the center of the back. He was
evidently murdered, aa the nature and po
sition of the wound preclude the possibil
ity of suicide. There is no clew to the
murderer.
Mother and Children Burned.

Cabinet Torpor Is Block
ing Needed Domestic
Legislation.
Parliament Is Expected to
Reassemble on the 23d
of Next January.
LONDON, Nov. 16.â The Cabinet appears
to have awakened from Its lethargy to
such unexpected energy as to elicit from
the Gazette the following comment:
"The strict application to business is
highly to be commended and will be ap
preciated."
This unintentional admission of the
Cabinet's previous laziness has caused the
statement that the various committees of
the* Cabinet, sitting this week, will form
ulate proposals for the reform of proced
ure in the House of Commons. These
proposals will be considered by the full
Cablet next week.- It Is pretty generally
admitted that there Is crying need of such
a step, as domestic legislation Is almost
hopelessly blocked.
Parliament, it is expected, will reassem
ble January 23.
The negotiations between the govern
ments of Great Britain and Nicaragua
with regard to the Mosquito coast have
been very voluminous, but it Is now be
lieved that Nicaragua can provide a sat
isfactory guarantee for the protection of
the natives and enable Great Britain to
rid herself of a responsibility which
brings with it no advantage. The ques
tion of a suitable guarantee has been
chiefly responsible for the prolongation of
the matter, Lord Lansdowne, British For
eign Secretary, insisting that the Indians
must be adequately protected. Beyond
this point the Foreign Office displays lit
tle interest in the matter, believing that
Great Britain's rights on the Mosquito
coast are valueless.
BITTER LEGAL FIGHT
OVER A MINING CLAIM
Partners Disagree and Ask the Courts
to Settle Their Differ
ences.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa. Nov. 16.â
Mrs. Beatrice A. Steadman of San Diego,
was an important witness for the plain
tiff in the Doyle-Burns mining suit, in
volving title to a large share of stock
in the Portland Mining Company. She
gave her testimony in a remarkably clear
way in the face of a rigid cross-examin
ation by Senator Patterson. She told of,
going to Cripple Creek with her husband
In 1897 and assisting- him in working his
claim by running a windlass at the top
while her husband worked at the bottom.
She testified that she saw Burns and
Doyle frequently and that the former had
always referred to Doyle as "my part
ner." She said she had negotiated with
Burns for the lease of ground on which
to build a boarding house. She objected
to certain agreements without Doyle's
consent, to which she says Burns replied:
"I assure you it will be a great accommo
dation to both myself and my partner,
Jimmy Doyle."
Mrs. Steadman also testified to her hus
band getting a contract on Bobtail No. 2,
which she said was given by Burns and
Doyle, and that Doyle made all the ar
rangements.
Mrs. Steadman and her husband now
live in San Diegrc*, where they are well
known. They made a fortune in the Klon
dike.
Not Topeka "Buffalo Jones."
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 16.â The report

the bison provided with a home by the
Government before he dies. Obituaries
and portraits of the Topeka "Buffalo"
Jones have appeared in a number of East

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more sick-
ness and suffering than any other disease; therefore* when
through neglect or other causes, kidney trouble is permitted to
continue, fatal results are sure to follow.

were to be traced to the kidneys, but now modern science proves
that nearly all diseases have their beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs.
Your other organs may need attention â but your kidneys most,
because they do most and need attention first.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and bladder remedy, because
as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs
to health. A trial will convince any one.
The mild and Immediate effect of Dr.

READY TO SIGN
CANAL TREATY
Lord Pauncefote Re
ceives Full Power
From London.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.W..
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â 0n account of
the slight Indisposition from which Lord
Pauncefote Is suffering, the signature of
the isthmian canal treaty has been de
layed until next week. Lord Pauncefote
ha-o received full credentials from Lon
don empowering him to sign the treaty.
This indicates conclusively that the Lon
don government has approved the text of
tho instrument. Nothing now stands in
the way of its signature and submission
to the Senate for ratification. President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hay are conn
dent that the new treaty will be ratified
without difficulty.
Members of the diplomatic corps are
taking a great interest in the treaty be
cause of the importance to them of its
provisions in connection with the project
ed canal. Unofficial Inquiries to ascertain
its contents have already been addressed
to this Government and they have been
answered fully and frankly by Secretary
Hay. There is no Intention of the part of
either Great Britain or the United States
to attempt to make a secret out of a mat
ter that has been public property for
months.
LONDON, Nov. 16.â 50 far as the British
Government is concerned all that remains
to be done in connection with the istn
mian canal is for Lord Pauncefote and
Secretary of State Hay to aifix their sig
natures to the treaty. Such minor sug
gestions as ensued after the British em
bassador's arrival at Washington have
been disposed of and the Foreign Office
awaits news of the signing of the con
vention, though it has not received any
intimation as to when this is likely to
occur. No draft of the treaty has been
cabled here for the good reason that the
document is safely locked away in the
Foreign Ofnce files, where it haa been
since prior to Lord Pauncefote's departure
from this country- The embassador was
emnowered to sign on behalf of Great
Britain the first day he arrived in the
United States, If such a course seemed to
him advisable. He is acting with full
power and the officials presumed that he
is only awaiting convenience of the State
Department at Washington.

BANK ROBBERS
ARE CAPTURED
Pursued and Taken After
Commiting a Daring
Crime.
SIOUX CITT, lowa, Nov. 16.â The bank
at Greenville, nine miles north of Sioux
Rapids, was broken into last night, the
vault and safe blown open and the con
tents taken. The bank building was
wrecked. The bank is owned by the Bank
of Sioux Rapids and kept on hand a com
paratively small amount of cash.
The robbers are supposed to have es
caped on a handcar, as one belonging at
Greenville was found at a Rock Island
crossing two miles south of there.
The bank robbers were found in the de
pot at Albert City this afternoon by offi
cers and a posse. When ordered to sur
render, the robbers opened fire, wounding
C. J. Lodime, the City Marshal, in the
hip. and John Sunbland, a business man,
In the shoulder. One robber was fatally
shot in the stomach by the posse. The
two 'robbers escaped to the country and,
meeting a farmer with a team, compelled
him to drive them east until his horses
gave out and they met another farmer,
whom they compelled to take them far
ther. They were overtaken by a posse
from Albert City and headed off by a
posse from. Laurens six miles east of
Storm Lake for safe keeDing.
Two are white and one is a mulatto.
The wounded man is about 40 years of
age, heavy set and wears a stubby brown
mustache. The other white man Is young
er and not so stout.
Some people who. are averse to borrow
. ing trouble manage to keep a stock on
1 hand.
GIRL SURPRISES
A BOLD BURGLAR
Springs From Bed and
Captures Man in
Her Room.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 16.â Miss Mary
Arnold of Sacramento,, Cal., is the hero
ine of the hour in Montana. Alone and
unaided, without the use of a weapon of
any sort, she captured an armed and des
perate burglar.
Miss Arnold recently came to Butte,
Mont., and was staying at an apartment
house on South Wyoming street. At 3
o'clock in the morning the light from a
bullseye lantern awakened her. By the
light of this lantern she beheld the burg
lar helping himseilf to her jewelry and
valuables. She also noted at the same
instant that he had taken her revolver.
Nothing daunted by her apparently help
less condition Miss Arnold sprang from
her bed and before the .astonished burglar
could realize what had happened she
leaped upon him and wound her arms
about his neck in a strangling embrace.
The frightened robber struggled desper
ately to free himself, but was helpless in
her strong embrace, which was anything
but affectionate.
Then Misa Arnold began shouting for
help. Thomas Edmunds, in the next
apartment, seized an icepick and came to
her assistance. Others soon came from
various rooms. The burglar was bound
and held until the police arrived. At the
station he gave his name as George W.
Miller. On his person were found two
loaded revolvers, one of them being the
one he stole from Miss Arnold.
SECRETARY GAGE
IS IN IGNORANCE
President Fails to Con
sult Him Concerning
an Appointment.
Head of Treasury Department
Oets First Knowledge
From Newspapers
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 16.â President
Roosevelt selected Senator N. N. Strana
han of New York to be George R. Bid
well's successor as Collector of the Port
without the knowledge of Secretary of
the Treasury Gage. There are several
unusual things about the settlement of
this question, but none quite so unusual
as that Stranahan had been tendered the
position, had accepted it and was acualÂ»y
In Washington tor a talk with the Presi
dent while the Secretary of the Treasury
was in ignorance that a change was pend
ing.
The first intimation that Gage had that
he was to have a new Collector under
him after April 1 was given to him by the
newspapers at his breakfast table. He
was not half as angry over this as the
President was over the premature pub
lication of the news. It had been the in
tention of the President to talk the mat
ter over with Senator Stranahan, bring
Secretary Gage upon the scene, have him
acquiesce in the change and then make
the announcement from the White House
in the usual way. Senator Stranahan' s
frienda talked and Secretary Gage was
thunderstruck when he read the news, in
consequence there, is undeniable friction
All sorts of rumors are afloat to the ef
fect that Secretary Gage will resign his
portfolio in President Roosevelt's Cabi
net. It Is no secret that Secretary Gage
is mortified not over the fact that Bid
well is to be retired but because Bldwell's
successor was selected and the news pub
lished without the Secretary's knowledge.
President Roosevelt Is Quite as embar
rassed as the Secretary of the Treasury.
No one can say what Secretary Gage will
do, but his friends do not look for him
to retire from the Cabinet. He is not a
narrow and vindictive man, and not one
to leave an important post in a pet.
Stranahan, after his call upon the Presi
dent to-day, made the following state
ment:
President Roosevelt to-day tendered me the
office of Collector of the Port of New York
with the understanding that I shall assume
Its duties April 1 next. Such an arrangement
would permit me to do my winter's work at
Albany. I am especially anxious to finish my
term as Senator in justice to my constituency
and also in the hope that as chairman of the
committee on cities I may be able to aid thÂ«
administration of Mayor Low and assist the
policies of Governor Odell. The revised char
ter will undoubtedly require attention from the
Legislature, and my work in connection with
that has familiarized me with the subject.
The office of Collector comes to me abso
lutely unsought, and, I may say, with the
cordial concurrence of the President and Sen
ator Plate The Senator undoubtedly desired
the reappolntment of Bldwell. but If this was
not to be done, he is entirely satisfied with
me. No suggestions as to my policy in tht
office has been made to me or condition coupled
with the appointment, except that I Â»ivÂ« the
best possible administration in my power. In
the belief that In faithful public service is to
be found the greatest advantage to one's
party.
During the afternoon Stranahan called
upon the members of the Civil Service
Commission and had an extended inter
view with them. While no details are
given out, the members of the commis
sion expressed themselves after the con
ference as being of the opinion that the
civil service law would be enforced
strongly in the office of the Collector of
Customs of New York, in which Strana
han takes his position as the head.

RENEWS ATTACK
ON HUMPHREYS
Hawaiian Bar Associa
tion After Judge of
the Circuit Court^
Accuses Him of Insulting
and Misrepresenting
Attorneys.
HONOLULU. Nov. 9.â At a special
meeting held on the evening of November
6 the Hawaiian Bar Association, by a
vote of 28 to 4, placed itself on record as
Sticking to its position in the matter of
the charges against .Judge A. S. Humph
reys of the First Ciicult Court, in spite
of the decision of United States Attorney
General Knox sustaining the Judge. Tne
committee appointed last June to formu
late charges against the Judge presented
a lengthy report, in wliich the Judge's re
ply, as made at Washington, is severely
criticized and some of the conclusions of
the Attorney General are also adversely
The report was read to the members by
Cecil Brown, chairman of the committee
which made up the charges for presenta
tion and sent Attorney V. W. Hankey to
Washington to represent the association.
It dealt with each of the five counts that
were discussed and disposed of In the re
port that Knox mada to tha President,
and clearly showed that the conclusions
reached by the executives at Washington
were not convincing to the members of
the committee.
Humphreys ;Â« further attacked in tne
report on account of the reply he made
at Washington. It id declared that in
stating that some or his disagreements
with lawyers were due to his refusals to
discuss cases outside of the courtroom
with them he Intimated that Honolulu
lawyers were in the habit of attempting
to so discuss oases, and misrepresented
and insulted the Hawahan bar. As to one
of Attorney General Knox'a conclusions,
with regard to the charge that Humph
reys employed a bailiff who was not a fit
person to serve in such a position. Knox s
statement being that the charge was too
trivial for comment. *.he report says that
the committee desires o enter a protest
against such a conclusion, and adds: "To
hold that the deliberate appointment of
an unfit bailiff, clothed with the powers
incident to tha; offio- in this Territory, is
too trivial to be considered, calls for pro
test " Attention Is called to the fact that
the bailiff has the pewer to select and
summon jurors.
The report concludes by mentioning the
fact that dispatcnes from Washington in
dicate that a commission may come to
Hawaii to investigate matters here, and
expresses the hope that such a commis
sion will come.
There was some earnest discussion be
fore the report was adopted. Among the
twenty-eight who voted for It four were
new members of the Bar Association
who had just joined. The other twenty
four were among the thirty-seven who
instituted the proceedings against Hum
phreys. The association decided to print
and circulate copies of its report as
adopted.
The local papers all comment upon the
report of the Bar Association. The Ad
vertiser says: "If such analysis of the
charges and of the Judge's reply had
been presented to Attorney General Knox
there can be little doubt that the result
would have been different." It also pays
that the fact that the Attorney General
has acquitted Judge Humphreys of the
charges does not prove their untruth and
that time will show that the charges
were well founded. The Star, wheih
stands with tha- Advertiser. <lo the con
troversy, says: "The Bar Association haÂ»
put itself on record as thoroughly deter
mined that what charges it made were
correct, and It does not matter ene straw
whether there was an exoneration upon
a garbled defense or not, the Hawaiian
Bar Association stood to its colors and
was not to be browbeaten by either an
officeholder here or a Cabinet Minister In
Washington."
On the other hand, the Republican and
Bulletin and the weekly Volcano charge
that the action of the association is a
renewal of the political fight against
Humphreys. The Bulletin refers to the
"Dole-Thurston Bar Association and po
litical ring as trying to overrule Knox
and Roosevelt and working against
American ideals in the Territory. The
Republican takes the same line.
Judge Humphreys has resumed his
place on the bench and was presfding
Judge of the First Circuit Court during
the past week.
After a fight till he is 50 to get some
thing to put in his inside, the average
man has to spend the surplus he has
saved to have a doctor cut something out
What bright things we say In repartee
in conversations we imagine!

Send me no money, but simply writÂ© a

I will send with ft an order on your

it a month. If it cures, the cost will be
15.50. If It fails, he sends the bill to. me.

make the organs do their duty. I have
spent a lifetime on it. â
I sometimes fall, but only when the
trouble is organicâ some trouble like can-
cer that causes a damage beyond repair.
Such conditions are rare. My records
show that 39 out of 40 who get those six
bottles pay for them. Yet no druggist ac-
cepts a penny where ' the patient states
that the treatment failed.
This offer is too fair to need argument.

it. Won't you write me a postal to learn

Themselves as Satised With
Boosevelt's Views.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 16.-Senators Du
bota and " Heitfeld of. Idaho were amons
the President'^ callers to-day. While thÂ©
Senators called primarily to lay th- re
spects' to the President, they Incidentally
â¢Ji9cus*e-1 nitU hi"* lecialatwn in whirti
the West is particularly interested. Pre^!
dent Roosevelt- laughingly recalled an in
cident of the last inauguration, when hÂ«s.
as Vice President In the chair, and Sen
ator Heitfeld on thÂ« floor, were the only
persons In the Senate chamber. Thpy
concluded the business of the day and on
notion of the Idaho Senator adjourn-^
Ihe President also recalled lira fact that
Senator Duboia is a graduate of Yala,
and expressed pleasure that so many
Yale men were in Consress. Senator Du
bois replied tfcat while he was a Yale
man. he was a Democrat, and had called

After the call tcth Senators expressed
themselves as satisfied with the Presi
dent's vlears en legislation for the West.
â¢'The President remarked," said Senator
Dubols, â¢ "that he was a Western maa
himself. I guess that is right."
Senator Dubois, who returns to the Sen
ate after an absence of four years, is a*
stanch a. Democrat now as he was a
vigorous Republican when he was elected
the first time. During: hiÂ» first term he
was a member of the Republican steerinj
committee and secretary of the Republl
can caucus, and because of his experience
he is being urged by his Democratic as
sociates for a position on the Democratic
steering committee.

PRISON GUARD
DIES OF WOUND
LEAVEN WORTH, Kans., Nov. 16â J.
B. Waldrupe, a guard at the Fort Leav
enworth military prison, who was shot
during the mutiny at that institution No
vember 7, died to-day of his wounds.
Twenty-six mutineers now become liable
to a charge of murder. It is generally
supposed that Frank Thompson, the ne
gro who led the revolt, fired the shot that
caused Waldrupe's d-ath. Thompson is
one of the seventeen convicts who have
been captured since toe outbreak.
Walcrupe was born in Greenback,
Term., in 1876. He 3erved in Cuba during
the Spanish war in the United States vol
unteer signal corps, later becoming a
guard at the prison. During the mutiny
Waldrupe was stationed in a tower on the
stockade. In the fight that ensued he was
shot in the hip. He fell to the floor, but
raise-l himself and filed into the crowd,
killing Quinn Fort, one of the ringleaders.
A moment latÂ«r Waldrupe, while in the
act of firing again, was struck between
the eyes with a pistol bullet. Then sev
eral convicts ran up to the tower to se
cure his weapons. Waldrupe, although
mortally wounded, clubbed the first man
down with his rifle, but was too weak to
further defend himseif, and was rescued
by other guards.

fainting spells in the basement of the
bank, where the experts were at work.

that he was most conscientious and trust
worthy. Corbett died early this month.

in existence for fifty years. Its present
assets are $48,615,961, ?nd its liabilities, in
cluding interest due depositors to July 1,

GOES TO PRISON
CHICAGO, Nov. 16.â Judge Hanecy to
day passed sentence on Andrew M. Law
rence, managing editor, and H. S. Can
field, reporter of W. R. Hearst's Chicago
American, for contempt of court and
committed them to forty and thirty days'
imprisonment respectively in the County

An effort was made by the attorneys
for the defendants to secure a writ of
habeas corpus from Judge Dunne before
the men were actually lodged in jail, but
were unsuccessful.
Later on, a petition having been drawn
up in behalf of Lawrence and Canfield,
Judge Dunne issued a mandate command
ing the Sheriff to bring them before ha
court.
The men were confined in jail only forty
minutes, and when they appeared before
Jud^e Dunne they were released on bonds
of .53000 each, pending the hearing of the
petition for the writ of habeas corpus
on November 25.

BIG TRANSPORT
CAUSES ANXIETY
Special Correspondence of the Cmll.
HONOLULU, Nov. 10.â There was a
scare in army and navy circles last night.
When the transport Kllpatrick arrived at
10 o'clock she anchored in the roadstead
immediately after rounding Diamond
Head. The lookout at that point thought
the transport lay too close Inshore and,
after observing that she did not move
after lying there some time, notified Ma
jor Robinson, quartermaster of the United
States army post, of his fears for the
safety of the vessel.
Major Robinson took immediate action.
He chartered the SpreckelS tug Fearless
to go out to the Kilpatrick and he called
out a picket of the Sixth Coast Artillery
from Camp McKinley to patrol the beach
opposite the vessel's anchorage.
When the Fearless hailed the Kilpat
rick it was found that everything was
quiet, with no thought of danger on'
board. The big ship, with her precious
freight of hundreds of human lives, was,
however, in a dangerous position. A
strong southerly gale, liable to occur at
any time this season, would have put the
Kilpatrick in peril of being piled upon a
ragged reef, where several vessels have
in times past come to grief. Captain M
N. Sanders, the Honolulu pilot, who went
out to the transport, hailed Captain Bro
kaw of the Fearless to inform him that
when he reached the ship she had already
anchored.

SINCE PATTI'S TIME NO VOICE
OF ALL THE LYRIC SOPRANOS
HAS CHARMED LIKE SEMBRICH'S
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
ONLY Calve now remains to be
hoard of all Mr. Grau's great
company at the Grand Opera
house. This week Eames, De
Marohi, Louise Reuss-Ec-lce,
ficmbrich and Sanderson have been add
ed to our vocal experience?, and they are
indeed rich additions. Vocally, Sembnch
outweighs any and all of the whole com
pany, even Melba, who is lifting her lyric
note elsewhere this season. Since Mr.
Or&u has the flower of the vocal talent
of the whole world, Sembrich is probably
the greatest living singer among the lyric
sopranos. Since Patti's time no such
perfect vocalism has been heard here.
The singer has complete control of the
whole mechanism of the voice. She sings
absolutely without effort, her intonation
rfeel that one nevpr remembers that
there- i<= such a thing as pitch while she
is singing. Technically Sembrich's work
Is a marvel, but on 3 never dreams of
technique in the connection. Here is the
art that conceals art so gloriously that
one is fooled for the nonce into believing
that it is only to open one's mouth to do
tho name thing. Alas and alack.
The diva's phrasing is a constant de
light and her Male? and trills and the
bewitching little roulades in which "La
Traviata " abounds for her opportunity
would mean an adjectival debauch for
ihcir adequate description. She has a de
licicus staccato â like drops of warm
spring rain glittering in an April sun
light, clean cut as jewels every note, a
pianissimo like the dream of a sound, a
miraculous legato and a compass to
which E in alt is simple fun. In fact
Bcmbrich does just as she pleases with
the most wonderful voice now known to
lame, a voice of which the last silken
thread is purest music.
But it is as much the big. warm heart
shining through her song that differen
tiates Sembrich from other singers as her
phenomenal vocal gifiÃ. She is no mere
music box, descending to musical acro
batics for their own sake, but it so hap
pens that hers is the lyric genius, the
lyric opera her vocal metier, and we may
comfortably thank God for both of them.
The world is surely large enough for both
Wagner and Verdi, Mozart and Rossini,
Puccini and Gounod, Sembrich and
Eames. and let us therefore rejoice in
their differing gifts and give thanks.

Eamos 6ings Wagner mostly, and is one
of the mos-t lavishly gifted singers that
Mr. Grau has ro far bestowed upon us.
The quality of her voice that impresses
most strongly is its lovely purity, with
the freghntss of May mornings and cool
mountain springs about it. It has a lyric
note, is deliciouely flexible, and she sings
with much power and distinction. She is
possessed also of the genius of grace
both in her acting and singing, the gift of
restraint in exquisite measure, and her
Elisabeth and Blsa now rank with the
most artistic things the season has yet
seen, or will see.

MTTSIC M-A-TJIjIKra-.
ON Friday night a much reduced audience listened at the Grand Opera-house to what
Wagner regard ir l as his masterpiece. The action and the music fell upon apprecia
tive ears, and also upon too many empty seats to do adequate honor to that great soul
which heard the far sound of the music of the future, and wrote the score that was to
appeal to generations waiting to be born. One has appeared since he wrote and passed on, and it
seemed to have sent a committee to represent it at the performance of "Die Walkuere" on Friday
night. Nothing can obscure the stateliness of the Wagnerian measure, and his work was ren
dered so that the master himself, if present in the flesh, would have felt that his genius had not
been spent in vain. The committee present saw once more the ruler of Walhalla, and the great
chorus captured every sound that runs, from the tempest to the lark's song, and made every tone
and cadence do its duty.
The committee was enthusiastic, and cheers and applause were not lacking, and the audi
ence was as warm as any that ever sat under Wagner's spell at Bayreuth, but the generation, part
of that future for which Wagner wrote, was not there. It was at the Pavilion, where it had paid
an admission averaging more than fifty cents a minute, to see two prize-fighters raise welts on
each other's brawn. That audience manifested itself at 9 o'clock in the morning, though the first
blow was not to be struck until 9 o'clock at night. The queue of waiters grew until it wound
clear around the Pavilion like a Chinaman's queue around his shaven pate, and when there was a
delay of fifteen minutes in opening the. doors the police had to suppress ,he disorder and compel
the crowd, in the language of the occasion, to "chew the rag" more quietly. When the doors
opened and expectancy and eagerness burst into the shell, there was a wild scramble for the best
seats from which every blow might be seen, and every cringe under punishment noted, and every
flinch enjoyed, for had they not paid for these elevating pleasures?
Promptly on time two men entered the ring to fight for ro cause which excuses combat.
Men fight to avenge honor, to repay an insult, in behalf of wife, or sweetheart, or friend, or
country. But neither of these fighters had any of these motives. They were members of the same
"profession" â that of breaking skin and bones for a money consideration. They had no quarrel,
no grudge to settle, no abraded honor to Leal with their hard fists. They came to pound each
other to a finish in cold blood, and the generation for which Wagner wrote music was there to
see them do it.
This audience was critical, and it decided that the entertainment was a failure. It had paid
for more mauling, more*blood, more flinching, falling, fainting and knocking out than it got for its
money. The ruler of Walhalla was not there. Instead of Wotan and Hunding there were two per
formers who had trained to give and take punishment for a division of the gate money. One of
them did not reach the mark of his high calling. He failed in the fifth act, and those who had ad
mired him, bet on him and paid their money to see him stand up reviled him when he fell down.
They expressed their opinion of him in all languages, including the profane, and the more
superstitious said that it came of fighting on Friday!
Can it be possible that Wagner did not hear in his inner ear the future's music? Can it
be that the stately harmony that he interpreted was the song of his own soul, the voice of the
tense chords of his own heart, heard as we hear voices in profound silence and a part of that
silence which they seem to break?
Can it be possible that if he had heard the music of this part of that future it would have been
the banging of a gong summoning two men to jump over the -opes and into a ring where they beat
irregular time on each other's ribs, until one takes a fall and the other lakes the championship
of the world's bruisers?
THE EXCLUSION ACT.
THAT public interest in the exclusion of Chinese is but little abated in California is
proved by the delegation of a large convention to meet in this city on the 21st instant to
raise the voice of the State in favor of the re-enactment of the Geary law.
This convention will deal with the new factors which have appeared with the change
of our commercial position in China. It will devise advice by which our white labor and wages
can be protected against Chinese competition, and our commerce be at the same time un
prejudiced.
The Call sees no reason to change the attitude of the State upon the general question of
exclusion. Since this law followed the amended treaty ten years ago the State has prospered,
and labor has found its rewards increased, while it is not in evidence that any interest has pro
foundly suffered for lack of workmen.
In that period, too, the wages of the Chinese among us have been lifted toward the white
plane, and Chinese cheap labor is a thing of the past. It may sound strangely in the East, but it is
probable that some of the stoutest believers in Chinese exclusion are to be found among the
Chinese themselves. In some respects they are the keenest of the races and at the same time have less
racial ties than any other. The Chinese here, who are getting very high wages now, are about as
much opposed to the admission of more as are white wage-workers, for they know that to open the
door again to their people means a fall in Chinese wages to the old standard which made their
presence here so offensive.
It is an interesting illustration of the community of interest being stronger than racial ties.
The Call is part and parcel of the sentiment of this State that stands for continued exclusion. We
are not aware that there is any change on the subject anywhere on the coast or in the inter
mountain States, where the original exclusion movement was seated. It is said that the East and
South have undergone some change of sentiment, but this remains to be demonstrated by the
votes of their members of Congress.
Fortunately, our Government has held such an attitude of friendship for China in her ex
isting misfortunes that she is in no mood to resent further exclusion of her coolies. In fact, we
have sacrificed much in standing for justice to her in the hour of her peril. We are not asking to
invade her dominion by any class of our people, and she will no doubt recognize the need of exact
reciprocity in that respect. We think that even our missionaries might be withdrawn as an offset
to the withdrawal of Chinese now here, and both nations would profit by the policy.
THE CHARLESTON EXPOSITION.
DESPITE the ill success, of the Buffalo Exposition from a financial point of view, the
promoters of the Charleston Exposition are sanguine their enterprise will prove prof
itable as well as beneficial in other ways. It is quite probable that their hopes may be
well founded, for the outlay at Charleston has been nothing like that at Buffalo, while
the attendance promises to be much larger in proportion to expenditure.
The managers of the great railway lines running through the South have for many years
been pursuing a liberal policy in the matter of making rates for the purpose of promoting immi
gration to the South and building up that section of the country. In accord with that policy it is
stated they have fixed rates to the Charleston Exposition 30 per cent lower than the rates Â°-iven
for Buffalo. The exposition managers are doing their best to make the city attractive to tourists
and to that end it is "announced they have arranged with private families and boarding-houses for
more than 10,000 lodgings, at which the charges will be as moderate as at ordinary times.
The chief object of the. enterprise is to provide an exposition of the products which make up
the bulk of the trade between the United States and the West Indies. How far that object will
be attained remains to be seen. The exposition at Buffato was intended to be Pan-American, but
very few South American countries took any considerable part in it. There may be a similar fall
ing off in the West Indian features of the Charleston Exposition. Under any circumstances, how
ever, the exposition will be the best of its kind ever held in the South, and will doubtless do much
to advance the welfare of the city whose enterprise has made it possible.
It is announced that the Agricultural Department will extend the free seed distribution to
the Philippines, and we will thus begin to encourage the shiftless natives to expect something for
nothing, and in the end they may imitate the Indians and clamor for rations.
The fact that 180 Cape Colony troops of the Dutch race surrendered to the Boers after a
poor pretense of righting contains a warning to the British of what may yet happen in Cape Col
ony if the war be not brought to a speedy conclusion.
It seems to be the opinion of most of the sports who attended the prize-fight that they would
have got a better show for their money if they had gone to the opera.
WHEN FOOTBALL AND ART MEET
IN THE LIME LIGHTS GLARE
THE ATHLETES ALWAYS TRIUMPH
THERE is no use in caviling at the
fact that nhere football and art
are concerned the score is going
to be 2âo every time with the tri
umphant young athletes who havo
just succeeded in kicking their friendly
rivals' score into the middle of next week.
SUII, it is a pity that the Berkeley boys
should not have been able to restrain
their very natural enthusiasm on the
night of the game a little longer, to per
mit of the excellent rendering of "The
Fantasticks," the college play of the year,
being heard to its close, for it was Quite
one of the best things that has been done
by the university. But, indeed. Rostand'^
enchanting fantasy was listened to with
remarkable respect under the exciting
circumstances, and but for incidental di
vertisements by a few irrepressibles was
accorded unusual attention, both by the
university and lay audience.
The comedy was evidently enjoyed on
Its own merits, and disclosed an unex
pected fitness for use on such occasions.
The interpretation was notably good, and
in at least one instance in the cast Pro
fessor Louis BuPont Syle, under whose
direction the play was given, appears to
have discovered histrionic talent of no
mean order. The version of "The Fantas
ticks" used was the translation by George
Fleming, and Professor Syle was assisted
In its direction by Vere W. Hunter. The
play was well staged, appropriately cos
tumed and deft in its stage management.
Of the players for whom it is not
difficult to prophesy histrionic distinction
if they should turn their attention that
way, E. B. Harris, who essayed very suc
cessfully the delicately ridiculous role of
the hero, Percinet. is easily first. He play
ed the part of the sugar-candy Prince
Charming with exactly the right loftily
absurd accent, and spoke hia lines with a
full measure of appreciation of their
poetry. Mr. Harris' voice 13 not so full as j
It might be, but otherwise he seems gen- i
erously equipped for the stage. His ges- J
tures are easy and graceful, his personal j
gifts considerable and his Percinet of the \
other night shamed the work of many
professionals.
J. W. S. Butler, who portrayed the
father of Percinet, also did some very !
good acting; Miss E. C. Howard was a !
charming Sylvette. and the parts of Fas- j
quin, Sylvette's father, and Straforel.
captain of the bravos, were well taken
by A. J. Todd and J. R. Carter re
spectively. Altogether, the performance
was on a much higher level than the
usual college play, and every" credit Is
due to Professor Syle and his clever
young people for adventuring into the
higher comedy realms and with such
marked success. It leaves one with a
strong desire to see "The Fantasticks"
with the best the stage has to bring to
its interpretation.

To-night at the Columbia begins the.
engagement of Willie Collier, possibly the
cleverest comedian in his class now on |
the boards. Willie brings with him this |
time Augustus Thomas' new farce com- I
edy, "On the Quiet," that enjoyed last !
season an uninterrupted run of six j
months at the Madison Square Theater,
New York. Nat Goodwin had the first
refusal of the piece, and it lay for a
twelvemonth in Goodwin' 3 pocket un
used. Then Willie Collier saw it and
made it his own immediately, with the
above happy result. Goodwin afterward
saw Collier in the play in New York and
said to him after It was over, "You're a
cleverer fellow than I am, Willie! If I
had seen in the farce anything like you
have made of it you would not have
been playing it now. Not much:"
But Mr. Collier has the farce and it Is
said to fit him like his skin, as well as to
afford his excellent supporting company
no end of good opportunities.
"On the Quiet" is clean, legitimate
fun throughout say those who have
seen it, and a lavish relief to the noisome
Palais Royal farces with which the lat
ter-day stage has been aeluged, the breed
even lately invading the dramatic sancti
ties of our little Alcazar Theater. But
"On the Quiet" Is the other story. it 3

marriage she loses a large fortune But
tho lovers cannot wait and there is a
secret wedding. Then arise the complica

elope with his own wife, and the difficul

the audience in a white heat of merri

MONTANA TRAIN
ROBBER WEAKENS
Pleads Not Guilty When
Arraigned on Federal
Indictments.
ST. LOUIS. Nov. 16.-The Montana
train robber suspect has acknowledged
that he is Ben Kilpatrick, a brother of
Don Kilpatrick. Both are said to have
been members of the gang of train rob
bers led by "Bill" Carver, who was killed
last spring. He admitted that he was
reared near Paint Rock, Tex.
Sheriff Crawford of Chouteau County,
Mont., has arrived here to 'see the pris
oner. The Sheriff and County Attorney
Pray of Chouteau County were on their
way here with requisition papers, when a
im reached them at St. Paul that
the prisoner was to be tried in St. Louis.
Pray returned to Montana and Sherilf
Crawford came on to St. Louis unofficial
ly to get a look at one of the men he had
chased so hard last summer.
Ben Kilpatrick, indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury as "Jonn Arnold," alias
Harry Longbaugh, alias Harvey Logan,
the supposed Montana train robber, was
arraigned for a second time before judg-
Adams in the United States District Court
to-day. At his first arraignment Thurs
day the train robber suspect declined to
plead to the charges against him of hav
ing and passing money not legal tender.
To-day, however, he pleaded not guilty,
and when Judge Adams astced the pris
:f Im wished the court to appoint
counsel for him, Kilpatrick answered that
he did not.
"1 will hire a lawyer myself." he said.
The Bullion woman also pleaded not
guilty, but said she had no money to em
ploy counsel and wished the court to ap
point an attorney to defend her. Judge
Adams designated Judge Thomas P. Ba
fhaw as her counsel. The case was set for
trial December 12.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
GATHMANN GUN
NOT A SUCCESS
Two Torpedoes Are
Fired at Target a
Mile Away.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â The Gathmann
aerial torpedo and the big eighteen-inch
gun were tried at the proving ground at
Sandy Hook again to-day. Two shots
were fired, and the heavy charge of wet
gun cotton with which each shell was
loaded was detonated.
The first torpedo fired did not damage
the plate or backing to any extent. The
second was more successful, cracking the
plate from top to bottom and doing much
damage to the bracing. Each shell con
tained 500 pounds of wet guncotton, and
216 pounds of powder were used to drive
them from the gun.
The tirst shot was fired shortly before
noon. The shell was placed on a carriage
and then inserted in the big gun. The
target was a mile away. Captain E. B.
Babbitt gave the signal and the gunners
who were stationed before a shelter a
quarter of a mile off, fired the gun by
electricity. A puff of white smoke was
seen and two explosions in quick succes
sion followed. The last report was very
heavy and the target was enveloped in a
cloud of thick smoke. It looked lrom the
bombproofs, about a mile from the gun,
as if the target had been shattered. The
spectators, when they reached the target,
were greatly surprised to see it standing
apparently uninjured, except for a dent
where the shell struck. The plate had
been driven back about eighteen inches
and the backing displaced slightly. The
full force of 5<H) pounds of the wet gun
cotton, instead of wrecking the target,
was expended in the air.
Gathmann was greatly disappointed by
the result. He made a careful examina
tion of the gun, and after satisfying him
self that it was in good order, asked and
received permission to fire another hhot
The gun was then fired with 310 pounds of
powder, which gave the projectile a muz
zle velocity of 40.000 foot tons. It was
directed to the left side of the plate and
when the shell hit it the coffer dam was
considerably damaged and several bolts
were knocked off and the end of the plate
which was struck was shifted about a
foot and a half. The back of the plate
was also cracked. Gathmann claims a
partial victory.
The Herald will say to-morrow: As a
result of the day's experiments Gathmann
declares that while his shell has not done
all he claims for it, he still believes that
it has shown sufficient merit to warrant
further trial. He says that if these shells
had been exploded against the side of a
battleship the racking effect would have
been sufficient to put the vessel out of
action. The ordnance experts who wit
nessed the tests differ, and say that the
result was normal only, and that prac
tically the same effect would have been
produced had the shell been filled with

FORMER QUEEN
OF HAWAII HERE
Liliuokalani Arrives on
Mission to Wash
ington.
Hopes to Be Repaid for the
Crown Lands Taken
From Her.
Ex-Queen Llliuokalani of Hawaii ar
rived in this city oa the steamship China
yesterday on a diplomatic mission to the
United States Government at Washing
ton. The Queen is accompanied by her
wards, Joseph Aea, John D. Aimoku arid
Miss Myra Heleluhe, and all will occupy
apartments at the California Hotel until
Thursday, when the journey to Washing
ton will be, made.
Efforts to see Liliuokalani last night
proved fruitless. She sent word that she
was too fatigued to see visitors and that
she had nothing of Interest to say to vne
American public through the medium of
the press. She designated Colonel George
W. Macfarlane as her spokesman, and to
a Call reporter he said:
The Queen is combining business with pleas
ure on her trip to the United States. She has
not been in the beat of health tor some time,
but at present she is feeling quite well. The
report circulated on the occasion of her last
visit here that she was suffering from cancer
proved to be baseless. She has come here to
consult with the Federal authorities relative to
the crown lands in Hawaii. These were se
questrated by the revolutionary government at
the time the monarchy was overthrown, and
not attempt has since been made to reimbursi
her for the loss of the crown revenues amount
ing to some $100,000 a year. The Territorial
Legislature passed a bill appropriating $250,000
for the crown lands, but .President Dole ve
toed the bill on the ground that there was no:
enough money in the treasury to pay the claim.
Subsequently the Legislature offered to grant
her a uehsion of $25,0U0 a year, but she retusei
to accept the money for the reason that it
would place her in the list of charitablos, a
etep that was exceedingly repugnant to her.
Before the annexation of the islands she was
advised by competent attorneys to submit her
claim to Kngland for arbitration. The crown
lands are over a million acres in extent and are
worth about 115,000,000. She did not like the
idea, and now that ihe islands are a Territory
of the United States she has decided to appeal
to President Roosevelt and Congress to do her
justice. The lan^s in question are made up of
the most valuable sugar plantations in the isl
ands, and the title to the whole of it is vested
in her absolutely.
The Queen has decided to educate her
wards in this country. She has an in
come of J20.0U0 a year, the greater part of
which is devoted to charity. She will bg
the recipient of social attentions by the
Hawaiian colony during her stay in San
Francisco.

GENTLEMAN BURGLAR GETS
SENTENCE OF TEN YEARS
Polite Thief Will Spend a Decade
in a Cell at
Folsom.
Judge Dunne sentenced Robert Stone, th>
"gentleman burglar," to imprisonment at
Folsom for ten years yesterday. Stone's
counsel made an earnest plea for leniency,
but it availed the prisoner little, as Judge
Dunne held that he was guilty of bur
glary in the first degree and dealt with
him accordingly.
Stone, whose right name is Thompson,
took his sentence without showing a trace
of excitement or any display of feeling.
He took It as he has taken everything
elseâ "like a gentleman."
The crime for which Stone was sen
tenced was committed at the residence of
Mrs. ikammond. A second charge of bur
glary is standing against him on account
of a raid he made on the clothes closet
of Arthur Callaghan. The second charge
was ordered placed on the reserved crim
inal calendar.
Professor Frederick Starr says no one
should go to college "except from a gen
uine desire to learn." If this rule were
strictly followed ln education few school
houses would be needed.
RUBBER COMPANY SUED
FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
Joseph M. Sinley Claims He Has Lost
54500 Through the Trans
action.
Joseph M. Kinley filed a suit against
the Lazacualta Rubber Plantation Com
pany and O. H. Harrison, manager of the
concern, yesterday for $4500, which he al
leges he lost through the failure of the
company to keep a contract it made with
him.
According to the complaint Kinley had
an agreement with the company whereby
in consideration of his procuring an ad
vance of $10,000 he was to have the sale of
10,000 shares of stock n the company and
the privilege of naming an agent in New
York, who was to haruiie all the goods of
the company. He prevailed upon Flint,
Eddy & Co. of New York. Kinley claims,
to advance the money, and named them
as agents.
The rubber company, he alleges, failed
to live up to Its agreement, and by reason
of its failure he has suffered a loss of
$4500.
As soon as we know the worst, people
will take their loss more philosophically.
Just now we don't know what to expect.

Two wonderful new books, entitled "Success

of the ablest specialists of modern times. ThÂ»

that 10.000 copies should be distributed to the
public free of charge. The Columbia Scientific

and until the edition of 10.000 copies Is ex-
hausted you can get copies of both these books
absolutely free. Both books are profusely Illus-

and startling surprises, and they thoroughly
explain the real source of the power of per-
sonal influence. They fully and completely
reveal the fundamental principles of success

Not lon* ago John D. Rockefeller, the richest
man In America, said. In talking to a Sunday-
school class, that he regarded his success in
life largely to his ability to influence others. |
Lincoln, "Lee, Napoleon end Alexander the '
Great all Â¦won fame and renown by their won-

piled up millions by this same ' power. J. P.
Morgan organized the billion-dollar steel trust
or.d enriched himself by millions simply by
his marvelous ability to Influence others. There
are to-day thousands of men with twice the
brains and education of Mr. Morgan who are
practically paupers. They have the ability to
organize a trust, but they have not sufficient
power of personal influence. Personal influence,

In every human being. By the late methods
explained by the New York specialists in hu-
man culture any Intelligent person can develop
a wonderfully magnetic personality and learn
how to read the character, secrets and the lives
of others in a few days' study tt his own home.
Tou can use this marvelous power without the
knowledge of your most intimate friends and
associates. Tou can use it to obtain lucrative
employment, to secure an advance in salary, to
win the friendship and Influence of others, to
obtain a greater share of happiness from life.
Tou can be respected, honored and become a

Mrs. R. C. Young of 312 Indiana street, Law-

testing the methods of personal influence on
her friends and associates, she makes the fol-
lowing statement in a letter to a friend: 'The
instructions^ given by the Columbia Scientific
Academy have been worth to me more than all
the previous reading of my life. I wish every
woman in this country could read their grand
books."
Fred Perkins of South Haven, Michigan, says:
"I have been in great demand since I read the
works of the Columbia Scientific Academy.
People are amazed and mystified at the things
I do. ! believe I could make {25 per day read-

THREE ATTEMPTS
TO BURN HOTEL
Work of an Incendiary
Arouses Citizens of
Los Gatos.
Recent Comflagration Is Now
Charged to the Un
known Miscreant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 16.â The people of Los
Gatos are aroused over repeated attempts
of a firebug to burn the El Monte Hotel
at that place, and summary Justice will
be dealt to the Incendiary of he be caught.
Last week there were two attempts to set
the building on fire, and last night a third
effort was made. John Newell, the pro
prietor of the hotel, is unable to account
tor this work of a supposed enemy. A
watch is constantly maintained.
Last night, while Newell and two others
were keeping watch, the firebug sneaked
up and started a fire under the kitchen.
Some old pieces of carpet and two or
three night robes saturated with coal oil
had been placed under the woodwork and
set ablaze. The flames were quickly ex
tinguished. The firebug was not seen.
Many mysterious fires have occurred in
Los Gatos lately which are believed to
have been the work of an incendiary, and
many now believe the great fire of a
month ago, which burned nearly half the
town, was started by this miscreant. A
vigilance committee is talked of to mete
out punishment to the incendiary if he be
caught.
TESTS AT SANDY HOOK
PROVE SATISFACTORY
New Army Bdfle Drives Twelve-Inch
Shell Through Eleven-
Inch Plate.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â The ordnance
officers and the artillery experts at the
War Department are pleased with the ex
cellent work of the army twelve-inch rifle
at Sandy Hook. Colonel Randolph, chief
of artillery, said the test proved that it
was practicable to drive a twelve-inch
shell through the side of an ironclad and
to explode it with precision in the in
terior. The ship does not float, he said,
that could withstand the effects of such
an explosion in, her interior. It certainly
would paralyze all the sailors it did not
kill and put the ship out of action.
Major Smith, one of the ordnance ex
perts, declared that this was the first
time that an explosive shell had been put
through an eleven-inch plate of this qual
ity.
It was a striking demonstration of the
proof of the claims of the ordnance de
partment that it had developed the best
high explosive and fuse in the world. The
department now possesses two explosives
of this character, with one of which the
shell fired from the new rifle yesterday
was loaded. The fuse was developed by
Captain Dunn at the Frankfort arsenal.
BIGAITDS REDUCE
AMOUNT OF RANSOM
Miss Stone's Captors Are Now Will
ing to Accept Fifteen Thou
sand Founds.
SOFIA, Nov. 16.â The brigands who cap
tured Miss Ellen M. Stone and Madame
Tsilka have reduced the amount of ran
som they demand to Â£20,000 Turkish. Co
incident with this intelligence is the in
formation that the leaders of the band, if
convinced that this is more than Dickin
son will give, would accept Â£15,000. Even
this sum is greatly beyond the cash at
Dickinson's disposal. Therefore, unless
the captors of the missionary further
abate their demands, there is no hope of
an immediate settlement.
An agent who is in touch with the brig
ands reports that they recognize they
made a mistake in kidnaping Miss Stone.
They would, however, consider it worse
than a blunder to release her without an
adequate ransom.
There is no longer any fear regarding
the brigands' intentions toward the cap
tive?. They declare themselves to be not
robbers, but patriots, performing an ob
noxious task in the interests of a holy
cause. The majority of the kidnapers are
peasants and farmers, directed by a secret
committee, who rule its decisions.
SAN JACINTO FOREST
LANDS FOR SETTLERS
Three Townships to Be Thrown Open
to Homesteaders in
January.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16.â An important
document, signed by President Roosevelt,
has been received in the local United
States land office, and its contents first
became known to-day. It means that in
the immediate future more than 70,000
acres of valuable lar.d in Southern Cali
fornia will be thrown open to settlement.
The tract is on the San Jaclnto forest re
serve and is officially designated as Town
ships 8, 9 and 10, range 8 east. This is one
of the sections that the forest survey ar
bitrarily took in when the reserve was
created, in 1897, though it was not forest
land.
The region lies south of Indlo, not far
from the line of the Southern Pacific
Railroad, with tne towns of Walters and
Thermal situated along its edge. Ever
since the development of water there
v.oul'i-be eettlen have been c'.amoring to
have J .he land eliminated from the pro
hibited zone of the forest reserve.
The three townships will be opened Jan

will be subject to entry In the land of

be adapted to every form of agriculture.

Important Strongholds of the Republic
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VENEZUELA. WHO IS GREATLY ALARMED
BY THE SPREAD AND MAGNITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION WITH

PORT OF SPAIN, Nov. 16.â Tho
revolution in Venezuela is spread
ing, and President Castro is
alarmed at the magnitude of the
insurrection. He mistrusts tho
members of his cabinet. He lost confi
dence in Senor Velutini, Minister of tho

Was so Acknowledged.
"He had been hanging around my girl
for some time," said a well-known North
Ender, "and I saw that unless something
was done before long he would soon be
come a merrfber of the family. I had
frowned upon the matter right from the
start, as I didn't think he was good
enough for my daughter. But from the
beginning I simply constituted a hopeless
minority, as my wife thought he was a
perfect paragon. I I knew better
and when one Sunday I saw him at a ball
game I was sure of It.
"Now, I am a great lover of the Amer
ican game and Sunday is the only day
that I have time to attend. I have al
ways been very careful to keep from my
wife the fact that I ever attended a game
of ball on Sunday, as she is a very strict
church member and views with horror
any one who seeks pleasure on the Sab
bath. So, when I saw the young man
there at the game I thought I had found
a way to bring her over to my side, know
ing full well that if I did his chances of
becoming a member of the family were
mighty slim. I hadn't the slightest idea
that he had seen me there, and I thought
I could startle an admission from him that
would show him up in his true colors
without danger to myself. So when he
called the other night, I said suddenly:
" 'Young man, where were you last
Sunday?'
" 'Oh. I sat Just two rows ahead of you,'
he answered easily.
"That threw explanations back on me,
and left me gasping for breath.
" "Fine sermon, wasn't it?' he added a
moment later, coming to my rescue like
the trump he Is.
" 'Oh, you dejir old fellow, did you go
to church and say nothing to me about
it?" cried my wife. 'How lovely! What
was the text?'
"I was simply incapable of answering,
and again that young trump filled the
breach.
" 'Ninety and nine,' said he.
"The score wasn't quite as bad as that
âalmost, though. Bay! he's the finest
young man that ever drew breath and
he can have anything that belongs to
me!"â Detroit Free Fress.
Chivalry Saved His Neck.
Andrew Lang, in Longmans', retells a
capital story, which "proves the profitable
character of good manners," averring
that he had the tale from a descendant
of the gentleman who had the manners:
Mr. M.. of , was out in forty
five. He was taken, and was being
brought to the Tower with Kilmarnock
and Balmerino. A block stopped the sad
cortege and a lady, looking from a win
dow, cried: "You tall rebel!" (Mr. M.
was six feet four) "you will soon be
shorter by a head!"
"Does that give you pleasure,
madame?" said Mr. M.
"Yes, it does."
"Then, madame," said Mr. M., taking
off his hat and making a low bow, "I
do not die in vain."
Lady was moved. She made In
terest for Mr. M. There exists a paper
in the hand of George II to this effect:
"Let Lady " (the name is obliter
ated) "havo access to her tall rebel, and
be damned to her."
The royal clemency was extended to
Mr. M. I saw his pardon, beautifully en
grossed within a decorative border, and
framed, on the wall of a descendant's
study. It is fair to add that practically
the "whole county of Ross, and also the
Earl of Sutherland, petitioned for the life
of the courteous Mr. M. ; well, I see his
name ls in print in articles by D. M. R.,
reprinted from Northern Star, February
15 and 22, 1900. His name was Roder'ck
Macculloch, of Glastullich. D. M. H. f
however, does not give the aneodote bo

Strange Colony of Outlaws.
There is in Lower California a strange
colony of which tho outside world rarely
hears. It is made up of outlaws, and
some of the most notorious escaped crimi
nals have taken refuge in it. They live
in a strange, rugged stretch of country,
with the Gulf of California on one side
and a range of foothills which spreadv
down toward the Mexican border on the
other. There are no ports at this point
on the coast of California, and no rail
roads reaching in from the other direc
tion, so the men are completely isolated.
They are practicaily prisoners, because
they dare not venture out, but no effort
has ever been made to disturb them in
their chosen refuge, though they have
been congregating there for years.
The Kansas Idea.
Hans Jensen, a Dane, recently appeared
before the magistrate of the District
Court held in Garnett, Kans., to be nat
uralized. At the close of the usual ex
amination the Judge asked the applicant:
"Hans, are you satisfied with the general
conditions in this country? Does this
Government suit you entirely?" "Yas,
yas," answered Hans, "only I* would like
to see more rain." "You may be sworn "
said the Judge; "I perceive you already
have the Kansas idea."â St. Paul Globe.
General Pietre, the Venezuelan revolu
tionary leader, has demanded the surren
der of the city of Calaboso to prevent
Woodshed and the destruction of property.
General Pablo Guiman, another revo
lutionary leader, has attacked the town
of Aragua and captured all tho arms
there. He later made successful attacks
against General Meija's force and the gar
rison under command of President Mar
canos of the state of Bermudez, capturing
the arms and ammunition.
Old Cathedral at Roskilde.
W. E. Curtis writes to the Chicago Rec
ord-Herald that the dust of the Danish
Kings is kept in a great cathedral at
Roskilde, an old town twenty miles from
Copenhagen. Every year when the King
is entertaining his royal guests the entire
family always pay a visit to Roskilde, In
obedience to an ancient custom. On one
of the pillars are marks showing the
height of Peter the Great, Nicholas, the
Iron Czar; Alexander 111 of Russia tho
King of England- and many other Kings.
The cathedral was built in the eleventh
century. It has two mighty towers, which
can be seen at a long distance. The old
est grave ls that of King Harold I who
died in 987, and the last burial was that of
the body of the late Queen Louise.
Reserving the Forests.
A company of Texans owning a million
acres of forest land allows no tree of
less than a foot in diameter to be cut and
requires the smaller trees to be carefully
protected. "If this sensible plan." says
the Philadelphia Record, "had bee>i
adopted a century ago In the North our
pine forests would still be producing
large quantities of marketable lumber,
with no prospect of extinction." But
those forests are now a barren waste and
people can only on what might
have been.â St. Paul Pioneer Press.

Treasury Department Refuses
to Interfere in the
Matter.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â 1n the cases
of eighty or more Chinese who recently
arrived at San Francisco en route to Mex
ico, and who were refused permission to
proceed by the immigration authorities at
San Francisco on the ground that their
ultimate purpose was to cross the Mexi
can frontier into the United States con
trary to law, the Treasury Department
will instruct the Collector that the So
licitor of the Treasury has hsld that there
is no appeal to the department in such
cases, and therefore hi 3 adverse action
will stand. The matter was referred to
the Attorney General, who declines to
give an opinion, on the ground that the
cases are now before the courts. The de
partment has taken a firm stand against
permitting Chinamen to cross the United
States into Mexico, as investigation has
disclosed the fact that nearly all of them
recross the border into this country. The
long border line makes it almost impossi
ble to so patrol the territory as to pre
vent this, and the officials purpose to see
what virtue there may be in refusing
them permission to land on American soil
for any purpose whatever.
Colonel William. H. Powell.
OGDENSBURG, N. V., Nov. 16.â Colonel
William H. Powell, U. S. A., retired, died
at Sacketts Harbor to-day. He entered

first commission the same year. He be
came colonel of the Ninth Infantry in

Sarah Elizabeth Griswold Morse.
NEW YORK, Nov. IG.-Mrs. Sarah Eliz
abeth Grlswold Morse, widow of Professor
Samuel B. Morse, inventor of the tele
graph, died In Berlin on Thursday. She
was Professor Morse's second wife and
was married to him iv 1848. She was born
in 1822.
Strength of the Army.
The total enlistment in the continental
or so-called regular forces amounted from
1775 to 1783 to a total of 231,791. The aver
age enlistments were about 25,000 per an
num, as the service of each man was
usually less 'than a year. The army was
discharged and renewed nine times over
during the progress of the struggle. In
addition to the continentals there was a
force of militia variously estimated at
from 60,000 to 150,000.
It is a curious fact that we owe the es
tablishment of a regular army, which
Washington was powerless to accomplish,
to that hater of military establishments,
Thomas Jefferson. Events forced him to
this, as it did to the establishment of the
military academy. No doubt his sympa
thy with the popular hostility to a per
manent army made it easier for him to
obtain from Congress what he found him
self compelled to ask for.
Bean Famine Threatened in Boston
Many Bostonians did not enjoy their
customary repast of beans to-day, be
cause the scarcity of this staple fooi
amounted to almost a famine. About 400,
00 bushels of beans are annually con
sumed in Boston, and not In twenty years
has the price exceeded $1 50 a bushel.
Now, however, owing to a short crop in
New York, Michigan, California and Can
ada last year, the supply is nearly ex
hausted and the price has jumped to $3
a bushel and is still soaring.

Matter-of-Fact Governor.
Max O'Rell and a German Governor of
one of the States of America got to be
great friends, and when sufficiently fami
liar the Governor confided to Max that he
objected to one only of his sayingsâ that
"Germans had no humor." "Well," said
Max, "It's this way. I used to tell a tale
of a tree that was so high that it took
two men to see to the top of it. One
looked as far as he could, and tho other
started looking where the other left off!
And," aflded Max, "I never met a Ger
man yet who could see the joke!"
"Joke!" replied the Teuton, "that's not a
joke; it's a d d lie!"â Melbourne Argus.
VICIOUS BUCK
HOLDS BRIDGE
Escaped Pet Deer Creates
Excitement in
Sonoma.
Man Attacked by the Animal
Escapes by Leaping
Into a Boat
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 16.â A vicious buck
took possession of the drawbridge at
Sonoma yesterday and when the bridge
tender attempted to raise the draw the
animal decided to dispute his right. For
a time the deer had everything 1 his own
way and supplied considerable excitement.
The brrage is across Sonoma creek and
is owned by the California Northwestern,
railroad. The buck was a four-pointer
and had escaped from Victor Sartori's
place in Fairville. Bridge Tender Peter
Hem was called upon to raise the draw to
enable a schooner to pass, but the buck
was in the middle of the structure. When
Hem approached, the animal charged him
with lowered antlers. By dropping into
a boat under the bridge Hem escaped the
deer.
The owner of the buck arrived later and
after an exciting time the animal was re
captured. It is an extremely vicious buck
and two men have been badly injured by
it, one being nearly killed.

SURVIVES POWERFUL
SHOCK OF ELECTRICITY
Los Angeles Man Makes Short Cir
cuit to Himself and Receives
Two Thousand Volts.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16.â W. H. Repo
egle, an electrician at the sub-station of
the United Electric, Gas and Power
Company, sustained for several seconds
to-day the force of an electric current of
2000 volts, and still lives. While working
among the transformers he accidentally
made a short circuit of himself. While
severely burned at points of contact and
suffering greatly from the shock, he will
recover.
Bold Robbery in Stockton.
STOCKTON, Nov. 16.â Two young men
wearing masks entered a grocery store in
the eastern part of the city, near tho
Southern Pacific Railroad, to-night,
robbed Isaac Stanaway. the clerk, of $22
and took two or three dollars out of the
till. They struck the clerk with pistols
when he refused to open the safe and es
caped when neighbors gave the alarm.
The robbery occurred at 8:50 o'clock,
when many persons were passing along
the street.
California Fruit.
English fruit growers now complain
that they are being beaten by California
rivals in the price and the quality of
plums. From California plums are re
ceived in London which, in spite of their
long journey, can undersell the English
plum and vastly exceed it in attractive
ness and appearance. The California vis
itor is so carefully packed that it arrives
with the bloom as fresh as at its first
picking. Such trifles do not concern the
English grower, whose fruit, except it be
of the most expensive kind, cornea bat
tered and bruised to market.
ADVISSTIS2SMJSNTS.
KNOWS NO DISTINCTION.
Rich and Poor Alike Suffer From
Catarrh? in This Climate.
All observant physicians have noticed the
enormous Increase In catarrhal diseases
In recent years, and the most liberal and
enlightened have cheerfully given their
approval to the new internal remedy.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, as the most
successful and by far the safest remedy
for catarrh yet produced. .
One well known catarrh specialist, as
soon as he had made a thorough test of
this preparation, discarded inhalers,
washes and sprays and now depends en-
tirely upon Stuart's Catarrh Tablets In
treating catarrh, whether in the head,
throat or stomach.
Drvâ Rlsdell says: "In patients who had
lost the sense of smell entirely and even,
where the hearing has begun to be affect-
ed from catarrh I have had fine results
after only a few weeks' use of Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets. I can only explain their
action on the theory that the cleansir.3
aid antiseptic properties of the tablet?
destroy the catarrhal germs wherever
lound, because I have found the tablets
equally valuable In catarrh of the throat
and stomach as in nasal catarrh."
Dr. Estabrook says Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets are especially useful in nasal ca-
tarrh and catarrh of the throat, clearing
the membranes of mucus and speedily
overcoming the hawking, coughing and
expectorating. - > â¢*. â¢. w
Any sufferer from catarrh will find
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets will gi-v-3 Imme-
diate relief, and being in tablet form and
pleasant to the taste, are convenient and
always ready for use, as they can be car-
ried in the pocket and used at any time,
as they contain no poisonous drugs, but
only the cleansing antiseptic properties
of Eucalyptus bark, Guaiacol, blood root
and Hydrastin.
All druggists sell the tablets at 30 cents
for complete treatment.

It is understood that A. B. Maguire, D.

The opinion is gaining force that the
Board of Police Commissioners will elect
a Chief of the department before the in
auguration of the new municipal admin
istration. A vacancy now exists, and
three of the Commissioners are said to be
or of filling it without delay.
J. W. Kearth. Surveyor of Colusa Coun
ty, is in the city. He is a Republican,
whose popularity is so great and his aoil
wideiy recognized that he can be
elected to office in Colusa County, the
Democratic stronghold of California. It
is common gossip in political circles that
Mr. Kearth is a candidate for the Repub
lican nomination for Surveyor General of
the Btate and has many assurances of
tupport from Northern California.
Major General Samuel B. M. Young.
U. S. A., leaves for Washington. D. C, to
day, to serve on a board of army officers
appointed to select military encampment
sites. No doubt Senators and Represent
atives in Congress from California are
fully advised of the important questions
referred to this board. Congress provided
that there should be established in the
United States four permanent camps for
of troops. One of these
be established in Cantor
is the spirit of
ition and makes lib
Â¦ r the maintenance of
Juard. The Pacific Coast
bly expect more than one
under the act of Congress proviu
iag for the establishment of four. The
will expect une and the West may
demand two. It it possible that the Pa-
Oo&st may be excluded by reason of
sure on the other side.
It is the judgment of military men that
Â¦ry it preferable, as there must
be free range for artillery practice and a
larg' cooatry for field evoiutions
and practice marches. There is no avail
able space on the Presidio reservation
but there are ideal sites in the Santa
Clara. Pajaro and San Joaquin valleys.
The board, which will convene in Wash
ington. D. C, on the 25th inst.. is com
posed of. the commanding general. Nelson
A. Miles, four major generais and three
brigadiers. The sites must afford ample
room for artillery, infantry and cavalry
work. There must be plenty of water, as
swimming is in the course of instruction.

BRINGS REPORT
OF COMMISSION
Charles A. Conant Re
turns From Mission
to Manila.
Says American Bankers Are
Wanted in the New
Possessions.
If you have any moiiey to lend and can
get to the Philippine Islands before any
action is taken on the report Charles A.
Conant is taking to Washington, you can
turn it lcose among the "Goo-goos" at
the interest rate of 40 per cent per an
num. Â¦ .
Charles A. Conant is a guest at the Pal
ace Hotel. He was *-ent to the Philip
pines several months ago by Secretary of
War Root to investigate the coinage and
banking systems of Uncle Sam's new pos
sessions. He returned yesterday on the
steamship China, in company with D. K.
imams, secretary or. the Philippine
commission. Ho and Williams are joint
Mercuries irom Governor lait to Presi
cent Kooseveit, ana have in tneir posses
sion tne report ci me Philippine Commis
sion lor the year ending October 15.
This is me report lor wnich the Presi
dent is said to oe waiting ana wuich was
supposed to De takicg" a serial course of
shipwreck on the transports anenaan,
warren ana KancocK
Conant did leave Manila on the Sheri
dan, but when at .Nagasaki he learned
that the transport had developed leaks
that would have to be plugged before bile
crossed the Pacific, ana he, Williams and
the report transferred themselves to the
China and came on to San Francisco.
Civil rule In the Philippines, according
to Mr. Conant, has proved a big success.
The commission now ruling such of the
islands as are at peace includes three
Filipinosâ a Manila capitalist;
Tavera, a Manila physician who was ed
ucated in Paris, and Luzuniaga, a prom
inent citizen of the island of Negros.
The commission hes the conndence of
the people and is doing its best to give
them all the good things the American
constitution guarantees to its supporters.
Mourn McKinley 's Death.
"The death of McKinley was mourned
throughout Luzon as aeeply as in Ohio,
and memorial services of solemn cere
mony were celebrated by the natives
throughout the territory under the rule oi.
Governor Taft."
That's what Mr. Conant said when
asked as to what he thought of the re
sumption of military rule in the Philip
pines.
Regarding his own particular mission
Mr. Conant was communicative in a gen
eral way. He says the Philippines are in
need of proper banking facilities. When
ths legislature of this country passed a
law limiting the letting of commercial
franchises to one year's duration it put a
stop to the commercial development of the
Philippines.
"This restriction," says Mr. Conant,
"puts a stop to all railroad enterprise and
absolutely prevents any mining develop
ment."
There are sugar and other plantations
already established, however, and the
owners, like agriculturists in every land,
are occasionally in nt-cd of ready money.
The ruling rate of interest for such ac
commodation is 40 p-ir cent per annum,
and loans at that rate are only made in
cases where there exists a cast-iron pros
pect of repayment.
Money-Lenders' Paradise.
One bank, Mr. Conant says, does make
loans on crops at the .nominal rate of 25
per cent. By the time the transaction be
tween borrower and lender has been com
pleted, however, the regulation 40 per cent
looks like a cheap rate. The 25 per cent
lender takes a mortgage on the crops. He
takes the crops and assumes the right to
dispose of them at his own figure, and be
tween the making of the loan and the
selling of the crop supplies the borrower
with all his working and living necessi
ties at such price as the lender sees fit to
charge.
There are two tranches of English
banks in Manila, but their business is re
stricted to dealing in foreign exchange.
There is also a Spanish bank.
"There is a great Behl for an American
bank, and particularly for a corporation
willing to deal in mortgages," says Mr.
Conant. "The Philippine Commission is
gradually getting land titles in proper
shape, and when things get on Â£ business
basis in that part of the world there will
be plenty opportunity for all kinds of
business men."
Mr. Conant, with Mr. Williams, the re
port and United States Senator Bacon of
Georgia, who has been visiting. Uncle
Sam's new possessions, will all leave to
day for Washington.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
KOREAN AFFAIRS
ARE PROSPEROUS
Conditions Are Due to
Enterprise of the
Americans.
Minister Allen Arrives, but
Declines to Talk
Politics.
United States Minister to Korea Horace
N. Allen was one of tl>e passengers on the
China, which arrived from the Orient yes
terday. Minister Allen is accompanied by
Mrs. Allen and both are registered at the
Occidental.
Minister Allen went to Korea seventeen
years ago as a physician and secured a
position in the Kings household. Dur
ing President* Harrison's administration
he established diplomatic relations be
tween the United Staces and Korea and
organized the Korean embassy at Wash
ington. President Harrison appointed
him secretary of the embassy, and later
he returned to Korea as the representa
tive of this Government. One of President
McKinley's first acts was to appoint Dr.
Allen Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary, which office he has since
held with credit to the administration and
himself. '
"What is the condition of affairs in Ko
rea, Mr. Allen?" asked a Call reporter of
the Minister last night.
"The country is prospering," was the re
ply. "The injection of American methods
and enterprise into Kcrean affairs has re
sulted In the accomplishment of wonders
for the country. There are eighty Amer
icans, many of them San Franciscans,
occupying positions in the gold mines and
on the railways, and everywhere the evi
dences of American investment of capital
are prominently displayed."
"What is the political situation with
reference to the attitude of Russia to
ward Korea?"
"That is a question I am not at this
('me privileged to discuss. I have my
views concerning the Eastern question,
but it would be unwise to express them
just now. I shall make an extended re
port to the authorities at Washington. In
the meanwhile I do not care to be quoted
on the subject in an> way."
Minister Allen stated that since the
China war the prospects of Korea have
grea+lv improved. The people of Seoul
ana vicinity are fast becoming metropoli
tan in their tastes, the result being the
introduction of modern improved meth
ods into all affairs of human life in Ko
rea. Minister Allen is a native of Dela
ware, Ohio, and it is his intention to visit
his birthplace on his way East. He has
two sons in college in New York, and his
principal reason for visiting that State
is to see them. He hopes to return to Ko
rea before the Ist of April next.

PROFESSOR MAGEE SPEAKS
ON PHYSICAL CULTURE
Declares That Exercise Is Indispens
able to the Preservation of
Health.
Professor Magee of the physical culture
department of the University of Califor
nia delivered an interesting and enter
taining lecture last night in the Y. M.
C. A. building on modern physical cul
ture. He described the various forms of
physical culture which are now in vogue
and pointed out the advantages and dis
advantages of each. H& endeavored to
prove that exercise in some form is ab
solutely indispensable for the preserva
tion of health. He asserted that no col
lege should be without a well equipped
gymnasium. *>*Â«-Â«
He pointed out the forms of exercise
which are best calculated to improve par
ticular muscles of the body, as, for in
stance, he declared that vaulting the back
gives strength to the muscles around the
spinal column, while arching the chest
strengthens the muscles of the chest ani
abdomen and expands the lungs.
NARROWLY ESCAPED
BEING CUT IN TWO
Charge of Assault With a Deadly
Weapon Against Thomas J.
Goodhue Dismissed.
Thomas J. Goodhue. a machinist in the
Vulcan Iron Works, appeared before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday on a charge of
assault wtth a deadly weapon, and after
hearing the evidence the Judge dismissed
the case. The complaining witness was
Francis Lapaque, who is also employed
as a machinist at the works.
Friday morning Gcodhue took a clamp
from the tools Lapaque was using La
paque objected and tried to take it back
A struggle ensued, during which Lapaque
with a grip on Goodaue's throat forced
him backward toward a lathe, and he was
in imminent danger of being cut in two
In desperation he struck Lapaque on the
head with the clamp, rendering him un
conscious. The Judge thought that La
paque was very fortunate in not having
a charge of murder registered against
him.
Mrs. Loomis Gets Property Back.
Judge Sloss yesterday decided the suit

Hawley and E. H. Loomis in favor of the
plaintiff, thus declaring the deed of trust
whereby Mrs. Loorsia conveyed her share
of her husband's estate to Mrs. Hawlev

discovered that she bad given away all
she possessed that she thought of having
it annulled.

PARISIAN WOMEN
FORM A LEAGUE
Intend to Take Active
Part in All Future
Elections.
Will Use Money and Influence
to Secure Success of
Candidates.
PARIS, Nov. 16.â T!:e women of the
French capital have initiated a movement
which is expected to influence future elec
tions. Their watchwoid is "Defense of
property, the fatherland and liberty,"
and they purpose to support, by influence
and money, candidates who will uphold
their platform. An influential committee
has been formed, under the leadership of
the wife of Admiral Decuverville, and re
cruiting is actively proceeding. The
women distinctly disclaim any champion
ship of feminlaism or that they are seek
ing to obtain "impossible liberties or
ridiculous equalities ' They will devote
special attention to the men of the better
class, who do not take the trouble to vote,
and contemplate excluding from their
drawing-rooms all who are unable to
prove that they have exercised the right
of franchise.
A proclamation of the league, which is
now being circulated, rejects socialism
and paternalism, demands recognition of
the rights of French mothers to choose
the teachers of their children and winds
up with a reference to recent legislation
as follows: "We desire that all con
sciences may "be free on French soil.
Functionaries and priefts, monks and
nurrs also have consciences, and we de
mand liberty for them."
GERMANY FEARS
OUR CAPITALISTS
Directors of Steamship
Companies Confer
With Emperor.
Become Alarmed at the Large
Purchases of Stock
by Americans.
BERLIN, Nov. 16.â Much mystery pre
vails here regarding the meeting of the
directors of ocean steamship companies
at the Hotel Bristol last evening. The
meeting was apparently unexpectedly
called. Herr Ballin, director of the Ham
burg-American line, and Herr Plathe,
president of the North German line, came
first and were received by the Emperor,
and then the other directors and secre
taries were summoned. A representative
also attended the meeting.
The Kleine Journal says the ocean com
panies' directors have held conferences
and discussed ways and means of pre
venting the increasing American influence
over German lines. The paper adds that
New York capitalists have purchased
several million marks of shares in the
Hamburg-American line during the past
few weeks, but the excitement by the re
ported purchase by a New York life in
surance company of over 5,000,000 marks
of the North German Lloyd Company's
obligations the Kleine Journal considers
unjustified, since this purchase does not
affect the shares.
The Tageblatt to-day prints an official
denial from the North German Lloyd
Company that this company has sold ob
ligations to the New York insurance com
pany. Herr Ballin left Berlin this after
noon.

GIVES WAY TO LIQUOR
AND ENDS HIS LIFE
Weight of Trouble Sends Man Into
the Slavery of a Habit He
Had Conquered.
SPOKANE. Nov. ICâ Despondent be
cause he could not obtain work, D. M.
Bertha of Winona, Minn., took to liquor
In an effort to forgret his troubles. When
he awoke to-day, a prey to remorse, he
purchased a quantity of laudanum and
drank about four ounces. Hard work on
the part of physicians kept him alive for
more than a hour, but he died without re
gaining consciousness.
Bertha came here recently in search of
work in the flour mills. Finding no em
ployment, he became discouraged and be
gran to drink, though he had formerly
taken the Keeley cure in the East. A day
or two ago a pickpocket drugged him and
relieved him of $20. To-day Bertha drank
heavily and was noticed g-oing up to his
room in the Nagle House in a semi-intoxi
cated condition. A few hours later a
chambermaid heard gToans issuing from
the man's room. She called for assistance,
the door was broken in and Bertha was
found writhing in agony on the bed.
Bertha was about 50 years old and a
man of powerful physique.
Rights of Insane Persons.
SEATTLE, Nov. 16.â An important opin
ion construing the laws of the State of
Washington regarding insanity and the
care of the insane has been rendered by
the Attorney General s office at the re
quest of F. L. Goddard, superintendent of
the Western Washington Hospital for the
Insane. Assistant Attorney General Dal
ton writes the opinion. He holds in sub
stance that where an insane patient Is
merely paroled by the superintendent of
an asylum he or she may be recommitted
on simple order of the court. Where a
patient is discharged, however, a regular
hearing must be had and a new commit
ment signed, In all respects the same as if
the patient had never before been declared
Self -Supporting Rose Fete.
PASADENA, Nov. 16.â The Pasadena
Tournament of the Roses Association has
launched a plan for making the annual
floral fete of New Year's day self-support
ing. Already $3500 has been raised by do
nations, and $5000 will be in the hands of
the directors by January 1. With receipts
from the grand stands the directors pro
pose to establish a permanent Sportsman's
Park, the gate receipts from which will,
they believe, pay the running expenses of
the tournament.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16â Edward Way

a kleptomaniac with a penchant for bi
cycle stealing, and against whom a charge
of grand larceny was pending, will be sent
to his home in New York, where his rela
tives can take care of him. Friends have

JOHN CONSIDINE
TELLS HIS STOBY
Defendant in the Seattle
Murder Case
Testifies.
Denies That He Sought the
Life of Ex-Chief of Police
Meredith.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 16.â 1n the trial* of the
case of the State vs. John W. Considine,
the defendant himself took the stand this
morning shortly after 10 o'clock and was
still undergoing cross-examination when
court adjourned for the noon recess. Yes
terday afternoon Thomas J. Considina^
charged Jointly with John W. Considine
with the murder of ex-Chief of Police
William Meredith, but not now on trial,
took the stand on his brother's behalf.
It took thÂ« witness a half hour to give
his testimony on direct examination, and
he was subjected to a cross-examination
by Mr. Fulton lasting an hour.
The story told by John W. Considine
this morning agreed with that of Thomas
so far as It related to the doings of the
two men during the afternoon prior to
their visit to Guy's drug store. John,
however, could recall but little of the oc
currences in the drug store beyond the
fact that he recognized Meredith as the
man who shot at him, that there was a
brief struggle, and that he finally shot
Meredith dead. He recalled an exclama
tion made by Meredith, "I've got an
other," but could not recall the fact that
Thomas Considine hit Meredith on the
bead after taking a revolver away from
him. He did not remember having 1 said,
anything himself and "did not hear Thom
as say anything during the struggle. He
denied that he was looking for Meredith
on the afternoon in question, and swore
that the first time he saw Meredith on
that day was when he recognized him in
Guy's drug store.
John B. Hart conducted the cross-ex
amination of the defendant, and for the
second time went over the story of the
actions of Considine during the afternoon
of June 25. in his questions he assumed
that Considine had followed Meredith
about during the day, to all of which the
defendant entered emphatic denials.
Hart began a series of questions tend
ing to show the general character of the
defendant. These were objected to by
the defense and the objection was sus
tained.
Other witnesses of the day were physi
cians called as experts to testify to the
effect upon John W. Considine of the
shock of the first discharge of Meredith's
shotgun, and also to the effect upon
Meredith of the blows struck by Thomas
CcnFidine. The doctors agreed that John
might have been dazed and yet instinct
ively act toward the preservation of his
life. They also agreed that Meredith, al
though badly injured about the head,
might still have had energy enough to
carr>' out a preconceived and fixed de
termination.
Counsel for the defense announced that
they would probably call no mor^ wit
nesses The case was held open, however,
upon their request until Monday morning,
when, if they have no more testimony,
the State will commence rebuttal. The
case could hardly get to the jury before
Thursday.
WILL SEEK TO PREVENT
RAILWAY CONSOLIDATION
Governor Van Zandt of Minnesota
Strongly Opposed to the Great
Northern Deal.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 16.â A special to
the Pioneer Press from Winona, Minn.,
says: Governor Van Zandt came down
from St. Paul this afternoon. When asked
regarding the incorporation of the North
ern Securities Company in New Jersey
he made the following statement:
"The great railway deal in New York
having for its object the uniting of two
gTeat competing and parallel lines â the
Northern Pacific and Great Northernâ is
a matter of great public interest. There
is justly a widespread opposition to it in
our State. I do not know if it can be
prevented, but it is my intention to ask
Attorney General Douglass upon his re
turn to bring suit in the name of the
State to prevent, if possible, the consolida
tion of the Great Northern and Northern
Pacific railroads. It is clearly in open
violation of the plain intent and purpose
of the law. If under existing laws the
consolidation cannot be prevented, I feel
that I would be justified in calling an ex
tra session of the Legislature to take the
necessary steps to successfully resist it if
it could be accomplished by this means.
Believing it to be my plain duty, I shall
leave no stone unturned to prevent this
contemplated consolidation. Owing to the
great interest of our State and people at
stake, it should and will be a fight to a
finish. If the will of the people of Min
nesota can be trampled upon in this man
ner, the sooner this fact is ascertained
and understood the better."

Defendant Claims She
Was Never Wife of
Plaintiff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, NovTlSi-The divorce cult
of Albert W. Geer against Jessie M. Geer,
now pending in the courts here has as
sumed an unusual and pec uliar phase.
Besides denying her marriage to Geer.
the defendant has married the co-re
spondent named in the complaint since
leaving her husband and placed herself
in such a position that she may be prose
cuted for bigamy.
Some months ago Geer, who is an elec
trician, commenced suit against his wife,
alleging infidelity. He asked fsr the cus
tody of their child. He set forth that he
and his wife were married in this county
on January 4, 1895.
To this complaint Mrs. Geer has meu
answer. She alleges she never was mar
ried to Geer at that or any other time,
but that she is the lawful wife of Gus S.
Videau, whom Bhe wedded in Marin
County on July 16, 1901. Not only does she
want the court to dismiss the suit for di
vorce ,but she wants a judgment declar
ing she was never married to. Geer. An
order restraining Geer from asserting
that she is his wife is asked fo.

that Geer and his wife were married in
this city by contract in 1895. This docu
ment has been recorded and is as binding,
he says, as a licensed marriage. He de

liable to prosecution for bigamy by mar
rying Videau.
FNTUCHED BY CHOCTAW
BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
Fresno Constable and His Family
Will Receive Fortune From
the Government.
FRESNO, Nov. 16.â John Dumas, a con
stable of this city, received word yester
day of a small fortune that has suddenly
come into his possession and is now await
ing him in Austin, Texas. The fortune
amounts to $24,000, and is to be divided
among himself, his wife and two children.
dren.
Back of this sudden windfall is a ro
mantic story. Years ago the great-great
grandfather of Dumas ventured into the
wilds of the Indian Territory and married
the daughter of Brazier, a famous Choc
taw chief. Since then the Choctaws, as is
well known, were deprived of vast tracts
of land for which the Government agreed
to pay $60,000,000. Considerable litigation
followed, but at last the dispute has been
settled and the Government agrees to pay
to every person with Choctaw blood in
his veins the sum of $6000.
Dumas is a prominent man in this coun
ty, having lived here for many years. The
knowledge that there is Indian blood in
his veins comes as a great surprise to
everybody. Robert B. Shipp, another well
known Fresno man, also comes in for a
share of the Choctaw money. Dumas and
Shipp will leave for Austin, Texas, next
Thursday.

Lumbermen Lose the Rebate.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Nov. 16.â A spe
cial from Ottawa, Ont., says that a re
bate which has been allowed to an extent
of 40 cents per thousand on lumber taken
off Dominion lands and shipped to the
American side has been rescinded. The
reason given is that the conditions under
which the local lumbermen conduct their
business are more favorable than those
across the line in Washington. This is
rather In line with the action of the pro
vincial Government at the session of the
Legislature in passing an act against the
export of cedar lumber to the American
side. Large shipments of lumber are be
ing made continually from the British Co
lumbia coast to Puget Sound and accord-
Ing to statements of lumbermen, a better
price is paid th*re and a better market
exists than there Is locally.

Santa Barbara and Paso
Robles Entertain the
Easterners.
PASO ROBLES, Nov. 16.â The special
train bearing the American Association
of Traveling Passenger Agents arrived
here to-day, en route to San Francisco.
The visitors were entertained at dinner
by Manager Otto E. Never and departed
at 9 o'clock.
At Santa Barbara this morning the citi
zens gave the Easterners a royal time.
The weather was ideal. When the train
drew into the station a reception com
mittee was there to meet it. Alter a sub
stantial breakfast at the Arlington Ho
tel the railroad men were taken in tally
hos and private carriages around the city.
The lirst stop was made at the Old Mis
sion and the Franciscan Fathers did
everything in their power to entertain.
After luncheon in the Arlington, the party
boarded the train and proceeded to Paso
Robles, arriving here at 7 o'clock.
The scenery along the Southern Pacific's
new coast division was greatly enjoyed by
all the Eastern visitors and they could not
say enough about their appreciation of
the beautiful climate and the picturesque
ness of California.
The special train will arrive at Del
Monte to-morrow morning early. After
breakfast the railroad men will take the
seventeen mile drive. They will leave
Monterey late to-morrow night and will
arrive in San Jose on Monday morning.
There they will be entertained.
The railroad men will be guests of San
Francisco from Monday noon until
Wednesday night.

ered the finest advertising medium, of any
class of men that visit the State. The
railroad companies appreciate this and
there Is friendly rivalry between the
Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe to ex
cel one another in making the trip of
the Eastern agents pleasant. It is whis
pered that the latter road has already
spent $10,000 in entertaining the traveling
passenger agents during their visit to this

Medicine forced on the little ones loses half its power. Nasty,
sickening medicine is an injustice to the dear little innocents who
can't protect themselves, makes them peevish and afraid of the dose.
When a child hates the medicine, it will not be effective. Children
like Cascarets Candy Cathartic, ask for them and are kept healthy
always and easily against the damages of childhood's ailments.

IN A HEAD FINISH WITH IMPROMPTU

Montana Stable Entry â Winner Superbly Rddenby Birkenruth.
Articulate Takes the Paxton Handicap in an Ordinary Ga lop
'^|-^ HE talent over at Oakland track
rHE talent over at Oakland track
"went an awful cropper" yester
' I day, when Impromptu defeated
\ Ordnung for the $1500 Golden Gate
selling stake. The Schorr horse,
tiih Johnny Woods and 105 pounds up,
-.vas considered the one rosy thing on the
jard. Then, too, the track, which was
muddy, seemed made to order for him.
Phis fact, coupled with reports of marvel
ous work-ouis, caused the odds in the
ring to be quickly pounded down from
evens to 7 to 10. Only the day before
Frank Doss disposed of Impromptu to
lhe Montana stable, and the colt's new
{owners wen him out, getting aboard at 6
<md 7 to L About the only one the
har.dicappers could give a chance to was
t-ea Lion, and Caesar Young's mud lark
wat early put out of business by being
<rut off. At the barrier "Jake" Holtman
jelled "Come on" to a pretty start, with
Wooes on the favorite soon showing clear
of his field. Birkenruth evidently did not
xr.tena to play second riddle with Im
promptu, for he went after the leader
und<r a. full head of steam. Entering the
fetretch. Woods on Ordnung- made a. gen
erous turn, permitting Impromptu to gain
a length or more. With less than a fur
long to cover, the latter colt had pulled
up on even terms with the favorite, and
the:: ensued a furious drive Woods tried
burping a little and then he carried Im
promptu in. but all to no avail, the out
sider winning by a neck. The seven fur
lonfs were covered in 1:30, an exceedingly
good performance over the track. Win
nie O'Connor finished third with Bedeck,
agUnst which 10 to 1 was laid.
As is usual on Saturdays, the ring was
thronged with race-goers, and the gTajid
piand comfortably filled with the fair sex.
Jlany labored under the impression that
Biz straight favorites would go through
r.r.d collided with the combination book
accordingly, but three outsidersâ Merops
Impromptu and Lady Meddlesome
slashed the slate.
By cutting- across lots and taking ad
vantage of all the gaps left open Hoar
landed the opening sprint with Merops
after getting nearly left at the post. The
old horse closed at 10 to 1. and in a drive
disposed of Xed Dennis 'by a length. Alas
the favorite, ran poorly.
.' Murcsca always held the reputation of
heir.? an excellent mud artist, and "Fris
co" Lind had the filly ready first clatter
o;u. Backed down to 11 to 10 favoritism
in ihe speculating on the two-year-old
number, she led from start to finish,'
beating the 20 to 1 shot Quadra more
than a length. Royalty did not have
speed enough to raise a gallop.
If ever a horse "came home on the bit,"
Articulate did in the Paxton handicap
over one mile and a furlong. The brown
colt had Ransch at the wheel on the voy
age, and turning the keboat first by
ten lengths he crossed the line under
closely reefed sails, six boatlengths ahead
of The Fretter. Varro became becalmed,
getting in a poor third.
Disappointed in not winning the stake,
Johnny Schorr "had the pleasure of see
ing Lady Meddlesome take the mile seil
. ir.g affair at luscious odds. J. Woods han
cled her to splendid advantage, downing
Bob Palmer aiid Imperious in clever fash
ion. From a time standpoint the race
t was a bad one. Imperious. Marion Lynch,
Flamero, Castake and McXamara all run
r.irg below par.
Admirers of George Miller's sprinter De
coy got a good price in the betting on
the concluding race of the day. From 4
the odds were gradually slashed to 2VÂ» and
the bay horse won easily, after getting
away from the pest among the tail end
ers. Educate, Midnight Chimes and Cou
sin Carrie cut out a pace that had all
thrÂ«e wobbling before the stand hove in
' sight.
Track Notes.
â¢ r Dick Dwyer will be here to- ]
rAgtx and will nandle the starting gate ;
at Oakland to-morrow. Jake Holtman, ;
Â¦svhGse work has been of the highest <or
cer, will rest for two weeks, after which
he wM alternate with Dwyer throughout
the season.
Billy Cafcill, the well known farrier ana
owner of race horses, arrived from Chi
cago last night- Billy looks hale ajid
hearty and says he put in a prosperous
r-eascn on the idle Western tracks.
On the. same train with Cahill came
Johnny Bullman, the jockey, and Charley
Weber, the ex-jockey and now assistant
for Starter Dwyer. Bullir.aji had excel
frt success riding East and will prob
ably be seen in the saddle to-morrow.
He reports that several other good riders,
among them Tommy Burns, will head this
way at the close of the B(.-nning-s meet.
Mounce is due to arrive here to-mor
tov. His recent saddle work has made a
lit with the Eastern critics, and Presid-
EC Steward Pettingill says the boy will
~ot lack encasements next season.
Johnny Woods and J. risen each pi
" oted a pair of winners yesterday. O'Con
tor was out cf luck, not finishing up closer
iLsr third in any of the events in which
fee played a part.
For one so highly touted and bet on as
Orleans, the filly showed a dismal lack
of speed. Mud, too, it was said, was her
spading suit.
HThc firm of Doble & Co.. consisting of
EBudd Doble and Johnny Campbell, has
*oeen dissolved. The horses form raced
i the firm's colors under a lease but
wr.ed by "Lucky" Baldwin, have been
turned over to George Baldwin.
Johnny Campbell, whose cleverness as
a cenditioner of horses is known the coun
try over, wiil now conduct a public train
i'.if stable. He is handling' the Montana
ftable and advised the purchasing of
Glendening and Impromptu.
Frank Doss grew tired of having Im
promptu "boosted" every time the colt
v.or. a selling race, and concluded to sell.
The rencrted price he received was $1500,
T\r/ch lpoks like a. bargain.
S. Judfce, the owner of Bob Palmer, bid

ANGELS DEFEAT
THE CRIPPLES
One-Hand Catch by Alt
rock Is Feature of
the Game.
Champion Jeffries Will Not
Act as Umpire This
Afternoon.
1
Morley's Angejs played an , ' errorless
game yesterday at Recreation Grounds,
sending three of their number over the
route while the cripples were making ons
lone run. The game was slow and list
less at times, but several â¢ pretty plays
were executed, which in a measure re
deemed some of the slow and erratic work
which the Dudes were responsible for.
Ewing's men hit better than the Angels,
but whenever a hit was really needed It
failed to materialize. Both j Jones and I
Schmidt showed signs of wildness at 1
times, but made up for it by good work
at critical moments.
The red legs made two tallies in the
second on one hit, an error and a wild j
pitch. Hall and Spies each collided with
the sphere, and Altrock was safe on Bab-,
bitt's error. Schmidt lost his control,
making a wild pitch, and Hall ! trotted
home. Jones got a pass, filling the bases
again, and Spies crossed the rubber on
the throw in from Dougherty's fly to the
right garden. Atherton, the next man up,
singled, but Reitz retired the side by fly
ing to Dunleavy, who made a great run
ning catch. ,
The cripples opened their half of | the
second in sensational style. Strieb led off
with a two-cushion shot and Babbitt got
a ticket to first. Both men were advanced
on Hamilton's hit. At this juncture Jones
went up in the air and walked Schmidt,
forcing Strleb over the plate. Another hit
would have meant a couple of more runs,
but Mohler went out by the third and
first route, and It was all over.
"Captain Charley" Reilly made the last
point of the game, in the eighth round.
He accepted a free pass, stole second,
went to the third resting place on Spies'
our to first and completed the trip on Al
trock's pretty single past the middle sta
in' the fifth, Inning, with two on the
sacks, "Truck" Eagan sent one soaring
through the atmosphere in the direction
of the center field fence. It looked like
a two-bagger, . but Altrock was thuere
with one mitt, making one of the : most
sensational catches ever seen on the
grounds. - , ' ".'
Champion Jim Jeffries will 1 not appear
in the role of umpire at this afternoon
game. This statement was given out au
thoritatively by "Kid" Egan on behalf of
Jeffries last night. He explained that
there was a misunderstanding over the
matter and the champion would not ap
pear. Following is the score:

A Poor WayjAk
To Treat HSm
No one would be so foolish as to kindle the fire on top iÃfef^^^g^^^^^
of a pot to make it boil, yet the treatment of Catarrh is often W\S^lln^^!^^^m
just as senseless ; and illogical. Douches, sprays, ointments, w
so-called tobacco cures, and various other applications, are
diligently used, but the little good accomplished is swept away WF
.by the first breath of winter. When you attempt to cure a ..^^gt^A^H!
constitutional disease â one affecting the entire system â with â¢ 9?|is-2S|? v
purely local remedies, you are applying the fire to the top Ol^^^f^jl^^^^^^fite^
the pot, you are doctoring symptoms, and, like thousands of ~ 'â¢*aBL**!^^^^^^fflHJ^ : ?
others, get disappointing results. - In Chronic Catarrh, the whole system becomes involved;
the entire mucous membrane, or inner covering of the, body, is in a state of high inflamma-
tion. The pressure of blood upon the glands and cells produce excessive secretion of mucus,
much of which is absorbed into the blood and distributed to all parts of the body. In this
way the stomach, kidneys aud intestines are often seriously affected.
The nose, throat and ears are most frequently attacked by this foul disease, because
the mucous lining is exposed to the cold, damp air, which attracts the vitiated blood to the

Blinding headaches, neuralgia of the eyes and dizziness are also symptoms of this
disease, and when the inflammation reaches the delicate mechanism of the ear, hearing is lost,
and, as the blood becomes more deeply poisoned, the tissues and soft bones in the head are
eaten out, greatly disfiguring the face. *At this stage of Catarrh the breath becomes insuffer-
ably offensive. S. S. S. is the simplest and n>:>st effective treatment for Catarrh, and when
taken into the circulation reaches all parts of the system and cleanses the blood of all
Catarrhal matter and restores it to a normal condition. When rich, new blood begins to flow
through the .veins, the obstructed glands and broken down cells resume their natural
functions, and the hot and inflamed membranes are lubricated and moistened with a soothing,
healing fluid that quickly brings relief to the congested parts. S. S. S. puts the blood in
such perfect condition and so strengthens and invigorates the general health that the local
S^^a^^ j/^xf^ manifestations of the disease gradually disappear, the dis-

THE SWIFT SPECIFIC CO. Atlanta, Ga.
ENGINEERS OF TRANSPORT MEADE
REFUSE TO TAKE SHIP OUT OF PORT
Claim That Force in Their Department Is Too Small to Permit
Proper Handling of the 4 Huge Vessel.
ALTHOUGH the United States >
army transport Meade pulled out ,
from her dock at Folsom-street j
wharf yesterday at noon, she did
not sail on her voyage to Manila,
and at midnight was still anchored in the
stream. The transport had on board a
large list of passengers and many re
cruits and casuals going to fill vacancies.
Troubles among the engineers and objec
tions to the manner in which the essui
tial help of the engineering department
had been curtailed were given as the seu
sons why the transport did not sail.
Former Chief Engineer G. H. Colbron
and his first assistant, Martin Nagle,
claim that the officers of the transport
forced them to resign, though they were
guilty of no offenses. They claim that
the laws governing vessels in the employ
of the United States Government prohibit
forced resignations, and therefore they
express their intention of calling upon
the Secretary of the Treasury for an in
vestigation.
Whatever may be the grievances of the
chief engineer and his assistant, the fact
remains that Captain liarneson and nis
assistants yesterday encountered great
difficulty in getting the Meade away from
the dock. There has been friction be
tween Captain Wilson, commander of the
transport, and the men who run the en
gines. Captain Wilson claims the en
gineers have been Insubordinate, have re
fused to obey orders, and have otherwi.-.e
conducted themselves contrary to quod
discipline on the seas. The engineers say
they know too much about the way the
transport service is being conducted to
be shut up with a summary dismissal.
When the Meade was ready to sail yes
terday there was a hurried consultation
among the officers, and it was found thu.t
the complement of the engine-room was
far from complete. Anticipating this
trouble Harry McMullen of the Sherman
was impressed as chief engineer and Au
gust Berg, second assistant on the Sher
man, was transferred to the Meade as
first assistant. George Kolb, who waa
chief engineer of the Sherman, was orig
inally scheduled for the place, and not
behig willing to undertake the Job, re
signed.
An attempt was then made to transfer
John Cochran, first engineer of the Grant,
I to the place, but as he declined McMullen
was temporarily forced to take charge.
McMullen seemed to rue his appointment,
| although it was a promotion, and it was
I generally understood that as the help m
Â¦ the boiler and engine rooms was Inade
quate the engineers were not anxious to
go to sea.
Economy in Engine Boom.
It is said that recent assertions made
regarding the expense .of the transport
service has resulted in a spasm of econ
omy, but that Instead of economic meas
ures being used where they might be well
applied the bowels of the ships have been
attacked. Out of a crew of nine oilers
six were discharged. Three of the new
men employed were green hands. An elec
trician was also relieved from duty.
Shortly before noon yesterday L.. F.
Hanson, J. W. Douglas and E. J. Ard,
I second, third and fourth assistant engi
neers, left the ship. It is said that at the
lame time a number of the water ten
ders and electricians wanted to leave, but
were promptly put into irons under order
of Captain Wilson.
The men who left the ship claim that
the economy in the engine room is the
sole cause of their withdrawal, as they
do not wish to imperil their lives or that
of their" charges with an insufficient
amount of help. The matter is very seri
ous, consideredwrom their standpoint, and
rather than go to sea in the manner in
which it was proposed to send out the
Meade they would forfeit their positions
in the transport service.
Many Passengers Aboard.
When the Meade sails the vessel is
scheduled to call at Honolulu, as some of
the passengers on board are destined for
that place. Among those on board are
5 army officers, unassigned; 1 surgeon, fe
male nurse, 2 paymasters U. S. N., 14
members of the signal corps, 1 female
and 4 male teachers, 9 coramissory ser
geants and 72 casuals.

were: Lieutenant Colonel Charles H.

long- standing:, or merely a simple case of
indigestion, relief Is prompt . and pro-

tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eating, sour stomach,
as Indicated by belching, fatigue with
slight exertion or with no exertion at all;
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation,
depression, "blues," these things can com-
monly be set down as symptoms of dys-
pepsia. And dyspepsia Is merely Indiges-

By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves,
restful refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good sound healthy flesh. They make the
skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind
cheerful. â¢
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gest the food and make it easy of assimi-

eased condition of the membranous lin-

bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places and put them into a
healthy, active condition. They effect a
quick and permanent cure. You don't

WILE ATTACK
PRIMARY LAW
Republican Bosses to In
stitute a Test
Case.
State Machine Hopes New
Act Will Be Declared
Unconstitutional
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 16.â Attempt Is to
be made to overthrow the primary law
enacted by the Legislature last winter,
and the powers supporting the movement
are leaders in the Republican State ma
chine. The details of the plan are not
being disclosed, but it is learned that the
new law Is to be taken before the Su
preme Court to test its validity. Should
the new act be declared unconstitutional,
it may be years before California will
have one similar in its intended effects.
The Supreme Court has overthrown three
primary acts, and the late Stephen M.
White once remarked that by the terms
of the existing State constitution Cali
fornia could never enact a. primary law
that the Supreme Court would not de
clare to be inoperative.
Senator Robert Bulla, discussing this
subject to-day, said that if the boss ele
ment In the Republican party sought to
do away with the primary law, the peo
ple of California never would forgive the
leaders of that faction. Any suit aimed
at the existing statute would be defended
by counsel specially employed for the
purpose.
State Senator Thomas Flint Jr. left to
day for Mexico more than satisfied with
the results of his trip south. The Sena
tor had a rousing reception yesterday at
the Soldiers' Home. It was his first visit
to that institution. His lieutenants in the
south, among whom are ex-Senator Rob
ert N. Bulla, Thomas Hughes, Arthur vÂ«.
Kinney and Robert B. Wade, are well
pleased with the impression Flint has
made by his week's canvass through Los
Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and
Orange counties.
Senator Caldwell of Riverside, who is
in Los Angeles, has advised Senator Flint
that his county Is solid for the anti-ma
chine candidate and declares that Sena
tor Flint has won a host of doubters dur
ing his recent visit in Riverside County.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
PIONEER CONTRACTOR
PASSES TO HIS REST
John McCarthy, Who Assisted in the Con
struction of Many Notable Buildings in
This City, Dies After Long Illness
JOHN MCCARTHY, a pioneer con
tracting mason, whoso ability aa a
builder Is permanently represented
In many of the most imposing
structures that this city boast* of,
passed away yesterday morning at his
family residence, 1212 Treat avenue.
Death was due to a complication of dis
eases from which the aged contractor had
suffered for the past seven years. In the
building trades no man in San Francisco
was better known or more respected that
John McCarthy.
The deceased was a native of County
Cork, Ireland, 60 years of age. When he
was 14 years of age he went to London,
where he apprenticed himself to iearn
the trade of a mason. He spent five years
In acquiring the rudiments of the mason's
art. When 20 years of age he came to
America. He settled in Washington, D.
C, and during General Grant's adminis
tration he was appointed to a responsible
position in the Postal Department.
It was not until 1873 that he came to
this city, but his fame as a master work
man had preceded him and he was im
mediately employed to superintend the
brickwork on the Palace Hotel, which
was then in course of construction. Since
hls arrival in Ban Francisco Mr. McCar
thy has been intimately Identified with
the upbuilding of the city. His work on
the Claus Spreckels building, the Chron
icle Spring Valley, Academy of Sciences,
Starr King and many other notable build
ings will stand as a monument to his
ability. .. â, Â
Several years ago he discovered quick
silver ore on property owned by him at
the corner of Devlsadero and McAllister
streets. The ore proved to be of such
high grade that Mr. McCarthy sunk a
shaft, but before actual work was com
menced he abandoned the idea of be
coming a miner. He covered the site with
flats, which have probably proved as re
munerative as the mine would have done
had it been worked.
Mr. McCarthy was essentially domestic
BETTER SERVICE
FOR RICHMOND
Western Union to Place
a Branch in the
District.
The Richmond District is trying to get
nearer the rest of the world and the Point
Lobos Improvement Club is doing its best
to bring about a state of affairs suitable
to the residents of the district. Congress
man Loud has promised to see to the bet
terment of the postal service, but the
Richmond people want something quicker
than the Postofflce Department is able to
provide. They want a telegraph office.
"With this end in view the Point Lobos
Improvement Club addressed an appeal to
the Pacific Postal and Western Union
Telegraph companies. The Postal Com
pany declined to consider the proposition.
They said that the telephone, which Is
installed in most residences could be
used to transmit telegraphic messages to
the telegraph company's headquarters
and that the company would be pleased
to repeat, over the telephone, any mes
sages received. The company could not
afford, however, to establish a branch
office.
The Western Union, however, submit
ted a proposition upon whclh the Rich
mond people will act as soon as possible.
It was to establish an office in some
store,, provided the storekeeper, or the
district, would provide the operator. The
company will not pay the operator any
salary but promises tec' maintain the of
fice and to pay a liberal commission to
whoever takes charge. In this way the
Richmond District expects to place itself
within dot-and-dash distance of every
where. The Point Lobos Improvement
Club is now looking for an operator and
it is expected that within a few weeks
the ticks of Western Union instruments
will be mingling with the other small dis
turbances of Richmond.

ISADORE LESS
IS A DEFAULTER
Secretary of Barbers'
Union Departs to
Avoid Arrest.
Spends Organization's Money
in Attempt to Secure
City Office.
Isadore Less, secretary of the Barbers'
Union, has departed from this city and
there Is a well defined rumor that he was
compelled to seek other parts because he
was short in his accounts. Less was a
candidate for Auditor on the Union La
bor party's ticket. In trying to secure
election he was compelled 10 spend money
for printing and making himself a good
fellow. Being without the necessary
funds, Less borrowed the money that be
longed to the Barbers' Union.
When the news of his defeat was pub
lished to the world Less was in a quan
dary. Ruin stared him in the face if he
could not make up the amount he had
taken from the organization. Rather than
be arrested- for embezzlement and suffer
imprisonment the secretary made up his
mind to depart. Without telling anybody
of his intentions Less left, it is said, for
the City of Mexico.
A meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Barbers' Union was
held yesterday afternoon and when Less
did not put in an appearance, the sus
picions of the officers of the organization
were aroused. An investigation of the
secretary's accounts showed that Less
was short $1500. It was decided to keep
the matter auiet in the hope that Less
would return and make good his defalca
tion. The dishonesty of the. secretary
soon leaked ou^and it was decided to re
port the matteAto the police. Detectives
have been put on Less' track, but up to
the present time have obtained no trace
of him.
A member of the Barbers' Union stated
last evening that Less had little trouble
securing money with which to make his
campaign. As secretary of the organiz
ation it was his duty to handle the funds.
The treasurer, after receiving the money
from him, usually turned over a certain
timount which Less was in duty bound to
send to the parent organization in the
East. He was in the habit of delaying
the forwarding of these sums until they
aggregated many hundreds of dollars. It
is charged that he not only withheld
money in this way, but also falsified his
books in order to show that dues paid
him were still due.
Inquiry at the home of Less last
night developed no clue to his where
abouts. His wife admitted that her
husband had not been home for two days,
but said she had neither seen nor heard
from him since last Thursday morning.
She said:
"My husband left home as usual last
Thursday morning in good spirits. He
said nothing about leaving town, but on
the contrary told me to have a good din
ner ready, as he would be home early.
When he did not show up Thursday night
I became uneasy and when Friday camo
I knew something had happened to keep
him away. Mr. Less was in the habit of
carrying large sums of money around on
his person and it may be that he was
help up.
"I don't think that he ran away with
any of the money belonging to the Bar
bers' Union. Mr. Less is an honest man
and I don't think he would steal. If he
had stolen the money or gone to Mexico
he would have said something to me about
it or left the family provided for. He
did not leave me a cent and for that rea
son I do not believe he has gone.
"Ml Less may have been held up and
robbed and even hidden away by thieves.
There are plepty of men who knew my
husband carried money on his person all
the time who might do an act of that
kind. Until I hear it from his own lips
I will not believe that he has run away
with any of the funds belonging to the
Barbers' Union."
Mrs. Less could offer no explanation for
her husband's act. She said if he had
spent the money during the recent po
litical campaign she knew nothing of it.
She had not been out with him, she said,
and therefore knew nothing of how much
or how little he had spent in the hope
of securing his election.
At the regular meeting of Barbers'
Union No. 148 Monday night the propo
sition of deciding what steps will he
taken on the part of the barbers to aid
the local police in discovering the where
abouts of the absconding secretary will
come up.
Bicycle Thief Caught.
Frank Dunn, who was employed by the
Ringling Brothers circus, was arrested
yesterday by Detectives Ryan, ODea and
Hammill and charged with stealing four
bicycles from Oakland. His alleged vic
tims are J. H. Edner, James Dolan, Hugo
Pierce and W. H. Blake, all of whom live
across the bay. The stolen wheels were
found in different pawnshops in this city.
Dunn will be formally booked on four
charges of grand larceny to-morrow.

California Singer Does
Not Come Up to Ex
pectation.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
A PROPHET may have nÂ© honor
in his own country, but it is
another story where a singer is
concerned. Not Wagner at his
mightiest, not the first night
excitement, not Sembrich the
glorious, nor the regal Eames, drew such
a house as greeted Sybil Sanderson last
night down on Mission street. The crowd
overflowed the seating capacity and stood
three deep round the edges of the house,
to do honor to the former Sacramento
girl on her debut here after sixteen years'
absence.
All the gauds were out, the swellest
gowns, and the house was an unforgot
able picture in itself. It was a sump
tuous greeting to the errant native
daughter, and a rather fine thing in the
way of patriotism.
There was applause a-plenty, flowers
raining over the footlights, and all the
accustomed machinery of welcome work
ing overtime to greet the fair Californmn.
Naturally she was nervous, but respond
ed in gracious and apparently self-con
tained fashion to the friendliness of i.he
audience, and as an arrangement in wel
comes the evening must be voted a bril
liant success.
The opera chosen for the singer's debut
here was Massenet's chocolate creamy
"Manon Lescaut," "opera comique" as
they call it in Paris; âthan which nothing
more startling in the way of contrasts
from "Die. Valkure" of the evening be
fore could have been devised. Its light
some loves and airy sorrows came with an
almost profane comicality after the very
serious business of the week's grand opera
and it left one with that curious feeling
that the average person has after swal
lowing a vegetarian banauet.
There is nothing "to" the opera, as the
phrase goes, and it has no place on a
grand opera programme. Still we had to
have Sybil, and the opera was written
for her. She has sung it some 250 times
in Paris and St. Petersburg, and she was
drilled to its exigencies by Massenet him
self, as Leelle Carter was Belascoed into
shape for "Zaza," Mme. Sanderson cer
tainly knows "Manon" upside down: yet
she was nervous enough last night to
need the assistance of the prompter sev
eral times, so perhaps a certain leeway
must be granted to her.
But, judged from her work in "Manon"
last night, Mme. Sanderson cannot sing
now, whatever she may have done once.
The voice has gone, the control has gone,
and only onee âin her duet in the chapel
at St. Sulpice with Dcs Grieuxâdid her
song give any evidence of the kind of
thing that drew Paris and St. Petersburg
to her feet but a few years ago. There
she was at her Best vocally, but, though
she itf "of ours." It must be regretfully
owned that Sybil Sanderson has no place
in grand opera, and that even "Manon"
overweights her so far as voice is con-
lish novelist, diaries Dickens, or his
works. Mrs. Meynell's .father and Dick
ens were intimate friends and the lec
turer has many personal anecdotes to tell
(<f thp greai writer. The publlo is cordi
ally invited to attend the lecture. No

the St. Sulpice scene, where Sanderson
also did her best work and. roused the

evening held. Journet was Le Comte dcs
Grieux, and also helped to bring the
opera Into the possible realm. Mr. Du

THREE STARS OF THE GRAU GRAND OPERA COMPANY WHO SANG
THE LEADING ROLES IN "FAUST" AND "MANON" YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
SEMBRICH'S MARGUERITE
DOES NOT LACK COLOR
Presentation of "Faust" Arouses Audience to
High Pitcb of Enthusiasm, Singers
Receiving Many Encores.
THERE was no reason to complain
of lack of color- in the Sembrich
Marguerite yesterday afternoon at
the Grand Opera-house. Those
who wish for more than per
fection last year labeled Melba cold
and colorless in the role, though to others
for whom the singer had not already
been docketed with the "technically per
fect but expressionless" class, her Mar
guerite was a most moving conception.
It is not safe to predict what a singer
will be In one role from her achievement
in another, nor even sometimes what she
will be in the same role at different
times. Melba was much that way. Cer
tainly sometimes she showed an almost
impish coldness and the same week
would surprise with a beautiful Marguer
ite, perhaps, that Just swayed the house
to e.ny tune she cared to pipe. I think It
would be safer to put ones money on
Sembrich though, so far as prophecy is
concerned, for with her the heart is al
ways there, whether the imperial voice ia
at its best or not. She gives all of her
self to her audience, loyally, without re
serve, and in turn her audience gives her
as generously what is the very life of the
singerâ sympathy. Melba generally gives
the impression of keeping some of herself
in her pocket for use on future occasions
and the audience is expected to do the
sympathizing, but Sembrich flings her
whole rich, big heart into everything she
does.
A. L. House, Miss E. 8. Wilson, Mrs. R. A.

Lame. Miss L. Reed, Mrs. J. Q. Barker, Mrs.
Stanley Stillman," Mrs. R. S. Bentley, Mrs. E.
B. Cutter and Mrs. T. W. Huntington.
She was not in such perfect vocal form
yesterday, afternoon at the beginning of
the performance, and her "King of
Thube" and the "Jewel Song," though
exquisite and most humanly beautiful,
fallld a little of her usual marvelous per
fection. It was not enough, however, to
prevent a matter of eight or ten curtain
calls in recognition, with a particular en
core for the "Jewel Song." But in the
later scenes the performance was simply
stopped by the clamorous applause, for
Sembrich wfts herself again and the old
time fascination of the opera had begun
to work. The audience was rather a
sleepy one to begin with, even the "Calf
of Gold" song, splendidly sung by De
Rcszke, rousing only a lazy enthusiasm.
But the auditors wakened up after the
third act and encored everything in sight.
Sembrich's Marguerite will live with her
Violetta, and longer as the one role excels
the other.
De Reszke does some things better than
others, but all things well. His Mephisto
is one of his best conceptionsâ a big,
splendid, perhaps too Jovial devil, and a
thing of beauty to behold and hear.
Dippel's is a very likable Faust. He,
too, did not warm up vocally until the
third act, but then gave a virile and
graceful reading of the part. He hits
just the happy medium between sentl
mentalism and coldness, and won signal
favor with the house. Louise Homer was
an attractive Siebel, and the useful
liauermeister wis effective as Martha.
The first dance of the Friday Fortnight
lys will take place on Friday evening,
November 22. The Fortnightly is to be

SANDERSON
IS GREETED
BY SOCIETY
Matinee Results in a
Triumph for All the
Singers
DELIGHT and disappointment
were the features of the two per
formances given yesterday by
the Grau Company at the Grand
Opera-house.
There was keen pleasure for the big
audience that filled the theater in the af
ternoon to hear "Faust," with Sembrich,
Louise Homer, Dippel, De Reszke and
Campanari in the leading roles.
The largest audience of the season gath
ered last night to greet Sybil Sanderson,
but it recognized the fact that Sanderson
is not an artist to be classed with Sem
brich, Eames, Schumann-Heink and Gad
ski.
The excuse was made last night oy the
management that Miss Sanderson was
suffering from nervousness and hoarse
ness, but the fact remains that those in
the audience who expected to hear a
"queen of- song" did not do so.
The superb presentation of "Faust"
given at the matinee will be long remem
bered by all who listened to Gounod's im
mortal creation. The audience was main
ly composed of the fair sex and almost
every seat in the theater was occupied.
The claim that Wagner is the proper
thing to cultivate was disproved yester
day afternoon. "Faust" is a familiar
work and its melodies are known far and
wide. The Wagnerites say "Faust" has
been "done to death," but it Is as popular
as ever.
Opera Traditions Broken.
It was well worth a visit to the Grand
Opera-house yesterday afternoon to listen
to the volume of applause that greeted
the various singers and the chorus and
orchestra. Traditions were thrown to the
winds yesterday afternoon. Not content
with calling the artists before the foot
lights seven times at the close of the gar
den scene, the audience simply went wild
with enthusiasm in the succeeding acts.
When the grand strains of the "Soldiers'
Chorus" were finished the audience ap
plauded for fully two minutes, and Con
ductor Seppill: was obliged to recall the
chorus and military band, to the stage,
and the- number was repeated.
Solos, duets and trios were repealed in
response to the generous applause, but
the grand climax came in the prison
scene. Sembrich," Dippel and De Reszke
gave the great trio is it has never been
heard in this city berore. The voices of
the singers roused the audience to a per
fect frenzy of excitement. Women jumped
to their feet and waved their dainty ker
chiefs, while strong-lunged men shouted
"Bravo." The thread of the dramatic sit
uation was broken by the applause:
Forced to Repeat Aria.
Marguerite, instead of dying, stood bow
ing her acknowledgments, and Mephis
topheles, with Faust, did not descend to
the infernal regions. And the applause
went on until the singers, good naturedly,
repeated the superb aria.
When the gentle spirit of the luckless
German girl was wafted to heaven and
the curtain finally descended the big audi
ence wended it 3 way irto the bright sun
shine of the streets, with the notes of the
singers still ringing in its ears. It will be
a long time ere the classical compositions
of the Bayreuth composer relegate to
oblivion such works as those of Gounod,
Verdi and other famous maestros of the
French and Italian schools.
Society gathered in numbers last night
at the Grand Opera-house to welcome
Sybil Sanderson. Massenet's opera, "Ma
non," was a secondary consideration.
Puccini's opera on the same subject was
heard in San Francisco a few years ago.
but Massenet's work was entirely new.
But what cared society for that? It had
stayed away from the grand opera for a
few nights in order to welcome a daugh
ter of the Golden State. Any opera would
| have served the purpose last night, but as
Miss Sanderson was reputed to be at her
best in "Manon" the management natur
ally announced that work for the Sander
son debut here.
Society Honors Hiss Sanderson.
The house was larger than on Monday
night and hundreds of carriages were
utilized to convey the opera-goers to the
theater. The police were busily engaged
for an hour in seeing that the occupants
of the carriages were allowed to alight
from the vehicles and enter the theater.
The appearance of the lobby and inte
rior of the theater presented a gorgeous
sight. Hundreds of women were dressed
in the latest creations of the modistes and
the marts of trade had been veritably
ransacked by owners of wealth in order
that their fair ones might be present in
fitting gowns at the welcome to Miss San
derson.

appointment for a music and lecture hall.
The building will not be over four
stories in height. Among other features
will be a rehearsal hall with stage, stu
dios for all artists, and a "woman's" club
room. This club room or hall will have
a lecture stage, reception rooms, parlors,
committee rocms and all the privacy of
a lodge building.
The music hall will have a seating ca
pacity of about 5000 people, so that it can
be utilized for conventions as well as for
entertainments. The stage will be ren

necessary accessories.
Â¦ The music hall will have most perfect
accoustics, as the entire scheme of dec
oration will be of woodwork.
The opera chairs will be very roomy,
with plenty of space between the rows.
The orchestra pit will be large enough
to accommodate 150 musicians. One of thÂ«
most delightful features will be a mag

With the welcome given Miss Sanderson
after the first act the excitement suÂ£h

the foyer and discussed the singer of the
evening. There were dozens who had
been schoolmates of Miss Sanderson in
Sacramento and San Francisco, and they
were surrounded by their friends, eager
to hear of what the singer had done be

two continents.
The chief topic of conversation by m?-.

GAMES ON GRIDIRONS EAST AND WEST
SANTA CLARA COLLEGE DEFEATS
LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL AT FOOTBALL
Visitors Score a Touchdown in the Second Half â Sensational
Run /Vlade by Middleton Without Interference-â lncidents of
an Exciting Contest Between Second-Class Pigskin Kickers
*
SANTA CLARA college won
its second victory over the Lowell
High School eleven yesterday by
a ore of 6to 0. The touchdown
might not have been made had
the referee been more watchful and fa
miliar with the rules of the game. Twice
he permitted the college eleven to retain
possession of the ball on the third down
after the fullback had attempted to make
drop kicks from the field. In each in
stance the ball struck his own men and
a Santa Clara player would grab it up
and make the distance. Experts like
Cadwaliader of Yale, Parker of Stanford,
Gammon of the University of California
and other well known players contended
that the ball should have been given to
Lowell, as the college men were off side.
Both decisions were rendered when the
ball was in Lowell's territory and when
its goal was in danger. Had the work of
the officials been better the game would
have been an interesting one. As it
proved, the contest was marred. -
The field was in poor condition, owing
to the recent rains. The players were
unable to keep their footing or get up
â¢peed in their runs. r- ,
Hamilton kicked off Â¦ to Santa Clara's
fifteen-yard line. Magee ran the ball in
ten yards. After trying the line and mak
ing no gains, the college men resorted to
kicking. Magee punted thirty-five yards
and Vosburg ran it in fifteen yards when
heavily tackled. Lowell was unable to
do anything with Santa Clara's line and
was forced to kick. They were penalized
and put back for off-side playing, and
Hamilton punted to the fifteen-yard line.
Magee caught the ball, but was tackled
in his tracks. The ball moved back and
forth, each team losing the pigskin on
3owns or fumbles, and' when the half
ended neither team had scored.
In the second half Santa Clara played

BERKELEY TEAM WINS.
BERKELEY, Nov. 16.â The Berkeley
High School football eleven defeated the
team from the Napa High School this af
ternoon in a semi-final academic athletic
league game played on the university
gridiron. Napa's men were clearly out
classed, and at no time did they come
within striking distance of Berkeley's
Koai. The score was 10-0, the local team
making a touchdown in each half.
The college gridiron was ankle deep in
mud, making fast plays impossible.
Berkeley kicked off in the first half and
kept the ball in Napa's territory until
Patton went through the line for a touch
down. Kern missed an easy goal owing
to the mud and sogginess of the ball. In
the second half Solinsky, the little quar
ter from Berkeley, made the star run of
the day. Berkeley had lost the ball on
a foul "and Coombs of Napa kicked past
center into Solinsky's arms. Solinsky
darted across the field and ran the ball
into the Napa four-yard line before
being downed. Mayo was shot through
left end and tackle for a touchdown.
Kern again missed a goal.
The game was fiercely contested, but
Napa was unable to stop the runs by Pat
ton, Kern. Mayo and McQuestion. Coombs
played a brilliant game for the visitors.
The halves were twenty-five minutes
each. W. B. Albertson was referee and
R. P. Sherman umpire. Louis T. Merwin
and Ralph Lyon were timekeepers.
The teams lined up as follows:

PRINCE AND DUKEâ L. U., Fielding,
Cal. The title of Prince is, commonly
speaking, higher than that of Duke. The
former is a sovereign of a State or Ter
ritory. It is a title inferior to that of a
King, but is that given to the son of a
King or Emperor. The title was once
used to designate a chief, but is now ap
plied to the sons of Kings and Emper
ors. In various parts of Continental Eu
rope the title Prince is borne by fami
ilies of eminent rank but not possessed
of sovereignty, and in England a Duke
is, in strict heraldic language, entitled to
be styled "High Puissant and Most Noble
Prince." Practically, however, in Britain,
the term Prince is restricted to members
of the royal family.

VALUABLE PURSE
FOR THE BOXERS
More Than $30,000 Di
vided Among Fighters
and Club.
Proposed Match Between
Jeffries and Sharkey
in Abeyance.
The total gate receipts of the Jeffnes-
Ruhlin fight were $30,487 50. ' Of this Jef
fries received the lion's share, taking
14,056 52. Ruhlin's share was $4685 54,
while the club officials, who promoted the
affair, took $11,245 44. The remaining $500
to make up the total went to Harry Cor
bett for his services as referee. This was
taken out of the gross receipts, each of
the three parties to the arrangement thus
paying their pro rata.
There were 6610 paid admissions. Of
these 3680 were on the main floor and 2-J3O
in the gallery. The receipts from the gal
lery admissions were $5860. On the main
floor 77 tickets were disposed of at $20
each, 82 at $15. 472 at $10, 757 at $7.60 and
292 at $5.
In addition to the paid admissions there
were the 250 free tickets always set aside
for city officials and others. Besides these
some persons were passed in without
regular tickets. The total amount of
"snow," as Lou Houseman of Chicago
characterizes the free gate, is hard to
estimate.
The counting machines in the Mint
would have had to work at high pressure
to keep pace wiih Jeffries as a money
maker during the twenty minutes he was
in the ring. For each minute of the fight
he received 82, not counting the
amount he received for the kinetoscope
picture privilege. Every beat of his
pulse, which is abnormally slow, thus
adapting itself to the measuring of money,
meant over $12 in gold for the champion.
It would take a laboring man who re
ceives $2 a day for his work nineteen
years, working every day in the year, to
earn what the ex-boiler-maker made in
twenty minutes. N. B. â Boiler-makers
who are not "ex," please note.
For each punch Ruhlin received he was
paidâ but these are harrowing details
when viewed from the standpoint of the
men who paid to see a championship fight.
The consensus of opinion yesterday was
that Ruhlin should have been sent up in
the sixth round to take the knockout
punch which was inevitable. Billy Mad
den does not take this view of It, saying
he was not going to take the chance of
having his man killed in the ring, whicli
was a possibility. It is generally conceded
Ruhlin was badly frightened by Jeffries.
This was shown in his attitude, one he
was never seen to adopt in all the time
he was training.
Jeffries went to the races yesterday.
Last night, chaperoned by Harry Corbett
and Policeman Tommy Naylor, he went
throuerh Chinatown. In the party were
"Lou" Houseman, George Slier, E. Gay
White and Sandy Griswold, visiting news
paper men.
There wajr but little discussiQn yester
day of a match next month between Jef
fries and Sharkey. The fight promoters
apparently desire to have the bad impres
sion cheated by Friday nfght's fight fade
out of the mempries of the ring patrons.

YALE EASILY DEFEATS PRINCETON
IN THE ANNUAL FOOTBALL CONTEST
Sons of Eli Show Their Superiority in a Game Characterized by
the Absence of Unfair Tactics, but Two Penalties Being Im
posed, and in the Dishonors the Rival Teams Showed Equally
NEW HAVEN. Conn., Nov. 16.â
Yale defeated Princeton in the
annual football contest at Yale
field to-day by the score of 12 to
0. The score, according to the
experts who witnessed the game, repre
sents accurately the superiority of the
sons of Eli. Aside from the general ex
cellence of the Yale :eam the feature of
the play was to be Icund in the entire
absence of unfair tactics. During the
game, lasting nearly iwo hours including
the intermission and the time taken out
by delays resulting l'rom injuries, but
two penalties were :mposed, the rival
teams being equally guilty.
On two occasions players were warned
by the umpire for tactics unnecessarily
rough, but on these occasions, as in the
instances of offside nlay, the dishonors
were even.
The game was won by Yale as a result
of the simplest kind of old-fashioned foot
ball, rendered effective by entire con
sistency in team play and a physical con
dition which enabled the sons of Eli to
"las:" through a grueling contest. Prince
ton, on the other hand, displayed a ten
dency to go to pieces at timdb, and
throughout the game her men required
frequent nursing. Yale played throughout
the seventy minutes of actual play with
a single accident, when Captain Kunzig
of the varsity boat crew took the place
of Goss at left tackle. Princeton found
it necessary to call upon seven substi
tutes, and the introduction of theso half
dozen fresh men enabled her to make a
superb finish of a contest which had been
altogether uphill.
Yale Was Never in. Danger.
Yale's goal line was never in danger.
Indeed, the Princeton players never
reached a point nearer Yale's goal than
the thirty-yard line. Yale scored two
touchdowns, cne In each hair, and each
of these scores was converted cleverly
into a goal by Olcott.
Yale's touchdowns tame as a result of
a superbly developed system of line plung
ine in which the famous tackles-back
in Pll their formations netted the great
est pains. Yale's backs assisted by a
sprightly set of forwards found holes
in the : Princeton line which enabled
them to make gains when they once
found their pace, arul touchdowns were
inevitable with the nmsniflcent team work
displayed by Yale as the occasion de
manded it. Â
Yale's first touchdown was made after
about fifteen minutes of play. A fumble
by Princeton at the center of the field
gave Yale her chance, and seizing the
ball on Princeton's ten-yard line, the
Yale men forced the ball over for the
first score. The rest of the first-half wit
nessed many exchanges of kicks.
Yale required about twenty minutes of
play in the second-half to score the sec
ond touchdown. This score, like its pre
decessor, came as a result of straight
football, made possible by great strength
and superior team play.
Honors T>ivided as to Kicking.
Honors were evenly divided as to kick
ing De Saulles, the little Yale quarter
back, holding his own amazingly well
with De Witt. In the handling of kicks
Princeton excelled a trifle. In the matter
of scrimmages, however. Yale's play was
impressively cleaner, Princeton time and
again losing the ball on deplorable fum
bles. Throughout the game the play was
largely in Princeton's territory.
From the kick-off at the start of the
game Yale did not let up until the first
touchdown had been made. Then she re
sorted to the kicking game and the
scrimmages were confined to the middle
of the field. So, too, in the second half
the New HaVen boys clung to the ball
amazingly, and confined the play to the
Tigers' territory until another six points
had been added to the Yale score.
When the score was twelve to nothing
against them the Princetons disclosed
that never-say-dle spirit, which so often
has won great victories in the past and
gave a superb exhibition of "last-ditch"
fighting. Unquestionably beaten and with
seven-elevenths of the team substitutes,
the heroes of old Nassau went at it and
fairly lifted the Yale men from, their feet.
Then it was, for the first time in the sec
ond half, that the Princeton men forced
the play into Yale territory and for the
last fifteen minutes cf the game Yale was
decidedly on the defensive. Barndoor
holes were torn in the hitherto invincible
Yale line and amazing distances were
gained by the New Jersey men. The
brace had come too late, however, and
time was called for the last of the game.

HARVARD MEETS DARTMOUTH
Defeats letter Although Playing a
Team of Substitutes.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 16.â Harvard
defeated Dartmouth by a score of 27 to
12 this afternoon with a team composed of
substitutes and without Captain Camp
bell. Dartmouth scored a touchdown in
each half after blocking punts by Har
vard. . Putnam was slow in getting his
kicks off and the subs-titute linemen al

NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â Cornell 24, Co
lumbia 0. These figures tell the downfall
of Columbia's football team this after
noon on the Polo grounds, where the
Morningside Heights boys were outgen
eraled and outplayed by the sturdy rep
resentatives of Cornell. Coach Starbuck
outwitted Coach Sanford, and every play
and every gain made by the Ithacans
seemed to surprise and bewilder the Co
lumbia players.
Columbia put its best team into the
field for to-day's game. She sent all her
strongest players into the line-up, with
one exception. That one was Harold
Weekes, who was disabled by an injured
knee and had to lie on the side lines while
time and time again he saw opportunities
where by hi 3 famous hurdling and rush
ing tactics he might have scored.
The Cornell men as a team played like
one man, and at every stage of the game
proved themselves superiors of the men
against whom they were pitted.

in danger but once. Attendance, 15,000.

CARS COLLIDE
AT A CROSSING
Passenger Is Thrown to
the Ground and
Injured.
Confusion of the Motorman
Said to Be Cause of
Accident.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway. Nov. 16.
Two cars or the Oakland Transit Com
pany collided at 6:30 o'clock this after
coon at East Fourteenth street and
Frultvale avenue, throwing the fifty cr
more passengers into confusion and seri
ously injuring one. Mrs. F. M. Colvln of
$91 Montgomery street, Fruitvale, was
thrown to the ground so heavily that she
received a severe contusion of the head
that was subsequently treated by Dr. J.
H. Callen. None of the other passengers
were hurt, but all were more or less
shaken up.
The colliding cars belong to the Hay
Â¦wards and Fruitvale avenue divisions of
the Transit Company's system. The Hay
xrards car was going- toward Oakland and
the Fruitvale car was heading toward
Fruitvale. When about half way across
the tracks at the corner of Fourteenth
etreet and Fruitvale avenue the Fruitvale
car was struck near the end by the Hay
Â¦wards car. which was moving at a fair
rate of speed. So great was the impact
that the Fruitvale car was lifted off the
tracks and turned almost completely
around. The crash of shattered glass
mingled with the cries oÂ£ the frightened
passengers, few of whom had time to
Jump on account of the suddenness of the
collision.
Just who is responsible for the accident
has not yet been determined by the rail
road officials. It is 6aid to be the result
of misunderstanding on the part of the
motormen, though at the point of colli
sion the way is clear and the Fruitvale
car is understood to have the right of
Way.

CHASTISES BOY
IN SCHOOLROOM
Instructor Mohr Takes
Intractable Pupil
to Task.
Tempest in a Teapot Results
From the Overt In
cident.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 16.
Something of a teapot tempest has been
raised in the local School Department by
the summary chastisement or one of the
intractable students of the High School
by Paul J. Mohr, instructor in mathe
matics and sciences. Considerable noto
riety has been the lot of Mr.v Mohr for
his action and it has been talked over
by the school authorities, but now it has
simmered down to the point where the
culprit makes his peace with his mentor
and fellow pupils and there is hardly any
thing more tv discuss. Instructor Mohr
will probably have his attention directed
to his infraction of tne department rule,
which prohibits teachers 'from laying
hands on their charges, even if they are
angry.
The incident which has caused all the
hubbub occurred yesterday afternoon
when Edward Fickes. a 16-year-old mem
ber of the B ninth class at the High
School, crossed Mr. Mohr. Under partic
ularly exasperating circumstances tne in
structor found it difficult to keep his head
and he seized the boy by the coat collar,
clapped him on the cheeits and then hus
tled him out of the room on the double
quick. Some of the other students be
came frightened, it is said, at Mr. Mohr's
attitude and rushed from the room. It is
these who are credited with spreading the
story of misapplied authority.
Instructor Mohr thinks he was alto
gether justified in pursuing the course he
did, although hÂ© regrets that in a mo
ment of anger he committed an infrac
tion of one of the rules of the depart
ment. His version of the affair is as
follows:
I had occasion to call the class to order yes
terday afternoon and in the course of my re
marks I took occasion to say that manliness
and courtesy in the classroom was a much more
important matter even than the sciences we
had been discussing. This boy repeated the
words " manliness and "courtesy" after me
in mockery, and under the circumstances 1
could not help but feel angry.
I took him by the lapels of the coat with my
left hand and slapped him with my right on
the cheek. Then I asked him how he dared to
say anything at such a moment. He asked me
what he had done and tried to give the Im
pression that he had done nothing. I raised
him from his seat then and walked him out of
the room.
This morning I called on the boy's father.
The boy had not told him of anything that had
occurred. I explained the whole matter to him
and he said I had done Just right. We had an
Interview with the boy, during which he ad
mitted he was wrong and signed a statement
In which he apologized for hlÂ» conduct toward
me and the class.
School Superintendent McClymonds was
inclined to be non-committal In his views
of thÂ© case. He asserted that the boy
had been deservedly punished, but
thought that his acts did not justify the
instructor in using violence.
"Yes," said Superintendent McCly
monds, "I think the boy got what he de
served, but it seems to me that his con
duct does not warrant the breaking of
the rules of the Board of Education.
Corporal punishment is prohibited in the
schools of this city."
As to what action thÂ© Board of Educa
tion would take in thÂ© matter Superin
tendent McClymonds said he was not pre
pared to cay.
"The rules belong to the board and it
li for the directors to determine what
shall be done," explained the Superin
tendent.

HAWAIXANS REALIZE
MONARCHY IS LOST
Their Duty Set Forth in a Newspaper
Published by Delegate Wil
cox's Wife.
HONOLULU, Nov. 9.â Mrs. Theresa
Wilcox, wife of the Hawaiian delegate to
Congress, has started a semi-weekly pa
per in this city, devoted to thÂ© Home RulÂ©
Republican party. It is named the Home
Rule Republican. S. Meheula, clerk of
the House of Representatives, is the edi
tor. The first issue of the paper appeared
a week ago. In the prospectus the editor
says in speaking of the establishment of
American government here:
"We, the Hawaiians, have had this in
estimable boon conferred on us through
the exigencies and necessities of the
United States in their Spanish-American
v. ar. The past is gone and irrevocable.
Seme of us Hawaiiajis no doubt would
gladly welcome back thÂ© former condi
tion of things, if things could be restored
to just how they were during the mon
archy, but the majority of us recognize
the futility of such a dream and desire
with all our hearts to educate such of our
race to the point of understanding and
appreciating the glorious boon of 'equal
rights' of the free and unrestricted ballot.
"The Hawaiian is now standing at tKe
crossways of life, undecided which path
way to take. The actions of some of
those who should have been his guides
and friends have created distrust. A new
order of things has been thrust upon him.
He is eager and anxious to do his duty
and to qualify himself for the new ones."
The paper is published in both Hawaiian
and English and is mostly devoted to po
litical subjects.
Fortifications in Hawaii.
HONOLULU, Nov. 10.â The United
States Army Board appointed to select
6ites and make plans for thÂ© fortification
of Honolulu and Paarl Harbor has been
at work here for the past few days. It
is understood that a number of suitable
locations have been settled upon, but they
will not be made public yet. At Pearl
Harbor, it is stated, there will be a large
turret, some distance out to sea from the
entrance, commanding the approach for
many miles.
Violates Eight-Hour Law.
HONOLULU. Nov. 10.â W. M. Camp
bell, formerly of San Francisco, was tried
in the Federal Court last week on a
charge of violating the United States
eight-hour law by working his men nine
hours a day on the Government contract
on the naval reservation. He employs
Japanese and the proceedings were insti
tuted by the local labor unions. Camp
bell was acquitted by a jury, as was also
his subcontractor, Oha, a Japanese, who
was tried on a similar charge.
Polygamy in Hawaii.
HONOLULU, Nov. 10.â A number of
prosecutions under the Edmunds act are
engaging the attention of the Federal
Court. In one case a couple who pleaded
guiliy to a certain charge were married
while in custody. Judge Estee used his
influence to have the sentence reprieved
by Governcr Dole, and the President has
been asked to grant a pardon.
Clubhouse at Pearl Harbor.
HOXOI.n.r, Nov. 10.-The new Hono

consideration for a quite elaborate boat
house.

STUDENTS WILL
TAKE THE STUMP
To Do Campaign Work
for the School Bonds
in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 16.â High school boy
orators* on thÂ© stump, arguing for the
carrying of the $100,000 school bonds, will
be the feature of the campaign now being
waged in favor of the proposition.
Next week the young speakers are to be
selected, posted upon the issue involved
and instructed how to "do politics" in the
best and patriotic sense of the phrase.
F. N. Delanoy, president of the Board of
Trade, will give the chosen spell-binding
youths a series of heart-to-heart lectures
on the latest improved methods of carry
ing a contest at the polls, i
There are more than 2500 pupils in dally
attendance at the public schools, and it Is
confidently calculated by the supporters
of the bond movement that parents can,
through the persuasion of their children,
be induced to take an active interest In
promoting the success of the undertaking.
Class meetings and mass meetings of
thÂ© scholars of the high school and the
several grammar schools will be held.
The necessity of bonds for school Im
provements and extension will be ex
plained by the duly authorized speakers,
and each and every pupil will be urged to
do all he or she can to place the matter
before parents in its practical light.
With few exceptions all the members of
the Board of Trade are for the issuance
of school bonds. President Delanoy Is
enthusiastic over the plan of enlisting the
school children in the battle for bonds
"I am going to secure from Principal
A. W. Scott of the high school twelve
brainy boys," said he. "I will form
them into a central committee arid we
will lay out our programme for meetings
and work just as if we were conducting a
city or county election campaign. The
bonds must carry. It is a public need
When we enroll the 2500 school children of
Alameda in the cause, as we expect to do
there can be but one result, and that will
be victory. Each child will bÂ« a walking
delegate, so to speak, to see that the
bonds are not overlooked. We will com
mence our labors next week and will have
to be lively, as the election occurs on
November 29."

AGAIN OPPOSES
SHIPPING BILL
Principle Not Believed In
by Congressman
Burton.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â Senator
Hanna of Ohio, who is one of the chief
advocates of the ship subsidy legislation,
again finds the strongest opposition in his
own camp. Representative T. E. Bur
ton of Cleveland, Hanna' s home city, has
returned to tho capital entertaining more
strongly than ever his old feeling against
the shipping measure.
As Burton will again father the river
and harbor bill, the history of the last
session may be repeated In the defeat of
the pet schemes of both Hanna and Bur
ton. In speaking of the subsidy bill Bur
ton said:
"I am opposed to the measure just as
I was last winter. I do not believe in
the principle. I do not believe it would
be permanently effective In building up
our merchant marine, nor that its bene
fits would accrue in the way of reduced
freight rates for our agricultural and
other products."
Congress failed to pass the subsidy bill
last winter. It failed to pasa the river
and harbor bill. The defeat of the latter
measure was attributed to the failure of
the former. Leading advocates of appro
priations for river and harbor improve
ments asserted that the men most earn
est in urging the ship subsidy legislation
were responsible for the defeat of the
river and harbor bill. This impeachment
was not vigorously denied. It was be
lieved then and is believed now that the
measure which bore Burton's name would
have passed had fatal opposition not de
veloped against the subsidy bill.
President Roosevelt will recommend
legislation looking toward the upbuilding
of the American merchant marine. He
will not, however, suggest any specific
measure or means cf accomplishing this
result. Ship subsidy is Hanna's hobby;
rivers and harbors are Burton's. Each
has his heart set upon securing the enact
ment of the legislation he desires. As a
consequence of Burton's opposition to the
subsidies, Hanna may stand in the way
of river and harbor legislation.
Secret Political Society.
HONOLULU, Nov. 10.â A new political
society, somewhat secret, has been
formed by Hawaiians in Hilo district, on
the island of Hawaii. It has for its ob
ject the supplanting of the old Home
Rule organization by a more Republican
party, but one devoted nevertheless, first
of all to the policy of maintaining na
tives' influence in the political affairs of
the islands.

FIND A FORTUNE
ON A WANDERER
Police Discover Big Bank
Account on Suppos
ed Pauper.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 16.
Picked up on the street as a pauper,
wandering about in rags and homeless,
aged Peter Flynn astounded the police to
day when a $10,000 balance to his credit in
a bankbook was found on his person at
the City Prison.
The bare fact that he is Peter Flynn,
about 65 years of age, is all that the po
lice have been able to glean from their
strange lodger. He will be detained at the
prison until something more is learned of
his antecedents. The old man refuses to
disclose a single bit of information about
himself or his hoard of wealth represent
ed by thÂ© bankbook entries. Externally
there was nothing about his appearance
to suggest that Flynn was other than a
decrepit and poverty-stricken old man
who would end his days as a public
charge.
He had only 80 cents in coin In his pos
session when the police took him in charge.
The records of his bank account show that
it has not been touched for several years.
"We have tried our best to get some
line on the old man's connections," said
Jailer Swain to-night, "but so far we have
been unsuccessful. Flynn seems to be suf
fering from some sort of brain trouble.
He acts as if he were dazed. He certainly
is a mystery to us."
The old man has been a familiar char
acter on the streets for some time. At In
tervals he would disappear from view, but
after a short absence would reappear and
resume his aimless wanderings about the
city. Unless some relatives appear an ef
fort will be made by the authorities to
have a legal guardian appointed for their
mysterious ward, that he may be given
proper attention and care.
Thrown From Her Vehicle.
BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 16.â Mrs. J. W.
Bruner,- a lady well known throughout
this county, sustained a fracture of three
ribs on the right side within two inches
of the spinal column, last evening in Jew
ett's Lane, while driving to the Kern
River oil fields. She was thrown violently
to the ground in a collision with a doilble
team, which was being driven rapidly in
the direction of this city. Mrs. Brun?r
was rendered unconscious by the fall.
She was brought into this city for medical
treatment by the men who were driving
the team with which she collided, but
their names have not been ascertained.
SAYS SIGNATURE
IS A FORGERY
Court Holds Mrs. Lottie
Logan Did Not Sign
Release.
"Difference in Writing So
Glaring a Blind Man
Could See It"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 16.
To the satisfaction of Judge Hall it was
demonstrated that the signature of Mrs.
Lottie Logan that appears appended to
a release of a mortgage is a forgery. Carl
Elsenschmel, the expert penman, informed
the court that the name was a rank Imi
tation, and pointed out the discrepancies
that existed between the forged hand
writing and thÂ© genuine signature of Mrs.
Logan.
In rendering hia decision setting aside
the alleged release Judge Hall said that
it hardly required an expert to see the
differences between the two exhibits, as
they are so bald that a blind man could
distinguish them. He took occasion to ut
ter criticisms against J. A. Parker, a real
estate broker, and J. Robinson> witnesses
for the defendant, saying that he thought
that either one of them knew more than
they had told about the spurious signa
ture. When he testified Robinson said
that he had taken the release to Mrs.
Logan in San Francisco, where she signed
it. Mrs. Logan's physician testified that
she was too ill at the time Robir.son said
he called to have seen any one.
The forgery is the outgrowth of a suit
by G. U. Ochs against William Clark to
foreclose on a loan of $600 on an assigned
note from Mrs. Logan. The security for
thÂ© note was some Placer County land
and an indorsement by Mrs. V. R. Par
ker for two lots in Berkeley. Clark de
faulted in his payments and when the
foreclosure proceedings were brought
against him the release of mortgage from
Mrs. Logan suddenly made its appear
ance.

TRIES TO BORN
TWO DWELLINGS
Incendiary Attacks Mrs.
Isabella J. Martin's
CottagSs.
Drenches Floor and Walls
With Kerosene Oil and
Gasoline.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. Id.
Two cottages at West and Twenty-sec
ond streets, owned by Mrs. Isabella J.
Martin of Martin will contest fame, were
the objects of an inccimary's flagrant at
tempt at destruction this morning. ThÂ«
evidence of arson was so palpable that
after Fire Chief Ball had extinguished
the flames, which got good headway in
one of the houses, hi could only express
his surprise at the open character of the
crime.
Both of the small dwellings were unoc
cupied, the owner rest- ling in a flat a lew
doors from them. W'nen neighbors,
aroused by the tire at b:3O o'clocit. sent
in an alarm Mrs. Maitin appeared for a
moment and then retired, announcing
that she was very ill.
The lire broke out at the house 1534
West street. The department subdued the
flames after $300 damage had been done,
and then started to learn what had
caused the outbreak. It was easy to dis
cover. The floors, walls and standing fix
tures in the dwelling? had been saturated
with coal oil. In one room a shirt and
bundles of old papers wet with gasoline;
and kerosene were uncovered.
The firemen went further and found that
the next door cottage, at 1530 West street,
had been as carefully prepared for the
flames by the unknown incendiary. Hera
the rear door was wide open. A train of
excelsior and waste soaked with coal oil
was laid from the dcor into several
rooms. Under the kitchen sink two fruit
jars Jilled with gasoline were brought to
lierh* In several rooms kerosene had been
liberally spilled upon the floors.
Several windows arc the back door
were wide open. Th.s cottage was only
scorched. It Is supposed the arsonist pro
posed to set that dw-lllng on fire as Its
neighbor was also fired, but was fright
ened away after comcleting preparations.
During his investigation Fire Chief Ball
learned that each dwelling was Insured
for $1500.
Mrs. Martin declared that she was at a
less to explain the fires. The waste and
excelsior in the dwelling was accounted
for by the statement she was shortly
going on a loner journey and had used the
stuff for parking puro.Vpes.
Chief of Police Hodjrk'ns has directed
Detective Holland to find the incendiary
If possible.

JURY DECLARES
A WILL INVALID
Finds That Undue Influ
ence Was Exerted by-
Beneficiary.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 16.â The contest
over the will of Mrs. Letltla Robinson
in the Delaware County Court at Media
came to an end to-day, when the sealed
verdict of the jury, rendered last night,
Â¦was opened by Judge Johnson. The jury
held that the will should be broken on
the ground of undue influence. The jury
retired last Monday noon and twice came
into court with the announcement that
they could not agree, but were each time
cent back by Judge Johnson, who in
formed them that all the evidence avail
able had been adduced.
The contest continued over a. period of
forty days, and much sensational testi
mony was given.
Letitia Kobinson, mother of United
States Marshal and former Congressman
John B. Robinson, died last November,
leaving an estate valued at $80,000 to Mar
fctud mo binson, her only surviving ton,
with whom she had lived for many years.
A caveat was tiled against the probat
â¢ Ing of the will in the names of Anna and
Gerald O. H . Robinson of Cleveland,
children of Eckles Robinson, a younger
ton of the testratrix, who died in 1890.
The contest was made on the ground of
undue Influence and irregularity in the
execution of the will. Eckles ftobinaon
Â¦was divorced from his wife when their
children were 12 and 14 years old, and the
witnesses stated that after the separation
he never recognized them, in any way.
The real estate left by Mrs. Robinson
is located principally in Pittsburg and
Allegheny.
The Jury found that the signature of
Letitia Robinson attached to the will was
genuine; that the will was properly ex*
cuted by the testratrix; that Letitia Rob
inson was of sound mind when the testa
ment was signed; but that she affixed
her signature to the document because cf
undue influence exerted by John. Robin
son.
Counsel for Robinson gave notice of ap
peal, and Marshal Robinson, after the
verdict had been rendered, announced
that the case would be taken before the
Supreme Court.

ress there, and the outlook Is favorable
for at least 1000 new members a month
from that country and New Zealand.
Knights of Golden Eagle.
At the recent session of the Supreme
Castle of the Knights of the Golden Eagle,
held in Buffalo, S. M. Harlan of Union
City, Ind., became past supreme chief; S.
J. Southard of Bellefontaine, Ohio, was
chosen supreme chief, and A. C. Lyttle of
Philadelphia was re-elected supreme
master of records.
It is expected that the present supreme
chief will follow the example of his pre
decessor in the matter of making visita
tions 'to the West, as the visit of Supreme
Chief Harlan some time ago resulted In a
great deal of good. The new chief has
not yet announced his deputies for this
city, but it is presumed that he will con
tinue in these positions W. O. Macdou
goll, who has held the office for many
years, and C. A. McGowan, who was ap
pointed some time ago. Both have been
active workers for the advancement of
the order.
There arc now two castles of the order
In this city. California No. 1 and San
Francisco No. 2, and In a short time
William McKinley Castle No. 3, will be
Instituted, the petition for a charter be
ing ready for transmission to the Su
preme Castle.
Pacific Temple No. 1 will soon be Insti
tuted by Deputy McGowan. It will start
with a charter list of about 100 members
embracing sir knights, their lady rela
tives and lady friends. A temple Is a
ladies' auxiliary of the parent order.
Foresters of America.
On the night of the 13th inst, Court Gen
eral Lawton of the Foresters of America
had a large meeting, and after the close
of business there was a high jinks ani
smoker tendered to Court Deputy Abe
Coleman, who recently returned from
Baltimore, where he attended the session
of the Supreme Court of the order as a
representative from this State. Among
those who were in attendance were Grand

retary John J. Cordy and Representative
E. Hayden. There was an entertaining
programme of varied numbers presented

PROGRESS MADE
SUITS PORTER
Combination of Oil Men
of Two Regions Con
tinues.
The Associated Oil Company is making
good progress toward completing its or
ganization. It was anticipated at the be
ginlng that necessarily some time would
elapse before all the companies, through
their stockholders, in the Kern and Me-
Klttrick fields could ratify the recommen
dations made by the committees of their
boards of directors. The first steps were
well calculated to enlis-t confidence. The
appraisements of ttio properties were
made carefully, and everything that could
be done was done to show that the great
combination to be perfected in the Interest
of producers was basecj on strictly busi
ness principles. Some papers in the State
seem to regard it as .1 new discovery that
the producing companies of the McKit
trick field are included in the combine.
The fact that ihey wcie included was an
nounced in this paper months ago. W. S.
Porter declares that the progress is satis
factory.
Unlisted Stocks Called.
The Los Angeles Stock Exchange has
decided to have stocks that are not listed
called every day after the regularly listed
ones. The explanation furnished for this
move Is that it will enable the public in
the East and at homo to discriminate be
tween bona fide stock 3 and the others
that are being floated principally for the
benefit of promoters. The Los Angeles
Herald says:
JuÂ«t at present there la quite a boom in min
ing and the exaggerated accounts of oil devel
opment that have fljeured and are to-day fig
uring In the Eastern papers are being out
ranked tiy the advertisements of gold, silver
and copper companies seeking to float their
stock into the hands of the unenlightened
Easterners at office prices. For such com
panies as these it is undesirable that their
stocks should be quoted In the exchanges, for
a prospective buyer will have his confidence
somewhat shaken when he sees the stock that
he is asked 50 cents for quoted at less than
half that amount. Indeed, some companies
have sent a request to the Stock Exchange that
their stock be omitted from the call. This
request will not be granted, and henceforward
unlisted stocks that are offered will be quoted
and published.
The new Pacific oil refinery at Bakers
field is ready to receive its machinery.
The plant will have a capacity of 1800
barrels per day. The oil will be drawn
to the works by the Santa Fe, which has
constructed a spur track for the service.
The proposition to build a pipe line to the
Kern River field to save the rail tolls has
been discussed.
The San Jose Mercury is responsible for
the statement that oi! has been struck
near San Jose. It was found in small
quantity. The Mercury says that the
company Is drilling on the Los Gatos road
about six miles west from San Jose. On
the same land parties drilled for oil some
years ago and went down 600 feet, when
they were forced to quit for lack of prop
er appliances. The present operations are
not in the old well, but are not far from
it. Manager Conkling tells the Mercury
that his company Is prepared to drill 1500
feet if necessary.
Situation at Beaumont.
The producers of the Beaumont field
are proposing the organization of a $100.-.
00,000 combination. There Is a great ac
cumulation of oil in the field and no pres
ent sufficient market for It. Pipe lines
are being laid and the first tank steamer
has sailed for Londi.n. The production
has been very large and it will take a
long time to rid of it. In the mean
time the companies are acting like the
companies in Californiaâ trying to market
their oil for what they can get at once.
New York men have sent a circular to
each of the companies asking the boards
of directors to take favorable action to
ward effecting a combination.
The Los Angeles Herald tellÂ» of a well
en Cottage Home street, in Los Angeles,
that was drilled recently and yielded 200
barrels during the first twenty-four hours
after it was complete.!, and has given up
100 barrels per day for the last two weeks.
It is reported by the Los Angeles Her
ald that Antelope Valley will be thor
oughly explored for water and oil. If oil
is not found and water is discovered then
the owners of the lard stand to win, for
the soil has been found to be excellent for
the production of grapes, almonds and
cherries. Two Los Angeles banks and
many prominent citizens have holdings
in the valley, and there is accordingly a
chance that a strong company will be or
ganized to drill.
The beautiful Doll House which attract
ed so much attention at the recent Doll
Show given under the auspices of the Doc
tor's Daughters and which was presented
by the Misses Spreckels (daughters of Mr.
John D. Spreckels), Is now and has been
for the last few days, on exhibition in the
show windows of W. J. Sloane & Co.
The Interior decorations, which have been
commented upon so fa\ f orably, were car
ried out In every detail of harmony and
color effect, under the direct supervision
of Mr. F. J. Staunton, artistic decorator of
"W. J. Sloane & Co.
The Doll House will remain on exhibi
tion during the coming week.

DOCTOR RODLEY
MUST DO TIME
Perjurer in Fuller Will
Case Is Denied a
Retrial.
Attorney General Ford received a. tele
gram from the United States Supreme
Court yesterday, stating that a new trial
had been denied Dr. J. Ellis Rodley ot
Chico, Butte County. Rodley was con
victed of perjury In the Fuller will case
about two years ago and sentenced to
twelve years imprisonment In the State
penitentiary. The_case haa been fought
unsuccessfully through all the courts and
now nothing remains to the prisoner Hue
to pay the penalty for his crime.
A. Fuller of Chlco died In October, 1897,
leaving no will and an estate valued at
about $30,000. A year later a Mrs. Minnie
Houseworth who had been Fuller's house
keeper, came forward with an alleged will
from which it seemed that the testator
bequeathed all his property to her except
$1000, which was to be divided among the
legal heirs. Dr. Rodley and J. M. Garner
were the subscribing witnesses.
When the will was offered for probate
both swore that Fuller had executed it in
their presence. The heirs instituted pro
ceedings to contest the validity of the
document and subsequently Garner ad
mitted that his previous testlmonv
false and that he had been promised JtOt'O
to sign his name to the forged will.
Rodley, the only one of the three who
has been tried as yet, was sentenced to
twelve years at Folsom. He appealed to
the State Supreme Court. The judgment
and order of the lower court were affirmed
and hia attorneys decided to carry the
matter to the court of last resort. Ac
cordingly a writ of error was sued ou; In
the United States SuDreme Court on the
ground that the indictment was detective.
Attorney General Ford filed a petition for
dismissal, contending that no Federal
question was involved.
The case was heard in Washington on
November 11 and the decision, which is
fatal to Rodley's hopes of liberty, was
handed down yesterday.
Cause of Overcrowded Schools.
School Director Dei>:nan stated yester
day that the reason for the congested at
tendance in the public schools was the
increase in the population In the city, and
not that there were insufficient accommo
dations. Penman gives it as hia opinion
that the population has Increased by 10,
00 during the last seven months, and that
consequently more children were being
sent to school. Denman says step* are
brfinff taken rapidly to provide accommo
dations and instances the establishment
of four new classes Ust week.

THE RAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
M'NEILL RUNS
FROM HIS WIFE
Asks a Divorce, Alleging
That She Tried to
Kill Him.
Claims That She Used Clubs,
Knives, Pistols and Pokers
On Him.
Daniel McNelll, formerly a journalist,
but now an employe of Darby Layden,
the contractor, has had a right mefry
time of it frustrating his wife's attempts
to end his existence, if the allegations he
makes in a complaint tor divorce he filed
yesterday are truthful His wife Alioe,
according to McNeill, Is termagent, and
she has, he alleges, on numerous occa
sions and by means of all sorts of weap
ons made strenuous efforts to send him
over the river Styx.
McNeill commences his tale of woe by
reciting the fact that he was married in
April, 1869, and that for several years
thereafter he enjoyed conjugal bliss. It
was in 1898, alleges the erstwhile journal
ist, that his troubles began and, judging
from the complaint, they began in earnest.
In that year, alleges McNeill, his Alice,
armed with a butcher knife, chased him
down Folsom street and would have cut
short his earthly career but for his fleet
ness of foot. His respite was but tem
porary, it seems, for in the following year,
he alleges, Mrs. McNeill "got her hammer
out" and endeavored to kill him with it.
McNeill must have borne a charmed
life, for he escaped, and until September,
1900, evidently lived in peace.
In that month, alleges McNeill, his wife
chased him along Fifth street, armed with
a razor, club and pistol, and was only
prevented from doing him and some
of his friends bodly injury by the timely
arrival of a policeman.
On the 14th of the present month, Mc-
Neill still further alleges, his spouseJieat
ed a poker and attempted to ruin his
beauty with it, and, he alleges, whenshe
failed in her desperate attempt grasped
a pair of scissors and tried to gouge out
his eyes.

FINDING MONEY
FOR THE MINES
Aubury Furnishes Need
ed Facts to Secure
Investors.
Pacific Coast Properties Are
Making Returns to
Owners.
The copper bulletin to be Issued by the
State Mineralogist some time next month
will show who owns every copper pros
pect or claim that has been discovered in
California, and will give the postofflce ad
dress of each owner. Moreover, the bul
letin will be accompanied by a map upon
which all the principal deposits will ap
pear accurately located in reference .to
railroads, rivers and water courses and to
near-by towns. In addition to this there
will be photographs of many of the cop
per properties, with their machinery, etc.
A proof of the map to be published shows
an almost continuous line of copper dis
coveries in California practically parallel
to the mother lode in the interior. In the
south the copper deposits are pictured as
scattering. The general effect of the map
upon the public will be to dissipate the
impression that the copper deposits of the
State are largely confined to the extreme
northern counties, where the largest
amount of development work has been
performed. The practical bearing of
the publication of the names of owners
of copper deposits and their postofflce ad
dresses is apparent. By this means in
quirers who reside in the East, who wish
to kriow about copper mines in this State,
will be placed at once in. touch with those
who may have mines to sell.
The forthcoming quicksilver bulletin
will be issued on the same general lineK,
and will embrace the same practical fea
tures. Science, as science simply, will not
figure much in the bulletins, but there
will be an abundance of practical inform
ation in them, such as persons concerned
in mining or desiring to engage in mining
will find available for their guidance.
Work in the Mines.
High bars on the banks of the South
Fork of the Feather River will be pros
pected by the dredger that has been op
erating at Spanish Ranch and Meadow
Valley in Plumas County under the
ownership of W. P. Hammon.
The Tonopah Bonanza says that $400,000
has been received from the Selby Smelt
ing Works by the Tonopah Company
since the shipments of ore began, some
months aeo.
The Sunbeam Mining Company at De

ing a new shaft.
Strikes are reported to have been made
on the east and south of Tonopah.
The Jackson (Amador County) Ledger
says that a body of quartz of fair mill
ing quality was recently struck at the
Peerless mine in the south drift.

weather for thirty years at lone, Amador
County, so reports the Pacific Coast
Miner, are now found to assay $14 per
ton.
The old Bull Run copper mine in- Ama
dor County, between Spring Valley and.
Buena Vista, will be reopened.
Copper properties near Georgetown, El
Dorado County, are being developed.
The Georgetown Gazette says that the

Kelsey, has been worked out, and the re
sults were so satisfactory to the stock
holders that the company will open up
more ground lower down.
A copper property near the old Gruss
mine in Plumas County will be opened
up by Minneapolis capitalists. Eastern
people have been given a one-half inter
est in the mine to develop it.
William B. Lake of Murphys, in the de
velopment of a gravel mine in the Cata
ract Channel in Calaveras County, will
drift under lUO feet of lava to a section of
Table Mountain Channel, which is also
on his property.
Boston parties, who have bought the
Jones mine at Railroad Flat, Calaveras
County, have thirty men at work sinking
a shaft. High grade ore, according to re
ports, has been taken from the 300-foot
level.
Several thousand dollars, so reports the
Pacific Coast Miner, will be spent in the
development work at the Gold Bug mine
in the Kinsley district, Mariposa County.
In Old Tuolumne.
The Mother Lode Magnet says that
George Deaney has bonded his White
Lead claim to New York parties, who
have begun to put in a deep race from,
the main flume of the Tuolumne County
Water Company.
A mill will soon be erected at the Bad
ger mine, five miles west from the Raw
hide, in Tuolumne County. Ten stamps
will be added at the Golden West mine on
the Comstock ranch. Twenty men are
working at the Mount Jefferson mine. The
mill at the Yon Tromp mine is completed
and there is enough ore on the dump to
keep it running several months. The Car
ters New Era says that a rich shoot of
ore has been discovered at the Carlotta
mine on the Pennsylvania vein.
Fifty men are reported by the Pacific
Coast miner to be employed by the Sis
kiyou Hydraulic Mining Company on
South Fork and Wild Cat Creek. The old
Portuguese mine near Baileys, Siskiyou
County, will be worked this winter by
Wood & Cudahy.
San Francisco parties are reported to
have taken a bond on copper prospects
near Gregory. Shasta County. According
to the Keswick Miner, the Black Spider
mine, southwest from Keswick, has been
purchased by Tillman Klaukens from R.
N. Bell. Seventy miners are working on
the Balaklala property. The Bully Hill
copper mine will have its capacity dou
bled next year.
The Ironclad mine at Rough and Ready,
Nevada County, is being opened up. It
has been idle some time. The bond on
the Providence mine has expired and the
property has reverted to its former own
ers. An impounding dam is being erected
at the Sargent mine, near Quaker Hill,
so that the property may be operated
this season as a hydraulic proposition.
The Coe mine, near Grass Valley, will
soon be worked again. The South Idaho
mine has been bonded by John E. Carter
of Grass Valley.
Copper ore is reported to have been dis
covered on Eagle Point to the west of
Surprise Valley, Modoc County.
The Lowry mine on Rock Creek, Sierra
County, has been unwatered. The Triple
Pocket mine in Sing Canyon has started
up its mill.
Investigating Quicksilver.
The field work of the California State
Mining Bureau is now principally con
fined to investigating the quicksilver in
dustry and saline deposits. Mr. Tweedy
is working at the former in San Luis
Obispo County. The collection of quick
silver data will be completed next month.
Nearly every part of the State where
quicksilver la known to exist has been
visited by the field assistants. Mineralo
gist Aubury will send an assistant this
week to study gold dredging where it is
being carried on in this State and a re
port will be published of the industry.
The Willows Reporter says that Mr.
Blumquitz. a farmer living in Stony Creek
Valley, near the Pearson grade, has
struck a gold bearing quartz ledge.
The Godbe iron mine in Lower Califor
nia has been sold to Eastern parties, ac
cording to the Los Angeles papers. The
mine is seven miles from the coast, the
nearest landing point being San Ysldro.
The Needles Eye reports that the price
received for the Planet group of mines at
Bill Williams Fork was $100,000.
Siskiyou's Minerals.
The Yreka Journal says that the erec
tion of a stamp mill on the Myers place
on Greenhorn Gulch has begun and the
mill will be ready to run very soon. De
La Mar is reported to have bonded the
copper deposit recently discovered on Joe
Creek by McVey & Co. The dredger at
Callahans, on the South Fork of the
Scott River, will be ready to operate
about December 10. Rich strikes are agwln
reported in the New River district, Trin
ity County.
The Commissioner of Industry of Mon
tana has completed his report of statis
tics of the coal industry of Montana for
the year 1900. The total output for the
year was 1,693,773 tons of bituminous coal,
nearly all of which was consumed in
Montana. The value of the output to the
mine owners was $2,369,054 on a capitali
zation of $5,790,000. There are twenty-one
coal mines operating in the State.

Bank Clearings.
Local bank clearings during the past week
were $28,180. against $25,305,915 during the
Heine week last year.
The Scarcity in Cordage.
According to Benton H. Kah!e of the Water
bury Rope Company, Plttsburg, there is at
present less than 1000 bales of raw material
for Manila rope in the country, whereas the
normal supply at this time of year is about
100,000 bales. Importations have fallen off
heavily, and the guerrilla Â¦warfare now going
on in the Philippines has taken the growers
away from their work and practically ruined
the crop. The shortage for the coming season
ie said to be about 500,000 bales, and the avail
able 6upp!y has been pretty well cornered.
Prices are going up rapidly over the entire
country, and there is little hope for anything
but further advances. Dealers in Pittsburg
expect to pay 20c a pound before the 6easoa
closes. .
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall reports from New York say:
"There was good acticity in dried fruits last
<rÂ«ek, but with steady cold weather trade un-
Soubtedly would have been heavier. Some
buying for the Thanksgiving holiday was In
evidehce, but the real rush of this trade is
yet to come. The increased strength of the
currant market was a feature of the spot mar
ket, the quotation for Amalias closing exceed
ingly firm at f'%c, with nothing offering, so
far as could be learned from the Guildhall,
due Wednesday, at less money. Figs also de
veloped a stronger I M and the better grades
were higher and In fair demand.
"New Persian dates declined %@-%o as a
result of the sale at auction on Wednesday of
something less than a quarter of the Perugia's
=argo. At the decline a good trade was re
ported. The date situation will attract close
â¢.ttentior. this week and the market is likely
to undergo further change.
â¢Demand for prunes was active In a small
way all the week and supplies were not heavy
t any time. The market was easier, how
ever, ar.d at the close 40-50s were offered at
i%c- Raisins steadily declined, 2-crown being
offered late in week at 6c and 8-crown at,s%c.
Supplies were more plentiful. Old seedless
Muscatels were quoted at 6>4c, but for a round
iot this figure probably would be shaded. New
Malaga raisins were In fair demand at quo
laUens. Valeneias were scarce and firmer on
tpot. Apples were quiet and practically un
jhanged.
â¢Nuts were active. Tarragonas were scarce
i.nd wanted. Grenobles were strong and ad
vanced' slightly. The first new crop Texas
pecans arrived and cold freely at 8%0 In a
'â¢mall way. Pecan meats were dull and easier.
lihelied almonds were in active demand."

EASTERN MARKETS.
Ne?v York Stock Market.
MEW YORK, Nov. 16.â There was continued
speculation for the rise to-day following yes
terday's recovery from Thursday's realizing
movement, but the advance was interrupted
by realising again here and there and the
buying was congested in a C*W stocks. There
Â¦was terse and concentrated buying of the
JieadlÃgs. accompanied by rumors that the
compÂ«my is soon to benefit â¢ by an increased
divideud en its holdings of New Jersey Central
clock. There was sympathetic strength in
coalers, includluc seme of- the eoft coal car
rier.'. American locomotive stocks .\-e In
notab's demand on reixirts of large orders from
all i>?.ris of the country. The transcontinental
railroad nocks moved Irregularly under realiz
ing from time to time and there was a *harp
e-tbacjj for the local tractions, Sugrar, Amalga
wÂ«ted Copper and People's Gas which". Un-
Fettled the late dealings and made the closing
Irrteulw. Much stuck was laid by bullish
traders on rumors that an offer of a large
block of Government bonds is pvhding. It
was also rumored that the Secretary of the
litasuryI itasury was about to raise the bid price for
Government bonds. No substantial basis could
he discovered lor either rumor. The gain in
I<. serves by the banks, in sinte of the
large gold exports, was a more material ground
for confidence over the money outlook. The
announcements before the close of an engage
ment of $oov>,ooo for export next Tuesday by a
Boston banking-house upset a hope that the
(sold export movement might be checked owing
to the easier tone of money and the rising in
sterling exchange at continental points. The
details of the plan of settlement of the dis
puted questions ot control in the Northwestern
situation had been eagerly anticipated lor
weeks past and this settlement has been the
stimulating cause of the upward course of
prices of stocks during all that period. Yet
when the announcement of the plan was made
this week prices of securities promptly turned
down and developed quite aoute weakness.
This does not necessarily mean that the pre
vious buying of stocks was on false premises.
Speculation naturally does not wait u'uon an
event, but anticipates it as early as possible.
The recent course of prices shows that the
terms of the settlement of the Northern Pa
cific quarrel were quite accurately anticipated
and in their essential details they had been
published. In consequence the actual an
nouncement attracted very few buyers of
stocks because the buying had been done al
ready. Such part of the buying as had been
done with the desire of selling again at an
advance made large offerings for tale on Thurs
day, with a resulting break in prices. Yet the
Northern Pacific settlement is viewed with
profound satisfaction throughout the financial
world, both here and abroad. It is regarded
as a definitive solution of problems that have
been a menace to the stability of values of
Northwestern securities for several years past.
60 far as the public Is yet informed only the
railways Immediately parties to the settlement
were concerned. Except as the general con
dition is bettered no j-oecial jirovisions have
been made known for the benefit of St. Paul
and Atchlson. As for the relative advantages
of the railways which were parties to the
quarrel the settlement accords to the^ Union
Pacific an equal control of the Burlington by
representation upon the directory, which was
Its original contention, and in addition a sub
stantial voice In the affairs of the Northern
Pacific and the Great Northern by its holdings
in the new Northern Security Company in
exchange for such holdings of Northern Pa
cific, which was not originally contended for
at all. The redemption at par of Northern
Pacific preferred Is not understood to yield a
substantial profit to the Union Pacific, as its
large holdings of Northern Pacific preferred
were acquired, according to common under
standing, at below par. The growing constric
tion of the money market has had very little
influence on speculation previous to the realiz
ing on the Northern Pacific settlement, but
emphasized the disposition to sell after the
reaction set in, as bankers were calling loans
and pales advanced. So far as the domestic
outlook Is concerned money conditions have
improved, the receipts of currency from the
interior tending to Increase and the payments
by the cub-treasury on account of the Gov
ernment bond redemptions and on account of
the gold deposited at Pacific Coast points more
than offsetting the requirements of the Gov
ernment surplus. But the outward movement
of gold to Europe has proved so large as to
awaken anxiety. It is now well understood
that the gold exports are an index of the un
suspected extent to which foreign capital was
borrowed in the pursuit of the projects which
stimulated the great speculation of last spring.
The Government returns of foreign trade,
showing a decreased balance of trade in our
favor for October of $28,530,045. explains why
the supply of commercial exchange has not
been sufficient to meet maturing requirements.
French capital has been largely loaned not
only here, but In London also, the amount
placed In London at one time running as high
as $400,000,000. according to the estimate of
the London Statist.
The market for railroad bonds has continued
broad and active this week at advancing prices
for the most part.
United ftates old 4g advanced % per cent
over the closing bid of last week.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â The statement of the
Associated Banks for the week ended to-day
shows: Loans, $582, 567,400; decrease." $4,427,600.
Deposits, $946,048,300; decrease. $4,<538.800. Cir
culation, $31,952,600; increase, $161,300. Legal
tenders, $70,035,400; Increase, $1,079,900. Specie,
$176,589,500; decrease, $749,700. Reserves, $246,
624,900; increase, $330,200. Reserve required,
$236,521,075; decrease $83,700. Surplus $10,103,
b23; increase, $1,413,000.
The Financier says: So far as those move
ments of money during the week which af
fected the bank statement could be traced the
banks gained $1,006,00u. It is noteworthy that
the gain by the banks through the receipts of
new gold and the net interior movement,
which together amounted to $4,642,600, more
than offset the gold exports of Europe, which
Â¦were $4,608,800. Moreover, the banks gained
through new gold and disbursements for bonds
$6,914,700, while the banks lost through the fis
cal operations of the sub-treasury and gold ex
ports $7,363,700, showing a net loss to the banks
of only $449,000. The bank statement showed
a net gain of $330,200 in cash, an amount some
what close to the above-noted estimate. The
return was affected, of course, by the various
items reported by the Seventh National Bank,
which resumed business this week. Loans were
reduced $4, 427,600, probably reflecting liquida
tion of exchange borrowings, and deposits were
decreased $4,334,800. In consequence of this
lessening of reserve requirements by $1,083,70-3
and the gain in cash the surplus reserve was
increased $1,413,900, now standing at $10,103,825.
The bank statement was made on rising aver
ages for cash, there having been paid on Fri
day $920,019 for unmatured bonds received at
the sub-treasury on that day. It Is expected
that bond purchases will be large, at least
during the early part of the current bank
week, for more than $2,000,000 will then be
offered to the Treasury.
The resulting improved conditions of the
banks at the beginning of the week will tend
largely to counteract any adverse effect which
may be produced by the withdrawals of gold
for export, even though puch shipments should
begin on Tuesday. The bankers who are largely
interested In the Northern Securities Com
pany's group of stocks were among the great
est lenders of money last week and they will
doubtless seek to prevent the maintenance of
high rates while they are engaged in market
ing their profits.
Condition of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â To-day's state
ment of the Treasury' shows: Available cash
balances, $172,514,832; gold, $109,466,829.
London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â The Commercial Ad

The stock market to-day was idle and uninter

Anglo-American ring traders. The prices were
firm on New York's supporting orders. Cana
dian Pacific was buoyant on the assertion that
New York Interests are buying for control but
London thinks that the price Is Justified by
the excellent earnlncs.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 16.â Wheat at the outset held
firm and traders expected a strong market re
sulting from higher cables and the continua
tion of the bullish activity in the past week.
December opened a shade to %@l4c higher at
72%@72%c. Northwestern and primary receipts,
however, were bearish and the customary Sat
urday liquidation started a decline. There was
some recovery on covering and higher Antwerp
cables but shortly afterward occurred the
break 'in corn and prices sagged again. De
cember closed weak. %c down, at 7;!i4@72%c.
Australian shipments for the week were 160,
00 bushels, against 467,000 last week.
Corn broke V2C early, owing to the disappoint
ing cables and influenced further by liberal
liquidations. Covering at the close price and
some commission house buying brought Decem
ber back to its opening price again, but ex
pectations of a freer movement of the new
crop next week, together with a general decline
In the outside markets, brought a heavy renewal
of profit taking and December sagged to 69%0,
closing weak, %Â®%c lower, at 60c.
Trade in oats was heavy all morning, though
with an easier tendency. December closed
rather weak, %c lower, at 39%@39%c.
Provisions were dull and easier. January
pork closed 10c lower, January lard 2%c down
and January ribs 2%c lower.

WHEATâ The foreign markets were all firm.

that Wheat is being fed to animals in Europe
as well as in the United States, which con
tributes to he enormous consumption there A
dispatch to Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. said that
with the largest world's shipments during the
past three months ever known, the stock in

Increase.
Chicago advanced at the opening, but fell
back. There was some increase in offerings of
December, and the crowd fought the upward
tendency, thus impeding the advance. There
was a larce trade. Scalpers realized for %c
results. Northwest stocks increased about
1,300,000 bushels during the week.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1901.
PLANS TO HELP
CITY'S CENTER
Large Improvements Are
Proposed for the
Sharon Lands.
Oon tracts for Buildings Prove
Interest in Local
Realty.
The most significant indication of the
week in connection with realty in the
center of the business district of. San
Francisco is the announced intention of
the Sharon Estate Company to encourage
the building up of New Montgomery
street in such style as will make the vi
cinity of the Palace Hotel very attrac
tive. A meeting of the Sharon Estate
Company was held last week, and advice
on the interesting topic of the improve
ment of the company's extensive hold
ings, which run from Market street to
Howard, was given by Herbert E. Law
and others. Mr. Law had a definite idea
of making improvements on a scale that
would insure uniformity in that nelgh
borhool. His remarKs were listened to
with much interest. Some of those con
cerned have since expressed approval of
his general plan.
The subject of a theater in that neigh
borhood, to stand upon land of the Sha
ron Estate Company, is a live one. After
due deliberation, in which the manager of
the Palace Hotel took part, it was de
cided that there was no room in the Pal
ace Hotel for a theater. All the accom
modations In the hotel are in constant
demand, and the growth of the city in
sures that the demand will never be less.
There has been considerable discussion
concerning the location of the theater,
which is favored by the Sharon Estate
Company.
It is a matter of history that Ralston
thought that New Montgomery street
wouid be a financial or banking location,
and this opinion had much to do with the
purchase of the property that is now held
by the Sharon Estate Company. The the
ater project is based to some extent upon
the idea that it is desirable to make the
vicinity of the Palace Hotel frequented
and light by night as well as by day.
Tnat will tend to keep the hotel popular,
whatever changes of the business center
may take place.
Old Mansion Is Sold.
The old Yon Schroeder mansion, corner
of Rincon place and Harrison street, has
been sold to F. Korbel, who is interested
in planing mills and other enterprises.
The price paid was $13,000. Possession
will be given in December. The property
fronts 50 feet on Harrison street, with a
depth of 135 feet on Rincon place. The
- ouse was built in the early fifties and
was famous as tne first residence in San
Francisco to be frescoed.
For a time it was the finest dwelling in
the city. Many of the appointments were
brought from the East. Its spacious
rooms were the scene of social gather
ings for many years. In later years soc
ety moved off toward the hills of the
city, and the neighborhood of the Yon
Schroeder mansion has been built up
largely with comparatively small houses.
For some years the old house has been
occupied by Mrs. Frank Smith.

Growth of Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles Real Estate News
gives the following account of the build
ing operations in Los Angeles during the
month of October:
The October report of Building Superintendent
Krause chows that there were issued during
the month 355 permits, representing a valua
tion of $626,254 50. This exceeds any previous
month since July. 1895. when the permits ag
gregate In value $656,179.
For October, 19C0, there were Issued 169 per
mit* for a building valuation of $391,917, and for
the same month in 1899 there were Issued 190
permits with a valuation of $200,400.
Looking back and comparing the months for
an interval of seven years, the building opera
tions for one month rarely equaled $300,000 in
value. The character of buildings erected last
month is far in advance of those erected In
any like period. Comparing also the past ten
FRENCH BARK LA TOUR D'AUVERGNE,
LONG OVERDUE, MAKES PORT SAFELY
Is QuGted at 40 Per Cent and Hei Cwrers Fear for Her Safety.
Long Voyage Is the Result of a Succession of Gales Off the
Hornâ China Arrives From Ports of the Flowery Kingdom
THE FRENCH BARK LA TOUR D'AUVERGNE, WHICH ARRIVED FROM SWANSEA YESTERDAY AND ON
WHICH 40 PER CENT REINSURANCE WAS PAID. IT TOOK HER SIXTY DAYS TO ROUND THE HORN
AND THAT CAUSED HER LONG VOYAGE.
OCEAN steamships and transports
came and went yesterday while
one overdue, on which 40 per cent
re-insurance was paidj made port.
The Hancock was got off the
beach in the Inland Sea and the Warren
and Sheridan are again in service.
The arrival that caused most excitement
in shipping circles was that of the French
bark La Tour d'Auvergne from Swansea.
She left Wales 184 days ago in company
with a large fleet of coal-laden vessels.
Some of them got into trouble, at the start
and others arrived with their cargoes
heated. The underwriters early began to
fear for the La Tour d'Auverene and
more than a month ago 10 per cent was
paid on her chances. Gradually the rate
advanced until Saturday morning, when
45 per cent could have been procured on
her chances. Then she was reported by
the Merchants' Exchange outlook and the
gamblers registered a kick because they
hau not taken some of the reinsurance.
Captain Frioux accounts for his long
passage by the fact that he was more
than sixty days getting from 50 in the
Atlantic to 50 in the Pacific. Gale after
gale came up and typical Cape Horn
weather delayed the vessel. Finally she
got into a fair working: breeze and from
the equator made a fair run to San Fran
cisco.
Arrival of the China.
The Pacific Mail Company's China ar
rived on time yesterday. She was looked
for Friday, but storms on the coast of
Japan and heavy head seas between Hon
olulu and San Francisco delayed her. She

he expected and he decided not to wait
even a day in San Francisco.

SAVES BABIES
FROM FLAMES
Officer Naylor Risks His
Life to Rescue Little
Ones.
Dramatic Episode at EarÂ»y
Morning Fire Near North
, Bsach,
A fire that destroyed property valued at
$20,000 started shortly alter 4 o'clock yes
terday morning in L. G. Sresovich's shred
ded cocoanut factory on the northeast
corner of Sansome and Vallejo streets.
The blaze spread with such rapidity that
several families living in the rear of the
burning structures were hemmed in and
nairowly escaped death. Policeman Tom
Naylor rescued two babies who had been
left in one of the blazing structures. The
policeman narrowly escaped death him
self by falling into an unguarded well. Ha
was dragged from his perilous position by
Officers Oruenwald and Fennell. A mo
ment after he had been hoisted to thÂ»
surface by means of a rope, one side of
the burning wall fell into the yard and
flames enveloped the spot where the offi
cers had been working to save Naylor
tiom death.
The only entrance to the large tenement
house in which so many liven were endan
gered was through a small alley running
alongside Qf the Sresovich building. The
fire started near the furnaces and in a
few minutes the entire factory was a
mass of flames. Many of the oecupant9
of the tenement escaped in their night
clothes, the policemen assisting them. All
tlie while the flames swept into the alley
Â¦way and at one time escape for two ehil
dien who had been left in a flat occupied
by D. Perreni, seemed impossible. Officer
Naylor then accomplished his heroic deed.
After the Doliceman had given the chii
dien to their parents on the street, he
rushed back into the yard to see if more
reeded Ms assistance, and stumbled into
the well.
Sergeant Donovan and a squad of offi
cers did good work in rescuing forty
horses from a stable belonging to A. Cuneo
that was also burned. The Italians in
charge of the place became bewildered
and would have allowed the animals to
perish had it not been for the timelj ar
rival of the police.

The Maccabee Social Club, composed of
