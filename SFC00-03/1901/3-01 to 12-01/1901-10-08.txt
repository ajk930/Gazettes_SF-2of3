Abdurrahman Khan was the eldest son
of Afzul Khan, and nephew of the \u25a0 late
Ameer, Shere AH. He was a\ Barakzai
and v was born about 1830. During the civil
war of 1864 he played a leading .part on
the side of his father against' his uncle,
and. the great .victories of Shaikhabad-and
Khelat-i-Ghilzai were mainly due to \ his
generalship. In 1868 he suffered .'defeat
at the hands of his cousin, a son of Shere
AH,, and fled from â¢- the 'i. country
into Russian I territory. m He , remain
ed in Turkestan until" 1879, when
he made his way to the Cabul
frontier and a year later the . British
Indian Government acknowledged. him, as
Ameer of Afghanistan. From the British
Government he received a subsidy of
Â£160,000 a year, with large gifts of artil
lery, rifles and ammunition, to be used in
improving his miltary force. An attempt
was made 'by a Sepoy to assassinate him
December 26, 1888, but he escaped the bul
let intended for. him. His sympathies .were
British rather than Russian, and consid
erable anxiety was felt in England in
1894, when he suffered from severe illness.
He was made a G. C. S. I. and was invited
by Queen Victoria to visit England, but,
being unable to go himself, he sent his
son, who received a warm* welcome. He
was suspected of conniving at the rising
of the tribes along the Indo-Afghan fron
tier In 1897, but showed his friendship to
the British Government by refusing to
receive a "deputation sent to enlist his aid
against the, English.' â¢ - .
Life of the Late Ameer.
| The editorials in the morning papers
express. confidence that, with a strong
Viceroy and a strong Government at
home, any possible complications follotv
ing the death of the Ameer will be firmly
and prudently met.
F There is, however, an underlying cur
rent- of uneasiness discernible as to'
whether Russia will seize the opportunity
.to push her frontier forward. The Brit
ish troops- in India, owing to the â¢ South
African war, are now below their. normal
strength. It will be impossible, to take
any more for South Africa, and the news
will still, further encourage the Boers to
prolong their resistance.

as a â¢wise and temperate ruler, favorable
to Great Britain, but less masterful than
his father, and for this reason less likely
to be strong enough to govern the fierce,
unruly tribes or to resist the attempts of
his brothers to seize power.

postpone his intended tour of Burmah un

\V.. WASHINGTON. Oct. 7.â Bulgaria, as
well as the Macedonian committee, is
charged with participation in the plot
which culminated in the abduction of
Miss Stone, the American missiona f .
The charge is of the most serious- -har
acter, involving as it does the posJ"jility
cf a breach in the friendly relations which
have hitherto existed between the Sofia
Government and- the United States. _A
careful investigation has not absolutely
established Bulgarian complicity, but a
suspicion exists at the State Department-
It is based upon official dispatches, and is
sufficiently strong to have been considered
by the authorities in determining the pol
icy pursued. This is the most important
and most surprising development of the
abduction of Hiss Stone.
That the Government of Bulgaria
Ehould have been placed in a position
where it could even be suspected of the
crime is a mystery to the Washington of
ficials. Bulgaria has always been the
hotbed of anti-Turkish plots, and It may
be that her officials desiring to involve
Turkey In further trouble with the United
States countenanced the movement for
the capture of the American missionary.
Cause of the Suspicion.
The suspicion entertained by American
officials in Bulgaria and Turkey may
have arisen from the failure of the Bul
garian Government to rescue Miss Stone.
Officials here admit that Bulgaria is act
ing under a. dfflculty, in view of the prob
ability that the use of force will result In
the death of the captive. Here is where
the international complications come in.
It is probable the suspicion which has ex
isted as to Bulgaria's connection with the
abduction of Hiss Stone caused the United
States to appeal to Russia to use its good
offices with the Balkan state to spare no
effort to effect the liberation of the
American lady. Bulgaria's situation in
Europe Is such that it is impossible for
the United States to reach her. She has
no sea coast. Her water frontage is on
the Black Sea, An American squadron
lies at Genoa, Italy, but on account of
Turkieh regulations warships cannot pass
through the Dardanelles. Thus entrance
into the Black Sea is closed. All that the
United States can consequently do 'is to
express to Bulgaria. In case* the suspicion
now entertained becomes absolutely con
firmed, its condemnation of the course

Schley's conduct on that occasion was
such as that of a commander In chief
should have been. He also explained at
some length his correspondence with Ad

engagement was In progress. He said he
had no controversy with the commodore,
-but- he repeated- that the" commodore had
said "Damn the Texas" when . told that
that vessel was In danger.
Captain Folgtr said that the bombard
ment of the Cristobal Colon May 31 had
been eminently successful In developing
the . strength of the Spanish shore bat

weak. He also said that if the Spanish
vessels had attempted to escape a*t night

The day's proceedings began with the
recall of Lieutenant Doyle and Command

had been excused LUutenant Commander
Hodgson, navigator of the Brooklyn dur

and spoke of the importance . of \u25a0 early
training of the child. , He said:
All training in th'e Sunday school leads to
the altar railâ in' confirmation and holy com
munion. The uniform purpose of the Sunday
school is . to go onward. We sing "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," and bo these children are
to go on to confirmation and holy communion.
The Journey is always toward the altar rail.

I don't want to say very much about the
merits of this resolution. It. has been <3:s

ir.atter that has t/wn overlookedâ that is, the
practical effect of the adoption of this amend
ment to the constitution in the direction of
ululating the liberty of clergymen to act with
the panction of their Bishcp.
It is a proposal to regulate the liberty which
clrrady exists and which is taken advantage
"f in different ways and by different persons.
It la a provision that is connected with the
constitutional regulation in the use of the
prayer Look. What I want to specifically call
the attention of the convention to is the ef
icrx. of a negative vote on this question. We
are face to face in a practical way, gentle
men, â¢with a question which has been before
this church for fifty years. There is only one
thing for us to do and that is to vote in favor
cf it. "We are face to face with the necessity
of votinsr to show our attitude toward the

Several amendments to the constitution
\u25a0were proposed, and they all evoked con
siderable discussion. The following
amendment in relation to charters was
the first to be adopted: \
Article II. section 2. (a) Chapters thus formed
shall send to the secretary of the council their
names, locations, dates of organization, list of
officers and chapter members, and certification
that the constitution has been adooted. to
gether with a registration fee of 50 cents per
capita of the charter members. In return the
, chapter shall be granted a charter and num
ber be enrolled among the chapters of the
order and each member shall receive a copy
of the constitution and form of admission,
(b) The same amount shall also be sent to the
secretary of the council on or before the date
of admission for each* new " member enrolled
after the charter has been granted. In return
the new member shall receive a copy of the
constitution and form of admission.
. The increase : in the membership of the
order has been so great that the free dis
tribution- of the ! Royal Cross, the official
organ of the order, caused a big loss. It
was found necessary to amend section 3
of article 2 so that a subscription, fee of
twenty-five cents a year can be charged.
It was determined hereafter to hold tri
ennial conventions. Article 5 was added
to the constitution.' It reads as follows:
Section 1. The order shall have a convention,
to be held triennially. , i. â¢
, There was no- definite settlement as to
the place of holding; the next convention.
Sec. 2. Said convention shall be composed of
one delegate from each chapter and one dele
gate from each diocese. â¢ which delegate shall
be empowered to j voice all chapters in her
diocese which are not otherwise represented.
last year in South Africa, where a large body
consisting of about 10,000 persons, called the
Ethiopian church, with a Hishop ordained by
the Methodist Episcopal church, all of them
came to the Church of England. Our Bishop
and church in South Africa not having any
constitution were able to make provision for
admiuin,i them according to what they
thought proper into the church.
In our church we are obliged to work ac
pency might at any time arise In this church,
and therefore I think that it is most desirable
that an amendment of this kind should stand
in our constitution. If I had a vote I should
certainly vote fcr It.
Rev. Dr. Williams of Nebraska, was
next recognized by the chair, and said:
Whatever we do In this house or leave un
done. I hope that It will be done with perfect
candor. I do not think we ought to come in
here 4o pass any measure that is under the
Flightest taint of false pretense. The Bishops,
clergy and laity of Minnesota have chosen to
violate the distinct law of this church. I do
not r.ny they are not Justified from the neces-
Fity cf the case. I am not saying that there
is anything wronf in itself in this: but they
have violated the law, and the action of their
advocate does not cure that lawlessness. They
have taken Swedish congregations, rightly or
wrongly, into full communion with the church.
They have allowed a liturgy different from
that whl<*h this church has prescribed. Under
the same ruling and the same course of ac
tion we could have the Roman mass legalized.
There is nothing In the Roman mass of itself,
with the exception of one or two prayers,
which is in conflict with the usages of this
church. This is a very different proposition.
They are to-day violating the new consti
tution of this church by having congregations
in full communion with this church In which
the prayer book is not in use. Another objec
tion I have to this proposition is that it is
legislation in advance of any necessity. There
are no congregations in this land flying like
doves to their windows to {ret into the Prot
estant Episcopal church.
The Swedes of the country who are Inclined
to our church have been angered by the work
in Minnesota and alienated from the church
in greater numbers than the work in Minne
sota could possibly offset.
There is nothing in the Swedish work that
to-day can recommend any change in our con
stitution, customs or laws. Let these people
come to ,us upon right principles and our peo
ple will not object. Let them come upon false
principles and you do not win the Swedish
population of this country.
Speaks for the Negro.
Mr. Randall of Maryland took the plat
form at this juncture and said he would
not venture at that late hour to trespass

Mr. George C. Thomasâ Dear Mr. Thomas: "When Queen Victoria died you most kindly sent me a. tele

country, at Westminster Abbey, at St. Paul's, everywhere.
I send you. some lines of mine, "In Memorlam," which I wrote and which appeared in last night's Westminster

Bishop Griswold is reported to have said.
"If the Protestant Episcopal church in the
United States ever dies it will die of dignity."
(Laughter.) But it !s not necessary for the
well-born to assert dimity. They carry it in
their look and in their gait. And this church
to which you and I belong Is well-born; well
born to a large heritage of historical tradi
tions; well-born to a boundless wealth of
precious opportunity. 'I say build large, not
for the sake of any little group of people that
may be found here or there, but for the sake
of setting this church right with the Chris
j tian public of this land. â¢
\u25a0 AVe have made in this convention our act of
uniformityâ for that Is what this article 10 of
the new constitution Isâ more ironbound than
iÂ» ever was before. Remembering the history
of the British act of uniformity, can be go
home to our constituency and say that ln re
ply to any. appeal to open the door ever so l.t
\u25a0 tie to the separated brethren of other com
munions we refused? I say open the door.
Thl3 is not a question of high church or low
church, or what is vaguely called broad
church. It is a question of that far better
thing, comprehensive churchmanshio. the
churchmanship of character, of sympathy, of
the open door, as the open door. Is denned, in
the tenth chaster of the Gospel according to
ThaÂ°t is what we want. I say build large. I
praise the foresight of the rntellteence which
here on this western coast is building and en
dowing two enormous universities. People say.
what does California need of two universities?
Look across the Paclflc. California, whether
she realizes it or not, is building for the Ori

schools of learning who can foresee how many
of the leading minds of the great empires of
Japan and China will In the future be trained

One Fold, One Shepherd
Tears ago when I was a young man ln orders
in the only charge I ever had before my pres
ent one I caused to be inscribed over the chan
cel arch of the little wooden church in which
it was my privilege to minister the words; also
from that chapter of the Gospel of the Apostle
of Love to which I have referred, "There shaU
be one fold and ons shepherd." One winter's
night the church was burned.
In the morning I went out to take account of
what was left. The roof had fallen in, the
tower was toppling, the windows were destroy
ed the chancel was gone, but there stood the
arch, and on it the inscription "There shall
be one fold and one shepherd." Christian unity
a* dead issue! The quadrilateral ancient his
tory! Never believe It. They were never so
much alive as now.
Let us do justice on the right hand and on
the left. I credit the evangelicals on this floor
with too much good sense to be Intimidated
In the least degree by the suggestions that
have been thrown out with regard to the im
portation of the Roman mass. There are
many things In the Roman system much more
objectionable than the mass. When I took
up the evening papers Saturday I found In all
of them a notice that we were to have the
mass in the Protestant Episcopal church on
the next day. it does not seem to me that
we are ln very much danger from importation.
I say build large; not only because we owe
a debt to the founders of this republic, but
also because we owe a debt to that grand
communion which has been transplanted to our
soil the Roman Catholic church. Nothing
will' persuade me that, ln the province of God, â¢
that great ecclesiastical immigration has taken
place without a purpose. I believe there is a
plan in it. I believe that they are to teach
the American people many things they need
to learn. I also believe, and we see the
tokens of it all around us, that mighty
changes are in store for Latin Christianity on
the continent of North America; that Latin
Christianity will become so leavened with the
principles which brought about the English
reformation that the time will yet come when
the Papal yoke will be thrown off and we shall
have a body of Christians here, catholic, but
not Papal.
And shall we not be prepared to meet them
on the right as we are prepared to meet the
children of the Puritans on the left?. I say
yes. I believe that both these, great repre
sentative elements ln American Christianity
have their part to play in the Church of the
Reconciliation.
Gentlemen of the convention, if what I have
said has weighed with you for anything I
hope that you will lend your influence and
your sympathy and your prayers to the
success of this measure, and in doing so win
the beatitudes of those who ln the beautiful
language of the ordinance do what in them
lies to maintain und to set forth quietness,
peace and love among all Christian people.
A vote was taken on the much debated
amendment and it was carried by the fol
lowing:
Clericalâ Ayes, '30; noes. 16; divided. IX
Layâ Ayes, 35; Noes, 11; divided, 5.
An adjournment was taken until this
morning at 10 o'clock.
Let us be ready for large things. We have
been taunted with the fact that we cannot
point to large numbers of communities or con
gregations that are desirous of availing them
selves cf this permission, and we have been
toW that we are imperiling the dignity of the
church by taking any such steps, and we are
reminded that when the quadrilateral was put
forth it was trampled on. and therefore we
must not run the risk of compromising our
dignity.
means and under no circumstances to be con
nected either by belt or cable with the throb
bing, vibrant, religious forces throughout the
landâ it would wreck the pretty little mode!.
I am not speaking contemptuously of that view.
There is something to be said for it; but 1
urge this, that whatever -else it 13, It is not
a catholic view. ; -
Again, there are those who actually believe
that, while admittlns the force cf what has
been said ln regard to the importance 01
church unity as such, the true policy of this
church is a masterly inactivity; that what we
have to do with our strength is to sit still.
But do those gentlemen really think that the
time iÂ«i coming when the mandarins of the
great denominations will ask the privilege of
permitting them to kow-tow in the Protestant
Episcopal church? Do they really believe that
the day is coming when those mandarins will
knock at the door of the House of Bishops
and ask the privilege of knocking their fore
heads on Us marble floor? Any one who holds
that oDlnion Is entitled to it. I hold the ex
pectation to be an over-sanguine one. (Laugh
ter.)

PRELATES PASS
'UPON AMENDMENTS
Chairman Lindsay here announced that
the hour for adjournment had arrived
and informed the house that the deputa
tion of churchmen from Canada, would
be received this morning-. The house
then took a reces3 until 3 n. m.
The necessity of this resolution has not been
shown. Its harmfulness is obvious. This
amendment proceeds from a group of the fol
lowing of Rome. Where do we get the idea
of this amendment. It comes from a party of
the Roman church that lias been in existence
all through the centuries and seems to have
culminated around the councils of Constance.
Its influence has been most harmful. It has
brought no strength to the Roman church
and It will bring none of a permanent char
acter to us.
I submit that in the face of that fact a
measure such a3 is here proposed would pro
mote not order and unity, but confusion. I
believe that the consequence of passing this
amendment would be fraught with mischief
to the peace, the quiet and the order of this
church. I earnestly hope that this amendment
will not prevail.
Rev. IV A. de Rosset of Springfield op
posed the amendment. In part he said:
Were I convinced of the wisdom of this
measure I should have some misgivings be
cause there Is such an ambiguity in its mean
ing that it ouÂ«rht not to go Into an instrument
like the constitution. It has evidently been
framed without that due consideration which
ought to be given to an article of permanent
importance in the constitution.
This is ostensibly a measure in the Interest of
Christian unity. That is what we all want.
But In a discussion like this we cannot con
ceal from ourselves and it ought not be con
cealed in debate that we are not at one among
ourselves. There .are serious . divisons among
us. Â«
Rev. Dr. Flske of Rhode Island did not
desire to see the amendment prevail, and
said:
late, but even the Ecumenical Council Itself
cannot give the Bishop a power that ha did
not derive from above when he was consecrated
to the apostolic ministry. In this resolution
there Is no restriction^ but it is simply an
indiscriminate giving of power which this
council has no right or power to give.
Another thing about this resolution is that
it is vicious in that it does not restrict in
certain ways of a most vital character. There
is no requirement which furnishes any guard
as to the character of the worship of the con
gregations or that the minister of such congre
gations should have the authority of thi3
church.
Opposed to Amendment
and the public to hear him.
Bishop Potter of New York will also
speak to-night. More than usual Interest
centers around Bishop Potter at the pres
ent time, as it is generally thought that
if the confentlon decides to change the
constitution and in future elect a pre
siding Bishop, he will be the choice of
the houses of Bishops and Deputies.
The Bishop of Kyoto will also be one off
the speakers and his wide experience in
foreign mission fields will give him an op
portunity of presenting forceful reasons
for support of the Board of Missions of
the Episcopal Church.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, TUESDAY, 'OGTOBEB 8, 1901.
RfT. I>r. Fuller was next recognized
and gave an interesting and succinct
history of the amendment. He told of the
Lambeth, platform which was adopted by
the House of Deputies in 18S6. He said
he would be willing to vote for a resolu
tion that would refer Dr. Huntingdon's
amendment -to a joint committee of both
houses to report back to the convention
three years from now. He said the House
of Deputies ha-1 put in six years in
weighing the question, and he thought
it was wonderful that the house at this
day was,, Â©n Dr. Huntington's side. He
AsRs for a Delay.
This resolution, adopted during these three
conventions, has a history which has been fully
discussed and presented by the learned deputy
from Newark, so I believe it is fully under
stood. In Its principle as in its subject matter
it it the very best of its kind that was ever
presented to this church. Its principle was
fully understood, and while I recognize to the
fullest extent the proposition of the reverend
deputy from Alabama, that each convention
determined for itself and on its own responsi
bility the questions that are presented for its
decisions. I do believe that it is not asking
too much of this convention to consider that
It Is possible that the convention of 1898. made
up of loyal, earnest gentlemen, may not have
been entirely indifferent to the interests of the
church nor entirely ignorant of what was good
for its welfare, when they voted for the prin
ciple of this resolution. The only diocese that
voted agalnet the principle of the resolution
was the diocese of Newark. When we voted
on this Eubject we knew what we were doing.
tVe may have erred and you may so decide by
yftur vote, hut we showed loyalty to this
church, intelligence and unanimity, which has
not been paralleled in its history.
The reverend gentleman referred \u25a0 to
arose and indignantly denied that he
used the word scorn or spoke scornfully.
Mr. Stetson created some mirth by with
drawing "the scorn." Continuing he
he said:
F. L.. Stetson of Xewark followed and
delivered a strong argument in favor of
the adoption of the amendment. In part
he said:
It has been my privilege to vote in favor of
this resolution or Its equi\-alent in 1S92, 1S93
and 1898. And I am not able to emulate the
example of the reverend deputy from Dallas
either to vote or to speak with scorn upon
this amendment or claim it will be destructive
of the church.
The president read the names of the
committee that will, with a like repre
sentation from the House of Bishops, act
2s a deputation to the synod that meets
in Ottawa. Canada, next year. The com
mittee is composed of the following mem
bers: Rev. Dr. Parks, New York; Rev.
Dr. Lawrence. Massachusetts; Mr. Miller,
Michigan, and Mr. Mynderse of Long Is
land.
Debate Grows Warmer.
I refer to the colored people. I come from a
Etate â Maryland, almost and sometimes classed
as a. Southern State, in which there is a col
ored people to which the church has been hold- v
ing out its arms and so far, Mr. President,
almost in vain, and I do sincerely believe the
passage of this amendment will result in bring
ing a large number of that population to the
bosom of our beloved church. We find that
we are not able to reach the illiterate because
they cannot follow the forms of the service;
because of their inability to read and lack of
Intelligence. We want such a form that thiÂ»
amendment promises.
not for the fact that he was interested in
one class of people who are in great need
of the liberty which the amendment af
forded. Continuing he said:

that, whereas, the United States possesses a

Let me say in advance, by way of allaying
anxiety. If possible, and removing misappre
hension, that in case this amendment be adopt
ed by both houses it is my intention at the
earliest possible moment to bring in a canon
which shall embody all of the provisions con
tained in the amendment superseded bv Dr.
Faude's resolution. I cannot, of course guar
antee that that canon shall be passed- that
s for you to say. But I can pledge myself,
ir pledge be needed, to bring ln a canon which
shall embody all those features, for I am as
much convinced to-day as I was three years
ago that they are necessary features.
I shall not try to produce a substitute, be
cause I see the truth of what my colleague in
the law deDutatlon from New York has 30
powerfully set forth, that constitutions are for
the enumeration and not for the detail of the
account of rights and duties. Moreover, speak

is a lawyer of either law, as well as historian

constitution is not the place for sanctions- a
canon is the place for sanctions.
And here I want to dwell upon a point which
has been already touched upon, but not per
haps properly emphasized; that the reason why
we want this thing in the constitution is that
a canon may become possible. Everybody
knows that the parallel is perfect, or almost
perfect, between the constitution of the UnltÂ°d

no right to pass a canon like that pro
posed, infringing upon the rights of the
episcopacy. He protested further that
they had no right to Inject even into the
organic law of the church "anything
which would detract from that divine
right given -our most holy fathers, the
episcopacy of this church."
Dr. Huotington's Speecb
Rev. Dr. Huntington was then invited
to close the debate. In part he said:
DEPUTIES AMEND
THE CONSTITUTION
jHBfc. NE of the central figures in the
/ \\ *^Â» Episcopal Church Convention
i \\ is Rev. Dr. William Reed
Hk \\ J Huntington, rector of Grace
Church. New York City, who
delivered a brilliant speech yes
terday afternoon In the House
of Deputies.
Dr. Huntington fathered the amendment
to the constitution of the church which
caused the debate on Saturday and yes
terday. After ten years of faithful work
he has finally put through the House of
Deputies an amendment so that the
Bishops of the Episcopal church may, if
the HouFe of Bishops also passes the
measure, give spiritual oversight to cer
tain congregations not in union with the
denomination and whose forms of wor
ship are not those of the American
\u2666 church.
Rev. Dr. Hunting-ton was born in
Lowell, Mass, Setember 20, 183S, and
graduated from Harvard in 1859. He is a
doctor of divinity of Columbia, Princeton
and Harvard universities. He is doctor
of civil law of the University of the South

niece of Wendell Phillips.
He wan ordained deacon in 1861, priest

The second false Impression is that if it had
been so considered that does not relieve this
house from the same careful consideration Â«f
the subject. I think that in acting for the

from their consecration. The Bishora with

the most learned Protestants, that sort of an
illustration was urged in the House of Deputies
three years ago by one of Its most learned and
respectable members, namely that the
Protestant Episcopal church Is a little work

under a glass case, provided with Its own little
boiler and Its own little dynamo, for the ad
miration of those who look at - It, by no
point of view, but also from the point of view
of the patriotic American citizen.

bring out by a few illustrations the truth
of what I have said, and if I shall persuade
you that any legislation that- does ever so lit

brethren of other communions when they read
itâ if I can show you the connection between
the question of Christian unity and those four
other questions that I have mentioned, and
can demonstrate by illustration the superiority
of the one over the four I shall have carried
my point.
It is superior to them all because they are
In a measure independent . of one another;
whereas the question of the unification and
correlation of the 'religious forces of the repub
lic touches upon every one of them infinitely,
vitally.
The question of the family. There is on our
table. at the present moment a memorial from
the diocese of New York asking us to take
steps to see whether we cannot procure united
action on the part of the religious bodies of
this country to bring about uniformity In the
legislation relative to- marriage and divorce.
Could there be a more sensible suggestion? '
Do we not all know ; that it is a truly vital
one. Are we not all \u25a0 perfectly sure, as. sure
as we are sitting here, that nothing will come
of It? Why? 1 Because of . our unhappy divi
sions. Did you notice that the Bishop of Mis
souri, In opening the missionary â¢ meeting the
other day, chose that prayer which refers to
our unhappy division as the one petition which
ought to ' lie at the- threshold of any consid
eration of missionary work? He did that with
a purpose, I- am â¢ sure.
Suppression of Anarchy
Next, the question of education. The Jour
nalists and the publicists of this country are
turning their attention to-day almost exclu
sively to the .consideration of the question of
anarchy. How may we suppress anarchy?
Can we do it by more restrictive immigration
laws? Can we do It by heavier penalties for

moment to -believe that if that utterance had
come not from thÂ» representative of a mere
fraction of the Christian population of the
city, but from its whole Christian population,
New York would^ have been shaken to its
center?
Why is not that simple teaching instilled Into
the tender minds of the children of our land?

Was It an Earthquake?
. Yesterday's contests between thÂ» Bene
dicts and the Angrels turned out to be one
of the greatest of the season. It was a
twelve-round battle royal,- an exhibition
of pretty hitting, steady box work, sharp,
snappy fielding and just errors enough to
make . the - plays close. It- was voted by
the slim crowd In attendance to be one of
the most remarkable games of the sea
son, the only thing lacking being the
spectators. Dr. Moskiman and Jones were
In the points" for their respective teams,
Altrock taking Jones' place in the tenth.
1 -th pitchers were touched lip rather
lively at times, but the doctor displayed
his old-time coolness In tight places and
once niore steeied the Unfortunate crip
ples to, a well earned victory.
Oakland had everything its own way
until the Looloos made their Baltimore
finish In the ninth. In the Initial round
Strieb's triple, together with singles by
Mohler and Eagan and Householder's er
ror, netted two runs for the Dudes. Again
in the sixth the bell rang for the com
muters, the.' result of hits by Strieb and
Babbitt and an error by Jones. Little
Mohler did another great stunt in the
seventh and earned a round of applause
by placing tho sphere on the other side
ot the center field fence.
The score stood ; four to one when the
Angels made their last stand in the ninth.
Kllim got hit by a pitched ball, but soon
after was caught trying to make third
on Reltz's slntjle. . Reilly was an easy
out, and the spectators were preparing to
make their exit when old "Hank" Spies
tore off a two-bagger, scoring Reitz. Hall
was put in to bat in Jones' stead and he
responded .with another drive, enabling
Spies to cross the rubber. Dougherty was
there with the goods when his turn came,
and he brought Hall home, tying the
score, Hall previously going to third on
a hit by Hemphlll. Householder ended
the good work by fouling out to Hanson..
The game went merrily on for three ex
tra Innings, neither team being able to
score, though both came dangerously near
doing so. Hanson opened the twelfth with
a safe drive and took the middle station
on Mohler's sacrifice. Old Peter struck
out, and Striab sent a hot one toward
Kihm. The big first baseman captured
the ball, but in doing so fell down and
dropped it. He was up In a twinkling
and returned the sphere to Spies in light
ning order in an effort to head off Han
son, who was tearing home. It was a
close call, but Levy called the runner
safe, and all was over but the shouting.
- Schmidt played a great game In the left
garden, pulling down several that looked
safe. In the eighth Kihm robbed Mos
kiman of a clean double by a great fun
ning catch. Altrock took the slab In the
tenth and Immediately fanned out ' Loh

The Mail Company's steamship City of
Sydney will not take back her union
crew. During the strike a Central Ameri

These men are thoroughly incompetent,
but as they mean a great saving to the
company they will be retained on the pay
roll.
The British bark Haddon Hall, now In
port, has been sold to J. R. Ellerman.
There were ten ships, aggregating 38,069
tons burden, in the Hall line, Robert
Alexander & Co. of Liverpool, and all of
these were sold with the Haddon Hall.
The latter ship will be turned over to her
new owner when she reaches England.
T. M. Harrington, a boy, was caught in
an elevator on the front yesterday, while
James Burnham, another boy, was run
over by an express wagon. Neither of
them was seriously injured. They were
attended to at the Harbor Hospital.
The German ship Windsbraut. out 126

"Water Front Notes.
Saturday last Captain McAllman of the
bark Martha Davis gave Mate Grinlay $55
with which to pay the crew an advance.
The mate put the money in a drawer in
his cabin and then locked the door. An
bour later he went to get the money and
found the door locked as he left it, but
the money was gone. In the mean time
one of the crew left the ship and the po
lice are now on his trail. The mate thinks
this man had a pass key and thus gained
access to the room.

Mr. Louderback presents an affidavit
pworn to by J. A. Boyle, in which Boyle
charges that the suit was brought by col

of Police, and that in pursuance of such
collusion a false translation of the lot
tery blanks was furnished to the court.
the falsification being in the omission of
the name of the lottery company and
other Identifying matter In the center of
the blanks. He therefore filed a motion
to dismiss the FUlt.
At his own request Davis Louderback
was appointed yesterday by United States
Circuit Judge Morrow as amicus curlae
in the suit of Kim You against Chief of
Police Sullivan. The suit was brought to
recover 222 boxes of Chinese blanks for
lottery tickets seized by the police
several years ago. Kim alleges that the
Chinese characters on the blanks consti
tute a poem In the Chinese language, and
nothing else, and that they could not be
used as lottery tickets until after they
had been sold and marked in a particular

Now that the strike is over every vessel
that was tied up is trying to get away
and in consequence every wharf is crowd

128 berths and every one of them is oc

in the bay awaiting a chance to dock.
The Harbor Commissioners and Chief
Wharfinger Henderson are working like
beavers and have the situation well In
hand. At least half a dozen deep watei
ships will be discharged to-day and half
a dozen more will go to Port Costa Wed
nesday. This will make room for a dozen
vessels and if there Is not another rush
of arrivals during the week the situation
will be cleared up by Saturday. The com

When two days had passed Mrs. Robles
concluded that her boarder would not re

be taken off Mrs. Robles' hands and, if
the mother cannot be found, it will be
placed in some charitable institution.
A mysterious young woman who calls
herself Mrs. Josie Garcia is anxiously
sought by the authorities, who desire to
restore to her a two weeks old child,
which she left with Mrs. M. Robles of
1109 Powell street last Saturday. The
woman came to board with Mrs. Robles
early in September. On September 16
the child was born and on October 5 the
mother disappeared, leaving the little one
behind.
It is stated that Mrs. Garcia was a
very prepossessing young woman and was
attired in stylish and expensive clothes.
During her stay she received money

The Chinese exclusion act, after having bepn
in existence tor about ten years, will expire
In May. 1902. and at the next session of Con
gress the question of its re-enactment shall
have to be decided.
The Chinese Government, throusrh its rnin
itser and consuls, has already attempted to in
fluence public opinion by appeals and petitions
and other means known to diplomacy.
It is sufficient now to remind the American
people, should the bars be let down, that an
enormous immigration of Chinese coolies would
ir.undat* this country and overwhelm its free
vcrking population.
The standard of American civilzation. our
schools, churches, employment and family life,
our greatness in peace and power In war, are
in issue.
We invite you to meet In convention in San

City. The United States constitution pro
vides for the succession of the Vice Pres
ident in case of the. death, removal, res
ignation or disability of the President
and gives Congress power "to provide what
officer shall succeed In case of \u25a0 the death,
removal, etc., of the Vice President. . In
1793 Congress provided that in such^a case
th3 President of. the. Senate should suc
ceed and then the Speaker of the,Hou3e
of Representatives. This was of doubt
ful constitutionality ' and attended with
some inconvenience and dangers. Hence
Congress in 1856 provided that in such case
the succession passes next to the' Secre
tary of State, then to the Secretary of the
Treasury, then successively to the Secre
tary of "War, the 'Secretary of the Navy,
the Postmaster General, the Secretary of

After our first emotions, however, we
began to fear that he could not be the
genuine Robinson of our childhood, whose
thrilling adventures enthralled our fancy.
It was evident that this good Cruso was
not Defoe's wanderer, but simply an hon
est trader in Lynn. Besides, I find on
consulting the book that Defoe's hero
when he settled down ashore in 1705 w a3
then 73 years old. However, Robinson
Crusoe's grave is in Kings Lynn, and I
am glad that I havaseen it. Another in
scription that seemÂ»Â»to savor of a literary
character and may therefore interest you,
Is the following: "In memory of Mr!
Thomas Hollingworth, an eminent book
seller, a man of the strictest Integrity in
his dealings, and much esteemed by gen
tlemen of taste for the neatness and ele
grance of his bindings."
You will, I am sure, be glad to learn that
I have discovered the final resting place
of Robinson Crusoe, writes a correspond
ent of the London Sketch. He was ap
parently a worthy tradesman, who lived
at Kings Lynn, Norfolk, and died at that
ancient seaport at the end of the eigh
teenth century. His grave is in St. Nicho
las Chapel there, a fine large church built
In connection -with the parish church of
St. Margaret's. While deciphering some
of the Inscriptions on the gravestones
with- which the church is entirely paved
I discovered near the font a slab which
stated that "Elizabeth, wife of Robinson
Cruso," was buried there In the year 1761.
This immediately whetted one's imagina
tion. Lower down the slab said that
"Ann, daughter of the above," -was also
Buried there in 1762; and below this â mir
abile dictu!â was the following: "Also on
this side of the south pillar lies interred
the remains of Robinson Cruso, Upholder,
who departed this life on August 6, 1731,
in' his sixty-second" year." We stood spell
bound and did not mind in the least the
lack of the final "e," as we knew that
our forefathers -were not particular about
such small matters.
A REAL CRUSOE
THE POLKAâ Dancer, City. The polka
is of Bohemian origin, elating: back to 1830,
the music for it having- been v/ritten at
the dictation of a servant girl of Elbe*.-:
teinitz by a local musician named Neruda.
In Bohemia Its name was nimra, the pol
ka designation being a corruption of "pul
ka" (half), on account of its short half
steps. . It was danced at the court at
Prague in 1835, in Vienna in 1S39, in 1840
in' Paris and in 1844 In London.- " . â¢
It is stated that many Senators and Congressmen
have declared therriselves " favorable to the change.
Moreover, the- District -of .Columbia Committee
appointed to take charge of the movement is conduct
ing the campaign of education on the subject with
great vigor. Some authorities have been 'quoted to
the effect that the change can be made by statute,
but the prevailing opinion is that. nothing" less than
a constitutional amendment will be sufficient. Unr
questionably, an amendment, would-be most satisfac
tory,'despite the difficulty of obtaining it, and accord^
ingly that plan will doubtless be adopted^W'hen^the
qt!estion'comes"upr*^\l*;^ j ;i
BY the frequency with which the Eastern press
discusses the movement in Washington to
bring about a change in the dates fixed for
the inauguration of Presidents and the terminations
.of Congresses, it ,would seem, that, the issue is going
to be brought up for settlement^ during the winter
and will constitute one of the important ;measures of
the coming session:
The plan is' to change the date of inauguration to
some day later in the spring. -" The benefit will be
something more than that gained by the change from
the weather of stormy March*to that of balmy May.
\u25a0It .will add something. like -two months to the short
session of Congress, and in; that' way will be^ a
valuable aid to legislation; Congress does not get
down to work much before the holidays, and accord
ingly, when the term of a Congress* closes on March
4, it has but little more than two months in which to
transact business. : Again and again measures of
great interest to the countrylhave been, defeated by
reason of. the shortness of the term. . The addition,
therefore, of two months to the short term would
greatly promote public welfare. /
Under the present rule each Congress has to. do
most of. its -work during its first session, and accord
ingly such sessions frequently extend all through -the
summer and occasionally^well into the fall. If, how
ever, the, second session did not close until the end
of^ April or' early in May there would be no neces
sity for a summer session during the long term. '\u25a0\u25a0> ';
TWO eminent clergymen in the East, during a
recent convocation of their church, took occa
sion to record their opinion that the world is
not only worse than ever, but that its tendency is
toward stili worse moral conditions.
We think that these religious pessimists err. ..Their
error lies in a wrong estimate of the conditions
\u25a0which they are comparing. If they would realize
that there was always good in the \\orld, and learn
that the history of remote ages recorded evil deeds
and left the good without a witness, they would con
clude that this age is neither better nor worse than
any that preceded it. There is the evidence of anal
ogy- that every age has been characterized by the
goodness and morality of man. In the remote past,
Â«s now, the evil deed, being exceptional, finds a rec
ord, while the good, being common, is for thatrea-'
son unnoticed. The same system that produced
Dionysius produced also Pythias and Damon.
David sent Uriah to be killed in the front of battle,
but when he mouraed for Absalom it was an expres
sion of the passion of paternal sorrow, common to
all men.
In every age, under all systems, in the Occident
and in the Orient, those who have had a vision of
truth have turned it toward their fellow men as a
means of bettering their conduct and sweetening
their lives. The human heart did not wait for any
special dispensation, or system of theology. Its*
promptings were toward the right and against the
v\rongfrorri the beginning of man's self-conscious
ness. -Those' who claim for one dispensation or. one
revelation, over all others, a special and more than
natural influence ovc* man, may grow weary waiting
for expected results, transcending all that had gone
before. Delay may make them pessimists, and by
seeking an ideal in causes that cannot produce it they
may despair and turn upon man" with an expression
of bitter disappointment.
But to the philosopher all ages have been good, all
men capable of seeking the truth, all plastic to the
effect of moral example, all appreciating their weak
ness, able to discern and deplore their fall, and
scarcely any who would not rise again and be
clean. It is so with this age, which has in retrospect
the inspiring view of all -that has gone before. The
sins of the past, though more frequently inscribed in
history than the virtues, surely have not been pre
served in form and features that allure imitators.
The heart of nian needs no history to tell him that
always men everywhere have felt as he feels, have
had the same choice between good and evil, right
and wrong, that is his, and have as often chosen the
truth and rejected the false, and have as bravely
staked all on their choice. Past ages having been
better than they seem, their wickedness was like that
of to-day, the exception and not the rule. Man now
is better, noticeably better, than ever before, since
he is learning to do right because it is right, and not
in "hope of a reward or fear of punishment. If one
were asked for a quality that distinguishes this above
i>!l periods in the past; this is that quality. Men al
ways did right and shunned wrong, but more men do
right now for right's sake than ever before, and
fewer do right from the lower motive of a reward
promised or a punishment threatened.
. If these pessimistic and complaining clergymen
would consider man as a reasonable being, with an
eternal germ of good in him. and less as a clod to be
fashioned into shape by some external influence,
their indictment of the age would be quashed for
non-statement of facts sufficient to justify it.
It. is believed Lipton would like to try again with
trie same yacht, but with another captain. He wishes
the cap just as much as ever, but he is not quite so
Â«SW to go to the expense of building another boat.
WHEN William C. Whitney announced his
withdrawal from the British turf it was re
ported that his decision was due to dissat
isfaction with the treatment he had received from the
racing authorities there. Mr. Whitney has now in a
public letter denied the report. He says: "Nothing
could be further from the truth. I have received
nothing but courtesy and fair treatment abroad. We
Americans have invaded England with new methods
of training and riding, and with- American-bred
horses have won a fair share of the stakes. It would
have been perfectly natural if these successes . had
given rise to some jealousy in' sporting 'circles;<but"
I have never ljad evidence of the existence of such a
feeling."
Having disposed of the erroneous report, Mr.
Whitney goes on to explain why he retired from
horse-racing abroad, and in doing so has presented
a statement of facts which have an interest for a far
wider circle than any that would have felt much con
cern over the. original story. Mr. Whitney's retire
ment is due- to his belief that 'American racing has
now become as -notable as that of England, and that'
it is no longer necessary for American horsemen to 1
seek .the English turf in order to find sp.orfdf the
highest kind and prizes worthy .of their best efforts,
Mr. Whitney says: "The dominating reason > for
withdrawing my stable from England is the success
of the efforts of late years" to raise the standard ; of
racing in this country. Certain gentlemen, have de
voted most of their time to this work, and I consid
ered it my duty, as one who derives great satisfaction
from horses, to second their efforts in every way. -It
was for this reason that I co-operated with them to
revive the. Saratoga Associatron and abandoned a
contemplated trip abroad this 'summer. The send
ing of our best horses abroad "depreciates. the quality
of the sport at home and diverts needed revenues
which should be contributed to. enrich our own stakes
and encourage breeding here."; .
* It is conceded -by Mr. Whitney that Americans
having eligible horses likely to win what he calls
"one of the classic races like the Derby, the Oaks or
the Leger," might justly send the horses abroad, be
cause "winning one of those races reflects credit on
our breeding- and is properly 'a matter of pride to
Americans." With that exception, however, he holds
j that American money and American horses â¢ should
.be used for the advancement of. American raciner
\ Such sentiments will have the approval of' all- wllo

A MAY INAUGURATION.
BASEBALLâ Player, City. The first
baseball match took place in Hoboken,
N. J., June 19, 1846. Baseball had been
originated about nine month3 before, hav
ing. gradually grown out of the old, game
of rounders into iownball, and on Septem
ber 23, 1S45, the national game was estab
lished by the organization, of the Knick
erbocker Club. .Its. growth was so slow,
that it was not until 1860 that Philadel
phia organized a club.
Plaintiff says, that it has repeatedly no
tified the. defendant of this annoyance
which has caused the loss of so much val
uable time and which was due to defend
ant's negligence, but that nothing has
been done" on the part of the latter to
correct the trouble. When the telephone
was put in plaintiff saya that it was as
sured that there would be no annoyance
by reason of the fact that it was a "two
line telephone."
The -petition continues further, "that
defendant has dally for a period of at
least two months next preceding August
15, 1901, sent calls over the plaintiff's line
and caused plaintiff's bell to be rung when
neither plamtiff nor any one in Its employ
or any one upon its premises was desired,
and that 'plaintiff has been subjected to a.
continuous annoyance and ha3 lost much
time in answering said calls and attend
ing to said, telephone in answer to the
ringing of said bell, at each of which calls
plaintiff or some one in Its employ would
discover that the call was not meant for
G01A, . which is plaintiffs -telephone, but
would be intended for some other tele
phone."
The Hegan Mantel Company filed suit
against the Cumberland Telephone and
Telegraph Company in the Jefferson Cir
cuit Court yesterday, asking damages for
$1000.
The petition says that the plaintiff sub
scribes to one of the two-line telephones
of the defendant. It is what Is commonly
known as a party line, having two ter
mini, numbered C01A and 601Y. respective
ly. The plaintiff further alleges that the
defendant, upon placing the telephone,
agreed to maintain it free from defects
of all kinds for the consideration of the"
sum of 16 50 a month.

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHYâ Mrs. S.
O., City. This department has not the
space to give in detail how the wireless
system of telegraphing is operated. If
you will go to the Free Public Library
you \u25a0wilV find several interesting articles
on the subject in volume seven of the
Cyclopedic Review of Current History,
1897, and in volume nine of the same, 1S99.
The method Is fully explained in these
volumes.
Such has been the prosperity of the country during
the past summer that the revenue reduction act, which
was calculated by fiscal experts to reduce the revenues,
by $40,000,000 annually, will actually reduce them by
less than $25,000,000. The surplus in the Treasury is
piling up and Secretary Gage is kept busy devising
means to get it into circulation again. It is an old
saying that a surplus is better than a deficit, but all
the same it has its drawbacks.
PORCELAINâ Ella, . City. Porcelain
may be cleansed by the use of castile
soap and hot water. If it is ornamental
a brush should be used to remove dirt
from the parts that cannot be reached
with a cloth. If the porcelain has become
discolored It is by reason of some defect
through -which foreign matter has got un
der the glazing. Such cannot be removed.

PERSONAL \u25a0â¢ MENTION.
REPORTS from Boston -are', tq the 'effect that
the New England Free .Trader League is
about to enter upon a new campaign of agita
tion against the tariff and will .prosecute it with
greater vigor, than for many years past. It is. an-;
nounced that at the next meeting of the league the
increased comprehensiveness of its membership and
its work will be marked by dropping "New England"
from the title and starting the new agitation as "The
American Free Trade League."^:; â¢;
The reports state that' all members who have been
consulted favor the proposed change of title. The
league has members in thirty-six States, and 'upward
of 40 per cent of them reside outside New. England.
It is believed the national title will attract, additional
members and will moreover make the league more
popular with the masses. ..Arrangements have been
made for the publication, Wery week of (articles in"
favor of ftee trade, and among the ' writers will be
professors at some of the greater universities. of the
country. The articles are tos appear in -newspapers,
in all parts of the Union, , and Consequently the
effects of the agitation will be felt to a, greater or
less degree among all classes of the people.
An attack of the kind proposed is likely to" prove
a matter of serious concern to the country. The
Democratic party, without a leader and without a,
platform, will doubtless be quite willing to swing into
line with the Free Trade League and give the move
ment all the assistance that a strong though dis
credited political machine can render. Several of
the foremost Democratic papers have, in fact,
already spoken of the advisability of reviving the
fight against; protection as a means of reuniting the
party. The campaign of the Free Trade League
must therefore be looked upon as something more
than a mere academic discussion.. Unless the move
ment be vigorously combated from the start, we
may yet. have another period of industrial disturbance
caused by subjecting our fiscal system anew to. the
turmoil of party strife, and all the evils of the old
agitation will return to plague us. '
It is to be noted that the league will not attack the
protective system directly. The former agitation was
conducted under the specious title, "tariff reform,"
and the new campaign is to be waged by similar
tactics. The Boston correspondent of the Spring
field Republican says the special subjects which the
league proposes to consider in' the coming season are
the tariff in the tropics and reciprocity especially
with Canada. It is believed ' that a considerable
number of Republicans can be brought over v to favor
reciprocity, and that by their aid and that of the
Democrats it will be possible to wear away many of
the protective features of the present tariff and so
bring about divisions in the Republican party itself.
It is but a short time since we had ample experience
of the results of intrusting free trade doctrinaires and
Democratic politicians, with the work of framing a
tariff. That j experience can hardly have been for
gotten by the people, so that the chances of success
for a free trade movement at this time are slight, but
none^ the less the new agitation may prove danger
ous. Reciprocity as defined by Republican platforms
is a wise policy, but unless the people are watchful
it will not be easy to confine reciprocity to that
definition. Several of the so-called reciprocity
treaties now before the Senate threaten some of the
greatest interests of California, and should new ones
be arranged they might be as dangerous. Once more
then the people must rally for the defense of Artieri
can industry.. Its foes are again on the warpath. â¢ -

THEODORE ROOSEVELT is the twenty-fifth man to ssrve as the nation's chief executive, but Cleveland
served a second term after 'bring defeated for re-election after his first term. â¢ Thers have been twenty
eight elections since and including the first in 1789. Five men dird in officeâ three from assassination.
Twenty of the twenty-five different men were lawyers. William and Mary College ana nay
each graduated thres Presidents. Seven Presidents were born in Virginia; five in Ohio, threp in aew xor*,
three in North Carolina, two in Massachusetts. William Henry Harrison was the oldest upon assuming oJice,

During the recent disorders in this city the police
were the victims of the same policy. The only. way t
for an officer to get the Examiner's praise was by
perjured neglect of his duty.
Now it need not be wondered at that this sort of
journalism, persistently indulged in San Francisco,
Chicago and New York, has come to bd considered
by the people as a standing menace to public order,
and men are alarmed when these papers declare that
the destruction of order and of law is their purpose.
Announcing_ that "the rich" are in favor of law and
order, "the poor" are educated in the belief that law
and order, therefore, are oppressive of them, and
must be destroyed.
All men who stop io think know the falsity as well
as the danger of such education, for they know that
the so-called poor are the greatest and first bene-.
ficiaries of the law and of its scrupulous execution, so
that this sinister teaching is for the undoing of the
very class to which it is addressed.. â¢.
Being at last awake to the crimes and offenses of
such" journalism, the'people should beware of its cun
ning and persistence; and watch for its furtive and
covert renewal, and administer prompt punishment
when it appears.
When Garrett and Williams were trying to rid
Arizona of the worst gang of thieves and murderers
that have infested a district since the days of Murrell
and the Mississippi pirates, the Examiner settled . a
writer in that Territory to assist the scoundrels and
abuse the officers. Perhaps no more outrageously
criminal journalism was ever known than its exhibi
tion of sympathy for robbers and murderers openly
declared hi that affair. Every law officer in Arizona,
Federal and Territorial, who did his duty was pur
sued with a venom and malice most appalling, and
every escape of a criminal was hailed as a triumph of
virtue. When felons were convicted they were
encouraged to cherish vengeance against the day of
their, liberation, when they were to seek violent re
venge upon the officers of the law concerned in their
capture.
All this work in journalism was done in that
strabismic style of bathos peculiar to the Examiner,
school of writing, and was displayed sensationally.
Carrying the same. habit into politics, it was natural
that the President, his Cabinet, and all charged with
the execution of the law, should in their turn get the
same treatment as the local officers who in this State
and Arizona had tried to make life and property v safe
from the Examiner's felon friends.
1^ HE case of the people against lawless and dis
orderly journalism has been tried and decided
in'favpr of law and order. But the plaintiff in
the case should watch with care . a revivescence of
what at present seems a dead eyii.
'>By common^ consent. the Hearst papers have been
selected as the worst and foremost examples of ; a
p~o!icy designed to undermine respect for. law, con
fuse the ideas of right and wrong, and tp present vice
and crime in the garb of virtue and honor.
The sustained, and insidious steps by which those
papers, went steadily forward from heroizing vulgar
criminals to incitement of the murder of the Presi
dent is an interesting study of the cultivation of the
abnormal b3 f suggestion. ' Train robbers and mur
derers in this State were giorified and -praised, their
criminal courage and cunning held up to admiration,
until all weak and Willful minds* were convinced that
they were men of merit, worthy to be imitated and
deserving of the praise bestowed upon them. At the
same time the sworn officers of the law, who in the
midst of peril and difficulty were trying to bring them
to justice, were stigmatized as "man hunters,"
every effort was made to thwart them by giving pub
licity to their plans, rnd their failures to catch the
cunning felons were gloated over. The Examiner
put crime on the stage in a drama that celebrated
stealing and murder as virtues, and . it did all this
by holding up what it calls "the rich" as deserving to
be despoiled and as the proper victims of the thief
and assassin.

are interested in American racing. matters. - There is
no reason why there should not be established in this
country racing events holding just as_high a place
in the history of sport as the classic^cvents of/Eng
land. Racing on this side of the water ought to be
good enough for anybody. It is of course pleasing
to our national pride to have an American horse,
ridden by an American jockey, carry off the blue rib
bon of the British turf, but it will be still more grati
fying to us when we have racing -events- in our own
country of such a high order that the victor. in one
of them' will be accounted higher than the. victor in
the Derby. . "

the Government of the province of Brit
ish Columbia. Mr. BabcocU has an inter
national reputation as an authority on the
propagation of salmon and trout. His
knowledge is purely practical, and has
been applied with marked success in this
State.
It is the intention of the British Colum

waters of the Fraser -River, which even

now carry more salmon than any other
river on the Pacific Coast. This Is the
work Mr. Babcock has been asked to un
dertake. The desire is to propagate as
many fish as possible. The extent of the
canning Industry is Indicated by the pres
ence of forty-eight establishmcits on the
river.
M.r. Bafccock first entered the service
of the Board of Fish Commissioners in
April, 1S91, a3 a patroman. In the ensu
ing year his work had made such an im
pression on the officers of the board that
he was made chief of the patrolmen. He
was still further advanced in the follow
ing year to the office of chief deputy,
which position he has hen* up to the pres
ent time. During the ten years he has
served the commission its membership
has changed ?even times. During the
same period three Governors have had

Becognizsd as an Authority.
The chief deputy of the board Is its ex
ecutive officer. On him devolves the work
of carrying out the orders of the mem
bers, who are usually chosen because of j
their fondness for fishing, shooting and
other sports of the fiekl.
Mr. Babcock Is a recognized authority
on the propagation of salmon and trout.
He planned - the hatcheries at Oleira,
Marin County; Wawona. Yosemite Val
ley;. Eel. River, Humuoidt Cojnty. and
the immense salmon station at Battle
Creek. Tehama County. This is the
largest salmon station in the world. In
1Â£9S. its third season, while still under the
direction of Mr. Eabeock. 4Â«.iÂ»}.C00 ralmcn
eggs were hatched. Tills Is. the greatest
number ever taken in one season at one
station. It was more than ail the other
hatcheries on the ccast combined pro
duced. Since Mr. Babcock assumed
charge as chief deputy there has been
hatched under the jurisdiction of the
board 105,1S4,5â¬0 salmon and 31.425.0i0 trout.
These have all been distributed In the
public waters of the State to supply both
sport and food for its people.
Framed Protective Law.
Mr. Ba'ccock framed and defended at
Sacramento the present law fcr the pro
tection of salmon. Under its benefic?nt
workings the hatcheries are run to their
full .capacity, while tho catch has in
creased steadily. The Sacramento is the
great salmon " river of California. It 13
also a profitable field for the fishermen,
as their catch iB marketed at once at good
prices, and not canned, as is the practice
elsewhere.
Mr. Babccck's headquarters will be at
Victoria. For the next year or more he
expects to spend the rr.r.jor portion of his
time on the Eraser River, studying the
habits of the salmon and determining the
best locations for hatcheries.
Eldred went to the mine, and after
working there for some weeks and not

Two Physicians Both Agree on the
New Scientific Dandruff Treatment.
Dr. J. ' M. Powell of Spokane, Wash.,
says: "Herplcide has given good satis-
faction in my family for dandruff."
Dr. W. G. Alban of Walla Wa'.Ja,
Wash., says: "I find Herplclde all '.h:tt

shall prescribe it." Dandruff is a germ
disease and you can't cure It unless you

SANDUSKY, O., Oct. 7.â A. W. Miller,
formerly City Clerk, who left here last
February and who is said to have made
away with nearly $100,000 of the city's
funds, has been located at Havana, Cuba.
Chief of Police Welngates and City Soli
citor Henry Hart have gone after him.
A telegram was received from Havana
saying that Miller was there and asking
what would be paid for his surrender. A
reward of $500 was voted by the Council
and a reply was received that Miller
would be turned over by his betrayer for
that amount. A Cuban who made the of
fer said that Miller is poor, friendless and
in a pitiable condition.

HANFORD, Oqt. 7.-Offlcials of Kings
County have to deal with a murder mys
tery that is baffling In its lack of sub
stantial details upon which to work.
The body of a young stranger, about 25
years of age, with the throat cut from
ear to ear, was found to-day by hunters
on the bank of the Last Chance Ditch,
near Hanford. The corpse lay under a
willow tree. The Coroner, who made an
examination, found that the larynx and
both the inner and the exterior jugular
veins were severed. That the man was
.murdered there Is no doubt, as the phy
sicians who examined the wounds say
it would have been impossible fpr him to
inflict them himself. * The victim's face
and right hand are bruised, as though
he had strug-gled with his murderer. His
clothing was stripped of everything of
value and there is nbthlng by which to
identify him. The place where the mur
der was committed Is a lonely spot, ahd
if the hunters had not accidentally stum
bled across the body it might have lain
there for days.

NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 19Ol.-Drf Louis Ma
rion, a prominent physician of Havre,
France, who Is at present in this city, in
.an interview to-day said: "While it is
not surprising that bo many Americans
get dyspepsia, considering the way they
live and particularly what they eat, yet
It Is surprising that so many suffer so
long from the disease, as it is. In fact,
very easy to cure if the, right course Is
pursued. The inner lining of the stomach
of a person suffering with dyspepsia is
covered with a coating of unhealthy mu
cus, which prevents the proper flow of
gastric fluid. Stimulants to the gastric
juice may give temporary relief, but as
they do not remove the true cause of the
disease they cannot effect a cure, while
they frequently aggravate It, owing to
their poisonous properties. All that is
necessary to cure dyspepsia is to take a
little hydrozono in a half-glass of water
before meals and a teaspoonful of glyco
zone after meals. The nydrozone, being
a powerful but non-injurious antiseptic
and pus destroyer, breaks down the mor
bid element, while glycozone, acting on a
clean surface, subdues the inflammation.
This method of treatment is in accord
ance with reason and' experience shows
it entirely successful."

REDDING, Oct. 7.â Owners of large
droves of hogs in Northern California,
with the assistance of Assemblyman J.
A. Hubbard, have united in an effort to
check the unparalleled plague which has
carried off 300,009 hogs In the northern
portion of the State during the past six
months and whose present ravages
threaten an aggregate loss of $1,000,000.
Mr. Hubbard has returned from Red
Bluff, where a convention of the hog
raisers of the five northern counties was
held. It was decided not to ask for aid
from the Federal Government, for fear
this entire section would be quarantined.
The State, which cannot declare a live
stock quarantine, will be called upon.
The growers who assembled at Red
Bluff described the various treatments
they had used. One had found a tea
spoonful of lime efficacious In the early
stages of the disease, and another advo
cated a teaepoonful of sweet spirits of
niter and five or six drops of carbolic
add as a good preventive. One man from
Colusa County, who had tried various
remedies, lost his entire band of 3800 hogs.
The growers unanimously passed a res
olution calling upon Professor Hilgard of
the State University to send experts to
investigate the disease. A meeting of
delegates from all counties north of Sac
ramento will be held at Red Bluff on
October 19, when further steps will be
taken.
It Is eald that the meat of hogs which
die of the plague Is not affected, and the
startling statement is made that packers
will accept them when sick if they can be
landed at the San Francisco packing
houses before death. '

Then Block told him about Lizette, and
Hunse declared that he was In love with
her right away. Block likewise told
Hunse that his intended was well off and
had a large ranch, whereat Hunsa ap
peared to love her all the more.
So the bargain was made, and the two
were united this morning by Justice
Parker. It is said that Mrs. Hunse Is of
the opinion that, at the price, she got
her husband fairly cheap.
"Well," exclaimed Block, seeing his op
portunity, "1 can get you a wire and a
ranch both tocether."
"Now you're talking," said Hunse, de
lighted at the idea.
"I don't want any chicken ranch. If I
had a chicken ranch I'd have to have a
wife, and I have no wife."
STOCKTON, Oct 7.-Lizette Brown,
with the aid of $500 in hard cash, has
managed to change, her name to that of
Mrs. Andre"as Hunse. The transaction is
accounted for in this way;
Some time ago Lizette Brown, who is 55
years of age, applied to E. Block, an em
ployment agent. She \u25a0wanted a husband,
and 6he declared her willingness to pay
Block $500 for a suitable one. Block tried
hard to earn the $500, but had about lost
hope when Hunse, aged 52, came to pur
chase some ranch property from him.
Block tried to sell him a chicken ranch,
but Hutee demurred. Said he:

"Warships Can't Reach Bulgaria.
Turkey has no influence with Bulgaria.
Russia s influence is paramount. With
the Russian agent at Sofia and Consul
General Dickinson acting in harmony it
is believed by the authorities that results
of some kind will follow, if not in the
way of -Miss Stone's release, in the ap
prehension and punishment of the bri
gands who were the. actors, though per
haps not principals, in the abduction. For
the moment the- authorities are bending
all their efforts to the one end of saving
Miss Stone.
The time limit fixed by the brigands
within which the ransom must be paid
will expire to-morrow, but the State De
partment has assurances that a few days'
respite will be granted in order to give
the friends of the missionary an oppor
tunity to raise the amount demanded
The , department is highly gratified with

Money for Miss Stone's Release Being
. Rapidly Subscribed.
BOSTON, Oct. 7.â Nearly half the money
needed to ransom Miss Ellen M. Stone,
the missionary, from the Bulgarian brig
ands has been placed in the 'hands of
Kidder. Peabody &Â«Co. The exact fig
ures at midnight were $45,543 40 cash and
J7.500 in pledges. Of this amount the firm
this afternoon sent $35,000 to the State
Department to be forwarded to its consu
lar agent at the place where It can be
used most expeditiously. Members of the
firm, when informed of the Associated
Press cablegram from London to the ef
fect that the Vienna advices indicate
there would be a month's extension of
time In which' to paythe ransom, said the
forwarding of money would not be delay
ed in the least. During the afternoon the
officials of the American board in charge
of Congregational missions met infor
mally. .
Nothing was talked of except Miss Stone
and the matter of the ransom. The offi
cials personally contributed to the ran
som, but as officials they took the posi
tion they have maintained all along, that
it would be inadvisable for them, as a
missionary board, .to pay the ransomâ
this for the reason that it would be put
ting a premium on brigandage that must
In the end make missionary, work In wild
and rough countries more difficult and
possibly impracticable. After this meet
ing it was . officially given out that the
State Department \u25a0 at Washington has
agreed to take full charge of the delivery
of the ransom to the brigands. If news
comes that Miss Stone still lives, or until
the news of her death is received, col
lections for the ransom will continue to
be made. ....

The following telegram was received
yesterday by Mayor Phelan urging him

â¢The Colon at this time had gained
epeed and was inshore, I suppose, some
seven miles. After passing the Viscaya
we steamed ahead and ceased firing. The
men were allowed to come out of the tur
rets one at a time to get a breathing
epell. although of course all guns were
manned and everything ready, but the
gaining upon the Colon was very -slow, in
fact she gained apparently on ub. This
was about 11:15 a. m., when the Viscaya
ftood in for Aceireadores. The chase waa
continued then after the Colon. I know
H must have been six or seven miles,
until we gradually began to gain. I re
member keeping- the stadimeter at work
on her. although the 13,000 yards would
not register on the stadimeter. I remem
ber at one time telling Commodore Schley
that it was within 14,000 yards and my
recollection Is he told some one to signal
the Oregon to try one of her 'railroad
trains.' At any rate shortly afterward
The Oregon fired one of her thirteen-inch
shells, which fell short Then we tried an
"The Brooklyn did all she could. She
got into action just as quick as steam
could carry her there. We commenced
firing as soon as the first gun on the port
bow -would bear, and we kept the port
battery firing until she turned with port
helm, through the arc, using the aft guns
until we got all our starooard guns to
bear. We got around as quickly as we
could with port helm until we almost par
alleled the course of the leading Spanish
vessel, when the helm was eased and the
ship steered a course parallel with the
Viscaya, which was then the leading ves
sel, although the Maria Teresa probably
was farther to the westward than the
Viscaya. She was standing at an angle
into the shore. When we got around the
smoke was so dense nothing could be seen
of anything in the rear of us. The three
Spanish ships we were then engaged with
were the Viscaya, Colon and the
Oquendo. The Viscaya was about 2500
yards on our starboard bow; the Colon
probably was a little forward of the star
board bow. The Oquendo was .abaft the
starboard beam. We continued in that
direction, when I remarked to Captain
Cook that it seemed rather lonely for us
out there. He was in the conning tower.
He asked: "Why?" I said that we were
all alone with the three Spanish ships,
and it seemed that it depended on us to
knock them out. At that time the smoke
was so dense I could not eee anything-,
and 1 supposed that the New York being
away the Brooklyn was steaming ahead
of the slower vessels. He stepped out of
the conning tower and exclaimed to me:
"What's that off our starboard quarter?'
I looked In that direction and saw the
heavy bow of a ship and said it must be
the Massachusetts. He said: 'No,, it can
not be the Massachusetts; she has gone
to Guantanamo.' I said: 'It must be the
Oregon.' and he remarked: 'God bles-s
the Oregon.' I said: 'Well, I am very
glad to see her.' The Oregon was at
that time about, I should say, four or flve
hundred yards off our starboard quarter,
at full epeed. We continued in that posi
tion until the Brooklyn's speed began to
increase as we got up steam and probably
drew a little farther ahead from the Ore
gon. She never was that close to us
.again, as I remember. The Oquendo very
shortly fell out and went ashore. The
Colon gradually drew ahead and also
went in shore. I remember very well the
time that the Viscaya blanketed her from
our tire. This chase was continued in
that direction until when off Acerreadore
the Viscaya ported her helm, and ran in
chore.
Chase After the Colon.
WiLat th.e Brooklyn Did.
The witness then, in response to a re
quest from Raynor, continued his descrip
tion of the naval battlt of July 3 from
the point where he had dropped that de
scription at Captain Lemly's request
while he was on the stand Friday. In this
connection he said:
He stated that the picket boats, the
Marblehcad and the Vixen, were inside
the line of the fleet, about midway bc
twoon that line and the short line.
"Early in the daytime our habitual po
sition was about six m\les. In the after
noon. I think, we steamed up and down
in front of the harbor a distance of about
six miles."
"How far were you off during this
blockade of Saniiairo from the llorro dur
ing the day and night of May 28, 29, 30
and 01?"
Commander Hodgson said in reply to
these questions that he had seen the lights
on the shore .".T Cienfuegos, which were
afterward determined to be signals, but
he hud Fupposec they were signals be
tween different branches of the Spanish
service on shore. Ho added that when
Captain McCaila arrived with informa
tion as to the meaning of the signals he
was Immediately dispatched to the shore
to communicate with the insurgents. He
said that the progress of the squadron
was impeded between Cienfuegos and
Santiago by the heavy weathenâ the
smaller vessels, the Vixen and Eagle.
Raynor then asked:
Distance During- Blockade.
Raynor began his cross-exami nation by
afkliis Hodgson whether the Marblehead
had hailed the Brooklyn when the two
vessels passed each other as the Brooklyn
was on her way to Cicnfuegos. The wit
ness replied in the negative. The exam
ination then turned upon events about
Cier.fuepos, ani in reply to Raynor's in
quiry Hodgson detailed this at length.
negative, saying that the last paragraph
of his letter of denial had not been print
ed. This paragraph referred to the in
closure of a newspaper clipping.
"If you turned the port engine the
tactical diameter would have been short
ened, but the speed of turning would have
been reduced."
"I understood you to say you suggested
the reversal of the starboard engine at
the time this turn wa.s made, but that
that was rejected by Commodore Schley
after consideration, and discussion. Are
you clear that the starboard engine waa
not reversed?"
"I am very clear on that fact."
A number of questions were then asked
by the court, as follows:
"What was the distance of the Brook
lyn from the nearest Spanish vessel when
Commodore Schley said to Captain Cook:
'Look out, Cook; they're going to ram
you?" '>
"I should say the distance was about
2000 or 2200 yards."
"Did you observe the whole movement
of the Brooklyn from the time Commo
dore Schley gave the order, 'Hard aport,
Cook,' until the Brooklyn was steadied on
her course to the westward parallel to the
Viscaya?"
"I did."
"Did you hear any order given while
the Brooklyn was making the turn, to
ease or steady the helm?" v.
"Not until it was eased to parallel the
course of the leading Spanish vessel.
"In making the turn; did -the Brooklyn
turn .rapidly and continuously, or did she
have her head longer on some ' heading
than on others?"
"She turned rapidly and continuously."
"Did any of the Spanish ships attempt
to ram the Brooklyn in the early part of
the battle of July 3?"
"The Maria Teresa evidently made a
rank sheer to. port toward the Brooklyn
with the evident intention of getting into
closs quarters or ramming."
"What orders were signaled by the
Brooklyn to the fleet July 3, 1898?"
"I can only say from recollection that
"Had she turned the other way, was
there space enough for her to have made
such turn without endangering the
Texas?"
"Perfectlyâ perfectly clear enough
space."
"How much would have she gained to
the northward and westward had she
turned with starboard helm?" . . ..
"She would have gained a position of
about .600 or 700 yards nearer the Spanish
line." .......
"Would that distance have been re
duced by reversing the port engine?"
"He wanted me to write a denial of the
controversy," he continued. VI had pre
viously written that I could not deny the
statement. A letter followed asking for
a denial of the colloquy. I gave him this,
at the same time explaining that I had
admitted the gist of the report."
"Have you anywhere denied the sub
stantial accuracy of the facts as set forth
in the report of that colloquy?"
"On the contrary, I have admitted it."
Changing the line of examination,
Hanna then asked:
"When the Brooklyn turned with port
helm, did she blanket the fire of the
Texasâ did she go between the Texas and
the enemy?"
"I do not think she did. I thought, how
ever, she was going to do it."
Texas Not in Danger.
At this point Raynor introduced as evi
dence the official report made by Captain
Chadwick of his examination of the wit
ness with regard to tnis colloquy, for- the
purpose, as he said, of showing discrep
ancies between the statement made in
that examination and the statement now
made.
The introduction of this report caused
Captain Lemly to offer a statement made
by Lieutenant Commander Heilner on the
same subject, but Raynor objected to this
statement as not pertinent, and the court
after a consultation sustained the objec
tion.
Other statements were put In as evi
dence without objection, and Captain
Lemly- offered a letter from Captain
Chadwick to the Secretary of the Navy
in regard to an explanation contained in
a letter from Commander Hodgson, which
had just been iead and offered as evi
dence. Raynor called attention to "the
fact that this better contained an expres
sion of opinion, whereupon Admiral
Dewey said:
"We don't want it. We have not taken
opinions here." J *
Captain Lemly said/ that he had only
offered these documents for the purpose
of making the record complete.
The afternoon session of the court be
gan with a question put to Lieutenant
Commander Hodgson by Hanna. He
asked why he had written his categorical
denial of the newspaper report of the col
loquy between himself and Commander
Schley. The auestion was objected to,
and Admiral Dewey said:
"We have the facts. The letters were
written. That Is all the court wants. We
wants factsâ facts. People are influnced
by different kinds of things. We want
the facts. Draw out the facts." .
Hanna then changed his question, -and
the witness said that he had written his
explicit denial in response to a request
from Admiral Schley.
Continuing, he said that the dialogue
as reported was fictitious, and that he
had denied its verbal accuracy while not
denying the truth of a part of it. He
said that he had told Admiral Schley that
he could not repudiate the entire state
ment, and that he had not understood
him to request that he should do more
than deny its verbal accuracy. He al
ready, before writing his explicit denial,
told, the admiral that he could not deny
the whole story. He had given the news
paper reporters authority originally to
quote him as authority for the gist of the
statement
Not Taking Opinions.
"There is a sooddeal In that reported
colloquy that I did not say," he added
"The statement was never made " he
went on. "but the commodore did say
'Damn the Texas.' " '
Commander Hodgson replied that there
was no such expression in the letter and
that he had never said that the Brooklyn
would cut down the Texas.
Raynor then asked about the expression
attributed to the witnessâ "She will cut
down the Texas."
Raynor then questioned the witness
very closely in regard to the language in
which this colloquy was reported by the
newspapers, and the language used by
Hodgson in his correspondence with Ad
miral Schley. He read the newspaper
version of Commander Hodgson's state
ment of the colloquy as follows: *
"Schley â "Hard aport.'
"Hodgson â 'You mean starboard.'
"Schleyâ 'No, I didn't. We are near
enough to them (the Spaniards) already.'
"Hodgsonâ 'But we will cut down the
Texas."
"Schley â 'Damn the Texas; let her look
out for herself.'
Raynor then had the witness scrutinize
the letter which he had written to Ad
miral Schley on July 8, and drew from
him the statement that he had not then
informed the admiral that he had used
the expression "Damn the Texas."*
When the witness waa asked If he
thought there was any suggestion of any
such expression he replied: "When I sug
gested to Commodore Schley that there
was danger of colliding with the Texas
he said, 'Damn the Texas.' He used the
expression not In any way condemning
the Texas for being there, but as if he
was irritated as one might be about any
thing."
Said "Damn th.e Texas."
"She must have gone about 600 yards
to the southward, as that is about the
tactical diameter of the Brooklyn at tHat
speed."
"Did this turn interfere with the Brook
lyn's ability to keep up her fire?"
"It did not; she continued to fire from
her aft turret."
"Did you see the Indiana during the
engagement?" - â¢
"1 did not. The smoke was very dense
in the direction of the Indiana."
At this point Raynor questioned the wit
ness at length concerning his reported col
loquy with Admiral Schley during the
battle off Santiago, In which the commo
dore was reported to have said, "Damn
the Texas."
Rayner asked the witness if it was not
Captain Cook who had given the order
to "port helm.
The reply was that Captain Cook might
have given the order to the man at the
vÂ»-heel.
Raynor then asked: "Did Commodore
Schley give the order to port the helm?"
"He did." was the reply.
"Was the helm already aport?"
"I guess so; Captain Cook says so."
Objection was made by Captain Lemly
to the use of the word "guess" by the
witness, but Admiral Dewey said the
form of expression was immaterial, and
asked that counsel should not interrupt.
Continuing his statement in response to
Raynor's question, the witness said when
his conversation with Commodore Schley
had occurred on the Brooklyn the com
modore was standing on the platform
around the conning tower, â¢ and two or
three feet from himself (the witness), and
that Captain- Cook, a part of the time,
stood in the door of the conning tower,
four or flve feet distant. He said that
Captain Cook had taken part in the con
versation.
The witness said that the commodore
had occupied a place on a platform
around tire conning tower during the en
gagement. This, he said, was a position
of danger, as the commodore was there
always in full view of the enemy's ships.
"It has been stated here," said Ray
nor, "that the Brooklyn ran 200 yards
away, from the enemy's ships in mak
ing her loop."
The witness replied: "Any witness who
made that statement, although he may
have stated what he thought occurred,
was absolutely mistaken."
"How far did she go from the enemy's
vessels?"

our shot and we signaled to her the fall
of her shot. We continued occasionally to
fire, the Oregon her tnirteen-mch ana we
our eight-inch guns. I remember seeing
one ot the 13-inch shells on the Oregon
fail well ahead of the Colon and one ot
our eight-inch shells apparently fell In
shore of the Colon. At that time the
Colon ported helm hard aport. Previously
10 this she had ported her helm once or
twice, apparently seeking a soft spot on
shore, tone rirea her lee gun -and naulecl
down her flag. 1 pulled out my watch.
It was exactly 1:15. We then ceased llr
ing and slowed down, and orders were
given to get out a boat. The captain was
ordered to go on board to make terms
with or tell the terms to the commanding
officer of the Colon.
"How far waa the Oregon from the
Brooklyn?"
"From 1000 to 1500 yards on the star
board quarter."
The witness, in reply to questions, con
tinued his report of the battle. He said
that at the beginning of the fight he had
given the range at 1400 yards, but that
afterward it was about 24CO or 2500 yards.
Raynorâ What was the bearing of Ad
miral Schley during this engagement or
any engagement In which you saw him?
"His bearing and manner with respect
to an officer of his rank and station in
the naval service were naturally those of
a commander-in-chief of a, naval force
on that occasion."

my orders were, 'Clear ship for action
and close UD,' or 'close in.' "
"Did you know of any plan of battle
having been promulgated by Commodore
Schley in case of falling in with the
Spanish squadron?"
"I do not."
Captain Folger Talks.
Commander Hodgson was then ex
cused, and Captain W. M. -Folger,' who
commanded the cruiser New Orleans dur
ing the Spanish War, was called. He de
tailed his part in the campaign, beginning
with the New Orleans' arrival at Santi
ago as the convoy of the collier Sterling.
He also related how, on May 31, the New
Orleans had participated in the bombard
ment of the Cristobal Colon, then lying
in the mouth of Santiago harbor.
"What damage was done to the enemy
on that occasion?" asked Captain Lemly.
"I don't think there was any," replied
the witness.
The court asked Captain Folger whether
Commodore Schley's blockade of the har
bor of Santiago had been sulflcuently ef
fective to prevent the escape of the Span
ish fleet. His reply was:
"Had the weather been persistently
clear, yes. If rainy or misty, no."
He- said in reply to another question
that the weather was generally rainy.
"What, was developed as to tho shore
batteries?"
: "That they had not strength enough to
do any -material damage."
Captain Lemly asked in regard to the
developments -concerning the \u25a0 bombard
ment of June 14, but Raynor objected. The
court ruled that the question was admis
sible, a similar question by Admiral
Schley's counsel. having been admitted on
a former occasion.
"We cannot blow hot one time and blow
cold the next," said Admiral Dewey on
admitting the question.
Distance During Blockade.
Replying to the last question, Captain
Folger said that the reconnoissance had
failed to develop that the batteries had
any material strength, as a single vessel
had silenced them.
Recurring to the bombardment of May
31, Captain Folder expressed the opinion
that the shots which had fallen near the
fleet on that'date were from the Spanish
ships in the harbor, fired over the hill?
and not from the shore batteries. For
this reason he had directed all the New
Orleans' fire on that occasion at the Co
lon instead of the land batteries.
Describing the blockade of Santiago
harbor maintained by Commodore Schiey,
the witness said the distance during the
day was from flve to' eight miles, and at
night the vessels steamed in column back
and forth across the harbor,* somewhat
nearer in. He added that even though
the log of the New Orleans, had placed
the vesels nearer the shore, he would not
change his position: He did. not believe
the vessels were more than four miles
from the Morro on May 31.
Raynor asked: "What do 1 you know
about the strength of- the batteries, the
number, of the batteries or the strength
of the guns befo r e the reconnoissance on
May 31? What actual knowledge did you
have?"
"I had no knowledge whatever before
the reconnoissance." . ,
"Then on May 31, when this reconnols
sance or bombardment took place, so far
as you were concerned, you were abso
lutely in ignorance of the number of bat
teries or the strength of the guns?"
"Prior to the fire by the batteries I had
no knowledge."
"What knowledge did you acquire as
the result of that reconnoissance or bom
bardment?"
"By the number of shots that were
fired, by the character of the discharge,
the smoke, etc., as indicating the caliber
of the guns; by the fall of the projectiles,
the amount Â«of water they would throw
up and the evident direction of the fall,
as indicating whether tho projectiles were
moving with sreat velocity or slow. In
that way I judged alone."
"These things were developed as the re
sult of the reconnoissance, were they
not?"
Reconnoissance Successful.
"I consider the reconnoissance- in that
particular to have been successful."
"The reconnoissance was successful for
the purpose of developing the number and
strength of the batteries?" - â¢
"Eminently so." .
When the judge advocate again, took
the witness he asked:
. "Referring to' your answer that the fir
ing of the 31st was eminently successful
in developing the strength of the San
tiago .batteries, what, as a matter of fact,
was developed as to the strength of such
batteriesâ were they f.trong or other
wise?" '
"They were weak."
"Can you state whether the engagement
of May 31 developed the fact that the
Colon had anything larger than six-Inch
guns on board at that time?"
. "It did not occur to us that she fired
heavy guns. The caliber I cannot specify.
It did not appear' she fired the 11-inch
guns for which we knew . she had been
designed."
The court asked questions of Captain
Folger^as follows:
"Kor "what length of time was the New
Orleans able to lire at the Colon and tho
batteries on May 31 on each run?"
"1 think it was between five and â¢ ten
minutes."
"Did .you have, any conversation- with
Commodore > Schley as to his . purpose in
attacking the Colon May 31?"
"1 did not. The information I received
was by signal only." "
"By what method did you obtain the
range for your guns on May 31, while
firing at the Colon?"
"We obtained the necessity for a change
Continued from Page One.
of range by the fall of the projectiles."
"Were you furnished any plan of battle
by Commodore Schley to be followed in
case the Spanish squadron should . come
out?"
"No, sir."
Admiral Deweyâ You referred to a
signal from the flagship. The court would
like to know what that signal was.
"The . signal was, 'New Orleans, clear
ship for action,' and I think it was fol
lowed by the signal, 'the New. Orleans,
Iowa, Massachusetts will engage the
forts,* indicating that there was to be a
reconnoissance or bombardment. I do not
remember any conversation with the com
modore that bore on the subject."
Admiral Deweyâ The cÂ»urt would like to
know from the signal book exactly what
signals were made by the Massachusetts.
Signal to New Orleans.
The witness (reading)â "At 12:48, In
obedience to flagship, Massachusetts sig
naled to the New Orleans and Iowa to
clear ship for action; sounded to general
quarters and cleared ship for action. At
1 started ahead both engines, Massachu
setts leading." There were no other sig
nals in that watch. That is all that ap
pears to be In the log. I do not remember
discussing the subject with the commo
dore. â¢ * Â«
By the courtâ Were the blockading
sels near enough to the entrance of the
harbor at. night to prevent the escape of
the enemy, had such an attempt been
made? â¢ -" \u25a0.
"Had the weather been persistently
clear, yes; if the weather were thick,
rainy or foggy, no." . â¢'
Captain Parkerâ Were not the Vixen
and Marblehead inside the line?
"They were." -
"Was the weather good or bad during
these nights?"
"The weather was generally bad, rainy."
Lieutenant C. W. Dyson, was recalled.
He testified concerning the coal supply of
the scoutboats on May 26, the day the
retrograde movement toward Key West
was begun. He said in reply to questions
that no battleship could travel for more
than eight or twelve hours on forced
draught, and that on the day of battle
off Santiago the flagship New York had
all her boilers on and was making seven
teen knots, but that neither the Brooklyn
nor the Oregon made full speed on that
occasion, their maximum for the day
being fourteen or fifteen knots.
At 3:55 the court adjourned until to
morrow, f
BULGARIA'S COMPLICITY SUSPECTED

of Paine's celery compound have been
sending this greatest of all prepared rem-
edies to the four quarters of the earth, In
larger and larger shipments, relieving
and curing the sick, restoring the weak
and depressed to health and strength,
making it possible for many and many
a person to live who could find no relief
In well-intended prescriptions or anti-
quated and worthless sarsaparillas and
nervines.
In these years that have seen so many
quacks come and go, one so-called medi-
cine was put up by no more experienced
a hand than a pushing Philadelphia real
estate dealer; another has been and i3
now run In part by a group of sharp
newspaper men; another which originat-
ed as a pleasant thing for colds has add-
ed not to its virtues but to its schemes of
advertising until it has become in the
minds of its projectors a cure for all tbe
ailments under the sunâ and such In-
stances might be multiplied. Don't touch
them!
All these have had, or are having their
day, while the demand for America's
greatest family remedy â a real remedy
for real ills â an effective tonic an,d honest
lnvlgorator, has not suffered from the at-
tempted substitution of other prepara-
tions. Paine's celery compound ia a
medicine that cures the sick, and no hlsh
class druggist ever attempts to induce a
customer to take anything in its stead.
Paine's celery compound has gone on
steadily gaining In fame these years be-
cause those who have tried it have grate-
fully sung its praises, and in every enm-
njunity in the country have by word ot
mouth spread its fame.
According to the well known ethics of
.reputable .. physicians this prescription
was at the very outset freely presented
to physicians in good standing, and thÂ«
formula is gladly -given them to-day. -
For that reason , Paine's celery com-
pound has never been included amous
patent medicines. Coming from so hij;h
a source and so searchlngly tried and
recommended, physicians nave long em-
ployed it as unhesitatingly as they havo
used their official preparations.
It drives the poison germs of deep-
seated disease from the blood-.
It brings buoyancy of spirit In place of
lassitude and despondency.
It allows the overtaxed system to start
fairly on the road to health.
It procures the sleep so necessary to
brain ana nerve centers.
It strengthens.
Invigorates.
Gives new tone to the system.
Makes the blood healthy. T
Is food for the nerves.
Jt makes people well!
Thousands have been benefited, thou-
sands have been cured by Paine's cel-
ery compound, when everything else has
failed.
If ever a person needs to exercise the
God-given quality of common sense, it
is when he begins to be sick.
One can afford to be stupid or freakish,
or careless and frivolous when well.
There is no man so poor, If he has his
health, and his nerves are in good order,
his muscles sound and his stomach nor-
mal, who cannot correct his mistakes.
But the moment one falls sickâ when as
sure as fate disease with Its mild begin-
nings, if not promptly checked, is bound
to develop into serious Illnessâ there ia no
longer time to experiment or blunder.
The experience of the world has snovrn
that in every case of sickness resulting
from impaired nerves and Impure blood
Paine's celery compound does immediate
and effective good! For the last ten years
the thousands of authentic reports of in-
dividual cases have multiplied, until it
can be absolutely said thai in no one case
does this great remedy ever fail to bene-
fit, and if taken promptly to cure!
And yet during that time a hundred
worthless nostrums under patented
catchy names have been foisted upon the
public, andysome of them for a brief per-
iod have had large sales: But every one
of them having been tried has been found
sadly wanting, and after their unscrup-
ulous proprietors have made all the
money they could In "defrauding the wel'
and seriously harming the â¢ sick,- these
quack medicines and their catchy, siliy
names have disappeared from view.
There is a concoction being sold in 1M3
State to-day, where Its speculative ad-
vertising was begun a year later than in
other States, a year or two ago, which
has gone the way of its predecessors so
rapidly that in every section of the coun-
try! where it was first exploited the sales
have dropped off as rapidly, as they be-
gun, and the obscure company behind it
finds it no longer passible, "even by the
most sensational methods, to create any
demand .whatever for It. "
Unlike all these and other such prepar-
ations. â¢ ' Paine's celery compound has
stood the test of time and experience. It
is not a patent medicine; it is the dis-
covery of one of the greatest physicians
the .world has had, probably the most
successful practitioner in this country,
whose reputation was already established
as a specialist in nervous diseases and
who was and is the foremost authority in
the world on the diseases of the blood
and nerves, Professor Edward E. Phelps,
M. D., LL. D. As distinguished in his
way as his kinsman, that other great
Vermonter of the family of Phelps, who
as our recent Minister to the Court of St.
James so ably earned the title of diplo-
mat and statesman.
In these last ten years the proprietors

NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â Liquidation of the
eame character as that which has been mani
fest for some time past proceeded to-day. Some
ragged breaks in the price level of the market
resulted, but heavy and concentrated buying
was in evidence all day. As a consequence the
decline was checked, and the latter part of
the day was given over to a broad and com
prehensive covering movement, which lifted
prices throughout the list, the losses in the
railroad list being quite generally recovered
and largely reduced, even in the weakest of
the industrials. When the market opened a
feeling of discouragement was genera! es
pecially because last week's liquidation had
proved ineffectual to recuperate the conditions
of the banks, by reason of the extension of new
credits. The completion of the season of the
interior movement of currency was still to be
met, therefore, and the only clear source from
which to supply this requirement was by fur
ther liquidation in the stock market. Foreign
exehanpe continued to advance, precluding the
hope of relief from that quarter. Large selling
of stocks for London account sustained the ex
change market. Renewed demoralization In
foreign copper securities and forced liquidation
in Paris were the occasion for this foreign sell
ing, and the prompt' decline in Amalgamated
Copper he-e Rave promise of a continuance of
that disturbing influence. Pressure from the
lenders of money was undoubtedly at the root
of the stock market depression, but vulnerable
points in the Industrial list bore the brunt of
this pressure, rather than the railroad list In
general, and the rates for call loans were not
disturbed. There was a growing spirit of
skepticism as to the prospect of dividends on
industrial common etocks of which organiza
tions were dependent for success on continued
or even Increased prosperity, j This "sentiment
toward recent financial projects was extended
to the railroad world by reason of. the annual
showing of the Chicago. Burlington and Quincy

shewed a balance of earnings after charges in

CHICAGO. Oct. 7.â There were both bullish
and bearish conditions at the wheat opening
' which tended to influence the market in both
directions. Cables were higher and there was
a marked decrease on passage, which caused
1 December to open %@%c to %c higher at
\u25a069%c to 69%@6S%c. Under the influences of
heavy world's shipments and liberal receipts,
however, the market eased off to 68%c. There
was some early short selling, but on a report
of an improvement in the export demand the
shorts began to cover and strengthened De
cember. The report of a considerable increase
In the world's visible supply, however, eased
prices- for a time, but the bulls rallied and
December became more active and closed firm,
%c advanced at 69V4@69%c.
Corn had a quiet, narrow market of a lo
cal professional character. There was little
or no outside demand and local offerings were
light, and, following wheat, December gained
strength throughout the session. December
closed firm, %@%c advance at 57%c.
Oats were quiet. December ruled narrow and
closed firm, %c higher, at 35%c.
Provisions were dull and heavy, with the ex
ception of pork, which had a depressed mar
ket. Prices opened lower on lower prices for
hogs and sagged with continued liquidations
in pork. January pork closed 22%c lower; lard
closed 10c down and ribs 7%c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

' I^ate â¢Â»n advices from New Ycrk say: "The
eituatica on new California raisins was more
unsettled than ever yesterday and local buyers
have about given up trying to get raisins until
matters on the coast adjust themselves. There
Is no lack of buyers who would take round
lots at the last reduction of prices, but the
trade seems now to consider getting goods at
the quotations almost absolutely hopeless. None
of the orders Bent out Monday at the low
prices, so far as can be discovered, has been
confirmed by the association and there was
little further effort made yesterday to get busi
ness acoe^ted.
"The spot raisin market has b*en very little
If any affected by the mix up on the coast.
Stocks of nearly all descriptions of domestic
raisins are very light, scarcely enough, it Is
believed, to meet normal consumptive require
ments until new goods arrive in any quantity.
Seeded are in fair request at about 7%c for
cartons. Stocks of seedless Muscatels are quite
liberal, but very closely controlled and in
strong hands. New Valencia layer raisins, ar
rived per Manin, are selling more freely at
7c New MaJaga London layers, to arrive, are
offered at ?1 50*il 55, for 20-lb and 22-HÂ» boxes;
clusters, ?2 15; extra dessert, ?2 75.
"Currants are steady, but quiet. New goods
per Manin show good quality and are selling
in a small way at 6Q-6%c, for Amalia grade.
The market in Greece is reported unchanged.
General trade in dried fruits on spot is only
Jairiy active. With colder weather there would
be an improvement."

lyn Transit, which carried It down 4%, was
apparently baaed on the general condition of
poor earnings and an unduly high price. Sugar
was weak at the extreme decline of 3% on
dread of the effect of the war against beet
sugar. Atchison led the recovery on very con
fident rumors that the semi-annual dividend
rate is to be increased to 2 per cent There
were purchases by a single commission house
of several thousand shares each of various
stocks all around the room and this was sup
posed to represent covering by a large Western
bear contingent. The rally ran between 2 and
3 points In many of the principal active stocks
and the demand for Amalgamated Copper
showed some urgency, the stock rising 1% over
Saturday. The day's net gains are a point.
The covering demand made a firm closing. A
renewed advance in some of the Junior Van
derbilts was a feature of the day.
Railroad bends were weak early, but rallied
in sympathy with stocks. Total sales, par
value, 52,370,000.
United States new 4s declined *i per cent
on the last call.

A continued rise In Market Street Railroad
was the feature on the Bond Exchange on the
morning session. The cause of this steady ad
vance is causing more -or less conjecture on
the street. While nobody seems to have any
definite information it is supposed to be due
to either the rumored proposed stock dividend
or the bids of the Eastern syndicate for the
system, or perhaps both. The stock touched
$90, against $88 50 on Saturday. Makaweli Sugar
was also higher at ?24 75@21 87%. The oil
stocks continued dull.
In the afternoon Market Street- Railroad
touched $91. California Fruit Canners was also
higher at $58. Gas and Electric was lower at
?43 12Â»,Â£(342 87%.
The California Street Railroad Company will
pay a dividend of 50c per share on the 9th.
The San Jose Water Company will pay the
usual dividend of 50c per share on the 10th.
The Grand Prize oil assessment of %c was
delinquent October 5.
Dividends will be paid on the 15th as fol
lows: California Safe Deposit, $150; Oakland
Gas. 25c: Marin County Water, 75c; Port Costa
Water, 30c; Contra Costa Water, 42c.

Everybody does not like to be deceived,
but those who see Herrmann at the Cali
fornia Theater gladly admit that tho de
ception he practices upon them at that
theater is a little bit more than they
can fathom, even when it is all over.
Opinions are i divided as to what Is . his
most clever Illusion. His "Escape From
Sing-Sing" divides the attention of the
audience with his Illusion of "Noah's
Ark, or.. After the Flood." "The Turkish
Elopement" might easily be utilized to
draw down a prince's ransom, even from
a band of Bulgarian bandits. The vau
deville part of the programme Is also an
excellent part, that seems to rest the
One of the best programmes in the
history of Fischer's Concert House. was
given last night. Sylvia Puerari, the fa
vorite contralto, was warmly applauded
for her Italian and English songs in cos

graceful tiny girl dancer, made an im
mediate hit and was loaded down with
flowersi Watson, Davenport and Hamil
ton gave an amusing skit, "Masked
Love"; Roebel Simms, styled the "Tramp
Cartoonist," pleased the packed house,
and Sam Holds worth, the popular tenor,
changed his selections. Valkyra, an ex
traordinary hand balancer, and Bartel
mes, a novelty foot juggler, f umiehed
the acrobatic portion of the performance.
Val Vausden proved a clever entertainer.

The bonds of Julius M. Walling, charged
with grand larceny for stealing two valu
able diamonds from Mrs. Annie E. DÂ»dge,
519 Taylor street, were declared forfeited
by Judge Cook, Friday, as Walling failed
to appear for arraignment, and a bench
warrant was issued for his arrest. Yes
terday General W. H. L. Barnes explained
to the court that the District Attorney
had neglected to notify him of the calling
of the case and that Walling was at his
father's home in Nevada City and would
appear at the next calling of the case.
The Judge, under the circumstances,
withdrew the bench warrant and the for
feiture of -the bonds and continued the
case until Tuesday next.

There was the customary crush at the

The Central Theater presented a strong
melodrama last evening-, entitled, "Bea
con Lights." It was given an excellent
production. The plot is laid on the fron
tier between New Mexico and the South
ern republic, and is a succession of
strong and exciting incidents, -which
serve to introduce a motley array of the
strange and novel characters which are
the product of border life. The play was
elaborately staged; and for a first perfor
mance was unusually smooth. The larg-e
audience was one of the most, enthusias
tic seen at the Central for some time,
and the piece is sure to play to packed
houses during the week.

The Walcott-Carter fight, which takes
place on thr- :5th of thic month before the

attention. The fact that Carter has al
ready defeated Waleott. coupled with the
fact that the Barbadoes champion subse
quently outciassfd George Gardner, who
knocked out Carter in their recent battle;
ndds an atmoFpii^re of uncertainty to the
outcome of the battle, which is causing
Dfht forecaster? to scratch their heads.
Waleott is training for the fray at Friz
zie's place in I^trk^pur. and Carter is do
ing his preparatory work at Ed Wilson's
ranch, near Bolinas. Carter has rested up
a hi: since his bout with Gardner, and his

where the Chinese congregate and were
instructed to search every suspicious
looking Mongolian.
It Is known now that Ket was shot be
cause be beat Sing Tom, an actor, in Ross
alley Saturday morning. The Chinese
have a distinct aversion for theatrical
people. They consider them ofthe lowest
in the scale of society. Yee Ket shared
this contempt, and when he met the
Thespian he pummeled him and left him
unconscious In the alley.
As a result of the shooting of "Yee Ket
in Spofford alley Saturday night the tong
to which the victim belongs has declared
war on the Suey Dun Tong, and* a high

"Too Much Johnson,"- the comedy pre
sented at the Alcazar Theater last night,
should be styled "a cure for the blues."
The cozy" little theater was crowded and
people laughed to their hearts' content
from the rise to the fall of the curtain.
Every member of the company seemed
admirably suited to his or her part, and
the result was a clear-cut and artistic
performance. Every ludicrous point and
situation was thoroughly grasped by the
audience- and the merriment was sponta
neous and irresistible. M. L. Alsop, the
new leading man. made the most that
could bÂ« got out of the part of Mr. Augus
tus Billings, the man of the magnificent
nerve and resource, and he seemed to
revel in the part. He showed that In
light comedy* he is quite at home. George
AVebster as Joseph Johnson, Howard
Scott as Mons. Leon Dathis and Frank
Bacon as Francis Faddish helped mate
rially to keep up the fun. and each did
a clever piece of character work. Paul
Gerson, Carlyle Moore and Barton Hill
had congenial parts. Miss Alberta Con
verse was Mrs. Augustus Billings, and she
interpreted the part in a quiet, ladylike
manner that charmed the audience. Miss
Marie Howe Was in her element as the
mother-in-law, and Miss Carrie Lamont
was fetching as Leonora Faddish. Every
thing went with a swing and the curtain
had to be raised several times after the
close of each act.

Hirschfelder Â£z Mcaney's trunk factory,
at the corner of Twentieth and Florida
streets, was partlv destroyed by fire last
night. The damage was confined to the
main factory building, the box factory
and boiler buSHings in the rear escaping
without injury. For a time the whole
neighborhood was threatened, but the
firemen confined the flames to the main
building.
At 5 o'clock business was suspended for
the day and George E. "White, the watch
man, took change of the building. Later
Max Manheim. the foreman, and two as
sistants returned to pack some trunks.
While they were busy some -women In the
neighborhood notified them that smoke
was coming out ct the roof, and an alarm
was rung in. The fire was a blind one
and burned for some time before it broke
through the roof. The Inside then was
thoroughly ablaze. The firemen succeeded
in confining it to the building in which it
originated.
The entire plant is valued by the owners
at $100,009. on which they carry between
$?6.000 and $48,000 insurance. About 125
men. women and girls were employed in
?he factory. It was formerly owned by
D. Block & Co. According to Lewis J.
lleaney, one of the firm, the stock was
valued at $75,000. Fire Marshal Towe
says that considerably less than $5000 will
rover the damage to the building, and
â¢hat probably VJO.OOO would be a fair esti
mate of the vaiue of the contents. The
turned building was erected about seven
yÂ«Rars ago. Spontaneous combustion in
waste thrown iÂ»bout the elevator shaft is
said to have beer, the cause of the fire.

A pathetic scene was witnessed in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday when Mrs. Jo
hanna Brahm, 10 Vallejo street, appeared
to answer the charge of cruelty to chil
dren. It was alleged that while under the
influence of liquor Sunday she tried to
cut her baby's head off with an ax, but
was prevented by Mrs. Cloyde, a colored
woman. Mrs. Brahm testified that she
had the ax raised to strike the colored
woman for Interfering in her domestic af
fairs. Her little son with tears in his
eyes pleaded with the court to be merci
ful to his mother, and the Judge was. so
affected that he decided to dismiss the
case and give the mother another chance.

The piece was well dressed and mounted
and the singers, assisted by Steindorff

tion of the work. Montanari has not been
so well heard before this season as she
was in the role of Amelia. Her voice was
clear, ringing and intensely dramatic, and
her acting convincing.
Agostini as Ricardo scored as heavily
as he did last week in "Cavalleria." One

Renato's song in the first act by Ferrari
was one of the treats of the evening, and
in fact, his barytone was effective
throughout. Repetto was in fine voice,
and made a dainty figure as the page.
Nicolini and Zani as the two conspira
tors were strong, and Pollettini's singing
of Ulrica was a well studied effort. The

its concentrated work, and the orchestra

fore the 11 o'clock service began \u25a0 Tip
Chadwell went to the spring, fitty yams
from the church. Rush Morgan was at
the spring and began firing at Chadwell.
Both factions immediately gathered, and
the fight lasted half an hour.
Sheriff Jones Brook attempted to arrest
Asa Chadwell, who resisted. Both Brook
and Asa Chadwell are wounded.
The feud between the Morgans and
Chadwells has existed a long time. Last
Christmas they met at Walnut Hills. Va.,
where a pitched battle ensued, in which
several were killed. â¢
Eighteen mpnths ago they met near the
Hancock line. Fighting followed, and one
was killed. Both the Chadwells and Mor
gans are prosperous and influential. They
have large families and all their members
are fearless.
MIDDLESBORO, Ky., Oct. 7.â A report
reached here to-night by way of Taze
well, Tenn., that a second clash between
the Chadwell and Morgan factions had
occurred late this afternoon, but the story
is unconfirmed. At noon, when a horse
man arrived here from Ewinpr. Va.. five
miles from Big Springs, no more trouble
had occurred, although the feeling was at
tension. Both factions were barricaded in
their homes and were armed to the teeth.
Many believe that they are waiting for
darkness to renew the trouble. Two mem
bers of each faction came to Cumberland
Gap to-day and secured a large supply of
ammunition. * Â»
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 7.â In a
bloody fight at the Union Baptist Church
at "Big Springs, ,ten miles from Tazewell,
Tenn., yesterday, four men were killed,
two mortally wounded and three wounded
less sferiously.
The killed:
TIP AND JOHN F. CHADWELL.
. RUSH AND HENRY MORGAN.
Mortally woundedâ John Morgan and
Asa Chadwell.
Wounded â Jones, leg broken;
Noble, llesh wound; Sheriff Brook, slight.
"Yes; prior to the shooting (May 26, I
think it was) I was called to his house
and found him sulterlng from delirium
tremens. I did not treat him then, but
later in the day gave him something to
quiet his nerves. When I returned a day
or two afterward he had recovered some
what from his delirium, but still talked
incoherently, He complained of pains in
the back of his head and between inter
vals of barking and yelling he would say.
'For God's sane, doctor, stop that pain
in the back of my head.' After a few
days he got over his Illusions about little
devils and became convalescent. I didn't
see him again until the Saturday before
the shooting."
"Describe what occurred on the Satur
day before the shooting."
"I should say his conduct was about tha
same as before, though the symptoms of
acute delirium had passed off somewhat.
I would say that he was then just deli
riously drunk. His language was Inco
herent, his eyes twitched and he had a
peculiar bark like a young dog."
"Did you have any conversation with
him then?"
"Yes; he talked a great deal. His pe
culiar lay was literature, of which he
thought he was a great critic. He thought
himself the peer of any living author â he
thought himself supreme as a litterateur.
He uteri to rail about what he called the
fallacies of 'The Christian,' By Hall
Caine. I was surprised that he considered
himself so capable."
Believes Adams Was Insane.
"From your observations of Mr. Adams
state whether you think he was sane or
insane at the time of the shooting of Dr.
Jessup."
"In my opinion he was decidedly la
sane."
After getting Dr. Rowell's opinion upon
Adams' sanity at the time of the shoot
ing, the attorneys for the defense brought
out from the witness that Dr. Jessup had
on several occasions made threats against
the person of Adams. This testimony the
prosecution was unable to break down on
cross-examination.
"Did you know Dr. Jessup well?" was
asked Dr. Rowell.
"Yes, I knew him quite well."
"Did you â¢ ever have any conversation
with him in regard to Adams?"
"Yes."
"What was it?"
"Dr. Jessup said to me on the Sunday
before the shooting, while we were valk
ing from my office. 'This man has not any
gun; I'll go to his room and beat his
head off. The man's a bully, and
I mean to beat hla head off.' "
"What occurred before this conversa
tion you speak . of that should have led
Dr. Jessup to say those words?" asked
Deputy District Attorney Samuels on
cross-examination.
"Well. Dr. Jessup came running: out to
my buggy In the street one day and
said to me, 'You're the Health Officer of
this town, and If you don't do something
to settle this thing I'll settle it myself.
He's got to stop his abuse.' I toM him It
was not my prerogative to restrain In
sane or drunken people, but that I would
do everything I could to assist Adams"
family. Later when I saw him I told him
I would see District Attornev Allen and
take steps to have Adams confined. It
was then he said that Adams had no pis
tol. I then warned him to be careful, as
It was dangerous to interfere with an in
sane man."
"Did Adams ever say anything to you
about his drinking habits?"
"Yes; he said that he would quit drink
ing but for the pains in his head. He re
garded that necessity forcer! him to drinx
in order to relieve his pain."
Miss Agnes S. Adams .was on the wit
ness stand all morning and until late
this afternoon undergoing cross-examina
tion at the hands of the District Attorney.
The prosecution was unable to shake her
testimony, and nothing of interest was
brought out. When she left the stand
her father limped from his chair and ca
ressed her just before she resumed her
seat beside him. _^ f
Dr. H. M. Rowell. Health Officer of
Berkeley, was an important witness to
day in the Adam3 murder case. Dr. Row
ell not only asserted his belief that Ad
ams was. insane at the time of the shoot
ins, but bore out the theory of the de
fense that Adams shot Dr. Jessup In self
defense. He had warned Jessup that Ad
ams was insane and dangerous.
"Were you ever called . to attend Mr.
Adams professionally?" was asked of Dr.
Rowell.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 7.
This is Joseph Haworth's last week
here, and he has given us his best in
Hamlet. His distinguishing virtues find
in the role their highest exercise. Ham
let in his hands is a noble Dane, indeed.
The lines are given with marked beauty
of cadence and measure, the gestures are
sensitive and Impassioned and \u25a0 pictur
esque, and Mr. Ha worth has the happi
ness to look the sable-suited Hamlet most
admirably. A thought too virile" for the
lovable dreamer the conception is at
times, perhaps, but the emotional empha
sis is mostly subject to the nicest judg
ment and a finely truthful instinct. All
the poetry Is to be found in his reading,
too, the soliloquies in particular being
given with much grace, \u25a0 and altogether
for Mr. Haworth's work alone this "Ham
let" of the week is well worth seeing.
Perhaps Polonius, done by Hal de For
rest, was the next best thing in the cast
after. Hamlet. Mr. de Forrest painted a
passing good portrait of the garrulous
lord chamberlain and" fell admirably into
the picture. Mr. Mayall is not so well
cast this week as Laertes as- he was last
as Bassanio. It is a thin, unwilling Laer
tes, lacking life except in spots. Mr.
Mayall makes a better lover than brother.
Claudius is sleepily handled by Charles
Smiley, who takes his troublous concerns
o'er lightly. H. D. Byers and Aimar Ac
ton do good work with the first and sec
ond grave diggers' parts, and the ghost
act went off without disaster and with
the real thrill.
Miss Adele Belgarde, the clever Portia
of last week, .has neither the physique
nor accent for the distraught Ophelia,
though in the mad scene she was force
ful and even graceful, but it is "Oh, Wil
low, waly!" when she sings! Agnes
Maynard showoc. some power in the part
of the Queen of Denmark. The play is
effectively staged, will go more smoothly
to-night than last night and should ce*
tainly be seen.
There is a "Hamlet", down at the Grand
Opera-house this week that is well worth
seeing. It is "Hamlet"- with a Hamlet
that will live in worthy memory and a
performance that is througnout manced
oy atmosphere ana dignity, if not always
distinction. There were no disasters in
the cast, and the noble spirit of the play
teems to have lifted the players to their
highest level. â¢ t
The two men eventually regained con
fidence In each other. Mr. Delmas re
leased the fjri.Â«p of his pistol and they
parted.
"Excuse me. lut this is no place to dis
cuss this matter." said Mr. Delmas. as
quietly as if he were simply talking on an
ordinary legal topic. "Don't you see we
will disturb the grucsts? Let us step out
side." he faid. with a wave of the hand
that was not encaged in grasping his pis
tol.
Gasson followed him outside to the cor
ridor.
"You can't draw any quicker than I
can. Delmas." he shouted.
Mr. Dtlmas i-till retained a cool de
meanor.
"Gasson. you are talking like a child,"
ho said.
The exclusive and subdued atmosphere
of the Palace yrlll was broken yesterday
iufternoon about 2 o'clock. D. M. Delmas.
the prominent attorney, and Colonel A.
Q. Gasson, the San Diego mining man and
politician, became involved in a heated
debate. The discussion became so tropi
cal that Mr. Delmas passed the lie to
Gasson, wlvch was resented. Mr. Del
mas, fearing that Gasson intended to as
sault him. reached in his hip pocket for
his revolver. Matters cooled down at this
clima* and the belligerents separated
after a few moments' more conversation.
The quarrel started over Mr. Delmas'
interests in the Golden Cross mine, lo
cated in San Diego Countv. The mine is
owned by the Golden Cross Mining Com
pany, ot which the Messrs. Hedges are
the principal owners. In is*7 this company
pave an option to the Free Gold Com
pany, which is composed of Colonel
rrumbo, Charles M. Shortridge and Jeff
Chandler, by -which, should the Free Gold
Company sell the mine, the Golden Cross
Mining: company was to receive one mil
lion dollars.
Mr. Delmas had an interest in both
the?e companies last spring. Colonel
Gasson called on Mr. Delmas in his office
one day and asked, him to put a
price on his interests, as both com
panies were desirous of selling their prop
erty. Mr. Delmas decided what his In
terests were worth, and so informed Gas
son.
afternoon Mr. Delmas met
Colonel Gasson as he was passing out of
the Palace grill after luncn. Gasson
stopped Mr. Delmas and began discuss
ing everyday topics. The conversation
eventually drifted to the subject of the
mine and Gasson said that Colonel Trum
bo, who was no longer receiver of the
mine, had not yet settled his accounts.
Gasson then accused Mr. Delmas of hav
ing made a demand for his money
whether the mine was sola or not. This
Mr. Delmas stoutly denied. He said that
he had not asked for the sum and would
not until the mine was sold. Gasson be
came more pereistant and Mr. Delmas
finally said that Gasson was a liar.
This aroused the Colonel's ire and he
dramatically began to square off for a
fistic bout. Mr. Delmas is a much smaller
man than Gasson and, like the well
known Southern attorney, the late Col
onel Calhoun Benham. who said "that a
pistol was the little instrument that ad
justed the matters between the little man
and a big man, and prevented the little
man from being kicked." he promptly
made a reach for his revolver in bis back
pocket.
The lecture was preceded by songs by
the Young Men's Christian Association
Quartet, specialties by William Hines and
a piano solo by Miss Katharine Madden.
Where that prevails their schools, are better
than where they have political jobbers or
where they put in the impoverished widows or
the impoverished daughters of widows simply
because they need the money. I have no sym
pathy with the feeling that charges too much
education. If every man and woman had a
college education and a professional training
there would always be plenty for him to do in
that line. I believe it should be part of our
education to teach loyalty, just as we should
be taught* respect for law and order. Every
educated man is law-abiding and loyal.
An uneducated man does not 'know what is'
going on or what the various movements In
the world signify. The educated man is brought
in contact with reality. The educated man
knows how to do things; to select, some few
things and learn how to do them well. It Is
the business of higher education to teach wis
dom and virtue and skill. Wisdom is know
ing what you ought to do next; virtue is Just
doing it, and skill is the ability to do it In
the best possible way. Education teaches these
things, gives wisdom, virtue and skill. "For
a man to have died who might have been wise
and was not," says Carlisle, "this I call a
tragedy." To go through life uneducated Is a
tragedy. I V -
The man who Is ignorant in the community
Is so much dead weight. If he can do some
thing pretty well he is, so far as that skill
goes, an educated man. The absolutely un
skilled laborer has no place in the communltj.
The whole community is interested in having
every child brought to some sort of skill, and
every child, rich or poor, ought to be some
kind of a laborer. There should be no place
in the community for any man or woman hav
ing nothing to do.
A voung man should so conduct himself from
day "to day that his future self shall have no
remorse. .. We should live so that our futura
selves can have nothing to reproach us with;
that is, keep clean and know the truth and
know the thing that needs doing. Keep your
body clean from drink, from any drug, from
vice, so that the older man will have a good
sound body to work with. Keep the nervous
system clean; the mind clean from poor jokes,
cheap music, cheap things of any kind. Treat
yourselves as a delicate child that you would
keep away from bad things.
Keep the soul clean from vice, from envy,
from impure thoughts, from anger. Keep from
misery. You have no right to be miserable
and gloomy. Know the truth. Knowledge
gives a man a higher class of pleasure. Do
the things that need doing. The educated man
is In some degree an antidote to the saloon.
In Germany every teacher- is, thoroughly
trained. -
Professor David Starr Jordan lectured
last evening at the auditorium of the
Young Men's Christian Association on the
"Importance of Educated Young Man
hoou." Mr. Jordan said in part:
The particular kind of truth that X am to
set forth to-night is that it is an advantage
to the community to have the men in the com
munity educated. There are a great many
reasons why a young man should educate him
self. He is worth a good deal more to him
self; the whole of your life must be spent in
your own company, and only the educated man
Is good company. If you have missed oppor
tunities in the past make up for lost time by
getting your education in the very, best way.
To educate yourself ' is to give yourself a
broader horizon so that you can better look
at the affairs of man.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
B&RES AND
Sores and Ulcers never become chronic
unless the blood is in poor condition â is
sluggish, weak and -unable to threw off
the poisons that accumulate in it. The
system must be relieved of the unhealthy
matter through the sore, and great danger
to life would follov/ should it heal before
the blood has been made pure and healthy
and all impurities eliminated from the sys-
tem. S.S.S. begins the cure by first cleans-
ing and invigorating the blood, building
up the general health and removing from
the -system A QQKSTAH? DRAIN
SSI OPOH ?HE SYSTEM.
When this has been accomplished the dis-
charge gradually ceases, and the sore or
ulcer heals. It is the tendency of these old
indolent sores to grow worse and worse,
and eventually to destroy the bones. Local
applications, while soothing and to some
extent alleviate p=in, cannot reach the seat
of the trouble. S. S. S. does, and no matter
how apparently hopeless your condition,
even tliough your constitution has broken
down, it will bring relief when nothing
else can. It supplies the rich, pure blood
necessary to heal the sore and nourish
the debilitated, diseased body.
\u25a0 Mr. J. E. Talbcrt, I,oc!c Cox 245,Winoaa, Mis*.,
says: , "Six years ago iny leg from the knee to
the foot V7C3 one solid sore. Several physicians
treated r.s and I made two trips to Hot Springs,
but found no relief. I vras induced to try S. S. S ,
and it made a complete cure. I have been a per-
fectly well man ever since."

Soon after 6 o'clock he breathed his last.
Young Seggau lived . at 62S Broadway
and worked as an expressman -with his
father. -
After the operation the patient regained
consciousness and some hope was ex
pressed for his recovery despite the fact
that the fracture was an . extended one.
The ambulance was telephoned for 'and
the injured boy was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital. An examination
showed that the youth had received a
fractured skull and a fracture of the
nose. The case necessitated an operation
and Drs. Bunnell and Von der Lieth tre
phined the skull to remove the pressure
on the brain.
Fred Seggau, a sixteen-year-old bicyr

noon, the result of a collision, -with a

Near the corner of -Fulton and Steiner
streets it is claimed he started to coast
down the hill toward Fillmore street.
As he neared that thoroughfare a north
bound car was passing and the boy tried
to clear it. His wheel -had attained such
momentum that before : the young rider
could regain control or even turn it he
ran head on into the- car. The force
of the collision threw young Seggau

Mr. Mihran was the first to introduce
Oriental rugs on this coast. He Is the old
est dealer in the city and. being a most
experienced collector and closest buyer,
has been able to secure these rugs at such
nominal prices that he can well afford to
conduct an unreserved sale to reach his
aim.
Mr. Mihran was good as his word when,
before leaving on his collecting, he said
he would bring the largest and most val
uable collection to make San Francisco
the rug-buying center of the West. To
da so he will offer this stupendous collec
tion at most legitimate auction sale and
sell the rugs at so great bargains as to
attract the public and the trade.
ICext Friday San Francisco will witness
the most extensive exhibit of Oriental
rugs, when Mr. M. B. Mihran will throw
open to the public his new art rooms at
332 Post street, near Powell, under the
Savoy Hotel, where the public will see
3000 of the most select Persian rugs ever
exposed to public criticism.
Rugs of great value, of remarkable dis
tinction, of royal texture, silk rugs, silk
carpets, silk serpents, silk klrmans, tab
rizes, and also many from such districts
\u25a0which were for the first time robbed of
their treasuresâ as from Meshed, On

The members of the Metal Trades As
sociation are exceedingly active. At
their meeting last week a resolution was
adopted pledging all members of the as

solved to continue the fight against nine
hours with firmer resolution than ever.
The arrival of machinists from the East
in increasing numbers has "been a source
of great encouragement to the ironrnen,
and it is quite likely that there will be
little wavering in their disposition to
light the strikers to the bitter end.
The teamsters who are returning to
their trucks express themselves as satis
fied with the terms of the settlement of
the strike. They declare that the non
union drivers are giving up their jobs
gradually, and that in a few weeks none
of them will be handling reins. That
there is some truth in this is evidenced
by the fact that many of the non-union
teamsters who collected their bonuses
from the Draymen's Association yester
day announced their intention to leave
the ! city . or seek some other avenue of
employment. It is estimated that over
125 non-union teamsters are still at work,
but how long they will continue to face
the hostility of the union teamsters re
mains to be seen.
While the strike of the machinists is
stlll'on, there are signs of disintegration
among tho strikers, and the members of
the metal trades express the belief that
the dispute will ere long be settled. The
various iron, works, notably the Union
and Risdon, are making daily additions
to their forces. During the past week
the Union Iron Works gave employment
to nearly one hundred new men, some of
that number being union machinists who
went on strike in May last. The num
ber of new men admitted to the works
yesterday was twenty-seven, and of these
two were union maphinists. The Risdon
force was increased on Saturday and
yesterday by twenty men. All of these
are new arrivals from the East. It is
reported that other iron institutions have
made corresponding gains during the past
few days.

APPEAL COITRT MEET9
JOHNSON" SIDES GETS PASS
BACK TO HIS OLD HOME
IRONMEN ARE
MAKING GAINS
The' trials and tribulations that encom
passed the married life of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Ladewigr were heard for the sec
ond time In Judge Seawell's court yester
day. The action for divorce instituted by
the young, real estate man on account of
his wife's alleged cruelty, which grew out
of an attempt made by Mrs. Ladewig to
horsewhip him at the office of Bovee, Toy
& Sonntag, developed yesterday into an
action which afforded _ the neighbors of
the young couple an opportunity to tell
what they know of how the young couple
behsved at home.
The principal" witnesses for Mrs. Lade
wig were Mrs. Fisher and her son, who
lived next door to the Ladewigs. Tha
son testified that on several occasions he
saw Arthur Ladewig talking to ladies
near, his home, and his mother testified
| that- she heard Ladewig threaten to cut
j his wife's thi/oat. Mrs. Fisher also told
the court that when she remonstrated
with Ladewig for using such bad lan
guage he politely consigned her to the
warm regions.
The typewriter employed by the real
estate firm testified that the buggy rides
she took with Ladewig consisted of trips
from the office to her home in the rig
used by Ladewig In transacting the busi
ness of the firm.
â¢ She said she lived within a very few
blocks of the Ladewigs and that she fre
quently accepted his invitation to ride
home with him. She said she felt very
grateful to Mr. Ladewig, as he helped
her considerably with her work and saved
her from losing her position by pointing
out to her mistakes she had made. She
acmitted presenting a locket to. Ladewig,
but said she thought by doing so she
could show her appreciation of his kind
ness to her. She also told of how Mrs.
Ladewig assaulted her at the office where
she was employed and called her vile
names. The case was continued by Judge
Seawell until 10 o'clock to-day.
The , following suits for divorce were
filed yesterday: Cecelia- F. Whalen
against William J. "Whalen for failure to
provide; Alfred "W. McQueen against An
nie L. McOueen for desertion; Eva Ber
nice Wallace against Edward Wallace for
cruelty and Ella Prodgers against Charles
Prodgers for cruelty.
F.'.ora Taylor was granted a divorce
from Joseph Taylor on the ground of cru
elty yesterday and Margaret Montgomery
was freed from Samuel M. Montgomery
on the same grounds.
There is gossip in Republican circles
that Judge Edward Sweeney of Shasta,
who aspires to the Republican nomina
tion for Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court, is to be sidetracked in order
to give the right of way to W. C. Van
Fleet. There is much talk of a Perklns-
Pardee combine. It is regarded as settled
that Gage will go Into the fight for
United States Senator against Perkins as
soon as he discovers that he cannot win
a renomination for Governor. 4
The fact is noted in political circles
(hat topics relating to the gubernatorial
campaign of next year are eagerly dis
cussed. The new apportionment law de
fining the Legislative and Congressional
districts goes into effect three months
lience. The district boundaries through
out the State are generally changed, and
â¢he changes demand reorganization of
committees. Much of the preliminary
work of readjustment for the political
battle of November. 1902, must be done
by the existing State Central committees
respectively of the Republican and Dem
ocratic parties. New committees can
not be created before late in August or
early in September of next year, because
delegates to the State convention can
not be chosen under the primary election
law until the second Tuesday of August.
Many of the politicians are guessing that
a vigorous fight will be made to over
throw the law. The sharp fight for con
trol in the County Committee in the
late Republican .convention signified to
the spectators that something invisible to
the multitude was involved in the con
test.
Gubernatorial Topics.
The candidates of the labor party must
go on the ballot by petition, as tlie fol
lowers of the party did not elect dele
gates to a convention under the pro
visions of the primary election law. The
Board of Election Commissioners will
consider the petition to-day or to-mor
row. Friends of Mr. Schmitz aver that
the petition contains 32iW names, the re
quirement being 1930. The acceptance of
the petition will not give the Lnion .La
bor nominees party designation on the
ballot. Such designation is limited to
nominees of conventions called under tiie
provisions of the primary law. . The
names of the candidates, however, will
be printed on the ballot. The leader of
the labor party, believing that his fences
south of AlarKet are in good condition,
is devoting his time to political work in
the other sections of the city. '
Politicians preaict that 00,000 of \u25a0 the
75,000 registered voters will participate in
the election. Events of the next four
weeks may cause a deeper interest in
ihe contest than is now foreshadowed,
and hence a larger vote than seems prob
able at this time may be cast. The in
dorsement of candidates by the Liquor
Dealers' Association is awaited with more
ihan the usual degree of interest. The
members of the association who are au
thorized to act for the whole body will
meet, it is said, Thursday of next week.
Case of Labor Candidates.
The supporters of Asa R. Wells pro
fess the greatest confidence in his suc
cess at the polls on November 5. The ad
mirers cf Joseph S. Tobin assert that the
race will narrow down to a contest be
tween the Democratic nominee for Mayor
and Kugene E. Schmitz, the candidate of
the Union Labor party. ..
Candidates are out among their friends
and acquaintances making individual
campaigns for the favor of their fellow
citizens. Some of the nominees have es
tablished headquarters of their own,
where their friends may have a common
rallying point. In many of the leadins
saloons banners and other devices are
displayed to allure the voter. In a gen
eral sense the comment regarding the
Democratic nominations for the Board
ot Supervisors is favorable. Wagerstiave
been offered and readily accepted on
even terms that a majority of the Demo
cratic ticket would be elected.
