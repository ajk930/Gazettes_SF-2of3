would be contrary, to good discipline . for i
Captain Ward to have given the order al-
leged by Mr., Herlihy, 1 aind the flatter, as
chief engineer, Ibeing master of . his own
department,'could neither have accepted
nor obeyed it; as the rules of the Pacific
Mail' Steamship Company are posted in
the engine-rooms "of Its steamships, and
require that all the engineers shall be at
their posts of.duty when entering and
leaving port. "We will add that It is an un-
written law:"that the chief engineer, of a
steam vessel, like the steamship City of
Rio de Janeiro Â«be on, duty on leaving or
entering port. Moreover the testimony In
this case shows that on the morning of Â¦,'
the disaster Captain Ward gave an order
to call the chief engineer. \ ' r'-LC\'-
"Upon being asked what steam the
gauge registered on the morning of the
22d Mr.' Herlihy, answered: "I do not know
by;personal observation; I was not In the
engine-room -.until! the ship struck.' Tet
he testified previously^ that he had looked
into the engine-room and saw a full crew
on duty." Healso testified that on the
morning that the:steamship was entering
port^he! could distinctly hear the Lime
Point whistle arid .could plainly dlstin
guish it from the North Head whistle,
both of which were blowing at the time!
He should then have got up and attended
to his'duties." Mr.. Herlihy testified that
at full speed coming over from Yokohama
this trip theenglnes. averaged 71.6 revolu
tions per Â¦ minute,: which gave a speed of
12.24 knots-per-hour, and that at half
speed the steamer,made as high as nine
and sometimes ten knots per.hour on an
average of, sixty revolutions per l minute.
Censure of Herlihy.
"In this connection we must say that it
"P. H. ' Herlihy, chief engineer of the
steamship City of Rio de Janeiro, the only
survivor of her engine-room officers, testi
fied that he had been in the employ of the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company since
1S73, and that he was on this steamer
when she was lost on February 22 last. He
testified that there were no orders given
to bank the fires on the night of February
21, when the steamer came to an anchor,
but it was so considered. "When nskifl if
the City of Rio de Janeiro had a full head
of steam in her- boilers on the morning of
the 22d, before she started to enter, the *
harbor, Mr.- Herlihy stated that the limit
was 160 pounds, but they had 145. pounds,
and that, although he did not see it,' he
knew It was there, as that was his order
and what they generally had at anchor
age. We must here remark that there
should have been between 155 â¢ and 160
pounds pressure on this occasion before
entering port, but there is no one living
who actually knows what the steam
gauge then registered, Mr. Herlihy, chief I
engineer, the one who should know, hav
ing been absent from his post of duty,
and Mr. Brady, the engineer on watch,
having been drowned.
"Mr. Herlihy further testified that he.
was not called on the morning of the 22d,
but was awakened by the' engines being
moved, and that he got up and looked in
the engine-room, saw a full crew and then
returned to his room and remained there
until the ship struck, and his reason for
so doing, he stated, was that the assistant
engineers were competent men.
"When asked what were his duties as
chief engineer, Mr. Herlihy replied that
they were to supervise everything In his
department: but he 'testified that he did
not supervise anything on the morning of
the 22d,: and he further stated that Cap
tain Ward came to his room on the night
of the 21st and said to him: 'Mr. Herlihy,
I will give my Instructions to the engine-'
room without' calling you.' .

Moulton at the Theater.
On Thursday night Moulton occupied a
box at the Broadway Theater, purchasing
elx tickets, only one of which he used.
His actions at the theater attracted at
tention both in the audience and on the
stage.
After leaving the theater Moulton was
seen to take a number of drinks in near-
fatuation and jealousy, either for Miss
Buckley or for Miss Jennie Seligman. of
the eame company, and that he mistook
Miss Buckley for Miss Sellgman when he

"The evidence given by Mr. Herlihy, chief
engineer of the steamship City of Rio da
Janeiro, is conclusive that he was Inatten
tive to the duties of his position on the
morning of February. 22 last, and for such
neglect of duty on his part we have thU

"Had Mr. Herlihy been at his post
and fully dressed, as lie should have
been on this occasion, it is reasonable
to suppose that he would have heard
the signal -which -was given from the
bridge ' to'/'xnan the boats. He coul'l
then have called the officers and the
balance of the crew in his department
to the upper deck to their boat sta
tions, which action, we believe, would
have resulted in saving more lives.
"He said he was the only offender; he
did not get anv orders to man the boats.
and said that that accounted for the rea
son that so many of those men went
down. .'Â¦'â¢'.-:Â¦

"When the ship struck he ran down into
the engine-room, the engines were stopped
and. the. water, was -coming through tha
alleyway to the platform, but he had all
the injections closed, the bilge pumps put
on the biiges and then gave orders to the
men on watch to leave the engine-room.
When asked If he ordered his men to
stand by the boats he said he had received
no orders to do so, but would not swear
that the signal was not given. He left all
the men in his department at the donkey
boiler, on the main deck, to await orders,
and then went to his room to dress him
self, notwithstanding that during all this
time the lights had all gone out, and four
minutes after he entered his room the
ship sank." When asked if It was not his
place to order the men to stand by the
boats when nothing more could be done
with the pumps, he said that that was
the custom. He testified that the chief
engineer was supposed to be at his post
and to order and see his men at their sta
tions when leaving or entering port, but
on this occasion the men were not called.
ENGIIs-EER OF THE RIO ANT> PI
LOT CENSURED BY THE UNITED
STATES INSPECTORS.
THE first official decision fixing re
sponsibility for the wreck of the
Rio de Janeiro and the fearful loss
of' life attendant thereon was
handed down yesterday by Cap
tains O. F.I Bolles and John K. . Bulger,
United States Inspectors , of Hulls and
Boilers. This ; decision places the blame
for the -wreck upon the late Captain
"Ward and Pilot Jordan. The pilot, being a
State officer, Is not under the Jurisdiction
of the United States inspectors, and they
have no power to punish him. The State
Board of Pilot Commissioners, that, has
the power, la at present inquiring into
his culpability or innocence.
The inspectors blame the chief, engineer
for inattention to his duty and revoke his
license as chief engineer. He had ten
white men In his charge, consisting of
three engineers, three water tenders,
three oilers and a storekeeper, and the
Inspectors are of the 'opinion that if Chief
Engineer Herlihy had called this force on
deck to man the boats many more lives
would have been saved.
The first few pages of thj decision deal
with the evidence in a condensed his
torical way. and after this come the opin
ion and findings of the inspectors, as fol
low: ;.':Â¦;. ;:^ AoT, . â¢
"After careful consideration of this mat
ter' we are of the Â¦. opinion that Captain
"Ward" is to blame forallowlng'the steam
ship City of Rio de Janeiro to leave her
anchorage, "as he did, on February 22.
After leaving her \ anchorage the vessel
was in charge of F. "W. -Jordan, State
pilot, who was much to blame for at
tempting ;to , bring the steamship City of
Rio de JanelVo from a safe anchorage into
the harbor* of San Francisco in a dense
fog at night,' with a strong ebb tide run
ning, the current being made stronger and
more uncertain by the freshets in the riv

"At her.last inspection; April 28, 1900.

In the reply of the anthracite president
referred to President Mitchell is advised
that the company he represents reiterates

was the opium Joint. This was swooped
down upon. ,
The place, which has beenÂ»patronlzed by
many whites, was found to be gorgeously
fitted up. There were couches, soft pil
lows, expensive rugs and- mattings and
some handsome and costly furniture. A
half dozen complete outfits for smoking
opiumâ pipes, trays, lamps, needles, pills,
etc.â were levied upon. Smith has locked
up the place, but as a strict watch is now
kept on Chinatown and times are dull

obliged to keep the outfit.

Â«aya your ton \rlll identify him. Bend your
sat en next train. Answer quick.
J. H. JOHNSON, 'Sheriff.
When told that the Omaha police dis
credited Henderson's' complicity in the
Cudahy kidnaping. Sheriff Johnson said:
I know he is the right man. His confession
tu me is a email item, only part of the evi
dence I possess. If I had turned Henderson
Icuse at any time since his arrest early in \
February I am satisfied offlcers from Omaha
vr.ulii have grabbed him up and hurried him
there. Mr. Cudahy will naturally listen much
t j the officers of his own town, but he should
not be opposed to listening to others.
Sheriff Johnson tried to induce Hender
son to make a statement for the press.
Henderson refused, saying:
"I will not talk to newspaper men until
after Eddie Cudahy comes and talks to â¢
me. When I have had a talk with the
boy I will then be willing to make a state
ment for publication."
Sheriff Johnson says among the state
ments made to him by Henderson was one
to the effect that Pat Crowe had no hand
in the kidnaping; that the chief partici
pant in the kidnaping of young Cudahy Is
a member of one of the prominent families 1
of Omaha who escaped from prison, !
where he was serving a fifteen years' sen
tence for robbery, several years ago.
OMAHA, March 22.â Chief of Police
Donahue was shown the dispatch from
Dallas, stating that the Sheriff there had
appealed to Mr. Cudahy to send his son
to Dallas to identify the man Henderson,
under sentence for a crime in that city.
The Chief said the telegram had been
referred to him by Air. Cudahy. He said
Mr. Cudahy would not send his son, and
that he (the Chief) would have nothing
whatever to do with the case. When Hen
derson was arrested his photograph was
sent to Chief Donahue, who showed it to
all the persons who had seen the abduc
tors and none of them could identify him.
The Chief of Police says there is absolute
ly no evidence to connect Henderson with
the case, and he will not act on Hender
son's copfession at all.

HIS FALSEHOODS
One of Bullock's sisters, Lady Gooch.
was presented the last drawing room held
by the late Queen Victoria. All his broth
ers are famed in the commercial and
financial world of the metropolis of ;ho
British empire and in more tjian one aris
tocratic household his death will be
mourned. A dozen of his old friends here
followed the humble coffin to Its resting
place in the graveyard.
NANAIMO, B. C, March 22.â Arthur
Bullock, formerly interested in a bank in
Los Angeles, who was found dead on his
knees beside his bed In his room In tha
Victoria Crescent' herÂ© several days agro,
was one of the pioneers of British Colum
bia and had attained his sixty-fifth year.
He was quietly buried here to-day.
Arthur Bullock was a member of a well
known and wealthy family of Sydenham,
London, and in the course of his wander
ings had amassed no fewer than four for
tunes, one of them, a very largre one. j His
passion for social enjoyment helped him
to go through them all and die a compara
tively poor man. He came to this prov
ince thirty years ago and went into the
trading business at New "Westminster, on
the Fraser River. Here he did very well,
selling his interest- in* the business for a
large sum. He then went to Victoria
and there made a fortune. Prom his first
appearance in the province he was noted
as a lavish entertainer, a man who would
give a dance, a card party or a symposium
of choice spirits on the {.lightest provoca
tion /and spend money recklessly to make
his guests happy. From Victoria he came
to Nanaimo and opened the first really
big: business house then *n existence north
of Victoria in the dry goods line. He made
money "hand over fist," as the sayingr is,
and at the end of a few years sold out
and revisited his aristocratic relatives in
England, spending there a year or two.
He went into the banking: business in
Los Angeles and lived there In princely
style, entertaining like a lord. He had* a
beautiful place and his social functions
were famed throughout that part of the
State. From Los Angeles he went to
Mexico on learning that there was a good
opening In the silver mining industry in
that country. This venture also prospered
in his hands. Kverythmg he touched
seemed to turn to gold, though his friends
knew well that behind all the seeming
good fortune there was a brain of rate
shrewdness, which, on matters of busi
ness, was ~ seldom deceived.
After carrying the Mexican venture to
a successful issue he returned to the north
and plunged heavily In real estate specu
lation. It was here that the tide of his
fortune turned and up to the time of his
death he had not recovered from several
Indiscreet ."buys" Into which he had been
led. He was the holder of an enormous
amount of real estate in North Vancouver
City and this, with an unlucky invest
ment here brought him Into shoal water.
Bullock was never married, but, like a
good many other old bachelors, he pos
sessed charming: manners that won tho
favor of the fair sex. He was well bred
and of more than ordinary accomplish
ments and reading and he had been all
over the world.

"Great excitement prevails in Japan,"
he said, "over Riissla's efforts to strength

LORD CRANBORNE IN ERROR
At this moment. Mr. Takaharl. the Jap
anese Minister, is not prepared to discuss
the action of his Government, but another
diplomat, who is equally well informed
regarding affairs In Japan, thinks the sit
uation more serious than is generally be
lieved.
Goodnow's suggestion will not be adopted
by the President, as he has no Intention
of forcibly Interfering In China, but It Is
learned to-day that Japan contemplates
making vigorous opposition to the ratifi
cation of the Manchurlan convention. To
meet the objection of the powers, Russia
modified the treaty in several Important
particulars. But, even as modified, the
convention is not satisfactory to Japan,
nor is It acceptable, as shown by the ex
change of cotes that has occurred be
tween Toklo and other governments, to
any of the nations approached.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, March 22.â In un
mistakable terms Japan has given notice
to the powers of her strong objection to
the treaty regarding Manchuria, which
Russia desires China to sign. Mr. Good
now, United States Consul General at
Shanghai, cabled Secretary Hay to-day
that the proposed treaty had again been
submitted to the Chinese Emperor, and
Russia had demanded Its signature. He
added the suggestion that the United
States Join with Japan and Great Britain
to protect the Chinese Government.
This Action Causes the Situation to Again Become Serious and

Robert H. Paul, for Years a Terror to
Desperadoes in California and Ari
zona, Nearing the End of His Career
VANCOUVER. B. C, March 22.â Dr.
Niewenhuis, a Dutch explorer, has Just
arrived at Sydney, Australia, after spend
ing nearly three years among the natives
in the wilds of Borneo. 'according to mail
advices received here to-day. During all
this time he never saw the face of a
white man and his adventures among tho
mountain tribes are of deep interest.
For a year Dr. Niewenhuis lived in a
hitherto unexplored I territory. 'His hosts
were giants, whose' average height was
seven feet and some of them wera even
eight feet in stature. Here is the explor
er's story:
"After completing explorations in Ma
kakkam, Australia, In 1897, I determined
to go to the East Indian Islands, and
there ever Blnce I have been among the
natives. I left Batavia early In 189S and
went around the coast for 3U0 miles in a
small trading steamer. I was put ashore
alone and the captain said I would cer
tainly be eaten by cannibals and would
never come out again. I went up Arch
Valley from the coast and fcr 100 miles
into the interior the natives were decided
ly unfriendly. They would not oome out
and. try to light, for they were too indo
lent and easy-going; but I could not buy
anything of value in exchange for the
trinkets that I brought along. Away up
in the interior the natives had never
heard of the outside world and had not
been flred at by the launches of British
gunboats, so they were decidedly more
lriendly.
"None of these natives were cannibals,
but they preferred raw flesh to cooked
meat. The women" were much larger
and of stronger build than the men anJ
they did all of the lighting and most of
the hunting. Â« In fact there were several
tribes of perfect Amazons. I was offered
scores of wives, but contented myself
with only one. The natives had few
bows and arrows, using big lances and
shields mostly in their rights.
"When 200' miles from the coast, right
In the heart of the mountains, I found a
tribe of the largest men. I -ever saw In a
good many years' travel in the Far East.
Tho men were twice as heavy as ordinary
Europeans, being built on very muscular
proportions and used to mountain climb
ing. The women are shorter, but they
look tall by reason of a tremendous head
dress. This is knotted from the foreheaJ
and sometimes reaches more than a foot
high.
"These natives are undoubtedly canni
bals, besides being great drunkards. Their
feasts last for weeks at a time and sacri
fices of human beings are made to the
gods representing the various animals
that the natives hope to kill In the
mountains. The women of the tribe lose
their rights as -wives if they bear more
than three children. It is supposed that
more than this number causes depletion
of the physical standard. Their houses
are built of wood carelessly thrown to
gether after a small amount of hewing
with stone and soft-metal axes.
"Gold Is plentiful all through the moun
tains, hut the natives know nothing of Its
use. Each of the women 'wears strings
of nugpets which would be worth several
hundreds of dollars."
Dr. Nlewenhuls Is 36 years of age and
has achieved distinction as " an explorer

No Fear of Another Rising Among
VANCOUVER &X'. March 22.-South
sea advices state that Dr. Solf, the Gov

said there was no fear of another rising
among the natives. On January 27 1500
guns were surrendered by the Mataafa
people. The two ssdes now appear to be
friendlsv although the differences among
them are still kept alive by orators, who
seem to have more power than the chiefs.
The inhabitants seemed contented with
German rule. The island has been divided
Into districts, each with its native Judge,
and each of ; the chiefs has been given
some office. .
Arrangements are being made with the
Government of Java for a supply of Ma
lay labor from the Dutch East Indies for
work on the plantations.
On the Kaiser's birthday Dr. Solf pre
sented Mato*fa with. the insignia of office
as chief of 'the natives In the usual form
of a horse tall used as a fan, with an
elaborate ebony handle Inlaid with gold,
silver and gems.
Asked if there 'was any difference be
tween the treatment of Germans and
other-whites at Apia, Dr. Solf replied:
"Absolutely none. We recognize two
classesâ foreigners, which include Ger
mans, English and Americans, and na
tives, Including Pacific Islanders; but the
same laws. govern all. and no preference
Is shown to any race."

from San Lucas of the. suicide of one of
the oldest and best known vaqueros in

I,ux for more than thirty years, working
on their Monterey County ranches. He
had a wide reputation as a skillful
vaquero and was one of the most trusted
znr-n on the ranee.

At a meeting of the board of directors
of the. Union Coursing: Park Association
early in the week the major: portion of
the evening was devoted to the consider
ation of sapling stakes and problems of
breeding with a view to the development
and improvement of racing greyhound
stock. With this Idea in mind the Union
Courting Park -Association .will increase
the number of,Eapllng stakes in the -fu
ture. â
Ever since the last series of j sapling
stakes there has been a growing demand
for these events by breeders and owners.
To introduce dogs Into an â¢ all age' has
often been their .... undoing. The sapling
events of the future will- be in the nature
of preparatory training' stakes. . At â¢ the
expiration of a minute relief dogs will be
set loose and every endeavor made to
build up the strength of these youngsters
before allowing them to go against sea
soned coursers. ( ;
In connection with the open - stake of
March 30 and 31 the first : of these Bap
lings will be run. On April 6 and 7 the
regular open stakes will be the pro
gramme, hut ~ on April 13 there will be a
puppy stake, as well as the open event.
One week later the programme will be
a reserve and champion: event. .It is the
plan not to permit a; youngster to enter
more than one stake each month.

The new doubles team, composed of Ray
Cornell 2nd Grant Smith, has shown up
well so far. and with a little more prac
tice will make a strong team. Several
new men have taken, up the game on the
local courts, and for beginners their show
in?; Is surprising. These men are Fred
Schleef, Frank Hooper, Kenneth Hamil
ton, Clyde Beal and Pete Smith. Amontj
the younger players Du Val Moore is by
long odds the most promising, man. His
back court strokes are very clean cut and
effective,- but he is very weak at the net.
This fault can be overcome only by con
stant practice with better players..

The doubles try-out held at Berkeley
lest Saturday resulted In a victory for
Paul Selby and Drummond McGavin, who
will represent the University of Califor
nia in the intercollegiate doubles next
menth. Fred Brown and Baker were tho
other contestants, and considering the in
experience of both the showing they made
was very good. They won the first set
rather easily and looked to be winners,
but their opponents braced up and took
tlse next three sets and match. Brown,
whose forte Is volleying, played a remark
ably good game. Tennis Captain Hunt
has announced that players qualifying for
doubles will not be allowed to compete In
the singles try-out to be held to-day at
H*>rkolo\ This announcement is rather
surprising and haid to understand, as it
puts Drummond McGavin and Faul Selby.
Ktrkelcy's two strongest players, out of
the singles ahd thereby lessens the
ohcnws of that college. With Harry
Wiehe out of the singles, California's
Â¦cliaixts of victory were very good, but
if Hunt'R new rule goes Into effect' the
chances of the colleges will be about even.
Wlefce's determination to play In the
doubles only Is attributable to the fact
that his present physical condition would
not permit of his playing two hard
matches in one day.
Glub Tournaments En
gage Attention of
Local Tennis Players
The adjourned annual meeting of the
California Cricket Association, held last
Monday, was the most Important that has
been held for some years by that body.
It was attended not only by delegates
from two of the three local cricket clubs,
but also by Vice President J. F. Coope, II.
V. Anderson and A. G. Shaath, the two
former having Journeyed to San Fran
cisco to represent thÂ© Santa Cruz Country
Club, and also by I* W. Robltallle and O.
V. Green, as delegates of the Sacramento
Cricket Club. A somewhat determined
attempt was made on the part of one of
the delegates of the Alameda Cricket Club
to invalidate the proceedings of the meet
ing held on March 4. but It was thwarted
by the good sense of the president. For
the first time in the history of local
cricket, there will be four, and probably
five, clubs contending for the pennant dur
ing the coming season, and of this number
two will be country clubs.
Hitherto the city clubs have been too
much disposed to regard the cup or pen
nant, and any prizes presented by sup
porters of the game-, as their own ex
clusive rights, and have been unwilling to
admit the country members of the Cali
fornia Cricket Association, who pay pre
cisely the same dues, to an equal share
in the good things. But there are signs
that an era of more liberal feeling in set
ting In, though the old. narrow, illiberal
spirit sometimes shows Itself. ThÂ© first
Indication of a desire to recognize thÂ»
rights of the country cricketers came in
1899, -when each of the country clubs In the
association received a pair of leg guards.
to be presented to one of their players as
they might see fit. The schedule of 1901
will provide for a regular series 'off
matches between the city clubs and those
at Sacramento and Santa Cruz, each club
to play not fewer than two matches
against the other three or foar clubs, one
on Its own ground, and the other on its
opponent's pitch. The teams represent
ing the Sacramento and Santa Cruz club3
will play their matches on thÂ© ground at
"Webster street, Alameda, that being
equally accessible to both.
The Burns Valley Cricket Club has lr.
formally announced Its intention of stay-
Ing In the association during 1901. and
there is no doubt that the Lakeport
Cricket Club will also remain a member.
as It is the Intention of the Lake County
cricketers to visit San Francl3Co this year.
A schedule committee consisting of the
captains of last year's cricket teams waÂ»
appointed by President Brown to prepara
the programme of matches for 1901. There
is little likelihood of thje Mountain Cop
per Company Cricket Club of Keswtck
making up an eleven this year, as several
of the best players ha\-e left the service
of the company, and the club lost all its
material a year or so ago by fire.
CRICKETERS ARE ACTIVE
Jake Holtman. the starter of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club, and Dan Mills, sport
ing editor of the Philadelphia Times; have
offered j their services as umpires. The
committee in charge has Investigated the
capacities of both men and reported fa
vorably, so both will be at the timplral
post this morning at 10 o'clock, at which
hour the championship game is scheduled
to begin. ..,.,.._ ,
championship of the three corners, the
Examiner having vanquished the Chroni
cle In a fore-shortened game some few
weeks ago. More than honor and glory Is
at stake in this match. The losers will
pay for-a package presented 'to the win
ners.'
Though the Presidio course Is in splen
did condition and raanv golfers are out
on Saturdays and Sundays and a few on
other days of the week the Interest in the
scheduled competitions appears to have
dwindled. The qualifying round of the
fourth contest for the Council's cup for
men was held Saturday. March 2. eight
players qualifying, and tne first maicn
round is not yet completed. The eight
players are drawn against each other as
follows: Hugh Tevis versus Charles Page.
W. H. La Boyteaux versus H. C. Golcher.
H. C. Breeden versus Captain D. J. Rura
baugh and S. L. Abbott Jr. versus J. W.
Byrne.
On Tuesday afternoon J. "U*. Byrne bÂ«at
S. IS. Abbott Jr. 1 up alter an exceedingly
close contest. It w^ms probable that H.
C. "Golcher and J. W. Bvrne will meet in
the final round and la any event a new
ram? will appear on ihe Council's trophy.
During the week the fourth contest for
the Council's cup for women has Â¦ been
played. It has been suggested in some
quarters that there was a certain amount
of jockeying done in order to bring Mrs.
Brown end Miss Hoffman into the final
round and that Miss Houghton defaulted
to Mrs. Erown in order that the latter
might reach the final round. But Mrs.
Brown v.as in San Francisco on Wednes
day morning ready ard anxious to pla 1 '
against her opponent, whom she was
practically certain to bent, when a mes-
Fape was received from Miss Houghton'*
homo that she was too indisposed to leave
the h^use.

The chauffeurs have gained another
valuable concession recently. Hitherto it
has been necessary to empty all the gaso
line from the tanks before going on board
a ferry-boat, thus entailing some loss and
considerable inconvenience.' Now, how
ever, automobiles may be carried on ferry
boats on simply extinguishing the - : fire,
without : emptying , out the gasoline. As
matters stand at present, the transporta
tion companies may refuse, to convey the
autos, but It is no longer contrary to the
United States statutes for them to carry
autos having gasoline in their tanks. A
committee of the : Automobile Club has
been appointed â¢ to. confer with the , man
agers of the transportation companies
and procure their permission to travel by
the ferry-boats.
Automoblllsm, which for the first fifteen
months of its existence in this city made
little visible progress, has been advancing
rapidly' of late. The strong delegation of
chauffeurs ' which recently waited on the
Park Commissioners presented their case
through F. A. Hyde, who stated it clear
ly and ably. The Park Commissioners
consented to meet the owners of horseless
carriages some morning, and last Tuesday
P. P. Rockett, Dorville Llbby, A. E.
Brooke Ridley. S. D. Rogers, R. R. l'Hom
medieu and others took their autos to
Golden Gate Park. Park Commissioner
McDonald and Superintendent McLaren
were taken along the south drive to the
beach, along the Ocean boulevard and out
to Ingleside, the desire. of the chauffeurs
being to show the control possessed over
the vehicles and the slight alarm felt by
horses. The Commissioners will now
formulate rules under which permits will
be granted to the chauffeurs to use the
designated drives. This â¢ will help the
sport materially, as it will provide the
automobllists with a pleasant round trip
near at hand. The Automobile*. Club of
California will take a run over the park
route on Sunday, April 7, all members who
have received permits being requested to
make the trip. The rendezvous will be at
Golden Gate and Van Ness avenues at 11
a. m., thence to the Waller-street entrance
to the park.. thence along the south drive
to the ; boulevard, along that to Its end,
and back through the park, thence around
the Presidio reservation and home. S. D.
Rogers, president of the Automobile Club,
will be â¢ captain of the . day, with R. R.
l'Hommedieu as assistant.

the late Asa Higgins, the Petaluma
rancher, soon will be Involved in litiga
tion. Higgins died a few weeks ago, leav
ing property worth $16,000. Most of it was
bequeathed to his stepson, Brainerd
Jones. Other bequests of about $2000 each
were made to Dr. George Ivancovlch and
Mrs. Samuel Morrison of Santa Clara, the
latter a sister of the deceased.
The courts had Just opened proceedings
on the estate when to-day Samuel Morri
son arrived here and presented a claim

crued in thirty years, equals the present
value of the estate. Mrs. Morrison, as an
heir of her mother, claims part of the
borrowed money and Interest. Suit will
be: brought in a few days, as other heirs
of Higgins are unwilling to remit any
of their legacies.

WASHINGTON, March 22.â The Ne
braska Senatorial situation was consid
ered at a consultation between the Presi
dent and Senator Hanna, chairman of the
Republican National Commtttee ( to-day.
The administration is anxious that the
deadlock In the Legislature be broken in
older that the election of two Republican
Senators may be accomplished, and the
Republican National Committee has been
exerting its influence to that end; Senator
Hanna did not relish- the publication of
the telegrams which he sent to Lincoln
urging acquiescence in the will of the ma
jority and says he will send no more tele
grams to people who make them public.
He may, however, find a way of,an3wer
lng the 'telegram sent to him by the ten
bolting Republicans, which declared that
the election of D. ; E. Thompson, one of
the candidates, would be disgraceful.
The Thompson men- were not expecting
the change and their gratification was
plain. Â¦ They . cheered Senator Crounse
heartily. The prospects to-night are not
favorable to an election this week. Both
houses will be In session to-morrow.

THE sudden and startling awaken
ing from his lethargy of Jockey
Milt Henry and an unfortunate In
cident at the post In the third
event, through wkich Yellowtail
was left, were the salient features
of the sport at Tanforan yesterday.
Henry surpassed any of his previous ef
forts by reaching the wire first on five out
of six mounts, and, stranger still, all were
first choices with one exception. Astride
Contestant. Milt ran second to Huachuca,
the favorite, or he would have scored a
sweep.
There was much disappointment over
the result of the elx-furlong purse run,
which was responsible for Kenilworth and
Yellowtail coming together. Although
Harry Stover's colt was conceding a year
and thirteen pounds to Captain Hackett's
pet, he was heavily played at 6 to 6, while
there was an abundance of 8 to 5 about
YellowtalL At the post the latter ap
peared a trifle fractious, and Assistant
McKnight apparently tried to swing the
big fellow off. To be brief, when Dick
Dwyer sprung the barrier Yellowtail did
not get away, the start being badly
broken up. Kenilworth soon passed
Rosormonde, and while only swinging as
he hit the stretch was about all out to
beat Sad Sam a head in l:13}i. The opinion
was generally expressed that Yellowtail
could have turned the trick, and a match
race nearly resulted. Captain Hackett
was perfectly willing to pit his horse
against Kenilworth under the same con
ditions for $1000 a side, stipulating, how
ever, that on the day of the race the track
must be fast. Stover, apparently looking
for a "shade," hung out for "pay or play,"
knowing full well Yellowtail is no "mud
der," and negotiations fell through.
W. O'B. Macdonough's Imp. Ormonde
three-year-old Beau Ormonde made a fair
collection of sprinters In the opening five
and a half fnrlcng scramble look like sec
ond-hand platers. Henry got the aristo
cratic chestnut off in the lead and won
easing up in 1:07. Dominlck landed the 20
to 1 shot Lief Prince second In front of
the poorly handled Andrattus..
Huachuca, a bay colt by Emperor
of Norfolk, trained by Doble and Camp
bell, took the maiden two-year-old event,
starting a 2 to 1 favorite with O'Connor
up. Opposite the paddock the winner
bumped Contestant, which in turn jostled
San Lultlon, the judges, however, disal
lowing a claim of foul.
Another favorite came through In the
second scramble for maiden two-year
olds in Ogle, from Sam Hildreth's stable.
Backed down to 7 to 10. the colt assumed
the lead in the stretch and won ridden out
from Yrsula and Snooze. Dan Collins quit
the last sixteenth.
For the mile and a sixteenth selling af
fair Nansen, the favorite, was clearly out
footed by MacGyle. With only two pounds
difference in weight, Pat Dunne's gelding
was played down to 3 to 5. while 3 could
be had against the eventual winner. Hen
ry on MacGyle got away from the -barrier
well, and shaking off Nllgar beat the first
choice home more than a length. Hippo
nax lost the show by only a narrow mar
gin to Lizzella.
In the last race of the day, over seven
furlongs. Impromptu, the 8 to 5 favorite,
repeated his win of the previous day.
Cougar made a fair showing to the
stretch and there blew up. Tony Lep
ping, a 12 to 1 shot, closed well, though
unable to overhaul the first choice.
m
Track Notes.
Harry Stover, who trains Contestant,
bid up Hu&chuca from $300 to $1000. Train
er Johnny Campbell retained the colt.
At the entry clerk's office nineteen
horses were thrown out of races to be run
to-day, and seventeen of the number hap
pened to be ones that had been racing at
Oakland.
The Pacific Union handicap, over one
mile and a furlong, with a splendid field
of starters, including among them Can
more, Rolling Boer and Telamon, will be
the feature of the racing- this afternoon.

Frank . Erne, the lightweight pugilist,
was In no pleasant frame of mind last
evening. .He dropped Into town after a
day's work around Ingleslde and gave
vent to his dissatisfaction over the failure
to 'secure a match with' McGovern, or at
least an unqualified promise of a match
with the Terrible Teddy.
When Erne read what Sam Harris, Mc-
Govern's manager, had to say about
rights In California and that Teddy was
willing to fight Erne after. Oscar Gardner
was laid to rest, Erne moved his traps
from the city to Ingleslde and went, into
active training at once. But now Erne Is
disgruntled and says that as much as he
has tried he can get no satisfactory an
swer from any one who has the manage
ment of McGovern in hand, so he will
leave San Francisco for his Buffalo home
next Wednesday. *
"I am tired of waiting for a positive,
definite answer or a guarantee that Mc-
Govern will fight ; me," : said : Erne last
night. "I did consider it a fact that I was
to fight McGovern In this, city after the
Gardiner fight, but now I hardly believe
that they will match me with McGovern.
The latest talk is a match between Mc-
Govern and Kid Lavigme, a has-been, and
now I am out of it. Yes, I. will go home
on Wednesday, but if they want me with
in a reasonable time I shall return."
Erne has been at work at Ingleslde for
a week dissipating fatty tissue by com
paratively hard training. He has put on
many extra pounds since his last fight
and so decided that steady work was the
best system of training.
On Friday night, March 29, trie National
Sporting Club will hold Its second exhibi
tion. Otto Cribb, who Is training at
Blankin's, and "Dutch" ,Thurston, who is
at work at the. San , Francisco Athletic
Club, will be seen In the principal event.

THE EMPOBraM.
THE EMPORIUM.or to others with his knowledge or con
sent In this or any foreign country for
more than two years prior to his applica
tion, or an application for a patent filed
in any foreign country by himself or his
legal representatives or assigns more than
seven months prior to his application. If
any application for a patent has-been filed
in any foreign country by the applicant In
this country, or by his legal representa
tives or assigns, prior to his application
m this country, he shall state the country
or countries in which such application has
been filed, giving the date of such appli*
cation, and shall also state no application
has been filed. in any other country or
countries than those mentioned. The oath
must also state that to the best of the ap
plicant's knowledge and belief the Inven
tion has not been in public use or on sale
in the United States, nor described in any
printed publication or patent in this or
any foreign country, 'or more than two
years prior to his application in this coun-
Inf onnation foe Inventions.
An applicant may prepare and prosecute
his own application ar.d, for the purpose
of giving him as much information-as pos
sible, the Patent Office furnishes, without
charge, upon request, printed copies of the
patent laws, rules of practice and forma.
It is, however/much better for the appli
cant to employ a .patent attorney to pre
pare his application and prosecute the
same, as the value of patents depends
largely upon the skillful preparation of the
specifications and claims. From time to
time the Patent Office issues a roster of
all registered attorneys who are entitled
to represent applicants in the presenta
tion and prosecution of applications for
patents.
The statute provides for the grant of
another class of patents known as "de
sign patents." These are issued to any
person who, by his own Industry, genius,
efforts and expense, has Invented and pro
duced any new and original design for a
manufacture, bust, statue, altro-rellevo or
bas-relief; any new or original design for
the crintinc of woolen. Bilk, cotton or
other fabrics; any new or original Impres
sion, ornament, pattern, print or picture
to be printed, painted, cast or otherwise
placed on or worked into any article of
manufacture; or any new, useful and or
iginal shape or configuration of any arti
cle of manufacture, the same not having
been known or used by others before his
invention or production thereof, nor pat
ented or described in any printed publica
tion. These patents are granted, at the
election of the applicant, for three and a
half, seven or fourteen years. The Gov
ernment fees for them are respectively $10,
$15 end $S0.
Method of Issuing a Patent.
It may be of interest to follow through
the Patent Office an application until It
eventuates In a patent. As most inventors
employ attorneys, the majority of Invent
ors know very little more about the meth
ods of obtaining a patent than does the
public at large. V â¢
Whenever an application for a patent
I* received it Is examined for the purpose
of determining whether all the formal
requirements nave been complied with.
If complete in formal matters, It Is for
warded to one of the thirty-six examining
divisions where are examined Inventions
in the art to which the application un
der consideration, belongs. Each exam
ining division has at its head a princi
ral examiner, under whom are several
assistant examiners. -Each of these as
sistant examiners has one or more of the
classes or sub-classes of Inventions
which are examinable in that division.
The application Is in due courseâ at the
present time about one month after its
tiling date â taken up for examination by
the assistant, who reports the result of
his search to the principal examiner,
and, when approved by the latter, a, let
ter Is written to the applicant In the care
of his attorney advising him of the re
sult" of such examination. The attorney,
or the inventor, if he has no attorney,
makes reply to the office action, where
upon a further examination is made, and
these counter actions are continued un
til the application Is allowed in whole
or In part. If the applicant Is dissatis
fied' with the action of the examiner, an
appeal lies, upon payment of a fee of $10,
to the board of examiners-In-chlef, and
from their action a further appeal lies,
upon payment of a fee 'of $20, to the
Commissioner of Patents In person, and
from his adverse action another appeal
may be taken to the Court of Appeals of
?.he District of Columbia, the expense of
which varies according to the length of
the record. If the application is finally
allowed, the applicant is notified that
the patent will Issue at any time within
six months upon payment of the final
Government fee of $20. Upon the receipt
of that fee the specification is sent to
the Government printing office to be
printed, and the drawing to the official
contractor, to be photo-lithographed, and
when this work is completed the patent
is sealed, slsrned by the Assistant Secre
tary of the Interior and countersigned by
the Commissioner of Patents.
Other Privileges for Inventors.
Other privileges are conferred upon in
ventors by the patent statutes. If .his
original patent Is inoperative or. Invalid
by reason of a defective or insufficient
speclflcatibn or by reason of his claiming
as his invention or discovery more than
he has a right to claim as new, provided
the error ha.s arisen from inadvertence,
accident or mistake and without any
fraudulent or deceptive intention, a reis
sue is granted him, his legal representa
tives or the assignees of the entire inter
est. The Government fee for a reissue
application Is $30.
If the Inventor be a citizen of the United
States and has made a new invention or
discovery and desires further time to> ma
ture the same, on payment of a. fee of $10
he may file in the Patent Office a caveat
setting forth the . object and the dis
tinguishing characteristics of the Inven
tion, and praying protection of his right
until he shall tiave matured fcis Invention
This caveat is filed in the confidential
archives of the Patent Office, preserved
in secrecy and operating for a term of
one year, and is intended to prevent the
grant of a patent to another for the same
alleged invention upon an application filed
during the life of the caveat without no
tice being given to the caveator. The
caveat may be renewed on request in
writing from year to year on payment of
a further fee of 510 for each annual re
newal.
Single printed copies of the speciflca
tiens and drawings of patents are fur
nished to the public for B cents, and if an
order is given for all Issued patents, such
copies are furnished for 1 cent each, while
copies of all patents In a class are fur
nished for 2 cents and In a sub-class for 3
cents each.
- Getting the Benefit of the Doubt.
It lias been the Intention and the almost
continuous practice of the Patent Office
to so conduct Its affairs that invention be
oncouraged. and. with some few excep
tions, it has been the policy of the office
to give the benefit of the doubt to the in
ventor, for it is only through the Issue of
a patent that an inventor bas an oppor
tunity to demonstrate the valu* of h's
invention. C. H. I>UELL.

CHEAP LIBRARY POST.
DESPITE the indifference with which' Congress
treated the bill providing a: cheap postal rate

New England Education League continues the cam
paign of education on the subject and is making ear
nest efforts to attain success at the next session cf
Congress. To that end the league has just issued an
attractive pamphlet containing* a copy of the bill, an
explanation of its purposes, andithe principal argu
ments in its favor. It is to be hoped the efforts 'will
be successful. The measure is in the interests of the
whole people, and the cost entailed would be as noth
ing in comparison with the benefits resulting from its
adoption. . â¢
Briefly stated the object of the bill is to provide
that public libraries may circulate books through the
mails at a cost of one cent a pound, or fraction
thereof. The libraries that would be entitled to the
Lord Wolseley complains that when he became

be seen whether Lord Roberts will be. as quiet as
Wolseley was under such restrictions, or whether he
will attack the red tape intrenchrnents and take them

1~~HE old South State has not had such a jar
since the Charleston earthquake as she had when
Senator McLaurin practically joined the Re
publican party and appeared as a supporter of the
principal policies of the administration.
Throughout the South the politicians call the roll
of Senators and Representatives daily in deadly fear
that some others will escape. . McLaurin is being
duly denounced in his State, but seems confident
that much of it is being done by men who secretly
agree with him, and declares that two years hence,
when his term expires, he will carry the issue into the
primaries and will furnish the country with a surprise
that will be worth having.
The fact seems to be that McLaurin's case is merelv
the symptom of a condition that is rife throughout
the South. The whole Democratic structure in that
section is undermined. Their unavailing champion
f-hip of Bryan in twb losing campaigns -has made the
Southern -people despair of ever regaining the con
fidence of the North in a Democracy led by him.
They also despair o.f being able to shake him off.
They no longer believe in free silver, nor any of the
vagaries which he insists are principles that must be
inflexibly adhered to. and the South sees only a black
:.nd barren political future in a situation which' she
created in 1896. Therefore there exists the bold de
termination to take a new departure, support the
economic and international policies of the President
and put money in her purse.
It is notorious that the Southern members of Con
gress are on the best personal terms with the Presi
dent. Their relations ct the White House are on the
most amiable basis. They listen in Congress with im
patience to personal denunciations of him, and even
those who indulge in perfunctory criticism are in the
habit of running over to the White House to explain
that it is stage thunder.
The steadfastness of border States- like West Vir
ginia, Maryland and Delaware since they entered ths
Republican column and the material results of their
change of front have made a profound impression
upon the other Southern States,. and it is safe to sav
that the Solid South is broken to stay broken.
If the Republicans nominate in 1904 a candidate
who has something of President McKinley's frank
ness and adroit amiability Tammany and the North
ern Bryanites will not charm wisely enough to hold
the South in line.
SOUTH CAROLINA JARRED.
It may be asserted, without hesitation that if. under
the new management the Southern Pacific railroad is
to improve its depots along all of its lines the bene
fits to California will be manifold greater than the
cost, and the railroad will make a profit out of its
improvements. That is the law of progress, and it
is gratifying that President Hays not only understands
it but is going to act upon it.
Up to this time Carnegie has not expressed any in
tention to provide San Francisco with a library build
ing, and if his silence mean that he thinks us capable
of taking care of ourselves better than New York or;
Philadelphia we owe him thanks for the compliment;
but if he be of the opinion that we have all the" library
facilities we need or deserve he is off his trolley.

If the Southern Pacific should provide San Fran
cisco with a railway passenger station of the first
class, so that every stranger upon entering it would
be at once aware he had reached a city of metropolitan
rank, it would not be long before Third street and
Fourth street would be improved' and made stately
thoroughfares lined with noble buildings. . Public
spirit and the enterprise of individual owners would
unite to make the averiu.es which, connect the heart of
the city with a spacious and noble depot, worthy, of
their position as thoroughfares between two points
of such note.
Good work is catching. From one man it passes
to another. The improvement of a railway station
is nearly always followed by a local improvement of
the streets leading to it and the buildings surround
ing it_ . . Â¦ .--Â¦'.
The railroad managers of other lands have been
wiser in that respect than the former Southern Pa
cific managers. They have made their railway stations
attractive in many ways. In Great Britain not only
are all the railway depots excellent in design and con
struction, but even the grounds around them are kept
adorned with grass and with flowers. In France they
carry this careful regard for first impressions to such
an extent that last year during the exposition the
railways removed from their . stations and depots
every sort of glaring advertising so- as to show nothing
that would mar the general attractiveness of the build
ings and their surroundings. . Much of the same kind
of work has been done in our Eastern States, and the
results have been profitable not only to the different
communities along the lines but to the railways them
selves.
One of the grievances the people of California have
had against the former managers of the Southern
Pacific Company w.as that they made no effort what
ever to give travelers over' their lines. a good impres
sion at first sight of California .villages, towns and
cities. Any sort of a structure sufficiently strong to
keep out wind and weather was sufficient for them.
In many instances the railroad depots are so dingy
that the visitor who looks upon them naturally forms
the- opinion that the community must be made up of
shiftless, thriftless, careless people, without* enough
energy to paint a. barn. . To the fleeting tourist who
sees little of the towns and of the business carried
on there the one thing by which' he can judge the
localities he passes is the railroad depots. It is there
fore not surprising that many of them go away with
the idea that Californians are lacking in artistic taste
and business energy; that they are 'content with any
sort of building so long as it keeps the Tain off.
GRATIFYING indeed is the announcement that
orders have been .given in the engineering de
partment of the Southern Pacific that new, at
tractive and convenient "railroad depots are to be
erected along all lines of the road where the present
structures are old and unsightly. The gratification is
increased by the announcement that the work is t.Â»
begin at once, a,nd that at several towns of the State
new depots will soon be in process of construction.
The world well understands the effect of first im
pressions, but it does not always live up to" the under
standing. Those who 'are wise enough to live up to
it make a good profit from their wisdom. The mer
chant who makes his shop entrance as attractive as
possible, the manufacturer who makes his wares as
pleasing to the eye at first sight as he can, and the
individual who makes himself a-s charming to the
stranger as to the friend, never loses anything by the
effort. Such things pay. Â£%
SOUTHERN PACIFIC IMPROVEMENTS
Great Britain and Russia have acted wisely in
taking that question of the railroad siding at Tientsin
out of the hands of soldiers and turning it over to
diplomats; and now if an arrangement can be made
to let the United States construct the siding and run
the railroad everybody will be. satisfied except the Chi
nese, and they do not count.

COFFEEâ L. C, Berkeley. Cal. To boll
coffee Is to spoil it. To obtain the best
results, the roasted coffee, which shouM
be kept in a tightly covered tin. should
l*e 8rround fine Just before it Is to ba
used. Then the Quantity required should
be placed in a very fine flannel, cone
shaped bag, fitted in what is known as a
French coffee pot. and then boiling water
poured over the ground coffee. It will per
colate and be clear and free from sedi
ment. While the water ,!s percolating
through the ground coffee - the cover
should be placed over the bag to prevent
the aroma from escaping. One-half of
the llcuid that has gone into the coffee
pot may be taken out and poured over
the ground coffee. In the preparation tho
coffee pot should be on the stove, where
the liquid may remain hot, but it shoull
not be allowed to boil. In serving, milk
that has just come to a boil should bo
used. Cold milk served with the best
prepared coffee destroys its taste. Th<*
flannel bag used as above must before ever
being used be boiled in coffee grounds for
an hour to destroy any odor there might
be in the new goods. liefore making th*
coffee the . bag should be thoroughlv
rin9ed and the coffee pot be thoroughly 1
washedNwith scalding water, then rinsed
Â¦with cold water.

Against the background of selfishness and misrep
resentation, inside and outside of Cuban circles, one
declaration stands in Jiving light, to shame the self
seekers everywhere. That is the averment of General
Gomez' to General Carnot: "People attach too much
importance to the action of the convention in making
me eligible to the Presidency. It means nothing to
me. The point regarding the eligibility of the gen
erals who fought in the war should never have been
discussed, as it leaves the country open to a condition
of things such- as happened to Spain in the days' of
Amadeo and to Mexico in the days of Maximilian.
No foreigner in Cuba has expressed a desire to be
President. As for myself, I would ; not' accept the
office. It will be enough for me to have a republic
established." .
We warn the country now that if the policy of mis
representation and a misinformed public opinion shall
continue and prevail, the United States' will be repeat
ing in Cuba the experience of Spain. We will, have
our incommunicados and our reconcentrados as
Weyler had, and the sin and stain of it on our hands
will be more indelible than upon those of Spain.
The Cubans have no government of their own.
They collect and disburse no taxes; they em
ploy no police and commission no rural guards. They
are under the military government of the United States
in everything, from the appointment of a dock officer
in Havana harbor to that of a ragged guard in the
mountains. The Cubans are not responsible for order
nor the making nor the enforcement of the laws un
der which they live. They have less voice in their
government than they had under Spain. We govern
them. These noble patriots who were compared to
Washington and his compatriots are powerless in our
hands, and it is the depth of effrontery and the
height of hypocrisy to charge against them the lack
of the protection to person and property that may
outbreak in any part of the island.-
The latest attack on the people of the island by
their former advocates in this country is a blow
direct at the hope for law and order there. It is an
nounced that the rural guards, the country gendarmes,
keep the peace and preserve order by day, and by
night turn bandits and rob the rural people corrr
mitted to their charge. This is, in some quarters, ac
cepted as proof positive that the Cubans are unfitted
for self-government, and that indefinite personality,
Capital, is represented as afraid to go to the island
for fear of being stolen by the officers of the law and
the executors of order! No more sinister and lying
attack was ever made upon a people, granting the
fact charged to be a fact.
If all that were true, what has changed them:
Surely not pur presence among them, for that is sup
posed to teach and exhort to self-government by our
high example!
Canceling out the differences in race and climate, the
Cubans, -by their former friends and present critics,
are being brought to judgment by the sternest Anglo-
Saxon standard. Their idea ol liberty is being shown
up as a romantic fancy, their hope of independence
as an uneasy dream. Everything relating to their
'views of self-government and aspirations for its at
tainment is treated from' the standpoint of contempt.
They are made to appear as willful juniors in the
human family, the children of the house, who must
not be trusted to go alcne lest they fall down and run
Yet these are the same people said by members of
Congress and the press to have a government, ruling
in justice a free people, with an exchequer, public
â¢schools and all the spirit and body of a civilized state!
The little war with big consequences followed-, and
now we have the same class of men and newspapers
that urged it on engaged in another form of decep
tion in which the Cubans themselves are the victims.
Since then many disquieting things have happened,
and the end is not yet; : but the most "disagreeable of
all is now, as in the beginning, the Cuban situation.
The administration is not to blame that the people
were misled by the speeches . in Congress and" the
manufactured reports of the press. The Cuban junta
in New York was primarily responsible^ for it en
couraged, 2nd probably, paid for, a great deal of the
matter that misdirected public opinion. But, aside
from the junta's work, magazine articles by as cool
headed men as General Fitzhugh Lee contributed
their share to the general misconception. While
Lee's article on Gomez. Garcia and the other Cuban
leaders did not descend to the penny dreadful style
of the New York Journal and other papers, it was* on
that account more influential. In like manner .the
speech of Senator Proctor: of Vermont captivated the
sober, thinking mind of the country and added the
great mass of thoughtful citizens to the infuriated
contingent which wanted war at all hazards.
CUBAN MISREPRESENTATION.
THE frenzy into -which this country was wrought
over the Spanish oppression of Cuba was in a
great measure due to florid misrepresentation of
the situation there. As a retrospective matter it may
now be said with confidence that as far' as the in
terests of Cuba were concerned they and the indepen
dence of the island would have been secured in a few.
months by diplomacy. In the essence of it we did
not go to war with Spain about Cuba at all. Had the
Maine not been destroyed in Havana harbor the wise
and temperate course of the administration, backed
by public opinion, would have prevailed in spite of the
oratory of Congress and the tragic reports of special
commissioners. But the loss of a warship and the
greater loss of American lives in the catastrophe,
charged to Spain, was the last spark in the, tinder of
public sentiment, and put it on the side of the mar
tial members of Congress, leaving the administration
no choice except to give to that body entire control.

The tramer's of the Federal constitution
incorporated into that document a clause
giving to Congress an, authority which
was, then considered of minor importance,
but 'which in the process of time has done
more for the upbuilding of the . United
States than the most vivid imagination
could then have conceived possible. The
clauso to which I refer is known as para
graph 8 of section S of articlel : of the
Federal constitution, under which Con
gress is given the power **to promote the
; progress of science and the useful arts by
1 securing for. limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive rights to their re
spective writings . and discoveries." It is
the patent systemâ the outgrowth of that
constitutional provisionâ which is the sub
ject of this 'paper.
It has ever been a debatable question
whether the hope of reward is a greater
incentive to action than the fear of pun
ishment,' but it cannot" be successfully
questioned that thV hope of reward has
been that which has transformed the
dreamer into the man of action, and
which has, as has been well said, "stimu
lated men to transform their thinking into
thing's." .
Issuing the First Patent.
The authority conferred upon Congress
was soon exercised. President "Washing
ton in his annual message to Congress in
17S0 called attention to the subject and on
April 10, 1790, the first lav/ upon the sub
ject was enacted.
The importance of the exercise of care
in the granting of patents would seem to
have been impressed upon Congress by
the fact that it constituted the Secretary
of State, the Secretary of War and the
Attorney General a board to consider all
applications for patents. That this tri
bunal carefully considered the utility and
importance of inventions presented for
patent I- infer from the fact that only
nfty-seven patents were issued under this
act prior to its supersedure by the statute
of February 21,. 1793. The first patent is
sued was to Sainuel Hopkins, July 31, 1790,
for "making pot and pearl ashes." The
act of 1793 remained in force, as amended
from time to lime, until the act of 1S36
was passed. The acts of 1790 and 1793 dif
fered in some respects, the most impor
tant of which was that under the act of
1793 a patent was issued to any one who
made the necessary allegations and com
plied with the formal requirements, while
the act of 1790 required an examination
into the novelty and utility of the. inven
tion. In respect to the requirements of an
examination, the act of 1S36 followed that
of 1790, and since 1S36 patents have been
issued only after an examination and a
comparison between the invention claimed
and the prior art, so far as known to the
experts of the Patent Office. By "prior
art" Is meant prior domestic and foreign
patents and publications and any known
prior use in this country.
Important "Work of th.e Patent Office.
The scope of this article does not per
mit refererrce to the various amendments
made to the act of 1836. Suffice it to say
that, with modifications, it remained in
force until the revision of the patent laws
in 1870. This revision was largely a con
solidation of the statutes then in force.
The act of 1870 waa repealed and substan
tially re-enactod in the Revised Statutes
of the United States in 1875. "
I The number of patents granted prior to
July 28, 1S36, was 9957. Since that time
664,826 patents, not including designs, have
been issued. Since 1836 the receipts of the
office and the expense, of conducting.it
have wonderfully increased. The receipts,
during the year 1837 were less than $30,000,
while the expenses of carrying on the of
fice exceeded the receipts by about $4000.
The receipts for the year 1903 were some
thing above $1,3110.000. with expenses of
about $1,250,000. The receipts of the. Patent'
Office up to the present ttime have ex
ceeded its disbursements by over $5,000,000.
In 1790, when patents were first granted,
the occasional service of one clerk suf
llced to do the clerical work connected
with the issuing of patents. At the pres
ent time the force of the Patent Office
numbers 679. In 1836 it was comparatively
easy to examine the "prior art" and de
termine the novelty of the claimed inven
tion. . At the present time the work of ex
amination is of enormous magnitude, and
it is not to be wondered at that patents
are often issued which should have been
rejected. _ â¢
Great Benefit of the Patent Laws.
The patent laws of the United States
are more beneficent than those. of any
other country, and more labor is per
formed under" them, with the least pe
cuniary return to the Government, for the
benefit of inventors Irrespective of their
nationality, than is penerally understood.
And yet the United States could have
well afforded to bear all the expenses con
nected with the" issue of patents without
the payment of- any fees by the inven
tors, for it is invention that has made
possible the unparalleled growth of the
country In population and wealth. EHmi^
nate the cotton gin, the reaper, the elec
tric telegraph, the sew4ng machine, the
typewriter, the telephone, the drive well,
the rotary web-perfectlng printing press,
the perfected -dynamo Â»nd a host of other
meritorious inventions, and this country,
instead of being a world power, would be
a feeble nation, wi.th .much of its broad
domain uncultivated, the home of wild
animals and still more. savage nien. The
debt of the United States to inventors and
discoverers will be partially repaid some
day by the erection at the beautiful cap!-'
tal of the nation of a building of magnifi
cent proportions, in which Bhall be illus
trated In appropriate manner the growth
of the Industrial arts. â¢
What Inventions* May Be Patented.
The patent law provides that to the one
who, having I invented or ; discovered any
new and useful art," machine, manufacture
or composition of matter, or any new and
useful improvement tnereof, not known or
used by others in this country before his
invention ' or discovery thereof, and not
patented- or described in any- printed pub
lication' . In i this or any * f oreigm country
before his invention or discovery thereof,
or more than two years prior to his appli
cation, and not in public use or on sale
in- the United States for -more than two
years prior to his application,". unless the
same is proved to have been abandoned,
a patent, upon due application being; made
therefor andupon payment of the nominal
fee of $35.' will issue under the seal of. the
Patent . ' Office, , for a Â¦ term of Â¦ seventeen
years, granting to the patentee, . his heirs
or, assigns, the exclusive right to make,
use and vend the invention or, discovery
throughout the United States and the Ter
ritories â¢ thereof, referring to . the specifi
cation for the particulars thereof. Nay,
more, the inventor is required to pay only
$15 of the ?35 in order to have the ques
tion determined whether or not a. patent
shall issue to -him. and he Is allowed a
period of six months after the allowance
of his application for patent in which to
pay the final Government fee of $20.
Making 1 Application for. a Patent.
Applications for , patents . must be made
in writing, and an applicant must file in
the Patent Office a written description of
his invention and of the manner and pro
cess of making, constructing, compound-
Ing and using It. .Such description must
be sufficiently full, clear and exact. to en
able any person / skilled ' in the art or
science to -which; it appertains to make,
construct, compound, and use the same.'
The specifications and claims tnust be
signed by ; the inventor . and attested ' by
two witnesses, and when the nature of.the
case admits, the applicant-must furnish a
drawing made in compliance -with the
rules of the office and attested by two wit
nesses. He must also make oath that he
verily ; helieves Â« himself to be the original
and first Inventor or, discoverer of the art,

The issue is one that should be taken up by the

to make alone trie fight for a measure of such impor
tance to all sections cf the Union. A cheap library
post is one of the things we should expect and de
mand at the next session of Congress.
benefits of the act are such as are maintained' by "pub
lic taxation;, school, college and; other educational
libraries; and '.'society or social libraries having en
tire of. partial tax". exemption, or other public privi
leges, maintained by, endowment or taxation, or from
both sources, by religious; literary, professional, trade,
industrial or library associations."
The 'advantages /of. the plan are that it will make
books more accessible to the general public, will bring
city into direct' relation with readers living
in the country, increase the educational facilities of
every State in the Union, and lead to a cultivation
among the people of a taste for a higher standard -of
leading than is now common.
The only valid objection that has been made to the
plan is that it would entail a loss upon the Postoffice.
Department. That objection is, however, weakened
by the fact that the postoffice would not
have, to Â¦ carry library- books, any considerable
distance, and at a conference held at Wash
ington upon the subject if was conceded that
the- cent rate of postage is profitable within a
radius of thirty miles, and occasionally profitable at
sixty miles. Furthermore, the experience of other
countries with parcels posts is favorable to a much
reduced rate for a library post. -The pamphlet adds:
"The express companies carry for cent rate second
class matter in a large area as New England and the
Middle States wherever they have offices. Their
minimum charge is five cents, but they call for and re
ceipt for packages and deliver to address. A similar
library area seems equally practicable for the postal
system/ If Congress classifies library books as sec
ond class matter it is probable the express companies
will give to libraries the same favorable rate."

respectively of Joseph Chamberlain, in
connection with charges bearing' on War
Office contracts, the case of the plaintifr.3

He said there were paragraphs disclaim

The New â¢ York will convey Mr. Gum
mere, United States Consul, from Tangier
to the seaport of Mazargan, whence he
will travel overland to Morocco City, the
political capita] of Morocco, there to de
mand from the Sultan of Morocco an apol
ogy for an apparent discourtesy to tho
United. States, committed by the Sultan's
Grand Vizier and his Minister of Foreign
Affairs. At the same time Mr. Gummere
will request the Sultan to settle certain
claims of tho United States, long pending
against the Government of Morocco.
These claims arose largely from "alleged
undue interferences by officials of the Sul
tan with American citizens doing business
in Morocco.
The occurrences happened some time
ago, and the suggestions of the American
Government, through its consular repre
sentative, that the claims arising there
from be settled by, Mprocco have been
ignored by the Sultan. When Mr. Gum
mere said he would see the Sultan per
sonally on the matter of these claims he
was told by the Sultan's Grand Vizier and
his Minister of Foreign Affairs that any
such effort would be useless, as the Sultan
would remove himself and his Ministers
from- their capital, Morocco City, if the
American Consul General attempted to
visit them there. *
This discourteous statement- constituted
the offense for which the Moroccan Gov
ernment has been asked to apologize, and
to secure which apology Mr. ' Gummere,
backed up by the New York at Mazagan,
will travel overland to the Sultan's cap
ital.
The United States Government expe
rienced some difficulty and delay last year
In securing the payment of $5000 from the
Government of Morocco for the latter's
failure to make any attempt to punish
the leaders of a mob who burned and
killed the naturalized "American citizen
Marcus Ezeaul. at Fez last June. After
considerable correspondence on the mat

threatened to send a warship to Tangier

word was received that President McKin
lev had accepted the invitation it would
not be possible to make public any ar
rangements proposed by the club.
It is known, however, that if President
McKinley accepts the invitation the (fath
ering will be a remarkable one. It is
hoped that President Diaz of Mexico will
be present at the banquet, an invitation
to come to California having been sent to
him by Governor Gage and Mayor Phe
lan, representing the State and this city.

ernment in the Frankfort Arsenal was
used by the Drigrgs-Seabury Gun and Am
munition Company, it is asserted, In man
ufacturing ammunition for the Colombian
Government at a time when, the Driggs-
Sea-bury Company was in default on two
contracts to supply the United States Gov
ernment with similar ammunition.,
This charge is made in a brief filed with
the Controller of the Treasury to-day by
S. G. Hopkinsin behalf of the American
Ordnance Company, which was an unsuc
cessful bidder for contracts awarded to
the Driggs-Seabury Company. It is al
leged in this brief that the Driggs-Sea
bury Company not having facilities for
making drawn copper cartridge shells re
quired for ammunition to be furnished
under their contracts -with the United
States, applied to the War Department
for the use of a. hydraulic press in the
Frankfort Arsenal, and that the use of
this press was given them free of charge,
though it is not alleged that any Govern
ment labor or material was used without
payment.
One of the Government contracts called
for the delivery of 2000 rounds of fixed
ammunition for rapid-fire guns by August
17. 1Â£9S. and another by July, 1900. It is
changed that while these contracts were
still unfulfilled, the cqmpany received a
contract from the Colombian Government
for similar ammunition and that part of
the ammunition which had been manu
factured for the United States. was sold
by the Driggs-Seabury Company to wÂ»e
Colombian Government. The. total amount
thus sold is not specified, although it is
asserted that the Driggs-Seabury Com
pany has admitted selling 500 rounds.
Mr. Hopkins said to-night that If the
Controller did not take action, suspending
payments to the Driggs-Seabury Com
pany, the American Ordnance Company
would institute a suit in the courts, and
if satisfaction could not be obtained in
any other way the whole matter would
be laid before Congress and a Congres
sional investigation asked -for..

Pending the acceptance of the invita
! tion by the President the members o" the
i Union League Club are averse to discuss
ing any of the details of the proposed
banquet of honor.
President George D. Clark of. the Union
Leagoie Club stated yesterday that until
The Union League Club of San Francisco,
California, presents Kb compliments to the
President and lÂ«scs leave to tender him a ban
ouec at its cluUroomS' on such a date sts he
may select on the occasipn of his visit to San
Francisco, 1901.
A UNIQUE invitation to accept a
banquet will be tendered to Pres
ident McKinley to-day in Wash
ington, D. C, by the Union
League Club, of San Francisco,
represented by Deputy Attorney General
W. M. Abbott. *- â¢
The invitation is engraved on a plate of.
pure gold, which is three and a half inches
wide by six in length and one-eighth of
an inch deep.
The fnlon League Club is desirous of
entertaining President McKinley when he
visits San Francisco, and if the chief ex
ecutive of the nation accepts the request
the date of the banquet will be decided
upon by the distinguished guest of honor.
The inscription on the plate is aa fol
lows: .
Department is much encouraged bv re
ports from the Philippines and also from
n cruHing officers. The Insurrection in the
islands is rapidly eoing lo p i t . C es, and it
Is now believed a much smaller, aray can
har.flle the sStaation than heretofore plan-
Led. Instead of an army of C0.OO0 for the
Philippine?, the department now believes
Â«rt.0OJ men will be enough to protect the
islands and insure order and peace
throughout the archipelago. Recruiting
for the new army is gciruj forward most
satisfactorily. The average enlistment is
lt<00 a wrok, thit= Ix-ing as many a.s the
oppartrnpnt can handle in equipment, drill
and rrtrtpmeot to the Philippines. The de
partment expects to enlist the full 1W.000
men provided for by the new army bill,
but It will not try to maintain the" army
at that maximum tig-ure. There will be
se.OfO regulars whose terms of service ex
pire in six months. When these are dis
charged their places are not to be filled
if the present promisinpr conditions in thÂ«
Philippines continue. That- would place
the army at 70.000 men instead of the 100,
Â«<K) .provided by law. The President is
anxious to keep the army down to the
minimum and horÂ«?s to have it not above
ZB.O00. \V:ih 40,000 troops in the Philippines
and 30;<Kjy for this country. Cuba and
Porto Rico, he would have an army repre
temir.p less than one man to every 1000
population. It would disappoint the Dem
ocrat*, who have comploJned of the big
army authorized bv Congress, but it would
demonstrate that the President does not
want a large army, except In case of
emergency.

March 22, cables the War Department as
follows:
"Hushes reports the surrender of Fullon
and command at Antique. j>rovince of. Pa

In order to expedite the transportation
of troops b"twÂ«-en San Francisco and Ma

the steamship Ohio of the Empire Trans

as a troops-hip. It is eslfmated that she
can be made ready in two or three weeks

BACOLOR, island of Negros, March 22.
âAccording to expressions of a larpe ma
jority of the delegates from Occidental
ICefrroe and of a few who were present
at the Oriental Fide, the sentiment of the
people is overwhelmingly in favor of suc
ceeaine the present governments in both
divisions. The reasons given for this view
are thai such a. change will effect a re
duction of taxes and the high eajarics of
officials, the establishment of schools and
the improvement of the roads. The speak

President McKinley . Vf ants
to See All the Sights on;
His Outing.
Apprehension That the City Commit
tee Is Placing Too Many Hand- .
shaking- Heceptions on V
. the Schedule.
Henry T. .Scott returned ' from thie Bast
Thursday, night. In Washington he had
several talks with*; President McKinley.
The President anticipates , pleasure and
recreation in his California outing. - .
The Presidential party will visit New
Orleans, Houston,. San Antonio, El Paso,
Tucson and other places on its journey to
the Pacific Coast, but' the true holiday of
the excursion will not begin until It
crosses the Colorado River and enters the
zone of sunshine and llowers.
The; first important stop in California
will be made at Redlands. There, accord
ing to the programme. President McKin
ley will be welcomed to the State by Gov
ernor Gage. A halt of six hours at Red
lands will enaT>le the President and his
Cabinet officers to view the landscape
from the heights adjacent.
The. party will aught from the train
again at '.Kiverside, where a few hours'
enjoyment will be afforaed. Leaving the
orange groves of San Bernardino County,
the special will run to the sea, stopping
at Santa Monica, where the tourists win
rest for the night. The next day Los An
geles will have the pleasure of ministering
to the delight of tne eminent guests. It
goes without saying that all the members
of the- Presidential party will be royally
received Â¦ by the metropolis of Southern
California, as the dwellers In that region
are admo"nished, that "angels have been
entertained unawares." .
Â¦ The original schedule provided for a
speedy trip from Los Angeles to Santa
Barbara, but Senator Baru was quick to
perceive that his neighbors would hold
him accountable if the President were per
mitted to leave California without receiv
ing the adulation .of Ventura, hence the
itinerary was revised, and a half hour's
time allotted to Venturans. A restful time
at Santa Barbara is anticipated.
If there be no other change from the
original and accepted schedule the next
important stop will be at Monterey. The
special is scheduled to arrive there at 2
a. m., Saturday, May 11. Citizens of Sa
linas are asking that the schedule be
changed to enable the President and Cab
inet officers to view the marvels of indus
trial prosperity to be seen thereabout. It
is figured that the party could stop for one
hour at Salinas and see the largest sugar
factory in the world. As the special is
scheduled to pass through -Salinas about
midnight, arrangements may be made to
run out from Monterey some, time Satur
day forenoon. The President will be the
guest of the Grand Army Veterans at Pa
cific Grove Saturday afternoon. .
On the way from Monterey Bay to San
Francisco the President will tarry at San
Jose, Palo Alto and Burlingame. At the
last-named place he will be welcomed to
San Francisco by Mayor Phelan. â¢
It Is the general sentiment In San Frari
cisco tha,t the programme for the Presi
dent's sojourn in the city imposes upon
him too many duties in the line of recep
tions to various societies and organiza
tions. It was suggested to him .that the
trip to Mount Tamalpals be cut out to
lighten his engagements for one of the
days, but he said that he wanted to go to
the mountain if fog did not prevail.
ELKS TO HONOR.McZUJXEY.
He also expressed a desire to visit the
Big Trees of the Santa Cruz or Russian
River forests. It is plain enough that he
wants to get outdoors and away from the
pressure of handshaking: throngs, and it
seems to be a sensible Suggestion that the
committee should," If possible, relieve him
of reception burdens. It will bo recollected
that the Oakland committee's programme
on the occasion, of President Harrison's
reception Â¦Was so formidable that the dis
tinguished guest broke away from the es
corting citizens and made a sudden dash
for the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. .

Local Option Bill Slips Through. Ihir

Legislature.
PHOENIX, Ariz.. March 22.â The twen-
ty-first Arizona Legislature adjourned at
3:S0 o'clock this morning after a sixty
â¢lays' session of mostly perfunctory pro
reedir.gF. A fierce fight was waged over
the minor details of the appropriation
hill, caused mostly by Jealousy between
the two houses in granting 1 emoluments to
women clerks. Without much struggle the
clauses of the bill increasing the salaries
of the Governor and Supreme Court
Judges were agreed to.
Filibustering hindered legislation during
the closing- hours, and In the heat of de
bate over less important matters a local
option bill, similar to that now In force In
Texas, was rushed through, creating
jrreat surprise. The bill provides that
counties, towns or districts may abolish
the sale of liquor by a two-third* vote.
An appropriation was made for the con
tinuance of the Investigation into the
criminal alteration of the Insurance bill,
which was passed a few days ago and al
tered while en route to the engrossing

SAN BERNARDINO, March 22.â Morris
Keller, a wealthy hotel-keeper of Pomona,
who three weeks ago made an unsuccess
ful attempt to cause the release of his
wife from the Southern California Hos
pital for the Insane at Highland, is about
to Institute another legal battle with Dr.
Campbell, the medical superintendent.
This afternoon the Sheriff served papers
on Dr. Campbell, ordering him to appear
in court next . Tuesday and show cause
why the unfortunate woman should not
be released.
Keller makes 'sensational charges
against the management of the institu
tion. He asserts that his wife Is not
given sufficient nourishment or exercise;
that since her commitment last December
ehe had decreased in weight from 150 to
less than 90 pounds. He says the only
nourishment given Mrs. Keller is one pint
of milk a day, which is barely enough to
keep her alive, and that she Is compelled
to remain in bed when she should be given
the freedom of the hospital grounds.
Keller desires to take his wife home,
where, he says, better treatment can be
given her. He declares that If she re
mains in the asylum her death will soon
follow. Dr. Campbell Insists that if the
court releases the patient a dangerous
precedent will be established. ' â¢ â¢ ,

VIEXXA, March 22.â A highly romantic
tragedy is reported from a little country
town In Hungary. A fetv days ago a
poorly clad man knocked at the door of
a. woman residing- alone and begged for
shelter for the night. Touched by his fpr
lorn appearance, the woman took him into
the house and pave him a room. Before
retiring the tramp handed the hostess a
FmaJl package, requesting her to keep It
Jor him until next morning.
The woman took the package and prom
ised to put it safely away, but when the
Ftrange visitor was asleep her curiosity
pretting the better of her scruples, she
â¢ipened the package. To her surprise she
found it contained a number of bank
notes of large denominations. The eight
of so much wealth fired her cupidity and
linaJly led her to the murder of the sleep
ing man with a hatchet.
Then she determined to remove the
body in order to conceal the evidence of
her crime, but on approaching the corpse
fhe made a. horrible discovery. In the
countenance of the dead man she recog
nized for the first time the features of
her own husband, who hadjeft the coun
try t6 reek his fortune in America some

KIDDER'S PHYSICIANS
CAN OFFER NO HOPE
Invalid State Debris Commissioner
Rallies and; Grows Slightly Stronger
But Final Recovery Is Improbable
Navigators of the coast of Southern
California are grateful for the action of
the" United States Board of Lighthouse
Commissioners for constructing a new
light and signal station at Point Arguello,
a rocky promontory which juts out Into
the r-ea twelve miles northwest of Point
Conception. There has never before been
any warning light , at this '; point, though
it Is considered one of the most dangerous
on the lower coast. It Is subject at all
times to fog, which is most dense in the
summer. months, when navigation Is heav
iest. /
It stands at the real entrance : to Santa
Barbara channel, and la the point where
shipping that takes* the course outside. of
the Santa Barbara Islands deflects to the
westward. The new light, which has
been erected under the plans of Major C.
Â£. Ij. B. Davis, is of the fourth order and
Is - located at the extreme end of Point
Arguello, at a, height of ntaety-one feet
above mean low water. The character of
the light is fixed white and Illuminates
the entire horizon, having a limit of visi
bility of 15% miles. It first flashed its
welcome beams on the night of Washing
ton's birthday. -. ' â¢
The fog signal which Is combined with
the Point Arguello . light is one of the
most powerful on the coast and Is the first
constructed which is operated by com
pressed air in place of steam. As a gen
eral thing lighthouses and signal stations
are located far from ordinary lines of
traffic, and the cost of transportation for
coal and other bulky materials is a\serl
ous tax on the Government. By the use
of compressed air this expense will be
greatly reduced. * If it proves to be suc
cessful in this instance all other signal
stations in this district will- be thus
equipped. The signal at Point Arguello
Is operated by two thirteen horsepower
Hornsby-Akroyd oil engines, giving a
pressure of thiity-flve pounds and driving
the air compressor, which runs the Cros
by automatic signals. The siren has the
following characteristics: Blast of three
seconds with an interval of four seconds,
then another blast of three seconds, suc
ceeded by an Interval of twenty sec
onds and then repeated once each minute.
The signal operates during the prevalence
of fog only, the light always at night
from sunset to sunrise.
The following direction to navigators
will be Issued by the lighthouse board
relative to the new station:
Vessels from the northward first sleht the
Islands of the Santa Barbara Channel, and if
desiring to pass south, outside the Islands, use
Point Arguello as a point of departure. Deep
water is to be found just outside rocks, off the
point which Â¦ projects westward eight and a
half miles beyond Point Conception, and forms
the first angle of the deflection of the coast
line, as Point Conception forms the second.
The buildings at Point Arguello are
plain but substantial, with, the light
placed in a tower above the fog signal.
The force stationed there consists of a
keeper and two assistants. For the first
time the chain of lights from the. extreme
southern boundary of California to San
Francisco Bay is complete. The navi
gator now can neVer lose sight of one
light before he : observes the other. The
radii of each interlock those of Its
nearest neighbors, both north and south.
The new light at Point Arguello Is the
only link of the chain heretofore missing
along the 400 miles of cbast.

MARSEILLES. March 22.â The employes
of. the streetcar line struck to-day. A
few street cars are running under the
protection of policemen. The strikers am
very much excited. They attacked one
car and cut the electric wires. A fight
ensued and a detachment of mounted
gendarmes charged and dispersed the
rioters.
During the scrimmage a soda water
siphon was thrown at the head of a lieu
tenant of gendarmes and knocked him
unconscious from his horse. The gen
darmes In seeking to carry off the lieu
tenant were assailed by a volley of stones
and bottles and were obliged to fire their
revolvers in the air. The gendarmes then
charged and cleared the streets.
Late this afternoon the strikers at
tacked and wreckpd two streetcars on the
Canneblerre. The engineer and conductor
were roughly bandied. A detachment of
gendarmes and hu'ssers succeeded in. res
cuing the engineer and conductor, amid
the hooting and stone-throwing of the
crowd. â¢
Yesterday's decision, of the council of
the labor union and fne labor exchange
In favor of a general strike and their Is

the situation. The cabinet workers, the
locksmiths, the engineers, the calkers,
the oil workers, the millers and the
bakers' unions have struck already or
will do so shortly.
A corps of military bakers from the

fantry arrived here this morning from
neighboring towns. The prefect has con
ferred with the military commander re
garding the measures to adopt in view
of the serious outlook. It Is estimated
that 18,000 men are now out on strike
About 1200 " free laborers are working on
the docks. They are strongly protected
by troops.
The Society â¢ for the Defense of Com
mercial Interests has appealed to the Pre
mier and the Minister of Commerce to use
their personal influence to bring to an end
"the present reign of terror.'' : â¢Â¦Â¦,..
It appears that . through the : evening
rioting the gendarmes fired not only into
the air but into the crowd. A child was
wounded in the shoulder and a numbe
of rioters were also wounded. â¢' .. ~.
NAPLES, March 22.â Two thousand of
the 2500 dock laborers, who went on strike
here Tuesday in sympathy with the Mar

work, provided vessels of the south; of
France were not admitted to this port. It
Is expected that the local strike will end
to-morrow.

White Cottolene is a .product

It wasn't the pie^s fault that it

The comic opera company which has
played at the Columbia Theater for the
past two weeks. In "The Highwayman,"
Is in . serious financial trouble, 'and the
pretty chorus girls of the organization
realize they are a long way from home.
The heroic doings of "The Highway
man" and the serpentine dances of "La
Loie Fuller," introduced between acts,
have not caused the amusement-seeking
public to rush to the box office of the Co
lumbia,' and while business in other cities
has" been fair the treasury of the traveling
funmakers has not been overflowing with
"eagles" or "twenties."
When the company left New York at the
commencement of the season the manager
was" Frank W. Turpin, and he arrived In
San Francisco with the Thespians.
.The members , of ' the company and the
bevy of chorus girls are wondering where
Turpin Is located, as hq has riot been seen
since Wednesday night. When Thursday
and Friday passed without a' sight' of the
manager or any word from him the sing
ers- of - "The Highwayman" Company
realized; there was something wrong and
rumors flew through the air In rapid
order. . . -.'
Last evening's performance lacked
spirit, for each actor and actress, Includ
ing ' the chorus Â¦ girls, wondered If . "the
ghost" would stalk abroad on next salary
day, and -if "transportation" .-, would be
forthcoming for the. tour to Los Angeles
and. the return trip via Portland, Or. After
the performance last night the principals
of the company met in council and for
two hours an animated session was held.
When It was concluded the Thespians left
the theater, but each, one of them had
been pledged to secrecy.
It was rumored that the company would
continue Its tour on the â¢ "commonwealth
plan" and that the business manager, J.
F.Burrlll, would look after the interests
of. the company. â¢ . .
It was also reported that La Loie Ful

were seen after the conference last nleht.
and while they, admitted that . serious

were sanguine that v everything would

Will Leonard Wanted.
The offlcera and crew, of the; Spreckels
tug Relief are very anxious to learn- the
whereabouts of Will Leonard. The lad
waa messboy on the towboat and Thurs
day-morning he disappeared. When the
Bark Commandant Marchanri Re
ports Supposed Disaster.
Another marine disaster Is supposed to
have occurred In the southern seas. A
large bark Is reported ashore on' the
Vairaa tea. Reef, but the underwriters and
shipping men are not ready to accept the
report as correct. Valraatea Reef, or
Egmont Island, is C00 miles from Tahiti
and S30 miles from Manga Reva Island,
on which the British four-masted bark
Pyrenees was beached on December 2
last. Captain Arneau of the Commandant
Marchand Bays that on February 6 he
passed the reef and eaw a Jarge bark
ashore. No signals were flying, and a*
be could not get near the island on ac
count of l>ad weather eo further informa
tion couid \.k. gained. The weather had
been thick for several days, and it was
raining at ihe time, A close scrutiny of
the inantine register does not disclose
any vessel that could have been anywhere
near Valrnatca Reef at the time given
and ship captains are of the opinion that
the master of the Commandant Marchand
made a mistake in his calculations and
that It was the Pyrenees he saw on
Manga Reva and not Vairaatea Reef.
Owing to the thick weather it may have
been several days before an observation
could be taken, and as all the atolls in the
southern teas look alike It would be easy
to mistake one for the other.
New French Cruiser.
Naval men are greatly Interested In the
latest addition to the French navy. The
French armored cruiser Jeanne d'Arc is
a new departure in- naval architecture,
and although she looks well on paper
there are plenty of naval men to be found
who assert that she will not be the suc
cess her builders expect.
The Jeanne d'Arc was laid down In
April. 1896. and had a builder's trial a
few weeks ago which was perfectly satis
factory. She is 11,225' tons displacement,
477 feet 2 Inches long, 63 feet 8 Inches
beam and 27 feet t> Inches mean draft.
Her coal capacity is calculated to give her
a range of 13.500 miles at a speed of ten
knots. Her cix funnels and other pecu
liarities will make her a conspicuous war
ship in ary ocean.
The Overdue Fleet.
The British bark Khorasan arrived at
Yokohama yesterday and the joy thereat
was " great among t>e reinsurance gam
blers. The vessel was 231 days out from
Tampa for Yokohama, and 40 per cent
Â¦was paid by the underwriters to reinsure
their risks. Just why the vessel was con
sidered a risk Is hard to pay, as she was
not overdue and- a .vessel has ' not been
lost between Florida. and Japan in years.
As was predicted In The Call yesterday,
the rate of reinsurance ' on' the British
ship Ardnamurchan went up 15 per cent
yesterday. She is now out 116 days from
British Columbia for, England, and 65-per
cent is now the ruling rate.
THE steamships Umatilla and
Sanca Rosa of the Pacific Coast
line made things very lively at
Broadway wharf yesterday morn
ing. For five hours about 200
stevedores worked without a moment's
rest transferring oranges from one vessel
to the other. The job was completed on
time and the Umatilla sailed for Puget
Sound, while the Santa Rosa docked and
proceeded to discharge the remainder of
her frelcht.
For some time past the Southern Pacific
and banta Fe railroads have beÂ«n short
of rolling stock. In consequence, so 'tis
said, fullv one-third of the orange crop
of Southern California will be wasted for
want of a market.
This state <.i affairs was drawn to the
attention cf the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and that concern laid the mat
ter before the Great Northern Railroad
Company. An arrangement was reached
by which a trial shipment of about twenty
carloads was to be sent to St. Paul via
San Francisco and Seattle. At San Diego
six carloads were put aboard the Santa
Rosa. At Redondo seven carloads more
were added to the steamship's freight,
and wncn she arrived at Port LO3 An
geles eleven carloads more were awaiting
her.
The crew of the Santa Rosa worked
night and day to bring: the steamship Into
port on time, but an accident at Port Los
Angeles detained her several hours. While
backing away from the wharf one of the
stern lines got caught In the propeller.
Several attempts were made to get it out.
but finally the vessel had to be anchored
&.n<3 men put over the side .to cut the ropi
away. Then the steamship was backed
and filled until the rope was worked out
of the screw.
The Santa Rosa arrived in port late
Thursday night and at 5 a. m. yesterday
she went alongside the Umatilla. Through
the cargo ports and over gangways the
boxf s of fruit were rushed from steam
ship to pteamship, and by 10:30 a. m.
nearly 9000 boxf>s hnd been taken from the
Santa Rosa and stowed away aboard tho
Umatilla. There was no trucking, each
box b*>ing carried or passed from man to
man In its progress from vessel to vessel.
When the Umatilla reaches Seattle she
will po alongside the Great Northern's
wharf, where a train of cars will be
awaiting her. The oranges will be at onco
transferred from the steamship to the
cars and about five hours after the Unia
tllla docks the fruit will be on Its way
to St. Paul. It has taken the Southern
Pacific from fifteen to twenty days to de
liver the eouthern fruit in St. Paul, while
by this means, those who are handling
the venture say, it will be .at Ita destina
tion in ten days. From San Diego to Seat
tle via S3n Francisco takes five days, and
the Great Northern promises that five
days more will pee the fruit In St. Paul.
Should the venture prove a success mil
lions of dollars' worth of fruit will be sent
East by this route.

ITALIAN COLONY
READY FOR WAR
Crabflsbers Threaten the
.Â¦Neapolitans With Dire
Vengeance
\ .,.- Â» Â¦ Â¦ â
Little Italy All Agog and a Speedy
Conflict Between the Fully Armed
â¢ âOpposing Factions Seems
- -is. â¢ Inevitable.
" Thublack' cloud ~of war is rapidly gath
ering over 'the Italian /'colony, and the
"crab Â¦j fishers," as -they -are called, are
sharpening their 1 knives to wreak' venge
ance onthe Neapolitans. The hostile fac
tion's go about In numbers in order to be
prepared for sudden onslaughts of tlje'en
emy.'^IU feellngÂ»has- been brewing for
some time, and affairs-were brought to a
climax yesterday, when one of the Neapo
litans caused the arrest of the wife otÂ« a
.''crab. fisher" on the ground of cruelty to
a child.'
"*AÂ» few- months ago complaint was en
tered with the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty' to .Children that
Mrs. Leoni Santori was abusing an infant
child. Kiln. An investigation was made,
byt as . little Â¦ convicting . - testimony I was
forthcoming and as the complainant, Mrs.
Dini of 915 Montgomery street, was shown
to be actuated by 'personal motives, the
affair was dropped.
- -Yesterday Mrs. .Louisa Cecchinl of 1112
Kearny. street swore to a' warrant againat
Mrs. Santori, and Special Officer McMur
ray served the. same. Mrs. Cecchinl ac
companied the officer, part of the way to
the house, -but when Mrs. \ Santori was
seen coming 'toward them Mrs. Cecchinl
fled In terror. The complainant charged
that Mrs. Santori had most severely beat
en the child and had then bitten It se
riously," as punishment' for some trifling
mischief. Thi3 the mother denied, and
said that the. whole trouble was caused
by Mrs. Dlni.,who admired the child and
wanted to get. possession of It. When she
found out the course affairs had - taken
Mrs., Santorl's 'eyes blazed, and" In the
Italian tongue Ehe uttered direful threats
against Mrs. Cecchinl and the Neapoli
tans. - . â¢
Mr. Santori .came to the prison as Of
ficer McMurray was trying to explain
that bail was necessary. Not realizing
the situation nor perceiving that the
stranger was an officer, Santori called his
friends and was about to make summary
disposal of the supposed confidence man.
"who was trying to bunko his wife out of
$25.":' Affairs were at last adjusted with
out violence and the case -will be heard
before Judge Cabaniss to-day. - Â¦ <
* Meanwhile the "crab fishers" threaten
that the matter, will be settled by blood
alone and are preparing to make their
threats good. The Neapolitans are eager
for the fray and loudly proclaim their
ability to destroy the '"crab fishers."

Colonel Southard Hoffman. Clerk of the
United States Circuit Court, and George
E. Mors,\ Clerk of the United States Dis
trict Court, are surprised that the CJil-
Jiese ami Ja;-.mese who attempted In vain
to make before the County Clerk their
declarations of Intention to become citi
zens, of the United States have not ap
plied to them.
"We will take the declaration of each
and every Chinaman and Japanese in the
country who wishes to forswear alle
giance to the Emperor of China or the
Mikado of Japan." they said yesterday.
The Federal clerks charge a fee of 53 10
for each declaration of intention. They
do not care whether a Chinaman or a I
Japanese may be naturalized or not aft- 1
â¢ rward. They will issue the declarations
immediately upon application.
Tne County Clerk of the city and coun-
Sof San Francisco Is not allowed to
arpe any fee for this service, and this is
believed to be the economical reason why
the batch of Japanese applied to the
County Clerk a few days ago instead of
to the Federal clerks.
Papers certifying to the holders' dec
larations of intention are of considerable
value. JCo foreigner mav enter the serv
ice of the United States Government in 1
any capacity or be employed In the army
or navy unless he has previously filed his i
declaration of intention to become a citi- I
zen of the United States. For this reason j
Chinese and Japanese make their declara- j
tions, many of them being employed on i
Government transports. ;
In seventeen of the States of the Union
foreigners provided with such papers may
vote for State officers, and a recent deci
sion of the United States courts is to the
effect that Presidential Electors are State
officers, so that a foreigner in those
States. Chinaman or otherwise, armed
with a paper costing not more than $3 10
may vote for President of the United
States.
The last Mongolian to take out a cer
tificate of declaration in the Federal
. court? in this city was "Jimmy" Poy. a
native of China. On April 25, 1S99,
"Jimmy" paid the fee, forswore all alle
riance to Kwane Hsu. Emperor of China.
and declared his intention of becoming- a
citizen of tVÂ»p United States. In case Con-
PT-ees should decide to naturalize Mon
jrolians. "Jimmy" Poy will be ready to
rut off his queue and become a full-fledg
ed voter.
The last Japanese to tnke out a certifi
cate of this kind was Harry M. Xaka
mura, who took the oath of allegiance be
fore the Clerk of the United States Dis
trict Court on July ?S. 1SS& No applicant,
r.o matter what his race, color or condl- j
tlon. has ever been denied such certificate
In either of the Federal courts so long as
he tendered the nfcessary fee.
Clerks Mors=e and Hoffman have opened
several <juart bottles of fresh ink and are i
rÂ»Â»ady for the entire Chinese and Japan
ese population of the State, accompanied,
of course, by the fee.

MADE A TEST.
To Prove the Effects of Coffee.
When a medicine has been successful in restoring
to health more than a million women, you cannot
well say without trying it, " I do not believe it will
help me." If you are ill, do not hesitate to get a bot-
tle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at
once, v and write Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for
special advice. It is free and helpful.
Those women who refuse to accept anything else are rewarded
a hundred thousand times, for they get what they want â a cure.
Moralâ -Stick to the medicine that you know is Best. <*
Tito Qreat Woman's Remedy for* Woman's Ms.
Follow the record of this medicine, and remember that these
thousands of cures of women letters are constantly printed
in this paper were riot brought about by "something else," but by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
Do not be persuaded that any other medicine is just as good.
Any dealer who asks you to buy something else when you go into
his store purposely to buy Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
has no interest in your case. He is merely trying to sell you some-
thing on which he can make a larger profit. He does not care
whether you get well or not, so long as he can make a little more
money out of your sickness. If he wished you well he would
without hesitation hand you the medicine you ask for, and which he
knows is the best woman's medicine in the world.
No other medicine in the world has received such widespread
and unqualified endorsement. â¢Â¦-â¢:Â«*Â¦-.

NEW TORK. March 22.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Great
strength and activity, fully up to the recently
established standards of the market, were seen
during the week. Prices advanced In the
early days of the week and the steel indus
trial stocks fairly shared honors with the rail
road list. In both departments of the market
new records as to quotations were made, and
although there was a considerable amount of
manipulation outside participation increased.
London shewed little Interest in the market
and the tone of speculation there was un
fortunate and affected by the rumors that a
collision between Russia and England In China
was possible. In fact the stories that an
actual clash between the forces of the two
powers at Tientsin might occur unsettled the
money, and stock markets abroad, and on last
Wednesday produced a selling movement and
a setback In prices here. This movement,
however, was apparsntly due In any event and
the liquidation was by no means severe.
Fresh buying made Its appearance and the
news on Thursday was that Russia and Eng
land were again in accord, thus removing any
ground for fear that '.ue money market would
be unfavorably affected by foreign ipolltlcal
complications. A stronger tone thereupon re
asserted , Itself and the upward movement in
prices, based on the favorable crop and busi
ness outlook, the incrcueing earnings of rail
road properties, their cood dividend prospects
and the talk of further deals and combinations
among the- different systems, with the really
striking success of the steel deal, all com
bined to sustain a buoyant tone In speculation
NEW YORK. March 22â There was a great
variety of movements in the stock market to
day under the shifting operations of specula
tive pools. The opening was quite strong, the
most potent influence being the more cheerful
tone in the foreign markets on the agreement
reported between Great Britain and Russia
over the difficulty at Tientsin. The Eries
eeemed to have arpealed to the favor of the
foreigners j n response tu the late notable up
ward movement here yesterday, and th<.y en-
Joyed a gooj share of the opening strength, but
j-rofit-taking sales were jjarticularly directed
tÂ».a.:..-t them atterwatd, and their reaction had
a large influence in bringing about the subse
quent degression In the general market. The
local municipal stocks were under decided
pressure and ar-narenily a very large line of
tl-eculalive holdings of all the principal mem
bers ot the group were liquidated, making
heavy inroads u:>on their Drices. Attempts
Mil made to raid the market by advancing
Individual stocks here and there, but they were
only indifferently successful, serving as a cover
lor continued realizing. The heavy tone in
liurliiigton since the first of the week has had
a marked mflutnee on the general market so
that it was jjk-ked out as an effective rally
ing point and was bid up within a quarter of
last Monday's liith level. It fell back 2"-i
l<oints, however, and closed with a net gain
of only a fraction. Among the leading rail
road stucks the only really substantial strength
was Â»hoÂ»n by the trunk lines and by the
Wabai>h iK&ues. Pennsylvania led the former
Knmp with an extreme advance of 2 points.
iteiKirts of a tralflc so large as to tax laclli
tifcs and of higher rates to come on grain were
the grounds oÂ£ the advance. Pennsylvania was
the only member cf the group that held well.
The buying of the Wabash stocks waÂ« on a
very heavy scale and all offerings were con-
Cdertly absorbed. The preferred was carried
up an extreme SvÂ», closing at the top, and the
common gained 1Â»Â«. Nothing deanite Is known
as to the uource of the buying, but the bÂ«llef
continues that the property is destined to ab
sorption by another system. There was some
continued show of strength among the group
of mtnor railroad urcr>erties which have been
recently prominent, but none of them was
veil held. The Denver and Rio Grande stocks
moved ujÂ» 4% for the common and 3U for the
preferred on the belief that they will pass Into
tlie control of the Missouri Pacific. Northern
1'acific'roEe <> points without any news. West
ern I'nion moved up over 2 points; American
Car Vk. and the preferred of the latter cor
poration r%Â» on rumors of consolidation. Inter
national Paper rose 3 and the 2<4 on a reported
working agreement with a competitor. Sugar

Special reports telegraphed this week Indi
cate that the winter wheat crop is in good
condition and an unusunlly hfavv acreage was
planted at the Southwest, while . ravages Â¦ by
the Hessian -fly have been exaggerated. " .
Failures for the wee* numbered 221 in the
United States, against 1^-3 last year, and 33 In
Canada, against 27 last year.
The. amount of cotton coming forward at
the South Indicates that -plantation stocks are
by no means exhausted and preparations for
the new crop promise au enormous acreage.
Footwear is -firmly maintained for staple
lines, although hish-priced grades are easier.
Some decrease. In demand does not disturb pro
ducers as factories are busy on contracts that
will require months to till. Buyers who left
Boston recently are now sending in orders
freely. Especially, is thÂ» notice in the local
market for patent and enamel shoes. Leather
Is in good demand, but quotations are un
changed. Hides at Chicago have declined
steadily for two montJis,- the net fall in the
average of ten grades amounting to 7.2 per
cent. Despite the weakness in domestic lines
foreign hides are tendlns upward.
NEW YORK, March 22.-R. G. Dun &.Co.'s
Weekly, Review of Trade .'to- morrow will say:
The position of general business Is satisfactory,
being marked this week by Â¦ Increased activity
of retail concerns throughout the West and in
some Atlantic seaboard cities, which Is con
sidered the forerunner 'of a generally good
spring trade. New enterprise Is reflected In
the largest demand for many months for build
ers' hardware i and general materials and con
tracts for prompt delivery of all structural
goods are very difficult to place. Collections
are prompt and railroad tonnage is well main
tained. Earnings : of all railroads for the
month of March to date show a gain of. 10.8
per cent over last, year and 38 per Cent over
1S99. The gains extend to practically the whole
country. The textile industry alone does not
improve Short time has been adopted . by the
Fall Riv*r cotton mills and there are reports
that some of the Southern weaving mills are
about to curtail production, but this has been
without special effect upon demand for either
print cloths or- heavy brown cottons.
Quotations of pig iron and finished steel tend
toward a higher level. There is still the whole
eorne element of conservatism, which prevents
violent fluctuations and keeps the advance at
a moderate rate, but the tendency of the mar
ket is undeniably toward better things. The
most conspicuous strength Is apparent In Bes
semer pig.- which, now commands $17 at Pitts
burg, while steel Â¦ billets have sold at $24 and
high carbon billets reached $30. Steel bars are
$1 per ton "higher and structural shapes are
firmly maintained, with -every expectation â¢ of
an advance. While the&e quotations show mod
erate gains much higher rates are paid for
Immediate .delivery and In small amounts. A
short time ago it was expected that new ore
prices would be - much Â¦ lower,- but the remark
able strength of products will tend tÂ« sustain
values of the raw material. New high records

ington, 8300 tons; two from Oregon, 570 tons;
four from Australia, 12,804 tons; total. 31.333
tons." The deliveries are somewhat less than
khe- quantity consumed, but the generou3 ar
rivals of last week win make good the de
ficiency. Prices are unchanged, and business
for steam grades Is fair, but there is a marked
shrinkage in the demand for domestic uses.

Itself, which means little or no fuel for grates.
But few vessels are being added to the load-
Ing list in foreign ports, showing very clear
ly that the delivery cost of Australian and
English coata will rule so high that within a
year their offerings will be the exception,
not the rule. There Is no branch of com
merce that has been so seriously modified lo
cally within the past twelve months as coal:
this haÂ» been brought about entirely by the
discoveries of fuel oil in several counties of
our State. If the reports emanating from tha
newspapers and interested promoters could bo
verified, the oil output would be double our
requirements, but actual facts will prove
that facts and figures are about as one Is to
four. The colliery proprietors In British Co
lumbia and Washington fully realize their po
sition, and are acting cautiously In not forc
ing shipments."

OAKLAND, March 22.â A." A. Moore
lodged a protest with the City Council
to-night against its continuing the water
rate investigation, upon the ground that
its term of office had expired and that
the new Councilmen-elect were entitled
to their seats.
The protest was made "at the end of a
business session and was the source of
much argument by the various Council
men and Mr. Moore. The attorney for the
Contra Costa Water Company read sec-,
tiens of the charter to show that under
the charter their terms had expired and
that the Councilmen-elect were entitled
to take their seats as soon as they had
received their certificates, taken the oath
of office and filed their bonds.
Several members of the Council took a
contrary view and Assistant City Attor
r.ey Condon gave it as his opinion that
the only point made by Mr. Moore that
might hold was that the provision of the
charter as to when the Council should
take office was so vasrue that the new
Coundlmen might be entitled to office as
soon as they had filed their bonds and
taken the oath. A motion was adopted
that City Attorney Dow furnish the
Council with a written opinion upon thia
point to-morrow evening.
CLAIMS COUKCHiMEN'S
TEEMS HAVE EXPIRED
Attorney Moore Protests Against
Continuing Water Bate Inves
tigation by the City.
It Is Said Prisoner "Will Call Judge
Cook as "Witness at Second
Trial.
A story was circulated yesterday that
-when Mrs. Cordelia Botkin Is placed on
trial again on the charge of having: mur
dered Mrs. John P. Dunning 1 by means of
poisoned candy sent through the mail, she
will endeavor to prove that ehe Is the vic
tim of mistaken identity. On the former
trial it was shown by several witnesses
That Mrs. Botkin had purchased a box of
candy and a handkerchief similar to the
onÂ«r$ pent Mrs. Dunning. It was mainly
on this testimony that a conviction was
secured. According to the ptory now told.
Mrs. Botkin will rely to a great extent
on the testimony given by Superior Judge
Cook, before whom she wa* tried, at the
time an inv-stigatton was made- by the
Sheriff of a charge that she was out on
the street after her conviction and sen-
Tfr.ce to life imprisonment.
Judge Cook was" positive that h* met
hÂ«Â»r in a car. The jail officials, on the
other hand, denied that she was ever out
Â«=:dÂ«Â» the jail except when being taken to
rri;rt. Mrs. Botkin argues that if the
Jrdge before whom she was on trial for
many lonsr and weary necks could mis
take another woman for her, how much
mere easily mistaken could be the wit
nesses who swore to selling her the candy
and handkerchief.
Attorney C J. Heg-g-erty. -who was asso
ciated with George A. Knight in the de
fer.se of Mrs. Botkin on the first trial,
raid last night that the value of Judge
<:ook's testimony had never been dis
cussed.
"I do not know how the story got Into
circulation." said he, "and I would rather
not discuss it. In the flrst place I do not
think that the testimony suggested would
be permissible. Judge Cook only claims
that he saw Mrs. Botkin in a car after
the trial. Now, that has nothing to do
with the case. It Is not improbable that
we will withdraw from the defense before
the next trial, as we are now overrun with
other busine?;?."
Judge Cook briefly discussed the matter
by saying that if he was called as a wit
ness he would testify that he was not mis-
Taken when he said he met Mrs. Botkin
In the car.

The Union Iron "Works haa declCed to
Fubstltute oil for coal as fuel, and with
this end In view has contracted for a
Three yeara' supply of the Suid product.
It is estimated that IOO.OoO barrels of oil a
year will be required. The engineer force
of the Union Iron Works will make the
necessary alterations in the furnaces pre
liminary to the substitution.
The decision of the Union Iron "Works
management to use oil for fuel Is not a
sudden impulse, but the- result of a thor
ough investigation into the merits of the
new fuel. It was found that It waa not
only superior to coal in cleanliness, heat

PRESIDENT A. T. HADLEY OF YALE
SAYS CHANLER
IS IN EUROPE
Detective Satisfied Million
airÂ© Asylum Patient
Went Abroad.
Rumor That His Former Wifa,
Amelie Rives, Will Join THm
and Look After His
Health,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WHITE PLAINS, N. Y., March 23.â It
is now firmly believed ' that John Arm
strong Chanler', the millionaire and form
er husband of Amelle Rives, now Princess
Troubetskoy, who escaped from Bloom
lngdale Asylum at White Plains on
Thanksgiving day last, sailed for Europe
shortly after his escape. Superintendent
Lyons', of Bloomingdale said to-day that
he had not heard from Chanler since tfie
day of his escape.
From a reliable source It was learned
that the millionaire has wealthy frienQ*
in Europe and that on the day he disap
peared he mailed a letter to London. A
detective, who has been looking for Chaii
ler, says he. Is sure he went to Europe
in order to get out of the clutches of tho
asylum authorities and the friends who
are anxious to keep him in the institution.
Princess Troubetskoy, who has almost
fully recovered from a nervous disease.
Is living at her country retreat at Rich
mond, Va_ It is reported that she ex
pects' to leave next month for Europe,
where she will spend the remainder of
the year. Â¦ According to press dispatches
she Intends to resume her literary labors
In some European city, but some of Char
ter's friends are of the opinion that she
may be going to meet him and look after
his health. At the asylum it . is stated
Chanler frequently talked about his di
vorced wife and told one of the attend
ants only a short time before he ran
away that he hoped a reconciliation
might - be - effected. He spoke about a
desire of taking a trip to Paris.
HOSPITAL ANHEX
FOB THE SCHOOLS
For Treatment of Pupils
Who May Be Hurt or
Taken Sick.
Rooms to Be Set Aside Will Be Pro
vided With Red Cross Out
fits and Steamer
Chairs.
* ALAMBDA, March 22.â A hospital annex
for each of the five schools of Alamed*
is the latest move In the line of progres3
for the educational department of the city.
The Board of Education has decided to
set aside a room at a convenient plactt
In the school buildings wherein will bo
placed Red Cross emergency outfits and
steamer chairs for .the relief of pupln
who may be hurt or taken suddenly til.
"It is only once In a great while that
we have an accident of any consequence
in the schools," said Superintendent of.
Schools Charles E. Hughes, who advo
cates the hospitals, "but these emergency
outfits are good things to have around.
We ican never tell what Is going to hap
pen next. A boy may fall downstairs or
from a tree or run against another in tha
yard. If he srets cu: or stunned he can
be taken to the annex and bandaged up
or revived. It does not do to takÂ« chil
dren home to their mothers when they are
hurt and bleeding because It unnecessarily
alarms them. There waa the case of a boy
in' the' Haight School the other day who
was cut up a little by being struck with
something. When he was taken home his
mother became frantic and laid the blama
for the accident upon the school authori
ties. If the boy had been treated and then,
sent home it would have been all right.
"But most of- the cases we have to deal
with in the schools arts those of teachers
or girls who faint or become suddenly ill.
For these the steamer chair will be Just
the thing. They can rest In it until they
become strong enough to go home or re
sume their work. As it Is now there Is no
place to put such patients."
The Red Cross emergency outfit consists
of bandages and one or two stimulating;
medicines. The bandages are antiseptic,
so that no bad results are likely to fol
low the binding of a wound, as might ba
the case if a handkerchief was used..

Mrs. Standeford was born in Indiana in
1834. She was graduated from Oberlln
College while a young" girl. Soon after the
close of the Civil War, in. which her hus

tinction, Mr. and Mrs. Standeford cams
to California. They have lived in Oakland
ever since. Mr. Standfcford is employed in
the San Francisco Mint. . Mrs. John. F.
Conners is their daughter.
Aside from this special field of activity
Mrs. Standeford's efforts were untiring- In
aid of the needy throughout the city. Her
benefactions were not institutional and
she avoided the publicity of leadership In
organized charities.
So tactful and unobtrusive were her la
bors that their extent was known onlr to
her most Intimate friends. .
During her thirty years' residence in
this city Mrs. Standefcrd's sterling quali
ties and gracious personality endeared ner
to, thousands who participated in or wero
the beneficiaries of her unostentatious
charities- and faithful teachings. .
Mrs. Standeford was best known to th<Â»
public as the principal cf the Grove-street
School. She fulfilled the duties of this po
sition for many years. Her remarkaolo
endowments of intellect and character
gave her an influence oulte unique in her
chosen work. Not content with insistently
upholding before teachers and pupils the
loftiest ideals of mind and heart culture
Bhe interested herself in the home Ufa
of the> different families represented in the
institution of which she was the bead.
Her strong help for a_id tender sympathy
with the poor and troubled among her
charges are traditional in the Grove-street
School district.

William M. Mendenhall has dlaeovered Â«n the
south side of the Jesus Maria Creek and two
miles from Jesus " Maria an Iron ; mine . which
contains a larg-e deposit : of .iron -ore and can
be traced for thousands â¢ of feet. Analysis of
the > ore .was given and a test made i some
twenty years ago. and the result was' 90; per

ore. If It proves satisfactory then a plant will

- The Stockton Independent reports that

Various News Notes.
The statement of the mill for 1878 show* that
1644 tons of ore were treated, containing 872.
021.9 ounces of ' silver and 64.4 ounces of gold,
with 257,112 pounds of lead, an average of 234
ounces silver and 8 per cent lead. The aver
age ore produced to-day Is from 100 to ISO
ounces silver to the ton i and for ore of that
grade the miner - of twenty-two years ago re
ceived net an average of $70 per ton, while to
day he will receive not far from $76 per ton.
Charles H. Morris of Georgetown, Colo.,
writes to show that the silver miner, con
sidering the difference in the cost of treat
ment, receives more . for his ore to-day,
when sliver is worth. 60 cents per ounce,
than he did In 1S79, when It was quoted
at. $118 per ounce.- He bases his compu
tations I on the operations of the * Rocky
Mountain Sampling Works at George
town. Morris makes this statement:
The Redding Free Press says that the
new dredger that is being built at Trinity
Center will be in running order, in about
a month. It will have four large and two
small engines. It differs from other dredg
ers used on the coast. One feature is. the
safety, clutch for working rocky ground.
When the bucket strikes an obstruction
the clutch acts . as a brake and relieves
the machinery of the strain that would
otherwise cause a. break. Trinity Center
and vicinity, says the Free Press, contain
several thousand acres of good dredging
ground. At Brapdons. several miles be
low the Center, Mr. Herring of Orovillo
will commence to prospect the ground
â¢with a Keystone drill at once, and if the
results are. satisfactory a dredger .will be
placed there.
E. B. Gage, manager, and W. F. Staun

porter that there had been objection to
the combination of interests and that the
plan In view is the bonding of groups upon
which he has secured options. Eastern
men will go to Tombstone to look Into the
situation and consider the outlook.
New Dredger at Trinity Center.
. As spring Is breaking in upon us the mining
outlook for Mono County, and particularly In
the Bridgeport , District, , is very encouraging,
negotiations for the transfer of some of 'our
nearby promising claims being under way, and
to good companies that mean business. An*S a
number of claims that wefe worked last Bum
mer with flattering results will be worked with
renewed energy and more "heartily the coming
summer, so that by next fall we may have
several mines opened to an. extent to warrant
the erection of proper plants to make them
paying "properties. The heavy amount of snow
on our mountains Is gratifying to our placer
miners, who are anticipating rich returns from
their Â¦ work next summer. If this county pos
sessed proper transportation facilities our mar
ble and travertine quarries would be bee hives
of Industry, as our marbles are the finest in
the world, according to the best juries of
mnrble, and so Is our travertine, which Is
far superior to the French article, that coun
try being the only one that Â¦ possesses, this
beautiful material for ornamental marble pur
poses- until the Bridgeport, quarry was dis
covered and opened, ln'oonnectlon with a great
aeposlt of onyx, which "would also be very
valuable with transportation facilities. If
Mono County could have an Influx of intelligent
prospectors this summer. we believe our people
would be astonished at the \aluab1e discoveries
they would make before * next fall. -Borne of
the "kids" of this generation will live to see
Mono Â¦ County one of the richest mining coun
ties in this State. . .
There is an optimistic ring to the say
ings of the Bridgeport Chronicle-Union
concerning the outlook for the miners of
Mono County: . - .
A writer -in the .Victoria Daily. Colonist
has an amusing account of the attempt
of the smelter trust to remove the com
petition of the Canadian smelters. One of
tne moves, according to the writer, was
to threaten to temporarily withdraw from
the British Columbia lead market and
leave the Canadian producers without any
market. The Canadian Pacific Railway
came to the rescue of the lead miners and
placed a very large amount of their pro
ducts, in the Cast and in the West Koota
nay country. "And,", -Bays.- the writer,
"the miners will receive practically ae
good rates as they received during the
year 1900, when the American Smelting
and Refining Company took over 50 per
cent of these 'ores." The . Canadians are
hoping that the Canadian Government
will put a bounty of $5 per ton on Cana
dian pig lead, which would help to' firmly
establish the smelting industry of British
Columbia and create a healthy demand
for a large tonnage of low grade dry ore3,
which are necessary to mix with the lead
ores In the smelting process. ; : .
Fighting Smelter Competition.
Only the few Initiated oneÂ« were permitted
to. watch the process and note the results, but
the mouths of those who could give Intelligent
information on the subject were kept tightly
closed. Now, however, > the tests . have been
made and the matter has gone beyound the ex
perimental stage. The procesa has fulfilled
every expectation of the world's most famous
Inventor and it Is reported . that a decision
has been reached to erect a large mill, con
structed on thÂ« same principles, at Dolores,
and that the .machinery has already been or
dered. , The new mill Is to have a capacity Of
300 tons daily, ' and It will be a full year In
building.
If" the experiments prove remunera
tive, then it appears to be probable that
another source of great wealth is In sight
and that the mining industry Is . about to
enter into another interesting phase.
If the Albuquerque Journal-Democrat is
not misinformed, a large l . mill will be
erected at Dolores,' N. M., to operate un
der the Edison invention for the dry
washing- of auriferous deposits. \A.ll placer
miners throughout the West will be inter
ested in the working of this mill. There
are Vast districts in California, Arizona
and New; Mexico where the lack of. water
has been the^ great obstacle to the full
development of placer ground. .The people
of the southern part of this ' State are
fully aware to this fact. The ' Journal-
Democrat, descrlbine the work that has
been going on at Dolores, says:

From the ninth biennial report of the
coal mine inspector of the State of Wash
ington, which has just been issued, it ap
pears that the coal mined In Washington,
of all grades, in the year 1900 was 2.418,034
snort tons; amounting in value to $4,425,000
in round figures." There were 4238 men em
ployed. Employes received in wages $2.
721,643. The average value of coal at the
mines Is stated to have been Jl"83 per ton,
and the cost of putting it on the train was
about $1 27 per ton. The total value of the
coke produced was $170,000. - The estimated
output of coal from mines that are opened
for the Â¦>Â¦ year ; JS01 : is 8,180,000 tons. From
mines that are being opened 250,000 addi
tional tons -may be produced, or an in
crease over 1900 of 1,000.000 tons in the total
output.- and this is figured as a conserva
tive estimate by the mine Inspector.

JAMES W. ERWIN SHOWS
COLLECTION OF SLIDES
Entertains Large Audience With
Views Taken in China, Japan
and Manila.
The annual pay exhibition of the Call-
fornia Camera Club at the Metropolitan
Temple last night drew a crowd that
taxed the capacity of the hall. The fea
ture of the evening was the exhibition of
snapshots taken in the land of the Chi
nese, .the Japanese and the Filipino by
James W. Erwln, postal inspector. While
exhibiting his slides Mr.' Erwln delivered
a lecture giving a short history of the
countries in which the pictures were
taken. . ' . . . : . ,
Mr. Erwin Is a very pleasant talker, and
held the attention of the audience during
the entire exhibition. His remarks were
also-desciiptive of the many kinds of peo
ple to be found In China, Japan and Ma
nila. He possesses a great fund of,knowl
edge'concerning these countries and their
people and delivers Jt in a manner that
holds the attention of his audience.
During the intermissions 'the audience
was entertained with selections* by the
Knickerbocker male quartet and a read
ing by Miss. Ada BIbby. .
RESCUED SLAVE GIRLS
GIVE THEIR TESTIMONY
Inform Grand Jury That No Attempt
Was Made by Police to Aid
Them. .
Six slave girls rescued from the Chinese
quarter gave lestimonv yesterday, after
noon before the Grand Jury- Four of them
were from the Presbyterian Mission and
were under the charga of Miss Donaldlna
Cameron. The other, two were escorted to
the Grand Jury rooms by Miss Margaret
Lake of the Methodist Mission. The testi
mony of the girls was in substance the
same as given before the legislative
committee several weeks ago. They testi
fied that they â¢ had . been held in bondage
and that no effort waÂ« made by the police
to rescue them. It devolved on the agents
cf the Chinese missions to aid them in
escaping. A Chinese babe two years old,
rescued from a house of ill repute several
months ago, accompanied Miss Cameron's
party of rescued slaves. . . /. ;
After listening to the testimony of . the
girls the Jurors called Miss Lake and had
her tell the story of the battle in a Jack
son-street den Thursday night, whoa
watchmen employed by the Chinese pro
vented the rescue of a firl who was anx
ious to go to the mission'.
The Investigation Into Chinatown affairs
will be resumed next FTiday. "
FIRE LIMITS ARE TO
BE SLIGHTLY EXTENDED
Ordinance Fixing Inspectors' Fees
for Altsring or Erecting Build
ings Is Kecommended.
The joint Committee on Fire, Judiciary
and Building reported yesterday In favor
of extending the fire limits so as to in
clude the district bounded by Folsom,
Howard, First and Steuart streets, v it
was proposed to make Sutter street the
dividing fire line and also to include Polk
street from Sutter to Jackson, but after
listening to the protests of A. S. Baldwin,
representing the Crocker estate, J. C.
Quinn and P. Boland, representing prop
erty owners on Polk and Sutter streets,
the districts named were eliminated from
the fire limits.
A large number of Interested parties ad
dressed the committee in opposition to the
proposed ordinance fixing a schedule of
inspection fees to be charged "for alter
ing or erecting buildings and providing
for the issuance of permits therefor by
the Board of Works. The committee,
however, denied the protest and recom
mended the ordinance for passage.
Attorney Foulds Informed the commit
tee that the Market- Street Railway Com
pany has agreed to reconstruct the road
way on Bosworth street so that the side
walks thereon will be ten feet In width.
The Civil Service Commission held a
epecial meeting last night for the purpose
of ascertaining from Tax Collector Scott
what he intended to do regarding the ap
lolntment of fourteen deputies from the
wlgible lift, whom he selected on Febru
ary 13 last. Scott did not put in an ap
pearance, but sent a letter instead, which
he ha.d received from his attorney, A.
Ruef. In the letter Huef stated that he
did not have the time to inquire into the
legal questions regarding the differences
Jietween the old deputies and those certi
fied by the commission. He promised to
advise Scott on ihe subject to-day, and
the commission adjourned without taking
any action.
After the meeting President Freud
stated that Scott Is evidently awaiting the
action of the Governor on the Tyrrell bill,
which prevents removals of those officials
who have taken an oath of office. Freud
Bays that if the Governor signs the bill
its constitutionality will 'be tested In the
court. Should he veto or pocket it, Freud
Is of the opinion that Scott will give in
and put the civil service deputies to work.
The Governor has until next Wednesday
to sicn the bill.

Policemen Herring and Mangan were
Attacked by twenty cavalrymen on Green
wich street, near Baker, a few minutes
before midnight Thursday. The policemen
were forced to draw their clubs and use
them freely upon their assailants. The
cavalrymen retreated, but returned to the
affray in a few minutes. The officers were
then forced to draw their revolvers to de
fend themselves, which ha'd the effect of
making the cavalrymen again beat a pre
cipitous retreat.-
Herring was .badly beaten and Mangan
was struck several times on the face and
bedy. He was not so seriously Injured as
Herring and was able to appear in Judge
Cabaniss' court yesferday and swear to
complaints for the arrest of three of the

William F. Herrln,: chief counsel of the
Southern Pacific Company, returned yes
terday from a flying trip to "Washington,
D. C. He left San Francisco a little less
than three weeks ago and returns satis
fied ' with ' his trip, but the nature .of his
business I he declines to state.
"From my observations, I believe that
California is attracting the attention of
the Eastern people," said Mr. Herrln last
night.' "A visitor â¢ from this State is be
sieged with questions as to its resources,
cllmafe and other matters of interest. I
think the next decade will see a wonder
ful increase in our business. I look for
a great gain in Oriental trade. .
"â¢I went East over the Central Pacific
line and encountered snow, Ice and bliz
zards. I returned over the Sunset route
and there found a most striking change
of. climate. Kverythlng was green, flow
ers were blooming and an overcoat was
needless. It was just like a California
spring day all the way.
"While In Washington I had the pleas
ure of meeting President McKlnley. He
Is enthusiastic over his prospective trip
to this coast, and I am sure that we will
realize our gain later. With the Influx
of so many prominent people that will
accompany him, I = cannot but be Im
pressed with the fact that future legisla
tion in the halls of Congress will redound
to Â¦ our material benefit." Â¦
-Regan"ng the recent changes In the
manage/:; ;nt of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, Sir. 1 ' Herrln declined ' to enter into
any extended discussion.
"A comparison with Eastern roads," he
said, "will result favorably to our system.
True, we have not the population to draw
upon as have the roads running through
the more closely settled regions of the
Eastern States, but In operation we a"Ve
equal to them. An aggressive forward
policy will likely- be followed by the new
management, based on the demands of
traffic." . : .
United States Immigration Inspector
North and United States Attorney Wood
worth held a conference yesterday upon
the subject of Chinese female slavery in
this district and the mode of abolishing it.
Both gentlemen came to the conclusion
that It will be a difficult matter for the
Federal authorities to accomplish their
object for the reason that nine out of
every ten of the. female chattels are so
by choice and that the others will deny
the fact that they are slaves.
All that can be done by the Federal
authorities would be to arrest all Chinese
women residing in houses of ill-fame on
a charge of being illegally In the country.
Then the women will produce their pa
pers showing that they have a right to
be here, and this will necessitate their
discharge. The only hope that anything
may be accomplished by making such ar
rests is that some of the women may have
gained a landing through false represen
tations, in which event they, will be de
ported.
The Federal raid of three years ago waa
mentioned as an instance of Chinese meth
ods of working. In that raid twenty-seven
women were arrested and all produced
their papers. They were released.
It is the unanimous opinion of the Fed
eral officials that the police can abate the
evil by arresting these women for vag
rancy and placing a police blockade at the
entrance of the houses with instructions
to arrest all male visitors under the State
laws. This Is the way the police drove
white girls out of Chinatown some years
ago and the only effective way by which
they drive lewd women out of respecta
ble nelshborhoods. If the Chinese slaves
are not permitted to ply their vocation
they will become unprofitable and thus
lose their commercial value.
. It was agreed that nothing would be
done In the matter until the return of
United States Marshal Shine from the
East. Â¦ . .

to a crowded house. The brilliant pianist
outdid herself and aroused overwhelming
enthusiasm. . The first number on the pro
gramme was the "Moonlight" sonata of
Beethoven. It was rendered with a rich,
warm sympathy, delicate pathos and bril
liant execution that gave fullest value to
each phase of the beautiful movements.
The Chopin group was given with utmost
grace, and consisted of the Nocturne op.
37, No. 2; the Barcarolle (by request), A
.Hat Etude and the A flat Ballade. There
was also a Schubert group, the charm-
Ing A flat "Impromptu," the picturesque
."Soiree de "Vienne.'V Schubert-LJszt, and
the Schubert-Tausig "Marche Mllitaire,"
which simply carried .the audience off its
feet. Twomumbers new here; a delight
ful Oriental tone poem. "An Arabian
Night." and a "Scherzino" of Regina
"Watson's, were much enjoyed; the beau
tiful Tschaifcowsky "Nocturne" was re
peated by special request, and the sixth
"Hungarian Rhapsodle" of Liszt, which
was clven heroic rendering, roused the
audience to the highest pitch of enthusi
asm.
Mme. Carreno graciously responded to
two encores, giving her own graceful little
"waltz" and the Chopin "Berceuse."
She leaves this morning for the north.

Important "duty assigned to the health of

Negotiations are going on which prob
ably will result in an agreement between
the Alaska Commercial Company, the
Alaska Exploration Company, the North

Company of Seattle, the Ames Mercantile

causes of difference will be done away
with during the life of the compact. This
much is admitted by gentlemen whose
connection with the corporations that
have been mentioned gives them informa
tion of the progress of negotiations. At
the same time they strenuously deny that
an agreement on all points has yet been
reached. Â¦ , , .
There was trouble of various kinds on
the Yukon River and at Cape Nome last
year There were differences concerning
lighterage. Passenger rates were slashed
and competition in supplying the needs of
the miners was quite keen. Then strikers
interfered with the plans that were
made. Altogether, so say the transpor
tation and trading companies, the con
ditions were unsatisfactory.
Recently Seattle business men have been
In San Francisco, trying to bring about an
agreement for the common benefit of the
steamship men and the supply agencies.
It was advanced here as an argument that
San Francisco Interests would profit by
having uniform rates, and this has ap
peared to strike the local parties most
In interest \o be the fact. The North
American Commercial Company Is not in
cluded in the parties conferring, and Is
not concerned because it deals only *ln
ccal at Dutch Harbor, and has no interest
in the general trade in provisions and sup
plies for the north. When the agreement
is In operation the trade of Cape Nome.
Port Clarence, St. Michaels, Dawson and
the river trade of the YuLon generally
will be regulated to the satisfaction of all
the companies. The bulk of the trade of
the north and-far northwest Is carried on
by the five companies mentioned in the
foregoing.

CHINATOWN of San Francisco Is
about to receive what It has long
neededâ thorough cleansing and
fumigation. The topic was fully
discussed at the Palace Hotel yes
terday in a prolonged conference, In.whlch
Governor Gage, Mayor Phelan, Henry T.
Scott and others participated.
The Call has heretofore' insisted, that
vigorous sanitary measures should be
adopted to cleanse and purify the Chinese
quarter. Then the objection waa raised
that the city had no money to pay for
the clean-up. At the conference yester
day the lack of funds. was again put for
ward hi- the Mayor as an excuse for de
laying the proposed work. After,long and
earnest discussion of the various meas
ures to provide the necessary funds, the
Governor came to the rescue of the mu
nicipal authorities with a proposition to
advance the money from the sum recently
appropriated by the Legislature to insure
the enforcement of sanitary regulations
in California; This offer was readily ac
cepted. s 1 *^:*
It Is understood that the clean-up In
Chinatown will be systematic and effec
tive. The health authorities, under whoso
direction the work must be prosecuted,
will not merely eradicate a bad spot here
and there and then abandon operations;
on the contrary, the scope of fumigation
and general sanitation will embrace the
entire district which is densely populated
by Chinese. The work will not be sus
pended until Chinatown is clean. The
NORTHERN LINES
MAKING COMPACT
COPYISTS FEAR
NEW EXAMINATION
Book Typewriting Machines
in the Recorder's Office
the Cause.
Civil Service Commission "Will In-
quire Into legality of Innova
tion Which Is Not Coun
tenanced by Charter.
The attention of the Board of Civil
Service Commissioners will be directed in,
a few days to the proposed introduction
of books typewritten by machines in the
Hall of Records with a view to determin
ing the legality- of the records copied In
that manner. Fifteen machines are now
being operated on trial and the results are
far from satisfactory, according to the
searchers of records, who are best quall
ned to Judge. Recorder Godchaux Intends
to ask for ail appropriation of $4000 In the
next tax budget . to purchase the ma
chines outricht.
The copyists employed in the office are
afraid that if the machines are adopted
the Civil Service Board may order new
examinations for typewriters, and this
would result in some of them losing their
positions. In the United States Civil
{Service separate examinations are held
lor typewriting clerks.
While r.b action has yet been taken by
the municipal commission. Its attention
not having been officially called to the
contemplated innovation in the Record
er's oRice. the subject will be discussed
ct the next meeting.
The point at issue is on the Interpreta
tion of the charter provision, Â¦which says:
'â¢The Recorder may appoint as many
copyists us he may deem necessary, who
thall receive not more than S cents for
each one hundred words actually writ
ten." The term "actually written" is
taken by 6ome to mean written by hand.
The exclusion of the word "typewritten"
would seem to preclude the use of type
writing machines.
There era at present twenty copyists
employed in the Recorder's office, and It
es claimed that the use of the machines
v.-lli result in cutting down the force at
least one-half, as the records can be
bopied in much less time by machine.
On tho other hand, searchers say that
fince the typewriters have been intro
duced it has been necessary to recopy 120
Instruments on account of mistakes or
emissions. Erasures are frequent, and
the danger from changes In the name of
the grantor or grantee after the record
t.&s been finally passed is apparent. Ex
posure to the sun and air, It is contended,
will render the records Illegible after a
errtajn period. Altogether It is a knotty
question, which the Civil Service Com
mjtsion Â¦will be called upon to decide
should the typewriting machines be al
lowed by the Supervisors. Not the least
important v.Ul be whether a new examin
ation should be ordered for typewriting
machine clerks, as the one held for copy
ists was on entirely different lines.
POLICEMEN STUDY
FOR EXAMINATION
Steps Being Taken to Test
Candidates Who Want
Promotion.
Civil, Service Commissioners "Will
Shortly Submit Rulss for the Ap
proval pf the Board of Police
- Commissioners.
Sergeants, corporals and patrolmen In
the Police "Department are all agog over
the forthcoming examination before the
Civil Service Commissioners for promo
tion. They, are busy thinking over what
they learned at school and storing their
minds with problems In arithmetic and
other elementary subjects. Some of them,
such as Sergeant Conboy, are calmly
awaiting the ordeal, but' others are losing
flesh through worry and deep study.
The adjourned meeting between the Civil
Service Commissioners and Police Com
missioners to decide upon subjects of ex
amination and marks to be allowed for
"distinguished service," "highly meritori
ous service" and "good and efficient ser
vice" was to have been held yesterday
afternoon In the office of the Police Com
missioners, but there Â¦was no quorum.
Those present were Police Commissioner
Mahoney and Civil Service Commissioner
Freud, besides . Chief Sullivan and the
secretaries of "the two boards.
The matter was talked over informally
and it was decided. that the Civil Service
Commissioners would, submit the rules
governing the examination with marks for
service of the three grades shortly to the
Police Commissioners, for their approval,
so . that the examination, mental and
physical, can be held in the near future.
They were provided with a list of the
sergeants in the order of seniority which
had been prepared' by Clerk Cadwalader.
It was understood that "if an applicant had
been fined by the board for infractions of
the rules of the department so many
marks would be deducted. Another point
was that sergeants and patrolmen who
were not on street duty had not the same
chance of distinguishing themselves and
an allowance should be made for them.
There are at present six lieutenants and
according to the charter there should be
ten. There are forty-three sergeants, and
there should be fifty,' and 505 patrolmen
where there should be 6S4. There are also
thirteen corporals.
Upper Court Overrules Exception of
His Attorney to the Return
of" the Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper, was
Jubilant yesterday . morning ' when Po
lice Judge Fritz decided that -he
could not be held to answer before
the Superior Court on . the charge
of forging the seal of the "High Court of
Chancery, London, England," to thÂ© pur
ported will of Miss Chadwlck. The Judge
held that the burden of proof that such a
court of record was in existence was upon
the pro-jecution and they had failed to da
bo. He did not think It necessary to go
Into the question as to whether any one
had been defrauded or deceived by; Coop
er's use of the seal. If the complaint had
stated "purporting to be a seal of a court
of record" the caso might have been dif
ferent.
The proceedings on the writ of habeas
corpus for Cooper's release wero com
menced before Judge Cook ' yesterday
morning. . Assistant District Attorney
Deuprey asked fora continuance till the
testimony taken before Judge Fritz could
bo transcribed by the stenographer of the
court. The stenographer was allowed ten
days, and the time will not elapse for five
days yet. ' ' . , \
Attorney Murphy, â¢ for the defendant,
took an exception to the sufficiency of
the, return made to the writ on the ground
that the complaint against the defendant
did not state sufficient facts to consti
tute a crime. He argued that the meaning
of deceiving or detrauding a person by
sending a- l'alse or forged telegram was
in regard to something material. In this
case there was nothing material, only the
Intent to mnrryv
The Judge said he did not want to hear
any argument from the Assistant District
Attorney, as he was satisfied the inten
tion of the Legislature was to punish peo
ple for forging a telegram with the. object
of deceiving or defrauding another per
son. He referred .to the difference In the
.punishment prescribed for forgery proper
and for lorgins a telegram In suppot of
hla contention. He thought there was
sufficient In the complaint to constitute a
crime and he overruled the exception.
It was ihen agreed that the argument
on the evidence would bo made Tuesday
morning, by which time tha testimony
will have been transcribed.
A rumor was circulated yesterday that
Nora Schneider had been married before
ehÂ© hiet Cooper and had not been divorced
from her husband, but the police laugh at
it and eay that It emanated from Cooper
for obvious reasons.

opinion that: the: Mayor is empowered to

Leske Tells of His Loss.
The preliminary examination of John
Hansen on a charge of grand larceny was
commenced before 'Judge . Conlan yester
day. Hansen is accused of having
"steered" . Herman Leske to a. room on
Taylor street, where Leske parted 'witn
$545. Leske explained how he was ac
costed by Hansen on March 14 and In
duced to: go to the room and how he
thought he - had a . good hand In a poker
game, but found that another man- had a
better one. For the' defense It was
claimed that Hansen. after Leske lost his
money/asked him to go back to the room
and he would: get the -men to return -It.
but Leske -refused. The .Judge will give
his decision Monday.
The Southern Paclfio Company has
"kept tab" carefully on Miss Helen
Ellis for several months, and the result
of the detective work of the great corpora
tion was made apparent yesterday on thÂ©
cross examination of thÂ© fair plaintiff by
Joseph Dunn, counsel for the corporation.
Miss Ellis is pale of visage and slight of
frame, and she is trying to convince a
Jury in the. United States Circuit Court
that the railroad company owes her $50,000
for injuries which she alleges she received
last July by the derailing of a Pullman
car between Delta and Gibson. :
Her counsel, Mr. Learning, placed her on
the stand to tell of the disastrous effects
of the shakeup. She said that up to the
time of the accident her health had been
perfect, and she enjoyed social pleasures,
literary pursuits and square meals with
equal gusto. After the accident, she said,
she lost her appetite, became hysterical,
melancholy and troubled with Insomnia
to such an extent that she was obliged to
sit up until between 1 and 2 o'clock in the
morning before she could go to sleep.
In addition" to these destructive changes
Miss Ellis swore that she could no longer
read solid literature with the same degree
of mental concentration as formerly and
that she was unable to continue her vo
cation as a teacher of elocution. Her Hie
since the accident, she declared, was a
bleak desert of nervous and Intellectual
misery and starvation, without a single
oasis of comfort and repose.
Then Mr. Dunn took the lady gently in
hand for the purpose of cross-examina
tion After inquiring Into the visible In
juries sustained by the lady, consisting
of a bruised shoulder and hip and a. cut
lip and forehead. Mr. Dunn turned his at
tention to her mode of life In Hanford for
several months after the accident. From
a carefully prepared - memorandum he
asked a series of questions that showed
that every movement of the plaintiff had
been closely watched by persons in the
interest of the railroad company. For
instance as an evidence of her hearty ap
petite he. directed her attention to the
three square meals she atÂ© dally in the
Hotel Artesia at Hanford, to her consump
tion on a certain occasion of a wad of llm
burger cheese and a plate of sour pickles,
to her roaming the hills on hunting ex
cursions, her attendance at the theater,
her remaining up until midnight and after
at card parties, to her winning the sec
ond prize in a progressive euchre party
as showing that the accident had not im
paired her mental faculties, and to the
fact that during all the months that she
spent In Hanford she had never asked for
or obtained medical attendance, and that
far from being melancholy she laughed
and -Jested at the. hotel table as merrily
as the gayest of them.
The witness admitted all the facts ex
cept the eating of the llmburser. She said
that It had been sent to her table by some
friends at another table and that she had
pretended to eat it.

Appttite Is Big Enough
