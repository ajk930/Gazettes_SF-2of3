BEITISH WOUNDED ABANDONED
LONDON. July 12.â There was a noisy
pession in the House of Commons arising
from a question as to whether the British
wounded were left In the hands of the
Boers at Vlakfontein. Lord Stanley,
Financial Secretary of the War Office, de
clared the War Office had no Information
on the subject, but John Dillon, Irish Na
tionalist, backed up by the cheers and
ehouts of the Nationalists, plied'' Lord
Stanley with questions until the Speaker
intervened.
As Dillon declined to give way the
Speaker reproved him, but after a con
siderable uproar a compromise was
reached, Dillon giving notice that he will
repeat his questions Monday- .
to decorate their places of business in
some appropriate manner. If nothing else
is provided, he asks that the league col
- ors of red, white and yellow be displayed
in some form or other. A compliance with
this appeal, he adds, will be heartily ap
preciated not only by the committee but
by the thousands of visitors for whose
benefit the decorations are now being pro
vided.

"It is marvelous." he exclaimed again

"At 3 o'clock this morning the balloon
was guided during a period of perfect

'Let go' were â¢ uttered by 21. Santos-Du

balloon. There is not room In it for an
aeronaut much bigger than its designer.
, "The words were the signal for the. com
mencement" of a series of experiments of
.the most, conclusive character, which sur
passed in importance any that have been
made from the days of Montgolfler up to
the present time. Six consecutive times
the aeronaut made a complete circuit of
the Longchamps racecourse, a distance of
3600 meters.
Speed of the Airship.
"It was proved that the "airship has an
average speed of forty kilometers per
hour; " that it answered its rudder ,with
the most perfect, obedient docility, and
that the problem of landing was solved,
each voyage round the course rigorously
ending with a descent at a spot in Pelouse
indicated beforehand.
"It returned time and time again to a

"When II. Santos-Dumont had accom

Then he turned round sharply and cams
back to the starting point before the
tribunes.
Circles the Eiffel Tower.
"After taking a fresh supply of petro
leum he made off toward the Eiffel Tower
and reached it, a distance of five kilomet
ers, in ten minutes. "While over the
Champ3 de Mars a slight accident to his
rudder compelled M. Santcs-Dumont to
come down In Trocadero Gardens. A tall
ladder was very obligingly brought by
some workmen and M. Santos-Dumont
climbed up It to repair the defective part.
When this had been done he started off
again, swept ; completely round the Eiffel
Tower and came back at a breakneck
speed to the tribunes on the Longchamps
racecourse, in order to reassure his
friends, who were jalarmed at his ; long
disappearance. '

NEW YORK, July 12.â There was a
scene of great excitement in both the
wheat and corn markets to-day, the trade
aggregating one of the largest day's to
tals in a year or more. Prices jumped
2% cents during the day in corn, making
(% cents advance for the week. Orders
poured into the market so fast that
brokers could scarcely execute them at the
prices desired, and the usually small
crowd around the corn ring was increased
to such an extent that at times it almost
rivaled that in the wheat pit. .
The farmers have taken the bull side
into their hands and in the face of heavy
realizing on the part of the professionals
have kept prices going- until the cry is for
60*cent corn in Chicago. Where the pres
ent bull movement will end depends a
great deal on weather conditions in the
leading corn States.
â¢ Wheat also took on an extraordinary
Jump to-day, and from being an option
almost entirely friendless at once leaped
to popularity with the bulls and gave
corn a close race fnr leadership In the
matter of advance for the day. Prices at
New York closed 2^'&2%c higher than the
previous night and practically at the top-
Professionals were caught on this bulge
In wheat and some of them lost about all
the money they had made through selling
long corn to the bull public.
For weeks and months wheat has per
sistently been hammered by everybody
on the idea that the crop would be a rec
ord one and more than enough to make
up the foreign shortage. The result has
been a huge short interest, part of which,
was caught in yesterday's big advance.
The remainder is in a state of anxiety as
to what the outcome will be, realizing
that a much greater upturn must mean
the covering of a big line of wheat. To
day the bulls were still further encour
aged by reports that wheat in the ReÂ«l
River Valley was being injured by exces
sive heat after the recent wet weather.
The market showed signs in the after
noon of being- oversold and the bears
bought to cover with some urgency. The
forecasts of a favorable bank statement
to-morrow helped to rally the market. Tha
recoveries ran from 2 to 2% In the prin
cipal active stocks, Wabash preferred anil
Rock Island leading. The market was un
steady at the advance and kept sagging,
but there were no recurrences, of the
acute weakness.

promised much for the grand concert next
Tuesdav evening. Many of the more dif

until a fair degree of perfection was at
tained. The rehearsal vas most satis
factory to the directors. The choruses
rehearsed were as follows:

Some difficulty was experienced in se
curing perfect harmony between the or
pan and the voices. This was due to the
fact that the organ is removed about
eighty feet from the console, 'thereby
causing a slight Iofs of time in the trans
mission of sound from the great instru
ment. This will be overcome after an
other rehearsal by the organist, who will
anticipate the director sufficiently to make
up the discrepancy in time, amounting to
about one-twentieth of a second. The or
ganist last night was W. B. King of Oak
land.
Another rehearsal will be held Monday
evening, and the final one on Tuesday aft

from Los Angeles and other cities in the

Eminent Christian Teacher Talks In-
terestingly of a Former Visit.
"I have not been interviewed for thirty
eight years and I must decline to be in
terviewed now," -said L>r. -J. M. Buckley,
editor of the New York Christian Advo
cate, to a representative of The Call last
night. "Why?" "Well, that is a Ion?
story- I got Into some controversy long
ago by being interviewed. It was not the
fault of the interviewer nor xny. fault. It
was because what I had said was reptrb
lished elsewhere with the questions elimi
nated, giving my language an entirely dif
erent construction." â¢â¢ - â¢ '-
And then Dr.' Buckley, reassured upon
the point, that he would be tempted into
no religious controversy, talked niost en
tertainingly of matters and things.
"I was in California years ago," he said,
"as a traveler for my health. They' told
me then that there was nothing to be
seen in Southern California save a quaint
old Spanish town at Santa Barbara, and
eo I did not go south then. I came through
the south this time, and I assure you
there is much to be seen. It Is a great and
beautiful country. Of course, you know
all that.
"San Francisco has changed, of course.
In the years. I do not know how much.
I only arrived to-night. But there were
only some 75,000 people here when I v:as
here. It is a great city now, and I intend
to see it all. â¢ â¢ â¢â¢;-,Â¦â¢'.
"I will be here, I think, until the 27th of
the month. I am here, as you know, with
the Epworth League, and I am bdokod
for one lecture in Oakland on' Monday
night and for two at Pacific Grove later.
There Is a Chautauqua there. You do not
know, do you, the subject on which I am
to speak at Oakland? I wish you did.

"I had a somewhat peculiar experience,
by the way, on my way out here. I
stopped at Williamsâ in Arizona, you
knowâ on the way out here, and visited
the Grand Canyon from there. The hotel
keeper pledged himself to take care of my
trunk. He did, too. for although half the

chinists decided to-day to give up the
fight for a nine-hour working day and to
apply for reinstatement in the shops of
the Maryland Steel Company, on Mon
day, at the old terms. This brings the

About 1200 men employed in various shop3
laid down their tools, and the majority
of them were granted their demands.
PITTSBURG, July 12.â The second day
of the conference between the Amalga
mated Association of. Iron, Steel and Tin
Workers and the steel manufacturers
came to a close to-night without an agree
ment having been reached. Another ses
sion will be held to-morrow and from in
dications late to-night a settlement of the
general. strike will be decided upon. When
the conference adjourned all of the con
ferees were appealed to for Information as
to the status of affairs, but nothing de
finite could be learned. Late to-night,
however. President Shaffer of the Amal
gamated Association consented to . be
quoted in the following statement:
Nothing actually was accomplished to-day.
No proposition was submitted by either side
to the controversy. No time has been set on
the conferen- 1. but it must come to an end.
To-morrow n-Â»:Â«l settle it one way or another.
If no agreement is reached, the general strike
which was set for last Monday will proceed.
I am still hoping for a settlement.
When asked if in the. event of a strike it
would involve all the plants of the United
States Steel corporation, Shaffer replied
that every union man in every plant in
any way connected with the steel corpa?
ration would be called out. A genera!
strike, if ordered, would include the union
workers in the Federal Steel Company,
the National Steel Company, the Ameri
can Tin Plate Company, the American
Sheet Steel Company, the National Tube
Company and the American Steel Hoop
Company; and all union members in non
union or open mills, aggregating about
60.000 men, would be affected.
It Is believed by conservative steel men
that a compromise will be reached to-mor
row and a strike averted. President Shaf
fer himself, while not stating that he is
prepared to Initiate a compromise, inti
mated that should one come . from the
other side he would gladly meet It half
way and concede anything not cpmpro
mlslng his people. Judge E. H. Gary,
chairman of the steel combine executive
committee, was in the city all day, prac
tically incognito. He dldÂ«not take part in
the conference directly nor did he take
part in. the meeting; but it is learned on
nigh authority to-night that he was nv.
far away from the meeting and was cog
nizant of everything: that transpired.
Without making public In any way the
purpose of his visit here, he left for Chi
cago to-night on the Pennsylvania lim
ited.
That Is a thing that is frequently necessary

not ripe for the Issuing of such a proclamation.
The facts which General MacArthur advanced
in support of his recommendation had already
become matters of consideration with me. At
that time we controlled only a small part of
the' islands.- and had no adequate means of
making such a proclamation . known . to the
natives who were . not under our. immediate
control. . '::Â¦Â¦. Â¦-â¢. . Â¦> ' Â¦
There was no friction between General Mac-
Arthur and myself when I was In command in
the Philippines. General MacArthur was a sub
ordinate officer, and how could there be any
friction between a subordinate officer and his
sunerlor?
General MacArthur once recommended that I
issue a proclamation of amnesty to all who
surrendered and a declaration that any one
who should kill an American soldier thereafter
.would be considered a murderer. I declined to
act on that recommendation. buK don't remem
ber my exact words. I might nave told him
that no further advice on this subject was de
sired by the commanding general.

FRICTION STORY
DENIED BY OTIS
Already about C00 men. have applied for
reinstatement, and many more will do so
to-morrow and Monday.- No official state
.ment has been made by the leaders of the
strikers, and they all refuse to be quoted,
saying that they do not care to do any
thing that might affect the injunction
proceedings agnlnst them, set for hearing
July 15. It is said that the decision to re
turn to work was not unanimous and that
some men -will still hold out.
A meeting of the shop commltteemen of
striking machinists from the various con
cerns affected was held In Workingmen's
Hall to-night. At the conclusion of the
,meeting a statement was given out em
phatically denying the report that the
strike had been called off. It is learned
that while.lt was left discretionary with
the men In a number of shops to return
without any odium being involved as de
serting . the strike, several firms were
picked out on which the fight Is ! to be
prosecuted. Â«The men hvthese shops have
pledged to remain out, and those who re
turn will support them., Should . any or
these shops attempt to transfer their
work it.ov those in which' the men return
the' men'have agreed to refuse to handle
' 'The various shops were visited during
the day by committees of their respective
employes, who made requests for. the
terms under which they would allow them
to v return to work. There were approxi
mately 3500 machinists involved In; the
strike here, and of these the strikers say
about 10 per cent, have already returned.
Those shops affected by the decision of
the union to continue the fight employ
about 1100 men.
WASHINGTON. July 12.â At the head
quarters of the International Association
of Machinists, here President O'C6nneil
admitted that tho collapse of the strike
at Cincinnati was likely to have consid
erable effect on the general strike, as
Cincinnati has been regarded as the cen
ter of th'e fighting, but reiterated that
CINCINNATI, July 12.â The machinists'
strike, which was organized on May 20
and which involved several thousand em
ployes . in this city, has practically been
declared off. A secret mass-meeting of
strikers was held to-day, at which, a
formal report was made that it had been
found impossible to procure assistance in
money from tho headquarters _ In Wash

hausted, and the strikers were advised to

born at Santiago in 1850. He studied for

having little taste for the legal profession,

his attention principally to improvements

KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 12.â No rain
fell to-day - in any part of the drought

region this waa the worst day of the long
hot -spell, the< temperature more
than ICO degrees and ; no breeze Stirring.
Corn, oats, hay and, potatoes are so badly
injured that even with rain this yield
would be. short, and as the -Weather Bu
reau gives no hope, of relief, the outlook
is discouraging. At some places in Kan
sas there has been no rainfall whatever
for nearly:' three months. The present 13
the worst drought since .1860, when New
England sent food to the settlers of, Kan
sas. However,' the past few .years have
been' very prosperous ones, and even now
the Kansas farmers are harvesting one of
the largest crops of wheat in the history
of the btat-3. ; Agreat many countle3 send
word that with rain corn will be a half
crop; without rain soon, no yield. A few
say there is yet hope for a fair harvest.
High Price for Hay. -
Hay sold tnis morning for $20 a ton, the
highest price ever.reacn.ed in this, market.
Receipts were very small and most qf the
hay which came in was sold some time
ago in the country before the drought be
came too serious. Hay is so high here that
it can be shipped in from Minnesota "or
Ohio or almost any State in the. country,
that has a crop. Kansas and Missouri,
which usually furnish as much hay as
any three Eastern States and at this time
of the year are usually shipping tralnloads
of hay to other points, .are -buying hay
this year. In numerous places there, is.
no pasturage and owners of cattle are
shipping hay to their farms.' Alfalfa has
yielded well everywhere and will be the
salvation of many farmers. ' .â¢ â¢ : â¢
For the past five days 110,000 hogs have
been received at the stock yards, break

are due to thescarcity.of corn. Â¦Â¦ â¢ ,
j A Topeka special says: A careful per

more "than 50,000,000 bushels of corn this
year. The crop will thus be less than a
third of last year's yjeld and less than a
fifth of lS99's. The^jTte corn is all that will
yield anything, the early product being
given up mere than two weeks: ago.' The
fact that there has been no good rain for
three months , has retarded the late corn;

dition and success has followed. All the
marksmen who shot yesterday un
hesitatingly pronounced it the finest of
ranges. They praised the light, the eleva
tion and the calmness of the air. In fact.
bo favorable were the conditions that
many of the experts shot high above
their records.
T\'illiam Hayes, king of the second
Bundesfest, held in New York In 1S9S. al
though slightly out of form, was one
of those who distinguished themselves
yesterday. Although no record was kept
cf his scores, it was generally understood
that they were unusually high. The first
Ehot that King Hayes lired was a dead
center. Hayes is considered to be of re
markable steadiness of nerve and a
splendid contest to retain his laurels is
expected.
F. C. Ross, the first regularly crowned
shooting king of America, also shot well.
He is reported to be in splendid condition
for the contest and considered as one of
Mr. Hayes' most dangerous rivals.
W. W. Yeager of the Pueblo Rifle Club,
Pueblo, Colo., furnished the surprise of
the day. His style also was the object of
much interest. He is the only marksman
who will take part In the festival that
uses the strictly off-hand style of shoot
ing. He has not yet adopted the modern
Improvement known as the palm rest, by
which a shooter is enabled Â¦ to hold a
6teadler aim, but extends his arm full
length along the gun barrel. His style
is considered to be about a decade be
hind the times, but nevertheless hia
achievement yesterday stamps him as a
probable winner of the kingship. In forty
Bhots at the ringr target he made 231, 219,
232 and 243. probably the highest four
eeores of the day.
Colorado is represented by an extremely
strong aggregation of marksmen. Be
sides Mr. Yeager there are several others
who will make a determined bid for first
honors. M. C Ramsey, president of the
Pope Ramsey Rifle Club of Grand Junc
tion, holds the 100-shot world's record on
an American standard target, with a score
of S*2 out of a. possible 1000. His reputa
tion as a champion was fully sustained by
the scores that he made yesterday. The
Colorado team also includes G. L. Vought,
champion of the Denver Rifle Club. Sec
retary of the Denver Rifle Club J. TV.
Barnes. H. Elliott and T. D. East, presi
dent of the Colorado Rifle Association, all
sharpshooters with enviable records.
Nearly all the Middle and Eastern
States have sent exceptionally strong del
egations. E. Bridge, who hails from the
Bellows Falls Rifle Club of Bellows Falls,
Vt.. brings with him the remarkable rec
ords of S3, ft> and 94, all made on the
American standard target. Massachusetts
is represented by T. P. Geisel, whose per
formances in the East have secured for
him a place among the first shots of the
country, and by H. M. Pope of Chickopee
Falls, who has an extensive list of vic
tories to his credit.
Knights of the gun who have van
quished all their opponents in their own
State and who have won local fame are
here from Montana, Idaho and Arizona,
and, in fact, from every State where skill
in marksmanship is prized. They have
come with a determination to gain greater
renown and richer rewards In the shape
of the handsome prizes which are being
offered by the clubs.
In fact, never^before in the history of
the Eundes shooting festivals "have such
magnificent prizes, medals and trophies
been collected to crown victorious marks
men. Prei-iously the prizes that were
awarded to the victors were valuable only
ss tokens of victory, but in this instance
they possess great intrinsic value and are
wrought and adorned with the greatest
nrtistic skill. At a meeting of the Bund
Thursday night $12,000 was paid out for
the gold and sliver medals, silver cups
rich with gold decorations and silver
trophies. The list comprises 150 gold med
als. 250 silver medals and 250 solid silver
goblets, the grandest and most magnifi
cent ever offered to the winners of shoot
ing contests.
One of the most attractive features of
the practice shoots at Shell Mound is the
presence of the operatic stars, Collamarini
and Russo. Russo, the doughty little
tenor. Is a marksman of no mean degree.
He will compete in the tournaments. His
wife, Conamarlni, the great Carmen of
last year's grand opera season at the Tiv
oli. is always in attendance.
The Zett'.er Rifle Club of New, York.
numbering 2tnong its members some of
the most celebrated .riflemen of both con
tinents, has sent a team of its best men
to the tournament. The club was organ
ized twenty-seven years ago by the Zettler
brothers, who astonished the world with
their marvslous shooting, and they have
managed to maintain a high reputation
for accurate marksmanship for all those
connected with the club. With the excep
tion of the president. Gus Zimmermann,
the rest of the officers are most likely in
the contingent coming to San Francisco
to shoot. They are Vice President Henry
r>. Mueller. Secretary Frederick Hocking,
Treasurer C. G. Zettler and Shooting Mas
ter Bernhard Zettler.
The festival will be commenced to-night
Â¦with a grand parade and torchlight pro
cession, in which the visiting marksmen
and their friends will Join. There will be
music and fireworks and buildings w'.ll
be ablaze with light along the line of
march. In every way the celebration
will be made a fitting opening of the
grandest and most,cxtenslve shooting fes
tival ever held. At the conclusion of the
parade the visitors will be conducted to
California Hall, where they will be for
mally welcomed by Mayor Phelan.

f^mwSS^irtatsSa are a great many peo-
ple who think it is aa
useless to hope tor health as to cry for the
moon. They have tried many medicines
and many doctors, bnt all in vain.
A great many hopeless men and women
have been cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery; people with
obstinate coughs, bleeding lungs, night-
sweats and other symptoms 01 disease
which if neglected or unskillfnlly treated
find a fatal termination in consumption.
"Golden Medical Discovery" has a won-
derful healing power. It increases the
nutrition of the body, and so gives strength
to throw off- disease. It cleanses the blood
from poisonous impurities and enriches it
with the Ted corpuscles of health. It fa
not a stimulant, but a strength givin? medi-
cine. It contains no alcohol, neither opium,
cocaine, nor any other narcotic.
Sometimes the extra profit paid by
inferior medicines tempts the dealer to
offer a substitute as "just as good" as "Dis-
covery." If you are convinced that "Dis-
covery " will cure you accept nothing else.
Â«I was in poor health when f commenced
taking Dr. Pierce's medicine," writes Mr, Elmer
Lawler, of Volga. Jefferson Co,. Indiana. "I
had stomach, kidney, heart, and lung trouble.

to California Are Do
ing in Eastern States
California turfites will be surprised to
hear that a prominent figure in local rac
ing a few years ago has again accumu
lated a bunch of money. He is no other
than Eddie Sachs, who had the pro
gramme privilege and was associated'
with Bill Murry in the Lone stable at the
old Bay District racetrack. Four years
ago Eddie received a very flattering offer
from a Montana poolroom man to go to
Butte and manage his rooms. Sachs ac
cepted the. proposition, having traveled
the rough passage in San Francisco. Aft
er arriving In the silver countiy the play*
at first was light, but soon Improved, and
Eddie found himself a winner, but, as
luck goes, H. LÂ», Frank and a few of. the
heaviest bettors had a lucky streak and
Sachs found himself again being taken
over the jumps. Last winter the tide of
fortune turned Eddie's way and he
amassed, according to a reliable, source,
about $40,000. f He a is reported to be half
owner of one "of the largest rooms in
Butte. - . â¢Â¦

three won and a $5 bill parleyed on the
three wouia have netted the sum of $1090.
Charles^ Ellison is perhaps the largest
winner in the United States this season.
It is conservatively stated that the blonde
plunger has inccreased his bank roll $100,
000 since the Washington Park meeting
commenced on June 24. His own string
has not been doing so well, but hig bet
ting on outside horses has been remarka
ble.. According *to a letter received from
the Windy City, Ellison won $20,000 one
afternoon. It is a well-known fact that
from- early In the year he has been a
strong, admirer of Robert Waddell, and
as Bradley's colt won several races at
good prices Ellison mode a goodly sum
each time. Specific In Ellison's string

players on the links last Saturday and
thirty-six entries in the various events
held on the Fouth. In order to obviate
the necessity of giving large handicaps
to the weak players when matched
against the strong, golfers will be divided
into two classes, A and B. Men who on
the average go round In 65 strokes or bet
ter and women whose average Is 75
strokes or better for nine holes will form
Class A. Players whose averages are
Â¦worse than the above will make up Class
B. The course is hard, as It always Is
at this season, but the putting greens are
in excellent condition. The strongest play
ers among the ladies are Mrs. R. Gilxnan
Brown, who Is probably the best golfer
of her sex in the State: Mrs. F. S. John
pon. Mrs. George Heazelton and Mrs. J.
J. Crooks. Mrs. Gerstle. .Mrs. Hecbt, Mrs.
Sioss. Mrs--. Skinner and "Mrs. Hooper are
constant players on the San Rafael links.
The class tournament scheduled for to
day at San Rafael will be set aside, the
majority of players preferring a team
match over eighteen holes, in which any
member may take part. R. Gilman Brown
captaining one side and J. J. Crooks the
other. It is expected that there will be
about twenty players in each team. The
four highest scores in the winning team
will receive prizes.
J. J. ar.d Mrs. Crooks have presented a
trophy to be called the Benedicts' Cup,
Â¦which will be competed for on Saturday.
July 27. It will be a handicap contest;
over eighteen holes, xnedal play.
Next month will be a great one for the
golfers. The third competition for the

will be the first contest for the women's
amateur championship of the Pacific

HE Us events that are on the
j Â£ card for this coursing season
| have attracted the attention of
1L an Eastern leashman well known
' throughout the country. He v has
promised to come out to the coast and
add his name to the list of owners whose
dogs will compete for the many handsome
prizes offered. The invader is no other
than Q. Van Hummell. who though not
a resident, is interested in the welfare of
the eport in our State, inasmuch as he
is on the- list as an honorary member of
the California Coursing Committee and
is a prominent, member of the American
Coursing Board.
Mr. Van Hummell. in a letter announc
ing hfs determination of joining- in for a
chance at the big purses, declares that
he will bring out a good kennel of cours
ers with which he expects to win enough
in prize money to pay for transportation
both ways, general expenses, and have a
sufficient balance to make a respectable
looking draft to show when he returns
horm.
If he hepes to have his dreams realized
the veteran courser will have to bring out
Fome good ones to take honors from the
great bunch of champions that Is in train
ing for the big stakes. His ambition to
carry away the top prizes In the events
of California is an excusable one and is
easilj- explained. . In bringing his dogs
to compete vntii the local coursers Mr.
Van Hummel realizes that he is on the
card of what will be the greatest cours
ing event in history, for there is hardly
a doubt that the committee in charge will
make this year's John Grace Challenge
Cup stake exceed in value the famous
English Waterloo, which has been the
event par excellence In coursing since its
ina uguration.
The local leashmen bid a hearty wel
come to Courser Van Hummell and to his
Eastern brethren who think they can
carry away our offerings. For our Futur
ity of 1902 Mr. Van Hummell has entered
a brlndle dog by Van Ot.ien out of Viola.
The Pastime Coursing Club of St Louis,
Mo., has made a bold bid for Judge Grace.
It happened that the judge in wiÂ«h!ng his
Eastern friends success In their Waterloo
meeting expressed his desire of Â¦witness
ing the trials If his time would permit. It
â¢was soon given out for a fact that the
Leashman Van Hummell Says He Will Bring
His Coursers to Win Our Purses.
judge would be on hand and the club
published that he would preside in the
saddle. Judge Grace has declared that he
would not act under any consideration, as
there are men there who could fill the bill
acceptably. The position had not been
offered and the judge, if he can arrange
his time, will attend the meeting only
as a siectator. : '
II. C. Lowe of Kansas has asked Martin
Kerrigan to judge this season's Missis
sippi Futurity stake.
John Russell of the firm of Russell &
Allen has purchased Mr. Allen's interest
in the firm's kennels en this coast and
will conduct business for himself.
The California Coursing Committee will
hold a special meeting on Thursday next.
Among the matters which will be brought
up Is the application of the new park -at
Melrcse. Some seventy names make up
the list of members of the organization.
An effort is being made to run the open-
Ing stake a week from to-morrow.
The officers of the club are: President,
William M. Kent; vice president. Dr. A.
J. Dean; secretary, M. J. Costello; treas
urer. Central Bank; judge, A. P. Dean;
slipper, James Wren; slip steward, James
E. Dean: field stewards, J. J. Edmonds,
W. M. Kent and P. M. Clarkson.
On account of a scarcity of hares no
stake was run at Los Angeles on Sunday
last.
Two stakes are on the card for this
week's attraction at Union Park, a six
teen-dog puppy stake and an open event
of 120 entries.
Likely winners in the. puppy stake are:
Tame Tralee. Killarneyl Funston. Rustio

Water Color, the California bred colt
by Watercress, again demonstrated last
Thursday what a crack three-year-old he
is by picking up 129. pounds and winning
a mile and a quarter race in 2:07. He was
purchased at the recent closing out sale
of the Littlefleld horses for $23,000 by Davy
Johnson, acting for J. B. Haggin.
John Lodge certainly, has the sympathy
of the sporting public, .over the loss of
his crack chestnut colt Rory Ough. He
received an offer of $4000 for the son pf
Friar Tuck, but declined. The colt died
suddenly Wednesday. :
Riley Grannan, who created consterna

riding on Easy street. Recently he won
quite a sum.

Jockey Shaw still keeps winning races,
and if he carries his average will cer
tainly be away ahead at- the end of the
season. On Thursday he won three races,
one second and once outside the money
out of five mounts. .
dently he has gone back, for he was beat
Â¦ en twice during the week by Bedeck and
Prince of Melbourne. The former is well
known to habitues of the local racetracks.
Ten days ago he was purchased by | P.
Ryan at auction for $1700. His win from

got a bargain. â¢ -
The biggest local tennis events ever held
on the coast are scheduled for the end of
August and the early part of September.
Play will commence on the 30th ! of Au
gust. On, that date and the 31st the cham
pionship singles * of - the' coast for ladles
will be held. The men's tournaments will
commence on September 2 and end on Sep
tember 9. During this time the" gentle
men's singles and doubles for the cham
pionship of the coast will be held and pos
sibly a mixed doubles event..
The order of events has not as yet been
settled, but will be as soon as the meet
ing of the Pacific States Lawn Tennis As
sociation is held. If the ladies' tourna
ment is not held on August 30 and 31 it
will take place on August 23 and 24.
The Hotel Rafael has already com
menced, to change the courts as suggested
last week. The principal fault lies in the
slope at the- base line, which is very an
noying to the players. Besides causing
them to make double faults it also inter
feres with the run-in game. The courts
are now being made level andiwill.be in
perfect condition by the time the next
tournament is played.
The object of the association in chang
ing the date of the championship singles
of the coast from July to September was
to get the cracks from the Northern
States and from Southern California to
enter. These men have given it out that
they would journey .to San Rafael -if the
doubles and singles were held at the same
time. With such men as Freeman,
Foulkes, Goward and Goss from the north
and Bell, Hendricks and SInsabaugh from*
the south entered, the local cracks would
'have to do their best to keep the cham
pionship at home. It will be interesting
to know, how such men as Smitn.' Brown,
Collier and MacGavln compare with these
cracks. . Goss, the champion of Oregon,
beat several, of the best second class men
in . practice, but was beaten by . Grant
Smith in one of the local tournaments.
The local cracks of the second class would
probably have their hands full' in a match
with either Bell, Foulkes or Goward. Â¦
Heretofore â¢â¢ Collier has been the only
man to practice daily on the local courts,
but since the tournament of last week
four other men have been out practicing
constantly. Fred Brown of Oakland.

The Ariel Rowing Club 'has been so
much discouraged at having the site for
merly granted to . theni by the Harbor
Commissioners taken away, after about
$100 and a considerable, amount of work
had been expended on concrete piers on
which to build the' house, thatShe project
of constructing a permanent house ashore
has been almost definitely, abandoned. A
committee has been appointed to consider
the purchase of a barge on which: to build
a house, which can then be. towed .to any
part of the bay. This seems an excellent
plan, and it is not unlikely that the. South
End Rowing Club may also put its' house
on a, float. -â¢-Â¦.- â¢
The oarsmen of this, city were much
gratified with the Lake Merritt regatta
though the arrangements for the comfort
of the . contestants - and for starting the
races were somewhat defective.' Their
idea is to establish on the lake quarters
for, all the city clubs, where boats can be
housed, and contestants can dress com
fortably. Lake Merritt or Oakland Creek
are the only .places within easy reach of
San Francisco that afford smooth water, Â¦
and of the two Lake Merritt is much more
satisfactory for spectators than the es
tuary hi its present condition..
The date of the eighth annual Astoria
regatta has been changed from August 15
16 and 17 to August 29. 30 and 31. This was
done in' order to give Â«.the owners of

Grant Smith are out every day. and are
improving very rapidly. Smith and Brown
met twice during the week, and although
the former won each time in straight sets
play was very close. Brown, MacGavln
and Smith have each taken a fall out of
Johnson during the week. Although Mac-
Gavin beat Brown in the University of
California try-out, the latter now beats
him regularly. These two men. With
Grant Smith, are the most promising men
in the second class. Of the third class
me,n Chet Smith is probably the most
promising.

"There are no less than a dozen,
streams running into the main river â
swirling, tumbling streams, all of them,
like the .Truckee on a small scale. War
ners Cre^ek and Willow Creek are nice
large streams filled with big fish. Mr..
Vogelsang and Horace Smyth have fished
this; branch most successfully, taking
several two and three pound tisn. They
used No. 10 and No. 12 march brown and
caddis flies." Roscoe Haven and Mr. Leet
favor Mountain Meadow Creek, six miles
up the meadows. It must be an anglers'
paradise, for they always come home with
a full basket. Then there is the Big
Spring, 'five and a" half miles from Bun-'
nell's and" about a third the sise of Web
ber Lake, as cold as ice cold springs can
make it. Messrs. Smyth and Finch last
week filled their creels in three hours'
fishing, the smallest fish weighing half a
pound, and from this to two pounds. The
v/ater in the main stream is as yet much
too high fcr good fishing, and I am sure
from the number of fish I have seen in
the smaller streams, fishing will not be
at its best until the middle of July. The
flies most successful at this place are
blue bottle, caddis No. 1 and No. 2. brown
Palmer. March brown. . impr. goremer,
gray hackle, yellow body. No. 12 hook.
"Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Waterhouse of
Colfax have been doing Mount Larsen and
the cinder cone.
"Wi left Chico at 7 o'clock, arriving 1 at
the Suttpn House, thirty-five miles out,
at about 4 p. m., rigged up our rods at
once and fished Butte Creek just back of
the house until evening. Butte Creek Is a
splendid looking stream, but productive
of nothing but small fish. Next morn
ing we started at T, arriving at Big.
Meadows, Bunnell's, at 3 o'clock. Fifty
five miles of the sixty-five are made in a
he&vily timbered country and across sev
eral small streams which look most invit
ing to the angler. They were, however,
running bank full and will not bÂ© ready
for fishing until late in July.
"When one arrives at Bis Meadows cr
Bunnell's he is much disappointed at first
glance. You see nothing but a slough 200
feet wide, marshy on both sides in moat
places and you wonder what under
heaven you are up against. And after
trying the 'slough' the same night and
getting only five small tlsh, you almost
wnnt to treck back to Chlco. The next
two days, 34 in the shade. No fishing.
"Well, a poor start, but a good ending.
This is the most wonderful country it
has, ever been my pleasure to visit. It la
a combination of Webber Lake and the
Truckee River, but with more certainty
than either of the other places for taking
fish. , #

afternoon on that day. The course Is the
regular Corinthian one. The race will be
under the management of the regatta
committees of the Corinthian, and Vallejo
yacht clubs. The only thing- against the
selection of August 24 19 the fact that the
annual river cruise of the Corinthians
takes place during that -week, and wms
enthusiastic yachtsmen who are up tha
Sacramento will miss the cup race. Ac
cording to the Corinthian schedule the
fleet should be at Vallejo on Saturday,
August 24, to meet the -yachts returning
from the river, but if the race takes placa
on that day the rendezvous at Vallejo
will be abandoned. As, however, the tide
will be running out until i2:46 p. m. on
the 24th, the yachts might maie Vallejo
on the evening of the 23d and drop down
to San Francisco in time to see th.Â« cup
race next day.
When the yawl Tramontana returned
last Sunday from Santa Cruz and Mon
terey to Sausalito she had a good deal of
trouble in making her moorings. Coining
up under full headway she went right
past them, put about and missed them
again, then dropped an anchor and swung
round into 'the sloop Thetis. This is an
accident tending to show that a practical
amateur is more skillful in handling a
yacht than a professional boatkeeper
whose experience has been In deep sea
vessels.
To-day the Corinthians will hold an In
formal regatta, the details of which, are
not quite settled. A similar event last
season was very successful, the crews of
the yachts being ready on the float. At
the signal they jumped into the small
boats, rowed off to the yachts, threw off
the gaskets, made sail and sot trader
way. The event to-day will be oÂ£ a
similar kind, the yachts sailing 1 out to the
channel, rounding a mark and returning 1
to the cove. A start will be made at 11
a. m., and the first boat back will win a'
prize. In the afternoon there will be an
informal jinks in the clubhouse.

THE San Francisco Yacht Club will
give a dance in its clubhouse at
Sausalito this evening, beginning
at 8 o'clock. Boats will leave this
city for Sausalito at 5:15, 6:15 and
6:45 p. m., and leave Sausalito on the re
turn trip at 10:55 p. m.
. To-morrow most of the boats will take
parties of friends out for a cruise on the
upper bay, the tide, which is high at 11:15
a. m. arid runs out until 3:40 p. m... being
favorable for a trip up the bay. The Cal

scheduled for to-day, returning to-mor
row.
The semi-annual meeting of the Califor
nia Tacht Club was held recently, but
owing to the lr.ck of a quorum no busi
ness was transacted. Some of the yachfja
in Oakland Creek half-masted their flags
for two or three days out of respect to
the memory -of Hugh McA, . Marshall,
brother of Commodore S. S. Marshall,
who lost his life last Sunday by drown
ing in Napa Creek .on the return of the
yacht Thelma from a visit on the* Fourth
to Napa City. The fatal accident oc
curred near the drawbridge, Hugh - Mar
shall having jumped overboard to catch
the small boat, which had drifted away
from the yacht. His companions brought
the yacht round and one of them threw
out a life buoy, but to no purpose.
Though the measurements of the yacht
Helen were given in the challenge sent
for the San Francisco Perpetual Clip by
the Vallejo Club to the Corinthians, it is
said that the challengers propose to in
crease the sail plan of the sloop. "When
this has been done a new set cf measure
ments will be sent to the defenders. As
the change will raise the racing length
of the challenging boat, the Corinthians
will not proceed with the proposed altera
tions to Frank Stone's Presto, as it may
not be necessary to cut her down at all to
bring her within the 10 per cent limit. It
is probable that the race for the cup will
take place on Saturday, August 24, as
there is a flood tide in the channel all

Friends of the late Daniel O'Connell, de
siring to ; express in some material way
their appreciation of the deceased poet,
have conceived the praise-worthy idea of
erecting a monument to his memory in
Sausallto, where he lived so long and
where many of his brilliant poems were
written.
The plan originated with and is being
furthered by Charles Rollo Peters, James,
V. Coleman, William Greer Harrison,
Emile Bruguiere and others of those. to
whom the poet endeared himself. The
memorial as designed will consist of a
simple granite seat with approaching
steps. The view from the site which, has
been selected for the monument is com
prehensive and magnificent. The cost of
the memorial will be aboiit $1500, of which
$500 has been subscribed. The remainder
will undoubtedly be immediately forth
coming when friends of the deceased are
apprised 6f the project.
The inscription, in addition to the cus
tomary epitaph, will contain the last poem
written by O'Connell,. entitled "The Cham
ber of Sleep," the opening lines of which
are as follows:
I have a castle of Silence, flanked by a lofty
â¢ keep,
And across the drawbridge lieth the lovely
chamber of sleep:
Its walla are draped with legends woven in
threads of sold â
Legends beloved in dreamland, in the tranquil
days of old. - -. .. a

The two Shamrocks started on a trial
race at 11:15 a. m. to-day. Off .Bogany
Point the yachts were under jib headed
topsails and a good thirteen-knot breeze
was blowing. Shamrock I then had the
lead by six lengths. She was served with
the better wind as the boats reached'down
the channel,' but outside the wind steadied
and Shamrock II began to overhaul the
older boat.
Off Cumbrae the yachts luffed up and
started on a Ions thresh â¢ to windward
across Kilbrannan Sound. Shamrock I
still led by about two lengths and was
well tp windward. Under jib headers and
jib topsails the boats sailed fast The cup
challenger pointed better and came up
rapidly on the former challenger's
weather quarter. There was not enough
sea to trouble the boats, but the breeze
sufficed to list them well over and test
all their spars and gear.
During four tacks the Shamrock" I kept
the lead, but on the fifth board the chal
lenger assumed command and rounding
the -Erin, after a fifteen-mile run beat to
windward which occupied an hour and
forty-five minutes. The Shamrock II led
by half a minute. The challenger then
hove to and waited till the older boat led
by about a length, and the yachts started
on a run back to Garoch Head. .
The Shamrocks ran to Garones Head on
very level terms and then fetched home In
smoother weather, the Shamrock II open
ing up a lead rapidly. She was two and
a half minutes ahead off Mount Stewart,
when the Shamrock I gave up the race.
The . performance of the cup challenger
was in reality not so satisfactory as the
timing of the yachts would indicate. The
Shamrock I veered widely from the al
lotted course, .owing to Captain Wing's
misunderstanding of the instructions.
Had the challenger covered the same dis
tance as did the Shamrock I the former
would have been badly beaten.

NEWPORT, R. I., July 12.â When the
Independence came up into the harbor
after the. race it was found that no one
had been hurt by the accident. When
asked how much time the accident cost
the Independence Captain Haff said that
it was certainly more than the margin
by which she was beaten by the winning
boat. The big club topsail was hanging
and dragging In the water at least twenty
minutes, and then for very nearly six
minutes the Independence lay to in order
to get clear Â«f the rigging. All this loss
of time, added- to the handicap, caused by
the absence of the big " topsail during
nearly the entire race, was more than
enough to prevent the Independence from
winning." This is the judgment of all' on
board. Mr. Duncan, manager of the Con
stitution, had nothing to say after tho
race in explanation of her defeat by the
Columbia.

The Empire Gun Club has decided to
give another open-to-all two days' holiday
shoot on the club grounds at Alameda
Point on September 8 and 9. The last
tournament given under the auspices of
the organization occurred in 1899 and was
a pronounced success. It is planned that
the prospective shoot shall surpass any
thing of the kind hitherto attempted by
the club. The prizes will be many and
of considerable value. The event will be
one of great interest to marksmen, and
prominent clubs from all over the State
will be in attendance, as well as individual
trapshooters.

at the Eighth and Harrison streets
grounds yesterday between the Angels and
the X>udes. Nine full Innings consumed just
one tour and fifteen minutes. The first
half of the gamÂ© took up no more than
thirty minutes.
Early In the game Oakland scored a
run by a couple 6f hits, and after that
nothing happened in run-getting for the
Dudes. Way down the list the Angels
pulled themselves together and won.
All this came about in." the eighth, when
Kelly, Jones and Brockhoft crossed, the
rubber on a happy bunching of hits.
Both Hodson and Jones pitched excep

OLD MAN HEROICALLY
SAVES A BOY'S LIFE
Struggles Desperately to Pre
vent a Drowning in the
Mokelumne.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LODI. July 12.â Only the prompt action
of Robert Deering saved nine-year-old
Earl Galnes from drownjng In Mokelumne
River yesterday. Mr. Deerlng, who Is an
old man, went to the river with a num
ber of boys for a day's fishing and swim
ming. None of the youngsters could swim
and all were warned to keep away from
the deep water. Suddenly one of them
screamed that young. Gaincs was drown
ing, alarming Deeringr Just . as the â¢ boy
was going down for the last time. With
out Btopplng to remove his boots or cloth-
Ing, the old gentleman plunged Into the
deep, swift, stream and went to the
drowning boy's assistance. ,
A struggle ensued. The lad .clasped
Deerlng's right leg and both sank. Deer
lng managed to come up with him and
struggled to reach shore, but the frantic
boy took him down again. Once more
they came up and Deering cried to the
boys on shore to reach him with the long
ttshpole he had been using. Little Earl
Gregg waded into the water, clung tp an
overhanging -willow with 1 one hand and,
extended the. pole with the other, rDeer
lng had Just strength left to grasp the
end of the pole, and young Gregg hauled
him and his charge into shallow water.
Deering staggered ashore and sank ex
hausted'on the sand. The boy recovered
with wonderful rapidity and soon the pro
cession returned to town. Neither Is now
any the worse for his terrible experience.
Sometimes when a man asks for bread
he receives a stone/ and sometimes. when
he asks for a girl's hand he receives her

The race to-day closed the series and
the yachts will not meet again for at
least ten days, the Constitution going to
Bristol, the Columbia to New York and
the Independence probably to New Lon
don. After the four events under the
Newport Yacht Racing Association the
Constitution won the first two in light
airs, beating the other yachts by a large
margin, while the Columbia won the last
two in close. finishes with the new Bristol
yacht. The Independence has lost In every
race, although quite near the other two
yachts in the last two contests.
The accident to the Independence oc
curred within two minutes after the start,
the preventer backstay breaking near the
cleat, so that the topmast, with no sup
port, broke short â¢ oft! at the mast end.
Fortunately none of the mainsail halyards
on the stays for the headsails were af
fected, so that after the wreck was
cleared away the yacht was able to keep

The whole agitation appears to be the result of a
misunderstanding of the purposes of the commission
ers and the right uses of the valley for the enjoyment
of human beings. If it be permissible for men to visit
Yosemite. then it is permissible for them to have
lights and roads, and if they are to have such things,
then pumping plants and electric dynamos .are essen
tial. Either, therefore, we should provide such thing's
or e!se shut men and women out of the* valley alto
gether. .
One of the points of which the antagonists of the
electric plant make the most is that when the plant
is established it will be possible for the commissioners
at some time to turn an electric flashlight upon El
Capstan or Yosemite Falls. Such a thing, they declare,
would certainly be desecration. It would not be easy,
however, for any of them to specify how a flash of
light would injure either the mountain or the water.
As a matter of fact, such a plant as can be provided
with the appropriation at their disposal will hardly
furnish the commissioners with any large amount of
power to throw away in making flashlight illumina
tions. It is safe to say they could not, if they would,
make the valley look like a New York roof garden.
All assertions of that kind are utterly unjustified
and uncalled for. At the last session of the Legisla
ture an appropriation was made for a pumping plant
and an electric light system. Those conveniences of
modern life are necessary for human comfort. The
roads must be sprinkled and the hotd'and houses
must be lighted, and the best way to accomplish those
things is to make use of the best appliances for such
purposes that the ingenuity of civilized man has
devised.
By some strange freak of misunderstanding, the
people who are protesting against the electric plant
have got it into their minds that the commissioners
purposed to string electric lights up the cliffs and
down the falls and across every salient point of the
vast landscape so as to make the valley resplendent as
a midway. Just how such a scheme could be carried
out they admit they cannot understand, for the cost of
it would be enormous, even if the difficulties could be
overcome. Such considerations should convince the
angry protestors that it cannot be the purpose of the
commissioners to undertake such a scheme, but evi
dently they have been too much excited to think calmly
on the subject. One of them is reported as saying:
"Just fanc3% with the machinery once installed, what,
commercial commissioners could accomplish with the
everlasting power there is at hand. I can see the
name and face of some ambitious Governor outlined
in incandescents on one of the domes."
Rarely has there been in this State a more striking
illustration of much ado about nothing. An electric
light and power* plant in the valley will not be a dese
cration any more than the lighting of a camp fire or a
tallow candle. Nature does not supply man with any
light by night except that given by the stars and the
moon, and when he provides himself with any other,
he introduces artificiality. An electric light differs
from the light of a candle only in the degree of the art
exercised. It will be conceded by every sane man that
since there is a hotel in the valley, and since numbers
of people congregate there, it is necessary to supply
them with some kind of light, and in this age of the
world it would be folly to insist upon the tallow candle
or the oil lamp.
BECAUSE the Yosemite Commissioners have
taken steps toward establishing an electric light
plant in the valley, certain members of the
Sierra Club have beeu moved to protest. They de
clare in effect that electric lights in the wonderful
valley would be in the manner of vandalism, a species
of sacrilege, a blasphemy against nature. They have
set in motion a sort of agitation against the plans "of
the commissioners, and are appealing to the public to
support them in their efforts to prevent what they
are pleased to call a desecration of that sublime
scenery.
LIGHTS IN YOSEMITE.
FOR several months Spain has been the scene
of riot and'violence. The outbreaks have been
in all parts of the kingdom and have been an
expression of feeling against the clerical and civil
establishments alike. In many 'instances the troops
and police have shown sympathy with the rioters,
among whom are many students**and people of the
better class.
Looked at from the point of view taken by those
who control the Spanish monarchy, this condition of
tumult is indicative of decay. But this view is wrong.
It merely means that the system which has drained
Spain of her life and energy is in decay and the sooner
it is ended the better. It is the method of thought
and national mood inspired by her days of empire that
are in decay. It is Philip's boast, "I am the richest
baptized man on earth; the sun never sets on my
empire," that is being forgotten. It is the shadow
passing with the substance of empire. The Spain of
the Cid passed long ago, and the pretense that it
existed was satirized by Cervantes. A mistake, has
been made by attacking the Spanish people. They are
of excellent traits, high character and desirable qual
ities. Those of Spanish blood among us are as desir
able citizens as we have. The people who make up
the twenty millions of Spain have in them great
capacities. This is proved by trie patience, cheerful
ness and industry with which they have -borne the
burdens of misrule, and served as the foundation of a
system of florid pretense, fuss, feathers and folly in,
government.
Such a people does not deserve Lord â¢ Salisbury's
slur about a dying nation. The Spanish monarchy'is
not the nation. The toplofty traditions of the nobility
are not the nation. The boasts of Charles and Philip
are not the nation. The millions of great and toiling
people arc Spain. That they are getting ready to
move forward is proved by the civil disturbances
which are the only means they have for manifesting
that their patience is at end and their powerjs begin

DISTURBED SPAIN.
OF all the Fourth of July orations delivered 'in
the South this year, only two have received
much attention from the press. One of these
is the address made by Senator McLaurin, represent
ing the progressive element of the Southern people,
and the other that of the Hon. Fleming G. du
Bignon of Georgia, representing Bourbonism. Each
in its way appears, from the reports, to have been an
excellent address so far as form and language go, but
judged by the sentiments to which they appeal the
title of excellent can be awarded only to that of Sen
ator McLaurin. '
The policy advocated by the junior Senator from
South Carolina is now fairly well understood by the
people. In the Senate he has refused to be bound by
the Bourbons of any section of the country, and during
the last session of Congress voted with the Repub
licans on many important issues. Since that time he
has repeatedly in public addresses urged the Southern
people to ally themselves with the progressive forces
of the nation and not to stand aside in sectional stag
nation forever. His Fourth of July speech was in line
with that .policy. "We must go forward," he said,
"and meet the "grave responsibilities of the future."
That 'was the keynote of the whole. From, first to
last it was a' call to the South to move with the nation
in the upward and onward path of progress.
Mr. du Bigrton had another doctrine to preach. He
is reported to have said that in the agitation of new
issues in the nation bis greatest concern is "lest the
Southern people should become divided among them
selves;" and he went on to say: "With the people of
the South there is one problem which overshadows all
the rest, and to my mind it is, as has been well said,
like the pestilence thatwalketh in darkness and the
destruction that wasteth at noon day. Â¦ * * * Until
this menace is removed the white people of the South
cannot afford to divide among themselves no matter
how widely they may differ upon economic issues or
national policies."
Such are the two voices that are now appealing to
the intelligence and to the conservatism of the South.
The one points to the splendid prosperity that may be
realized by going forward, while the other stands halt
ing and hesitating before fantastic phantoms of Bour
bon terror. The issue thus raised is not of yesterday
nor of to-day. The same voices have been appealing
to the Southern people for many, a year. â¢ In the past
the voice of Bqurbonism has prevailed, but there is
now hope that the other will be heeded.- It is
significant that the men who are now speaking for
progress in the South are not subjected to social
ostracism as they were some years ago. The Southern
people have at least learned to listen with j patience,
and that in itself is promise of good to come.
VOICES FROM THE SOUTH.
FORGETFUL DEMOCRATS.
OF all the things put into the platform by the
Ohio Democrats not one is half so conspicu
ous as the thing they did not put in. The
omission of any reference to the national platforms
adopted at Chicago in 1896 and at Kansas City in 1900
constitutes the really salient feature of the new declar
ation of principles. Bryan was ignored and Bryanism
eliminated. That is the kind of platform agreed upon
â¢by the McLean conservatives and the Tom Johnson
radicals, for we are told that the two factions com-*
promised upon an agreement that. the. McLean men
should formulate the national planks and the Johnson
men the State issues. They made up their platform in
that way and left Bryan out. .
Secretary Walsh of the Democratic National Com
mittee, who was present at the convention, is reported
to have said of it: "If by reorganization is meant the
turning down of men and principles heretofore recog
nized as Democratic, there will be none of it, but there
is liable to be a lot of forgetting." _
That then^is the new name to give to the revolt
against Bryan. He is not to be turned down, he is
only to be forgotten. His platform is to share his
fate. His policy of fusion with Populism falls also into
oblivion. All those things and all that they imply are to
be passed over to the domain of forgetfulness.
The new phrase naturally raises the question as to
who is to do the forgetting. Bryan himself can hardly
forget that he has twice been a candidate for the
Presidency,' and is still young enough to run two or
three times ' more. The Populists who entered the
Democratic party under his leadership will also retain
certain memories that make it hardly possible for
them to keep company with' those who are bent on
forgetting everything that has taken place since .1896.
Finally there are the ardent Bryan worshipers in the
ranks of Democracy itself, the men who believe in
free silver, right or wrong,. at 16 tog. What if Bryan,
with all the Populists and Bryanites at his back,
should insist on remembering and being remembered?
Even if they succeed in evading;the Bryanites and
the Populists, the 'forgetful Democrats would still
have to face the great mass of people who have good
memories in politics, and. who are not likely to forget
what has happened whenever Democracy is in power,
nor what would have happened had it been intrusted
with power either in 1896 or in 1900. Moreover, it is
evident that the remembrance isgoingto be kept fresh
in their minds during this very Ohio campaign, for in
his speech at the opening of the Republican State
Convention Senator Foraker said: ,
"The Democratic party came into power. Prosper
ity vanished, and four years of disaster followed. The
soil was as rich, the sunshine was as warm, the rains
were as abundant, the seasons were as regular, and
labor was as eager, but it was all in vain. The Demo
cratic party was at the helm. Free trade was in the
saddle, and capital went into hiding; the mills stopped,
the mines closed and idleness, want, suffering, tramps
and riots spread over the land. Commerce waned, the
balances of trade turned against us, revenues declined,
deficits occurred and multiplied until they amounted to
hundreds of millions."
Taking all those things together, it will be seen
that the forgetful section of the Democratic party
is going to have a hard time of it.. In the face of
reminders at home and reminders abroad, they will be
forced at last to remember what they are arid who
they are; and then will come a recognition of the
necessity of turning somebody down. It may, how
ever, come to the forgetful ones too late, so that when
the turning down process occurs it will be the Bryan
ites who do the turning. Â¦ y
better chance in life. If it "do-not give them these the
indications are that they will take them, and more. ;â¢
Let^the: world note Spain. Some history will.be

ADVERTISING THE STATE.
IN his address to the State Board of Trade descrip
tive of the California exhibit at the Buffalo Exposi
tion, William H. Mills made several suggestions of
great value. No man in the State has made a more pro
found study of its resources, its internal economy, and
also of the state of mind and point of view of the people
who may be induced to immigrate here. Mr. Mills is
convinced that it is not useful to present California to
the intending immigrant in terms of California ex
pression, but in terms familiar to the immigrant. It is
like reducing foreign coins and weights and measures
to expression in our own coins and weights and meas
ures. Talk to an East Indian about dollars and
pounds and he does not comprehend, but reduce them
to annas, rupees and piculs and he understands at
once.
We want an access of farmers to our population.
They are familiar with conditions in their own coun
try. They know that an immense crop of what they
raise there means a fall in prices. So when we make a
quantitative statement of our crops here, taking pains
to trace the benign and fructifying influence of our
soil and climate forward into the abnormal fruitful
ness of our fields and vineyards, the Eastern man, in
stead of being attracted,' is repelled. He goes back to
some seven fat years/in his experience when his lush
crops did not bring as much as in the lean years, and
he is shy of a country that is represented to him as a
continuous Mardi Gras.
Now, we Californians are accustomed to talk in size.
It is a big State, bordered by a big ocean and a big
mountain range, was settled by big men, and has done
big things. Therefore, how natural that we talk in
terms of bulk, quantity, size. And the talk is all true,
but it does not impress the people whom we want.
With them size, bulk, quantity are associated with
states and conditions not conducive always to pros
perity, and men change their location only to better
their condition. Of course, with us quantity is not
associated with the conditions which make it repellent
elsewhere, but that has "to be shown by a long and
elaborate explanation, and by statistics which are fatal
to the zeal of an intending immigrant.
Mr. Mills finds at the Buffalo Exposition that it- is
the element of quality and not quantity that attracts.
When a man sees the fine wheat of Sutter and Yuba,
the barley of Salinas, the raisins of- Fresno, the fine,
clean oranges of Butte, the deciduous fruits of Placer,
the prunes of Santa Clara, the apricots of Solano, the
dates of Yolo, the grapes of Napa, the wines of Sono
ma, the nectarines of Tulare, the olives of Santa Bar
bara, and is given to understand that these represent
the products and the productive resources and capacity
of the whole State, an impression is made upon him
which requires no index, statistics, ground plan and
front elevation to explain. It is not necessary to talk
to him in terms of size. Let him see the quality. He
knows the average price of these products in the East,
for he is a buyer. Let him figure out for himself the
problem of production and price, and no explanation
is needed.
Considered in their nature and quality, our products
are an exhibit of our climate. The orange, raisin, fig
and date, the olive and grape are to all the world an
impression of luxury and of clemency of climate. We
want people who are seeking both.
The pre-eminence of this State in horticulture is
shown in Buffalo, where our exhibit in that line ex
ceeds all that is shown by the rest of the three Amer
icas. So marked is this pre-eminence that the horti
cultural building has come to be known as "the Cali
fornia building," because we occupy so much of it.
' The conclusions reached by Mr. Mill's require t'hat
the rest of the State adopt the persistent and enter
prising methods which have so firmly seated Southern
California in the world's fancy. The semi-tropical
fruits produced here, as we all know, are produced
clear to the foot of Mount Shasta. They are common
to the whole length of the State, and of equal quality,
and equal ease of production. Yet their persistent
advertisement in connection with Southern California
has convinced a majority of Eastern people that, they
grow only there, and that therefore that section of the
State must be sought for climatic advantages. In the
north we have rested too content upon our commer
cial and productive' supremacy, too satisfied with
knowing it ourselves and too much inclined to brag
about the size of it all.
Let us now tell more about what we produce, and
where, and how, and let size and quantity take care of
themselves.
The reports from Buffalo indicate that great advan
tages may be expected from our exhibit there, and the
press and ether means of advertising the State should
be made use" of in the. vast crowds that will resort
there after the Eastern harvest is over.

The public nchool pystem of a State should
be a unit from the kindergarten to and In
cluding the university, -and all private insti
tutions should endeavor to work in harmony
with the ideals cf public education so far as
their special purpose will permit them.
Legislation with respect to public education
must not wait for public sentiment. It should
lead public sentiment when necessary. School
legislation should be under the general direc
tion of educational experts.
The association recognises the principle that
the child has the came right to be protected
by law from Ignorance as from abuse, neglect
and hungfr; and it, therefore, records with
approval that many of the leading States of
the Union have compulsory lawÂ« upon their
statute books.
While many cities have at least partly solved
the problem of school (supervision, in most
rural communities the problem is almost wholly
unsolved. Close, constant, expert supervision
of school? in both city and country Is Impera
tively demanded.
We reiterate the statement that the public
school should be the center of the educational
life of the community in which it Is located.
Especially should this be true in rural dis
tricts. Here should be found the public li
brary for the use of all; here the educational
extension courses should draw the old and the
young; here may literary and social meetings
be hÂ«>ld which will tend to uphoid the mental,
social and spiritual life of the people.
The subjects that may properly be taught
In elementary schools include those that bear
upon the ethical, physical and esthetic nature
at the child, as well as Its purely intellectual
nature.
The Bureau of Education, under the direc
tion of William T. Harris, Commissioner of
Education has rendered invaluable services to
the cause of education throughout the United
States. It Is the Judgment of this association
that the powers of this bureau ebould be
greatly enlarged and the direction of public
education in all the territory of the United
Etatee, not under Sta*e control, including our
new possessions, should be part of the duties
The problem of elementary education is the
most important problem with which the State
must deal. To provide for the universal edu
cation of youth is the duty of every State In
the Union. Residents of territory under the
direct control of the freneral Government, in
cluding the Indian Territory, Alaska and our
new possessions, must receive the benefits of
free education at the hands of the Government.
We ncte with satisfaction the steps that have
been taken -by the present administration to
place the blessings of American free schools
within the reach of all children of all people
under oar flag.
DETROIT, July 12.-The National Edu
cational Association to-night, at the last
cession of its fortieth annual convention,
adopted a declaration of principles de
claring that the problem of elementary
education is the most important one with
which the State must deal. The work of
the bureau of education, under Commis
sioner William T. Harris, was Indorsed,
and the association declared that its .pow
ers should be extended so that It should
have jurisdiction over aducational mat
ters in all of our new possessions. Com
pulsory educational laws and the consoli
dation of rural schools were indorsed,
and State support of institutions for the
training of teachers is recommended. Fol
lowing is a synopsis of the declaration of
principles:

AS an earnest of the good things to
come in the approaching season
of grand opera at the Tivoli, the
new drop curtain that has just
been hung- is an encouraging be
ginning. Frederick McGreer is the art
ist, and he has done his work admirably.
The scene is a woodland one, and was in
spired by a bit of forest in the Santa
Cruz Mountains. There is a brawling
stream in the foreground, rushing over
stony ways, and shadowed by overhang
ing trees. It is charming in color, excel
lent in drawing', and with a fine atmos
pheric effect. The new curtain will be un
failingly pleasant to look upon during
WARRING ROADS
END ALL STRIFE
Companies Settle the
Eureka Water Front
Dispute.
Special Dlgpatch to The Call.
EUREKA, July 12.â The bitter railroad
war that has waged for three years be
tween the Eureka, and Klamath River
Railroad Company and the Eel River and
Eureka Railroad Company and its suc
cessor in interest, the California North
ern Railway Company, was finally ended
to-day by the compromise of the suit
brought by the California Northern to
condemn a right of way through the
depot site of the Eureka and Klamath
Company, which stretches along the
water front between F and I streets.
After plaintiff company rested its case
yesterday managers and attorneys got to
gether and did not conclude their delib
erations until daybreak to-day.
The substance of the compromise is that
the California and Northern shall have an
exclusive right of way through the term
inal of the Eureka and Klamath Com
pany. In exchange the Eureka and
Klamath becomes tenant in common with
the California and Northern in its right
of -way through, the city. Both compan
ies are now free to complete their roads
to Arcata, the object for which they have
been striving since August, 1898.
The controversy began when the Coun
cil of the city of Eureka refused to grant
a franchise to the Eureka and Klamath
Company to pas's through Eureka, after
a 3imilar privilege had been given the Eel
River and Eureka Company. The Kla
math Company appealed to the people at
the next election and gained an over
whelming victory. The new Council be
gan a suit to annul the franchise grant
ed to the Eel River and Eureka Company
and later granted- the Klamath road its
desired franchise. The fight was* then
shifted from the Council chambers to the
courts, as each company had everything
the Council could grant.
A number of suits were brought by the
rival roads, . each seeking to condemn
rights of way through property controlled
by the other. The compromise to-day has
settled these disputes and the suits will be
dismissed. The joint track will be under
the control of superintendents of e'ach
company, and In case they cannot agree
on any question the superintendent of the
Southern Pacific Company will be called
In.
There is 'great satisfaction in Eureka
over the settlement and -the citizens be
lieve that now that this impediment to
Eureka' s progress has been removed the
city will advance by rapid strides. * ,

of its kind in the city.
Mr. McGreer Is a late acquisition to the
scene painting circles in the city, but he
has already made his mark by the clever
work he has done at the Grand Opera
house of late. His first work was with
Sosman & Landis of Chicago, fifteen years
ago, and since then he has been in active
training" in various important theaters of
the States. Mr. McGreer is an indefati
gable student of nature, and finds there
the inspiration for most of his work. The

DATE WAR ENDS
ON PUGET SOUND
Pierpont Morgan Steps
in to Restore Old
Schedules.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, July 12 V â The rate war to Vic
toria and way ports, which has now been
on for nearly twelve months, Is practical
ly ended. Dodwell & Co. are to make a
general change . in their Sound fleet and
then rates will go back to the old flgrure.
An Informal agreement exists whereby a
settlement of the difficulty will be reached
as soon as the steamer route question
is settled. . .'
The Victoria rate war has been a losing
proposition to the steamship companies
involved. " Fares were slashed unmerci
fully and for a time it seemed that the
steamers would begin carrying' passengers
for nothing-. For many months tho trip
to or from Victoria, one way, has cost
only twenty-five cents.. The original fare
was {2. The Joss to the companies has
amounted to tens of thousands of dollars.
The chief steamers involved have been
the Utopia, .the North Pacific and the Se
home, operated by Dodwell & Co., and
the Rosalie, operated to Victoria by the
Alaska Steamship Company. Freight as
well as passenger rates have been In
volved. 1 .
Just now Dodwell & Co. are reaching
out to obtain control of the transporta
tion business from. Tacoma and Seattle to
all leading- points on the Puget Sound.
There are many evidences that this is
part of a plan to bring all this business
under the dominance! of the Northern Pa
cific Railroad, thus largely shutting out
J. J. Hill and the Great Northern. The
prime mover is George B. Dodwell, who
sold to J. P. Morgan & Co. in May both
the Northern Pacific Steamship Com
pany's oriental line of steamers and the
Washington and Alaska Steamship Com
pany's line of Alaska steamers. .
This week Dodwell bought the steamer
State of Washington, running to What
com. and to-night he left for New York to
confer personally with J. P. Morgan. He
will remain the operating head of the
lines sold to Morgan, which are likely
to be sold directly or indirectly to the
Northern Pacific Railroad.

Strikers Return to "Work.
STOCKTON, July 12.â With the declar
ing off of the strike of handlers fully 400
men applied for work at the warehouses
this morning. Many of them were put at
work at the different warehouses, no in
quiries being made by the bosses as to
whether or not, they were union men. The
effect of the strike settlement is to bring
in great quantities of grain that was be
ing held by the growers. Orders were
sent out this morning by all the grain
men to their clients to rush in their
wheat. It is said fully 300 men went to
work this mornine and the others will
be working within a week. The best of
feeling prevails.

and now they pose as heroes.
MuMclan Reilly has the distinction of being

him for a sore toe, which he "stubbed" while
escaping the wrath of Lieutenant- MeaRhar.
whose tent he lowered during: thetquiet hours
of the night.
Notes of the Encampment.
The locaJ fire department responded to
an alarm, but its services were not need
ed. Henceforth small boys will be kept
outside the camp grounds and smoking
by visitors will be tabooed.
When the advance gusrd learned of the
fire they rushed to camp and valiantly
fought the flames and extinguished them.
The cadets stood between their tents and
the oncoming fire and stayed its spread
with sacks and water.
Camp Power was in Imminent danger of
being wiped out by fire this afternoon.
Small boys started a blaze to the west
of the tents,' and for a short time it ap
peared that the tented field would be
swept away. Corporal J. Thiltgen was
guarding the camp, his fellow cadets hav
ing gone into town for lunch. The cor
poral worked diligently to stay the spread
of the names, but his efforts were use
less. Within a few minutes the whole
field was ablaze. Fortunately the wind
was blowing to the north, otherwise con
siderable damage would have been done.
Fire Threatens the Tents.
The camp site is an ideal one. It is in
the heart of beautiful Napa Valley. The
grounds are covered with stubble and the
odor is sweet and refreshing. The regi
ment is indebted to City Councilman
Richard Cuff for these splendid grounds
and for other courtesies. Electric lights
and â¢water have been furnished by the
citizens. A tall flagpole has been erect
ed and the stars and stripes will be raised
and lowered each day with ceremonies.
It is purposed to have the regiment
band give a sacred. concert In the Court
house square in the evening.
To-morrow morning a military mass
will be celebrated in St. John's Church
at 10 o'clock. The regiment will march to
service and after the cadets have taken
their places the congregation -will be per
mitted to take part in tnis solemn and in
teresting ceremony. Rev. Father Philip
O'Ryan, chaplain of the regiment, will
be celebrant of the mass, and Rev. M. ~>.
Slattery, pastor of the church. Instead of
bells, the drums beat at. the consecration
and the cadets present sabers. An aug
mented choir will render special music.
No set programme will be followed the
first night of camp. As soon as the regi
ment reaches its abiding place Lieutenant
Colonel McGloin will order the command
drawn up, and Captain Hegarty, adjutant
of the regiment, will read out the detail
of the guard for the night and name the
officer of the day. After this ceremony
the officers will march their companies to
their streets and the cadets will take pos
session. ' Mess call will follow and the
regiment will form again and march to
supper.
Coming of the K-egiment.
A number of merchants have decorated
their places of business and the streets
have taken on a gala appearance.
A committee of citizens will receive the
cadets and give them possession of Napa
during their stay. The committee is as
follows: Joseph 11. Kelly, president;
Hensley Davis, secretary; D. L. Beard,
treasurer; F. G. Easterby, B. W. Parsons,
A. Ferrogiaro, Fletcher Parker and Ar
tnur Brown.
Preparations for the reception of the
regiment are, completed. The command
is scheduled to arrive in Napa on a spe
cial train at 6:39 p. m. This train arrives
immediately after the regular train, thus
allowing: the troops to disembark on First
street. The command will form in line,
and headed by its band, march through
the principal streets to Camp Power,
which is named after the colonel of the
regiment, who is too ill to attend the en
campment.
The advance guard ate its first meal in
camp to-day. The cadets sat down at
long tables, which are spread beneath big
shade trees. Caterer Abrams set forth- a
bountiful repast and the boys proved
good trenchermen. They had pie "liSe
mother used to make" and ' coffee that
contained real cream. Now that these
youths have performed service they will
be absolved from guard duty during the
encampment.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
POWER. NAPA, July 12.â Everything is
in readiness for the coming of the- First
Regiment, League of the Cross Cadets.
The advance guard, in command of Lieu
tenant William Beasley, quartermaster of
the regiment, has worked faithfully and
well. Before noon to-day 100 snow white
tents dotted the stubble on which the
cadets will camp and drill during the
coming 1 week. The arrangement of tents
is in strict accordance with the regula
tions of the United States Army. There
are twelve to a company street and the
distance and alignment of these canvas
homes are correct to a nicety.

VANCOUVER, B. C, July 12.-There
are now forty-seven Japanese prisoners
guarded by the salmon strikers and ma
rooned on | a small island in the Qulf of
Georgia, according to the official state
ment of the union fishermen this even
ing. . The Provincial police are trying to
ascertain the location of thla island, for
although the authorities do not like to
admit that Japanese have been spirited
away in the manner dunned by the strik
ers, it is undeniable that the Orientals
are missing and the statement that they
are prisoners of the union fishermen is
generally accepted, as true. The captive
Japanese, . whose offens^ is that they
fished when the union fishermen had oe
clared a strike, are being fed regularly
and will be kept prisoners as long as pos
sible. Others will be put on the island
as fast as they are captured, provided the
present plan of the striking union is main
tained.
Frank Rogers, a prominent member of
the fishermen's union, was arrested to
day upon the allegation that he had been
implicated in the marooning of the Japan
ese at Bowen Island on Wednesday night.
Joseph Desplace, another union leader,
.was arrested for the same reason. Six
other strikers who were arrested yester
day for intimidation and conspiracy were
to-day held to answer in the Supreme
Court by the Stipendiary Magistrate.
It is currently reported that a Japanese
was drowned to-day during a fight on the
river with a boat of the strikers' patrol.
No reports of further trouble- on the river
had been reported up to a late hour to
night.

MISCELLANEOUS.
HOME AND BEAUTY.
A Wedding of the Two Made by
Pattosien.
Every room a dream of drapery and
design, every parlor and hall a mar-
velous expression of art combined with
rare taste of Felection, and the whole
beautiful house a poem of richness as
entertaining and as refreshing to the
eyes as a master picture. These ara
not extravagant expressions when ap-
plied to the select rooming house, the
"Hotel Lambourne." that within the
few days past has been opened to the
patronage of the appreciative and pre-
ferred public.
For weeks past the artisans and de-
signers and mechanics of the Pattosien
Company have been busily engaged in
planning and making and placing the
furniture and draperies for the flfty-
one rooms which the house contains.
The result of their labors Is a finished
poem. Nothing short of a perfect pho-
tograph could adequately set forth the
beauty and value of the furniture and
its accompaniments. The carpeting
throughout is a variety of the richest
and costliest designs of Axminsters
and Royal Wiltons in colorings which
blend with the wall tones and furni- i
ture hues. The suites, six In number,
are furnished with sofas richly uphol-
stered in imported figured tapestries,
with mahogany easy chairs and oak-
framed rockers upholstered in French
velours and tapestries. The beds
throughout ar* elegantly finished, brass
enameled, and above all they are com-
fortable, and the walls are hung with
handsome and appropriate pictures and
etchings fulry in keeping and harmony
with the rest of the furnishings. The
entrance hall forms a stately approach
to a cozy corner which in itself will
arrest the attention and command ar-
tistic admiration; it is a feature of the
house. As demonstrating the wonder-
ful stock and infinite variety of
selection of Pattosien's great store the
"Hotel Lambourne" is certainly a
strong expression. Not another furni-
ture house in the West could have ac-
complished so much so well and so
tastefully. We are informed that the
designing of homes and hotels is made
a specialty by Pattosien, who employs
fcr that purpose a special staff of de-
signers â artists of the home, so to
speak, who are selected for their origi-
"Â¦ nality and cleverness of execution;
' while others are likewise engaged in
designing: parlor furniture deliberateiy
made to correspond in form and finish
and fabric with the architecture and
the interior draperies.
The "Lamboume" will be under the
management of Mrs. Janet Macdonald,
well and favorably known through the
East and West as a litterateur and lec-
turer, and particularly well known here
in connection with her public work in
popularizing California. The house un-
der her management is bound to at-
trzjct a select patronage of leading fam-
ilies.
It is the purpose of Mrs. Macdonald
to charge rates which shall be as reas-
onable as the service and accommoda-
tions will permit. It should be said
that in the matter of sanitation and of
personal comfort the builders of this
beautiful hotel have left nothing to be
desired. There are baths, hot and cold
water connected with each suite, and
separate baths and toilets for ladies
and gentlemen on each of, the three
floors, with hot and cold water wash-
stands in each room. The success of
the "Hotel Lambourne" is assured al-
ready. And in large measure has it been
assisted by the splendid furnishings
supplied by the Pattosien Company.

THISTLES AUD DAJTDBUFF.
An Interesting 1 Parallel and a Valu-
able Deduction Therefrom.
Cutting down thistles no more relieves
the land of thistles than does scouring the
scalp cure dandruff. In each case perma-
nent relief can only come from eradi-
cating permanently the cause. A germ
that plows up the scalp in searching for
the hair root where it saps the vitality
causes dandruff, falling hair and baldness.
If you kill that germ you'll have no dan-
druff but a luxuriant suit of hair.. New-
bro's Herplcide is the Only hair prepara-
tion in the world that cures dandruff, fall-
Ing hair and baldness by killing the germ.

The steamship Eureka, from Norfolk for
Ban Francisco has- put into Talcahuano
with her rudder damaged. Nearly every
one of the fleet of steamships that left
the East during the past two months has
been compelled to put In somewhere for
repairs. Â¦- - ...--.,.. j-,.
The schooner Irene arrived from New
castle, Australia, yesterday with a cargo
of coal. She Is a new vessel on her
maiden voyage. She was built at Eureka
and sailed for Australia with a lumber
cargo on January 17 last. !
The British ship Maxwell arrived from
Kewcastle. England, yesterday, after an
unusually long voyage of 190 days. The
voyage was uneventful.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship
Alg-oa sailed for Seattle yesterday en
route for Manila. She took about 2000
tons of merchandise from here and will
load 4000 tons of hay and grain for the
Government at Seattle.
Forest Home Returns.
The schooner Forest Home arrived In
port from Callao unexpectedly yesterday.
Her owners thought she. was on her way
to Honolulu to load sugar for San Fran
cisco, and did not know what to make of
it when she was reported outside. It ap
pears that Captain McArthur thought the
cable ordering him to the islands was a
Joke and treated it as such. It was only
a. few minutes after the schooner had
dropped anchor that he discovered his
mistake.
The Forest Home went to Callao with
a load of lumber. While on the way fire
broke out in the lazarette. but it was put
out. On arriving the captain cabled that
he would have to conae.here for repairs,
but later cabled again that the repairs
could be made at Callao. It was then the
orders to po to Honolulu were cabled.
THE Nome fleet had a lively time
of if at Dutch Harbor, according
to' the news brought by the
steamship Homer yesterday.
United States Commissioner
Whipple is said to have been running
tilings with a high hand and fines were as
plentiful as flies in midsummer. Captain
Higglns of the steamship Ruth was ar
rested and Homer Fritch had to put up
$100 gold coin in order to get him away on
Ms vessel. Two of the Ruth's crew were
disrated for getting drunk and the Com
missioner forced Captain Hig&ins to pay
them off. Other vessels had a similar ex
perience. There will be a lot of complain
ing when the fleet gets back.
The Homer is under charter to the
North American Commercial Company.
She went from here to the Priblloff
Islands via Dutch Harbor. Captain Don
a'dson reports that he made three at- '
tempts to reach the Islands before finally
fe-ttting there. The ice drove the steam
ship back twice, but the third attempt
was successful. The Homer anchored at
St. George island alongside a cake of Ice
thai was aground in forty feet of water.
"There were a great many deaths
among the natives last winter," said Cap
tain Donaldson yesterday. "Measles
broke out among them arid there were
thirty-six deaths on St. Paul Island and
seventeen on St. George Island. The seals
were just beginning to arrive while we
were there and 1 think the full number
of skins will be taken this season.
"We left Dutch Harbor for San Fran
cteco on July 2 and had a good passage
all the way down. The United States
gunboat Concord had arrived there from
Manila and was to leave July 3 for Point
Barrow. The transport Warren sailed
thiee weeks before we got In for Nome.
At the request of Dr. and Mrs. Newhall,
missionaries, she was to call at Unalaska
on .her way back to pick up three Aleut
children who are to be sent by the Gov
ernment to the Carlisle school in Penn
sylvania. United States Commissioner
Whipple was running things with a high
hr.nd at Unalaska and Captain Buhner
ol the revenue cutter Manning went there
t) inquire into matters. He told me that
hac he been there . at the time Captain
Higgins would never have been arrested."
Among the passengers who came home
on the Homer was H. C. Reed of the
North . American Commercial Company.
"There is a great deal of dissatisfaction
over the manner in which Whipple is
running things," -said he, speaking about
the Commissioner. "Of course his salary
comes out 'of Â¦ the court 'fees and If there
are- no cases he gets no pay. There are
sixteen. Italians on board the Homer now
end every one of them- was arrested at
different times for one cause or another.
They went north with the collier Kvarven
to discharge her, and they were not
twenty-four hours in Unalaska before
they ran foul of the Commissioner and his
Marshal. The latter is a man named Sul
liv&n." He was appointed by Whipple, but
has not as yet got a commission from
the Government. The Italians were fined
$5 each and the court fees amounted to
$30 each additional: When I left any
trivial, charge was enough to cause a
man's arrest and there was a general
hcwl going up all over the district. Com
plaints have been made to Washington,
but I think Captain Higgins of the Ruth
is going to lay his case before the United
States Circuit Court here on his return.
Whipple was appointed United States
Commissioner at Unalaska by Judge
Noyes of Nome."
DAMAGED OFF THE HOEN.
British Ship Allerton Had a Bough
Voyage From Antwerp.
The British ship Allerton, which arrived
from Antwerp yesterday, had a rough
time of it. She was caught in a succes
sion of gales in the channel and had to
put Into the Downs. Off the Horn she
was in a hurricane out of which she came
badly damaged. The Allerton brings 17,600
barrels of cement. In his report of the
voyage Captain Joye says: "We sailed
from Antwerp on January 23 and had a
succession of southwest to northwest
gales in the British Channel. We had to
put into the Downs on January 28 and
lay there until February 3. Two' days
after leaving the Downs we were caught
in a hurricane off Start Point which last
ed twenty-four hours. Took the north

ried them to the equator, which ' we
crossed thirty-five days out. We had
the usual weather to the Horn and went
from 50 degrees in the Atlantic to 50 de
grees In the Pacific In thirty-five days.
"Off Cape Horn we had a succession of
west-southwest gales that made things
very lively.. Our decks were swept, a por
tion of the port bulwarks . was carried
away, seven of the chain plates ; were
broken and other damage done. A num
ber of sails were blown away and a couple
of the men. were hurt, but not seriously.
"From latitude 50 degrees south to 11 de

At the afternoon session Deputy Superin
tendent of Schools Jordan testified that he
had once examined the -Hancock School
and found the pupils -capable and the
class work excellent. A similar report by
the Superintendent was accepted as evi
dence. Miss N; Lastreto, Miss- M. G. Sul
livan and Miss E. G. Phillips, teachers in
the Hancock School, testified that Miss
McKenzie had been faithful in the super
vision of the classes and had made: dally
visits thereto. The first named said she
had experienced a. great deal of trouble
with the study course, but had managed 'It
pretty well. .
C. W. Moores, once principal of the Han
cock School, testified that two-thirds of
eighth grrade class were not fit for it in
the beginning and that accounted for their
failure at the examination. "When asked
whether he did not think Miss McKenzie
was of a nervous temperament, Moores
replied, that the lady had "plenty of'tem
per;" -. -. Â¦ - - â¢ . - - -
Madison Babcock, â¢ former Superinten
dent of Schools, thought that Miss Mc-
Kenzie was excessively nervous during his
incumbency and did not possess the neces
sary attributes for a- principal. The board
then took the matter under advisement
and will render a 1 decision in about -two
weeks. . . . .. Â¦ . .- - . '. Â¦ .. , , ,.. .. .. . .,,,
Class Work "Was Excellent.
Miss McKenzie explained as the reason
for the bad, showing made by the eighth
grade pupils of her school that examina
tions were held in December, 1900, and the
more able pupils were sent to the High
School, leaving poorer ones and recruits
from the seventh grade to constitute the
class. A circular issued by the board was
then read by the witness, In which she was
directed to put fifty-five pupils in her
classes. In order to comply with this or
der it was necessary to fill up the eighth
grade classes with pupils who were un
able to handle the work prescribed.
Miss McICenzie's attorney attempted to
have, a -letter introduced in evidence in
which the. principal had complained of the
unfitness of her assistant whose discipline
Was. had. . The letter was admitted after
the name "of the . dellnauent had been
eliminated therefrom. Miss McKenzie de-
Sired, to show that It was several months
before the board would assist her in find
ing another place for her. assistant.
Another reason., for the failure of tho
pupils was the f act, thaf they are of for
eign parentage, Miss McKenzie said. 'She
admitted that the- studies "Snowbound"
and "Thanatopsia" had not been a3 thor
oughly taught as they should have been.
In the matter of report cards MiÂ«s Mc-
Kenzie had taken it for granted that the
teachers had been sending them out and
had never made inquiry about them.
Miss McKenzie Explains.
Miss Clark, eighth grade teacher in the
â¢Hearst Grammar School, testified that she
had little difficulty with the course, only
three candidates having failed in her
class. L. M. Shuck, vice principal of the
Adams. Cosmopolitan School, also spoke
favorably of the study course. Nine pupils
had failed out of thirty-six In his class.
The trial of Miss Margaret McKenzie,
principal of the Â¦ Hancock Grammar
School, against whom charges of racom
petency have been preferred by parents,
was concluded yesterday before the Board
of. Education. Miss McKenzie was the
principal .witness of Lthe day. She was
on the stand in own -defense for a
good part of the session. The trial seems
to have developed into a Sort of justiflca
.tl6n;'of"the-cdursa^of_study adopted by the
board. The directors*' resent the oft-re
peated s charge that the course, was in
reality responsible for the failure of 70
per cent of. the pupils in the advanced
eighth (grades in the Hancock School in
the â¢ examination for entrance into the
High schools. It has been claimed that
the course is too heavy for .the pupils to
digest, so the" board called several teach
ers to disprove this assertion. .
She Attempts to Justify the
Failure of Pupils in
{ Examinations.
Eecker save an emphatic denial to the
statement that he had ever said anything
about "fixing" the case and said that
Bert Potter, a teamster, used to han^
around his saloon and he might be tho
man referred to by the woman. Detective
Gibson was instructed to find Potter and
"Jack" and bring them, in, and the fur
ther Investigation was continued till this â¢
morning:. - Â¦ - .
The Judge was angry when he heard
the statements that the case could be
"fixed" with him and ordered subpenaa
to be issued for the attendance jof Becker.
"Bert" and "Jack," the druggist, at 2
o'clock. The only one present -was Becker,
as Bailiff Dougherty had been unable to
find any trace of "Bert" or "Jack." The
woman repeated her statement but con
tradicted herself inasmuch as she, said
that Becker had not said anything- about
"fixing" the case, but that "Bert" was
the only one who had done so. ,"/.Â¦Â¦Â¦; ,
-Yesterday morning- in court she made an
explanation to the Judge as to the- cause
of her disappearance. She said that' Abo
Becker, proprietor of a saloon at 115 Eddy
street, had told" her that he could have
the case "'rlaysd" for $20 and reminded her
that some' one was evidently preju
dicing her case. A hanger-on at
Becker's saloon, whom she knew as
"Bert." had also made the samÂ« proposi
tion to her, but had reduced the amount
to $10. "Jack," a druggist In the vicinity'
of Post street, who was a friend of her
roommate7" had advised, her to go away
as things looked bad for her. Others had
proffered similar advice and that was why
she had gone to Santa Rosa.
Judge Fritz is investigating an alleged
attempt to extort money from a woman of
the red-light distriet on the I strength of
the assertion that a charge of grand lar
ceny, against her could be "fixed" wllh
the Judge on the payment of money.
There have been so many similar cases re
ported that the Judge Is determined. It

"Mr. Bryan lias had both his chance
and his day. His plea for another trial
will not hold water. His dictation no
longer exercises any power of command.
It means simply hopeless division, con
tinued defeat, ultimate .ruin. Any one
with half a mind can , see this plainly.
Hence the Ohio Democrats, - in State con
vention, realizing- the situation, and acting
upon it, put the past, with its factions

ing a new leader in James Kilbourne they

* "WASHINGTON, July 12.â The War De
partment to-day made public Brigadier
General Funston's report of the capture
of Aguinaldo on May 2. This report pre
sented in detail all the facts relating- to
the capture of Aguinaldo which were
made public at that time.
General Funston shows that his, entire
plan of the expedition was submitted to
the commanding general of the Depart
ment of Northern Luzon and then Vas
sent to General MacArthur, by whom it
was approved. Genefal Funston goes into
details concerning Â¦ the Â¦ captured corre
spondence of Â¦ Aguinaldo and the' use he
made. of Cecilio Cegismundo, who had
presented himself to Lieutenant J. D.
Taylor of the Twenty-fourth Infantry with
letters of Aguinaldo he was to deliver to
various insurgent chiefs. General . Funs
ton gives the, following account of the
i forged letters which were used to deceive
I Aguinaldo: ...-. ' . Â¦Â¦ : . 'Â¦
I On October T 24, 1900, while scouting- in : the
vicinity of Gapan, Nueva Escija, I had sur
prised the Insurgent chief Lacuna In his camp,
and had ' captured - among other things some
Â¦writing- paper which bore his headquarters'
seal. On this paper two letters were written
to Aguinaldo over the carefully forged " signa
ture of Lacuna. One of these letters was dated
1 February 24, 1901, at Bulac, a place In the
mountains east of, Panaranda. .. In it Lacuna
acknowledged the receipt of Agulnaldo's let
terB of January 13 and 14 and thanked him for
the confirmation of his (Lacuna's) appointment
as brigadier general, made some time pre
viously by Alejandrino. It will be remembered
that the letters to Aguinaldo referred to had
fallen into our hands. The letter indulged in
the usual rhetoric employed by the Insurgent
chiefs In their correspondence and gave a glow
ing account of the progress of the campaign
from the standpoint of Lacuna.
Letters to the Insurgent.
Another letter, supposedly from the same
place, but dated February 28, was prepared,
stating that the writer had Just received a
communication from Baldlmero Aguinaldo, or
dering him to send one of his best companies,
under a reliable chief, to Emilio Aguinaldo in
Isabela. In accordance with these " orders hn
was sending this force under Lieutenant Colonel
Illlarlo Placldo. The latter, he stated, had
been captured by the Americans a year ago,
and after his release he had lived in Jaen.
but recently had -taken, to the â¢ field again
when ordered to do" so' by. Lacuna. This was
included in the letter, for fear that Aguinaldo
might have heard -'that Placldo had been cap
tured by the- Americans -and- had taken, the
oath of allegiance; The letter also stated that
Aguinaldo's courier, Cecilio . Cegismundo, waa
with Lacuna arid would accompany the column.
These two letters were dictated by me,' but
were written by Segovia. We were in pos
seeslon â¢ of a number of- samples . of Lacuna's
signature and had previously succeeded in ex
ecuting a very neat forgery .'of his autograph
at the end of each one of the two sheets.;
Of the; actual -capture General Funston
says:â /^ : ''. : Â»,;,- - ~ ;-'- '
The Macabebes . started up into. the. town and
we heard 'a: few shots followed by scattered" fir
ing. . We hastily crossed.the river and' running
up on the town found that the Macabebes were
somewhat demoralized, and; firing- wildly In
every direction. They were; gotten under con
trol with some difficulty,, Asrulnaldo's guard
of about fifty armed and neatly uniformed men
had been drawn uo to receive the reinforce
ments, and beinir fired into broke and ran, a
few of them returning the^fire as they re
treated. '-' AÂ«rulnaldo with his . officers had
waited' in his Quarters.-. Placldo and Segovia
entered the house to report 'their arrival and
after a- short conversation Serovla stepped out
side the house and ordered the. Macabebes.
who had Just come up from the river bank, to
open- fire on the Insurffente, -who- were -stand
ing in line at a distance of about fifty yards.
The Mr.cftbebf a were I so, excited and nervous
that - their rifle . fire was very ineffective. Â¦ But
two of the insurgents Â¦ were killed, the' re
mainder taking. flight, throwing down_eiEhteen
.rifles and a thousand rounds of ammunition^
The. Capture of Aguinaldo.;.
As Â«oon as Seeovla had given the order he
ran back : Into the house And. opened fire I on
the officers surroundine ' Aguinaldo. He
wounded Villa ' and Hambra. . The ; latter
Jumped out of the house , Into the river and
was not seen again. Villa, on being wounded,
surrendered, as did also Santiago Barcelona,
Agulnaldo'B treasurer. The five remaining of
ficers escaDed from -the house and- swam the
river. Placldo seized Aguinaldo and to]d him
he was 'a urisoner of . the Americans. At this
Juncture the Americans ; arrived on the ' scene
and ,gave their attention to getting the Mara
bebes under control and protectins the pris
oners-from them. -One Macabebe was slightly'
wounded by. a gunshot wound in thjs. forehead.

praise generously to all who shared In
the expedition; mentioning Captain HÂ»z

they* be submitted to him In writing.
Mr. Jenks also visited a number of
other manufacturing and lronworking
establishments, but as the principal mem-,

city little further progress 5 was made. v
A plea for additional financial assist
ance for the striking ironworkers was
made to the council. President McCabe
of the Iron Trades Council stated that it
would take at least $20,000 a week to keep
the men from breaking away from the
ranks. A committee was appointed to
visit the unions to solicit further aid. ;

Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be submitted to the Board of Supervisors of

Very Much in Earnest. "
In addition to supporting the action of
the committee it was proposed that the
members -should- appear before the Board
of Supervisors -and add their personal ap
peals to the rejection of the offer which
one delegate termed the result of "Phe
lan's philanthropic beggary." So earneÂ»t
were the members present to secure
prompt action that debate was cut off in
the shortest possible time. ;
Retaliatory measures are to be taken
against the wholesale butchers and
Butchertown is to be doomed. If the at
tornevs of "the- council can flnd''a legil
way to accomplish this. result. After Del
egate Lane. of. the Cooks' and Waiters'
Alliance had reported that the strike 0t
that body was in a flourishing condition,
with plenty of funds coming in from local
and Kastern sources, the report of the ex
ecutive committee relating to the attitude
of the butchers .was presented. The rec
ommendation that a boycott be placed on
Hammond & JBrod and L. D. Stone & Co.
for refusing meat to restaurants display
ing the union card was adopted. The
striking cooks and waiters will furnish
the pickets to proclaim the "unfairness"',
cf these two places.
"We have been looking 1 into the matter
of the continuance of Butchertown in its
present condition." said Secretary Rosen
berg, "and we find that its removal is
possible. I think in retaliation for the ac
tion the wholesale and jobbing butchers
i have taken we should avail ourselves of
legal aid to cause the removal of that
ill-smelling place. It exists only through
the suffrage of the people and we think
we have found the way to have It re
moved." â¢ Â¦ . Â¦
The executive committee by a rising
vote was instructed to proceed with the
matter and engage Such legal talent as
might be necessary to carry the matter |
to a conclusion. ' i
At the suggestion of I. Less, secretary
of Journeymen Barbers' Union No. 148,
steps were taken to make things uncom
fortable for A. Goldstein. 105 Fourth
street, a former member of the union. .
"This man," said Less*, "boasts of be
ing able to go to barber 'colleges' and
get all the help he wants. He tried to
get It In other directions, but failed. He
proposes to keep open till. 10 o'clock at
night and later all night, but we will at
tend to his case. He boasted to-dav at
headquarters that -he was supported in
his' action by the/ Merchants' Associa

lor library purposes, In response to a personal <
, letter of solicitation from Mayor James D.

communitv. as Implied by the common rules.
of propiiet;- and self-respect; therefore, be It
- Resoived. By the San Francisco Labor Coun-!
ell, that. the offer. of Mr. Carnegie .should be,
respectfully declined for the following reasons, ;
tO Wit: rr
L. San Francisco is not 5n need of private,
financial aid In the carrying out of any proper
or necessary public function.
2. The acceptance of such aid, .especially'
under the conditions named by the intending
donor, 1. e., that the city shall make extra-:
ordinary appropriations from its own funds,
would be an admission of the covert, and'
wholly unjustifiable, charge that the city Is;
unable of it* own volition to- make adequate,
provision for the public needs; an admission,,
moreover, of the presumptuous claim of a.'
wealthy non-resident to dictate our municipal
policy In the assumed name of philanthropy.
3. The wealth which Mr. Carnegie has offered
to share with the citizens of San Francisco
has been -accumulated largely by notoriously;
questionable means in his dealings with thÂ«j
Government, anionff which may be mentioned:
the extortionate prices charged for armor-,
plate tor United States vessels, as compared
with the" prices charged by him for the same'
materials sold for use on the naval vessels cl
foreign nations, and the supplying of defec
tive armor-plate for the naval vessels of the
United States. * .
4. The Â¦wealth of Mr. Carnegie has been ac
cumulated in the main by the exercise of a
cruel, heartless and degrading policy toward
his employe?, as witness the tragedy of Home
stead.
5. Any public structure erected Â¦with money
so accumulated and bo donated would stand as
a perpetual charee against the morals of the
community as exemplifying 1 a regard solely
for the power of wealth to the exclusion of all
consideration for the character of the donor,
the manner in which his wealth has been come
by and the "real motives that inspire its dis
tribution.
6. The Carnegie philosophy that "to die ;
rich is to die disgraced" can be justified only,
upon the assumption of disgrace in the making
of rlcfccs. consequently the assumption of dis
grace must attach equally to those who share
in such riches; and be It further
Resolved, That we condemn the action of
Mayer Phelan in soliciting financial aid in the
name of the city without first consulting the
citizens through their accredited representa
tives, tSie Board of Supervisors, as an excess
of his powers and a gross breach of propriety,
and that we condemn his action In forwarding
a letter of thanks to Mr. Carnegie In the name
of the, public as entirely premature and un
warranted by any public expression on the
subject: and be It further
San -Francisco. LÂ«bor Council amid much
A series of resolutions denunciatory of
Mayor Phelan's solicitation of the pro
posed Carnegie gift to San Francisco were
adopted last night at tho meeting of th<3
Suggests Removal of Butcher
town as Measure of Re
taliation. .
The Republican Primary League was
established, and citizens of the party were
invited to join the organization. The re
sponse was prompt and gratifying. The
local bosses, who had gained control of
the regular party machinery through bal
lot-box stuffing at the open primary last
November, became alarmed at the force
cf the movement for good government,
and sought by violence and trickery to
prevent the formation of district clubs
under the league auspices. The old-time
methods of violence failed and the league
effected an organization in every- district.
Meanwhile the Bouvier county committee,
deriving its power from the municipal
convention held two years ago, and the
Tilden county committee, deriving its
power from the convention held last Sep
tember, each filed with the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners a plan of apportion
ment for delegates to the approaching
convention. The State Committee Is now
asked to intervene to recognize one com
mittee or the other.
The Republican citizens and taxpayers
who are giving their time and energies to
further the cause of honest local govern
ment do not care whether either commit
tee is recognized. They care not whether
the convention consists ~ot 300" or 350 dele
gates. They are willing to leave all such
points to the Election Commission, where
they properly belong, but the bosses, de
moralized by the signs of defeat at the
coming primary election, appeal to the
State Committee for help. They fancy
that official recognition will give them
pome prestige. Besides, they hope to gain
the advantage of preliminary organiza
tion in calling the municipal convention
to order. There is no shadow of right,
Justice or good party policy in calling the
State Committee to Interfere in the local
affairs of this city. Independent anti
boss Republicans in every district of the
city and in every county of the State
should enter a vigorous protest against
the ill-advised and unprincipled interfer
ence.
Colonel Stone's Position.
Colonel Stone remarks that no one
knows what faction will be recognized. !
Kvery one but the chairman of the State
Committee knows that the bosses expect
recognition, and he knows that the peti
tion came from the Tilden committee,
v.-hlch is nothing more nor less than the
instrument of corrupt bosses. The re
spectable organizations of the party are
not asking the State Committee to inter
fere. The bosses behind the scheme expect
to hold the ptoxies of members who can
not attend the meeting, and it is expected
that the proxies will be voted to help the
bosses out of their dilemma. It is already
programmed that Democrats shall be
rounded up under the leadership of Sam
Rainey and ethers to lend aid and com
fort to the Republican bosses at the pri
mary election. It is the programme for
these Democrats to vote for Republican
delegates in the Twenty^eighth, Twenty
ninth. Forty-first, Forty-fourth and For
ty-fiftl^ districts. Two days ago the chair
man of the Republican State Committee
deeply deplored the puggestion cf calling
the committee together, and now he con
sents to bring the State body into local
concerns.
Some good, however, will spring from
the agitation. Anti-boss Republicans In:
every rtfstrlct of the city will redouble
their efforts to multiply the membership
of the Primary League.
Republican Primary League.
Colonel George Stone, chairman cf the
Republican State Committee, decided last
evening to issue a call for a special meet
ins of that body In San Francisco next
Saturday. The call for the meeting will
be issued to-day.
Republican citizens and taxpayers who
nre engaged In a struggle against bosses
to obtain honest and efficient local gov
ernment in San Francisco will receive
with profound regret the intelligence that
the State Committee Is to be driven into
the contest to help the bosses. According
to the knowledge of the situation which
comes to this journal Colonel Stone issues
the call for a special meeting on the peti
tion of the chairman and secretary of the
Kelly-Crimmlns county committee. This
petition sets forth that there are two bod
ies claiming the right before the Election
Commission to represent the Republican
party, and the petitioners desire the State
Committee to recognixe one of them as
the legal body.
There is no excuse whatever for the in
terference of the State Committee in our
local affair^, and the Republican voters of
San Francisco will resent the intrusion at
the first opportunity. The election in
volved is for municipal officers only. No
members of the Legislature or other State
officers are to be chosen at the coming
election. The charter, authorized by tho
constitution, framed and adopted by the
people and ratified by the Legislature,
places the power to regulate election af
fairs in the hands of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners. There is no pretense
that the Commissioners will refuse or
neglect to perform the duties of that of
fice. The petition- is simply a political
trick to bring the State Committee to the
assistance of Crimmins and Kelly.
â¢The facts involved should be made
known to Republicans in the city and
throughout the entire State. For many
years the Republican workingmen. mer
chants and business men of the city have
been waging war against the local bosses
in order to obtain honest and faithful ad
ministration of local affairs. When the
primary election law was approved they
resolved to organize without regard to
county committee factions and open a
campaign for good locals government.
Chairman Stone Consents to
Issue a Call for Special
Meeting.

Since the breaking ..out of the Spanish â¢

of tremendous importance. The personnel

been discharged, Is 50 per cent larger than
It was before tho call to arms iu,1898,
while the duties have increased in greater
proportion. The transport Easiness has
become one of the biggest branches of the
department, but General Ludington says
there is no sentiment_in favor of making
a separate department of the transport
service. Thero has been come suggestion
that such a plan would be advisable, as
the transport business has grown to equal
that of seme of the biggest shipping con
cerns In the world, and its naval charac

POSTUM CEREAI,.
NEW HUSBAND.
Quite an Improvement on the Old.
"I have been compelled to stop drink-
Ing It." I said to the friend who asked me
to strengthen up on a cup of her good
coffee. "Well," she said, "that needn't
bother you, for I have Postum Food
Coffee here, which completely cured a
friend of mine of elck headaches." I tried
her coffee and it was very good, but when
I tried to make It at home I was disap-
pointed. I Boon found that I was not
making it correctly, but by putting in two
heaping teaspoonfuls of "Postum for each
person and letting It boil twenty minutes
It was delicious.
I had at that time been an invalid for
eeveral years, but did not know - my
trouble was caused by coffee drinking, of
which I was very fond. . I immediately
began to feel better after leaving off cof-
fee and using Postum, Â«and stuck to It.
One day I met a lady who was troubled
the fame as I was, and whose appearance
on the street really shocked me. for she
v.tis so emaciated. She exclaimed In 'sur-
prise at my improved appearance, and
wanted to know what I had been doing.
She apked me if I had had a healer of
any kind. I eaid. "Yes. I have allowed
Postum Food Coffee to work the almost
complete miracle of curing me."/
My husband has been absent In Georgia
for some time, and has been in wretched
health; having been in the hospital. twice
for indigestion. I wrote him to stop
usirs coffee and try Pestum; told him also
JUst how to make it. Yesterday I received
a letter from him in which he says: "I
am feeling very much better, thanks to
you and Postum. I sleep better, eat bet-
ter, pr.d in fact, my dear, am quite an im-
provement on the old husband." Alice L.

NEW YORK, July IT.â To-day's stock mar
ket v.-2s submitted to another drastic process
of rqukicLtion, which caused some severe losses
in the !>rices of stocks. In the late afternoon
there was a substantial rally, which wiped out
lmpoitant proportions of the extreme decline.

beyond those of a technical nature. The bears
were the active factor in breaking prices, but
tbe speculators long of stocks stood passive
without a.rsy resistance in the shape of buying
to *up:>crt the market. The consequence was
that on each successive raid by the bears etop
lofcs orders were uncovered and speculative
margins wiped out. forcing the brokers to tell
out their customers to save losses for them
selves. The banks continued keenly alert to
the course of prices and encroaching upon the
margin of \-aluatlon as collateral compared with
the market valuation forced additional liqui
dation en the exchange. There was large sell
ing e.'.sa through commission houses from all
quarters by that class of holders which is dis
couraged by the mere fact of a decline and
which sells out on the prospect of getting
ftockF back at a lower figure. Rebuying by
this class of holders added to the demand from
the shoits and stopped the late rally. Reports
from the corn belt showed no improvement,
and It was the ! opening quotations for corn
which tojipled over pricps of stocks after some
progre^p had been made toward recovery in
the early dealings. The terms of the announced
settlement of the Western freight disturbance
were also considered unsatisfactory owing to
the continued defection of one of the minor
Toade in the territory. The divergence of news
from the conferees on the labor dispute In the
steel trade was the subject of continued appre
hensicn. The fact that assurances were given
yesterday that an official statement would
probably be made before the end of the week
of the terms of the Northern Pacific settle

NEW YORK, July 12.-R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to'-morrow will say:
General business continues its even course,
with . all the leading industries well employed
and with confidence expressed on every hand.
Bountiful crops of wheat seem assured, and
the damage to corn, while considerable in
some directions, does not promise to.be suffi
ciently , general or serious to at all Impede the
progress of the country. Labor troubles are
in Drocess of settlement and speculators have
been responsible for most of the unrest which
has been reflected in the market. Steel mills
are actively employed and there is a distinct
improvement iii the demand for finished prod
ucts, while quotations are without alteration.
In bars for use by makers of agricultural im
plements there Is a brisk movement, plates
are taken readily and there is no sign of dim
inished purchasing in structural material.
Rails are ordered freely, with notable pres
sure for trolley and other light weichts. Bil
lets are more quiet and few new trasaction3
are reported in plgiron. The .total number of.
pigiron furnaces in blast on July 1, as record
ed by the Iron Age, was but three less than a
month previous, and the weekly .capacity was
310,950 tons. Â¦ -
Improvement la general in the footwear in
dustry, although no .higher prices can be ob
tained.
Leather is in "rood demand and firm, but
without quotable "change in prices.
Heavy woolens are securing duplicate orders
and mills are making extensive preparations
for the lightweight season. Manufacturers are
well employed and exhibit increasing interest
in raw material. Wool . has not ' altered in
prices, but the tone Is firmer and sales In
crease. Growers are said to be selling rather
than consigning, while many ranchmen refuse
to do any business at -present prices. . "
Grain crops this season are occasioning much
uneasiness among speculators owing to the ex
tremely complicated situation. According to
the latest official and unofficial prognostica
tions there is reason to anticipat the heaviest
wheat yield ever harvested, and making the
customary allowances for domestic consump
tion, even with the small supply on hand when
the year opened, there appears available for
export about Â£0 per cent more than went
abroad in the year of greatest shipment. Yet,
prices are far above the low record and vigor
ous rallies follow each decline. Extensive
naed3 abroad continue, the movement from
Atlantic ports for the week amounting to
3,208,634 bushels, against 2,189,443 bushels a
year azo.
' Failures for the week numbered 208 in the
United States, acalnst 196 last year, and 27
in Canada, against 24 last year.

Fruits and Salmon in England.
The London Grocers' Gazette of June 29
u.ys: "In Liverpool there has not been as
much trade doing In salmon this week as dur
lnj the previous week or two. Prices are well
maintained and there* are indications of a,
fair consumptive demand In the country. Spe
cial packages, euch as %-pound ovals, %-pound
tall tins. 1-pound ovals and 1-pound squats are
in slight demand and they are rather scarce.
The question of the duty on apricots seems to
have been raised agajn and the market at pres
ent docs not know really what the customs
authorities will do. More inquiry for peaches,
but pears are rather quiet."
In regard to the English duty on California
fruits it has been stated on good authority
but unofficially that the duty on apricot pulp
Is to be entirely withdrawn. Moreover, there
Is a etrong probability that canned apricots
will be treated the same as peaches, etc., the
duty being reduced to 15 per cent, charged in
respect to su^ar contents only.

The main factor of disturbance In the market
was, however, furnished by the low state of
the New York bank reserves and the necessary
calling of loans which this Involves. The dull
ness of speculation and the inactivity of com
mission houses would indicate that there Is at
present no excessive borrowing by "Wall street
at large. Nor, although money was quoted at
the openins of the week as high as 8 or 9 per
cent on call, has there been any real difficulty
as to rates, the quotation for call money after
last Tuesday having been 6 per cent.
NEW YORK. July 12.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: While last week's
market- was Irregular and exceedingly dull, the
present week has developed a declining ten
dency, accompanied by greater activity. Most
of the incidents which influenced speculation
were of an unfavorable nature, and while the
public interest in stocks was not sufficiently
large to produce a general selling movement,
there was evidence that a good deal of liqui
dation was going on. - In fact, in some quarters
it was held that certain interests of the larger
class have become somewhat overloaded and the
principal cause for the weakness in the gen
eral list was the unstable technical position of
these parties.' The adverse news about the corn
crop was one of the leading factors In creating
a feeling of uncertainty. The fact that the
wheat yield is almost of a record-breaking kind
received scant attention, although its.impor
tance to the railroads is obvious. In addition
to unfavorable crop advices, the market was
affected by the news that the cutting of rates
by the Chicago Great Western had at last
proved retaliatory, the Atchison having put out
a tariff involving very serious reductions on
many commodities between southwestern points
and the East.

market was steady; creameries, 14@18%c; dai

CLOSING.
NEW YORK. July 12. -The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The market to-day was very idle except for
American stocks. The depression was general:
The course ot American stocks ran unevent
fully until the afternoon with Germany hold
ing off and Amsterdam â¢ rather buying than
selling. Then New York smashed the market,
notably Atchison and Union Pacific, and the
close was at the - worst. London attaches no
importance to the. rumored quarrel between the
Morgan and Harrlman Jnterests, but dislikes
the crop news. There is a feeling here, too,
that several New York pools are overloaded
and leaking-. The flatness here proves due to
the liquidation on a large- scale of bull ac
counts carried by three men. '/

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been 'two ar
rivals of coal from. Oregon, 930 tons; six from
Washington, 13,580 tons; three from British
Columbia* 10,467 tons; total, 24.977 tons. The
deliveries this week are about 30CO tons short
of our average weekly consumption, but at the
same time there Is no particular scarcity for
either domestic or steam purposes. We have to
depend almost entirely on British Columbia and
Washington for our supplies, as the only coal
outside of these sections to arrive here In the
next thirty days will not exceed five cargoes,
which passed out of first hands months ago.
The last freight quotations from Great Britain
and Australia, received this week, show a de
cline of fully EOc per ton under the rates asked
In June, and our Importers here are not willing
charterers at the reduced rates. The present
ruling dutward grain freights are certain to In
duce shipowners to send their property here
'seeking,' and coal will be the principal ar
ticle carried. Fuel oil is being liberally shipped
to the city, and to large factories around the
bay. Low prices still prevail, and will doubt
less continue, unless some unity of Interests
develops itself. Producers are paying dearly for
the benefits now being rendered to consumers of
oil, but as^the number of the former Is ten to
one of the latter, It Is a misfortune that pres
ent conditions should exist."

Latrille. She had refused not only to tes
tify but had refused to obey an order to
come to court. His Honor delivered a
lecture upon her action and ordered the
recalcitrant wife to pay a fine of $10.
The Prosecuting Attorney took one
more fling at the case, saying:
"I would remark in conclusion that this
proposition of wives rushing into court
for protection from brutal husbands and
then walking out with them arm in arm
is becoming very tiresome. I warn you,
Latrille, If you ever strike this little wo
man again I will see that you are prose
cuted to the full extent of the law, no
matter what excuses may be offered for
your conduct. This business of wlfe-be&t
ing has got to be stopped, so far as my
powers can reach the trouble."
"Of course. In a case of this kind," com
mented Judge Smith, -"it wauld be impos
sible to convict this man so long as tho
wife has been induced not to testify
against him. And it is unfortunate that
she cannot be compelled to give evidence.
Under these circumstances I can do noth
ing but dismiss the case. Latrille will pay
the costs of court."
consent to a dismissal of the accusation
against the prisoner. Attorneys had
gained the wife's refusal to prosecute, and
as she was the aggrieved party the pros
ecution had to be abandoned.
"Your Honor," said the Prosecuting At
torney, "I am compelled reluctantly to
give my consent to a dismissal of the
charge. I 'reiterate that the whipping post
is the proper thing for a man like ; La
trllle. I cannot understand the' caliber of
character in a burly fellow like this who
would strike a little .woman, especially
his wife."

Jones took his license and Joined Miss
Bayles and her mother outside; the trio
â¢went across to the Courthouse and were
married in the Assessor's private office by
Deputy Assessor Van de Mark, who is an
ordained minister.
Finally the expected son-in-law, Â¦who is
a young West Oakland railroad employe,
hove in sight and after a short conference
with Mrs. Bayles went inside to take out
a license. The Clerk Informed him that
an elderly lady and a young girl had sev
eral times inquired for him during the
afternoon, after having sent several tele
grams asking whether he had secured a
license.
"Yes, I found them all right," said
Jones. "Did she "show you the gun she's Â¦
got under her shawl?"
"Gun?" No, what's she got a gun for?"
"Why, It's two feet long," said the hap
py groom-elect. According to Deputy
Clerk McKilllcan, who made out the li
cense, Jones then made a lengthy explan
ation of the unus.ua! circumstances sur
rounding his defection from the ranks of
bachelordom. From his story it appeared
that during his visits to Sunol as fireman
on the railroad he had met and became
engaged to Esther J. Bayles, a charming
miss of that place, but that a misunder
standing arose, which broke off the
match. The mother determined that a re
conciliation should take place, and threat
ened dire punishment as the alternative.
In this dilemma, said Jones, he resolved
to sacrifice pride and allow, inclination
and necessity at once to rule hia course,
explaining that he really wanted it that
way all along. .
Mrs. A. Bayles of Sunol waited outside
the County Clerk's office all the afternoon
with a revolver under her shawl, accord
ing to the story told by Frederick J. A.
Jones, the young man whose marriage to
her daughter Esther, who kept vigil with
her on the curb, she was there to witness.

The principal points of difference are In
clause 3. the employer claiming to have
"the right of selection from the list of all
employes out of employment," instead of '
accepting any one whom the secretary of
the union might see fit to send. While it
is agreed that eight hours shall constitute
a day's work, and the employer agrees to
furnish all the beer free that the men
want to drink, the employers claim that
the time so consumed shall be worked out
between the hours of 7 a. m. and 6 p. m.
Another bone of contention is In clause
11, regarding strikes. As no agreement
could be reached between the committee
from the' union and the representatives of
the Brewers' Association, the latter
caused the following telegram to be for
warded:

William S. Wade, a Western Union
operator, residing at 781 Pine street, was
arrested last night and charged with car
rying concealed weapons. The arrest was
made at the instigation of Wade's neigh
bors, who informed the police by tele
phone that the operator was creating a
disturbance in the neighborhood.
Officer Herlihy was sent to Wade's resi
dence shortly after the message was re
ceived, but Wade was away when he ar
rived. Mrs. Wade told the officer that
her husband had been- at home, and
showed numerous bruises which he had
inflicted upon her in a fit of jealous rage.
Wade had also bitten his wife in his un
governable fury, burying his teeth in her
face and neck.
Officer McShane was notified. to watch
for the jealous operator and when he
made his appearance to arrest him.
Wade remained away for some time.
When he came back he brandished a re
volver and pointed it at the windows of
his home. He said his wife's affections
had been won from him and he wanted
to revenge himself upon the winner, whom
he claimed he had found at his home.
It is probable that a charge of mayhem
will be placed against Wade. His wife
has been sent to a private hospital.

rCAXX BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
w., WASHINGTON, July 12.'â Retaliation
by Japan for the high tariff imposed upon
Japanese Imports into this country is be
ing urged upon the Toklo Government by
its commercial men. In an official report
to the State Department Consul LÂ»yon-at
Hlpgo reports that the Kioto Chamber of
Commerce has passed a resolution peti
tioning the Government to raise the duties
on kerosene oil from the United States
and Russia. - '
"It Is declared," the Consul says, "that
the step should be taken as a retaliatory
measure against the nigh import duty Im
posed on Japanese merchandise In Â¦ the
United States and the Asiatic provinces
of Kussla, and at the same time to protect
the oil business now fast developing- In
this country. This is Indeed a serious
question aftecting Japan's foreign trade,
and whether the Government will favor
ably entertain the proposal ! may be
watched wltn considerable interest."
The oil trade of the United States with
Japan is large, the value of oils imported
into the Pacific Islands from the United
States for eleven months ending with, last
May- being estimated by the Bureau of
Statistics at $4,384,311. An increase, of duty
would consequently be serious.
Japanese officials In this city are not
aware of any Intention on the- part- of
Japan to put In force a policy of retalia
tion against the United States, * though
they confirm Lyon's report of the feeling
existing among exporters of their coun
try. Minister Kogoro Takahlra, who Is
known to be most friendly to the United
States, .will certainly endeavor to prevent
any friction arising in the commercial re
lations of the two governments. It is pos
sible that in case of the ratification of the
French . reciprocity Â« treaty next winter
Japan will be Willing to negotiate a re
ciprocity treaty with this Government.

City Treasurer Brooks complains that
the money collected for fines in the Police
Courts is not turned in daily, as the-char
ter provides. The money is turned over
by the various clerks of the Police Court
to th'e County Clerk, who then deposits it
in the city treasury. "Yesterday the sum.
of $1647 50 was ao deposited, this being the
first since June 27, when $75 was turned

in making deposits to the congestion of
cash bail, which In some cases goes to pay
the fines of persons convicted in the Po

As the first result of the Joint efforts of
the State Board of Barber Examiners and
the local Board of Health to improve the
sanitary conditions of barber shops and
the so-caMed barber colleges, W. H. v Dun
nagan, proprietor of the San Francisco
Barber College at 741A Howard street, an
nounced to the board yesterday his will
ingness to go out of the business.
"I can't stand the pressure," said Dun
nagan, Â¦when he called at the' office of the
Commissioners. "It is too much for me.
I'll sell the whole caboodle for $50."
"If you attempt to run the same kind
of a place anywhere in this State we will
go alter you," said Examiner Fleming.
Dunnagan left and is now seeking a pur
chaser tor a, lot of ancient chairs, towels
and other paraphernalia used in the dis
semination of knowledge of the tonsorlal
art in his establishment. Shortly after his
â¢departure one of his female graduates ap
peared and presented a certificate sworn
to before a notary alleging that she had
been three years in the business. So con
tradictory were her statements that the
board demanded a list of all places in
which she had worked, and will not issue
a certificate to her unless she can gi\e
evidence of her ability.
The good work of the State Board of
Barber Examiners in closing up one of
the "colleges" is to be continued until all
are eliminated from the profession. In this
action they will have the assistance of the
State and local Boards of Health, which
are now considering the suggestions made
by the Barbers' Examining Board as to
the need of proper rules and regulations
to be applied to all places where barbering
is practiced. .
Last week a list of suggestions to form
the basis of an ordinance was presented
to President Williamson of the Board of
Health and has been under consideration
since. These suggestions were published
in full in The Call.
Some modifications and additions to the
proposed rules were suggested by Dr. Wil
liamson and his associates at a conference
held in his office yesterday with Examin
ers Â«-Calish and Fleming. These modifica
tions are mainly of a technical nature.
Consideration was given to the practice
of some barbers in continually using one
towel on the headrest of the chair. Dr.
Williamson said this was one of the most
potent cause of the dissemination of
cutaneous diseases and was a â¢ practice
that should be immediately stopped.
Considerable tune was spent In exam
ining sterilizing appliances. A series of
visits -is to be made to various baxber
shops in the city with a view. of compar
ing results, so that by the next meeting
of the. Board of Health the matter may
be placed in shape for legal action. The
date of these visits and the places to be
visited will not be announced beforehand.
Dr. Williamson said that the agitation
for cleanliness and sanitary appliances
was already apparent.
"Mayor ' Phelan has transmitted me a
letter/' he said, "in which the barber who
wrote it complained against the restric
tion of using a towel only on one face. Ha
says it will- ruin his business.'! .
"As soon- as we get through the rush of
the registration and examination of bar
bers we intend to devote every spare mo
ment of our time to seeing that the rules,
when finally adopted, are carried into ef
fect." This was the final declaration of
President Callsh,' in which he was sup
ported by his associate members. -
In the meanwhile the Board of Health
is conducting a quiet inspection Into each
barber shop and a mass of data is being
accumulated by the inspectors. This will
be placed at the disposal of the State
Board of Barber Examiners for sugges
tion and comparison. '
The demand for certificates â¢ still con
tinues and customers are now beginning
to look for the chair card and certificate
which each barber is now required to dis
play.

"We are continuing, our investigations
but have nothing for publication," was the
reply of Director of the Mint Roberts yes
terday evening when he was questioned
as to the developments in the recent rob
bery of $30,000 from the vaults of Uncle
Sam's money, making institution. Director
Roberts said that he had received a tele
gram, from .the Secretary- of the Treasury
announcing, that the books of the Treas
ury Department tallied on June 24 with
those of the Mint here.
"That settles all doubt," said Roberts,
"as to the possibility of a clerical error
being responsible for the missing money.'!
v Secret Service Agent Hazen and his as
sistants . are trying to | locate ' the woman
with whom Dimmick, the chief clerk 'of
the Mint, is supposed to have* been on
very friendly terms. . Superintendent
Leach denies that there is any woman in
the case, but Secret Service Agent Hazen
is working on lines independent from
those of the Mint officials.
The secret service officers are satisfied
that Dlmmick was very friendly with a
certain blonde widow, and are now en
deavoring to locate her. Dimmick refused
yesterday to make any statement in re
gard to the allegation that he was atten
tive to a gay widow, but repeated his fa
miliar answer, "I will talk when the time
.comes." . . â¢;Â»Â¦>Â¦
' The treasury officials "are determined
that the thief of the gold sacks shall not
escape punishment. In certain quarters
there seems a disposition to make good
the shortage and let the matter drop and
be forgotten. The Government, however,
will not be satisfied with such a plan.
Not only must the shortage be made good,
but the thieving employe of the Mint
must be brought to the -bar of justice.
The Investigating officers are not talk
ing for publication," and the fact that no
arrest has so far been made leads to cer
tain statements that the hunt for the rob
ber is to be abandoned. It is - known,
however, that Secret Service Agent Hazen
is in possession of valuable testimony and
that an arrest will surely follow the pres
ent investigation.
Expert Waltz has made a report to Di
rector Roberts as to the condition of the
locks on the gold vaults of the Mint.' They
alone know whether it is possible for the
vaults to be opened by a man partly fa
miliar with the combinations.
. The work of counting the gold coin in
the Mint Is progressing rapidly. Nearly
$5,000,000 was counted yesterday, . the in
spection proceeding at the rate of $15,000
a minute. No shortage was found in any
of the sacks inspected.
Superintendent Leach yesterday gave
orders that the doors of the Mint should
be closed promptly at 4 p. m.> Hitherto the
large doors have not been closed until the
last employe has left the building. Yester
day the big doors were shut at 4 p. m. and
the heavy chain Â¦was attached on the in

Franchise Assessment Stands.
Alfred Sutro appeared for Wells, Fargo
& Co-t asking the cancellation of the fran
chise assessment of $750,000. He argued
that the express company, incorporated in
Colorado, has no assessable franchise in
California, and said the assessment, if al
lowed to stand, would be opposed in oourt
and $30,000 in taxes would again be. tied up.
Assessor Dodge pplnted out that - to
grant the company s petition would be to
abandon the city's contention. in the case
now pending before the Supreme Court
and to dfsregard the able â¢ brief of City
and County Attorney- Lane, now on file in
that case. The board denied the petition.
A. M. Simpson of . the Simpson Lumber
Company asked that an assessment of
$12,300 on boats plying in the Puget Sound
be canceled, as taxes were being paid in
Washington under a Supreme Court deci
sion there. Dodge declared that United
States court decisions had established the
principle that vessels were assessable at
the place of registration, but the board,
recognizing that a hardship was being in
flicted," recommended leniency, and Dodge
canceled the assessment. Simpson's per
sonal arbitrary assessment of $202,500 was
iref erred to the Assessor. \ .
The Giant Powder Company's assess
ment of $150,000 was not changed. .
No one appeared for H. E. Huntington.

BASTILE'S FALL
The Supervisors* meeting as a Board of
Equalization continued their consideration
of assessments yesterday afternoon. A
number of artful tax-dodgers were left to
groan under arbitrary assessments im
posed upon them as a matter of education,
and final action was taken upon petitions
of some of the large corporations.
Wells, Fargo & Co. asked . for the can
cellation of its franchise assessment of
$750,000, and its petition was refuted. The
Spring Valley Water Works assessment
was reduced to $1,564,S34 G6, in order to
yield $196,000 in taxes, as agreed upon by
the Supervisors when the water rates
were fixed.
E. P. Vining appeared to oppose any in
crease in the arbitrary assessment of $2000
upon his personal property. InÂ» fact, .he
insisted that If all his personal property
were sold and he realized $1000 on it he
would be a very lucky man.
"Will you tell the board of what your
property consists?" asked Assessor Dodge.
"You mean of what it consisted March
1," replied Vining.
Dodge pssentKcl, and the manager of the
Market-street railway system proceeded
to state under cath that on March 1 he
had the furniture In his house, $9 08 in the
bank, SIS 45 in cash in his purse and noth
ing more. He said furniture and all was
not worth more than $1000. The arbitrary
assessment was allowed to stand.
Struggling Firms of Lawyers.
Reuben H. Lloyd appeared for Lloyd &
Wood. An arbitrary assessment of $5000
on personal property of the firm had been
made. Lloyd declared that there were no
solvent credits to be assessed and no
money in the bank. The library was the
individual property of himself and Mr.
Wood, not the property of the firm. .The
assessment was not changed.
Charles J. Heggerty of Knight & Heg
gerty, assessed $5000 on personal .property,
had a similar tale of prosperous poverty.
He said the firm's personal property was
not worth more than J6CK) â no money, no
solvent credits, old furniture and musty
lumber for a library. The assessment was
let stand, and for his pains an assessment
of $500 was placed on Heggerty's own per
sonal property, which Assessor Dodge dis
covered'he had overlooked.
â¢ Supervisor Tobin movfd to deny tha pe
tition of tbe Hiberrla Kank. Then he ex
plained, as Banker Tobin. that the bank's
petition was only- formal, as cases were
pending in the courts which would settle
the question of the validity of the assess
ments, amounting to $460,000, which the
bank asked to have canceled. Tobln's mo
tion-prevailed.
Ignatz Steinhart had, been assessed $12,
000 on his personal property. He was will
ing it should stand and didn't object to its
being raised to $20,000, the figure of last
year. Mr. Steinhart couldn't remember
how much mrney he had March 1 or the
amount of hit, solvent credits, but admit
ted that the assessable solvent credits
amounted to more than $30,000. Asked if
$50,000 would be too high, he said It would
be out of proportion to what other 'men
are assessed. The board raised his as
sessment to $40,000. Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ . ' â¢ . , '. .
Brown Compelled to Wait.
Supervisor Braunhart wanted the-
United States, represented by Assistant
District Attorney McKInlay, to wait while
Abraham Brown had his say, but Brown
had to wait. McKinlay explained that
forty-two acres on the ocean beach, of the
Laguna de la Merced tract, had been con
demned by the Government, the decree
being made before March 1. The assess
ment of $42,162 would therefore have to be
canceled.
Abraham . Brown's chance came next,
and although he had filed a statement that
$1500 was the value of the personal prop
erty of the estate of Louis Brown he had
to admit that stocks had been sold for

Street Railway
â¢ Manager.
Major. Putnam Bradlee Strong, erstwhile
quartermaster U. S. -A- and a son of the
late ex-Mayor Strong of New York, has
been ejected from the California Hotel;
he has ejected himself from, the army, and
when the XIppon Mara sails for Japan
she will bear him away from San Fran
cisco. And Lady Francis Hope, better
known as May Yohe, who shared with
him the. ejection from the hotel, will go
Â¦with him to the Orient.
The major and milady were put out of
the hotel yesterday morning before 9
o'clock, and before coon he had sent a
telegram to -President McKinley direct
resigning from the army. A . telegram
from Washington says that he resigned
his commission for personal and financial
reasons, and that It was no sooner re
ceived than it was accepted. Strong had
orders to sail on the transport Grant for
Manila next Tuesday, and the plan was for
Lady Francis to sail on the Nippon Mara
a. day later and join him in the Far East,
but when the exposure of their relations
came he changed his plans, resigned from
the army and the two will leave here to
gether.
For several days before their secret got
out Strong and Lady Francis lived at the
California Hotel under the name of Hast
ings. They were registered as "Mr. and
Mrs. H. L. Hastings, Boston." and until
they began to appear together in public
with a reckless disregard of the conse
quences, no one believed they were any
but the persons they seemed. Strong had
a room in the Palace Hotel which he kept
but never used and before ehe went to
the California Hotel his companion reg
istered at the Palace, or Strong registered
for her, as Mrs. H. L. Hastings, rie reg
istered his own name just under, but as
the clerks were not altogether satisfied
with the state of affairs, she was asked
to seek accommodations elsewhere. .. .
Ordered Out of Hotel.
When the identity of the pair became
known to the management of the Califor
nia Hotel. Assistant Manager Wrenn sent
for Strong. Strong's valet brought back
word that the major was dressing and
could not be seen, but the valet would
bring- any message Air. Wrenn wished to
send. Word was sent back that the man
ager wished to see Major Strong and that
he must give up his room at once. The
valet departed with the message and soon
returned with the information that the
major and the lady would be out of the
house by half past 10. Wrenn sent back,
Â¦word that they must go at once, and
then the valet told a talc of twelve trunks
to be packed and not a thing ready, so
Wrenn gave the pair until half past 8 to
leave. It was then soon after 7, but by
half past 8 Strong and the Lady Francis
left the hotel by the upper entrance,
avoiding the lobby, and turning up Bush
street and down Dupont, they disap
peared. The next heard of them was that
they were at a downtown restaurant,
â¢where they spent the day.
In the meantime Strong's valet and
Lady Francis' maid took care of the bag
gage and secured an expressman to cart
away the trunks. The expressman was
unknown to the porter and when the
porter asked him where he was going to
take the trunks he said he had- been
ordered not to tell/ The baggage did not
go to the restaurant, however, so it is
pro.bable the couple intend to seek some
other place where they can retire from
publicity until the steamer sails.
Sent Pake Telegrams.
It was believed that May Yohe was in
England, and the identity of the woman
who was masquerading as Strong's wife
was for some time in doubt, but the belief
that she was in England was based unon
some telegrams she had sent to friends
with the intention of deceiving them and
any others who might inquire, and so let

Fancy Mesh Veilings 25c.
Our veiling business is tlie pride and wonder of the store, and yet if you'd
look below the surface you wouldn't wonder at it Women can't resist new
things, and the store that has. them is bound to receive attention.
'Tis not so much a wonder that more women come here for veilings than
any place else as it is that still more don't come.
These at 25câ Include a charming variety of black tuxedo and fancy mesh veil-
ings, in plain and dotted effects; also black Brussels nets, as well as dotted
chiffon and grenadine, in black and brown.
