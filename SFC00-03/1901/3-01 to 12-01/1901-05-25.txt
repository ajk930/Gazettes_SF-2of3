*; The 'President was- heartily applauded
at the close of his address. He departed
immediately : thereafter and -then .-the,
leaguers - and the ; others proceeded â¢ with
the regular : programme. This included
prayer by ' Rev. Â¦ Dr.' Hutslnpiller, a selec

Rev. 'Â¦ Dr. Rader spoke, of the causes
which' made the CHristain, Endeavor Con

in* that; theme r found'" suggestions for the
coming : convention : of -the ! leaguers." >. He
spoke : of President McKiniey's appear
ance before | the League ' of the Cross, - to
which he referred j as "that noble organi
zation of -the Catholic â¢ church. " â¢ He> said
hewas glad that' the' President had' come
to : see the .leaguers. The" comlng 1 c6hven
tlon,' > tie ' said; /should be '- mindful 'â¢Â¦ of its
real; spiritual > purpose. He counted upon
the f enthusiasm '. and . unity'of ' the Â¦ young
leaguers, -upon music, Â¦ upon the press * of
Sarr Francisco ; and upon -good; - old-fash
ioned â¢ Methodist consecration " to make the
coming convention the most successful
that has ever been held under the Cali
fornia jsky.
Bishop Hamilton said that the conven
tion of 1901 would be memorable In the
history of the world. He said he had
been much impressed as he listened; to
President McKiniey's address with the
fact that the nation's chief executive was
counseling the young to good living and
to doing good. Fifty thousand persons
were coming ,*to San Francisco on the
occasion ,., of the leaguers' convention.
Every j one of j these . persons would stand
for personal integrity. They .would re
turn East to tell the . people of their State
about - the glories of California. - Every;
branch of \ the' Methodist church would be
represented on the convention floor.
: . __ Â¦Â¦ Large Crowds Coming.
.The Rev. Dr. ; Filben told of; the 1 advices
that .were being' received. He said there !
were special trains in large numbers to
come laden 1 with the leaguers and their
friends. One -hundred special excursion
agents were. at work. A whole trainload"
of .Baptist peoplo were coming from one
Kentucky town. New England would send
700 leaguers. All the States, with' the ex
ception of three or four minor.' ones, had
already" given assurance that they would
â¢be largely represented. â¢, There would 'be
four and nve meetings progressing sirriul- 1
taneously daily. Speaking, as chairman'of
the - 4 committee, . he i predicted . *. that the
gathering, would be .a/great , success. . He
referred to . the need of, money, ; which the :
committee was /confident would- be freely *
contributed ; by business men and others. â¢' ;
; The -exercises of 'the rally closed with
PRESIDENT HcKINLEY attend
ed the great rally that was held
by the Epworth League Alli
ance last evening in the Cali
fornia-street Methodist Episco
pal Church. His coming, not
â¢ having been announced in ad
vance, was a surprise to most of those
present He was received with much en
thusiasm, and addressed those present
with earnestness, highly commending
their work. ,A. A. Knox, president of the
Epworth League Alliance, presided. . >
Just before the regular exercises .were
to begin, Mr. Knox announced that the
President, late In the* afternoon, had
agreed to make a brief visit.' Other mat
ters were delayed that the . President
might be honored to the full extent. He
was accompanied by Secretary ?Cortelyou,
Chief of Police Sullivan and Bishop Ham
ilton. Mr. Knox signaled his arrival and
the entire audience, while the "Star-
Spangled Banner" was played on the or
gan, arose and gave him the Chautauqua
salute, with waving handkerchiefs. - Af
ter he had been introduced by Mr." Knox,
they made the rafters ring with cheers
for the chief executive of Ihe nation.: He
was escorted to the platform by George
B. LIttlefleld and Robert Husband.
A Striking Scene.
In front of the President was a floral
device, a cross of white flowers, the em
blem of the Epworth Leaguers, upon
which were the " letters "E. L." and. a
email cross worked in red. .At his right
hand was a gorgeous banner of , the Jap
tinesc branch of -the League, and other
white and red banners were near. The
railing fronting the platform was decorat
ed with red and white fabrics and red
and white flowers. Long streamers of red
and white were looped from the central
chandelier to the sides of. the galleries.
Overhead was a large floral device with
the word "Welcome" upon it. Back of
the President was an inscription "Cali
forriia-street Church, 1901," ornamenting -
the front of the organ loft. On the plat
form beside tho President were those
who arrived with him, and Rev. Drs.
Rader. Filben and Hutslnplller and Rev.
A. C. Bane, pastor of the church. In | the
congregation, in addition to the Epworth
Leaguers, were ' representatives \ of the
Christian Endeavor societies and the. so
cieties of the Young People's Baptist
Union, who had been invited to take part
in the rally. - .
"Mr. Knox spoke very, briefly, in welcom
ing President McKinley.' lie congratu
lated the young people upon the" vlsit'of Â¦
the President to , them.
Again the Leaguers' cheers were heard
as President -McKinley came forward and*
spoke as follows: ;

SAN FRANCISCO REGRETFULLY SAYS GOOD-BY TO ITS DISTINGUISHED GUEST,! THE PRESIDENT.
San Francisco Nurses
to Accompany
Mrs. McKinley Strong
Enough for the
Journey.
MRS. McKINLET was able to
bo up for many hours yes
terday and the physicians,
who called on her at noon,
decided that it would be per-
'Â¥.'Â¦'. i fectly safe for her to start
for the East to-day. It was learned in the
morning that Mrs. McKinley had enjoyed
a perfect night's rest and she partook of
nourishing food durlntr the day.
While the President was away from tha
house In the morning and afternoon Mrs.
McKinley spent the time In sitting at the
windows of her room or In reading the
papers. V V-:'
When tha President left to attend tho
Morse breakfast^Mra. McKinley was still
asleep, but on his return she was sitting
at the window and she waved her hand
to her husband as he glanced up and sa
luted his wife, his hat in hand.
When the President departed for Oak
land Mrs. McKinley was again at the
window and she smiled as she saw the
children rush toward her husband and
shake his - hands, despite the police
guards.
Mrs. McKInley's face looked very pale
from the serious illness she has suffered.
.The consulting physicians were with Mrs.
McKinley half an hour at noon. Her con
'dltion was carefully noted and the reports
of Dr. Rixey and the nurses were exam
ined minutely. They and Dr. Rlxey then
held a consultation and later on Informed
the President that it would be safe for
Mrs. McKinley * to make the start for
Washington. 'â¢' ty,,A
A few minutes after- the physicians left
the. house- the President came out, an4
C : , the ,- polled, had .difficulty in restraining
camera" fiends. Â»Tjfiey;toroke. through ,thÂ«
lines and snapped their instruments at tha
President from, all directions.' Mrs. Mc-
Kinley .watched the movements of the
crowd and waved her. hand to the Presi
dent as he drove away.'
Final Bulletin Issued.
Secretary Cortelyou issued a bulletin
previous to leaving the house with the
President, as follows:
Mrs. McKiniey's physicians report that she
has continued to improve and . has gained
strength since their visit at noon of Wednes
day.' the 22d. and that they are of the opinirn
it will be safe for her to leave for Washing
ton to-morrow mornlnj.
It was expected that the President
would take his wife for a short drive in
the morning, but the plan was abandoned,
as a high wind was blowing. Â¦ â¢
A largo number of floral gifts were sent
to Mrs. McKinley during the day and
many ladies called at the hoflse.
After the President returned from Oak
land he spent some time with his wife
and related to her the greeting he had
received from the- school children in that
city. Â¦
Later on, when the Chinese Consul and
other Chinese dignitaries of San Fran
cisco called on the President and present
ed him with valuable gifts, the chief ex
ecutive carried the presents to his wife's
room and showed them to her.
After dinner the President drove to
the California-street Methodist Episcopal
Church, where he made an address to the
members of the Epworth League Alli
ance. On returning to the house he spent
a few minutes with Mrs. McKinley.
OHIOANS FORGET THEIR FLAGSl
The Ohio delegation when It arrived in
this city brought the regimental flags
that were borne by the Twenty-third Ohio
Infantry In the. Civil .War. These flags
were the colors that President McKinley
followed In the bitter strife and are highly
valued. . ' %â¢" : ~
The Ohio delegation, through thought-,
lessness or some unaccountable reason,
left this city without the flags and they
are at present in the custody of General
Waxfleld at the California Hotel. The
flags were turned over to General War
field the day before the big parade. They
were carried in the % procession under a
special bodyguard of former Ohloans who
had served In the Twenty- third, but who
are at present residents of this . State.
After the parade they left the flags with
General Warfield and the Ohio delegation
forgot all about them.
The flags will be taken back to Ohio on
the Presidential train to-day.* Just at
present a few that are in* on the secret
are ' having lots of fun estimating the
amount of worry the traveling Ohloana
Â¦will be put to when they. arrive home to
day and are asked where the flags have
gone.

sity of canvassing for, the Epworth
League convention at once, and stating
'that $25,000 ought to be raised. A commit

PRESIDENT McKINLET will bid
farewell to San Francisco this
morning and, accompanied by his
wife and. the members of his
Cabinet, will start on the return
Journey to the national capital.
The physicians who have attended Mrs.
McKinley saw their patient at noon yes
terday, and at 1 p. m. Secretary Cortelyou
issued a bulletin to the effect that Mrs.
McKinley would be able to endure railroad
travel and that the Journey home would
3>egln this moraine.
The railroad companies and Chief of Po
lice Sullivan were notified at the same
time aa to the hour of leaving and all ar
rangements were made for the President's
departure.
Chief of Police Sullivan at once mapped
out the route from the Scott residence to
the ferry depot over whiph the President
and Mrs. McKinley will ride. Henry T.
Scott, Sergeant of Detectives Ross Whit
taker and Dr. Rlxey made a trip over the
streets in order to.be sure that no ob
stacles existed by which the comfort of
Mrs. McKinley might be disturbed. The
route selected -was gone over in the car
riage that will convey the President and
his wife to the depot. With the exception
of three blocks, the entire journey will be
made over' asphaitum. Down town the
carriage will travel qn the iron tracks
from Sutter street to tne ferry building.
Dr. Rlxey stated yesterday that the drive
from the Scott residence to the ferry would
not be detrimental to Mrs. McKInley's
condition.
Route of Carriage.
The route of the President's carriage
will be a* follows:
From Clay and Laguna streets along
TLasaiia^ttnacclcson -street, to Van Ness
avenue, to Golden Gate avenue, to Market
street and to the ferry depot.
Chief Sullivan will have a large force
of police officers on duty at the Scott resi
dence and the expected crowds # of sight
eeers will be kept at a distance from the
house. Officers will be stationed at vari
ous points along the route and mounted
men will surround the President's car
riage and also precede the vehicle.
Every precaution will be taken by Chief
Sullivan to prevent the President's wife
from any annoyance, and. as the carriage
will be closed and the curtains lowered,
there will be few opportunities for owners
of cameras.
The start from the Scott residence will
be made about 9 a. m., as the President's
carriage will be driven at a slow pace to
the ferry.
At the depot the carriage will be driven
cn the ferry-boat and will be taken
with -its distinguished occupants to Oak T
land. There the carriage will be driven
directly to the steps of the President's
private car and Mrs. McKinley will be re
moved by trained attendants.
Dr. Rlxey will accompany the President
and his wife in the carriage from the
house at Clay and Laguna streets to the
special train at Oakland mole and will be
at the side of Mrs. McKinley constantly.
The two trained nurses who have attend
ed the patient in this city will also go to
Washington v/lth her.
The. members of the Cabinet and their
wives will drive from the Palace Hotel In
lime to reach the ferry depot shortly be
fore 10 a. m. and will be on the ferry-boat
before the President's, carriage arrives.
The depot will be kept clear, and no one
rrill be allowed to approach the slip where
the special ferry-boat will await the chief
executive and Mrs. McKinley.
Return Journey to Washington.
Railroad officials were busy yesterday
making final arrangements for the return
trip to Washington. To handle the spe
cial train of eight cars so that the jour
ney can be made without a hitch requires
skillful management. As In the trip West,
General Manager Kruttschnitt will take
charge of the train, and his responsibility
will not cease until he lands it In Ogden.
The arrangements from this city were
perfected yesterday afternoon. When the
President and Mrs*. McKinley arrive at
the ferry building at 10 o'clock this morn-
ing the regular Oakland boat will have
pulled out on time and another ferry-boat
will be run into the slip Immediately to
take the party across the bay./
No fast time will be made, and the train
will riin slowly to Stockton, arriving there
at 1:30 p. m- An eigrht-mlnute stop will be
made there, and then the journey will be
resumed to Sacramento. The first rail
road division will then have been covered.
At Sacramento there will be practically
no stop, time being taken only to change
engines. The train. If on time, leaves
there at 3;30 d. m.
After leaving: Sacramento a slow run.
will be made all the way over the divi
sions, and should no mishap occur the
train should arrive Jn Ogden to-morrow
afternoon about 3 o'clock.
The train will then be turned over to the
Union Pacific officials and the run to
Oir.aha will be made in faster time. From
Omaha to Chicago the Presidential party
will run over the Chicago and Northwest
ern. The Pennsylvania Railroad is select
ed as the route to Washington from Chi

The young people of Oakland triumphed
where .their elders; failed In more ways
than one. :The only speech that the'Pres
ident delivered in Oakland : was to â¢ the
boys and - girls of the ;-Oakland <High
School and such schools as were massed
about. McKinley said that he did not
have the time to: make ;an address, but
'when, he was urged to say. a few, words to
the boys" and girls he yielded and.it- was
arranged that he should stop his carriage
before them and -make' the only remarks
given -on the Oakland side of the bay to
the pupils of Oakland's pet school. ; '~
But one. change was made. "In the pro-
I gramme and that was ordered 7 , by'-- the
President himself. When the linat of
march and the programme were : submit
ted to Mr. McKinley on the boat coming
fo~ Oakland, he asked-lf the . procession

and he explained- that he- had known Mr.

THE echo of cheers and huzzas
sweeping .over the blue waters
of Lake Merritt Bounded: tho
â¢ signal of the approaching Presi
dential party to tho double rows
of school children that were
Â¦ massed along either side of Oak
street from the broad turn at Lake street
down to Thirteenth, where a barrier of
wires blocked- the end of the line of
march. No prettier spectacle met the "eyes
of the President than that along the beau
tiful thoroughfare, which is -bordered on
the east side by the wooded slopes which
stretch away to the "lake.
With loud and, hearty enthusiasm did
the children, boys and girls, who had wait
ed patiently for his coming hall the Presi
dent as tha carriage, surrounded by the
mounted policemen, drew into the street.
At the head of 'Oak street, along the west
side, was the station of the Oakland High
School, where there were nearly 600 boys
and girls. Just beyond and nearer' the
Junction with Lake street were the Cen
tral High, the Glawson and the Swett
school pupils, the groups set in a frame
work of the national colors, formed,. by
the hundreds of flags that fluttered from
every expectant pupil's hands.. ' . i
The Franklin School had a post at the
very -turn of the streets, and here a^ain
waved the flags that threw so much color
into the scene.
The 'carriage occupied by the President,
the Mayor and Chairman Adams. moved
very slowly down Oak street and the long
line behind kept pace. As the President's
carriage was opposite the banner of-the
Oakland High School the ' lusty young
sters In well trained unison shouted the

OAKLAND has at last been
visited by the President of
the United State*. After
many disappointment! that
city hab been able to wel
come the head of the nation,
and the failures of the Har
rison visit and the cancellation of the
visit of President McKinley last week
have all been forgotten in the reception
cf ytsterday.
It was called a "Mltle reception" be
cause Oakland considered It so.' There
had been no preparationâ the time had
been so short that this was' impossible.
Jt was most Informal, and consisted only
of a drive about the city, with a stop of
five minutes while the President Eaid a
few words to the pupils of the Oakland
High School, who were gathered at that
point.
But while there was no set programme,
and no addresses Â«f welcome by promi
nent citizens, and while there were only
eorae American .flags and a few yards of
bunting and streamers on Broadway
alone, and while the politicians and the
jpforesaid prominent citizens had to take
a back seat for the children of the Oak
land High School, and the schools in gen
eral of Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley,
Jt was a reception which none have ex
celled in heartiness and sincerity. The
people of Oakland wanted merely the
privilege of seeing the President and of
having him see a section of their city, no
matter how short the time. And they
turned out in such numbers that the re
ception was' anything but little. It was
little only by comparison with. what Oak
land would like. to have done. .
All of the upper portion of . Alameda
County migrated to Oakland and gave the
President a sincere and hearty welcome
without any framework of flags and de
corations and long speeches.
School Review the Feature.
The review of the school children was
the feature of the Cay in Oakland. ' In
fact the day was given over to the little
ones. The politicians, me leaders in so
'ciety/the men of trade and commerce and
the men of money and of power all gave
way. to the children. The little, folk had
Tull swing: and those who were pld grew
young again that they might- enter into
the spirit of the occasion and enjoy the
day as did the little ones.
The youngsters came by thousands, and
when the Oakland contingent dld= not fill
the streets those from Alameda. Berke
ley.' Emeryville. Fruitvale.and not a few
from other points In the county came to
twell the crowd. . There - were thousands
cf them, and they, lined the streets alon?
the route of travel from the foot of
Broadway up to the edge of Lake Merritt.
*To estimate the crowd would be an Im
possibility, but It Is safe to say that everv
pupil of the schools in the cities named
came to Oakland to nee the President.
Eight thousand flags were given out by
tho Oakland School Department, and they
Â«i!d not go around. Two enthusiastic men

' The trip. to Oakland was not marred by
a single' unpleasant incident: From 'the
time that the- party: left San -Francisco
until they again reached/ the metropolis
overything was pelasant from the bright
sun overhead to the modest arrangements
that had been made for. the brief visit - â¢
â¢ The -revenue cutter Golden Gate '. arrived
at the foot of Broadway on time ;to- a
minute. On Â« board was the Presidential
party. United States Senator Perkins,
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf, Edson
F. Adams. T. T. Dargle; Naval ! Officer
No Unpleasant Incident.;
Then the Golden Gate puffed down the
harbor for San, Francisco while the crowd
who had seen the -President's- last- act in
Oakland cheered as 'If they would never
â¢ At Broadway and Thirteenth street a
similar incident happened.* A 'little girl,
without regard for danger, bolted through
the crowd and up to the Presidential car
riage and threw a tiny bouquet at the
chief magistrate. McKinley lifted his hat
to the little girl, while the police reined
up their horses to prevent her from be-
Jnj? trodden under foot. . Â¦ Â¦-
But It was at the wharf ' upon his de
parture that the most affecting 'Incident
of the day occurred. There was an im
mense crowd around the gangplank up
which the President had Just passed. The
Golden Gate was almost ready to pull out
when from far. down in the crowd came
the wail' of a small boy. - He was wedged
in between older people and' he could not
see the .'Presildejit..-.' He Â¦ announced * that
fact in tearful tones that couKbbe heard
all-over, the wharf -and 'even on* the deck
of the revenue cutter. Â¦ He wanted- to -see
the President and he 'wept because' that
pleasure ww denied I him..- The- President
heard It all. He ordered the preparations
to get the boat under way stopped and,
walking back down -the gangplank, he
found the little fellow in the crowd and
shook him by:the hand while he told him
not to cry any more. . Â¦- Â¦ : ;
more an'd ran. by the side of the Presi
dent'* carriage over the entire route, de
clared that there were 20,000 children.
AH alone the route President McKln
ley ehowed his regard for the little onei
and there were many acts of Mis that be
tokened a kindly regard for the genera
tion that Is growing up to fill the places
now held by those in the Presidential
party. . <r'.
The etalwart- policemen, were mounted
on horseback and instructed to ride by the
side of the President' d carriage. Police
men Turner and McSorley were chosen
for this difficult work and well thev did
their -fork, . but with â¢ all their vigilance
they could not keep the children back
from the carriase. '"')'Â¦
President Kisses Little Girl.
Coming down Jackson street one little
girl, scarcely more than 8 years of age,
bolted under the horse of Policeman Tur
ner. The" little one was dressed . all !h
white and she made a run wnder the
horse's head before any one could stop
her: She jumped upon the steps of the
Presidential carriage and, there she hung,
with her curly head Just peering 1 above the
carriage door, with her tiny hand out
stretched. The President started in fear
that the little girl would fall.: -He caught
her and held her close to the eide of the
carriage and then signaled the driver to
stop. The entire procession was brought
to a halt and as the President lifted the
little tot in white down he kissed her.
Then the little white vision darted under
the heads of' the policemen's horses â¢ and
disappeared in the crowd, happy and ex
cited. " " â,

FORCED TO JOIN
ARMY OF RAISER
American Citizen Must
Become a German
Soldier.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PENXGROVE, May 24.â Peter Siemens,
a well-known young German citizen of
Penngrove, will, according to recent ad
vices received here, enter upon a three,
years' term of service In the army of the
German Emperor on June 1. Behind Sie
mens' advent into the Kaiser's army,
which is by no means voluntary on his
part, there is a sad yet interesting story.
More than seven years ago Siemens,
then a lad nearing his eighteenth birth
day, arrived here from his home in Ham
burg and took up his residence with his
uncle, the late B. F. Harms. He was at
the time of his departure from'his father
land subject to military duty, and before
being allowed to sail was required by the
army officials to sign a pledge obligating
himself to return whenever they should
see fit to call upon him to serve his term
In the army.
About two years ago Siemens received
a notification to at once report for ser
vice. Having in the meantime become a
naturalized citizen of the United States
he supposed that this removed his liabil
ity to service in the army of his native
land, and in reply, to this notice he po
litely informed the Government that .as
he was now a full-fledged American he
did not have to and would not serve any
time in any army other than that of the
United States. He heard nothing more
about the matter and thought that the
incident was closed.
Siemens paid a- visit to Germany, and
no sooner had he set foot upon German
soil than his identity became known and
he was arrested and thrown into jail,
where he was confined ' Â¦ for some time.
Siemens' folks are wealthy and influential
and made every effort, to save him, but
without avail. In addition to the three
years of service in the army young Sie
mens must pay a fine of about $75.
The unfortunate man is 25 years old
and is a duly naturalized and * registered

NEW YORK. May 24.â The recent ac
quisition of railroad properties by' George
J. Gould and allied interests has given rise
to a growing belief that the plans for the
Missouri Paciflc system aim to place It In
the very -forefront of railroad properties
of the country. It now appears that the
project comprehends the connecting of the
Atlantic and Paciflc seaboards.
Russell Sage said to-day that the devel
opment of the plan for a greater Missouri
Paciflc would not, in his Judgment, de
velop any hostilities in the railroad situa
tion. Every thing, he thinks, will be ami
cably arranged.
"The general plan uw to extend the sys
tem from, ' the Pacific to the Atlantic
Ocean," said Sage. "This will doubtless
take a good deal of time. I cannot say
how long."<
"What means do you expect the road to
take to get its outlet to the Atlantic sea

PRESIDENT McKINLETS last
day in San Francisco was a
busy one. In the morning he
attended a breakfast at the
residence of Mr. and Mrs.
George Morse and while there
was presented with a handsome
large American flag by the ladles of the
California Club. The flag was made en
tirely by the ladies of the club of mate
rials wholly produced in California. The
delegation of club women was headed by
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the club,
er.d Mrs. Alexander D. Sharon made the
presentation 6peech. Mrs. Sharon spoke as
loll owe:
Mr. President: It Is my great g-ood fortune
to be selected by the ladies of the California
Club to present to the honored head of our
nation the most beautiful emblem of America.
The reason for this choice is. first, that its
origin emanated from a weman^s brain, her
deft lingers formed it into chape; second, that
it was produced in California.
I have read that George Washington was
proud to record in his dairy that on his in
auguration day he wore a coat that was made
in Connecticut. Sir. we are proud to say to
you that this nag: we are about to present to
you was made, every part of it, in California.
Its silk was manufactured here, its 6tandard
taken from our noble forests, its making a
labor of Jove by Californian hands, and. Mr.
President. I would say that we feel that we
could select no abler standard bearer than
you. Tou have taken it through calm and
through tempest and brought it forth with
no stripe sullied by dishonor and no star
dimmed, and we trust that any star added to
its azure field during your administration may
prove the brightest Jewel In Columbia's crown.
The flag: was then presented. _to the
President by little Marjorie Morse and the
President made a neat speech 'of thanks
to the ladies of tbe club. Miss Morse
Â¦was presented by Miss May Sharon with
a handsome doll in recognition of her
services. * â¢

. PHILADELPHIA. May 24.â The debate
on creed revision was continued by the
Presbyterian General Assembly to-day,
and Calvary Chdrch was unable to con
tain the throngs who came to hear the
discussion.
The Rev. Davis S. Kennedy of Alle
gheny, Pa., yielded the floor to Judge E.
W. C. Humphrey of Louisville, who signed
the minority report with Dr. McKibben.
Â¦ Judge Humphrey Â¦ urged the elimina
tion from the committee's report of the
clause recommending: the brlof sum
mary of the reformed faith bearing tha
same~ relation to the confession which
the shorter catechism bears to the larg
er catechism, and formed on the general
mcdel- of the consensus creed. He
claimed it meant practically a new creed,
and should not be concurred In. aa the
Presbyterians did not desire a, new con
fession.
Dr. Kennedy followed with a forceful
argument against "revision. The .way to
break down the confession finally, be said,
is to go on making holes In it.
In conclusion, h& said:- "Our plea 13 that
now is not the time for changes while
the church is under fire. "We are not liv
ing in a constitution-making age. After
a fair, deliberate and free discussion, we
find ourselves all divided up. Let us wait
until God in his providence brings us to
the time when we can agree on the ques
tion at Issue."
Dr. John Dewitt of Princeton Univer
sity said there was no danger of a divi
sion in the church, and he wanted It to
go out to the world that no matter how
they may differ on the Westminster con
fession they stand united on the word of,
God. He spoke of the consistency of the)
beliefs of the church, which has stuck
closer to the doctrines of the Reformation
than any other church.
.President J. D. Moffatt of Washington
and Jefferson University advocated the
acceptance of recommendation B. The
recommendation asks that another com
mittee be appointed and that it be in
structed to prepare a brief summary of
the reformed faith. It would not be fair,
he said, to the 150 Presbyteries who haj
asked for some relief If the subject was
dismissed by the assembly. >
When the afternoon senior wasÂ» rnllM
to order, the Rev. J. W. Dinsmore of
California moved that the vote on LÂ»r.
Banks' amendment, dismissing the whole
subject, be taken at 4:30 o'clock, and that
speeches be limited to ten minutes. The
motion was carried. General Louis Wag
ner of this city spoke against revision.
The Rev. Dr. Robert M. Patterson of
Pennsylvania declared it had been said
on the floor of the assembly that the con
fession of faith was not believed. This
brought- Dr. Johnson of Chicago to his
feet with the query: "I want to know who
says we do not bellleve the confession of
faith?" .
"I call Dr. Johnson to order," sajd a
voice in the assembly,
"Dr. Patterson has the floor," an
nounced the moderator.
Dr. Patterson concluded his speech wfth
the announcement that he was unalter
ably opposed to any change in the con
fession. Dr. W. H. Roberts, stated clerk,
declared himself in favor of a declaratory
statement. The amendment dismissing
the subject was lost by an overwhelming
rrajority. â¢ .

New York Company

NEW YORK, May 24.â State Game Pro
tector John E. Overton having entered the
Arctic Fieezins Company's storage-house
oh West street claims he found in cne
room 2000 partridges, quail, grouse and
ether game,, the shooting or possession of
which in this State out of season Is pun
ishable by K fir.e of $60 for ; the flr3t bird
killed or held in possession and $25 for
each other bird. .
The president of Ihe storage company
went to the Police Court with Overton,
where an "agreement was* made not to
search all the rooms in the place until to
day. Overton and a policeman will watch
the place and examine every package go
ing out.
The president of the company said that
he did not own a single bird in the place,
and he did not know who did the storing.
Assistant District Attorney Walsh said it
looked as if there would be a huge fine to
be paid. The possession of birds out of
season is a misdemeanor, punishable by
fine, and if the birds are such as to make
the company liable the fines will run up
into an enormous amount. He places the
sum total at $1,000,000. . ; .. , ;.. .y

Minnesota is alarming. â Since April 22
1161 cases have been reported to the State
Board, and this totalwas to-day reported

on this report,. Dr. Bracken said this aft

"The condition in the country districts
is worse now than it has been at any time
during the past three years, and the pros
pect for next winter is truly alarming un
less officials and the people In general at
tend to the duties devolving upon them
in preventing the spread of the disease.
The increase of the disease at this time is
largely due to the return of lumbermen
from the northern part of this State and

Welcome.
FIVE hundred men and , women,
with pride of Revolutionary an
cestry welling up in loyal
hearts, greeted their compatriot.
President McKinley, yesterday
afternoon at the Palace Hotel
with an enthusiasm and affection
due to their recognition of his stalwart
patriotism and devotion to the flag whose 1
origin and subsequent glory 'are owing so
largely to the efforts of their fathers'
fathers. The reception was given by the
Sons and Daughters of the American Rev
olution and the Loyal Legion.
None of the smaller receptions in honor
of the President has been marked by
more pleasant features than was this one.
A certain homogeneity in character and
purpose among the men and women pres-
ent lent harmony and dignity to. the occa-*
sion, and the quiet underflow of patriotic
sentiment was strong and unmistakable.
The members of the three socletie's be
gan to. arrive early, and before 1 o'clock:
they had been admitted to the room com
monly used as the American dining-room,
where the reception was to Â¦ be held. By
1:30 o'clock, when the President arrived,
probably 500 people -were present. Many
prominent society matrons, handsome, ele
gantly dressed young women and vener
able men prominent in business and pro
fessional circles were present.
The President's carriage was driven
into tfie court and he was escorted direct
to the reception hall." An aisle had been
kept open -along the north side of the
room, down which he was ushered to a
small platform at the west end of the j
room. -...-,-â¢

Best Beloved Since Washington.
The appearance of the President was,
the signal for the beginning of a storm
of applause that lasted until Colonel Jor
dan stepped forward to introduce the dis
tinguished guest. Colonel Jordan said:
Sons and Daughters of the American Revo
lution, members of the Loyal Lesion: Lan
guage with all its wealth of words and gran
deur of description cannot express our pleas
ure after weeks of expectant waiting to be
hold in our midst the genial face and beloved
form of William McKinley, our chief magis
trate; one who, as has been said, is,, since
Washington, the best beloved of our Presidents,
one wbo -by his conservative and far-reaching
statesmanship and sterling patriotism has en
deared himself to the American people. When
the historian records the names of the Presi

the four names that will be 'written are Wash

Mr. .President, the descendants of those who
In 1776 gave to the country Jts liberties and
sent down to us our institutions, dedicated bj
their blood, and these members of the Loyal
Legion, who witji you in 1S61 fought for the
perpetuity of those institutions and libertiesâ
these greet you to-day. We welcome you most .
cordially.
And now, ladies and gentlemen. It gives me
great pleasure to introduce our compatriot,
William McKinley, President of the United
States.
An outburst of. enthusiastic â¢ applause
followed the closing words of the speaker.
The President Speaks. r
President McKinley spoke as follows:*
Members of the Sons of the Revolution,
Daughters of the American Revolution and My
Companions of the Loyal Legion: It gives me
peculiar satisfaction and pleasure to be i greeted
here in the city of San Francisco by the mem
bers of these historic associations, and I salute
with reverence and affection this chapter which
was the origin and beginning of the now most
memorable organization known as the Sons of
the American Revolution. (Applause.) It was
here that the first order of this great associa
tion was established. It has spread all over the'
country and is doing magnificent work not only
in preservtng--the historic relics and caring for
the historic battle grounds, but is teaching to
our children the blessed history of the sacrifices
of the American Revolution.
This association links the past with the pres
ent. Here to-day are descendants of those who
NINE-HOUR DAY
ON RAILROADS
Machinists Will Make a
New Demand on
Employers.
Failure, to Comply Will Give
Cause for Tremendous
Â¦ v ' Strike. â¢
WASHINGTON. May 24.â President
James O'Connell of the International As
sociation of Machinists announced this
afternon that ho would recommend to the
next annual convention of machinists, at
Toronto, beplnnlg June 3. that a date be
set for a nine-hour day without reduction
in wages on all the railroads of the coun
try. On railroads which fall to comply
with this demand a strike will be ordered.
This recomendation will be made In Mr.
O'Connell's annual report. Mr. O'Connell
EÂ«ys that such a strike would involve
probably 100,000 men. including 40,000 ma
chinists. . .'Â¦*Â¦.
The policy will be to enforce the demand
by tying up practically the. entire mechan
ical service of the roads. It was simply
a matter of policy, he said, that the rail
roads were not included In, the present
strike. Although a number of them are
now involved, none of the roads were
originally contemplated in the order de
claring the present strike. Mr. O'Connell
says the convention will doubtless fix a
date when the nine-hour day must be In
operation on all roads, and he beiieves
this date should be some day in the
autumn.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon Mr. O'Con
nell said the outlook. of the present strike
was very gratifying. The headquarters of
the strike has been shifted from Washing
ten to Toronto, for which city President
O'Connell left to-night.
NEW YORK, May 24.â Representatives
of the manufacturers of the metal trades
of New Jersey, New England and New
York held a conference in this city to-day
to consider the best means of stopping the
strike of the International Association of
Machinists. N. B. .Payne of Klmira pre
sided.
A. B. See. head of the A. B. See Eleva
tor Company, who was at the meeting,
when asked concerning the meeting said:
"There are 200 men here who are metal
trades manufacturers, -and they are a
unit in the decision to resist the demands
of the strikers. The machinists have vio
lated their agreement. Even if we did
give in to them and let them have the
nine-hour day with ten hours' pay, what
of the future? Their action is inspired by
labor leaders.
"Prom the printed reports sent from
O'Connell's office in Washington you
would think that our people are givingr
up the fight, but it is not right. A few
manufacturers are giving up, but as many
as 75 -per cent are standing firm.
"There was no need for this strike.
Most of the manufacturers wouia have
given the demands willingly, but the men
had l:*en ordered to strike months ago.
They are only hurting themselves by this.
We cannot trust these labor leaders and
are not going to put ourselves in a posi
tion to be dictated to In the future."
COUNCIL RECEIVES REFOBTS.
Delegates Assure Labor Body That
Strike Is Progressing Favorably. ..
The meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council at Pythian Hall last night
brought together a large number of dele
gates, but resulted in little being disclosed
concerning the strike.
Reports were made by representatives
of the various unions, which showed that
the ironworkers were with
by the labor organizations, but nothing
new developed in the situation. .'
The Machinists' Union delegate reported
a. stagnant condition of affairs regarding
the strike.
The delegate from the Moldero' Union
reported that the stand of that organiza
tion had been reported to the international
body and a reply is expected within a few
days.
The delegates from the Metal Polishers'
Union informed the council that five shops
had been unionized and that their strike
was progressing favorably.
J. C. Lane, representing the Cooks and
Waiters, said in an interview that the
FtrlkP tituatlon so far as they were con
cerned had suffered little change. Five
additional restaurants had been added to
the list of union establishments, two of
which were new places started by men
whu were out on strike.
It was decided by the council to com
municate with President. Gompers of the
American Federation of Labor requesting
that Organizer Pierce be allowed to re
main In this city until July 1, as his pres
ence was greatly needed.
CHARGES OF CONGER
NOT WELL FOUNDED
The council declared its intention of
levying a boycott on the American Bak
?ry. at 637 Broadway; F. Hageman, 1057
Howard street, and Sehmitz's bakery, at
243 Second street. The boycott was or
dered because these places furnished
bread to bakeries whose men were out on
strike.

' Admiral- Remey has promulgated the
finding in a special order, which complete
ly-exonerates Captain Hall from the
charge, and finds that the only matter
of .substance sustained in the charges is
an error of judgment, in connection with
the withdrawal of his troops at a critical
moment from the Tartar wall.

Secretary* Root Receives Rec
ommendations From
Commissioners.
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1403 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 24,-Major Gen
eral MacArthur has sent to the War De
partment the official orders he has Issued
In several cases of spies caught within the
American lines. One of the men tried was
Lorenzo Pricto, a Spaniard, who while
employed in Southern Luzon as an agent
of a Manila copra firm sent to the insur
gent general Callles and his subordinates
all tho military information he could
gather. The commission which tried
Prieto sentenced him to be hanged, but
General MacArthur commuted the sen
tence to ten years' imprisonment.
A society of dacoits has been formed in
Luzon to exterminate "American spies"â
natives friendly to the United States
forces. Juan Crisostomo Benedicto was
murdered by his servants at the instiga
tion of the chief of the dacoits. The na
tives were sentenced to be hanged. Nine
natives charged with the murder of Horo
taVuisumbing, a Viscayan merchant, who
was loyal to the American Government,
Â¦were each hanged or sentenced to impris'
eminent for twenty years. They were
members of a band of Mando dacoits,
whose chief office was to kidnap such
men as were reputed to be friends of the
Americans or obnoxious to tlie insurgent
authorities. General Callles paid some na
tives 20 pesos for the crime. To others he
paid a large sum.
Secretary Hoot received to-day the re
port and recommendations of the Philip
pine Commission as to the form of civil
government to be instituted in the archi
pelago on July 1. The Secretary declined
to make the recommendations of the
Â«-ommission public, explaining that he had
rot yet read them. Besides, he desires to
present the report to the President and to
discuss the views of the commission with
that official and members of the Cabinet.
]t is generally understood that .Judge
Taft is to be made Governor of the Phil
ippines and that the other members of
the commission are to form his Cabinet.
Anticipating the establishment of civil
government, the commission has been giv
ing civil rules to provinces, and it is pre
sumed that the recommendations made
are an application of the provincial gov
ernment system to the entire archipelago.
FEABS SECOND EEV0LUTI0N.
Judge Neer Says There Is Danger in
Eeorganizing the Judiciary.
MANILA, May Â£4.â The discontent
amTg the natives at the appointment of
American Judges and alleged discrimina
tion in the civil servicG in favor of Ameri
cans is finding expression, encouraged by
some of the native Judges, who are aware
That the reorganization of the judiciary
vrill result in the loss of their positions.
Judge Neer of the Court of First ln-
Ptance of Tondo. one of the leaders of
what is beginning to be called the radical
wing of the Federalists, declared to-day
that if such things continue there will bo
a second revolution. Some of the promi
r.ont Federalists ridicule the prediction.
The Philippine Commission's selection
of Judges was thoroughly considered. It
is undeniable that most of the native
Judges lack the competence reauired. One
of them has been removed for malfeas
nt}c* and others, ara nuspected of irregu
larities. The classlrtcatlons of the civil
service avoid discriminations, but native
and SpanFh qualifications .ire not equal
to those of capable Americans. Some de
railments arc employing natives at tho
risk of temporary inconvenience.
After a conference with General Mac-
Arthur General Trias has undertaken ne

The order issued by the King of Great
Britain for his first entry into Parliament
Includes a requirement that women par
ticipating shall wear dresses cut low. The
affair will take place in tho afternoon.
The order must, therefore, shock the
American flunkies, who maintain that a
swallow-tail coat and a low-necked gown
must never be worn before 6 o'clock, sum
mer or winter. There are men and women
who profoundly wish that neither a swal
low-tail coat nor a low-necked dress
should ever be worn, with an exception in
favor of cutting 1 out the dress bodice mod
estly for coolness in the heated term.
The objection to the royal and imperial
British order for low-necked dresses when
the Emperor of India opens the houses of
Parliament Is, however, purely humane.
Every woman who can will endeavor to
be present on so exciting an occasion. The
order Is absolute as to exposure of the
shoulders and bust to winter weather,
whatever it may be that day. Pneumonia
la as prevalent in London as In Chicago,
perhaps more so. The doctors will have
a profitable increase of business following
the day the Emperor of India appears be
fore Parliament. â¢
Nor should the new monarch be hastily
censured for this barbarous ritual. He
has said that he will follow the steps of
the late monarch, who never relaxed or
suspended this rule at her drawing rooms,
always held by day, and always the cause
of serious illness, with their full propor
tion of consequent deaths.
This is one of tho objects for which
monarchies are maintained â to thin out
the population.â Chicago Chronicle.

Is going through tho novel experience ot

most unusual course .of . gplng to Southr
ampton to welcome home the executive.
Chamberlain also ift to give an ostenta
tious luncheon to* Sir, Alfred "Mllner. to
which, however, a number of leading Lib-'
erals have declined Invitations. The visit
has been trumpeted through the ministe
rial organs as a fitting occasion for a
great popular demonstration in support of
the Chamberlain-Milner, war policy, but
public enthusiasm is lacking. . \
Sir Alfred when ho arrived at South-'
ampton to-day was formally welcomed by
the Mayor and corporation. In a brief re
ply tho High Commissioner said he had
been greatly benefited by the voyage. He
said he had come home for rest and not
to make speeches, * ,
When Sir Alfred arrived in London an
unusually distinguished crowd greeted him
upon the platform. The first person to
seize his hand wan Lord. Salisbury, who
formally welcomed him. ' Then, in quick
succession came Chamberlain, Lord Rob
erts, A. J. Balfour, Lord Halsbury, War
Secretary Brodrick,' Lord .Cranborne and
other Cabinet Ministers and a half-hun
dred Dukes and Earls and other personal
friends of lower degree pressed forward
to shake the High Commissioner's; hand.
All remarked how well Sir Alfred^. was
looking. Ho chatted with Lord Salisbury
and Chamberlain and then went out of
the station.' A fair-sized crowd cheered
him heartily. Sir Alfred left the railroad
Rtatlon in a carriage and* went to see the
King.

CAPE TOWN, May 24.â A great concert
ed moverrient under General Blndon Blood
against the Boers is proceeding in the
Eastern Transvaal. Commandant Vlljoen
has been tf-ying to escape to the north, but
so far without success. The movements
of the various columns under General
Blood have been attended with the usual
sniping by small parties of burghers.. The
only time the Boers made any attempt at
a stand was at a point near Dalmanutna,
where the Carolina commando attempted
to hold offlthe British under Colonel Doug
las while their cattle and wagons were
being driven oft. The British had almost
turned the Boer position when the
burghers retired.
PRETORIA. May 24.â Tho troops of the
cattle rangers' corps which waa organ
ized by Colonel Morgan have returned to
Pretoria from Wolvenhoek. They had a
number of exciting adventures and sev

excellent scouting they succeeded in get
ting through the Boer lines with 40,000
sheep and 4000 cattle. The Doers lost seven
killed in encounters with this corps.
BLOEMFONTEIN. May 24.â It is report

that a special agreement be made by the
powers prohibiting individual action for
the collection of indemnity or Interest on
bonds or a loan floated, or a seizure of
territory in case of the failure of China
to pay. Germany has indicated a disposi
tion to favor the proposal: the United
States approves, and'Rusaia and France,
by their previous declarations, have
shown that they do not proposo to pursue
any other course.
Tho vital Question before the oowers at
this time is that of indemnity. Consider
able discussion is in progress between the
powers as to how the money shall be
raised. Russia and I*ra nee .favor a loan,
guaranteed, If not by all nations, at least
by some; tho United States and Great

"This Is a hearing of taxpayers." paid
the Mayor, "for the purpose of consider
ing the budget."
"I differ with you there." said Center.
"I have not Been the budget except what
was published of it in the newspapers. I
would like to havo a printed copy," and
it was so ordered.
"We believe there Is too much money
spent by the Board of Public "Works for
salaries," said Popper, "In comparison
with the work done. We think the funds
of that body should be segregated so that
it could bo ascertained exactly for what
purposes they were spent. 1 lathis board
does not see to It that the amount of sal
aries be limited and the- funds segregated
we will submit the proposition to a vote
of the people for charter amendment. The
Boards of Public Works and Health
should be restricted in their expenditures
as well as those of the County Clerk. The
Health Board has now more employes on
its roll . than ever before. TVe object to
doctors acting as sanitary inspectors and
keeping their private office hours."
Popper began to read a list of doctors
In the employ of the Health Board who
tend to private cases, when the Mayor In
terrupted by saying: ' '
"I thought you said attorneys?"
"We have not got that far,'* said Pop
per, "but I've no doubt that we can flud
some of them in the same category."
'We should not pay for the mainten
ance of feeble-minded children," con
tinued Popper, "nor should we contribute
to the support of the Magdalen Asylum."
Brandenstein suggested that Popper be
given an opportunity to familiarize him
self with the proposed budget and make
suggestions at a later date. Curtis aske<l
Popper to furnish a statement showing
the employes in the various departments
whom he deemed unnecessary.
Secretary Emery of the Board of Health
made a defense of his department. He
declared that figures of expenditures hi
other cities used for comparison with this
city were unreliable and did not state the
conditions as they existed.
George Center held that the budget wn*
not before the board, as ho had not
seen it.
Too Much Money for Salaries.
"Did I come here to be lectured?"
i "You are here as a long-suffering citi
zen," facetiously replied the Mayor.
Max Popper of the Mission Federated
Clubs was called upon ' to express his
views. He had not proceeded far when
Supervisor Hotallng scored Win for hav
ing signed the communication of the
clubs criticizing the Mayor and Supervis
ors for alleged Improper expenditures put
of the urgent necessity fund during thÂ«
year' 130-1901. Popper had. said that so
many requests had been made for thÂ«
needs of different districts that he had no
desire to prolong the agony. â¢
"I would suggest," said Hotalirig, "that
if Mr. Popper's criticism is gauged by his
strictures on this board in regard to thÂ«
urgent necessity fund, that he do not pro
long the agony and sit down."
Popper contended that the board van
spending moneys for urgent necessities
which were not no ' regarded by his im
provement club. He objected to spending
$2)4 for the Supervisors' hand books and
$400 for buggies for the Assessor out of
the urgent necessity, fund. He suggested
that a miscellaneous fund be created for
minor expenditures, and Brandenstein â¢
agreed with him. Braunhart disagreed
with the latter and contended that thÂ«Â»
Supervisors were - competent to - judge of
the necessity of expenditures. Braunhart
waxed eloquent, which caused Popper to
remark:
The Board of Supervisors met last night
to resume consideration ot the next tax
budget as recommended by the Finance
Committee, and to hear suggestions of
citizens and taxpayers thereon. The meet
ing: was principally devoted to a discus
sion of what constitutes "urgent neces
sity" In the city's expenditures, which
has called forth criticism from an im
provement club. The Board of Public
Â¦Works came In for Its usual share of crit
icism for spending much money with lit
tle results. , â¢;.*

THE Seattle Times* finds itself enraged by The
Call's use of the term "Altbryangeldism" to de
scribe that queer political mixture which has
been on tap in this country since 1896. Our critic de
clares that it is unAmerican to indulge in such criti
cism of the minority party, and asks if it is wise or
prudent to do so "in a republic like ours, where the
safety of the nation and the liberties of the^pebple
depend upon a very equal division of the people into
political parties."
The republic and the liberties of the people seem
to have stood that sort of thing very well so far, and
we are unable to comprehend how they are endan
gered by criticizing a minority and not by serving a
majority party the scmc^way. 'The Times seasons,
adorns and illustrates its lecture on propriety by call
ing Republicanism "Hannaism" and declaring that "it
has uniformly stood for oppression, while Bryanism
and* Altgeldism have always stood for greater liberty
and greater benefits to the common people, and as
between the two every honest man will choose Bryan
ism. even with all the sneers and leers which such
publications as The Call may choose to make."
Now that is good. Twice the whole people have
had the chance to choose between the two, and ac
cording to this Seattle oracle all the honest ones have
chosen Bryanism. Then a vast majority of our people
are not honest. .
The Times should go and study logic for a few
years, and then take such a turn in physics as to learn
not to sit on a limb and saw the same off between
itself and the tree. \
We believe in freedom of criticism and that the
same rule applies to minority and majority parties and
is equally American. The people are the final judges;
They sift the wheaffrom the chaff, the true from the
false, as they did in 1896 and â¢ 1000. We deny the
Times' position that only dishonest men voted against
Bryan. To admit is to disclose the. most horrible
situation that can be conceived for a republic. We
do not deny that the supporters of Mr. Bryan hon
estly believed that they were doing right, but we
think, as do a large majority of our countrymen, that
they were wrong. .;
No doubt Mr. Bryan is a. model of .the domestic
and civic virtues, but he can be that and at the same
time be the most fantastic freak that has ever cavorted
and kicked high in American politics. His principles
_re certainly not Democratic, when measured by the
teachings of Jefferson or passed upon by the best
living experts on the subject of Democracy. If the
country Ms deprived of the benefits of two political
parties, nearly equally divided, no one but Mr. Bryan
is to blame.' He has alienated the common s^nse of
the country from fhe party he has created and led,
and an equal 'division is not possible, till he gets out
of the way.

f-> UCH State elections as will be held this fall will
not be of much interest to the nation as a
S^ whole, but in the. commonwealths where' they
are to occur the political pot is already beginning to
boil, and in two of them, Virginia and Ohio, it is
probable the contests will be quite vigorous.
It has' been hitherto deemed fairly certain that in
Ohio the Republicans would renominate Governor
Nash, but recently there have appeared evidences of
a considerable opposition to him. It is quite likely
of course that when the convention meets the oppo
sition will prove to have been more noisy than strong,
but none -the less- it i* making a pretense at least of
getting up an. earnest fight against him. In one re
spect the Governor is fortunate in having such an
opposition, for according to the reports that come to
us the main argument used against him is that he
has made himself unpopular by stopping the Cin
cinnati prize-fight. It is safe to say that"any votes
he may lose among the sporting Element on that ac
count will be more than compensated by those of
good citizens who respect him for the action.
- The Democrats of Ohio are approaching the con
test with the usual number of faction fights by way of
preliminaries. There are some among them who wish
John R. McLean to run again and open another bar
rel. Others. would like Tom L. Johnson to make the
race. Johnson, however, seems determined to. re
main out of it himself and to be doing his best to
keep McLean out also- He has declared in favor of
nominating John J. Lentz, formerly a Congressman
of some notoriety. Lentz is known as an ultra
partisan and cannot be expected to win over any Re
publican voters, so it would seem that Johnson is
willing to have a Democratic defeat this fall rather
than have a victory that might bring into public view
an Ohio Democrat to compete with him for the sup L
port of the party as a candidate for the Presidency. â¢
In Iowa as soon as the Republicans have nominated
their candidate all will be over but the shouting. The
interest in the situation there is. due to the relations
of Minister Conger to the nomination for Governor.
It seems tobe conceded'he can'have it if he wishes,
but rfs yet he appears undecided" whether to return to
China or to stay at home and bel Governor.
From Virginia- c6me reports th'at riot since* the-* days;
of Mahone has there'been sucrra "contest for the Gov
ernorship as that now going* on? between Attorney
General Montague and Congressman Swanson. It
is said Swanson represents thg* machine -and Mon
tague is making a whirlwind .^canyass J 'Of the Statp
for the purpose of rousing the. young .pemocrac^
against the 'bosses. " In his speeches he has* bitterly
denounced the administration oj party (affairs irf~thÂ£
State and is meeting with enthusiastic '-Teceptiori's'
wherever he goes. - t ;'â¢,:.-'* Â¦*Â¦Â¦ X- Â¦}?Â¦*;? J' 1' Â¦Â¦'. :'
Maryland is to elect two State officers, and the an
nouncement that Gorman would take personal charge
of the campaign has given something' of national in
terest to the election. New.Jersey is to electfa Gov
ernor, and Massachusetts and . Pennsylvania ".are to
elect State officers, but in. neither is' there any< doubt
about the. result or any considerable campaigning
being done. * . ' "â¢
Perhaps the most interesting -contest oT'the year
will be that in New' York City, where Hill has or
ganized a Democratic fight against >Tamm'any, and
where tW citizens of all parties â¢seem 'determined at
.last" to elect an; honest -'. munioipal administration.
That election, moreover, is likely to be the most im
portant as well as the most interesting, for whatever
concerns Tammany Hall concerns nationalas welLas
local politics, and consequently the whole; cquntry
may.be affected by the result of the vote in the city.
The railroad men are oil course making every ef
fort'tp handle the business and to, be. ready for future
expansion. The American . Economist notes that
within a space of two weeks orders were given by va
rious roads for upward .of 2000 freightcars. , Of course
passenger-cars â¢ and locomotives > will < be Â¦ . ordered ' in 1

condition\of 'the' country. if at this time our railroads
were under Government control and we had* to wait
for^Congress to meet and make an appropriation be

'locomotives?./ > . .â¢ . r f Â¦ .
A recent -dispatch from Philadelphia said: ".With
orders enough ahead to ' keep five hundred hands
busily erilployedlof months, the blanket mills of Wil
liam & James Stafford in Manayunk have shut down,
to remain closed for two weeks. This unusual con
dition is due to the fact, it is stated, that all the stor
age room' the company has at its command is choked
with manufactured goods, : andi it is unable to, ; get
transportation facilities to carry the products away.
Haifa thousand wage-earners "are thus thrown out of
work when, under ordinary conditions, they might
be actively arid uninterruptedly engaged. Both.the
Pennsylvania and Reading railroads are accessible
to the Stafford mills, and both corporations have
been appealed to, but owing to. the generally prosper
ous .state of business in* the Manayunk manufactories
the roads are having the greatest difficulty intrying to
tak"e care of the business offered theni."
While the validity of the argument -may be â¢ dis
puted, it is undeniable "that -at* present the tremen
dous expansion of-Arherican energy in traffic and
travel has surpassed the preparations made for
handling it by, evert the most enterprising roads. It
will be remembered that .'some.. difficulty was expe
rienced in this State in obtaining cars to handle the
citrus fruit <*rop, and the situation seems to be far
worse in the East.
RECENTLY in. a discussion of the question. /of
rates of fare offered by railway companies to
the Pan-American Exposition some authorities
on railroad matters argued, that if rates, were; fixed; at
what-^are known as popular^prices the^movement of
passenger travel would be larger than the roads. can'
handle. One of them said railroad officials "should
remember that all' who?; travel are- riot attracted -by
cheap excursions, and that those who do not want to
go to the fair have. a right to. demand that their regu
lar service shall not be disturbed." '.â¢ v I
ELECTIONS OF THE YEAR.
IT is expected that Mrs. McKmley's' gratifying ' improvement and rapid convalescence
: will permit the President's party to leave for Washington to-day." The gratification
felt by: the people at this close of ;the President's visit originates entirely in happiness
' ; .;.;<i; at the recovery of $Irs. McKinley. Californians have 'not^ tired of, his sojourn and
would willingly see V it extended, if under conditions agreeable to him and his.
While his tour \tas necessarily, shortened by the unforeseen circumstance 'of his
wife's illness, it has been beneficial to the West and \ to/Western interests. He and his
Cabinet have received new impressions of the vastness of the country and the rapid multi
plication of its very varied interest's. They have, traversed the expanse of country that /has.
always been spread out under the skies, and have been impressed by the use, and develop
ment of its resources by the touch of man's hand and his energy arid enterprise. East of
the Mississippi is a . great country wrought upon by a dense population. But .this side of
that river lies a vaster domain and of more varied natural resources wKich invites and will
sustain an equally. dense and a far. more enterprising population. . . Â¦ -j
_; ;, 'Heretofore this larger part of our share of the continent has been somewhat neg
lected : by the Government. But this condition will be mitigated by such tours as the
President has undertaken. It was purely unselfish on his part. He is not loqking ; to a
further renewal of the honors worthily bestowed by his" countrymen, and has no projected
interest as a candidate in the future- His purpose was purely public and economic, 'and
related to the interests of the people! Of. our people he;has; been able r to form a most
favorable judgment. They have all been his neighbors and his friends, sharing j with? him
the days of anxiety to which he was providentially subjectra^a^^g^^^^ffin^^sc)
the pleasure and happiness of the passing of the cloud which was for a time upon him;
'^His influence in national affairs has always been on the side of development of the
whole country/symmetrically and 'harmoniously. *â¢ ' /Â¦ â¢
He can certainly point to the triumphant working out of- his economic ideas in the
prosperity of all the people, and we may depend' upon him to urge the application of his
policies to the further, more rapid and, needed development of the West.. }S:
Especially do our Pacific seaports need public attention. This coast wants mare
and better harbor lights, buoys and signals. . We need more lightships. If wireless ter
legraphy justify the expectations it has raised, we want a wireless telegraph station on the
Farallones, and on certain islands of the Aleutian archipelago, in the interest of naviga
tion and for the use of the weather service. We need attention to .the interests of. navi- 1
gation on this coast equal to that on the Atlantic. The weather/service now enjoys tele
graphic facilities in the West Indies.. The great storms born' there are now; notifiedto the
whole Atlantic coast, so that immense saving results from the cautioning of sea. com
merce, and its warning of the coming storm. ' Hatteras is s'hprn of much of its terrors and
the losses of commerce are minimized. -^
If the country is to be' great its greatness. must extend to all its borders. If it is to
be permanently prosperous that prosperity, must be general and not partial or sectional.
These ends are brought within easier reach by the tour^of the president, and the
people will reasonably expect economic results of the greatest â¢value'Vo them. . ;
California speeds the parting guest with a genuine effusior/of feeling. Our hospi
tality is unspent and we would gladly express it in more .emphatic terms' should occasion
require. V ,

,' When it was founded,. a hundred years
ago,. the Library of Congress was created
merely as a. convenient to the members
of Congress, andjt. still retains the title
which was then given to it, although. its
functions have broadened." It is now a
library of general scope; It is in a building
distinct from the Capitol; it is performing
a .service; to^the 'executive Â¦departments
and to -the public .'at "large, and if main
tains _the Copyright Office, which is 'â¢ as'
distinctively administrative in - its func
tibhs as is" the - Patent Office.' BuV consti
tutionally, the i library is not classed with
the' executive departments of the Govern
ment. The Librarian is, to be sure, desig
nated by .the President of the United
States; but the Librarian administers the
library under the | direct supervision of
Congress; he appoints his subordinates
under rules prescribed by Congress; he
applies directly to Congress for the appro
priations for the maintenance of the li
brary, and he renders his* annual report
direct to Congress. There is not in the
case of the library, asHhere i3 in the case
of the ; various scientific bureaus of Wash
ington, a higher executive intervening be
tween it and the legislative authority.
Founding of the Great Library.
The Library of Congress was created by
act of Congress In the year 1800. The cen
tennial of Washington as the Capital City
is also,' therefore, the centonnlal -of the
library. But in 18U the existing collection
(some 3000 volumes) was entirely destroyed
by the fire which the British troops start
ed in the Capitol. The private library of
ox-President Jefferson (6700 volumes) was
soon after purchased by Congress, and
formed the basis for a. now growth. This
continued until 1851, when a second fire,
this time accidental, destroyed all but 20,
000 of the 55,000 then existing volumes.
Since that .catastrophe, however, the
growth has been uninterrupted and has
had special impetus from several sources.
Seventy-five thousand dollars was appro
priated to repair immediate losses, and
later, two great .special purchases were
made, one of the collection of- Peter Force
and the other of the munuscrlpts of â¢ the
Marquis do Rochambeau. In 1866 the
books in possession of the Smithsonian
Institution, (amounting to 40,000 volumes,
were transferred to the library, with an
agreement that future accessions through
exchange should follow. In 1870'the copy
right work was transferred to the library
and with it the. two copies of publications
required to be filed to perfect the entry
for copyright, â¢ ; , â¢ ' Â¦Â¦.-.-.
These events, however, tended chiefly to
the enlargement of the collection. It had
been founded as a library for the use of
Congress. Its scope was now broadened
from one limited to the requirements of a
legislative -body to one whose limits were
but . the limits of recorded knowledge.
Otherwise, however, the ninety-seven
years from the creation to the opening of
the new building in 1897 had produced no
organic change. There was a: great ac
cumulation of matrlal,.lmt it was as yet
undifferentlated. - -The staff increased
from one person to forty-two persons, but
it also was undifferentiated.
Reorganizing the .Vast Collections.
I The new building implied-a, purpose *f or
the -library .'far: widen than -that of j its
founding. The building was not a mere
wing of the Capitol, it was set apart dis
tinct. It was designed and completed as
the ' largest, most commodious library
building in the world; also the most dec
orative and the most costly. It was ca
pable of a broad and a highly differenti
ated service which had not been possible
in the crowded room and with the over
burdened administration at the Capitol.
Since 1897 the library has been-undergo
ing a reorganization with reference to this
broader- and more highly specialized serv
ice.- The material itself, which had been
accumulating; In mass, has been set apart,
siftfd and summarily classified; the print
ed books and namphlets now form one di
vision, the. documents another,- the manu
scrips another, the maps and charts an
other, the music another, the, Smithsonian
deposit another, the prints still' another."
There is now a distinct group of employes
Â¦with a responsible chief for each one of
these divisions. â¢ There is also a distinct
group dfivoting itself exclusively -to the
business involved in the acquisition of
material, whether by purchase, gift or
exchange; another group Is attending ex
clusively to its receipt; another group is
occupied exclusively with the classifica
tion of thi3 material and Its preparation
for use in the way of catalogues and
other aids. The direct service to the
reader, besides having attention in each
one* of these several i divisions handling
the special material (documents, manu
scripts, maps, music and prints) has its
general and liberal provision, in the main
reading room, in the reading room for the
current periodicals and in the reading
room for the blind, and a specialized serv-'
ice from a distinctive group of workers
who are prepared . to aid in . inquiries In
volving elaborate research. . â¢ '
Large Force Now Employed.
Auxiliary to . all the a*bove is a fully
equipped bindery for the repair. and bind
ing of the library â¢ books - and a printing
office for the . printing of the catalogue
cards and forms, and of the bibliographic
publications. The copyright work is now
set off in a distinct division employing the
exclusive services of forty-five persons, 1 a
number greater than the ! entire staff of
the llbrary'in the old building.
Distinct again from 'all of these divisions
having, the custody'of special material or
special functions with reference to the
material as a whole, is a small group at
the head of which is the librarian in chief,
having the general administrative super
vision of "the work as a whole. . ' .. '
-The building and grounds are cared for
by a separate i orgaijizatlonâ engineers,
janitors, etc.â under; a superintendent,
himself . appointed by. the President. This
official . acts also as disbursing - agent for
all payments made out of, the library, ap
propriations. -..- Â¦Â¦*â¢' '.. - â¢
The present employes ' in . the library
proper number 185 and in the Copyright
forty-five, -while the care of the
building and ground's requires now a force
(Including charwomen) of 111 persons. Only
statistics can make, evident such require
ments. The building with. its courts,cov
ers three and one-half acres of ground; It
includes over 10,000,000 cubic feet and eight
acres of floor .space;- it. has 2150 windows
to be kept clean; , It .is finished in costly
marble and mosaics and i decorated with
costly paintings, which must' receive as
siduous care, -and it employs elaborate
machinery â heating and . ventilating < ap
paratus,' elevators, book railways and
pneumatic tubes-^-which must, be smoothly
operated and kept in order.
Present Size of the Collections.
~ An- average 'Â¦. 'Â¦ of . 2200 persons visit V this
building every day In the year. It is wired
for 6000 electric lamps and its heating're
quires ' 3000 tons of coal : per annum. Its
care. and the responsibility for its proper
maintenance and physical , equipment rest
with its . superintendent, not. with | the- Li
brarian. Special appropriations are placed
at* his disposal, which : now average about
$92,000 a year. This is exclusive of appro
priations for furniture and shelving 1 , which
are ,â¢ granted ; as the gradual. equipment- of
the. rooms; for. particular ..uses progresses.

XV.â THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
But being a national library, its duties
extend still ' further. â¢ It should render
whatever â¢ service is within its power to
scholarly research all over , the United
States, and, as a fact, it endeavors to da
so. Inquiries come to it by mail from
every State in the Union. It. answers
them directly so far as it is able, and
where the answer cannot be given out of
the material in its possession it. seeks to
indicate where it may be had.
Now these inquiries, as well as those ad
dressed to it officially. . involve almost
every branch of human knowledge, which
has any literature; many, also that- have
no literature. To answer, it must, so far
as possible, have books; it must have the
bibliographies showing what â¢ books exist
on any given subject- in addition to those
which it- has; it must have catalogues
showing what of these books are in its
own collection; and, so far as possible,
catalogues of other collections showing
where are, to be found those books which
it- dees not possess. I Lastly, it must have
the men competent not merely, to~ produce
a given book specifically - namedâ this is
the easiest and simplest serviceâ but com
petent to advise as to . what literature
exists upon a given subject and the rela
tive bearing, of each book upon! a given
subject of inquiry, and the best method
of. pursuing that inquiry so far as it-in
volves the use of books. . Now this is a
highly expert service. It - means . a . corns
of specialists. \ Such specialists the library
always possesses within certain depart
ments of knowledge. It Is endeavoring to
ecure still. more, and. in addition its re
lations . -with - the scientific â¢ bureaus at
Washington enable It often to supply from
those bureaus the scientific "opinion as to
this or that matter of inquiry which it
cannot supply . from Its own staff" in
time, : therefore, . its endeavor to' become a
bureau of information for the entire coun
try is likely. to be realized in a very b-oad
sense. -At . present : it is in Itself equipped
particularly, to answer with expert opinion
inquiries Â¦Â¦ invplving: history and:-tonoe
raphy, particularly of America; > geneal
pgy, political and social science, statistics
including the legislation of various coun^
tries, and 'general, literature. ... r
â¢The processes of the library "do not "es
sentially differ, from â¢ those In any other
largo : and * active : reference library - Thp
effort is.' first., to select the 'book which Is
.to;bc got; second," to get it; third, to pre
pare It for.use; fourth, to make it useful.

Washington is, moreover, itself becom
ing the center of research for scholars in
general, particularly ' in the departments
of history, law, . political and social sci
ence, ethnology and those natural and)
physical sciences which may be studied
to advantage in connection, with the sci
entific collections in Washington' or with
the scientific work being carried on In the
Smithsonian Institution, the Coast and
Geodetic Survey, the Geological Survey,
the naval. observatory, etc. It is already
the seat of various colleges and it Is with
in â¢ one hour Â¦ of the American University
most famed : for advanced ' graduate re
search. In all such research the national
library is ready to aid.
As a Storehouse of Knowledge.
: It is a library not so much for popular
education as for serious research. It has
a duty to accumulate and â¢ preserve lrre
sptctive of the mere present use. It must
be content to see the major portion of its
books stand at any one time idle upon the
shelves. Its ambition is not so much to
secure a great number of readers, or. to
Issue a great number of volumes, as to
aid in investigations which may have im
portant consequences to the nation or to
scholarship.
As the library of Congress It is to aid
Congress and the various commissions es
tablished by Congress to make Investiga
tions or i to judicially Â¦ decide - important
questions. Its next duty is to the execu
tive Federal departments of Washington
and to the â¢ various scientific bureaus
maintained' by the Federal Government.
It is seeking an intimate relation of serv
ice with these bureaus. - Most of, them
have collections of books of their, own;
but their funds are small, and, as time
goes on, the collections cannot represent
more ' than the working tools which the
officials or scientists must have near their
desks. In course of time the Federal
libraries. of Washington will form one*or
ganic system with the library of Congress
as the center.
Its funds, however, are not and cannot
be .limitless. ,. It must apportion them." lit
order of relative importance It places first
material which will be practically useful
to 'Congress and to other -branches of the
Federal Government, and to the Inquirers
who 'form its immediate constituency of
readers; second, material relating. to the
United .- States and its component parts;
third> material relating to the "Western
hemisphere; fourth, material relating to
the history and the political and economic
conditions of other countries; and, lastly,
the literature of general knowledge.
Aids to the Nation's Scholarship.
Now the library of. Congress also seeks
to acquire and supply books to be imme
diately useful, but it does much more
than this. It is the national library of
the United States. It has a 'duty, there
fore, to accumulate and to preserve every
bit of material constituency of the li
brary, or to the present generation of
readers. Local libraries cannot acquire
everything. They have not the space,
they have not the funds. There should,
however, be one library > In the country
which should acquire everything obtain
able and appropriate in a library relating
to that country, whether written or print
ed. For years the library of Congress
has been accumulating on this principle.
Its funds for purchase were small, but it
was aided by the 1 copyright act. For since
1870 it has been made tUe depositary,
without cost, of two copies' of every book
and periodical and/ of most of the other
articles entered under the copyright law
of the United States, and for fourteen
years prior to 1870 it was the beneficiary
of one copy. The national libraries of
other countries Â¦ do not, however, limit
themselves to the literature which is
merely domestic with them. The British
Museum, for instance, recognizes the
whole world as its field. The national'li
brary of the United States, which is nec
essarily to be the foremost library In the
Western hemisphere, can do no less. . .
Libraries differ. The free town library,
the free city library on its popular aide,
and the subscription library collect . ma
terial which is required for immediate use
by the present constituency of readers.
They circulate this as widely and as rap
idly as possible. Their usefulness may to
a certain degree be estimated by the
number of books they circulate. Their
usefulness may In a sense be claimed to
be at a maximum Oen they can show
not a single book rtzcing on the shelves
and the books as a whole wearing out by
use faster than they can be replaced.
They are trying to reach all asces and
every class in the community. They are
supplying not merely the books which are
instructive but those which are purely
recreative. â¢ Particularly, however, they
are seeking to acquire the books which
are useful, .and their purpose is- immedi
ate ; practical use rather than mere pres
ervation.
. As to use also: -A library does not write
books, nor does it make them. It does not
engage in scientific research. It helps to
disseminate' knowledge, but only by accu
mulating, preserving and making availa
ble the sources of knowledge, not by mul
tiplying them. It informs as to what
knowledge exists, and what opinion. But
it is not a university. It" does not in
struct, and it has no opinions of its own
to promulgate or promote.

this, and Judge Lorlgan, after saying the
point was a novel one in this State, grant

before Justice Wallace, and this after
noon the court made an order for another
preliminary examination and directed the
District Attorney to file* a new informa

W. W. CAMPBELL, Director.
THE British tramp steamship Adato
sailed for Guayaquil, Ecuador,
yesterday with the first consign
ment of lumber and railroad ties
to be used In the completion of
the road between that seaport and Quito.
The contract calls for 13,000,00Qt ties in all,
and it will take the Adato eight trips to
land that number at Guayaquil. There
was some spirited bidding for the order
and at one time the Puget Sound lumber
dealers thought they had secured the
plum. They made a miscalculation, how
ever, and San Francisco secured the con
tract. T
The Ada*) took away yesterday 1,889,353
feet of lumber, 60,029 railroad ties and a
small quantity of merchand'se. The tramp
came here from the Sound and brought
down with her 678,974 feet of lumber and
the balance of 1,210,379 feet and the rail
read ties she took on here. The latter
were brought from Mendocino on steam
schooners and loaded on to the Adato in
the bay. The lumber was piled up aa high
as the tramp's poop deck and Â»ne looked
like a huge steam nchooner an Â»he passed
out through thÂ» headu. On thÂ« return trip
from Guayaquil the Adato will probably
bring nitrate to Ban Francisco.

forced to look for charters In other direc
tions, tfinrc January lnÂ«t find up to Inxt,
Thursday not a wind Jammer had nailed
from San JVanclHCO for the East with a
general cargo, but on the date named the
ship Ironuols broke the monotony. She
is now on her way to New York with' a
cargo valued at tenit of thousands. Among
it Is 4499 barrels of California wine, canned
goods, cedar logs, scrap Iron, wire rope
and 478 bale* of rags. The latter consign
ment when sold to the paper mills will
realize quite a neat sum, while the wire
rope and scrap iron will be sold as Junk.
The v.ine was shipped for the sake of
the voyage. The trip around the Horrf
will give it a racking that will add several
years to the age of the cargo, and that la
what the owners are after.
Lost a Man Overboard.
The schooner Queen, which arrived from
Port Gamble with a cargo of lumber a
few days ago, lost one of her crew over
board on the way down. When off the
coast of Mendocino a sailor named Olson
got on the deckload to take a reef In the
mainsail. He was dressed in oilskins and
had long rubber boots on. While at work
he made a false step and went overboard.
The man at the wheel at once put the
helm hard down and then threw the dog
house overboard. When the, schooner
came around the doghouse was there, but
Olson was gone. His boots must have
filled with water and sunk him like a
plummet. . â¢
Last of the Whaler Lydia.
The old whaler Lydia Is to be broken up.
Built in Rochester, Mass., away back in
1S40, she is known from Maine to Califor
nia, and there are few of the "old brig
ade 1 ' of whalemen who have not served on
her at one time or another. In her young
'days she was the pride of the New Bed
ford fleet and chased the sperm whale all
over the Southern Seas. In Australasian
waters she made some good catches and
many a thousand pounds of "bone" has
she brought home from the Arctic. On
this coast the Lydia was never a success
and many and many a time was she fitted
out by Wright, Bowne & Co. only to come
back "clean" after a year's absence. In
1S93 she made her last voyage for. that
firm." The next year she was not sent
north, but in 1895 a party of young men
sent her north, but all they gained was
experience. In 1S96 C. J. Hendry & Son,
the ship chandlers, fitted her out. but
they could not make her pay and she was
laid up in Oakland Creek and has been
there ever since. A couple of days ago
the old bark was sold to the Pacific Coast
Wrecking Company, so that after almost
sixty years of constant service the Lydia
has gone to the "bone yard" at last.
Water Front Notes.
The five-masted schooner W. H. Mars
ton, which was moved from Mission-street
wharf yesterday to make room for the
four-masted barkentine Lahaina, did con
siderable damace to the pier. Some Of
the piles were smashed and planking 1 torn
up while she was being moved. Both the
Marston and Lahaina are being rigged.
On her next trip from the Sound the big
tramp steamship Algca will go to Oakland
with coal for the Southern Pacific. After
that she may be returned to the Mail
Company and will carry merchandise to
the Orient. -
The ; collier Horda, which struck on an
uncharted rock in Oyster Harbor, has
gone on the Union Iron Works' drydock
for an inspection. It is not thought that
she is damaged to any great extent.

caused any to be set out. His men bad

of tho General Land Office in Washington
has during the past six months suspended
a Â». la Â£ l F e Â» UI ? be J Â£ horo^tead entries in
the Visalia land district on the request of
ppecial agents. The Commissioner is now
reversing this action, and to-day relieved
twenty-four of these homestead entrie*
from special suspension ard also from the
effects of prior suspensions of townships
In which the entries are situated. - This is
the result of a decision by the Secretary
of the Interior affirming the action of the
Visalia Land Office in rejecting contests
against such entries for failure to estab

time does not run against en trymen dur

The thrifty bootblacks have, invariably
advanced the fee for a shine "to 10 cents
whenever the State fair season or Legis
lature session has promised a chance for
a harvest, but the new union promises its
members that every day will soon be Sun
day, so far as . the shine tariff j is con
cerned.
It is the purpose of the union to make
the price of a shine, which is now a
nickel on week days and a dime on Sun
days, uniformly 10 cents' throughout the.
week. The announcement has given rise
to considerable alarm, and already, the
young bloods of the town are laying in
supplies to enable them to polish up their
footwear at home. ;
SACRAMENTO, . May 24.â The boot
blacks of the city have applied to Frank
Smith; organizer for the American Fed

the proper fee. Smith says that he will
at once obtain for the bootblacks their
charter.

The last Legislature enacted a law au
thorizing suits to be brought by the hold
ers of the- claims who had not received
payment, the intention being that the
judgments should be reported to the next
Legislature so that an appropriation
might be made to satisfy them. The suit
brought to-day represents the first of the
actions to recover under the new law.
Others will doubtless rapidly follow.
Further payments were checked by a
suit to define the scope of the act respect
ing payments. It was a long time before
the Supreme Court decided, it, and in 1895
the Legislature repealed the original
measure. Meanwhile additional claims
had accrued to the amount of $275,000.
SACRAMENTO, May Zi.â Suit was
brought In this county to-day by the San
Francisco Law and Collection Company
against the State of California for the
payment of assigned coyote scalp claims
aggregating $11,770. In 1891, owing- to the
ravages made by coyotes in stock raising
communities, the Legislature passed a law
granting a bounty of $5 on the scalp of
each coyote delivered. It was not long
before enough scalps were produced to
account for all the coyotes that ever
roamed the prairies. In less than a year
the State Controller cashed warrants for
scalps in the sum of $187,600.

SAXTA ANA, May 24.â Judge Ballard
of the Superior Court rendered a decision
to-day which knocks out the "social
clubs" recently organized at Fullerton
and Capistrano, presumably -with the
view of evading the new county liquor
ordinance. Judge Ballard in his decision
says:
There are decisions holding that bona-fide
nodal dubs are not required to take out a
license under such ordinances; but the rule
eeems to be well established that where evi
dence ehows that the so-called club was but a
pretense and fraudulent device to evade the
law it. will not avail as defense upon proof
of the violation of the law.

PETAX.TJMA. May 24.â The Sunset Tele
phone Company and the citizens of Peta
luma are at war. The company is trying
to put up heavy, unsightly telephone
poles along: the main street and the mer
chants have made vigorous protest. Some
weeks ago the Sunset Company started to
rewire- the city and sought permission
from the City Council to set poles along
the principal streets. There was a re
monstrance from a large number of citi
zens, but the opposition was withdrawn
when the company promised to put up
fine looking poles.
The work of setting the poles was com
menced to-<lay, and when the merchants
saw a few of them in place they made a
vigorous complaint to the Mayor, with
the result that all work is stopped and a
special meeting of the City Council Is
called to settle the trouble.

day because the officers of the transport
Rosecrans hauled down the transport's
flag and ran the British flag to the top
of the flagstaff in honor of Queen Victo
ria's birthday. The regulations provide
that the transDort's flag- shall fly under
all circumstances, but permit the flying
of a foreign flag underneath. The latter
course was pursued by the transport War
ren.
The peculiar action on board the Rose
crans is believed to have been due to
carelessness or lack of exact knowledge.
Captain Dobson and several other officers
â¢were formerly British mariners, becoming
naturalized when the Rosecrans was pur
chased by the Government two years ago.
Several citizens went aboard the trans
port and complained of lack of patriotism
shown in hauling down the American flag.
In consecuence of which the flag was re
stored to its proper position.

WOODLAND, May 24.â A large moun
tain lion was killed on Thursday on the
Henry Lewis farm, which is only seven
miles southeast of Capay. Lewis was in
the field alone loading some hay when he
saw a mountain lion croching upon the
limb of a tree. Lewis' only weapon at
hand was an ordinary pitchfork, so he
wisely decided to beat a retreat and ob
tain reinforcements and arms. Charles
Barr, a neighbor, returned with Lewis to
the hay field. In the meantime the wild
beast had not chang-ed its position. Barr's
aim was true and the first shot from his
rifle sent a bullet crashing through the
lion's head and the beast died almost
without a struggle. When weighed it
tipped the scales at nearly 200 pounds.
It has been generally known for some
time that there are a few mountain lions
in the mountains that form the western
boundary of Yolo, but their appearance
in the foothills and on the edge of the
valley Is so infrequent that this incident
caused unusual excitement. â¢

for three hours the house was thronged,
each student being loth to depart until he
or she had personally chatted with the
president. Â¦ It was . a time when words
meant the mostâ this last greeting to the
young people who are soon to turn their
backs upon college days and face the
world, many of them with nothing but
their diplomas and the -reputation of their
alma mater to back them. This was the
spirit of the reception, and every student
was in perfect accord with it.

recent bereavement the affair was' a quiet
one. Previous years have seen the lobby,;

EUREKA, May 24â Search covering a
period of twenty-two years has been
brought to a close in this county by- tho
discovery at Elk River, eight miles from
thi3 city, of the long missing daughter of
William R. McLaren, a prominent iron
manufacturer of 'Honolulu. When two
years of age the child was abducted at
Honolulu by John D. Coates, alias John
Duncan McDougal, who posed as a Pin
kerton detective. McDougal, claiming to
have been called to Seattle, left the
Islands, taking the infant and promising
to correspond with the father. Failing to
do this, a search was instituted.
Eleven years ago McDougal came to this
county. The girl, then fifteen years of age,
accompanied him. Two montns ago, hav
ing reason to believe that McDougal. was
not her father, and learning- that her rela
tives resided in Honolulu, the young wo
man made Inquiries through the Chief of
Police of Honolulu. McLaren was easily
found and he communicated with his
daughter, Mrs. Marion Hill, of San Jose.
Letters passed, and Mrs. Hill, becoming
satisfied that' the inquirer was her long
lost sister, came fo Eureka on the steamer
Pomona. She found her sister yesterday.
Since coming to this county McDougal
has been known by the name of John D.
Coates. His putative daughter, the girl
he abducted, is now the wife of Frank
Shaw, a farmer of the Elk River district.

Arthur McCloskey,;the young man who
was arrested on the. night .'of 'May 13 .'for
snatching a. satchel containing 5145 from
Mrs. Lena S. Kennedy of 229 Geary street,
was sentenced yesterday by 'Judge Mogan
to six months in 'the County Jail on the
charge, of petty larceny and. six months
for carrying a concealed weapon. The
original charge against McCloskey - was
grand larceny, but Mrs. Kennedy made
such a strong plea 'for mercy, owing . to
the fact that the defendant stated he was
driven to the crime by hunger, that the
minor charge was substituted. Mc-
Clo*key's ' real name is Arthur Deming,
and he belongs to Leadvllle, Colo. " -
McCloskey Is Sentenced.

when he went back Landecker said he

Efficiency of Fenders Discussed;
The Supervisors* Judiciary Committee
yeeterday took up the question of the effi
ciency of the fenders and brakes used by
various car companies. Chairman Bran
denstein explained that it was desired to
ascertain If the* device adopted two years
aeo is the most practical and the best ror
the purpose. Representatives from the
Union Street, Market Street, Sutter Street
and California Street Railway companies
were present, and each contended that his
fender was eafe. Sur>ervlsor Braunhart
favored the repeal of all former ordi
nances and the passage of a new bill In
consonance with the State law. The com
mittee decided to resume the investigation
next Friday, when it will consider the bill,
which provides that every dummy or car
shall have a suitable fender attached, be
tides a. brake capable of bringing such car
to a stop within a reasonable distance.

by Children.
Sixteen young people were confirmed by

gogue yesterday morning. The occasion
was the "Feast of Weeks," which was
celebrated in all the synagogues through
out the city. The sacred edifice was
crowded with the parents and friends of
tho children. Flowers were used' in pro
fusion and the interior of the synagogue
presented a beautiful appearance.
ThÂ© candidates for confirmation were a
credit to their teacher, Rabbi Isldor
Myers. They read from the Torah, or
sacred scroll, chanted prayers and deliv
ered addresses that were as Interesting
as they were surprising. An augmented
choir under the direction of Mrs. E. Ten
ney rendered several selections during the
services. ; The members of the choir were:
Mrs. J. *M- Jacobi, Misses Martha Bloch,
Blanche Cahen, Ray Delvalle, ,. Hilda

ser, Joseph Left", Florence Levy, Melville

In the closing address Rabbi Myers
spoke of "God's Army," and in part said
that the Israelites were organized Into a
great army by Mose* at the base of Mount
Sinai thousands of years ago, and that
they were sent into the world to fight
against Ignorance, superstition, oppres
sion. Idolatry and immorality. He said
that during the centuries this army has
been marching from country to country,
living, suffering and dying for the faith.
He urged the co-nflrmants to> rally around
the Jewish- flag, - on which was written
"The I<ord Is One," and to take the intelli
gent Jewish weapons of faith, knowledge,
purity and love and to live by their exam
ple as a protest against everything that
tends to degrade human beings.

ation was rendered by B. I. Barnett. ;

Appropriation for Clean ing Streets.*
Auditor- Wells has sent a communication
to the Board of Supervisors In which he
directs attention to the fact that the rec
ommendation of the Finance Committee
to set aside $196,900 for sweeping and
sprinkling streets Is too high by |20,000.
The Auditor suggests that the difference
should be used for public improvements.
The communication says:
"My attention has been called to the
fact that the Board of Public Works has
entered into new contracts for the \ per
formance of the work at figures much less
than the present contracts. whichÂ«will ob
viate the necessity of so large an appnH,
prlation for such purposes as that recom
mended by your honorable Finance Com
mittee, to wit, $196,900.. In estimating the
amount that will be necessary under the
new contracts I have based it on the num
ber of working days In the year and apply
ing the amount to the area over which
such work has been performed, and mak
ing a liberal allowance for the remainder
of the fiscal year, the amount necessary
will be about $176,000."

at the southwest corner of Eddy and

Several months ago a flre partially de
stroyed the house, and since that time
numbers of tramps have made it their
headquarters. The house Is close to Cal
vary Cemetery, find the tramps steal into
it late at night and make the night hide
ous with their revelries.- This is not the
worst, however, for the men are very par
tial to milk and bread. In the early hours
of the morning they raid the neighborhood
and steal all the milk and bread left on
doorsteps in the locality.
The residents complain that they have
reported the matter to the police, i but
that no effort has been made to abate- the
nuisance. The tramps are now getting so
bold that they saunter around in the
morning and ask the neighbors . to give
them hot coffee for ' breakfast.

The matter of the return of ball money
has assumed a phase that may lead to the
courts being called upon to decide the
problem as the proper method to be
adopted' in- future". â¢ Several wealthy Chi
nese who have thousands of dollars in the
hands of the City Treasurer deposited for
bail money came to the Hall of Justice
yesterday to make arrangements for the
commencement of mandamus proceedings
to compel the Treasurer to release the
money in His keeping.
Judge Mogan received a letter yesterday
from Supervisor Brandenstein, who intro
duced the ordinance, which was passed to
print, providing for the auditing of de
mands against bail money by the Auditor,
stating that Reuben Lloyd, attorney for
the Auditor, had advised the latter that
the ordinance was invalid/which is in di
rect opposition to the opinion of the City
and County Attorney.: The latter has just
returned from a trip Â¦ East, and he and
Attorney. Lloyd will meet In a day or two
to discuss the matter. Brandenstein
thought some action would be taken at
the meeting of the Board of Supervisors
on Monday. : .-

The Board of Public Works, yesterday
sent out a force of inspectors, who caused
all the big corporations except one to stop
trench work on the public streets. This Â¦
action was taken because the companies
have refused to comply with the ordi
nance passed by the Board of Supervisors
April 29. last, which prohibits the breaking
up, digging up', disturbing, undermining
or digging under any public street, lane, i
alley, place or court m any manner or ror ;
any purpose without a permit from the i
Board ot Public Works arid the deposit of
fees for the inspection and supervision of >
the work.
The only company whose workmen were
not disturbed was- the Pacific Gas Im
provement Company, which has agreed to
abide by the provisions of the ordinance.
The board on May 21 addressed a com
munication to that corporation, also to
the Equitable Gaslight Company, the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company, In
dependent Electric L.ight and Power Com
pany, Mutual Electric Light Company and
Martel Power-house, acquainting them
Â¦with the provisions of the ordinance and
stating that the board would adopt such
measures as would enforce compliance
with the law. The Pacific Gas Improve
ment Company replied to the communica
tion as follows: .
. We desire to know if It will be necesiary for
us to get a new permit for every service run
or whether we can receive a general permit
from the Board of Works and continue to
notify you whenever we expect to- lay a main
or run a service, f also whether we can make a
general deposit in advance for fees.
In answer to this letter the board stated
that the deposit of a general fee monthly
would be allowed and the difference would
be returned at the end of each month
should the deposit be excessive. The board
also decided to issue a general permit for
trenching work.
The corporations which have not com
plied with the ordinance claim that the
measure is unconstitutional and it is un
derstood they will test it in the courts..
The beard proposes to arrest any one vio
lating the ordmftnee and thus the matter
will be brought to an issue. In the mean
time householders will be deprived of
service pipes from the water company and
some gas companies until the disputed
point Is settled.

But It Was a Hard Pull. " J \Z,
It is hard to believe that coffee will put
a person in such a condition as It did
Mrs. E. 8. Brown, of Apple Creek, O. She
tells her own story.
"I did not believe coffee caused my
trouble, and frequently eald I liked it so
well I would not, nor could not quit
drinking it, even If It took my life, but I
was a miserable sufferer from heart
trouble and nervous prostration for four
years. I was scarcely able to. bo around
at all. Had no energy and did not care
for anything. Was emaciated and had a
constant pain around my heart until I
thought I could not endure it . For
months I never went to bed expecting to
g-et up in the morning. I felt as though
I was liable to die any time during the
night.
"Frequently I had nervous chills and
the least excitement would drive sleep
away, and any little noise would Upset
me terribly. I was gradually retting
worse until finally one time It came over
me and I asked myself what is the use
of being sick all the time, and buying
medicine so that I could indulge myself
In coffee? â¢
"So I thought I would, see- if I could
quit drinking coffee and grot some Postum
Food Coffee to help me quit. I made it
strictly according to directions and I
want to tell you that change was the
greatesL step in my life. It was easy to
quit coffee because I had the Postum
which I like better than I like the old
coffee. One by one the old troubles left,
until now I am in splendid health, nerves
steady, heart all right and the pain all
gone. Never have any more nervous
chills, don't take any medicine, can do all
my housework and have done a great
deal beside.
My Elster-in-law, who visited me this
summer, had been an invalid f or some
time much' as I was. I got her to 'quit
coffee and drink Postum. Bhe gained. flve
pounds In three weeks, and \I; never, saw.
such a change In anyone's health. Any-
one by writing me can receive verification
of these statements."

tion of Robert E. Glaze for a' new trial

'After denying the motion for a new trial
Judge Dunne ordered Glaze to 'â¢ stand up
end asked him ii there was any legal rea-
son why 1 sentence should not be passed
upon him.
'- "Nothing, your Honor," answered Glaze,
"except that I am sure I am not guilty
of this charge against me."' ;
"It is the sentence of this court, said
Judge Dunne, "that you be confined in the
State Prison at San Quentin 1 for the term
of your natural life." ' : ' * â¢ ' â¢ .
Glaze again took his seat beside his wife
and stepchildren without giving any evi-
dence fit emotion. His attorneys â¢â¢; then
moved for a stay of execution for twenty
days, which was granted. .
G'aze and Trewhella were partners in
the Windsor Hotel.:. They quarreled over
money matters. Glaze finally lay in wait
for his partner in the kitchen of the hotel
and shot him ' down in cold Â¦ blood. Â¦ He
pleaded self-defense, but the evidence ad-
duced-at-the trial disproved his plea and

JULY REGATTA
FOR OARSMEN
Â¦
The work on the proposed rowing regat
ta to be held on Lake Merritt on Indepen
dence day is progressing. The committee
appointed by the Alameda Boating Club
went on Tuesday evening to the Mer
chants' Exchange committee of Oakland
for a conference. The oarsmen were re
ceived, very well and the statement of
their case evoked a favorable expression
of opinion. The Merchants' Exchange
committee seemed well pleased with the
idea of holding an aquatic carnival and
arranged to meet the oarsmen again last
night. One of the Oakland committee, a
Yale graduate and oarsman, is stroncly
In favor of the regatta and the Alameda
and Oakland 'press has taken up the idea.
Last night the oarsmen stated more- in
detail the events they are prepared to take
part -in and . if the necessary funds can
be obtained the aauatic carnival on Lake
Merritt will certainly take place.
The Ariel Rowing Club held a meeting
5 J u v eday night at which it was decid
ed to begin work on the foundation of the
newboathouse to-morrow. Wooden ccscs
five feet square at the bttom and taut-r
ing toward the top will be built and filled
with concrete. Twenty-one of these will
be required. For the present the work
will be done by the members, but Itaer
men will be hired if It is found necessary
to do so. It is hoped that the house may
be ready for occupation In -.about two
months.

ANNUAL EVENT
FOR RACKET
WI ELDERS.
Dates for Championship
Tournaments Changed
and New State Event
Is Added to the List
At a meeting of the Pacific States Lawn
Tennis Association held last Monday night
the order of championship events was
changed considerably. It was decided that
instead of the singles tournament for the
championship of the coast being played
on July 4, as it has heretofore been done,
it will be piayed the early ; part of Sap
tember, just previous to the doubles
championship tournament. On the Fourth
of July In place of the coast champion
ship there- will be a tournament for the
championship of . the State.'. In nearly all
the Eastern States there is a State cham
pionship tournament, and the action taken
the other evening establishing a like
tournament in this , State is considered a
very good move by all the cracks. All
three tournaments will be played on the
courts of the Hotel Rafael, and at present
it looks as if there would be nothing much
in the way of tennis at Del Monte this
year. ,.,.:....
The latter place is hardly suited for a
championship event; as the light is very
bad and the overhanging foliage inter
feres with the play to a great extent.. By
changing the date of the singles to Sep
tember the midsummer heat of San Ra
fael will Â¦ be avoided. This intense heat
has always made it difficult to play a
five-set 'match. - '-
The singles championship of -the coast
is the most important event of the year,
and many consider it a bad move to put
it over until September, when the-sum
mer season is practically over. On the
other hand, by doing this the best players
from Southern California and the cracks
from the north will be on hand to compete
in both singles and doubles. These men
will not come for one event, hence both
events will be played at the same time.
Such men as Goward, Foulkes and Free
man of Oregon and Washington, and Bell,
Sinsabaugh and Hendricks of Southern
California will probably be on hand when
play is called.
This morning on the courts of the Cali
fornia Tennis Club the finals of the
academic singles tournament will be
played. In this match Norman Hodgkin
son of Lowell High School will be pitted
against Roy Taylor of Oakland High
School. Hodgkinson is by long odds the
better player of the two, but Taylor has
been doing cortlderable practicing of late
and followers of the game expect he will
give his clever opponent quite an argu
ment.
The California Tennis Club will hold a
class singles tournament on Decoration
day. This tournament is one of the most
important "ones given by the local club
each year. Those who surely will take
part are Robert and George Whitney,
Sumner Hardy, W. B. Collier, Harold
Crowell. Merle Johnson, N. Hodgkinson,
Grant Smith. Dr. Lane, Ray Cornell. Chet
Smith, Sidney Salisbury, Du Val Moore,
Drummond McGavin and many , of the
lower class men, who will probably enter
at the last moment. ' . â¢
The tennis courts built In the park for!
the use of tho general public are fast
nearing completion, and in a- few months
there will be enough courts to accommo
date all. The courtsare macadam and are
already down and well packed, making it
necessary only to mark off the lines and
build backstops.
BOXING CLUBS
AND THEIR
MATCHES.
Fistic Programmes for
the Next Few flonths
Are Arranged, but Not
Yet Definitely Settled
On next Wednesday evening before the
National Athletic Club Terry -McGovern
will make his second public ring appear
ance in this city. This time he will meet
Aurelia Herrera, the Bakersfield feather
weight, of whom so much has been writ
ten and said by the native - enthusiasts of
the San Joaquln oil city. In every fight
that Is a fight there are always two
parties, and as Herrera is a strong, well
muscled youth, a surprise of some sort
may be in store for McGovern. .
Sam Harris, McGovern's astute man
ager, thinks that the Bakersileld terror
will be easy game for the Brooklyn whirl
wind and blandly talks of the $59O0-$350O
eide bet which will soon be annexed to
the licGovern-Harris fund. Hcrrera has
a manager in Carrilo who is playing the
argel with a new set of wings, if all that
is said of him Is true. Every day the word
is passed that Carrilo has made another
big bet on his protege at odds ranging
lrom 2 to 1 to 10 to 6.
Herrera is being trained by Tim Mc-
Grath at San Jose and is in good shape.
He la a bard worker, seems to be in
earnest and talks mightily about his con
fidence to whip McGovern.. Terry is also
training assiduously. His daily exercise
consists of road running in tbe park in the
morning and gymnasium work in the af t
eirjoon at the Olympic Club, where he
makes the most of the cold salt water
plunge. He is ruddy, strong and just as
r:ist as ever he was. When the- time
comes for the fight McGovern will be in
proper shape and ready to meet Herrera
of Bakersneld.

The Twentieth Century Athletic Club
has the permit for June, and indications
po!nt to another McGovern fight during
that month. Tim Heggarty is the man,

lie is en route to San Francisco. Depend

As the Olympic Club tournament round
ed out last Thursday evening one T>oxer
oamO to the front who is likely to develop
into a more than ordinary fighter, He is
William Snailham. the protege of Alec
Grtpgains. Snailham is the talk of the
I'j-ttzi. He Is in the bantam class, fights
like a furious wind blows- and stops at
nothing. While not a clever boxer, he is
r very strong fighter, has confidence in
himself and seemingly likes the feel of a
punch. Snailham won the championship
of his class by getting the decision from
Joseph Haggerty, who fought the last
round with a broken collarbone, the re
sult of a fall in the preceding round.

nwi'^'^ between Younar America and

of the Young America team hoped, by
keeping it doubtful till a day or two be
fore the game, to catch Old England with
a weakened team and. when on Friday
their willingness to play was announced,
several of the representatives of Old Eng

BIG REGATTAS
ARE ON THE
SCHEDULE.
Decoration Day Events
for the Corinthians
and Calif ornians on
San Francisco f Bay
Thi3 evening:' the San Francisco Yacht
Club will give a dance in Its clubhouse at
Sausalito, beginning at 8 o'clock. Ferry
boats for 'Sausalito leave the city at 5:13.
6:15 and 6:45 p. m., returning from. Sausa
lito at 10:55 p. m. To-morrow is an open
day. on the schedule, and, as the tide
serves -well, running out till a little after
13 noon at Fort Point, and flooding all the
afternoon, most 'of the yachtsmen will
cruise out toward the heads.
H. R. Slnjpklns' yawl Tramon.ta.na sailed
down to the Union Iron "Works last Satur
day to witness the launching' of the battle
ship Ohio, and afterward cruised up to
Vallejo, where she anchored for the night,
returning next day with light breeze3 to
her moorings at Sausalito, which she
made about 5:30 p. m. She was to have
started on a trip to southern waters this
week, but is not yet ready for an ocean
cruise. To-morrow members of the club
who do not own yachts will be taken out
for a cruise in the channel.
. The . directors of the San Francisco
Yacht Club held a meeting on. "Wednesday
night, at which nine new members were
elected. The time within which to put in
bids for building the challenger for the
Perpetual Cup trora Crowntnahield's de
signs Is not yet up, and the bids are still"
unopened. The sails will be made in the
East, and it is said that the craft will be
ready to receive them In sixty days from
the date of the order being given to build
her. The plans "furnished by the Boston
designer are very detailed, showing where
every bolt and nail is to be placed. . It 13
thought that it may be better to employ
a small-boat builder than a shipbuilder,
as the workmen of the latter are not ac
customed to the fine, light work and .ma
terial necessary on a racing yacht.
The San Francisco Yacht Club fleet will
be increased by the addition of a big sloop,
the largest on the bay, having a length,
over all of sixty-seven feet, a beam of
twenty- two feet and a draft of six feet
six inches. She Is built for outside sailing,
having a flush deck. with, sunken sky
lights and a "fifteen-inch rail. She carries
eleven tons of lead on her keel and more
will probably be added. Her name Is Jilt.'
She was built at BenicMj. and is owned by
F. J. Croall. She has a fine cabin, state
rooms, lavatories, a bathroom, a sail-room
and Quarters for the crew. The owner
proposes to have a crew of a dozen mem
bers of the San Francisco Yacht Club for
cruising and a crew of twenty for racing.
The regatta committee of the Corinthian
Tacht Club, P. J. Martenstein, E. B.

to the trustee of the fund here that he ac
cepts the suggestions made by the Pacific
Inter-Club Yacht Association and will
write more fully. The directors of the

CAPTAIN HACKETT'S highly
prized chestnut horse Yellowtail
did himself proud at Oakland yes
terday. The big f un picked up 120
pounds in the mile handicap, and
judiciously ridden by Ruiz made his
neld look like a lot of scapegoats. And
behind him trailed Â«uch shifty perform
ers as Beau Ormonde, The Fretter and
Kcsormonde. In the betting his eeverul
disappointing races in the past caused
me price to recede from 6 to 5 to 2Vi to 1.
Cut oft at the lirst turn, Ruiz took mat
ie -s quietly to the stretch, tnen passing
Beau Ormonde won whistling in 1:40^.
i-'nving hara The Fretter lost the place
io Beau Ormonde by less than a length,
tarrying top weight, 1^2 pounds. Rosor
mor.de, the actual favorite at post time,
n-nished back in the ruck after showing
same early speed.
The fields were large and unwieldy,
abounding with bad actors and actresses.
Two favorites only were able to keep
above the surface, while McAlbert fur
nished the surprise by scoring at odds of
Bd to 1 in thg closing sketch.
With Parader out of the way, Rey
I>are, at short odds, made quick work of
his Held in the first number at a mile
and seventy yards. The lop-eared brown
colt made all the running and was not
hi'rd pressed lo beat Quibo and Harry
Thatcher.
Thirteen maiden two-year-olds then
lined up at four furlongs. J. Naglee
Burk's Lento was made- favorite on

stretch, got an early decision. Alexander
landed fat. Sever second two lengths
ahead of Marello.
it was common gossip about the ring
that True Blue had been showing unmis
takable signs of lameness in bis work

E. G. Rodolph, who was one of the com
mittee on racing, vehemently denounced
the manner, in which the privileges were
let yesterday. . Mr. Rodolph; said some
body had profited handsomely by the
transaction. Ho was particularly- out
spoken about the surreptitious course
pursued by Chairman McMenomy ami hla
haste to give the privileges . to Young
without the full committee's concurrence..
"I was prepared to bid as high uk $2500
for the. betting. ring,'-' saidÂ»Harry -CorbÂ«tt
yesterday. "Sam Hammond presented my
offer and was Informed, that McMenomy
had turned all privileges over- to Young.
I was jobbed, and that is all. there is
tO-it." â¢ ;Â¦â¢ â¢â¢ ' Â¦ â¢â¢Â¦ â¢ ' : :'- ' 'Â»-..:
,.' George Rose last night confirmed the
report that he offered Secretary Gilbert
$2000 and a guarantee of $10,000 as an cvl
donce of good faith. . ;; â¢ Â¦ * ,
"There was something wrong In .the
manner the deal was engineered." said
Rose, "Young rounded up/ the right peo
ple, according to Gilbert; and nobody else
had a chance. I tried to give Young the
amount he paid for tho ring: and take 50
per cent of his bargain. .There was noth
ing doing.'' â¢ '
It Is said the matter will be brought to
thf attention of the full board at. its next
meeting, and Â¦ meanwhile McMenomy is
having his own , troubles. H^^8^^mjÂ»
On butchers' daw Caesar Young- "skin
ned the lamb" at Oakland. According to
his own statement,, he^clearod $S000. : The
Brices laid' in his six Mokson the various
events would have astonished the shell
workers on Guttenberg Hill. ;
Young's Big Profits.
J. La Coste. Chairman McMenomy pre
sented Young's offer of $1000, and stated
it -was $200 more than the price paid last
year. He neglected to point out, however,
that formerly the racing season had been
over for weeks when the butchers had
their holiday, and therefore the conces
sionaires did not have a chance to book
on running races. This year the Califor
nia Jockey Club practically surrendered
one of its racing dates to the butchers,
which action enhanced the , value- of the
concessions threefold. On ' McMenomy 's
recommendation Young's bid was immedi
ately accepted. . .
Three weeks ago Harry Corbett began
to scout for the privileges and sent to
Sam Hammond, one of the committee, an,
offer of $2000 for them. About the same
time George Rose offered- J. M.. Gilbert,
secretary of the Butchers' Board, <2000,
and wanted to post $10,000 in cash to .bind
the contract. Â« Gilbert naively informed
him that the privileges had been awarded
to Young, and, furthermore, he couldn't
have, got, them anyway. Â¦ Rose subsequent
ly offered Young a handsome bonus for
50 per cent of his bargain, but it was,de
clined. â¢ ' Â¦ .
Sciences Hall last night before California
Association No. 3 on "The Man and the
Engine." In an interesting manner he
demonstrated that the engine takes on
the characteristics of the man that has
charge of it, and that the man takes on
the characteristics of the, engine. JHe
showed that if the engine is of low pres
sure and does its work in an easy, quiet
manner the engineer will be found to be
of a quiet, easy-going manner, while It it
is a high pressure one the engineer will
be ' found to be a high-pressure Â¦ man.
whose - advanced ideas would be out of
place alongside of an old-time engine.
Then; again, he said that there is a class
of engines that -require a man at the
throttle all the time to cave them from
going to wreck and there Is a class of
men who have to have some one at their
throttle all tho time, and oftentimes it is
the wives who lake that position and save
the men. In closing he said that^an in
telligent engineer who Is In charge of an
intelligent engine must always be three
or four revolutions ahead of hla engine or
he will find .that instead of controlling it
it will control and make a slave of him.

Scarcely had the excitement attendant
upon the steer race subsided Wednesday
when the complaints of the butchers be
gan to go the rounds -and create strife in
the Inner circles of their Boardiof Trade.
One Indignant knight of the chopping
block asserts that Young stolo a march by
delivering divers meat contracts to the
chairman of the committee,, who In turn
delivered the profitable grama of laying
against everything from a 'potato to a
steer race, to say nothing of five regular
races between thoroughbreds, a . conces
sion never before enjoyed by the pencllers
who have controlled the ring on butchers'
day In previous years.
Young Had Influence,
It Is certain Young had great Influence In
the weights when ho lanaod the prize, for
others of his fraternity were laying awake
nights waiting for a chance to pay twice
the sum Â¦ he surrendered for the Â¦ betting
ring privileges. Â¦Â¦â¢ There were nine members
on tho racing committee besides Chairman
McMenomy. Several weeks ago, it la al
leged, a hurried call was sent out for a
meeting, at which It was proposed to dis
pose of the betting; concessions; Several
of the men on the committee declare-they
got no notice of the â¢ meeting. The ., only
members who responded were J. -H. Â¦ Mc-
Menomy; E.'- J. Taaffe, -H.\,Westphal'; and
A rare scandal is brewing in .the Butch
ers' Board of Trade over the action of the
committee in charg^ of the racing at Oak
land on butchers' day in allotting the bet
ting privileges to;. Bookmaker Caesar
Young. for a sum just one-half of that of
fered by both Harry Corbett and George
Rose. .
The wrath of several of the most influ
ential members the board is leveled at
the head of John H. McMcnomy, chairman
of the committee, who is said to have dis
pensed with the formality of asking for
competitive bids and assumed the respon
sibility of doling out the various privi
leges at his own. sweet will. Several, of
the indignant butchers declare the
board lost a handsome sum by this pro
cedure, and others go farther. and openly
charge collusion, especially in the disposal
of the betting rights.

tion will open at Ineleside. It will last
two days, and judging by the number of

tion. The best trap shots of tl^Stato
are entered and the contests-bid fair to be
very close and' exciting. 4 . .
Nearly a score of country, members ar
rived in town yesterday and went imme
diately to Ingleside for practice. Judging
by the averages they made they will give
their city brothers a close run for the
money prizes.
The grounds at Ingleside have been
thoroughly equipped to accommodate the
attendance of local shooters and those vis
iting from interior points. The association
will have entire charge of the grounds
during the shoot and all Profits derived
from the trapping of birds will go into the
association treasury. -- â¢

NEW YORK, May 24.â Bradstreet's ,to-mor
row will say: .... .. ,
The general situation. Is still largely a favor
able one, the' primary encouraging feature being
the fine outlook for the country's crops. General
distribution, retarded hitherto by the backward
spring, has been stimulated by warm, sunny
weather. Industrial conditions head the list of.
disturbing features, but confidence in conserva
tism and good counsel is* widespread, and the
effect on general business exerted by the largest
number of men idle for several years past has
been apparently minimized. ".
Â¦ Reports as to quiet trade in iron . and , steel
come from the- East, where demand for pic iron
is of a hand-to-mouth character. : No special
activity is looked for, however, In this branch,
because large consumers are well supplied. : In
deed, Pi ttsburs furnaces are booked weir into
July. The demand for finished goods is as
heavy as ever, structural materials, bars and
plates , being, in especially good ' demand, with
premiums paid for quick delivery and a large
new business not accepted because of inability
of manufacturers ' to promise quick shipment.
The only -accumulation in pig iron' Is the lower
grades, and this is especially notable as regards
the Southern product. , Good reports come from
the Western hardware trade, the demand in
building and for barbed wire fencing being es
pecially active.'- Â¦? .' . .".-: . .
'The boot and shoe and allied trades note con
siderable activity in manufacturing lines. East-"
em shoe shipments have , again, exceeded the
1C0, 000 cases mark, and the total for, the season
is now nearly 50.000 cases ahead of last year. . â¢
Leather finds ready purchasers among manu
facturers East and West, and stocks do not ac
cumulate. Sole leather prices are at full quota
tions, I which show a I substantial advance over
some time ago, while uyperr leather . is flrm.
Hides â¢ are steady, at . the j West,': but easier - in

Â¦ Such unanimity- as to ! good . crop reports has
rarely been seen at this period of ; the year.

Nczv York Stock Market.
N'EW YORK, May 24.â A final spurt of ac
tivity and utrength in the stock market was
all that saved the day from being the dullest
in the amount of business done since the No
vember election. As it was business was well
Ocvn totvard the minimum and was besides
largely congested in a few stocks. The
tMhacco stocks. American and Continental,
wÂ«Â«re the feature of the market. The volume
of bufineps in them grew as the movement
prcgreEivd and all the room traders, hungry
for a stock that would move easily, tailed on
to the movement. By bidding up prices
tm&rtly they ascertained that very few selling
orders for the stock were in the market above
the prevailing price level. These technical
conditions were responsible for the movement
â¢ â¢f stocks so far as any news that was pub-
Ifphfd would indicate. Something is made of
the fact that the new tobacco company which
is being organized has representatives in it
r.-ho organized an opposition company once be
for*. -which was absorbed in a short time by
the American Company. The day's gain reg-'
t*tered for American Tobacco was eight points
*nd for Continental Tobacco 4%. The final
ftrength of the market was due to this move
ment and to the late accentuation of strength
in other stocks which hau shown signs of firm
t>.(?-s and strength earlier In the day. The
weak points were-, also pulled up, ,sd that the
losses, which were at one time very general.
wÂ«?re either wiped out or greatly reduced all
around. The Eries, the Wabash. Missouri Pa
cific and Atchison were good points of resist
ance all day. The story persisted that efforts
wre making to secure a trunk line outlet for
the Gould Southwestern railroads and Wabash;
that the great trunk line proprietors had pro
tested against this project and that it had been
threatened that Atchison would be absorbed
by the Pennsylvania in retaliation. This story
and its variations* will bÂ« found closely re
lated to whatever strength was shown in the
day's market. The movement of Union Pa
cific was a notable Influence on the whole
mtrket, its break to 99 being the principal
factor In the early weakness of the market
*nd its rally at the close largely relieving the
depression. > The forecast of a. strong bank
Ftatement and the fact that , no further gold
was engaged for export were strengthening
factors. The cessation of the urgent demand
for Northern Pacific also relieved apprehen
sion. The result was an active and flrm close
in the market after a day of feeble and desul
tory fluctuation?.
The bond market was Irregular and only
moderately active. Total sales, par value,

NEW YORK, May 24.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will cay: '
Liquidation has apparently run Us course
and the stock market Is Inclined to be dull.
The shrinkage of the transactions at the New
York Stock- Exchange to below 1,000,000 shares
each day demonstrates clearly that the public
has not only been shakf-n out of speculation,
but Is not inclined to come in again at the
present. This is borne out by a general com
plaint on the part of Wall street interests that
commission business has been reduced to a
fraction of what It was before the. Northern
Pacific corner. In fact these developments
have altogether changed . the complexion of
the stock market, rendering it one In which
professional influences are uppermost, because
the present movements which occurred , seemed
to be almoet entirely the work of manipula
tors and the board room traders, who supplied
a very large share of the activity. . Prices were
irregular, and though a good deal of steadiness
was shown the sensitive feeling which I still
prevails made itself apparent in the readiness
with which the list yielded whenever there
v;as any symptom of further selling of long
stock. The most important incident of the
week was the further pressure which developed
at London in connection with short contracts
In Northern Pacific. The bears' there cannot
obtain the stock at any price, and while Mor
gan & Co. seem willing to- make settlements
on. a money basis with those who have con
tracts with them, there are many outside spec
ulative buyers of Northern Pacific who stand
out for their full rights. The London Stock
Exchange committee has met this situation by
a further suspension of the right . to buy In
the stock, which will postpone any forced set
tlement until about June 10. At the same time
the situation In London In this regard is an
unpleasant one and seams to present some ele
ment of danger. That thl3 is appreciated was
shown on Thursday whtn. some scattered for
eign buying orders put Northern Pacific up to
200 and caused a decided chill in. the general
market, ' prices selling oif all around the room.
The general conclusion, however, seems to be
that the London Stock Exchange authorities
will avert any serious disturbance- and real
trouble need ' not be apprehended.
CHICAGO, May 24.â Liverpool cables were
lower but no. more so than was expected, yet
under reports of copious rains In localities
where they were most needed, the market was
nervous when the session began and July
wheat opened unchanged to a shade lower at
73@78 I /4c Â¦ Tho , crowd was Â¦ mixed, and
for some little time there was no trading.
Then pit traders began work with a view to
quick sales and small profits and under these
campaigns tho price declined to 72%c. At this
point the bull leader In corn and other exten
sive operators began buying, and' a' reaction
to 73c followed. The close was steady, %@Uc
lower at 72%@73c. . .
. The corn market was moderately active, but
had a, weak undertone. Large receipts and
high grading were the depressing factors.
July closed fairly steady, %c lower at 43%c
May corn was neglected and closed %c lower
at 42%c. ' .-> *â¢ ' '
The market for oats was considerably weak
er, principally on extensive selling, by the
large long interests." July closed %@'/4c lower
' at 28Uc. v Â¦ : Â¦ Â¦ .'
Provisions were firm In sympathy with high
er prices for hogs, but were dull, and in the
absence of speculation the market eased off
as the season advanced. July pork closed 5c
lower and lard and ribs 2%c lower.

The Stock Exchange presented a deserted ap

In keeping with the attendance.. In fact,
things were \ decidedly dull. In the early trad-
Ing Americans were inclined 'to -be sloppy on
the clearing up process before tne. holidays.
In the afternoon there Â¦ was . a miM spurt on
the buying of Eries by the arbitrageurs. Tl.o
rally, however, was short-lived, anJ t.ie close
was heavy. Anacondas spurted to 10 with
free option dealing at 9-16 for calls at the end

Judge Seawell sustained a demurrer yes
terday to the , complaint filed by , Mrs,
Theresa Bell, as administratrix of the es
tate of the late Thomas Bell,' to set aside
an assessment levied on stock- in the
Standard Quicksilver Company, which be
came delinquent and resulted in the loss"
of the stock to the estate. Judge Seawell
held that an action to quiet title to per
sonal property would ' < not lie, but he
pointed out that if Mrs. Bell was refused
the right to vote at a stockholders' meet
ing for the election of directors she oould
contest the election, or if a dividend
should be declared sho could ' sue to re
cover the same, which suit would estab
lish the. ownership of the s^ock. '.

Florence Roberts, the versatile actress,
who has long been a favorite with local
playgoers. Is to open- a sixteen-weeKs
season at the Alcazar Theater, beginning
June 3. This will be welcome news to
the theater-goers of this city and vicinity.
Tney will have an 'opportunity to see the
clever actress In a number of new pro
ductions and in some of the plays that
she produced in past seasons and which
have added to her fame.
Miss Roberts will be supported by such
well-known actors as White Whittlesey,
Barton Hill and Lucius â¢ Henderson. She
will produce a number of plays that have
never been seen on this coast. Among
them will be "For Bonnie Prince Char
lie," "Countess Valeska" and two new
plays by Miss Charlotte Thompson. The
first two plays have been produced in the
East by Julia Marlowe. Miss Roberts has
secured the exclusive rights to them. Her
repertoire will contain such popular plays
as "Peg Wofflngton," "The School for
Scandal," "The Taming of the Shrew"
and a revival of "Sapho," ' ' "Camille,"
"Romeo and Juliette" and "The Country
Girl."
Miss Roberts Is highly pleased with
"For Bonnie Prince Charlie." She says
it is one of the prettiest and best plays
ehe has ever read and she believes it
will be greatly enjoyed Â¦ by the Alcazar
patrons. In it she plays the part of a
beggar girl and must of necessity be at
tired in rags. This will be somewhat dis
appointing to her feminine admirers, who
critically survey her gowns, as Miss Rob
erts is said to be one of the best dressed
women on the stage. Whittlesey will
hide his handsome countenance behind
bushy whiskers and his form will also be
clad In rags, as he Â¦will play the part of
a blind man 80 years old. Henderson will
be "Bonnie Prince Charlie" and a bonnie
figure he will make. ' , .
The argument of the play centers- upon
ths disastrous attempt of Charles -Ed
ward, the "Young Pretender," to estab
i lish himself upon the throne. The hand
some young fellow lands in Scotland and
appears to the retainers of Clanmorris,
who. rally to his support. The play is
from the pen of J. I. Clark, the noted
playwright and. Is full of dramatic situa
tions and beautiful lines. It is expected
to surpass anything of its kind ever put
on at the Alcazar. It Is -a Scottish play
and the atmosphere of the land* of. the
heather, is sustained throughout. Special
music has been written for the produc
tion, the rehearsals of which began yes
terday. . ,
"Countess Valeska' V Is Â» also Â¦Â¦ a strong
play* and has been well received ; in the
East. In this and other productions Miss
Roberts will wear some beautiful cos
tumes that- have been : specially made for
her by Herman of New- York. Barton
Hill, a survivor of the old - California
Theater Stock Company, will plav, Trlp
lett In the production of "Ppg Wofflng
ton." He has won fame In this part and
will be a good foil to Miss Roberts' Peg.
The Â¦ two new plays by Miss Charlotte
Thompson are said to be excellent. They
ant up-to-date â¢ comedy dramas and the
California â¢' playwright- -has shown gres.t
skill in the writing of them. - A; peculiar
feature of the plays - Is , that ; one., is a'
sequel to the other. One, Is entitled "Sil
ver â¢ Mounted Harness," and Â» the .play
that: takes un ; the -thread- of the story
Is called "Miss Pendragon." ', . ,

CLEVER ACTRESS

ALAMEDA. May 24.â Miss Charlotte
Zimmerman of 2933 Lincoln ave
nue has met with such marked
tuccesi in several amateur op
eras and farces in which she has
appeared before the Alameda -public that
fehe contemplates making her professional
debut on the comic opera stage.
MIbs Zimmerman is a natural entertain
er, chic and witty, and possesses original
mannerisms which have mado her a fa
vorite-with audiences. Besides her talents
as an actress Mies Zimmerman sings well,
her voice being a high noprano. She has
many friends *n local eoclety, who predict
for her a successful career in her chosen
profession. Sh-Â» probably will pursue her
studies for the stage in the Cast.
In the recent entertainment given by
Alameda Tong No. 1 of the Alameda
White Highbinders Miss Zimmerman took"
a leading part. She was so disguised in
Chinese costume that some of her most,
intimate friends failed to recognize her.
It took two real Chinese women a whole,
afternoon to "do" her hair up in the Ori
ental fashion. The young lady made a
decided hit. She sang several songs from
"The Geisha," including "Chon Chon Chi
naman" and "The Jewel of Asia.'-!
Miss Zimmerman resides, with her moth^
er and is a California girl.
CORPORAL DAVES
AGAIN ON DUTY
Provost Sergeant at the
Presidio Acquitted
of Charges.
Corpcra.1 "Tu?" Davis is once again per
forming the duties of provost sergeant at
the Presidio. He was restored to duty yes
terday at noon, the findings of the court
martial which tried him. on a charge of
corruption having been approved by Gen
eral Shatter.
Corporal Davis was accused some time
ago of accepting bribes from merchants
doing business near the Presidio gates to
allow them to enter the reservation to
collect moneys cue them from soldiers for
civilian outfits. The character of the wit
nesses who .testified for the prosecution
â¢was attacked, with the result that the
board of officers appointed to receive the
testimony returned a verdict of not guilty.
The prosecution of the charges rested
with Lieutenant Lloyd England. Davis
wae defended by Lieutenant Boyd.-
The books of the merchants were sub
mitted as evidence against Davis, but no
record of the payment of any moneys to
the corporal could be found on their
pages. The aim of the defense was to
prove that the charges of the merchants
were due to a desire to secure tho re
moval of Davis from the arduous duty of
provost sergeant It was shown that in a
number of cases the testimony was of
fered by men that had been ordered off
the reservation by Davis, and on many
occasions had been escorted -off the
grounds by men under the command of
Davis. This clacs of testimony was of
fered freely but had little effect, as the
counrel for the defense showed that the
removal of the corporal through a- convic
tion on the charges preferred would
prove of great benefit to those who pre
ferred them. ,
The two companies of the Eleventh In
fantry will leave the Presidio this morn-
Ing at 8 o'clock "for the transport dock,
where they will embark on the transport
Lawton tor Manila. This detachment of
the Eleventh has been here since April L
It was due to sail on April 15, but was
kept here owing to the breaking out of
smallpox among the men. They were
eent to Angel island and remained there
for three week*;. They then returned to
â¢Lamp at the Presidio, and have been kept
there through the failure to complete the
repairs on the Lawton.
Lieutenant* J. I. McMullen arid William
S. Barrigcr have been assigned for duty
with the Fift2enth Cavalry at the Pre
sidio. .
Major George S. Young, Eighteenth In
fantry, has been ordered for duty at Al
catraz Island.
Veterinarian John Tempany, Ninth Cav
alry, has been ordered for duty at the
Presidio. Dr. Tempany Is the oldest man
at present doing active Ber vice in 'the
United States army. He has been a mem
ber of the organization since 185S, when
he enlisted in the First Dragoons, which
after the civil war became the First Cav
alry cf the organization of to-day. Dr.
Tempany patsed through San Francisco '
with the dragoons In 1858 under orders for
<Juty at Walla Walla. He passed through .
here again In 1861 en route to the scene :
of strife in the South. In 1S38 he went to
Cuba and served through the Spanish-
American war. At the close of that short
but bitter struggle he was ordered back
to the United States and sent over the
country to purchase horses for the cav
alry branch of the service. A short time
ago be was ordered to the Philippines, but
Â«he cessation of hostilities In the islands
.cndered his services unnecessary, and he i
has been assigned to duty here.

.Sessions procured tho agreement from
the California Improvement Company,
and among its provisions was one refer
ring to a quitclaim deed that Wilson held
to the property. Tho agreement ruclted
that this deed had been given by the
California Development Company to Wil
bop. for the solo purposo of permitting
his attorneys to examino It. The claim
â¢was mado that? having failed to perform
certain agreements In connection with
the making of the deed, Wilson was not
entitled to it and committed a fraud
when' ho had the transfer to, himself re
corded. â¢ â¢ Â¦ ' â¢ Â¦
Capitalist do Frcmery has evidently
been the object of Hollcitous inquiry
concerning his plans about the purchase
of tho property, but Wilson appears to
have headed off Sessions In the actual
nalo, for tho deed to Do Fremery is
made direct from Wilson. Along with
tnat deed 1h recorded an nsslgnmcnU
however, which tells more of tho story.

In a contract of snlÂ» of- tho Sessions
Hcsln property, made between H, W.
Oitrpfliuior and Reunions, later assigned
by Session* to tho California Improve
ment Company and HUbsMquontly to
Wilson, but tho last assignment is not
yet of record.
Apparently Sesslono has uteppM In
with his Hntpeedent contract and at
tempts to ho* pood his claim, while Wil
son haÂ» been negotiating on tho utrength
of his agreement with tho company.
This slgnlflnant clause is In tho assign
ment to Cuvolller of Wilson'* interests
in tho contract: "This assignment of
eald .contract shall not be construed ' an
creating any liability against, said Allen
D, Wilson In 'regard to camo,"
Neither Wilson nor Sessions have
shown any disposition to wage a public
warfare upon each other. They hnv<j re
fused to make? explanations. The De
Fremery side of the transaction appears
to be satisfied with the title gained from
Wilson, which he held on hla quitclaim
deed from the improvement company.
Agent Cuvellier said:
"My people do not fear the outcome of
any action Mr. Sessions may take over
the title to the property. We are con
fident our title is perfect and If the mat
ter goes into court we are satisfied that
wo can maintain our claim.
"This transfer of water front property
means much in the development of the
harbor front. Wharves and docks
be constructed and other facilities^ for
shipping will be provided, but at this
time I cannot give particulars. Of course
our people expect to derive a revenue
from their investment, but I am sure that
the improvements which will be estab
lished will be of great benefit to the
city."

LcwIh Mnnn haH p?onÂ« Knst with
Hetty Washington Mann.- *Mr.
Mnnn In still In Oakland.
TheÂ»o tact* hiivc more interest
behind them than tin ordinary nodal an
ndunrflment which interest* mainly those
mentioned. MrÂ». Graco Lewis Mann has
been well advertised of late.
First sho blazed, fftrth nÂ» a social light.
She was, so It was < said, a descendant,!
lineal or otherwise, of George Washing
ton. She was only 19 years. of age. That
trivial fact was of Interest because the
Daughters of tho American Revolution
had to take special action in order to
admit her to their ranks because of her
age. She was thereupon heralded by the
Industrious press agent as the youngest
Daughter' of the American Revolution.
Then Mrs. Mann named her baby Betty
Washington Mann, and pictures of Betty
minus costume were published for the
benefit of an admiring public. -
LaterfMrs. Mann, discoveredâthat she
was the owner of- the sword- of George
Washington: She declared that she was
going to sell her. great ancestor's side
arm to provide a dowry for Betty Wash
ington Mann, all of which duly became
public. l
It can therefore be seen that Mrs. Grace
Lewis Mann and Betty Washington Mann
are quite well known and have becomo
persons of considerable prominence. No
one had heard of Mr. Mann up to a few
ijays a?ro. Now Mr. Mann figures In a
story. He has come out of total eclipse,
having been hidden from sight since Mrs.
Mann sprang into r>rominence. He is em
ployed by the California Fruit Canning
Company and is the father -of Betty
Washington Mann and. the husband of
Grace Â«LeWls "Mann. ' ' â ~- .*--..,., ,
â¢ A week or two - ago Mr. Mann and his
wife had a little family difficulty, - which
resulted In Mrs. Mann, taking Batty
Washington' Mann and making a trip to
San Francisco, where she remained with
Mrs. Simons for a Â¦ week or more.
Then a legal contest began for Betty
Washington Mann and Papa Mann was
awarded the little one. Mrs. Mann finally
got her back, and this accomplished sho
packed Betty Washington Mann - and
Washington's sword up and headed^for
the East. â¢-â¢ â¢Â¦" . , â¢ Â¦ ..
Mr. Mann remains in Oakland and con
tinues with the California Fruit Canning
Company, and. Mrs. - Mann has had an
other chapter added to her : experiences. .

McKenzie Case Conclusive.
The case /against McKenzie was as con
clusive as testimony could make It, and it
was perhaps fortunate that the charge
was one of contempt only. He was sen
tenrod to serve a year in jail without' al
ternative, and he ' has served but a few
months. Besides serving his sentence
there were two things he had to do: one
waÂ« to return the gold dust he had In his
possession, which "he did, less ounces
amounting to $10.0QO. and $900 in cash, and
the other was to make good this shortage.
Ho said at the time he turned over tho
geld dust that he had the shortage In his
trunk at Seattle, -but it was Thursday last
before he turned it over.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT
JUDGE NOYES for the district
of Nome, whose attitude in the
recent mining litigation of that
district has resulted in his being
cited for contempt of tho United States
Circuit Court of Appeals, is to be suspend
ed or transferred to another Jurisdiction
pending the outcome of the contempt pro
ceedings.
Noyes' case has Just been decided upon
by the Judges of the Circuit Court
of Appeals and by the President, ani
Judge James Wickershain of the Eagle
City district has been appointed to fill his
place at Nome.
Following close on this announcement
also comes the news that the sentence
of the former receiver, Alexander McKen
zle, who has been Beveral months in the
Alameda County Jail for contempt simi
lar to that charged against Isuyes, has
been commuted In order that he may be
released from orison, his health belni?
so poor It was feared ho would dig if
confined longer.
The charge of contempt apalnst Judge
Noyes includes also Dudley Duboso and
Thomas J. Geary, the attorney* who nd
vjged McKenzie in the course that k*d him
to jail. This course consisted in dlHouoy-
Inc the writ of tho Circuit Court of Ap
peals, which commanded McKenzlo to re
turn to the owners certain ounces of gold
dust worth about *2u0.000. and forbade tho
District Court to tnko any further pro
ceedings In thÂ« matter. McKenzie <lld nut
return tho sold dunt and for a pood pnrt
of the time Him*'! ho has Ix-cn in jail In
consequence Noyen disregarded tho writ
directed to his court nnd continued to di
rect matters with orders of hlx own, and
he further refused to mako any order en
forcing upon McKcnzl* tho writ of ttupct
pfdefts from the Court of Appeals, as ho
claimed the Court of Appeals had .10 Jur
isdiction in the matter and that in ftny
case the proceedings appointing a receiver
were not appealable from his own court.
The whole ense turned upon the nppolnt
ment of McKenzie by .Noycs to net us re
ceiver of valuable mines then under a lit
igation that gave every appearance of
having been started with an evil purpose,
and an appeal to the Circuit Court of Ap
peals from the order of appointment.
Jlojea' Hasty Order.
In all the litigation that stirred to Its
'depths the temper of the miners of the
north Noyes was looked upon as a party
to a scheme to secure possession of the
richest claims with the aid of the Judi
cial machinery. Noyes had not been
twelve hours in Nome before he appoint
ed McKenzie a receiver of some claims
that rapidly put thousands of dollars In
gold dust into his keeping, and all through
the trouble the attitude of Noyes iJid the
court orders he made were on a oar with
his first order appointing McKenzie before
the vessel that brought him had well set
tled at her anchorage.
McKenzie was tried first and his con
victlcn of contempt was appealed to the
United States Supreme Court, where It
Â¦was affirmed. Tn the meantime, however,
proceedings against the others Implicated
In the doings at Nome were stopped,
pending the decision of the Supremo
Herrin Will Retire.

attorney, of the Southern Pacific, attorney
C. M. Hays, president of the Southern
Pacific Company, his issued this order: >
"No employe of the Southern Pacific
shall be a director or. an officer of an oil
company or of, any other outside corpora
tion, â¢ or engage. In any outside business,
but must give his- entire time to the ser
vice of tho Southern Pacific Company."
Enforcement of the foregoing: order will
compel many well-known employes of the
railroad corporation to leave the service
of the company' or â¢ surrender \ lucrative
employment in other fields. It is accepted
as a certainty that the displacement of J.
B. "Wright from his position as division
superintendent will soon be followed by
other changes of equal or greater note.
The inside story of Colonel Wright's de
thronement constitutes one of the most
interesting chapters in the history of a

HAY'S ORDER
FORESHADOWS
A
SHAKE-UP
SCANDAL HINTED
AT IN AFFIDAVIT
Fire Department Officers
Make Interesting
Statements.
Motion for the Inspection of
Maxwell's Books Is Filed
in Court.
Bfttulton Chief Dolan also r<>m*mb*rÂ«
th* payment to Dougherty ot $1400 "for
collective interests of the association.'
Moreover. he remember* the payment In
lpno of 11203 to banquet the upper men in
nfflee. Perhaps the nick, sore and needy
frit much better after the big men in the
upper office were banqueted, but as to
that feeling the affiant Dolan is silent.
The motion to Inspect receipts and ac
counts of the old association will be heard
on demurrer In Department 12. Superior
Court, Tuesday. May 28, at 10 a. m.
M. J. Dolan, battalion engineer. sayÂ» in
hie affidavit that he was treasurer of the
association in 1W0. It is hiÂ« recollection
that the book showing disbursement of
r.Khodation raonpv contains an entry of
the payment In 1853 of $900 to the "com
mittee on legislation for use in the I^egin
lature." DolaJi does not aver that this
payment alleviated dlÂ»treÂ«s among the
sick and disabled of the department. No
doubt it wan a great boon to *un>rinB
nvmbeni of the Ban FranclÂ»co delegation
In the IveginJatur*.
74r. Dofan's r*fjvihed memory recalls
nnflther Item dignifying the payment of
XSfci for the 'Vngrowment of resolution*
In favor of 8am Bainey." The affidavit
doc* not dwell on tin- beauty and extent
of th* tribute to Mr. Ralney'n private
rhurfcctrr und public service, but logical
nudy of thÂ« turn persuade* onÂ« to the
conclusion that the testimonial must h&vo
combined elfgancft with marvelous ampli
tude to have cost S3S5 for engrossment
alon*. '
Honey Paid Out
7 he proposed new protective association
which Is supposed to be Inspired by Phe
lan promises the substantial benefit of $10
a week to the disabled firemen, and also
holds out assurance that the "boys" may
In the future express their wishes as to
the management of the association by se
cret ballot. â¢ The eld association as man
need by Sam Rainey and George Maxwell
places the votlns power In the foremen of
the respective engine companies.
The Fire Commissioners are the defend
ants In the suit instituted by Maxwell to
perpetuate the old association, and these
rfefendnnts. through JJoyd & Wood and
J. C. McKlnetry, now ask the court for
the right to Inspect the books and ac
counts of the old Mutual Aid Association
of the Fire Department. The motion is
backed by affidavits of an interesting
character. J. Dougherty, assistant chief
engineer. Is one of the affidavit makers.
His memory goes back to 1S89. He calls
to mind that $1400 or $1500 was paid to
George F. Maxwell in that year for pri
mary election purposes. The measure of
benefit conveyed to the Blck and suffering
by this disbursement is not set forth In
the affldaxit. The payment was entered
on the books as money expended "for col
lective interests of the association."
Makes Big Promises.
Affidavits filed In the Superior Court
yesterday hold out a promise that many
Jmportant political secrets of the Fire De
partment of San Francisco may soon be
revealed to an eager public. Some time
arc George F. Maxwell brought a suit
to restrain the tire Commissioners from
dissolving the San* Francisco Fire Depart
ment Mutual Aid Association and creat
ing a new protective society. The impres
sion exists that Mayor Phelan Is behind
the new organization, manipulating the
by-laws and providing conditions of mem
bership that will exclude from the society
Georpe F. Maxwell and others . who are
not active members of the Fire Depart
ment. When the true history of the last
municipal campaign is recorded it will be
written truthfully that Phelan entered
Into a league with politicians of the Fire
Department wherein it was agreed that
Mas well should be retained in office as
secretary of the Commissioners under the
new charter. The covenant with the poli
ticians was broken by Phelan for reasons
best known to himself, hence Maxwell
was turned out. \
