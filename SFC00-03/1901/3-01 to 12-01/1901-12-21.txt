COURT SENDS
DISS DE BAR
TO A PRISON

Convicted.
English Magistrate Wastes
No Time in Passing
Sentence.
â Woman and Her Alleged Htxsband
Must Serve Many Years Behind
the Bars for Their Eumer
otis Crimes.
LONDON, Dec 20.â Theodore and Laura
Jackson, the latter best known In the
United States by the name of Ann O* Delia
Dlas de Bar. were found guilty to-day by
a Jury la the Old Bailey on charges of
Immoral practices and fraud. The Judge
Immediately Imposed sentences of fifteen
and seven years' penal servitude upon
Jackson and Ms reputed wife, respec
tively.
The prisoners listened to the passage of
sentence In evident astonishment, but
maintained silence. As the Judge fin
ished Jackson turned from the prisoners'
dock Â£nd walked down the steps. "Swa
mie. M as the woman head of the so-called
â¢Theocratic Unity" has latterly called
herself, smiled, bowed to the Judge and
court and followed her male companion
to where officers were waiting to take
them to prison.
Anticipating: that a verdict 'would be
reached to-day, the Interest In the trial
Tras revived end the courtroom was well
filled when the proceedings were re
sumed. The female prisoner, as usual,
furnished the dramatic features of the
examination of the witnesses, cross-ex
amining them in modulated tones, and al
ternately whining or threatening. When
the case for the prosecution -was closed
the defendants announced that they would
not call any witnesses, but would" testify
in their own behalf.
Jackson. Delivers a Lecture.
Jackson was then sworn and com
menced an address, very much In the na
ture of a lecture, in the course of which
he claimed to be a man bound to
single life by a religious vow and em
phatically denied the testimony furnished
as to his living with Daisy Adams,- whose
*tory. he eaid, was a tissue of falsehood.
He described the female prisoner as a
medium through whom hÂ© (Jackson)
Had "communicated with his spirit wife."
Jackson, in his address, referred to his
estate of 7220 acres of land In Florida,
and dwelt at great length on the princi
ples of theocratic unity. â¢
During his cross-examination Jackson
was very insolent to the Solicitor Gen
eral, Sir Edward Carson. The Judge
warned Jackson that he was Injuring his
case, whereupon the female defendant in
terjected approvingly: "That's right.
SLeep him in order."
While the Solicitor General was exam
ining Jackson the latter casually remark
ed: *"If Swamie (a name by which tho
female defendant is known) Is guilty, I
am guilty also."
Mrs. Jackson quickly rose to her feet
(having been accommodated with a chair
in the dock) and refused to be Included
with Jackson in the charge of criminal
BssmslL
When asked whether Mrs. Jackson had
been Imprisoned In New Orleans Jackson
refused to answer until the question was
repeated to him by the female defendant.
He then said she had been in Jail twice.
Diss de Earr Mentioned.
Mrs. Jackson then testified. During her
crcss-examlnation the name of Diss de
Bar was mentioned for the first time In
court, the witness admitting that she was
the divorced wife of General Diss de Bar,
adding that she had Inherited a fortune
from him. The woman also admitted that
Ehe had been married to a man named
McGool and to Ph. MessauL She said her
income from the Diss de Bar property was
$14,000 yearly. She acknowledged that she
hod served clx months In jail in New Tork
for defrauding Luther C. Marsh, and de
nied that she had ever been known as
Vera P. Ava.
After Mrs. Jackson had made a general
dinlal of crime* charged against her, the
Solicitor General announced that as the
prisoners were not defended he would not
address the Jury. Jackson then began a
epÂ«ech to the jury. He said it was xnon
etrous that this infamous charge had been
laid at their door, especially considering
tbat his companion had devoted her life
to Christian reform.
"However," he added, "I believe that ab
solute Justice can be obtained from an
English Judge and jury, which is more
thaii 1 can say for America."
The female prisoner, in turn, addressed
the Jury. Drawing her classic robe around
her ample form and raising herself to her
full height she held the court spellbound
for over an hour. Mrs. Jackson seemed
never at a loss for words. She carefully
dir-sected all the evidence and wound up
with a powerful peroration to the effect
that she did not desire any halting, am
biguous verdict, but an unequivocal ex
pression of justice.
Justice Bigham then summed up very
strongly against the prisoners, saying it
was difficult to conceive of more revolting
and abominable conduct. He said that he
would not be doing his duty unless he
prevented the male prisoner from practic
ing such acts under the cloak of religion
for years to come. The Jury was absent
less than five minutes. Silence^ followed
the pronouncement of the word "guilty"
and the Judge quickly passed the sen
terces.

Investigation at
Once.
p*~nr<l HE death list of the Southern
1 Pacific disaster at Uplands, Mon
8 terey County, has reached a total
â **â¢ of five, and there it is likely to
stop, as none of the other injured
passengers or trainmen are believed to
be In danger of succumbing to their in
juries. Two Italians, John Cordona and
Francisco Savanla, died early yesterday
morning at the Southern Pacific Hos
pital. Another charred body was â  disen
tombed from the wreckage at Uplands at
noon. It Is supposed to be the body of a
tramp who was riding the brakebeam.
The members of the train crews were
In attendance yesterday at the Inquest
et San , Lucas on the bodies of William
C. Garland and Owen A. Thurber, the
first known victims of the wreck. If
the trainmen get back in time Superin
tendent Worthington of â  the Coast di
vision will hold an investigation at 9
o'clock this morning-, after which he will
make his report and recommendations to
Manager Agler.
Engineer Coffey has been temporarily
suspended. He is bedfast at his home,
2920 Sixteenth street, his body racked
with pain from his Injuries, but he is suf
fering a thousand times more from men
tal anguish. He said yesterday:
My consolation Is this, they all speak well of
me. I have no enemies and they all say I was
careful and reliable and never made mistakes.
But those poor people â why wasn't I allowed
to die with them?
It will all come out at the Investigation.
The enslne I had was a fine machine, but we
engineers like the old-style engine better. It
was the first run I had made on her and the
injector was giving me trouble. While I â was
working with it we passed the whistling post
a mile the other side of the Uplands switch.
I did not see the post and did . not whistle
or apply the brakes. Neither did I notice when
we rocked over ' the frogs at the switch. I
believed we had not yet reached the whistling
post. I had not forgotten my v orders. Then
suddenly the danger loomed up in front. .In
stinctively I applied the emergency brakes and
closed the throttle. Dameron. my fireman, did
not gee the danger until . I chouted to him.
I had done all I could do and as the train
slowed down to twenty , miles an : hour I
jumped. Dameron will ' not say' at' the in
vestigation that he closed the throttle or ap
plied the brakes. I did all that myself and

would have reversed " the engine only for; its
having driving brakes. Every wheel on the
engine was equipped with brakes which are
capable of stopping her quicker than can be
done by reversing, which causes her to slide
as if down a chute.
I am going; to be at the investigation to
morrow If I have to be taken on a stretcher
and I believe that railroad men will not blame
me when the . evidence Is all in.
Superintendent Worthington said yes
terday:
Coffey was one of the best engineers on the
road. He was always' careful, conscientious
and capable. Conductors were always clad to
have him on the engine for then they felt
safe. . He has been railroading for fourteen
years. For six years he was a fireman, then
he was promoted to engineer and for a long
time he ran on a freight train. For two -years
and a half he has been hauling passenger
trains. There Is no doubt of his competency
and reliability., He was always sober and
when In the , city could always be found at
home. He certainly deserves sympathy, for
the poor fellow is almost crazed and his in
quiries about- the dead and Injured are piteous.
I went to see him this morning, not to put
him on the rack.- but out of sympathy.
The situation Coffey faced was so elementary
that his mistake- seems unexplalnable. There
were no complications. He had a simple order,
received at San Ardo. It was the only order
In his possession and No. 10 was the . only
'train with which, he â  bad to concern himself.
The, most Inexperienced man' In the business
would have had no cause to become confused.
There iÂ« no doubt as to the speed, of the
train. No. 9, left 'San Ardo at 12:55. The
collision occurred at exactly 1:00. The distance
between San Ardo and Uplands Is 6.2 miles
and the wreck was at a point .8 of a mile
farther west, making j the distance traveled | in
11 minutes exactly by, miles. That shows tho
train to have been traveling- at the . rate^of
thirty miles an hour, and all statements of
the rate being forty to fifty miles an hour are
nonsense. /'' Engineer Coffey believes the speed
was not more than twenty miles an hour when
the trains struck. ; The emergency brakes were
set and the throttle of Coftey's engine closed â
whether by Coffey or by the fireman, Dameron,
I^do not know. .
The engine, 1436,- under Coftey's control, v .ls
one of the finest large eight- wheel passenger
engines belonging to the Southern Pacific Com
pany. It Is of the . "C. W." jj class and ' has a
72-lnch driver. 00.000 pounds on the drivers
and 190 pounds of steam. She has been giving
excellent service on through overland trains
on the western division for a long time and
was assigned to the coast division when : the
new card took effect on December. 6. She was
In first-class shape and the superintendent and
master mechanic of tha western division ob
jected strenuously, to the engine being â¢ taken
from them. Any contention by Coffey that the
engine was "cranky" and took his attention
from the track will scarcely prove valid.
Cordona and Savanla, the two men who
died in the hospital yesterday, were Ital
ian section hands who were returning
to Cordona's home in Oakland, where
they intended passing the holidays. Cor
dona was . 65 years old, and ' he leaves a
large family. ; Savahia was not married.
The liabilities for personal damages of
the railroad company will not be heavy.
Of the passengers :who had paid fares
none were seriously. Injured, and many of
them have. already accepted settlements
offered by ' the company. Cordona,. and
Savanla, former / employes, were riding
on passes. ..-.. \
The , Wells-Fargo Company does not
know the extent j of its loss, and will â¢ not
know until reports are In from offices all
along the line. ;'It is known. that a large
amount of. coin was . In the , car, but the
waybills were burned. It was stated in
Superintendent Liangtry*s office yesterday
that any estimate : of the company's â  loss
would be simply guesswork, as â¢little re
liable as guessing -at the winning num
ber in a lottery. :!: , .'
CROWDS : VIEW . THE WBECEL
SALINAS, Dec 20.â The spot where the
collision occurred on the Southern -Pacific
Railroad at Uplands Thursday morning
is still the scene of many visitors curious
to, view the wreck of two; iron horses.
People from far! and ' near -'flock to \ the
scene of the disaster anxiously, watching
every', movement made by -the clearing
crew, fearful that some friend might be
uncovered at any, minute. The debris is
being raised as rapidly as human hands
can accomplish it, but it will be three or
four days before the work will be com
pleted.
Latest reports received in this city, give
the finding of one more body and, many
more ' are expected to be ' found. Reports

Wednesday night the engineer on this
train was given orders at King City to
remain there until the arrival of the
northbound train, but on; looking at his
watch he claimed he had ample time in

The night operator, at King City, on be

Engine Breaks Down.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 20.â The north-bound
Los Angeles express had a succession of
breakdowns to-night, finally being tied up
for several hours at a point about three
miles from San Jose. A broken eccentric
was said to be the cause of the trouble.
Efforts were made to secure an engine
from San Jose. Conductor Muller took a
passenger's bicycle that was in the bag
gage- car and rode around the neighbor
hood seeking assistance. Passengers tried
to find a telephone, but their efforts were
unavailing. Finally the break was re
paired and the train crawled into San
Jose many hours late. The passengers
were landed in San Francisco nearly three
hours behind time.

PRICE FIVE CENTS,
JUDGE SAYS
HIS LIFE IS
IN JEOPARDY
Hints That Lynchers'
Counsel Desire His
Assassination.
Remarkable Utterance Prom
the Bench During the Al
turas Trial.
Attorneys for the Defense Hake Bit
ter Retort and for a Time a
Courtroom Tragedy Is
Threatened.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
AL.TURAS. Dec. 20.â For a time to-day
spectators at the trial of James W. Brown.,
the alleged Lookout lyncher, were mo
mentarily expecting to see pistols brought
into play and to hear the ping of bullets.
Probably no more exciting scene has ever
been enacted in a California court than
occurred thi3 afternoon, when Superior
Judge Harrington declared In unequivocal
terms from the bench that the attorneys
for the defense desired his assassination.
The Judge did not mince words, and his
expressed fear that he would be shot
from ambush before the present trials
were concluded brought bitter retorts
from the attorneys for Brown. Raker,
one of the men representing the defen
dant, grossly insulted the court In his
reply, but in the excitement of the mo
ment his remark was passed with only a
verbal rebuke. The bitterness between
Judge Harrington and Attorneys Harris
and Raker, representing the* alleged
lynchers, has now grown to deadly
hatred, and residents of Alturas are pre
dicting that a tragedy will be enacted be
fore the present trial draws to a close.
Agnes Wilson was on the stand under
cross-examination and the. defense tried
in every possible way to cause the child
to contradict herself. Agnes testified that
she unhitched the horses she and her
mother had used in coming back from
Bieber and tied them" to the hitching post.
Deputy Constable Brown, the defendant,
unhitched them from the post and kicked
them and they ran away. This was on
the day of the arrest of her stepfather.
Calvin Hall, and her brothers. The girl
and her mother found their home in the
greatest disorder, it having been searched
try the party.
â  Court Fears Assassination.
It was. during the cross-examination of
the half-breed child that the bitter dis
pute between the court and counsel for
the defense arose. Brown's lawyers at
tacked the girl's testimony and incident
ally the character of the members of the
family. Finally Judge Harrington inter
posed.
"Such conduct will not be permitted
while I am on the bench," said he.
"Well, you won't be there long," retort
ed Lawyer Harris.
"I will be here until my term is up.
Judge Harris, unless some of you assas
sinate mo or shoot me from behind,"
answered the court.
Harris said* that ha never yet tried to
assassinate any human being, and the
court replied In substance that he had.
"You can't prove any such thing." ex
claimed Harris, and Raker, his associate
counsel, added:
"Well, that is a nice remark for a man
to make on the bench. We don't want to
kill anybody. If I wanted to kill any
body, I would kill a man. There is no
man in here wants to assassinate you or
anybody else. If there is we want to see
him. I can prove by a dozen different
witnesses that witness Courtwright said
he came down off the stand to kill me
and would have done so if the Sheriff
had not interfered."
"This is none of your put-in, Mr. Ra
ker. Harris is the man I have been talk
ing to, and when the time comes I can
prove my assertion," said the court.
"You can't prove any such thing by
anybody," was Judge Harris' retort.
Apologies Not Forthcoming.
Here the controversy ended without
apologies from any of the three. Neither
of the attorneys representing the State
had anything to- say while the war of
words was proceeding.
When some measure of calm had been
restored Agnes Wilson continued her tes
timony. She said that after Calvin Hall's
arrest Deputy Constable Brown swore at
the aged man and jabbed him in the back
with the muzzle of his rifle.
Counsel for the defense thia afternoon
objected to Assistant Attorney General
Post quoting law in support of his argu
ments. Judge Harris declared that this
was not a law college, but sarcastically
remarked that If Post should start such
an Institution he (Harris) would attend.

Judge Advocate Reports.
Judge Advocate Lemly and j Solicitor
Harm* this aiieraoon submitted to Secre
tary Liong their report of the bill of ob
jecdons Wed by Admiral Schley through
jiis counsel to the rinding of tne Schiey
court of inquiry. In suDStance this re
port is nn argument supplementary to liie
argument made by the writers before thj
court of inquiry. The principal points are
an insistence upon their contention that
the first report is the unanimous report
of the court of inquiry; that the court
was justified in rejecting Admiral
Scniey s evidence by the number of wit
ness who took issue with him, and tiiat
there is no sufficient reason for a reopen
ing of the case, as requested by Admiral
ScnJey.
The report begins:
A comxE-uoication dated the ISth instant,
Elgaed by Hear Admiral WJ S. Schley and by
lsid&r haynor and James Parker, his coun
sel, objecuns to the approval of ihe findings
cf the court of Inquiry in the case of Rear
Admiral Scbley, and asking particularly, that
â¢ohat the signers are pleased to term the opin
ion cf tbe majority of the court be remined
to the court for further consideration, has
been received bv this department for refer
ence, and is returned with the following etate-
It is somewhat difficult to deal with this pa
per on account of its general and non-specific
character aad sweeping though unsupported
assertion of opinion by the applicant and
by his counsel that, in their Judgment, the ad
verse finding of the court is not Justified by
the evidence. The paper might be dismissed
as eimply a not unexpected expression of dis
satisfaction with an adverse judgment, but
for the fact that it contains a number of mis
riateinenis, and particularly has woven
throughout the entire structure an "inaccurate
and misleading" use cf the words "majority of
the court." ' *L
The findings of fact and the opinion of the
court of inquirv In the case of Admiral Schley
on the more important and material points
before it were not reached by a majority of
the members only, but by the entire court.
The points of the precept upon which all the
members of the court unite appear to be in
controvertibly established by the evidence;, it
is not understood how any other conclusions
conld have been reached upon them, and they
constitute the essential features of the entire
matter under inquiry.
Justifies the Findings.
Lemly and Hanna reviewed at length
the conclusions of the court as to the first
teL charges of the precept, justifying the
findings and declaring that in the face of
tLe facts the court could not have found
oiLc-iwise. The report continues:
I_"pon the points above ect forth, which ap
pear to embrace substantially the important
matters cove-red by the inquiry, the court i3
united and its findings are unanimous. They are
sustained by the unimpeached and unimpeach
able testimony of Commodore Schley's brother
officers, who served with and under him, by
official telegrams, lette-rs and reports and by
the logs of the several vessels of his squadron,
tr\i it would accordingly be idle to remit these
matters to the same body for reconsideration
unon the same evidence.
"it is not by any means intended here to say
that the foregoing principal points covered by
the inquiry are the only points upon whicn
the findings of the court are in all respects or
substantially unanimous; because the truth is
that the court is a unit upon all points, exempt
those as to which the admiral expresses indi
vidual but not in all casts contradictory views.
It does not appear that any good purpose
would be served by asking the court to recon
sider these. ,'â¢ '/â  ;
The judge advocate and his assistant
<?tr:y that the court failed to consider evi
dence. "It was their sworn duty." says
the report, "to consider and weigh that
evidence and the applicant and his coun
sel have no right to say that they have
disregarded it. The court had a perfect
right, after weighing it, to ignore any tes
tiirscny." .' â  â¢; , .
As to Wto "Was in Command.
Relative to the contention as to who
commanded the naval forces in the battle
of Santiago, the report says:
If the applicant and his counsel seriouMy
believe, as they now state to be the case, that
the matter of command on July 3 was essen
tial to the applicant's interests it was their
plain duty not only to bring the question be
fore the court, but to insist upon a hearing
thÂ«rÂ«?, and other Interests should have been
heard. To request that the court now rule
upon it is tn ask that another officer's inter
ests be passed upon, to his possible prejudlc;,
in his absence, and -without a hearingâ a thins
intolerable, whomsoever may be concerned.
In conclusion we are satisfied that no goo'l
purpose would be served : by remitting the
proceedings or any of the . features of this in
quiry to the court. A more patient, exhaustive
and painstaking -hearing -was never, given;
greater consideration was never extended to
any officer before a military court cf inquiry.
No expense was spared, no convenience or fa
cility denied, no -courtesy refused. The appli
cant has had his day in court and the Judg
ment is against â  him. - It is accordingly recom
mended that the proceedings be not returned,
but that the matter be concluded by the de
partment's epproval of the unanimous finding.
We have the honor to be.

The Secretary of the Xavy.
The report, as appears from Its text. Is
solely that of Judgre- Advocate General
Lcmly and Solicitor Hanna, and as such
it was laid before Secretary Long. The
Secretary said this afternoon that he
would not act upon the report to-day. lie
adced that he would also : withhold action
to-day on tne other matters pending: con
nected v.-ith this Issue, namely. Admiral
Sampson's appeal nr.d Admiral Schley's
n<;uest to be allowed to be heard by argu

the court of inquiry itself. There was an
intimation, however, that all of these mat

and would be finally disposed of as far as
the department Is etneerned.
Sampson's Objections Filed.
Tbe objection of Admiral W. T. Sampson
to that portion of Admiral Dewey's report
of the Schley court or inquiry. In which
he says Admiral Schley was in command
at the battle of Santiago and entitled to
the credit for the victory, was filed with
Secretary Long to-day. The document
was- broug:ht to the Navy â¢ Department by
K. S. Theall of counsel for Admiral Samp
8on, who handed it to the Secretary. It is
as follows:
SO BROAD STREET,
NEW YORK. Dec. 19. 1901.
SJr: Am counsel for Rear Admiral Sampson
we have the honor to request that the de
partment, tor the reasons below stated, strike
out or officially disapprove that portion of
Admiral Dewey'e opinion filed In connection
with the proceedings of the fichley court of
inquiry in which he stated his view . to be
that Commodore Schley was in absolute com
mand at the navÂ£l battle of Santiago.
X. Commodore Schley Was not in command
at that battle.
II. ThÂ« President of the United States and
the Navy Department bad decided that Ad
znlral Sampson waa In command at that bat-
tle and Commodore Schley second In com
mand.
III. The question as to the command at San
tiago was not referred to the court for con
sideration and. evidence bearing on the point
was excluded. - . â¢,.;:â  â ::
L Commodpre Schley was not In command
at that battle.
(a) The disposition of the forces at the
beginning- of the battle, according â¢ to Commo
dore Schley's own statement, places Admiral
Sampson in command.
The Brooklyn and tne Vixen were the west
ernmost ships of the fleet; the Indiana and
Gloucester were the easternmost. The New
York was nearer both of the latter than was
the Brooklyn, and notably at the time when
the Indiana was heavily engaged at the be
ginning of the action and when the Gloucester
was engaged with the Furor and Huton.
Commodore Schley cays:
"The Indiana and Gloucester â¢ â¢ â¢ were
closer to your flagship," than to the Brook
lyn. We have then the case of a/ fleet in a
regular formation with the commander in
chief within signal distance and closer to ; a
large number of ships than is the second in
command. It is true that the commander
in chief could not have reached the most dis
stant vessel by signals, except by causing
ihem to be repeated by an intermediate vessel
â aa entirely useless course â but it is also
true that the second in command couH not
have reached the remote vessels of the fleet
namely the Indiana and the Gloucester â with
out likewise repeating signals. Â»
Senior Officer Is Responsible.
la this state of affairs, the regulations of
the navy and the customs of the sea â  place
the absolute command and the full responsi
bility in the senior officer.
(b) The Brooklyn's maneuver during the
action destroys any claim that Commodore
Schley might have had to the command. â¢ Tho
tacts as to the loop are found by the court.
The finding and opinion show that to avoid
danger to his own ship he maneuvered with
out warning to the rest oz the squadron, and
in disregard of the fleet formation.
IL The President of the United States and
the Navy Department had decided that Ad
miral Sampson was in command at that bat
tle and Commodore Schley second in command.
This fact was before the court; for the Sec
retary's letter to the Senate (dated February
<Â», 1S99) states that the Spanish squadron was
destroyed "by our fleet under his (Sampson's)
command," and the advancement of Commo
dore Schley was proposed in recognition of his
services as next in rank at the battle of San
tiaro.
III. The question as to who commanded at
Santiago was not referred to the court for
consideration. Evidence bearing on the point
waa excluded.
(a) If Commodore Schley. was in command
Admiral Sampson was not. and if the question
as to which was in command was to be con
sidered by the court surely Admiral Sampson
became an interested party and under the pre
cept was entitled to the hearing which was
repeatedly refused him.
(b) The language of the precept excludes
the question as to who commanded at that
battle. It directs the court to inquire into
the conduct of Admiral Schley â not into his
status or as to whether or not he was in com
mand â and to report its conclusions upon his
conduct in connection with the events of the
Santiago campaign.
(c) Tbe Judicial officers of the court main
tained that this matter was outside the scope
of the inquiry. They expressed willingness
to go Into it if their view should be-over
ruled, but were in every instance sustained by
the court.
Court Proceedings Quoted.
Thus at pajre 15T the assistant to the judge
advocate said: "One further word as to a
suggestion just made as to the intention to
show that Admiral Sampson was not in this
battle. I wish to say that we do not under
stand that the question whether Admiral Samp,
son was or was not in the battle of Santiago
Is before the court. If it is we shall be happy
to investigate it. â¢ â¢ â¢ Until the case takes
that attitude it is improper to spread upon the
records arguments and questions which pro
ceed upon the theory that he ia in the case."
Counsel for the applicant withdrew the
question.
At page 490 of the record the same matter
being under discussion. Mr. Hanna said; "If
it is the desire of the court to go into these
things it would, of course, be proper, but it
would not be necessary. â¢ * â¢ We are thor
oughly prepared to go into any discussion of
them provided the court desires so "to enlarge
and extend the scope of this inquiry."
Counsel for the applicant arain failed to
press the point and the court made no objec
tion to Mr. Hanna'a view.
At pages 153 and 1080 there were similar
rulings by the judge advocate. In the case
of all those declarations there was acquiescence
on the part of the court. â  - .
(d) The court uniformly rejected evidence
as to who commanded. On all the pages herein
cited frcm the record the court rejected such
evidence and nowhere was It admitted against
objection.
(e) The court more than once specifically
ruled that thl3 question was not before it.
For example: At psffÂ« 15S0. where the ques
tion was as to the position of ihe commander
in chief and of the New York and as to the
part they took in the "battle. Admiral Dewey
raid: "VTe do not want that. We have ruled
that cut." The Judge advocate then asked If
the court had so ruled and Admiral Dewey re
plied: "We have. We have kept tae â  New
York out of it."
See also page 4S1:
E.ow the Court Euled.
(O â The court went so far as to rule, at
pege 1%21, that Admiral Schley was not in
commend during the battle. The matter then
before the court related to the periods during
which Admiral Schley had been in absolute
command, and the Judge advocate said: "Mr.
Raync-r. you are confining yourself to July
ere ycu?"
Rayner, in reply, acquiesced in this view,
and the court ruled that "all. questions
â¢ â¢ â¢ shall be confined to between the ISHls
cf May and the let of June, relating to th<j
organization, management and control of that
rquadion, when he was actually commander
lu-chicf. Matters referring tothis alleged com-*
raand on July :i were excluded."
On page 1133 the court confirms this deci
sion.
<SJâ All propeeed questions on this subject
wore either rejected by the court or withdrawn
by the applicant, who finally acquiesced in the
decisions of the court and tjave up his ef
forts in this behalf, saying: "I bow respect
fully to the decision of the court and I know
exactly what it means."
Instances of the withdrawal cf such ques
tions rrd o? their rejection by the court will
be found in the record at paces 13S, 157' iS>4,
183 and 1080.
(h) â The minority opinion expressed by Ad
miral Dewey in this matter is at variance with
all the- rullnss of the court in this regard and
diroctly contradicts the letters wherein Ad
miral Dewey for the' court, defines Admiral
Sampson's status.
The Navy Dcr-artment*. in Its precept had
justly provided that. any person "Interested"
might be' given an opportunity of appearing
before the court in persan or by counsel and
protecting his rights. As counsel for the ap
plicant ignored, at times the court's rulmg3
and piiread upon the record arguments reflect
ing upon 'Admiral Sampson, we, as his counsel,
three separate times appealed to the court,
cskiEg for protection or lor permission to ap
pear and defend Admiral Sampson's rights.
Each time our request was denied and we were
assured that Admiral Samson was not in
volved, and findly. Admiral Dewey, acknowl
edging the receipt of . on<Â» of our letters in
â¢which we haa -appealea to him on the ground
of this very -question as to who .cemmanded
at Santiago, . said : [ "I have to state while
the precept convening this court gives it au
thority to permit any person whom it may
regard as * concerned in the investigation, to
be present * â¢ â¢ the court considered that
Admiral Sampson \a not an Interested party
â¢ â¢ * and ycu aie further informed that If
circumstances arise which, in the opinion of
tho court, render it necessary for Admiral
Sampson to be represented due notice will be
sent him."
Upon that promise Admiral Sampson relied.
The notice came only in the form of a minor
ity opinion by Admiral Dewey discussing mat
ters beyond the accpe of the precept and
nowhere Included In the facts found by the
court. Very respectfully,
STAYTON & CAMPBELL.
', E. S. THEALL,
Counsel for Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson.
To the Hon. Secretary or the Navy.
May Seek New Solution.
Early in the day Admiral Schley be
came aware of the fact that the protest
of Stayton & Campbell on behalf of Ad
miral Sampson had reached Secretary
Long, and he made a request of the Secre
tary to be furnished with an official copy
of the protest, but was informed that aa
the protests of both admirals at that time
were being considered by the Judge advo
cate general the Secretary could not take
immediate action on the request. Secre
tary Long went to the White House some
time before the Cabinet meeting, and it Is
understood he took with him the two doc

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1901.
GAGE TO RETIRE FROM CABINET,
BUT HAY WILL RETAIN PORTFOLIO
Secretary of â  the Treasury Says He Has Not "Formally Resigned, but
His Intention Is to Relinquish Place in Cabinet Before Spring or
as Soon as President Roosevelt Can Select a Suitable Successor
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â It Is
Secretary Gage's intention to
. relinquish the treasury port
folio as soon as President
Roosevelt can find a suitable
successor, and he has so informed the
President. Gage would like to be re
lieved before spring. The President has
done all he could to dissuade Secretary
Gage from retiring and will probably con
tinue to use his efforts in that direction.
Secretary Gage's â  determination to retire
was made known to the President some
little time ago, just how long Is not
known. The long conference between the
President and the Secretary before the
Cabinet meeting which followed the Sec
retary's return from New York, where he
attended the banquet of the Bankers' As
sociation last night, had nothing to do
with the question of the Secretary's res
ignation. It related to the matter of the
removal of Appraiser Wakeman. :
After the Cabinet meeting Secretary
Gage declined to say anything about the
rumors of his resignation beyond the sim
ple statement that he had not "formally"
resigned.
"What I may or may not do eventually
I am not prepared to say now," said the
Secretary. "But I can say that the rela
tions between the President and myself
are perfectly cordial. He would do almost
anything I would ask and I would do
almo3t anything he might ask."
In view of the repeated publications of
late to the general effect that Secretary
Hay is about to retire from the Cabinet,
a statement is given with full authority
touching this subject substantially to the
effect that Secretary Hay does not now
contemplate retirement from the Cabinet.
This statement applies not only to the
present moment, but to that indefinite
period fixed by the conclusion of.the-ne-.
ITALY WANTS
MORE PROTECTION
Question of Lynching in
This Country Is
Discussed.
ROME, Dec. 20.â In tho Senate to-day
Baron Fava, formerly Italian Embassador
at Washington, raisbd the question of
lynchir.gs in the .United States in which
there had been a repetition of grave
events, he said, and where the guilty per
sons had notbeen discovered. Baron Fava
referred to" the:- suggestion' of the late
President McKinley, after the lynching at
Erwin, Miss., respecting legislation for the
protection, of foreigners and alluded feel
ingly to the high esteem in which the late
President McKinley and the late King
Humbert! both victims of-assassins, were
held by their respective, countrymen.
Kepiying to Baron Fava, Signor Prin-.
etti, Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared
that neither the Italian Government nor
Italian diplomats were guilty of any neg
ligence in their efforts to secure the tri
umph of Justice, but, owing to the reti
cence of witnesses,. it had beeh impossible
to Identify the culprits and the Grand
Jury had declared, according to the Usual
formula, that the lynching In question
haa occurred by "the will of God." This
statement from Signor Prinetti. caused a
sensation. .
Continuing, the . Foreign Minister ' said
that the% Italian Government would con
tinue to protest, in the hope of obtaining
satisfaction, against a state of affairs
which- constituted an> offense against in
ternational treaties."' The Government had
represented what a serious thing it waa,
said Signor Prinetti, that the Government
of the United States should declare itself
unable to fulfill Its engagements In con
formity with the international treaties.
To this representation the American
Government nad not replied in writing,
but it had admitted that the ' Italian
claims were well founded, and had prom
ised carefully to consider the question.
Minister Prinetti said that he agreed with
Baron Fava i^his expressed opinion that
dence and report to the' President. It is
said there are a. number of .precedents for
such action. â  â  . .â  .
â¢Dr. W. H. Dickson, the physician In at
tendance upon Rear Admiral Sampson,
to-day made the following statement re
garding his patient's condition:
The admiral is not in any immediate dan
ger. HÂ« gets out for exercise every day,
weather permitting. He smokes his cigar after
dinner. He Is not feeble, but Just in impaired
health. His . heart action is quite vigorous.'
His life may be prolonged for many years or
it may be very brief, so far as any. one knows.

gotiatlons to the construction of an isth
mian canal. Also it is stated with equal
positiveness and authority that President
Koosevelt has in the strongest terms ex
pressed to Secretary Hay his earnest de
sire that he shall remain in the Cabinet,
of which he forms one of the principal
props. Thus, according to the statement,
the Secretary's Inclinations and the Presi
dent's desires run together and there is
an indemnity for the lives of Italians who
had been lynched should not be refused,
but that he considered that indemnities
ought not to be regarded as a set off to
the crimes committed.
At the same time, continued the speak
er, it was impossible to compel the fam
ilies of the victims to renounce the In
demnities spontaneously offered them.
The Italian Government, continued the
Foreign Minister, would ask for no indem
nities as the price of the blood of ita citi
zens. â¢ but it would not object if indemni
ties were given to the relatives of the de
ceased.
The Italian Government acted upon the
principle, concluded Signor Prinetti, that
Italy should insure her subjects abroad
with an effective but not arrogant protec
tion, which was inspired by the senti
ments of civilization, legality and modera
tion which she had hitherto exhibited in
her relations with foreign states in which
her sons had met with open and fruitful
hospitality.

Governor of Massachusetts Likely to
Succeed Gage.
WASHINGTON, ' Dec. 20.â Winthrop
Murray Crane, Governor of Massachu
setts, was the first caller at the White
House this morning, arriving at 7:45 and
taking breakfast with the President. Gov
ernor Crane by a singular coincidence
came from, New York on the same train
with \ Secretary Gage, leaving there at
midnight. . The Governor went to tne
Arlington HoteU where he registered in
an . lnflnitesimally small hand. "W. H.
Crane, Dalton, Mass." Then he called a.
cab and disappeared. The early bird
catches the worm, it is said, and the sig
nificance of Crane's early breakfast at
the White House is that he may have
caught there the Secretaryship of the
Treasury, If not for himself , then for
some other good New England Republi
can.
President Koosevelt has determined to
go to that part of the country for a suc
cessor to Secretary Gage, and for several
days. he has been "asking New England
Congressmen about Governor Crane and
about other New Englanders -who have
special- qualifications as business men and
financiers. In the caurse of his search
* . â 
the name of Governor Crane was sug
gested Or came to him, and he was at
once Invited to Washington. The result
of the early conference was that Gover

the question of whether he could so ar
range his political and business affairs as
to accept the Secretaryship of the Treas
ury if it should be formally offered to
him.
TORTURE SQUAW
OVER FLAMES
Idaho Indians Guilty of
Practicing Horrible
Cruelty.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
LEWISTON, Idaho, Dec. 20.â Horrible
in its details was a story of cruelty re
lated to the local officials to-day by a
squaw who was found on a trail near Ue
Indian camp at Lap.wai and brought to
this city yesterday. Apparently she was
suffering from frozen feet, and the In
dians wtio brought her to the County Jail
and left her there declared she was in
sane: AH night long the poor creature
shrieked in agony. To-day an interpreter
was engaged and through him the
squaw's story was obtained.
Because they believed she was possessed
of an evil spirit the Indians of the Lap
wai village, she said, demanded that she
leave. When she refused they tied her
hand and foot and held her feet over o
fire. The terrible pain unseated her rea
son temporarily and: she knows nothing
of what occurred afterward until she
found herself cared for in the County
Jail. Apparently she was carried out of
camp and left on the trail, where other
Indians afterward picked her up and
brought her to this city. . It is believed
the party that conveyed her hither was
acting under orders from the head men
of the village. . . , â -? ..
Physicians who examined the squaw to
day say that the condition oZ her feet in
dicates burning-. An Investigation is he
ing conducted by the county officials.

mittee on Expositions, made the first ad
dress. He said in part:
The importance of this exposition as a
means of educating ourselves and other nations
in the knowledge of those things that make
us the foremost nation of the globe cannot be
overestimated. It will be important and bene
ficial, too, in that it will- give to 'our social
and industrial fabric a moral and an intellec
tual significance that Is the pnde of America
and the envy of the world. One of its chief
values, however, will be in tho opportunity for
strengthening and cultivating: more intimate
social and Industrial relations between the
States and between the .United States and for
eign countries.
Another great object to be accomplished, one
that transcends all others, is in the fact that
this exposition is intended and will commemo
rate the first centennial of the greatest inter
national event in our history, the one that
marks the beginning of that national policy
that ha* made us a world power, without which
our present industrial and political supremacy
could never have been achieved.
World's Fair Commissioner John Allen
of Mississippi, who was to have followed
Mr. Tawney with an address, was de

to a prediction of the world's fair success.

the authorities having set aside more than 606
acres of Forest Park and an adjacent area
havtns been secured makes & total of r.early
120U acres. Included In the fair grounds are
tne buildings and grounds of "Washington Uni
versity, valued at Jtt.OUO.OCO.
The principal buildings ior the exposition are
to be arranjeed accordi-iiK to a symmetrical
plan, somewhat in the form of a fan, la the
northeastern part of the Forest Park sec
tion. The principal vista will be that from
the main entrance, lookinjr southwest some
three-quarters of a mile to the art palactw
which will crown an eminence Â«O feet abovtT^
the general level of the main buildings. This
avenue will be 600 feet wide, and there will
be a transverse avenue 300 feet in width.
Fronting upon these beautiful avenues will be
the manufactures and liberal arts buildings,
the educational and social economy buildings,
the mines, machinery, electricity and trans
portation buildings. These structures will vary
in size from seven to fifteen acres ia area. A
broad lasroon will encircle two of the most
central buildings. The palace of art upon tho
hill at the southwest will be permanent and
with ita by-bulldinjrs will cost about $l,(Xi0.-
W)O The general style of the buildings will be
that of the renaissance, with a liberal use of
colonnade effects upon all exteriors. The slope
from the palace of art to the lagoons will afford
an opportunity for cascade effects of a moat
beautiful character. The Government build
ings and pavilions devoted to special purposes
will occupy a. position upon the elevation
southeast, but conveniently situated with ref
erence to the main group of exposition build
ings. Southward from the main group and
beyond the palace of art ia a considerable
space, which will bs devoted to State and for
eign buildings. Among these will be that of
Missouri, which is to be permanent, costing
about $^00,000. The largest building of tha â¢
exposition will be devoted to asriculture ami
its allied Industries. It will stand west of the
main group and cover an area of more than
thirty-two acres. The new buildings of "Wash
ington University, which are nearly ready for
oeeupancy, will be tha administrative head
quarters aa well as serve other purposes.
The world's fair will embrace in Its scope
everv department of human activity. It is the
purpose of the management to have It portray
civilization in ita most advanced state. The
exhibits are to be divided into the following
main departments: . Education and social
economy: art. liberal arts; manufactures, ma
chinery, electricity: transportation: agricul
ture and food products; horticulture, vitleu'^
ture and arboriculture; fish and game; mlnlr mm
end metallurgy; forestry; anthropology; ath- [
letics Throughout all departments, bo far as
it may be done, the exhibit* will show proceses
of manufacture and the development of tlie
article* displayed. There will be numerous
complete installations of manufacturing plants,
and life and activity will characterize the ex
position and give it a unique individuality.
Sources of raw materials will in most in
stances be 'shown, and step by step the work
of prcducinar articles of utility and value will
be rortiayed.
An effort will be made to have every country
as well as every department of human activ
ity adequately represented. Commissioner*
have been appointed and have gone upon their
missions to the various countries of the world
which have accepted the invitation to partici
pate, with the view of assisting so far as pos
sible In the collection of exhibits. They carry
with tbemi a full knowledge of the plan and
scope of the exposition and are empowered to
co-operate with the representatives of tho
various rovernmenta In bringing together dis
plays that will show in a comprehensive way
the natural resources of the different coun
tries, their various lines of manufacture, their
system? of education and other public institu
tions by which they are making an advance
ment in civilization.
The management of the exposition is In the
hands of a board of ninety-three directors, rep
resenting the financial, professional, manufac
turing, mercantile and railway Interests of St.
Louis. The president of the company is the
Hon. David R. Francis, formerly Mayor of the
city. Governor of Missouri and Secretary of the

Disputes Between Capital
and Labor Will Be
Adjusted.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â Senator Han
na, chairman of the committee of thirty
six appointed at the capital-labor confer
ence in New York, was at the White
House to-day and talked most earnestly
ef the results of the conference.
"I consider the conference," said he,
"the greatest step ever taken for the
epeedy settlement of disputes arising be
tween labor and capital. This organiza
tion, which has come to stay, was an
evolution which was naturally preceded
by the organization of labor, which also
has come to stay, and the concentration
of the interests of the two sides into the
hands of a comparatively few individuals
will make for the best interests of both.
"The public must not get the idea that
â¢we are to recognize everything relating
to the condition of labor and capital, or
that the joint committee Is to undertake
erbitration by compulsion. In fact, we are
opposed to compulsory arbitration. We
believe we can accomplish more by get
ting into closer touch and contact with
labor.
"The first step will be to establish a re
lationship between the two Interests, and
this will serve as a foundation to work
on. While we do not expect that there
will be no strikes, they will be minimized
es a. result of the conciliation and arbi
tration policy."
Hanna said he expected the committee
to meet during the winter to adopt by
laws and elaborate etill further the
scheme of arbitration.

The report of President Thomas heart
ily indorsed the views of President Roose
velt on the questions of conserving the
waters and preserving the forests of the
West, but regretted that the association
had been unable to accomplish but little
In the past year, owing to the action of
Governor Gage in having vetoed the ap
propriation bill passed by the last Legis
lature to allow the expenditure of money
to carry on the work of saving the waters
and timbers of California.
Last year the association heard with joy
of the action of the Federal Government
in pledging itself to expend an equal sum
with the State in taking the preliminary
steps to erect water reservoirs and safe
guard the forests. The Government was
prepared to expend $175,000 on the work
ana the State Legislature voted a simi
lar amount- Governor . Gage, however,
declined to sign the appropriation bill, but
allowed one to receive his consent pro
viding for the purchase of the Big Basin
timber lands, which, however, has since
been exposed as a job on the part of cer
tain lumbermen.
Resent Actions of Governor Gage.
The men who have worked hard to con
serve the waters and preserve the for
ests of the State feel strong resentment
toward Gage for his action, and, as one
of the delegates said yesterday, ''if Gage
seeks re-election or anything at the hands
of the people thousands will give him' a.
â¢package' of negative . votes."
A large number of resolutions presented
at the morning session of the association
were referred to a special committee ap
pointed by President Thomas as follows:
\V. E. Willis (chairman). W. E. Smythe.
A. F. Briggs. Scipio Craig and D. W.
Thomas.
Treasurer Dohrmann presented his re
port, showing that since the formation of
the association the sum of $23,639 80 had
been received from members, and the
expenses for surveys, etc., were $22,773 84,
leaving a balance on hand of $S65 96. After
deducting for contracts on hand and add
ing uncalled for reserves the total bal
ance is $752 04.
After the receipt of the finacial report
Uic meeting was adjourned until 2 p. m..
when the committee on resolutions was
to present its report.
When the association assembled In the
afternoon President Thomas stated that
a further adjournment would be taken
until 3:30 o'clock, as the committee on
resolutions had not finished Its duties.
The members assembled at the desig
nated hour and listened attentively to the
report of the committee on resolutions.
Chairman Willis stated that the report
was a unanimous one and embodied all
the resolutions presented at the mornins
session. W. E. Smythe read the report,
which was as follows:
Policy Is Fully Outlined.
In accordance with the suggestion of Ppeel
dent William Thomas of this association, we
congratulate President Roosevelt upon his
espousal of the cause of forest preservation and
irrigation development, and gratefully Indorse
the sentiment contained In his recent message:
"The forest and water problems are perhaps
the most vital Internal questions of the United
States."
We congratulate California and the West
upon the President's vigorous championship of
a cause which will give to the country more
homes and wealth than any other economic
movement now before the people. We recog
nize in the President's message something more
than the formal indorsement of a popular cause
which, though wholly non-political, had the
support of both great parties in the last Presi
dential campaign. He has outlined a pro
gramme of action which is comprehensive,
statesmanlike and equally suited to the needs
of the nation and of the several States. We.
therefore, gladly accept his leadership In our
dual effort to foster national progress and State
improvement by a policy of co-operation be
tween the Government at Washington and the
Government at Sacramento.
We specifically indorse the following extracts
from the message relating to forestry:
"Forest protection Is not an end of Itself; H
is a. means to increase and sustain the re
sources of our country and the Industries which
depend upon them. The preservation of our
forests is an imperative business necessity.
"The preuent diffusion of responsibility (be
tween the General Land Office, the Geological
Survey and the Bureau of Forestry) is bad
from every standpoint. It prevents that effec
tive co-operation between the Government and
the men who utilize the resources of the re
serves, without which the Interests of both

THE APPRAISER
Federal Official at New
York Is Removed by
Roosevelt.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2O.-It was an
nounced at the White House this after
noon that the President had removed Ap
praiser Wakeman of New York on the
recommendation of. Secretary Gage.
Wakeman, It is said, wrote to the Presi
dent attacking Secretary Gage. The. Pres
ident refused to entertain the charges or
overlook the offensive character of the
letter.
Later the official announcement was
made at the White House that George W.
Whitehead, late Collector of Customs at
Porto Rico, had been appointed to suc
ceed Wakeman. No further announcement
was made. Secretary Gage declined to
make public Wakeman's letter. - â¢

chandise at Boston, has been ordered to

praiser's office pending 1 the nomination of
Whitehead to succeed * Wakeman, which

must suffer. The scientific bureaus generally
should be put under the department of Agri
culture.
"The forest reserves will Inevitably be of
still greater use In the future than in the past.
Additions should be made to them whenever
practicable, and their usefulness should be In
creased by a thoroughly business-like manage
ment. â  â¢ ,
'â¢The forest reserves should be set apart for
ever for the use and benefit of our people as a
whole, and not sacrificed to the short-sighted
greed of a few."
Applying the logic of these recommendations
to our local situation, we would urge upon the
President the following administrative acts in
the Interest of California:
1. That the forest reservations in this State
be increased as speedily as possible, especially
at the headwaters of our principal streams.
2. That the Chief Forester of the United
States be instructed to Investigate and report
upon the expediency of State legislation in the
Interest of the preservation of the forested
areas of California by the application of scien
tific principles to the removal of ripened timber
and the preservation of growing timber. Fur
thermore, that he shall advise as to whether it
may become necessary for the State to purchase
and replant denuded areas as a means of pro
tecting watersheds already Impaired by waste
ful lumbering.
We request our Senators and our Represent
atives in Congress to urge the enactment of
euch legislation as will result in the Imme
diate reservation of all Government forest
lands within the State of California
We also declare that the public Interest Im
peratively requires the enactment of such
legislation as will compel all -persons cutting
timber upon lands of this State, whether held
In private ownership or not, to adopt every
reasonable and practicable precaution for pre
venting the outbreak and spread of nres which
will destroy or endanger the young growth of
forest trees upon such lands.
We further declare that It Is a matter of
pressing importance to determine how far it
may be expedient to apply In this State the
experience gained in older countries In the sys
tematic and scientific selection of ripened tim
ber only for cutting, while preserving young
and growing trees' from indiscriminate waste
and destruction.
The President's recommendations In favor of
national construction of storage reservoirs and
of large main canals as a means of reclaim
ing and opening to settlement the arid public
domain meet with our hearty approval We
agree with him when he says:
Great storage works are necessary to equal
ize the flow of streams 'and to save the flood
waters. Their construction has been conclu
cively shown to be an undertaking too vast
for private effort."
And we further agree with the statement
contained in his letter to the Irrigation Con
gress of 1900: â  .
It Is not possible, and If It were possible it
would not be wise to have this storage work
done merely through private ownership."
We hall with satisfaction these declarations
by the President of the United States that
works of Irrigation are essentially public utili
ties and ought to be constructed, owned and
will be sent to the Senate on its recon
vening January 6. Wakeman will vacate
nis office to-morrow. â 'â¢

administered by the people and for the people.
With equal heartiness we commend, the fol- ;
lowing quotations from the message, showing
the President's familiarity with conditions in
the West and his conclusions based thereon ;
"The distribution of the water, the division
of the streams among: lrrisators, should be
left â  to the eettlers themselves, In" conformity
with tha State laws and, without Interference
with those laws or with vested rights. The
policy of the National Government should be
to aid irrigation in the several States .. and
Territories in such "manner as will enable the
people in the local communities to help them
selves, and as will stimulate needed reforms
In the State laws and regulations governing
irrigation.
"Whoever controls a stream practically con
trols the land It renders productive, and the
doctrine Of private ownership of water apart
from land cannot prevail, without causing en
during wrong. The recognition of such owner-
Ship which has -been permitted to grow up In
the arid regions should give way to a more
enlightened and larger recognition of the rights
of the public In the control and disposal of
the public water supplies. \ ;
"In the arid States the only right to water
which should be recognized Is that of use. In
Irrigation this right should attach to the land
reclaimed and be Inseparable therefrom.
Granting perpetual water right to others than
users without compensation to the public is
open to all the objections which apply to giv
ing away perpetual franchises to the public
utilities of cities.
"We are dealing with a new and momentous
question In the pregnant years while Institu
tions are forming, and what we do will affect
not only the present but future generations.
"Our aim should be not simply to reclaim

their legislation and administration show
themselves nt to receive it." â¢ !
If.lt.be unwise to permit private capital to
construct storage works for the reclamation
of lands now publicly owned, but hereafter to
pass into the proprietorship of millions of
American citizens, it follows that it 13 equally
unwise for private capital to build storage
works in California for the reclamation of
lands, already owned and occupied by private
individuals, but destined to be subdivided and
disposed of when irrigation is supplied.
This association neither asks nor expects
national aid In the reclamation of the private
estates of California. It believes, on the other
hand, that this is a problem which must be
solved by the commonwealth itself, and to the
solution of which its genius is entirely equal.
If It be true, as the President says, that on
the public lands "the doctrine of private own
ership of water apart from land cannot pre
vail without causing- enduring wrong:," it Is
equally true that "enduring wrong" would fol
low the application of that doctrine to private
lands which must look for irrigation to a
source beyond their own control.
As a means of carrying out the recommenda
tions of the President, and of shaping the
laws and institutions of California In conform
ity jwith those which his administration pro
poses, we favor the following course of action:
To Reform the Water Code.
' 1. The water laws of California should be
reformed by the next Legislature. As it would
be impracticable for the Legislature itself, In*
a single brief session, to frame- and enact a
measure of this importance, we repeat our
declaration of a year ago in favor of the crea
tion of a commission by this association, to
consist of the following persons: One expert
to-be chosen from the Department of Agricul
ture;-one expert from the United States Geo
logical Survey; the presidents of the University
of California and Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity; one professor of engineering from each
of said . universities, and three practiced law
yers to be named by the president of this
association. â 
â  2. AVe commend to the earnest consideration
of said commission the report of the United
States Irrigation Commission, entitled "Irri
gation Investigations in California." recently
issued by the Department of Agriculture.
3. The money necessary to meet the ex
penses of this unpaid commission shall be
raised by the executive committee and ad
visory . council, by an appeal to the members
of this association and to the commercial in
terests of the State which are vitally interest
ed in the wise solution of the irrigation ques
tion. â "".-â  '
â 4. The measures framed by this commis
sion shall, after being passed upon by the an
nual â¢ meeting of this association In Decem
ber, 1902. be presented ! to the Legislature and
urged for immediate passage.
. State . and National , Co-operation.
S.- We reiterate our former demand for a
generous appropriation by the State to be ex
pended in collaboration with the United States
Geological . Survey and Irrigation Investigations
of the Department of Agriculture, . and we
work for him who did not come to him
voluntarily. He gave Stevenson's testi
mony a flat denial and said that hid
brother-in-law lied when he quoted
Dowie's sister as saying, "Thank God. wo
are free from that tyrannical rule now. 1 *'
Admissions were drawn out that Dowie
had paid Stevenson $85,000 on account, but
that $50,000 of this was at once turned
over to Dowie's sister, Mrs. Stevenson;
who at' once gave It to Dowie, It Is said,
for stock - in the lace industries. Thirty
thousand dollars also was given to Frank
\voodward, but Dowie Insisted that was
for .bills Stevenson 'had contracted.
attorney then drew from Dowie
that after -parting with his entire busi
ness, including lace machinery, patterns
and stock,- Stevenson got out of the bar
gain â  only ' $5000. ' Then Attorney Reeves
tried to show that the entire liabilities of
the. Zlon lace industries would aggregate
$1,168,000,. Including stock, dividends, etc.,
but" Dowie said the conjecture I was fool
ish.'. The direct question was then put to
Dowie whether he believed that: he was
Elijah 'the prophet, to which he replied
that the .-was willing to express his views,
but that they were already on record.' j

shall renew our efforts to secure the enact
ment Into law of the bill having that end in
view which was passed by the last Legislature,
but. unfortunately, did not receive the signa
ture of the executive. But we favor this ap
propriation only upon the express condition
that all reservoir sites and artesian basins dis
covered on public land snail be held for pub
lic works to be hereafter constructed by Stats
or nation, rather than turned over to private
individuals- or corporations.
6. We are opposed to the storage of the
flood waters of the State by private enterprise,
because such a policy would foster and en
trench the system of private water monopoly
which, in the language of President Roosevelt,
"cannot prevail without causing enduring
wrong." We believe all such storage works,
together with main canals, should be con
structed, maintained and managed under State
administration. This policy Is practically iden
tical with that proposed by the President for
public lands, under which the nation provides
the capital and management necessary for the
creation of works, while "the cost of con
struction should as far as possible be repaid
by the land reclaimed."
7. The construction of large storage works
under any plan, on streams already In active
use, will unavoidably conflict to some extent
with existing canala. -While we declare our
unalterable conviction that in all such cases
the public interests must be treated as para
mount, we nevertheless favor the fullest pro
tection of vested rights now recognized by our
laws and judicial decisions.
Thanks to National Administration.
The thanks of this association are hereby ten
dered to the United States Geological Survey
and to the irrigation Investigations of the De
partment of Agriculture for the efficient work
done and the admirable and instructive reports
issued by them, respectively, and for what has
been accomplished in collaboration with this
association during the year 1000. Our thanks
are also extended to the Secretaries of the
Interior and of Agriculture who made such
collaboration possible. Â» We hereby pledge our
support to any further work which, may be
undertaken by the two departments of the
Federal Government above referred to in the
State of California,
We favor the creation of a Bureau of Irri
gation, fully equipped and supported with ap
propriations adequate to its importance, said
bureau to be under the Department of Agri
culture.
We Join with others of our fellow citizens
In the expression of an earnest desire that the
President of the United States may soon be
able to visit California and thus furnish us
with an opportunity to show our deep appre
ciation of his great service to California and

Officers Are Elected.
The report was adopted- amid enthusi
asm. The association then proceeded to
the election of officers for the ensuing
year. There was.no contest in the elec
tion,, which resulted as follows:
William Thomas, president; N. P. Chlpman,
vice president; Arthur R. Briggs, first vice
president; J. P. Lippincott, second vice presi
dent; F. W. Dohrmann, treasurer; T. C.

Thomas, Frank Soule and A. J. PUlsbury.
President Thomas was greeted with
cheers when he thanked the members for
rts-electlngr him and pledged himself to
work hard for the association until It had
accomplished its objects.
The following were appointed as the ex
ecutive committee by the president:
Chief Justice W. H. Beatty. President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the State University.
Frank J. Symraes, W. H. Mills. Judge J. D.
Works of Los Angeles and E. B. Willis of Sac
ramento. *
A recess was then taken until evening.
A I the evening session the delegates and
ladies who attended listened to addresses
delivered by Professor J. M. \Vilson and
S F.. Klefer.
Professor Wilson spoke on "The Results
of Irrigation Investigation" and Keller's
subject was "The Extent of the Destruc
tion of Our Forests and the Remedies
Therefor."
Professor Wilson told of his investiga
tions in Yolo County as examples of what
could be found in the entire. State. He
gave a history of howthe exclusive water
rights of Cash Creek had been obtained
in pioneer days and the difficulties that
beset all who tried to use the waters com
ing from Clear Lake.
The address s was illustrated by many
atereoptlcon views and was an able argu
ment In favor of the conservation of the
waters of the State, which the speaker
saiJ were either sold at bi& prices to con
sumers or allowed to go to waste in thÂ©
sloughs.
The facts and figures presented by
Kelfer showed a terrible menace to the
forests of California at the hands of the
lumberman. Millions of feet of timber
were being destroyed by the log cutter's
ax and by fire andqio steps, -were being
taken to preserve young trees or to re
place those cut down.
Keifer also showed that there were
msmy opportunities for the building of
natural reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and that the time â was close at
hand when the Federal Government and
the State of California would take such
steps as necessity required to save the
waters and forests from ruthless waste
and destruction.
Here are two picturesof our $1.30 hatsâ the Derby and the I

Members of the Federal

Farewell.
MANILA, Dec. 20.-Over 4000 members
of the Federal partv called on Governor
Taft to-day to bid him farewell and to
wish him a safe return. â¢ The Governor.
reclining 1 on a lounge, addressed 150 of the
most prominent of his visitors, saylne
that he was honored by their presence.
The organization, he added, had done so
much toward bringing about peace and
giving the country a stable party that it
augured more lor tne success of Ameri
can labors than anything else during the
recent critical times.
The reports circulated in the United
States, founded on incidents connected
with the war in Batangas Province and
the island of Samar. the Governor said,
tend to convey a wrong impression of the
situation, which Is really hopefuL
Through its officers, the constabulary and
the provincial governments, besides 850
teachers, 'the commission had excellent
means of acquiring .information in the
organized provinces, and it considers that
there never was a time when there has
been so much real ground for hopeful
ness and encouragement In regard to the
attitude of the Filipino people toward the
civil Government.
The military disaster in Samar had
created an unfounded feeling of uneasi
ness concerning the condition of the peo
ple of the rest of the archipelago. The
war in Batangas and Samar, stirred up
by misguided men, furnished the only
obstacle to obtaining liberal legislation
on the part of Congress.
Continuing, the Governor Tsald that he
would return here. He liked the Filipinos
and regretted leaving at this particular
time. But it was a comfort to know that
the duties of the office were In the hands
of Vice Governor "Wright, an able lawyer,
who sympathized deeply with the b^t
hopes of the people, in conclusion the
Governor said he expected to be back be
fore May and he hoped to have the pleas
ure of presenting the Federal party's
memorial to the President.
Civil government will be restored In the

and every available horse is pressed into
service as a hunter for the time being.
The typical Irish hunter may be seen side
by side with the pony cob, which for that
day Is relieved of his everyday duty to
provide a mount for one of the sportinir
farmer's juveniles.
Thousands now in the sear and yellow
leaf of manhood will, in happy memory
hark back to those hunting days of their
boyhood. The fox hunt is well patronized
on St. Stephen's day, as ali Horsemen are

coated animals. Hospitality is the watch
word and all are made welcome. The

GUNMEN ENJOY
SEASON'S FINEST
DUCK SHOOTING
Legal Limit of Fifty Birds
Is Secured by Many Men
at Mount Eden and Suisun
All conditions for duck shooting -ware
favorable last Sunday, with the result
that on all the preserves near this city
limit bags of fifty birds were the rule and
not the exception as heretofore. The
sportsmen enjoyed the best day's shoot-
Ing of the season.
The five members of the Spooney Gun
Club who shot over their Mount Eden
preserve had sensational sport. They
pledged one another to secrecy as to the
â euccess of their shbot. but when, five men
return home, each laden with fifty ducks,
it Is difficult to conceal their good for
tune from less successful sportsmen. The
members who were on hand to enjoy the
rare snort were Dr. E. .N. Short,, W.
Whitebead, L. R. ' , Larzalere, . George
Morse and Phil Bekeart. The bag was a
mixed one of "cans," sprig, spoonbills
and mallards. The cold morning kept the
birds flying. The fresh water ponds, over
which most of the shooting was done,
were covered with a thin coating of ice
when the shooters commenced operations
in the morning at sunrise.
With a continuation of the present cold
weather the shooting to-morrow should
be as high class as that of last Sunday
on both San Pablo Bay and down Mount
Eden way. Teal are to be seen in all the
small sloughs in countless thousands. /
Up at the Suisun preserve of the Field
and Tule Club the shooting on Sunday
was of the highest class. F. H. Bushnell,
Dr. A.T. -Derby and H. B. "Hosmer each
secured fifty ducks.- All the members had
a successful shoot, the total number of
birds killed being more than, 250. On
Wednesday ( eleven members, headed by
F. H. Bushnell and H. B. Hosmer, en
joyed another great shoot. In* all they
killed 2SS ducks, chiefly sprig, spooney and
teal.
Tom Casey killed eighteen ducks at
Black Point on Sunday.
Mr. Wyman and two friends killed sixty
ducks at Tubbs Island.
Bert Patrick secured thirty-nine "cans '
on the preserve of the Marln County Gun
Club. He had as guest H. Van Norden.
Tne flight of birds continued up to 11:30
o'clock. â¢
.Donald McRea secured a limit bag of
fifty ducks on the Sherman Island pre
serve.
George Erget and Ed Bowen secured
seventeen ducks near San Pablo.
William Price, also shooting in that
neighborhood, killed .. fourteen, mostly
"cans." ; .
Frank Schultz shot â¢ near 'Mount Eden
and bagged eighteen ducks.
Mr. Guyatt and two friends went to
Livermore in quest "of quail. The joint
bag was sixty-seven birds. They could
readily have secured the limit if time per
mitted, as the birds were there In abund
ance.
- The Lincoln Gun Club will hold a blue
rockshoot to-morrow for turkeys on its
grounds, Alameda Point. There will bo
mixed matches, freezeout and five, , ten
and fifteen bird races, concluding with a

SPEEDY HARES
ENLIVEN GAME
OF COURSING
Lengthy Trials Prove ,the
Rule in the Big Stakes
7 Being Run at Union Park
Not since coursing became a popular
sport in California has its followers been
treated to such hard fought and lengthy
trials as those that have resulted during
the stakes of the past two months at
Union Coursing Park. At this time of the
year coursing trials, as a rule, are quick
ly ended. The hares i heretofore have
shown a disposition to slow down and
were no match in speed nor cleverness for
the greyhounds. During the winter
months the official scores are recorded in
small figures, the course being ended aft
er a short run up, a. turn or two and a
kill. Year m and year out at this time
a course" would be finished generally be
fore the hare could get half way up the
field â¢ and the contestants going to . the
slips for the final would reach that point
without having done what could be term
ed a warming up sprint. In trials of that
class cleverness in a courser seldom fig
ured, the dog showing the speed from the
slips usually being returned the winner.
Then, too, the relief dog was forgotten
as stake after stake would be run with
out the time limit being approached, in
any course.
The unlooked for speed In the strong
hares that cross the fields in these days
has changed things a bit and the usual
conditions are reversed. Now instead of
a short, hurried course the dogs are tak
en all over the field and as exhibition
courses the spectators, judging from their
cheering and the applause they bestow,
vote the trials a decided success.
Instead of the trainer walking his entry
up and down the paddock to pass away
time and waiting anxiously for the next
go the man who handles the courser in
a stake can be found doing his best to

PARK CHAMPIONS
TO PLAY TENNIS
ON CLUB COURTS
Will Measure Skill With
the California Players in
the Christmas Tournament
The Christmas tennis tournament to be
commenced to-morrow on the California
Club courts promises to be by far the
largest and most important held during
the year. It will be an open class singles
event, and a heavy entry list is expected.
As much of the tournament as possible
will be played off to-morrow. The final!?
between the classes will be finished on
Christmas. The players will 'be divided
Into five classes unless George Whitney
decides not to play, in which case R, M.
Whitney will probably go Into the first
clasa at "half flftee'n" below scratch:
C. Dunlap, ex-champion of ' Tennessee
and present champion of the Park; Harry
Young and Twiggs, who are easily the
best play era. in the park, will enter the
tournament. Their presence will add
greatly to the interest in the event. Dun
lap has beaten all the crack players in
the . Park with ease, and they figure he
will stand a good chance of beating many
of the cracks of the California Tennis
Club. '.
It was the intention of the tournament
committee to place these players in' the
second class. Dunlap and Routh prefer
to go In the first class, however, and it
win be interesting to note how they com
pare with Grant. Smith, Drummond Mc-
Gavin, Brown ana Collier.
Dunlap is not accustomed to playing on
asphalt courts and consequently will be
handicapped in his play. He employs a
cut stroke that is wonderf ul for its ac
curacy. This style of game is more suit
ed to turf, which causes the ball to
bounce faster. â 
Harry Routh, the other Park expert
wno will play in the first class, has had
considerable Eastern experience, and al
though somewhat out of practice plays
a good game. In the championship of
1899 he played a close match with Paul
Selby, the runner-up.
The other four men from the Park win
go In the second class and should give a
good account of themselves. -Walker of
Chicago is probably the best of these and
should come near winning class honors
The class in which the best playing will
be brought out and in which most of the
interest Is centered .Is the first class The
following men will be in this class* Fred
*-rown, J. D. MacGavin, \W B Collie
'ti.W. Crowell, Merle Johnson, C Dun
lap, : Harry Routh, S.j H. Adams, Harry
Wlehe and Grant Smith. The honors in
fhis class .will probably go to MacGavin
Brown, or Smith. -Those- who stand the
best chance in the second class are Frank
Stringham Ray Cornell, Chet Smith and
Sidney Salisbury. - In the third class
Charles Kuehn, Harry. Gbrham. Jack
Gibson and Herbert Schmidt are easJiv
the best. - y
William Frost of the Colquecot Club
Oakland, has entered the tournament and
Will be in the second or third class â¢
There is a possibility of Robert *Fat1o
playing. He is the champion of' Santa
Clara County, and it will be difficult for
the best of the second-class men to- dte

SCOTCH BOWLING
IS REVISED ON
THE PARK GREEN
A Rink Has Been Provided
and Matches Played Reg
ularly by Its Enthusiasts
The ancient game of Scottish bowling
has been transplanted to this city and
is being played regularly in Golden Gate
Park. The game i3 played on a turf rtak
20 feet wide and 126 feet long. At pres
ent the club members are playing on the
easterly end of the park recreation
grounds, but a special rink Is being pre
pared immediately In front of the former
music stand and adjoining the tennis
courts on the south.
The bowls are about sixteen and a half
inches In circumference and weigh about
three and a half pounds. They are not
round, and therein lies the point of the
game. They must be rolled at an angle.
This la the test of the player's skill, as
ho must determine what .the required an
gle is at which the bowl is to be rolled.
The game is a healthful, outdoor pas
time into which the player can place as
much energy as he desires. After rolling
his bowl he can follow it leisurely or can
run with It, as players often do, urging
the Inanimate object to stop at the desired
place. â¢
â¢ The first match game between teams of
the San Francisco Scottish Bowling Club
and the Oakland Club will be played on
the recreation grounds. Golden Gate Park,
on Christmas day, between 11 o'clock
and 3.

bowl regularly every Saturday at 2 p. m.
and many representative men are to be
seen on the green. The officers of the

FOR THE FIRST TIME IX THE PRIZE RING.
GEORGE GARDNER, the Lowell
boxer, made it three straight with
Kid Carter last night In Me
chanics' Pavilion. He defeated
the latter after eight desperate
rounds, in which Carter took an incredible
amount of punishment and came back
fighting hard when the spectators least
exj>ected itâ
Gardner landed a knock-out punch at
the end of the sixth round and Carter was
practically defeated at that stage of the
proceedings. After six seconds the gong
wysounded the end of the round and his at
tendants carried the dazed man to his cor
ner. He was brought around sufficiently
In the minute interval to face Gardner
again. He went back fighting, but the
end of this round proved p. repetition
of the previous one.
This time he was down eight seconds

when the gong saved him, an.d he was
again carried to his corner limp and help
less. His remarkable recuperative powers
and his gameness again brought him
around, and he faced his hard-hitting op
ponent as though nothing had happened.
Gardner saw victory in sight and rushed
at him. To the surprise of the spectators
Carter landed a stiff left to body and right
to head as though he was just clearing for
action. â¢ .
Gardner was the fresher and knocked
the "Kid" to the floor with a right upper
cut. The defeated man took nine seconds
on the floor. When he stood up again it
â was only to receive a shower of blows
which sent him down a second time. He
remained down eight seconds, and, al
though dazed' and practically helpless, he
again staggered to his feet. This time
Gardner steadied himself and sent a
crashing right to the body, which left
Carter helpless until he was counted out.
Carter a Dangerous Opponent.
Carter showed himself the most danger
ous man in the ring to-day, as, no matter
how cruelly beaten he was, he always had
the power to deliver a punch which would
put out an opponent.
As for Gardner he will find it difficult
to induce any middle-weight to enter the
ring with him. Harry Corbett ventured'
the opinion that with fifteen pounds more
weight he would prove more than a match
for Champion Jeffries. He is the mildest
mannered chap in the world out of the
ring, but once inside the ropes he is a
marvelous fighting machine. He has all
the arts and artilices of the fighter and
never stops. The blow with Which he did
all the execution last night was a rig-nt
uppercut while in a clinch. Carter was
unable to block this and it did terrible
execution. In the first two rounds Gard
ner went in head first at Carter, and if
he missed with his hands he scored with
his head. After a time Carter and , his
seconds saw the play and appealed to
Referee Jim McDonald to stop it, which
he did.
When the men went together for the
first time Gardner at once tried a right
shift which he has been practicing as
siduously. It .worked to perfection and
he shot hi3 right across at Carter, scor
ing at once. For a moment it seemed the
flght would end then and there. Carter's
tremendous vitality was not to be sapped
by any one blow, however, and he showed
no ill effects from this one.
Before the round was over the specta
tors at the ringside were predicting it
would not go three rounds. Gardner
seemed to outclass his opponent in this
round, although Carter was not idle,
sending in some stinging right-hand blows
to the body. Gardner proved a master
hand at blocking and manyjfof Carter's
terrible blows never reached the point for
which they were aimed.
Gardner Slows Down.
In the second round Gardner started
proceedings, his object at the opening of
each round being apparently to intimidate
Carter. Carter was not to be denied, and
landed two hard rights to the body. Gard
ner landed right and left and followed
with two hard lefts to the body. Gardner
missed a hard right and left swing. He
landed repeatedly on the body and the
"Kid" showed signs of distress. The
"Kid" landed what seemed like a hard
right to the head, but it glanced off Gard
ner's shoulder. It was in this round Gard
ner was accused of butting with his head.
In the third round Gardner slowed down
noticeably in his pace, and for a time it
was thought his hands had given way.
Carter was full of fight but did not seem
to trouble Gardner, who protected him
self cleverly.
Near the end of the fourth round Gard
ner sent in a short left jolt to the body,
which looked for a moment as though it
would end the flght. Instead of stopping
Carter, however, he came back fighting.
Gardner again worked the right shift, but
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1901.
did not make the desired connection with
Carter's jaw.
Carter opened proceedings In the fifth
â with a hard right swing to the head.
Gardner came back with a left to the body
and then stumbled, leaving himself wide
open. Carter was not properly balanced
to take advantage of the opportunity and
lost It. He went at Gardner fiercely for
the remainder of the round. A right to
the head seemed to rattle Gardner slight
ly. They exchanged rights, Carter get
ting the worst of the bargain. Carter
then landed a left to the body and one to
the head, and just at the bell uppercut
Gardner.
Carter made a brilliant showing in the
first half of the sixth. He sent two lefts
to the jaw and followed them with a
right to the body. He staggered Gardner
with two rights to the body. These were
his last effective blows. In a clinch
Gardner's terrible right shot up between
Carter's arms and started him on the
down grade. Gardner then stood and pep
pered him with rights and lefts to the
head as Walcott did in their memorable
fight. Carter finally went down under the
fusilade. The bell saved him and he was
carried to his corner.
He had no defense in the seventh and
his brain must have been in a terrible
whirl. Gardner was over anxious and
missed one cHance for a left swing. When
Carter seemed helpless he turned on his
opponent and plugged in his right to the
body. He took an avalanche of blows and
again came back unexpectedly with a
right to the jaw. Carter went down again
and was again saved by the gong at the
end of the round.
This only meant prolonging the agony.
He took blows which would have felled
an ox and would not stop fighting until
finally his senses deserted him and he
went down a limp, inanimate object on the
floor of the ring.
The ten seconds quickly sped by and the
flght was over. Gardner tried to praise
Carter for his gameness, but all he could
do was to tap him on the shoulder with
his gloved hand.
Tommy Gilfeather and Billy Snallham
fought ten hard rounds to a draw. Snail
ham was the aggressor throughout, but
Gilfeather landed the most effective
blows. He was slow to start, letting
Snallham do all the leading and contented
himself with blocking. After he woke'up
however, he showed a dangerous left but
it went wide of its mark for several
rounds. He finally got the range and
played effectively for Snallham's head.
In the seventh round Snailham stumbled
and his opponent was quick to take ad
vantage of the opening. He ripped a
right to Snailham's stomach, but the lat
ter recovered his balance and landed a
right to the head, knocking Gilfeather
down. Gilfeather had much the better of
the eighth round' and in the ninth did
good execution with his left. Snallham
was in distress but was full of flght. The
tenth round did not change the aspect of
the flght and it was declared a draw
O'Connor Cuts',Out a Fast Pace.
The four-round bout between Jockey
Winnie O'Connor and John Crowe was
declared a draw, although O'Connor did
the most effective work. Crowe, who
looked like a miniature of "Bob" Fitz
slmmons as to build and with a typical
"scrapper's dial" of a face, was full of
fight. The boys went the first two rounds
at half speed, but the remainder of the
bout was full of fighting. O'Connor
walked into a hard right in the third
which drew blood to his nose. In the last
round the jockey cut out a fast pace. He
opened Crowe's left eye and partly shut
oft! his vision. O'Connor was full of
fight throughout the bout. Tim McGrath
seconded him.
Toby Irwin made quick work of Arthur
Granfleld. He knocked him out after
two minutes' fighting In the second round.
The first round was given over to feint
ing. Granfleld landed the only effective

JOSIE G AGAIN DEFEATS BOTANY
AND MAKES A NEW TRACK RECORD
Royalty and 'Bedeck the Only Successful Favorites at Oaklandâ General
Interest in the Match Race To-Day Between Old England, Carrying
the Morris Colors, and San Nicholas, the Burns & Waterhouse Crack
NO faster track could be found in
the country than the onv-at
'. Oakland* In Its present condition
and some very clever stunts, are
performed over It daily. Yester
day Josie G, the i speedy daughter of
Bloomsbury, administered a thorough
beating to Botany, at five furlongs, and
at the same time reduced : the track rec
ord for the distance to 6Â»% seconds. On
some occasions racegoers are 'ditticult to
convince, for, although Josie deteated
Botany only a few-uays back, it wad
considered a scratch' win. For just this
reason in their latest meeting. Botany
had first call m the betting. Glendenning,
pounds below his best form, led to the
stretch with Botany at his heels. How
son, on Josie G, was unfortunate in be
ing bumped and getting a bad break at
the start, but" it mattered little. In the
run home, the filly breezed by Botany.
-winning almost easily by a length. How
son, on the winner, rode a perfect race.
One thing or another . seems to operate
against the happiness and success of
first choices, for : Royalty and Bedeck
were the only ones to land first. The ma
jority of booKS had a most successful day
Little Redfern brought Royalty, favor
ite for the introductory sprint, from far
back in the 'rear, and in a hard drive
led De Capo out a head. The latter horse
was bet on, and had Royalty, not been
pounds the best, could not have won from
the start he received. Almoner ran third.
There seems to be nothing in store for
old Pat Morrlssey of late but bad racing
luck. He ruled a mild favorite for the
Futurity course sprint and was much the
best. Mounce, however, tried . to - come
through on the rail in the stretch and
was cut off half a dozen times. ' After

third to be decided.- Kitty K^lly, a 20 to
1 outsider, cut a big dash out In front, but
was outgamed by Vantine. which - was
well handled by Lee Jackson. Hainault,
with Hoar in the saddle, was crowded in
on the rail the entire route .or he would
have won. â¢
J Gardner's chestnut colt Bedeck nego
tiated the mile in the fifth . event in
1:39%, beating "David S cleverly. Beyond
question the class of the four .starters,
the ring laid 6 to 5 against the Gardner
entry. Lee Jackson on David S tried to
make a runaway affair of it, and while
the outsider made a bold bid O'Connor on
Bedeck moved from last position, win
ning by a length and a half.
Half a dozen of the different entries in
the llnal mile and a sixteenth run looked
to have a chance. On private trials El
Fonse closed a. slight favorite over Ar
tilla but did not get a mark. Jackson
soon had the 10 to 1 shot Diomed showing
first, and the outsider disposed of Artllla
handily at the finish.
Track Notes.

Hainault, entered in the name of Ed

by F. W. Doss, the owner of Bedner. The

ROWING CLUBMEN TALK -
OF AN AMALGAMATION
Oarsmen Ousted From Long: Wharf
May Unite; in* One Strong Or
ganization Under Ne"W Name.
Next Monday night the members of the
Alameda Boat Club will meet in the club
house at the foot of Chestnut street, Ala
meda, to nominate and elect a new board
of officers to serve for the ensuing term
of six months. .The club is' in a flourish
ing condition, both as regards number of
members and finances, the recent annual
entertainment having added a hanusorne
sum to the general fund.
Some time ago it was suggested that the
Pioneer and Ariel rowing clubs, which
then had their boathouses side by Bide on
Long /Wharf, should combine. ' At that
time it was not supposed, the clubs would
have to move away and leave their
houses, and as the Pioneers did not wish
to merge their identity in that of another
club, nothing came of the suggestion.
Now that both clubs have lost their, old
houses and locations, the talk of amalga
mation is heard again. The Pioneers have
some good oarsmen, their senior barge
crew being probably the strongest on the
bay, -but their list of members has fallen
off and it is understood their finances are
none too flourishing. As the Pioneers
would not like to lose their Identity in
the Ariel Club, and the Ariels would not
be willing to sink theirs in the Pioneer
Club, it would be necessary to choose a
new name, which might toe done readily.
Tho Ariels are in a good position now, and
one strong club seems able to include all
the rowing men whose headquarters /wero
for so' many years on Long wharf.
The. installation of the recently elected
officers of the Ariel Rowing Club will take
place on the second Monday in January,
on which night there .will be a high jinks.
At the last meeting of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union,
President W. B. Hinchman announced
his appointment of A. P. Rothkopf of the
Dolphins as a rowing, commissioner. His
duties will be to devise means for fur
thering the sport. .
The newly elected officers of the Dol
phin Boating Club will be Installed at the
annual dinner on Saturday evening, Janu
ary 11. The committee having the ban
quet 1 in charge consists of W. O. Patch,
Fred Selbel, - H. Peraz^I, T. J. . Kennedy
and V. Kehrleln. .
The Boating Association of the Univer
sity of California, finding. that there is no
chance of a rowing contest against Stan
ford University, Is making preparations to
send a four-oared crew to Portland, Or.i -

PASADENA IS BEADY
FOR THE FOOTBALL GAME
Accommodations for Eight Thousand
Spectators Are Being
Prepared.
PASADENA. Dec. 20.â Arrangements for
the Stanford-Michigan football game, the
big sporting event of the annual tourna
ment of roses on New Tear's day, are
nearing completion. The 'Stanford party,
consisting of the varsity and subs,
coacKfes and trainers^ twenty . men in all,
is scheduled to arrive here to-morrow
noon in charge of Manager Edwards. The
men will be quartered at the Hotel Green,
as will the Eastern players when they
arrive. The Stanford eleven will complete
its training here with dally practice on
the new gridiron now being finished at
Sportsman's Park. Coach Yost of the
Michigan eleven and two men are expect
ed here by the 27th of this month.
Interest in the contest between the
champion eleven of the Middle West and
one of the big California varsities Is
strong among football experts here. Di
rector James R. H. "Wagner of the Tour
nament Association is preparing accom
modations for 8000 people. Members of
the Michigan Society of Los Angeles and
the Alumni of Stanford University have
reserved sections of the stands and boxes
for their use on New Year's day and indi
cations point to a large attendance.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 20.â
The twenty men composing the Stanford
football squad from which the team that
will meet the University of Michigan
eleven on New Year's â  day will
be chosen left Palo Alto on ths
Sunset express to-night for Pasadena. The
men are all in excellent spirit and fair
physical condition, considering ' the fact
that they have not been in strict training
since the intercollegiate game on Novem
ber 9. There are nearly enough players
in the squad to form two elevens to op
pose one another in scrimmage work until
the day of the game. The team will be
strengthened by the presence of Traeger.
who it was feared would not be able to
play because of sickness. The big fellow
is picking up rapidly and by New Year's
day will be able to give a good account
of himself. " â  . t â¢ ". *' T-
The feeling among the football enthu
siasts here is that the' cardinal eleven will
make a good showing against the Wol
verines, although a victory is not -hoped
for. -Stanford's defense is stronger than
its offensive work, and the cardinal sup
porters rely on this ability to withstand
attack to prevent a large score being
rolled up. such as Michigan has been win
ning by during the season.

A DISSOLVING CABINET.
DESPITE President Roosevelt's announcement
that he would carry out the policy of Mc-
Kinley. and despite his earnest efforts made
a the time he took office to induce McKinley's Min
isters to remain and assist him in the task, the Cabi
r.et is dissolving rapidly. If all reports from Wash
ington be true it is probable there will be virtually if
r.ot absolutely a new Cabinet in office before the close
of this session of Congress.
Rumor has been busy with stories of discord be
tween the new President and the Cabinet officers. It
has been said that several of them do not like his
methods of doing business. Reports have been given
out that this or that Secretao' is displeased because
the President confers directly with subordinates when
he wishes information concerning certain phases of
work in their department instead of making* his
inquiries through the Secretary himself. Some of
these stories and reports may have a partial founda
tion, but it is safe to say all such are exaggerated and
none are wholly true. Even should all the predicted
changes in the Cabinet take place, there would be no
occasion for resorting to such rumors to find an ex
planation of them.
It is well known that at the close of the first term
of McKinley there were common reports that there
would be a great many changes in the Cabinet at
the beginning of the new term. These reports were
founded upon the well-known desire of several mem
bers of the Cabinet to retire at that time. Secretary
Gage, for example, remained only because of the ur
gent desire of his chief, and there were others who
were influenced in the same way. It is natural that
these men should not feel the same obligation to
Roosevelt as to their former chief. Their private in
terests are large, and they may well* feel that it will
be no more than what is right ifÂ»they now turn the
public service over to the new administration and set
about looking after their own affairs, f
The relations of a President to his Cabinet are
necessarily very close. There ought to* exist between
them something of personal congeniality as well as
of political harmony. Under such circumstances the
retirement of members of the Cabinet dots not imply
any real antagonism between them and the Presi
dent
It has been the clear intention of the opposition to
arouse factional strife in the Republican party if it
can. Almost every day brings a new story of dis
cord between the President and some prominent Re
publican. We have been told that he has disagreed
with Hanna, with Platt and with Fairbanks of In
diana. Whenever a Cabinet officer intimates a de
sire to return to private life, or a Senator does not
oDtain exactly the patronage he wishes, the story
goes forth that the President is alienating his party.
There is no reason why the intelligence of the coun
try should be disturbed by such reports. The present
Cabinet may dissolve as quickly as some of th2
Washington dispatches forecast, but the harmony be
tween the Republican majority in Congress and the
administration will continue unbroken.
A Minnesota schoolboy who was getting up in
formation for his side of a school debate wrote to the
Secretary of War to ask whether Miles or Merritt is
the better general; and, while the inquiry seems im
pertinent, it shows that the boy has the making of a
good newspaper man in him, for he goes to the right
place to get the kind of information that would be
most interesting to the public.
Eastern papers announce the coming production
of an American grand opera by an American com
poser with an American prima donna, so now let the
world be still and listen and it will hear something
doing on the Atlantic coast. ' *
It is stated that all the linen used in the White
House this year 'will be the work of Porto Rico
women, and thus does the baby colony get its little
industries known to the country at the first jump.
FOB INDUSTRIAL PEACE.
FOLLOWING the strenuous contests between
labor and capital during the past summer and
fall there has come a movement designed to
prevent the recurrence of such disastrous antagon
isms in the future. The committee appointed at the
recent conference in New York gives promise that
the hope of those who desire peace will be fulfilled.
It is composed of men who are in the fullest sense
representative of labor, of capital,. and of the conser
vative spirit of the nation at large. That it will have
a potent moral influence at all times when it chooses
to exert itself to prevent strikes or lockouts is beyond
question, and that in itself will go far toward achiev
ing the jdesired end. v
It is not the intention of the committee to consider
or discuss any of the relations of capital and labor as
abstract propositions. It will deal only with specific
appeals which may' be made from time to time and
will act upon those as practical issues and not with
any intention of formulating theoretical principles.
It will be, in fact, a set of practical men organized to
deal with industrial disputes between employers and
employes, and' will do its work in a business way,
having no other object than that of clearing up such
misunderstandings- as may exist between the contend
ing parties.
That the work of such a committee will prove bene
ficial appears almost inevitable. In his address to the
conference John Mitchell, president of the United
Mine Workers, said: "I have never seen a strike that
could not have been averted if the two interests, had
met fairly in advance." The statement is the more
impressive because it comes from a man who has
probably seen more strikes than any other man of his
age in the country. It reveals clearly how large a
field there is for the work of a committee which will
have' sufficient moral force back of it to well nigh
compel both sides to confer fairly before either ven
tures upon a lockout or a strike.
On the day after its appointment the committee or
ganized as "The Industrial Department of the Na
tional Civic Federation." It defined its purpose. by
declaring: "The scope and province of this depart
ment shall be to do whatever may seem best to pro
mote industrial peace, to be helpful in establishing
rightful relations between employers and workers,
by its good offices endeavor to obviate and prevent
strikes and lockouts, to aid in renewing industrial re
lations where a rupture has occurred?'
For the purpose of carrying out the, work pro
posed the committee, either as a whole or through
subcommittees, will "act as a forum to adjust and de
cide upon questions at issue between workers and
their employers, provided in its opinion the subject
is one of sufficient importance." It is to be specially
noted that the committee declares "it will-not consider
abstract industrial problems," and "assumes no pow
ers of arbitration unless such powers be conferred by
both parties to the dispute."
Here, then, we have a committee of national im
portance undertaking the task of making sure that
there shall be no great strike until after a fair con
ference between the contending parties has been
had. It exerts no power other than that which eman
ates from moral influence, but it is well known that
in this country that power is great. It is fairly cer
tain public opinion will not sustain any party to an
industrial controversy which would refuse to heed a
call of the Industrial Department of the National
Civic Federation summoning it to a conference.'"
We need not indulge all the sanguine hopes ex
pressed by some of the members of the conference to
recognize that a great force making 'for the general
good has been established. It will not be able to
prevent strikes and lockouts altogether, but it will
help materially to that end. The work is in the hands
of strong and resolute men, and in every well de
vised action they take they will have the support of
a vast majority of the people.
H. Gaylord Wilshire, the of one of the
fake periodicals which under the new ruling have
been denied the privilege of transmission through
the mails as second class matter, has removed him
self and his publication to Canada, and thus does the
new rule benefit this country to a far greater extent
than was expected.
THE TARIFF AND THE TRUSTS.
CONGRESSMAN PAYNE of New York has
contributed to the current number of the In
ternational Monthly a review of the relation
of trusts to tariffs in this country and in the prin
cipal nations of Europe. The article is directed to an
examination of the arguments of those who hold that
trusts are the outcome of protective tariffs, that they
are more numerous and more powerful in this coun
try than elsewhere, and that the best means of break
ing such monopolies as they establish is to expose
them to the competition of free trade.
Mr. Payne points out that the protective system has
built up the industries of the United States, has es
tablished them upon a basis of home competition, has
so stimulated American mechanical skill and energy
that we are now by far the foremost industrial nation
on the globe, and has raised our workingmen to a
standard of living far higher than is enjoyed by the
workers of any other people. He cites many illus
trations of the good effects of protection in develop
ing in this country important industries that could
never have been maintained here under a system of
free trade. By reason of the profits assured to indus
try through the tariff there has arisen a competition
among manufacturers engaged in those industries,
and the result has been a general lowering of prices
to consumers without lowering wages.
Having thus set forth the benefits of protection he
proceeds directly to the question of the relation of
tariffs to trusts. He furnishes a long array of facts
gathered from consular reports showing that trusts
exist in every important nation in the world, despite
the variation in their tariffs. They exist and flourish
where there is free trade as well as where there is
protection. Great Britain, for ..example, has an al
most unlimited freedom of trade, and yet, as Mr.
Payne says: "Next to Germany Great Britain seems
to lead the world in the extent to which its industries
are under the control of trusts. These combinations
are so frequent over there as to excite little attention
or interest.' They control almost every branch and
kind of industry. To give any detailed account of
their extent, or the various branches of manufacture
they control, would require more space than is ac
corded to a magazine article. These trusts are or
ganized under the incorporation laws, and also as a
combination of many firms. The fact that all ar
ticles covered by trusts in, Great Britain are imported
free- of duty would seem to indicate, that the tariff in
Great Britain is not the mother of trusts."
The conclusion of the whole argument is this: "A
protective tariff tends to foster and build up com
petition. Every successful corporation which is
launched in a particular business, great or small, is
THE SAN -FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1901.
an incentive to the holders of the abundant capital
which now exists in this country to engage in a sim
ilar branch of business. This Is having its effect
every day. * *' * The main hope of destroying
trusts, or rendering their . operations harmless, is in
the competition which results from the natural laws
of trade, fostered when needed by the protective
tariff."
While there is nothing in this argument that is new
to those who have studied .the subject, the article has
yet a special value because of the array of facts
brought to sustain it. It is also pertinent to the
time, since under the leadership of men like Con
gressman Babcock there has been started a move
ment to break down the protective" system under the
pretense that by such action it will be possible to pre
vent the formation of monopolistic trusts.- So long
as that agitation goes on a clear presentation of the
truth concerning the tariff and the trusts .cannot be
too frequently made. Our industries rest upon pro
tection, and 'if that be withdrawn we may destroy our
domestic trusts indeed, but nearly all local industries
will go with them, and we shall fall into the hands of
foreign trusts, against which no home competition
will avail anything.
A statistician estimates that if all the armies of
Europe were drawn up in a long procession, with
their artillery, baggage-wagons and other equip
ments, the line would extend for upward of 24,000
miles, or virtually form a continuous array all round
the globe; and that is the kind of military ring the
workingmen of Europe have to support.
BRITAIN'S POOD SUPPLY.
AT a recent meeting of the National Union of
Conservative Clubs in Great Britain there was
adopted a resolution declaring: "Tha't for the
better security of the natipn Parliament should con
sider what measures can be taken for the preserva
tion and continuance of our food supply in case of
complications with other powers."
To Americans the resolution may not mean much,
but in Great Britain it is taken as a preliminary step
toward a campaign of education in favor of protect
ing British agriculture. The object of the resolution
is to get a committee appointed to investigate the
food supplies of the country. It is believed the in
vestigation will . disclose the serious danger of star
vation in which many thousands of people, in Great
Britain would be placed by a war which would
threaten her supremacy on the sea and interfere with
the importation of food. With such a showing, based
upon official statistics, the agriculturists will go be
fore the country and ask for a protective tariff on
wheat and other foodstuffs sufficiently high to render
profitable their cultivation at home.
A programme of that kind has to be approached
cautiously. The British have come to regard free
trade with something like a* superstitious reverence,
and any direct attack upon it would doom to defeat
the candidate who made it. Moreover, a tariff duty
on wheat and farm produce generally would be a tax
on bread and meat. It would be literally what the
German workingmen are calling the new German
tariff, "a hunger tax." The British workingman
would not support it for a day, unless it can be proven
to him that he runs the risk of starvation in case of
war if he do not consent to'pay the cost of food
raising at home. . .
This is perhaps as good a time as any to make such
an appeal for a return to the corn laws. The British
people are by no means so sure of themselves as they
were a few years ago. Many of -the manufacturers
whose predecessors led the free trade movement un
der the leadership of Cobden and Bright are begin
ning to feel the need of protection for their, own in
dustries, and consequently will be much more inclined
to listen favorably to the plea of the land-owners than
they were a few years ago.
The cautiousness with which any suggestion of
tariff duties is approached shows there is no party in
Great Britain willing as yet to include protection in
its political programme, but none the less the move
ment toward a resumption of protection is unmis
takable. â¢ The number of those who frankly declare
for it is increasing, and it would seem to be a mat
ter of but a comparatively few years when one party
or the other will make it an issue and win;
Secretary Gage has recommended the repeal of
what are known as the "miscellaneous war taxes."
He says "they are in their nature vaxatious, in some
instances oppressive, and separately considered yield
but small revenue." The recommendation suits the
country and Congress should live up to it.
SAN FRANCISCO has undertaken by voluntary
subscription to erect two monuments, one to
.Lincoln and one to McKinley. These enter
prises of patriotism should be kept in mind during the
holiday, gift-giving season. Why' should not each one
in proportion to his means contribute something of
"his holiday money to one or both of thefunds, which
are designed for the double purpose of attesting our
veneration for the martyred Presidents and of adorn
ing our city with artistic memorials?
The McKinley fund is growing apace. It has al
ready reached very nearly the sum of $30,000. The
Lincoln fund has not yet been so well supported,
though equally deserving. There is of course a rea
son for the difference in the popular contributions to
the two enterprises. The death of McKinley is still
acutely felt as the supreme tragedy of the year. The
hearts of all are still vibrating with personal memo
ries of the President who was so cruelly shot down in
the very midst of an assembly of the people whom
his statesmanship hail helped to render prosperous.
On the other hand the memory of Lincoln has be
come weakened by the lapse of time. He is not a
part of the, life of this generation as McKinley was,
and hence there is no such sense of personal "loss
when we recall his death. Naturally the people fol
low, the. stronger impulse, and their contributions
have been mainly to the fund designed to erect a
monument to the President who is personally remem
bered.
We ought to have each of these funds completed
as soon as possible. A little contribution to each
would be no heavy burden upon any one at this glad
season of the year. Where all give something no one
need give' much. The gifts, moreover, would not be
for toys soon, to be broken or for presents for a
mere holiday gladness, but would remain in the city
as permanent additions to its artistic and patriotic
treasures. We have undertaken -the two monuments.
Let us fulfill our undertaking. . iKxk'
The Philippine tariff bill went through the House
of Representatives like wheat . through a shoot, but
when it gets to the Senate it "will have t to pass
through a grinding process, and not until that is fin
ished will we know what the grist is to be.

LOSES A COMMISSION
FOR JILTING FIANCEE
PORTRAITS OF MISS REBECCA DOUGLASS AND CAPTAIN "W. P.
CRAWFORD OF CHESTER, S. C. SECRETARY ROOT DENIED A
COMMISSION TO LATTER FOR BREAKING HIS ENGAGEMENT.-
SECRETARY ROOT recently decided that the man who jilts his fiancee with
out excellent reasons therefor may not receive a commission In the army
of the United States. _ r â
The Secretary reached this conclusion in the case of Captain vv. tr.
Crawford of Chester, S. C, whom he found he could not recommend for
appointment to a lieutenancy in the regular service because he refused to marry
Miss Rebecca Douglass of the same place, giving reasona which the Secretary
decided did not justify the refusal.
Secretary Rcot has had the matter under consideration for several months.
"When Miss Douglass heard that Crawford, who had won a captaincy in volun
teer service in Cuba and the Philippines, was an applicant for a commission she
induced her friends' to interest Senator McLaurin in her behalf. She asserted
that Crawford had jilted her without cause almost at the hour set for the wed-
The South Carolina Senator laid the facts before .the Secretary and also the
' President, and the application was held up pending an investigation.
Crawford was called upon for an explanation, but he said he preferred to lose
the commission to explaining to the Secretary why he had broken the engage
ment. He said, however, he had explained very fully in a letter to the young
woman's mother, and that he had no objection to having the Secretary see that
letter if Miss Douglass' mother would consent.
Three weeks ago Mrs. Douglass was asked if she would submit that letter to
the Secretary. To-day she answered lay Bending Crawford's explanation. .After
the Secretary considered the matter for a few hours he announced that he would
not recommend Crawford for appointment. The Secretary declined to disclose
even a hint of the reason given by Crawford for the jilting.

OF LETTERS
The taste for the publication of love
letters seema a widespread one at the
present day. It has sufficed for tha ru
mor to get abroad that the correspond
ence of George Sand with her two moat
famous loversâ Alfred de Musset ana
Chopinâ were to be published. This
caused quite a pleasurable tremor of an
ticipation among the circulating libraries.
It appears, however, that the rumor is
partly premature, partly false. George
Sand herielf confided her correspondence
with Alfred de Musset to Emile Aucante.
to be published at an opportune moment,
which apparently not yet arrived.
Her letters to Chopin, which wers re
turned to her by Alexandre Dumas fib,
she, like a wise woman, con/lded to the
flames. ....'.
The letters which Mme. Maurice San-1
collated shortly before her recent death
and which are about to be given to the
world, contain, it is true, some of De
Musset's, but these are not in the least
love letters, in company with letters from
some of George Sand's other famous cor
respondents, such as Victor Hugo, FlauV

Most Popular Novels.
Now that most of the recent works of
leading novelists are in the hands or the
reading public It may be Interesting to
hear what books are being most widely
read on this side.
From inquiries of some of the principal
libraries it -seems, as of course might
have been expected, that Hall Calne's
"Eternal City" Is in most demand, butâ
and there is a very decided "but" In this
cageâmost librarians consider the popu
larity of Hall Caine's book only moment
ary. One ot the leading West End libra
rians says: "While It Is true that the
'Eternal City' is in most demand at pres
ent there can be no doubt that its popu
larity is but a fleeting one. It represents
only the requirements of a class of read
ers which is both uncritical and fickle,
rarely exercising a conscious preference
and content with obtaining the best ad
vertised article of the day.
"Among the more discriminating read
ers the most popular novels arÂ© 'Sir
Richard Calmady/ "Tristram of Blent'
and 'Kim.' In a very short time the
'Eternal City' will be as much forgottenu
as the 'Master Christian,' which it haaj
now supplanted.'*
Now, take the opinion of one of tha
chief librarians ot the East End, where
literary tastes are usually of quite a dif
ferent stamp. . Here again in. this case
opinion is quite the same as in the "West:
"The 'Eternal Clry'*ls certainly one oÂ£
the books most asked for, and is the
most frequently available for issue, be
cause It is of such an absorbing and ex
citing nature tUat people sit up all night
to finish, it. At any rate it is pretty reg
ularly returned the day after issue. Con
sidering Its length approaches to that of
the Bible, this is a tribute to its popular
ity in one way and a proof that curiosity
is soon quenched. The same may be said
of all the long problem novels which ap
pear. They are taken out because they
are boomed and talked about and are
promptly returned. So in this way novels
of the 'Master Christian' type receive
quite a fictitious record of popularity and
are .to be found at the top of long lists
of novels arranged In the order of their
so-called popularity."
Volume About Bacon.
Mrs. Elizabeth "Well3 Gallup of Amer
ica is not to bÂ© allowed to make a "cor
ner in Bacon."
There is to appear shortly through the
firm of Grant Richards a volume enti
tled "The Tragedy of Sir Francis Bacon."
It is an appeal try Harold Bayley for fur
ther investigation and research into many
questions at issue. Broadly it advances
that Bacon was associated with an actual
society known superficially to history as
the "Rosicrucians"; that the object of
this fraternity of learned men was tha
advancement of knowledge chiefly by the
preparation of instructive and elevating
literature; that the books so published
were secretly hallmarked.
This brings us to the Elizabethan Re
naissance, which is here put to the credit
of the "Rosicrucians."
As to the Bacon-Shakespeare contro
versy, it is a deplorable truism, says Bay
ley, that we English people know noth
ing or next to nothing of one who was
perhaps our noblest countryman. Francis
Bacon, instead of being rightly revered
or even respected, is to the majority but
little more than a dishonored name. It
is even more deplorable that as day by
day new writers come forward with fresh
facts their evidence Is unheeded or cried
down.
If any other woman talked about the
man a girl is, engaged to the way she
does, she would never forgive her with
her dying breath.MISCELLANEOUS.

RUMOR ALARMS
SKAGWAY PEOPLE
Fear Cession of Large
Strip of Territory to
Canada.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Dec. 2O.-The re
port that a large strip of territory, five
miles wide and thirty miles from the sea
shore, extending from. Pyramid Harbor
into the Porcupine country, is to be ceded
by the United Sta'tes to Canada, is the lat
est sensation that is troubling the minds
of the people of Skagway. Passengers
arriving by the seamer Amur to-day say
that nothing else is discussed on the
streets and there is a revival of the taik
of a few weeks ago of an invasion of the
Klondike because of the alleged grasp
ing propensities of the Canadians.
The local happenings which have given
color to the statement are the arrange
ments made by the party of engineers,
consisting of H, T. Harper, W. L. God
win and others, for making a railway
survey from Pyramid Harbor along the
old route of the Dalton trail to Fort Sel
kirk and down the Yukon River to Daw
son. Were such a railway constructed It
would be much shorter than the present
line, and as the grades would be easier,
it could handle business with much less
expense. The party started on snow
shoes and must have been in a great
hurry, so the story goes, else they would
have* waited for better weather and no
snow in the spring.
The probability of the cession of the
Pyramid Valley, in the minds of north
erners, lies in the fact that the Dominion
Government officials have said again and
again that no charter will be given to a
railway which runs partly Into the Yukon
territory and partly in Alaska. There
fore it is believed that, as the railway
will apparently be built, it must all be
In Canada, and this cupports the rumor
already circulated on the merits of an
ordinary report that this parcel of land
will be ceded by the American Govern
ment to Canada.

SACRIFICES HER
LIFE TO PRIDE
Aged Woman Succumbs
to Starvation in
Pasadena.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Dec. 20.â Mrs. Adeline
Barrett died of starvation in this city
yesterday because she was too proud to
beg. Neighbors of the woman are deeply
affected, as they did not know of her
need. Mrs. Barrett was a native of Illi
nois, 50 years of age, and resided on Lin
coln avenue. She received about $15 quar
terly from some stock she owned and
tried to exist on this income. She would
buy a cup of coffee or a dish of soup
once or twice a day, that being all she
could afford.
Several days ago she was taken ill. Her
physician said that she might have re
covered had she not starved herself, but
she was afflicted with kidney trouble and
her condition was such that nothing could
be done for her. All that her neighbors
knew of her poverty was that she once
borrowed enough money to purchase a hot
water bag. Her brother in the East
wrote to a friend here inquiring about her
circumstances and offering- help, but she
refused It, saying she was not in need.

STUDENT'S LIFE
California Girl Is Burned
to Death at Bryn
Mawr.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2O.-Miss Lillian
Vickers of Los Angeles, Cal., whose fath
er is wealthy and the owner of a large
cattle ranch, met a terrible death at Bryn
Mawr College, where she had been a stu
dent for three years. Her clothing caught
fire in the morning In her room after she
awoke and she died four hours after her
suffering began.
Just how the accident occurred no one
can tell, and the young woman was con
scious so short a time that she could give
no explanation. It was 8:30 o'clock and
some girl students were in their apart
ments dressing, when one or two neigh
bors of Miss Vickers in the dormitory
heard a gToan and a half smothered cry
for help from the bathroom opposite tho
young Californian's room. Hurrying there,
they opened the door and then sprang
back with screams as Miss Vickers, her
nightdress ablaze, staggered forward- and
fell to the floor unconscious.
For a moment the young women hesi
tated, but then called for the college fire
brigade and began to beat into the flames
that enveloped the body of their friend.
They wrapped a rug around the suffer
ing woman and covered her with what
ever articles of woolen clothing they could
find.
The flames were soon extinguished and
the sufferer was carried to. her room,
where, despite the efforts of physlcian3,
she soon died. The young woman was
conscious but a brief interval after the
accident. Then she asked: "Was any one
else burned? Was the college harmed?"
One theory as to the cause of the acci
dent is that upon entering the bathroom
and finding it dark. Miss Vickers lighted
the gas, and as she did so the sleeve of
her nightdress touched the Jet. Another
suggestion is that she struck a match and
part of the burning head fell upon her
nightdress.
The young woman spent yesterday with
her aunt, Mrs. Sarah L. Oberholzer of
1905 Tioga street, buying Christmas pres
ents in. Philadelphia and was in the best
of spirits when she returned to the col
lege at night. She was 25 years old and
would have graduated in 1903. Her father,
John Vickers, 13 the owner of Vickers Isl
and, California.
LOS ANGELES, Dec.' 20.â Miss Lillian
Vickers, who was to-day burned to death
at Bryn Mawr College, Philadelphia, was
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. V. Vick
ers of Los Angeles and one of five daugh
ters who are prominent among the young
society people of this city. The ; young
woman had been at Bryn Mawr for the

GREAT COPPER
BEDS IN SIGHT
Peruvian Outlook May
Explain Market's De
moralization.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 20.â Mr. Riblet,
mining englneer^and constructor of aerial
tramways, who has returned from the
Sierra del Pasco mines, in Peru, brings
a story which may account for the de
moralization of the copper market. He
says that in twelve months the Sierra del
Pasco mines of Peru, owned by the
'Rothschilds and other English capitalists,
will be able to add thousands of tons of
copper per annum to the world's produc
tion. â  The supply of ore is inexhaustible.
The company expects to be able to land
copper at* Valparaiso within twelve
months at 7 cents a pound, and as copper
is now selling at 13 cents the cheapness- of
the supply from the Peruvian mines will
make their output no Inconsiderable fac
tor in the market.
Riblet went to Peru five months ago,
and a.t the Sierra del Pasco mines, 180
miles inward from Chimboto, he built a
tramway and a railroad 120 miles In
length to Ciudad. Formerly 15,000 llamas
were used to pack the ore from the mines
to Ciudad for shipment on the railroad,
the pack trains traveling over arduous
trails.
RIblet says .the Sierra del Pasco mines,
which have been worked as a silver prop
osition for more than 400 years, contain
the largest body of high grade copper ore
in the world. The Spanish owners pre
viously working the property were unable
to treat the copper and left it untouched
since the time the mines were first opened.
As a consequence the company will have
at least a five years' ore supply ready for
reduction. The Sierra del. Pasco mines
are 8000 feet above the sea and are lo
cated on an immense ledge, which runs
through them for more than 1000 feet.

NEW YORK, Dec. 20. â Reginald G. Vanderbilt, youngest son of the late Cornelius

visions of his father's will, his fullinheritance of $7,500,000 as a birthday gift. Young

pose of taking 4egal possession of his fortune. That formality performed, he returned to

his father for the benefit' of his children, his total fortune may now be estimated at

Argentina and Chile May
Be Able to Avert a â ,
Great War!
Special Dispatch to The Call,
CALL BURHiAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.â Official ad
vices received here show that an amica
ble settlement of the dispute between
Argentina and Chile is pending. Minister
Merou, representing Argentina, is confi
dent that as a result of the recent ex
change of notes by the two countries war
has been averted for the present at least.
Well informed diplomats are, however,
of the opinion that war is simply a mat
ter of time, as they say the great ques
tion between the two countries is not
where the boundary line shall be, but
which shall be the predominant power of
South America.
BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 20.â In order to
commemorate the formation of the
League of Patriots here thousands oi
young men paraded the streets last even
ing cneerlng for Argentina, the Argentina
army, President Hoca and ex-President
ivlltre now president of the commission
to settle the frontier dispute witn Chile.
The crowas of manlfesiants, estimated
to havo numbered as many as 80,000 per
sons, stopped and cheered before the of
tices of tne various newspapers, where
nery addresses were made. The crowds
then marched in the direction of Presi
dent Koca's residence, before which the
national hymn was sung. The President
responded with an energetic speech,
which was enthusiastically applauded.
Then for about an hour the crowds en
gaged in the patriotic demonstration,
marched past? the President's residence,
shouting, "No more diplomatic notes!"
"Let us have war sooner than that!"
There were also some cries of "Death to
the Chileans!"
The Nacion, referring to the interna
tional complications, says that Uruguay
Is much concerned in view of the possi
bility of a conflict between Argentina and
Chile about her neutrality. Brazil Is also
said to be considering the same subject.
In this connection it is reported that
Brazil contemplates appropriating Â£5,U00,
000 to Â£10,000,000 sterling for the purchase
of new warships; showing, it is said, that
Brazil, which up to the present has suc
ceeded in confining herself to a state of
armed peace, is finally getting mixed up
in the diplomatic, complications and is
feeling herself compelled to guard against
the threatened trouble, between Soqth
American countries. Peru and Bolivia
are also strengthening their armaments
and Incidentally are ruining themselves
by so doing:.
President Roca and Senor Trigoyen,
the Governor of the province of Buenos
Ayres, have had a long conference rela
tive to the Chilean situation. President
Roca will start on a tour of inspection
of the military districts of the Argentina
republic in January and will review all
the troops which will by that time have
been mobilized. Â»

FACULTY EXPELS
TEAM MANAGER
Sequel to Troubles of a
College Football
Eleven. )
Special DisDatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 20.â Frank E. Bright
man, late football manager at the. State
University, was this afternoon expelled
from college. It was known some time
ago by those students who keep in close
touch with the professors that such action
would be taken, but to the greater part
of the student body his expulsion came as
a surprise.
In his intense desire to make a success
of athletics, Brightman, it is said, neglect
ed his studies. During the summer and
fall Just past Brightman made every effort
to turn out a successful football team: It
was through his efforts that Wright was
brought from New York to manage the
team. He was lavish in his furnishings
of the team. Believing that the college
would support him, he entered into a pol
icy of importing star players to help the
eleven.
The imported men proved to be worth
less, the team went J2tiOO Into debt and tho
students turned upon Brightman, as he
was the only one on whom they could
vent their disappointment. He was first
suspended as manager of athletics by the
executive committee of the students and
a. substitute was appointed. Various
charges of incompetency. and a desire
to professionalize the team were made.
Finally the faculty used its authority to
expell him from the university.
Thus deprived of all privileges at the
State University Brigrhtman will be given
no credit for the work already done and
probably will be denied admission to other
colleges. The action of the faculty wad
taken- in the face of the fact that many
of the students believe that the unfortu
nate young man had been acting for what
he thought was" the best interests of the
college. It Is also claimed that the fac
ulty turned on Brightman after the foot
ball disaster, but not before.

Thirtieth street to-day and another man
is missing. The dead are:
JOHN WKLVIK, aged 32 years.
PATRICK O'CONNOR, aged 28 years.
An unknown man.
The missing man is John Wiltz and he
is probably among the killed. The ten
men injured, at the hospitals, are doing
well. Keuben Miller Jr., superintendent
of the plant, states that the boilers were
examined last week and pronounced In,
excellent condition. No known cause caa
be given for the explosion, but. an inves
tigation is now in progress.
It was about 4 :lo o'clock, as the night
crew was about to turn over the mill to
tho day force, that four boilers in the
ten-inch bar mill No. 3 exploded with
terrific force. The mill was wrecked and
the debris is piled from fifty to seventy
five feet high. The boiler works of
James McNeil, adjoining the Black Dia
mond mill, were also destroyed.
From what can be learned the four
boilers exploded at one time, reducing the
mill to a heap of charred timbers and
twisted iron. There is not a straight
piece of iron or steel left in the entire
building. Even the bolts In the beams
and stringers are twisted like screw nails.
One of the boilers went through the
roof of the bar mill, soared through the
air across Thirtieth street and crashed
Into the residence of Robert Price at 8
Tnirtieth street, completely wrecking the
house. Price and his family rushed to
the street in their night clothes.

NEW STATIONS
Wireless Telegraphy In
ventor Planning Ex
periments.
SDecial Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. Dec. 20.â Marconi
wired yesterday to Professor Alexander
Graham Bell, accepting provisionally the
offer of his Cape Breton estate as a site
for further wireless experiments.
- Marconi announced to-night that ac
cording to his present plans he will sail
for England next Monday on the steamer
Sardinian. His company in London wants
him to assist In the negotiations with the
Anglo-American Telegraph Company. The
inventor has packed his wireles3 appar
atus and will take with him the portion
which cannot be used here. The remain
der he will leave here In readiness for his
return in a month or two.
The inventor spent this afternoon in
looking for sites suitable for the establish
ment of stations. The situation at Cape
Spear is the best he has yet seen. He will
abandon the station on Signal Hill, It be
ing too high to give good results. Mar
coni said that he would select a site on
the French shore, but he is unwilling to
irritate the imperial Government. He has
expressed his readiness to install his wire
less system between St. Pierre and France
if the French Government desires It in the
way of a commercial enterprise.
To-day Marconi denied the statement
published in the press of St. Johns and
wired from the United States to the ef
fect that M^ss Holman, his fiancee, had
received a cablegram from him urging a
speedy marriage. Marconi will go to New
York to be married in January.
PERRY WEST IN JAIL
ON BIGAMY CHARGE
Emulates His Father, Who in His
Time Has Led Ten Women to
the Marriage Altar.
TACOMA, Dec. 20.â With one wife di
vorced, another managing a restauraint In
Ellensburg- and a third suing him. for
bigamy, Perry -West is In" serious trouble.
While facing the charge against him lie
remains in jail In Walla Walla, Deputy
Sheriff Painter arrested him in Ellens
burg yesterday. The complaint Is made
by Alice, wife No. 2, who married West
in Sheridan, Wyo., five years ago. Before
that time West had married and been di
vorced. Wife No. 3 was a Umatffia
County miss, Jenny Kelly by name.
Perry West is a son of Peter West, a
Justice of the Peace of Umatllla County,
residing in Pendleton. He has some of
his father's characteristics. Peter West
married ten times and the stories of some
of his courtships made interesting read
ing in times past, while his history has
been given to the public in joblots for a
score or more of years. Peter West
never got into court, as his son has done,
although some of his escapades were in
teresting and exciting. Now an old man,
he has evidently retired in favor of his
son Perry, who is rounding out the
record.
West will be tried before Justice Glass
ford. The second Mrs. West has arrived
in Walla Walla to prosecute the case.
FRESNO, Dec. 20. â The proposition to^ bond
the city for $235,000 for a municipal electric
light and power plant was defeated to-day.
NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
RING "WORM AND DANDRUFF.
They Are Each Caused by a Pestifer-
ous Germ.
Ring worm and dandruff are somewhat
similar in their origin; each is caused by
a parasite. The germ that causes jt dan-
druff digs to" the root of the hair, and
saps its vitality, causing falling hair^tnd,
finally, baldness. Without dandruff there
wculd never be baldness, and to cure dan-
druff it is necessary to kill tlfe.germ.
There has been no hair preparation that
would do this until the discovery of New-
bro's Herpicide, which positively kills the
dandruff germ, allays itching instantly
and makes hair glossy and soft as silk. At
all druggists. Take no substitute. There
Is nothing "Just as good."

I I were wanting in business sagacity, that you

insure their finer, more delicate and perishable things

MRS. WALTER E. DEAN'S LUNCHEON
PROVES A DELIGHTFUL AFFAIR
Conservatory at the Palace Is Beautifully Decorated and
Arranged to Represent a Winter Scene.
Mrs. 'Walter E. Dean's luncheon yester
day at the Palace was a delightful affair.
The conservatory, where the luncheon
was served, was decorated to represent a
winter scene, many greens being used in
a most ingenious manner. The white
table, where the twenty-two debutantes
were seated, was especially wintry. The
center piece was a tall tree, quite desti
tute of foliage, with snow and ice effects
over it. At each plate was a favor in the
shape of a red poinsetna plant, the pot
of which was draped in scarlet silk of i!ie
same shade. The other table was done
in red, and had a large Christmas tiee
in the center. From the uppermost
branches of the tree were "streamers Â«:;"
red satin ribbon reaching down to eac'i
plate and hoWlng a card. The favors at
the red table were little pine trees. Many
red carnations and Cnristmas berr ; es
were used.
Mrs. Walter L. Dean, the hostess'
caughter-in-law, was present and assist
ed Mrs. \V. E. Dean, as did also Mrs.
Fred Tallant and Mrs. Grant Selfridge.
These were the only matrons invited, as
the luncheon was strictly a rosebud af

The largest function Iael evening was
the Christmas german of the Friday
Fortnightlys at Cotillon Hall. It was not
only the Christmas dance, but- the Army
and Navy Cotillon, -and the presence of
the officers added much to the brilliancy
of the ecene. Many of the most popular
debutantes were present. Smart gowns
were in evidence, many of which were
costly and beautiful. Mrs. Monroe Salis

The Occidental Free Kindergarten held
its Christmas festival yesterday after
noon at Union Square Hall, 421 Post street.
The society includes one hundred children
kindergarteners, sixty members of the
children's club, thirty-five of the girls'
club and forty of the mothers' club. A
number of young ladies manage the so
ciety, and they are assisted by contribu
tions.'
A programme of sixteen numbers wjia
rendered by the children. The Christmas
tree, however, was the feature of the oc
casion. It was decorated in a most orig
inal and unique way with red apples.
Christmas berries and red banners with
medieval designs in gold. /The young la
dies' work was most artistic and theli
new ideas were a pleasant relief from the
sameness to which we are accustomed. in
Christmas trees.
The patrons of the kindergarten wera
especially thoughtful this year and re
membered the little ones handsomely. It
would be difficult to find a happier lot of.
faces than the ones at the festival. Those
ln charge of the affair were:

and the young misses of the school ren
dered it exceptionally well. The cast was
as follows: - . â¢ *

BARK RODERICK DHU OF THE SUGAR
FLEET MAKES GOOD RUN FROM HILO
Beats Other Vessels That Are Out From Three Weeks to a Month From the
- Hawaiian Islands and Covers the Distance in Fourteen Days, -a Splen
did Performance Considering the Winds at This Season of the Year
TtfE MATSON CLIPPER RODERICK DHU SIGNALING ' THE FRENCH BARK GENEVIEVE MOLINOS AND THE
AMERICAN BARK S. C. ALLEN OFF HUMBOLDT. THE DHU CAME ON DOWN THE COAST, BUT THE
OTHERS STOOD OUT TO SEA. ..
p-rj-C HE American bark Roderick Dhu
1 arrived from the Hawaiian Islands
I yesterday, making the best run of
1L the season â fourteen days. When
700 miles off port Coptain John
son thought he was going to break a rec
ord, but contrary winds took possession
and he had to beat his way to 40 degress
north. There he met the French bark
Genevive Molinos and the American bark
S. C. Allen. The captain of the Allen sig
naled "all well," while the Molinos asked
what the prevailing winds, on the coast
were and what were the chances for fln'2
weather. Captain Johnson signaled back
that the prevailing winds at this time of
the year are. southeast, but as to the
weather no man could make a guess.
The Roderick Dhu was at that time off
Humboldt ana the captain and crew had
all they wanted of wearing ship to meet
every change of the wind. Captain John
son worked his way down the coast, while
the Molinos and Allen stood off shore and
are now probably working their way back
to San Francisco.
"For five days after leaving Hilo," said
Captain Johnson yesterday, "we made
record breaking runs. The ship was in
good trim and every stitch of canvas
drew. For five days we averaged over
300 knots a day and I thought. we would
make port in steamboat time and break
the record. Then came the change. ; I
had to beat north in hopes of getting a
northwest breeze and^ then had to beat
back again. We're home for Christmas,
anyhow, and that's more than any of us
expected."
The Genevive Molinos, spoken by the
Roderick Dhu, is now out 123 days from
Havre in ballast. She will load wheat
here for Europe. ' The S. C. Allen is 25
days out from Honolulu and has a num
ber of passengers. The remainder of the
sugar, fleet which the Roderick Dhu beat
into port were the St. Katherine, now ou;
19 days from Hilo; Santiago and Mohican,
each 20 days out from Honolulu; Mauna
Ala, 19 days, and William H. Marston, IS
days from Honolulu, and Emily F. "Whit
ney. 23 days from Kahului.
A number of passengers who had book
ed to come home on the Dhu changed
their minds when they found the St.
Katherine was sailing five days earlier,
so they transferred their tickets in order
to be home before Christmas. The St.
Katherine is still to be heard from, while'
the Dhu is"' at a,nch*or in the bay and her
passengers ashore.
WORKING ON THE WRECK.
Workmen Started Yesterday to Raise
the Steamer San Rafael.
Preparations were made yesterday for
the raising of the San Rafael. A gang, of
men with the necessary material went out
to the scene, a diver went along and every
effort will be made to* salve the ship. As
the San Rafael now lies she can be han
dled. She rests easily in about thirty
fathoms of water and with ropes placed
around the hull two powerful tugs will
haul her into shallow water where the
divers can work. Then the machinery
may be removed and the hull abandoned
or the whole fabric may be raised, as the
directors elect.
Water Front Notes.
Captain Tribble is no longer ln charge
of the Sausalito, nor is Captain McKenzie
on the James M. Donohue. The pilots
of both vessels will run them till the first
of the year, when it is presumed the old
captains will resume control.
Chris Guerrerd accidentally asphyxiated
himself ln a water front hotel yesterday
morning. He was "attended at the Har
bor Hospital and his life saved. ?
The Narcissus, now, out 191 days from
Genoa for San Francisco, is quoted at 15
per cent; the Robert Duncan, 81 days out
from Welhaiwei for Puget Sound,, at 50
per cent, and the Augha, 164 days from
Newcastle, N. S. W., for Panama, at 90

JOHN J. VALENTINE PASSES AWAY
Death Ends Suffering That Held President of Wells, Fargo & Company to
His Bed Through Weary Monthsâ He Was Not Only Prominent in the
Business World, but Won Renown as a Political and Economical Writer
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â John J. Val
entine, president of Weils, Fargo
& Co., died this morning at 1:30
o'clock. His last hours en earth
were peaceful. Surrounded by
the members of his family â his wife, .his
daughter Ethel and his son Edwardâ the
sufferer gradually sank to his final rest.
The !ate Mr. Valentine suffered ill
health for years. For the last ten months
Ms condition showed that he. was ap
proaching the end of Hfe"s Journey and
for two months preceding his death he
v.-as unable to leave his bed. - â '
The arrangements for the funeral will
be made within a day or two.
The death of John J. Valentine removes
from the scene cT his wonted activity one
cf the most capable and experienced men
in the express transportation business
that the country has ever known. For
Feme forty years he was connected with
Wells, Fargo & Co. and for nearly half
that time his name stood before the pub
lic for the active and actual management
of that wealthy and widely operating
concern.
John J. Valentine was born In Bowling
Green the county scat of Warren County,
Kentucky, November 12, 1S40. His family
en his father's side was of English ex
traction, coming from the parish of
Kccles, Lancaster County, England,
where the ancestral seat, Bendiffe Hall,
Elill stands.
The first of the name in America was
John Valentine, who came over the water
about 1C40, and settled in Isle of Wight
County, Virginia. One of his descendants.
John *J. Valentine's great-grandfather,
took active part In the events leading up
to the Revolutionary War and served
with the Virginia fotces in the Continen
tal army.
In consideration of this service he, with
others, received from the State of Vir
ginia considerable grants cf land in what
â¢vvas then part of Augusta County, Vir
ginia, and which later became the State of
Kentuckv. It was most probably to look
Biter, and take possession of that land
that William Crenshaw Valentine, John
J.'a father, when yet a young man, emi
grated to Kentucky. There he married
i-:i:za Tales Cunningham, also the de
scendant of an old Virginia family, who
became the mother of the subject of this
sketch.
Young John received what was then
considered a good education in the schools

of his native "placeâ private enterprises
they were and generally thoroughâ and at
the age of 14 went Into business as a clerk
for Younglove Brothers, druggists, in his
native town. â¢
The firm was also agent for Carter,
Thomas & Co.'s stage and express line,
which in those ante-railroad days covered
all the country between Louisville on the
north and'Kashville, Tenn., on the south,
and . young Valentine's connection with
the express business may be said to date
from his connection with this line.
The construction of the Louisville and
Nashville Railroad was under way at that
time and it soon reached Bowling Green
and took the direct business from the old
stage line. O'Bannon, Kean & Co. of
lxmisville at lirst had the express privi
leges on the railroad and connecting stage
lines, but it was later absorbed by the
Adams Express Company, and young Val
entine entered the service Of that com
pany, in which he remained until the win
ter of 1861, when he resigned and came
out to California. ; 'â >
Soon after his arrival here he was ap
pointed joint agent for Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s Express, the Pioneer Stage Com
pany and the California State Telegraph
Company at Strawberry . Valley, El Do
rado County. He remained there, how
ever, but a short time, being transferred
to the very important post 1 at Virginia
City, New, where he had charge of the
business of the Pioneer Stage Company
and the Overland. Mall Company.
His responsibilities in this position were
very great and his duties heavy and ex
acting, but he developed a wonderful
aptitude for handling the business with
promptness, efficiency and economy, and
was in due. time made superintendent of
the Pacific division of Wells, Kargo &
Co.'s express business.
Other promotions followed until in 1868,
when he was offered the position of
manager at the company's headquar
ters in New York City.
For good reasons he declined the offer,
but the following year accepted this posi
tion of general superintendent for Wells,
Fargo & Co., with headquarters in New
Â¥ork.
The business of the company being
chiefly on the Pacific Coast, the head
quarters were soon after transferred to
San Francisco, where they have since re
mained, and where and in Oakland Mr.
Valentine resided from his return from
New York in 1870 until his death. .*.â¢-,
As general superintendent of the com
pany and enjoying the fullest confidence
of Lloyd Tevis, the president, and J.* B.
Haggin, fellow Kentucklans. and the oth
ers connected with the direction of its af
fairs, Mr. Valentine had In a large meas
ure a free hand in planning and consum
mating the enormous growth in the busi
ness that has followed the development
of the Pacific Slope, and to his efforts Js
largely due the present splendid system
and equipment of the company.
In 18fc2 Mr. Valentine was elected a dl
fector of %he company and also vice pres
ident, at the same time continuing the
general superintendency. In 18S4 the new
office of general manager was created
and he was unanimously elected to fill It.-
In 1Â£92, on the retirement of Lloyd
Tevls from the presidency of the com
pany. John J. Valentine was unanimously
elected president and was at each sub
sequent election continued Jn.' that . posi
tion, ?nd until within a very short time
before his death was not only the official
but actual head and director of Its af
fairs.
Though always keeping in such close
connection with . all the several depart
ments of the Immense business of the
company as to be thoroughly Informed
even to the smallest practical details Mr.
Valentine found ample time for study, es
pecially on financial : questions. He for
many years annually published a sum
mary of America's output of gold and sil
ver, which Is recognized as reliable and
authoritative.
Mr. Valentine was a Democrat and in
the later campaigns took an active part
in the discussion of the financial questions
before tlie country, making many strong
contributions to the campaign literature,
both by pamphlet and In the press. In
1SS6 he differed with his party on financial
Issues, but In 1900 supported Bryan on the
imperialism issues.
John J. Valentine was a broad-minded,
public-spirited citizen and a charitable
man whose purse was quietly opened to
relieve private distress as well as swell
the relief fund in seasons of public ca
lamity. He always took an active inter
est in the educational affairs of the com
munity and was a warm supporter of the
Young Men's Christian Association in the
place of his residence.
Mr. Valentine was a member of the
Protestant Episcopal church and for
many years previous to his death be
longed to the Advent Church, Oakland.

POPE RECEIVES
A CALIFORNIAN
Gk McEnerney Granted
an Audience by His
Holiness.
Garret W. McEnerney, the well-known
attorney, returned yesterday from an ex
tended tour of Europe. He Wad been
away nearly three months and looks
greatly benefited by his tripâ in fact his
classmates from St. Mary's College, who
went to Sacramento to meet him, say
that he looks as young as when he gradu
ated. On his arrival in this city he went
directly to the home of his mother.
McEnerney says that the incident that
made the deepest impression on him dur
ing the tour was an audience he had with
Pope Leo at Rome. He says that he
spent about half* an hour with his Holi
ness.- '_â¢ '.â¢ ' i ':
McEnerney absolutely contradicts tac
telegrams which announce that the Pope
Is in falfing health. He says that tne
aged pon till appeared to be remarkably
active and In good health, lie talked witn
great earnestness and was thoroughly
conversant with all matters pertaining to
Catholicism in the United States. Mc-
Enerney describes his Holiness as a man
with a serene expression and with black
eyes that seemed to pierce the person he
is addressing. '7 .
McEnerney spent eight days In Rome
and says that besides its historical at
traction it is ono of the most modern and
up-to-date cities that he visited. The
wealthy men of Rome live in modern
residences that are furnished with the
latest improvements. In Ireland McEner
ney spent considerable time and for sev
eral days was a guest of Rev. Dr. Mac
donald of Maynooth College, the â¢ great
ecclesiastical seminary of. Ireland. ' *j
The following frjfends went to Sacra
mento to greet McEnerney to California:
J. J. Barrett, John Drum, Jack McEner
ney, James H. O'Brien and Theodore P.

BOARD COERCES
A DEAF TEACHER
Opposes the Withdraw
al of the Resignation
of Miss Slavan.
The latest teacher to incur the displeas
ure of the Board of Education Is Misa M.
H. Slavan, principal of the Cleveland
School. The board has for a long time en
deavored to get rid of her because of her
deafness. Repeated visits to the school
by the directors, however,' have shown
that the work and discipline in. the echool
were of the best and that Miss Slavan's
infirmity did not militate against her abil
ity to govern pupils.
Miss Slavan-'s attorney, S. V. Co3tello,
says that the board finally persuaded Miss
Slavan to resign and she mailed her resig
nation last week. Meanwhile her attorney
and some friends advised her to withdraw
her resignation and fight the 'board in the
courts it necessary.
Superintendent Webster asked that the
letter withdrawing the resignation be read
at yesterday's meeting of the board, but
it was quietly put away by. Mrs. ICincald.
The latter said the letter was addressed
to her personally and she had a right to
withold it until the board held its regular
secret session.
Superintendent Webster desired to know
why Madison -Babcock, vice principal of
the Fairmount School, had not applied for"
a leave of absence as other teachers are
required to do. Webster read a letter from
Principal Johnson of the school complain
ing of Babceck's constant absence from
his post of duty. Webster objected to the
boad's evident desire .to shield Babcock.
Ba'ocock's leave, which was granted three
weeks ago by Mrs. Kincald, but not rati
fied at the next meeting, as the rules pro
vide, was approved and an extension was
granted until January e, 1902.
. Mrs. Geraldine Donovan Boyle present
ed a claim for back salary amounting to
$800 and appjied for reinstatement. She
alleges that she was illegally deprived of
her position in the Richmond School olie
year ago. She was consolidated out, but
her class. was formed again and given to
another teacher.
The board -took under consideration the
suggestion of the California Club - to In
troduce in the eighth grade and High
School classes certain literature on civil
service reform.
Leaves of absence were granted to Mary
Roper and Miss S. Kingsbury and denied
to Lucretla Burnham and Mary E. Mo
ron ey.
The application of Dr. d: A. Nagel to ex
amine the eyes of pupils. was placed on

TEACHER MUST
BE REINSTATED
Jean Dwyer Wins Her
Suit Against Board
of Education.
A writ of mandate Was issued by Judge
Sea well yesterday directing the Board, of
â Education to restore Miss Jean Dwyer to
her position as teacher in the fifth grade
of the Sherman Primary School, from
which she was suspended last July be
cause she was charged with having a
fierce temper. Judge Sea well also direct
ed that the Board of Education issue to
Miss Dwyer a warrant for her salary dur
ing the time of her suspension.
Judge Seawell's decision confirms that
rendered by Judge Hunt, in the case of
Miss . McKinney. The legal battle be
tween the teachers â  suspended by Mrs.
Mary Kincaid, president of the Board of
Education, and the board has been a bit
ter one,, and victory has perched on the
banners of the teachers in every case
where the rights of -the 'teachers against
whom charges. have been preferred have
been -brought into the courts.
In deciding that Miss Dwyer is entitled
to her position despite the mandate of
Mrs. Kincaid, Judge Seawell said:
The Board of Education has power, under Its
general powers, to suspend a teacher pending
an Investigation of charges. The power of sus
pension and removal, however, is a judicial
power and cannot be delegated by the board
to the president of the board or the Superin
tendent of Schools. In consequence, the rule
of the board attempting to delegate that power
Is Illegal. Inasmuch aa the . suspension of Miss
Dwyer was made by the president of the board
and not the beard itself, the suspension is
void. â â  â â â â  â¢<<*â â¢â  â â ' â¢::-â â  ''â }â¢â¢'*â '

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 20. â The stock market
ehowed its Immense relief from the disturbing
effect of the recent eccentricities of Amalga
mated Copper. There were eome further con
tortions in that stock for a short time after
the opening, but it settled down Into a condition
of quietude, which has not been seen for many
â¢weeks. Between CO and G7 it seemed to have
arrived at a condition of stable equilibrium.
'The opening dip to Â«4% was apparently due to
a drive from the bears, who sought an oppor
tunity to cover their short contracts. The high
level of the etock for the day was at 68, and
the net gain was a point. The statement issued
by the directors last night was accepted as a
rcpclamation of a struggle for business with
the Independent companies and such cut in the
price of the product as would be necessary.
This, however, had been definitely foreshadow
ed by previous developments and had been per
verted and exaggerated by all sorts of rumors
end manipulation. With authorized official in
formation as a base of operations, the steadi
ness and quiet tone of the stock offered a re
markable contrast. The solution of part of the
mystery which has hung over this 6tock let
loose the forces of demand which have lain
dormant in the market for several days past.
The buying was apparently based upon the gen
eral consideration of the high degree of pros
perity which is prevailing in all branches of
trade. The Fpecial strength of the coalers,
"Which led the advance, was due to the season
able weather for the trade and to reports of a
possible advance in the price of anthracite. The
formation of the arbitration committee by the
National Civic Federation was a factor In the
strength of this group, as the president of the
miners' organization has a prominent place on
the committee. The advances ran from about
a point up to 2% in Delaware and Hudson and
3 in Hpcking Valley. The strength of the Pa
ciftci" end transcontlnentals was apparently
baÂ»pÂ« on the favprable showing which it is ex
pected the Union Pacific annual report will
make. Reports of adjustment or of efforts
making toward that end of rate disturbances in
the West helped the railroad list generally. The
bull campaign in the local traction stocks wai
renewed under the leadership of Manhattan.
The charp gaine in a number of industrials
â¢were based on individual considerations. The
Â«-xpresg stocks were conspicuous as a group.
IWestinshouse Electric rose buoyantly 11% and
at a reaction closed with a net gain of 9 points.
Sugar was heavy on the signs of the renewal
of the rate war In that trade. The rate for all
loans stiffened late In the day. Although the
banks have apparently lost nearly $2,000,000 In
cash during the week, sentiment is for the mo
ment optimistic over the money outlook. To
morrow's bank statement, it is hoped, will re
veal a large loan contraction, although the rise
In call "money to-day fails to corroborate this
expectation. The fact that to-morrow's steam
ers are the last on which gold shipments could
reach foreign destinations In time for the an
nual settlements was felt to end the possibility
of further drain on that score. The payment
to-day of the dividend on United 8tatea Steel
common, amounting to over $5,000,000, is ex
pected to favorably affect the money market.
Bonds were moderately active and irregular.
Total sales, par value, $2,300,000.

London Market.
NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The approach of the holidays has somewhat
affected business on the Stock Exchange, but
the undercurrent Is good on the expectation of
decisive South African war news soon.
Copper touched Â£4b% the ton on the failure
of William Sargent & Co., a leading firm of
metal brokers. The liabilities are estimated
at Â£100,000. Rio Tlntos closed at Â£40%.
American stocks were quiet early, with not
enough business to test the tone. Then New
York came a buyer, especially of the coalers
and United States Steel, with the result that
there was a general rally and a strong close.
The statement Issued by the Amalgamated
Copper officials is disliked and distrusted.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
4- ; : â -â -*
â¢ ' NEW YORK. Dec. 20.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Retail trade has easily held the'
center of the stage this week.' stimulated, ' as
it has been, by the dual influences of exception
ally cold weather throughout the country and
a â  rather more pronounced holiday demand,
.which promises to be of record-breaking char
acter, not only as to volume, but as to quality
and grade of goods purchased. While Jobbers
in many lines, notably shoes, clothing and rub
ber goods, report a good re-order business grow
ing out of the above conditions, wholesale trade
as a rule has been seasonably quiet, excep
tions' to this being noted in woolen goods,' raw
wools, lumber, leather, coal and last, but by
no means least, iron and steel in a myriad of
forms. The spectacular . feature of B the week
in -prices â  has been the continued marking
down of copper and sympathetically therewith
the drop in tin and lead. '
- Slow but steady accretions In the price of
pig iron are proof of the heavy buying going
on i In the â¢ cruder . forms, which â¢ vies : with : the
active call for bars, sheets.* plates rails * and
structural material among finished products.
Despite the record-breaking, production buyers
are still eager and, the 'familiar car bhortage
cry is heard most loudly In this trade. .-Noth
ing is heard of the usual 'conservative waiting
for the new year's arrival â  to place business,
and order-books of leading producers are filled
for long periods â  ahead. Hardware is 'in' good
demand at most markets. â  .
In speculative staples the cereals have held
a portion of the rally from the low prices struck
last week. Wheat has eased a little- on liqui
dation, absence of bull support and fairly large
receipts. . Visible supplies are no larger than
a year ago, but the export demand Is a little
freer. Corn and oats have sympathized .with
price movements ' within narrow limits. Pro
visions are Irregular, with pork. slightly higher
and lard lower than a week ago. â  â¢
Wheat. Including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 4,332,832 bushels, as against 3,8(9.
809 bushels last week and 4,123,350 bushels in
this week last year. â 
Wheat exports July 1 to date (twenty-five
weeks) aggregate 140.636.547 bushels, as
against 89,084.709 bushels last year.
Reports of rate cutting at the West contrast
strangely with reports of car shortage and In
cidentally returns of earnings which show that
fifty roads earned 8 per cent more in the first
week of December this year than they did last,
while for the second week forty-two roads
show & gain of $500,000 over the middle week
of December, 1900. Again. October gross earn
ings of 105 systems Increased 16.2 per cent on
a total of $119,212,776.
Business failures in the United States for
the week number 262. as against 323 laFt week.
262 In this week a year ago, 211 in 1899 and
212 in 1898.. * -
Canadian failures for the week number 24. as
against 23 last week and 28 in this week a

Dun's Review of Trade.
+ â  _ â : *
NEW YORK. Dee. 20.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Holiday trade reached Its maximum this
week, nearly all sections of the country re
porting exceptional distribution, and while the
class of goods especially stimulated by Christ
mas demand occupied the position of greatest
prominence general merchandise was not far
behind â¢ In activity. Transporting Interests
were Just beginning to overcome congested con
ditions when severe storms- made the situation
more complicated than before.
In the grain market wheat has held fairly
steady at some reaction from last week's ex
ceptionally high point and there is still much
evidence of a firm undertone. Severe weather
stimulated the Western demand for livestock
feeding and also interrupted receipts. Here
tofore this season there has been a large gain
in comparison with the corresponding period of
1900. Higher prices have at last affected the
export movement.
Failures for the week numbered 265 In the
United States, as against 292 last year, and
19 In Canada, as agatnst 18 last year.

for everything they bought. Cables were firm,

According to private advices received from
San Francisco by the New York Journal of.
Commerce the stock of leading fruits, crop of
1001, still left in California, is approximately
as follows: Evaporated Apples, 850 tons, out
of a crop of 2000 tons; Peaches, 2750 tons, out
of a crop of 10,000; Apricots, 600 tons, out of.
a crop of 4500 tons; Prunes, 4000 toils, out of.
a crop of 30.000 tons. This exceptionally fine

cleaned up by the time the 1902 crop came
in. Certainly the market is in first-cla&s
shape, with the best December â¢ business ever

would cause a brisk demand for coal through
other sources, no evidence of this is at present
apparent. Values are unchanged for our coast

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Meats have followed the wholesale market
up and are higher. Beef. Mutton, Lamb and
Veal being the principal sorts affected.
Butter is also rather dearer again, owing
largely to the late cold snap. Eggs remain
about the same.
The summer fruits and vegetables are almost
gone and Apples and Oranges now comprise
the more Important varieties in thÂ» market,
though small quantities of other fruits are
occasionally seen here and there.
Summer vegetables from nearby points arÂ»
disappearing. The supply from thÂ» southern
part of the State, which generally supplies this
market durtng thÂ« winter months, may be con
siderably reduced this season, as the. recent
freeze down south did a great deal of damago
to Green Peas. String Beans and Tomatoes.

FIGHTING TONGS
READY FOR WAR
Break Agreement and
Are Anxious to Open
Hostilities.
Pin Kong Men Fire Bomb in
Defiance of Members of
Four Families.
The fighting tongs of Chinatown are
again on the warpath. Despite the an
nouncement that the Four Families and
the Pin Kong Tong had agreed to call off
their differences and . fcury the hatchet,
both sides are armed to tho teeth and
ready to do battle.
The trouble is over the failure of both
tongs to abide by the agreement which
they signed about a week ago. The Four
Families claim that the Pin Kong Tong
people have not lived up to the agree
ment, Inasmuch as they have failed to
settle with the families of the men whom
they have murdered. Late Thursday
nlg.it the two rival factions met and en
deavored to coma to some understanding.
The Four Families insisted that the Pin
Kong Tong should abide by the peace
terms, mailing it imperative on either
Bide that the families of their victims
should be given a. certain amount of
money. Tne Pin Kong Tong people
claimed that they were unable to pay
the demands, and war was formally de
clared. The agreement which both fac
tions signed was then destroyed and the
renewal of hostilities announced.
Had it not been for the presence of a
special watchman named Jim Meyers a
bloody battle would have ensued. Antici
pating serious trouble after the Four
Families had destroyed the agreement
between the factions. Meyers hustled the
pun fighters out of the " meeting place
after depriving a number of them of their
weapons.
The Pin Kong Tons shortly afterward
called a special meeting of its own peo
ple and the trouble with the Four Fami
lies was discussed. After a long session
it was decided to give battle to the Four
Families, and, following the usual cus
tom of the Chinese in case of war be
tween tongs, a large bomb was exploded
from the headquarters of the Pin Kong
Tong, which was intended to notify their
friends and sympathizers that the war
with the Four Families was on.
In view of serious trouble Captain Sey
mour has detailed Detectives McMahon
and Gibson to keep a strict watch on the
warring tongs and to prevent further
bloodshed If possible. Late 5'esterday aft
ernoon McMahon arrested a Pin Kong 1
Tong man for carrying concealed weap
ons. He was found on Jackson street
wiiii a revolver and a long knife hidden
in his blouse.

Hale Bros. Acknowledge the Injus
tice Done Lady Who Was Charged
With Shoplifting.
Mrs. \V. C. Curtis, the lady who was
charged with shoplifting by a detective
in the employ of Hale Bros., was com
pletely vindicated In court yesterday af
ternoon. Messrs. Campbell, Metson &
Campbell, attorneys for the well-known
dry goods house, signed a statement re
futing the charge against her. This docu
ment was read to Judge Conlan and then
filed. The charge was dismissed. The
statement is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 20. 1001.
To the Honorable Police Court, Department
No. 2, and Hon. Charles T. Conlan, Judge
thereof. City Hall, city â Dear Sir: Having
been employed in the prosecution of this case.
Browing out of the arrest of the defendant,
Mrs. W. C. Curtis, on Saturday. December 7,
11MH by a detective in the employ of Hale
Bros"., doing a retail business at 797 Mar
ket street, San Francisco, would say:
That when the lady was arrested at the coun
ter in the store she had in her hand a new
purse, bearing a tag not yet removed, with
which she seemed to be makin? away, and
another purse was lying on the floor near by;
and when charged with stealing, owing prob
ably to fright or embarrassment regarding the
charge of taking a r.urfe from the store of
Hale Bros, refused to state her name, resi
dence or condition in life or the names of any
of her relatives or friends, all of which seemed
to us at the time to point to the fact that she
was a professional shoplifter. Subsequent in
vestigation Into the matter has convinced us
that the lady's standing and her antecedents
were of the best and that the purse which she
had in her hand with the tag on was her
purse cr.d did net belong to Hale Bros, and
was unlike any purse they had in their store,
and which purse has been this day returned to
her.
Evidently an unfortunate mistake has been
made, and In Justice to all parties concerned
v:Â«? make this statement and move the court
to dismiss the chargfi.

TUNNEL SCHEME
NOT PRACTICAL
Boring Into Telegraph
Hill Is Opposed by
Merchants.
Supervisors' Joint Committee
Acts on Weighty
Measures.
â¢Various matters of p.ublic Interest which
It is proposed to submit to the popular
vote at tho coming election were consid
ered at a joint meeting of the committees
oi: Public Utilities and Judiciary of tho
Board of Supervisors yesterday. There
were present Supervisors Reed, Comte,
Tobin, Connor, Jennings and Braunhart,
Mayor Phelan, ex-Mayor E. B. Pond,
Prank J. Symmes, president of the Mer
chants' Association, and a number of
members of that organization.
The proposed plan of beautifying Tele
gisph Hill and tunneling it was consid
ered. The resolution before the commit
tee provides for raising funds for the ac
quisition of property on the hill by the
city and for the submission of the plan to
the electors. The Merchants' Association
was requested to instruct the cdmmlttee
as to Its views relative to tho matter and
President Symm.es said the hill ought to
be preserved. His organization was op
posed to the tunnel scheme, however, at
this time.
A long discussion then followed in which
Mayor Phelan, B. B. Pond and City En
gineer Grunsky took part. The tunnel
proposition was at length discarded by
the committee on motion of Connor, there
by cutting down the proposed bond issue
to the extent of $167,000.
The matter of cutting down the grade
of Sansome street across the hill was also
discussed. It was decided to postpone
action in this respect for another week.
The resolution to acquire property be
tween California, Pine and Dupont streets
and St. Mary's place for a park, to be
known as St. Mary's Square, was recom
mended for passage, notwithstanding the
opposition of the Merchants' Association,
wheih regarded the proposed' improvement
as unwise at the present time. As certain
real property will have to be acquired the
committee decided to make the sum need
ed for the Improvement $215,000 instead of
$123,000, as was first proposed. If this
proposition receives two-thirds of the vote
of the electors at the special election tha
present St. Mary's Square litigation will
be abandoned.
The proposition of setting aside $1,000,000
for the improvement of streets was ad
versely considered. President Symmcs
stated that no less than $250,000 should be
set aside each year for the repairs of ac
cepted streets. He remarked that the con
dition of the streets of this city was far
below the standard maintained by flrst
ciass cities. . /
A majority of the committee felt inclined
to favor the plan of petting aside each
jear a certain sum for the repairs of ac
cepted streets. The discussion resulted
In the rejection of the resolution to refer
the matter to the people for their approval
or rejection by the following vote:
â Ayes -Reed, Connor.

The Jtdiciary Committee met after the
adjournment of the joint committee and
transacted routine business.
WALSH SAVED FBOM .
BEING A CONVICT
Charge of Burglary Against Him Is
Reduced to Disturbing the
Peace.
John Walsh, a sailor, has been saved
frcm the disgrace of being an ex-con
vict through the kindness of Judge Law
lor. Just before the Judge left on his va
cation a jury in his court brought in a
verdict of guilty against Walsh on a
charge of burglary. His attorney at the
time remarked that if he had thought
for a moment the jury would convict
Walsh he would have asked that they ex
amine the place he was charged with fe
loniously entering.
Walsh was found in a room at 135 Fifth
â¢street on the night of July 29. It was
occupied by Mrs. Nesser, who â was sick in
bed. The gas was turned on and WaJsh
had a small stick in his hand. He was
under the influence of liquor. When ar
rested he *aid he had "done time in Lon
don," but it turned out to be a drunken
man's boast.
The Judge, after Walsh's con%'iction, was
impressed by the remark of his attorney
and personally examined the premises.
He also wrote to Walsh's native place In
Wales and received replies that Walsh
had always borne an excellent character
and had never been in trouble.
A week ago Walsh's attorney moved for
a new trial, and when the case was called
yesterday the Judge said that, consider
ing all the circumstances, he did not be
lieve there was a felonious Intent, but as
a crime had been committed he left the
matter to be dealt with by the District
Attorney. Walsh was taken before Judge
Conlan on a charge of disturbing the
peace and was sentenced to five days in
jail. He has already spent five months
in jail.
COMPROMISE IS EFFECTED
BY THE HENARIE HEIRS
Executors of Estate of Divorced Wife
of Late Capitalist Accept
$40,000.
An order consenting .to the compromise
of the claim of the executors of the es
tate of Mary.B. Henarie against the es
tate of D. V. B. Henarie was made in
Department 9 of the Superior Court yes
terday. This settles the contest of the
will of the late capitalist that has beer,
waged in the courts for the last two
years. The sum agreed upon is $40,000.
Mrs. Henarie- was the divorced wife of
D. V. B. Henarie. After the will was pro
bated she petitioned the courts for a
revocation of Henarle's will, alleging that
she was entitled to the property. Her
claims were opposed on the ground that
when she secured a divorce she received
all of the property she was entitled to.
Failing to win this suit, she filed suits
for an accounting against E. S. Pillsbury
and L. D. Radgesky, executors of the
will, and then appealed to tho Supreme
Court from the decision rendered against
her in. her suit for the revoking of the
probate proceedings.
The suits and the appeal are still pend
ing, as Mrs. Henarie died before they
came up for trial. The compromise made
yesterday, however, disposes of the ac
tions, and in a. few days steps will be
taken to have them dismissed. â -â â¢-

DARING HOLD-UP
ON CLAY STREET
H>Oarrington Wilson Is
Robbed in Western
Addition.
Two Bold Highwaymen Re
lieve Him of His Money
and Jewelry. '
Two daring highwaymen held . up and
robbed H. Carrlngton Wilson In front of
his home at 1819 Clay street about 10
o'clock last night. The robbery was one
of the boldest that has occurred in some
time. The daring knights of the high
way secured about three hundred dollars'
worth of Jewelry and ten dollars In cash
and escaped.' .. '.,
"Wilson, who is well known in local
musical circles, was about to walk up a
short flight of stepa that lead to the front
door of his home when the footpads
swung around Clay street from Van Ness
avenue, where they had beon probably
lying in wait In front of the Spreckles
mansion. Wilson waa attracted by some
remark which one of the men made and
as he turned around he heard. one of the
robbers say, "Go get him, he'll do."
The next moment Wilson was looking
down the glistening barrel of aM-evolver
and the man who held th,e pistol thun
dered out, "Throw up your hands."
Wison thought for a moment that it
was a joke, but when the highwayman
shoved the pistol so close to bis nose that
ho could detect the odor of the oil on the
cartridges he threw up his hands.
The other robber then rifled Wilson's
pockets and took everything that was ne
gotiable. He secured $10, all the money
Wilson had on him. and then turned his
attention to Wilson's gold watch and
chain, which he took wUh as good frace
as if it belonged to him. The man who
searched Wilson forgot to take his dia
mond ring and his "pal," who had Wilson
covered with the revolver, promptly
called his attention to the oversight. The
Ting was quickly removed from Wilson's
finger. The robber next removed Wilson's
gold rimmed spectacles, but his compan
ion advised him to give them back, re
marking that they were not worth much.
While the thieves were going through
Wilson he was perfectly cool. When they
took his silver cigarette case inscribed
with the initials, "H. C. S.," Wilson tried
to joke them into returning it as it was a
much prized gift, but the robbers refused
to give it back.
After rifling Wilson's pockets thorough
ly the men ordered him to go upstairs. Ao
ho ascended the steps the highwaymen
ran up Sacramento street to Franklin,
where they separated.
Wilson watched them until they turned
the corner and then he hurried to the
North End Station, where he reported the
robbery to the police. "Wilson furnished a
good description of the robbers. He said
that the man who rifled his pockets was
tall and wore a mask, while the man who
covered him with the revolver was rather
short and stoutly built. He was not
masked and Wilson thinks If he ever sees
him again he will be able to identify him.
NATION MIGHT
LOSE MILLIONS
Wilson Asks for the Mi
croscopic Inspection
of Meats.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â Secretary-
Wilson to-night stated that discontinu
ance of tho microscopic Inspection . of
meats sent abroad would mean the entire
suspension of exports and lose the United
States the $20,000,000 worth of meats an
nually sent to Germany. > '
The lack of funds, he explained, was
due to the increased work of the past
year and the two weeks' leave of absence
granted each employe of the bureau out
side of this city, which necessitated the
employment of additional men. Secretary
Wilson said he has asked Congress to
make part of the appropriation for the
coming year immediately available, a,nd
that he has no doubt Congress will grant
this authority, as it has done so frequent
ly in previous years. : 1
"I have no doubt," he added, "tnat the
microscopical inspections will proceed,
notwithstanding the notice given the
packing interests through the Bufeau of
Animal Industry."
SERIOUS CHARGE MADE
AGAINST ARMY OFFICER
Captain Donovan Said to Be in Finan
cial Difficulty and Frequently
Intoxicated.
Considerable interest has been aroused
In local military circles by the news from
Washington that serious charges have
been preferred against Captain J. LÂ». Don
ovan. Twenty-second Infantry, who is
now in command of a battalion of casuals
at camp 2 at the Presidio. It is alleged
that the captain was Intoxicated while on
his way to Manila from Columbus Bar
racks, Columbus, Ohio, and was guilty of
conduct unbecoming an officer and a- gen
tleman. It is alleged further that he
habitually overindulges In alcoholic stim
ulants and that he Is very irregular in
meeting his llnancial obligations.
If these charges can be proved it will
mean either that Captain Donovan will
be dismissed from the service of the
United States or at least severely cen
sured and a black mark placed against his
hitherto enviable record. He states that
he has received no official notice that he
is to be court-martialed, but is aware that
something of the kind is In the wind. He
was ordered to Manila, but has been de
tained at the Kresidio.-
The captain has a tine military record.
During the Spanish-American war he was
lieutenant colonel of the Sixty-ninth New
York Volunteers. While in the Philippines
he was shot twice through the leg in a
tierce battle near Cavite. but refused all
profers of assistance and led his company
through the engagement. On several oth
er occasions he has been officially com
mended for bravery. He is well known
in local society and Is a great favorite
with his brother officers. It is stated that
charges have been preferred against him
before, but that his record saved ; him
from a trial. .

Fidelity Lodge No. ( 120, Free and Ac
cepted Masons, last' Thursday night in

was in accordance with the rule in many
of the European countries that no Mason
appear in the lodgerooms, whether at the
ordinary lodge meeting or social function,
unless attired in "the conventional even-
Ing costume.
The officers were Installed in a very im
pressive manner by the retiring master,
Lucius L. Solomons, who had for his
marshal Past Master Gustave Brenner.
The ceremony was watched with much
interest by all and with marked atten
tion. The officials who assumed stations
on that night are: â 
Benjamin L. Stone, worshipful master: Theo
dore Cohn, senior warden; Wallace A. Wise,
Junior warden; Max Goldman, treasurer; Fred
erick Barry, secretary; Newton H. Newstadter,
marshal; Rev. Jacob Nleto, senior deacon:
Charles Schlesslnger, junior deacon; John P.
Albro and T. Trlest, stewards, and M. J.
Meyers, tyler. the latter entering upon his
twenty-seventh year of continuous service In
that office.
At the close of the ceremony Past Mas
ter Rev. Jacob Vqorsanger, on behalf of
the lodge, presented a beautiful Jewel to
Lucius L. Solomons, the retiring master.
The music during the installation was fur
nished by J. R. Ogllvle, J. P. Fleming. J.
R. Jones and R. F. Tilton, the latter pre
siding at tha organ. - â¢ .
There was a grand march to the supper
served in the large banquet hall, where
covers were laid for BOO persons, and
when all were seated there were very
few chairs vacant. The retiring master
was toastmaster. During the discussion
of the excellent supper a number of vocal
selections were rendered, and there was
also a number of instrumental numbera
rendered by an orchestra. There were
addresses by the Reverends Voorsanger
and Nieto, Wallace A. Wise, M. H. Was
ceiwitz and several others.

CHINESE WAR VESSEL
ARRIVES . AT MANILA
Commander of a Cruiser Will Have
a Talk With General ?
Chaffee.
MANILA, Dec. 20.â The Chinese cruiser
(rial Chl has arrived here. Captain Hao.
her commander, says that he has a cruis
ing commission. The object of his call
here is to see General Chaffee, whom the
Chinese consider was the principal friend
of the Chinese among the foreign soldiers
at Peking.
Educated Chinamen, the captain says,
know how much China owes to Chaffee's
Influence with the foreign generals in
1900, and the educated Chinese are being
taught that their- greatest friends among
foreigners are the Americans.
Drew a Revolver.
A well dressed man, accompanied by a
woman, went into John Ottom's grocery
store at 1633 Turk street yesterday after
noon and started to play the nickel-ln
the-slot machine. After getting: a "full
hand" the man demanded that he be paid
in cash, and when Ottom refused the
stranger drew a revolver and attempted
to use it. Ottom grabbed him, and after
a short struggle succeeded in wresting
the pistol from him. The stranger and
the woman then left the store and quick
ly disappeared. Captain Seymour has
been notified of the occurrence.
Newsboys Frighten Companion.
. A practical joke which several news
boys played upon one of their companions
last night about 7 o'clock caused consider
able excitement in the vicinity of Geary

huge redhead firecracker and exploded it
near the feet of John Sears, another
newsboy. The explosion was very loud
and attracted a great crowd of people.

be taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital to be assured that he was not going
to die.

LORD HOPE NEED

Thus Declares the Duke

in Seattle.
Denies That He Is Coming to
Get Evidence Against
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Dec. 20.â In pressing his suit
for divorce from May Yohe. his actress
wife. Lord Francis. Hope may have the
sanction of his family, but he is not get
ting from them much active support. At
least eo declares his elder brother, the
Duke of ' Newcastle, titular head of the
house. The Duke arrived in Seattle to
day, having come down from Vancouver.
He will leave to-morrow morning for Cal
ifornia. The fact that one of the later
chapters of the Hope- Yohe domestic dra
ma was enacted In San Francisco led to
the surmise that the Duke was traveling
on a mission of family Importance. This
he denies.
"You may say positively," said the
Duke of Newcastle to-night, "that I will
not In any way interest myselfin Lord
Francis Hope's divorce case. I came to
the United States with absolutely no oth
er intention than that of spending the
winter In Southern California on account
of ill health."
The Duke's ill health is not conspicuous.
"If there Is any rumor," he continued,
"that I am seeking evidence In behalf of
my brother in his divorce proceedings it
Is false. Neither I nor any other member
of our family will take any part in the
case. It is my brother's affair and he
must care for it himself."
The Duke spoke of the scandal without
embarrassment and also without enthu
siasm.
In discussing the affairs of the British
empire and his home Government the
titled Briton evinced great Interest and
delivered interesting opinions.
. "Of greatest import to both Liberals
and Conservatives," said he, "is the sud
den reappearance of Lord Rosebery in
the active affairs of the Liberal party.
This action on Lord Rosebery's part is no
doubt the result of much persuasion ad
vanced by the /great Liberal leaders.
Since the cessation of his party's admin
istration, in 1895, Lord Rosebery has re
mained entirely, in the background. Al
ways a popular and much admired leader,
his resumption of party control will have
a powerful effect toward â¢ fusion among
the factional ranks of the Liberals. He
is a declared imperialist, and of course
differs from the antl-lmperiallsts. It is
calculated, however, that his known abil
ity as a leader and manager will result
In a united vote at J the Parliamentary
election four years hence. The result of
the move will be of decided interest.
Should It prove successful and a Liberal
Parliament be chosen, the post of Pre
mier will doubtless be proffered Rosebery
by King Edward.
"King Edward has sprung into ready
favor among bis subjects. His adminis
tration so far has been most commend
able." â  . *â¢ r
The Duke says he will spend buWone
day In San Francisco, going on farther
to the south. At the end of winter he
intends to return to his home. Clumber,

Grand Master Meade of New York
Taking Steps to Check a Clan
destine Movement.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â The Press this
morning says: Into New York to-day, as
fast as the service of the New York Cen
tral road can carry him, will come Charles
W. Meade, grand master of the Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, to
take hold with other high officers of a
question of more Importance to Masonry
than any that has confronted it since the
stormy period in l!>28. To-day the order
has before Its officers facts which show
that lodges are being formed by expelled
and clandestine Masons, and that the
right to fellowship may become a com
mercial quantity, degrees being sold to
candidates at so much a head. Men who
have been Initiated in the city of Ntw
York have come forth believing them
selves true In the faith .which has been
taught for so many centuries, and which
has embraced among its followers every
President of the United States from
Washington to Roosevelt.
Grand Secretary Ellis has come out ia
a 'public statement that the Grand Lodge
of Ohio of which Justin Pinney is grand
master Is a bogus institution composed of
expelled and clandestine Masons without
Masonic authority of any kind.
This, it is said, -will be followed by a
strong edict from Meade. Everything
that can be done to prevent the propa
gandists from misleading the people of
New York will be done and every lodge
in the State will be put on its guard
against these clandestine Masons, who
are to be made wholesale at $15 a head
and turned loose upon the public.
Not that alone, but a most rigid investi
gation will be made. It is alleged that
certain men who are Masons are giving
the clandestine movement their counten
ance and support.
CALIFORNIA HAS SECRET
.FOR PRESERVING FRUIT
Samples Exhibited in Paris and Buf
falo Show No Signs of De
â¢ terioration.
France for many years held supremacy
in the art of preserving fruit, but now- it
is conceded that California is in advance
of the rest of the world in the matter of
preserving fruits in solution for exhibition
purposes. J.' A. Filcher, manager of the
State Board of Trade, returned recently
from his labors at tho Buffalo Exposition
and Is now engaged superintending: the
unpacking of massive glass jars of fruits
which won prizes and created an inter
national envy. ,Â» .' A - â¢â ";'-
It is remarkable that the fruit In solu
tion Is coming out, as it is being un
packed, as fresh and perfect as though
just picked rrom the vines and trees,
borne of this fruit was exhibited in Paris
in 1900 as well as fn Buffalo and will now
take its place among the different exhib
its In the permanent display of the Board
of Trade.
Manager Filcher claims that In Califor
nia fruit can be preserved for exhibition
better than anywhere else in the world.
"We have the secret," he said yester
day; "I ' have had a chance of seeing
fruit at thÂ« expositions of Europe and
at all the exhibitions of this country and
I have never seen fruit compare even
favorably with ours. We not only pre
serve it more perfectly, but it seems. to
ptand up better as Illustrated by /the per
fect condition of the fruit now being un
packed.
"I was besieged by foreigners at Buf
falo desiring to, know by what method
the California fruit is preserved. That,
however, is our ; own secret."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A FEW REASONS
Which Are Rapidly Making a Nen
Catarrh Cure Famous.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, the new Ca-
tarrh cure, has the following advantage*
over other catarrh remedies:
First: These tablets contain no co-
caine, morphine or any other Injurious
drug and are as safe and beneficial foi
children as for adults; this is an Import*
ant point when it is recalled that man?
catarrh remedies do contain these verj
objectionable Ingredients. â ; Nv
Next: Being in tablet form this remÂ«
edy does not deteriorate with age or an
exposure to the air, as liquid preparationi
lnvarlablydo.
Next: The tablet form not only pra.
serves the medicinal properties, but It U
so far more convenient to carry and tÂ«
use at any time that it Is only a questios
of time when the tablet will entirely suÂ«
persede liquid medicines as It has al-
ready done in the medical department o)
the United States army.
Next: No secret is made of the compo-
sition of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets; thej
contain the active principles of Eucalyp.
tus bark, red gum. bloodr root and HyÂ«
drastin, all harmless antiseptics, whlcb.
however, are death to catarrhal germi
wherever found, because they ellminati
them from the blood.
Next: You can not cure catarrh by loÂ»
cal applications to the nose and throat
because these are simply local symptom*
and such treatment can not posslblj
reach the real seat of catarrhal disease)
which Is In the blood; for this reason. In-
halers, douches, sprays and powders nev-
er really cure catarrh, but simply glvÂ«
temporary relief, which a dose of plaii
salt and water will do just as well.
Catarrh must be driven out of the ayÂ»
tern, out of the blood, by an Internal
remedy because an internal remedy Is thÂ«
only kind which can bo assimilated InU
the blood-
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do this bettei
than the old form of treatment becaust
they contain every safe specific known tÂ«
modern science in the antiseptic form o*
the disease.
Next: The use of Inhalers, and spray*
Ing apparatuses, besides being ineffectlvi
and disappointing, is expensive, while *
complete treatment of Stuart's Catarrt
Tablets can be had at any drug store is
the United States and Canada for 3
cents.

A GOOD thing to recollect is this: We do not
reckon a sale complete unless the customer
gets all he is entitled to. We give a perfect
sound and undamaged new piano for lesi
money than is often asked for patched uo
and made over instruments, worked off under
all sorts of disguises. It is much better to
get a reliable new piano that is known, than
a bargain ' that is good only for the time
being. Our pianos or customers are not
"wrecked." Ask about our new .plan of
?1 50 per week. We sell Wissner. Decker

ACCUSE BOARD
OF MALCONDUCT
Defeated Union Labor
Party Candidates
File Contests.
Allege That Ballots Cast
for Them Were Not
Counted.
Fifteen of the candidates of the Union
Labor party who were defeated for UuÂ»
office of Supervisor at the last election
filed suits yesterday contesting: the elec
tion of those who were reputed to have
received more votes than they did, and
who will in consequence go into office on
January S.
The contestants allege that the Board of
Election Commissioners and the election
officers at the last election were guilty
of malconduct and counted for their op
ponents votes that were cast for the de
feated candidates. They ciaim that the
number of such votes amounted to three
in each of the 303 election precincts. .
R. W. Roberts, defeated Union Labor
party candidate for the office of Treas
urer, is among the contestants. He claims
he received more votes than the returns
of the election give him and therefore
sues to have John E. McDougald, who de
feated him, disqualified. John J. Daugh
nev, who ran for Tax Collector against
Ed'ward J. Smith, is also dissatisfied with
the returns made by the Election Com
missioners, and is contesting the election
of Smith on the same grounds as the
other contestants. ; â¢
The defeated candidates for Supervisor
who filed contests yesterday are the fol
lowing named:
Charles Calhoun, Rudolph Urbais, H.
McKeritt, Edward L Walsh, James A.
Brien, James C. Aird, John M. Murphy,
Winslow D. Getchell, Washington Kugicr.
Joseph Lyons, Thomas H. Finn, John
Coglan. Joseph F. MeEntee, Charles
Harcourt and Thomas Reagan.
A special session has b<?en called for
January 8 for the hearing of the contests.
They have been assigned to Judge Kerri
gan's court. The attorneys for the con
testants are Pierce and Glllogly.
JUDGE DE HAVEN SAYS
THE SHIP WAS SOUND
Dismisses the Libel of H. Levi & Co.
Against the .British Ship Mare
chal Suchet.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday handed down an opinion dis
missing the libel suit of H. Levi & Co. vs.
the British ship Marechal Suchet et al.
for damages received by a part of her
cargo on a voyage made from. Liverpool
to San Francisco, via Cape Horn. Costs
were awarded to the claimants.
In his opinion Judge de Haven says:
The burden of proof that the vessel was sea
worthy and that the damaee sustained by her
cargo â¢was occasioned by perils of the sea Is
upen the carrier. Seaworthiness is a question
of fact; and upon a careful consideration of the
evidence my conclusion is that the Marechal
Suchet was seaworthy tt the commencement of
the vovage; or, in other words, that she was
in a condition reasonably fit to encounter what
ever perils of the sea a ship of that kind and
laden In the way in which she was, would
fairly be expected to encounter during the voy
age upon which the sailed.

CRUISER PHILADELPHIA SAILS
TO RELIEVE GUNBOAT CONCORD
Will Be the Only Warship in Isthmian Waters
to Guard American Interests.
THE United States cruiser Philadelphia left port for Pan
ama yesterday under rush orders from the Navy Depart
ment at Washington. On her arrival at Panama the Phil
adelphia -will relieve the gunboat Concord, which is to
come north to go out of commission.
On arrival the Philadelphia will be the only United
States warship in isthmian waters, the Iowa having departed
some days since, for the Chilean coast, where she is to dock
and remain pending further instructions. The gunboats Ma
chias and Marietta, which were at Colon on the isthmian
side, have both sailed north, the latter vessel for Nombre de
Dios to keep watch over some American interests there.
The situation at Panama did not require the presence of
a battleship, but a cruiser was needed, hence the orders dis
patching the Philadelphia. It is reported that the Iowa will
return to this city within a short time.
LAWYERS MEET
IN CONVENTION
California State Bar
Association Holds
Session.
The first day of the first convention of
the California State Bar Association was
hela yesterday afternoon in the Maple
Room of the Palace Hotel. Lawyers from
different parts of the State were present
and took part in the preliminary proceed
ings,'for such was the nature of the first
day's programme. The attendance was
no c large, but the interest in the meeting
is expected to grow as the convention pro
gresses. Officers were elected for the en
suing year and delegates named for the
American Bar Association meeting at
Buffalo.
President R. E. Ragland introduced
Mayor Phelan, who welcomed the law
yers.
Hon. Jackson Hatch of San Jose re
sponded to Mayor Phelan. He outlined
the objects of the convention, which com
prehend all matters which will result in
the betterment of legal conditions. He
said that great legal delays have become
a habit in California, in fact so much so
that it really amounted to a denial of jus
tice. He declared that it was a gross out
rage to tax jury fees against litigants.
The State should provide this means of
trial. These are things the Bar Associa
tion should take up. It should also con
sider the elimination of those men from
the bar of California who are not fit to be
members of the association.
R. It. Simpson reported for the member
ship committee. He said there were more
than 100 " members in the association at
present and that the increase was steady
arcl progressive.
President R. E. Ragland delivered an
address in which he reviewed the work of
the association and suggested that all en
deavor be made to facilitate legal pro
cesses in the courts.
The election of officers then took place,
with the following results:
R. E. Ragland, president; Judge E. A.
Bridgford, senior vice-president; W. H.
Jordan, junior vice president; John D.
Works. Frank N. Short, Jackson Hatch,
Judge Van R. Paterson, James H. Deer
ing, trustees;" R. L. Simpson, secretary;
W. J. Herrin, treasurer.
Three delegates were elected to attend
the American Bar Association. They are
H. G. W. Dlnkelspiel, Henry I. Kowalsky
and Professor Nathan Abbott of Stanford
University.
James Parker Hall of the Stanford Uni
versity read a paper on the Insular deci
sions. He went into the history of the
case and followed out, step by step, the
judicial reasoning- which the Supreme
Court employed in its judgment of the two
famous tariff cases. An adjournment was
then taken until this morning, when re
ports from committees will be heard and
an address delivered by Frank H. Short
of Fresno. D. M. Delmas will deliver the
annual address at 2 p. m., his subject be
ing "Justice as a Factor in Economic Con
ditions."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, l^JKC EMBER 21, 1901.
CITY ARCHITECT
IS UNDER FIRE
Mayor Phelan Will Call
on Mooser to Make
an . Explanation.
The attention of Mayor Phelan was
called yesterday to the alleged fact that
City Architect William H. Mooser is
using his official position to advance his
private interests. Mayor Phelan has
been informed of certain acts of Mooser
which he will be called upon to discon
tinue, as they are not in accord with pub
lic policy. A number of architects are
displeased at the * course ' pursued by
Mooser, and it Is probable that concerted
action will be taken on their part to rem
edy the matter.
The Mayor's informant, who does not
wish his, name to appear in the contro
versy, alleges that Mooser has succeeded
in having himself substituted as archi
tect on several buildings now in course of
erection or already erected by represent
ing that the requirements of the building
and fire ordinance would be modified to a
certain extent if Mooser should be em
ployed as private architect. It is said
that on this representation Mooser dis
placed Architect T. J. Welch on the De la
Montanya building, now in process of con
struction at the northwest corner of Pow
ell and Washington > streets. It Is fur
ther alleged that after Mooser assumed
charge the elevator shafts of the building
were built in violation of the lire or
dinance by the use of wooden instead of
iron lathing.
Fire Marshal Towe has made two com
plaints about the violation of the fire or
dinance, but so far without result. Towe
says that his protests are treated with
such scant courtesy by the building bu
reau of the Board of. Public Works that
he will in future refrain from filing any
further complaints.
Another instance quoted to show .that
Mooser is not losing any time while in the
employ of the city government is that of
the erection of a frame building at 112
Front street, which is within the fire lim
its. Application was made by the Demar
tini Company for permission to build the
structure, and it was denied.- A signifi
cant fact is that after the corporation em
ployed Mooser as its architect the frame
building was allowed to be built and is
now completed.
Supervisor D'Ancona introduced a reso
lution at a recent meeting of the Board
of Supervisors which may be a prelim
inary to an investigation of the methods
employed by Mooser in his Joint conduct
of public and private affairs. The resolu
tion calls on the Board of Works to direct
Mooser to give his entire time to his of
ficial duties and to abandon his private
business during his tenure of office. When
Mooser's salary was raised from $100 to
$250 per month, last July, it was with the
understanding that he should comply with
charter provisions, which require the at
tendance of city employes from 8:30 a. m.
to op. m. A sign on Mooser's office door
reads, "Office hours from 9 to 11 a. m."

SECOND MARRIAGE MAY
COST HER A FORTUNE
Widow of Henry Nieman Is Sued by
Guardian of Her Son for '
Henry Eggeling, guardian of Henry
Nieman Jr., filed a suit yesterday against
Mrs. Louisa Franz, formerly Mrs. Louisa
Nieman. for a one-quarter Interest In the
estate of the late Henry Nieman, which
he claims is the property of his ward. He
bases his alaim on the ground that by the
terms of Nieman's will his widow for
feited any claim she might have to one
half ' of. the estate by contracting a sec
ond marriage. '
At. the time of Nieman's death a will
was filed . bequeathing an estate valued
at. $35,000 to his widow. He stipulated,
however, that should she marry again
she should not get more than the share
allowed her by law. Mrs. Nieman re
mained single for two years, and then,
in 1S97,- married Franz. There is another
child of her first marriage who Is entitled
to a qurater interest in the estate. Eggel
ing,; however, is only guardian of one
child and is suing for his share only.
Says They Mutilated a Dead Body.
G. Hatanaka, a Japanese living at 16
Berry place, secured j a warrant from
Judge Mogan yesterday for the arrest of
Dr. Charles Clark and G. Matsumara
steward in the Nippon Maru hospital, on
the charge of mutilating a dead body
without authority of law, which is a fel
ony under section 290 of the Penal Code.
Hatanaka alleges that his brother, Iwak
lsha Imamura, died from pleurisy on De
cember 7, and that while the body lay in
an undertaker's establishment Dr. , Clark
and Matsumara took It away and muti
lated it by cutting the nead off and cut

to be made regarding his fitness for public
duty. - . .
He is well known in the Theatrical Em
ployes' . Association, having been presi
dent of that organization. The members
of this association displayed the greatest
energy and enthusiasm in support of Mr.
Schmftz. He is a member of the execu
tive committee of the Union Labor party,
belonging to what is known as the Parry
faction.
Mrs. Kincaid's Successor.
It seems to be accepted as a settled
fact that Mayor-elect Schmitz will ap
point some man to succeed Mrs. . Mary
Kincaid on the Board of Education. The
gessip goes in political circles that A.
Roncovieri, a musician of some renown
will win the honors and emoluments at
taching: to the office of Commissioner of
Education. There is a strong university
inclination,- passively supported by a
newspaper, in favor of Mrs. Kincaid's re
appointment. The influence invoked on
behalf of Mrs. Kincaid seems to lack po
tency. It is intimated that the newspa
per would not regard the lady's retire
ment from, active work In the cause of
education as deplorable if Charles Wesley
Reed should â  happen to be appointed to
the Board of Public Works.
There is something coming to Thomas
Boyle. The Mayor-elect when he was
plain "Gene" Schmitz entertained a fond
admiration for equally plain Tom Boyle,
and the ardor of that admiration has not
been dulled by the elevation of Schmitz
to the high office of Mayor. It is true
likewise that Boyle was, always fond of
Schmitz. "When the latter was j exalted
Boyle rejoiced and was merry.
The mutual admiration did not escape
the quick glance of Ned Lanagan. When
it was reported that Boyle was slated for
the Police Commission to succeed Judge
Wallace, Lanagan discerned in Boyle'3
physical and mental make-up all the ele
ments of an up-to-date Fire Commission
erâsuch a Commissioner as Rainey could
not mold nor â  Maxwell mislead. . Mayor
elect Schmitz listened with rapture to the
praises of Boyle and began to think with
Danagan that Fire Commissioners were
born and not made. The Mayor-eleqt be
gan to reflect that Boyle would not only
be good as a Commissioner to devise way's
and. means for putting out fires, but as
a newspaper man could see that the fires
were accurately reported. Moreover, it
was taken into consideration that there
would be no trouble in picking out a good
man to succeed Judge Wallace on the Po
lice Board, because the Mayor-elect ' has
been told that twenty-five available men
for that place may be found in the execu
tive committee of the Union Labor party.
The insiders are convinced that Lana
gan's suggestions 'are receiving due con
sideration, and the upshot will be the ap
pointment of Thomas Boyle to the Fire
Commission.. If Asa R. Wells had been
elected Mayor Rainey and Maxewll, who
supported him so zealously, might now
claim the right to name a Fire Commis
sioner, but as Mr. Wells was not chosen
the department may be managed without
their help.

SABIN TO INTRODUCE
IMPORTANT CHANGES
Will Establish Communication "With
Ferryboats and Closer Connec
tion With Oakland.
During his Christmas visit In this city
John I. Sabin intends to make several
Important improvements in the local tele
phone system. Just at present he is ar
ranging to have telephone connections es
tablished with the ferry-boats which ply
between this city, Oakland and Berkeley.
The boats are to be strung with wires so
that the moment they reach a dock on
either side of the bay instant communi
cation may be had with the people in the
city. The telephone wired on thÂ« shore
will remain attached to the wires tin the
boat until the boat leaves the dock, so
tnat a man may communicate with his
friends in the city up to the very moment
of departure. ,
This is not an entirely new venture In
the telephone business. Telephone com
munication with boats has been' in use
for a considerable time in Stockholm,
Sweden. â¢ > . . -
Arrangements are also being made for
closer connection between code subscri
bers in this city and in Oakland. Here
after when a code subscriber wishes to
communicate with the other side of the
bay he will give the operator the simple
word "Oakland." In five seconds the
operator across the bay will reply, "This
is Oakland," and in five seconds the de
sired connection, will be made.
Hello!
The managers of the California North
western Railway Company, ' always look-
Ing for. the latest and best device for the
comfort and convenience of its patrons,
have now installed on its ferry-boats a
complete city and long-distance telephone
system. Passengers who failed to get the
last word before leaving home can now
get It by dropping a nickel and touching
the button, after arriving on the steamer.
Sudden Death of William McKeand.
| William McKeand, a teamster, residing
at 731 Folsom. street, died suddenly ,last
Thursday evening of what was believed to
be ptomaine poisoning'. He had eaten
freely on the previous day of tripe cooked
Spanish style and was taken sick shortly
afterward with severe pains In the region
of the stomach. A physician was sum
moned hastily, and when he arrived the
patient was in a state of collapse and died
shortly afterward.
An autopsy by Morgue Surgeon Baclga
lupi revealed that death had been causeu
by heart disease and that the stomach
was highly inflamed. The stomach and
contents were sent to the City Chemist for
analysis. . . -. --..;-~
