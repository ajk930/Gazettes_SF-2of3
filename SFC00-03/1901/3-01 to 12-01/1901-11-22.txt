CHINESE EXCLUSION CONVENTION OPENS
FIGHT IN DEFENSE OF AMERICAN LABOR
PRESIDENT WILL URGE RE-ENACTMENT OF EXCLUSION LAW.
D. C, Nov. 21, 1901. â Hon. James D. Phelan, San Francisco, Cal.; I have seen the President. I have the best authority for saying that he will not only recom
mend in his message the re-enactment of the Geary law, but will go further and urge that it be made stronger. J, c. NEEDHAM.
CHINESE QUESTION ONE OF" RACE
TyTy E are the warders of the Golden Gate; we must stand
y y here forever in the pathway of the Orient, and if there
is any danger or trial it is for us to sound the alarm.
I regard the Chinese question as a race question. I regard
it as an international question; and above and over all, a
question involving the preservation of our civilisation. The State
of California, with its sezrn hundred miles of seaboard facing
the Orient, is entitled to speak on this question for tlie people of
the United States. â Excerpt from Mayor James D. Phelan' s ad
dress at the Chinese Exclusion Convention.
Leading Citizens Gather to Urge
Re-enactment of the
Geary Law.
IT was a distinctly representative
gathering of business, professional
and laboring men that packed Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon
when Mayor Phelan called the Chi
nese Exclusion Convention to order.
Xearly every seat in the large auditorium
â¢was taken, the lower floor being devoted
to the use of the delegates from all parts
of California, while the gallery was given
up to the general public. All present
seemed to be animated by one impulse,
that of doing their utmost to secure the
re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion act
and thereby prevent the threatened In
vasion of Mongol horclee to the peril and
degradation of American labor.
The gathering was of that character
which lends weight to any public move
ment and the conclusions of which are ac
corded respectful consideration In legisla
tive halls. The convention was not the
outgrowth of political or partisan senti
ment, but of the fear of the people of the
State that the danger which menaces
their advancement and prosperity might,
unless strong measures were taken, be
actually realized. In order that the peo
ple of the East might understand how
the communities on the "Western confines
of the continent feel concerning the un
restricted immigration of Chinese into
their midst, the convention was decided
upon, and it is needless to say that the
memorial which is to be adopted to-day
will prove to be an unanswerable argu
ment to those of the East, who, without
the slightest knowledge of the blight-
Borne characteristics of the Chinese, have
df-clared open sympathy for the coolie
hordes which are only awaiting the ex
piration of the exclusion act in May next
SENATOR PERKINS WOULD CO FURTHER.
/T is our people who pay the taxes that have built up our splendid institutions, and we should
draw the line furtJter, only this is not the time nor occasion. I would permit no one to come into
this country unless he felt as he approaches these shores as Moses did when he approached the
burning bush â that he stood upon sacred ground; and the voice coming out of that bush from the
American people is "Unless you love freedom, unless you believe in republican institutions, unless you
believe in the free public schools, you cannot come into this country." â Excerpt from Senator Perkins'
address before the Chinese Exclusion Convention.
The San Francisco Call.
In order that they may without molesta
tion invade the United States.
Convention Begins Crusade.
Of the 3000 accredited delegates fr*m all
parts of California fully 2500 were present
at 2:15 o'clock when Mayor Phelan rapped
for order. The hall presented a scene of
animation, which the hearty enthusiasm
of the delegates as well as spectators
served to heighten. The hall was deco
rated with the national colors, while over
the platform was suspended a large sign
bearing the words, "Chinese Exclusion
Convention. For Country, Home and
Civilization." Pinned to the lapels of the
coats of the delegates were badges of
white silk suitably inscribed. Side by side
with the farmer sat representatives of
State, national and county governments,
all animated by the one great desire to
protect American labor against the Orien
tal competition which must inevitably fol
low the refusal of Congress to re-enact
the Chinese exclusion law. On the stage
were Mayor Phelan, Mayor N. P. Snyder
of Los Angeles, Senator George C. Per
kins, Lieutenant Governor Jacob H. Neff,
Congressman Frank Coombs, Rev. Wil
liam Rader, Assistant United States Dis
trict Attorney D. E. McKinlay, ex-Sena

Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion; Supervisors J. P. Booth, L. J.
Dwyer, Samuel Braunhart, Charles Box

The issues of the hour were presented
by Mayor Phelan in a strong opening ad
dress. He was received with warmth and
his allusions to the determined stand
taken by California on the Chinese ques

tion were loudly applauded. The people
of this State, he said, had a right to speak"
for the people of the entire union. He
aroused enthusiasm by a vigorous denial
of the story that the sentiment of the
residents of California concerning Chinese
immigration had changed. Were it pos
sible that advantages might be gained by
the peneral admission of Chinese into the
United States the people of California and
of the Pacific Coast would be the first to
recognize and advocate them. The Mayor
declared that the question was a national
one and that the whole people should rise
up against the danger of a Mongol inva
sion.
Geary Chosen as Chairman.
The convention begin business without
delay after the Mayor had finished his
address. The matter of selecting a
chairman was brought up, and Thomas J.
Geary, author of the Chinese Exclusion
Act, was placed in nomination amid a
considerable display of enthusiams. The
name of Mayor Snyder of Los Angeles
was advanced for tho. honor, but that
gentleman respectfully declined, and took
occasion to second Geary's nomination
Mayor Phelan was also placed in nomina
tion, but declined the honor with thanks
Geary was then chosen by acclamation,
and when he advanced to the platform he
was given a hearty ovation. In his speech
of acceptance he referred to the anti-
Chinese exclusion sentiment prevalent in
the East, and expressed the conviction
that the convention would do much to re
move the erroneous impressions concern
ing the Chinese which had been formed
in the territory east of the Rocky Moun
tains. His reference to the strong atti
tude of President Roosevelt in the mat
ter of the re-enactment was hailed with
wild cheers, and cries of "Good bey.
Teddy!" He held that the advancement
of American comraerco was subsidiary to
the advancement of tne welfare of Am
erican labor. The fundamental princlp'e,
he argued, should be recognized that
without labor there could be no com
merce.
Temporary Organization Perfected.
At the conclusion of Chairman Geary's
address, the work of temporary organi
zation was begun. The idea seemed to
prevail among a portion of the conven
tion that politics backed the exclusion
movement, and when H. S. Mason was
placed in nomination for temporary sec
retary, Charles B. gchaeffer of Santa

FRANK L. COOMBS VOICES HIS PROTEST.
A S I understand it, it is because we hare thought that there might prevail in the East some
idea or suspicion that the people of this country zvere not united as they zvere ten years ago
that we have called this convention. And it is your office nozv, echoing the voice, the
sentiment and the majesty of the people of this State, to send in clarion tones to the capital of the
nation your protest, as it zvas your protest of old, against the admission of Chinese further into the
State of California and into the nation. â Excerpt from Congressman Frank L. Coombs' address be
fore the Chinese Exclusion Convention.
WILL REMOVE ERRONEOUS IDEAS
r i HIS convention, meeting at this peculiar time, is to my
J_ mind the most potent instrument that could have been
chosen to manifest to the people of the East that the story
that California has changed her mind upon the question of
Asiatic immigration is at least erroneous, if not absolutely false.
California, through this convention, will tell the people of the East
that she is as loyal as she ever was to her laboring population,
and as determined as ever to protect them against the cheap man
from the East. â Excerpt from Chairman Thomas J. Geary's ad
dress at the Chinese Exclusion Convention.
Strong Addresses in Behalf of the
Laboring People of the
Coast.
WHEN Mayor Phelan called
the Chinese Exclusion Con
vention to order yesterday
afternoon every seat in the
body of the hall and in the
gallery was occupied by dele
gates and spectators.
After calling the convention to order
Mayor Phelan delivered the following ad
dress:
Personnel of Convention.
Fellow Citizens of the State of California:
It 14 my honor as Mayor of this city, pursuant
to & resolution of the Board of Supervisors,
to call this convention to order. It is made up
of our Senators and Representatives in Con
gress, the officials of the State, the counties
and cities of California, of the labor and
trades organizations and of civic society. This
is, in the Judgment of the Board of Supervis
ors, called a representative body, a body
which, when it speaks, will be listened to with
consideration and respect.
The State of California, with its seven hun
dred miles of seaboard fronting tha Pacific,
facing the Orient, is entitled to speak on this
question for the people of the United States.
(Applause.) We may speak, as it were, as
experts. We have had a long familiarity with
this question, and I contend that it is only
those who are ignorant of its true meaning
and significance who would hesitate to Indorse
the position which California has always taken
as a steadfast and patriotic opponent to the
further immigration of Chinese coolies.
It has been said in the East, where a propa
ganda against the re-enactment of the exclu
sion laws has been carried on, that the senti
ment of the country has changed; that even in
California, where, by the way, the Chinese
population, due to the beneficent effect of ex
clusion, has fallen from 76.000, acording to the
census returns in the year IS9O. to about 46.000
in 1900, it has been said that on that account
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
and on account of the opening, as It were, of
the Pacific by the victory of Dewey at Manila
Bay (Applause) that the people of the State
of California have also changed their views;
in other words, that the proponents of Chi
nese immigration have- taken advantage of
the effect of the exclusion law and of the in
terest that we all have in the opening of the i
Pacific, to insidiously, with the assistance of
the Imperial Minister of China at Washing
ton, Minister Wu, and the Imperial Consul
General at San Francisco, Mr. Ho Tow,
impress upon the minds of our Congressmen
and of our editors throughout the broad ex
tent of country ea3t of the Mississippi that it
would be diplomatic, that it would be la tho
substantial interests of this country, and
would be conducive to greater trade to let thÂ«
exclusion act, which has been In force for
twenty years, die by legal expiration. When
we in San Francisco observed that a system
atic campaign was being made for the purpose
of undoing all the work for which wÂ» had
straggled for twenty years, we deemed It nec
essary to call this convention; and I am sure
that none of you will resent the fact that 3*n
Francisco, your commercial emporluci, ha*
taken the leadership In this matter.
Our Commercial Emporium.
San Francisco is a commercial emporium.
It is like all commercial cities, perhaps, when
it comes to a matter of trade, unsentimental:
and it must impress Itself upon the people of
the East that if there is any advantage in
.Chinese Immigration we would not oppose It.
If it brought commerce to our warehouses and
to our marts there would be a very considera
ble element of our population thac would be
active In the demand which every commer
cial city makes for trade and more trade.
(Applause.) Therefore, I say, when San Fran
cisco takes a stand as it took twenty years

ago. when, by a plebiscital referendum, it was
determined that ninety-nine per cent of the
population were against Immigration, it mutt
have an effect such as we design to make upon
the minds of our brethren in the East.
We are the warders by the Golden Gate; we
must stand here forever In the pathway of
the Orient, and if there is any danger or trial
it is for us to sound the alarm. Hence our
meeting here to-day.
The only man who Is In favor of Chinese
Immigration in this city, so far as I know, is
he who believes that labor must be regarded
6imply by Its capacity for work; who regards
production as more important than the char
acter of the population; and who, when told,
as 1 have told them, that the influx of unlim
ited immigration would overwhelm this coun
try and destroy our civilization, give the an
swer, "Well, that Is a long time off, and after
me the deluge." They take none but that
narrow view, and we are here in a charitable
spirit to enlighten their conscience, to impress
upon the people of the East the Importance
and gravity of this question, and to memorial
ize Congress.
There will be read or delivered before you ad
dresses by gentlemen who have carefully stud
ied the various aspects of this question, its
commercial tide. Why, our commerce with
China has increased since 1880, when exclusion
became effective, from twenty-six millions.
the total of our exports and our imports at
that time, to over thirty-six millions, and we
etand second to Great Britain alone, accord
ing to the latest consular reports, in the vol
ume of our trade with China. In spite of our
exclusion policy, therefore, our commerce and
trade have advanced, and our diplomatic re
lations have actually Improved, because it was
due to the magnanimity of this country that
China was allowed to come out of the recent
war with en undivided territory. (Applause.)
In view of all those circumstances, I believe
that great good will come from this conven
tion If these gentlemen who will address you
v.ill confine themselves to facts and to argu
ments. We have men here representing trade,
commerce and labor; we have them represent
ing the mines and the orchards; we have
' them representing skilled and unskilled Indus
try; but, above til we have them here as
American citizen^ representing our institutions
and our civilization. (Applause.)
Various Aspects of Question.
I have taken simply, for your information, a
brief view of the several aspects of the ques
tion. That Is, I regard it as a labor question;
1 regard it as a race question; I regard it as
an international question, and, above and over
all. a question Involving the preservation of
our civilization. That leads you perhaps to
Imagine, from the inviting prospect, that I will
exhaustively discuss these various phases of the
question. That I will not do. But 1 cannot
Impress too strongly upon the convention the
importance of bringing out, as will be done,
these several views.
I The operatives in the cotton mills at Shang
hai are paid upon an average of 20 to 34 cents
a. day in silver, being from 10^4 to IS cents
daily in gold, the workmen boarding and lodg
ing themselves. That is a sufficient argument,
I think, on the labor side of the question to
chow the wages which they receive, as I have
gathered them here, and will submit them to
the gentleman who has that phase of the ques
tion In charge. It runs down the line m all the
Industries of China, showing the very low
wages which are paid. We know in this coun
try that the Chinese came here under the Bur
lingame treaty and worked for very low wages,
end the scale has steadily advanced until they
get now very nearly what is paid to white
workingmea in the various industries in which
Â¦both engage. That is because the Chinese pop
ulation in California has diminished, it has
cone down, due to the migration of these peo
ple to other States. In New York in 1880 there
were about 150 Chinese. To-day there are 7500.
And so in other States. California has made
Jier contribution of Chinese to other States,
and that is the only reason why she should
Buffer at the hands of other States and their
representatives. But the Chinese are free to
move when once they come into this country,
and they have, fortunately for us, emigrated to
other States.
; A great argument has been made that It Is
the productiveness which would come from the
employment of cheap labor that would give
this country an economic advantage in the mar
kets of the world. That can be easily answered,
when we remember that the productive energy
of the American people to-day Is greater
per capita than the productive energy of the
people of other countries (applause); that ma
chinery which is due largely to American In
vention has been the cause to a great extent
of that productiveness, and that if we progress
â¢c we have progressed in that direction cer
tainly we will have all we can do to take
care of our surplus products to -prevent over
production and stagnation.
There are in this country to-day, you know
bout 76.000,000 of people. If we increase at
the rate of 12 per cent per decade", which is
reasonable, we will have nearly 230,000.000 of
people in the United States in one hundred
years. Our inventive genius and constant im
provements being made In machinery will
greatly, therefore. improve our per capita pro
ductive capacity and enable us to increase our
wealth and hold our own in the markets of the
world. We certainly are doing it now. and no
doubt can continue to do It and at the fame
time preserve the character of our population
That is the great question, towering above
even the question of laborâ the race question
It has been said that the South will vote
against us on the question of Chinese immi
gration on account of racial difficulties there
But the South has had its lesson on the race
question, and will It Inflict another race ques
tion upon the country? It would be accusing
the South of a lack of interest in the success
or the American republic to say so. They are
solving their race question as best they "may
Their solution of It may not be a good solu
tion: but they are afflicted, as the result of
ela very In the early days of Its development
there, with a great evil, which certainly every
â¢well-wisher in this land desires that they be
relieved of. They are Buffering the conse

tarlly. They are attached to their native land,
and they come here under contract. The peo
ple East are resisting now, through Immigra
tion laws, the importation of a servile or an
Inferior race. From every country come men
who are sent back from Castle Garden to the
old lands because they come, lf you please,
under contract, or can show no means of sup
port. They on the Eastern coast are strug
gling with a question compared to which the
Chinese question is of so much importance that
when that fact Is presented they will certainly
yield to our demands.
It seems to me perfectly Idle, were I not fa
miliar with the conditions ln the East, to argue
this question, but the newspaper reports during
the last two months from almost every center
bring news printed in their columns and edito
rial expressions, showing a condition of the
mind of the East which is inimical to the in
terests of this country on this question of Chi
nese immigration, and it is our duty to address
ourselves, politely but firmly, to these gentle
men and create a public sentiment which will
certainly reach the halls of Congress. It is the
most potent instrument we have ln this free
country of creating a sound public sentiment,
and 1 know of no better way than through
this convention, called here by official author
ity and representing in its composition the be&t
interests of the State of California, the State
most familiar with the question and most ex
posed to its dangers. (Applause.)
It is now in order for this convention to effect
a temporary organization. I may say that no
arrangements have been made in that respect.
There are many distinguished gentlemen who
have come from all parts of the State who, no
doubt, are eligible to service, and nominations
will now be in order for temporary chairman.
GEAEY MADE CHAIRMAN
OF THE CONVENTION
Author of Chinese Exclusion Law
Tells Why It Should Be
Re-enacted.
After the conclusion of Mayor Phelan's
address nominations for temporary chair
man were declared to be In order. "Mayor
Snyder of Los Angeles was placed in
nomination. Thomas Geary, author of
the exclusion act, was named and the
nomination was received with cheers.
Mayor Snyder in withdrawing his name
said there was only one man who should
preside over the body and that man was
Tom Geary. This announcement was also
greeted with hearty applause. A repre
sentative of the Stonecutters' Union
nominated Mayor Phelan, but the latter
gracefully declined in favor of Mr. Geary.
Upon motion the nominations were de
clared closed and Mr. Geary was selected
temporary chairman by acclamation. Mr.
Geary took the platform amid enthu
siastic cheering and was introduced to the
assemblage by. Mayor Phelan.
Mr. Geary's address of acceptance fol
lows:
Fellow-citizens of California: I am deeply
grateful to you for the honor you have shown
me. I feel that it would be idle for me to at
tempt in words to thank you or to show my ap
preciation for the honor you have conferred
upon me. . .
This convention, meeting at this peculiar
time, is to my mind the most potent instru
ment that could have been chosen to manifest
to the people of the East that the story that
California has changed her mind upon the
question of Asiatic immigration is at least
erroneous. if not absolutely l false. These peo
ple have been deceived to think we have under
gone a change. -â¢ Because for . several years the
State has been saved and freed from a need
less agitation of this question was not evidence
that we. had undergone a change of sentiment,
but that we appreciated the tact that the evil
we had been complaining of was being reme
died, and we were satisfied. California,
through this convention, will tell the people of
the East that she is as loyal as ehe ever was
to her laboring population, and as determined
as ever to protect them (cheers), not only by
preventing the introduction of the products
of the cheap man. but will prevent the intro
duction of the cheap man himself. (Renewed
cheers.)
It is not necessary, in my opinion, to makÂ» a
speech upon this question to this conventioneer
to any assemblage of Callfomians. From the
experience of the past we know the lesson too
well to need its repetition to us. But to the
people in the East, providentially saved from
the experience that has been ours, we owe to
them a duty that we shall give to them the
lesson, that they may be warned in time to
avoid the danger that we have been combating
for years. We owe it to those people that we
shall place before them a fair, reasonable, can
did, temperate statement of what we know
about this race during the time it has sojourned
in our midst. There is no room here and this
is no place for abuse or vituperation. We must
recognize conditions as we find them. Through
out the Eastern States we shall find in many
sections bitter opponents of this class of legis
lation, and those people honestly believe that
they are right and we are wrong, and we must
labor with them and convince them of their er
ror before we can have their assistance and
support. (Applause.) We shall find there or
ganized combinations anxious to defeat ex
clusion from selfish motives. With them we
can do nothing. But they, happily, represent
but a small portion of the people of the United
States because I believe throughout all sec
tions of the East there is that careful regard
for the rights of American labor that you need
but show them that this exclusion is necessary
to secure it. *
Our position on the Chinese question some of
these people would represent as being purely
peculiar to California. There never was a
greater error. Our experience has been the ex
perience of every other portion of the earth
where the Chinese have gone In number! Aus
tralia all of . the British possessions, have
passed exclusion laws as we have. All of the
republics to the south of us have complained
about the presence of these people. In the same
year that the act which is now about to Â£!
pire was passed far-away Brazil passed a law
upon the same lines. All classes of people in
all climes, recognize the undeslrability of the
Asiatic as a citizen or a laborer
We are not. In my opinion, going to have an
easy contest, no matter how easy it may be
made to appear now. We must prepare for
the greatest battle, in my opinion, we hive
ever had, in order to preserve the advantages
which we now possess, because conditions that
have presented themselves have altered the
situation during the past year and give excuse
for argument that we will have to meet and
combat. I have no fear but what the California,
delegation in Congress to-day Is as effective
and as earnest and will do as able work for
their people as any delegation ever did in the
past; but we must help. It is not fair to expect
them to do it all. And on this convention will
devolve the work of aiding our representatives
so that exclusion may be made certain. tt " veÃ

pects of this difficulty which we must meet.
1 am not a pessimist in the matter of trade
expansion, but from the knowledge I have of
the Chinese people and Chinese industry I can
not unite with these people who fancy that in
the future China Is to be a great market for
American products. Before any people can be
great customers they must have something to
exchange, and at the present time China, locked
up in the conservatism of centuries, unwilling
to develop her own material advantages, offers

the Chinese; in other words, for commerce we
must betray the happiness and the welfare of
the white American laborer. Commerce at that
price costs too much. We will have our share
of the commerce of China, but we win get It
without sacrificing the happiness or welfare of
one single white American toiler in this land
(Applause.) Labor has no opposition to the
expansion of commerce. No people in this
country are more Interested in enlarging the
trade of the United States than the men who
toil in field and farm. In factory and in shop
and create. the things which are to'be the In
struments of commerce or carry on exchange
Every market opened for : the product of the
American factory or farm Is an Increase of the

us understand or believe that there must be
an antagonism between labor and. commerce

fident that ln the superiority of our production.
In the Intelligence and integrity of our laborers,
in the Increased efficiency, the immense differ
ence in the product, we can conquer all other
peoples who oppose us. industrially or other
wise. (Applause.)
You are going to have a whole lot of speeches
and I don't like to take up any more of your
time. (Cries of "Go on; go on.") It is getting
late and there are a lot of other gentlemen
to address you. I thank you again for the
honor you have conferred on me and only hope
to merit the confidence you have shown by my
conduct in presiding.
TWO SECRETARIES ARE
CHOSEN FOR CONVENTION
Temporary Organization Is Per
fected After Some Wrangling
Among the Delegates.
Despite cries to go on, Chairman Geary
declined and said that the next order of
business was the nomination of temop
rary secretary. Edwin E. Leake of Wood
land nominated H. S. Mason for the of
fice. Charles B. Schaeffer of Santa Clara
was nominated. To avoid delay Super
visor Braunhart moved that both men be
elected temporary secretaries. This was
done by the convention.
G. A. Cutler of San Francisco made a
motion that a committee on credentials
be appointed. His motion was declared
to be indefinite in that it did not state
the number to be selected. Ex-Governor
James H. Budd offered an amendment to
have a committee on memorials, resolu
tions and platform consisting of five from
the State at large and three from each
Congressional district.
An objection was made to the amend
ment by a delegate, who moved that the
rollcall presented by the secretary of the
convention be accepted as the rollcall of
the convention. The motion was lost, as
was also Governor Budd's amendment.
The original motion presented by Mr.
Cutler as amended to have five delegates
appointed a committee on credentials was
adopted.
While Chairman Geary was debating on
his selections F. E. Johnson of Napa
made a motion to have fifteen appointed
to act as a committee on permanent or
der of business and organization. The
motion was declared out of order.
The following gentlemen were appointed
a committee on credentials: G. A. Cut
ler, G. E. Rosenberg, C. A. Dunbar, Kirk
Hall and E. J. Emmons.
Mr. Johnson renewed his motion to
have the committee of fifteen appointed
and another storm of disapproval fol
lowed and It was lost. Governor Budd
renewed his motion to have a committee
on memorials, platforms and resolutions
appointed. Certain delegates evidently
feared that there was a movement on foot
by certain persons to secure control of
the convention. They therefore objected
to the. motion. Despite their protests the
motion prevailed.
CALIFORNIA UNITED ON
QUESTION OF EXCLUSION
Senator George C. Perkins Urges the
Convention to Do Its Duty
Fearlessly.
While the committee on credentials was
engaged in examining the list of dele
gates Chairman Geary called upon Sena
tor George C. Perkins to address the con
vention. The Senator was warmly re
ceived and spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and fellow r citlzens of Califor
nia: Your chairman came to me and said,
"We are old friends, Perkins, and I am in a
dilemma. I want you to say something to en
courage me and engage the attention of the
convention while I am selecting this very im
portant committee." Having served in Con
grress with him, and knowing his genial and
good-hearted nature, how could I do otherwise
than favorably respond to his request? And yet
in doing so I am very good to myself, because
I have the pleasure of meeting here to-day
so many representative citizens of this glorious
State of California, coming from every county
in the State, representing every industry, com
ing here without collecting any mileage, as all
of your Congressional delegations collect It,
paying your own expenses, because you are
patriots, because you believe in California, be
cause you believe in your homes. And you are
here to show by your voice and your acts that
you believe in American institutions and the
dignity of American labor. (Applause.) So it
Is to me a great pleasure and satisfaction to
be present here to-day.
It Is not necessary for me to tell you how I
stand upon this or any other public question
that has been so long before the public as the
Chinese exclusion act has. I have grown up in
California, and I have always been on the
side of the Caucasian race, because they are
the best people God ever made (Applause) ; and
therefore, if we are not true to ourselves we
are not true to our country and our homes.
Friends, this is not a political nor a partisan
question. I would like to coin a new name for
this splendid assembly of representative men,
and I think the name that suggests itself to
me is, American ideas of government. Ameri
can ideas of government; that means patriot
ism, it means love of republican institutions.
it means that our forefathers, the grand old
citizens of this country, crushed out human
slavery, and they said that no longer shall
servile labor, contract labor, which is worse
than slave labor, come in here to compete with
the dignity of labor. (Applause.) The Ameri
can idea of government means the greatest good
to the greatest number. It means in this con
vention that we are opposed to the introduction
of Asiatic and Mongolian labor because it pulls
down and degrades the dignity of labor. (Re
newed applause.) It means that the Chinese
are a non-assimilative race, that they come
here, get what they can, and go away with it.
They have no family, no home, they do nothing
to benefit our country; therefore they are a dis
ease upon the body politic, and we would not
be true to ourselves, true to our country and
our State, if we did not take this action. And
I want to thank the authorities of this great
city, this great metropolis of the West, for
having inaugurated the plan of calling to
gether this representative convention of people
irom every part of our State. Your Congress
men, your Representatives in Congress, have
only one vote, only one voice that we can use
there in presenting your wants. And already
there is an undercurrent of sentiment coming
to us that the extension of this Chinese ex
clusion act will not be smooth sailing for us.
There are great Interests in this country, there
are interests in the Hawaiian Islands that are
crying out tor servile contract labor, and It is
our duty by this very act which you are doing
here to-day to say, "No, you shall not come
into thia country to compete with tree Ameri
can labor." â¢
I have received any number of letters, even
in California, in which the writers say, "Per
kins, we are opposed to Chinese coming ln,"
and I want to say this parenthetically, they
are not going to attack the extension of the
Chinese exclusion act and advocate the incom
ing ot the Chinese into this country; they are
going to move in an insidious, underhand way
by Baying, "No, we are opposed to Chinese im
migration, they all go back hume; you say they
have come here as contract laborers under one
of the Six Chinese Companies; they make a
contract that they shall be taken back home
again, and that if they die their bones shall
be taken back to China. So we say let this
law rest for two years, and then they can come
in for that time, there will only be a very few
of them here; let them come in, and they will
not come back again, and two years hence we
will re-enact the law." That is one of their
plans.
Another plan Is to put the limit at 200,000
Chinese, and when it reaches that number no
more shall come In. Then they have another
plan that will appeal to our Eastern friends
who are friendly to us and who are opposed
to Chinese immigration; that is that adopted
by the Dominion of Canada, by British Co
lumbia, which places a head-tax of $100 upon
every Chinaman coming into British Columbia
or Canada, and prohibits any vessel from
bringing more than one Chinaman for every
fifty gross tons of that vessel. That looks
feasible; it looks easy. Why should any one
object to bringing in such a few Chinamen as
that number would be ln these vessels? And
then we would get ?100 tax for each.
But, my friends, to-day the Japanese have
one of the finest marine eteamahip companies
afloat, and they are bringing immigrants from
the Orient into British Columbia, and will
bring them by the score into California and
the ports on the Atlantic. There are Chinese
building ships, and they will bring that peo
ple here. And to-day there are American
ships that are working the Chinese ln their
nrerooms as firemen and as coal passers, ln
their stewards' department, paying them but
from $10 to $15 a month as the maximum,
when our Americans, who have their families
here, who have their homes here, who pay
taxes here, are receiving, as they ought to re
ceive, from $36 to $60 a month. (Applause.)
How can we compete against that class of la
bor, that class of navigation?
And so I want to say to this committee
whom Governor Budd has suggested so prop
erly should be selected from the different Con
gressional districts of our State, that I hope
that in their memorial they will take up and
consider all these phases of this great ques
tion, and not be misled when a few orchard
lsts who have an individual Interest say, "Our
fruit is going to decay because we can't get
labor to preserve It." I want you to get on a
higher plane and cay that we don't want fruit
cured or dried or put Into the market or
canned or sold unless it is canned by Ameri
can boys or American men. (Applause.) It Is
our people that pay the taxes that have built
up our splendid institutions, and we should
draw the line further, only this is not the time
nor the occasionâ l would permit no one to
come into this country unless he felt as he ap
proached these Bhores as Moses did when he
approached the burning bush, that he stood
upon sacred ground; and the voice coming out
of that bush from the American people speak
ing Is, "Unless you love freedom, unless you
believe ln the free public schools, â¢ you can' t
come into this country. (Great applause.)
I want to carry this message back to my
colleagues in Congress and say to them that
the people of California to-day stand just
where they did twenty years ago, when,
through the Legislature which provided the
referendum, it was left to the people to give
an expression on this question of Chinese Im
migration, and there were but 883 votes cast
In favor of admitting the Chinese immigrant
into this country, and there were 154,386
against it. (Applause.) That is the sentiment
of the people to-day, and your delegation In
Congress stands shoulder to shoulder to carry
out the wishes of the people of this great
State. But we want your help, we want your
co-operation; and I know the memorial and
the resolution you will adopt will supply It,
because the electric wires will send It across
the continent, and It will say to our frienda
ln the East that the people of the great Pacific
Coast States are a unit ln this question. They
ar: the power ln the land and we can no
longer hesitate, but we will stand in with
them and re-enact the Chinese exclusion act.
(Applause.)
I will not weary you, my friends. We have
our Congressmen and others here who wish to
speak. I only want to say again and again
to you that we are the same after election as
we were before It. We said then that we
only wanted to be the servants of the people, to
do that which would meet with your approval,
to carry out your wishes, and if we do that
the highest encomium any one can receive is
the approval of his fellow citizens.
REMOVAL OF CHINATOWN
URGED BY A. SBARBORO
Strong Address by President of Man
ufacturers' and Producers'
Association.
"The next address was delivered by A.
Sbarboro, president of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association. He presented
the Issue as it affects the people of
San Francisco, and particularly urged the
removal of Chinatown. His address in
full was as follows:
Mr. President and Members of the Conven
tion: Once more we are called on to take
measures to defend our State from the threat
ened Chinese invasion. Every important county
in Calitornia is here represented by delegates
chosen from its legislative, commercial and In
dustrial organizations. California is vitally in
earnest over this question of Chinese exclusion,
for California knows better than any other
part of the country the seriousness of unre
stricted Chinese immigration. The citizens of
this State are determined that the blighting
experience of the past shall not be repeated,
if effort on our part can prevent it.
The Chinese began coming to this country
upon the discovery of gold ln California with
other peoples from all parts of the world. It
was not long before it was found out that
the Chinese were an undesirable race. I re
member taking part ln the formation of anti-
Chinese clubs in every district of San Fran
cisco as early as 1860. Tor thirty years this
agitation against the admission ol the Mongol
was kept up and the people of the Pacific
Coast almost unanimously appealed time and
again to Congress for a relief from the in
pouring of the Chinese to California. Finally
Congress listened to our prayers and passed
the Geary exclusion bill, which, although it
did not entirely keep out Chinese laborers,
served to limit them to such a number as to
modify the harm to our people, and let me say
right here that the State of California owes
Mr. Geary an unpaid debt of gratitude for the
most valuable services which he rendered to
the State and to the Pacific Coast.
The force of this bill will soon exnlre and
unless the next Congress re-enacts this meas
ure we will soon again be flooded by hordes of
Chinese, a disaster of terrible menace to the
peace, harmony and happiness of the people
of California.
All the evils which caused the passage of
the Geary bill exist to-day and they exist
more strongly than ten years ago. We have
had now fifty years of experience with the
Chinese among us. The more we know of them
the more we see the necessity of excluding
them from our shores. Other speakers will
enumerate the many reasons why we object
to Chinese immigration. Let me point out
only a few of them. The Chinese, as has been
proved by decades, take back with them to
China all the property accumulations which
they make in this coun'ry and leave us only
their vices and diseases.
They dwell among us in filth. They have
made in the center of this fair city a dis
trict tha very name of which is synonymous
with disease, dirt and unlawful deeds. They
defy our laws, they gamble in hundreds of
barred dens; they make a business of murder
and they give us nothing but evil habits and
noxious stenches.
Dr. Williamson, ln his annual report to the
Board of Health, says that Chinatown should
be removed. I fully agree with him. He says
further:
"Chinatown, as it is at present, cannot be
rendered sanitary except by total obliteration
It should be depopulated, its buildings leveled
by fire and its tunnels and cellars laid bare
Its occupants Bhould be colonized on some dis"
tant portion of the peninsula, where every
building should be constructed under strict
municipal regulation and where every violation
of the sanitary laws could be at once de
tected. The day has passed when a progres
sive city like San Francisco should feel com-

would result in the degradation and de
struction of American labor. The Sena
tor went on to say that he would dra*
the line on all immigration to this coun
try, and say to the nj.vcomers that they
were on sacred ground, and that if they
did not believe in freedom, our public
schools and all of our institutions, they
should not be permitted to land on our
shores. He was followed with a strong
speech by A. .^harbor.;, in which the râ
moval or Chinatown from the heart of
San Francisco was earnestly urged. Mr.
Sbarboro's remarks were punctuated at
intervals by warm applause.
Thanks to the President.
Numerous telegrams from Governors of
Pacific Coast States and other officials
were read by Secretary Mason. Thest
were from Governor T. T. Geer of Ore
gon, Governor J. R. Itogtli of Washing- |
pelled to tolerate in its midst a foreistn com
munity, perpetuated in filth, for the curiosity
of tourists, the cupidity of lawyers and Ihe
adoration of artists."
Dr. Williamson Is an authority on these mat
ters. He has devoted years and serious study
to them.
The taxpayers of thl3 city will soon be called
upon to vote millions of dollars for schools,
hospitals and other improvements. Gentlemen,
there is no betterment that this city can pro
cure which is more an urgent necessity than
the removal of Chinatown to the southern end
of San Francisco.
We know the curse that the Chinese have
brought among us, but unfortunately our fellow
citizens residing east of the Rocky Mountains,
not being inflicted with any large number of
Chinese immigrants, do not understand the
detriment that these Chinese laborers are to the
country in which they settle and therefore do
not sympathize with our cause. It i 3 owing
to this lack of knowledge of the fact 3 that we
are in danger of losing the protection given to
us by the Geary bill.
I understand that many of our Eastern mer
chants labor under the fal.se impression that
by the renewal of the exclusion bill their trade
with China will be materially decreased, or
that Its growth would be stunted. In answer
to this argument I have prepared a few sta
tistics which I trust will convince this busi
ness element of the East of its error.
The Chinese Minister. Wu Ting Fang, ln a
recent address marte in Philadelphia, said:
' "Since the opening of my country to foreign
commerce fifty years ago China's trade with
the United States has been steadily increasing.
Go back no further than 1891 (one year before
the date of the passage of the Geary bill), you
will find that the volume of trade has increased
rapidly every year. Gratifying as these figures
are they will not stop here, but the commerce
between America and China will continue to
advance every year."
From the monthly summary of commerce of
the United States in the Bureau of Statistics
of the Treasury Department under date of
June, 1901, we learn that the principal exports
from the United States to China are drills,
Jeans, sheetings, flour and kerosene; that two
of the largest imports into Hongkong are from
the United States, namely, flour. 100,000 tons,
which is an increase of 41,000 tons over the
previous year, and kerosene, 67.000 tons, which
has held its own since 1890 against the deter
mined attempts of Russia to capture the mar
ket with a cheaper and inferior article.
We further learn from the same authority
that the Imports from the Un'ted States to
China in 1882 were $4,400,000. Afer 1882 there
was no marked Increase until IS3I am! 1893 and
thereafter, following the passage of the Geary
act.
In the year 1837 the value of the Imports was
$9,700,000, and in 1839 $16,000,000. In 1900, not
withstanding the heavy falling off owing to
the war. we exported $11,700,000 worth of goods,
against an average of one-half that amount
previous to the passage of the Geary bill.
Certainly this showing should refute any as
sertion that the re-enactment of the Geary
bill would Interfere with the commerce be
tween the United States and China. Gentle
men, as a business man. I am free to state
my belief that the merchant, be he from China
or from any other part of the world, does not
exist who will not purchase from the people
of the country where he can obtain the best
article at the lowest price and who will not
Fell to the people of the country which will
pay him the best price for his wares. Fur
thermore, we buy a great deal more from China
than China buys from us, so that, even lf
such a thing as sentiment in trade was pos
sible, the Chinese merchants would still remain
our customers, as they have far the best of
the bargain.
I sincerely hope that our Eastern brethren
will ree that they have nothing to lose by aid-
Ing ua In the passage of this bill. By helping
us with it they will not only advance their own
interests, but they will cement still more
strongly the bonds of friendship which now
exist between the people of the East and the
people residing on the border of the great Pa
cific.
The State of California wants Immigration;
we need mor; Deople. Here we can maintain
20.000.0 CC or 30.000.C00 inhabitants, while we are
barely 1.5*10.000 souls. But, gentlemen, we want
people who will help to upbuild the States; no
coolies who are a detriment to every country
they Invade.

Voices in Appeal to Con

Congressman Frank L. Coombs was In
troduced by â¢ Chairman Geary and when
the applause subsided he delivered the
following' address:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the* United
Chinese Convention: I congratulate you upon
! assembling in order that you might make
; manifest through your voices the sentiment of
the people of the Pacific Coast, and I hope
that it will re-echo the sentiment of the peo
ple of the United States upon the Chinese
question.
As I understand It, It Is because wa have
thought that there might prevail in the East
some idea or suspicion that the people of this
country were not united as they were ten
years ago that we have called this convent!
And it is your office now. echoing the voice,
the sentiment and the majesty of the people
of this State, to send in clarion tones to the
capital of the nation your protest, as It was
your protest of old, against the admission of
Chinese further into the State of California
and into the nation.
I have read in the papers and heard here
discussed to-day considerably the question of
commerce. It has been set forth that a re
striction of Chinese immigration might ope
rate to the disadvantage of the great com-*
merce for which the grand Pacific opens up a
splendid and glorious future. Upon that sub
ject I desire to say that it seems to me. and
It has always seemed to me. that the ques
tion of human slavery, as evidenced by thÂ«
Chinese in the past, does not tend to pro
mote nor does it tend to hold back commerce
and its development. It Is regulated by an en
tirely different proposition, by entirely differ
ent motives, by entirely different International
communications and privileges. Yet above
it all. my fellow-citizens. it Is to be found

sion of the United Textile Workers of
America to-day the convention completed
the new constitution by which the differ
ent organizations of textile workers have
been united and are to be governed he're
sifter.
A number of resolutions on subjects of
national interest were adopted. Including
the following: Condemning the ship sub
sidy bill as "the worst form of class leg
islation in that it propofes to tax all the
people for the benefit of syndicate dic
tated interests whose overflowing coffers
show that they are abundantly able to
take care of themselves"; "that we stand
by the doctrine of 'equal rights to all and
special privileges to none,' and oppose all
forms of subsidies and gratuities to pri
vate Interests"; asking that Congress
strengthen and re-enact the Chinese ex
clusion law. Including in its provisions all
Mongolian labor, and, urging the passage
by Congress of a law forbidding the im
migration into this country of persons 15
years of age and upward who cannot
read the English language or some other
language.
Hunter Is Killed in a Fight.
MIDDLESBORO, Ky., Nov. 21.â 1n a fight
with Virginia hunters who crossed the
line into Tennessee one man was killed.
The law does not permit game to be car

ASK REDUCTION
OF THE WAR TAX
Distillers and Brewers
Prepare an Appeal
to Congress.
â¢Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â Indications
show that the whisky distillers intend to
make a tremendous effort this winter to
have their tax reduced from $1 10 per gal
lon to 70 cents. The stake for which they
are playing amounts to something like
$60,000,000. The distillers at present have
in bond in this country 148,074,491 gallons
of whisky. According to Commissioner
of Internal Revenue Yerkes it is dis
tributed as follows: In distillers' ware
houses, 145,273,815 gallons; in general
bonded warehouses, 1,284,647 gallons, and
in special bonded warehouses, 1,516,029
gallons. This for this time of year is
an unusually large amount of liquor in
bond and should the distillers prevail on
Congress to reduce the revenue tax they
would make a saving of very nearly $60,
00,000, a sum worth fighting for.
An effort will be made by the distillers
to come together on some common ground
before any effort is made with Congress
itself. Once united on a plan of action
the different forces will work together
and use every effort with Congress for a
reduction, using the argument that the
reason no longer exists for war taxes and
that the request to be put on the old basis
is nothing more than just
The brewers will fight for a stake of
$24,000,000, based on the manufacture of
beer last year, which amounted to 40,000 -
00 barrels. They ask for a reduction of
the tax from $1 60 to $1. The distillers and
brewers have been unable to unite and
they will flght their cases separately. The
stock brokers of the country will also
make a strong effort to have the war tax
on the sale of shares removed. A dele
gation from the Consolidated Stock and
Petroleum Exchange of New York called
on the President to-day and presented the
resolutions of the directors urging the re
peal of the war revenue measure requiring
a stamp tax on the sale of shares or cer
tificates.
Chairman Payne of the Ways and
Means Committee is known to favor a
substantial reduction in the war revenue
and those who are fighting for the old
conditions before the Spanish war rely on
him for assistance.
TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
Police Accuse Them of Being Con
nected With a "Green Goods"
Swindle.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â John B. Bert
holf, manager of the Eastern division of
the Western Union Telegraph Company In
Jersey City, N. J., was arrested to-day on
the charge that he has been carrying on a
"green goods" business. The complaint
was made by Chief of Police Murphy. The
police have several circulars sent to the
South and West and claim they can show
that the telegraphic replies of prospective
victims went direct to Bertholf.
Isaac Kershaw, a telegrapher, who
transmitted some of the telegrams al
leged to have been received by Bertholf
and gave the police the statement against
him, was also arrested on a charge simi
lar to that found against the manager.
Bail was fixed at $1000 in each case.
COLOMBIA
APPEALS TO
UNCLE SAM
Asks That Communica
tion Across Isthmus
Be Maintained.
Secretary Hay Gives Prompt
Assurances That Treaty
Will Be Upheld.
After Taking Colon the Insurgents
Are Very Careful Not to Dis
turb the Interests of
Foreigners.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.-A formal
' appeal was made to Secretary Hay to- |
j day by Herrarv, Colombian Charge d'Af- j
! faires, that the United States observe" its j
treaty stipulations and maintain free, un
interrupted communication across the
I Isthmus of Panama.
In reply to this representation Secretary
j Hay gave assurances to Herran that the
\ United States will permit no interruption
, of traffic. Apparently the Liberals, who \
I have just captured Colon, are not anx- j
ious to cause this Government to inter- ]
vene more than it has already done, for I
official dispatches received by the State
and Navy departments announced that
the situation is quiet. Secretary Long
made public this dispatch from Captain
Perry, commanding the battleship Iowa:
"Everything quiet. No further inter
ference since notification. Transit and
telegraph communication open. Colon in
possession of Liberals and quiet."
Consul General Cudger supplemented
these advices by wiring that trains are
running regularly between Panama and
Colon. Commander McCrea confirmed the
statement that quiet prevails.
\ It is the expectation of Senor Herran
j that the Government troops will imme
diately move to recapture Colon. The
Liberals will be considerably embarrassed
' in their efforts to hold the town by rea
son of the fact that Commander McCrea
I will not permit them to occupy the rail
road station or wharves, or to demolish
the railroad track so as to prevent the
entrance of an attacking force. If a bat
tle occurs it will probably take place out
side of Colon.
A diplomat pointed out to-day that the
insurgents, now that they have obtained
possession of Colon, will probably ask
this Government for recognition. No such
I recognition will be accorded for the pres
ent, at least.
Foreigners Are Protected.
COLON. Colombia, Nov. 21.â The city of
Colon was perfectly quiet all yesterday |
and last night. It Is claimed in behalf of !
i the Liberals that there has been no un- i
i seemly behavior. Foreigners are being
! respected and protected, and transit ;
across the isthmus is uninterrupted.
Colonel Barrera, commander of the Lib- (
eral forces, asserts that he has notified j
the district representative of the Depart- i
j ment of the Interior and other former offi- j
I clals of the Government that he has ap- \
I pointed a commission to take over their ;
I offices formally. Senor Espriella, a prom- i
i inent lawyer and counsel for the Panama .
Railroad, is a member of the commission, i
Colonel Barrera admits that the Gov- j
ernment troops here numbered a little
ten than 120 men. It was at first report- ;
; ed that twelve or more men had been
killed and that about thirty were wound- :
I ed, but the bodies of more dead men have !
1 since been discovered.
General Zaldana commands 200 Liberal ;
' troops at Gatun Railroad station, about
' six miles from Colon. The Liberals claim j
! to be in possession of all the railroad sta- :
I tions between Colon and Las Cascades, |
: which is nearer to Panama than to Colon, j
Both sides used Remingtons and Mau- ;
sers. The former causes the higher death
rate. A Liberal lieutenant, who was shot
In the neck with a Mauser bullet, is re- i
ported to be doing well.
No Immediate Attack on Panama.
No immediate attack on Panama is con- !
templated. Colonel Barrera is awaiting
the arrival at Panama of Domingo Diaz, ;
the Liberal chief. W,hen Diaz reaches
I this city definite plans will be formulated.
General Patino, the original commander
' of the Liberal forces which captured-Co
i lon, is said to have intended to capture
the Colombian gunboat General Plnzoa
| in person, and some say that the general
was drowned in an effort to reach her in
a boat which capsized. Colonel Barrera,
however, denies this, but there is no
doubt that the capture of the General ;
Pinzon was contemplated.
The United States gunboat Machlas, It
Is understood, will not interfere with any ;
of the fighting, but will protect the fail
road and foreign interests. â¢
The Government at Panama is busy
erecting breastworks in the vicinity of
the railroad property, in the direction of
which the Liberal attack is expected.
The Mayor of Panama started in a
launch belonging to the canal company j
1 yesterday morning to report the state of i
i affairs to General Alban. Since the i
I Mayor's return to Panama it has been j
i rumored that he found the general at I
i Chorrera, and that he decided to take his
' forces back to Panama by land and rein
force the garrison there.
Certain sources of information have it
that the canal company's largest launch
was loaned to the Government last Sun
day to convey General Alban and troops
toward Chorrera and that it was sunk on
Tuesday near Taboga.
United States Consul General Gudger,
! Captain Perry of the United States bat
j tleshlp lowa and the secretaries of the
! Government held a conference at Panama
yesterday. The latter claimed that the
conductors of the train should not have
allowed Liberals to embark on the train
at Las Cascades. Captain Perry replied
that the Government should protect free
transit on the isthmus and ought to have
prevented the embarkation of the Lib
erals. Subsequently a letter was sent to
the Colombian authorities by the Ameri
can officials with reference to future ac
, tion. It is not improbable that the lowa
â¢J will shortly land a force to protect tran
:l sit. '
Little Gold Is Found.
The following provisional appointments
' were made by the Liberals to-day:
Senor Esprella to be Prefect, Dr. Val
, verde to be Mayor, Dr. France to be
Postmaster and Senor Silva to be Cap
tain of the Port. Other minor appoint
] ments were also filled.
The treasury safe was opened this aft
' ernoon in the presence of witnesses. It
, I was found to contain 1080 Colombian dol
j lars, equivalent to $450 gold. The former
Postmaster also handed over to the Lib
erals the cash and the postage stamps in
his possession. The municipal offices in
charge of Liberals probably will be
I opened to-morrow.
It Is said the gunboat Marietta, which
sailed from Key West for Colon Novem
ber 18, has been signaled.

Regrets That It Is Impossible for

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., ;Nov. 21âPresi
dent Roosevelt, who two years ago led the
cheering for Harvard at the game with
Yale, in reply to an invitation from the
Harvard management to attend Satur
day's game, to-night sent the following
telegram:
"I regret more than I can say that it is
utterly Impossible for me to come. Will
you please give my good wishes to the
team and say that I am sure they can
win and that I count upon their playing
without a let-up from the first to the
last."
LONDON, Nov. 22.â The fact that the anti-
Chamberlain agitation In Germany has at last
extracted a Â«3ml-officlal expression of appro
val from the North German Gazette has had
the effect of convincing the British press that
the situation is becoming serious.

It was expected that matters affecting
the work of the Catholic Church in the

that it received any serious attention, for

Killing Meredith.
SEATTLE, Nov. 21.â John TV. Consldine
left the King County Courthouse shortly

According to the verdict of the jury he
Is not guilty of the murder of ex-Chief

dict was read in the courtroom at 5:35, ex
actly three hours from the time the jury
men were locked up for deliberation.
There was no demonstration of any kind

It is not thought likely that Tom Con

although the prosecuting attorney has
given out no statement to this effect.

ENTHUSIASTIC CONVERTS.
There Are Thousands of Them
Who Believe as This
Woman Docs.
Mrs. Ira Knowlton of Butte, Montana, la a
most enthusiastic convert to the virtues of
Etuart's Dyspepsia Tablets as a cure for ob-
rtinate stomach trouble. She cays: "I had
poor direction nearly, all my life. It now
seems, to me that for years I never knew what
it was to be hungry, ' to have a good natural
Â»pr>?ttt<". . , â¢
"I was troubled with, gas in stomach causing
pressure on the heart with palpitation and
short breath. Nearly everything I ate soured
on my stomach. ' sometimes I had cramps m
thÂ« etomach which almost resembled spasms.
- "Doctors lold me I had catarrh of the stom-
ach, but their medicines would not reach it
and I. would still be a sufferer had I not. in
cheer desperation, decided to try Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets.
"I knew they were an advertised remedy and
I didn't believe anything I read about them
as I had no confidence in advertised remedies,
but my sister living in Pitteburg wrote me' last
epriiig telling me how Stuart's Tablets had
cured her little daughters TTf indigestion and
loss of flesh and appetite and I hesitated no
longer.
"I bought a fifty-cent box at my drug store
and took two of the large tablets after each
meal and found them delightful to take, being
as pleasant to the taste as caramel candy.
Whenever during the day or night I felt any
pain or uneasiness in the stomach or about
j the heart I took one of the small tablets and
mi three weeks it seemed to me as if I had
never known what stomach trouble was. !
"I keep Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in , the
house and every member of our family uses
them occasionally after a hearty meal or when
eny of us have a pain or ache in the digestive
organs."
Mr. E. 11. Davis of Hampton, Va., Bays: "I
doctored five years for dyspepsia, but in two
months I got more benefit from Stuart's Dys-
pep'jia* Tablets than in five years of the doctor's
treatment." â¢ Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest as
well as the simplest and most convenient reme-
dy, for any form of indigestion, catarrh of
stomach biliousness, pour stomach, bloating
after meals, sympathetic heart trouble.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is not a cheap
cathartic, but an active digestive remedy con-
taining the pepsin and diastase which every
weak stomach lacks, . and they cure stomach
troubles because they digest the food eaten and
give the weak, abused, overworked stomach a
chance to rest and recuperate.
Stuart Dyspepsia Tablets Â»re sold In every
drug store in the United States, Canada, and
Great Britain. . f

FALLS VICTIM
TO ASSASSIN
Portland Young Man Is
Murdered on Way to
His Home.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 21.â James Mor
row, a prominent young man, was the vic
tim of an atrocious murder last night.
The manner In which the deed was perpe
trated and the identity of the assassin
are enveloped in mystery.
The murder was not discovered until 4:30
o'clock this morning, when a milkman,
Ambrose Sparrowk, found the body lying
on the sidewalk of an East side street.
The circumstances surrounding his tragic
death make it one of the saddest that has
ever befallen the efforts of the police to
unravel.
Leaving the home of his fiancee, Miss
Liiah Illidjje, a beautiful young society
woman, at 11:40 oclock last night, Morrow
started with a jest on his lips for his
home, one mile and a half away. He had
mimed the last car and blithely began his
long walk. When the tragedy was en
acted he was three blocks away from his
home. The murder took place on East
Eighth street, between Stephens and Mill,
twenty feet away from the residence of
C. S. Bradford, a mailcarrier.
The report of a pistol was heard at 12:20
a. m. and the whole neighborhood was
aroused. The listeners mertly turned over
in their beds. Several heard the clatter
of two men running away. While the
residents lay back for sound slumber rain
drops pattered on the dying boy.
Two theories are advanced to explain
the murderâ one that he was killed by a
personal enemy Jealous of the boy's at
tentions to Miss Illidge, the other that he
was the victim of highwaymen. The bul
let was fired at close range, burning the
face with powder. The mystery is deep
ened by the position in which the body
was found, the left hand being in his
pocket and the right upraised. The bullet
went through his left eye. His position,
with his left knee upraised to take a step,
is taken to indicate that he made no re
sistance and that the shot came unexpect
edly.
Morrow was 21 years old and the brother
of .C. Morrow, a prominent Stanford
graduate.
Strike Gold in the Gravel.
FOLSOM, Nov. 21.â A rich strike in
gravel mining was made to-day at the
Gray & Wing mine, about two miles from
Kolsom. One pan of dirt, taken three feet
above the bedrock, yielded $95 to the pan.
The gold is of a fine quality. The pay
streak Is about eighty feet from the sur
face and is about seven feet high. Old
miners assert that the lead continues on
for miles. The shaft was first started
by CTiarles Nickerson and other guards
working at the prison, but for want of
sufficient money the mine was abandoned
when but a few feet from where the
strike was made. The new company is
composed mostly of residents of Oakland,
James Burnham, president; John A. Brit
ton, secretary, and William Pearson, the
principal owners residing there.
Palling Tree Kills a Boy.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 21.â Ben Barnes,
the son of W. P. Barnes, .a pioneer
farmer, was crushed to death by a falling
tree this morning at his ranch near Ful
ton. Perry Barnes, the dead boy's
brother, was seriously injured.
More Stenographers Wanted.
When the habeas corpus case of Wil
lirm B. Hensley was called before Judge
Cook yesterday Howard Vernon, Police
Court stenographer, stated that owing ;o
the pressure of business in the Police
courts he had been unable to get the rec
ord ready. The Judge expressed his dis
satisfaction and cointed out that under
the State law the remedy lay with the
Police Judges, as they were authorized
to appoint a stenographer whenever nec
essary. The case was continued for a
week to enable Vernon to write up the
record. There is an appropriation for an
additional stenographer in the Police
courts, but Mayor Phelan for some rea
son will not make the appointment.

Amazing Plot to Seize Cities and Mines
Revealed by Secret Order's Papers.
Officials of the Canadian Government and passengers from the Yukon region who arrived
from the north yesterday furnish complete confirmation of the story published exclusively in The Call
last Sunday concerning the gigantic conspiracy which had been hatched to overthroiv the existing gov
ernment in the Northwest Territory and establish a new republic. Ringleaders have made confes
sions, documents have been seised and officers are nozv on the way to Ottawa to explain to the govern
ment the details of a plot that has no parallel in the history of the % West since the celebrated Riel
rebellion.
Alert Officials Find
the Traces of
Plotters.
SEATTLE, Nov. 21.â 0f all the old
dreams of empire since the days
of Louis Riel, that concocted by
a band of plotters scattered along
the valley of the Yukon from the
Upper Lakes to Circle City is
probably the most extraordinary yet re
corded. A few days ago The San Fran
cisco Call published exclusively the story
of the exposure of the conspiracy at
Skagway and of the hurried measures
that were taken by both the Canadian
ani American officials to thwart the
scheme of the plotters to make of tfie
Yukon and Northwest Territory a repub
lic.
This remarkable story was discovered at
the time by persons claiming to be in
formed concerning Alaskan matters. The
Call correspondent here has, however, se
cured absolutely authentic information,
which completely corroborates the tirst
story of tne plot to overthrow British
authority in the great gold tileds of the
lukon. The Jameson raid in South Af
rica was not more daring or reckless in
its conception than the general plan of
malcontents and ambitious men in the
YuK.Oll country to seize the sources of
power and authority in the country, for,
depending on the rigors of an Alaskan
winter, tney planned to set up a repub
lican form, oi government and fortify
themselves against invasion from either
British Columbia or Canada.
Documents of Conspirators.
Proof that such a conspiracy existed is
furnished in documents which were ob
tained from one of the ringleaders in the
plot. The organization was formed in
.December, 1900, at Dawson. Its headquar
ters for months last summer was at
Skagway. It was called "The Order of
me Miunight Sun." Its members took
a hair-raising oath to reveal none of its
secrets. Death was the penalty for vio
lation of this oath. It might have suc
ceeded temporarily, as did Kiel when he
invaded the Nortnwest Territory with a
band of half-breeds. But the members
of the conspiracy lacked the requisite
nerve.
A vision of power and affluence, of
golden wealth stored in the government
ofhees in Dawson and other places in
the great Yutcon Valley of authority over
the richest placers in the world's history
for at least a brief period animated the
minds and strengthened the nerves of
the men who tirst formed the nucleus
of the secret organization. The uprising
would probably, in the belief of the lead
ers, have been temporarily successful be
cause of the fact that the Dominion Gov
ernment had abandoned the precautionary
measures it took several years ago to
prevent Just this sort of thing.
Skagway was the headquarters of the
conspirators. Fred Clark, for three years
stage manager of the Seattle Theater, who
went to the Klondike in 1898, was-the ring
leader at Skagway. He was run out of
the country by secret service men in
employ of the Dominion Government. He
is here now and confesses to his part of
the plot. He had charge of the records ot
"the Order of the Midnight Sun." Clark
makes no defense further than to say
that the miners in the Yukon are horribly
oppressed by the Dominion Government.
Plotters Along the Yukon.
Copies of the records of the organiza
tion have been secured. These tend to
show that a systematic agitation was
started in December last along the valley
of the Yukon. The first camp of the order
was organized In Dawson in 1900. Follow
ing this came the organization of local
lodges at White Horse, Hootalinqua, Ben
nett, Circle City and Atlln. Later the
Skagway camp was organized. More than
2000 men are members of the organiza
tion. >
Early last spring the Dawson camp is
sued a manifesto, which was circulated
up and down the valley of the Yukon in
British Territory. It contained a state
ment of grievances. These may be enu
merated as follows:
"Defective mining- laws; corruption in
office; excessive taxes on mining, includ
ing 10 per cent royalty on placer gold and
5 per cent on quartz; unlicensed gam
bling In the Territory; the revenue from
which goes to officials In power; leasing
of Government mineral and timber lands
to corporations only; absence of a lieu
law and general maladministration of jus
tice in the courts; foolish legislation, in
cluding the alien law, inimical to the
NOVEL DISPOSAL
OF BIG LAWSUIT
Counsel Take It From a
Jury and Submit It
to Judge.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 21.â The suit of
Herbert W. Pearson against President J.
J. Hill of the Great Northern Railroad
for $1,500,000 alleged to be dije for loca
tion of immense coal fields for the rail
way company was called for a second
trial to-day. The first trial resulted in a
disagreement. To-day it was expected
that another long trial would begin, but
counsel after a conference agreed to sub
mit the case to Judge Kelly on th# testi
mony taken at the former trial and on
briefs to be filed alternately.
Pearson, a man interested in scientific
matters, claimed to have located in the
West extensive areas of coal fields for
the railway company and that he had
not been paid as agreed. The amount of
coal he claims to have discovered for the
railway company aggregates nearly 100,
00,000 tons.
It is exceptional that a case of such
importance is thus withdrawn from a jury
and submitted to a Judge who is to pass
both upon the law and the evidence.
The difficulty of bringing scientific and
abstruse questions before a jury, the great
expense of such a trial and the time re
quired moved the attorneys on both sides
to submit the case to Judge Kelly as ar
bitrator, and briefs embodying contention
on legal points will be prepared.
CITY OF MEXICO. Nov. 21.â Jose del

Plans to Loot Mines
After the Fall of
Dawson.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 21.â TherÂ«
was an organized conspiracy to
seize Dawson. secure the bar
racks of the Northwest mounted
police with their arms and am
munition, loot the banks and pil
lage the metropolis of the rich northern
gold fields.
James Seely, formerly of this city, and
now head of the secret service of the
Northwest Mounted Police, is now here,
and he says that not only was there a
conspiracy to overthrow Canadian rule in
the Yukon and loot Dawson but in*
scheme hatched by the conspirators for
the project was a very feasible one, a^a
had its existence not ieen discovered by
the members of the secret service of the
Yukon and nipped in the bud, the raiders
could have accomplished their purpose,
and after taking Dawsun they could have
held that place and the Yukon for six
weeks or two months, but by then they
would be overwhelmed and each man or ,
the raiders would be a tugitive from the
avengers.
Pro-Boers Were Wanted.
The conspiracy' was born at Dawson,
and it had a branch at Skagway, but had
no existence in any other point to tne
south of Skagway, although efforts were
made to secure the assistance of pro-
Boer sympathizers in Seattle and other
points in the United States.
The plot was mado last summer, bev
eral American Fenians who had drifted
to Dawson got togethpr and formed an
organization which was called T.ie
Order of the Midnight Sun." A number
of cranks and pro-Boers, haters of Brt
ish rule, and others were gathered in, ana
the order grew until there were nearly a
thousand adherents Ir. September, when
the members of the secret service officials
in the Yukon became aware of its exiÂ»t
"seely declines to give particulars of
those affiliated with the scheme, but it
is learned that a notec". Fenian of Chicago
went into Dawson to take charge of the
scheme and delegates were sent to Skag
way to form a branch of the order there.
In "Skagway the order grew apace with
over 500 adherents to the projected raid
in the north.
Seizure of Police Posts.
It was decided to act as soon as the
Yukon was cosed to travel, and had not
the police of the north checkmated the
pi it the raiders had lull plans whereby
the Dawson conspirators were to rise at
a signal and eeize the barracks of the
Northwest mounted police while the
Skagway detachment were to march in
anl seize the mounted police posts along
the Yukon trail, having first cut the
through wire to enable them to surprise
post after post.
As there are but 250 all told in the com
plement of Northwest mounted police in
the Yukon and these are widely sepa
rated, none being left at the barracks at
Dawson. Seely says the scheme was re
garded by the authorities as an easy one.
Having surprised the small force in Daw
son, the programme was to seize the
arms, Maxims, carbines, ammunition and
other weapons of war and thus have
Dawson at their mercy. Then the banks
were to be looted and the rich mines of
t.ie creeks contiguous to Dawson raided
by detachments of the conspirators. For
three or four weeks they expected to be
in charge of Dawson. having disposed of
tne Northwest mounted police and confi
dent that troops could not reach them
over the Ice for at least six weeks and
the whole place would be pillaged, and.
with the treasure thus secured, they
wouJ3 then make their escape.
Americans; excessive duty on all kinds of
miners' supplies; boundary line dispute.
"The seeming unwillingness of the Brit
ish Columbian Government to meet the
United States Government half way in the
boundary line dispute is a condition which
grows worse and more acute with time
and will eventually cause trouble, perhaps
war, unless attended to at once. At pres
ent capital hesitateÃ to invest in this dis
puted district and the development of the
country Is retarded thereby. We pledge
ourselves if successful in this undertaking
to send a delegation to Washington. D. C,
at the earliest possible opportunity to the
end that the boundary may be permanent

GAS PREVENTS
SEARCH OF MINE
A General Belief Exists
That Death Roll Is
Incomplete.
TELIATRIDE, Colo., Nov. 21.â The de
velopments to-day In the Smuggrler-Union
mine disaster have not helped to remove
the doubt as to the number of victims,
and at a late hour to-night it seems un
likely that the exact number will be
known for several hours. As yet the list
remains the same as last night, twenty
two dead and one in a precarious condi
tion from inhaling the deadly gas and
smoke drawn into ihe mine from the burn
ing buildings about the mouth of the BulÂ»
lion tunnel. It is possible that a search
of the ninth level, which is still in part
inaccessible on account of the gas, will
reveal the bodies of other victims, but a
party headed by Superintendent Edgar
Collins this afternoon went through all
the other portions of the mine and found
no more bodies. The unexplored portion
of the ninth level is about 500 feet in
length. It will not be safe to enter this
part of the drift before to-morrow morn
ing, and perhaps much later.
Superintendent Collins said to-night that
he did not believe the death roll would be
increased by more than one or two, and
possibly not at all. It is said two or three
men are missing, but it is not certain, as
the men are mostly foreigners and many
of them did not report after making their
escape from the mine. It was only by
the most careful searching that many of
the survivors were located. The work of
clearing away the debris of the burned
buildings and repairing the tramway has
already begun, but it is said that it will
be some time before the mine can be re
opened.
Report Is on the Way
to Authorities
at Ottawa.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Nov. 21.-A
Canadian government official
to-day fully confirmed the story
of the conspiracy against the
government of the Yukon, as
published in The San Francisco
Call last Sunday, and added
several important details to the state
ment of affairs in the North.
The official is E. S. Busby, Supervising
Canadian Customs Officer at Skagway,
who not only made a special investigation
of the conspiracy during the last three
weeks, but is the bearer of a report on
the whole question to the authorities at
Ottawa. The matter will now be placed
be * or( L the Government officially.
Busby arrived here to-day by the
steamer Amur. He is one of the most
xf ?! offlc e r s of the Government in the
JNorth and has on several occasions pre
pared important reports. A month ago
he wrote to a friend in Vancouver that
,he would at once come down here on a
holiday. A few days later he wired that
he was delayed for three weeks in mak
ing a special investigation.
When he arrived in Vancouver to-day
Busby expressed great surprise that the
story had been published regarding the
Northern conspiracy. He admitted that
this was the special business regarding
which he had been detained. Busby says
that it was one of the features of the plan
of conspiracy to bring a large number of
men up from Seattle who were opposed to
the Canadian Government and its rule in
the Yukon, and to have them assist in the
fight to be made against the mounted
police. It was the intention to ship" in
rlnes and money was subscribed for this
purpose. The officials obtained wind of
this, and because of their extreme vigi
lance they are certain that no guns
passed through and that this part of the
programme was never fulfilled.
Another scheme included in the general
plan was to rob various banks in White
Horse as well as in Dawson. These are
not usually well guarded and the idea
was to obtain the money for the Boers in
South Africa. But so far none of these
schemes were acted upon and nothing
was done, for the officials watched care
fully all the time.
Other passengers coming by the same
steamer to-day agree that an attempt
was made to carry out the conspiracy.
Two men opened offices in Skagway in
the summer, and from there they ob
tained subscriptions from American resi
dents for the carrying out of the scheme.
One of these men came to Seattle and
did missionary work there in the revolu
tionist cause.
the Upper Yukon to obtain converts to
the new propaganda.
Copies of the oaths required of new
members of the order are now in the
possession of The Call correspondent. Be
fore a man was taken into the order he
was thoroughly sounded by its agents
regarding his feeling toward the existing
government. If he expressed bitterness
he was encouraged. Finally if, after in
vestigation, he was reported of good
nerve, he was invited to Join the order.
The preliminary oath bound the novice
to not divulge the names of other mem
bers of the organization nor disclose its
purpose. He swore also to be loyal to
the proposed new government. In the sec
ond oath the novitiate swore to defend
the cause and render it every aid and
under any circumstances to defend fellow
members if called on. It was plainly
stated in these oaths that death would be
the penalty for violation thereof.
AVith the circulation of the declaration
of grievances in the Upper Yukon Valley
many new members were added to the
organization. Two months ago the Cana
dian mounted police became aware that
something was wrong and this "led the
ringleaders to establish a junta at Skag
way. Fred Clark was placed in charge
Clark conducted the business of organi
zation unmoltested for three months He
confesses that he was watched by secret
service men and that his mail was inter
cepted by the authorities. Still no action
was taken until the meeting in Skagway
November 5, between Captain Corrigari
of the Canadian mounted police and
Judge Brown, United States Attorney
Friedrich, Marshal Shoup and Major Ho
vey. Clark got wind of this meeting and
left Skagway by the first boat.
A few days prior to his departure Clark
took from his safe in a store in Skagway
the records of the order. He had pre
viously issued an addrÂ«sa to the mer
chants of Skagway, which was circulated
in secret, promising them that if they
subscribed to the fund of "The Order
of the Midnight Sun" they would gain
much in trade by the reduction in the
duty on American goods. By this means
the organization obtained considerable
following in Skagway.
The plotters aimed to ape Jameson in
South Africa. The money did not come
fast enough and the Canadian police be
came aware of their plans, with the con
sequent exposure..

POOR MEMORY
AIDS PRISONER
Forger Receives Light
Sentence Because,
Forgotten.
VALLEJO, Nov. 21.â Two weeks ago
Constable Downing of Suisun arrested
Henry Schmidt on a charge of having
forged the name of a Suisun Valley
rancher to a check for $40. When the case
was called in the Superior Court the de
fendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to five years in Folsom Prison.
Since his conviction it has been discov
ered that Schmidt was no other than
Henry Borchers, a marine, who passed
a forged check on a firm in this city a
year ago and for which crime he was
sent to San Quentin for one year. Upon
his release from San Quentin Borchers
went to Suisun, where he secured em
ployment as a porter at the Arlington
Hotel.
The amusing feature of the case ts that
none of the officers recognized Borchers,
although Deputy Sheriff Robinson had
taken him to San Quentin on his first
sentence. Had his identity become known
before his sentence was pronounced
Schmidt or Borchers would have had
about ten years added to his imprison
ment.
EOT FINDS FATHER
DEAD IN THE CABIN
Two Old Men Drink Wood Alcohol,
Presumably by Mistake,
and Are Killed.
MONTEREY, Nov. 21.â News has just
reached here from Point Sur of the death
of "Jack" Howland and "Sam" Radcliff,
two prominent pioneers of the Sur dis
trict.
Charles Howland of Monterey, son of
one of the men, went to see his father
on Monday last and upon reaching the
cabin found both lying dead. An empty
bottle that had contained wood alcohol
stood on the table beside them. Yjungr
Howland believes they had been dead for
at least forty-eight hours when he found
them.
The two men were partners in ranch
ing and cattle raising and lived alone on
Howland's land. They came to Monterey
la.st Friday on business and while here
bought the wood alcohol to make shel
lac, they told the druggist who sold it.
They were drinking pretty heavily when
they left Monterey and probably drank
the wood alcohol by mistake. Howland
was in his eighty-first year and Radcliff
was about 65 years old. They leave con
siderable property.

GROWS RAPIDLY
Report of the Executive
Committee Shows
Progress.
CLEVELAND. 0., Nov. 21.â The execu
tive committee of the McKinley National
Monument Association, after a lengthy
session to-day at the office of Senator
Hanna, issued the following statement:
At a meeting 1 of the executive committee of
the McKinley National Memorial Association
held in Cleveland to-day the secretary, Ryer
son Ritchie, submitted reports from many
States of the Union showing gratifying progress,
and that the appeal to the people to provide
funds for a memorial at Canton Is meeting with
very general and hearty response. A plan for
future work was outlined, and the same will
be pushed vigorously to completion. Reports
received Indicate that auxiliary organizations
have already been perfected in nearly all
States of the Union.
The expression of sentiment from every quar
ter of the country indicates that the people de
eire to make the erection of a monument at
the home of President MeKinley their first
duty, a* it Is well known he often expressed to
his family and friends his desire to be buried
t Canton, where already repose the remains
cf his children and where his beloved wife will
rest when she has departed this life. In defer
ence to this sentiment, as well as to the pro
priety of the occasion, as evidenced in the
monuments provided for the lamented Lincoln
and Garfield, It will be the purpose of the as
foclatlcn to carry forward the work of provid
ing for such a memorial at his home. Should
more funds be subscribed than are necessary
for the purpose of erecting a memorial com
latlble with the dignity and simplicity of the
late President's life and character, any sur
plus will be devoted to a national memorial at
Washington.

the Washington Arch Association, to Senator'

GALWAY HONORS
BOER WAR HERO
Elects Colonel Lynch to
a Seat in British
Parliament.
DUBLIN, Nov. 21.â The election to-day
in the Parliamentary contest in Galway
between Colonel Arthur Lynch, who
fought as a colonel in the Boer army, and
Horace Plunkett, Unionist, resulted in a
victory for the former by the following
figures: Lynch, 1247; Plunkett, 473.
On the whole the polling was conducted
with comparative orderliness. A large ad
ditional force of police prevented numer
ous street scrimmages, which were the
outcome of drunkenness, from developing
seriously. Women were conspicuous In
these affairs and many of them were ar
rested.
In the event of Colonel Lynch's election
being quashed on the ground that he is a
traitor, Plunkett says he will decline to
take the seat thus reverting to him, de
claring that he will be returned straight
or not at all. Colonel Lynch's friends
seem satisfied that Plunkett will attempt
to take the seat.
Hanna, was laid before the committee, but the
questions involved in the communication were
referred to the board of trustees at their meet
ing, to be held at Washington. December 7,
when It is hoped that any possible differences
may be adjusted. It was the sentiment of the
members of the committee present that pro
vision for a suitable memorial at Canton was
the first duty to be performed.
This purpose is believed to be In accordance
with the wishes of the family and near per
sonal friends of the President.

official Servian statement
declares there is abso

the reports that Queen Draga has
been shot at or that she has com

LONDON, Nov. 21.â A spe

a newspaper there asserts that
Queen Draga and King Alexan

ROYAL COUPLE WHOSE QUAR
RELS HAVE FURNISHED
MANY SENSATIONS.
ATTEMPT TO KILL
GREEK PREMIER
Several Shots Are Fired
at Him but Without
Effect.
ATHENS, Nov. 21.â The agitation
against the proposal to translate the
gospels into modern Greek was continued
to-day.
Twenty thousand persons assembled
around the ruins in the Temple of Jupiter
Olympus and took part in a demonstra
tion organized by the students. A reso
lution was passed calling on the Holy
Synod to excommunicate any person who
translated the gospels i*ito Greek as now
spoken. Eight hundred marines were
landed and co-operateO with the troops In
patrolling the locality. Several collisions
occurred, and occasional shots were fired
The students still hold the university
buildings.
During the demonstrations following
the assemblage several shots were fired
at M. Theotokis, the Gieek Premier, but
without effect.
During the encounters between the mil
itary and the turbulent demonstrators
seven persons were killed, thirty were
severely and many others were slightly
wounded.
Great excitement prevails to-night.
Strong military detachments guard the
palace and the residence of the Premier.
Everywhere anxious gTOupa are discuss
ing the situation.
Heartrending scenes occurred when the
bodies of the dead were handed over to
their relatives.
It is reported that armed men have ar
rived at the university, but the building
is still guarded by the students, who are
adopting military discipline.
Opposition Deputies parade the streets
during the day, exciting tne rioters by
violent language.
There were no further disturbances dur
ing the evening, but ,It Is feared that
there will be a renewal of disorders to
morrow.
Among those slightly Injured are the
Prefect of Police of Athens and the Pre
fect of Attica.

CHINESE EXCLUSION CONVENTION,
Continued From Page Two.
in the treaties of this country as consummated
with other nations that America has always
preserved what is known as "the favored na
tion clause"; and our commercial privileges
at the ports of the Orient are not dependent
upon the question as to how many there are
of them, or whether they shall at all come
here: but we are entitled now, under the 'â¢fa
vored nation clause," to whatever privilege,
to whatever may be done or said, to all that
is given and proposed to be given to every
favored nation in the world, and all those
privileges extend to the treaties which may
be consummated in the future. So It is to
day that should England or Austria or Ger
many or Russia or any of those nations known
and enumerated among the great powers con
summate a treaty with China, giving especial
privileges to their citizens the United States
under the "favored nation clause" would
stand upon exactly the same plane and its cit
izens would be entitled to all those immuni
ties. It appears to me that that disposes en
tirely of the question as to whether corn
can be regulated with reference to the conduct
of this people and these United States when
they, clothed In their solemn majesty, seek
to protect themselves, their industries, their
farms, their magnificent achievements and
their labor.
In some ways our fortune Is our misfortune.
We are here looking out upon the seas. On
the opposite aide is a shore line; along the
coast and in the Interior four hundred millions
of Chinamen. It is the oldest etnDlre In the
world now as If stands. It may be that away
back In the distant time she had embassadors
at the court of Kameses when Moses left the
land of Egypt. And during the centuries she
has preserved her traditions and her prejudices
and even we find now that she has builded a
wall around her, and I say that If that wall
is sufficient to keep us out it should be suffi
cient to keep them in. (Applause.)
My friends, there is nothing I can say to
you with reference to your delegation in Con
gress. I believe that they will be true and
loyal to the cause of the American people, to
the industries of this great country. There
Is no danger of your delegation. They will
work honestly and truly, and I believe that
with the momentous questions that shall arise
in Congress this winter, that dealing with the
Philippines, the building of the Nicaragua
canal, the multitudinous questions which spring
upon a new and growing nation, yet above and
beyond them all predomlnently stands the re
enactment of an exclusion law. (Applause.)
And while I believe your committee will do
their duty yet I would suggest to them to
place no riders upon the bill; place no riders
upon your sentiment to-day. Let it be direct
and certain with reference to one point, with
reference to the re-enactment of an exclusion
law, and let the echo of your voices go out
upon that one question, even like unto the
reverberations of old of the Cyclops' hammer
upon the shield of Mars. Then you will have
done your duty, you will have tended to clear
the cause you will have enlightened it and
you will have nothing else to detract from It.
Let it be your central, your magnificent and
your majestic purpose, without race prejudice.
Make it a part of the theory of western gov
ernment, identified by it with the growing con
ditions of this great western empire, and make
the people know wherever they can hear our
voice that we understand the theories of gov
ernment, that we, too. were reared in the
traditions of our country, magnificent, sov
ereign-like, majestic; let it pour out in a vol
ume upon the East and your delegation In
Congress will do its duty.

say that the almost universal sentiment of the
people of the State of Washington is strongly
in favor of Chinese exclusion. We shall regard
it a disaster of the first magnitude if Chinese
exclusion is not continued and enforced by
Congress. The people of the State are aroused
regarding this matter, and I wish, in the

Governor Henry T. Gage expressed his
regret at being unable to attend the con
vention, with the purposes of which he
was heartily in sympathy. His letter was
largely devoted to the expression of his
views on the subject of Chinese exclusion
embodied in his first biennial message to
the Legislature. In closing the Governor
said:
I am much pleased, therefore, to know that
the convention will assemble in your city for
the contemplated good work, and feel that its
labors can but result In great good to the State
within which we live, as well as to our common
country.
A motion was made to have a telegram

THE RECIPROCITY CONVENTIO.N
DESPITE the efforts of the opponents of the
protective system to get control of the re
ciprocity convention that has just closed its
on in Washington, their failure was complete.
c speskcrs indeed there were who protested
against what they called "ultra protectionists," but
their following was not strong enough to dominate
the convention. After a full and fair discussion the
victory foi protection and that form of reciprocity
expressed "in the Philadelphia platform was com
plete.
As an expression of the sentiment of the majority
the convention adopted two resolutions on the sub
ject. The first recomir.ends Congress to maintain
'the principle of protection for the home market and
to open up, by reciprocity, opportunities for increased
foreign trade by special modifications of the tariff in
special case?, but only where it can be done without
injury to any of our home interests of manufacturing,
commerce or farming." The second resolution
recommends that in order to ascertain the influence
n\- proposed treaty on our home interests Con
? should establish "a reciprocity commission
charged with the duty of investigating the condition
; :iy industry and reporting the same to the Execu
and to Congress for guidance in negotiating re
ciprocal trade arrangements."
The two resolutions are in harmony with the prin
ciple of leciprocity as expounded and advocated by
the Republican party. The declaration by the con
cern that icciprocity should be undertaken ''only
-where it can be done without injury to any of our
home interests of manufacturing, commerce or farm
ing" is virtually the seme as the declaration in the
jiatform: "We favor the associated policy of reci
procity so directed as to open our markets on favor
aWe terms for what we do not ourselves produce in
return for free foreign market -
The recommendation in favor of the establishment
0/ a reciprocity commission would be well worth
nting should it be decided to enter upon any ex
tensive reciprocity arrangements. Mr. Kasson has
done about as well, perhaps, as any other single
Commissioner could do in arranging such treaties,
but the result of his work has given no satisfaction
to the country. If such trade arrangements are to be
made with foreign nations the terms proposed and
the various schedules of duties suggested should be
subjected to the scrutiry of a body of experts repre
senting the country as a whole and capable of esti
mating with a near approach to accuracy the effect
the treaty would have upon the interests of the differ
ent sections of the Union. Congress has not time to
undertake that work, and it ought not to be left solely
to the agents of the State Department. If then we
;rc to have a policy of reciprocity the proposed com
mission would appear desirable from every point of
view.
It is by no means certain, however, that it is worth
while to undertake any extensive reciprocity system.
The more carefully the proposals for 6uch a system
are considered the more complex and the more per
plexing do the difficulties attending it appear. More
over, there remains always the objection raised by
Senator Hoar that such treaties would have the ef
fect of taking our tariff regulations out of our own
hands and subjecting them to the influences of foreign
nations. The country at present is prosperous, and
it will be at this time wisd*om on the part of Congress
et well enough alone. There is no use in dis
ing a condition which is satisfactory alike to in
dustry and to trade.
Winter has already made its first calls with snow
storms and blizzards in the East, Great Britain and
Russia; and now once more all any one will have to
do to satisfy himself with the weather in California
will be to read of the kind of weather they are get
ting everywhere else ir. the world.
Mr. Bryan claims that the circulation of the Com
moner is increasing, but he always claimed that the

THE VOICE OP CALIFORNIA.
BY the convention which assembled in* this city
yesterday the voice of California on the ques
tion of Chinese immigration will be expressed.
So far as the State itself is concerned.no such con
vention was needed. Public sentiment on the sub
ject was formed long ago, and no considerable bpdy
of citizens has found any reason for a change of
opinion. It is the common judgment of men of all
parties that unrestricted Chinese immigration would
be the worst evil that could befall this section of the
Union, and accordingly all are agreed that restric
tion is absolutely necessary for the continuance, of
prosperity and the maintenance of our standard of
living.
Such being the prevailing opinion of our people,
the chief aim of the convention is to affect Eastern
rather than Western sentiment. It is to make mani
fest to Congress and to the East generally that the
people of California are resolutely opposed to un
restricted Chinese immigration, and to set forth the
reasons for that opposition. It is right and fitting
that such a convention should have met, for had there
been no such formal and emphatic expression of pub
lic sentiment members of Congress might have con
cluded that Califomians are indifferent to the issue
and no lenger regard it as one of paramount impor
tance.
From time to time The Call has directed attention
to the increasing strength of the pro-Chinese senti
ment in the East and the South. Wu Ting Fang, the
Chinese Minister at Washington, who is unquestion
ably one of the most astute diplomatists of the day,
has been making well-considered appeals both to the
Eastern and the Southern public. To the one he has
suggested that a repeal of the restriction laws would
result in- an immediate increase of Eastern trade with
China, with a consequent increase in the profits of
Eastern manufacturers and merchants; while to the
Southerners he has suggested that cheap Chinese
labor would aid them in the task of cultivating their
fields and also in building up their manufacturing in
dustries. The appeals were not made in vain, and for
some time past it has been evident that Wu Ting
would have strong support in his efforts to get rid
of restriction.
The situation looked dangerous until it became
generally understood that President Roosevelt favors
a re-enactment of the restriction measures. It will
not do for us, however, to rely wholly upon the po
tency of the Presidential influence with Congress
men. The fight is ours and we must take a leading
part in it. Many men who are as yet undecided upon
the issue will look to California for guidance, since
the people of this State have had a fuller experience
in Chinese immigration than the # people of any other.
It maj- be counted as certain that the expression of
opinion by a California convention will have more
weight with impartial men than a similar expression
by any other convention that could be held in the
country.
The voice of California on the subject will not be
in any sense bigoted or unfair. No State has more
to hope for from the development of a vast trade be
tween the United States and China. It is well under
stood here that we must look to the Orient for a
market for much of the product of our industries, and
BO intelligent man will favor any radical scheme that
would tend to interfere with the development of that
trade. In her recent troubles China has found the
United States to be almost her sole friend among the
great powers. We have no designs upon Chinese
territory, nor any thought of committing aggression
upon her people. We afford a rich and abundant
market for Chinese products and we can supply her
people on better terms than any other nation with the
manufactured goods and the fruit and wheat they
need. Consequently between ourselves and China
there should be none but the friendliest relations;
but such relations could not continue if an unre
stricted immigration of Chinese disturbed our labor
market and threatened to produce on the Pacific
Coast a race issue worse than that in the South.
GERMAN INDIGNATION.
OF all the evidences recently given of a feeling
among the German people of an antagonism
against Great Britain, none is so remarkable
as the long continuance of the clamor against Cham
berlain because of his allegation that the Germans
had waged war against France with more harshness
than the British are now waging war against the
Boers. That such a statement might excite an indig
nant denial from some excitable German here and
there was to have been expected, but it is surprising
to learn that it has aroused something like universal
condemnation and that, instead of being permitted to
pass as an incident of a day, it has been made to
engage the attention of the press, of representative
gatherings of the people and even of official bodies
for weeks.
The speech in which Chamberlain made the state
ment which has aroused so much wrath was delivered
in Edinburgh October 25, or nearly a month ago. The
first announcements of German indignation came
almost immediately afterward, and since that time
they have continued without interruption notwith
standing, it is announced, there has been an official
remonstrance from the Imperial Government. Some
thing like an elaborate agitation has evidently been
worked up on the subject, for recent dispatches from
Berlin state that arrangements have been made to
hold anti-Chamberlain meetings at nearly every im
portant town in the empire.
The words which have excited all that wrath were
not particularly severe. In the report given by the
London papers of th^ speech before the outburst
occurred in Germany, Mr. Chamberlain is said to
have referred to the charges made against the Gov
ernment of conducting the war in South Africa with
unnecessary harshness and severity, and then said:
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, there is no subject which
has given us greater anxiety, more serious consider
ation. I think that the time has comeâ is comingâ
when measures of greater severity may be necessary,
and if that time comes we can find precedents for
anything that we may do in the action of those na
tions who now criticise our 'barbarity' and 'cruelty,'
but whose example in Poland, in the Caucasus, in
Almeria, in Tonquin, in Bosnia, in the Franco-Ger
man war, whose example we have never even
approached."
It will be seen that Mr. Chamberlain's allegations
of harshness in war refer not to Germany only but
to France, Russia and Austria as well. It is only
among the Germans, however, that any indignation
has been stirred up, and consequently it is an Â«asy
inference that the rage of the Germans is due to some
thing more than Chamberlain's remark. It would
seem that certain leaders in Germany are using the
phrase as a means of appealing to a sentiment that
already exists, and that the appeal is designed to ac
complish something more than the denunciation of
the British Secretary of State for the Colonies.
A curious sidelight upon the subject is thrown by
Tttja- SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1901.
the reports that many of the utterances <n' the press
on the subject are taken as indirect thrusts Â«t the
Kaiser for his supposed fondness for Great Britain.
Thus the Cologne Yolks Zeitung is quoted as saying
of the agitation: "The movement shows that the
German people cannot understand how British in
solence can be put up with, or how anybody can dem
onstratively show Anglomania."
Whether the object of the agitation is to give relief
to German sympathy with the Boers, or to express
German dislike of British trade, or whether it is a
means of annoying the Kaiser, can hardly be deter
mined from this distance, but it is doubtful if ever
before so slight a criticism so deeply excited a great
people.
AN interesting and somewhat heated discussion
has arisen between Governor Beckham of Ken- j
tucky and Governor Durbin of Indiana over
the refusal of the latter to honor a requisition for
the extradition of ex-Governor Taylor of Kentucky
as a fugitive from justice charged with complicity in
the assassination of Goebel. Governor Durbin
bases his refusal on the ground that Taylor would
not receive a fair trial, and of course such a statement
has not had the effect of diminishing in any degree
the ardor of the controversy.
The two Governors are not left to argue the ques
tion without assistance. Numerous partisans on
each side have taken part in it and the press has
joined in. The discussion, while voluminous in
quantity, does not cover a wide range of argument.
Virtually it comes to the assertion on one side that
a Governor of a State should not extradite a fugitive
from justice from another State if he have reason to
believe the accused will not have a fair trial; while
the other side assert that each State is bound to re
spect the laws and courts of another State and a Gov- '
ernor has no right to refuse extradition upon any
mere belief or suspicion affecting the honor and hon
esty of the judicial authorities of the State demand
ing the extradition.
The statement of the constitution on the subject is
unmistakably plain and clear. Section 2of article IV
says: "Any person charged in any State with trea
son, felony or other crime, who shall flee from jus
tice and be found in another State, shall, on demand
of the executive authority of the State from which
he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the State
having jurisdiction of the crime."
It will be seen the constitution does not give the
Governor of a State authority to decide whether or
no the fugitive from justice shall be surrendered.
The language is emphatic and mandatory that the
fugitive shall be delivered up on demand from the
executive authority of the State from which he fled.
It happens, however, that there is no provision of
law, either in the constitution or out of it, by which
a Governor can be compelled to obey the constitu
tional obligation, and as a consequence the require
ment is virtually a dead letter. In fact, it is stated
by the supporters of Governor Durbin that Gov
ernors of various States have frequently refused to
surrender fugitives, and sometimes the refusals have
been based not on legal technicalities but upon broad
grounds of public policy.
It is most unfortunate that the case is one in which
so much partisan prejudice and passion is involved.
Ex-Governor Taylor stands charged with one of
the gravest crimes known to our laws. The accusa
tion is brought against him by official authority and
by due process of law. To refuse to surrender him
for trial is virtually to asperse the honor of the courts
of Kentucky, and that will inevitably tend to weaken
respect for the courts everywhere. In our Union the
States are too closely linked together for it to be pos
sible to maintain a respect for law in one State while
mocking at the law in an adjoining State. However
bad a politician Goebel may have been, his assassina
tion was an infamous crime, and every man charged
with it upon good evidence should be made to answer
for it at the bar of justice. He should not be per
mitted to escape by flying to another State. The
mandate of the constitution should be obeyed even
though the framers neglected to provide a means of
compelling obedience to it.
FOR the purpose of fitly commemorating the
one hundredth anniversary of its existence the
New York Evening Post recently published an
issue of forty-four pages with a handsomely illus
trated supplement of forty pages, and finally a fac
simile of the first issue of the paper, on Monday, No
vember 16, 1801. The whole constitutes a complete
record of one of the most notable successes in the
history of journalism. It appears there is now but
one newspaper in New York older than the Post that
has had a continuous publication under the same title.
\ The history of the Post is marked by a succession
of strong and earnest men in . the editorial chair.
Among them were William Coleman, one of the
founders; who edited it from 1801 to 1829; William
Cullen Bryant, Parke Godwin, John Bigelow, Carl
Schurz, Edwin Lawrence Godkin and Horace White,
the present editor. Nearly every one of these is a
man of national reputation, known familiarly to intel
ligent people throughout the whole country. With
such men at its head the Post could not fail to be
come an influential paper and command the respect
even of those who disagree with its politics. \ ',.
The fac-simile of the first number furnishes an illus
tration of what journalism -was a century ago. The
prospectus begins by announcing that the editor
"will endeavor that this paper shall appear in a dress
worthy of the liberal patronage which is already
promised." It is announced: "The design of this
paper is to diffuse among the people correct informa
tion on all interesting subjects, to inculcate just prin
ciples in religion, morals and politics, and to culti
vate a taste for sound literature." <
The most important article in the issue is a reprint
from the Palladium, consisting of a denunciation of
"monstrous" journalism. The writer complains: "A
newspaper is pronounced to be very lean and desti
tute, of matter if it contains no account of murders,
suicides, prodigies or monstrous births." He goes
on to say: "This country is said to measure seven
hundred millions of acres, and is inhabited by almost
six millions of people. Who can doubt, then, that a
great many crimes will be committed and a great many
strange things will happen every seven years? There
will be thunder showers that will split tough white
oak trees, and hailstorms that will cost some farmers
the full amount of twenty shillings to / mend their
.glass windowsâthere will be , taverns [ and boxing
matches and elections and gouging and drinking and
love arid murder and running in debt and running
away and suicide. Now if a man supposes eight Â«. or
ten or twenty dozen of these amusing events . 1 will
happen in a single year, is he not just as wise as an
other man who reads fifty columns of amazing par
ticulars and of course knows that they have hap
pened?" " â - ': 7;^-^^".
FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE.
A CENTURY OLD.
FORMER STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER TELLS WHY
THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT SHOULD BE RENEWED
J. J. Tobin Answers Minister Wu and Ho Yow,-and Directs Attention to Im
portant Facts the Chinese Officials Have Cunningly Concealed.
EDITOR The Call; There is a pressing necessity of pre
senting to Congress facts and arguments, clear and con
vincing, why the Geary law, or one more drastic, should
be passed. The danger of allowing two years' trial of
non-exclusion, as requested by the Chinese Minister, is
greatly to be feared. Large interests are aligned in favor of
letting down the bars of Chinese exclusion. Railroad and
steamship companies, trusts and corporations that employ
many thousands of unskilled laborers are quietly working to
prevent the passage of Chinese exclusion laws. They need
coolies in their business, and any appeal to sentiment or patri
otism is utterly wasted upon them.
These are reinforced by a considerable class of sentiment
alists, who advocate the "fatherhood of God and brotherhood
of man" doctrines, of whom the venerable and distinguished
Senator Hoar of Massachusetts Is a shining example. To fight
successfully this opposition those in favor of Chinese exclu
sion must not by threat or passion give ground for the allega
tion that the passage of the Geary law was brought about by
the machinations of political demagogues. In an ably written
article in the North American Review of September the Chi
nese Consul General Ho Vow makes this charge and adds
"that a certain aggregate of mischievous persons have im
posed upon the ignorance and credulity of your laboring people
and caused them to demand the passage of laws resulting
Infinitely to their own harm." The people and Congress should
be reminded that the Legislature of California submitted to a
vote of her citizens the question of Chinese exclusion and it
was carried by a vote of 154,638 "For" and only 883 "Against."
If the statement of Ho Vow is correct there must be an over

Vital Reasons for Exclusion Ignored.
The pleas advanced by Ho Vow and his superior, the Chi
nese Minister, Wu Ting Fang, in opposition to Chinese exclu
sion are cunningly concocted to operate upon sensitive altru
istical and capitalistic stomachs in the United States. Al
though these pleas are touched up and freshened by these fine
Celestial hands, we of California do not fail to recognize them
as the same old, familiar ones heard in 1882 and again in 1892,
when our people en masse cried out for redress against an
ever-increasing Chinese invasion. The Chinese Consul, Ho
Vow, says, "I shall grant the accusers of my people every
thing they say," and then proceeds to detail such allegations
and such only as he knows will appeal to the conscienceless
greed of large employers of labor. He completely ignores rea
sons for exclusion which to us who know the Chinese are moat
vital and important. According to him the demagogic charges
against the Chinese are: Iâ They work more cheaply. 2 â They
live more cheaply. 3â They send their money to China. 4â
They have no permanent residence. sâ They do not assimilate
with Americans. The wily Ho Vow understands that these
attributes do not affect the Chinese standing one lota in the eyes
of certain greedy capitalists, who look upon the common laboring
masses as mere human machines. Consequently he denies not
the soft impeachment. On the contrary, he wishes that "some
succor could be devised for the employers whereby the tyran
nies and injustices which many of them suffer at the hands
of their employes might be modified." The succor in his eye
is the employment of Chinese in the place of disaffected white
labor. "The class for whose supposed benefit the exclusion
laws exist," according to Ho Vow, "are members of the labor
unions and were passed to appease laborers with whom the
Chinese did not and could not compete." There is scarcely a
man or woman of sane mind living on the Pacific Slope to-day
who does not know that this statement of the Chinese Consul
General is not the fact. The Chinese, he says, are wholly un
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
KATE FIELDâ Enq., City. Kate Field
died in Honolulu. H. L, May 19, 18S6.
YOSEMITEâ T., Spreckels, Cal. Yosem
ite is Indian, and means large grizzly
bear.
SWIMMING SCHOOLSâ T., Spreckels.
Cal. There is no public swimming school
in San Francisco, but there are several
places where the art of swimming is
taught by private teachers.
LATIN QUARTERâ T., Spreckels, Cal.
What is known as the Latin auarter of
San Francisco is in the northern part of
the city, in that territory north of Pacific
street between Taylor and Sansome.
PHONOL.ITE-L. O. T. M., City. Pho
nolite is the name given to a variety of
basalt or greenstone which rings or clinks
with a metallic sound when struck with
a hammer. It is also known by the name
of clinkstone.
MOUNTAIN AND MAHOMETâ Sub
scriber, City. The expression, "The moun
tain has come to Mahomet," in the article
alluded to is a figure of speech that does
not need a diagram to express the mean
ing of the writer.
CHANCES IN MANILAâ E., Honolulu,
H. I. This department not having any
personal knowledge as to the condition of
the trade in which the party would like
to engage in Manila or in the Philippines,
is not in a position to advise the party to
go there in search of employment.
THE CANALSâ A. O. S., City. This de
partment has not the space to give a his
tory of the Panama and Nicaragua
canals, but respectfully refers you to the
Free Public Library, where you will find
much on these subjects in the encyclo
pedias, periodical literature and special
works.
THE FIRST SURVEYâ â¬?., City. The
first survey of San Francisco was made
in 1847 by J. J. Voiget, a Swiss surveyor.
His design laid out the streets in such
a manner that every house would have
had an equal share of the sun upon its
front ana rear during the day; but his
original plan was not adopted.
DESERTION-H. M., City. The United
States law relative to desertion is as fol
lows: "No person shall be tried or pun
ished by a court martial for desertion in
time of peace and not in the face of the
enemy committed more than two years
be/ore the arraignment of such person for
such offense, unless he shall meanwhile
have absented himself from the United
States, in which case the time of his ab
sence shall be excluded in computing the
period of limitation."
MONEY ORDERâ Subscriber, City. If
a letter containing a money order reached
this city addressed to one of two men of
exactly the same -name, the postal au
thorities would in the first place endeavor
to ascertain which of the two it belonged
to, before delivery. Then if by chance it
got to the wrong individual and he at
tempted to cash the order, he would have
to give satisfactory evidence of title to
the money to the postal authorities before
the money would be paid. The case sub
mitted is an assumed one, and this depart
ment does not care to answer inquiries of
that character.
COIN QUESTIONSâ Many Subscribers, i
The following are answers to a number
of subscribers who want to know about
coins :
T. D. A., City. A half dollar of 1795 is
not a premium coin.
S., Berkeley, Cal. Of the many coins |
described in letter of inquiry there is but !
one that commands a premium. It is the j
three-cent piece (silver) of 1866. It is j
worth from 20 to 40 cents.
Subscriber, City. No premium for a ail- j
ver half dime of 1870 nor for a nickel '
three-cent piece of 1867.
H. T., Cholame, Cal. A dime of 1SÂ« j
does not command a premium.
A. D. S. f City. Half dollars of 1867 are
not premium coins.
H. S., San Jose, Cal. A half dollar of
ISO 6 does not command a premium.
W. F., City. A flying eagle dollar of
1838 is a premium coin. Dealers offer
from 820 to $30 for such.

He makes this bold assertion in face of the fact that he can
find within easy walk of his residence many cigar, boot and
shoe, clothing, underwear and other factories owned and od
erated by his countrymen. At the time of the passage of the
first exclusion act thousands of operatives were walking the
streets of San Francisco and other cities of this and neigh
boring States on account of having been displaced by cheaper
Chinese.
Could Quickly Replace All Skilled Labor.
The Chinese quickly learn any handicraft, and if allowed
to land without limitation would find their way into every
branch of skilled labor. The Chinese Minister admits as much
in a recent article written by him. "Experience proves," he
says, "that the Chinese as all round laborers can easily dis
tance all competitors. They can work under conditions that
would kill a man of less hardy race; in heat that would suit
a salamander or in cold that would please a polar bear, sus
taining their energies through long hours of unremitting toil
with only a few bowls of rice." He makes a strong appeal not
to renew the exclusion law for two years in order to prov<^a>
that his countrymen are not hankering- after the flesh pots of 7
America. They so dislike crossing the ocean. He must think
we have very short memories. In the seventies every vessel
arriving on this coast from the East was loaded to the run
wale with Chinese coolies, and if now given the chance, with
our vast increase of Pacific vessels, hundreds of thousands of
them would be landed here in the space of time prayed for.
Chinese Axe Bepugnant to Our People.
It is not alone for the reasons alleged by the Chinese offi
cials that citizen residents of the Pacific Coast protest against
the invasion of the Chinese, but chiefly because they are in
conflict with the betterment of industrial life, because theL
settlements and their modes of living are repugnant and a
menace to the health of our citizens and their peculiar vices
a hotbed of temptation to our youth. The Chinatowns of San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Fresno, San Jose and
many other cities in California. Oregon and Washington are
made show places to morbid and curiosity seeking visitors !n
order to see vie'e in its most beastly forms and smell ordors
that "evermore will dweil in memory dear." If some of the
Eastern sentimentalists could visit some of the places In Chi
natown where young white girls are working dally in the
employ of Chinese they would see things which "smell to
heaven" and thank God that no dire necessity forces them to
earn a living in such environments.
The reasons, therefore, why Ho Vow and Wu Tins Fang
left out the social, moral and educational objections to the
incoming: of their countrymen are obvious. They would not
like to see a comparison drawn between the domestic life of
a Chinese merchant or laborer with that of a white man of
similar occupation. Those who talk of the missionary oppor
tunities afforded to the various sects by the Chinese sojourn
ing in America do not realize that these same ChinesÂ© are
many of them debauching our youth in opium joints amiW
other dÂ«ns of vice. n.
There are then points of view about the Heathen Chinee not
so roseate as those drawn by the Chinese officials. Statistics
verifying my statements are ready to hand. The facts pre
sented to the United States Senate investigating committee
that visited San Francisco prior to the passage of the exclu
sion laws are as pertinent to-day as they were at that time
and should be again brought forward. The Chinese Exclusion
Convention which meets to-day has plenty of work in hand,
which. If well done, is bound to produce good fruit.

COLONEL TALKS
WITH ENGINEERS
Holds Conference With
Representatives of
the Union.
Promises an Investigation
of Grievances of the
Engineers.
The trouble in the transport service
arising from the refusal of the engineers
of the transport Meade to take that ves
sel to sea with an insufficient crew in the
engineering department is in a fair way
of being adjusted. A committee repre
senting Marine Engineers' Union No. 'ij
held a conference yesterday afternoon
with Colonel l>ing, Captain Barneson,
Captain Matthews ar.u Air. Humphries of
tne transport service. The uiilieuities
were thoroughly discussed, and after the
meeting the representatives of tne engi
neers expressed the opinion that the dis
pute would soon be settled.
The committee which appeared for the
Marine Engineers' L'nion consisted of
Henry B. lister, John J. Scary, H. J.
Woftens, Edward Murphy and Alexander
Hyde. Colonel Long, who is at the head
of the Pacific division of the transport
wrvtoe, stated that the reason why a
decrease in the number of men employe-!
in the engineering department of the
transport Meade had been attempted was
because the head of the service at Wash
ington had issued positive orders that
there must be a reduction in the amount
Of money that was being spent in this
division. Colonel Long promised the com
mittee that if the reduced crew on tlie
Meade was found to be inadequate an ad
dition y.'ould be immediately made.
The delegation from the marine engi
neers refused to make known any deci
sion reached in the conference until after
the -whole matter had been properly re
ported to the union. The members of the
committee expressed themselves greatly
pleased with the courteous treatment
they had received at the hands of Colonel
Long and his associates. They stated
that the colonel had promised to faith
fully investigate every grievance which
the committee brought to his attention.
LYNCHING SUSPECTS TO
BE PLACED ON TRIAL
State Officials Leave for Modoc
County to Prosecute Leventon,
Brown and Eades.
Deputy Attorneys General Post and
Sturtevant left last night for Modoc
County to prosecute Leventon. Eades and
Brown, the three Lookout lynching sus
pects now in confinement and awaiting
trial at Alturas.
The State officials expect to be beset
by many difficulties on account of popu
lar sympathy with the accused men. At
torney Ueneral Ford ha? stated that he
thinks there is sufficient evidence in the
hands of the authorities to secure con
viction under ordinary circumstances.
The citizens of Alturas have, however,
serenaded the prisoners with a brass
band and even the District Attorney hn.s
requested that the case be dropped be
cause no one wanted to see the suspects
convicted. Attorney Raker, counsel for
the defendants, states that a conviction
of his clients is not even a remote possi
bility.
Huston Recovers Money Loaned.
Harry V. Huston, who advanced R. A.
Bogge;=s and K. C. Plummer $10,000 on
their joint notes in May, 1893, and who
sued them for that amount and interest,
secured a judgment against the borrowers
yesterday in Judge Graham's court It
was stipulated by the attorneys that a
payment of $1900 should be made next
month nnd that the balance should be
paid in July. 1902.

A PESTIFEROUS GERM.
Burrows Up the Scalp Into Dandruff
and Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that it Is the result
of dandruff, which Is caused by a pestif-
erous paraeite burrowing up the scalp as
it dig's down to the sheath in which the
hair Is fed in the scalp. Before long the
hair root is shriveled up and the hair
drops out. If the work of the germ is not
destroyed hair keeps thinning till bald-
ness comes. The only way to cure dan-
druff is to kill the germ, and until now
there has been no hair preparation that
would do It; but to-day dandruff is easily
eradicated by Newbro's Herpicide. which
makes hair glossy and soft as ?Hk.

cold last week, which annoyed me considerably, but I was cured
in less than four hours after taking Halpruner's. If any one
doubts : that Halpruner's will cure colds Â«end them over to me.

and Tuesday S. W. Saalburg. secretary
of the company, secured a warrant fjom
Judge Cabaniss to search her temporary
residence at 712 Van Ness avenue for thÂ«
purpose of obtainjngc possession of a seal
skin coat. The warrant was given to De
tective Harper and he made & return yes
terday that he had made a thorough
search of the residence, but had failed to
find the coat, and theÂ»e the matter rests.
It appears that Lady Yarde-Buller sent
the coat to the company to be repaired
and altered. Friday last she called at
the store and the coat was fitted on her.
She expressed her satisfaction with ths
workmanship and was told that the bill
was $10*).
"You can charge the amount to my ac
cour.t," said her ladyship.
"You have no credit here," said the
saleswoman who waited on her, "and you
must pay cash."
â¢'I am Lady Yarde-Buller," said her
ladyship, "and I tell you to charge It to
my account."
The saleswoman asked her ladyship to
wait till she went and consulted with the
manager. She went away for that pur
pose, and Lady Yarde-Buller walked out
of the store with the sealskin coat on her
back.
The company made a demand for the
return of the coat or the money, but both
w<?re refused, and a resort was made to
the courts in the shape- of the search war

ELECTS CAPTAIN G. W. WITTMAN
CHIEF OF POLICE DEPARTMENT
Board of Commissioners Holds Special Meeting to Fill Vacancy and
All Members Except Mahoney Vote for the Nominee.
OF POLICE GEORGE
f * W. WITTMAN was elected
(JL^> chief of the â¢lepartment, to serve
for four yearÂ«. at a special meet
ing of the Police Commissioners,
held yesterday afternoon.
After the adjournment of the regular
meeting of last Tuesday night the Com
missioners held a number of consulta
tions and decided that the best interests
of the department and the city at large
required that a Chief rhould be elected
without further delay.
Yesterday's special meeting was an
nounced for 3 p. m., and at that hour
President Xewhall ana Colonel ; Howel!
arrived at the board rooms in the Hall of
Justice. Fifteen minutes later Commis
sioners Wallace and Mahoney reached
the place of meeting and the board was
then called to order.
It was known that Xrwhall and How
ell favored th-? election of Captain Wit*
man last Tuesday nUl.\ but Judge Wal
lace postponed action by opposing the
board's desire to consider the matter at
that time. Mahoney all along announce!
himself as against Wiltmann's selection,
and at the meeting yesterday did not
hesitate to mike an ill-timed attack on
the merits of Wittman.
Judge Wallace delivered a speech, in
which he gave his reasons for voting for
Wittman's appointment, while Xewhall
and Howell felt that the occasion r;
quired no explanation for their affirma
tive votes, after the views of Judge Wall
ace were expressed.
President Xewhall. in calling the meet
ing to order, announced that it had been
arranged for the purpose of electing a
Chief of the Police Department to suc
ceed the late William P. Sullivan.
Secretary Cadwalladcr called the roll of
the board and President Newhall then
asked for nominations for the vacant
office.
â¢ Commissioner Mahoney endeavored to
block any action by saying that as Mayor
Phelan was an ex-officio member of the
board, it should not -take any action in
his absence.
President Newhall announced that ho
had spoken to the Mayor about the mat
ter, and that the chief executive had In
formed him that he did not desire to at
tend the meeting.
Colonel Howell then placed the name
of Captain Wittman in nomination and as
no other candidates were put forward the
president declared the nominations
closed.
President Xewhall :i:iormed his asso
ciate Commissioners that when the vote
was taken it should be by affirmative and
negative answers. - .
The secretary then billed the names of
the Commissioners, tins first to respond
being Judge Wallace.
Wallace Compliments Wittman.
Judge Wallace, in voting for Wittman.
said:
In this connection I wish to say that it has
been a matter of a great deal of consideration
as far as I am concerned In the election of a
Chief of Police â and I think my associates have
also given the matter of the selection of a
Chief careful consideration In trying to find a
man who could fill this important place for us.
Of course there are ether men who might fill
this office properly, and every good citizen
wishes to tee the office filled by a man who
ran preserve the order and keep the peace. I
have looked into th's matter carefully and be

MAX SELECTED BY THE POLICE
COMMISSIONERS TO BE CHIEF
OF THE DEPARTMENT.
leve that Captain Wittman has seen service
for a number of years In discharge of police
duties and has always shown a high capacity
in that direction.
T\'hÂ»n I pause to think of the administration
of the Police Department under Chief Crowley
we know and I know that the administration
of Crowley received the approbation of every
body and when any important piece of work
was to be done in the department Chief Crow
ley would always select Captain Wittman to
go to the front, even taking him from hi?
district, v.here his servlfe?' were needed, and I
believe that Captain AVittman was always suc
cessful in th*- clip-harKe of his duties.
I have no doubt, and even am so informed,
that if chief Crowley were here to-day
ho would vote for this man. Our late lament
ed Chief of Police Sullivan, whenever he was
absent on account of sickness or otherwise, al
ways nominated Captain Wittman to be act-
Ing Chief. J!e has repeatedly done this, and
nt th? last moment, when the late Chief died.
Captain Wittman was selected to represent
him. All these facts bring to mv mind the
fact that we are making no mistake in our
selection and that we are not petting a new nor
an untried man. but that we are getting a man
who has received the approval and approba
tion of nil the Chiefs of Police under whom he
has served.
I am sure the late Chief wan highly appre
ciated by all in this city and county as an
honorable, conscientious and. a good man. Ac
cording to my best Judgment and to all the
ideas 1 have been able to reach, and considering
all the Information that I have been able to
get, and as I firmly believe, I think that in
Caj.tain Wittman we will find a man who will
perform those high duties In an honorable and
efficient manner. He is no doubt n man of
great capacity, and has been tried and has
not been found wanting. I have not been able
to find any one to come up to Captain Witt
man in these qualifications, hence I vote for
him.
Mahoney Attacks Nominee.
Commissioner Mahoney, who voted
against Wittman, then rose and said:
I agrpe with Judge Wallace that a man se
lected for this office should be possessed of
many qualities, a man of unquestioned honesty
and unquestioned Integrity, a man of clear
common sense and good Judgment, who is so
sltuat<--<1 that hÂ° would not engender discord or
discussion amon| the people. I believe that
Captain Wittman does *not fill these conditions
and I cannot conscientiously vote for him I
think the Judge Is mistaken when he says that
Captain Wittman wan always selected In the
late Chief's absence to act in his place. It Is
my recollection that It was his custom to se
lect Captain Seymour. On the occasion of his
last Illness Captain Seymour was not selected
because he was out of the city at the time. I
believe that the time has now come when the
methods at present In use in the Police De
partment have passed.
I do not believe that under ordinary circum
stances, when there is dissension among the
people, it is necessary to use force or
even harsh language. I believe that the citi
zens of San Francisco are the most orderly in
the world when assembled in large gatherings
and the easiest handled, and I do not believe
that people should be handled In a brusque and
rough manner as they have been. Those police
methods have passed. From my observations
I do not believe that the candidate named is
possessed of the advanced class and Ideas of
what a Chief of Police should be possessed of.
Consequently I find It Incumbent upon me to
decline to vote for Captain Wittman and will
r.ot suggest any other name, as I do not desire
to place anybody In the position of being In
personal antagonism to the Chief who will be
elected.
When President Newhall announced the
result of the election, he requested Ser
geant Gl*Â»ason to call Captain Wittman
into the board room.
Captain Wittman. the new Chief, en
tered the room and after saluting: stood
at attention in front of the Commission
ers" table.
President Xewhall. addressing the now
Chief, said: "I wish to say to you that
the Board of Police Commissioners has
rlectod you Chief of Police of the city of
Fan Francisco."

Would Not Prosecute Her.
Ada Carothers, who was accused of
grand larceny for stealing two diamonds
and a pearl ring from Mrs. W. Gage, 554
McAllister street, appeared before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday. Mrs. Page told the
Judge that she had promised the girl
that if she returned the jewelry she would
not prosecute her. The girl had done
so. and Mrs. Page Said she would keep
her promise and not swear to a complaint
The Judge had to dismiss the case.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1901.
"I wish to thank you very kindly for
thi* high honor conferred upon me," an
swered Captain Wittman, "and I wish to
say to you and to the public in general
that no act of mine while in office will
bring the blush of shame on your or their
cheeks. Gentlemen, I thank you again."
The new Chief of Police then shook
hands with all the Commissioners and he
was congratulated by the officials and
many of the hrads of the various
branches of the Police Department.
Life of the New Chief.
George W. Wittman was born on June
28, 1857, in Hastings, Minn., and came to
California via the Isthmus of Panama
with his parents when he was six months
old. The family first settled in Amador
County, Wittman's father taking up min
ing. When George W. Wittman was 13
years old his fa.ther moved to San Fran
cisco and the new Police Chief has re
sided in this city since that time. He
was educated in the public schools of
San Francisco and was apprenticed to a
plumber, learning his trade thoroughly.
Wittman was appointed a patrolman on
the police force on April 23, 18S2, and for
five years patrolled Kearny street, from
California to Market.
In August, 18SS, he was promoted to be
sergeant and on April 1, 1895, was made
a lieutenant. On July 31 of the same year
he was made a captain to succeed Cap
tain Douglass, who retired. Wittman was
placed in command of the northern po
lice district, the most important in the
city. It embraces ail the territory north
of Market street and west of Front street.
During the recent labor troubles Witt
man was in charge of the police officers
detailed by the late Chief Sullivan to
maintain order in the business districts
and on the water front. He was an able
aid to the late Chief during the time that
President McKinley was a guest of San
Francisco and on all occasions has shown
himself fearless and faithful in the exe
cution of his duties.
The new Chief takes his new honors
modestly. He said his aim would be to
please the entire community and that he
would be accessible to any one who de
sired to see him on business of the de
partment.
The widow of the late Chief Sullivan
yesterday presented the new Chiet of Po
lice the gold badge worn by Colonel Sul
livan during his tenure of office. Chief of
Police Wittman was a close personal
friend of the late Chief Sullivan and his
solicitude during Sullivan's last illness
was most pronounced.
There was general satisfaction express
ed last evening In the Police Department
and throughout the city that Wittman
had been elected as head of the Police
Department.
Chief Wittman received the following
congratulatory telegrams on his appoint
ment last night:

CRIPPLES DEFEAT
PENNANT WINNERS
Play Sharp, Snappy Ball
at Recreation
Park.
Streib Makes Most Sensa
tional Catch of the
Season.
The Oakland cripples surprised both
themselves and their admirers yesterday
by defeating the San Franciscos by a
score of 6 to 3.
The Oakland aggregation played good
ball, although they would have doubled
their score had they been able to hit
more opportunely. Twice they had three
men on bases and any kind of a hit would
have been good for one or more runs, but
they were not equal to it.
The sensational play of the day and
one of the greatest ever seen on the
grounds was Streib's catch of Schwartz's
hit to right field in the fourth inning.
Streib had an unusually long run on a
heavy, slippery field for the ball. He
stopped it high in the air with his right
hand and the ball dropped into his left
hand. The small attendance of spectators
applauded tho play and greeted Streib
with applause when he returned from the
field.
In the next inning Schmidt flew to Nor
dyke at center field. The catch was al
most a duplicate of Streib's.
Oakland commenced its run-getting In
the first inning. Mohler, Dunleavy and
Streib were on the basea and Babbitt's
two-bagger sent them all scurrying home.
In the fourth Inning, with Mohler on
second, Streib sent the ball to right field
fence. It hit the top rail and bounded
back into the lot, robbing the batsman of
a home run. Mohler scored on the hit.
Shay's carelessness in the seventh let
in two runs. Francks hit a pop fly to
him and he was so sure of It he let
the ball slip through his fingers. Han
sen and Schmidt scored.
The Wasps captured their runs in the
first two innings. In the first Nordyke
started proceedings with a two-bagger
and scored on Hildebrand's out at first.
In the second inning Krug was hit by
pitcher and Shay sent the ball over cen
ter field fence for a home run. This
ended the run getting. Some of the wags
among the spectators whistled Chopin's
funeral march and directed It at the
Wasps as an intimation they were "dead
ones" yesterday.
Schmidt carried off the pitching honors,
having good control and great speed. He
walked only one man. The score:

EONIC IS BEATEN ONLY A HEAD
BY THE FAST MUDLARK ORDNUNG
Big Crowds at Oakland Racetrack and the Talent Continues Its
Bombardment of the Books â Johnny Woods in Fine Form*
ONLY through hla superior knowl
edge of saddle tactics did Johnny
Woods save the crack Schorr
mud horse Ordnung from defeat
at Oakland track yesterday. More
coin than half a dozen stevedores could
handle was banked on the chances of
Ordnung, until the price reached 2 to 5.
The event in which he figured was third
on the programme, and at the start
"Woods had the favorite away, sailing. In
the stretch Eonic, with Hoar and but 9<
pounds up, introduced herself to the
leader. Caesar Young's filly proved a
more than Interesting traveling compan
ion and, had Woods not finally been gen
uinely scared and bumped her with Ord
nung three or four times in a rude ana
insulting manner, she would have won.
As it was, the favorite appeared fortu
nate indeed to score by a neck. No one
will complain at a rider being ambitious
and doing his best to win, but when he
resorts to questionable jockeying it s a
ferryboat to a peanut stand that sooner
or later his mount will be disqualified by
the officials in the stand. FnzKanet, the
St. Louis mudlark, ran third in the race
mentioned and with more racing luck
might have taken a larger slice of the
purse.
Favorites Splash Home.
Number "One" mud it was that covered
th ; track, soft and somewhat sloppy, and
four more favorites splashed home first.
It made the third or lourth straight day
that the talent had worsted the books
and some few layers of odds are becom
ing nearsighted for a "good
break."
Floronso, a rejuvenated cripple, won
the introductory mile run at odds of 5
and 6 to 1. He led the favorite, Darlene,
from the start, beating Dr. Rowell's filly
by three open lengths. Commonwealth
Attorney ran third.
If Essence, the even-money favorite for
the mile and a sixteenth event which fol
lowed, had been compelled to run thirty
yards further he would not have won.
For a mile the Burns & Waterhouse en
try seemed to be only galloping, then
the gelding began backing up and, hard
pressed at the wire, led Bonnie Lissak
out a neck. Cromwell lost the show to
Castake by twenty lengths.
About the only starter in the four fur
long selling affair that could get within
hailing distance of Sea Lion was The
Singer. The last-named horse looked to
have a chance once during the race but
found the clip too rugged, and the fa
vorite enjoyed an easy victory. Old Ring
master dropped into the show at odds
of 30 to 1.
Racing Head and Head.
Green Morris scratched Homestake
from the five furlong two-year-old scram
ble and P. Guilfoyle's Redan went to the
post a hot favorite. The first choice acted
badly over at the barrier but finally got
away very well and won all the way.
Sister Jeanie cut quite a dash In second
place as far as the stretch, but, not being
up to a gruelling race, fell out of it.
Josie G finished a close second, four
lengths ahead of Dean Swift.
Winnie O'Connor's mount, Dunblane,
carried the bulk of the coin bet on tne
closing mile run, decided under selling
conditions. Racing head and head almost
with Alfred C, Jockey Birkenruth, on
Lodestar, caught the two leaders all out
and landed the outsider a handy first.
In a fierce drive Dunblane just beat Al
fred C a neck for second place.
Track Notes.
O'Nell. the clever lightweight who made
such a hit riding at St. Louis the past
season, will arrive to-day. The youngster
can do 90 pounds and comes under en

HANLON DEFEATS
JOCKEY BENNETT
Clever Bantam-Weights
in a Remarkable
Fight.
Eddie Hanlon gained the decision over
Jockey Bennett in a four-round boxing
bout last night before the Bay City Ath
letic Club at the Mechanics' Pavilion
Annex after one of the most sensational
fights ever seen here. The two bantam
weights stood up and fought every mo
ment of the four rounds.
When the gong sounded Bennett at once
landed some stinging blows on Hanlon's
head and had him slightly in distress.
Toward the end of the round Hanlon sent
a straight left to the head, scoring a
clean knockdown. The second round com
menced with a great exchange of rights
and lefts, neither youngster flinching from
the punishment. During the rounu each
had the other groggy. The best blow of
the round was a right swing to the face
which Bennett landed.
Jockey Bennett was knocked down in
the third round, but came strongly in the
stretch run and scored two rights to the
head.
Hanlon was the aggressor in the last
round, Bennett clinching to avoid punish
ment. He made one stand, but Hanlon
took all the punishment he could give and
just at the end of the fight knocked him
down. The house was In a turmoil during
the entire bout, all tWfe spectators being
on their feet, while a surging, swaying
mob surrounded the ring, urging on the
"game little boxers.
Bob Johnson and Dick Cullen were the
first brace in the ring. They went at It
from the start and fought fast throughout
the four rounds. Johnson was slightly
heavier than his opponent and this toid
before the end of the fight. He won on
points.
Joe Angell and Bob Thomas looked like
a part of a klnetoscope pictureâ arms and
legs flying about In a weird manner.
Neither could hit a clean blow, but they
furnished plenty of amusement for the
spectators. It was called a draw.
William Ingham and Jim Richards
fought four rounds, the latter getting the
decision.
Ed Martin stopped Jack SulUvan In the
fourth round. He wore down his man
and a blow In the stomach did the busi
ness. In the second round Martin had
Sullivan groggy and it seemed the end
was near. In the third round Sullivan
outgamed him and fought him to a stand
still. Martin came back the stronger
and won.
George Peterson gave Pete McGee his
customary beating. Peterson knocked
him down twice and cut him badly.
Joe Hill knocked out Jack McDonald in
the second round. The latter was un
necessarily punished. For a time it seemed
a tragedy would be enacted. The referee
should never have permitted the finishing
blows to be delivered as McDonald was
helpless. He was a long time regaining
consciousness.
James McDevitt was referee and Jim

CROWDED HOUSE HEARS "DIE MEISTERSINGER"
AND ENJOYS ARTISTIC WAGNER PRODUCTION
Bispham and De Reszke
Receive Rounds of
Applause.
Singers and Orchestra
Interpret Music
Supsrbly.
Blanche Partington
WAGXER in cap and bells is a
new Wagner to most of us here,
and to judge by la6t night's re
ception of "Die Meistersinger"
at the Grand Opera-house bids
fair to rival the master in his more fa
miliar heroic mood. There was another
huge audience, and between its delight
â and surpriseâ in the rollicking and Jov
ial humor of the opera and the beauty
of its interpretation, it outdid itself in
the way of applause, succeeding in get
ting the very unusual concessionâ in Wag
nerian operaâ of an encore, for the stately
quintet at the second act's close.
"Die Meistersinger " is a cruel Joke on
the critics, composed, seemingly, to prove
that Wagner was fully capable of writing
all the contrapuntal and other platitudes
that they had accused him of being un
able to conceive. First one threadbare
phrase and then another, in the Handel
manner, according to Bach, a Haydn
scrap, a bit of Corelli's quaint archaism,
make their appearance in the score with
simply lrresisuble effect. Then they are
bunched together, for Herr Wagner was
not conteni with simply imitating one
man at one time but lumped then, in
lordly fashion into a joyful contrapuntal
estacy that combines all their difficulties
at once. The music laughs and grimaces
at his critics from, one end of the score
to the other, from ti.e Handelian "Tabu
lature,"
Each Master- Slnsrer-created stave,
Its regular measurement must have,
By sundry regulations stated.
That never must be violated,
to Beckmesser's conventional plagiarisms
scattered throughout the drama. All thin
with Wagner at his most melodious for
contrast. The astounding climax of the
second act, a chorus with an absolute
naturalism of expression â it is a crowd
of journeymen in a casual fight, who don't
stand in rows and sing in rows about the
troubleâ is a particularly choice contrast
to other choruses one is haplessly fami
liar with. The quintet, the encored quin
tet, is another of Wagner's small jokes on
the conventionalists, and last night the
audience laughed with the orchestra quite
as much as at the hardly more tangible
jests of the singers.
The individual success of the evening
was Mr. Bispham's Beckmesser, a superb
effort. It is not often the humorous side
of Mr. Bispham gets a chance, but in the
soured and crabbed master singer he has
an opportunity to show what the mis
chievous twinkle, in what is sometimes
Wotan's off eye. means. It means for
Beckmesser a reading of the part that
could not be bettered, with a beautiful
unconsciousness of its humor. Beckmes
ser is the incarnation of all the critics
whom Wagner despised, the academic
genius to whom the new is necessarily
the worthless, who sees music only in the
set phrase and time-worn rhythms that
have served bygone centuries to weari
ness.
His talent is wholly imitative, and his
particular pleasure to blast the heterodox
genius in the bud. Mr. Bispham paints
every phase of the character with bril
liant skill; the sour unbelief in the new
beauty, the pompous consequence of the
burgher, the vain, meddlesome, snarling,
quarrelsome character of the man. His
interpretation has a Shakespearean flavor
about it in its rugged strength and hu
mor, and he Bang with every note in
stinct with the spirit of the rQje. His
make-up was another touch of genius
and he looked like one of Franz Hals'
burgomasters.
De Fteszke's Hans Sachs, the poet-shoe
maker of Nuremburg. also was of the
glories of the performance. He sang
superbly and his noble characterization
of the part set it with the long gallery
of masterpieces that he has furnished for
our pleasure. His "Mad" song was
beautifully given â again with a Shakes
pearean suggestionâ and in his song with
Eva and Walter he displayed an unusual
tenderness and depth of feeling. Dippel
was the Walter and to me he is not suf
ficiently heroic in the part. His voice is
fresh, young, strong, but there is not
enough of it, nor here, of the necessary
dramatic impetus. But he is always an
attractive figure and as the youthful
knight he was not lacking in his custom
ary charm. "The Prize Song" failed to
rouse the audience as it should have done
by reason of the effort of its singing.
Mme. Gadski is a delicious Eva and was
in her usual sweet voice last night. She
showed a tender coquetry and archness in
the part that one does not commonly as
sociate with her art and was altogether
charming as Pogner's daughter. She was
bombarded with bouquets from all sides
of the house. Schumann-Heink had too
little to do with that glorious voice of
her?, but did it handsomely and the rest
of the work was acceptably undertaken
by Mr. Blass as Pogner. Mr. Muhlmann
as Kothner and Mr. Reiss, who gave a
vocally pleasing rendering of David's part.
A pleasant feature of the affair was the
appearance of six San Francisco girls
among the apprentices, pupils of Mrs.
Anna yon Meyerlnek. who must be con
\ gratulated on their very successful work.

First Production of the Opera and Groat Cast
Fills the Grand Opera-House.
THE big audience that filled every
nook and corner of the Grand |
Opera-house last evening had the
extreme pleasure of hearing for the
first time in this city-Wagner'a "Die
Meistersinger," that is so unlike anything
associated with the ordinary conception of.
music of the famous composer.
Fancy a Wagner composition Â¦with an
absolute comedy element all through it.
Yet that is what the audience enjoyed for
almost four hours last night.
The audience was as big as the one that
listend on Tuesday evening to "Le Nozze
di Figaro" and as fashionable as that
which greeted Calve on Wednesday night
in "Carmen."
There was a repetition of the gay scene
enacted during the hour previous to the
commencement of the performance. There
was the long line of those waiting to se
cure "standing room" in the theater and
dozens of carriages with exquisitely
dressed women and men in evening garb
arriving at the entrance to the opera
house.
Not only the novelty of a new opera,
but the superb cast put forward by Man
ager Grau served to attract a throng.
Many scores were seen in all parts of the
house and the" work of singers and or
chestra was closely followed,

The story of "Die Meistersinger" does

A new council of the National Union,
which has been named El Capltan, has
been organized by Deputy J. N. Bunting,
with twenty-eight members. Joseph A.
Wilson has been chosen president, O. ,M.
Katz recording secretary and J. E. Paige
finanoial secretary. The council held its
first meeting last night and initiated two
strangers, after which there was a social
hour, and speeches for the good of the
order were made by Deputy Bunting,
Laurence Vincent, H. F. Maas, L. de Car

appointed a visiting committee to visit the
seven other councils in this city to invite
the membership to pay a fraternal visit

Walter yon Stnlzing. a young knight,
determines to win Eva, who already loves
him. Pogner and Beckmesser, the marker
at the trial of voices, take charge of the
details of the contest. Beckm^sser Is also
an aspirant for the hand of Eva and he
discounts the chances of the young
knight by marking the slate full of er
rors when Walter sings his song.
Hans Sachs, the cobbler bard, stands
by the young knight and determines to
help him to win Eva in marriage. In
the second act Eva and Walter are about
to elope, but Hans Sachs prevents that
step. Beckmesser comes to serenade Eva
and prepares to sing the song he is to

presence of the guilds, Beckmesser fails
to please with his song and Walter is
declared the winner of the prize.

CLAIMS HIS AUNT HAS
TURNED HIM ADRIFT
Frankie Watson, a Thlrteen-Year-Oid
Boy, Tells Romantic Story to
the Police.
A boy about 13 years of age was discov
ered yesterday morning about 9 o'clock
scratching a window in Raphael's store
on Kearny street with a long nail. Po
liceman Ross' attention was called to the
boy and he took him to the City Prison,
where he gave his name as Frankie Wat
eon and told a romantic story, which
may have been evolved from his own
i imagination.
Frankie said he belonged in Correction
ville, lowa, a village about thirty miles
from Sioux City, where, for the last five
years, he had lived with his aunt, Martha
Watson. About two weeks ago she said
she was going to San Francisco to meet
her husband and brought him with her.
They went to Santa Rosa and stopped at
the Magnolia Hotel. Saturday last his
aunt bought a ticket for him to this city,
and after giving him a nickel told him her
husband would meet him at the ferry. No
one met him, and since then he had been
living on crackers and sleeping in a box
in the rear of the Palace Hotel. His par
ents were dead and he had been told his
father was a cattleman and before he
died had given his aunt money to keep
him.
Judge &*itz sent him to the Boys' and
Girls' Ala Society and a dispatch was
sent to Santa Rosa Inquiring about his
aunt. A reply was received that nothing
was known about him or his aunt there.

THREE! PRINCIPALS WHO AP
PEARED LAST NIGHT IN WAG

Audience Enjoys Fine
Presentation.
close of each act.
There was considerable promenading in
the foyer and lobby last night between
the acts. There were hundreds of men
and women in the spacious balcony and
parlors on the dress circle floor and it Is
quite the fashion to meet one's friends
there during the intervals.
The merits of the opera and the effec
tive work of the singers and orchestra
were generally discussed, but there was
a tinge of disappointment hovering in the
air. It was soon knov/n after the second
act that the diva Calve would not sing
this evening in "Carmen."
Every dark cloud, however, has a silver
lining, and whiie the audience discussed
the unfortunate indisposition of Calve for
thia evening. Manager Grau was busy
telegraphing to Los Angeles and other
points, canceling engagements in order
to give six extra performances in San
Francisco, so vhat Calve might be heard
in her favorite roles.
On all sides expressions of sympathy
with Manager Grau and his associated
were heard last night ana, judging by the
remarks made, there will be no reason
for Grau to regret giving the extra per
formances.
Camille Seygard to Sing "Carmen."
The opera season is a big success, de
spite the change in programme caused by
the non-appearance Of Calve. Those who
have purchased ticket? for the nights she
was announced to sing are the first to
tender their sympathy to the singer and
the management.
"Carmen" will be sung to-night, and
Mme. Camille Seygard will be heard in
the title role, which she has sung many
times this season with marked success.
To-morrow afternoon "Lohengrin" will
be given, with Eames. Schumann-Helnk.
Van Dyck, Bispham, Muhlmann and Blass
in the cast.
To-morrow night the only performance
of "II Barbiere dl Siviglia" is to take
place, with Sembrieh, Bauermeister, Cam
panari, Salignac and De Reszke in the
oast.
Sunday night "Les Huguenots" is the
popular priced attraction, with Gadski.
Homer, Pippel. Scotti. Dufriche. Journet
and Sybil Sanderson in the bill and an
enormous house is expected for this
superb cast.
The revised programme for next week,
caused by the Indisposition of Calve, will
be found in another column.
The Borromean Entertainment.
The entertainment that was given by
Borromean Council of the Young Men's
Institute in Mission Opera Hall last night
was well attended and a decided success.
After an overture by D'Arcy's orchestra
and a few introductory remarks by Harry
McCarthy, the president of the council,
there was an address by D. J. O'Leary,
grand president of the order, whose re
marks were listened to with marked at
tention and loudly applauded. Then fol
lowed the programme of entertainment
as follows:
Soprano solo, Miss Marie Bernard: violin se
lections, John J. Doherty: tenor solo, H. B.
Dowdall; specialties. Thomas W. Hlckpy; con
tralto solo. Miss Kittle Allen; fancy dance, lit

The evening closed with dancing.
Raises Question of Jurisdiction.
When the case of Michael Welch and
W. H. Frazer, ticket scalpers, charged
with false personation by the Southern
Pacific Company, was called in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday, Attorney Murphy,
for the defendants, raised the question of
jurisdiction. Attorney Frank Kelly ap
peared for the prosecution and after argu

submit authorities on the point.

Calve Unable to Sing
Role of "Carmen"
To-Night.
Diva Must Rest, but Is
to Appear Later in
thÂ© Season. .
ME. EMMA CALVE will not
sing to-night. The exertion of
the great Carmen performance
on Wednesday night overtaxed
the strength of- the diva and her
weakened condition demands a week of
rest before she sings again.
Calve leaves this evening for Pasadena,
where she hopes a week of- perfect repose
will restore her to health. Her physicians
assure her that eight days spent in the
balmy southern land will rid her of the
last touches of the aggravating bronchial
atteck that has incapacitated her during
the past month. The great singer is con
fident of this and feels all she needs is
an equable climate and a short period of
repose. k
Calve Is not seriously ill. The fact -of
the matter is, she Should not have suns
on Wednesday evening, and she isr suffer
ing now from the effects of the exertioa
of a performance while in a weak physi
cal condition.
Late last evening the great singer sent
for Manager Grau and placed the facts
of the case before him. The impresario
readily recognized the truth of Calve' 3
argument and felt the results of taxing
the Singer in her present weakened con
dition would be as disastrous for him as
for her. So it was arranged that Calve
have her eight days of repose and return
to sing "Carmen" on Saturday evening,
November 30.
Calve is not only desirous but anxious
that San Francisco should see her at her
very best and in the operas it was origi
nally announced she should sing. Man
ager Grau is just as anxious as the great
diva that San Francisco's desire be grati
fied, and to make this possible the im
presario has canceled the engagements of
the company in Los Angeles and Dallas
and has arranged with the Grand Opera
house management to remain here until
and inclusive of Thursday evening, De
cember 5.
The repertoire for the extra perform
ances has not yet been fully decided upon.
This much, however, is understood: On
Monday evening, December 2, Calve wiil
give her incomparable impersonation of
Santuzza in "Cavalleria Rusticana," and
on Wednesday evening, December 4, she
will make her farewell appearande here hi
an opera yet to be decided upon.
Prima Donne Come to Rescue.
Calves illness, naturally, has necessi
tated the impresario making different ar
rangements. Mr. Grau's other prima
donnes have come gallantly to the rescue
and the repertoire for next week, will not
be materially disarranged. "Faust" will be
given as announced on Monday evening,
November 25, Mme. Eames sustaining the
role of Marguerite, in which she has
achieved some of her most brilliant tri
umphs. Mme. Eames came with the best
of grace to the rescue of her impresario
and most kindly consented to sing the
role of Marguerite, though not obliged to
do so.
Tuesday evening "Die Walkure" will
be given, with Mme. Gadski in the role
of Sieglinde. Mme. Gadski did not wish
to be outdone in courtesy by Mme. Eames
and kindly consented to sing the role of
Sieglinde.
On Wednesday evening "Don Pasquale"
will be given as announced, with Mme.
Sembrieh as Norma, and instead of "Cav
alleria Rusticana" "Pagliacci" will be
given with Mile. Scheff. Messrs. de Mar
ch!, Campanari, Delclery and Reiss. On
Thursday evening "Die Meistersinger"
will be repeated with the same cast as
last night.
Eames Will Sing as Aida.
On Friday evening "Aida" will be given,
with Mme. Emma Eames as Aida. It is
in this role that Mme. Eames achieved her
greatest triumph in New York, where she
sang it for the first time two years ago
and made it the feature of the season
there. "Aida" will be given with an ex
traordinarily strong cast. Including Mmes.
Emma Eames and Louise Homer, Messrs.
de Marchi. Scotti, Journet and Muhlmajin.
Saturday afternoon, November 30, The
"Barber of Seville," with Mme. Sembrieh.
will be given and on the evening of that
date "Carmen" will again be given, with
Mme. Calve in the title role. The reper
toire for the remaining performances has
not yet been fully decided upon. An ex
tra matinee will be given on Monday
afternoon, December 2, when "Le Nosze
di Figaro" will be given, with the iden
tical cast that presented the opera on
Tuesday evening.
On Monday evening. December 2. as has
already been stated, Mme. Calve will ap
pear as Santuzza in "Cavalleria Rusti

SCHOOL BOARD
ON THE CAR PET
Grand Jury Investigates
Overcrowding of
Classes.
A committee of the Grand Jury, con
sisting of J. M. Ellis, chairman; John
Kennedy and S. C. Irving, had the Board
of Education "on the carpet" yesterday
regarding the overcrowded condition of
classes in the public schools. The com
mittee has already been pursuing an in
vestigation of the matter on ita own ac
count and desired to obtain from the
beard an outline of its contemplated pol
icy to relieve the congested attendance in
a number of the schools.
There were present at the inquiry Di
rectors Kincaid. Mark, Denman and Cas
aerly and Superintendent Webster. Chair
man Ellis of the Grand Jury committee
put some pointed questions to the Direc
tors as to the congested attendance In
some of the schools, with particular ref
erence to the Hearst Grammar School.
The Directors pleaded ignorance of such
a condition and made the principal of the
school the scapegoat for not having re
ported that the classes were overcrowded.
"We never knew that the Hearst School
was overcrowded," said Director Kincaid,
who was corroborated in this statement
by the other three members of the board.
"The principal of the school is certainly
at fault for not reporting the facts to us."
"Madame President," interposed Super
intendent Webster at this juncture, '"I
have been steadily reporting for months
that the Hearst School needed more
classes and teachers. My recommenda
tions were based on reports made to me
by my deputies, who had inspected the
school named."
"Well, it was your duty to report the
matter to us," said Casserly.
"I repeat," said Web3ter, "that I did
so report and the board choae to Ignore
my recommendation."
The Grand Jury committee urged the
board to take all needed steps to remedy
the matter, and Mrs. Kincaid promised
that it would certainly be attended to.
After a number of other questions as to
what the board intended to do with re
gard to building new schools the investi
gation came to an end.
The Grand Jury also investigated the
operations of the Department of Publio
Works and found everything in satisfac
tory condition.

rants and dates, had been reported, although
both vessels were looked for on Wednesday.
Both boats undoubtedly are delayed by the
strong westerly gales. The delay in the ar
rival of the Guildhall has caused a decidedly
stronger spot market. Amalias were held very
stiff at 6c yesterday, with an active inquiry
at \*c less from wholesalers and cleaners, most
of whom are in pressing need of supplies com
ing to them per Guildhall. Demand for cleaned
currants is urgent and cleaners are unable to
fill orders for immediate delivery. Should the
Guildhall be delayed into the middle of next
week the market is certain to be much higher,
as there are practically no goods here outside
those in the hands of a single large holder.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. Prices of stocks drift
ed uncertainly during: the early part of the
day's trading, the rather acute depression at
some points contrasting with steady absorp
tion at others. This irregularity gave place
during the course of the afternoon to a general
upward movement in sympathy with the not
able strength of New York Central, which
, touched I6SV2. an extreme advance of 5%, over
\ last night's price. The buying of this stock
' was on a very large scale, many blocks of 1000
'â¢ shares and upward changing hands at every
[ stage of the later advance. No news was forth
coming to explain this movement beyond the
reiterated rumors of a plan for combining the
Vanderbilt system. All of the Vanderbilts
were affected by the movement. Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern and Michigan Central,
> of which the . shares not exchanged for New
; York Central bonds are very few. sold at 347%
and 350 respectively. Manhattan was another
effective center of strength and was bought
on an enormous scale by brokers usually act
ing for inside Interests, the advance extending
to 4% over last night's price in the late deal
ings. Missouri Pacific was also lifted 2%. but
otherwise -the Gould stocks were not conspicu
ous. Under the stimulation of this aggressive
leadership practically all of the early losses
were wiped out. The most conspicuous of these
were in Great Northern preferred, which . fell
IVt under the influence of the agitation in the
Northwest against the Northern Securities
Company, Amalgamated Copper and People's
Gas. The level of prices was generally below
last night at one time during the forenoon,
while there was still apprehension that there
would be further large exports of gold on Sat
urday. There was very large buying of Read
ing, but it never rose more than a â¢ point, and
Louisville and Nashville, Chicago. Indianapolis
and Louisville, a number of the Coalers, Sugar
and Consolidated Gas were notably strong. The
developments of the day made it improbable
that further gold will go to Europe immediate
ly. These developments served to relieve anx
iety over the money outlook to a marked ex
tent and were an effective factor in causing the
late upward movement in stocks. A large de
mand to cover by shorts helped on the rise.
The market closed active and strong.
The railroad bond market was active and
prices were inclined to advance Total sales,
12,265,000.

WHEATâ The foreign markets werÂ» steady
to firm, with an advance In futures at Liver
pool.
Chicago opened steady, but - prices showed
little change during the day. There was con
siderable country buying. Continental cables
were all strortg and the seaboard reported
prospects better for a good export business.
The local talent, however, was bearish. Wires
to Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. reported St. Louis
%c higher on a very large cash business. Over
2U0,000 bushels were worked there for export
and 275,000 bushels were ordered loaded out.
There was also 200,000 bushels worked for Mex
ico in the Southwest, and the latter region re
ported a good cash demand. The Cincinnati
Price Current said that dry weather was mak
ing considerable wheat look less favorable, but
the situation was good as a rule. A large Min
neapolis mill wired that the sales of flour on
Wednesday were a third over the output.
Stocks at Minneapolis and Duluth were ex
pected to increase over 2,000,000 bushels, against
1,750,000 last week.
In this market futures were slightly off, but
spot prices were unchanged.

STOCK MARKET.
There was a good business In bonds, but
light trading In stocks on the morning session
of the Bond Exchange. Alaska Packers' was
stiff and in demand at $153 bid. but holders
asked $156. Gas and Electric was firmpr at
$42 87%(343. and there were sales of Hutchinson
Sugar at $15 75. The oil stocks continued dull.
In the afternoon Spring Valley Water was
weaker at $S7. There were no other variations.
As mentioned in The Call gome weeks ago
it is talk among the brokers that Vigorit
Powder will commence the payment of monthly
dividends with the new year, at which time,
it la estimated, from the present rate of earn
ings that there will be about $75,000 on hand.
The present intention Is from this fund to pay
dividends of 4 or 5 cents per share monthly.
A dividend at the rate of 4 cents per share
monthly would require $24,000 per year, so that
amount which it is estimated will be on hand
will be sufficient for three years, without draw-
Ing on Uie earnings of the company, which It
Is hoped will go on increasing. The company
is at present making over $3000 per month
and has about $87,000 worth of powder con
signed for sale at various points.

Trainmen Found in
Wreckage.
Enormous Amount of Mail
Destroyed in Southern
Disaster.
HEUBS. Nov. 21.â Mystery no
longer attaches to the fate of W. H.
Armitage and W. L* Case, brakemen. and
Bamuel Brown, waiter, on the Santa Fo
limited, who were reported in first ad
vices of yesterday's accident a? missing.
The three met death in its most agonizing
Ann, having been burned alive while im
gVtasaed beneath a pile of wreckage.
T&eir bodies were found to-day at the
scene of the accident, charred* so that
recognition was almost impossible. The
remains of young Case will be brough'
- Angeles. The other two will find a
sting place at Needles.
Conductor R. R. Higgins. who was in
t harge of train No. 3. was conscious at 3
k this afternoon. His bedside was
surrounded by his wife and the other
members of his family. With the excep
tion of Hlggins and Williams, the engi
of his train, there are no other per
i-ble to explain why it was the or
riere that would have prevented the colli
sion had been disregarded
Engineer Williams is at Needles and is
injured seriously. The other members of
their train crew tnet death in the smash
up.
The entire mail carried by both trains
was destroyed by fire. At least 30,000 let
nailed in this city for the East were
yed. The east-bound limited car
t is said, seventeen pouches of let
aiid over 300 .sacks of packages and
papers. No estimate of the amount of
mail on the west-bound train is obtaina-
Neither train carried a mail car, the
mail being taken on the through baggage
No registered mail was lost, nonv
carried on the limited trains.
The injured trainmen brought to this
-oon after midnight remained on the
Train until this morning, when they were
removed to the hospital by Drs. Morris
Wing. The victims of the disaster
:aken to the hospital number thirteen. Of
all will probably recover, with the
afr ption of R. R. HiprF;"" conductor of
" He was badly scalded and bruised
la not expected to live. All the se
riously injured are trainmen and dining

injuries, the passengers were unhurt.
The passengers of the west-bound train.
f whoa reached here early to-day,
relate various expe-iencee of a thrilling
r.ature. Many of them suffered slight
md bruises from glass or from the
eudder. stopping of the trains. All agree
the west-bound train was running
very fastâ probably fifty miles an hourâ
and the effect of the collision was some
- terrible. One of the most unusual
es of the wreck is related by B. R.
Woodworth cf Rushland. Cal. He was
.-'.ightly cut and lamed, but not seriously
hurt. Speaking of his experience, Wood
worth said: .
"One of the trains was going fifty mileÃ
an hour and the other thirty-five when
they struck. I was sound asleep and
wakened when the crash came. I couli
not f the stateroom and had to
ehoot my way through heavy plate glass
windows, for it was the only way v get
out. We crawled through the glass after
I had shot it so that we could."
lEBBIBLE SCENE AT WBECK.
Passenger Tells How Injured Were
Brawn From Debris.
i Frank H. Buck, the banker and orchard
tift of Vacaville, was in the train wreck
ca the Santa Fe near Franconia. with
ilrs. Buck, their sons and Mr. Buck's sis
ter, Mrs. J. B. Cory of Campbell. Mr.
Buck gives a graphic description of the
catastrophe. He said last night at the
Palace:
â¢'in many respects the wreck was a
most remarkable one. Those two magni
ficent trains, among the finest in the
country, crashed together at full speed.
The two locomotives on the eastbound
train and our locomotive on No. 3 were
demolished. They simply ate their way
through each other and nothing remained
that had the semblance of an engine. And
so with me composite cars and dining
cars of each train. The wreckage was
piled twenty feet high, and yet it all re
mained heaped up on t.'ie track except
ihe pieces mat were scattered by the ex
plosion of the boiler of our locomotive.
"We were in the rear drawing-room of
the front Pullman. 1 was awake when
the accident occurred, and the Jar to our
car was remarkably slightâ not enough to
displace the drinking glasses nor to dou
ble one up In his berth. The force of the
collision was so terrific that the com
posite and dining cars crumbled like
egg shells, so quickly and so gradually
mat the strongly constructed Pullmans
were stopped by degrees.
â¢'1 was the first man out of any of the
Pullmans. In two seconds after the
crash came I had thrown up a window.
Flames were already licking upward from
beneath the center of our car. Afterward
.1 found that the trucks from the dining
"* car in front of us had been driven back
under our Pullman, so that it had four
pairs of trucks instead of two, all re
maining on the rails. These trucks had
cut the connections of the reserve gas
tank under the car and the gas had ig
nited, I presume, from the firebox of an
engine or the dining car rangesâ the
source from which the firÂ© came that de
stroyed the wreckage of the two dining
i.nd two composite cars. It is a mistake
to attribute it to the oil of the oil-burning
engines. The tender tanks were upset
and broken up a.nd the black oil ran into
a ditch beside the track and did not ig
nite.
"As I looked out of the window at the
great mass of wreckage just in front
flames just beginning to light up the dark
pile, and steam hissing far back under our
car from the engines, the scene was like
a glimpse of inferno. I tried the drawing
room door and found it jammed. I then
lowered myself out of the window. As I
looked the engineer of our train struggled
from the wreckage and came toward me,
too dazed from his injuries to know what
had happened. A moment later a dining
car waiter emerged from almost the same
spot, dressed in his night shirt and cov
ered with blood. As he came he waved his
hands in the air in agony and begged us
to put him out of his misery.
"The passengers were soon out of the
Pullmans, though many in our car left
most of their effects. My wife and son
in the drawing-room had to be helped out
through the window.
"From the wreckage there came the

ALLEGE KROUSE
IS A "POO BAH"
Sentinels of the Uni
verse Are Having
Trouble.
Charges Are to Be Preferred
Against a High Official
of Order.
H. A. Krouse. supreme sentinel of the
Order of Sentinels of the Universe, is in
disfavor with his fellow members. They
accuse him of misapplying funds and of
taking- to himseJf too many offices, fie is
looked upon as a "Poo Bah" and if the
present order of tilings continues there is
every likelihood ot a disruption of Wash
ington Council.
Trouble has been brewing in the order
for three months and it came to a climax
at the last meeting of Washington Coun
cil. Krouse, who is secretary of the lodge
as well as supreme sentinel, was asked
to give up his books. He declined to do
so and there -was a warm wrangle. A
member named Ammon lost his temper
and struck the exalted officer. Krouse
was forced to beat a retreat and later on
retaliated by suspending Washington
Council and preferring charges against
his assailant.
Members are wroth against Krouse.
They are strong in their condemnation of
the supreme sentinel and speak of depos
ing him. They claim he caused the re
moval of Herbert L. Magg^, the archi
tect, who was supreme auditor, and since
the latter's decapitation he has declined
to appoint a man to fill his place. They
further allege that Mr. Krouse, besides
being supreme sentinel, taiiee upon his
shoulders the duties of supreme secretary
and even usurps the office of treasurer.
They are tired of his Poo Bah tactics and
intend preferring charges against him for
trying to act as dictator and for using the
genera] funds without securing permission
or making returns.
Dr. Ward, the dentist, is treasurer of
Washington Council and during the last
month has waited patiently for Mr.
Krouse to make returns to him in his
capacity of secretary of the lodge.
Next month an expert will be employed
to examine the books of the organization.
If it is found that Mr. Krouse has misused
the funds of tae society suit will be
brought against him. The troubles of the
order are many and there is every likeli
hood they will be aired in court.

BRAEEMAN'S COWARDICE.
Deserts Women in Runaway Car at
Santa Fe Wreck.
Oakland Office San Francisco CalL
118 Broadway, Nov. 21.
Mrs. H. H. Gribben of this city, one
ol the passengers in the Santa Fe col
lision in Arizona yesterday, returned to
her home at 931 Popiar street, this morn
ing, after having undergone an experience
thrilling as anything in the record of
wrecks on land or sea.
Mrs. Gribben and her husband were pas
sengers on the eastbound train, No. 4.
They were bound for Pittsburgh and had
with them the body of Miss Blanche
Thompson, who died here last Friday and
who was a niece of Mrs. Gribben.
The body was in a composite car in
the front part of the train and was cre
mated in the holocaust which followed
the collision.
Although badly shaken up, the Grib
bens were uninjured. The train crew,
fearing danger to the passengers from
lir\ placed Mr. and Mrs. Gribben, Miss
Mazlett or Riverside, . who was on her
way to Boston, and tnree injured porters
en board an observation car, which was
put in charge of a brakeman and cut
loose from me burning train.
The observation car started down grade
and was rattling along at a lively pace
when the braKeman discovered that the
brakes would not work.
The situation was desperate. The run
away car, gaining speed with every revo
lution of me wneela, was speeding to
ward The Needles. On the same track
and coming toward them as fast as
steam couiu force It was the wrecking
train. t-'.'Jh
Brakeman Deserts Car.
The brakeman know this. The realiza
lion of approaching danger seems to have
rattled him. Without a word of warn
ing he jumped from the car, leaving his
deserted charges helpless and at the
mercy of the grade.
Gribben aiso realized the danger, but
was made of sterner stuff than the
brakeman. Talking of the affair, he said:
We were left to our fate and there I was on
a runaway car that was going taster every
minute, with two women and three . wounded
I men for company.
We rushed through a little station where
some men were standing and I tried to tell
them to telegraph ahead and warn the wreck
ing- train of our predicament.
On and on we rushed. I did what I could to
calm the fears of the women and prepared as
best I knew how for another collision. Â¦
I put the two women with their backs to
the front end of the car and built a buffer
of cushions behind them. This I thought would
lessen the shock when the collision came.
We began to go up grade. This reduced the
pace somewhat, but we were still traveling at
terrific speed when I saw a mile or so ahead
what I took to be the summit of the grade.
Once over that I knew our last hope would
be gone. The speed was still slackening and I
made up my mind that In jumping lay our
only safety.
Wrecking Train Flagged.
I first helped Miss Hazlett to the platform,
held here as near the ground as possible and
dropped her. She fell on her face and breast
and although bruised sustained no broken
bones. Then I helped my wife oft In the same
way. She was not so lucky as Miss Hazlett
and sustained rather severe injury. I got the
porters off and then jumped myself. .
Before Jumping I had picked up a red flag,
! and when the car stopped, about two miles
i from where I had left it. I started out to
flag the wrecker. As I reached the car I met
a tramp. I was tuckered out and the women
1 required my attention, so I turned over the
i flag to him and he stopped the train. They
coupled on the observation car and took us
all back to the scene of the wreck.
Although I made a careful search I was
i unable to find a sign of the casket which had
i contained Miss Thompson's remains. The de
struction had been complete and- the fire had
! removed the occasion for our going to Pitts
burg. We are home to stay and glad to be
here, although I am afraid it will be many
I a day before my wife gets over the effects of
i that awful ride.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1901.
GIFT SALE FILLS EMPTY COFFERS
OF A MOST DESERVING CHARITY
Everything Is Sold Out Early at Benefit for the San Francisco Nursery
for Homeless Children â Weddings Announced.
ATTRACTIVE SCENE AT THE VERT SUCCESSFUL GIFT SALE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO
NURSERY FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN WHICH WAS HELD IN THE PALACE HOTEL YESTERDAY AFTER
NOON AND EVENING. f
FOREMOST among the many suc
cessful charity entertainments of
recent date must stand the gift
sale held at the Palace yesterday
afternoon an 3 evening for the
benefit of the San Francisco Nursery for
Homeless Children.
Society thronged the rooms early in the
afternoon, and the sale was hardly more
than a few hours old when the many
articles so temptingly d'eplayed were dis
posed of.
The ladies in charge- of the various
booths displayed their respective wares
to the very best advantage. The tables
were all attractive ant; artistic. Probably
the prettiest of all was the one where the
dainty bisque and sawdust ladies were
displayed. Never since the first year of
the doll show was a more beautiful lot
of dolls shown. Every doll disposed of at
that table was a "home dressed" one. A
"home-dressed" doll is as unlike a
"store-dressed" doll as it is possible to
find. In the first place their clothes can
come off, a consideration that always
makes a do.lie dearer to its little
"mother"; and then again the clothes are
properly fitted and neatly sewed. As eaily
as 3:30 in the afternoon every doll on tht,
big crowded table wad sold.
At the neckwear table stocks and
fancy collars and neckties were disposed
of, and disposed of early. The collection
displayed was one that, represented splen
did taste, and chic and above all the
latest novelty.
At the apron table the crowd gathered
early. The aprons displayed were of ali
styles and for all sorts and conditions of
purchasers. There w;re fine ones and
coarse ones, the tiny ones, that are
aprons by courtesy only, and the big, use
ful pinafore. All, however, found pur
chasers who pronounced them just the
thing.
Mrs. Timothy Hopkins and Mrs. I. W.
Hellman Jr. were most generous patrons
of the booths whence the dolls went
forth to new owners. Mrs. Hopkins and
Mrs. Hellman controlled the market of
the tiny bisque ladies and those in charge
of the doll booth were compelled to seek
a further supply, and, the stock replen
ished, the sale continued briskly until the
hour of closing.
At the handkerchief table some ele
gajit handkerchiefs were shown, ar.<l
some that were not quite so pretty, but
probably much more useful. There was a
rushing demand for both kinds.
At the fancy goods and art table the
display was simply magnificent. There
were some splendid samples of women's
finest work, high art, needlework and a
vast collection cf useful and ornamental
trifles.
A tiny table to the left of the doll table.
ihe doll furnishing taule, was an, $$-
tremely attractive ore to the visitor.
Everything that "do.ly" needs was dis
played there and the wee luxurious trifles
of the sawdust lady's wardrobe found
many purchasers.
The punch, lemonade and flower tables
were under one management and did a
thriving business. Home-made candy, as
well as the contectioner's candy, was
temptingly displayed at the candy table
and quickly disposed of. In the refresh
ment booth the many visitors enjoyed the
splendid coffee, refreshing tea, delicious
chocolate and fine ice cream that wa3
served them.
The grub bag did a iand office business.
It was quite the principal attraction of
the many children that came to the sale
during the afternoon. Tt was especially
attractive to the children of the nursery,
who enjoyed the pleasure of a visit.
Besides the attractions of the many
tables there was music by a string or
chestra. There was a raffle table and a
fortune-telling booth, where Foselli, ths
celebrated palmist, revealed the secrets
of the future.
The following-named ladles were in
charge of the various tables:

SIFTING MARINE
CORPS SCANDAL
Considerable Discord Is
Caused by Conduct
of Colonel Meade.
Admission of Certain Evi
dence Makes Counsel
Quarrel.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The court-mar
tial proceedings against Colonel Meade,
charged with drunkenness and scandalous
conduct, were resumed at the navy yard
to-day.
The entire morning session was devoted
to discussing the admissibtlity of the
record of the court of inquiry which was
held at the navy yard July 25, to which
T. LÂ». Semple. attorney for Colonel
Meade, strenuously objected. The court
made the following ruling:
"Any papers tending to establish the
proper and legal organization of the court
of inquiry convened at the navy yard
July 2a, 1901, may be introduced, said pa
pers not constituting testimony given be
fore said court."
Lieutenant R. S. Hooker of the marine
corps testified that he was in command
of the First Company during the bat
talion drill at the marine barracks on
June 18, and that Colonel Meade was
sober and seemed to be in a perfectly
normal condition on that occasion.
Richard D. Ware, secretary of the Purl
tan Club of Boston, testified that in Sep
tember, 1897, Major C. H. Lauchhelmer
was a guest of the Puritan Club, and
there was nothing on the records of the
club to show that the card of invitation
to Major Lauchheimer has been recalled
on account of misconduct. This was in
refutation of the statement made under
oath by Colonel Meade before a court of
inquiry held at the navy yard, Brooklyn,
on July 2 of this year. On that occasion
Colonel Meade, according to the record,
said to Major Lauchhelmer: "I have a
great many friends in the Puritan Club
in Boston. You received an invitation or
a card from the Puritan Club to be a
guest there, and your conduct was such
that they had to recall the invitation."
During the afternoon session of the
court-martial the judge advocate and
Colonel Meade's lawyer had a lively time
in reference to the admission of parts of
the record of the testimony taken before
the court of inquiry last July. Judge Ad
vocate Niblack, in order to get part of
the records before the court-martial,
called Captain B. H. Fuller of the United
States Marine Corps to the witness stand.
Captain Fuller was the advocate during
the court of inquiry, and when asked if
he were able to repeat the testimony
given at that time he said he would be
unable to give it verbatim until he re
freshed his memory from the records.
Lawyer Semple objected to this, and after
the courtroom had been cleared the mem
bers of the court held a lengthy discus
sion of the matter and finally decided
that the witness would be allowed to re
fresh his memory from the stenograph
er's report of the court of inquiry.
This ended the day's proceedings.

A situation of no little difficulty con
fronts Baroness Hengelmuller, the wife
of the Austrian Minister Plenipotentiary
at Washington. Last winter she not only
declined to hold any kind of social inter
course with the Mexican Embassadress,
but on a memorable occasion at a stace
dinner given at the White House by the
late President McKlnley created a sensa
tion by declining to accept the arm of the
Mexican Embassador or to sit beside him
at the table. The matter gave no end of
annoyance to the late President, and was
explained by the Austrian Minister on the
i ground that neither he nor his wife could
j hold any relations whatsoever with the
representatives of a Government that
had put to death his sovereign's brother,
the ill-fated Emperor Maximilian.
Since then, however, a reconciliation
has taken place between the court of
Vienna and the Mexican Government.
Diplomatic relations between the two
countries have been resumed and friendly
intercourse established, the Austrian
monarch having sent a. special embassy
to Mexico to thank President Diaz for
the part which he had taken in the erec
tion of the memorial chapel to his unfor
tunate brother at Queretaro.
It therefore becomes incumbent upon
the Baroness, whose husband is merely
a Minister Plenipotentiary, to call upon
the Mexican Embassadress, whose diplo
matic status, like that of her husband,
the Embassador, is superior to that of
the Hengelmullers. It will be a bitter
pill for the Baroness to swallow, and peo
ple in Washington are speculating as to
the extent to which Senora Aiplroz will
be willing to forget and forgive the public
affront to which the Baroness subjected
the kindly old Mexican Embassador ,v
the White House last spring.

For the benefit of The Episcopal O"Â«l
Ladies' Hcjme a delightful presentation of
the comedy. "The Peacemakers," in four
acts, was given last night at Sherman-
Clay Hall. The ladies who had charge
of the entertainment had labored dili
gently to insure a pleasant evening to all
who attended and tneir effort 3 were re
warded with success. The presentation
was under the direction of Dr. J. D. Milli
kin, and Alvin E. Hornleln acted as stage
manager.
The young people who composed the
cast had been carefully drilled in their
parts and acquitted themselves in the
most commendable manner. Many of the
situations were truly ludicrous. The cast
was as follows;
Dudley Ronover. a young banker, Waia
James Stone; Harold Rockley, his friend. E.
Guy Williams; Jack Elllnsworth, a young
Englishman, Ira S. Lillick; Cripton, Mr. Ron
over's butler. James F. Sturtevant; GUn
Kingsford, Mr. Ronover' s friend. Lela Dean
Thompson; Marvel Ronover. Dudley's wife,
Frankie Rosalynde Glaus; Louis. Harold Rocli
ley's sister, Cecile M. Sorbler: Harriet Rhodes,
an English woman, Bessie H, Bartlett.
FRENCH MINERS
FEAR A STRIKE
Many of the Federation
Members Object to
Quitting Work.
Large Force of Troops Has
Been Sent Into the
Coal Fields.
PARIS. Nor. a.â situation in the
mining centers of France is again ap
proaching a climax. The next day or two
will see a definite decision upon the ques
tion of a general strike. The result of
the recent referendum, while it gave
a majority in favor, actually indi
cated that a very considerable number â¢ t
the miners were either opposed to a
strike or were not enthusiastic. This vote
impelled the federation officials to put oS
a strike declaration, on the plea that It
was advisable to await the decisions of
the commission of the -Chamber of Depu
ties engaged in studying the demands oJ .
the miners.
It now appears unlikely that the com
mission will satisfy these demands, am:
the extreme partisans .ire endeavoring to
force the hand of the federation officials
in favor of a strike.
Already a partial strike has broken ou;.
in a coal field in the Department of the
Nord. where a general meeting of. miner.*
voted yesterday in favor of a strike an<L
sent a dispatch to M. Cotte, secretary of
the federation, calling upon him to de
clare a strike immediately. 21. Cotte de
clines to assume the responsibility ami
announce.* the holding of a final consult
ation of the various rrining centers and
the publication of thur decision In tiic
course of a day or so.
In the meantime the committee of thÂ«
important Pas de CaUrs district has pub
lished a manifesto against the declara Â¦
tion of a strike until the committee of
the Chamber of Deputies shall have con
cluded its labors, and a similar feeling 13
evinced in other districts.
Indications, therefore, go to show that
the strike, even if declared, will be only
partial and not general, and that it Is
doomed in advance to failure.
The Belgian and . Bntish miners who
have been consulted have refused to con
sent to reduce the output, although they
have promised to give financial aid. Con
sequently the opponents of the str'ke
predict that the object of the French
strikers will be defeated by the invasion
of foreign coal, including American.
The situation at present is that 4300 out
of the 15.000 miners In the Department of
the Nord have struck and about 1000 have
prone on strike in the adjacent pits of the
Pas de Calais district. The movement is
spreading in the Department of the
Nord. and It is asserted that all the mm- -
ers will cease work io -morrow.
Thus far complete order prevails, but
an imposing force of gendarmes, infan
try and cavalry has been billeted in every
coal field to cope with any disorder.
VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES
QUICKLY CRUSH REBELS
Followers of General Matos Are Now
in Jail and Peace Has Been
Restored.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â Gonzales E-
tfves, Consul General of Venezuela at

gram from Torres Cardenas, General Sec
retary of the republic:

Recorder in Fresno Explains.
FRESNO, Nov. 2L â County Recorder
Kerr, who was declared yesterday to be
$1300 short in his accounts, was called be
fore the Grand Jury to-day to account for
the shortage. Kerr explains that in Jan
uary last he held out $1000 in mining? fees,
acting under the advice of his attorneys,
who said that under the State law all
mining fees belong to the Recorder. The
$;;00 shortage in February is an error of
the accountant. Kerr further asserr
he held the money out for the mining fe^
in order to bring about a test case,
action was taken by the Grand Jury, n
far as can be learned. The general opin
ion in town is that Kerr is innocent o*
any intended crime. He admits, however,
that he used the $1000 held from the
county.

CUMMINS FAVORS
CONSOLIDATION
lowa's Governor - Elect
Sees Benefit in Rail
way Combine.
Minnesota's Executive, How
ever, Intends to Fight
the New Scheme.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The 'Mall and
Express to-day printed the following in
terview with Governor-elect A. B. Cum
mins of lowa with respect to the possible
results of the Joint control of Western
railways through the Northern Securities
Company. He said: â¢
I do not believe there will be organized op
position in lowa to the proposed combination
of Western roads. There is a wide difference
in our State as to the result of the consolida
tion. While it is recognized that the movement
places a great power in a few hands. It Is
recognized also that that power may be used
for the people's good as well as to their detri
ment. It is felt that it will eliminate cutting of
rates, rebates to large shippers and give steadi
ness to the transportation charges.
On the other hand the consolidation places In
the hands of those at the head of the move
ment a power that contains the elements of
peril. If it Is used to reduce tne accommoda
tion of the lines consolidated, to raise their
rate's and decrease facilities for shippers and
passengers in order to economize, there Is no
doubt the people will be prompt in taking such
recourse as is in their power. This would prob
ably assume the form of lawsuits and legis
lative action. If, however, the railroads in
the consolidated lines use their large powers
wisely, ,1 see no reason for them to apprehend
any trouble in lowa.
I regard the consolidation of the Northwest
ern railroads as the first step toward uniting
the interests of all the great railway systems
west of New York. When carried through it
will prevent entirely rebates and rate-cutting,
which are great hindrances In many places to
buttress. But if the powers of the nnal con
solidation are used to raise rates and decrease
facilities of shipment and travel, there is no
doubt the general Government would step in
and regulate rates.
Opposing the Consolidation.
S / I \ l .? AUL> Nov - 21 âLetters were sent
out this afternoon from the Governor's
office addressed to the Governors of North
Dakota, Montana, Washington and Ida
ho, asking co-operation in the fight
against merged railroads, and asked the
Mate executives to suggest plans for con
certed action. It is not likely that there
will be a formal meeting or conference,
but by correspondence a plan may be
agreed upon.
The Dispatch to-day says: Judge Jami
son, the Governors private secretary
stated to-day at Redwing that the Gov
ernor and the members of his official fam
ily had carefully looked into the legal
phases of the Great Northern-Northern
Pacific consolidation, and there was no
doubt that the promoters of the North
ern Securities Company were trying to
do by indirection what they could not do
directly. It was time the people were
aroused to the fact that their interests
were being encroached upon. Two com
peting lines in the same hands meant that
they would be used to further the selfish
ends of the owners. He admitted that
certain legal aspects of the Northern Se
curities Company are still in doubt, but
said that in a few days these would be
passed upon by competent legal authori
ties. No date had been fixed by the Gov
ernor for calling the conference with othtr
Governors. He declined to commit him
self with regard to an extra session, but
left the impression that one would be
called.
Does Not Interest Nebraska.
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 21.â After con
sultation with Attorney General Prout on
the advisability of taking action to pre
vent the consolidation of railroads in Ne
braska, Governor Savage qualified his
statement made yesterday by saying
there is no evidence of a combination in
Nebraska. The Governor said:
"Roads are fighting each other for busi
ness in this State just as hard as they
ever did. This applies to the Union Pa
cific and the Burlington roads, and all
other lines. What is being done in Min
nesota in the way of combination or op
position to combinations does not interest
us in this State."

SENATOR BARD'S
COUNTER MOVE
Mint SupÂ«rintendency Is
Involved in the
Patronage.
Perkins, to Save Leach, Must
Express His Feelings
Toward Lynch.
Our senior United States Senator,
George C. Perkins, is very anxious to re
tain in office his friend Frank Leach, su
perintendent of the Mint. Before the re
cent discrepancy In Mint acounts was
brought to light It was the Senator's
daily habit to point to Mr. Leach as an
exemplary officer, whose administration
of Mint affairs was so highly creditable
that there should be no question about
his retention in office. It happens that
Mr. Leach hails from Alameda County,
where Senator Perkins dwells and where
nearly all of the Federal office-holders re
side.
When the storm broke over the Mint
and centered about Dimmick the senior
Senator became uneasy and sought ad
vice from his colleague, Senator Bard.
The latter was asked to join in a request
that Mr. Leach should not be disturbed
It was known that high officers in the
Treasury Department regarded the Mint
scandal as good cause for a change in the
superintendeney, hence Senator Perkins
began to fear that more influence than
he possessed himself would be needed lo
protect his protege.
It appears from all accounts that Sen
ator Bard had made on his own motion a
pretty accurate estimate of the situation
and met the suggestion for joint action
to help Leach with a counter-proposition
to first consider the recommendation that
Stephen Kelly of San Bernardino be
named to supplant John C. Lynch as Col
lector of Internal Revenue. In the con
tention the junior Senator is said to have
displa>ed a firmness that astonished Per
kins. The affair is still unsettled. Bard
will not take up the Mint question until
Senator Perkins comes squarely to time
on the Revenue Collectorship." Bard is
firmly sustained by leading anti-boss Re
publicans in Southern California and by
quite a number of the influential Repub
lican newspapers of the State. The
manipulators of the Gage machine are
bending their energies to the task of sav
ing Lynch and seeking the help of the
Democratic yellow press. The story goes
i hat Lynch is to be appointed a" State
Harbor Commissioner for San Francisco
in the event of his removal from Federal
office. Stephen Kelly ot San Bernardino,
who is making a vigorous fi^ht for the
folleotorship. has the support of a host
of Southern Californians.
Senators Perkins and Bard will leave
California on the 26th inst., or a day or
two later perhaps, for tne National Capi
tal. At Washington a discussion of the
points involved with be renewed. There
are no signs or hints that Bard will re
cede from his position demanding a se.
tlement of the Revenue Collectorship be
fore the Mint Superintendence' is con
sidered. Perkins is pretty clever in play
ing tricks on his associates and in foolinsr
the people of California, but the mem
bers of the Congressional delegation are
r'osely watching the tinuosities of the
senior Senator.
Representative Needham is In Washing
ton, and Julius Kahn is on his way there.
Frank L. CoomLs will leave this city for
the national capital early next week.
STEAL SACK OF COIN
FROM A FRUIT STORE
While Beneditti Talks to One Thief
at Door Another Robs Money
Drawer.
Raphael Beneditti, who conducts a fruit
store on Valencia street, was robbed of a
sack containing $39 by two young men
yesterday afternoon. Beneditti was stand
ing in his store when a well-dressed young
man entered and asked him to direct him
to Hayes street. The unsuspecting: fruit
Oeaier stepped outside and showed the
cer how to reach the street he asked
Before leaving the young man apolo
gized to Beneditti for having caused him
so much trouble and after warmly shak
ing his hand promised to return ari<l leave
ier for some fruit. Beneditti then re
. to his store and. upon going be
hind the counter, was dumfounded to find
the money drawer open. Hastily peering
into it he discovered that a canvas
into which he had placed the receipts of
several dari was gone.
Suspecting that a confederate of the
affable stranger had stolr-n the coin. Bene
ditti ran outside and lusttiy shouted for
help. Police Officer Farley responded, but
1c time the brace of crooks had made
their escape.
A citizen, who was passing the store
while Beneditti was directing the well
dress^d stranger how to reach HayeÂ«
street, saw a short, thick-.-et fellow
into the store anu purloin the sack of
Bc-neditti a short time afterward
ivent to police headquarters, where he
old the story of the daring theft to Cap-
Seymour. From Bmeditti's descrip

LYNCH RECEIVES
OFFICIAL REBUKE
Failure to Investigate
a Scandal the
Cause.
Internal Revenue Collector
Gets Warning From
Washington.
The news comes from Washington that
a caustic letter has been sent from the
Treasury Department to John C. Lynch,
Collector of Internal Revenue, that is
causing that Federal official to doubt the
wisdom of wading so deep into local poli
tics. The Collector is given a pointed
"hunch" to investigate the conduct of
some of his subordinates and in sarcasm
that withered much of the self-compla
cency of Mr. Lynch, the* Commissioner of
Internal Revenue intimated that the in
vestigation might profitably extend to
himself and his administration of the of
fice.
Lynch has been promising the Commis
sioner an investigation of numerous
causes of complaint and adverse reports,
but has continued to neglect to make full
and satisfactory reports to his superior
until the Commissioner, apparently, has
become convinced of Lynch's unwilling
ness to remedy the abuses in his office.
In consequence come the peremptory in
structions from Washington and rumors
of a shake-up in the Federal building.
And Lynch's troubles are not coming
singly, for he is now in Southern Cali
fornia trying to cover up the wrongdoings
of a deputy collector in that part of the
State.
The immediate cause of the solar plexus
punch that has landed on Lynch was not,
it is said, among the more flagrant abuseb
that exist in the internal revenue ser
vice, but it happened to be an example of
the Collector's usual effort to stand be
tween his subordinates, however ineffi
cient some of them may be, and the
Treasury Department for the sake of lo
cal politics. Lynch always has an eye to
State and railroad politics, and with such
a policy any dismissal from the service
that might jeopardize his power is an im
possibility. The services may suffer, but
his fences, never.
Revelry in Bonded Warehouses.
Bert M. Thomas, Special Treasury
Agent, some time since had his atten
tion called to roystering in the bonded
warehouses. Rumors came to his ears of
gay parties with gaugers as hosts, of
maudlin toasts drunk in liquor under
bond, of bacchanalian revelries in the
warehouses at hours when Government
regulations require them to be under lock
and key, and of the silvery laughter of
women and coarse jests of men floating
out into the darkness from inside walls
that gave no other hint of the revelry
within. Thomas began looking for evi
dence, as is his duty, and in broad day
light some of the offenders put evidence
so strong into the hands of the special
agent that he based upon it an immedi
ate report to the Commissioner at Wash
ington.
Thomas, in company with Frank H.
Driscoll, special gauger, had started the
rounds of the warehouses by day. At the
brandy warehouse on Bluxome street they
came upon a giddy trio of women escort
ed by a gauger making a friendly call
upon a storekeeper gauger assigned to
that warehouse. The regulations strictly
forbid the presence at the warehouses of
persons who are not there on business,
and the offense of the gaugers in receiv
ing calls from women at such a place was
of the sort that merits dismissal.
Thomas' report was sent to Washing
ton at once, and post haste Lynch re
ceived an order from Washington to in
vestigate and dismiss the offending gaug
ers if he found the facts to be as stated
in the report of the special agent. Fol
lowing his usual policy. Lynch made a
partial report and promised full investi
gation later. The gaugers have so far
escaped the penalty of their conduct and
the Treasury Department has received no
satisfactory explanation from Collector
Lynch.
Commissioner Loses Patience.
The Commissioner, it is reported from
Washington, decided to bring affairs to
a climax. Lynch has repeatedly followed
just such a course when reports were
sent by Special Agent Thomas or some
of his subordinates of inefficiency or ques
tionable methods on the part of any of
Lynch's subordinates. Report after re
port calling attention to the failure to
correct abuses and order after order from
Washington have failed to secure the re
moval of incompetent and dishonest clerks
and gaugers. Lynch has simply squirmed
from one difficulty into another, promis
ing investigations which he never made
and reports which were never forthcom
ing. It was this long continued offend
ing on Lvnch's part that led the Com
missioner "to take up the recent scandal of
the gaugers' drinking parties as the peg
on which to hang the severest sort of a
roast for the Collector.
Lynch's period of procrastination by
way of protecting men for the sake of
politics has apparently come to an in
glorious end. The Washington authori
ties are evidently determined that an ac
counting shall be rendered, and from the
tone of tht Commissioner's letter as out
lined from Washington Lynch now has
the choice of putting his office on a busi
ness basis and giving heed to the de
mands by the Treasury Department for
efficient service, or. on the other hand,
facing the very imminent danger of los
ing his official head.
It \b said that the offending gaugers
formerly held forth in revelry with whis
ky drinking females at the "'grain ware
house" at Third and Townsend streets.
Most of the rumors of warenouse carous
als connect them with that building. It
is needless to say that gaugers are not
for the present shining as hosts at the
expense of the Government or of the dis
tillers. Their social stunts are temporar
ily suspended, and unless the Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue has a change
of heart Collector Lynch is likely to lose
some of his subordinates and be com
pelled to straighten out a lot of tangles
that he has long sought to conceal and
| ignore.

Mrs. Tibbets, a woman about whom lit
tle is known, is lying in a very precari
ous condition at the City and County
Hospital. She is unconscious and is evi
dently suffering from a severe beating.
The doctors in charge of her case do not
expect that she will survive. A deep mys
tery entirely surrounds the woman and
her case. The police have been unable
to ascertain where her home is and are
at a loss to discover where and how she
received the wounds that have caused her
present state of unconsciousness.
Mrs. Tibbets was brought to the Emer
gency Hospital at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning from 813 Mission street. Mrs.
Morgan, who resides at that number, says
that Mrs. Tibbets came to her house last
Tuesday night and rented a room. At 11
o'clock that night, she claims, the un
known woman became unconscious, and
according to Mrs. Morgan has been in
that condition ever since. Mrs. Morgan
claims that on the same Tuesday even
ing an unknown man who rented a room
at her house stated that Mrs. Tibbets had
recently been discharged from a hospital.

CONTEMPT CASES
ARE CONCLUDED
Amicus Curiae Pillsbury
Makes Closing
Argument.
The Nome contempt cases have come
to . a conclusion. Yesterday mornins
Amicus Curiae Pillsbury closed with his
final argument and now all that is neces
sary to seal the end Is the judgment of
the Circuit Court of Appeals. Five weeks
have been consumed in the taking of tes
timony and the arguments.
Pillsbury's closing argument was a
summary of the evidence, the attorney
pointing out all facts bearing upon the
contempt in any way. He did not mince
matters, and when he came to Judge
Noyes and his confederates the arraign
ment was severe and caustic.
Concluding, the amicus curiae said:
A great deal has been said about the dignity
of the courts and the presumption which at
taches to the Judge In all his actions. I con
cede there Is a presumption which attaches to
the judicial robe which almost reaches the dec
gree of sanctity. Those robes should command
the respect of attorneys and of every one but
unless a Judge shall so conduct himself as to
deserve that respect It would be much better
that all courts were abolished and that the

a new trial by the Supreme Court yes

OIL RATE CASE
IS HEARD AGAIN
New Witnesses Give
Testimony for the
Complainant.
Additional testimony was taken by the
Board of Railroad Commissioners yester
day on the Important question of the rea
sonableness of the rates charged by the
Southern Pacific Company, the Santa Fe
and other transportation lines for the
moving of California oil between the
Kern River, McKittrick, Sunset and Coal
inga liekls and San Francisco. This was
in pursuance of the decision of the board |
to grant a rehearing, with the under- j
standing that all the testimony formerly i
taken shall starfd and that only new wit
nesses shall be introduced at this time.
Attorney Short represented the compain
ant, John Le Blanc, and W. F. Herrin
and Attorney Proctor the Southern Pa
cific and the Santa Fe. Men prominent in
the California oil industry were present;
also a small squad of railroad statisticians
and freight officials, who flanked the rail
road lawyers and helped to get together
technical puzzlers with which to befog
the witnesses in behalf of the producers.
The afternoon was not long enough for
the complainant to get in ail of his new
testimony. It Is probable that all the tes
timony and evidence for both sides will be
In to-day, the hearing Having been ad
journed to 10:30 this forenoon.
Spellacy Testifies.
Timothy Spellacy of the Chicago Crude
Oil Company and the Illinois Oil Com
pany both of which are doing business in
the Kern River district, testified that a
reduction in the rail rates between the
points named in the complaint would
benefit the oil Industry in the fields north
of Tehachapi. He was familiar with
the oil business In Ohio and Indiana. He
was satisfied that the cheaper the price of
oil could be made in San Francisco the
more oil would be used. In his opinion oil
shouldÂ«be sold at the wells at 50 cents per
barrel. He said that he thought that the
transportation lines should be patriotic
enough to help build up the oil business of
the State because that would tend to in
crease the manufacturing industries in
California. No producer of oil could make
a profit at the rates oil has been bringing
recently at the wells. If the roads would
reduce their rates there would be a profit
on oil to the producer at prices upon
which contracts for delivery in San Fran
cisco have been based. He did not wish
the roads to carry oil at a loss. If oil
was to bring $1 per barrel In San Fran
cisco it would take a long time to build
up manufacturing with oil fuel.
Mr. Herrin questioned Mr. Spellacy
about the effect that cheap fuel has upon
manufacturing industries and the witness
told of a time when there was a surplus
of 24,000,000 barrels of oil in storage tanks
in Ohio. Cudahy and the Standard Oil
Company piped the oil and there was a
gre^t increase In the consumption in fac
tories. The surplus was used up and the
price then rose so high that the use of oil
for fuel was discontinued, because coal is
so cheap in that section. Manufactories
were increased by the cheap fuel. He be
lieved there were Eastern manufacturing
companies that would locate in California
if there was cheap oil for fuel, and the
railroad companies could assist. For In
stance, he said, he thought that straw
board paper-making would do well in
California with cheap fuel and an abund
ance of straw such as the State produces.
He had recently been inquiring into the
matter of the establishment in the State
of such a paper plant.
Other Testimony Taken.
W. A. Jacobs, who is a director of sev
eral oil companies in the Kern River dis
trict, testified that doing away with the
switching charge and giving lower freight
rates would benefit the oil industry. He
had always thought that the switching
charge was an injustice to the producers
and also to the railroad.
George L. Hoxie, County Surveyor of
Fresno County, testified that he formerly
was a fireman on the Southern Pacific

ley and ran principally between Tulare

technical, dealing with the hauling ca
pacity of a locomotive. He said that
with an old-time locomotive he had hauled
eighty-six wheat-laden cars in the valley.
In his opinion one ordinary locomotive,
such as is in common use. would easily
haul thirty oil tank cars. When it came
to the cross-examination there was a radi
cal difference In the estimates of weights
of the oil tank cars. Mr. Herrin made the
weight of a car unloaded 32,000 pounds.
but Hoxie quoted a sample oil car on the
Santa Fe which had the weight of 25.800
pounds painted upon it.
Livingstone Jenks, who is officially con
nected with the Four Oil and Apollo Oil
companies; W. H. McKenzie. Robert S.
Knight and Walter C. Beatty all testified
that the reduction of oil rates asked for
would help the oil industry of the State.
Ruediger Objects to Being Boycotted.
The petition of Julius Ruediger for a
writ of prohibition restraining Bakers'
Union No. 24 from boycotting the Vienna
bakery on Larkin street was heard by
Judge Troutt yesterday. Lengthy argu
ments for and against the injunction were
made by the attorneys for Ruediger and
the union, the attorney for the labor or
ganization contending that a boycott
could not be prevented and that the
proper way to secure redress was to sue
for damages. TheÂ«case was submitted.

Places High. Value on Reputation.
Edgar Painter filed a suit for $12,500
damages yesterday against Alexander
Heyneman and Willis F. Cornell. He al
leges in the complaint that Heyneman
and Cornell willfully and with intent to
injure his good name and credit caused
his arrest May 27. 1901, on a charge of
embezzlement. Painter was accused of
selling a printing press on which Cornell
had a mortgage of $250 without giving
due notice to Cornell. He was tried be
fore Judge Cabanlsa and acquitted of the
charge. Painter now claims that the ar
rest and trial damaged his reputation to
the extent of $12,000 and that the time ha
spent in attending the trial caused him
a loss of $500.
