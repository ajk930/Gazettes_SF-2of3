SACRIFICE OF TWO LIVES AND MAIMING OF TWENTY-THREE OF THE PASSENGERS
AND RAILWAY MEN IN COLLISION OF SOUTHERN PACIFIC TRAINS AT UPLANDS
THE Southern Pacific wreck at Uplands early yesterday morning resulted in two deaths and more than a score of serious injuries, which in two cases are expected' to prove fatal. The southbound New Orleans Express, No. io,
and the northbound express, No. p, hadorders to pass at Uplands. Engineer Coffey of the northbound train ran past Uplands at a high rate of speed and his train dashed into th* southbound train as it was slowing down. N. H.

Crowds Witness Transfer
From the Cars to
Ambulances.
THE arrival last evening of the
irorthbound train that had been in
collision in the early morning at
Uplands was eagerly awaited by
hundreds of relatives and friends of
those who were passengers from the
south.
During the day the offices of the South
ern Pacific Company were visited by
crowds, and the information given out
was of a meager character. Beyond fur
nishing a list of the killed and Injured
the railroad officials gave out no news
from the scene of the disaster, and those
who were anxious for Information were
compelled to await the arrival of the
northbound train at 5:30 p. m.
Conflicting statements were made by
Southern Pacific officials as to th'e spot
where the injured would be taken from
the train. One department answered in
quiries by saying that the injured would
be taken off at Twenty-fifth and Valen
cia streets, while other officials asserted
that no stop would be made at that point,
but that the injured would be removed
at Third and Tow,nsend streets.
The Injured were not taken from ! the
train at either of the points mentioned.
The company ordered a number of am
bulances to wait for the train at Six
teenth and Harrison streets and at this
point the removal of the injured was ac
complished. â  'â¢'.'-
A large number of relatives and friends
of those on the train congregated at the
depots at Third and Townsend streets and
at Twenty-fifth and Valencia streets, but
at neither point were the Injured re
moved. The train passed the Valencia-
Street depot at a high rate of speed, 'and

WOUNDED MEN
ARE RESCUED BY
PASSENGERS
Thrilling Experiences of
Survivors Will Not
Be Forgotten
THE stories told by the passengers of
the illrfated trains are thrilling. In
the darkness atffl confusion that pre
vailed men were Impelled by a single
â¢ thoughtâ to save the Iive3 of the un
fortunates, men and women, lra
prlsoned in the debris, and they worked
like heroes to accomplish their purpose.
Amid the hissing of escaping steam, the
groans of the wounded and the shrieks of
frightened women the work of rescue
went on, the whole presenting a scene of
horror that will live. long in the memory
of those who 'were actors therein.
Within a few moments after the crash
thft sleeping passengers realized what had
happened. Those who were not too se
verely injured, at once left their coaches
and proceeded to the front of the trains,
where the engines and cars were piled up
in an inextricable mass of wreckage. The
engines, broken and twisted out of shape,
lay on their sides enveloped in clouds of
steam. The baggage and forward cars of
both trains were telescoped, seemingly
piled mountain high. To add to the horror
of the scene the wreckage cauorht fire, and
the Hrst care of the rescuers was to re
lease such persons as might be buried 'un
der the debris. The flames crept upward,
their fiery tongues becoming; more and
more distinct as they swept through the
inflammable mass. Several people were
rescued in the nick of time, and in order
that the entire trains might not be de
stroyed by fire the cars were uncoupled
by the: passengers and trainmen and
pushed away from the scene of the wreck.
This task accomplished, the wounded pas
sengers . were , cared for and . everything
possible done to alleviate their sufferings.

OFFICIALS
FIX BLAME
ON COFFEY
Declare the Engineer
Was Guilty of
Neglect.
THE blame for the disaster on the
coast line of the Southern Pacific
Railroad system has been 'already
placed by the officials or: Engineer
John W. Coffey of the Ill-fated north
bound train.
N. H. Foster, assistant to the manager
of the Pacific system, made the following
statement at noon yesterday:
"The accident was due to Engineer
Coffey of train No. 9 violating his orders
and not following Instructions. He was
ordered to meet the southbound train at
Uplands and pass it there on the switch.
He did not do bo, but ran beyoncl Uplands
at a high rate of speed. Engineer Konold
obeyed his orders and was slowing up In
order to stop at Uplands when thÂ« north
bound train ran into his engine. I have
received no statement from Coffey as to
why ha disobeyed orders."
When Foster was asked If hÂ© could give
any reason as to why Coffey should make
such a terrible mistake he answered:
"He made the mistake In the same way
that all men make mistakes. That is the
only explanation I can give."
At the office of Superintendent Worth
ingto^ at the Third and Town3end streets
depot It was learned that the Instructions
for the two trains were sent out from the
San Luis Obispo dispatcher's office and
were roost positive that the trains should
meet at Uplands and pass on the double
track at that point.
lously escaped without injury. On his ar
rival in this City last night he said:
"The first knowledge we had o'f the ac
cident was a violent shock. I thought
this was caused by an explosion of dyna
mite and that we were being held up by
robbers. I started to go forward to in
vestigate and found that a lady in front
o* me was pinned down by her chair. 'I
raised her up and rendered as much as
sistance as I could. The scene In the car
was one I will never forget- The women
were screaming and the men were mak
ing a valiant effort to get out. In an
instant the car was filled with steam,
and this added to the scene. My first
thought was to get the Injured out of the
car. I rushed forward and found that

wrecked baggage car s?t fire to the splin
tered woodwork and iu a few minutes
lurid flames were leaping high above the
torn and twisted cars and engines.
The screams of women and children
were heard on all sides and only the work
of passengers and railroad men prevented
a terrible disaster. For but a small frac
tion of time did the accident seem to par
alyze the brains of those who had escaped
injury, then manhood asserted Jtself.
Some men worked with a will to prevent
the spread of the flames to the sleeping
cars of the ill-fated northbound train,
while others assisted the train men to un
couple the cars in the rear and push them
to a safe distance from, the scene of hor
ror.
Willing hands rescued the occupants of
the smoking and chair cars of the
wrecked northbound train and heroic
work was done by several physicians who
were on the train. The accident occurred
half a mile from Uplands, between San
Ardo and San Lucas. One of the train
men walked five miles to San Lucas, the
nearest telegraph station, and word of
the collision was at once sent to this city.
"Wrecking Trains Hurry to Scene.
> B. A. Worthinston, division superin
tendent of the coast tine, at once ordered
u special wrecking tram to leave this city
witnout delay and a number of doctors
were hastily summoned by telephone.
"Worthingxon and his party left San
Krancisco under orders to run through
10 Uplands as speedily as possible, and
they reached the wreck at daylight.
Another wrecking train witn doctors on
board was ordered to proceed from San
.Uuis Obispo to the scene of the disaster,
und the injured were well cared for wheu
me wrecking trains arrived.
Those who were injured on the north
bound train were occupants of the smok
ing and chair cars. - Tnose in the sleepers
escaped with a shaking up. The chair
and smoking ears were immediately be
hind the baggage and express car and in
front of a tourist car. The balance of the
train was made up of five standard Pull
man sleeping cars.
The tirst reports of the wreck sent to
this city were most alarming. It was
slated that between thirty and forty pas
tengers had been killed and that the in
jured numbered more than one hundred.
According to statements made by some
of the passengers on the northbound
train, the excitement following the colli
sion lasted but a short time, but was'
very intense during that period. When
reason resumed its sway the work of
rescue proceeded rapidly.
On No. 9 was a party of Southern Pa
cific officials, and they took charge of af-'
fairs until the wrecking train arrived.
The party consisted of Assistant Man
ager Agler; R. Koehler, manager of the
lines in Oregon; J. R. Laws, superin
tendent of the Carson and Colorado divi
sion; W. S. Palmer, superintendent of the
Sacramento . division, and J. H. Wallace,
engineer of the maintenance of ways de
partment.
The first thought of the officials was
that of rescuing those who were pinned
down by the burning wreckage of the
smoking and chair cars. The crackling
of the flames and the hiss of escaping
Kteam were not loud enough to drown the
cries of the sufferers, and the darkness of
the night added to the weirdness of the
scene.
Passengers "Work Heroically. Â»
Some of the male passengers in the
Pullman sleeping cars had hastily donned
part of their clothing and they worked
with ax and other implements regardless
of their thin attire. There were many
women who also aided to alleviate the
sufferings of the wounded, and portions
of feminine clothing were used as ban
dages to stanch the flow of blood until
the proper appliances could be furnished
by the doctors who were hurrying to the
wreck.
There was a sorry spectacle presented
when daylight broke and a survey could
be taken of the scene of the dfsflster. The
engine and tender of the south-bound
train were lying on their sides in the ditch,
twisted and bent beyond recognition. The
cars of th,is train had been moved back
some distance by the passengers and train
men.
The wrecked locomotive and tender of
the north-bound train lay in a blackened
heap, while the remnants of the smoking.
chair and combination baggage car
burned fiercely. The tourist and Pullman
cars of the north-bound train stood on
the track some distance from the scene
of the collision.
The passengers of the two trains did all
that was possible for those who had been
injured. Sleeping-berths were given up to
the men and women who had been cut,
bruised, maimed and scalded, and stimu
lants were handed over to the doctors
who were attending the injured.
When the wrecking trains arrived from
San Francisco and San Luis Obispo the
work of building a temporary track was
commenced immediately. The relief phy
sicians took care of the injured and re
placed temporary dressings and bandages,
â while the sufferings of many of the In
jured were assuaged by the use of opiates.
Trainmen Instructed Not to Talk.
The hour of the disaster was 1:05 a.
m., and it was not until 11 a. m. that the
temporary track was finished and the
trains were able to proceed on their jour
ney.
The north-bound train was placed in
charge of a new crew of men and the
start was made for this city. Engineer
Coffey was warned by his superiors in the
railroad service that be was not to make
any statement to the newspaper men, and
eimilar warnings were given to the re
mainder of the train hands who were in
the collision.

SCENES IN VICLNTITY
OF DISASTROUS WBECK
Engines and Cars Blockade the Track
Until Bails Are Laid Around
Them.
The train dispatcher at San Luis Obispo
and the agent at Salinas are both of the
opinion that the" engineer of the north
bound train disobeyed orders. It appears
that the northbound express was due to
arrive at San Ardo at 12:50 a. m. and the
express from San Francisco was to pass
at that point. The northbound train was
scheduled to take the siding and wait
until the southbound train had passed.
This siding is at Uplands. Instead of
taking the siding and waiting Engineer
Coffey negligently overran his switch 1000
yards and crashed into the train of En
gineer Konold and the unfortunate fire
man, William C. Garland. Passengers say
that the northbound train was running at
the rate of fifty miles an hour and others
testify that the southbound train was
slowing up as per rule when the collision
occurred.
Three cars were demolished and all that
remains of them is the metal, the wood
having been consumed by fire. Some of
the heavy steel wheels were cut as though
It had been done by some master me
chanic armed with proper tools. The
mass of iron presented the appearance of
a small hill. In one heap fifteen or twenty
feet high and scattered over a radius of
100 feet is what remains of the splendidly
equipped cars. The tender of one of the
engines was thrown twenty-five or thirty
feet from the- track. The baggage car is
beyond recognition. It was thrown off
the track and turned completely over.'
There were enough holes in It to give the
car the appearance of a sieve. It was
in this car that Thurber, the Wells-Fargo
messenger's helper, lost his life and H.
C. Martin, the baggage-man, was in
jured.
When the news of the dreadful wreck
was -made known to the officials of this
city and San Luis Obispo relief trains
containing physicians and wrecking crews
â were dispatched to the scene to aid the
injured and to clear the track. From San
Luis Obispo Drs. Edwards, Abbott, Mur
phy and Parker were dispatched, and
from this city a corps of physicians and
attendants was sent at a rate of speed
that soon brought them to the place ! ot
collision. â¢
The doctors Worked over the injured and
for hours were busy dressing wounds and
relieving the fears of the timid. Those
who were in need of further medical at
tention were placed on board the relief
train and brought to this city. During
the long trip northward every attention
was paid the injured.
The wrecking crews worked with a will
and soon had a, greater portion of the
debris removed. They were forced to stop
in their work until the Coroner of Mon
terey County had an opportunity of gath
ering a jury to inspect the wreck. The
Coroner was delayed somewhat by being
compelled to go to San Lucas and secure
possession of one of the bodies, which had
been taken there without official sanction.
The delay in clearing the track proved
a costly one for the railroad company.
The Sunset Limited and two freight trains
were held at Bradley, a station close to
the scene of the wreck. The track was
completely blockaded, and it wa3 neces
sary to build a spur around the debris in
order to allow the trains to pass. More
than fifty men were pressed into service,
and before night the delayed trains were
able to continue on their way.
It was reported at a late hour last night
that all the mail on train No. 10 was
saved.- but mail on the north-bound train.
No. 9, gathered from points between Los
Angeles and the scene of the disaster,
was destroyed. Fortunately only a small
amount of Los Angeles mail was on the
train. â¢
Considerable money was spilled In the
car occupied by the Wells-Fargo mes
senger. The safe containing the bullion
is still In the wreck and guards are on
watch to prevent it being stolen.
Sheriff Keefe of Monterey County was
a passenger in the chair car of the north
bound train and he was pinned In the
wreckage and escaped death in the flames
by a miracle. Passengers chopped away
the debris and pulled him out while the
car was burning. He was seriously in
jured and was taken to San Lucas for
treatment.
Milton G. Ely, a brakeman on No. 9,
won the approval of his superiors by his
prompt action in notifying them of the
â¢wreck. There was no station within less
than five miles of the wreck and no one
was competent to tao the wire. He walked
and ran the five miles over the track in
record time and sent the first message of
the accident.
Fortunately for the Injured passengers
ther<Â» were three physicians on train No.
9. Dr. Morrison of the Santa Fe was
aboara, as were also Dr. Truax. a well
known Eastern physician, and Dr. Hern
don of Ashland. Or. These medical gen
tlemen did everything in their power to
succor the Injured.
BECEIVE NEWS OF
DISASTER WITH TEARS
Wives of Wounded Trainmen Give
Evidence of Their Great Sorrow
and Anxiety.
Engineer A. Konold of train No. 10 saved
his life by jumping a moment before the
trains collided. He was Injured about the
face and neck, but not seriously. He has
a wife and two children living at 1894 Mis
sion street.
Mrs. Konold was in great mental dis
tress yesterday after the publication of
the meager details of the accident. Dur
ing the day she received a telegram from
her husband announcing that his injuries
were slight, but she could not convince
herself that this was true. Her greatest
fear was tlrat blame for the accident
might attach to her husband, and when
she learned that this was not the case sh*
gave evidence of intensest joy. Konold
was for eleven years an engineer on the
Rio Grande Western, and has been in the
employ of the Southern Pacific for two
years.
Salvadora Euenacorso, one of the
wounded track hands, has a family at 414%
Green stryct. He was married four years
agro and has one child. He left the city
to work on the Southern Pacific road at
Ran Pedro about four months ago: His
wife first learned of the accident when
a reporter called at her residence and
made inquiries concerning her husband.
When she realized that perhaps her hus
band was fatally wounded she became
hysterical. Her shrieks aroused the neigh
borhood and in a few minutes fifty peo
ple were on the scene. Mrs. Buenacorso
would not be comforted until the news ar
rived that her husband's injuries were
slight. â â¢-â¢:-. â¢<Â«
A similar scene was presented at the
home of Felice Rancantore, 724 Filbert

the wife of the wounded man. â  He has
two children, and came to this city from
Chicago about a year ago. He left the
city to work on a section in the southern
part of the State some seven months ago.

TOXTBIST CAR MENACED
BY FLAMES" OF WRECK
Passengers Tell of Experiences When
Awakened by Force of â¢
Collision. <Â£
In the tourist car, No. 200S, of the north
bound train there were many passengers
who had a narrow escape. The car was
next to the chair car, that was wrecked
and burned, and the flames set fire to the
front part of the tourist sleeper.
Lieutenant J. A. Thomas of Company
68 of the Coast Artillery was in this car
with his wife and infant child. None or
the passengers in this car were injured,
but all were badly scared and were m a
nervous condition when they arrived in
this city last evening. 'â 
In speaking of the accident the wife of
Lieutenant Thomas said:
"We were asleep in our berth when the
crash came. My first thought was of my
baby, and my husband took it in his arms.
The noise was terrific, and while we real
ized that our car was safe we saw the
glare of the fire and hurried to dress and
leave the place. The front of our car was
on fire, and the men worked hard to put
out the flames and get the car away from
the scene of the wreck. We had an ex
citing time, and our first visit to Califor
nia will be ever remembered."
W. W. Savage, a traveling man from
Salem, Or., told of his experiences in the
chair car.
"I was asleep in a chair, he said,
"when there was a fearful crash and I
was thrown out of the chair. The train
came to a stop almost immediately after
the collision, and then the roof of our car
-fell in. The heat from the escaping steam
was bad enough, but I was pretty well
frightened when I saw the wreckage
catch fire. I was not injured, and I helped
others to get- out of the burning cars.
Everything was done that it was possible
to do. We moved the cars away from the
burning wreckage and helped the train
men to get the wounded people to a place
of safety. Then men and women did what
they could to assist the three doctors who
were on the train In giving aid to the
wounded. There was little for the pas
sengers to do after that but to wait for
the wrecking trains. It was a fearful ex
perience, and it is a wonder to me that
more people were not killed and injured."

BRAKEMAN AUSTIN KNEW
DANGER LOOMED AHEAD
Attempted to Set Emergency Brakes
When Train Rushed Past Up
lands Siding. ,
Brakeman L. L. Austin, who was on the
northbound train, and who received con
tusions on the head, made the following
statement â¢ last evening upon his arrival
tn this city:
I was in the chair car when the collision oc
curred. We were to stop at Uplands, but
did not do so, and I realized, even In the dark
ness, that we had passed that station.' I jump
ed for the cord and so did the conductor, in
order to throw on the emergency brakes. There
was no air, however, as the- engineer had used
it all in putting on the brakes. I suppose he
saw the headlight of the other train and put
the brakes on. We were going at the rate of
thirty-five miles an hour when we crashed into
the other train. I cannot understand why our
engineer did not stop at Uplands. He has
been on the run for a long time a'nd knows
the road and its rules.
S. Irvine of Banning, a passenger in tho
chair car, was severely scalded by the
escaping steam of the engine when it top
pled over and crashed into the car. His
hands were enveloped in bandages as he
was taken to an ambulance from the
train last evening. In speaking of the
accident Irvine said:
We were running along very fast and ex
pected to get into San Francisco on time. I
was dozing in a chair of the car when the
smash came. The next instant it seemed as if
tho top of the car fell in and I could see the
engine on top of us. The car was filled with
steam from the engine and then the broken
lamps set flre to the shattered woodwork. It
was a terrible sight, and the screams of the
injured and the noise of the steam were simply,
deafening. I managed to work my way out of
the car and it seemed a long time ere I
reached the open air. The flames were close
on to me when I got out of the car. The
work of other passengers certainly saved many
lives, for there were lots of men pinned down
In the wreckage and In danger of being burned
to death. *
PARENTS PRO STRATED
OVER THEIR SON'S DEATH
William C. Garland, the Young Fire
man, Well Known in the Mis-
sion District.
William C. Garland, the young fireman
who lost his life In the wreck, was a resi
dent of this city. He was the son of Wal
ter E. Garland, timekeeper of the Mar
ket-street Railway, who resides at 303
Shotwell street. The young man was a
prominent member, of the Brotherhood of
Engineers and well known throughout the
Mission district. He was 21 years of age
and had spent three years in the employ
of the Southern Pacific Railway Com
pany. Despite his youth, he had won a
high place in the esteem of his superiors,
and about a year ago was appointed to a
position of fireman on the main line.
Garland was born in Santa Rosa, but
had spent the greater part of his life in
this city. He was a graduate of the Mis
sion Grammar School. He was very pop
ular and was noted for his exemplary
habits and strict attention to duty.
The young man's parents are alm'ost
prostrated over the suddenness of his
death. His mother was visiting at Caza
dero when she first learned of the news of
the sad accident, ft Being a considerable
distance from the. station, she was com
pelled to ride horseback in order to catch
the train for this city. Kind friends und
.relatives are doing their utmost tolesssn
her grief. : , v
Walter E. Garland, the young fireman's
father, will leave this morning for Sa
linas to bring the remains of his son to
this city. The funeral will be. held, fi'om
the residence of the parents, 305 Shotwell
street, and will probably be under the:di
rection of the Brotherhood of -Englneer3.
TELLS HOW THE-INJTTRED
WERE TAKEN ' FROM CARS
H. "W. Bishop of Los Angeles De
scribes the Scenes After the
Terrible Collision^
H. W. Bishop of Los Angeles was in
the thick of the smash-up and his escape
from instant death , was a narrow, one.
Bishop was in one of the forward cars
of the north-bound ; train when the colli
sion occurred. He was badly shaken up,
but was able to extricate himself and aid
the injured. He tells a graphic story of
the accident and how the passengers were
saved from being burned alive. He sail
last night: . .
"The first thing we did after the shock
was to turn our attention to saving the
Injured. Knowing the danger of fire, we
hurried the stricken people from, the cars
and ; th,en all worked hard to ; save the re -
rnaining- ; cars from â  being destroyed by
flames. While the forward cars were
burning I entered them . to see if by
chance any one was left there. The smoke
was so dense and the heat so great that
it ..was impossible to discover if any, one
was there. 'I feel certain that every per-
son was removed from the cars before
they were burned. -
"The only people who were killed or
badly injured were in the smoker. They
were mostly Italians and Portuguese.
The people, in the chair car were badly
shaken up, but no one was seriously in
jured.
"The engineer of our train was to
blame. He was negligent In overrunning
his switch. The passengers on both trains
did splendid work. If it was not for them
more lives would have been lost. They
uncoupled the cars and 'pushed them back
and did everything in their power to aid
the Wounded." .' .
SUPPLIES TRAIN CREW
. WITH AXES AND HAMMERS
Pullman Porter Broadnax Breaks
Open Tool Boxes and Helps to
Extricate Passengers.
Porter Broadnax of the Pullman car.
Tunis rendered excellent service . during
the excitement. He did not forget his
duty during the hour of peril. Immedi
ately after the engines collided Broadnax
sprang for tools and distributed them
among passengers able to use them in
freeing the injured. In telling of 'the
wreck he said: . ' â 
'â I stood in the middle of my car Tunis
when thÂ« accident happened. I did not
realize at first what had occurred. The
shock seemed a mild one, 'but when I
heard the rending of timbers I knew that
something awful had happened. I imme
diately rushed to the end of the. car and
threw open the vestibule doors.- Then I
broke open the tool boxes and- supplied
the passengers and crew with axes, saws
and other implements.
"The train caught fire immed'ately. Our
efforts were devoted to savins the re
maining cars and rescuing- the injured.
We all worked hard, and I am happy to
say that many lives were saved. Cars
were uncoupled and pushed out of dan
ger. Accidents will happen, and 1 am
glad it is no worse than it proved to be."
COFFEY DECLINES TO
DISCUSS THE WBECK
â Engineer of North-Bound Train Or
dered Not to Tell of the
Collision.
Engineer Coffey of No. 9, the north
bound train, was the first of those who
were in the wreck to reach the city. He
succeeded in catching a train in advance
of tho one which was delayed by the col
lision. Although he escaped without sus
taining any injury, he was almost in a
state of collapse. He hurried at once to
his home at 2920 Sixteenth street to assure
his wife by his presence that he' had not
been injured.
When asked how the wreck occurred
he refused to answer on the ground that
he had been instructed not to say any
thing for publication. He persisted in his
refusal to talt and declined even to give
an account- <W the passengers who ware
injured. â

Monterey County. I started to help him
and he said, 'For God's sake help me.
This stuff is pressing the life out of me.'
I then yelled to the porter to bring an ax
and we cut away the woodwork and took
him out. We all helped to pull women
and men out of the car.
"As a physician I was kept very busy.
I gave as much comfort as I could to -the
injured. The sights I witnessed .were in
deed pitiable. 1 saw four charred bodies
pulled out of the wreck. In my opinion
and in the opinion of others there was no
reason - why the accident should
have occurred. It is true that it was
night, but the trains were traveling on
a broad plain and the engineers should
have seen the " danger. It was .criminal
negligence on the part of some one. I
have lost my baggage, but I ought to be
thankful of escaping without injury.

BRAK2EEAN ELY'S STORY
OF THE CATAS'TEOPHE
Employe Walks Fire Miles to Wire
/ News of Accident to Rail
way Company.
Milton G. Ely, a brakeman on the
northbound train. In charge of Conductor
Williams, .was at the rear end of the
train at the time of the collision. He tells
the following story of the occurrence:
"It was just 1:05 o'clock when the acci
dent occurred. We had received orders
at-. San Ardo to meet No. 10 at Uplands.
We were a train's length west of tha
west switch at that place when No. 10
hove in sight. I was unaware that there
was anything wrong until I was thrown
fuil length upon the, floor cf the car. We
crashed on ahead for several feet and the
train then came to a halt.
"My. first impression was that we had
broken in tr/o. i I rushed out and on
going on ahead found -that we were in a
nead-cn collision. The passengers and
crew began the work of assisting the
wounded, and I was sent to San Ardo to
wire the general office of the affair. It
was a five-mile walk, and the best I
could do was to cover the distance in one
hour and a quarter.
"The accident, as far as loss of life Is
concerned, was not as serious as it
might have been. There were two men
killed and eight badly injured. Many of
the passengers were slightly bruised, but
if any were seriously injured I am not
aware of tho fact. I know nothing as to
dlsobedieneo of orders, and I cannot say
who is responsible for the accident."
SCENE OF PANDEMONIUM
AI10NG THE PASSENGER 3
J. W. Erwin Describes His Experi
ences and What He Saw of
the Wreck.
Among 1 those who were the wreck
were J. W. Erwin, assistant superintend
ent af the free delivery system. United
States mail, John G. Fraxer and Charles
B. Hurbut, mall clerks. Frazer lives in
Oakland and Hurbut at Elmhurst. All
three men escaped without injury. Mr.
Erwin said last evening:
I was In the sleeping ear with my head to
the engine when there came a bang that threw
me out of my berth. I never dressed as qutck
lj* before In my life, as I didn't know what
might happen next. â ' i
In order tg reach the head of the train I bad
to go through two tourist cars, a chair car.
a smoking ear and a combination baggage and
express car. The smoking car was telescoped
into the chair car ani a greater scene of con
fuston I never saw. Women and children were
screaming and strong men were j ylamllnsr
around net knowing which way to move. I had
a spasm of self-consciousness and Anally with
the help of others got the children out on the
track.
Then I continued my way forward and the
sight was a terrible one. Our locomotive,
which had been going north, was headed
south, while the engine- of No. 10, which had
been headed south, was in the ditch keeping
tho mail car company. What with the crack
ling of the burning cars, the cries of the
women and children,' the frantic cries of the
men for assistance and the hiss of escaping
steam there was- a scene that approaches nearer
to pandemontum than ever Dore depicted.
Many people were scalded by bursting steam
pipes. Many werp hurt In the smoker and a
few were injured in their mad rush for safety.
MAY FIX MINIMUM WAGE
OF CITY'S LABORERS
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday in which he advises that the
Board of Supervisors, under the power
granted it to fix the compensation of all
laborers in the service of the city, may
fix a minimum wage of $2 50 a' day of
eight hours, notwithstanding the power
given to the Board of Works and Park
Commission to fix the compensation of
their employes.
The opinion affects laborers on any
public utility that may hereafter be ac
quired by the city, and tho proposed ordi
nance fixing the rate of wages at $2 50 per
diem for all city laborers will, in all like
lihood, be' parsed by the Supervisors.
Why win not all men insist upon having it, when it is so easy to get and to
keep. Some men are eaten alive by tape-worms, others wander hopelessly for
years dying slow deaths from bowel disease.

teen of them were caught in the flames,
two of them escaping with slight in
jury. The other four were the regular
men employed as top fillers, and escaped
without injury.
The expiosion was caused by the gas
becoming incased in a crust of cinder
forming at the bottom of the furnace. A
wheelbarrow containing ore had been
sent up to the men, and when they went
tq dump it into the bell of the furnace
they pushed it over too far and it rolled
into the hopper. The - barrow weighed
MO pounds, and was too heavy for the
men to raise. The fifteen laborers, all
Hungarians, were then, sent up to assist
them. Had it not been for the barrow
accident no one would have been hurt,
as the regular men knew how to pro
tect themselves at such times, as simi
lar explosions are of frequent occurrence.
Eye-witnesses say that there was a
loud report, and the murky heavens were
illuminated with a great sheet of flame,
showing the men on top of the furnace
running about, gesticulating wildly. The
flames and hot metal looked like a vol
cano in action. Five of the men were
blown off the top of the furnace, and
these are the ones that are still living.
The others hung on the railing (some on
the outside, others on the inside), until
their clothing was burned off. 'Two of
the victims remained tenaciously cling
ing to the railing until their fingers were
burned off. They then fell to the . ro<jf
of the mill dead. Seven of the victims
were found dead on the platform of the
cupola. These were completely denuded
of clothes by the flames, and their bodies
were burned almost to a crisp. Two of
the dead were found in the stockyard of
the plant, 250 yards from the furnace.
Every bone in their bodies seemed to
have been broken.
Distressing Feature of Disaster.
The most distressing feature of the dis
aster was the burning of Frankowiez. Ho
was seen by hundreds of people who were
on their way to work to return to the
platform railing and leap into the air.
He fell on the stockyard shed and was
literally burned to death before the eyes
of the crowd fifty feet below, who had no
way to reach him.
When the explosion occurred burning
heaps of cinders settled around the men
almost knee deep. Their shrieks were
terrible and their frantic efforts to save
themselves were pitiful in the extreme.
Over two tons of ore, coke and hot cin
ders, some pieces weighing almost three
pounds, rained down on Second avenue,
and many pedestrians ran into houses
and stores for protection.
A car was passing just at the time the
gas let go. The coke and other material
falling on the car, - which- had twenty-five
passengers aboard, caused a panic and
many jumped off. None of the passen
gers were in the least injured, but all
were badly scared.
When the explosion occurred the men In
the plant became panic-stricken and
rushed to the streets. Only a few re
ported back for .duty at 9 o'clock. The
men thought the entire plant was doomed.
The people residing about the furnace
and for blocks on either side were badly
scared. They rushed from their homes
and a few minutes after the report had
sounded throughout Soho thousands
of people gathered about the furnace.
Women whose husbands were employed
In the plant, mothers whose sons worked
there and sisters whose brothers were in
the plant formed part of the crowd. With
tears In their eyes they waited with bated
breath to learn who were victims of the
catastrophe. Some were fated to hear
sad news, for among the crowd were
wives or relatives of some of the dead.
When they learned of the deaths of their
loved ones they burst Into tears and some
of them are on the verge of mental col
lapse.

GERMANY'S NAVAL DEMONSTRATION IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE AMERICA IN GRAVE COMPLICATIONS
United States Is Gathering in the Caribbean Sea One of the Most
Powerful Squadrons That Ever Sailed Under Old Glory.
s^r ALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 19.â Grave complications, which mav^
M involve the United States." will, it < is feared by administration officials, result from the naval demonstration
B . Germany contemplates making in Venezuelan waters. While there is no' intention on the part of this
Government to interfere with Germany's purpose to: collect" the claims held. by her subjects against Ven
ezuela, apprehension exists that President Castro will declare war. and it is to be prepared for complica
tions that may ensue that the United States is gathering in the Caribbean Sea one of the most formidable squad
rons that ever.sailed under the flag. 1 i; . â¢ . . , , ,
Secretary Long added another battleship to-day to Rear Admiral Higginson's command. The battleship
Illinois, which is now at Algiers, La.',- where she is to take part in the test of. the new floating drydock there, will
shortly leave for Pensacola, and will then steam south to a rendezvous to be appointed by Rear Admiral Hijrerin
son. It was generally understood that the Illinois would not be attached to the North Atlantic. squadron during
this winter, but would be on detached service, and in March. next receive Rear , Admiral Crowninshield. when
she would proceed tcf the European station., Naval officers deny that there is any special reason which prompted
the change of plans with respect to the Illinois. Her. addition to the North Atlantic squadron will result, however,
in the presence in the Caribbean Sea during the winter of five of the strongest vessels of the United States
navyâ the battleships Kearsarge. Alabama, Illinois, Indiana and Massachusetts.
The announcement of the purpose of the Navy Department to assign the Illinois to the North Atlantic
squadron followed a call made this morning upon Secretary Hay by Baron Von Holleben, German Embassodar.
It is asserted that there is no connection between the German Embassador's call and the decision regarding the
Illinois. Baron Von Holleben undoubtedly discussed with Secretary Hay Germany's plan of operations in Venezu
elan waters. . â¢
It is the belief of officials that if the naval demonstration be not sufficient the port of La Guayra will be
occupied and customs duties collected upon all goods imported through that port. The State Department has
been informed by Minister Bowen that officials in Caracas are deeply excited over Germany's purpose and
President Castro does not propose to pay the claims. Should he declare war, this will give Germany -an oppor
tunity to land marines and even an .army corps, but it is not believed she will go that far. Whatever operations
may be necessary, however, the authorities say emphatically, that Germany must not take permanent occupation of
Venezuelan territory, otherwise the United States will interfere. â . - - # . â  \
It is believed in administration circles that the presence of such a formidable American fleet in close prox
imity to Venezuela will exercise a restraining effect upon Germany and prevent her from even attempting to ex
tendher sovereignty over any port of Venezuela.- â¢
GENERAL CHAFFEE TELLS OF THE DUPLICITY
AND TREACHERY OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â "History af
fords" no parallel of a whole people thus
practically turning war traitors, and in
the genius of no other people was ever
found such masterful powers of secrecy
and dissimulation; but it is needless to
say that no powerful state -was ever
erected or ever can be erected on such
immoral and unenlightened foundations."
This statement is made by General
Chaffee, military governor of the Philip
pines, in a review of one of a number of
court-martial cases in the islands, the rec
ords of which have been reviewed at the
War Department. fj
The case which brought forth this com
ment from General Chaffee was one
wherein seven natives were tried jointly
on a charge of murder. The accused were
soldiers in the insurgent army, and after
defeat by the American army in the field
abandoned even the show of open opposi
tion, such as the half-uniformed guerrilla
bands make, and took up their residence
at Taytay, in Luzon, a place protected
by an American garison. Then, following
the proclaimed policy of the Insurgenl
chiefs, they proceeded to organize secret
ly a bolo band. When authorization had
been given to establish civil government
the band came forward under the leader
ship of a resident padre and were elected
municipal officers of Taytay. Then en
sued a remarkable attempt to serve two
masters. In all lawful matters they served
with due appearance of loyalty to the
American Government, while at the same
time they labored secretly and diligently
in the interests of the. insurrection. This
dual form of government, says General
Cbaffee, existed everywhere, in strongly
garrisoned cities like Manila as well as
the smallest barrio. The municipal officers
of Taytay next entered upon a series of
murders, and continued their deadly work
until the growing unmber of mysterious
dlsappearnces led to the discovery of the
perpetrators by the American authorities.
Ignorance Is Made "Use Of.
"One undeniable truth," says General
Chaffee, "stands out in this case as in
hundreds of like cases of murderâ that the
average native of these islands has not
more than the merest rudimentary con
ception of his individual rights and duties
as a man. and no one knows this so well
as the wily chiefs, who use him for their
nefarious purposes."
Six of the seven natives were sentenced
to be hanged, but General Chaffee com
muted the sentence of three of them to
imprisonment at hard labor for life.
The seventh native, Leonordo de Posoy,

LIPTON VISITS
KING EDWARD
Unfolds His Plans for
Another Race for the
America's Cup.
LONDON, Dec. 19.-Slr Thomas Lipton.
In a^long Interview which he had with
King* Edward yesterday, during which the
America's cup races were minutely dis
cussed, unfolded his plans for the future.
His Majesty exhibited the keenest interest
and at times offered suggestions. He ex
pressed the opinion that it would be. hard
to geta boat to beat the Americans, to
â¢which Sir Thomas replied that he was at
least confident that he could secure a
yacht a good deal better than the Sham
rock II. When Sir Thomas had finished
explaining his reasons for this belief tho
King appeared to be satisfied and heartily
wished him success, ; â './
Sir- Thomas Upton also conveyed to
King Edward a recapitulation of Presi
dent Roosevelt's friendly comments on the
King, and on England, which formed .the
gist of a conversation between Sir Thomaa
and Roosevelt while" the former was in
the United States.; The King: was evi
dently much pleased. In , turn he told
Sir Thomas how greatly he admired Presi
dent Roosevelt's personality," which, un
fortunately, he knew only by hearsay. .
The King takes great interest in the
preparations for building another chal
lenger, which are believed to be already
on foot.
Captain Sycamore, in an Interview, said
he would shortly hold a consultation with
Sir Thomas LiDton and he had great
hopes that a Shamrock III would result
therefrom.
It Is learned that - King Edward has
taken particular Interest in W, ; G.
Jameson's alleged shortcomings during
the cup races. It is noticeable in this
connection that his Majesty { has not seen
Jameson since the latter's return to Eng
land, and It is said by those who are in a
position to know tnat he Is not likely to
do so In the future.
Haley N"ot;Now in Reno.
RENO, Nev., ' Dec. 19.â A search of the
marriage license records here has devel
oped the fact that the names of Clarence
C. Haley of San Francisco and Miss Leo

them in keeping peace. But when the
elections to American , civil government
offices were held he put forward and
caused to be elected as presidente one
Caledonio Javier, whom General Cnaff ee
describes as an "illiterate and bigoted
man," whom De Posoy well knew was an
officer of insurgents and whom he com
mended to the people as the best man for
the office, because he was "bold."
At his trial De Posoy, who was held to
be the chief agent in the Taytay mur
ders, took advantage of the loophola
which appeared to be afforded by the po
sition as priest by contending that while
the participators in the wholesale mur
ders in Taytay would- confess the same
at confessional he was compelled by his
sacred office to keep silence.
General Chaffee pronounced this defense
of no value, saying that "confessional
does not lay upon any man, priest or lay
man the obligation of suppressing knowl
edge of crimes being committed by third
parties, the consummation of which could
have been prevented without violating
the secrecy of the confessional."
In this particular case, it is said, the
knowledge of the crimes was brought di
rectly to the priest's notice and -was not
gained through the confessional. General
Chaffee confirmed the sentence of death
imposed by the court-martial which tried
De Posoy, but commuted the sentence to
twenty years' imprisonment at hard la
bor "out of his respect' for his calling
and "of the great religious organization of
which he Is a most unworthy member."
Said General Chaffee in concluding /his
review: - . â  . â - ... : -.
"No person living in these islands. can
be permitted to plead "his office, however
sacred or exalted, : as a protection for
crimes committed." . -\. "
Held in Service Until Arrival.
The Secretary of War to-<Jay notified
General Chaffee, commanding the divi
sion of the Philippines, that short â  term
soldiers in his command hereafter will be
held in service until their arrival at San
Francisco, where they will be discharged
as rapidly as their accounts can be made
out. These soldiers will be detained in
camp at Angel Island until their dis
charge papers are issued. This actiaon is
due to the fact that the discharge of the
men on the transports on their way home
leads to confusion and interferes with a
proper enforcement oC the res^mtions re
lating to discharge.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec, 19.â General
Arthur MacArthur, U. S. A., who ar
rived here to-day to attend the Commer
cial Club banquet, when asked concern
ing the project to devastate Samar.'in the
Philippines, as a retributive measure for
the massacre of American soldiers, in
volving the concentration of the natives,
said: .
"I doubt the expediency of the concen
tration. It Is a Spanish method ani poi
haps one that we, should not imitate. It
is an enormous expense and may bring
doubtful results. The British are having
some experience with that sort of war
fare in South Africa."
General MacArthur laughed at the sug
gestion that there might be an uprising
in, the city of Manila.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL MILES LAYS
HIMSELF LIABLE TO REPRIMAND
Commanding Officer of the Army May Be Called
Upon to Explain His Recent Criticism of Navy
Department Concerning Schley Controversy
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET.
N. W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.
âGeneral Miles has again attract
ed unusual attention to hte utter
ances by the interview on the
Schley case. The lieutenant general of
the army has in this instance laid him
self liable to reprimand by criticizing an
other branch of the service. He has ac
cused the Navy Department of being in a
conspiracy to rob Schley of his honors,
and it is perfectly justifiable for the Sec
retary of the Navy to call the attention
of the Secretary of War to this accusa
tion made by the head of the army. In
fact, army and navy officers fail to see
how Secretary Long can ignore such an
accusation made against his department.
It is his duty to protect that department
from criticism by another department of
the Government, and he cannot ignore
this coming from Miles. Secretary Root
cannot fail to call the attention of Miles
to his reported interview and ask if it 13
correct. If Miles acknowledges the in
terview, there is nothing left for Root
but to reprimand the head of the army
for unjust and censorious criticism of the
Navy Department.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â Attorney The
all, acting for Stay ton, counsel for Rear
Admiral W. T. Sampson, called at the
Navy Department to-day to see Judge
Advocate General Lemly. Theail stated
that the objections to the findings of Ad
miral Dewey will not be filed with Sec
retary Long until to-morrow morning. In
brief, the statement will object 'to Ad
miral Dewey's findings that Admiral
Schley was in absolute command at the
battle of Santiago July 3, on the ground
that the testimony touching this point
was not admitted during the sessions of
the court of inauiry.
The bill of exceptions filed by counsel
for Admiral Schley with Secretary Long
yesterday and the accompanying letter of
Raynor have been referred to Judge Ad
vocate General Lemly, who is engaged in
the preparation of a reply.
A Call correspondent visited Rear Ad
miral Sampson's residence to-day and the
statement was made to him that the ad-
mlral's condition remains unchanged. It
was emphatically denied that his illness
is such as to give rise to any feeling 1 of
immediate alarm. He is not confined to
his bed, but moves around the house at
will Last evening he occupied his accus
tomed place at the family dinner table.

ALASKA NEEDS
BETTER LAWS
Governor Brady Speaks
of Conditions in the
Special Disnatch to The Call
' TAC0MA, Dec. 19.â Governor John i G.
Brady vigorously advocates representa
tion of Aiaska in Congress, revision of
the land laws of the district, and is
strongly opposed to the : Territorial form
of government at the present time. In
an interview at Sitka he says:
"Territorial governnjent is not what we
want now. Give Alaska the same ' land
laws as are now operative in Oregon or
Washington and then we can talk of mak
ing the district self-governing. As things
are now a clear title? to land In Alaska,
except under the old soldier clause. Is im
possible.
"As the \ land laws stand now only
blocks of eighty acres can be acquired,
and in this cage the Government with
holds each alternate eighty acres. Under a
provision of that kind it is Impossible to
expect any large population. Give Ua
proper land laws and 1 will guarantee a
population â  of over a million* Scandina
vians alone in three years, and those, are
the people we wantâ peaceful, law-abiding
and . industrious. There are Finlanders,
too, oppressed as they are by Russia â
young men being forced into the army.
These Finlanders would take every op
portunity to steal away - to a country so
like their own in climate.
"Alaska's importance as a strategic
point has been unappreciated. I believe
that Unalaska will some day be a base of
supplies for a fleet of vesels that will pro
tect this gateway to American territory."
When asked if the â¢consummation of his
views would not call for change in the
capital the Governor replied:
â¢ "Yes, some time the capital undoubtedly
will have to be changed to Valdes or some
other more central place than Sitka. It"
would be unwise to change it until time
had shown the most desirable location. It
would be a needless waste of monev to
change It now to some eastern point *(Ju
neau), erect; the necessary buildings and
furnish them, when the natural trend is
westward. The present location of the
capital is satisfactory to the district in
its present condition." . .

INVOLVES MINES
Some Interesting* De

in PhelpsCase.
Special Dispatch to The Call. â¢
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 19.-The action
of Josephine A. Phelps, executrix of the
last will and testament of T. G Phelps
deceased/against W. I. Wadletgh, came
up for trial here to-day i before ' Judge
Buck. The suit is upon a, promissory note
for $7000, but the answer puts in issue the
title to valuable properties of the estate
including the Liberty Hill mines in this
State. â¢ '
The plaintiffs evidence consisted mere
ly of the production of the note and the
testimony of Mrs. Phelps that nothing
had been paid thereon. The defendant
then commenced taking testimony which
he claims will prove that Phelps was not,
nor is his estate, the owner of the prop
erty in dispute, although it stands in the
deceased Is name, his contention being that
?Â»% / eds Blven by Wadlelgh were in
tended as mortgages.
Wadlelgh testified that he flrst became
acquainted with Phelps in 1886. In 1889
he borrowed $5000 and gave his. note for
the amount. In 1S90 this note was taken
up and a new one given for $6830. Thi3
in turn was surrendered In 1894 and the
note sued upon given.' He further stated
that to secure the payment of , the' first
note he made a deed of certain proper
ties, and from time to time increased the
security^ by giving further deeds : until
Phelps had property of his situated in
8 ? n Nevada County and in
the State of Washington*, all given as cdl;
lateral security. He produced a document
purported to be signed by Phelps in which
the latter acknowledged that he held the
property In trust for. Wadlelgh. â â¢
The defendant then testified that after
the making of the deed to the San Fran
cisco property, Phelps sold a portion of
it for $2500, $2000 of which he credited upon
the Â«iote of 1890, sending the remaining
$p00 to him. : This -testimony was offered
for the purpose of ; showing -that the de
ceased acknowledged that he held' the

GARDNER RULES
A BIG FAVORITE
Is Picked by. Bettors to
Again Lower Carter's
Colors.
Both Boxers in Condition to
Go the Route, in a
_>-.; Fast Fight.
The absence of Carter money yesterday
made George Gardner a still stronger fa
vorite over the "Kid" in their, fight to
night at the Mechanics' Pavilion than>(ie
was when betting opened on Wednesday.
This will be the third meeting of the rival
middle-weight'- boxers, and the prestige of
Gardner's brace of victories has forced'
1 him into 10 to 7^ favoritism. ; v
There can be no question as to the condi
tion of the men, both having gone through
a severe course of preparatory work with
out developing . a weak spot. Neither
Gardner's hand nor, his ankle has given
him a moment's worry. His friends, who
have watched him since his first appear
ance in this- city last July, are astonished
at the improvement in his style, both as
an offensive and a defensive, fighter.
In the four years he has been boxing he
has defeated many good men, and if he
wins from Carter to-night there will be
no one to question his right to the middle
weight championship he now holds. '
: Carter's friends accept the line they ob
tained on him in his fight with Walcott on
which to base their hopes of .a victory to
night. The "Kid" showed he had grown
stronger and cleverer than he was when he
met Gardner. It is claimed he has con
tinued .on the upgrade, -but whether his
Improvement has been greater than that
of his opponent will not be shown until
they have gone part way on their ring
journey to-night. s
The preliminaries make the card the
best of the year. With Jockey Winnie
O'Connor and John Crowell, Billy Snail
ham and Tommy Gilfeather and Toby Ir
win and Arthur Granfleld in the going
there should be sufficient action to satisfy
the most exacting ring patron.
As this is the busy season of the year in
the retail stores the principal bout will be
held off as late as possible. With the pre
liminaries'scheduled to go tWenty-four
rounds it will be nearly 11 o'clock before
the big fellows enter the ring with Referee
"Jim" McDonald. .
NEILL DEFEATS TRACY.
San Franciscan Wins .In the Eight*
'. * . . eenth Bound at Portland.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 19.â Al Neill of
San Francisco and Tom Tracy of Austra
lia to-night met in the ring for. the third

his right and cut a gash an inch in length,
from which the blood flowed in a stream.
During the iirst five rounds Neill jabbed
Tracy' on the right eye with his left and
all but closed that member. After the
fifth round Tracy did some effective work,
and during the next eight rounds landed
hard with his right on Neill's stomach.
The fighting was fast and Tracy proved
to be a good in-flghter, but Neill kept up
his jabbing on the face. In the seven
teenth Neill commenced to. uppercut
Tracy, and at the end of the round Tracy
appeared tired. In the eighteenth Tracy
landed on Neill's head and Neill came
back, with an uppercut. After a clinch
Neill ianded with his right â¢ on â¢- Tracy's
jftw and he went down. Tracy was unable
to respond to the call ortime and Referee
Joe Acton gave the fight to Neill.

George Dixon Again Loses.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Dec. 19.â Austin
Rice of New London and George Dixon of
New York met to-night for twenty rounds
at 122 pounds. Rice was given the deci
sion. During the early rounds Dixon led
often for Rice's head, but had little suc
cess in landing. Up to the tenth, round
Dixon was sluggish, but in the tenth he
commenced to show some of his old-time
footwork. The twentieth round was the
hardest of all, first one man having the
advantage and then the ; other. Several
times Rice landed good blows, but lack of
force prevented a knockout. Both men
were lighting strongly when the gong
sounded. '

"HANDRIDING" KELLY ON BILLY LYONS
CREATES A SENSATION AT OAKLAND
Captures the Opening Event From Gold Baron Backed From 150 to 30 to 1,
Phil Archibald Finishes in Front of Mazo, Favorite for the Hurdle Han
dicapâImpromptu Is Left and Jim Hale Defeats Edna Brown Driving
HANDRIDING" KELLY made the
most successful and sensational
parachute descent of the season
yesterday at Oakland track.
When ready in the opening
dash he cut away with Billy Lyons, a 150
to 1 shot, and landed a head in front of
Tommy Burns astride Gold Baron, a men
dicant in the betting. There were thirteen
starters In the race, which was decided
over a mile, and the chance of picking
the winner looked about as bright as to
fall from the dome of the Glaus Spreckels
building and alight on an old-fashioned
lightning proof feather bed. It must not
be construed though . that* Billy Lyons,
even if neglected by the popular boniface j
after whom he is named, lacked attention.
At post time SO was the 1 best obtainable,
with the" bulk of the coin going into the
books on Colonel Ballantyne, the luke
warm favorite, Limelight, Fondo,: John
Welch and Elmer L. The first choice
grounded on a sandbar in the home chan
nel and as " stated before "Handriding"
Kelly mpved along irpm ninth position
and beat Oold Baron out in 1:42^. â 
.The division which usually strings ita
coin with the tavorites was treated to
several hard knocks, for besides Colonel
Ballantyne, Esterneii, Mazo and Jarret
ierre were detained on the way home. The
card drew the usual large crowd.
Walter Jennings' Dareoin lilly Jacque
minot beat Esterneii, favorite for the two
year-old scramble, easily at the wire. The
winner was 5 to 1 in the ring and ap
parently always held the footing over tne
iirst choice. Catheilo, "ridden by Kddie
Jones, finished in the show.
Andy Biakeley's jumper, Mazo, was
touted as the good .thing for the mile and
a quarter hurdle event, his price being
pounded down from 5 to 2 to 8 to 5 favorit
ism. For a time Lloyd had the flrst choice
out in front, but Phil Archibald headed
him on the back stretch and at the close
it was no contest. Archibald scoring by
six lengths. The winner ran coupled in
the betting with Rainier.
Six clever two-year-olds started in the
six and a half furlong selling affair. On
past form Jarretierre d'Or was installed
favorite. Tne latter ran under a- dozen
wraps to the stretch, but when Buchanan
let him down he flattened out like a
punctured tire and ran unplaced. In a
rattling finish JOhnny Woods on Commis
sioner Forster earned the decision from
The Giver by a head. With better luck
Milas could have won.
Report had it that Impromptu was not
ready, and Jim Hale went to the post a
2 to 1 favorite for the seven furlong sell
ing run. Impromptu was left , through
the swerving of Jlarlneuse, and in a drive
Hale beat Edna Brown a neck.
There looked to be nothing to the last
event if LÂ»r. Bernays was fit, and from
three his odds were backed to 11 to 5.
The doctor received a nice ride at the
hands of J. Woods, winning easily from
Cougar and Grand Sachem.
Track Notes.
After a successful season on the Aus
trian tracKs Charley Gray is back at his
home in Oakland. Gray once rode the
horses raced by Tully Coulter.
Frank Weir, owner of Merops, claimed
Bab from the last race on "Wednesday.
The mare was entered to be sold for $300,
so at $625 Frank probably secured a bar
gain; * . ". '
The ride of Armstrong on Favorito was
not satisfactory to the judges, and after
the race the rider was indefinitely sus
pended. ' - â 
To Amy Burns on Edna Brown put up a
superb ride, but the mare was a trifle
outclassed by Jim Hale. Â« >)
Sir Lewis might have been a factor in
the fourth event had LaTry Daly not been
cut off while trying to get through on the
rail turning into the stretch.
President Williams gave the steeple
chase riders. a short lecture before the
hurdle event. He explained to them that
in the past jobbery had ruined this popu
lar branch of the sport out here, for
which reason the California Jockey Club
had eliminated steeplechases from its
programme. | Continuing, the president
admonished the boys to try to elevate the
sport, and that if they did the Oakland
association would willingly give three in
stead of two hurdle events a week.

LADY DEFEATS
SHASTA "TIGER"
Gamblers, Like So Many
Othellos, Are Out
of Jobs.
REDDING, Dec. 19.â The efforts of a
woman have closed the gambling houses
in Redding, The "tiger" has retired to
its lair. Redding had been running wide
open, but the resorts have now resumed
their old-time dullness and except for a
social shaking- of dice or the whirr of a
slot machine there is nothing to be heard
In the;way of a sound Indicating that big
chances are belne taken.
The lady in the case is Mrs. Henry
Clineschmidt, wife of one of the City
Trustees. She had the keepers of a saloon
arrested and then she circulated a petition
addressed to District Attorney Dozier
seeking an enforcement of the State anti
gambling law. The tide of public opinion
changed and the woman's effort met with
success. An active prosecution of the case
was soon taken up. Manipulators of
ivories, pasteboards and wheels believed
they saw an inception of the crusade
against them and 1 like so many ' Othellos
bemoaning the loss of an occupation they
have packed their paraphernalia and de
parted from Redding. The lady has been
successful over the "tiger."

Prevents Many People From Trying
; a Good Medicine. ;L' V ,'
Stomach troubles are so common and la
most cases so obstinate to cure that people
are apt to look with suspicion on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and Indigestion^
Many 'such pride themselves â¢ on thei?^
acuteness In. never being humbugged
especially In medicines.
This fear of being humbugged caji be
carried too far, so far, in fact, that many-
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money In faithfully testing the dalm3
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets arÂ»
vastly different In one Important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines, for
the reason that they are not a secret pat-
ent medicine. No secret is made of their
ingredients, although they are sold by alt
druggists under protection of trade, mark
but analysis .shows them to contain the
natural, digestive ferments, pure aseptic
pepsin, the digestive acids. .Golden Seal,
bismuth, hydraatls and - nux. They are
not cathartic, neither do they "act power-
fully on any organ, but they cure indiges-
tion on the common sense plan of digest-
ing: the food eaten thoroughly before it
has time to ferment, sour and cause the
mischief. This is the only secret of their
Success.
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure Indigestion and- stomach troubles, be-
cause they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble is really in the
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken aftiur
meals digest the food. That is all there Jf
to it. Food not digested or half-digestea
is poison, as It creates gas, acidity, head-
aches, palpitation of the heart. I033 of
flesh and many other troubles which are
often called by some other name. . ,.*Â»â,

years ago to-day, on De
j I cember 20, 1881, Bernard Katschln
jl ski, proprietor of the Philadelphia
XL shoe house, first opened his store
and laid before the people a very
tumble display of boots and shoes. The
store was a wooden frame building eight
een feet wide and forty feet deep. The
merchant had just come from Sacramen
to, where, as a barber, he had accumu
lated a capital after eight years of hard
work amounting in all to 52300.
He saw at once that energy was the
quality required to build up a trade, and
vith one assistant, Fred Meadows, he
turned up his sleeves and turned in to
his way to the top of the commer

with a handsome store and a staff of
ninety employes, among them the faithful
Fred Meadows, who from a three-dollar
a-week shop boy has grown up In corre
sponding importance with the owner.
With pride the shoe merchant looks
back to the early days, and glowing are
the reminiscences he relates, but, above
all, his desire is to impress upon the
growing* youth his own boyhood expe
riences -and the truth that his great suc
cess and sound standing in the commu
nity are due to strict attention to duty,
honorable dealing with his fellow citizens
and, principally, his one rule never to
misrepresent an article to a customer, but
at ail 'times and under all circumstances
to give value for the money received.
That has been with him, he says, a re
ligion.
In order to commemorate the anniver
sary in a manner that will make his cus
tomers participants the merchant will
present to each one of his callers to-dav,
customer or otherwise, a picture of the
late lamented President, William McKin
ley.

THE SAiN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1901.
BATTLE STARTS
IN COURTROOM
Witness and Lawyer
Enliven Proceedings
at Alturas.
Modoc Lynching Case. Gives
Promise of Some Sen
â  sations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Dec. 19.â The impassioned
remarks of lawyers, the frequent flaring
up of hot-tempered witnesses and a good
sized crowd of attentive and picturesque
auditors made this day interesting In the
Brown case, or as it is more popularly
called, the Modoc lynching case. " ,
The "morning session of the court was
pretty much devoid of incident, but the
afternoon developed enough of sensation
to satisfy even the most exacting of
metropolites. It was a session brimful
of excitement and the wonder is that it
did not end in serious encounters.
Witness Courtwright was again put on
the stand for. cross-examination by the
defense. Â«fHe stated that he never said
anything about a halter, ropes or splicing
ropes, '"and the record of my testimony
to that effect taken by the reporter is in
error," he declared.
Tight in Courtroom.
Attorney Raker then stated that the rec
ord showed the witness had testified false
ly. The witness rushed -from the stand
and struck at Raker, who in turn struck
Courtwright on the head with a rod. The
Sheriff separated the combatants and the
court threatened the witness and Raker
with punishment if the offense was re
peated.
Raker moved to strike. out all the testi
mony of the â witness ori the eround that
the court refused the defense the right
to cross-examine. The witness then tes
tified that John A. Brown and Charles
Auble and some other lawyer were fol
lowing him around and listening to what
he said since he had been in Alturas.
' The Court ordered the witness off the
stand during the recross-examination and
a half-breed child, Agnes Wilson, was the
next witness. She testified that she knew
Hall and Brown. She was present at the
arrest of Hall and stated that the defend
ant swore at Hall and punched him in the
back with a rifle.
Ernest Bonner, District Attorney of
Modoc County, said to-night :
"Relative to an article which appeared
In one of the dailies of San Francisco on
the date of December 17, I never accused
Foreman Kistler of the Grand Jury of
bulldozing his fellow-jurors into bringing
indictments against any one. I did oppose
further indictments by the Grand Jury
until such time as the cases now on trial
should be determined. I did this believing
such to be a proper and a business-like
course to adopt, it being estimated that
the trial of three cases now under indict
ment will leave a deficit of about $20,000
in the county treasury.
District Attorney's Statement.
"I never wrote any article or suggested
any article for any paper of this county
or outside denouncing the prosecution of
these cases and the editors of county pa
pers will substantiate my statement. The
only articles I ever wrote or suggrested
are Alturas notes for the Adin Argus and
Cedarville Record and scattering locals
for local papers, none of which locals or
articles have in any way been connected
with the Lookout cases.
"I never denounced the Attorney Gen
eral's office except for one thing, publica
tion of my private confidential communi
cations last October. I have never refused
any assistance requested or ' desired or
asked in the prosecution of these cases.
D. P. Brown of the Grand Jury never to
my knowledge accused me of being an
attorney for the defense, though he did
state that he did not consider I was taking
the lead in the prosecution of the cases.
I am perfectly willing that the Attorney
General's office should be given full power
to make a .thorough and exhaustive trial
of the case of James W. Brown and to
that end have been and now am willing
and ready to give every assistance in my
power toward a full and fair trial of said
case. I have not considered District At
torney Boyd of Lassen County of any
particular consideration one way or an
other at anv time."

BUILDINGS ARE LOST
IN BAKERSFIELD FIRE
Fifteen Thousand Dollars' Worth, of
Property Destroyed by the
Flames.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 19.â A fire which
for a time threatened the office buildings
in the southern section of the city broke
out to-night in the Union Lumber Com
pany's office at Chester and Railroad
avenues. The blaze is thought to have
been caused by crossed electric light
wires, but many persons are of the opin
ion that the fire was of incendiary origin.
The damage is estimated at $15,000, par
tially insured.
A lire of unknown origin destroyed Mil
ton McWhorter's refinery just east of the
Southern Pacific round house in Kern
City to-night. Two outside stills and some
lumber were saved, but the principal por
tion of the plant, including one still, much
asphalt and many barrels of oil was de
stroyed. The refinery was erected last
spring and as it supplied this city Â» with
distillate as fuel for oil-burning stoves,
the loss of the' refinery will be felt by
others than the owners. The loss cannot
be accurately estimated to-night.
Court Orders His Acquittal.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19.â A. Paladini,\ a
wholesale fish merchant of San Francisco,
was to-day acquitted in the Superior
Court of violating the fish laws of the
State by selling a quantity of salmon in
this city. Last September Paladini ship
ped the fish to Paul Haagen of this city
and a few days later he was arrested by
Game Warden Foster. The fish was sold
in San Francisco and Paladlni's attorney
contended that the trial should be. had
there. There was a variance between the
indictment and proof of venue and Judge
J ..origan ordered the jury to return, a ver
dict of acquittal. He held that trial, if
had at all. should have been in San Fran
cisco County.

CHICAGO FACES
A COAL FAMINE
There Is Not More Than
Thirty Hours* Supply
in the City.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19.â Chicago is facing a
coal famine, and 15 degrees below zero
within twenty-four hours is predicted by
the Weather Bureau. Throughout the en
tire city big .consumers of ' hard and soft
-coal are begging shippers to supply. them,
but without- avail. The severe weather
and the floods; throughout the coal min
ing districts have tied up railroads to
such ; an extent that shipment is almost
Impossible. To add to the. serious short
age railroad companies are exerting
their prerogative of confiscating car lota
of coal as fast as .they : arrive here, and
are putting them to their own use. Large
business houses are suffering severely for
the want of coal and many concerns are
hampered by reason of insufficient steam
power. To-day many owners of large
buildings were besieging coal dealers and
begging that they be supplied with enough
coal to tide over the zero weather. ' At
midnight, a â¢ number of ' coal dealers who
had. been canvassing the situation in the
city reported that; there was not [ more
than thirty hours' coal supply in the city.
If relief does not come by that time there
will; be much suffering and many manu
facturing plants will be forced to close.
The prediction of the Weather Bureau
Is for a new record hvlow temperature
for Chicago in the month of December.
At midnight the mercury showed five
degrees above zero and was falling

A CHANGE FOR CAPITAL.
PERSONS who are looking for permanent and
profitable investments of large amounts of cap-
A ital will do well to give careful consideration to
the problem of providing an abundant water supply
for San Francisco. It is not likely that such a sup
ply can be obtained anywhere nearer than the moun
tains. The construction of the necessary works will
therefore require much time and a large expenditure
of money, but in the end it will with good manage
ment prove one of the best investments now offered
to American capital.
The increasing population of San Francisco has
already taxed the resources of ' the Spring Valley
Water Company to such an extent that the company
has had to resort to the" use of Point Lobos Creek as
a source of supply. That source has now been closed
to the company by the demonstration that the water
is unfit for household use. The increase of popula
tion, with the augmented demand for water, will
eventually outrun the possibility of an adequate
supply from the present resources of the company.
Recourse to the mountains or to some other distant
source of supply will therefore have to be made, "or
within a comparatively few years the need of a better
water supply will be felt acutely by all classes of
At the present time the East has something like a
superabundance of capital. It is seeking investment
in every direction, not only at home but abroad.
Much of it has come to California, as is illustrated in
the purchase of the Southern Pacific Railroad and of
the Market-street railway, and of course much, more
has come in smaller investments that have not at
tracted pub^c attention. Such being the case it is
not unreasonable to expect that Eastern capital may
be forthcoming to undertake the great enterprise of
providing a mountain water supply for the city, and
it is certainly worth while for all associations engaged
in working for the general good to assist in attract
ing the attention of capitalists to the subject.
The issue should rot be ignored merely because
the need of more water is not acutely felt just at this
time. Intelligent men look to the future and pre
pare for coming needs that are clearly foreseen. It
is only the foolish who live from day to day with no
thought of the morrow. That we feel no urgent need
of an increased water supply just at this particular
juncture may be conceded, but what will be the situa
tion when the increase of population in the city and
its suburbs on both sides the bay will require more
than double the present supply?
There was never a better opportunity for obtain
ing capital for a great water supply enterprise than
that which is now afforded by the accumulation \ of
unemployed capital m the East. Money is so abun
dant there that any kind of legitimate enterprise on
a large scale can readily obtain backers; in fact,
many enterprises of a purely* speculative nature are
eagerly grasped by investors. Considerable sums of
American money are even being sent out of the coun
try, to Europe and elsewhere, in search of invest
ments, not one of which is so promising and so sure
as that of providing an elaborate and comprehensive
system of bringing water in large quantities from the
mountains to the crowded populations around San
Francisco Bay. ,
The issue should be taken up by Boards of Trades,
Chambers of Commerce and similar associations in*
all the cities around the bay. It is not .an issue
peculiar to San Francisco. It concerns the whole
suburban region as well as the cky itself. Moreover,
. it is an issue whose importance will increase' with the
years, and whose impending urgency ought not to be
overlooked in any consideration of the needs of the
community.
The sort of duties that harass a Mayor of Boston
may be inferred from the recent announcement of
Mayor-elect Collins that when he enters office he will
attend no balls or parties he would not have attended
had he remained in private life, and that his dancing
days are over. It would seem the Bostonian s expect
their Mayor to be more sociable than is good for him.
WATERS AND FORESTS.
UPON assembling to-day the members of the
California Water and Forest Association can
congratulate one another upon the increasing
public and popular interest in the work they have un
dertaken. The campaign of education on the subject
of the need for a comprehensive system of conserving
our forests. has had widespread effects, and. what was
regarded a few years ago as an academic question has
now become one of practical politics. - --
The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Agriculture have each referred to the subject so far as
it is affected by the work of his department and have
emphasized its importance. The President himself
has devoted a considerable portion of his message, to
Congress in urging the importance of forest preser
vation, beginning by reminding Congress that
"public opinion throughout the United States" has
moved steadily forward to a just appreciation of the
value of forests," and closing by saying: "The for
ests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams
in flood and replenishing them. in drought they make
possible the use of waters otherwise wasted. They
prevent the soil from washing and so protect the
storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest
conservation is therefore an essential condition to
water conservation."
These utterances from the President and the heads
of departments at Washington, taken in connection
with the widespread demand for the adoption of a
national policy of forest protection on the public
lands, give reason for expecting from Congress some
thing in the way of definite action at this session.
The leadership of the National Government will of
course have its effect upon California, and conse
quently the members of the State association havea
fair prospect of seeing in the near future good re
sults from the work they have been doing with so
much zeal and energy.
The need of forest protection is now fairly well un
derstood by intelligent people throughout the Union.
I Here and there a voice of objection is heard, but the
objector has either seme self-interest to serve in the
waste of the forests or else he is one who "does his
own thinking" and never agrees with what any one
else says. Virtually that part of the campaign of edu
cation is over. Now comes the more perplexing
part â that of determining how the work of preser
vation can be best. carried on.
It is a foregone conclusion that under our system
of government forest preservation, like everything
else, must be dependent partly upon individuals,
partly upon local and State governments, and partly
upon the nation. There is reason to believe the
National Government will be willing to give consid
erable aid and support to State" governments that
enter earnestly and scientifically upon the task of pre
serving existing woods or of reforesting areas that
have been stripped bare of trees and are unfit for ag
riculture. The States, however, must take the initia
tive in dealing with their own problem's. I The Califor
nia Forestry Association is therefore doing a most
important service to the public in working out the
right solution for the many problems that will be in
volved in the conservation of woods and waters in a
commonwealth so varied as this. The meetings of
the association have always attracted a great deal of
; public interest, -and this meeting is likely to prove the
most attractive and important that has yet been held.
There has been developed by the combined efforts
of lawyers and doctors in the East a - new disease
called. "trolleymariia," which is said to be very effec
tive in getting damages, from trolley-car companies.
It is asserted the disease is caused by the cars, and
the Boston Herald says: "When explained by an ex
pert lawyer working for a contingent fee in a suit for
personal damages against a rich trolley corporation
this new affliction is something truly agonizing to an
impressionable jury."
A SUBFLUVIAL BRIDGE.
A MIGHTY bridge, constructed under instead
of over the waters of a deep and wide river,
is to be one of the first of the engineering
marvels Of the new century. The under-water bridge
is not to be a mere tunnel such as was constructed
years ago under the Thames by the genius of Brunei,
but it is to be a veritable bridge, a structure resting
not upon a foundation of earth, but upon piers,
just as any other bridge that is not supported by
cables.
This new feat in engineering is to be carried out by
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for the purpose
of obtaining entrance into New York City. In ad
dition to the interest inherent in such a novel and
stupendous enterprise there is for San Francisco a
special interest from the fact that the problem to be
solved in crossing the North River from New Jersey
to New York City is not dissimilar to that which
would have to be solved in devising railway com
munication between San Francisco and Oakland.
The working out of the scheme in New York may
therefore lead to the undertaking of a similar enter
prise here.
It was at first the intention of the Pennsylvania
Company to construct a huge suspension bridge
over the river. It was found, however, that the
bridge would have to be elevated so high in order to
avoid interference with shipping that the approaches
to it. from either side would have to be very long to
provide suitable grades for trains. Careful calcula
tions showed that such a bridge, with its approaches,
including the cost of land, could not be constructed
for less than $50,000,000, and might cost $75,000,000.
That sum was believed to be too large an investment
for the desired purpose, and the suspension bridge
scheme was dropped. A* project for constructing a
tunnel .under the river was considered and investi
gated, but that in turn was abandoned because at the
point where the crossing is needed ,the river runs
over a mass of oozy mud upward of 100 feet deep and
incapable of sustaining a tunnel for heavy traffic. .
-A few, years ago engineers could not have over
come the. difficulties thus presented. It would have
been a case of suspension bridge, tunnel or nothing.
The engineers of to-day, however, have another re
source. Recent developments of electrical power r and
improved methods of tunnel construction, have "en
abled them to venture upon the building of the'so-.^
called "subfluvial bridge," whose estimated cost is
but one-fifth of what the suspension bridge is esti
mated to cost. .
A recent account of the scheme says: "The plan is
to run huge tubes through the clay some fifty feet
under the bottom of the water and' to support them
at intervals upon piers which shall rest upon bed
rock far below. In effect, this will be constructing,'
not tunnels, but tubular bridges, which will run
through the earth under the river instead_of through -
the air above it. This will obviate the difficulty,
which seems to be insuperable, of constructing; arid
sustaining tunnels in the thick bed of silt that;has ac
cumulated for ages in the bottom of the riverbetween.
the water and the clay. Bo.ring through the clay will

be no difficult task, and going; down to the rock for
the support of piers to bear up the ponderous tubes
is deemed altogether practicable. Herein is the solu
tion of the problem of bridging the Hudson below
the bottom instead of above the surface."
It will be perceived that the successful construction
and operation of an under-water way of such propor
tions would almost certainly lead to the construction
of similar ways in other parts of the country where
there are broad waters to be crossed and where the
crossing is- not feasible by suspension bridge or the
old tunnel system. We may therefore watch the New
York venture with interest. Crossing by ferry-boat
may eventually become more a matter of choice than
QUEER DOINGS. IN BOSTON.
BOSTON aspires to be calm and cool. Her
culture tends to the suppression of the emo
tions as the chief end of education. A Bos
tonian is proud that "he can make love without feel
ing the slightest flutter of his pulse, and meet an
enemy with no desire to hit him. It has been believed
by the mass of the American people that this pe
culiarity of Boston culture is the 'result of, the exces
sive eating of clams; that the Boston blood has, in
fact, become clammy; and that Bostonian aspirations
are no more than the inevitable effect of a diet defi
cient in blood foods. That opinion, however, is
erroneous. Boston seeks repose not because she is
naturally calm, but because her innate tendencies
and instincts are toward the other thing. Her cul
ture is designed to be a restraint upon her too ardent
heart. She imitates the clam in her education be
cause in her natural impulses she tends to cavort like
the wild monkeys of Borneo. .
A proof of the over-excitability of the average
Bostonian is furnished by events now occurring.
We learn from the press of the city that there re
cently arrivedin Boston several Chicago evangelists,
including "the converted cowboy". and "the banker
pastor." Of the latter it is said: "He will do a half
million dollars of business in a day and preach to a
large audience at night, and have a long altar crowd
ed with seekers to God for mercy in an old-fashioned
manner." The other evangelists were not far be
hind the banker pastor in preaching even if they did
not do the big. business in dollars. Altogether .it
seems to have been a glittering constellation of scin
tillating specialists that turned loose their wild Chi
cago appeals to the ardent hearts of Boston, and the
results were disastrous to culture.
A Boston paper in describing the scene at one of
the revival meetings says: "Never before last night
has Park-street pulpit been desecrated on a Sabbath
by the sight of two men dancing together, while three
or four men capered about them, on the very plat
form itself, howling, jumping, clapping their hands
in a manner that would have turned even dancing
dervishes green with envy." Another paper of the
city, describing a "prayer-meeting" of the revivalists,
says: "Mr. Harvey danced about the platform hold
ing, above his head a table and shouting at the top
of his lungs. Women were praying and weeping, and
the revivalists were shouting defiance to what they
termed their enemies and the enemies of the Lord."
That is the sort of thing that happens in Boston
when you knock the culture off and appeal to the
native instinct. Boston, in fact, represses herself; too
much. If she would let nature cut her caper in a nat
ural way at all seasons of the year she would not
get, so excited when a Chicago man comes to town.
When Chicago oratory is heard in San Francisco we
deem if rather mild, but in Boston it gives rise to
hysterics. That is the difference between people
who live naturally and those who live in the Bos
tonian manner, and it is to be hoped Boston will
try to get closer to San Francisco and Nature's
heart.
The pleasure of these sunny days" in California is
marred a little bit by reading about the fearful snow
storms in the East and learning what fools some

TOBACCO FOR THE BOYS.
CONGRESSMAN OTEY of Virginia has in
troduced into the House of Representatives
a bill providing ' that the Government
shall issue to the enlisted men of the army and
the. navy a weekly ration of tobacco. Despite the
evident intention of the statesman to make a little
demand for the products of. his district, the bill has
received commendation, wherever it has been noted
at all. It merits all that has been said for it. The
boys, of the army and the navy should have their to
bacco, and. it will not cost the Government much
to give it. to them.
Despite the abuse that is sometimes made of to
bacco, its value to men who have to undergo duties
like those of soldiers and. sailors has been 'too fully
proven by experience to be successfully denied. To
the tired man, or to the hungry man, it brings com
fort and solace. It enables men to bear with patience
the lack of food, the roughness of life on the sea and
in the camp, and the thousand hardships of a sol
dier's and of a sailor's life.
It is the cheapest of all luxuries. It gives more
of enjoyment for its cost than any other thing known
to man. It is- a sort of medicine that ministers to the
mind as well as to. the body. Daniel; Webster has
narrated that once in the. days of his poverty being
in Boston with but three cents in his pocket he gave
one cent for a pipe r.ivd two cents for tobacco, and
puffed, his troubles away in smoke. The great ex
pounder was as wise in that act as ever he was in
In all seriousness tobacco serves so well to tide men
over many of the irritations and troubles that fret the
mind that it is indisputably; a valuable- comforter.
Most of the enlisted men in the army and the navy
use it. A weekly ration of tobacco would therefore
be a most welcome addition to that which the Gov
ernment now gives. The men ought to , have the
weed and they ought to have it of a good quality.
That some people will object goes without saying;
but those who do will not be of the class that fights
Uncle Sam's battles for him on land or sea, and con
sequently their kicking shouldn't count. Congress
man Otey,' in seeking, to benefit his constituents,
seeks also to benefit the defenders of the flag. It is a
pity. his bill could not be given so much of a rush
that it would get .through in time to let the ration
come to the boys as?a New Year's gift.
Those who said Congress" would notdo anybusi
ness before the holidays were not so well posted as
they thought, for- from the very day of organization
it has been attending strictly to' business and has ac
complished, a* good deal of. prime' importance.

shopper that gets the pick of the Christmas novel

ELEVEN DIFFERENT TEACHERS FOR ONE CLASS
IN JOHN SWETT SCHOOL WITHIN A FEW MONTHS
Investigation Brings Out Startling Facts Regarding the Number of Precep
tors EmployedâPupils Give. Testimony Favorable to Knowlton.
The Knowlton Investigation was contin
ued yesterday morning by the Board of
School Directors and some exceedingly in
teresting, if not sensational, disclosures
were made. The morning session was
confined almost entirely to the testimony
of school children. Knowlton went on the
Ftand later in the day and told his side of
the story. r,?
From the testimony ftf Knowlton's pu
pils the children of the A Eighth grade of
the John Swett Grammar School had so
many teachers they didn't know what to
Â«lo. Eleven of them within a few months
they counted off-some good, some bad,
some indifferent. These children had a
pood word to say for Knowlton and one
of th^rn even went so far as to circulate
a. petition for his restoration.
The three pupils who testified are Miss
Lillian "White. Miss May Cummings and
John Wright, all bright, quick-witted chil
dren. Miss White told how the class was
la a state cf uncertainty most of the time
on account of the rapid change of teach
ers. Miss S. Hobe. who taught the class
at one lime, told the children that it was
a lisprace to the school. One day when
Miss Hobe left the room May Fitzhenry,
a pupil, arose and read aloud an account

of the charges brought against Professor
Knowltop. "I don't think the class was
to blame: we had so many teachers," said
Miss White. Miss Hobe knew that a pe
tition was being circulated for the resto
ration of Knowlton, but she told the chil
dren It wouldn't do any good.
May Cummings was the star witness of
the day. As her testimony went along she
grew more and more pugnacious and told
the School Board some pretty plain facts.
To her mind Knowlton was by far the
best teacher of that merry chain of peda
gogues that had to deal with the A Eighth
grade of the John Swett School. Miss
Cumrnings said Miss Hobe was : a most
unsympathetic teacher and that she her
self got up the petition at the instigation
of her father.
Casserly Becomes Wrathful.
Attorney McPike went into detail in re
gard to special teachers and provoked the
wrath of Director Jack Casserly. McPike
said to the witness:
"How many tramp teachers did you
have?"
"Tramp teachers!" said Casserly, full of
indignation. "We know of no tramp
teachers, fiir."
"Well, Itinerant teachers, then," replied
McPike.
"Ah, that's very much better," said Cas
serly. and the investigation continued.
John Wright was the last school wit
ness. His testimony was cumulative, but
he added that Knowlton would tell stor
ies connected with their lessons. Johnny
thought Knowlton was the "properest"
teacher in the world. Out in the big meet
ing-room were. waiting several groups of
children ready to testify in the fame
spirit, but the board dispensed with their
calling.
W. J. Martin, an old scholar of Knowl
ton. and Alfred Roncovieri were put on
the stand to voice a few good words for
their teacher of many years ago. McPike
had Judge Slops, Albert Scott. Assessor
Dodge and John French on his list, but
the board was satisfied to take it as a
fact that Knowlton was good In the far
away past.
Kno-wlton in His Own Behalf.
Knowlton was put on the stand at the
afternoon session and testined as to the
time when he was reassigned to the vice
principalship of the John Swett School.
He Balri that he did not notice any dete
rioration in the order of his scholars after
he had assumed charge. Principal Lyser

MANY STEAMSHIPS ARE KEPT BUSY
BY TRADE OF SOUTHERN COUNTRIES
South American Liner Tucapel Arrives via All Central American and Mexican
| Portsâ Russian Barkentine Bering Flies All Her Bunting in Honor of
St. Nicholas Dayâ Weil-Known Tailor Seriously Injured on the Sonoma
RUSSIAN BARKENTINE BERING DECKED IN HONOR OF ST. NICHOLAS. SHE CAME FROM SIBERIA LAST
WEEK AND HER CAPTAIN, AS SOON AS HE MADE PORT, VOWED HE WOULD FLY THE FLAGS IN
HONOR OF THE CZAR AND THE DAY. .
AMERICAN steamship3
/[^ are coming and going those days.
(I * "What with the 4 Kosmos l'ners and
the steamships of the Companla
Sud Americano de Vapores, the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company, the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company and,
last but not least, the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, the competition is sharp
and keen. Rarely does a day pass that
a steamship does not arrive from South
and Central American ports, and the con
test between' the rival companies grows
daily.
Yesterday the Compania Sud Americana
de Vapores' Tucapel arrived from South
American ports, while the Pacific Mail
Company's Peru sailed for the Orient. The
vessels saluted each Other as they passed
in the bay, but the Peru seemed to have
,the best of it, as she was loaded down
with cargo, while the Tucapel was light.
SAN BLAS' PASSENGERS SAFE.
Captain Cattarinich and^ Charges on
Way to Panama.
A dispatch received yesterday from Co-
Ion, Colombia, says the San Bias, which
ran ashore qn the coast of Salvador, was
wrecked at the same spot where the Pa
cific Mall steamer Nicaragua was lost De
cember 30, 1S91. A" German steamer be
longing to the Cosmos line was afterward
wrecked at the same point. ,
Among the San Bias' passengers were
forty-four Chinamen bound for the isth
mus. Captain Cattarinich and the ship's
passengers, who were all' saved, have not
yet reached Panama.
'Nearly all of the crew of the wrecked
steamship will return to San Francisco on
the Mail Company's Newport.
PASSENGER TRAFFIC.
Arrivals and Departures on Tucapel
and Peru.
The cabin passengers who went away
in the Peru were:
For Honolulu â Miss A. D. Alexander. Mrs.

On the Tucapel many boxes of oranges
were seized by Quartermaster Officer
Crow. They were all infected with the
Mexican maggot.
St. Nicholas Is Honored.
The barkentine Bering was gayly
decked with flags yesterday. She flies the
Russian ensign, and in honor of St. Nich
olas day the captain dressed his ship. If
looked odd among the mass of shipping
to see one solitary vessel with a'l her
flags flying, but when it came to -â¢ be
known that not only was St. Nicholas the
patron saint of Russia but that Nicholas
was also the Czar and "the best beloved
monarch that ever ruled over all the Rus
slas the secret was easy to explain.
The Bering brought a very valuable car
go of furs from Siberia, and after dis
charging will Bail again for Vladivostok.

COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL
SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Shipment of $495,103 to China.
Domestic and Sterling Exchange and Silver all higher.
Wheat and Barley quiet at about previous prices. :
Oats strong, Rye steady and Corn dull.
Flaxsccd weak under free arrivals from the north.
Dried Peas lower and dull. Beans inactive and unchanged.
No further advance in Butter or Eggs. Cheese plentiful.
Dried Fruits firm at unchanged quotations^
Hides quoted quieter and easier.
Beef, Mutton and Pork very firm.
Oranges and Lemons in liberal supply. Limes higher.
Poultry and Game continue steady.
Potatoes reported frozen along the river. Onions weak.
Local stocks and bonds still dull.
Money and the Crops.
'A well-known New York authority says of
the money markets and crops:
"An important feature which Is not eatis
factory is the occasional declines in exports,
uhich we have repeatedly referred to. The
decline in exprits of manufactures is especially
regrettable, and seems likely to continue; for
Europe is not in a condition to buy anything
with freedom except food products which short
crops abroad compel her to purchase. Inter
national trade relations are anything but sat
isfactory at the moment, the constant threats
of tariff wars and retaliation being simply an
expression of economic stress. This is the
cark side of the picture contrasted with our
own extraordinary prosperity, which still con
tinues with wonderful momentum, but which
has been too rapidly discounted In the stock
market.
"The monetary situation at the moment Is
unfavorable, high rates seeming probable until
after preparations for January disbursements,
which will be exceedingly heavy. Babk re
serves are at a very low ebb and some sharp
contraction of loans will be necessary to main
tain the surplus above legal requirements. Gold
exports at this time are unusual and of course
exert an unfavorable effect, being additional
proof of the changes going on in our interna
tional trade and financial relations. As large
6ums have been withdrawn for underwriting
purposes the only relief that can come to the
New York market Is through forced liquida
tion and the return of funds from the interior,
*-here" money has been relatively cheaper and
more abundant than here.
"The effect of the corn crop damage will
eoon be more visibly felt in various ways. Al
ready there has been an important decrease in
corn receipts at Western primary markets, and
the exports of corn during the eleven months
of the current year have been only 99,600,000
bushels against 167,900.000 bushels the same
time last year â a decrease of not far from 50
per cent. Short crops of corn and cotton are
not elements of prosperity, no matter how
much compensation growers may receive in
better prices, nor how much the loss may be
counteracted by- business activity in other di
rections. True prosperity is based on abund
ance, not scarcity.
"The reaction may not be pleasant, but it
will be beneficial. Readjustment is necessary
to chanced conditions. The United States is
still enjoying great prosperity, particularly in
certain sections; but the progressive movement
is less uniform than six or twelve months ago,
the crest of the wave has been reached in eova-2
quarters and recessions are due if we are to
have a healthy stock market and active and
fcubstantial mercantile markets. There are
Signs that the market leaders appreciate these
facts, and that the downward tendency Is be
ing assisted by manipulation. When the mar
ket has been tested, the weak epots discovered
end new blood and new capital admitted, we
jnay expect a recovery. But the upward turn
Is not yet in sight and stocks are likely to be
0. good eale on all sharp rallies."
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall reports from New York say:
"Raisins are much higher on the coast. The
â¢High Five.* or California seeding combine,
finally named new prices yesterday, which are
%c per lb higher on seeded, l%c higher, on 2
crown ar.<3 3-crown loose Muscatels, and %c
tilgher on 4-crown loose than the former asso
ciation prices, which were withdrawn suddenly
b week or so ago. The new prices on seeded,
<3%c for choice and 7c for fancy, f. o. b.. coast,
have been generally predicted, but the ad
vance on 2-crown and 3-crown loose Is about
Jic per lb more than expected.
"The full list of new quotations is as follows,
fob. California: Two-crown loose. 4%c; 3
crown, '5V*c; 4-crown, 5%c; seeded, bulk,
choice, 6%c; fancy. 6%c; 1-lb cartons, choice,
<< 1 5ic; fancy. 7c; 12-oz packages, choice, 5%c;
fancy 6%c: Sultanas 6c: seedless Muscatel.
5c; Thompson's seedless. 6%c; 2-crown London
layer. $1 25; 3-crown London layer. $1 35. All
prices are subject to confirmation, but advices
to some local representatives of packers state
that no sales of 4-crown loose will be confirmed
until arbitration with the association is set
tled. Orders for choice seeded are limited to
20 per cent of the entire quantity ordered.
"The coast situation is believed to be very
Ftrong and most of the advices from the pack
ers EtRted that a further advance is likely to
occur very shortly. On spot holders stiffened
their views decidedly, although the advance
had been largely discounted during the past
week. There was very little doing, however,
and the market is hard to quote. Loose raisins
are largely In the hands of seeders who are not
disposed to sell. Most holders asked Cc for
3-crown loose, but some poods were available
about iic less, while some held at the coast
price freight, etc.. addpd. Seeded were nom
inally quotable from 7%@7%c for choice and
eround 8c for fancy. London layers are very
scarce on the 6pot. The new coast prices for
layers are identical with the old quotations.
Some outside packers named the same prices
as th<Â» combine.
"Prunee are firm and unchanged from 3%c to
ft 3%c basis, coast, for Santa Claras. Ore
rons are less freely offered, few being quoted
ur.der a fcaris of 2%c. coast. Currants are firm
and nv*>tin>? vrith steady demand in a small

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. i9. â Amalgamated Copper
almost broke Stock Exchange records for the
erratic character of Its fluctuations to-day. So
great was the uncertainty over the action to
be taken by the directors on the dividend and
the consequent effect on the general market
that dallngs in others stocks than Amalgamated
Copper were practically suspended. The stock
broke several times during the morning, going
down immediately after the opening to 03%,
which wiped out the sudden gain at the close
yesterday. From that point it began an Ir
regular recovery, with frequent halts and re
actions. A story got afloat that the full 1%
per cent dividend was to .be declared, to be
paid in scrip for such proportion as was rep
resented by the dividends of subsidiary com
panies which have been tied up by injunction.
The outstanding short interest became fright
ened at this rumor and bought to cover. The
stock touched 69% before the directors had as
sembled at the dividend meeting. It was only
a few minutes after the hour of assembling
when the price slumped to 64% under a torrent
of offers. The rebound was to 67%, and the
stock then tended to equilibrium and closed
with a net loss of %. The action on the divi
dend had not been announced when the mar
ket closed. The -further cut â  in price of raw
copper was not unexpected and there are pre
dictions that the level has not yet been reached
to attract large buying orders. The announce
ment of the cut did not interrupt the upward
course of Amalgamated Copper which was then
in progress. The undertone of the general
market was firm, but there were sharp de
clines in several leading stocks when the cut
in copper was announced an.l also wnen Amal
gamated Copper commenced its wild movement
in Che last half hour. Vory few stocks at
tained a movement of as much as a point in
either direction from last night's close. The
tone of the coalers was good, and there wvd
some talk of a coming advance in the pricÂ»
of anthracite. There was no appaient uneasi
ness in. the money situation, and the opin
ion is general that the outward movement of
gold for the year has come to an end. The
market closed irregular and very dall-
Railroad bonds were dull and stsady. Total
sales, par value, $2,145,000.
United States 3s coupon and the f.s coupon
advanced ',4 and the old 4s coupon declined \'&

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19.â Wheat ranged over %c,'
with several ups and downs, and though there
was a slight early . firmness -based on exceed
ingly small 'receipts and scanty offerings, the
dullness made traders timorous. 1 AH hands
seemed indisposed to trade and even the boars
refused to press matters. Early - cables were
weak, but not as far depressed as I had j been
expected. Cash business was small. . The rail
road tleups curtailed receipts, but reporu had
it that the cold weather was not hurting win
ter crops. The early small . demand gav* way
to some buying and the session | was b-ii-eft | of
any speculative Interest. May opened a shade
lower to a shade higher at 79% to 79%c, touch-
Ins 79%c. sagged oft to 79%Â®79ilc, and closed
steady, a shade lower at 79%c. â¢ Â« â â -,â 
Corn had much the same experience as wheat,
though it was stubborn against a, bearish
movement. Short receipts here and news from
Kansas that the cold weather necessitated feed
ing corn to stock regardless . of price . buoyec.
opening prices. Profit -taking soon, caused a
setback and the market became . very dull.

otherwise the foreign markets showed little

winter â¢wheat having ample moisture and pro
tected by snow in most sections. The condition
of the Kansas crop, however, is attracting at
tention. The plant has no snow covering, the
temperature is 10 degrees below zero and the

HOUSE TO CONSIDER BILL.
Ccnal Measure to Come Up on the
Seventh of January. '
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â Before the
House adjourned to-day over the holiday
recess a special order was made for the
consideration of the Nicaragua canal bill,
beginning on Tuesday, January 7. and to
continue until the bill is disposed of, the
order not, however, to interfere with rev
enue or appropriation bills. The session
of the House was brief, the major portion
of the time being occupied by De Armond
of Missouri in making a personal expla
nation regarding reports circulated in his
district concerning his course in the mat
ter of the extension of the rural free mail
delivery.
De Armond explained that reports were
circulated in his district that he had
caused action on free delivery routes to
he held up during his absence in the Phil
ippines. These reports, he said, were cir
culated by those who lied and knew they
lied. He read letters addressed by him
to the First Assistant Postmaster General
last April, none of which, he said, had
elicited a reply. He also had read a letter
received by him after his return from the
Orient, but dated July 3, saying a certain
rural free delivery route would be estab
lished, and another dated July 6 saying
the action spoken of in the letter of- July
3 had been "held up" to await the final
action of the Postmaster General.
De Armond said he wondered whether
the Postmaster General, who had just an
nounced his purpose of leaving the Cabi
net, was going because he was wearied by
the great labor of solving the question. In
conclusion De Artnond declared that the
department had not treated him "frank
ly, fairly or in a manly way." it had not
answered the pertinent question regarding
the division of carriers between the par
ties. He charged that the conduct of the
department was in the Interest of certain
Republican bosses in Missouri, one of
whom hoped to get into the United States
Senate.
Hepburn asked unanimous consent that
the Nicaragua^ bill be made a special or
der for Tuesday, January 7. and to con
tinue as a special order until disposed of,
not, however, to interfere with revenue
or appropriation bills.
Cannon asked whether the passage of
the bill would embarrass the executive in
securing the right of way through Nica
ragua or Costa. Rica.
Hepburn said he knew of no negotia
tions that would be Interfered with by
this legislation. On the contrary, he said,
legislation must precede acquisition, the
bill itself providing means for the acquire
ment of the right of way.
Richardson, the minority leader, said
this was in no sense a political question,
and there was no objection to the propo
sition on his side of the House.
Cannon said he was in favor of the
building of the canal, but he thought
there should be a. place to put the canal
before it was 'authorized. As this was a
request for consideration, however, ho
would not object, and the order for con
sideration of the bill was made.
At 1:45 o'clock the House adjourned un
til January 6. 1902.

MARCONI MAKES
BIG PREDICTION
Says Messages "Will Be
Sent to England for'
a Cent a Word.
Inventor Speaks at a Lunch
of Benefits of Wire
less Telegraphy.
Special DiFnatch to The Call
ST. JOHNS, N. F., Dec. 19.â Wireless
messages to England at the rate of gnc
cent a word or less were predicted* by
Marconi at a luncheon given in his honor
by his Excellency, Governor Sir Candish
Boyle, to-day. In responding to a toast
lo his health proposed by the Governor,
Marconi said:
I with to thank his Excellency moat heartily
for the very kind remarks he lias rpade about
myself and my work. â  Although 1 have vis
ited many countries, I am quite convinced that
nowhere have I received greater assistance and
encouragement than in this colony.
If my system can be commercially estab
lished between the different parts of the earth,
a possibility of which. I may state I have' not
the slightest doubt, it would not fail to bring
about an enormous cheapening of the methods
of communication.
At present the existing system of submarine
cables fulfills that object to a large extent,
but the creat cost of the cables themselves and
their heavy workine expenses causes the
charges to be beyond the reach of the majority
of the people inhabiting the various countries.
But could this new, method be anolied I be
lieve the cost of what we now call â¢"cableing"
to England might be reduced at least twenty
fold.
The present rates are, if 1 1 am not mistaken.
25 cents a word. Eventually with a wireless
system the cost should be reduced to one cent
a word or less.
1 have spoken of the benefit wireless teleg
raphy may prove to the different nations of th<>
world, but as I am at least half a Britisher,
I wish to emphasize with all respect that to
the British empire it has quite a special im
portance, as it will facilitate the methods of
communication between the mother country
and her great â¢ colonies beyond the seas, and it
cannot result but in still more firmly cement
ins that bond of unity and common cause In
the interest of civilization of which the em
pire has eiven such splendid examples to the
world during the anxious times of the last
two or three yeajs.
Gentlemen, this colony was the first In which
a messasre was received by cable from across
the ocean, and I am glad to oay it has equally
been the first to receive a message across the
same ocean without a cable. It !s my sin
cere wish that if there is anything useful In
my method this country should not be last or
least in participating of its benefits.

A DELIGHTFUL OPEBA
ADMIRABLY RENDERED
St. Dominic's Junior Choir and
Choral Union Appear in "The
Bohemian Girl."
Many a professional opera * company
with something of a reputation might
with reason envy some of the stage work
of the sprightly and intelligent young
members of the St. Dominic's Junior
Choir and Choral Union which last night
not only managed to surprise its friends,
but also many an old-time Â«;>era-goer.
The youngsters had been carefully and
wonderfullv prepared and rehearsed by
Father J. S. Jones, O. P., in that beauti
ful opera of Balfe's, "The Bohemian
Girl." and it is really marvelous how re
markably even the exquisite music of the
great master and originator of English
opera waa. rendere,d. No mistakes, no
waiting, no effort, but every number
given in perfect manner and with a rare
intelligence which says a great deal for
the reverend tutor as well as for the
clever children under his musical direc
tion. â 
The audience packed Franklin Hall lit
erally from floor to celling, ai.d vocifer
ously applauded that child-wonder, Al
bertina Meyerhoffer, a youngster of but
5 years, but with the intelligence of a
prima donna. The house â¢â  went frenzied
over the bright little tot, who took up the
encores and repeated not only Balfe's
songs, but danced to the wonderment of
all. The rest of the children v.ho took
part in the admirable presentation of the
opera were: Margaret Olsen, in the role
of Count Arnhelm; Kathryn Barry,.Thad
deus; Kathleen Roche, Florensteln; Miss
Dolly Roche, Devilshoof; Frances Crowe,
captain of the guard; Birdie McKeon,
oftlcer of the guard; Edna Walsh, Arline,
and May Bird, Queen of the Gypsies.
The accompanists were Gertrude Hopkins
and Daisy Roche. Father Jones directed
the opera-
There was a large attendance of clergy,
including Fathers Hickey, S. J.; Butler,
Maximilian, O. S. F.; Kerly, Clancy,
O'Neii, Newell, O'Connor, Riley of Beni
cla, Barragan, Johns, Doogan of Vallejo,
lirothers Hosea, Zenopha and Gregory..
The entertainment was given for the

ir.ain of California in the matter of the
holding of the next Supreme Ixidge ses
sion in this city. It convenes next Au
gust..
California, through its committee at tha
Supreme Lodge session last held, succeed
ed in securing the convention for San
Francisco, and the Pythian week will be
a great event in the fraternal line. Re
ports to the general committee that has
the matter in hand show that the lodges
of this domain are working actively for

tary branch of the Knights. From re

from the different domains it is expected
that there will be at least 50,000 Knights

Every possible resource of medical sci

man's life In the hope there might be an

diminishing of strength and a gradual
fading away.- -

largest and the most successful fraternal
gathering that San Francisco can boast
of. During the session in Detroit there
were at least 130,000 Knights and stran

to understand why there should not be a
greater number in this city. He expects

somewhat conservative as to the possible
number, but the supreme chancellor :s
sanguine and thinks the estimate of the

people have not yet stopped trying to fig

Seventeen persons in the audience con

*a dozen gave two silver dollars each.
They were told emphatically . that he
wanted 'their money "for nothing." The
audience wanted money "for nothing"
also, and, on seeing confederates receive
ten dollar presents in return for single
dollars, they snapped at anything he of
fered, expecting a golden harvest at the
final distribution. .
When this distribution came the "won
der" presented each man who gave him
money a check with the , words: - "Two
Dollars for Nothing" . and "Five Dollars
for, Nothing." Those who put up ten dol
lars got cigars instead of a check. A num
ber of the victims went to the stage to
interview the : "wonder," but he held them
back at the point of 'a pistol. He left the

Treasury Secretary Gage De
cides to Retire From
the Cabinet.
WICHITA, Kans., Dec. 19.â Word from
a Cincinnati resident, who is in a posi
tion to have absolutely reliable informa
tion upon the subject, was received here
to-day to the effect that Governor Wil
liam-H. Taft of the Philippines has been
tendered the portfolio of Secretary of
State by President Roosevelt and that the
real reason for the return of the Governor
to this country is to confer with the Pres
ident upon the subject,
"I have known of this fact for some
time," the Informant says. "I was first
informed of it a few weeks after Presi
dent McKinley's death. As soon as I had
read in the dispatches that the Governor
was about to return because of his fail
ing health, I was convinced that the real
purpose was to have a verbal conference
with the President regarding the Secre
taryship. Governor Taft is an able man
and the time that he has spent in the
Philippines has enabled him to become
thoroughly familiar with the situation
there, which fact will make him an in
valuable acquisition to the Roosevelt Cab
inet. President Roosevelt has on a num
ber of occasions expressed his high re
gard for Governor Taft and the able man
ner in which he disposed of some intri
cate Philippine problems. While the fact
that he has been offered the portfolio .it
this time may be news, nevertheless his
friends and those who are in a position
to know are not at all surprised at the
announcement."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â Secretary
Gage has arranged to follow Charles Em
ery Smith and retire â¢ from the Cabinet.
He will resign some time in January and
be succeeded by an- Eastern man, proba
bly from New England. Gage was anx
ious to remain in the Cabinet until he
learned the President had financial views
of his own and was considering the
names of several other men for the place,
but without any immediate intention of
making a change. â  - -
Gage took the hint and expressed his
readiness to resign. , The President did
not urge him to remain, though he sought
to show Gage that he held him in high
esteem and felt under obligations to him
for continuing in the Cabinet through th^j
early and trying days of his administra
tion. It is said by his .friends that Gage
has made new- business connections in
Chicago and will make that city his home.
DARING ROBBER
HOLDS UP BANK
Makes a Good Haul and
Quickly Disappears
in a Buggy.
FAYETTEVILL.E, Ark., '.Dec. 19.â At
noon to-day "the Bank of Springvale, ten
miles from here, was robbed by one man.
No one was in the bank except the assist
ant cashier. The robber drove up to the
bank door in- a buggy and walked to the
cashier's desk before he was noticed. He,
compelled the assistant cashier to go to
the vault and give him all the money,
about $7000. While this was taking place
the cashier walked into the bank. He was
at .once covered by the" robber's revolver
and compelled to throw up his hands. The
robber then* hurriedly left the bank,
dropping $1000 upon the sidewalk. He
jumped into a buggy and drove rapidly
north. Officers were in pursuit before he
was fairly out of town. Two miles out
the officers came in sight of him and he
jumped from the buggy and made his way
to a thickly wooded mountain. Blood
hounds have been put on his track.

Officers Unable to Find Any
Clew to Identity of the
Assassins.
PARSONS. Kan., Dec. 13.â One of thÂ»
worst crimes since the Bender atrocities
was brought to light here this afternoon
when the* lifeless and distorted bojdles of
Colonel John F. Bull and wife were found
in the bedroom of their new home In this
city.* They had undoubtedly been mur
dered. The officers have not succeeded In
finding the faintest claw that "will aid
them in arresting the criminals.
Yesterday G. S. Anderson, a real estate
man, desired to transact some business
with Eull and went to his house for that
purpose. He could not gain admittance.
He returned to-day, and agin not being
able to rouse anybody he decided that
something was wrong. In company with
Marshal Bennett he then forced an en
trance to the house.
Mrs. Bull's body was found lying across
the bed with what appeared to be a knife
wound below the right breast. The body
of Colonel Bull was found in another part
of the room, resting on its knees. The
faces of both were badly distorted.
Colonel Bull, was a wealthy real estate
man and an old soldier, naving served
through the war in an Ohio regiment.

ment yesterday in favor of Joseph Castor,

terial and labor furnished at the special
instance of the defendants. Mayor Pho
lan was cne of the defendants In the suit
and will pay $148 38 as his portion to sat
isfy the judgment, besides $7 75 for costs.
The other directors and the amounts

tion, and they did not agree to the amend
ments.
Alexander Brothers Rearrested.
The charge against Joseph and Georga
Alexander for smuggling silk- hats and
other articles from the steamship Doric
was dismissed yesterday by United States
Court Commissioner Heacock. The court
held that as the defendants were not pas
sengers they could not have been guilty
of smuggling, and suggested that the evi
dence showed them to have been guilty of
aiding and abetting in the removal and
concealment of smuggled goods. In ac
cordance with the Commissioner's sugges
tion new complaints were prepared, new
warrants issued and the defendants rear
rested.

COPPER MARKET
STILL ERRATIC
Rapid "Rise in Prices Is
Followed by a Sharp
Decline.
Directors of Amalgamated
Vote a Dividend and
Issue Statement.
NEW YORK, Dec. â  19:â Amalgamated
Copper claimed and held interest over all
the list in tHe street to-day and went
through a rapid series of bewildering fluc
tuations. After the erratic market, had
Closed tho directors of Amalgamated met
and voted a dividend of 1 per cent and is
sued a statement placing the blame for
thÂ« decline upon the shrinkage in foreign
consumption. In this contraction it was
sttttd Amalgamated had been forced to
bear the largest loss in the effort to main
tain prices. The statement placed the
falling off in exports at 65,000 tons, and
sal J that during the last month the
United Methls Selling Company had sold
over 100.000,000 pounds for future delivery.
Barge blocks of the stock were unloaded
immediately business began on the Ex
change and about half an hour after the
opening the gain of 3 points made yester
day was wiped out. Transactions then
became very moderate. Efforts of shorts
to cover, assisted by what appeared- to be
adroit manipulation, ran It up to 66V&, or
a parity with yesterday's close. The stock
backed and filled over a range of a point
until well into the afternoon. Trading be
came excited in the last hour of business
and blocks of from 1000 to 3000 shares
changed hands frequently on a rapid rise
to G9V&. An equally rapid reaction fol
lowed to 6^/4, changes of a point being
made between sales, but the buying soon
overcame tho declining tendency and tho
price bounded up again to. 67%. Thero
â \v;u'. another slump just before the close
and the last sale was at CSft. The general
movement of the stock throughout the
day was of an exceptional character and
its dominance of the trading was repre
sented in transaction of 222,800 out of a
total for all stocks of 476,000 shares.
Small Dividend Is Announced.
The meeting of the directorate, at which
the reduced dividend was declared and the
statement in behalf of the company made
public, commenced as the market was
Closing and was attended by William
Rockefeller, H. H. Rogers, James Stlll
man, Anson R. Flower and William G.
Rockefeller. No announcement was made
for an hour and when a clerk appeared at
tho office door with an armful of type
written statements he was instantly the
center of a sensational rush. Half of the
statements were torn as the clerk . at
tempted to distribute. them in the crowd
of messengers, financial bureau men and
reporters. Announcement was made that
the dividend was 1 per cent, compared
with 1H Per cent declared in September.
The statement given out was as follows:
The conditions prevailing in the copper trade
up to the commencement of the present year
were very satisfactory, and so far as this coun
try is concerned, are still so, every copper wire,
brass and electrical manufacturing concern be
ing run to its full capacity. A large propor
tion, however, of the copper produced iu this
country has to find a market abroad. The un
satisfactory trade conditions which have ex
isted during the present year in Europe, to
gether with the fact that the supplies of cop
per to Europe from sources outside this coun
try have Increased, have Jointly caused a fall
ing oft in exports of about 65,000 tons. ThU
decrease has In some degree been compensated
for by increased domestio consumption.
By adopting the policy of maintaining a firm
price a Urge proportion of the loss arising Irom
the decrease of exports has been borne by the
companies whose shares are owned wholly or
In part by the Amalgamated Copper Compuny.
This policy hus in the past been the best foÂ«
these eonuÂ«>nÂ«ea. as the, portion of. the copper
which has been sold .has realized a larger
profit than would have been realized had all
the copper which had been produced been kolil
at a much lower price. It haa likewise pre
vented fluctuations in price, which would tend
to demoralize the business of manufacturers
consuming cc.pper.
Miners Are Now Fully Equipped.
The officials of these various companies,
after carefully considering the situation in all
its phases, decided that It would be better for
the Interests of tho company they represented
to refrain from forclnK upon tho market more
copper than was actually needed, as Â«uch. nc
tlon would only have led to abnormally low
prices. The selling agents of these companies
were, therefore. Instructed not to force upon
thÂ« market more than was actually needed for
consumption, but to maintain a firm price. If
officials ot other copper-producing companies
had taken the same view of the situation and
maintained a firm price, there is little doubt
that the present unsettled condition of the
market would have been in part, if not wholly
obviated. . â  â . . â¢*
During tha present month the United Metals
Selling Company, me selling agents for the
companies, in which the Amalgamated Copper
Company is interested, has, notwithstanding
these conditions, sold considerably over 100 -
000,000 pounds of copper for future delivery. '
During the past two yeara the companies in
which the Amalgamated Copper Company is
interested have equipped, their mines and
smelters with the latest improvements and
most modern labor-saving appliances, and one
of these companies has built the largest and
best-equipped smelter in existence. This can
be put In commission early in the new year
bo that from now on these companies can pro
duce copper at a cost that can successfully
compete with any copper producer in the world
The future prosperity of the copper business dd
pends largely upon such a revival of foreign
trade as will bring the total consumption of
copper nearer to the production than is the
case at present.

DOWIE BREAKS
DOWN ON STAND
Tearfully Tells a Story
of Alleged Breach
of Confidence.
Denounces Brother - in - Law
and Tries to, Throw
Blame on Him.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19.â John . Alexander
Dowie, the proclaimed "Elijah the Re
storer," broke down when he went on the
witness stand to-day in his own behalf,
and between choking sobs told how his
confidence in hia brother-in-law and legal
opponent, Samuel Stevenson, had been
shaken. The portly figure of . the aged
witness shook spasmodically and tears
streamed down his face as he related
memories of Stevenson's espousal Of
Dowie's sister, now deceased. Later, as
he was ; cross-examined, his meek and
lowly demeanor changed, and he de
nounced Stevenson, called him an
"abominable traveling companion." and
said that he was no use in Zion, and was
always blundering. -
Juage Tuly's court was packed to over
flowing with followers ot â¢\Klijah H,"
who followed minutely the "doctor's"
testimony, and who, at the end *of the
day's session, gathered around him to
act as his bodyguard back to Zion,
- The. testimony offered by Dowie was
to the ettect that he had given Stevenson
checks aggregating $50.00o, ostensibly to
release certain indebtedness between
them. The checks were exhibited In
court and showed indorsements by Mary
Ann Stevenson for stock' in Zlon lace
industries. Dowie went into great de
tall to show how the stock had actually
come into his possession, explaining that
ho had been 'Immediately surprised" ' to
llnd tho certificates for the stock In his
private safe. . Stevenson had set up the
claim that he had never received tho
certificates. Dowle set down as "non
sense" the charge that by "honeyed
words or artifice he hnd inveigled Stev
enson to como to America to talce charge
of the lace Industrie?, and denied that ho
hnd used any power whatever to that
end.
The all night session, -which, according
to testimony, were frequent with Dowle
and his disciples, were explained as nec
essary because he was a "very busy
man." He also explained somo of the
methods of Zlon's financial operations, in
an effort to prove .that Stevenson's claim
to a joint partnership with him in the lace
Industry was at no time ever contem
plated.
C. J. Barnard, general manager of
Dowle's Zlon Bank, told of Stevenson's
objection to the manner In which the lace
Industries were being managed and haw
he had asked for $150,000 to give up his
interest in them.
During the cross-examination of Banker
Barnard. Attorney Reeves drew from him
testimony that tho certificates â  for $10,000
worth of lace stock, made out to Mary
"Ann Stevenson, and which had disap
peared, came to light after Mrs. Steven
son's death in Dowle's own safe. Bar
nard related that Dowle had said won
ders would never cease and that he was
utterly at a loss to find the document
among his private papers.
A sharp tilt between Judge Tuly and At
torney Packard, for the defense, ensued
when Captain H. "Worthington Judd, sec
retary of the Zlon lace industries and tha
Zion Land and Investment Association.
was called to the stand. Attorney Reeves
had asked Judd whether he believed Im
plicitly that Dowie was. Elijah. Packard
objected to the question,, but the Judye
ruled It pertinent to the case, and Judd
affirmed his belief that the preacher was
the prophet of olden times.

she was not a bit backward yesterday in
informing the court that the letters pur
porting 1 to be written by Cheyney were
from the pen of her alleged husband,
laken altogether, the letters written by
Cheyney and his alleged wife are as trop
ical in tone as any letters that have been
seen at the City Hall in a number of
years. Like Maud's letters, those of
Cheyney were changeable. One would be
full of fatherly advice, references to good
deeds and of kind expressions, while an
other would speak only of love. About
forty of the mining man's letters were
read. They all were addressed to "My

"wiffle." They testified, however, that
though they* had frequently seen Chey
ney and Maud Nevill together, they had
never heard him refer to her as his wife
Miss Nevill also â¢ identified a letter in
her own handwriting and signed "Maud "
received by Cheyney while she was vis
iting in Oakland. She claims that this
letter was written by her at Cheyney's
dictation. The letter is an appeal for
help, and in it she claims she was made
to say, "You have promised to be my

ROBBER THANKS
INTENDED VICTIM
Broker Neville Advises
Thief While Looking
Down a Gun.
Assailant Departs in Tears
and Sends Explana
tory Letter.
Driven desperate with the thought that
his poverty would deprive his wife and
babies of even the comforts of life on, the
coming Yuletide, a well dressed man, with
the bearing of a gentleman, entered the
establishment of E. H. Neville, a money
broker at 114 .Montgomery street, shortly
after 8 o'clock yesterday morning. He
promptly covered Neville with a revolver
and ordered him to pass out a tray of
gold and silver that rested on a shelf be
hind the counter. Neville coolly turned
to the gentleman robber and said: . . ;
"You may shoot me if you want to,
but I will not give you any money; not
a dollar."
Neville's manner filled the would-be
thief with, amazement, and noting that
bis refusal to comply with the demand to
surrender his gold had been effective for
the time' at least Neville again com
menced to talk.
"A man of your appearance and. appa
rent health snould oe ashamed to tatce
this means of enriching himself. There
are many ways one may make a living
and an honest one, too," said Neville,
moving round the counter toward the
man, who still held his pistol pointed at
the broker's head.
When Neville reached the gate that led
into the main passageway of the estab
lishment the man who came for his gold
lowered his weapon.
"No! No! I can't kill a man," he said,
half to himself, half to Neville.
Then Neville began to talk again, rea
soning with the man who came to rob
him, "and," said Neville, "the tears be
gan to course down his cheeks. I fol
lowed him to the door. He stopped,
turned round and we shook hands. He
was not a rascal. .This I knew, and my
words to him. It is my opinion, stopped
him in the commission of a crime, which,
if carried' out, as I afterward learned he
intended to do, would have taken him to
the gallows and his family to endless
sorrow.
"But the remarkable part of the story
is yet to come. The afternoon mail
brought to me a letter from my visitor
of the morning. It was not signed, but
was full of expression of gratitude that
he had left my place with his hands free
of my blood. He said he was desperate.
His family was In want and his children
hungry. He had decided upon my estab
lishment as the easiest to loot. Passing
along the street he saw me behind the
counter, saw the gold and silver in tho
trays on the shelf and stepped into the
door.
"He intended, he said in his letter, that
if I resisted he would kill me. He would
fire four shots into my body, take my
gold and try to escape to his home with
the money that would mean so much to
those dependent on him, and then. If cap
ture was probable, he would end his life
with the one remaining bullet in his
weapon. But I had stopped him from
carrying out his purpose, and his deter
mination to win honest comforts for those
at home was strengthened.
"He is not a rascalâ a criminal through
inclination, tie had been driven to at
tempt this crime and to sacrifice his life
if need be to bring the comfort that gold
would brine: to his wife and babies,
though he did not think of the dark years
ahead for those he was so wlllingf to help
had my life and his been the cost of
their momentary opulence." . â¢

SENIOR SENATOR
PERKINS COMES
OFF THE FENCE
The President and Bard
Compel Him to De
scend.
Ousted Faction of Labor
Party Goes to Law for
Help. /
Senator Bard and other members of the
California Congressional delegation, as
sisted by Charles M. Belshaw and sus
tained by the President, have compelled
Senator Perkins to declare himself. It
appears that the President heartily ap
preciates the humor of the situation. Our
senior Senator has held for a long time
the record for clever balancing on: the
fence, but at last he has been compelled
to alight.
For the past year Perkins has been
representing: to the anti-boss forces in
California that he was ready to join Sen
ator Bard in recommending a change in
the Collectorship of Internal Revenue,
First California District. At the same
time he was representing to the machine
politicians of the State that he would not
join in a measure to bring about a change.
Before leaving California for Washington
the adroit Senator found his position on
the fence quite uncomfortable and sought
to, extricate himself by transferring the
Lynch fight to the whole Congressional
delegation on the ground that the Sen
ators could not agree. Representatives
Loud.Kahn, Metcalf, Coombs, Needham,
Woods and McLachlan resolved that the
Senator should not escape in that direc
tion and accordingly 'refused to mix in.
In the meantime President Roosevelt was
apprised of the Senator's dilemma and
whenever the latter visited the White
House the President advised him to settle
the collectorship differences with Senator
Bard. â
Forced to Declare Himself.
Finding all avenues of evasion closed
the senior Senator had to come down and
enter a protest against the removal of
John C. Lynch. Everybody in Washing
ton Is laughing and th<* President and
Senator Bard are being congratulated for
their success in forcing the wily Senator
to declare himself. It is reported that
the President was highly amused when
Senator Perkins remarked: "As chairman
of the Senate Committee on Civil Service
RÂ«form I cannot consistently recommend
the removal of an efficient public serv
ant."
Senator Perkins will keep his agreement
with the machine to retain Lynch until
he can find some adroit method of break
ing it, but break it he will by some twist
or turn, for he cannot afford to remain
in the position of being responsible for
the retention of Lynch. Ultimately he
will be constrained to accept the sugges-.
tion of the President and come to an
agreement with Senator Bard on the Col
lectorship. The President signifies that
he will not make a change in the office
against the protest of the senior Senator,
hence Perkins must take the whole re
sponsibility for Lynch's retention. The
President is obviously determined that the
Republicans of California shall know
where the responsibility rests.
Next Senatorial Contest.
The subject is bound to have an im
portant bearing on the next Senatorial
election. There is nothing In the patron
age of the Revenue Collector's office to
Justify a party squabble for the spoils,
but here a principle is involved. Lynch,
as the known agent, of corrupt bosses
and the active servant of the Southern
Pacific, repeatedly left his Federal of
fice in San Francisco to visit j Sac
ramento . and engage in the low
est kind of . political work to de
feat the will of the anti-boss Re
publicans. After the defeat of the bosses
by .the election of Senator Bard Lynch
used the prestige of his Federal posi
tion to fight Republican candidates for
the Legislature who refused to take or
ders from the railroad. In sustaining
Lynch Senator Perkins has forfeited his
right to expect the support " of anti-boss
Republicans In the next contest for
United States Senator. It is no secret
that Belshaw, Greenwell, Nelson, Cald
well and other hold-over State Senators
regret that Perkins has seen fit to cast
his political fortunes with the avowed
champions of boss rule.

Who Is Believed to Be
a Cracksman.
The mystery surrounding the identity of
the man -who fell to his death from a
third-story window at 933 Mission street
Wednesday night has been cleared up, but
it has been .succeeded by a deeper one.
The detectives found in the room from
which the man plunged downward to
a tragic death' a portion of a kit of bur
glar's tools, and are now diligently seek
ing a young man who came to San Fran
cisco last Saturday from Fresno in the
company of a girl known as May Taylor.

safe-cracker, or he may turn out to be
simply an amateur with a lately acquired
ambition to become a knight of the jim
my.
The remains of the dead man were iden
tified at the Morgue late yesterday after
noon as those of Conrad Kemp, a quarry
man, who arrived on "Wednesday from
Arizona, where he had been at work.

old acquaintances of Kemp, Identified the
remains positively. Kemp had called at
Sawyer's place immediately after reach

the quarryman had about $65 with him
and said that he was expecting a draft
for ?150 yesterday from San\a. Barbara.
"When Kemp's body was found on the
pavement there was less than a dollar in
change in the pockets.
May Taylor returned at 2:30 o'clock to
the room, in which she had been with
Kemp. She. said. she had met him soon
after 11 o'clock and had taken him to her
room. She accounted for her absence at
the -line of the tragedy by saying that he
had given her money to go out and get an
oyster loaf and she had left on that mis
sion. She asserts that Kemp was intoxi
cated. â¢
The girl says that she came from Fresno
with a man named "Frank," whom she
had' known but a week. He told her he
was a waiter, but was tired of working in
Fresno and would go to San Francisco
with her. They arrived Saturday and
took a room at the Mint House. Tuesday
evening, the girl says, "Frank" left, say
ing he would not be back until very late.
He did not return at all and she claims
not to have seen him since.
The burglar's tools consist of a Jimmy,
several drills, two .sticks of giant powder,
a coil of fuse and two dynamite caps.
They were in a dress suit case on which
were the initials "R. W. T." The girl
claims that she did not know of their
presence In the dress suit case, except
that sne looked into the case once in
"Frank's", absence and -saw the jimmy,
b,ut did not know what it was and was
afraid to ask "Frank" about it.
PROPERTY OF MRS. BKT.T,
ATTACHED BY HER SOtf
Legal Battle Is Once More Waged
Against "Mammy" Pleasant 's
Former Mistress.
The latest move in the Mrs. Bell
"Mammy" Pleasant legal controversy
was made yesterday by Attorney Frank
M. Stone and F. T. Bell, son of Mrs.
Theresa Bell. The son- and the lawyer
secured an attachment on the properties
located on Octavia and "Webster streets.
Some three or four days ago Attorney
Stone and Sam Davis of Carson created
considerable stir in legal circles by an
nouncing that "Mammy" Pleasant was
once again to be made the contral figure
in a legal battle. They petitioned the
Superior Court to remove George Eaton,
assignee of the old colored woman, and
announced that the reason they petitioned
for his removal was his failure to bring
the suits demanded by "Mammy." The
petition came up before Judge Troutt, who
gave Eaton until December 23 to answer.
Just what position Mrs. Bell's son holds
In the forces attacking his mother's
property Is not known, but It Is presumed
that as he is the person who yesterday
secured the attachment he has joined the
forces of the old servant of his father
and mother. #
