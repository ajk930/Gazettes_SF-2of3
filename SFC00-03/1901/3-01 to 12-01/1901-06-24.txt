began, accompanied by a severe elcc

continuing for several hours.. The
itorm, , a veritable cloudburst, con
tinued throughout the entire day and

Many miles of the Norfolk and West

communication is entirely cut off west
of Elkhorn. so that it is impossible to
learn the full extent of the loss of life
and property, but officials of the coal

received a report that on a conservative
estimate the loss of life will easily reach
200. Some of the drowned are among
the most prominent citizens of the coal

SCOT22 OF THE FLOOD.
The Pocahontas coal field is located
in a basin, with high mountain ranges
on either side, Elkhorn creek flowing
through the center of the basin, which
ranges from one-fourth to one mile in
width. iUÂ£
From Tennis, W. Va., to Vivian
yards, a distance of ten miles, miners'
cabins, coal company commissaries and
coke plants line the basin. The Elk
horn Creek, being fed by numerous
small streams coming from the .moun
tain side, rises very rapidly.
This waterspout^ came so suddenly
that the entire basin between the two
mountain ranges was flooded and be
fore the terror-stricken people realized
Â¦what wa* upon them they were carried
down by the flood, which swept every
thing in its path.
The little town of Keystone, with a
population of about 2000, seems the
greatest mfferer, practically the entire
town being washed away. This town is
the principal one in the Pocahontas
coal fields and is located near its center.
It was to a great extent the headquar
ters from which the mining population
purchased supplies and . was also the
only place in the field where whisky
could be purchased. At this place there
â¢were twelve or fifteen saloons, all of
which were washed away. The report

ulation of the district has been made homeless. Miles of railway trackage has been washed away and the mines of the district are flooded.
Those who escaped death have fied up the mountains for safety and thousands are without shelter. Owing to the destruction of railway commu

BLUEFIELD, W. Va.. June
23. â This section has just
been visited by a flood, the
'extent of which, in all prob
ability, will equal or exceed
that of Johnstown- in 1880. so
far as the loss of property is concerned.
Early yesterdajfcmornmg, shortly after
midnight, a heavy downpour of rain
began, accompanied by a severe elcc
*rical storm which increased in volume,
continuing for several hours.. The
itorm, , a veritable cloudburst, con
tinued throughout the entire day and
night.
Many miles of the Norfolk and West
ern RaDxoad track, bridges and tele
graph line*, are entirely destroyed and
communication is entirely cut off west
of Elkhorn. so that it is impossible to
learn the full extent of the loss of life
and property, but officials of the coal
companies located in the stricken dis
trict have sent out messengers to Elk
horn, the terminus of both telegraphic
and railroad communication, and have
received a report that on a conservative
estimate the loss of life will easily reach
200. Some of the drowned are among
the most prominent citizens of the coal
fields.
SCOT22 OF THE FLOOD.
The Pocahontas coal field is located
in a basin, with high mountain ranges
on either side, Elkhorn creek flowing
through the center of the basin, which
ranges from one-fourth to one mile in
width. iUÂ£
From Tennis, W. Va., to Vivian
yards, a distance of ten miles, miners'
cabins, coal company commissaries and
coke plants line the basin. The Elk
horn Creek, being fed by numerous
small streams coming from the .moun
tain side, rises very rapidly.
This waterspout^ came so suddenly
that the entire basin between the two
mountain ranges was flooded and be
fore the terror-stricken people realized
Â¦what wa* upon them they were carried
down by the flood, which swept every
thing in its path.
The little town of Keystone, with a
population of about 2000, seems the
greatest mfferer, practically the entire
town being washed away. This town is
the principal one in the Pocahontas
coal fields and is located near its center.
It was to a great extent the headquar
ters from which the mining population
purchased supplies and . was also the
only place in the field where whisky
could be purchased. At this place there
â¢were twelve or fifteen saloons, all of
which were washed away. The report

AN APPALLING disaster, rivaling the Johnstown flood, has visited the Elkhorn Valley in West Virginia, Precipitated by a cloudburst a torrent
of water vswept down through a narrow vale between two mountain ranges, destroying in whole or in part the towns of Keystone, Vivian,
Northfork, Fennis, Landgraff, Tazewell, Elkhorn and Welch, [n Keystone, a place of 2OOO inhabitants, only one house was left standing. Conserv
ative estimates place the number of deaths in the flood at 200, The damage to property will reach at least three millions. Almost the entire pop
ulation of the district has been made homeless. Miles of railway trackage has been washed away and the mines of the district are flooded.
Those who escaped death have fied up the mountains for safety and thousands are without shelter. Owing to the destruction of railway commu
nication it is impossible to send immediate relief. Troops have been ordered out to protect property and* State officials of West Virginia are
moving to succor the destitute.

NEW HAVEN. Conn., June 23.â
Coming on the eve of the Yale
commencement exercises, the
death of Adelbert S. Hay. former
United States Consul to Pretoria
and eldest son of Secretary of State John
Hay, has cast a gloom over the university
town. The full details of the terrible ac
cident which cost his life will never be
known. Mr. Hay had rooms at the New
Haven House for commencement week.
It Is generally supposed that after going
to his rooms he went to the window for
air. and. uktlng on the sill, he fell Into
a dore. Then, losing^hls balance, he fell
to the pavement !ielow, a distance of fully
sixty feet. The fallresultol In instant
death.
How it all happened became a matter of
speculation on the part of the throng of
curious spectators who gathered, and a
subject of mournful inquiry for the class
ma ,tes a n< j friends of the young man. A
half dozen physicians who were hastily
summoned were unable to do anything,
and the body awaited Its disposition at
the orders of the Coroner's deputy. That
official pronounced It a case of accidental
death. The body was removed as soon
as possible to tho rooms of a nearby
undertaker, where it awaited Instructions
from the family. Repeated efforts to lo
cate Secretary Hay by wire were futile
until the early morning hours, when a re
quest from the father reached Seth Mose
ley, the proprietor of the hotel, to take
care of the body until the members of the
family could reach town.
Tracing Victim's Movements.
Meanwhile the. sensation occasioned by
the tragedv continued. Every movement
of young Hay was traced In an effort to
penetrate the uncertainties of the awful
affair. It was learned that the young man.
on May Z). left Washington with his
mother and two sisters for Newburn, N.
! H:,- the summer home of -Secretary Hay.
Last week he left New Hampshire for
New. lork. where he Â»pent some days.
He arrived in New Haven last evening In
time for dinner and went Immediately to
tho.JK-w Haven Ho'jse. where lie whu as

the hotel office.
Young Hay was one- of the vanguard of
the Academic class of Yale, "98. He had
come to his old college town* as a member
of his class triennial committee, and ar
rived early to assist his colleagues on the
committee in preparing for the festivities
of comn-.encement week In general and frr
the class supper In particular. He took
dinner with some of his classmates and at
S o'clock hurried to the Hyperion Theater,
where he witnessed the evening perform
ance He ppfnt a quiet hour in the hotel
corridors and smoking-room after the
theater and shortly after midnight retired
to his room, remarking to the hotel clerk
that he was sleepy and leaving a call for
9 o clock this morning. Ho was not Â«*rn
again until his body came whirling
through the air to its destruction two and
a half hours later.

man was quartered faces on Chap.u

by young Hay was found a partly con-
Bumed cigarette. On the floor near the
window was a ring worn by the .victim.
His clothing had been neatly arranged,
and the bed clothing was drawn back.
The bed. however, had not been occupied.
Here the mystery becomes Intangible.
Tho popular theory seems to have it that
the young man, having prepared for bed
thought to indulge In a "good niÂ«ht
Fmoke." that he chose the cool of the win
dow, possibly dozed lost his balance and
fell from the window. The presence of
the ring on the floor, however, gave rlsa
to the fancy that possibly, while toying
with the ring. It dropped and that in an
effort to recover it the fall resulted. How
ever It happened, the known facts soem
to make It conclusive that It was all a
frightful accident.
Young Hay, It was remarked. -was in
particularly good spirits and had planned
with unusual enthusiasm to participate In
many engagements this week. In the
harbor lies n yacht on which, with a par
ty of his friends, he had promised to take
a trip on Wednesday to New London for
the Yale-Harvard boat races on Thurs
day.
No Bones Are Broken.
An examination of the body of the
young man disclosed a discoloration of
tho- right forehead, a contusion on thc
right arm and an abrasion on the right
leg. A plain ring worn on the right hand
was bent ami cut. No bones were broken
and' there were no external fractures of
the skull. In the sixty-foot flight down
ward tho body escaped striking a balcony
one story below and crashed upon thu
pavement with all the force of a mo
mentum Increased by thc weight of a wan
of such large proportions as young Hay.
Those members of thn oI.-ikh of '0& who
are in town, after tho examination of the
Coroner's phy*icinr.. escorted the body

In closing r>r. Hartley a gain' referred to

Later to a reporter of the Associated

A conference of leading Republicans was
held to-night and much' time was devotcil
to the consideration of thc nomination of
ex-Congresaman John A. Caldwcll for
Lleute.nant-Govrrnor. It was the general
Impression, after the conference was over,
that Caldwcll would be rcnomlnated.
It Is proposed to have a resolution in
the platform Indorsing Senntor Foraker's
re-election, and some of the antl-salodn
men threaten opposition to the Senator if
Caldwcll is nominated. Otherwise the
platform will conform to the views of Sen
ator Foraker on national Issues and of
Governor Nash on State issues, with the
specific indorsement of the policy of Pres

PENZANCE. June 23.â There Is now no
doubt that the captain, mate and four
men of the British bark Falkland, Captain
Gracle, from Tacotna January 30 for Fal
mouth, which was wrecked off Bishop's
Rock June 22, are drowned. The bodv of
Mate Baleson was recovered this after
noon. Â«
According to thc stories of the survivors
the Falkland missed stays and was swung
Into Bishop's Rock with great violence.
The ship immediately began to settle
down. At the time of the accident the
weather was bad and great confusion pre
vailed on board. Owing to her heavy list
it was only possible to get out one life
boat. With the majority of the crew and
the captain's wife and child on board, this
boat picked up two men who had jumped
into the waterTbut owing to the heavy sea
and tho fact that the boat was already
overjoaded the survivors had to turn away
from a third man, who was seen clinging
to a hencoop. . .. â¢ . ,
Captain Gracie and the mate were last
seen standing on the Falkland's poop,
which blew up. After one hour In the sea
the boat sighted the St. Agnes lifeboat,
which brought them to St. Marys Island,
where they were provided 'with clothing
and fond, as they had saved nothing but
the clothes they stood In. "A boy who
jumped into the sea and was rescued by
the St. Agnes boat after he had been
twenty minutes In the water says he saw
Captain Grade and other men jump from
the Falkland Into the sea and that they
wore lifebelts.
A body seen floating In the water to-day
Is supposed to be that of the man seen
clinging to a hencoop by those who got
away In the ship's boat. The wife of Cap
tain Grade Is very ill. The survivors of
the Falkland will be land<.-d here Monday.

Festetlcs, who nas figured In many sen
sational episodes in this city, has succeed
ed In eluding the police for a week. They
have traced the pair to New Jersey towns,
but there thc trail disappeared completely.
â¢The Countess tie Festetics, nearly beside
herself from grief and anxiety, believes
that her husband has fled with the boy to
Europe. The police, however, think that
he Is In hiding somewhere near this city.
The kidnaping is the climax of the sen
sational domestic troubles of the Festetlcs
and adds another exciting chapter to the
checkered career of the Austrian noble
man. â¢ Festetlcs and his wife are legally
separated. Tb.e agreement gave to her the
custody of the boy Dwight. #
Recently negotiations have been pend
ing with the ob.1ect that the father might
see the child oftener. Through a repre
sentative he succeeded In regaining the
sympathy of the Countess to such an ex
tent that she consented to allow him to
keep the child overnight. He disappeared
with the little one and has not been seen
since.

tetics. a daughter of Mrs. Louis T. Hag
gin, was divorced in January. The Count
and Countess Rudolph Festetlcs had no
child.
Non-Union Men Resist
an Attack Made on
Railway Shops.
COLUMBIA. S. C, June 23.â The South
ern Railway shops in this city were at
tacked at 3:30 o'clock this morning by a
mob of several score of men. No damage
to property was attempted except to break
through the high fence surrounding the
yards. The strikers were after the non
union workmen, and made for a car in
which twenty were sleeping. A man
whose name is said to be Myers was on
guard. He fired both barrels of his. -gun
into the crowd, receiving himself a 32-cmII
tÂ»r bullet In his forehead, but the skull
was not penetrated. Thft mob fired a
great many bullets Into the car In which
the men were sleeping. None of the non
union men were wounded, but after they
had been dragged out of the car they were
pretty severely handled. They were
marched up the railroad tracks several
miles and ordered to travel north.
Later In the day all but one of these
men were brought back to the city by an
expedition pent out from the shops. It
was not until this afternoon that it was
known that many of thn rioters had been
wounded. Close inquiry developed the
fact that the wounds, of four men, one
of whom was seriously hurt, had been
dressed this morning by two physicians.
The doctors said they did not know the
names of the men. A half dozen police
men are stationed at the shops to-night,
but no further trouble Is anticipated.

CAMP GAGE. June 23.â Where but a
day ago the white tents dotted the hills
of Laveaga Heights now all is deserted.
Except for a few canvasses left by the
First Infantry, some heaps of rub
bish are all that tell of the troops de
parted.
The First Brigade left yesterday, ami
this morning early the Third Brigade
gathered Its property and starte'd for
town. The Second Infantry left flrat.
about 7 o'clock, and an hour after the^
Sixth followed It. At fifteen minutes past
9 the Fifth left camp and a few minutes
later the artillery battalion marched
away. At 10 the First Infantry moved cut
and at a few minutes after 10 the head
quarters of the division was broken up
and General Dickinson and his staff de
parted. ' ...
The flag went up as usual this morning,
but at 7:30 o'clock it came down again
with full honors/ A battalion from the
Fifth Infantry and one from the First
were ordered to form on the color line
and the naval militiamen manned the
guns and sent a national salute of twen
ty-one guns thundering over the hHH.
The band of the First' Infantry played
the 'Star Spangled Banner."- and while
all stood uncovered the standard was low
ered by a detail from the naval militia.
The regiments marched away with
bands playing, one working upon the
lamlliar strains of "Home, Sweet Home"
and the other jauntily playing "I Don't
Care If You Never Come Back." This
tune was popular also with* the Fifth, for
the band of the Fifth tuned up on It until
the regiment was well down the grade
and the musicians were quite out of
breath.
The breaking up of camp was under the
supervision of Major Off. acting division
quartermaster. Lieutenant Colonel Hos
mer and Major Hewes of the division
*l A ~- The y w ere up with the birds and
the result of their energv was that thc
camp was broken a full hour before even

the First Brigade, but when Lleuteni nt i
Colonel RIckon.'the division quarternvis

denly ordered to fill his place. Major Off
took hold like an old hand and under his

. SENATOR ' OBORQB C. PJDRKIN8-Z
Two years ago: In fact.' when I first
went to Washington, I felt the necessity
of connection between San Francisco and
the Farallones and I endeavored at first
to get the project for such a connection
indorsed by the Treasury Department,
which has the lighthouses to deal with.
But It did not see fit to recommend It.
because the Interior Department, which
has to do with the "Weather Bureau, was
looking Into the matter. I first tried to
have a connection by wire established be
tween Point Reyes and then between San
Francisco and the Farallones. Last year
Mr. Moore, who is under the Secretary of
the Interior, said that the connection
woijld be useful not only for agricultural
ists but also to give warning of cold
"weather and storms. He also said that as
soon as the system was perfected the Sec
retary would recommend It to Congress.
I said at the time that it had not been
sufficiently developed, but since then The
CaU and the New York Herald have done
a great * dÂ«al In Us advancement.
The Herald in the East off Staten Island.
I beliove. and The Call on the Pacific
Coast. If the wireless system works suc
cessfully, aa. la shown by the dispatch In
The Call to-day, there is no doubt that
that system will be Introduced.
As to Its advantages, anybody of Intelli
gence who has engaged In or knows any
thing of commercial life can speak. Profes
sor Moore of the United States Weather
Bureau has stated In his advocacy of the
system that vessels coming up the coast,
say at Ban . Diego, and other points, and
vessels up north In Puget Sound and other
places would be able to signal their pass*

It is within the realms of possibility that
In a few years telegraphic and telephonic
messages will be carried through 2000
miles of ether that divide this coast from
the Paradise of the Pacific.
Three years ago the world marveled
when Marconi flashed messages through
space in conducting his experiments. In
a spirit of envy and malice certain "yel
low papers" sneered and scoffed when
Tho Call set the pace by first using wire
lens telegraphy In gathering news.
But with marvelous strides wireless tel
egraphy has gone forward, until within
the present month the Cunard steamship
Lriicannia succeeded In sending messages
100 miles from sea to a land station. It
Is not Improbable, therefore, that In a
few years messages will l-e sent from
thlfc city to the Hawaiian Islands by
means of the Marconi wireless tele
graphic system.
A nnmlxT of prominent citizens of this
city were asked yesterday for their views
on the establishment of a wireless sys
tem of telegraphy between the Faral
lones and San Francisco, as promised by
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson. All
wore loud in their praise of The Call's
efforts to secure the establishment of the
plant, and declared that It would be of
great value to the commerce of this city
and State. - ' â¢
CONGRESSMEN GIVE

The presence In Ran Francisco of the
Congressional Committee on Rlvors and
Harbors presented tho opportunity of se
curing the views of nomo of the commit
teemen. Those of the committee who
were in tho city yesterday ' consented to
speak on the subject. Their statements

THE success of The Call's advo
cacy of a system of wireless
telegraphy between the Faral
lonea an<l the shore and the
news that the Government
tvouM shortly Install a suitable
plant at the points named
caused general fatisfactlon in all circles
in this city yesterday.
The subject was generally discussed.
en<1 on all sides was expressed keen
pleasure that San Francisco was to re
ceive recognition as a favorable spot in
which the latest marvel of electrical
Â¦ctence should be put to practical use.
The business community, as represented
by presidents of various Â«-ommerci*l or

nouncement that in the mar future wlre
k:*s telegraphy will be in operation be

ty miles from the shore. For many years
the rc-presentatK-es of San Francisco In
Congress have been urged to secure from
the Government telegraphic communica
tion between the Farallones and the
mainland. The Chamber of Commerce haÂ«
many time* requested that a cable be laid
on the ocean bed, but while many prr.m
lÂ«es were made by officials In Washington
nothing material resulted. Facts as to the
urgent tweeâ tty of the cable were com
piled and the cost was investigated, but
beyond that point nothing was done.
With the Invention of Marconi and the
ed\-ocacy of wireicus telegraphy by The
Call It was ir&Jlze<i by the commercial
bodies of this city that it was but a ques
tion of time when the long desired com
munication wit/j the Farallones would be
secured.

. Two years ago The Call gave to tbft
people of San Francisco the details of the
International yacht races within a few
minutes after they had happened. Thla
marvel of news gathering was due to th*
system of wireless telegraphy operated by
the New Tork Herald between the seen*
of the yacht races and Its office In New
York City and then sent to The CaU of
fices here by direct wire.
The experiments conducted a few days
ago to establish the possibility of sending
pictures by wireless telegraphy renders tt
possible that when The Call gives the de
tails of the forthcoming yacht races th!Â»
fall by means of the wireless system of
cews gathering It will at the same tlma
be able to present faithful reproductions
of the movements of the yachts that will
struggle for the America's cup.

r THMlE EFFORTS of The Call to secure a system of wireless telegraphy between San Francisco and the Farallones have been watched with great interest by the entire business community, and its success in that direction
r v I is a source of pleasure to every one interested in the subject.
; 1 . m For m * n >' >' ears the Chamber of Commerce tried to secure a cable between the Farallones and the mainland. We live in the age of rapid transit and communication. The benefits^that will accrue from the es- .
c : tablishment of the wireless telegraphic system are numerous. Not only will incoming ships be reported, but warning can be sent to outgoing vessels in case of storm on land. Vessels in distress will be able to call for
aid and important information can be secured by the Weather Burea officials as to approaching changes in atmospheric conditions. The loss of the Rio is but one of many reasons for the establishment of rapid communica
tion between the Famllones and the shore. If the Rio had been reported on the night she arrived at the Farallones tugs could have gone out and brought the passengers and mails into port, leaving the vessel to follow
when the fog lifted. , . ;
It is important that the arrival of an incoming ocean vessel be reported as soon as possible. Merchants could make arrangements for receiving and forwarding freight and much valuable time would be saved Insur
ance rates are very often affected by the non-arrival of a vessel on tin*. The necessity for a system of rapid communication between arriving ships and the shore is as vital as the problems of rapid transit and communica-
S? n Â£Â£ haVC 1 the attentlo Â» of the civilized world in the last fifty years. Time saved, is money saved, and in the event of disaster aid sent to a vessel would mean the saving of life. Personally I wish to congratulate

THE VALUE OF GOOD HARBORS
WHILE our own harbors arc under consider
ation by the Committee on Rivers and Har
bors it should nut be forgotten that while
the purposes of our commerce are served by good
domestic harbors they arc served also by good and
safe harbors in other countries with which we have
maritime trade. We have trade now, and hope to
increase it, with the west coast of Central and South
America, but it is hampered by the lack of good har
bors. South of Acapulco there is not a land
locked harbor in use on that coast.
The recent accident by the swamping of boats in
the roadstead of Acajutla, Salvador, calls pointed at
tention to this condition. As the Pacific end of an
isthmian canal is approached there is not a safe har
bor on the entire coast where ships can lie to a dock
and receive coal or a cargo. The entire traffic has
to be done by lighters, in open roadsteads. Such arc
the seaport* of Acajutla, La Union and La Libertad,
Salvador, and all the rest. Some years ago our Gov
ernment made a hydrographic survey of a land
locked harbor in a bay on the coast of Salvador, but
the offered facility for commerce seems riot to be
available, and our trade with that republic is carried
on in the costliest and clumsiest way, in roadsteads
that arc exposed to gales and offer but indifferent
or unsafe anchorage. For. this reason Salvador, in
many respects the richest in resources of any of the
isthmian republics south of Mexico, remains unde
veloped and we are deprived of a trade that would be
profitable to both countries.
Upon such problems the commercial opinion 'of the
world should be brought to bear. Nations agree
upon many policies, political and administrative in
their nature. They have postal, commercial, extra
dition and expatriation treaties and agreements, in
the execution of which they co-operate and agree.
Why not by similar means agree upon furnishing the
very best facilities for mutual maritime commerce?
For instance, it should be easy to make Salvador
see that such an accident as that at Acajutla is inju
rious to her trade! by cxp'osing her lack of safe har
bors; and an agreement to send the steamers of an
American line, carrying mails, and merchandise for
exchange, and facilitating the social and business in
tercourse of the two peoples, to a safe harbor when
constructed, should stimulate her 'energies to attend
to such an important matter.,
If the Pan-American Congress is held this is a sub
ject that might well be discussed for the mutual bene
fit of all the nations represented. The internal wealth
and prosperity of, each is promoted by facilities for
external commerce, and a* the public welfare is the

. The letters are the more important because there
is an increasing need of a better understanding be
tween ourselves and the Mexican people. Mere works
of tourist travel full of picturesque descriptions will
avail nothing, and volumes of criticism upon the
shortcomings of Mexico arc worth less than nothing;
but such studies as these letters show Mr. Wilkins to
be able to make would be highly beneficial. Their
very friendliness would help to win us the favor of
the Mexican people and do much to promote trade,
travel and all forms of intercourse between ourselves
and our neighbors. The Tfrarin County Tocsin Press
is to be congratulated upon giving to the State a
book which though slight in form is by no means
slight in interest or in value.
Mr. Wilkins did not go to Mexico to find fault with
everything that is different from our own customs,
manners and civilization. lie went as an impartial
student of the country and its people, and soon be
came a sympathetic as well as an intelligent observer.
The consequence is that we have in the letters as
accurate and as instructive a summary of life and
labor in Mexico as cculd be expected from a work
written in such a casual way and designed only for
newspaper reading. Indeed, the letters are so excel
lent in many ways it is something of a matter for
regret that they "have been published in the book
form exactly as sent to the Tocsin instead of being
extended and elaborated by the author.
DURING a vacation of six weeks spent in the
mountains of Mexico, James H. Wilkins,
editor of the Marin County Tocsin, contrib
uted to his paper a scries of letters descriptive of what
he saw there, and giving his impressions of the char
acter and conditions of the people and the prospects
of the mining industry. The letters collected
and published in book form by the members of the
Tocsin staff during the absence of the 1 editor, and the
work constitutes a really valuable contribution to
our knowledge of the affairs of our southern neighbor.

Senator Platt has announced his intention to re

The 'volume of business throughout the country, as
reflected by the weekly bank clearings, was 59.5 per
rent larger last week than during the same week in
1900. AH the large cities except Minneapolis and St.
Paul showed a gain. The failures were 188, against
167 for the same week last year.
Our local markets show no changes worthy of note.
Business is reported good in almost all lines, and
there ate no failures of sufficient sue. to cause com
tnenL Crop prospects continue good and collections
Â¦re normal.
The feeling in Wall street has been quieter and
easier during the past week. Prospects for another
great railroad deal arc apparently dwindling away,
and the public see no particular inducement to re-enter
the market at present. There has been no liquidation,
however. The July interest and dividend payments
are expected to be larger than ever before, and as
money even now is easy, no stringency in funds is
exprcted. The impression is that times in the street
* ill be quiet for some weeks to come.
V:\Vheat seem* to be the only laggard in the proces
sion of prosperity. Continued brilliant crop pros
pects have resulted in a shrinkage from the advance
noted several weeks ago. and for some days the
tendency in prices has been downward. But some
foreign countries are reporting a poorer crop out
look, notably France, which is coming forward as
a very heavy purchaser, the prospects there being de
cidedly unfavorable. At the same time, however, the
exports of wheat from the United States are ahead of
those for the corresponding period last year. The
minor grains, on the contrary, are ruling firmer, with
better prices for corn and oats. Operators on the
Chicago Board of Trade are advising their customers
all over the country that they see no present reason
to expect a bull market, nor, in view of the needs of
France, do they look for any pronounced decline.
The iron trade keep* up its record and. like the
boot and sho? business, reports !ar;tc shipments and
plenty of orders ahead, though new orders for for
ward delivery are falling off somewhat. Building
hardware is reported in enormous demand all over
the country. r.nd naiU and wire arc scarce in first
hands. The labor situation, too. seems to be slowly
improvinc from -.\ec!< to week; very little is heard
row of new strikes, and those already on are being
steadily settled, to the gratification of all classes.
The staple* e <pecialiy seem to be in particularly
good condition. Even cotton, which has lagged so
Ion?, is reported improving, and the demand for
woolen good* iÂ» better than for some months. Ship
ments of boots and shoes from Boston continue far in
excess of former years, though the output of the
factories ha- fallen off somewhat and new orders are
afso fewer. Fall orders are especially quieter. Leather
is less in demand, owir.p to the decreased orders of the
factories, but heavy stock continues firm, owing to
light nxpplies. Hides arc firm everywhere, and are
quoted higher at Eastern markets. Clothing manu
facturer- report a good business and express confi
dence as to the tuturc In addition to the firmness in
the above important staples a number of advances
are reported in groceries and provisions.
AS yet the usual mid-ummcr lull in trade has
not appeared. The distributive business of the
country, on the contrary, actually shows an
increase, particular'}- in the Northwest, while all over
the land both \vho!e>aierÂ» and jobbers report an active
demand for goods. The railroad lines are said to
be transporting more of the higher class of merchan
dise, commonly known as luxuries, than ever before;
and all branche* of trade are sustained, while not a
few show an improvement. In this respect 1901 re

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The geologists say, that the lavas which
fill the ancient basin of the park at this
place rests upon the flank* of mountains
formed of fragmentary volcanic ejecta.
Gaseous emanations arc given out In great
volume. Theje come, the scientists say,
from deposits of altered and crystalline
travertine mix**] with pools In the creek.
Above those deposits the creek cuts into a
bank of sulphur. In the bottom of the
gully is a small stream sour with sul
phuric acid.
No wonder the poor animal* seeking
shelter In the gulch meet death there.
What Impressed the visitors most out
side of tho horror of the gulch was the
danger to visitors who might uncon
sciously enter the eulch. There was no
difference In the appearance of the gulch
from other gulches above and below the
mountains, and there was nothing to
warn a camper. For man to enter death
gulch to camp means that he has camped
In eternity.
For ages this death trap in the Rocky
Mountains has probably been luring the
inhabitants of the forest to their doom.
With the rains of spring the bones of the
dead of the preceding year are carried
down to tho creek and the gulch cleared
for the death harvest of the summer and
the winter.
The two men didn't dare to go Into the
ravine. What exploration they made re
sulted In headaches which stayed with
them for hours and pains in the throat
and lungs, which did not subside for a
long time.
The bed of the gulch and ravine was
littered with the bones and skins of ani
mals long since dead. They found twenty
three carcasses of bears, one big cinna
mon having his nose between his paws
just as if he had fallen asleep.
they had difficulty In breathing, yet they
entered at the end where the gulch is
practically open. They lit a wax taper
and found that when placed more than
forty Inches from the ground it was ex
tinguished. This proved tho existence of
carbon dioxide gas.

PERSONAL MENTION.
IN the northeant corner of the Yellow
stone National Park, in Wyoming. Is
a ravine which Is fully entitled to its
irrcwBome name â Death Oulch. It Is a
V-shaped trench, cut in the mountain
side, and begins about 230 feet above
Cache Creek. Apparently It forms a nat
ural shelter for the beasts of the forest,
as food, water and shelter are there, but
entrance to the gulch means death to any
animal, for the poisonous vapors that rlÂ«e
out of the ravine are more deadly than
the bullets of the huntsmen, says the)
Laramle (Wyo.) correspondent of the New
York Press.
Various expeditions under the direction
of the United 8tates Geological Survey
have reported as to the characteristics of
Death Gulch, the last being by Harvey \V.
Weed. He eald that he had tested the
hollows in the gulch for carbonic acid gas
without proving its presence. The atmos
phere In the gulch, however, was oppres
sive. There was a strong smell of sul
phur and ho suffered from a choking
sensation, although a. strong wind pre
vailed at the time. At tho bottom of the
gulch were the carcasses of many ani
mals, some of which hr.d met death but a
short time before. Theso carcasses wore
of bear, elk, hares, Kqulrrcla, etc. Mr.
Weert exrÂ»mlnÂ«".l the body of a grizzly
which evidently had died but a day be
fore, as Its tracks were quite distinct and
the carcass perfectly freah. There was
some blood under tho nose. Nothing
more.
Later on Charles IS. Oeorgo and a Mr.
Everett of Boston vlftlted the gulch and
made an extended examination. They de
clare the gulch Is a death trap which
while different In many ways from the
famous Death Valley of Jnva Is as cer
tain In Its effect. At one end the gulch
is comparatively open and the wind
sweeps through, but at tho other, where
it forms a ravine, the gases, accumulate
and asphyxlato all animals that come
within the walls of the, rock. When Mr.
George and Mr. Everett entered tho gulch
tho gaseous fumes were so oppressive that

As Mr. McAdie has pointed out, the new system
of telegraphy promises jto be of exceptional advant
age to San Francisco by reason of the prevalence of
fogs. "Very often," he says, "a vessel arrives in a
dense fog and cannot be seen by the lookouts at Point
Reyes or Point Lobos. Wireless telegraphy would
solvAhat problem. Vessels equipped with the instru
mentsVould report in to the Farallones when they
were many miles out at sea, and if aid was wanted
in case of accident word could be sent to the city at
once for tugs. It requires no stretch of the imagina
tion to picture the many advantages that will follow
the installation of wireless telegraphy here."
It is hardly necessary to add further arguments
upon the feasibility and the utility of the new system.
Those who were incredulous a year ago are now fully
convinced of the merits of Marconi's great invention.
Even the yellowest of journals will never again call
him "Macaroni" for the purpose of discrediting the
enterprise of The Call. We have now a promise of
the permanent establishment of a wireless news serv
ice between this city and the Faraltoncs. The local
weather bureau officer shows an earnest zeal to
promptly provide it. He should have every assistance
and support the public can give hinK The movement
has been well started. Let us sec that it keep mov
ing until the end is attained.
In fact the first experiment made by The Call in
obtaining an announcement of the approach of the
Sherman proved the availability of the Marconi sys
tem for practical use in the transmission of news.
Since that time it has come into such general use
that the great steamship companies arc equipping
their Atlantic liners with the apparatus, and all along
the stormy European coast France, Holland and
Germany have established stations cither upon land
or upon lightships, end their value has been again
and again proven even during the comparatively short
time they have been in operation.
It is to be boruc in mind that this is not a case in
which the Government will have to expend time or
money in making experiments. Wireless telegraphy
is < now in use by the British Government not only
at the ports of the home islands, but at the principal
ports of the wide extended empire in all parts of the
globe. So extensive have been installations of the
wireless system that when the Duke and the Duchess
of Cornwall set forth on their tour of the empire it
was found worth while to equip the royal vessel, the
Ophir, with an apparatus for wireless telegraphing;
so that as it approached any of the great harbors of
the empire messages might be sent and received'
while <he ship was still far out at sea.
MR. McADIE, of the local weather bureau, in
commenting upon the dispatch from Wash
ington announcing that Secretary Wilson will
authorize the Weather Bureau to install a wireless
telegraph service at the Farallones "as soon as there
is any system suitable for installation," announced
that he intends to go East this summer for the pur
pose of studying the system which the New York
Herald has established at Nantuckct. The statement
is gratifying. It is an evidence that the officials of
the weather bureau arc not going to sit down and
wait for somebody to bring a system to them. Mr.
McAdie is going forth at once to find the system
that will be suitable for installation, and there is
every reason to believe the search will be immediately
successful.
A BENEFIT TO ALL.
We may bclievx: that the law should deal more
sternly with that erotic insanity which causes so many
of these murders. When a man threatens to kill a
woman for non-subjugation to his will in anything,
if she cannot get the drop on him a male relative
should be called in with a gun. Such threats almost
always end in the murder of the woman, and yet if a
man is arrested for making them it is treated rather
as a laughing matter ihan as a most serious peril for
the threatened woman.
Ages of civilization seem to have merely hidden
the barbarian under the skin of the race. Perhaps
worse may be said, but the barbarous ages hardly
equaled this in this kind of crime.
On the murder side of the docket appear a very
few murders of men by women. Mrs. Kennedy has
just been convicted of shooting her husband to death
in Kansas City. The jury had no compunctions about
convicting her, but about the same time Dr. Kennedy
escaped conviction in New York City for the killing
of Dollie Reynolds, so that the Kennedy luck is a
tie, the woman getting the worst of it. There are
occasional variations. One young man in Pennsyl
vania was murdered by a rival and left on the door
step of the young lady.
Then there are other crimes of which women are
the victims that arc not adequately punished. A
jury in this city has recently failed to convict the de
ceiver who entrapped Norine Schneider into a mar
riage by forging a telegram from her mother, though
he boasted in his testimony of deceiving a Canadian
lady into a mock marriage, and explained gleefully
and in detail his despicable crime.
To enlist in matrimony is getting to be as danger
ous as to go abroad as a Red Cross nurse to work
in a yellow fever hospital.
The same caterers to polite curiosity in reporting
weddings may yet have to describe the^bride's dress
as made of beautiful, polished bullet-proof moire an
tique steel, cut low, revealing a chemise of mail, of
a beautiful fishbone lace pattern, fastened with gold
wire. The groom may yet be referred to as armed
to the teeth, with a cartridge belt under his Prince
Albert coat and a bowie-knife in his right hand.
If this special class of bloodshcdding continues we
may expect the society reporter to say that when the
beautiful ami charming favorite of the exclusive set,
whose engagement is announced, received the pro
posal of the happy party of the second part, she was
guarded by three policemen in plain clothes, while
her father stood guard in the cupboard, armed with
a sawed-off- shotgun filled with slugs to the muzzle,
lest the candidate for his daughter's hand should be
seized with a desire to cut her throat.
Hard times usually promote crime. They furnish
the pretext of despair, of hard drink and other ex
cuses which weak humanity gives for its offenses. But
the murders of women during the last twelve months
are not traceable to hard times, for the. times have
been cood.
During the past year murders of this kind have
outnumbered any other special class of homicides.
Women have been the victims of more fatal attacks
from those to whom normally they should look first
for kindness and defense than in any similar period
of time in the past.
Young men are killing maidens to whom they arc
engaged for the offci'.sc of speaking, more or less
kindly, to other young men.. In other cases mur
der is committed because the girl declines the at
tentions of the murderer, preferring another. Thc^,
procession is plentifully sprinkled with husbands who
kill their wives, after married life together ranging
from a few months to past the silver wedding. Some
times, and not infrequently, such murderers kill their
whole family, including father-in-law and mother-in
law, and usually end where they should have begun,
by killing themselves.
THE country is in another epidemic of the mur
der of women by men, for various alleged causes,
principally erotic.
MURDER RAMPANT.
The battle of the boilers In the British
navy promises to be protracted, and It is
believed in some quarters that the old
style cylindrical boiler will again be
adopted. The chief needs of a naval boil
er are reliability and ability to raise steam
quickly. The first qualification is met In
the cylindrical boiler, and the second
requisite. It Is claimed, can be obtained
by the application of the Howden system
of forced draught. The Belleville boiler
will raise uteam quickly, but Is unreliable,
and the* same is said to be the case with
all other water-tube boilers. The How
den system Is used to the extent of 3,500,000
horsepower in trans-Atlantic steamers,
and it is argued that the system which
proves efficient In the mercantile marine
should be adopted for navy vessels. It Is
Interesting to notice that England Is the
only naval power which, shows so singu
lar a reluctance to depart from old usages,
while all other navies are progressive and
meet with good results, and the conclu
sions to be drawn irom this condition of
affairs In that British box bolterma&era
are aided by the inability of British en
gineers and stokers to adapt themselves
to new conditions. â¢
Rear Admiral C. C. P. Fitzgerald of the
British navy advocates fast scouts as
greatly needed in the navy, and Philip
Watts, constructor at the Els wick yard,
has prepared designs for such a vessel,
embodying the Ideas of the admiral. It Is
of 3900 tons displacement, with a normal
supply of SCO tons of coal. 400 feet in
length. 44 feet beam and 14 feet draught.
The twin-screw engines are of 16.000 horse
power, calculated to give a trial speed of
SS knots and a sustained sea speed of 23
knots. The vessel will have a protective
deck two Inches thick, and the gun posi
tions are to be protected by four-Inch
armor. The battery consists of sbc four-
Inch quick-firers and a dozen machine
guns, and the coal capacity Is 1C00 tons.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Two armored cruisers. Orlando and Nar
cissus, have been assigned as cruising
gunnery vessels. They have the regula
tion allowance of officers and crew on
deck and In the hold, except on the Nar
cissus, where there Is not a single en
gineer officer. This singular omission
would indicate that Great Britain is about
to try the experiment of the United States
navy to leave the engine department in
charge of warrant machinists, which does
not appear to have resulted disastrously
thus far after nearly two years' experi
ence in our nary.
The first torpedo-boat was the Rasp,
built In 1S73 by Thornycroft for the Nor
wegian navy. She is still In existence and
Is of 18 tons displacement, S3 feet in
length. 7 feet 6 Inches beam and 3 feet 11
inches draught, and had a trial speed of
IS knots. The horsepower was about 300.
From this small beginning the modern
and latest torpedo-boat destroyer has
been developed In the Viper, a vessel of
312 tons displacement, engines of 10.000
horsepower and a speed of 35 knots.
The Czar has Issued a ukase upon the
advice of the Minister of Marine directing
that hereafter all naval ships are to be
built of material of Russian manufacture.
No foreign firms will receive contracts
without this stipulation, which practically
shuts out competition of shipyards outside
of Russia and will necessitate building the
ships at home. The Engineering doubts
whether the present state of Russian
manufactures will make the Emperor's
plans feasible.
â¢ â¢ â¢
At the recent target practice at Bermu
da against the old ironclad Scorpion twen
ty lyddite shells were flred from the Cres
cent's 9.2-inch guns. Only three shots hit
the ship, and the idea of the terribly de
structive effects of lyddite appears to
have been somewhat exaggerated, as one
shell was supposed to have been sufficient
to destroy the ehlp, whereas the old Scor
pion was still afloat when the firing
ceased. '
â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
Japan Is getting ready to build a factory
for armor and other shipbuilding material
at Kure, and 13,780,000 was included In the
navy vote for 1301-2 for that purpose. ThÂ«
Minister of Marine pointed out that there
would be a clear saving of $1,000,000 In the
cost of building and bringing out a ship
like the Shikishlma from England If Ja
pan could produce her own armor and oth
er ship material and build Its ships at
home.
The German naval maneuvers shortly to
take place In the North Sea will be on the
largest scale yet attempted. There will
be forty-four vessels In all, consisting of
fourteen battleships, three armored and
several cruisers and two torpedo flotillas
of destroyers, division-boats and torpedo
boats. Admiral von Koster will be in chief
command and Prince Henry of Prussia
will be In charge of one division.

"The Dole faction hoped to perpetuate
urxier the Territory the conditions which
*Â»xfpted during the Republic, and their ln
Â¦toUirjr to do so has led to the friction
v.-hich exists between the executive
branch. In which the faction is supreme.
*Â»n th* one hand, and the legislative and
Judicial branches on the othÂ»>r. ThÂ«*y have
rr>E*1e war ur>^n the Legislature and the
Judiciary simply because they cannot con
trol them, and they seek to compass the
ruin of any man who stands opposed to
tbelr ideas of civic duty.
If the fuhi*Â»cts of controversy were put
la v<->re SÂ».' per cent of the people would
liohold the I>egislature and the Judiciary.

Humphreys does not hesitate to express
lsis Â«>;Â»inlon of (.overnor I>ole and his fac

of the Gorernor'a clique, and he si>eaks
his rr.lr.i! nbout the "ollsrarchy" with a blt

cif his Southern blood. He is a small man
of wiry ligure and well chiseled features.
Who avidently knows his own mind and

in Honolulu rive year? and is very caretul
t.Â» call himself a Hawaiian. It has been
1*-q years since he was in San Francisco.
* What Is the popular feeling toward

of him.
*'it 1p one of Reneral satisfaction." re
t>H<Â»d Judcf Humphreys, "that the repub

ing. Tho following scores were made:
The monthly shoot of the Empire Gun
Club at Alametfa Point yesterday brought
cut a fair attendance of club members
and visiting sportsmen. The day being a
perfect one 'nsofar as flying target
shooting was concerned some excellent
scores resulted. The principal events
were the Allen hnndlcnp gun shoot and
the 8weeney record medal shoot. For the
former C. W. DrbÂ«nham made the l.est
score for the dcy, with fifteen breaks out
of a possible twenty, shot In five palm of
doubles from the eighteen-yard mark, be
ing distance handicapped to that- station.
W. O. Cullen *pt a new mark for the
Sweeney record medal by scoring twenty
five without :i miss. This was the highest
score In this event for the day and also
for the season, nnd considering the con
ditions under which this medal Is shot for
Is certainly a remarkable performance.
In this match for each five birds broken
the shooter Is handicapped two yards un
til the twenty-yard mark Is reached, when
doubles must be shot, and for each five
pair broken the shooter Is again com
pelled to go buck two yards. Cullen broke
five birds from the sixteen-yard mark and

EMPIRE GUN CLUB
BREAKS BLT/EBOCKS
Pine Scores Made nt the Monthly
the deciding course by a score of 7 to 1.
Alto's victory was not unlooked for. In
the over night odds the great flyer wai
held choice for the stake at o to 1. D. T.
Healey's Slsquoc was next in favor at
about the same odds and the prediction
that the latter dog would contest with
Palo Alto for final honors, and Incident
ally take second place, eras a general one.
Cronin's hound let the wise ones know
that something was doing when it made
a short undecided of the course with the
Petaluma aspirant and then. In return
for their lack of faith, sent Sisquoc to its
kennel a beaten dog and without a point
at that. Vandal's backers got 7 to 1 for
their money.
No one looked for Vandal to increase its
standing in the stake after that and there
was no disappointment when it failed to
do so.
Agamemnon furnished a surprise by re
tiring- Wedgewood in the second round.
War Kagle. the choice at 5 to 1. went
out to Talk to Me. in a course that brought
the dogs around the lot after a phantcm
jack.
Little Sister ran like a champion. It
beat Homer Boy in a close course. Sis
ter led and took the turn and the Boy
scored the kill. Both dogs were heavily
backed. Sister finally lost to Palo Alto.
John Doe was a 24 to 1 choice over Me-
Kinley. but the old courser showed that
on a wild hare It was in its element and
won out by a score of 13 to 11. Ireland
went against a pesky rabbit that could
travel a bit. too. and 'when the judge's
flag went up It told that Real Article, on
the short end at 2 to 5. had beaten Geary's
dog In a course where the score figured
large.
Flying Fox ran well and destroyed Har
lean Gladys' chances for final honor?,
though the talent bet 5 to 3 the other way.
Following are the day's results, with
Judge John Grace's official scores:

\V. G. Morrow and W. M. Edgell cruised
up to tho navy yard In the yawl Roynl
which seemed to do good work under a
single jib. mainsail and driver.
In addition to the yachts already named,
the following were under way yesterdav
The schooner Lurllnc. Chlapa and Wave'
the yawls Naiad and Spray, the sloopa
Ariel,.* Flirt. Surprise, Clara. Siren.
Mlgnon. Aeolus. Freda. Speedwell, Bolle.
Thetis. Mischief. Oenesta. Tigress. Sap
pho and Presto. The yachts Chlspa end
Royal were towed out of the straits to
Bausallto. nnd tho yachts Harpoon. Freda
and several other Corinthian craft ac
cepted the aid of launches. The auxtllarv
yawl Naiad, while towlngNhe sloop I la r
poon, ran aground on a point near tbe
Tiburon ferry slip, but both were towed
oft by a launch. The tide served poorly
for the programmed cruise, as It was eb
bing on Saturday night, and flooding nil
yesterday afternoon. A craft that at
tracted the attention of the yachtsmen
was the curious boat with a lateen sail
a jib fore and aft, and an outrigger but
there was not much opportunity to ob
serve her qualities as a weatherly vessel
as the breoKe was very light nnd tho
water unusually smooth.
Rarely has a. prettier sight been seen
on the bay than yesterday afternoon off
Paradise Cove and California City, when
a large portion of tho fleets of the S;:n
Francisco and Corinthian Yacht clubs
were trying to get Into Raccoon Straits
on their way home from various points In
the upper bay. The wind was light, hard
ly atrong enough to enable the boats to
stem the Incoming tide, and several times
threo or more yachts were so close to
gether that a man could have stepped
from one to the other with ease. All the
three clubs had a cruise to Vallejo sched
uled for Saturday, but. owing to the lack
of a favorable tide, several did not make
the rendezvous. Commodore W. N. Mc-
Carthy's schooner Ramona anchored In
Paradise Cove, while the yawl Phyllis and
the sloops Mny-and Cygnus got up as far
as McNears Landing. The sloop Harpoon
anchored at some distance from shore oft
McNenrn. Commodore H. D. Hawks car
ried his -flag on the sloop Nixie, which
with topsail set, made wonderful head
way.

Grreorlo did not gain anythlnR by his
rush inshoro and Bengen boat him nearly
two minutes over the first leg of the
course. From that on Sennett was out
called, but the other two made a very
pretty race of It. Oregorlo's bout was the
ranter, but Benges handled his like a past
master and trained a Â©oat length every
tlmo he tacked. He wan. first around the
Fort Point buoy by five minutes and all
Gregorlo could do was to cut a minute
and a half off his lead at the finish.
The race was originally fixed for the
large boat*, but the owners backed out.
Then the crab fishermen took It up and
arranged for an eight-boat nweepstake.
Then it came out that three of the owners
had secured boatmen to sail their boats
and four of the men withdrew. Gresrorio
stayed with the match, however, and won
second nrlre.

J. V. Coleman shot at the traps yester
day and the best accredited to him was
12 in the club race and 6 in the back score
shoot. .
A poor attendance and scores that were
scarcely up to the average marked tho
regular monthly shoot of the San Fran
cisco Gun Club yesterday at InplenMe. A
preat number of the trap shooters havo
deserted the traps for tho rod and reel.
The indifferent scores wero principally
due to the birds, many of which were
"setters." which, when turned loose from
the traps, refuse to fly. but commence to
investigate the turf for something to eat.
By the time they do condescend to take
flight the trap shooter han become so
nervous and impatient that a miss is gen
erally registered against him.

The scores were as follows
The marksmen were present in large
numbers at the Shell Mound ranges yes
terday and good scores were the order
of the day. The international shooting
festival is only a few weeks distant and
local interest runs high. All of the oid
timers are In good form and many of the
ydunger marksmen are looked upon as
likely to win some of the best prizes.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein
made more bullseyeÂ« yesterday than on

other club? present were the Golden Gate
Rifle and Pistol Club. Germania Schuot

and the Xorddeut?cher Schuetzen Club.
more than a record he established la^t
month. Gorman is but a novice with the
small arm and his feats are attracting
general attention among the crack shots
of the country. He also holds the recori
for a string of 100 shots. His remarka
ble shooting was done in the presence of
club officials and other witnesses and will,
when properly authenticated, undoubted

OAKLAND. June 23.â Although there
are suspicious circumstances surround
ing the death of Edward Slattery. the dis
charged soldier, who was shot through
the head last night io a room at the Ave
nue House, 123 San Pablo avenue, the police
are satisfied that the deed was that of a
suicide and that the dead ex-volunteer's
companion, John C. Daley, had no hand in
the killing. Daley was detained at the
City Prison in order that the detectives
nnd Coroner might have ample opportu
nity to complete their Investigations he
fore ginnery's friend could pet away.
Thy story as it unfolded to-day re
vealed the wild debauch of two boon com
panions celebrating their ditcharR^ from
the army after nearly two years cf hard
pervlcc together with the Forty-sixth
Reulment in the Philippines. Slattery.
known in Company G a? Edwin Kelley.
was mustered cut with S277. Daley left
the camp with $293. Three weeks of reck
less fioetiom and their total assnts were
the $3 or J4 that the Coroner found in
Slatteiy's pookets last night. Daley haU
not a penny.
In his cell at the City Prison to-day the
dead soldUr's chum sat in p h=ilf-stupor,
with his nerves racked by the hnrrl pace
he had been going. There was nothing to
Kive a suspicion that he had taken his
army comrade's life. Indeed, tt was man
ifest his mind was clouded and rodden
from drink, nnd with difficulty could he
collect his bewildered thoughts long
enough to reply coherently to his inter
viewer's queries. But after all h's nar
rative hung in the main facts to the story
he told the detectives last night when he
was under the influence of liquor.
Daley's statement that he went out
after the shooting to get assistance is cor
roborated by Mrs. Denlson. proprietress of
the Iodging-hou5e.
Indications Are That Edward Slat
tery Killed Himself and That
Daley Is Innocent.

The murderer recovered early to-day
from the wound that prevented him from
killing the fifth Chinese and this evening
Is being brought to Westminster.
Little is known, so far. of the cause of
the crime. There appears to have been
a standing grievance between the mur
derer and the flve men he sought to Kill,
the trouble having occurred over a Chi
nesÂ© woman who recently arrived there.
The scene that met the gaze of the police
officers who made the first investigation
was a frightful one. There was blood and
torn clothing strewn all over the floor.'
from one end of the little room to the
other. One Chinese was dead and three
will die.
The first Chinese was killed before the
others were awakened, i The cries of the
second awakened two others, and in the
darkness they attempted a rescue. These
three men -were cut by the ax-wielder, and
are so badly injured that they will all die.
The fifth man succeded in stopping the
murderer before further damage was
done, although even he was seriously In
jured. . After a struggle he knocked down
the murderer with a board. Then- the
fifth man himself collapsed and the six
were found lying in pools of blood early
this morning by other Chinese who hap
pened to paps that way.
â¢VANCOUVER, B. C. June 23.-A series
of atrocious murders occurred to-day at
Ladner, a village at the -mouth of the
Fraser River, opposite Steveston, about
twenty miles from Vancouver. All the de
tails that could be learned to-night were
that a Chinese had entered a shack in
which flve Chinese laborers ' were lying
asleep. Without making any noise to
awaken the sleeping men tho murderer at
tacked first one and then another with an
ax.

late capitalist. Judge Hyland yester
day granted the motion for a nonsuit
made by Attorney Delmas last Thursday,
and which has be'-n argued by the attor
neys on both sldrs for the past two days.
Attorney Kowalsky took an exception to
the order of the court.
In granting the nonsuit Judge Hyland
paid no written contract in which Murphy
had agreed to pay Ml** Smalley for her
services had been proven. Such contract
as was made was simply one of honor and
reettd solely on the conscience of the ono
who made it. The court could not take
notice of th<? relations of the plaintiff and
defendant. â¢ - - .
Miss Rmalley was Murphy's companion

; Scandinavian Societies of San Frar.-
Cisco and Vicinity Unite in
Festivity.
Amid the noise of fireworks, stirring pa
i triotlc speeches, dancing, games and
I races. "Midsummer Day" was celebrated
1 yesterday by the many Scandinavian so
' cieties of San Francisco and vicinity at
; Shell Mound Park.
In celebrating this dayâ a national holi
; day â the members of the societies fol
i lowed out an old-time custom long In
vogue in their fatherland. This being the
i longest day in the year, business of all
I kinds Is suspended and the populace cele
brates.
A special feature of the decorations, and
: one causing considerable comment, was
â¢ the prettily arranged shields hung In the
Â¦ pavilion, gracefully entwined with ever
greens and representing each provlnco of
: Sweden.
The programme for the day consisted of
Maypole dances, races and dancing In the
1 large pavilion.
At 7:15 the evening's programme opened
with literary exercises on an especially
built grand stand In the race track of the
1 park. The programme consisted of intro
1 ductory remarks by Emil Hogberg. presl
i dent of the Swedish-American Patriotic
1 League; a potpourri of Swedish melodies
; by the orchestra, an able and well dellv
' *red oration by Alex Olsson. editor and
: publisher of Vesthusten, a Swedish pub
, iication of this city, and a number of de
. Jightful selections by the Swedish singing
! society.
Immediately after the literary exercises
; a torchlight parade was formed and. with
j the accompaniment of bursting fireworks.
' it moved on to the large pax'illon. v/here a
' number of pretty tableaux were. Klvon.
Many guest.- of honor were entertained
1 by the different committees, the most
: prominent being Hon. Henry Lund. Consul
i of Sweden and Norway.

The attitude of Germany with respect to
an isthmian rar.xl has been the source of
considerable speculation to the Central
and South American stales, and aocoid
ing to the South .American envoys here
who discussed the matter their repre
sentatives in Berlin dtemed it advlsaole
to obtain a statement in regard to the
policy the German Government proposes
to observe. lit conversations which oc
curred between Baron von Bulow. the
German Minister for Forelpn Affairs, and
the Pan-Americnn diplomats he Is said to
have stated that Germany, recognized the
existence and understood the extent of
the application of the Monroe doctrine,
and that she h^s no Intention of hlmler-
Injt ihe construction of the canal by the
I'nlted State*. A report was current
among the Pan-Americin diplomats here
several months ago thnt Germany would
join with Great Britain in demanding: the
neutrality of the canal, hut there Is no
likelihood of nny representations being
necessary, as the new treaty In course of
negotiation specifically provides that the
canal shall be neutral, and the United
States formally guarantees the observance
cf this principle.
While Germany by the action of her
representatives In signing The Hague ar
bitration treaty took note of the declara
tion of the United States in regard to thp
Monroe doctrine, there has been consid
erable comment as to Just how she re
gards that- principle. The statements
made to the Pan-American diplomats are
of considerable interest to the State De
partment officials. They are confident thnt
:he position attained by the United States
in the affairs of the world has had some
thing to do with Germany's attitude.
M. Hutln. president of the Panama
fanal Company, is now in France en
deavoring to draw up a statement of the
conditions upon which the company will
part with its canal interests to tne I nited
States. It is said that many of the stock
holders desire that some plan shall be
adopted which will enable them to re
tain an interest in the canal, but this.
*.;f course, would not be acceptable to the
United States.

Everytntaj: was Â«iuiet at the headquar
ters of the striking machinists. When the
returnn of" the ba!l giver, by the Brother
hood of Teamster? at the Mechanics" Pa
vilion on Saturday night are all in, some
J4*Â» or SSOOu will be realized. This will
Â«-na.bIe the machinists and other iron
Â¦workers to tide over a week or two longer.
It is estimated that the loss in wages dur
ing thÂ« five weeks the men have been out
will approximate S500.0M at the lowest cal
culation. The loss of the corporations and
firms conducting the iron industries can
b* figured, considering loss of profits, the
driving away of trade to other cities and
less of Interest on plants, at more than
double that amount.
With the opening of th* fifth week of
th* strike no appreciable change In the
Fituatlor. Is noticeable. The strikers, while
hopeful, have had no definite overtures
from their former employer?, ani have
fttled down with a grim determination
ti wait for the turn in the tide they con-
Bdeatly exi*ect.
Candidates for tor.sorial diploma* are
expected to present themselves this morn-
Irr before the Barber Commission in the
Kraraa Spreckels building. Those who are
row In business will have to be registered
and pay $1. after making affidavit before
a notary as to their qualifications. I'n
rrled barbers, graduates of barber col
!Â»?Â»Â» and other* who aspire to the dearee
nt "tos*ortal artist" will be compelled to
pay $5. The ttsree and the diploma to
n* awarded by the commissioners will en
fh> them to practice in any parr of the
f *a?e.
':'Â¦ A distinction between the wholesaler,
the jobber and the retailer is strictly main
tained. The jobber occupies the position
vt middleman and supplies the larper res
taurants. It is said that from the Res
taurant Keepers" Association the order
; has come to the jobber to withhold sup
plies. In the rneanxchile the retailers will
continue to supply meat to all restaurants
fo ions as the proprietor? are in a condi
tion to meet tneir financial responsibili
ties. No action will be taken until the next
meeting of the association, which will be
held next Thursday night at the same
piace.
The striking journeymen butchers who
have not yet reiurned to their old places
met at the Turk Street Temple in order so
preserve intact their organization. Many
of them claim they have been blacklisted
en account of their active participation in
what they now name "an unfortunate and
calamitous strike."
At th<* headquarters of the Cooks' and
Â¦Walters" Alliance pickets reported that
tfcey had heard from the proprietors of
the union houses that theSr meat
supply would be cut off in the event
cf their not agreeing to the demands of
the jobbers. This matter was a subject
of great concern to the executive commit
tee. If decisive action should be taken to
day the San Francisco Labor Council will
TrÂ« called in, special session to-morrow
flight.
Distinction Is Maintained.

An Interesting controversy Is Roing on
betwetn the union restaurant keepers and
the meat jobbers which may resuU in the
closing of a number of union restaurants
tOMiay, througrh the inability of some of
them to secure necessary supplies. The
matter is that of the demand of jobbers
t!Â»at union restaurants cease displaying
the union card. The action to be taken
Â¦ concern* only the jobber* so far, leaving
the vt'ho!Â«sa!e and retail dealers out of the
controversy. Perhaps they may be drawn
into It In a few days.
About 30 of the members of the Retail
Boas Butchers* Association m*t yesterday
afternoon at B'nai B'rith Hall and dis
cussed the situation. While to no one au- ;
thorlzed to speak could be traced the or
lptn of the report, it was generally un
derstood that some such action would be
taken to-day. The retail boss butchers
decided, according to President Flageollet
and Secretary Larney. to await further
action before xakinc sides in the contro
versy. . -

There are several departments of thÂ»
city and county government thnt use
forage, and forage, bids are opened by
different committee*. The Health and
Hospital Committee nns recommended re
jecting all bids for forÂ«KÂ« for the City and
County Hospital, the rm*rgoncy Hospital
and the Alrnshotise. This committee has
to provide for supplying also thÂ« county
iaUÂ« and the insnne ward of the Health
Jepartment and the Coroner. The lowest
bidder to supply wheat hiy before ihls
committee was Scott A Mngner. whouc
prlcÂ« wos $12 71 per ton. There was only
one bidder for supplyinK the Alm*hou*r>
with mixed wheat nnd ont hay. Scntt &
Magner. the price being $12 73. There was
also only one bid for the Emergency
Hosnltnl hny contract. Peters & Cowl#\
at $13 95.
No awards of contracts have yet been
made by the Supervisors for fornjee and
the whole responsibility still remain* for
tho hoard to fnc*. ,
It may bo thatAhe Police Committee re
port may be held^ut to-day, but It is due.
the committee having voted on the mat
ter. Since The Call began to make an ex
pose of the forage bids for supplying the
city ar.d county there has been much ex
citement among the dealers, who have
been expecting to Ret larger prices from
the municipality than any one else would
pay. Hay in the open murket Is worth $2
Jean iwr ton to private bidders than th*Â»
lowest bid bcforÂ« the Fire Commissioners.
Oats can be purchased for SI 15 per 100
pounds, a difference of $4 f7 per ton as
compared with the price to the Fire Com
missioners and a larger difference of J6 SO
per ton. aÂ» compared with the bid which
theÂ«Pollco Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has recommended for accept
ance.
Dealers Are Excited.
The Board of Supervisors will also re
ceive a report from the Police Committee
of the board, recommending the award of
the contract for supplying oats for the
use of the Police Department at the rate
of $1 49 per 100 pounds, to D. Keefe. Satur
day morning the Fire Commissioners
agreed to let the contract for supplying
oats to the Fire Department to Simon
Erlanger for $1 3674 per 100 pounds. Sub
sequently the Fire Commissioners were
informed that the price was far above
the open market price and Commissioner
Rolla V. Watt says that If the award can
be legally set aside the Fire Commission
ers may take that course to-day. The
lowest hid offered to the Police Committee
of the Board of Supervisors, it will b& ob
served, Is 11>*_ cents higher per 100 pounds
than that of Erlanger to the Fire Depart
ment, or $2 22 per ton of 2000 pounds. The
Fire Commissioners demand the first
quality of white oats, the highest priced in
the market, and there Is no question or
quibble to be raised successfully, there
fore, as to whether the bids for the Police
Department supplies call for better goods.
The issue is fairly before the Board of
Supervisors as to their policy in the mat
ter of oats, also. .
Report Is Due.
The Board of Supervisors may have a
chance to-day to say whether they will
sanction paying n higher price for hay for
the use of a city department than private
persona, buying: in much Bmaller quantities
than the city, find open to them. The
Police Committee of tho Board of Super
visors has reported In favor of awarding
a contract to Scott & Manner for supply
ing No. 1 wheat hay, to tiie Police Depart
ment, the quantity betngfll500 .bales, at the
rate of $13 75 per toni â¢ .The same concern,
two weeks ago, ottered to'- furnish the
same quality of hay^to the"Fire Commis
sioners for the use of the Fire Depart
ment at the rate of $12 98 per ton, and
tho Fire Commissioners promptly rejected
the bid, although Scott & Magner made a
price lower than any other party. New
hay bids will be opened by the Flro Com
missioners, all the old ones being deemed
by the Commissioners to bo far too high.
It now remains to be seen whether the
Board of Supervisors will to-day put
themselves on record in favor of paying
more than the Flro Commissioners found
to*be beyond reason. ,

"My first Impression? of San Francisco
are moÂ« favorable." Elkins said at the
Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon. "Pas
sencers on the China who were Sar. Fran
cisco peop'.e made great claims for their
cÂ«ty, but we laid that to local pride, and I
Â«Lin much surprised to find so cosmopoli
tan and substantial a city. The hotel here
the very beet we have found since we
>ft New York.
"EverythinF is quiet la the Philippines
T.ov and it Is safe for Americans aJmost
anywhere. We found It hard to get away
frcm Manila. The army and navy offi
cers there are first class fellows. But it
is pood to jret back to a irhlte man's coun
try arain."
