NEW YORK, Aug. 4.-The biggest ship
in the world, the Celtic, of the White Star
line, reached her'dock here to-day on her
maiden voyage. Her time from Liverpool
was eight days and forty-six minutes. As
she Is berthed her steerage deck is higher
than the entrance to the pier. After she
was warped, in the iron doors of the aft
cabins had to be opened to land passeng
ers. Three hundred and forty-five cabin
and 268 steerage passengers came over on
the vessel. ' r \V^--^'. Â¦'â¢-;.
It was intended that the big liner should
make marvelous time on . this trip. Her
average speed was 14.95 knots, although
she is able to log 16.50 knots an hour.. -

. The amount of profit that can be real
ized j by selling to the State 2500 acres at
$100 per acre, is problematical! â¢ but that
there Is big money, in.it : for some one
at that rate is evident. For years*the
property has had only a speculative value,
for the reason that, the "land Is: -so Inac
cessible that the lumberman has never
considered that it would.be profitable* to
cut it. Otherwise it would have been cut
long ago, as the scores of denuded hills
in Santa Clara. County attest. .Lumber
men have no sentiment concerning big
trees, or any other kind of trees that are
profitable to them, only when such Iree3
are cut down. The Southern Pacific Com
pany is' reported to have surveyed a line
Into: the 'Big Basin some years- ago, but
the line has never been constructed.' Ex
pectation of such a line would not flgura'
much in the' speculative value of lumber
when shrewd ; men like those jn the Big
Basin Lumber Company were In the mar
ket as purchasers, or as securing options
on the land for their. own; advantage... All
considerations being taken together, there
is no' doubt that the average price per
acre for a* tract ot , 2500 acres/ so- situated
andTso long Inaccessible to profitable lum
bering, 7 " has-been* low to the Big Basin
Lumber Company. What they have" paid

is a .way; to estimate the value, approxi
mately,-by turning .to the books of the
Assessor; of Santa. Cruz County.. ,

J. "W. Forgeous of Santa Cruz, A. M. An

tors, and that each director subscribed

the Sempervirens Club came into the
field to buy the Big Basin. , The date of
incorporation puts this beyond question.
In addition theoptlons that have been se
cured give the company contrpl, for* the
purpose of sale, of about 700 acres more.
Including a tract owned by Timothy Hop
kins, adjoining the body of land chared
to the Big Basin Lumber Company. The
oweners of other tracts in the Big Basin
may also be persuaded to unite with the
company In offering their timber to the
State, so that when the Commissioners
come along the entire tract: they are to
select will have been genteelly picked
out for them to accept and pay for when
the money is available.
Another singular fact Is that in the
pamphlet pictures of localities not In the
Big Basin were published to influence leg
islators who are fond of trees. The men
who made the laws were . asked '. to gaze
on the pictured beauties of a very Â¦ foamy
series of waterfalls on â¢ Big Creek. That
creek "is not in. the Basin, but is some
miles distant. The text left- the forest
loving Senators . and Assemblymen to ,be
lleve that they saw a - waterfall in the Big
Not in the Basin.
But there are several other matters In
connection with the pamphlet presented
with Mr. Reed's signature as president of
the Sempervirens Club, which now be
comes of interest in view of the price
asked by the Big Basin Lumber Company.
One is the . fact : that the pamphlet con
tains several misrepresentations. In the
first place there are not 14,000 acres in the
Big Basin In. Santa Cruz County, but
barely 4000. Another point of Interest is
the significant assertion that "we believe
that we shall be able to â¢ raise enough
money to save the rest of, the. Basin (out
side of the. 5000 acres) if it should be
threatened in the future." If this means
anything It means that more land may be
sought for later. It is already seen that If
the Big Basin Lumber Company gets what
It is after the $250,000 will not "buy a solid
tract of 5000 acres for a park," but only
one-half of that area at $100 per acre.-
These extracts are given partly for the
essential reason that they fix an outside
value of $50 per acre for 5000 acres, which
the club hoped to acquire. The present
asking price of the Big Basin Lumber
Company is $100 per acre. Mr. Reed rep
resented that the lumber men had been
conferred with and that "they required
$25,000 down, which would be 'forfeited if
the whole sum demanded was not after
ward paid." Presumably from this the
Sempervirens Club's executive commit
tee had taken, pains to ascertain some
thing about the real value of the land.
Fixing a Big Price.
â¢ Eighthâ We asked for an appropriation of
$250,000 because this amount of money Â¦will buy
a solid tract of 5000 acres suitable for a park.
This is the least acreage, according to our
estimate, that will fulfill the requirements of
a. State park and include the holdings of the
lumbermen who have gobbled up nearly all the
finest and most beautiful timber, etc. .
Seventhâ We propose a $500,000 park because
that will include all of the 14,000 acres in the
Bigr Basin. This forest is surrounded by a
range of hills and it is because of the difficulty
of access that It has not been despoiled.
organized literature was issued. In a
pamphlet signed by Charles "Wesley Reed
of this city, an attorney, who is also the
president of the club, an appeal was made
to the Legislature for an apportionment
of from $250,000 to $500,000. Under one cap
tion the following occurs over Reed's sig
nature as president:- Â¦ '. .'

what looks suspiciously like a gold brick.
The crusade In favor of Big Basin was
pushed after the organization of the Sem
pervirens Club had been perfected. Many
estimable ladies and gentlemen have be
come members of the club, being fond of
natural scenery and having been per
suaded by others to lend their names.
Very few of them have any knowledge of
the Big Basin except by hearsay. Names
of prominent gentlemen have been used
without authority In connection with the
official board of the Sempervirens Club for
the â¢weight they carry.

was threatened or had already been

taches to the statements heretofore al
luded to, which were made by Charles
Wesley Reed as president of ths Semper-
choice tract of redwood timber on sec
tion Â£4 of township 8, range 3 west, ad
joining the Basin, consisting of 640 acres.
The assessment roll shows that this is
put in at $7680, which Is at the rate of $12
per . acre. Taking tracts In the vicinity
assessed in seven pieces to Timothy Hop
kins, it will be seen that the highest as
sessment is 'on two tracts of 320 acres
each, the value figured out by the As
sessor in each case being $30 per acre. Of
course there is a variation In the value of
timber land where it can be profitably
cut over. The assessment' per acre on the
Big Basin Lumber Company's holdings in
the Big Basin has been raised and it aver
ages $34 per acre. Other lands have about
held their old values. Nothing has taken
place to Increase the value of the Big
Basin Lumter Company's holding except
the chance of selling 'them to the State.
virens Club to the Legislature. Fourteen
thousand acres, he told the Legislature
last; winter, could â¢ be bought for $500,000.
That Is at the rate of about $35 75 per
acre. Five thousand acres could be bought
for $230,000, which is Â«Â»t the rate of $30 per
acre. Supposing the Big Basin land to
have a speculative average value through
out of $50 per acre, it will be seen that
the combination known as the Big Basin
Lumber Company has a chance to make
$125,C00 "easy money" at $100 per acreâ
thus taking one-half of the State's ap
propriation for their profits.
Location of Basin.
The Big Basin in 3anta Cruz County Is
in three townshipsâ 9 S., R. 3 TV.; 8 S.. -
R. 3 W., and 9 S.. R. 4 W. Through it
run several branches of Waddell Creek.
The surface is very rough for the most
part, although there is some compara
tively flat land. It lies between steep
ridges and the floor of the Basin is broken
by ridges. There are no sawmill3 oper
ating in the Basin. In fact there is not
one there. The heavy timber In the
Basin is in township 9-3 and two sections
and a' one-half section In S-3.. There may
bo 4000 acres of land in the area, of which
possibly 80 per cent is timbered. The best
timber is In 9-3. There Is a read into the
Basin and some trails. Last year the
Sempervirens Club went into the Basin,
and camped and saw the best timber there.
No tree that they saw is twenty-two feet
In diameter above the ground, but there
is one eighteen | feet In diameter. Tha
twenty-two-foot tree Is another fiction la
the pamphlet Issued for Legislative per
suasion.
- A map that has been prepared shows
the holdings that the Big Basin Lumber
Company has acquired since the Semper
virens Club began the agitation for pur- .
chase. The Timothy Hopkins land in sec
tion 6 of 9-3 is under option and also sec
tion 1 of 9-4.
The Redwood Park Commissioners are
expected to go to the Big Basin with an
excursion party organized by the Semper
virens Club, and an advisory committed
consisting of W. "W. Van Arsdale. Robert
Dollar, Hervey Undley, General Chipman
and Senator George C. Perkins has been
invited to go along.- The party will camp
ten days In the Basin under the manage
ment of 'the Sempervirens Club.

A Under the terms of the act of

of the. species known as sequoia sernper

Commissioners will have the expenditure
of $250,000 of 'he State's money at their
disposal for the purpose named. TCo lo
cality has been mentioned in connection
with the authorized selection except the
Big Basin country, in the northern part
of Santa Cruz County. The Commission
ers will visit the Big Basin this week,
going there as the guests of the Semper-
Virens Club. Unless all " signs fail they
â¢will encounter a scheme to sell to the
State 2500 acres of timber at $100 per
Bcre. and give land owners a clean profit
of $125,000. -.."':-
The greater part of the 2500 acres which
trill be urged upon the Commissioners for
acceptance at the price named has been
already quietly gathered in by the Big
Basin Lumber Company, a Santa Cruz
corporation, having stockholders judi
ciously distributed "where they can do
the most good." The Big Basin Lumber
Company was Incorporated April 24, 1900.
\ Among the purposes enumerated In Its
articles of incorporation are that it shall'
buy and sell real estate, and its place of
business Is at Boulder Creek. By a singu
lar coincidence the very next week, name
ly, on May L 1SO0, some one succeeded. in
assembling a number of Â¦ studious and
well-meaning ladies and gentlemen at
Stanford University, where, according to
the Inspired literature of the period, "the
first organized effort toward the preserva
tion of the Big Basin" took root. Since
then the Sempervirens Club has been in
existence as the result of the meeting, at
Stanford University. Perhaps any other
organization which had a seemingiy com

John "Ward, residing at 1 Geary place,
was treated at the Emergency Hospital
last night for an abrasion over his right
eye and a bruised elbow. Policeman F.
de Graucourt summoned the ambulance
and made a report on the case. AVard,
who is a non-union man, claims that he
went to the water front at half past 5
o'clock In the morning to go to work on
the Pacific Mail Dock; that two union
teamsters captured him, took him to the
teamsters' headquarters, kept him there
till 7 o'clock In the evening and then gave
him a beating and turned him loose.
The distribution of strike benefits was
continued throughout the afternoon at the
teamsters' headquarters. The portioning
out of the allowances is proving a la
borious task, and when the office closed
late in the afternoon there was still a
number waiting to receive their money.
The paying will be continued to-day.
Teamsters Capture Non-TJnion Man.
Numbers of the men who have been im
ported to the city were approached by the
strikers. In the morning ten men who
had been brought from San Jose to work
for the American Can Company were in
duced to go back to their homes. The
strikers claim that as soon as the situa
tion was explained to the men from the
Garden City they immediately volunteered
to go home, and that not the least force
or intimidation was required. -
About the strikers' headquarters on
Fourth street the Sabbath was passed
without the least disturbance, despite the
fact that there was not a policeman in
sight during tha day. In fact, the whole"
railroad district and the portion of the
city in which the big stables are situated
were left unprotected. The non-union
teamsters invariably kept themselves
within doors, and thus there was no in
centive for trouble. In a number of in
stances the strikers formed themselves
into small parties and visited the homes
of non-union teamsters to induce the men
to surrender their positions. It- was re
ported at the headquarters that this plan
of peaceful persuasion has resulted in
many conversions to the cause of the
brotherhood. .

This action will be taken, the Police De

cautionary measure. There has been so
far in the labor difficulty no necessity for

against any violence and the policemen
who had been riding with non-union driv
ers were withdrawn.
OAKLAND. Aug. 4.â Non-union long
shoremen will be* put to work to-morrow
morning along the water front, under po
lice protection, . to discharge the cargoes
from vessela which are docked here. This
move has been decided upon by the con
signees of the Laura Pike, the Bella,
North Fork and Inyo, from which the
Longshoremen's union of Alameda Coun
ty withdrew yesterday, at the behest of a
"delegation from the Sailors'. Union of San.
Francisco. These four vessels are lumber
laden. The union longshoremen went to
work on the cargoes, but quit after the
seamen had notified them that they were
taking the places of union sailors who had
left the vessels . at. San Francisco In ac
cordance with the federation's strike
order. Â¦ â¢ .
â¢ The first move toward the employment
of non-union men to take the places of the
union- hands who- quit was made to-day,
when a gang was -put aboard barges
alongside the Chilean steamer Aconcagua
at Market-street wharf to load coal into
the vessel which had been towed from
San Francisco. Two ; policemen were sta
tioned at the steamer, and the non-union
crew worked until dark under the protec
tion of the bluecoats. There was no dem
onstration, the men working without in
terruption all day. Application was made
to-night at police headquarters for a po

Water Front Notes.
THE American four-imasted ship
Roanoke" is only fifty-three days
out from Norfolk, Va., for San
Francisco with a, cargo of coal,
but still the underwriters are will
ing to pay 45 per cent to reinsure their
risks on vessel and . cargo. * The vessel
sailed on .lune 12 and ten days later she
was spoken, in latitude 38 degrees north,
longitude 65 degrees west.
On July 5, In latitude 45 degrees 45 min
ute's north, longitude 47 degrees 17 min
utes west, the steamship Margherita
sighted an American wooden ship on fire.
Her captain described the burning vessel
as being more tban 400 fe-et long, with all
her four masts gone, but what was pre
sumably an iron house and a donkey en
gine still standing amidships. Prom the
nature of the fire it was surmised that the
vessel's cargo was coal. On this account
the underwriters at once offered 30 per
cent to reinsure, and now it has reached
45 per cent. '
The Roanoke is one of the. Se wall fleet
and was built at Bath, Me.. In 1892. She
is 3347 tons net burden, 311 feet 2 inches
long, 49 feet 2 inches beam and 20 feet 2
inches deep. Captain Amesbury, her com
mander, is well known in San-Francisco.
The Ingeborg, now out 116 days from
Pacasmayo, Peru, : f or . Melbourne, i Austra
lia, is quoted at 25 per cent; the Brabloch,
eighty-eight days from Hongkong for
Portland, 40 per cent; the County of Had

cause of labor.
Great activity was displayed on the
water front yesterday by the owners of
the vessels which for the last five days
have been tied up. They hurried about
from wt.arf to wharf and" made all sorts

PUEBLO, Colo., Aug. 4.â A special to
the Chieftain from Canon City describes
a homicide there to-day. John Dillon, who
had been a convict in the State Peniten
tiary and was discharged ten days ago,
attempted to smuggle a large quantity of
morphine into the prison, but was de
tected and the warden turned him over to
the City Marshal, John Morrison. As he
was being taken to the jail Dillon sud
denly attacked the Marshal, struck him.
in the face and ran. The Marshal, though
partly stunned, came to himself and sent
a bullet after the runaway, which struck
Dillon in the back, killing him instantly.
Dillon had served three years and was a â¢
rough character. He Â¦was said to "be from.
Pueblo County, but the police here do not
remember him.
DISCHARGED CONVICT
SHOT BY A MARSHAL
A detail of 250 pickets for duty to-day
was made up. The men were cautioned to
do their work quietly and to avoid trou
ble of every description.
In the discussion of the strike several
speakers said they would stand by the
federation to the end. They were anxious
for a speedy settlement of the trouble,
but if that was to be accomplished by the
sacrifice of the' rights of the workmen to
organize in their own interest, then, said
the speakers, the battle had only begun.
The matter was discussed at some
length, the sentiment being almost unan
imous against signing any agreement with
the employers r.ot authorized by the un
ion. The announcement that about twenty
men had signed the agreement and gone
back to work was received in gloomy si
lence.
It Â¦was reported that of the union mem-.
bership of 2000 more than 1400 were on
strike. Of the remainder about severity
five had severed their connection with
the union by resigning. These resigna
tions were not accepted.
Business Agent Loughery reported that
the employers were circulating a form of
agreement among the porters and pack
ers offering to take back the men on con
dition that they hold themselves subject
to the orders_o_f employers, and not to the
union. The agreement, said Mr. Lough
ery, contained a clause to the effect that
any violation of the agreement so signed
by the union striker would result in the
forfeiture of a portion of the delinquent's
salary.
Nearly 500 "members of the Porters',!
Packers' and Warehousemen's. Union met !
at tlia Turkrstreet Temple yesterday aft
ernoon. The strike in' all its: phases was
discussed. .In this connection audresses^
were made: by Edward Rosenberg, secre
tary of the San Francisco Labor Council^
and Delegate Bowlan of the/Hackmen's
Union. These speakers informed the un
ion that the strike was progressing most i
favorably and-that'with the help of faith
ful union members it would surely be
won. The strikers were urged to remain
true to the principles of -trades unionism
and not falter in the struggle now in pro
gress. The addresses were loudly cheered.

A revolution in the method of hauling
heavy cables has probably been caused by
the present strike. Unable to, get teamsters
to do the work, the California-street Ca
ble Railroad Company yesterday moved a
cable from the California Wire Works to
its power-house, at California and 'Hyde
streets, with attraction engine brought
from* Stockton, and did it at a" saving of
nearly $100. ,
The old method was to hitch forty or
fifty horses to the great cable truck kept
for that purpose. . .
Each team required a driver, and each
driver was paid $5. whether it took four
hours or a day and a half to move the
cable. The California-street Cable Rail
road Company had a new cable waiting
at, the factory for transportation to the
power-house. A few days ago the com
pany applied to the Brotherhood of Team
sters for twenty-five drivers for the job.
Â¦It 'was informed that no teamsters could
be furnished, them during the strike.
The street railway people were at a loss
to know what to do until some one sug
gested a traction engine. The use of
traction engines being common at Stock
ton, telephonic communication was opened
and a bargain struck. An engine was
loaded upon a fiat car Saturday morning
and brought down to the city. Yesterday
morning an incline was prepared for it,
and under its own steam it was run off
the car and along the water front to the
wire works at Bay and Powell streets and
hitched to the cable truck. The cable was
moved without difficulty, and Jast evening
the traction engine stood again on its flat
car, on the belt railroad, ready to be sent
back to Stockton. The cost to the street
railway company was between $120 . and
$125. The old method would have cost
from $180 to $225, and the street railway
people say that in future traction engines
will be used for all such work.

CHICAGO, Aug. 4.â "With .a horsewhip
as a weapon, Miss Margaret Smith of
West Harrison street attacked Dr. Sam
uel Sherin at Adams street and Western
avenue to-day, striking him twice on the
head and shoulders. In a belief that the
physician, stung to sudden fury by the
cuts of the lash, was about to strike the
young woman, two young men who wit
nessed the attack, interfered and brought
an end to the whipping. The* sensational
incident was witnessed by a score of spec
tators. Smith charged that Dr.
Sherin had defamed' her character.
Dr. Sherin is president of the "White
Cross Visiting Nurse Association. The as
socation furnishes trained nurses in medi

Miss Smith was formerly employed by
the man she assaulted. Dr. Sherin says
she was dismissed. She declares she vol
untarily left the association because she
could make more money by working inde
pendently.
Miss Smith is. an orphan, 22 years old,
and unusually pretty. She says she heard
recently that Dr. Sherin had made staie

The play was to have been staged at a
second-clas3 Douglas-street playhouse,
and had reached the final rehearsal before
Brookie awakened to the fact that his>
rival was making real love under cover
of his part as cowboy and Indian fighter.
Brookie's role of cunning detective gave
him no opportunity to show his prefer

under the apparent relish with which Ad

away from the hostile foe. Brookie 3Ug-W

said the' clasping and carrying away
might be taken for granted. The rival,
on the other hand, pointed out that the'
crisis mentioned was the most delicate ami
â¢difficult part of the whole action. Ha
pointed out that it might even be well
to go over the scene a second time. A.
general fight occurred in which Brookie,
the obstreperous detective, was thrown
bodily into the street. A substitute detec

The Employers Association takes the
i position that a union man shall- not be
discriminated against, but that on the
other hand workingmen must not be co
| erced into joining unions or employers
compelled to hire union men only. The
association insists that the employer must
be left free "to run his own business in
his own way," and to treat directly with
his own employes in case of alleged
grievances rather than with the delegates
<jr officers cf a union. Employers say ar
bitration would be futile, and that the
iidoption of the terms of peace submitted
by the City Front Federation would sim
ply be delaying the inevitable contest.
They prefer to fight it out now rather
than to postpone the struggle a few weeks
or months. - - -
To take a concrete illustration this
agreement would mean that individual
teamsters would haul goods for the Mor
ten Special Delivery when ordered to do
to. The Brotherhood of Teamsters would
reek arbitration of the question with the
Draymen's Association and eventually the
City Front Federation and the Employ
ers' Association might become parties to
the negotiations. In the end, if arbitra
tion failed, a strike would be the resort
cf the unions.
The labor leaders are asking that the
locked-out teamsters -and the men who
struck in sympathy with them be allowed
to go back to work under the old con
ditions, with the differences, existing prior
tÂ» the lock-out to be left open, to be set
tled if possible by arbitration. They in
sist that the unions shall not agree not to
. order sympathetic strikes in the event of
arbitration failing. On the other hand
they consent that- union men shall obey
the orders of their employer in regard to
their labor.
Points of Difference.
"I am not prepared." said Mr. Furuseth,
"to say what unions the Labor - Council
will call out. In fact they are keeping
their intention secret, but we have their,
assurance that unions affiliated with them
will be ordered to strike unless results are
obtained to-morrow. Naturally the unions
most closely related to transportation in
dustries will be the ones to be called out.
The employers chose the transportation
unions as their point of attack and we
will light them on that field. The effort
Â¦will be, of course, to tie-up ; more com
pletely and effectually the water front and
the wholesale district."
The labor leaders have kept their own
counsel as to what unions, if any, would
be called out. Andrew Furusetn, secre
tary cf the Sailors' Union of the Pacific,
said lGcal unions would be called out in
preference to extending the strike to other
cities of the coast. .

United States Senator Benjamin

of his remarks was a plea in justification
of lynching.

the white people of the South would re

"That is not likely, for neither Chandler

"There was no request, as I understand
it, and there seems to be no necessity for
an inquiry concerning the matter referred
to."
"Might it not be taken up by the Sen

"The only thing I remember concerning
the matter," continued Secretary Long,
"is that Chandler wrote to me about the
time Admiral Evans* book. was published,
and asked for copies of papers and docu
ments relating to Evans. These copies
were sent to him. Later, Chandler wrote
a letter to me, in. which he gave his ver
sion of the case. \
"That may be the matter referred to In
the article which was published to-day. I
would not feel at liberty to make that
letter public without authority from
Chandler, but It is not unlikely that he
would give it out." Â¦ "

will be taken by the Navy Department
against Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans
for the criticism he made In his book, "A

Â¦William E. Chandler when Secretary of
the Navy. Secretary Long is known to
be disgusted with what he regards as a
tempest In a teapot. Some weeks ago he
forwarded to Admiral Evans a letter writ

gested that the naval officer would be

him from duty as lighthouse inspector.
This suggestion was based upon Admiral
Evans' explanation in his book of the real
reasons why he had been relieved, putting

the admiral into a controversy, but the
latter declined. It had been supposed that
the matter had been dropped, but it now

WASHINGTON, Aug. 4.-The State De
partment has received a copy of a re
markable proclamation issued by Gov
ernor Yuen of Shang Tung, June 7, de
fining the relations that must exist be
tween the Magistrates and the Christian
natives. The proclamation deals with the
subject in language so energetic as to
make it evident that the Chinese Magis
trates will not allpw the missionaries to
exercise the same influence as heretofore
in local affairs, or in any other than re
ligious matters in the future. Governor
Yuen states that he has received many
reports from Chinese officials that "un
worthy members of the dhurch were prac
ticing their religion simply for the protec
tion which it afforded them and were set
ting aside the law of the land and seek
ing occasions for quarrel and that such
affairs were daily increasing in number."
In reply to an appeal to have the for
eign Consuls and missionaries devise a
method for checking the trouble, Gov
ernor Yuen demands to know why his
sub-officials have not obeyed his previous
instructions, requiring them to administer
exact justice without regard to whether
offenders are Christians or not. He.
points out that -"the missionaries are
merely preachers of religion. They have
no authority whatever to Interfere in the
affairs of the Chinese people nor any
power to exercise official functions, as
everybody ought to know." Therefore
the Governor enjoins his Magistrates to 7
make no distinction between church ana
people, to let no one else presume to ex
ercise his authority for controlling the
people. He concludes that should people
Insult the Christians because they prac
tice their religion the officials must vigor
ously suppress the disturbance, while, on
the other, hand, should a member of the
church drag in his religion when his suit
is one that has nothing to do with church
matters and the missionary force himself
into the case, then the Magistrate should
not hesitate to controvert and reprove, as
the facts of the case may justify, and
deal with the case according to reason.
The French and Italians still remain
here. The non-fulfillment of the agree

For two hours the pursuing posse was

murderer appealed to the posse not to kill
her son. During her second - appeal the
exchange of shots ceased and the mother
went to the room where the son was, to
find him lying there dead. He had been
shot In the leg below the knee, the bones
being broken. The wound had been in

escape from a horrible death last night.
The child was playing In the dining-room

These prices mean a good deal, coming at this timeâ rthat is, a good deal to people
who want good, serviceable clothes at close prices. The business generally in San Francisco
is certainly quite, inactive at present, and will probably continue so through August. We are
determined to keep busy â to get the bulk of what -trade there is. To accomplish this we
have reduced some new, up-to-date goods that were made up to sell at their regular market-
able* pricesâ we have reduced them as follows:

To convince you of the extent of these reductions we say to every customer â If you
don't think these goods worth their former prices (regardless of the present price) bring
them back and your money will be forthwith returned. We mean it

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
SALT RIVER-D. C. S., City. "Gone
up Salt River" is an old time phrase ap
plied to politicians who are forced out
of public life or who retire because of dis
appointed ambition. It Is said that the
phrase arose from a small stream of that
name in Kentucky, the navigation of
which was very difficult and the unpleas
antness of a journey up that stream was
thought fairly to represent the feelings of
the politicians to whom the phrase was
applied.
IRON CLAD OATHâ D. C. S., City.
"Iron clad oath" was a popular name for
the oath of office prescribed July 2, 1S62,
in which the person not only promised to
defend the constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign; or do
mestic, but also swore that he never gave
aid or encouragement to Its enemies or
accepted office under any government hos
tile to the United States.
It will be seen that the rivalry among the three
powers is so great that anything like an alliance
among them against the United States is well nigh
impossible. Dr. Samuel Johnson, in undertaking to
describe how many fleas there were in a bed in which
The Germans have met the foreign criticism with a
bold front. It is not certain whether the bill can be
passed in its present form, for it concedes so much
to the agricultural classes that the manufacturers are
very sure to oppose it on the ground that it will in
crease the cc ft of the food supplies of the' people. The
advocates rf it, however, make light 'of the probabili
ties of foreign reprisals. Thus the Cologne Volks-
Zeitung is quoted as saying: "Who will be frightened
by the big talk of Russia when it is remembered that
Russia has only the German market 'for. her surplus
of rye? An Austro-Russian tariff alliance against
Germany ?s impossible since Austria herself exports
grain."
The Frcmdenblatt, which is said to be the organ of
the Austrian Foreign Office, is reported to have de
clared the proposed tariff to be' a menace to interna
tional trade and to have uttered the significant threat:
"If Germany wish a tariff war, Austria, Russia and
the United States will be ready to undertake it." The
Vienna correspondent of the London Standard adds:
"The draft of the new. German tariff has caused great
excitement in interested circles throughout Austria-
Hungary because it threatens to put an end to exports
to Germany of barley, oats, cattle and umber. Some
papers assert that a commercial treaty between Aus
tria and. Germany will be impossible if the proposed
enormous increase in duties is persisted in. A similar
dissatisfaction appears to prevail in Russia and dis
patches from St.. Petersburg announce that M. de
Witte will institute reprisals if the bill become a law."
The new German tariff which has been submitted to
the Reichstag, and which will probably be adopted,
disposes of those fears at least for the present. It is
essentially a measure devised for the benefit of Ger
man agrarians and means anything rather than a gen
eral European combination. So far from being aimed
mainly at- the United States it appears to affect Austria
and Russia even more injuriously than us.
MANY have been the reports in the last few
years of the probable, organization of a Euro
pean tariff union against the United States.
Now and then some eminent statesman or economist
in Europe hns been reported as declaring in favor
of feuch an organization and some persons in the
Uir'ted States have been alarmed lest the proposed
league might really be formed and the European
market be virtually closed to our products.
THE GERMAN TARIFF.
POPULATION OF CITIESâ A. C. L.,
Milton, Cal. Following, is given as the
population of each of the twelve cities
named in letter of inquiry, according to
the census of 1900: San Francisco, 342,
782; Los Angeles, 102,479; Oakland, 66,960;
Sacramento, 29,292; San Jose, 21,500; San
Diego, 17,700; Alameda, 12,772; Fresno, 12,
470; Pasadena, 9117; Riverside, 7973; Val
lejo, 7965, and Santa Rosa, 6673.
The Washington men who are directing, the move
ment assert that the general sentiment of the. coun
try is favorable to the change, and that there will be
a strong support for it in both, houses of Congress.
It is therefore quite, probable the subject may become
an issue of practical politics this winter. The interest
of Washington City in the matter is very great. The
change would vastly benefit their business, and, that
being so, there is a certainty, the movement will not
fail from any lack of energy at the capital.
The proposed change will mean something more
than the mere substitution of a more convenient date
for the inaugural ceremonies. If, as has been sug
gested, the date be changed from March. 4 to April
30, there will be added somethinglike two months of
time to McKinley's term and a corresponding addi
tion to the short term of Congress. It is from the
latter change that most good is. expected: At the
present, time the closing term of the life of a Con
gress is so short that Very little work can be accom
plished. As a rule Congress does not get fairly to
work until after the January holidays, so that when
it has'to adjourn on March 4 it has only about two
months in which to work. By postponing the in
auguration date to the end of April there would there
fore result considerable benefits to Congress and to
the country at large.
We are now to have something more than a dis-*
cussion on the subject. A movement strongly sup
ported in Washington has been started for the pur
pose of urging action upon Congress at the coming
session. A committee of citizens, headed by John
Joy Edson, who was chairman of the last inaugural
committee, has requested the District Commission
ers to appoint a national committee to assist the ef
forts of the promoters in Washington, and it has been
announced that the committee will be composed of
the Governors of the various States and Territories
and of fifteen other persons chosen from the country
at large. .
FOR a long time past there has been a good deal
of discussion concerning the advisability of
changing the date of the inauguration of our
Presidents. The season that has been established for
that ceremony is so inclement that at every successive
inauguration the clamor for a change arises with in
creased emphasis.

From the foregoing it will be seen that while there
is a large spot in the Western and Southwestern parts
of the country where the hot and dry weather has
depressed trade, the East, North, South and Pacific
Coast are all doing an active business. The steel
strike is a disturbing element in Wall street and the
iron regions, and our ownjocal strikes have affected
trade in this city more or less. With these exceptions,
however, commercial conditions in the United States
are much better than usual at this time of the year.
This is partly substantiated by the failures during July,
which were 697, against 793 in July, 1900.
As far as the East is concerned conditions are re
ported satisfactory. The country's bank clearings
were 33 5 per cent larger last week than for the same
week last year, and every important city except New
Orleans and Omaha showed a gain. _ At Pittsburg,
where the iron and steel business centers, the in
crease in bank clearings fell to 7.6 per cent, the small
est for a long time. This indicates a slackening in
the iron and steel business, though commercial re
ports show continual orders on a large scale, with
many mills supplied with orders up to the end of the
year. The production of pig iron during the first half
of the year was immense, breaking all records, while
from present indications the production of the last
half will be equally large. The boot and shoe trade is
still quoted active, though there have been many
cancellations of orders from the dry sections of the
West. The woolen mills are rilled with fall orders,
and the spring business is also opening up well. Lum
ber, however, is reported quieter.
The recent weather in the West and Southwest has
completely reversed business conditions in many parts
of the country. The rains have improved cotton
prospects in the South and reports from there are
new much more cheerful. Dry and hot weather in the
West, on the contrary, have produced an enormous
demand for many lines of fruit, vegetables and other
food products. The market for California dried fruit
has been remarkably stimulated and San Francisco
operators are reporting a heavy movement in peaches,
apricots and apples in the country, while the Cured
Fruit Association, after making an enormous sale of
800 cars of prunes, following it up with additional
sales on a smaller scale, has withdrawn all quotations
and will sell no more at present, expecting higher
prices for this fruit from now on. The demand for
our canned fruits and potatoes for the West has
already been mentioned. The Northwest will pro
duce large crops, considerably in excess of last year,
hence a heavy fall trade is expected in 'that section.
THE rains throughout the West and Southwest
have given business the other side of the
Rockies a brighter aspect. A large spring
wheat crop is now virtually assured and while the early
corn has been seriously damaged in many sections
and almost destroyed in some, yet the late corn has
been helped out materially. Conditions are still crit
ical, however, and the condition of corn in Missouri
is now placed at 21 points, a poor exhibit. Advices
Irom Chic.ngo during the past two or three days re
port renewed strength in this cereal, as the improve
ment owing to the rains turns out less than expected,
for, while the plant itself has again become green and
apparently vigorous, many of the stalks are barren
and will produce no ears. The best estimates now in
dicate a corn crop of 1,500,000,000 bushels, against
2.400,000.000 anticipated a couple of months ago.

PROBABLY the largest child In the United. States for his age Is Harry Eg
gerts, son of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Eggerts. 307 West Kinney street. New'
ark, N. J. He is three and a half years old. Is considerably taller than
children of that age and weighs 155 pounds. Mr. and Mrs. Eggerts are
very proud of him and of his baby sister Grace, who is only twenty-one
months old and weighs ninety-two pounds.
Mrs. Eggerts says that the children were not weighed at birth, but she
thinks Harry weighed about twenty pounds when he came Into the world. He Is
now as tall as an ordinary child of six years, and aside from his excessive fat 13
normal in every way. He Is mentally bright, is physically active and has a good
appetite.
Both father and mother of the children are of ordinary height and build.
Mrs. Eggerts Is, In fact, rather slim, but the says that every other member of
her family is stout. ;
Harry and Grace are remarkably healthy, and have been since their birth,
although Harry takes slight colds easily and has to be carefully watched in
winter.
It has taken the people of New England a long time
to learn the importance of forests to a community, and
perhaps Californians will be equally obtuse on the
subject. Our education, however, while it ma/ be
equally costly, is not likely to take so long in teaching
it? lesson. Owing to our long dry season our forests
are far more exposed to fires, than were those \f the '
New England States. When a fire breaks out in our
mountains it is not easily checked. During the dry
season report after report comes in of fires that have
swept miles and miles of territory. In the aggregate
the waste has never been fully computed, but it is
known to be enormous. "_. California is large and her
forests are extensive, but vast as they are they cannot
for many years stand the tremendous waste. If we do
not put a stop to the fires -by some comprehensive
system of forest protection we shall in a 1 few years be
compelled to go to the cost of replanting forests even
as the people of Europe are doing at this time.
In the Eastern States the destruction of forests has
already reached the danger point. It is noted in New
England that streams which in bygone times flowed
with full currents all the year round and furnished an
abundant water power for factories and mills are now
running in torrents every spring and becoming almost
dry in the summer. The change in the flow of the
streams is due to the destruction of the woods around
their sources and along their banks. Thus New Eng
land, by permitting the destruction of her forests, has
not only wasted her woodland wealth but has actually
lessened the water power upon which so many of her
manufacturing industries depend.
We will have to record many an item of a similar
nature before the dry season is over. Every year these
dreary stories are repeated. The annual loss in mer
chantable property amounts to many millions of dol
lars and forms a heavy offset to the revenues derived
from out fields and forests, but such losses, heavy as
they are, constitute by no means the whole of the
damage. The destruction of a, forest implies some
thing more than the burning of merchantable timber
or the blighting of a grass or stubble field with its
valuable pasturage: It means the killing of thousands
of young trees that would have grown up to be of
great value, and moreover it widens that deforested
and bare area of territory that materially affects the
conservation of moisture and the general climatic
conditions of the country.
REPORTS from Redding announce the outbreak
of a forest fire which at the time of the dis
patch had already swept over a* district five
miles square and was still burning. The report stated:
"The flames are being fed principally from limbs and
brush of trees left by woodchoppers. Dry as tinder,
the stuff makes a hot fire that in some places roars
like a cyclone. The fire department of Keswick had
to be called out to save . the historic old town of
Shasta. Its destruction for awhile seemed certain."

again on March 24, 1S98, and subsequently
was sent to China, where she remained

The latest design for a submarine boat
in France is one of 200 tons, differing but
little from that of the Narval. except In
the mode of propulsion. The change con
sists In discarding electric accumulators
and substituting an engine driven by
alcohol, which, with compressed air, fur
nishes "the motive power. The air Is con
tained in reservoirs under a pressure of
100 atmospheres, and when the boat is on
the surface the air is allowed to escape
directly Into the water. It Is only when
submerged that the alcohol engine is
brought into service. This new boat,
which will cost about $180,000. will be fcuHt
with the greatest dispatch at Toulon.
The naval arsenal at Toulon possesses
unusual good facilities for supplying ships
with coal, water, ammunition and pro

Such being the case, it behooves all earnest and
genuine Republicans to engage actively in the task of
bringing out a big vote of the better elements of the
party at the primary election. The members of the
party should post themselves concerning the rival
tickets which will be placed in the field in their dis
tricts and should be prepared to vote for and to work
for the ticket that stands for honest politics. Election
day is not far distant and the time will pass rapidly.
Therefore good citizens should get to work at once.
Having a big registration, there ought to be an over
whelming majority for good government.
It is not too much to say that the immediate welfare
of the city will be dependent upon the outcome of the
Republican primaries. , If, under the new election law,
the bosses should succeed in controlling the Repub
lican nominating convention, there will be left for the
people at the municipal election nothing but a choice
between two boss tickets. In that event nothing in
the way of improvement in municipal affairs could
be expected.- San Francisco would .suffer in every
direction and the injury would fall not only upon
public administration but upon private business.
While searching for aid from outside heelers the
bosses have not overlooked any of the possibilities
of the slums in San Francisco. Evidence has been
already forthcoming of attempts made to colonize
voters in doubtful districts, and the people may be
sure that the bosses will not hesitate to take ad
vantage of the disaffection in the Democratic camp to
bring into the Republican primaries as many of the
camp followers of Democracy as the bosses of that
party can turn over to them. In fact, the primary
law, while it puts an end to certain of the bolder frauds
of predatory politicians and secures to every citizen
the right to "vote without molestation and to have his
vote counted, does not prevent the bosses from still
trying fraudulent practices of other kinds.
Herrin and Kelly and Gage and Crimmins are fully
aware of every feature of the situation. They know
they have a desperate fight before them and they have
not hesitated to bring to their aid in this local contest
all the cunning and unscrupulous bosses they could
gather in from the four quarters of the State. Any
body who can do any kind of dirty work is good
enough for them at this juncture, and whether he
come from Modoc or Los Angeles makes no differ
ence. So long as he can serve them they are willing
to interject him into San Francisco politics.
The contest this year is to be almost wholly within
the Republican party. In the Democratic camp every
thing is stagnant. The symbolic donkey of the party
is seemingly hidebound and balky. He cannot grow
and he will not go. The machine will put up a ticket
in which most of the party will take but little interest
and the public no interest at all. It is a foregone con
clusion that if the bosses be beaten in the Republican
primaries and a good ticket be nominated it will
carry the city and be charged with the responsibility
of the ensuing administration.
Now that the voters have been duly registered, the
next thing is to make sure that they take part in the
election. At this point we are once again confronted
by the danger that the very" promise of victory may
go far to defeat itself by awakening among the' better
elements of the people a spirit of overcon'fidence.
Realizing that the hopes of the bosses were based
upon the expectation of a light vote, and perceiving
from the registration that a heavy vote will probably
be cast, some men may persuade themselves that their
vote is not needed, and that they may safely stay away
from the polls. It is against that danger that good
citizens must now be en guard.
UPON the closing on Saturday evening of regis
tration for the , primary elections there were
.: more than 78,006 names on the Great Register,
being the largest number ever recorded in* San Fran
cisco. The result attests the excellence of the work
done' by the Republican Primary League in arousing
public interest in the election, and gives promise of a
complete defeat of the bosses on election day.

The report from Wellsville, Ohio, says:
The Amalgamated Association Is rapidly
gaining strength in McKeesport and it is esti
mated that they added at least 200 new mem
bers to Its forces at two meetings held this
afternoon. The meeting of National Lodge,
consisting of employes of the Boston Iron and
Steel Works, was largely attended, and al
though no definite statement was given out in
regard to the number of new men taken into
the lodge the conservative estimate Is placed
at 100. while others claim nearly . double this
rtumber were added to the lodge. The mem
bers of the lodge claim they now have the
entire Boston mill organized, with the excep
tion of two men, and these latter positively
refuse to have anything to do with the or-r
canlzatlon. Union Lodge, composed of em
ployes of the National rolling mill, at its
meeting secured, it Is rumored, 100 new mem
bers. The strikers last night were claiming
that everything was coming their way, and
that if a general strike order is issued the
National Tube Company will be unable to turn
a wheel and that they would have between
8000 and 10,000 men out. The tube workers are
organized by the American Federation of La
bor which organization will readily respond to
the call of the Amalgamated Association. The
business men of McKeesport are greatly de-
Dressed by the situation and they fear that If
a general order is issued from strike head
auarters their business will be nearly ruined,
at least for the time being, ai about 15,000. men
would be idle.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 4.â When the general
strike order is issued, among the first to
go out will be the Amalgamated men at
the Republic Iron Works on the South
Side. This mill is a branch of the Na
tional Tube Company, which has plants
all over the country. The skilled men at
the Republic mill are said to be well or
ganized.
From McKeesport this announcement Is
made to-night:

LONDON*. Aug. 4.â Last week's record
on the Stock Exchange was erratic, but
scarcely interesting. The period was Lro
ken up by the settlement and the fact that
the impending holidays followed so close
upon it. The same conditions will prob
ably continue, preventing anything like
the resumption of normal trading. Most
of the leaders of the market, who are now
taking their vacations, are reluctant to
/ipen fresh accounts; and the smaller op
erators for the most part* remain occupie-1
with scalping fractions from each other
in the hope of being able to afford vaca
tions for themselves later in the season.
Money was easy in spite of the consider
able demand usual in connection with the
rettlement, but there was a good supply
from Paris and Berlin, and this promiEcs
continued ease here. Home railways were
dull, the trading remaining at about the
lowest figure. Even Americans were in
ective after the slight rally at the begin
ning of the week, due to a hope that the
steel strike would be settled. Least de
pressed cf all were Canadian railway se
curities. Their strength was due to the
immense crop outlook and the prospective
harvest.
Proceedings in bankruptcy have been be
gun against the Aktien Gesellschaft four

culties in various institutions. Canadians
developed great strength, rising all the
week.
"A fatalistic tone possessed the Boerse."
says the Frankfurter Zeitung. "which
makes an exceedingly despondent Impres
sion and augurs much evil."
The monthly settlement, while passing
off easily so far as the money market is
concerned, has revealed an unexpectedly
large short interest, and this inquiry has
been followed by a firm feeling.
The physiognomy of the Boerse grows
more gloomy from week to week, and the
general business situation becomes more
and more threatening. The feeling is evi
dently growing that much rottenness Â£t'dl
remains to be uncovered.
BERLIN, Aug. 4.â The new German tar
iff bill did not have a marked influence
upon the Boerse last week, operators be
lieving that many of the worst features
would be modified. Ocean transportation
shares, however, weakened.
The general tone of the market contin
ues heavy and marked by short selling.
The short stock took advantage of the
many unfavorable rumors regarding vari
ous companies to beat down values, and in
this way were assisted by the publication
of numerous balance sheets which sup
plied inadequate information about the
financial condition of the companies in
volved.

The reports presented showed that the
committee had a large number of cases to
attend to, which included the care of
brothers of the order in distress and
widows and orphans of deceased brothers,
the work being done by delegates from
the local lodges, who every Sunday dur
ing a period of six months attend a meet
ing from 10 o'clock in the forenoon till
noon to report on the condition of those
who are sick and in need of help and of
the visitations made during the preceding
week. In the carrying out of this work of
love and charity there was disbursed from
the general fund $8380 05, and from the
friendship fund $43 10. There was on hand
at the close of the term $1808 70.
There were two contests for office, these
fer, Secretary WIlliam3, B. I. Davis, M.
F. Tighe and John Chappelle came to
Washington after the announcement in
New York of their failure to reach an
agreement with the United States Steel
Corporation officials. They reached this
city late last night and registered at one
of the downtown hotels. Their presence
in the city was known only to a few peo
ple. They departed for Plttsburg this
forenoon. While here the committee had
two extended interviews with General
Secretary Frank Morrison, the principal
officer of the American Federation of La
bor now 'in the city. President Gompers
being away-for a few days' visit to the
north.
Morrison did not want to discuss the ob
ject of the committee's -visit. He would
not say specifically to wmat extent the
federation would aid the Amalgamated
Association. He confined himself to the
general statement that the committee had
come to Washington for a conference with
the officials of the federation as to the
best methods of procedure in carrying on
the strike. The Amalgamated Associa
tion, Morrison said, was affiliated with
the federation and was entitled to the co
operation and aid of the greater body in
conducting the strike movement to an ef
fective and successful issue. Morrison
expressed himself as confident of the ulti
mate victory of the steelworkers, and felt
certain that the Federation of Labor
would jrfve them all the aid in its power.
He was asked specifically where orders
would be issued for an extension of the
strike in affiliated branches of labor and
regarding the matter of financial assist
ance to the steel strikers, but declined to
answer the questions. The members of
the general council of the Federation of
Labor are within reasonable distance of
Washington, and if any decisive action is
to be taken by the federation in aiding
the steel strikers it is probable a meeting
of the council will be called for that pur
pose. President Gompers Is expected to
return to Washington early in the week,
probably to-morrow.

mittee of the Independent Order of

MONESSENâ The Amalgamated Association
expects to gain many recruits from the Na
tional Tin Plate mill during the week, and it
is more than likely that the full force of men
will not report for duty to-morrow. This week
will witness a turn in the local situation
which will mean a decisive victory for one side
or the other. Manager Percy E. Donner real
izes that a crisis Is imminent, which will de
cide the conflict, and is concentrating his ef
forts to prevent a break in the ranks of his
workmen. '
SHARON, Pa.â If the general strike order Js
issued, it will have but little effect In the
Shenango Valley further than closing the In
dependent blast furnaces, whose product Is
controlled by the Bessemer Association. It is
announced to-day that the blast furnace work
ers will receive an order from their union to
close the plants to-morrow. If the independ
ent furnace men go out about 1000 men will be
affected here, at Sharpsville and West Middle
sex. The National Steel Works in this city is
unorganized and It is not believed the men
will strike. - . â¢ . . â¢ , .
SCOTTDALE, Pa,â The determination of the
Amalgamated Association to 'call out the or
ganized employes of the United States Steel
Corporation will have no material effect here.
Both the Scottdale and Old Meadow plants
will start up in full at midnight topflight as
usual. As stated already, it will take more
than mere sympathy for the Amalgamated
Association to induce the men at this place
to Join the strike.
WHEELING. -W. Va.-The organization of
the first military company by a labor organiza
tion was put under way last night by Crescent
Lodge of the Amalgamated Association, and
to-day so popular Is the plan that the members
of the labor. unions by the hundred are dis
cussing it favorably and the Indications are
that a very large percentage of Wheeling's la
bor will soon be under military discipline. The
two full companies formed in Crescent Lodge
will not be In any way controlled by the State,
but will be as Independent as are the military
companies of secret and religious organizations.
Their officers will be empowered to order ac
tion, but only in the line of self-defense or in
the defense of the property of their employers
when endangered by mobs. Their constitution
declares that their Interests and that of their
employers are Identical. Only when property
is endangered will they act. The Amalgamated
Association Is ready to close all trust mills on
a strike order. Workers In independent mills
have pledged 20 per cent of all earnings to the
strike fund and Crescent Lodge has resolved to
give half it the national board can use it.
There are 3000 men in the independent mills.
Business is already seriously affected, workmen
generally making preparations for a long siege.
The general strike order will affect 13.000 men
in the Wheeling district. All the trust mills
are fully organized except the RlverBlde and
Bellalre and there the men have a partial or
ganization.
The following telegrams were received
to-night:
town, but they say they will take no part in
the trouble, should any occur, unless the local
police force is unable to cope with the situa
tion. . The deputies were In consultation this
evening with P. M. Smith, attorney for the
steel 1 company, but the result of the conference
was kept secret, both parties refusing to dl
vulgre anything that took place. It is thought
by the strikers that an application will be
made to the United States Court in Cleveland
for an injunction to restrain them from picket
ing the approaches to the mill. If the injunc
tion is granted they say it will be broken, and
this step will bring matters to an immediate
issue. To-night mills No. 1, 2 and 4 and 6 are
lighted up ready to begin work at 3 a. m. There
is a feeling of unrest among the operative pot
ters of East Liverpool and Wellsville, and the
owners of the plants are fearful lest they come
out in sympathy with Uie steel workers. There
are 9000 operatives In the potteries In the two
towns. The railroad brakemen on the C. and
P. division will hold a meeting on Tuesdayno
map out a course of action. They are heartily
in sympathy with the strikers and may decide
to'come out In sympathy. â¢
Among the many who attended the
meeting were Past- Presidents Wilson.
Dovle, "Watson, Turpin, Holcomb, Voor
hees. Smith and Remey, several of whom
addressed the meeting, after which there
was an adjournment to a restaurant,
where an excellent dinner, tendered to the
outgoing and new officers and prepared
under the direction of F. W. Stowell and
C. F. Phillips, was partaken of. James A.
Wilson, past president, was toastmaster,
arid a witty one he proved to be. For the
good of the order there were responses by
President "Webb, Past President Breck

GENERAL
STRIKE TO
BE ORDERED
Steel Workers Will Go
Out at All Trust
Mills.
Amalgamated Association Is
Determined to Fight .to
a Finish.
Billion Dollar Cor
poration.
Be Held Unless Sought by the
Xo More Peace Conferences Are to
PITTSBURG. Aug. 4.-Within a week
every union man and every union man at
heart in the employ of the United States
Steel Corporation will be asked to join in
the strike now being waged by the Amal
gamated Association. We must settle
whether unionism is to stand or fall.
There will be no more conference with the
United States Steel Corporation unless the
meeting is asked for by the officials of the
corporation. The Amalgamated Associa
tion will not ask a peace meeting." i
These and several other significant
statements were made to-night by Presi
dent Shaffer of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers
upon his return from the fruitless con
ference with J. Pierpont Morgan and
others in New York.
It is now a fight to the finish between
the great billion dollar steel trust and
organized labor. Shaffer says he is ready
to employ every peaceable means wiihln
the power of man to win a Â¦ victory. No
quarter is to be given, and none will be
requested. The entire management of the
battle has been placed in the hands of
President Shaffer. He has absolute power
to call out every man who is connected
with the organization and he intends to
do it. He is satisfied with the progress
of the fight to date.* He finds that none
of his battle lines have been broken
Promise 1^ made by Shaffer that the trust
will find the Amalgamated Association
strong in many of its mills.
Against Sunday Meetings.
Shaffer, Secretary Williams, B. I. Davis
M. F. Tighe and John Chapelle of Wells
ville came in from New York this evening.
The president and advisers did not appear
to be the least cast down.
"There is not much that I can say about
the situation at present," said Shaffer.
"Will there be a meeting of the advisory
board to-night to order a general strike?"'
was asked.
"No, I always endeavor to prevent Sun
day meetings when-1 can. We held none
on the train to-day," was the reply.
"Will there be a meeting to-morrow?"
"None is needed. The fact of the mat
ter is, we held one in New York last even
ing."
Was there any action taken at that
meeting about calling out all otthe men In
the employ of the United States Steel
Corporation?"
Strike Order Within a Week.
"I was given full authority to act. The
meeting empowered me to issue a call
whenever in my judgment I thought it
time to act."
"When will that call be issued?"
"That depends upon a number of things.
It Is difficult to say just the exact day
that I will be ready to exercise the au
thority vested in me."
"Is the order likely to go out to-night?"
"I hardly think so. I am of the opinion
that I could not prepare myself to issue
the order to-night."
"Will you do anything In the matter
this evening?"
"I will not. I am going home to rest
and wait until to-morrow to resume the
cares of my position."
"Cannot you fix some definite date when
the order will be issued?"
"You can say that within a week every
union man an* every union man at heart
in the employ of the United States Steel
Corporation will be requested by me to
Join the Amalgamated Association in win
ning this strike."
"Do you think you will be able to close
all of the mills of the steel trust?"
"I am of the opinion that every one of
them can be closed. We have some great
surprises in store for the trust. The men
have been organized in some of their
mills that they never dreamed could be
touched. We have the sympathy of the
workmen and they will not throw any
straws in the way of our absolute vic
tory."
Shaffer said that the stories that Mor
gan had been ugly during the conference
on Saturday were untrue. He said the
gentleman had been courteous and busi
ness-like throughout the entire meeting,
and if he had lost his temper it was after
the adjournment of the gathering.
Not Afraid of Negro Labor.
"Are you afraid of Southern negroes be
ing brought in to break the strike?"
"Not in the least. The negroes of the
South are thoroughly organized. "We have
not been overlooking that detail. They
make the best kind of union men. The
three hundred colored men brought from
the South to assist in starting the plant
of the Datrobe Steel Company in Chicago
were all members of the union. When
they discovered what was wanted of them
they returned to their homes."
Secretary "Williams was not disposed to
discuss the situation at such great length
as his chief. He did, however, have this
to say:
"All possibility of settlement of this
difficulty apoears to be * at an end. "We
carefully considered the proposition of the
trust. It was decided that the terms were
such that we could not accept. To ac
cept would have meant practically the
disruption of our organization. We could
not have agreed and returned to face the
men we represented. It is now a case
of fight. I think the contest will be the
greatest industrial battle the world has
ever known. I am thoroughly convinced
that we will win the victory."
Strikers Anxious for Support of the

WASHINGTON,; Aug. 4.â President
Shaffer and other members of the execu
tive board of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers have
been sounding the American Federation
of Labor as to the extent the latter body
can be depended upon in supporting the
great steel strike now under way.

At Tokio the rat catchers have received

Kyoto, Shanghai, Hongkong, Canton,
Amoy and Foocho-w. At Tokio several
buildings of the Imperial Japanese Uni

with plague baccili, although the plague
has not yet Invaded Tokio. The authorities
have determined not to relax their precau

so much per rat. Prizes will be allotted
after the total number of jrats captured

TWO HOSTLERS HAVE
A ICUTtDEB-OTTS TIGHT
Assault to Commit
Murder.
Emil Muller Arrested on a Charge of
Emil Muller, a hostler at the St. George
stables, 408 Bush street, was arrested yes
terday morning about 9 o'clock by Police
men Roedlger and Heinz and -booked at
the City Prison on a charge of assault
to murder. He is accused of cutting
Charles Dudley, another hostler, five
times on the throat, chest, arm and head
with a pocket knife. Dudley was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where his
wounds, which are not considered danger
ous, were stitched and dressed.
Muller did not deny cutting Dudley, but
claimed he did it- in self defense. He said
that Dudley had been drinking and ac
cused him of playing .tricks on him.
Muller denied doing so and Dudley
grabbed him by the back of the neck and
threw him to the floor, falling on top of
him. Muller had been filling the grain
bin and had an open pocket knife in his
hand with which he had been cutting the
strings on the grain sacks. To defend
himself, as Dudley was "punching" him,
he slashed Dudley with the knife. Dudley
lifted him to his feet and dragged him
down the runway. At the bottom Dudley
again got. on top of Muller and Muller
continued defending himself with the
knife until another stableman interfered
and took the knife from him.
Muller Is a small man and Dudley a
large, powerful fellow. Muller's right
thumb was cut and there was an abrasion
on his throat caused by Dudley's fingers.
Muller has been working at the stables
for more than a year and is known as a
quiet, peaceable man.

to-morrow." O. LÂ». Garrison of St. Louis,
chairman of the Illinois Coal Operators'
Association, who is here, is reticent as to
the object of the conference. Asked if a
sympathetic strike of miners is feared,
he said: "There's no telling what .mine
workers may do. If President Mitchell
should call his men out I think he would
make a serious mistake. The executive
board of the bituminous district, com
prising Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Penn
sylvania will be in session to-morrow and
I expect to see the officials and have a
talk with them. The conference will turn
on the annual meeting, of the operators
and miners next January."
:, It Is reported here to-night that Indiana
operators are; fearful of . a sympathetic
strike of miners in aid' of the steel strike.
A prominent operator said to-night: , "It
Is true much, uneasiness prevails in the
coal fields of the State on account of a
possible sympathetic strike. A meeting
of the miners' executive board to-morrow
will be. watched with more than usual in
terest.- It '' is known that the anthracite
field is excited and this feelincr has Invad
ed the bituminous fields. It is impossible
to predict â¢ what will occur. â¢ I : believe
President Mitchell of the mine workers
will not- favor a sympathetic strike, but
ha may be outvoted.''

money, with Satanella runner-up.. Satan
ella proved a lucky find for the pikers.
She beat Pasha Girl in the first round,
Cobweb in the second, and followed by
shutting out Morena, the stake favorlte^ â
in each event on the short end' at 1 to 3.
In .the deciding course, she ran a good
course with Emin Bey.
The followers of the sport discussed the
relative merits of Tame Tralee and Tralee
Boy to a great extent at yesterday's meet
ing, and finally prevailed upon those in
terested to have the proposed match be
tween these fast youngsters an open one.
The park has taken the matter in hand,
and announces that the trial will be held
on Sunday next. These puppies are con
sidered by many the best of the 1900 lit
ters.
Following are the day's results, with
Judge John Grace's official scores:
Frank Jones' fast greyhound "Wedge
wood won the eighty-eight-dog open stake
at Union Coursing Park yesterday, beat-
Ing F. A. McComb's Sir Pasha pointless
In the deciding course. Wedgewood was
in fine trim and throughout the stake
showed to great advantage. In the seven
times he went to the "slips" he allowed
but one point to be scored against him.
In the third round* Wedgewood was on
the cards against. Palo Alto, the stake fa
vorite. The talent figured Geary's cham
pion a winner, and sent him out a 4 to 1
choice. Up the field the short-ender held
his high-priced opponent down, and
though by slight favor drew out naif a
length for the turn. When the flag went
up, Wedgewood had a clean score and an
earned victory to his credit. The rest of
the going was easy lines for the winner.
After the set-back In this course the tal
ent went to the cashier's office after each
course without a miss. .
T. J. Mclnerney's Norah started 111 feel
ing by beating the Star Kennels' Her
schel s Pride, on whom the prophets had
laid there shekels at the rate of 6 for 1.
The favorite failed to score. Hot Haste,
a 2. to 1 choice over Sir Pitt, could not
overcome the strain of his previous day's
work, and. was returned a loser.
Achilles, after an undecided, shut out
Anchor, a 7 to 1 sure thing, and in the fol
lowing course Master Lawrence beat Fly
ing Fox at the same price.
The Fox was willing enough, but his
opponent worked the hare so closely that
he kept sole possession until the finish.
Tyrone Prince looked at one time a
strong one for the final. In the fifth
round he lost, after an undecided, to Sis
quoc in a course that kept the clerks
busy. Sir Pasha beat Slsquoc in the next
round, where the play was almost as
heavy. '

Open Event in Easy

Few of the yachts were under Ball yes
terday, but Frank Stone's Presto, . with
her newly trimmed sails and a tiller In
place of the wheel, went out for a spin.
On returning to the clubhouse Frank
Stone and his crew . received - a hearty
cheer from the yachtsmen gathered on the
piazza. It has been decided that the race
between the sloops Helen and Presto
shall take place next Saturday, August
10. and during the week ararngements
will be made forsettlne out the stake
boats, hiring a tug to carry the Judges
and others, measuring the two contesting
yachts and setting all the details of the
race for the cup. The expenses will be de
frayed by the challenging and defending
clubs jointly, and each club will receive
an equal number of tickets for the judges'
boat.
The clambake given by the Corinthian
Yacht Club for the benefit of the non
yacht owning members-has now. become a
regular annual event. Yesterday the
piazza was crowded with yachtsmen and
their friends. ' Preparations for the bake
began early in the morning, a huge fire
being made in a hollow in the rocks with
which the old scow to the west of the
clubhouse has been filled. After the rocks
had been thoroughly heated heaps of
clams, green corn, sweet potatoes and
pieces of chicken wrapped in cloth were
laid upon a bed of seaweed, which was
covered over with more seaweed and old
sacks. While preparations for the feast
were going on under the skilled supervis
ion of Port Captain John H. Keefe and
George Crowell, others were rigging
themselves out in queer headgear and pro
viding themselves with tin cans and
sticks. When the 11 a. m. boat from the
city was sighted a procession was formed
to go down to the depot and meet the
Native Sons' Band, which was escorted to
the clubhouse. At 12:30 the feast began,
the tables being set under canvas on the
roof of the boathouse. After the feast the
band, under the leadership of R. ,D. Bar
ton, began action. The musicians were
succeeded by the Edna Quartet, R. B.
Mitchell, Frank W. Thompson and others
keeping the crowd amused by their hu
morous stunts.

Oakland 2, San Francisco 5.
Two innings won the game for the local
team yesterday morning at the Oakland
gTounds. Until the fourth Moskiman was
doing splendid box work for the Dudes.
Then he faltered, and the local bat swing
ers unraveled the curves to a merry, trip
ping tune. Two runs In the fourth and
three in the following Inning gave Henry
his second game of the series. The home
run hitting was done by Arrellanes, who
coursed the bags when no Dude was there
as an ornament, and by Schwartz, who
tiad better luck. It was a fast fielding
game from beginning to end, Eagan and
Dunleavy being the only sinners. The
ecore:

The r>udes forgot all their epicurean
ism yesterday afternoon at Recreation
grounds and went after Ham a la Iburg.
They had him for the first course and
wound up their feast by pitching into
more Ham. There never was a time dur
ing the game that looked the color of the
Wasps. The Dudes ruled and swung the
bat with effectiveness whenever the oc
casion demanded, and often when it did
not. It would be wise for Uncle Henry
to come home and list to something else
but the merry yea waves off Avalon.
Were it not for the error of Mr. Francks
in the first Inning the Wasps would have
sauntered through the game without the
infliction of a single sting. His wild throw
allowed Croll to skirt the sacks and save
Henry's ill-bebaved pets from . a white
wash.
Oakland oeppered Iburg's delivery right
through the same, Moskiman standing
high by a fine drive to the flagpole, which
netted him three bases. In the field he
was equally as strong, throwing out
Beilly at the first bag on a hit to right,
6omething very rare in baybalL The

struggle against Chicago Boy. Both dog3
were tired from the work they had re
ceived In the fifth round. Up and down
the field they ran the hare, unable to
overtake, it. Two relief dogs were re
leased, but were not fast enough. Thfe
struggle was so prolonged that Chicago
Boy finally fell from exhaustion. Talk

which was a large one, cheered the own
ers and dogs as they, came oft the field.

Play was rather light on the tennis
courts of the California Club yesterday
and mostly confined to singles. R.^Engles
and Harry Melone, two crack players
from Stockton, participated in some very
good matches with the local men. Their
play showed Improvement. Engles beat
Charles Kuehn in straight sets, the score
in his favor being 6â3, 6â4. Melone played
a match with Sidney Salisbury, who.
however, proved too strong for him. The
latter took two straight sets, 6â2, 6â0.
The Stockton men are more skillful in
doubles than In singles, as the showing
they made against Salisbury and Kuehn
demonstrates.. The former came within
an ace of winning the match, but the ex
perience of their opponents finally enabled
them, to pull out the match. The score in
favor of Kuehn and Salisbury was 3â6,
7-5, 6â2.
Other matches resulted as follows: W.
A. Worthington beat J. Gibson, 6â1, 6â0,
6â2, 6â0; Frank Stringham beat Chet

2â6, 6â2, and G. N. Armsby beat C. Bent
ley, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, 4â6.
George Whitney and Joe Daily played a
special doubles match ..with Harold
Crowell and W. B. Collier at San Rafael
yesterday. The champion and crack pro
fessional proved much too strong for their
opponents, whom they defeated five
straight sets, three of them being, love
sets. The score in favor of Whitney and
Daily- was 6â0, 6â0, 6â3, 6â4, Gâ 0. George
Whitney's terrific driving was the feature
of the match and was mainly responsible
for the drubbing administered to Collier
and Crowell.

NAVAL MILITIA HOLDS ITS ANNUAL
STATE SHOOT AT SHELL MOUND PARK
WHEN THE NAVAL MEN DRIFTED ABREAST THE TARGETS AT SHELL MOUND.
The fight this year will not center
around the president, as both nominating
tickets have but one man in viewâWil
liam Greer Harrison, the incumbent. The
men who serve with him will make a dish
of bones of contention over which tha
"scrap" will rage. There is a younger
element In the club bristling for dlreo
torate honors, and they will oppose men
on the present board on the grounds of
age and inactivity. "William Greer Har
rison, John Elliott, John Hammersmith,
Henry Russ and one or two others are
thoroughly acceptable to both partisans
and will be nominated on both tickets.
Over the other officers there will prob
ably be a strong fight, and the result of
the election of the nominating commit
tee will tell whether the present board
will be named again or the names of sev
eral new members be placed on the tick
et along with the few chosen by both
factions.
What attitude President Harrison will
take in the matter is cause for specula
tion. Last year he named his entire
board, and not a breath of opposition
was raised against him. If he should
happen to take the same stand this year
there is no telling what might happen.
His term has been the most successful
known to the club since the O'Farrell
street days, and he has been allowed full
sway. Should the opposition show any
strength to-morrow evening the meeting
will develop Into a lively one. At the
present time the name of Harrison in the
Olympic Club stands for a species of sa
vior. What his part in the proceedings
will be is the subject of much conjecture
and anxiety among the opposition. : ;_
In the gymnasium of the Olympic Club
to-morrow evening 1 the members will meet
to elect a nominating committee which
will name the regular ticket for the Sep
tember election. There may and there
may not be some fun when the Olym
pians forgather on this occasion, as thero
.will be two tickets In the field, each eager
'for victory.

KIXIiED BY A TBAHT
AT SHELL MOTOTD
WASHINGTON, July 4.â Commissioner
Terkes of the Internal Revenue Bureau
has received a letter from a grain , com
pany in the Northwest asking whether
the memoranda of sales' of farmers'
products ; on an . exchange or board of
trade are exempt from tax by the amend
ment to paragraph two of schedule "A"
of the amended war revenue act of March
2,-1901. The writer assumes that it never
was the intention of the law that farmers
and others selling actual- grain should pay
a tax and that, it applies only to those
who sell "futures" without ever intending
their delivery. The writer refers especial
ly to sales of grain "to arrive," and states
that is the trade which he thinks should
be exempt from* tax. In reply the Com
missioner rules Â¦ that ' grain sold on a
Board of Trade or Exchange "to arrive"
may be exempt from tax if. at the time of
sale the grain is on a vessel, boat or car
and in actual course of transportation, but
if the sale is made before the grain has
been shipped, or if the grain has arrived
at its destination,. the exemption does not
apply. In order, to .'determine the fact
whether | merchandise sold is Â¦ actually in
course of transportation at the time of
sale, a .bill. of. lading is Indispensably
necessary.- In case a bill of lading cannot
be conveniently furnished to accompany
the memorandum of v sale, a certified copy
may be used instead of the original. .

spondent, of the Times telegraphs at
length an interview he has had with Gen

States army, who is now in Vienna on
his way from â¢ Russia, wliere he visited
his daughter.
"General Grant takes a hopeful view of
the . speedy pacification of the Philip
pines," says the correspondent, "although
there is no question- in his opinion that
the humane- principles now governing the
conduct of the military operations great
ly increase the difficulties of suppressing
guerrilla warfare.
"He is convinced from a political stand
point that severity is not desirable, the
delay occasioned by generosity being
more than compensated for by the better
feeling among the native population." '
General Grant, according to the corre
spondent, is now going to Manila.

Identity of Woman Who Attempted
Suicide on Train Fully Established.
REDDING, Aug. 4.â Mrs. Cora Hilton Is
the true name of the woman who at
tempted suicide on the Overland train ar
riving yesterday, but the cause which led
her to make the rash attempt is still un
explained. She arrived by the Shasta -x
press to-night and was met at the depot
by "Prince" Pollock, the man -whose name
was signed to a telegram found in the wo
man's possession when an attempt was
made' to establish her identity.
Pollock is a merchant here, a son of
J. K. Pollock of Yreka, and Mrs. Hilton
was in his employ about a month ago.
The husband of Mrs. Hilton is an operator
in the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company at Shady Run on the mountain
division, between Sacramento and
Truckee. About a year ago Hilton was in
the service of .the company .at Keswlck
and later at Redding. The period of his
employment here was brief.
Mrs. Hilton's railroad ticket read from
Emigrant Gap to bedding, the direct
route being by -way of Sacramento. Why
Mrs. Hilton continued on to Oakland in
stead of coming direct to Redding is as
much a mystery here as the motive which
impelled her to seek to end her life. Mrs.
Hilton is now a- guest at the "Webb Room
ing House In this city apparently fully re
covered from the effects of the dose of
chloral with which she sought to end her
life.
No news was received to-day from the

OAKLAND, Aug. 4.â Pretty Mrs.
Cora Hilton of Redding, whose
journey to the Shasta County town
was interrupted yesterday by her
strange attempt at suicide ln a
Pullman car, threw more mystery .about
herself by suddenly leaving the Receiving
Hospital ward this morning, declaring she
would resume her trip north by the morn
ing train. . , t
â¢ The hospital attendants discovered their
patient fully dressed and ready to depart
at 6 o'clock. To their inquiries as to her
condition, the mysterious brunette calmly
replied that she had decided to go home,
and that she was fully capable now of
caring for herself, a statement which, the
nurses said, was fully verified by her ap
pearance. They were astonished that their
patient should have -revived so suddenly
from the effects of the drug. which had
overcome her the previous night. The
drastic medical treatment her condition
rendered necessary was enough of.itself to
have debilitated any ordinary mortal.
But Mrs. Hilton of Redding was as fresh
and blooming at 6 o'clock this morning as
if she had not a care on her mind, nor a
physical ailment to give her the slightest
cause for depression.
Mrs. Hilton was dumb to all queries con
cerning herself or her reasons for taking
poison. She only reiterated her desire to
leave the hospital in time to catch the
morning northbound train. There was no
good reason why she should be detained,
so the hospital attaches discharged their
mysterious patient and she headed imme
diately for Sixteenth-street station. The
railroad hands about the depot recollected
subsequently that a dashing young wo
man, brunette, with a pair of sparkling
eyes set in a pretty face boarded the out
bound overland for the north.
"It's the 'queerest case I ever ran up
against." was Steward Harry Borchert's
comment to-day. "The woman appeared
to be in the most serious condition. But
we could not get a word from her as to
what she had done until we pressed her
with questions about possible pofson she
might have taken. "When the doctor said
â¢Chloral' she nodded her head affirmative
ly and then we went to work.
"But every effort we made to learn
something about her and her relatives
MRS. CORA HILTON IN REDDING.
That settled tho question of Identity,
but as to all else concerning herself she
departed without supplying a word of in
formation. Â¦ I i
It was only by the finding in her small
hand satchel of two telegrams addressed
to Mrs. Cora Hilton from Redding and
the fact that her railroad ticket was from
that town that a trace of her. identity was
uncovered. When she was called by that
name Mrs. Hilton lost her self-control for
an instant, and in a surprised tone said:
"How do you know who I am?"
was hopeless. " AVe were anxious to get
some sort of a clew, because in the event
of a fatal .termination of the case we
would have had a chance to notify people
who might have been interested in her."

MINERS STARVE

The Jerome union has not yet sanc
tioned the strike but is expected to do so
to-morrow. Only about 200 men are left
at work and they are likely to quit at
any time. The United Verde is doubtless
the greatest copper producer in the world
and its value is estimated at $100,000,000. It
is said to be paying profits of $1,000,000 per
month.
Such was the reply to-day of Senator
W. A. Clark to the demands of the strik
ers at his great United Verde mine at
Jerome. - Clark reached Jerome yesterday
and was met at the train by a committee
of miners, who presented the demands
of the emeltermen and other above-ground
workers in the big copper producer. Clark
requested until to-day to consider the
matter, but in the meantime about 700
men stopped work.
To-day when his answer was given to
the waiting throng of men, word was Im
mediately sent to the workmen below
ground and 1000 more men Are on the
strike list. There is no doubt that Clark
will adhere to his decision, and the min
ers are just as emphatic in their declara
tions that they can stand it as long as
Clark. It is understood by a dispatch to
night to the Republican that Clark in
tends bringing in men from his Montana
mines.

At the Arlington Hotel to-nigrht it was
stated that Special Agent Burns had de
parted and it was surmised that he had
taken a train for San Francisco. The
several men who were working with him
are still in town.
The very first thing the detectives did
vas to probe into the life of Dimmick
from the time he came to Santa Barbara
as a boy. Men who knew the former
chief clerk of the mint were interviewed,
and a great mass of information was col
lected.
After obtaining as much Information as
he desired in this regard Burns visited
the residence of Judge Paul R. Wright,
the father-in-law v of Dimmick, and at
Â¦whose home Mrs. Dimmick is at present
Flaying. The purpose of this visit was
made known to-nierht. when Judge Wright
admitted that a search of, the premises
had been made by the Government offi
cers, presumably to ascertain if any sacks
of gold were in the house. Judge Wright
declared that this search had been futile.
N'o pold was found. Judge Wright assured
the agents that there could be no reason
able ground for suspicion against his son
in-law, and declared that he is confident
nn Fhadow of guilt can attach to the
lirrocr chief clerk.

of their efforts were directed toward find

Burns and his associaties have used every
means to conceal the real purpose of their
visit, and they declined absolutely to hold
converse with newspapermen. Burns is
not in town to-night, and It is said that
he has gone to San Francisco. The men

they propose to stay for some time.
When William J. Burns came here a

Government gave minimum quantities in the

ST. PETERSBURG, July 22.â A trav

queerest, diseases known to medical
science, and is one of the camp followers
of -the famine which is not officially ad
mitted to exist in this district.
In correspondence from here mention
has been made from time to time of the
drought which visited many, though not
large, districts of Russia last year, and
of the efforts made by the Government to
alleviate suffering resulting from it. The
Ministry of the Interior repeatedly de
clared the famine had been conquered,
food had been distributed and seed corn
provided. Â¦ .,
The necessity for private benevolence
was reluctantly admitted at one time in
the winter, but later . the existence of
severe want was denied. Newspapers here
received during the last few months con
tain occasional letters depicting the situ
ation in anything but the rosy
colors which the Government organs used.
The Government answered by reca
pitulating what had been done and
repeating former assertions that all
was as well as could be expected, and then
the newspapers received a secret circular
forbidding further mention of the subject.
The existence of famine was an incon
venient fact at a time when negotiations
were pending for foneign loans. Access
to the famine districts was made difficult
for non-residents and the charity
workers who were not directly under the
control of the State were sent to their
homes and the agencies they had created
were placed under the Red Cross. These

If you see a woman or a man -with luxu-
riant, glossy hair you may be sure neither
has dandruff to amount to anything. In
nearly every case where women and men
have "thin, brittle hair they owe it to dan-
druff. There, are hundreds of preparations
that "claim" to cure dandruff, but not one
but Newbro's Herpicide tells you that
dandruff Is the result of a germ burrow-
ing into the scalp, and that permanent
cure of dandruff and Its consequent falling
and baldness can only be had by killing
the germ: and there is no other prepara-
tion that will destroy that germ but New-
bro's Herpicids. "Destroy the cause, you
remove the effect."

The society which he Instituted did not con
fine itself to reclaiming from . evil Â¦ the . people
of Europe, but spread its good work into the
l^ew World. It filled the , whole , church with
its presence, and operation. When the society
was organized the tide of corruption, spoliation
and vice was stayed and victory rested with
the church. The influence and achievements
of the Society of Jesus are felt in every. field
of beneficent endeavor, in science, in literature,
in missionary labors among the heathens and
ln training the youth. ; -
Kings . were striving: to usurp the preroga
tives of the Pope, nobles were plundering and
desecrating the churches, good men .were scan
dalized by the abuses which had crept into re
ligion, while bad men were seeking to profit
by the result. Spoliation of church, civil cor
ruption' and defiance i were . everywhere ram
pant. The need of the hour was for a . master
mind to organize and a> general to sustain
and direct Such a man St. Ignatius proved
himself to be. . . ;

The feast of St. Ignatius was celebrated
yesterday morning at St. Ignatius Cathe
dral by one of' the -most impressive re
ligious services ever held Â¦ ln this city.
When Father J. P. Freidan ascended the
altar to commence the singing of the sol
emn high mass the vast edifice was
crowded from the chancel rail to the outer
doors. In honor of the occasion the altar
was beautifully decorated with ,'. flowers
and ferns. The music, which was under
the direction of Dr. O'Conhell, was one of
the features of the service. Never were
the sacred hymns â¢ of the church religion
more beautifully rendered.
The Rev. Father J. P. Freidan acted as
celebrant, with the Rev. Father .R. Bell
as deacon and the Rev. Father Landry as
sub-deacon. The Rev. Father J. Culligan
ably officiated as master of ceremonies.
The Rev. Father Smith of the Paulist
Fathers preacned an eloquent sermon on
the life and achievements of St. Ignatius,
patron saint of St. Ignatius Cathedral and
College, in the cause of Christ. He then
described the wonderful accomplishments
of , the Jesuit society, which was founded
by St. Ignatius, in the propagation of the
Catholic religion throughout the world. '
In the first part .of .the sermon Father
Smith dwelt on the personal history of the
saint, his early experience as a soldier
and his final conversion to God through
the perusal of pious books. He spoke of
his life as a priest and how, after a long
course of study and devotion, he founded
the Society of Jesus. .- - j Â¦.

At the Columbia Theater to-night

and popular players, Charles Richman
and Margaret Anglin. who will appear in
their original roles of Sir Daniel Carteret
and Mrs. Dane, respectively.
The "farcical" romance suits the Neill
Company's capacities to a nicety. Indi

course, does Litterley and does it with a
happy, heavy, English swing that suits
the role to a T. Donald Bowles sur

xne Enterprise was formerly the British
steamship St George and a few years aj^o
was in the Australian passenger trade.
Her last foreign owner. H. Deederischen
of Kiel. Germany, sent her to Cuba during
the war with a cargo of coal and ehe went
ashore in a fog. almost on the exact spot
on which General Shafter landed his
troops. She was got off and sold to Amer
ican parties, who repaired her, changed
her name to Enterprise and cot an Amer
ican registry for her. She is 2593 tons gross
burden, 222 feet, ft inches long, 35 feet 8
Inches hr-m. 25 feet 6 inches deep anÂ«l
was built In 38S2 at Newcastle-on-Tyne.
She is a Frriendld rea T>oat, a large carrier
unfl Fneedy, as her run of seventy-two
days from Baltimore shows. She and the
>Furr!on Bailed together for this port, but
the Entcrr>Â»1?e r-eat her rival ten days.
The Hilo trade with San Francisco con
tinued to grow and soon another vessel
was required, so Captain Matson bought
the bark Santiago. Next he purchased the
ship Rhodcrick Dhu and not only changed
her into a bark, but also dropped the "h"
from her first name, and she is now the
Roderick Dhu. About this time the Lur
line was sold and soon afterward the
four-masted ship Falls of Clyde was
bought and changed into a four-masted
bark. A month or so ago the ship Mariqn
Chilcott was added to the fleet and last
of all the steamer Enterprise. The Marion
Chilcott was formerly the British sWd
Kllbrannan. She went ashore In Puget
Sound, but was got oft by Barneson &
Chilcott of Seattle and put" under the
American flag. Her new owner will
change her Into a bark after she- makes
one voyagre.
Back in the eighties a 200-ton vessel
was considered big for the Hilo trade,
and In 18S7. when Captain Matson . built
the brig Lurline, everybody laughed at him
and wondered where he would get freight
enough to fill her. There was no trouble
about the freight question, however, and
in a few years the Lurline was not big
enough for the trade, so the bark Annie
Johnson was bought and put on the run.-
The latter was formerly the British bark
Ada Iredale, but while coming here from
Australia with a cargo of coal caught fire
and burned to the water's edge. She
drifted ashore on Tahiti and was rebuilt
by the late Andrew Crawford, and put
under the American flag:. Since coming
under the Matson flag she has never met
with a ralsha*}.
Captain William Matson has purchased
the American steamship Enterprise, and
in a few days she will begin loading' for
Hllo. The intention Is to' keep her perma
nently in this trade and add other steam
6hips to the line as the occasion warrants.
Hilo is to have a regular steamship serv

DOAN ACCUSES
STATE OFFICIAL
Says President of Barber
Examiners Leads
Boy cotters.
Trouble Occurs at Offending
Shop and a Noisy Picket
Is Arrested.
There was further trouble yesterday in
front ! of the non-union barber shop of
Goldstein & Doan, 105 Fourth street, the
place attacked - by a mob of strikers on
Saturday night, when Emll Berringer
was shot in tjie arm by one of the pro
prietors.
Louis Regan was arrested by Officer J.
E. Cottle yesterday and charged with
disturbing the peace and malicious mis
chief. Regan has been on picket duty in
front of the offending barber shop, and it
is alleged that he was one of the prime
movers in Saturday night's riot. He is
the man who was arrested on Saturday
night by Officer Brown, but who was res
cued by the mob. . Yesterday Regan re
turned to picket duty in front of Goldstein
& Doan's shop and, though repeatedly
warned by the proprietors to keep the
peace, he continued to make himself ob
noxious. .The result I was that a crowd
congregated and police assistance was
sought. The police dispersed the crowd
and hustled Regan oft to the Hall of Jus
tice. He was released on $40 bail, fur
nished by a Police Court attorney.
A, Doan, one of the proprietors of the
boycotted shop, claims that J. J. Calish,
president of the State Board of Barber
Examiners, recently appointed by Gov
ernor Gage, created a disturbance in front
of the shop yesterday and that he (Doan)
will file charges against Calish with the
Governor. In speaking of the matter last
night Doan said : â¢
"I shall make a complaint against Calish
to the Governor of the State. Calish is a
State official and this morning he came
down to our shop and Â¦ helped to disturb
the. peace. He did not know who I was,
but when I told him he boasted in the
presence of two police officers .that he
had bailed out the man Regan and that
Regan and the other pickets had been
placed in front of our shop by him. He
said in the hearing of the officers, 'those
men are my pickets.' . I shall ask the
Governor whether a State official has any
right to take part in any labor troubles
in this manner. My partner and myself
propose to fight this affair to a finish.
"I .was forced out of the union because
I refused to allow, the leaders to dictate
to me how I should spend my money.
They fined me for patronizing a boycotted
restaurant. Last week I was told that 500
teamsters would come down some night
and wreck our shop. They tried to do it
Saturday night. In justice to the team
sters I would say that . I don't think the
mob on Saturday was composed entirely
of their men. There were a lot of hood
lums in the crowd.
"Calish, the president of the Board of
Barber Examiners, is responsible for the
trouble at our place. He admits that the
pickets were his men, and they have
caused trouble right along. If the police
cannot protect us in our business we will
take other steps so that we can conduct
our affairs without molestation."
Barbers Liable to a Fine.
The State Board of Barber Examiners
has received an opinion from Attorney
General Ford to the effect that the ninety
days allotted to barbers for examination
and registration has expired, and that
hereafter any barber caught working
without a license is liable to arrest and
a fine of not less than $10 and not more
than $100. The board will remain in the
city but one week longer and . will then
go to Alameda County. During the re
maining week, for the accommodation of
the barbers who have not yet received
their licenses, the board will be in session
from 8 to 10 o'clock each night.
Body Found in Vacant Lot.
The body of an unknown man, from all
appearances that of a laborer, was found
In a vacant lot at Franklin and Eddy
streets last night by two boys. Beside
the body was found a half-empty bottle
of an odorless liquid, the composition of
which will have to be determined by
chemical analysis and which is supposed
to have produced death. The body was
that of a man about 60 years of age. five
feet nine inches In height, weight 150
pounds. The clothing consisted of a black
fedora hat, brown duck coat and striped
trousers. All the front teeth of the dead
man except three in the upper jaw were
missing. The body^was removed to the
Morgue by Deputies Meehan and Brown.
Good Picture's.
What people want are good pictures and
plenty of them. Pictures have ceased to
be a luxury. They are a necessity. To
day no house is furnished that lacks pic
tures. They are as much of a necessity
as carpets on the floor. It Is our duty
and pleasure to furnish good pictures at
moderate prices. Sanborn, Vail & Co., 711
