Promoter Porter Tells of Progress of
Gigantic Movement in Which
Thousands of California!!*
Are Concerned-
The announced purpose of the enter
prise is to purchase oil properties, oil
stocks, pipe lines, tanks, pumping plants,
oil contracts and other property necessary
for carrying on an extensive oil business.
The signers of the agreement have
pledged themselves to use their best en
deavors to transfer to the new corpora
tion'to be formed, with capital stock of
not less than $73,000,000 nor more than $100,'
000.000. the properties and stocks of the
oil companies and individuals represented
by them; and to seek to induce other com
panies to take like action. The new cor
poration-will have the right for seven
months to purchase all the properties un
der an agreement of sale or option or
The present plan of combination . has
been under consideration for some time.
Partial reports of the details have been
made from time to time. Modifications of
the provisions submitted to the oil com
panies' directors have been made and
amendments have been Inserted to meet
wise suggestions on the part of those di
rectly concerned as owners of producing
properties. There are several provisions
that are of more than ordinary interest
in the plan as it now stands with a long
list of signatures attached. These are
summarized for general information.
Flan Includes Purchase.
With the assured co-operation of four
fifths of the actual producers and the fa
vorable attitude of the remainder, the
prospects yesterday seemed very bright.
The names of the companies that have
signed the agreement were not made pub
lic by Mr. Porter. There are Influences
that ' naturally are hostile to the move
that the oil producers are making in their
own behalf. Mr. Porter declines to speak
of these, but the facta are well known.
Positively Mr. Porter declares that tha
combination forming and so far pro
gressed toward perfection among the pro
ducers of oil has no relation to the Stan
dard Oil Company. "It is for the pro
ducers' benefit and for them only. That
is the exact fact."
Pour-Fifths Agree.
W. 8. Porter is the promoter of tae com
bination now in formation. His residence
Is in Los Angeles, but he has come to
San Francisco to be in do3e touch with,
the owners of oil properties in tlie Kern
County fields, a majority of whom are
engaged in business here and have the
headquarters of their oil companies in
this city. Various propositions have been
entertained by the producers of oil to fur
nish a' betterment of conditions. A meet-
Ing was held at the Palace Hotel some
time ago, where a plan for marketing
through a committee was partly perfect
ed, but nothing definite resulted- Sine*
then the market has become even morÂ»
unsatisfactory than when, necessity
prompted the first conference of the owsw
ers of oil properties. Many wells in thÂ©
Kern County districts have been shut
down. Development has fallen off, and
there would have been a more marked
decline in that direction if there were, not
many lessees, who are compelled by the
terms of their contracts to complete &
certain number of wells in a fixed time.
Vigorous measures have become neces
sary. W. S. Porter, who has been en
gaged in the business of producing oil In
this State and who has also been con
nected with the sale of supplies for tha
oil fields, is the man upon whom the pro
ducers have pinned their hopes.
Success is about to crown the efforts of
the oil producers of California, to form a.
great corporation, with capital stock oC
$75,000,000' to $100,000,000,. for the purpose of
protecting and promoting their interests.
Eighty per> cent of the oil producers of
the Kern River and McKlttrick districts
have, according to XV. S. Porter, already
signed the preliminary agreement. Not
one producing oil company in the Kern
River and McKittrick districts has failed
to make available the information needed
as the starting point for organization-
There is only one factor that can inter
fere with success as the matter now
stands, which is the refusal of companies
to accept the valuations placed on their
respective properties by the experts,
whose rating will go far toward deter
mining the basis of standing in the hftge
combine. Two considerations cause the
oil producers to believe that success la
near. One is the general friendly attitude
of the scores of oil companies in that re
gard; the other is the general recognition
on all sides that without organisation the
oil industry of the State is helpless to
raise itself from the slough of low prices
and unprofitable production into which, It
has fallen a3 the result of too sharjTcoiar
petitien in markstlns,- Â¦-Â¦'â¢Â¦ â Â¦ .

Xlcarasuan forces, and Colombia will ap
peal to lie fnlted States to take steps
for the preservation of her sovereignty
over the isthmus. This is the Important
development to-day in the situation in
Xorthern South America- Official infor
mation has reached "Washington and will
be officially communicated to the State
Department showing that the situation
existing to-day is far graver than is gen
erally believed. Ecuador and Nicaragua
are allied by secret treaty with Venezu
ela, and it Is possible that the projected
Invasion into Panama is to be accompa
nied bj a movement on the eastern boun
<isLry of Colombia by Venezuela. One of
the dispatches received In a responsible
Quarter reads:
"Xo serious internal conditions exist in
tie Stats of Panama. The Government
of Colombia is about to preserve the traf
fic across the isthmus. Colombian offi
cials fear the arrival of expeditions an
nounced from Nicaragua and Ecuador."
Assistance Is Asked.
This dispatch Is partly explained by an
other message â¢which comes from Call,
capital of the State of Cauca, and reads:
"Invasion from Ecuador -with vessels
and supplies requires prompt action on
the part of Colombia. The Governor of
Cauca t^^irs the situation so serious that
he has asked the Government to send to
his assistance the gunboats which are at
Panama. The Governor of Cauca seems
to think that Panama is the object of
the Invading force, though it may attack
TTmaco or Buena Ventura."
The United States Trill not permit Pan
ama to become a" scene of hostilities. Un
der the treaty signed by Secretary Caas
and "W. Herran. then Minister to tha i
United States and father of the present
Charge d' Affaires of the Colombian lega
tion, the "United States positively guaran
teed free traffic across the isthmus and
the sovereignty of Colombia over the isth
rcus. The provisions cf the treaty must
be strictly enforced, and the Intention of
tbo United States is to see that it is done.
The gunboat Machias Is at Colon. The
gunboat Ranger arrived to-day at Pan
ama, and her commander reported the
situation was quiet on the Panama side.
The battleship Iowa is expected to reach
Panama either to-morrow or Saturday.
Uncle Sam Beady to Act.
The United States will thus have a force
sufficiently strong to support any prohibi
tion it may give to Nicaragua, Ecuador
cr.d Venezuela not to disembark troops
en the isthmus.
In some quarters there Is a disposition
to believe that the Ecuadoran Govern
ment is not behind the invasion reported
from Cali, and it is pointed out that the
declarations of Plaza, President of Ecua
dor, who assumed his present office Â¦ on
Sunday last, have strongly favored
friendly relations with Colombia. *^It Is
thought possible that the organizers of
filibustering expeditions who were active
during Alfaro's administration' have
feared that to remain longer in Ecuador
Â¦would be to subject themselves to arrest
and their supplies to seizure, and they
have therefore immediately carried out
their plans of invading Colombia. Confl
uence is expressed that if an invasion Is
made at any point in the State of Cauca
Colombian troops will have no difficulty
in routine the invaders.
Colombia Accepts Mediation.
Senor Herran. Colombian Charge d'Af
faires, declines to discuss the Colombian
situation In any way before making prop
er representations to the State Depart
ment. Officials of the department admit
ted to-day that they have received a per
sonal communication from Minister Sllva
of Colombia, accepting in the name of his
Government the mediation of the United
States. It appears that before this Gov
ernment made its tender of good offices
Colombia learned of the reports that.it
contemplated taking such action, and
v.'ired to Dr. Silva stating that it would
be glad to authorize the friendly Inter
vention of the United States. Colombia
; as already lost^ 40,000 men in the present
: evolution, and she sees no cause for per
mitting further losses of life, though she
is confident, In case of conflict, of her
ability to defeat her opponents.
The official reply of the Bogota Govern
ment has not yet been received, but there
is no doubt that it will be in line with the
acquiescence of Dr. Silva. The question
before the United States, besides the-para
mount one of preventing a violation of
*he neutrality of the isthmus, is to Induce
the Castro administration to change its

. Chairman Eagan said that the commit
tee had not had time to give proper con
sideration to the rutfes and order of bust-
Some days ago Hllker received a nomi
nation for Supervisor at the Socialist par
ty convention. Less announced that the
executive committee had for this reason
discredited him as a delegate and- selected
some one else In his stead. His explana
tion did not suit Hilker, who claimed the
right to act as a delegate. Chairman
Ryan ordered the sergeant at arms to
clear the floor of all who were notNIele
gates, and Hilker retired.
Thomas Eagan, ; chairman of the com
mittee on permanent organization and or
der of business,. presented what he called
a partial report. The report recommend
ed the selection of Joseph Millmore of
the Teamsters' Union' for permanent
chairman. I. Less of the Barbers' Union
for vice chairman. William J. Wynn and'
B. P. Byers as secretaries, and T. J. Ma
honey or the Longshore Lumbermen, John
Desmond of the Teamsters and James
Wilson of the Boxmakers and Sawyers as
sergeants at arms.
The report of the committee on creden
tials, which will be found elsewhere, was
read by <;he secretary, the delegates go
ing to the rear of the hall and taking
seats in front as their names were called.
After a few minor corrections all but one,
who claimed to be a delegate, was seated.
That was Henry Hllker, who had once
been named by the barbers.

order to conclude the business, by to
morrow Â¦ night. - . /'. ,
Chairman Millmore 4hen proceeded to
name the committee on platform. Each
union - : was represented by one delegate,
making a committee. of sixty-eight mem
bers. These were instructed to meet im
mediately . after adjournment and con
tinue in session until they had com
pleted a platfrom for presentation as the
first order of business this morning.
The committee met last night at the
headquarters of the. Machinists' Union,
at Sixth and Shipley streets, and consid
ered the different planks to be submitted.
Up to a latff hour the work had not been
completed, but it was said that the sense
of every member was for a strong dec
laration of union principles, in which the
local situation will be thoroughly re
viewed.
A few minutes after 10 o'clock I. Less,
' chairman of the executive committee,
called the convention to order, depositing
a large package of papers on the speak
. er's desk. Less is- credited with having
. been instrumental in organizing the party.
The meetings of the executive committee
have been held in the office of the Jour
neymen Barbers' Union, of which he Is
- the secretary.
Less had fairly started on his speech,
â¢ when he was interrupted by a suggestion
I from one of the delegates that a tempor
ary sergeant at arms be appointed. Thom
Â¦ as Easen and James Bowlan urged that
â¢ this fce done at once, in order to clear the
floor cf any who might not be entitled to
â¢seats as delegates. Others added their
- voice to the matter.
"That is out of order," ruled Less. "If
there is less 'rag chewing" and 'hot air 1
' we will get along quicker. I did intend
â¢ to make a speech, but as the convention
does not seem to be in temper for it I
will call for nominations for temporary
chairman."
The delegates, however, insisted on the
Â¦ nomination of a sergeant at arms, and T.
..J. Bowlan named J. T. Mahoney of the
Teamsters' Union. He was elected by ac
clamation, and forthwith vigorously dis
â¢ charged his duties.
"This convention is Â¦ called to nominate
a full municipal ticket," continued Less.
' "As wage earners by binding ourselves
; together we may get better times. We
. may elect our own officers, make our own
laws and reap the benefits of unionism."
A. Logan of the Paper-hangers' and
; Decorators' Union was the first man rec
ognized, and he placed Less in nomina
tion. The nomination was seconded by
â¢ J. M. Murphy- of the Machine Helpers'
. Union.
"I. Less is nominated for temporary
chairman," exclaimed Less as chairman
â¢ of the executive committee. "Are there
..any more nominations?" â¢
Bowlan again took the floor and in a
lengthy speech named Timothy Ryan of
the Brotherhood of Teamsters. J. E Par
ry of the Plledrivers' and Bridge Builders'
Union and delegates all over the hall from
. the City Front Federation, Allied Print
ing Trades and Iron Trades Council sec
onded the nomination of Ryan.
A vote was taken by calling the roll.
As delegate after delegate recorded his
vote for Ryan, Less! face wore a look of
pained surprise.* Nearly. seventy-five votes
. had been cast for Ryan- and about six for
Less, when the latter withdrew in favor
of his opponent i* â¢
B. P. Byers of the Shipbuilders' Union
and W. J. Wynn of the Machinists' Union
were chosen secretaries, both represent
- Ing the different, lines into .which the con
vention had resolved itself on the chair
manship contest. ,
On the suggestion of- the chair, a vice
i chairman -was named. - Thomas Denehy
and William McCabe -declined the nomi
nation, and G. E, Aubertine, who had
Â¦ been the right hand man of Less In the
organization of the party, was elected.
A recess of thirty minutes was taken to
appoint committees on credentials,- rules'
and order of business. It was decided to
defer the naming- of the committee on
.platform and resolutions until the other
committees - had reported. At 11:30 a. m.

DEFEAT OF LESS FOS
TEffPOBABY CHAIRMAN
pÂ»-rpoHE municipal convention of the
I Union Labor party, which, was
I called to order at Metropolitan
}1 Temple yesterday forenoon, con
sists of 2S0 delegates, representing
68 trades unions. The convention is' cer
tainly free and untrammeled. There is
no lack of talkers and no lack of earnest
ness or vigor in the talk. In many re
spects the assemblage recalls to mind the
"Worklngmen's convention which, met at
Humboldt Hall a quarter of a century
ago and nominated "William P. White,
father of the late Stephen M. "White, for
Governor of California.
At the sessions of the convention yes
terday several of the epeakers displayed
ready knowledge of parliamentary tac
tics and familiarity with the usages of
deliberative bodies, but no special oppor
tunity was presented for any member to>
exhibit superior Qualities of leadership.
Thomas Eagan, J. S. Parry, A. S. Cridge,
Joseph Millmore. G. F. Aubertine, Thom
as Kj r an and others evinced knowledge of
convention customs and claimed the at
tention of.i'punger members when they
addressed the body. The delegates are In
earnest. They purpose making radical
nominations and get behind the ticket
with the resolute purpose of making: a
etrons fight at the ballot box. It is a- fact
that one-half of the unions In the city
failed to eend delegates to the convention,
but the names on the roll established by
the committee on credentials represent
active workingmen in many fields of in
dustrial life. In the broad sense it is not
a popular convention, but it is a class as
semblage of character and vigor repre
eentative of laboring men who have faith
In the virtue of the ballot. It was noted
that the managers made no display of
the American flag on the convention stage
or elsewhere in the halL
Immediately on the convening of the
delegates a elate was smashed and a pro
gramme swept aside. The men were sus
picious of self-created leadership. They
. suspected and had good cause for the
suspicion that a programme had been pre
pared for the nomination of J. M. Burnett
. for Mayor and I. Less fo-r Public Admin
istrator, and as a measure of rebuke re
fused to make Ltess the chairman of the
convention.
The delegates to the convention are men
â¢who are likely to be swayed and influ
enced to impulsive action by the notes of
fervent, impassioned oratory. It is quito
likely to happen that the deliberate Judg
ment of the body will not prevail In the
making of the ticket or the framing of
the platform.
Long before the hour set for the as
sembling of the convention knots of
delegates began gathering in front of Met
ropolitan Temple. In true convention
style, they discussed in groups plans for
the day. Among the crowd were some
who had borne the brunt of battle in other
campaigns at which perhaps there might
have been less of principle at stake but
more to be gained as able henchmen of
a politician. These men were few hi nnm
ttr and did not make their presence ob
trusive. . . Â¦
Another conspicuous figure in the group
was a perpetual self-nominated candidate
for office, who has run the whole gamut
almost, and been successful in but one
instance. He seeks the nomination for
Mayor this time, and buttonholed each
arriving delegate. While gaining a re
spectful hearing, the claims he presented
did not seem to make much of an im
. pression. Another well-known figure in
- the crowd was a former Superior Judge
whose voice has been raised in many a
â¢ Democratic convention, and who is said
to be seeking a nomination either as Dis
trict Attorney or City and County At
torney.
But . the delegates and the crowd that
* filled the galleries were the most inter
< esting features of the convention. The
, body of the hall was reserved for the del
egates. The gallery seats were occupied
by a large number of workingmen, who
closely watched the proceedings, but
, never attempted to interfere with the reg- <
ular course of proceedings.

the rear of the haJL "He voted at the
last primary election, which Is against all
the rules of this party." . s - â¢ Â¦ .
"I do not claim that the speaker, was
actuated by malice," responded Parry; "I
did not vote at the last â¢ primary ' election
and I am ready to draw my check for
$1000 If any one can prove that I did."
"Mr. Parry's name will not be with

drawn for the amount. Although the bill
itself does not conclusively reveal the
identity, of the persons "shadowed" and
although official information on this point
is not obtainable, it is declared by parties
who claim to know that the "Dr. Râ " re
ferred to In the bill is certainly Dr. H. A.

the State Board of Health and afterward
employed by the United States Marine

chief of the quarantine division of the
'Marine Hospital service, in charge of the
San Francisco bureau. â¢ .
The reason why the names are not given
In full is declared; to be because it is the
practice of the Morse Agancy to insert In
a bill of charges only the initials, as is
evidenced by that designation of thÂ« oper
atives; and further, because of the pos
sible uncomfortable consequences of plac
ing on public record the fact that the
Governor of the State had caused men to
be shadowed who . were not expected to
know they were undergoing that treat
ment. "
The fact that such' a bill has been spe
cially approved by the Governor and sent
to the State Controller with the request
that a warrant be drawn for the amount
has caused much comment about the Cap

as known, that a .bill- against the State
for "shadowing" has ever found thelight

Who can tell the new thoughts that have
been awakened, the ambitions fired and the
high achievements that will be wrought
through this exposition? GentlenJen. let us
ever remember that our interest ik in accord,
not conflict, and that our real eminence rests
In the victories of peace, not those of war.
We hope that all who are represented here
may be moved to higher and nobler efforts for
their own and the world's good and that. out
of this city may come, not only greater com
merce and trade for us all, but more essential
than these, relations of mutual respect, confi
dence and friendship which will deepen and
endure.
With praises and thanksgiving."
In the furtherance of these objects of na
tional interest and concern, you are perform
ing an Important part. This exposition would
have touched the heart of that American
statesman whose mind was ever alert and
thought ever constant for a larger commerce
and truer fraternity of the republics . of tho
new world. His broad American spirit Is felt
and manifested here. He needs no identifica
tion to an assemblage of Americans anywhere,
for the name of Blaine ' is Inseparably-asso
ciated with the pan-American movement which
finds this practical and substantial expression,
and which we all hope will be firmly, advanced
by the Pan-American Congress that assembles
this autumn In the capital of Mexico. The good
work will go on. It cannot be stopped.. These
buildings will disappear, this creation ' of art
and beauty and Industry will perish from sight,
but their ' Influence will remain to
"Make it live beyond its too short living
If, perchance, some of our tariffs are no
longer needed for revenue or to encourage and
protect our industries at home, why should
they not be employed to extend and promote
our markets abroad? Then, too, we have ina
dequate steamship service. New lines of
steamers have already been put In commission
between the Pacific Coast ports of the United
States and those on the western coasts of Mex
ico and Central and South America. . These
should be followed up with direct steamship
lines between the Eastern coast of â¢ the United
States and South American ports. One of the
needs of the times Is direct commercial lines
from our vast fields of product to the fields
of consumption that we have but barely touch
ed. Next In advantage to having the thing
to sell is to have the convenience to carry It
to the buyer. We must encourage our mer
chant marine. We must have more ships. They
must be under the American flag, built and
manned and owned by Americans. These will
not only be profitable in a commercial sense;
they will be messengers of peace and amity
wherever they go. We must build the Isth
mian Â¦ canal, which will unite the two oceans
and give a Etralght line of water communica
tion with the western, coasts of Central and
South America and Mexico. The construction
of a Pacific cable cannot be longer postponed.
Pays Tribute to Memory of Blaine.
Delivers a Masterly Address at the Pan-American Exposition
and Says That the Court of Arbitration Is -the Noblest
Forum for. the Settlement of T Air International Disputes
that this country is in a state of unexampled
Prosperity. The figures are almost appalling.
They show that we are utilizing our fields and
forests and mines and that wÂ« are furnishing
profitable employment to the millions of work
lngmen throughout the United States, bringing
comfort and happiness to their homes and
making it possible to lay by something for old
age and disability. That all the people are
partldpting In this great prosperity Is seen
In every American community ' and shown by
the enormous and unprecedented deposits In
our savings banks. Our duty Is the' care and
security of these deposits, and their safe in
vestment demands the highest integrity and
the best business capacity of those in charge
of these depositories of the people's earnings.
We have a vast and Intricate business, built
up through years of toll and struggle, In
which every part of the country has its stake,
which will not permit of either neglect or of
undue selfishness. No narrow, sordid policy
will subserve it. The greatest skill and wis
dom on the part of the manufacturers and
producers will be required to hold and increase
it. Our industrial enterprises, which have
grown to such great proportions, affect the
homes and occupations of the people and the
welfare of the country. Our capacity to pro
duce has developed so enormously and our
products have so multiplied that the problem
of more markets requires our urgent and im
mediate attention. Only a broad and enlight
ened policy will keep what we have. No other
policy will get more. In these times of mar
velous business energy and gain we ought to
be looking to the future, strengthening the
weak places in our industrial and commercial
r.- s t."- - that we may be ready for any storm
or strain.
Commercial "Wars Aire Unprofitable.
By sensible trade arrangements which will
not interrupt our home production we shall ex
tend the outlets for our increasing surplus. A
system which provides a mutual exchange of
commodities is manifestly essential to the con
tinued healthful growth_of our export trade.
We must not repose in fancied security that
we can forever sell everything and buy little
or nothing. If such a thing were possible it
would not be best for us or for those with
whom we deal. We should take from our cus
tomers such of their products as we can use
without harm to our industries and labor.
Reciprocity Is the natural outgrowth of our
wonderful industrial development under the do
mestic policy now firmly established. What
we produce beyond our domestic consumption
must have a vent abroad. The excess must
be relieved through a foreign outlet and we
should sell everywhere we . can and buy
wherever the buying will enlarge our sales and
productions, and thereby make a greater de
mand for home labor.
The period of exclusiveness is past. The ex
pansion of our trade and commerce Is the
pressing problem. Commercial wars are un
profitable. A policy of good will and friendly
trade relations will prevent reprisals. Re
ciprocity trestles are in harmony with the
spirit of the times; measures of retaliation
are not.
BUFFALO. N. T., Sept. 5.âPresi
dent's day at the Pan-American
Exposition remained clear, with
the temperature sufficiently low
to make the day all that could
be desired. Flags and bunting/ bearing
words of welcome to the President and
expressive of the sentiment which the
great lair Is designed to foster, "Peace
to Pan-America," were profusely In evi
dence.
A detail of police kept the crowd back
from the sidewalk In front of the house
of Mr. Milburn on Delaware avenue,
where the President Is stopping, but those
most eager to catch a glimpse of the
President and Mrs. McKinley indiscrimi
nately invaded the beautiful lawns of the
adjoining residences and some even went
eo far as to climb upon the verandas.
The President and Mrs. McKinley, who
Â¦walked unassisted, emerged at 10 o'clock.
A creat burst of cheers greeted them,
which the President acknowledged by
bowing and raising his hat. The Presi
dent and Mrs. McKinley entered the first
carriage and Mr. Milburn, president of
the exposition, and Mrs. "William Hamlin
of the board of women managers the sec
ond.
An escort of twenty mounted police and
twenty members of the signal corps sur
rounded the two carriages and the cav
alcade set out at a brisk trot for the Lin
coln Parkway entrance to the exposition
grounds. The two carriages were follow
ed by a number of carriages and tally
hos, their occupants blowing fanfares.
At I the entrance to the exposition
grounds the President was met by de
tachments of the Vnlted States marines
and the Seacoast Artillery and the Sixty
flfth and Seventy-fourth X. G. S. N. Y.
regiments. A President's salute of twen
ty-one guns was fired. The President was
at once escorted to the stand erected in
the Esplanade, where probably the great
est crowd ever assembled there greeted
him with ringing cheers. The vast assem
blage oversowed to the Court of Foun
tains. In the stand on each side of the
President were seated many distinguished
men and women, among them represen
tatives of most of the South American
republics. . .
There was almost absojutev quiet when
President Milburn arose and Introduced
the President, as follows^
"Ladles and gentlemen, the President.
The great audience then broke out -with
a mighty cheer, which continued as Presi
dent McKinley advanced to the front or
the stand. It was some minutes before
he was able to proceed. When quiet was
restored, the President spoke as follows:
"Welcomes Foreign Representatives.
President Milburn. Director General Buchan
an. Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen: 1
am glad to be again In the city of Buffalo
and exchange greetings with her people, to
whose generous hospitality I am not a stran
ger and with whose good will I have been
repeatedly and signally honored. To-day 1
have additional satisfaction in meeting and
giving welcome to the foreign representatives
assembled here whose presence and participa
tion in this exposition have contributed in so
marked a degree to its interest and success.
To the commissioners of the Dominion of Can
ada and the British colonies, the French col
onies the republics of Mexico and -of Central
and South America, and the commissioners of
Cuba and Porto Rico, who share with us In
this undertaking, we give the hand of fellow
ship and felicitate with them upon the tri
umphs of art. science, education and manufac
ture which the old has bequeathed to the new
century.
Expositions are the timekeepers of progress.
They record the world's advancement. They
stimulate the energy, enterprise and intellect
of the people and quicken human genius. They
FO into the home. They broaden and brighten
the daily life of the people. They open mightv
rtorehouses of information to the student.
Every exposition, great or small, has helped
to some onward' step. Comparison of ideas
is always educational, and as such instructs
the brain and hand of man. Friendly rivalry
follows, which Is the 6pur to industrial im
provement, the Inspiration to use future In
vention and to high endeavor in all depart
ments of human activity. It exacts a study
of the wants, comforts and even the whims of
the people and recognizes the efficacy of high
quality and new prices to win their favor.
The quest of trade is an Incentive to men
of business to devise, invent. Improve and
economize In the cost of production. Business
life, whether among ourselves or with other
people, is ever a sharp struggle for success.
It will be none the less so In the future.
Without competition we would be clinging to
the clumsy and antiquated processes of farm
ing and manufacture, and the methods of
" business of long ago, and the twentieth century
tu-ould be no further advanced than the eigh
teenth century. But though commercial com
petitors we are, commercial enemies we must
rot be. The Pan-American Exposition has
done its work thoroughly, presenting in its
exhibits evidences of the highest skill and
illustrating the progress of the human fam
ily in the Western hemisphere. This portion
of the earth has no cause for humiliation for
the part it has performed in the march of
civilization. It has not accomplished every
thing; far from It. It has simply done Its
best and without vanity or boastfulness, and
recognizing the manifold achievements of
ethers, it Invites the friendly rivalry of all
the powers in the peaceful pursuits of trade
end commerce and will co-operate with all in
advancing the highest and best interests of
huTnanlty. The wisdom and energy of all the
netiens "are none too great for the world's
work. The success of art, science, industry
end invention Is an International asset and a
common glory. â¢ i
The Telegraph ESEaces Distances.
After all. how near one to the other is every
part of the world. Modern inventions have
brought Into clc*e relation widely separated
peoples and made them better acquainted.
Geographic and political divisions will continue
to exist, but distances have been effaced.
Swift ehips and fast trains are becoming cos
mopolitan. They Invade the fields which a
few years ago were impenetrable. The world's
products are exchanged as never before and
with ever-increasing transportation facilities
come increasing knowledge and trade. Prices
are fixed with mathematical precision by sup
ply and demand. The world's selling prices are
reg'ilated by market and crop reports. We travel
greater distances In a shorter space of time and
v.-ith more ease than was ever dreamed of by
the fathers. Isolation is no longer possible or
drslrable. The same important news Is read,
thouph In different languages, the same day
In all Christendom. The telegraph keeps us
advised of what Is occurring everywhere, and
the press foreshadows, with more or less ac
curacy, the plans and purposes of the nations.
Market prices of products and of securities are
known hourly in every commercial mart, and
the Im-estments of the people extend beyond
their own national boundaries Into the remot
est parts of the earth. Vast transactions are
conducted and international exchanges are
made by the tick of the cable. Every event of
Jnterert is Immediately bulletined. The quick
gathering and transmission of newe. like rapid
transit, are of recent origin and are only made
possible by the genius of the inventor and the
courage of the investor. It took a special.mes
senger of the Government, with every facility
known at . the time of the rapid travel, nine
teen days to go from the city of Washington
to New Orleans with a message to General
Jackson that the war with England had ceased
end a treaty of peace had been signed. How
different now.
We reached General Mile* In Porto Rleo by
cable and he was able through the military
telegraph to stop his army on the firing line
with the messaire that the United States and
Spain had signed a protocol suspending hostili
ties. W* knew almost Instantly of the first
ehots fired at Santiago, and the subsequent
rurrender of the Spanish forces was known at
Washington within less than an hour of its
consummation. The first ship of Cervera's
fleet had hardly emerged from that historic
harbor when the fact was flashed to our capi
ta! and the swift destruction that followed waÂ«
announced Immediately through the wonderful
medium of telegraphy. So accustomed are we
to safe and easy communication with distant
lands that Its temporary Interruption even tn
ordinary times results' in loss and ftseonvenl
enc* We shall never forget the days of
anxious waiting and awful suspense when no
Information . was oennltted to be sent from
Peking and the diplomatic representatives of
the nations In China, cut off from all com
munication Inside and outside of the walled
capital, were surrounded by an angry and mis
puided mob that threatened their lives; nor
the Joy that thrilled the world when a single
message from the Government of the -Lnlted
States brought through our Minister the first
news of the safety of the besieged diplomats.

.The extensive sales in the past- few weeks left us with a great many broken lots.
There are many lines remaining with only two, three and four suits to a pattern. We can-
not ask the regular price for these, suits* when we may not be able, to fit a man with the pat-
tern he desires. Consequently broken assortments must be disposed of quickly. By reducing
the prices we xlear out the broken lines and incidentally impress people with our values.
Remember, that no one- line at this sale contains all sizes, but the suits as a whole
represent every size. There are a great many patterns, as the. suits were collected from the
entire stock. \ . :
A number 'of overcoats are reduced. also for the same reason as the suits.

the geldinij last spring for $300, and as he has
won several races of late the Investment
turned out a good one.
The betting on the race, the free-for-all
trot, was very heavy. The starters were
Boralma, Lord Derby and The Monk As
much as $90,000 went into the pool. Bor
alma was a tremendous favorite before
the start at odds of 3 to 1. His backers
seemed to think he could not lose: Ed

Kid McFadden Gets Decision in the
Seventh Bound on a Foul -by
Smith.
' SACRAMENTO. Sept. 5.â The fight at -
Oak Park to-night between Kid McFad
den and: Solly Smith was considerable of
a fiasco. There was no real fighting
worth mentioning on either side. Smith 1
seemed to think that he 'could do more
effective work butting with his head than
by using his fists, and his methods called
forth much disapproval from the large
crowd of spectators. Smith began foul
ing in the second round and went down I
once without being struck. The referee. I
however, compelled him to fight. The
contest was awarded to McFadden in the
seventh round on a foul by Smith. The
crowd expected to see a good flght, and'
the suspicion was freely expressed that â¢
tne affair had the semblance of a put-up:
Job. A boxing exhibition by Gus Ruhlin
and "Denver" Ed Martin preceded the
contest of the evening.

the money was put down very last.
The word for the second heat was ariven
to an even start, but fifty yards from the
wire Lord Derby made a disastrous break
and fell away back. Boralma' took the ; 
heat easily from The Monk, and Lord ''-
Derby was just outside the distance.
Boralma was made the pool favorite at
100 to 40 for the field. At the quarter
Boralma led Lord Derby by a length and
retained this to the half. On the lower
turn Lord Derby made an irresistible
burst of speed, passed Boralma, and go- >
ing strongly won the heat by an open,,
length. Lord Derby was again made a
favorite at 4 to 1. As in the second heat. 1
Lord Derby broke at the turn and was :
simply driven to save his distance. Bor

Oakland 7, Sacramento 1.
Mr. Hoffer of Sacramento had a good
chance to show himself before San Fran- i
Cisco fanatics at Recreation grounds yes- i
terday afternoon. He did not face the :
lucky Wasps or the gigantic Angels. Hia
opponents were none other than the sel -
dom hitting Dudes, the tailenders In the
column; yet they fell upon his curves. ?
bunched their hits and by a plenitude of :
sizzling doubles and singles and a round
toe-blOCk swat by Francks murdered the :
hope of Sacramental salvation. Johnson"
on the other hand, was too good for the
Senators. Three safeties were all that
came from the stick efforts of the Sen
ators.
In the second inning Hoffer shot an In
curve against Dunleavy's head. The ball
landed firmly on the back portion of the
cranium and Dunleavy went down and
out for six times ten seconds. When he i
revived he walKed off the field, Moskiman
taking his place in the left garden when
the Dudes went to the field.
The first runs were registered ln the
fourth, when Moskiman, safe on first
with an honest hit, cantered around the
bags on Francks* long fly over the right
field fence. After that the Dudes began i
to unravel Hoffer.
In the fifth it looked as if the Senators â¢
would have a chance at passing several
run measures, but they were doomed ear
ly in the day. The feature of this inning
was a catch by Streib off the right field
fence, which robbed Courtney of a two
bagger. The score:

the yacht out for a trial spin to-day, but

their judgment is correct. All I want it
to sail the Shamrock against the fastest
boat in America, and If it is the Columbia
we are all ready. I am glad ths decision
has been made."
N'either Mr. Jameson nor Mr. Watson
cared to say anything about the selection
of .. the Columbia. Captain Sycamore

Nothing could touch Anzella in the 2:14

Dan W, the roan horse, and third to Clau

Promptly at 1 o'clock Judges General
A. M. Barrett, Grove L. Johnson and
Fred Cox called the starters in the gen-'
tlemen's road race. The pick of the wise
ones was Regina F, which was held a 2 to
6 favorite for the first heat, with L. S.
Upson holding the ribbons. Putting in a
challenge when straightened for the wire,
the favorite fell just a bit short, losing
out by a head to Baby Button, superbly
driven by F. Wright. Regina still re- j
tained the honors of favoritism in the ring
and In the next heat scored cleverly,
Baby Button leaving his feet at the pad
dock. Just about this time F. Ruhstaller,
presiding over the destinies of Monroe B,
seemed to have the game gauged, and
taking hold of Regina in the stretch,' won
smilingly In 2:22 at odds of 6 to 1. Baby
Button finished second, and after making
a disastrous break at the first turn the
first choice was distanced. Baby Button

when he sailed the Columbia against the

the old craft was never so competent to
race as at the present time.
The news of the selection of the Colum
bia to meet the Shamrock II when re
ceived at the Stock Exchange apparently
caused no great amount of Shamrock
money to uncover. Nor did it affect the
odds formerly obtained by backers of the
visitor. Little betting, however, was re
corded during the day. One wager of S5tw
on the Columbia to $409 on the Shamrock
was made. An offer of $1000 even money
en tne Columbia was made, with no
takers, shortly before the exchange
closed. ,
The time between now and the Inter
national race off Sandy Hook on Septem

There have been no plans as to the fu

He informed the union men that he had

they asked him to come with them to the

The police claim that a striker was shot
in the arm during the battle. He was
seen to drop his revolver after the first
few shots were fired and start to leave
the scene, holding his right arm. - Two
men, seeing that he was shot, promptly
took hold of him and led him away. Last
night the police searched a number of
lodging-houses in the vicinity of the
shooting, but failed to get a trace of the
supposed wounded striker.
Up to a few days 'ago the wagons of the
Excelsior Redwood Company were driven
by the officers of the company. On
Wednesday Klassen and another non
union teamster were employed. In order
that they might escape the attacks of the
strikers they were allowed to sleep in the
stables. It Is believed by the company
that none of its former employes were
engaged In the attack, but that It was the
work of a number of hoodlums who have
been hanging around the stables for a
number of days.
The horse which was shot was one of
the team which Klassen was grooming,
preparatory - to hitching them to the
wagon. The animal was exposed to the
firing of both parties, and It is not certain
which fired the fatal shot. The horse was
valued at about $300.
A number of strikers entered the stables
of the Excelsior Redwood Company, C.
A. Hooper & Co., agents, on Fourth
street, near Channel, early" yesterday
morning, for the 'purpose of making, an
attack on Herman Klassen, a non-union
teamster. The attack resulted In a lively
exchange of pistol shots, during which a
valuable stallion belonging to the com
pany received a wound from which it sub
sequently died. None of the men engaged
In the fight were Injured.
At the time of the affair Klassen, who
has been but a single day In the employ
of the company, was preparing his team
for the day's work. The men entered
through a side door and immediately
opened fire. Klassen took refuge behind
one of the stalls and returned the shots.
One of the bullets must have passed dan
gerously near the strikers, as it was
found later in the day lodged in the wall
directly in line with the spot where the
men were supposed to have stood.' Daniel

were six shots fired. He was unable to

"I am not at liberty to speak of what
took place at the meeting," said Mr.
Rothschild. "I may say, however, that
a new phase of the situation has pre
sented Itself, and that there are matters
under consideration which, I believe,
will bring the labor dispute to an end at
an early date. The situation is more
hopeful to-day than at any time since
the inauguration of the strike."
The members of the executive commit
tee of the Municipal Federation of Im
provement Clubs held a meeting in At
torney Rothschild's office in the after
noon, but Secretary Lorenzo was not
among those present. Dr. Salfield, Na
than Bibo and Joseph Rothschild were In
attendance. What transpired at the meet
ing was not disclosed, as each gen
tleman named was sworn to secrecy.
It was admitted, however, that nothing
of importance transpired.
"We have said to Mr. Lorenzo from the
beginning," Andrew Furuseth said, "that
we are willing to confer with the em
ployers at any time. He has not been
able to come to us with the assurance
t hat a committee authorized to act for the
Draymen's Association would meet us.
There Is no prospect of a conference. If
the employers are preparing to receive
proposals for a surrender they are mak
ing a mistake. It is the man who is
lic-ked that surrenders, and we are not
licked."

"The confidence among the teamsters
that vre are on the verge of winning,"
Michael Casey, business agent of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters, said yester
day, "is entirely misplaced. We have no
cause to be discouraged, but I can see no
reason for hope of an early settlement.
Nothing has occurred to change the situ
ation* in the least"
The decrease of the number of attacks
upon non-union teamsters has been so
marked as to cause much comment. Sat
urday was the high-water mark of vio
lence. Sunday and Monday being holi
days few attacks were made, and -when
work was resumed Tuesday non-union
teamsters and water front laborers en
joyed unexpected immunity from attack.
Few acts of violence have been reported
during, the three days. In the "danger
district" it is ireely said that the truce
will last only till next Wednesday. If the
controversy is not settled by that time,
they say, hostilities against non-union
teamsters and specials will be reopened.

posed conferences kept the belief strong
that the end was near, and the denials of
the leaders In the controversy could not
entirely allay the hope. At the headquar
ters of the Brotherhood of Teamsters a
jubilant air was prevalent, and striking
teamsters there and elsewhere believed
that an agreement was to be reached in a
day or two.
Hope Is Not Destroyed.
HALF of San Francisco believed
yesterday that the draymen and
teamsters had-settled their dif
ferences and that the strike was
at an end. Many others, both
employers and strikers, believed that pro
gTe6s was being made toward a settle
ment, and that the restoration of indus
trial peace was a matter of but a few
days.
Leaders of both sides, however, asserted
that euch rumors and such hope were un
founded, and that nothing in the situa
tion pointed to an early settlement.
The conferences that were expected to
occur during the day did not take place.
No committee from the Employers' As
sociation was sent to meet the concilia
tion committee of the Board of Super
visors, and the mediators are left in their
former position of seeking a meeting with
the employers. M. F. Michael, attorney
for the Employers' Association, said a
meeting: of merchants was to have been
held, but that the publication of the in
tention to have a conference had spoiled
it all. The meeting had been abandoned
for the time, and whether it would be
held at all or not was problematic.
Denials were plentiful that any confer
ence between teamsters and draymen was
contemplated. In any case none was,held.
Secretary Lorenzo of the Municipal Fed
eration of Improvement Clubs had asked
the Etrike leaders to consent to a confer
ence between a committee from the team
sters and a committee from the Dray
men'6 Association. He was not able,
however, to show that he was authorized
to say that the draymen would send an
official committee, and the strike lead
ers refused to consider his proposition.
Manager Renner of the Draymen's Asso
ciation asserts that Lorenzo made the
proposition of his individual motion, with
out any authority to say that the dray
men would appoint a conference commit
tee.

mandate to compel the Board

upon Â¦ complaint of Mrs. Â¦ F. A. Banning,
principal of the Everett Grammar School.
Knowlton filed suit for a writ of mandate.

had exercised his legal right when It sus
pended Knowlton. Judge Seawell has
sustained this contention. Knowlton's

The doctor, to be rid of Nobby, told him
to attend the meeting of the commission
in the afternoon and -his' case would bÂ«
given a thorough examination.
Nobby took his advice, but his change
of front probably saved him from having
his wish gratified. Nobby will no doubt
be I heard- of in a few > days again peti
tioning the Police Commission to rein
state him on the force. Â¦
Dr. Windele considers Nobby'a action
the oddest in character that he has ever
had occasion to notice, even as a mem
ber of a commission that has determined
the mental status of many people. He
says that Clark called at his private of
fice yesterday morning and said: "Doc
tor. I want to be sent to an asylum. â¢ I
have lost all my fortune and am now
struggling - against a powextul mania,
which seems to tell me to take my life.
I am certainly Insane."
His commitment was returned to him
and then Nobby stole solemnly from the
room. Now the question naturally arises
as to whether a man who would appear
before a commission of lunacy, bearing
a commitment to an asylum drawn by
himself. Is sane or insane.
The eccentric Nobby became conscious
of the -fact that he and hl3 commitment
had â¢ occasioned the levity, and in what
would, appear to have been a lucid mo
ment he approached Dr. Windele and
whispered to him that he ha'd changed
his. mind.
Nobby, -who has had a varied ' career as
a policeman, lawyer, shylock and capital
ist, drew up his own commitment, when
he presented it to Judge Hebbard the
Jurist was amazed. Then, appreciating
the- drollery of the situation, he laughed
heartily, and Dtsr C. C. "Wadsworth and
Edwin Windele smiled blandly.
He startled the Commissioners of U&
nacy yesterday afternoon when he appeal

The story of the police is that the ring
leaders in the riot ran into Larsen's sa
loon, and when they followed them Lar
sen shut the door in their faces and they
had to force their way in. Larsen ran
behind the bar, where he kept a revolver,'
and struck Lycette over the eye, and Ly
cette used his club. Policeman O'Cal
laghan was struck with a brick.
Attorney McCloskey then asked that the
warrant be Issued for Lycette's arrest on
the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon, but the Judge said he would t*ke
time to look- carefully over the evidence
after, it had been transcribed.
Martin Jensen and Gustave Behrend,
striking sailors, testified to having been
in Larsen's saloon when the police broke
in the door.' They saw the officers use
their clubs. Christiansen said that he saw
a pistol behind the bar, but the others de
nied that It was there. Adam Beck, a con
tractor, testified . that he was on a build
ing across the street from the saloon. He
saw a truck s stalled and 300 or 400 men
were shouting "scab" and creating a dis
turbance. Three or four mounted police
men dispersed the crowd.' and he saw men
running- in and. out of the saloon, but he
saw no bricks thrown. â¢' .
Lincoln School Boys Stampede E. A.

Edward A. Logsdon, one of the recently
appointed special policemen, was . last
night chased for " several\blocks by a
crowd of scholars from the Lincoln Night
School. The boys .bombarded the special
with rocks, milk cans and sections of ce
ment. The special fired two , shots at the
boys. The shots took no effect. The spe
cial officer and a shoeblack. who happened
to be passing were both: taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital for the .treatment of sev
eral severe lacerations of the scalp.
The boys have been in. the habit of an
noying J. M. ' Foge, who conducts a gro
cery store at the corner of Fifth and
Mission streets. Last night after school
had been dismissed some . of them upset
a horse trough in front of Foge's store.
Logsdon interfered and the boys attacked
him. Some of the rocks missed the spe
cial and broke the store windows, but
enough of the ammunition landed to start
Logsdon on a rapid run. The crowd fol
lowed him, and It was only by, firing his
revolver that he managed- to shake off
his pursuers. .Thomas Thoran, a shoe
black, who lives at 668 Mission street, was
struck by one of the rocks. . â¢

Captain Wittman Issued Â¦ Instructions
last night to his men to spare no effort
In landing Brady behind prison bars.
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon O'Dea, who was in charge of a non
union teamster, saw Brady on the Mail
Dock. O'Dea turned the teamster over
to another officer and started after
Brady. The latter, seeing the officer ap
proaching, ran along the dock and seeing
that escape., was impossible he jumped
into the bay. O'Dea quickly drew his
revolver and pointing it at Brady . com
manded him to surrender. Brady con
tinued to swim, in the hope of reaching
a place- of safety. O'Dea fired ' three
shots at him.~ After the third shot
Brady disappeared and for a short
time it was thought that he had been hit
by one of the bullets. Subsequent Inves
tigation, however, revealed that â¢ Brady
dived and came up under the dock. Sev
eral policemen, attracted to the scene by
the shooting, joined O'Dea In trying -to
locate Brady, but their efforts were un
successful. It Is supposed he made his
escape in a boat, which was seen under
the dock. Â¦ Â«

WITHIN a week ' twenty valu
able horses belonging to dray
men-have been poisoned, and,
: detectives and police officers,
are endeavoring to discover
clews to the Identity of the flends who
are doing the poisoning. The method em
ployed is to place arsenic in the watering
troughs.
Last night an extra detail of policemen
were patrolling south of Mark'et street in
the hope of discovering the poisoners. The
police have two men under suspicion and
they are hopeful o't, catching them in. the'
act. . / .
"The poisoning of horses must stop,"'
Captain Wittman said last night,' '.'even If
it is necessary to place an officer to watch
every trough where the fiendish work is
I being done. What satisfaction a man can
have in killing a horse simply to be re
venged on the owner is beyond' my com
prehension. The poison is placed in the
troughs some time after midnight, and as
far as I know two men are engaged in the
dastardly work. "Whether they are strikers
or not I cannot positively say. In nearly
every case where a horse has been poi
soned by drinking water out of Â¦ a trough
the animal belonged to some member of
the Draymen's Association." > ' Â¦
A sample of water taken from a trough
near the Mail dock was analyzed yester
day and found to contain enough arsenic
to kill a half-dozen horses. Captain -of
Detectives Seymour has two of his men
looking for the poisoners. He is confident
that they will be in custody before long.
An expressman named Rlley watered
his horse at a trough on Townsend street
yesterday and a short time afterward the
animal died. . He told a policeman that he
had been warned by two men, who looked
like laborers, not to- allow his- horse to
drink the water, but thinking that they
were fooling he laughed at them. Shortly
afterward he drove the horse to-the sta
ble, and noticing that he was seriously
sick he sent tor a veterinary surgeon.
The latter pronounced the animal to be
suffering from arsenical poisoning. A few
hours later the horse died.
WIDESPREAD reports that tlie strike had been settled and the teamsters would return to work kept employers and strikers in a state of
excitement yesterday. In spite of denials 'by leaders on b'oth sides that the situation has changed in the least, the belief is entertained by
many that the end is not distant. Striking teamsters expect the controversy to be settled by next Wednesday and it is said that if it has
not been ended by that time non-union teamsters will no longer enjoy- immunity from attack.
The conference to have been held between the conciliation committee of the Board of Supervisors and a committee from the Employers' ,
Association was Wbandoned, but such a meeting is still a possibility and may be held to-day. Efforts "to secure a meeting between draymen and
teamsters were unsuccessful. . . .'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL.L, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 3901.
In Justice to ourselves and In all fairness we expect to find in the next issue of
your paper a correction of the errors, and in as prominent a position as you have
given to the erroneous statements themselves. Yours very truly.
(Signed) LEVI STRAUSS & CO. .
San Francisco, September 4, 1901.- . LEVI STRAUSS. President.' '
The facts with regard to these matters were yesterday fully given to your office
in response to your inquiries. In order that there might be no mistake about the
matter a member of our firm took the trouble to go to the factory and investigate
the facts fully, and. In accordance with the previous arrangement with your office, he
reported the result thereof substantially as herein stated. Nevertheless you have seen
fit to publish this article teeming with error, in which a temporary trouble with our
machinery, such as Is liable to occur in any factory. Is magnified into a serlou3 im
pairment of our business, the dismissal of one-half of our force and the reduction of
60 per cent of our output.
Whatever the union teamsters may have proclaimed there is not a word of truth
In the statement that any overalls had been returned to us whatsoever. Not a single
garment has been returned to us from any source whatsoever.
The article also contains the following: ' t
"A. few days ago four truckloads of overalls were driven to the doors of the com
pany's Battery-street store. Union teamsters who had followed the trucks from the
railway depot proclaimed the fact that the goods had been returned from the con
signees." . â¢ . â¢Â¦Â¦â¢â¢â¢
This is absolutely untrue. The output of the factory has not been reduced a par
ticle, save so far as was occasioned by the temporary cessation from work yesterday
while the machinery was undergoing repairs.
Yesterday forenoon some trouble occurred with the steam power In our factory,
which caused the machinery to work spasmodically for an hour or two. While repairs
were being made the usual factory work could not regularly go on, so that some of
the operatives instead of. remaining Idle at the factory went out voluntarily, and for
the most part returned by the time the machinery had been set in order. The ma
chinery was fully repaired by the early part of the afternoon and at that time all the
operatives were again at work with the exception of a few who absented themselves
for the remainder of the day. None of these operatives were dismissed or requested to
remain away for any portion of the day. Those who went away did so of their own
accord. This morning all were at work as usual.
As a subheading in black type 'you state: . >
"Yesterday Levi Strauss & Co. found business so impaired that they were com
pelled to reduce the output of their factory 50 per cent." .
ThÂ« foregoing statements are fabrications pure and simple. There Is not a word
of truth in either of them. We have not dismissed any of our operatives. On the con
trary we are desirous of adding to our force; bo much so that we are willing to teach
inexpert hands the use of the sewing mnchine. Neither one-half nor any other por
tion of the factory force is idle, but the factory is running Just as it has been run
ning for the past year or more.
To the Editor of the Examiner, Hearst Building. San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
In the tlxth column of the first page of your Issue of September 4, 1901, occurs an
article with regard to our business affairs which has, in all its essential particulars, no
foundation whatsoever In fact. Among other things the headlines of the article in large,
black type read as follows: * ;'. â¢
"Half the factory force is idle." ,
"LevJ Strauss & Co. dismiss four hundred of the eight hundred girls employed by
them in making overalls." Â»
paper the erroneous statements therein pointed out. In the
Interest of justice and fair dealing: we -would ask that yon srlve
snch publication of the Inclosed letter as yon may deem advisa
ble. Yours very truly, . LEVI STRAUSS & CO. .

in : regard to the alleged clubbing of Ju
lius "W. Larsen, saloon-keeper, 249 Steuart

Larsen testified that he was instructed
to close his front door by the police, and
he did so. Then the police forced open
his door and Lycette struck him on the
arm with his club, and when he ran be
hind the bar .:Lycette struck him on the
head with the club, knocking him down.

One of the most disgraceful : and damna
ble political outrages ever committed upon
Hhe good people* of ""the State of Califor

superintendent of the Home for the Fee
ble-Minded at Glen. Ellen. This action by
Governor Gage through his board of trus
tees, headed by Boss McKenzie of San
Jose, will not coon be forgotten by the
people, and should forever damn Gage
politically.. It, was a sacrifice of the Inno-
Gage's Disreputable Act.

The removal of Dr. Osborne from charge
of the State Home for the Feeble-Minded
is an outrage on the State and the pa
tients. Dr. Osborne has conducted the in
stitution successfully and satisfactorily
for more than fifteen years. Ho is an
American Republican, In no sense offen

under two Democratic administrations.
The cause of removal. If there, be any,
has not been made known, but it is the
general belief that a berth had to be pro
vided for some one for political favors,
and a conscientious and capable citizen
must fall. The Governor may be nom
inated for re-election, but he .will never

In addition to the trouble caused him by the
menace ofj famine in several provinces, of his* empire
the Czar has other troubles. For example, he is not

expected when he annexed them, and it is probable
his visit to Paris is intended mainly to get a rest from
the. comforts of home. .
But perhaps their exultation -is premature, and the
surgeon may have to suspend his uplifted knife and
spare the little piece cf man that is neither bowel nor
bone. Dr. Hershey of Denver appears as medical
counsel for the vermiform appendix, anA-declares that
it has a function in the bodily economy of man. He
says that it lubricates the caecum, a large affair that
stands between the large and 'small divisions of the
alimentary, canal, a'sort of/canal lock, as it were. He
is of.the opinion that this lock is. kept in. operating
order by the appendix, which acts as a sort of oil cup. v
When the members of the society which rejoices Jn
no appendix get together they will abate their re-"
joicings^over their wormy enemy and. see whether
their caecums. are properly piled and in working
order.' For aught they know; they have parted with

seemed a light burden to that which he bore
when he found that he had a vermiform ap
pendix. He was informed that it was a useless part
of his anatomy, a survival of the time when he went
on all fours and chewed the cud like.a cow, or per
haps of a still earlier existence, when he was a finny
fish and took only water in his. ~ To have the petty
little remnant of his past turn and smite him with a
pain in his right side, below the midriff and just under
his pocket, was a worry hard to bear. The surgeons
soon learned how to explore his interior and cut the
infernal thing off, and there are now, so many in this
country who have undergone that operation that it
is proposed to form a national association "The So
ciety of the Non-Appendix," to meet annually and
show their scars and fight their battles over.

Ambassador Choate is reported to have recently
suggested! that it would be a good idea for British
schools to send a number of students every yeW to
American icolleges while American schools sent boys
to British He thinks the interchange would
accomplish a good deal in the way of promoting in
ternational friendship, and probably it might be better
than the present plan of exchanging of Embassadors.
Let us recall Mr. Choate and send over about as many
boys as wÂ£ call get for the samesalary.
Chicago is to plant an apple orchard in a public
park, and of course it will bear forbidden fruit, and
equally of course the small boy will break in, and in
the end that park is going to cause more trouble than
two reform schools can straighten out.

This enormous armament upon the seas entails, of
course, a heavy burden of taxation upon the work
ers, but under the conditions prevailing in our times
it appears to be necessary. Without a powerful navy
no nation could be sure of its commerce, and without
commerce few of the greater industries could flourish.
As any one nation increases its naval armament the
others feel bound to follow, and there is no telling
where the limit will be. Sooner or later, however, it
is bound to be reached, and it would seem that among
the nations of continental Europe, where large armies
as well as large navies have to be maintained, the
limit cannot be far away. â¢ . >-^L. : :
Since a good many authorities believe that in naval
war between two powers of anything like equality in
fighting force the advantage will lie with the nation
having the greater strength in swift-going cruisers
rather than in battleships, it is worth noting that the
report shows that in the number of armored cruisers
built the United States stands seventh, or last, with
a tonnage of only 17,415. The report says: "Russia
heads the list of armored cruisers built with a tonnage
of 83,231. In protected cruisers building the United
States is third, with a tonnage of 61,403, and third'
in protected cruisers built, with a tonnage of 21,000.
Russia heads the list of these vessels building, but is
last on the list, of protected cruisers built. In arm
ored coast defense vessels the United States leads
with 43,934 tons built and 12,9-40 building. France
and Germany have a tonnage of 43,331 and 42,873
respectively, in armored coast defense vessels built,
while Great Britain has a tonnage of 38,900 in arm
ored coast defense vessels built. Russia and the
United States are the only countries building ships of
this type."
The tonnage of war vessels now under construction
would in itself constitute an enormous naval, force.
A summary of the report to the Naval Department
giving a list of the ships built and building by the
seven greater powers of the world says: "England
heads the list with 477 vessels, having a tonnage of
1,766,855; France, although showing more vessels
than England, 484, has a tonnage of only 781,065;
Russia has 341 vessels, with a tonnage of 552,546; the
United States, fourth on the list, 135 vessels, with a
tonnage of 507,494', Germany, 261 vessels, with a ton
nage of 458,482; Itafy, 231 vessels, with a tonnage of
322,707, and Japan, 139 vessels, with a tonnage of
251,498. The United States ranks next to Great Brit
ain in the tonnage of battleships building, having
I33,8oo to Great Britain's 229,900, but stands sixth in
the tonnage of battleships built, 83,094, leading Japan
only. In, the tonnage of armored cruisers building
the United States is third, with 109,500, being ex
ceeded by Great Britain, with 226,400, and France
â¢with 148,260."
The British of comse continue to hold the lead
they long ago established, but of late the Germans
and the Japanese have been coming to the front with
a marvelous rapidity. The activity in the German
navy yards is such that the great fleet which they
have planned to construct will be completed fully a
year earlier than was estimated. Since the war with
China Japan has increased her tonnage of war ves
sels from 30,000 to 260,000, and it is reported that a
further expansion of naval force will probably be
ordered, so that ere long the navy of Japan will have
a tonnage of 400,000.
FACTS and figures compiled by officers of the
Naval Intelligence Department at Washington,
show that the nations are exerting extraordin
ary energies in the building of warships of all kinds,
from battleships to torpedo-boats. The vast ex
pansion of commerce in recent years and the increas
ing dependence of .industry for its prosperity upon
foreign markets has given an added value to the great
ocean highways, and each nation is doing its utmost
to establish power upon the sea as well as upon land.

A system of protecting boots, Jointed as as to admit of

hind shoes while at top speed, as his hock action la high as

The front of the hind hoof is entirely covered and protected
by the scalpers, and the speedy cut boots prevent contact at
the front of the ankle joint, a very tender spot. The hock
extension Is directly In support of the curb joint. Cresceus.

Dr. Osborne had held the position since

not disturbed by Governor Budd. It re

loops are adjusted to the reins, so Mr. Ketcham can be sure
of his grip on the lines,, as should a rein slip through his lin

breeching straps encircling his quarters required, thus admit

the swing- of the shoulder blades.
No Strap Binds His Breast.
An ordinary light saddletree supports the shafts, and directly

It is easy, to foresee that this statement will be

through j reciprocity treaties, to strengthen their
claims fotf something like free trade with Cuba. That

the competitor will have the advantage of cheap water
transportation to the Eastern market. Such being
the case Californians will have to watch the issue
with care. . , ' , Â¦'
A good' many difficulties have been placed in the
way of the Government by reason of the inefficiency
of men elected to office, but these are being gradually
overcome. 'General Wood says: "The elections as
a whole resulted in the extreme and revolutionary
element being elected. In many cases the men elect
ed found themselves confronted with difficulties from
the outset of their administration. They had made
promises which they could not fulfill, and as a re
sult their j popularity was short lived and complaints
and fault-finding were extensive.- To avoid serious
confusion; numerous inspectors are kept constantly
employed looking. out both, for the interests of the
Department of State and. Government and for that
of Finance. Some Alcaldes have been removed, some
suspended and some have been held under charge
of serious offenses."
Of the general condition of the country the report
makes this important statement: "The great desire
of Cuba 1 3-day is to obtain a reduction on the import
duties of Cuban products into the United States and
strong efforts are being made in this direction. All
far-seeingi business men realize that Cuba's prosperity
and advancement depend absolutely upon her com
mercial relations with the United States, where her
two maiit products have their principal markets.
High duties against Cuban products mean that the
developm-ent of Cuba will be slow, if at all. The im
portation! of United States products into Cuba, while
it is increasing, is yet considerably below the total
importation from other countries. The establishment
of reciprocity in commercial relations between Cuba
and the United States means everything to Cuba, for
if she car obtain favorable duties on her tobacco, and
especially on her sugar, her development will be im
mediate."!
The sanitary conditions of the island have been
greatly improved in every direction. The foul prisons
have been/cleaned as far as possible, but there is
need of a modern prison for; long-term prisoners.
The hospitals have been taken charge of by the gen
eral government and are now much better than they
were. The report says that leprosy is general through
out the island, but in a mild form. Steps have been
taken to find. a suitable location for establishing a
leper colony so that all persons thus afflicted may
be removed from contact with the public.
The Department of State and Government in the
island has been conducted under the supervision of
the Military Governor, but under the direct manage
ment of the Cuban Secretary of State and Govern
ment, Senor Diego Tomayo. Underthe Secretary
there are six Civil Governors of the various pro
vinces, and under them are the various Alcaldes of
the municipalities. The Government is abolishing
many of the municipalities because their existence is
not justified by any necessity and entails considerable
expense. The abolition of these offices has of course
given, rise to some discontent, but it is not serious.
Moreover the general adds: "After harvesting the
first large sugar crop since the war, which will be
completed in the coming spring, together with the
gathering and sale of tobacco, coffee and other, crops,
it is believed the municipalities that remain will be
able to assume a large proportion, of the burden now
borne by the state, and as. a result the general-rev
enues of the island will to a greater extent be avail
able for public works, such as the construction of
highways and the dredging of harbors."
GENERAL WOOD'S annual civil report upon
affairs in Cuba has^ been received' at Wash
ington. It is described as consisting of
"thirteen immense volumes" and dealing with every
subject of importance with which the Government is
concerned. From a" summary given to the press it
appears that while the conditions of the people are
by no means satisfactory still an immense improve
ment has been made since the close of the war and
the prospects for further improvement are excellent.
CONDITIONS OF CUBA.
. At the meeting of the' International Law Associa
tion in Glasgow there was a discussion upon the sub
ject of marriage, during which.it was developed that
Scotland is the place where \ marriage is most easily
effected and South Africa the land where it is most

ous experiments in marriage and divorce we do not
get a first place on either count. '
Another issue of the Sacramento Bee says: "The
Examiner is the very worst counselor the strikers
could possibly have. Public opinion will not long
remain with a cause that makes use of brutality and
violence! These acts, which the Examiner either
passes by in silence or commends, will do more to
defeat the strikers than all the arguments on the other
side. Yet the Exaininer does not perform its honest
duty and tell them so, but pats them vigorously on
the back after every act of disorder and lawlessness.
Surely it presents a sad and shameful spectacle for a
great journal." " '
The farmers throughout the State are getting alive
to the seriousness of their situation and, following the
suggestions of the Tulare Register and Marysville
Appeal, are proposing to call out a large force, pre
pared for defense, to take charge of handling their
produce here and at other points of congestion. It
is believed that they can put twenty thousand men
into the field within ten days, equipped to protect
themselves while attending to their business.
Again we warn the strikers that tlrey have alienated
their allies. â¢
A half-dozen country papers publish accounts of
cowardly and brutal assaults made on citizens. from
their localities who are working in San Francisco.
Some of these men have been driven out of country
jobs by striking union laborers from this city who
have undercut their . wages. In some cases their
wives and children have been by invading strikers
deprived of money they expected to earn in the hop
fields, making it necessary for the head of the family
to come to the city for employment.
The Sacramento Bee, replying to the Stockton
Mail's advice that non-union laborers be beaten to
death if need be, says: "The Bee has no sympathy
with the word 'scab.' If the men who are earning an
honest living and supporting their families in San
Francisco are scabs, will the Mail please tell us how
they differ from the union men who have flocked
into the country from San Francisco and whose in
flux has reduced the wages of ranch hands at least
50 cents a day? The 'scabs' in San Fiancisco are
keeping up and increasing wages; the union men in
the country are reducing them."
The Napa Register says: "The dastardly assault
upon three non-union men who were peaceably rid
ing on a street car at the. corner of Market and Ninth
streets in San Francisco on Saturday exhibits the
perils that attend men who go from the country to
work in the city. Two were armed and escaped, but
the third was beaten into unconsciousness and left
in the gutter. The Examiner makes little of it. It
is too busy rubbing factious ears." *
The Los -Angeles Times prints a list of outrages
and assaults by strikers on non-union laborers in this
city that fills two columns.
IT is well that the people of San Francisco be in
formed of the state of public opinion in the State,
as expressed by the impartial and independent
country press. Therefore we continue, the publica
tion of a condensation of such expressions from the
interior papers. The Stockton Independent says:
"The best, strongest and most forcible" presentation
of the merits of the employers' position in the San
Francisco strike was the editorial in The Call of
the 21st." .
Danville Sentinel: "A striker from San Francisco,
who represented himself as an officer of the Ship
joiners' Union, was in town this week, making a tour
of the country, districts to deter men from going to
the city to take the strikers' places. He stated^the
fate of any person who dared affront the almighty
union by going to San Francisco to work in this
language: 'Every scab that goes to San Francisco
from the country is a marked man. He is spotted as
quick as he takes a striker's job and will get hurt.
It may not be'the day he goes to work nor the next,
nor the next week,' but his time will come and he
will get done up. He need not fool himself becaCSe
he is strong and husky, he will get done up just the
same.' / This is the language of a labor leader,' -an
officer of a union, of an intelligent, responsible in
dividual, who was formerly a foreman in the Risdon
Iron Works. When the right of American~citizens
to work is systematically interfered with, with the
knowledge if not actual connivance of union leaders,
it is time for the city, aided if need be by the State,
to put an end to such interference. It is worth re
marking in this connection that while non-union
laborers are warned away from San Francisco and
done up if they go there, the strikers are coming
into the country, cutting under farm wages and in
the hop fields taking employment away from women
and children."
San Bernardino Times-Index: "The condition in
San Francisco is fast reaching a climax. Manu
facturers and employers are concluding that it is wise
to move away from that city and seek more desirable
location. One firm has already filed papers in Xos
Angeles to transfer its business and another has de
cided to do so."

The agent inquired where he could find
other, men from whom he wished to se
cure rights of way," 1 and stated that the
line would start at Bakersfleld and run
to> Corcoran Junction, in this county,
from which point it would take a north
westerly course and cross Kings River
below the Kings River bridge at Le
moore and then proceed to tidewater. A
branch line will be built to connect with
the Coalinga field and also to other, fields
west â¢ of here when â¢ they "are developed,
while . branches will run from ' Bakerslield
out into the Kern River, Sunset, McKit

to be of eight-inch Â¦ pipe, and the agree
ment is that the pipe is to be -placed un

it is impossible to find out. â¢ McCord's
right of way was deeded to a man by the

have been " progressing very - quietly, as
this is the first heard of anything being
done to - secure rights of way, although
pipe line projects from both the ' Kern
County and Coalinga oil fields have long
been talked of. That a pipe line to tide
water will be a 1 great advantage to oil
producers there can .be no doubt, Tas the

much to retard development work, and
the complaint made to the 'Railroad Com

cases of salmon. She brought home sixty
Chinese and eighty-seven white fisher

The freight ferry steamer Thoroughfare
ran into the collier Horda and tug: Relief
Wednesday afternoon and there was a
narrow escape from a serious accident.
As it is, the Thoroughfare is minus a
rudder and the Relief has a rail smashed
and bulwarks damaged, while the Horda
has two plates dented. The Horda was
waiting for a ship to leave Beale-street
wharf in order to dock there. The Relief
was fast to the collier on her starboard
quarter, waiting- to help in the docking-.
The Thoroughfare came out of the South
ern Pacific freight slip and backed down
toward Mission Rock in order to head up
for the Lombard-street freight slip. Some
thing must have gone wrong- in the en
gine room, for without a moment's warn
ing she crashed into the tug and collier,
snapping the hawsers that fastened them
together as though they were pack
threads. The ferry-boat then backed
away and a few minutes later proceeded
to Lombard-street wharf, where she was
laid up for repairs.

men who robbed the Cotton Belt train at
Ejlau on Tuesday night are still at large*
The bloodhounds which were taken to the

THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Australia arrived from Tahiti yes
terday. She was a day behind
time, owing to a slight break in
the machinery and strong head
winds. Among her cargo were 46,780 co
coanuts, 111 cases of, vanilla and 423 sacks
of copra. Her passengers Â¦ were V. C.
Viry, John Ray, C. A. Roccassero, J.
Frodsham, H. H. Beechner, J. C. Smith
and R. W. Smith. Besides these there
were five Chinese in the steerage in tran
sit for Hongkong.
The Australia left in port at Papeete
the English gunboat Torch, German gun
boat Cormoran and the French bark Col
bert. The Cormoran arrived from the
Marquesas a short time before the sailing
of the mail steamer, and Captain Lawless
waited long enough to give the officers
and â¢ crew a chance to send their , mail
home by the Australia. The Colbert ar
rived from Bordeaux, .and had a terrible
time of It during the voyage. In one
storm the vessel was on her. beam-ends,
and soon after she righted an immense
wave swept her from stem to stern. The
chief officer and one of the sailors were
swept overboard. The returning sea car
ried the.m up against the side of the ship,
killing the sailor instantly and breaking
the mate's arm and leg. The crew man
aged to get the officer aboard, and he wars
doing fairly well when the Australia
sailed. The Colbert is a small bark that
has been engaged in the Tahiti trade for
years.
"The largest producing companies," Mr.
Porter said in conclusion, "are the ones
most active in trying to bring about a
combination of interests. They see no
way, unless conditions change, to pay div
idends to their -stockholders." : .
Mr.,Porter does not expect that all pro
ducing companies will be taken In at the
start. Eventually the oil producers of the
entire State may find it to their advan
tage to come in, he says. The only or
ganization of oil producers now existing
includes the Los Angeles city field solely.
"The cost of development work' If the in
terests were concentrated would be not
over one-half of that now incurred. Wells
would be put -down where the greatest
output could be reached and the cost
would be at a minimum. The marketing
of oil would also be conducted % more
cheaply, for it would not be necessary to
support so many agencies as now exist.
Instead of 'five or six parallel .pipe lines
in a district, one line woulu do the work."
The appraisers now in the field are rated
by Mr. Porter as : experts. They are Ar
thur L. Bell, William Mulholland and
Bernard Bienenfeld. They have no prop
erty in any of the fields. They are all
engineers and all have knowledge of oil
territory and all have been in the oil busi
ness. They are looking into and verify
ing the records of producing companies;
are considering the depths of sand at va
rious localities and looking into all aspects
of the properties concerned.
All Producers Concerned.
Mr. Porter spoke of many wells that
are not pumping and of some companies
that are storing oil., "If all the properties
were combined in one company." said Mr.
Porter, "I don't think that they would
have to do any development work for
twelve months. After . that posslbfy it
would be necessary to resume develop
ment. Eventually all the oil that can be
produced will be in demand. It depends
upon the oil producers what they will
get for the oil. If they continue in their
present competition, one against another,
they will have t<r take not over 25 or 30
cents per barrel. If they combine they
ought to get 50 to 60 cents per barrel.
"The ! consumer would not be hurt by
paying the higher price. Three and one
half barrels of oil are equivalent to a ton
of coal In the production of heat."
Economy in Combination.
"The conditions will be worse than they
are now," said Mr. Porter yesterday, "if
by any chance this attempt to combine
the producers should fail. The price of
oil would be lower now than it is if it
were not for this movement. Our primary
purpose is to take over the productive
fields in the Kern River and McKittrick
districts. Over SO per cent of the Kern
River field owners have already signed
the agreement submitted. We are taking
in only producing companies, the desire
being not to load down at the start with
unproductive territory. There are about
5000 acres of demonstrated oil land in the
Kern- River district. Other lands may be
taken in later it necessary. <
"We expect to issue only sufficient capi
tal stock at first to cover the appraised
value of the properties that come in at
the start. We might begin with issuing
$25,000,000 of stock; that depends upon the
appraised value of these properties. The
land will be appraised at a low value. My
present idea la that the aggregate ap
praisement of the productive properties
of the Kern River district may -be some
thing more " than $30,000,000. The produc
tion of. that district last year was 8,000,000
barrels, approximately. The companies
that have signed the preliminary agree
ment have On their hands contracts call
ing for the delivery of 4,000,000 barrels of
oil per annum,- and the, average price is
in excess of 25 cents per barrel, although
there are contracts as low as 25 cents."
Situation Is Reviewed.
This agreement shall be subject to amend
ment, addition,, revision or cancellation upon
the concurrence of the parties subscribed here
to owning two-thirds in value of the appraise
ment hereinbefore provided, to be made upon
the several properties of the subscribers, which
appraisements are to be made forthwith, and
upon such two-thirds' in value concurring the
whole number subscribing these presents shall
be bound as though all had concurred.
The instruments of sale shall be deposited
in escrow with the Union Trust Company of
San Francisco, to be delivered to the new cor
poration on or before the expiration of seven
months from the date of the issuance of the
certificate of incorporation upon the delivery of
the shares of the capital stock of the new
corporation to the amount required In each in
stance, accompanied with a certificate under
the hand of the secretary of the new corpora
tion with its corporate s^al affixed, certifying
that the directors of the new corporation have
demanded the possession of said instrument?
of sale. ' . . .
The subscribers agree that the' cost of pro
ducing: oil or the present market price of
oil is fifteen (15) cents per barrel, and that all
amounts received for oil delivered on contract
by the new company beyond such price shall
be paid to the present owner of such contracts
respectively in cash at the several times when
the money Is actually received upon such con
tracts and the owners respectively of such
contracts shall transfer and assign the same
to the new corporation and shall accept pay
ment therefor in the above method.
Some other provisions of much'import
ance are also given in full, as follows:
The plan concerning such contracts is in
full as follows:
Arranging 1 for Contracts:
grant deed and also the stock of any cor
poration under appraisement.
Making the AppraisemnL " .'. V
-The method of appraisement Is very
carefully defined, and as this Is the only
point upon which there appears to be any
present marked difference of opinion the
essential provisions . of the agreement in
this, regard are given in substance.
First the value of the land shall be
fixed. The value of the improvements,
such as .wells, pipe lines, drilling *rigs,
pumps, water rights, etc., shall be fixed
at the * amount of the present estimated
cost of reproducing them. Three compe
tent men, who are already in the field,
form the appraisement committee. Each
company pledges itself by its directors to
accept the appraisement made by -the
committee, or to show to the satisfaction
of the signers of the agreement, collect
ively, why the appraisement should not
be accepted. The decision of two-thirds
in value of the signing oil companies, ac
cording to the amount in the aggregate
of the appraisement, shall be sufficient to
arbitrate and settle any disagreement and
controversy, -and a decision shall be bind
ing upon the whole body of signers.
The appraisement shall determine the
price to be paid in consideration of the
transfer of all appraised property to the
new corporation. The payment for the
property will bo made in shares of. the
capital stock of the new corporation, esti
mated at the par value thereof excepting
In the case of contracts for the sale of
oil, for which there are special provisions.

THE HAIR. BRUSH
Breeds Dandruff, Which Causes Fall-
ing Hair and Finally Baldness.
Professor Unna, Hamburg, Germany,
European authority on skin diseases, says
that dandruff is as contagious as any
ether malevolent disease, and that one
common source of the spread of dandruff
is the use of the same hair brush by dif-
ferent persons. The vray to avoid catch-
Ing dandruff or any other disease from
another's brush Is to insist on the use of
Newbro's Herptcide. It not only kills the
dandruff germ, but It is also an antiseptic
that will prevent the catching of any dis-
ease whatever through contagion of an-
other's brush.

CORNâ There was more Â¦Â¦ Interest taken In this
grain at Chicago yesterday than on any day
since the recent excitement.' The feeling was
firm and the market advanced,- mainly on the
rumor that the forthcoming Illinois State re
port would show a condition of 45. j A dispatch
to Bolton, De Ruyter & Co. said: "The lead
ers believe that Europe will get the last of the
Argentine shipments this month, when the de
mand must turn to America without much re
gard to prices. In fact, shipments are already
increasing, which looks as if the foreigners had
already started in. Stocks of old Corn in the
West are about exhausted. The largest and
best â¢ informed traders, those who spend the
most money on crop reports and buy and ship
large lines, have been, believers; in Corn all
along and are still. The estimate for the com
ing crop remains at about 1,400,000,000 bushels.
The Missouri . State report gives a condition of
27,' an improvement over August 1." ,,

are light. Store Eggs do not follow ranch up

Cheese is doing rather better.

Onions continue steady, being in demand for
Australia, but this demand is expected to cease
with the sailing of the Ventura on the 12th,
when the market may ease off. It is reported
that the first shipment to Australia from here
arrived in bad order.
Vegetables continue weak, ' with a further de
cline in Tomatoes.
The situation in Potatoes is very uncertain at
the moment. The shipping demand has fallen
off, but: whether it has left the State, or merely
been shifted to some other point like Sacra
mento, local dealers are . not yet able to find
out. There is a report that Colorado and Min
nesota have taken California's place as sources
of supply for the. large Southern demand, but
dealers are unable to substantiate this report
either, so the trade are more or- less at sea.
The feeling is weak, however, and the' market
Is much quieter, with large receipts.

THE COAST RECORD.
Provisions were quiet and steady, with lard
leading in strength. , Comparatively light
stocks and an active cash demand were the
bull factors. January pork closed with a gain
of 12*4c, lard 12y4@15c higher and ribs 7*4<810c
higher. .
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Disappointing cables caused heaviness In corn
at the opening, and , the prices were about
steady. Â¦ There was scarcely any corn on sale
during the first hour, and those who did sell
early were eager to buy it back later. The
bull influences were fears of frost to-night In
the Northwest and very heavy shipments yeb
terday and reports*of deterioration in the crop
condition as compared with August. Decem
ber closed strong and l*4c higher at 57%c. .
Oats were quiet and steady, with only small
offerings on the market. December closed *4Â©
%c higher at 35%c Â¦
CHICAGO, Sept. 5.â Wheat showed a strong
undertone and. finished firmer, the strength be
ing largely in sympathy with the better feel
ing in coarse grains and on bullish Argentine
news. Northwest movement showed an . In
crease, but the quality was j disappointing.
There was a disposition' of the outsiders to
buy, although- trade from that quarter was
still smaller. December opened unchanged to
a shade lower at 71*4@71%c, and after
selling down to 71**@71*4c, advanced to 71%@
71%c. closing a shade below the best figure
at 71%c. with a gain of %c.

"Prunes are in very small demand on spot.
An occasional car of old prunes, sizes 40-50s,
."fl-60s and 60-70s. is selling at a 3*4c basis on
the coast. Almost no disposition is shown to
buy new prunes at a 8*4c basis, the lowest price
heard of yesterday for Santa Claras. New
peaches are held around 6*4<56%c, f. o. b. coast,
for choice, but buyers here~are not interested.
Apricots are neglected also."
"The spot market for Calllorr.ia dried fruits
is dull and devoid of feature. What trade
there is is altogether for Immediate require
ments. Raisins are the firmest article on the
list and local supplies of loose and seeded con
tinue scarce. Stocks here, however, will prob
ably be increased soon by arrivals from the
coast, as it is reported shipments of goods re
cently bought there are now being made. No
sales of new crop raisins are heard of. Bids
<Jf 4*jc, ;@5*2C for new 2-crown, 3-crown and
4-crown loose Muscatels, wired to the coast
Thursday, had not been confirmed up to a late
hour yesterday.
'Â¦The situation in evaporated apples has
changed. Not only has the effort of a group
of large local speculators to force prices of
future apples above last week's high level in
order to squeeze the short interests failed, but
the market has actually gone back and is not
oversteady at the decline. New prime State
apples for October-November delivery have
been offered freely within the past forty-eight
hours at 9%c. and it is understood there were
offerings yesterday at 9*4c, without sales, so
izx as can be learned. Spot prime Is lower
also, it being possible to buy car lots at 8*4c.
The fact that prices have reached a level at
which consumption was bound to be seriously
interfered with, also that there are still lib
eral supplies of old apples on the market, with
prospects that high prices would lead many to
make evaporated apples who otherwise would
not do so, were instrumental factors in caus
ing the market to drop. Spot waste shows
s-.me activity. Sale of a car of strictly choice
is reported at $2 15. A bid of $1 90 for prime
stock was declined. Chops are firm but quiet-

CLOSING. Â»
The ctock market to-day, while Idle, was
nevertheless more cheerful. The advice, of the
Kaiser to the Sultan to come to an under

selling from Paris.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
"We might have had a September boom had
it not been for the adverse effect of the strike
and the ccrn damage. These destroyed all
bullish outside sentiment and left the market
entirely dependent upon inside support, which
it has had in unmistakable fashion. There is
some talk that the big men intend to put the
market higher. With stocks 60 closely' held
in their control it would be foolish to deny
their ability to do so. But natural condi
tions are hardly in favor of higher prices at
this time. The money market is likely to be
a serious obstacle to any bull campaign. The
lesprve went down last Saturday to $18,000,000.
compared with $23.OC0,OO0 a year ago. and is
likely to be entirely exhausted before the re
turn movement begins in November. Western
banks have considerable deposits in the reserve
centers, which they will Boon draw upon for
crop purposes. This week's statement, will
probably show a further decline In reserves.
Bankers peem perfectly confident of their abil
ity to take care of ordinary crop and business
requirements, but any active speculation in
Ftocks would rapidly produce a Etringency
that would automatically Impede a bull mar
ket. All discussion of gold Imports and bond
purchases just now is problematical. . These
resources might be available and they might
not. High prices would use up the available
supply of funds more rapidly than low prices.
Taking all the facts into consideration natural
conditions are not just now in favor of higher
prices. Forced manipulation may raise the
market to a higher level, but under such con
ditions operations should be conducted with
unusual care and we should advise selling on
the rallies."
'â¢General business continues in good condi
tion and merchants generally anticipate a sea
eon equaling last year In volume. It Is no
ticeable, however, that very few expect to ex
ceed last year, and there Is a wholesome feel
ing of conservatism in mercantile circles. Kail
road prosperity seems to go on without Inter
ruption. Gross earnings show steady gains.
In spite of the large increases of the three
and four previous years. This is chiefly the
result of better rates and shows the value of
harmony to owners of railroad securities. As
a matter of fact many of the roads are carry
ing a smaller tonnage than last year, but they
are earning a fair profit as a result of rea
sonable and stable rates.

NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The operations of pro
fessional traders, to which business on the
stock exchange is now almost wholly confined,
do not make more than a superficial impres
sion jupon the market. The object of the trad
ers Is achieved if prices are moved, whether
In one direction or another. When the pro
fessionals perceive that in. selling stocks they
are getting into sparse company they turn
with the utmost cheerfulness to the buying
side, as they did yesterday and for a time this
morning, and when the buying demand shows
diminishing power and there seems danger of
becoming loaded up with long stuff, they begin
to pell with equal alacrity, as they did this af
ternoon. The news from day to day may con
tinue much the same without affecting the
periodicity of the narrow Â¦ fluctuations in such
a market. As a background to the market lie
the strong general conditions of business, the
prospect that the interruption to the prosper
ous conduct of the steel industry will not be
much longer continued and the determination
with which controlling interests in the great
properties cling to their .holdings. It is the
obvious policy of large capital at this time to
discourage active speculation, pending the
clearing of the autumn money requirements,
and at the same time offer effective support
for prices of securities when threatened. . The
principal development to-day was . the renewal
of the interior demand for currency. There
was deposited $700,000 at the sub-treasury for
transfer to Chicago and $20,000 for transfer to
New Orleans. Yesterday's sub-treasury ope
rations included a small balance to the banks
on account of payments for gold denosited at
Pacific Coast points, and there were further
payments for the same account to-day, but it
is obvious that the current Government sur
plus will render nugatory these relieving in
fluences. The weekly statements of both I the
Bank of England and the Bank of France
show losses in gold reserves. To-day's early
show of strength was confined to the coalers,
Vanderbllts, grangers and Pacifies among the
railroads, and sugar and a few minor special
ties among the industrials. Brooklyn Transit
was weak throughout on the poor showing of
July net earnings. The market closed weak
at declines running up two points.
Railroad bonds were Irregular In tone and
dull. Total sales, par value. $1,545,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

Theodore O'Neill, a painter employed by
the Board of Public Works in painting
the inside of the rotunda of the Hall of
Records in the old City Hall, met with a
sudden and a violent death yesterday aft
ernoon at 2:20 o'clock. The unfortunate
man fell from an upper staging near the
top of the rotunda, a distance of fifty feet,
to the temporary .flooring laid across the
first story and was Instantly killed.
r,&} .t, ne time tne accident took place
O Neill was about to leave the upper stag
ing for the lower floor, access to which
was afforded by a central mast to which
was affixed a ladder of cleats. Three fel
low workmen standing on the lower floor
saw ONelll's.body falling, striking two
cross = timbers in Its descent. Nothing
about the staging appeared to have given
way, and the presumption is that as hÂ°
was about to step on the ladder of cleats

O Neill was a married man, about 35
years old, and resided with his family on

Ross is one of the smoothest pickpock
ets In the country, according to Captain
Seymour. He was arrested in this city
during the Midwinter Fair while engaged
In picking pockets, but on account of the
failure of his victims to identify him was
given his freedom. Victorsen, it is claim
ed, is well known to the police of New
York and other Eastern cities.
From a description given of the man
who had sold the watch the detectives
yesterday arrested Ross and charged him
with robbing the saloon-keeper. Shortly
afterward Victorsen was apprehended and
booked on the same charge.
The particular crime for which they
were arrested was the robbery of Emile
Alber, a saloon-keeper at 253 Third street.
On the nigrht of June 10 Alber was walk
ing along Third street, near Howard, on
his way home, when he was suddenly at
tacked by Ross and Victorsen, who, after
beatmg him into insensibility, robbed him
of $145 and a gold watch and chain. De
tectives Harper and Hammill subsequent
ly recovered the stolen timepiece from a
south of Market street pawnshop, where
it had been disposed of by Ross.
Locked up in the City Prison are two
noted Eastern crooks who, the police
think, are responsible for several daring

The registration of students closed at 9
o'clock to-night. The total registration is
1026. against 1101 this time last year; 2C6
freshmen registered to-day, against 325
last year. The most interesting feature
was the number of students registered
Irom outside the State. A Stanford
amendment to the constitution provided
that bona-fide residents should be exempt
from registration fees. One-third of the
students last year registered from States
other than California. Ninety out of 7G0

A partial list of those who are going
from Oakland is as follows:
The Oakland Tourists.
Those desiring to go to San Jose will
leave on Monday, and a series of excur
sions have been arranged for those who
desire to remain at Capitola. On Mon
day evening there will be a ball.
On Sunday there will be a concert on
the beach during bathing hours, an ex
cursion to Santa Cruz and trap shooting
for the gun club members. Oakland
Lodge has a gun club and the members
will take their guns for a little practice.
On Sunday afternoon there will be a con
cert at the hotel and an excursion to the
big trees. Sunday evening there will be
a sacred concert.
On Saturday evening at the Capitola
Hotel there will be a grand ball to open
the reunion.
The Oakland Elks will leave on the 2:15
narrow gauge train on Saturday after
noon and will transfer at Santa Clara to
the broad gauge to be taken to Capitola.
Baggage must be checked the day before,
September .6, or the railroad will not
guarantee its delivery because of the large
amount of baggage that will have to be
transferred to Capitola and San Jose at
that time.
Grand Ball and Concert.
It has been arranged so that this will
not clash with the celebration of the Na
tive Sons at San Jose. Elks who are
members of the Native Sons' order can go
to Capitola and take part in all of the ex
ercises there and return to San Jose in
time for the Admission day celebration.
The general arrangements were placed
in the hands of a committee from Oak
land Lodge, with W. H. J. Matthews as
chairman and Dr, J. A. Colegrove as sec
retary. This committee went about things
in a business way. Capitola was selected,
and it was decided that the celebration
should extend from September 7 to the
9th. Inclusive. Arrangements were, made
with the Southern Pacific Company for a
round trip rate of $2 75 from San Fran
cisco or Oakland, the tickets to be good
from September 6 until the 12th, Inclusive,
thus giving plenty of time to have a stop
over and rest at the seashore. R. M.
Briare of the Capitola Hotel, who is an
enthusiastic Elk, has offered the hospital
ities of Capitola to his fellow members of
the order. Â¦ ' Â¦>
OAKLAND, Sept. 6.â The last call for
dinner, Capitola and the Elks Reunion
has been issued by the committee
from Oakland Lodge, where the re
union scheme originated. It is proposed
to make this reunion an annual State
affair and to have it at some prominent
resort where the members of the order
can gather for a few days df enjoyment.
The lodges in San Francisco, Sacramento,
Stockton. Santa Rcsa and San Jose have
already agreed to take part tn the affair
thla year, while the Oakland contingent
18 going down in force.
The next contest for the Palma trophy
will take place In Canada, In accordance
with the rules governing the disposition
of the prize. The special challenge match
at 800, StOO and 1000 yards between teams
of eight men each for the Ulster Rifle
Association of Belfast, Ireland, and the
New Jersey Rifle Association will be the
attraction to-morrow. - . ; .
The conditions of the contest called ,for
the use of the national arm of the coun
try represented by the teams, so that it
was practically a duel between. the Amer
ican Krag-Jorgensen and the English
Lee-Enfleld weapons. The Canadians
used orthoscoplc sights, while. the Amer
icans had service sights. The shooting
done by at least one of ,the American
team was a revelation to their opponents.
Many of the Ulster, men who saw It had
nothing but the highest praise for the
exhibition given by Lieutenant Lelzar of
Washington, D. C, who made the high
est collective and best individual score,
203.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6.â The Canadian
and American riflemen had a long session
to-day on th*e State rifle ranges at Sea
girt, N. J., in the contest for the Ameri
can Centennial Palma trophy, emblematic
of the world's championship, and the
Canadians won by a margin of 28 points.
The total score was 1522 to 1494.
; WASHINGTON, Seflt. 5.-Had the Brit
ish been astride as serviceable horses as
those which the Boers rode, there would
have been a different tale to tell in South
Africa, according to a report made by
Mr. Curren, the Under Secretary of State
for Agriculture in British South Africa,
which Consul General Stowe has trans
mitted to the State Department. The
South African horse, it is stated, can live
on much less food than his English broth
er; he does not topple into holes, he Is
sounder, more sensible, will stand with
out being hitched and is altogether better
fitted fcr the purposes of warfare.
?V Â£ Â°P Hartzell. missionary Bishop of
the Me:hod:st Episcopal church in Af
rica, said the war was merely an incident
of Anglo-Saxon civilization's expansion.
Dr. Leonard of New York thanked God
for what Great Britain was doing in South
Africa, and expressed the hope that the
war would soon end with the union jack
floating.
An armored train was derailed at
Â¦b, U ! 1| t 8 . Station on Monday last, three
British being killed and five wounded.

CAPE TOWN, Sept. 5.â Sheepner's com
mando, consisting of 300 men and 600
horses, appears to have reached the limit
or its southern raid and to have turned
to the northward, having gained some re
cruits. One hundred mounted men have
been following, endeavoring to unite with
bheepner's commando, but have been un
able to overtake it.
To-morrow there will be an Informal
reception to the Vice President, and at 11
o clock he will go to Isle la Motte for the
annual dinner of the Vermont Fish and
Game League.
At 10 o'clock the annual banquet of the
society was held at the Van Ness House.
Speeches were delivered by Vice President
Roosevelt and United States Senator
Proctor.
'/The lesson taught by the great war
could only .be imperfectly taught by 'any
lesser war. Nevertheless not a little good
has been done- by this struggle as that
which ended in procuring independence
foriCuba and to giving to the Philippines
a freedom to which they could not have
attained had we permitted them to fall
in anarchy or under tyranny. It was a
pleasant thing to see the way In which
men came forward from every walk of
life, from every section of the country, as
soon as the call to arms occurred. The
need was small and easily met, and not
one in a hundred of the ardent young.fel
lows who pressed forward to enter the
army had a â¢ chance to see any service
whatever. But it was good to see the
spirit of '61 had not been lost."
Mayor Hawley gave a brief address of
welcome and the Vice President was then
Introduced. He spoke of the measure of
obligation of the country to the Union
soldiers of the Civil War and the lessons
that the war taught.
Touching upon the recent war with
Spain the Vice President said:
This evening Colonel' Roosevelt deliv
ered an address at the public meeting of
the â¢ Vermont Officers' Reunion Society,
held -at the Howard Opera-house. - The
building was crowded to the doors. For
mer Governor E. J. Ormsbee, president of
the society, was in the chair.
Senator Proctor accompanied him to
this city. They were met at the railway
station by Legrand B. Cannon, whose
guests they are to-night. Troops E and
H of the Eleventh United States Cavalry,
from Fort Ethan Allen, acted as escort,
and there was some cheering as the pro
cession marched through tne streets to
Colonel Cannon's residence.
BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 5.â Vice Pres
ident Roosevelt arrived in this city thla
afternoon by special train from Proctor,
where he was the guest of Senator Proc

Southern Pacific Division System Di
vision No. 53 of the. Order of Railway
Telegraphers has just held Its regular
election for officers for the ensuing two
years, and on October 1 the newly chosen
officials will take charge.
This division is the largest single di
vision connected with the Order of Rail
w a . 2 r , Tele 8^ a Phers, and la the most com
pletely organized in the United States. It
comprises all of the lines of the Southern
Pacific Company from San Francisco on
the west to Ogden on the east, Portland
on the north and New Orleans on the
south. On these lines nearly every train
dispatcher, telegrapher operator and sta
tion agent Is a member of the order
which is one of the nve great railroad
brotherhoods. There has never been any
friction between the order and the rail
road and It has worked in harmony and
accord with both the officials of the com
pany and the other brotherhoods.
W. E. Davidson of thla city was elected
general chairman for all of the lines with
three assistants from the Pacific sys
tem of the Southern Pacific Company, and
two assistants from the Atlantic system.
This corps of men is the governing body
of the order on the lines of the Southern
Pacific Company. When there is any dif
ference between members of the order
and the company this body adjusts It.
VV hen George Estes was removed from
the position of general chairman, W E
Davidson was appointed by Grand Presi
dent Dolphin, and at the recent election
Mr. Davidson was unanimously elected to
the position to which he had been appoint
ed. The following assistants were elected-

Pierce would not say that all negotia
tions had been broken off, and his inti
mation that the Amalgamated Association
is willing to arbitrate differences would
indicate that all efforts for peace have
not been abandoned.
The only approach to a statement of
the condition of affairs was made by
Trustee John Pierce to-day, who said it
was Impossible to accept the proposition
made by the United States Steel Cor
poration, as by doing so some of the
members of the Amalgamated Association
would suffer. "It would be unjust to our
members," said Pierce, "to accept such
terms. We have made no counter prop
osition and still Insist on the terms made
and are willing to arbitrate the difficul
ties. The committee that visited Presi
dent Schwab had no authority from the
Amalgamated Association to settle the
dispute. The members were acting on
their own responsibility. The strike is in
the same position to-day as it was before
the conference was held in New York
yesterday. The local situation is prac
tically unchanged, but it is in better
shape than it was last week. We have
made some gains and are still confident
that we will win. It will be impossible
for the combination to operate its plants
satisfactorily without the aid of Amalga
mated Association men."
It is the belief of those who are familiar
with the strike proceedings throughout
that the two gentlemen have started on
another unannounced and mysterious
visit to New York. It is believed that
the morning session of the advisory board
must have decided upon a plan by Â¦which
President Shaffer could go to New York
and complete the arrangement for peace,
which it is supposed was started by the
conference yesterday between the steel
magnates and the presidents of the sev
eral trades unions. v .
The day was spent by the Amalgamated
advisory board in secret conference, be
hind doors that were guarded closer than
ever before. The newspaper deadline was
drawn most effectually. When the final
adjournment for the day came at about
6:30 p. m. those who had been inside head
quarters refused to say a word in answer
to insistent questions and volunteered no
statement. When the meeting was over
it was learned for the first time that Pres
ident Shaffer had not been with his col
leagues during the afternoon, and his
whereabouts up to 11 o'clock to-night is
unknown. Secretary ' Williams also dis
appeared shortly after the adjournment
and he, too, cannot be located.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Sept. 5.â The prevail
ing opinion in Plttsburg to-night is that
the great steel strike is practically set
tled, but absolutely nothing, positive can
be learned from either side' to the con
troversy.
The pamphlet containing the above
statement was mailed to each of the
teachers appointed, but attention was not
called to the fact that the privilege of
buying supplies at the Government com
missary had been discontinued. The
Government was compelled to cut off
these privileges both to stop frauds,
which were discovered to be due to its
operation, and also to satisfy the regular
merchants in- the islands, who were com
plaining that the furnishing of supplies
by the United States was closing one of
their main channels of revenue.
It Is also proposed to establish stores similar
to the army commissary stores for the benefit
of civilian employes. The stores will be well
stocked with provisions and other necessaries
and civilian employes probably will be able. to
purchase from . these stores at about 10 per
cent above the . cost to the Government.
Many of the Americans secure rooms with
private families and board in meases, the pro
visions being purchased from the commissary.
The food obtained from the commissary stores
Is the best and the average cost for room and
board for those who live in this manner Is
about $35 a month. /
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.â The cabled:
report from Manila to the effect that the
newly arrived American teachers at a
mass meeting yesterday decided- to cable
to the President complaining that prom
ised commissary privileges were denied
them and that they found their expenses
double, what *they were assured they
might expect attracted much attention at
the War Department. The privilege of
purchasing commissary stores at the Gov
ernment warehouses in the Philippines
was taken away from all civilian em
ployes by an order of the Secretary of
War issued In June, and as that order
was widely published, it was presumed
that the teachers who sailed subsequent
to its issuance were aware of its exist
ence. The letter and circular Issued by
the War Department to applicants for
these positions in the Philippines contain
no direct statement upon the subject of
commissary privileges, but the promise
that they would have these privileges
might have been assumed from state
ments contained in a "manual of informa
tion in relation to the Philippine civil serv
ice," which was published in Manila early
in the present year and to which atten
tion was Invited by Colonel Edwards,
chief of the division of insular affairs, in
his circular to applicants. This circular,
in setting forth the conditions in the isl
ands for Americans seeking positions
there, contains the following regarding
the purchase of commissary supplies:

Justice Frear said the labor problem
was one of the most difficult of solution
in the islands. There is a dearth of cheap
labor on account of the Chinese exclusion
laws, which apply there as elsewhere in
the United States. The plantation owners
are compelled to rely on the. few Japanese
and importations of Porto RIcans.
"It is -reasonably certain that the next
Legislature will be Republican. The-Re
publican organization at the last election
was apathetic. Now that it has seen the
result of its lack of patriotism it is likely
to awaken and capture the two houses of
the governing body."
"All of Governor Dole's troubles with
the Legislature' are due to the incompe
tency of the members of that body, i The
Royalists are unused to self : government,
of course, and whatever they do is di
rectly against the . interests of the gov
ernment. They have insured the defeat
of their own party at the next election
through their inability to accomplish any
thing for it.
Justice Frear Is a son of the Rev. Mr.
and Mrs. Walter Frear of 1461 Tenth ave
nue, East Oakland. He is here with his
wife on a visit. They will remain here a
week before leaving for the East for a
two months' trip, after which they will
return to the islands. â¢ Justice Frear is
well known in Oakland and Santa Cruz,
where he lived before he went to Hawaii,
ten years ago. He has been successful
in law there. His first appointment was
to the Circuit bench by yueen Liliouka
lani. When the territory became the prop
erty of the United States he was elevated
to the Supreme bench.
"I had a talk with Governor Dole just
the day. before I left Honolulu," said Jus
tice Frear. "He had just returned from,
a vacation and appeared to be enjoying
the best of health. I asked him If it was
true that he was going to resign, and he
said it was not. He said he felt nrst rate
and meant to stay in office until he was
forced to get out.- There is a bitter polit
ical struggle going on in the islands, but
he does not mind that.
That Governor 1 Dole entertains any
thought of resigning the gubernatorial of
fice in Hawaii is emphatically denied by
Chief Justice W.'F. Frear of the Supreme
Court- of yie . Territory of Hawaii. Â» The
Justice says that during a personal inter
view with Governor Dole the day before
he left the islands the Governor said that
he had no intention to resign Ills office
either on account of his health, which he
declared was the best, in spite of reports
to the contrary, or for any other reason,
and that he would continue to hold the
reins of government, notwithstanding the
bitter political light being made against
him. - Â¦Â¦:- .

ASTORIA, Sept. 5.â Three Alaska can
nery supply ships, the North Star, I?ate
Davenport and Prussia, returned to port
to-day, bringing reports of a most suc
cessful season. The pack on Nushagak
River is unprecedentedly heavy, and the
cannery of the .Columbia River Packers'
Association established a new record for
a first year's pack with 24,000 cases. The
Alaska Fishermen's Packing Company of
this city packed 47,760 cases and the Port
land Alaska Packing Company 20,000
cases. In Unimak Pass the Prussia
passed a â¢ three-masted schooner painted
white which had been driven ashore.
Tents had been erected on the beach and
it was presumed that members of the
crew were living there. The name of the
schooner could noU be learned.

night notified .the foreign Ministers that
the imperial edicts providing for the sign

This announcement, made immediately

His examination was comparatively brief
and. his cross-examination much shorter.-
He was taken over the now familiar,
ground of the history of United States

manipulation of which the present charge
against Dimmick is based. He testified
to this voucher having been counted as
cash during the month of April, 1900. He
told of Dimmick's taking it up. He knew,
the transaction" was irregular, but did not
remember how he came by the know
ledge or whether Dimmick or Cashier
Cole had ever spoken to him about it.
He told of that depositary . for every

George Robinson, a dapper . young man
of 18 years, who hails from the sunny
South, trotted j a merry heat over the
primrose path Wednesday evening, but
the brakes .were put on him out at Su
tro baths while *ie was reltlng tales of
the South to two young ladies.
C. A. .Worth, a boss drayman at 31S
Market street, appeared upon the scene
with his two sons and brought Robinson
up with a sharp turn. They ruthlessly
dragged him from the young ladies, and
Worth senior charged him with having
embezzled $97 73 of his funds.
Robinson, who had been in Worth's em
ploy for but one day, admitted . his guilt
and accompanied the drayman and his
sons to their residence at 1199 Golden Gate
avenue. Â¦ >.*-.
Here he was made a prisoner for the
night. He was promised freedom, accord
ing to his story, if he would return the
money or induce his friends to make good
his deficiency. The young fellow had
spent most of. the money and his friends
failed to respond to his call for aid. Then
he sent a telegram to his father, who is
a business man of St." Augustine, Fla.,
explaining his predicament, and while
awaiting an answer the Worths, he says,
held him prisoner in the parlor of their
residence. The sons alternated as- his
guard during the long night.
"At. 8 o'clock yesterday morning his guard
felfhunger gnawing at his vitals and aft
er locking the door repaired to the dining
room. Robinson, who had been feigning
sleep, took advantage of the opportunity
offered for escape. . He raised a window,
jumped. into the garden -and then set sail
down Golden Gate avenue.
The Worths were. not slow to learn of
his escape and went Jn pursuit of the
young embezzler, shouting "Stop thief!"
Their cries attracted the attention of two
policemen, ;who captured the fleeing
Southerner and .led him to the Central
Station, where. he was later in the day
booked for felony embezzlement.
Sportive women and an appetite for
wine caused Robinson's downfall, but the
strangest part of the whole story is the
fact that; Drayman Worth would entrusl
his funds to a perfect stranger. He want
ed a collector and a special policeman
who is guarding one of his drays recom
mended Robinson. The young fellow start
ed out Wednesday in his patent leather
shoes, adorned with startling red laces,'
to collect Worth's bills. He made a few
collections and turned -the money over to
his employer. â¢
This fact insured Worth's confidence, so
he gave Robinson another batch of bills
to collect. When he failed to return that
afternoon Worth divined that something
was wrong, so he and his sons played de
tectives and prison keepers with the re
sult stated.
Robinson, who is evidently of good fam
ily and breeding, says he was never in
trouble before and cannot explain why
he was tempted to appropriate his em
ployer's funds. The â¢ solution apparently
rests in his infatuation for Louise Hayes,
a young woman residing at a Market-
Street rooming house. For her he
says he spent most of the money, and
also declares he gave her $25 to keep for
him. The woman, who appeared at po
lice headquarters last night shrouded in
a Raglan coat, denies his assertions. The
Worths refuse to discuss the case.
Hartman when seen at his home last
night denied that he had embezzled. He
referred his interviewer to Secretary Mar
liave. He admitted, however, that he had
resigned his position as collector of the
club.
Hartman's mode of withholding the
money was a simple one. Whenever he
collected dues instead of turning: the
money In he would 'inform Secretary Mar
liave that the member was not In when
he called.
Secretary Marliave replied that there
must be some mistake, as his books did
not show that the August dues had been
paid. The member, to prove his assertion,
went to his ofllce and found the receipt,
which was turned over to the secretary.
Hartman's attention was called to the
omission and lie weakly tried to explain
the matter. An investigation into his ac
counts proved him to be a defaulter and
he was threatened with imprisonment.
Hartman told Ihe secretary it was not his
Intention to embezzle the money, and that
he had simply used It to 'assist certain
friends who were pressed for coin.
Hartman's embezzlement would not
have been discovered had not a member
gone personally to the secretary and paid
his September dues. He was then in
formed that his August, dues were still
unpaid, and was greatly surprised. He
said he had turned the money over to the
collector on August 1 and had his receipt
to prove his assertion.
Â¦vThen charged with the offense Hart
man admitted his embezzlement but
pleaded for mercy. He promised to re
pay the money taken, and on this
promise alone was he permitted to escape
prosecution. Having reimbursed the club,
he was told that his services as collector
would no longer be needed, and then he
resigned. j â¢
Hartman had been employed as collector
for a year and each month handled many
hundreds' of dollars. It was his duty to
visit the places of business of the mem
bers and collect their dues. Each night
he would turn over the money collected
to Edward C. Marliave, manager of the
club. The latter would then credit the
members in his books. This plan has been
followed ever since the organization of
the club, and no fault has been found
with the system until a week ago. when
It was discovered that the collector was
withholding sums of money. for his own
use.
Emil H. Hartman, a collector for the
Saa Francisco Club, who lives at 1634
Howard street, violated his trust and was
forced to resign his position a few days
ago. He was short a few hundred dollars
in his accounts, and but for the. kindness
of friends who reimbursed the club Hart
man might have been p-csecuted for his
unlawful act.

Oil Case Is Now Under Ad
visement by Commis
sioners.
Attorney Short, representing the oil peo
ple of Bakersfleld, closed his case yes
terday before- the Railroad Commission
ers. At the end of the attorney's remarks
Commissioner Kdson i said that as there
was considerable evidence to go over, a
decision would not be reached until the
next meeting of the Railroad Commis
sioners on October 8.
To those who are opposed to corpora
tions and railroad combines the closing
argument of Attorney Short would have
been a real treat. He scored the South
ern Pacific In broad terms and said that
the company had in the past, and would
in the future, charge the people of Cali
fornia, as long as they could, all they
thought they would pay without rebel
ling. .
He fired a parting shot at the Hunting^
tons which caused a hearty laugh. He>
replied to Attorney Norton's remark that
the railroad magnates found plenty of
ways of spending money, which they ob
tained from the public by imposing un
just rates.
"What do they do with their money?"
said Short. "Why they build magnificent
residences which they never live in. and
then, when their daughters and nieces
marry European princes It costs them
money."
Attorney Short appeared to take a
strange dislike to Solicitor Norton, who
represented the Santa Fe Company. Nor
ton criticized Short's arguments and
wound up by saying: "Mr. Short is young
and has not had much experience In the
legal profession."
Attorney Short told the Railroad Com
missioners that the oil men had kept
away from the investigation as he con
sidered that their presence would have
no effect either way. He referred to the
wheat rate from Ogden west, which ho
said was absurdly small in comparison
with the present oil rate charges from
Bakersfleld to this city.

AUDITOR ANGERS
CITY TREASURER
Brooks Claims Right to
Recognize All Court
Orders.
Says Wells Is Ignorant of the
: Amendment Passed by
Legislature.
l
City and County Treasurer Brooks is up
in arms against Auditor Wells because
the latter official stated yesterday that he
would hold the former personally respon
sible for paying two court orders which
did not bear the Auditor's signature.
Brooks asserts that he has acted within
the law, and â¢ Incidentally remarks that
"Wells is ignorant of an amendment adopt
ed at the last session of the Legislature
which empowers the Treasurer to pay
orders for repairs or improvements to
courtrooms- which have been certified by
Superior Judges without the signature of
any other official.
The controversy between the two of
ficials named originated over the payment
of two demands of the Golden Gate Elec
trical Company for electrical work in the
chambers of Judges Lawlor and Cook.
Brooks believed that he had the right to
pay the demands on presentation under
the amendment numbered 144 of the stat
utes and amendments to the Political
Code, which reads as follows:
If suitable rooms for holding 1 the Superior
Courts and the chambers of the Judges of said
courts ere not provided In any county by the
Supervisors thereof, together with the attend
ants, furniture, fuel, lights and stationery
sufficient for the transaction of business, the
courts or the Judge or Judges thereof may
direct the Sheriff of the county to provide such
rooms, attendants, furniture, fuel, lights and
stationery, and the expenses incurred, certified
by the Judge or Judges to be correct, are a
charge against the county treasury and must
be paid out of the general fund thereof.
The demands called for $4S2, and Brooks,
deeming them exorbitant when they were
first presented, thought it best to refer
the holder to the Board .of Supervisors.
After the demands had been before sev
eral committees the board on their recom
mendation rejected them, as it had not or
dered the work. The demands were then
returned to Judges Lawlor and Cook, who
directed City Electrician Hewitt to in
quire into the actual cost of doing the
work. Hewitt scaled the bills down to $302
and they were forwarded by Judge Law
lor to Brooks, with a personal communi
cation certifying that the charge â¢was
proper. On that showing Brooks paid the
demands, as he had a perfect right to do
under the amendment just quoted. The
statutes provide that the Treasurer has
power to pay court orders without neces
sitating the Auditor's signature thereto,
and he will continue to do so when they
are presented to him.
