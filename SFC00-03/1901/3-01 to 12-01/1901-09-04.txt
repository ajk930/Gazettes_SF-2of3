In replying to questions concerning' the
difficulty between, himself and Smith,

misunderstood statements, as there was
no such discontent in the little Island of
Guam as far as he knew. He said that,
as far as he was aware, the relations be
tween himself and Smith were of the
pleasantest character, but that the sec

satisfied "with conditions in the island, as
they were no doubt vastly different from
what had been anticipated.

It was said at the Navy Department to

the positions of the Spanish ships In the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba, were exam
ined by Judge Advocate General Lemly
to-day with respect to the evidence they
will submit before the court of inquiry.
Lieutenant Harlow, executive officer of
the Vixen, was examined by Captain
Lemly last week in regard to notes ho
took while the battle was in progress and
the reasons which Induced him to make
changes. It is understood that during the
talk Captain Lemly had with Rear Ad
miral Evans to-day reference was made
to these notes.
There is no doubt as to the' character
of the evidence which will be submitted
by Rear Admiral Evans. His testimony
will be particularly damaging to Rear
Admiral Schley when the coal supply of
the ships of the flying squadron Is in dis
cussion. He will say that there was no
lack of coal on board the Iowa and that
he could almost have steamed to Europe
with the fuel in her bunkers. Â¦'-
- "Mr. Gilkey paid me some attention last
winter and I liked him. He has the man
ners of a gentleman and good habits, but
when my mother began to see that a seri
ous engagement might result from our
acquaintance she showed me plainly that
a marriage to a young man In Mr. Gil
key's financial position would not be wise.
His income was then $60 a month. I liked
him as a friend, but as a husband he
would never do. When I was ill Colonel
Northam, whom I had then known but a
short time, was much kinder and more
attentive to me than was Mr. Gilkey.
Mrs. Northam, when seen to-night, said:
"Mr. Gilkey and I may have Imagined we
were in love, but I for my part know now
that I was mistaken. I am positive that
I never really loved any one till I met
Colonel Northam.
Gilkey declared to-night - that his en
gagement to Miss Stoney had never been
broken; that he had many letters from,
her expressing her devotion to him, writ
ten at different times during their ac
quaintance. He first learned of her mar-'
riage to Colonel Northam through the
newspaper accounts of the ceremony.
The complaint alleges that Mrs.
Northam on or about April 1 of this year
promised to marry the plaintiff and that
the wedding had actually been . arranged
for August 15. The plaintiff says . that,
confiding In this promise, he has contin
ued unmarried and has been and. Is now
ready to marry the defendant. He says
that Miss Stoney*s failure to marry him
has caused him great mental suffering
aiid humiliation." .' ' Â£v&]
The Northams -were married in San Jose
on July 23. He is 62 and she is 20 years
of age. The bride, a tall, handsome
blonde, first met Northam about two
months before their marriage. The col
onel's first wife died on April 9 of the
present year. Gilkey is 22 years old; He
first met Miss Stoney last November,
when she was filling a position as sten
ographer.

Senor Pulido. the Venezuelan Charge

the Government has repelled all the Inva

tillery and stores. Except . for , these pre
cautionary measures of defense, the

All Invasions Repelled.
Colombia also, 'it Is said to-night, has
made response to the, note of Secretary
Hay. While Its contents are not obtain
able, the statement is 'made that it is con
ciliatory In character and expresses an
earnest wish that war with Venezuela
may be avoided. Such a result, it Is
Etated, would be a' cause of genuine re
gTet to the people of Colombia. Colombia,
It Is said, stands to avert war, 'and re
poses full confidence in the latter country.
Friendly Responses Received.
The text of Hay's telegram has not
been made public It is understood that
an acknowledgment of Its receipt has
been made by the Venezuelan Govern
ment, but Its purport has not been made
public, although It is said to be friendly
In tone, and while charging invasion by
Colombian forces on the Venezuelan bor
der and referring to the temporary sus
pension of diplomatic intercourse which
has occurred, the way appears to be open
for explanations. Venezuela has not de
clared war against Colombia.
It Is ascertained that on August 24, dur
ing Secretary Hay's recent visit to Wash
ington, a telegraphic message was sent to
the Ministers at Caracas and Bogota, di
recting them to inform the foreign secre
taries of Venezuela and Colombia of the
distress with which the President had
heard of the likelihood of a disturbance
of the relations between these two repub
lics. Adverting to the possibility of the
Influence of the United States being ex
erted to compromise the pending ques
tions, the Ministers were directed to say
that, while the relations of this Govern
ment -with both nations are equally inti
mate and friendly and every opportunity
Is taken to show the good-will we bear
them, an offer of the President's kindly
offices to arrange any differences which
may exist between Colombia and Venez
uela would be ineffective without the ac
quiescence of both. Nevertheless, Inspired
by the sentiments which are common to
all the governments of the American re
publics, the United States would sincere
ly deplore a breach of the amicable rela
tions that at this time happily exist be
tween the sister nations of the Western
World, and would especially regret any
action by either of them which might
menace the security of transit across the
Isthmus or the neutrality of Its territory,
and thereby constrain the Government of
the United States to consider its respon
sibilities and functions under existing
treaty engagements with Colombia.
Uncle Sam's Good Offices.
Minister Sllva said that Colombia had
suffered much from the actions of Vene
zuela. The closing of traffic on the Seulla
River had practically killed the great cof
fee industry of Colombia, which centers
about Cucuta, In thep rovlnce of Santan
Â«er.
"When I was Secretary of State of Co
lombia last September." said Dr. Eilva,
â¢'General Andrade and two of his e'up
porters came to Bogota and saw the Pres
ident of Colombia and the members of the
Cabinet and urged us to aid them In over
throwing President Castro. They repre
sented that Castro-was -aiding: Colombian
insurgents and that he should be justified
5n espousing their cause. We absolutely
refused. Colombia has continued to main
tain this attitude toward Venezuela, and
no official of our Government has ever
been connected with the 'movements of
Venezuelan insurgents."
Colombia Has Been Fair.
Minister Sllva emphatically denies that
the Colombian Government has In any
way supported or encouraged the bands
ef Venezuelan insurgents who have or
ganized on the Colombian border and
have Invaded Venezuela.
Colombian Minister in Washington, thinks
that President Castro's note to the pow
ers has added to the seriousness of the
situation, because It -will tend to inflame
the people of Venezuela against Colombia.
The Minister Is convinced that the people
of Venezuela an a Â¦whole would be glad
to live on terms of peace -with the neigh
boring republic, but he fears that they
will accept as trne the representations
made by President Castro regarding the
eititude of Colombia toward Venezuela.

BISHOP WELLS
OM REMARRIAGE
At the conclusion of the conference At
torney General Knox said he would give
the matter prompt attention and would
likely present his conclusion to the Presi
dent.
Humphries, Judge of the Circuit Court of
the First Judicial Circuit, _Territory_ of
Hawaii, who Is under charges by mem
bers of the Bar Association of . the . Ha-'
wailan Islands, who ask for. his removal,
and F. W. Yankee, who represents the
Bar Association in the controversy, held
a conference with Attorney General Knox
to-day.
The substance of the charges is that
Judge Humphries controls and Is actively
engaged in the publication of a partisan
newspaper while exercising the powers
and performing the duties . of Circuit
Court Judge; that he takes an active part
in bitter political controversies; that he
uses his powers as Judge to promote his
own personal and political ends; that he
la harsh, tyrannical and vindictive toward
members of the bar and others, and that
he has held in disregard the obligations
devolving upon him as Judge and has
brought the same into public disrepute
and under suspicion.
In his reply Judge Humphries says that
he owns a controlling interest in the Hon
olulu Republican, but upon receipt of his
commission as Judge he severed all con
nection with the editorial policy or utter
ances of the paper. He says that he has
taken a deep interest In politics, but de
nies that he has ever been perniciously
active or has taken any part in politics
unworthy of his position upon the bench.
He also denies that he has made any im
proper use of the powers vested in him
as Judge, or that he has been harsh or
tyrannical in his treatment of attorneys
practicing before him. or that he has held
In disregard the obligations devolving
upon him as Judge.
The charges and specifications, in print
ed form, cover 2% pages, and the Judge's
reply nfty-nve pages. Each charge is ac
companied by a large number of exhibits,
as is each answer.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The Sheriff of Marin County intervened,
for he visited this city yesterday and in
formed the young men who have been
making merryâ as they refer to their
orgiesâ that they must moor their arks at
some spot more remote from Greenbrae
and the Marin shore. He warned them
that if they refused he would swoop down
upon their merry friends some propitious
evening and have the "ladies" do an
Amazon march to jail, while the "gentle
men" would wend their way to cold and
gloomy cells adorned with the finest as
sortment of steel bracelets at his com
mand.
They feelingly consented to remove the
arks, protesting at the same time that
the females who indulged In moonlight
plunges, sans drapery, in the waters
about Wood Island were "real ladies."
The Sheriff was also informed that
the female barytones and mezzo so
pranos, who loaned their talents on
various occasions to the young men,
who, by the way. are supposed by their
relatives to be "baching" it In the horse
car ark and the Nemo, sang in various
church choirs. They hurled logic at the
Sheriff, declaring that songs from such tal
ented and pious young women could cer
tainly not have disturbed the peace or.
mind nor their actions shocked the mod
esty of James W. Deart and his family,
B. D. Dean and his family, J. H. Har
rison and others. â¢ â¢
Now J. W. Dean is manager of the ma
rine department of the Home Fire and
Marine Insurance Company, his brother
is connected with the Crocker- Woolworth
Bank and Mr. Harrison serves the Scot
tish American Insurance Company. They
firmly declare that they know something
about music as well as the propriety of
things, and firmly declare that everything
that happened on those arks from Satur
day afternoons to Sunday nights rasped
their nerves, nearly shattered the drums
of their ears and caused them to blush
until their faces felt sunburned. -'-
From the stories the Deans tell, and
they are the owners of Wood Island, the
young men of the Nemo and horse car
arks have slumbered most of the days
and filled the nights with thunder, and
redflrÂ© Â¦ * '
One Incident served to amuse the Deans.
It appears that a young man on the
Nemo called oat, "Jennie, will you have
a drink?" and she responded in a voice
that caused a heavy swell on that part
of the bay with that touching ballad,
"Always, Always." â¢ .
"I never saw any of the women In bath-
Ing " said J. W. Dean, "but I have seen
the 'young men bathing, minus their bath
ing clothes, In the presence of women.
Then the language and the songs they
sang. The females must be ladlesâ real
ladles. We are all glad that they are go
ing to give Wood Island a wide berth."
"They say such things and they do such
things" on a couple of arks over at Green
brae that Sheriff Taylor has been called
upon by the more peaceful and refined
Mariners to intervene.

VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 3.â Charles
Spencer, a Briton, who worked hjs way
from the Orient on the Empress of China,
is here endeavoring to have a claim for
damages on account of alleged false im
prisonment in Manila by General Otis
pressed against the United States Gov
ernment. Spencer, who was formerly In
the National Guard in Hawaii, arrived In
Manila on December 6, 1898, with the First
Tennessee Regiment on the City of
Puebla. He claims that after December
6, up to the outbreak of hostilities, he
dealt in curios and handled other commis
sions for A. W. Prautsch of Manila.
After February he stopped with the First
Colorados for a week and went out with
the advance on Caloocan. He assisted the

hospital corps in taking care of the
wounded on the battlefield, and claims to
have come and gone between Manila and
the lines, awaiting the advance to Mala
bon.
Spencer's story of his arrest and deten
tion follows:
I was out at Caloocan as usual on February
24, expecting that an attack would be made on
Malabon, and had decided to return to Ma
nila. For some time It was dangerous to go
backward and forward from thÂ» line, on ac
count of rebel sharpshooters, and It was usual
for three or four to go together. I was sitting
on the railroad track about 100O yards from
headquarters reading & newspaper and waiting
for some soldiers to come along who were go-
Ing Into town. Two soldiers approached. I
asked them If they were going to town, and
In reply they asked me what regiment I be
longed to and who I was. Their tone was so
Insulting that I told them that It was none
of their business. They took me In charge
and carried me before General Otla. whose
headquarters was at Caloocan.
General Otis asked me to give an account
of myself from December 6 to that date. My
story did not satisfy the general and he sent
me to Manila, and I was taken before Major
Strong at Molate. I was questioned as on
my former examination, except that the major
asked me what I was doing with maps In my
possession. This was the first time I heard
anything about being suspected of having
plans In my possession. Â¦ I was then taken
before Colonel Trench and the same questions
were asked me. I was placed In prison and re
mained there for months.
I don't know anything about maps or draw-
Ings and cannot find wfeat connection the au
thorities claim I had with them.. I cannot
speak Spanish or Tagalo, and never had any
connection with the rebel forces.

BRITON IMPRISONED AS A SPY
HAS A CLAIM AGAINST AMERICA
Who Elvira Garcia was "â¢ no one then
knew, nor did Reed either In his will or
otherwise see fit to offer the slightest
explanation of his bequest. Elvira was
found to be the daughter of Mrs. Francis
Wood of San Francisco. The property
left to the child includes El Campo and
considerable land in California City. At
the time it was believed the family would
contest the will, but this it declined to
do, thereby adding another phase to the
mystery.
Several days ago Attorney Thomas P.
Boyd, on behalf of Vidal, petitioned for a
distribution to him in trust of the estate
of little Elvira. The opposition filed this
morning asks that the property be dis
tributed direct to her, notwithstanding
the terms of the will. The opposition re
lies upon the late decision of the Supreme
Court in the Fair estate case, wherein
"euch trusts were declared illegal. The
case will be heard In the Superior Court
on September 10.
At the time of bis death John J. Reed
was one of the largest land holders in this
county. He resided with his wife and two
crown children, a. son and a daughter, on
his beautiful property at Reeds Station.
Prior to his death he deeded much of his
land to the children. After his demise
his will developed a sensation. By Its
terms about $50,000 worth of property was
bequeathed to Gusto Vidal, his executor,
to .be held in trust for Elvira Garcia until
she should attain her majority.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 3.â The mysterious
bequest of the late John J. Reed of $50,
000 worth of property to eight-year-old
Elvira Garcia, the daughter of Mrs.
Francis "Wood of San Francisco, was
again brought to public notice to-day,
when Attorney G. W. Towle, on behalf of
the child, filed, an opposition to the dis
tribution of the estate as prayed for in

MANY CHANCES
IN THE FACULTY
TACOMA, Sept. 3.â The Alsak River in
Alaska was explored for the first time
this Burner I by Morton Maynon, formerly
of Oakland, Cal. Maynon had been a
member of the crew, of the steamer
Islander until July, when he left her to
engage ,~ In - prospecting. .. Hiring Klinena
Bill, a Chllkat Indian guide, and the lat
ter's squaw, Susie, he determined to see
a&j unmapped; portion of. Southeastern
Alaska, With the squaw to cook and Bill
to pack goods Maynon reached. the head-'
waters of the Alsak, having traveled by
canoe to the Porcupine district and thence
across to the- headwaters of the Klahena
River by. packhorses. Â¦ -. Â¦
Maynon found that- the Klahena heads
In a vast rolling moorland at an altitude
of 2000 feet. , This great moor is fairly
alive with marmots. Lower down the
mountain the country is spotted with open
places, interspersed with woodlands. The
open places afford luxuriant forage for
horses and cattle. Following up the Kla
hena,. they discovered, the glacier which
feeds that stream.
The country is of limestone formation
and the rocks are easily worn by water.
At one place the water had worn its way
through a tunnel nearly fifty feet long,
forming a massive natural bridge. Many
caverns were found, filled with stalactites
and stylagmites. .... â¢ â¢ Â¦
Lower down- the stream Maynon, and his
companions., had. .two" thrilling 'escapes
from death,- first, while killing cinnamon
bears,- and, ..later. Trom going-over high
falls on the lower reaches of the Alsak.
-Where> they camped over night cinnamon
bears were observed coming -down to the
river in twos and threes to .fish for sal
mon. It was\a curious sight to see the
great, clumsy monsters paw out salmon
upon the bank and ; then suck the flesh
from the bones. -
.Maynon and the Indian resolved to kill
at least one bear apiece the following
night. To avoid the swarming of mosqui
toes the squaw made them mosquito armor
consisting of, an ointment of drying sal
mon oil and spruce pitch. There being no
darkness at that season, â¢ Maynon and his
guide took their station behind rocks at
midnight. .
They had waited scarcely an hour when
the bears began to appear. Selecting the
largest two they fired simultaneously.
Both monsters showed fight, and rushed
upon the hunters. The latter shot repeat
edly,-but the bears were within twelve
feet of them before the bullets finally
brought them down.
Â¦Two nights : later, while t drifting ' down
stream they approached the edge of a
high cataract and saved themselves from
going. over it- only after a hard struggle
by stopping their raft against a projecting
rock, , upon which they climbed. The raft
went over the falls, and they were com
pelled to build one below the rapids.

Since the promoters of the St. Louis,

building east from St Louis, announced
that Clinton, Mo., la to be the line's des

ranged for the purchase of the old Blair
line from Kansas City to Clinton. This
road Is one of the two now owned by the
Frisco system that parallel each other
from Kansas City to Clinton. They are
so close together that one company can
hardly use both.

this afternoon after she had raced over a

a smooth sea. She went out to make
good Mr. Lawson's promise to Boston
people that he would race the Independ

sionists saw the yacht as she tried her
speed against the best fishermen which
go out for the sport, and it was like a

the title to which has practically lapsed
of late years because of the Government

the British and German concessions. The
American need for. the concession is
chiefly for military uses, so as to avoid
the experiences of last summer, when the

Preident Bowerrnan to-day devoted the
principal part of his address to this topic,
declaring that the union fundB were
threatened with demolishment and that
the position was intolerable. He said the
Parliamentary committee favored an al
teration of the constitutions of the unions
with the object of minimizing their liabil
ity.
The House of Lords' decision of July 22
reversed the decision of the Appeal Court,
which dissolved the injunction rendered
August 30, 1900. in the High Court of Jus
tice, enjoining officials of the Amalga
mated Society of Railway Servants from
"watching and besetting" a railroad sta
tion and approaches with a view to in
ducing non-unionists to refrain from tak
ing the places of the strikers. The House
then held that it was not the intention of
the Legislature to prevent a trades union
from being sued if through Its officers it
is guilty of illegalities.
Besides this ruit the Taffvale Railroad
Is suing the Amalgamated Society of Rail
way Servants for Â£20,000 damages, in
curred as a result of the strike of 1900.
These suits will be strenuously defended,
but their seriousness puts in the shade
almost every other topic of dlscusioh.

PITTSBURGH Sept 8.â Developments
t^nlay In the steel strike show sains for
the manufacturers. The accession of
thirty-two skilled men to the Star plant,
the Increased production at the Painter
end the Lindsay & McCutcheon mills, tha
defection from the strikers' ranks of sev
-5nty-fivÂ« machinists and pipe cutters at
the Continental Tube Works and fifty at
the Pennsylvania Tube Works, the Im
portation of twelve men to the Monessen
Steel Hoop Mill, and the installation of
three mills on the night turn at the Clark
Mill, all point to an early resumption all
along the line, as viewed by the. steel of
ficials.
The Amalgamated officials, however,
make the assertion that everything is
progressing satisfactorily and say that
much of tne supposed advantage of the
manufacturers is a. bluff and cannot be
made good. As an instance they cite the
l^indsay & McCutcheon plant, where the
company says it has as many men at
work as it can accommodate. The Amal
gamated people declare that James H.yr
ley. vice president of the first district, vis
ited the Lindsay & McCutcheon mill to
day in the guise of a roller seeking work.
He made an inspection of the mill, and
according to his report there are thirty
men at the works, six of Cwhom aro
skilled. The strikers also assert that at
the Monessen plant the product turned
out last week amounted to 250,000 pounds,
while before the strike the daily output
was 100,000 pounds.
Matters at McKeesport to-night are
quiet and to all appearances unchanged.
Strikers point to the fact that the ma
chinists who were persuaded yesterday
to leave the National Tube Works did not
Bo in to-day. The much-talked-of start
of the Demmler plant is still being dis
cussed and the attempt to etart is now
scheduled for the latter part of the week.
At Wheeling the strikers are holding
their own and there Is no Indication of
an attempt to start any of the shut-down
plants. The report from Canal Dover Is
to the effect that, although District Man
ager Cline promised yesterday that four
mills would be fired up this morning,
only one mill was fired. 'The strikers say
this was caused by the desertion of nine
of the non-union men who returned to
Vandergrift. from which place they cams
last Sunday.
Amalgamated leaders In Pittsbnrg do
not believe that there will be any inves
tigation of the charges made by Hickey
at Milwaukee. Secretary Williams said
to-day that if a committee should ccme
here for the purpose it would not be re
ceived by the Amalgamated officials.
President Shaffer, it is said, to-day re
ceived many indorsements of his course
--and encouragement to remain firm. The
is confident and professes to be
entirely satisfied with the progress of the
Etnke.
Packers Will Not Surrender.
OMAHA, Sept. 3.â The packers of

packer said the men were now receiving

SEATTLE, â¢ Sept. 3.â i>. . H. "Wright,
mine-owner and speculator, committed
suicide in Dawson on August 20 by taking
poison. He died after several hours of
dreadful agony.
"Wright was before a magistrate. a few
days previously on a charge of having
slapped his wife's face on several '. occa
sions. He broke down and wept bitterly
and told the magistrate that, a prominent
professional man had alienated the affec
tion of his wife. He said that the man
had called first on a matter : of business
and that later his calls were of another
nature. -Nothing, is known of Wright pre
viousito his coming ;to the Klondike. â¢
After lunch the semi-finals were com

playing on both sides. The* local men
piayed far below form,, and from re
marks by those who should know the vis- ]

California Club team braced in the last
set and showed something like their true

many aces on his swift service and got
in some good shots at the net, but Mc-
Gavin's work was really excellent.
The first match of the day proved the
best. After "four sets of the most bril
liant tennis Smith and McGavin were
pronounced thÂ« winners. But they knew
they had ,been playing tennis; and they
learned once for all what fast tennis in
the hot sun means. It took twenty-two
games to decide the first set. But once
before has such a set been played in a
tournament on the Hotel Rafael courts.
That was in the mixed doubles last week.
The first set went to McGavin and Smith,
as did the second. 6-4. The third was
marked by a decided brace on the part
of the Southerners and by a couple of
hazy decisions by the ump're. -The score
was 6â2, with Bell and, Braley on the
long end. In the fourth the local team
"went to it" with a rush and soon ran
the score up to 4-2. Here, however, the
southern champions braced again, and by
brilliant driving and terrific smashing tied
the score. The next two games, set and
match went to McGavin and Smith; to
tal scoreâ 12-10, C-4. 2-6, fi-1.
A special match has been arranged for
this morning at 10:30 o'clock. At that
hour George F. and Robert N. Whitney,
the coast champions, will meet Alfonso
E. Bell and H. H. Braley, the champions
of Southern California. . ,
Throughout the day the playing of the
southern experts was watched with in
terest. A. IS. Bell i3 by far the most
skillful of the quartet. His playing . is
marked by a swift though rather erratic
drive, a terrific smash and a good serv
ice. In smashing the southern champion
often jumps high off the ground. Both
Bell and Braley exhibited great skill in
returning the deep lobs essayed by their
opponents. Slnsabaugh and Hendricks
show considerable -*iptitud* at the 'net.
Both have swift first services, Â«but- their
jrroun'd strokes do not seem particularly
effective. .
The final match will be played this .aft

Smith should win.
ing finally by a score of 11â 9. Though
close, the play in this match was scarcely
i-xcitlnir.
In the other half R. J. Hunt and P.
Murdock were pitted against McGavin
and Smith. An excellent match .resulted.
Murdock's pretty fore and back hand
drives and smashes and Hunt's all-round
steady play netted many points for the
Alameda team: but McGavin's terrific
clouting and skillful passing, together
with Smith's service and deep lobbing,
finally won the day. : Hunt and Murdock
won the third Set 6â3, and at this point of
the contest seemed to have their oppo
nents going. They lost the fourth set and

Nat Herreshoff spent several hours
aboard the Constitution altering her
trim. The new main sail which was bent
at Bristol when the boat was overhauled
for these trial races was unbent and the
old main sail which she carried when she
first came out was substituted. The cup
committee does not wish to select, the de
fender in a. hurry. It wishes to have the
question of superiority settled definitely.
Therefore a race every day this week
will in all probability be sailed.
NEWPORT. R. I., Sept. 3.â The cup
challenge committee of the New York
Yacht Club-^decided not to send the Con
stitution and the Columbia to race to
day, as had been originally intended.
There were two reasons, the first being
the probability of a day without any
wind, the second that Mr. Duncan wished
to overhaul the Constitution thoroughly
before Fending her to the line again.
So surprised are all connected with the
Constitution at the unsatisfactory show
ing she has been making since she was
hauled out for cleaning at Bristol that a
diver was engaged to-day to examine her
bottom for obstructions to her speed. He
spent a couple of hours under water and
reported that he could discover nothing

McKinney, handled .by Farmer Bunch,
went down to defeat after having two
heats of the 2:40 trot to her credit, Black
Bart turning .up winner.
In the running events first choices

chief surprise being the defeat, in the
Flash stake of Bookmaker Caesar Young's
sprinter, Meehanus, the 2 to 5 favorite.

posite the paddock Midnight broke and
Brown, behind Banker's Daughter, an
nexed the heat In 2:15^*. -The heat winner,
was 6 to 1, the first choice being held a
1 to 3 chance.
Notwithstanding this setback the fa
vorite came out fresh for the fourth and
deciding heat, and when Banker a Daugh
ter went in the air after passing tise h;iif,
the- choice came home at leisure. Our
Boy's Sister made three game ulds for the
purse, but was outfooted, though getting
third money.
Stylish looking Nora . McKinney also
ruled a top heavy - favorite both in
the auction pooling and in the
booking on heats. ' She made pleasant
trips ardund the ellipse, and it was Just
as easy as rolling down Telegraph Hill.
Then after finishing seventh In- the open-

he caught the mare stopping badly, and

was plainly apparent now the McKinney
mare was all in, and .Bart now enjoyed

ered the next two heats like a real gentle

money.
Quite in line with the balance of the field,
which were of the feather-weight variety,
only five went to the post for the Flash

hanus, the mount of McCarthy, was al
ways a warm favorite. After a slight dp
lay Starter Brooks sent, the bunch away

Over " Seabrlght she was put about and

climbed out an the bowsprit, while twelve
manned the balloon jib topsail halyards.
The small jib topsail came down and was

etops was being passed out and snapped
on the stay, bo that In less than four min
utes after the order was given the sail
was set and its sheet trimmed down.
Later the stay sail and jib were taken in

GREATEST BET
EVER RECORDED
Pittsburgers Give Five to
Three on the Cup
Defender.
Four Hundred Thousand
Dollars Put on the
Yacht Race.
PITTSBURG. Sept. 3.â The great inter.
national yacht bet of 5400,000 between an
English syndicate represented by "Walter
J. Klngsley of London and a group of
Pittsburgers, represented by William I.
Mustin. was finally arranged this after
noon. The entire gum was deposited In
the hands of the stakeholder, Mr. Kings
ley turning over $150,000 in British bank
notes and Mr. Mustin giving a certified
check for $250,000. What is said to be tha
greatest bet in history was thus success
fully consummated.
Both Mr. Mustin and Mr. Klngsley ar
rived here thl3 morning. Mr. Mustin com
ing from Asbury Park and Mr. Klngsley
from New York. Mr. Mustin promptly put
Mr. Klngsley in communication with his
principals, who were speedily convinced
that the J15&000 of British money waa
awaiting their convenience, Mr. Kings
ley, on his part, agreed to accept a certi
fied check for the full amount of thÂ«
American side of the wager.
As the name of Darr, Moore & Brydon
had been used repeatedly, without war
rant, in the press of the country as the
probable stakeholder, a conference wa3
held in the office of that .firm. The part
ners went into the matter and decided
that as theirs was an investment busi
ness and stakeholdlng not in their line,
they musy decline to hold the stakes. They
did. however, suggest the name of a citi
zen prominent in financial circles and who
ia known aa far as London, as a possible
stakeholder. This gentleman, when ap
proached, consented to become stake
holder, upon the express condition that
his name should be withheld from the
public, as he doeÂ» not care to share in tha
publicity now enjoyed by those Pitts
burgers who crossed in the Deutschland.
Banknotes and checks were carefully ex
amined and pronounced satisfactory, and
Mr. Kingsley's credentials were examined
with the same result. The stake is to be
paid within one week after the conclud
ing race, the place of meeting to be New
York. The wager is simply $150,000 to
$250,000 that the Shamrock lifts the cup.
There are no conditions as to accident.
Both Mr. Mustin and Mr. Kingsley. the
brokers for their respective syndicates,
,wlll receive handsome commissions. Mr~
Kingsley la to get 5 per cent of the wholÂ»
amount In case the Shamrock wins ana',
2>4 per cent of $150,000 in the event of her
losing.
Mr. Mustin's compensation for hl3 share
In the arrangement of the bet Is 5 per
cent of $250,000, which was paid to him aa
soon as the wager was consummated this
afternoon.
The name of the stakeholder la the one
closely guarded secret In the bet. Tha
names of the men composing the syndi
cate are also kept from the public. "They
are all well known Pittsburg gentlemen."
said Mr. Mustin, "but for obvious reasons
their names are being withheld. They are
backing the American boat because they
anticipate another victory for the Yan
kee skippers and look on the matter with
the eye of business men. However, if the
Englishmen should take the cup away
they would not turn a hair. They have
the spirit of true sportsmen, every one
of them, and if their quarter of a million
should be taken they would be the- first
to say 'bully for Upton.'
"I have acted only as the broker In ar
ranging the bet and now my work Is fin
ished. It came to me in quite the same
manner as any other brokerage business,
and I regret .the notoriety it has given
me."
It was reported that M. K. ItlcMul
lln, a well known Fourth avenue broker,
had Â¦ been selected as the stakeholder.
When asked about the matter to-night
Mr. McMullin disclaimed all knowledge
of the bet and of the yacht race.
A flood of telegrams and cable messages
from all parts of the world arrived at
the Hotel Schenley for Mr. Klngsley yes
terday inquiring about the bet. In aoms
Quarters the bet has been denounced, but
little attention was paid to messages re
ceived from cranks.

ATT1TU1>Â£ OF MERCHANTS.
Association Defines Its' Position ir.
Matter of Strike. -
The Merchants' Association -addressed
the following communication to Its mem
bers yesterday, defining the attitude of
that body relative to the strike:
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 2, 190Lâ To the
Members of the Merchants' Association â Gen
tlemen: In view of the disorganized condition
of trade affaire in the city at the present time
the board of directors submits the following
statement of Its attitude upon the question:
During the seven years' existence of the
Merchants' Association the scope and utility
of its work have been clearly develoced and
defined. It was organized chiefly to aid in the
line of municipal advancement and reform. It
was Intended to occupy a field entirely Its
own, and It has ever sought to avoid taking
up any work which was covered by any other
organization, or to do anything: which could
possibly serve to weaken its power in its own
peculiar field.
As a. consequence your board of director* has
conscientiously refrained from taking any ac
tive part In the present industrial complica
tions. They are nrmly convinced that this
policy was well advised. With a nfembershlp
of nearly thirteen hundred firms, comprising
ail classes of business In the community and
not" unlikely holding opinions on both sides of
the great question before the public, they be
lieved that any action on the part of this as
sociation would only create partisan feeling
and Jeopardize Its future usefulness. : â
Tour board of directors has never failed to
appreciate the solemn duty of all good citizens
to endeavor to preserve and restore industrial
peace and prosperity. They assure you that,
within the province of the constitution of the
association, your board of directors has ex
erted its best wisdom, and its utmost energy
and power to protect the fair name of our city
and they will neglect no opportunity lor use
fulness where their services may seem to be
of value In the bringing about of an early un
derstanding between the factors of this present
unfortunate controversy. Sincerely yours,
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE MER-
terday. Attorney Drum appeared for the
prosecution and Attorney Coffey for the
defendant. The case was continued till
to-morrow to give the defendant time to
plead.
William H. Kless, the non-union teams
ter who was attacked by a number of
strikers at Third and Mission streets Mon
day night while walking- with his wife
and was arrested for discharging fire
arms within the city limits because he
fired off his revolver to protect himself,
appeared before Judge Conlan yesterday.
The Judge after hearing the evidence for
the prosecution dismissed the case.
John T. Carr, a striking teamster, was
held to answer before the Superior Court
by Judge Cabaniss yesterday in 510C0
bonds on a charge of robbery. He was
accused of robbing A. C. Mclntyre of 1SS6
Webster street, Oakland, on Third street
on the night of August 11. I He relieved
Mclntyre of $43. He attempted to prove
an alibi to the effect that ne was at the
teamsters' headquarters at the time, but
failed.
Robert Mann and Thomas Behway, non
union . teamsters, employed by Cutter &
Co., who were arrested Saturday night,
appeared before Judge Cabaniss. yester
day. Mann was charged with carrying a
concealed weapon and Behway with ex
hibiting a deadly weapon in a rude and
threatening manner. They were pulled
on! a Valencia street car by a number of
strikers at Ninth and Market streets and
beaten. The Jud^e dismissed the cases,
and the defendants' emplos^er promised to
obtain permits for them to carry revolv
ers.
Chris Murphy and Phil Walsh, striking
teamsters, charged with false imprison
ment by forcibly detaining- four sailors
from the steam schooner North Fork at
the teamsters' headquarters, demanded a
trial by jury when their cases were called
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday. The
cases were continued until September 14.
The complaining 1 witnesses have gone on
a vessel to Eureka and no complaints are
yet on file.
Attorney H. H. McCloskey has been
making strenuous efforts to get either
Judge Cabaniss or Judge Fritz to issue a
warrant for the arrest of Policeman Ly
cette on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon In connection with the riot at
Folsom and Steuart streets last Thursday
afternoon. Some of the rioters ran fhto
Julius Larsen's saloon, at 249 Steuart
street, and Lycette and other officers
went after them, but Larsen shut the
door in their faces. They forceu the doors

Sergeant Coogan on complaint of P.. H.
O'Donohue. Thomas and a number of
non-union teamsters went to the Cliff
last night, and on the way out on the
cars got into an argument with strike
sympathizers. The special claims that a
park policeman took his revolver from
him, discharged all the cartridges Â¦ and
then returned the weapon to him. After
leaving the car at the Cliff House
Thomas and the teamsters want to Sutro

Union Men Beat Sailor.
Frank Ryan, a sailor from the ship As
tral, â¢ was treated at the Harbor Emer
gency Hospital last night for a lacerated
scalp wound. The injury was Inflicted by
a number of union men who attacked him

Iiodging-House Is Robbed.
Mrs. Kate Edlngton, who runs a lodg
ing-house at 1206 Stockton street, report
ed to Captain of Police Seymour that last
night while she was out visiting burglars
entered her house and stole several hun
dred dollars' worth of property belonging
to her lodgers. Mrs. Edington s stated
that 'there are eighteen rooms in Â¦ the
house and that seven of. them had been
ransacked. , The furniture in the rooms
which the thieves entered was thorough
ly overhauled and every place where any
thing of \ alue could be secreted was
searched. Captain Seymour detailed de
tectives to work on the case.
The officers of the Iron Trades Council
deny that any union machinists -have re
turned to the works. . They aver that the
strikers are standing firmr and that there
will be no developments as far , as they
are concerned until: the iron works people
give up the fight. ;
The. management of the Union Iron
Works was jubilant yesterday over the
return of two machinists who walked out
with the main body of strikers - in May
last. The machinists, with two union
molders, formed a part of a force of
thirty-two men who went to work in the
shops" yesterday morning.
These are the first striking union ma
chinists to return to work since the strike
began, and the Union Iron Works people
are confident their example will soon be
followed by others. . The situation is re
garded by the Scotts as being very hope
ful, and they express the belief that Im
portant developments among the striking
machinists may be looked for within the
next 'few days. ' .- v '
Machinists Return to Work.
The crew o" the Haddon Hall, which
has been tied up here for three weeks,
commenced discharging that vessel yes
terday. Work was also commenced on the
Belgian King, at Lombard-street wharf.
The grain with which she is laden is be
ing discharged into the Santa Cruz. The
Corona is discharging at the seawall.
The work of discharging the collier
Pleiades is so far advanced that she will
be able to leave to-day for the north. The
Hongkong Maru, which has been loading
at the Mail dock for the last few days,
will start to-day, as will also the Walla
Walla. The Ventura will be taken to the
refinery wharf to-day, where her load of
sugar will be taken out.
The two days' holiday given, the non
union men employed on the front enabled
them to perform a heavy day's work yes
terday. Several ships were relieved of a
large'portion oi their cargoes and many
vessels had a great quantity of freight
put aboard.
Receiving Cargoes.
Many Vessels Are Discharging and
In reply to Reed, Curtis said that the
Conciliation Committee had done good
work, and while he was not at liberty to
say what 1 had been done he 'had hopes
that the opposing Interests would be
brought together. He resented the charge
that politics had anything to do with the
matter, saying that it was too sacred to
be utilized for political effect.
"If this board has the right to prescribe
Â¦what kind of uniforms a policeman shall
â¢wear," said Tobln, "then it has the power
to specify whether he shall wear his re
volver or club on the outside or Inside of
his uniform." â¢- .;- Â¦Â¦Â¦
"A Conciliation Committee of this
board,*' said Curtis, "is at present en
deavoring to bring about a conference be
tween the employers and the strikers, and
I hope that nothing will be said or done
in this board that will Jeopardize 6uch a
probability."
Reed objected to postponement and gave
the comforting assurance that he did not
think that the Conciliation Committee
would succeed in arranging a settlement
of the strike, as he believed that it was
â¢well known that the appointment of the
committee was based on political consid
erations. He held that the peace and
quiet of the community could only be as
eured by the regular uniforming of po
licemen.
Brandenstein contended that the board
bad no jurisdiction aa to designating what
character of uniforms policemen should
Â¦wear. Curtis pleaded for postponement.
Erandenstein thought that the ordinance
should go back to the Police Committee
in order that the Police Commissioners
might be consulted.
Reed stated that the Chief of Police and
the Police Commission had been sub
penaed to appear before the Police Com
mittee when the ordinance was first con
sidered, but none of them had answered
the summons. Reed held that the charter
gave the Police Commission power to pre
scribe the uniforms to be worn by police
men.
Tobln arsued that the Police Commis
eion could In its discretion prescribe its
own regulations.
"The Police Commission should alone
have the responsibility of Its own acts,
for if the Board of Supervisors dictates
to the commission what it shall -do, then
the board should be held responsible,"
Eald Tobin.
Police TJnif onn Order Discussed.
Fontana moved the indefinite postpone
ment of the resolution, but there was no
second. Â¦
Curtis explained that the Conciliation
Committee had intended to make a report,
but would probably call a special session
of the board some day this week to tell
what it had accomplished.
"Manv members of the Chamber of
Commerce belong to the Employers' As
sociation," said Curtis, "and it would not
be right to say anything that might tend
to widen the breach between the employ
ers and employes."
â¢ When the vote was taken on deferring
consideration Reed was the only one who
voted against it, his fifteen colleagues all
being in favor of postponement. Similar
action was taken on Tobin's substitute
resolution.
Previous to the Brandensteln-Reed epi
eode the ordinance requiring special po
licemen to wear the uniforms worn by
regular officers was deferred one week by
a vote of 13 In favor to 3 against.
Supervisor Curtis Explains.
THE session of the Board of Super
visors was enlivened yesterday by
Brandenstein branding as a delib
erate falsehood tbe statement
made by Reed that the Concilia
tion Committee appointed by the ooard
tor the purpose of attempting to effect a
settlement of the strike was actuated by
political motives.
The btard had a prolonged discussion
cn several resolutions appertaining to the
ftrike situation, and Heed In a Blurring
â¢way bad repeatedly charged that politics
Â¦was the sole consideration of the commit
tee la Its attempt to bring about a set
tlement. Supervisor Curtis took y excep
tion to Heed's remarks during the early
part of the session, out it was left to
Brandenstein to administer a wordy cas
tigation to Reed, whose remarks he char
acterized as Insulting and uncalled for.
When Reed's resolution condemning
George Xewhall as president of the
Chamber of Commerce for stigmatizing
the condition of the city as riotous and ,
for calling on the Mayor to issue a proc
lamation ordering the people to,be peace
ful was taken up its author objected, and
then proceeded to reiterate his charge
that the Conciliation Committee was
making political capital out of its appoint
ment. Brandenstein thereupon rose to his
feet and in a voice filled with passion
said:
Brandenstein Kesents Insult.
"That last remark cf Mr. Reed was
gratuitous and an unwarranted insult to
the members of the committee. It is a
lie to say that the committee is actuated
by political motives, and if it were not a
lie what right has he to add fuel to the
flame by making such an accusation? -The
committee asks for postponement of a
resolution In order that hostilities may
not be Intensified. He says no; that it
has nothing to do with the issue. He
wants us to condemn the Chamber of
Commerce and to administer a slap in
the face to such men as George Newhall.
The time may come when we may do such
a thing, gentlemen, but it is not now.
"When Mr. Reed says t^at political con
siderations alone control the committee
and that it is not fitted for its task, I-re
peat that he lies, and I am prepared to
back up my opinion."
Reed, who remained coldly silent dur
ing Brandenstein' s excoriation, mumbled
the lame defense that he had not said
what had been attributed to him. He
nevertheless again deprecated the en
deavor of the committee to bring about
peace. Reed hedged by stating that the
people were saying that it would be a
great political stroke to effect a settle
ment. He upbraided the Mayor for al
lowing Brandenstein to violate the rules
by injecting personalities In the discus
sion.
SHIPPING IS ACTIVE.
Eppinger said yesterday that it was too
soon as yet to say very much about his
new automatic Â¦ longshoreman. It cost
him a lot of money, he said, and he ex
pected it to do a lot of work in return. I
This latest labor-saving machinery will
not do away with the laborer altogether.
In fact, it will give employment to quite
a number while it is in action, but where
loading ships formerly took days the op
eration under the new arrangement will
only be a matter of hours.' , r . j
George W. McNear said' that while lie
had as yet introduced no new machinery
to expedite the loading of ships at Port
Costa, he as well as others. who are now
compelled to employ large numbers or
laborers was on the lookout for some such
contrivance. "Strikes put a premium on.
inventive genius," he said, "and under
present conditions there is not an em
ployer of labor in America who would not
jump at the opportunity to substitute ma
chinery for manual labor."
THE strike situation following the great labor- demonstration showed little change yesterday. The most, important development was ,.the
filing of suit by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company against tbe Marine Firemen's Union and the Sailors' Union of the Pacific to recov
er ?25,OOO damages for breach of contract entered into in May last. The proceedings of the Board of Supervisors were enlivened during
the discussion of strike measures by Brandenstein, who designated as lies certain statements made by Heed. Electrical labor-saving ma
chinery to take the places of striking stevedores has been installed at Port Costa with, signal success. ; , ; .

Weekly Gall, $1 per YearOne of the leading papers in St. Petersburg is re
ported to have stated recently in a leading editorial:
"When a union of the South American republics has
been definitely realized, with the United States at their
head, they will form so powerful a, combination that
they. will be able to dictate to Europe even on quesr
tions outside their continent." Surely it is even so.
These Russians are great prophets. **./'.
Â¦ . Â¦ , Â¦ rv\ :Â¦ . .
M. Bertillon, the famous French anthropologist,
has compiled the census reports of the nations for the
last fifty years of the nineteenth century, and reports
that during that time Russia gained in round millions
62, Germany 21: Austria 14, Great Britain 14, Italy 8
and France 3. . In the same period the United States
gained 52 millions, but while we have now a popu
lation of but 75,000,000 Russia has 129,000,000. '...'!;Â¦
So marked was the outburst of public sentiment
produced by the case that a petition against further
toleration of dueling : has : been^ drawn â¢ up ; and , an
earnest '.agitation against the practice begun. The-
London Chronicle reports that the petition was head
ed by Prince Lowenstein and 104 leading members of
the best-houses in Germany. Â¦: It is said to present a
strong^array.-of Â¦instances: of . recent occurrence show
ing the unreason and folly of the custom, and is be
ing supported in all .parts : of the empire. . A* '.v?
:.;:>Â¦':' "Â¦Â¦: - ' ' Â¦ ' . ' Â¦ Â¦- â¢'Â¦: Â¦ : Â¦ â¢ "-Â¦'A-/.;;. 1
It thus appears that the higher officers intend to
make dueling compulsory , upon their subordinates.
It is reported that in making the announcement of
the court of honor. the colonel of the regiment in
which' the case occurred said to his officers: "I can
only adviseyot% gentlemen, in all cases to challenge,
at any rate, to a duel with swords."
Some of the instances which have excited the in
dignation of the public afford curious illustrations of
the extent to which medieval barbarism survives in
modern Germany. A young lieutenant who, in the
course of a wrangle' growing out of a drinking bout
where everybody was more or less intoxicated, had
struck a fellow. officer, next day sent him'an apology,
which was accepted in good friendship, and the inci
dent was seemingly closed. The higher officers of
the regiment, however, hearing of the affair, "sum
moned the;officer who accepted the apology to ap
pear before a court of honor composed of the officers
of another regiment, by which body he was convicted
of conduct .unworthy of an officer and a. gentleman
and dismissed from the army.
AMONG the .minor issues of German politics
none is exciting more interest just now than
a movement. started to put an end to dueling.
It appears that of late there have been several ex
treme cases of evil results from the practice among
the officers of the army, and the common-sense as
well as the humanity of the more enlightened Ger
mans has revolted and begun to protest against it in
a way calculated to make the protest effectual even
in the official circles where dueling' is held to be
necessary to the maintenance of~ the honor of a
soldier.
DUELING IN GERMANY.
The genuine universities of Illinois are naturally
much annoyed by the ill repute which the fake degree
institution has brought upon the State. President
Rogers of Northwestern University is quoted as hav
ing said of the fraud: "It has not only. brought dis
grace upon this commonwealth, but has discredited
American degrees in Europe and Asia and, been pub
licly denounced in the British Parliament. It exists
on paper. only and has no standing in any educational
institution in the world. And yet, as the London press
has stated,- it has had" 'the insolence to ' nominate
agents to carry on its scandalous traffic in foreign
countries, and has scattered its degrees over England,
Germany and India for a money compensation !\ A
paper published in Germany has discussed the matter
under the head, 'American. Diploma Swindlers.' , The
board Â«of Oxford University has called public atten
tion to the misdemeanors ,of which the so-called
'Chancellor' of this so-called national university^s
guilty in filling out doctors' diplomas for money." *
A considerable number of person's who purchase
these fake degrees may do so out of a'^ comparatively
' The institution, it appears, has been in the custom
of sending out circulars announcing degrees of nearly
all kinds at fixed figures just as if they were so much
pork. It has been exposed by Chicago papers-, but it
still flourishes and will doubtless continue 'to do so
as long as the State of Illinois permits it to operate
under a charter.
The diplomas, while fraudulent, inasmuch as they
are not conferred by a genuine university, are not
illegal. There exists in Chicago an institution duly
chartered as a university by the State of Illinois,
which for some time past has earned a good living
for those who conduct it by turning out degrees at
cut rates. It gains advantage by the fact that when
announcing itself as a university in Chicago the aver
age citizen supposes it to be the University of Chi
cago.
DISCLOSURES of an extraordinary char
acter have been made in the East concerning
the extent to which fraudulent diplomas are
.sold among people whom ho one would suspect of
being guilty of purchasing a degree to which they
were not entitled. It appears that in New Jersey,
where the investigation has *been carried out with
some thoroughness, there have been found" quite a
number of respectable persons, including several
clergymen, who actually bought and <>aid for degrees
which they must have known were fraudulent and de
ceptive. . â¢ i -

a wife deserts her husband, say eleven
years, and during that period marries an
other man, who has since died, is the
husband at liberty to remarry without
seeking the notoriety of a divorce court?"
The answer is that the fact that a wife
deserted her husband and committed big
amy does not divorce the first husband.
To obtain a legal separation and enable
Â¦him to marry again he must obtain a di

EDITOR San Francisco Call: In
the name of what should be fair
and square, permit me to draw
your attention to the following:
"In your issue of August 20 ap
pears an "Address to' the Farmers" by
the "San Francisco Labor Council,"
which appeals to them to. help support
this strikeâ i. e., to men who will lose
very heavily by the wrong acts of the
strikers. If .the strikers will go to the
country they will there learn that the
farmers are not to be fooled by the false
assertions emanating from their officials.
In another issue there is also an "Appeal
to Country Press." which will not appeal
to them. They know that their friends,
the farmers,, are thinking of their crops
that are being ruined, ripe fruit rotting,
hay and grain lying in the fields waiting
for the rains to destroy them, solely be
cause the strikers will not handle them,
nor, if they can hinder it, allow others to
do so. The farmers are now thinking.
Where will the money come from to pay
the interest on mortgages, store bills and
farm hands? One farmer told me: "I in
tended to send my son and daughter to
the State University, but that is impos
sible." Another told me: "I am in a
: hard fix. I have enough grain, etc., on
hand to pay up all my yearly, debts, but
there it lies and the first rain will ruin
it." Many and many a thousand dollars
are being lost to the farmers and more
will follow. Yet the strikers send their
appeal to the farmers, "Don't come here
to take our places."
And now permit me to show you the
consistency of these men who would rule
or ruin, who say and act it, "What is
yours is mine and what is mine is my
own," as follows:

Iron Works and others are flooding the
country and taking the places of the reg
ular harvesters who depend on this work
for a little extra money. The regular
wages of harvesters on the machines Is
from %2 to $2 50 per day, and the strikers
are offering to, work at $1 50 per day. At
this place thus far 164 men, all strikers
from San Francisco, have agreed to work
picking hops, taking the work from the
women and children ; who flock here by
the hundreds from their outlying ranches
to gain a little money; also from the In
dians from the Round Valley reservation.
They come to the country by the hun
dreds and take away the work of others
and appeal to the farmers not to come -to
the city to take their work. I will add:
At Covelo I met a striker from the Union
Works who there got $3 50 per day, by
his own statement, and Is -working for
$1 25 per day. On the railroad extension
here I learn they need laborers, but refuse
to'eive work to the strikers.
The writer Is one of the sufferers by
this desire on the part of the strikers to
rule and ruin and, unfortunately, is not
alone in seeing the great and lasting in
jury it will be, and, though it must be
conceded that a laboring man must pro
tect himself, yet the same right extends
to others. They are willing to reap all
the benefits they can from the superior
genius and thrift of others, yet they harp
on the rich man growing fat on their la
bor, while the laborer gets his full share
of the profits accruing from capital. They
begrudge the richer men their wealth, yet
in many cases if they had it they would
soon have to labor or starve.
There are plenty here who know me,
farmers and others, who indorse every
word I have written and who at first
were in sympathy with the strikers and
now have none. Yours respectfully,
WM. HENDLEY.

KING OF THE AIRâ Subscriber, City.
It was on "the 5th of March. 1898, that a
man calling himself "the kind of the air"
made an ascent in a balloon from the
Cliff House. He rose about 800 feet and
came down in Sutro Heights by means
of a parachute.
So strongly has public opinion now declared itself,
it is not unlikely the trustees will be unwilling any
longer to bear the odium of it and will replace Dr.
Osborne. That is about the only means they can
take to right the wrong, and the sooner they, do it
the better.
- The issue is one that rightly stirs the hearts of
the people. No charity can be conceived more de
pendent upon genuine sympathy than that which is
carried out in the Home for the Feeble-minded. To
the care of those poor little children Dr. Osborne
has devoted his life and the best of his faculties. He
has made the home a model of its kind and a blessing
to the inmates. Every one who has any knowledge
of the subject knows how faithfully he has served
every need of the children and how he has studied to
make the utmost possible out of every ray of intelli
gence that brightens their darkened lives. Conse
quently, the removal of such a man for no other pur
pose than that of providing a job for an habitual tax
eater naturally arouses sentiments of disgust and in
dignation.
Since the scheme was carried out for political effect,
it will not be surprising if it should have very im
portant effects in that way, but not of the kind the
scheming trustees intended: From trie number, the
frequency and the force of the protests that have been
made against the outrage done, to the children by
putting them under the control of a political job
hunter it is evident that Gage's ambitions have been
more hurt .than helped. The bosses whose favor was
obtained by the concession to their demands for a
place for Lawlor will not be strong enough to offset
the indignation of the people of all parties and of all
sections of the State. In fact, the more the affair is
studied the more gross the outrage appears and the
less excuse can there be found for the men who per
petrated it
Governor Gage as a candidate for re-election no
doubt thought the removal pf Dr. Osborne and the
appointment of Lawlor would strengthen his hold
upon the bosses and thereby increase his chances of
a renomination. Consequently, the pliant trustees of
the asyium did the work for him. The man who has
administered the affairs of the school for fifteen years
with success and credit to himself and to the State,
and whose loving care of the afflicted children under
his charge has been manifest throughout all the years
of his service, was set aside to make a place for a
man who, to say the least of it, has never shown any
fitness for that office nor achieved honor in any other
office.
CALIFORNIANS are as a rule so indifferent
to the aggressions of political bosses and so
careless of most of the jobbery that goes on
around them that there is a striking significance in
the earnestness with which public opinion has ex
pressed itself in condemnation of the removal of Dr.
Osborne from the management of the Home for
Feeble-minded Children in order to make a place for
a persistent office-seeker. Here at least is an offense
concerning which the people are not indifferent, and
the political jobbers have doubtless learned already
that the3* made a mistake when they counted the home
of these helpless children into a part of the spoils of
politics.

The final consequences will fall upon the strikers
themselves and their helpless families. Destruction of a
year's production means a largely decreased demand
for what labor does and produces in the city, and
that means less labor to do and more idle men. The
destructive consequences of war have been visited
upon California by strikers who had no complaint
about wages or hours, and who will, in the finale,
suffer the consequences of their blind obedience to
bad advice.
Let it be recorded as a fact that San Francisco is
losing prestige and position as "the business capital of
California. When the prosperity of a whole State de
pends so much upon one city and that city is unable
to protect the rights of person and property, and the
State suffers as acutely as in this case, men will turn
to some other channel, if there be one, through which
to send their commerce to a waiting market. By the
experience of past seasons it is certain that rain is
less than three weeks off, and that will permanently
fix the gloom and ruin upon the country by destroy
ing. the crop that is exposed and devoted to ruin by
a useless strike and cowardly lawlessness, counseled,
encouraged- and advised by the Examiner and the
labor leaders.
We by no means say that a" majority of the strikers
are of the cowardly and inhuman class who dodge
the police and cruelly beat undefended men whom
thcy^usually outnumber ten to one.
Another feature in the situation is the invasion of
the country field by hundreds of these men who struck
with no grievance and now drive out the country
labor by taking a lower wage. Naturally, the dis
placed country labor comes to the city to take the
places deserted by the strikers who have displaced it.
There is plenty of work at good wages here. But
when a country boy who has been displaced by a
striker comes here to take that striker's place he is
met by "pickets," knocked down, beaten inhumanly
into insensibility and too often robbed of his money
by "sympathizers." Lawlessness, and that alone, pre
vents the industries and commerce of the State, from
moving profitably in their normal channel. It is use
less for the press or "the orators of the day" to keep
repeating strained compliments upon the "good or
der," "the law-abiding disposition" that has been
shown during the strike, for it is not true, and the
farmers and business men of the country are begin
ning to understand that their distress and ruin arc
being wrought by mob and riot and murderous as
sault upon honest American laborers in this city.* The
Labor day procession was not a sample of the strik
ing element, for seven-tenths of its members were
peaceable non-strikers. The disorderly element is
better organized than the police, and has a complete
system of signals and a system of intimidation. In this
they have been daily encouraged by the Examiner,
which has become a sinister and dangerous agent in
the ruin, of the State by lawlessness and disorder.
WE publish to-day a letter from a well-known
citizen, a country producer, who, with thou
, sands of others, is facing great loss by reason
of the clutch of the strikers on the throat of the com
munity. We have no doubt that if hours and wages
were involved in the strike .the farmers would take
their share of the ruin with more patience. But there
is no such question. By paralyzing the, commercial
movement of San Francisco, Oakland and. Port Costa
the strikers have carried ruin throughout the State.
The season's product of perishable^property is much
pf-it destroyed now and the rest Is exposed to de
struction, with no prospect of rescue. It is difficult
for a farmer who is the helpless victim .of the desire
of leaders to show their authority to be at all patient
or take his losses with philosophy. The strikers who
left that part of the work which affects country pro
duce and commerce had no grievance against their
employers. : <. They we,re v getting union hours and
wages, but blindly obeyed the autocratic order of
their leaders to strike.

COLLEGE MEN AS LABORERS.
The Berkeley boys who went willingly to stevedor
ing arc types of a class of American youth that we
cannot afford to deny the right to labor nor to de
grade by permitting ihem to be called scabs.
It will not do for this country to depend entirely
upon imported labor, skilled and unskilled, to be sup
plied by immigration, and then given the power, by
organization, to deny to American boys the right to
labor at alL Nearly half of the American born boys
who are going through the colleges and universities
are sprung from the loins of the plain people and
have to support themselves while getting an educa
tion. This is a normal and wholesome condition.
They are to be better men for that experience, and
better Americans, and no organization should have
the power to deny to them that right. It will not do
to permit our native youth to be outlawed and ex
cluded from the right to labor in the land they were
born in. Every year, by increase in demand and by
death and superannuation, there are created about
750,000 vacancies in the ranks of American labor of
all classes. It is not good for the nation to permit
the filling of those vacancies entirely by imported
labor, Chinese or other.
Some very interesting information upon this point
is furnished by the Brooklyn (N. Y.) Rapid Transit
Company. A very large number of college students
in the East are compelled to earn wages during vaca
tion to support them through the next term in school.
The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company has employed
scores of them as conductors, motormen, machinists
and electrical engineers. They have earned good
wages and are well liked by the railroad officials and
traveling public and are found to be scrupulously
honest and thoroughly efficient. Tlje assistant super
intendent of the road said that he would be glad to
secure a hundred more during the vacation, and, in
deed, to keep them at work on the cars and in the
shops all the time, for they make excellent employes,
are courteous, painstaking and efficient and honest in
their dealings. The president, Mr. Greatsinger, who
rose from a common laborer, declared himself greatly
gratified to be able to help so large a number of de
serving and industrious young men to secure a com
plete education by their own exertions. We hope
that this expression bearing on the value and fidelity
of that kind of labor will be added to by its employers
in other fields.
Behind it all, and deeper than the issue raised
against them, is the philosophy of the situation. Are
such youths good workmen? .They have prepared for
a higher education and ha^ve received its initial im
pulse. Their minds are beginning to respond to exact
and symmetrical training. What has been the effect
upon their capacity for self-support by manual labor?
The right of a university man to do common labor
has been assailed with some bitterness and has been
affirmed by President Wheeler of the university, who.
makes the interesting statement that a large percent
age of the students in the State University are work
ing their way to an education, being compelled to
support themselves. The young men who took up
the work of unloading and loading ships that had
been abandoned by strikers seemed to show com
mendable industry and did not flinch at the hardest
parts of the service, but fairly earned their wages.
The general objection made to their appearance in
that field of labor is applied to their appearance any
where in self-supporting manual work. They are non
union woikers, and in effect the objection is to any
but union labor anywhere. This raises a serious
question applicable to the case of all young men who.
are ambitious for the highest intellectual training, but
who can obtain it only by working their way through
college. It is doubtful if they would be admitted to,
membership in any labor union, and, therefore, if the
contention of their critics can be made good they
must abandon the hope of getting the education
which they desire.
the present strike.
THERE has been some criticism of the appear

Judge de Haven said there was nothing
in the evidence to show that the steam
drum, when originally placed in the
steamer, was not in all respects safe and
sound. The - explosion was flue to the
weak condition of the drum, a leakage in
one of the girth seams, being observed
some time before. When that discovery
of the leakage was made a careful exam
ination of the drum should have been had
without delay.. The failure of the peti
tioner to make such examination was due
to the negligence of the engineer and oth
ers of Its servants. It was no part r .of
Daly's duty to have made such examina
tion. No damages were awarded to the

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The Venfura also brought up about
fifty steerage passengers, among whom
was the crew of the schooner Helen N.
Kimball, wrecked on Fanning Island
June 23 last. Captain H. J. Hansen of the
wrecked vessel, in speaking of the dis
aster, said: "We left San Francisco May
12 and made a stop at Kahului on our
way to Washington and Fanning Island.
We made a good run and discharged all
our cargo and had nearly a full load of
copra aboard when a heavy swell began
to roll in. Suddenly our anchor chain
parted and before the second anchor that
was let go would hold the schooner was
on the reef. We worked, trying to get
her off, thirty-six hours and then she
began to break up, so we left her. All
hands got into the boat and made for
the shore. When near the beach a big
roller capsized us, but we all scrambled
ashore except the mate, whose leg was
broken. His name is F. Dredlich. He
was left behind at Fanning Island In
charge of George Grelg, who owns the
"We were some time on Fanning Island
and were very knidly treated. Then the
steamer Tsabel of Sydney, N. S. W..
came along and took us to Pago Pago.
We arrived there too late to catch the
Sonoma and had to wait for the Ventura.
The Kimball went to pieces before we
left Fanning Island and nothing was
saved." â '
The Helen N. Kimball was built at
Cuffeys Cove in 1S81 and was 1S2.65 tons
net burden. Her dimensions., 'were 112
feet 5 inches long. 30 feet 8 inches beam
and 9 feet 2 inches deep. She was owned
by the Charles Nelson Company.

THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura, which arrived from
Australasian ports Monday night
too late to pass quarantine, was
released early yesterday morn
ing and taken to her dock. She made the
run from Honolulu in five days fourteen
hours and fifty-one minutes, or one hour
twenty-seven minutes better time than
the Cblna made.
The Ventura brought over as part of
her cargo $2,500,000 in treasure. This is
the balance of trade, which shows that
Uncle Sam has sent goods to that value
to England and her colonies in excess of
what they sent him.
The cabin passengers who came up from
Honolulu on the Ventura were published
in yesterday morning's paper. Those
who came here on her from Sydney, N.
S. W., Auckland,' N. Z., and Pago Pago,
Samoa, were the following:
turn trip to Alaska and will get away
about the end of the week.
He compare,d the complaint of John Le
Blanc in a Jocular manner to those of the
"two tailors of Tooley street," London.
He said that these two fussy tailors filed
complaints with Parliament in which they
stated that they represented the English
people. So Le Blanc claimed to repre
sent the oil producers. "Short said that
Le Blanc complained about the 'spur'
charges," said Norton, "yet as an nctual
fact this man Le Blanc's land is not sit
uated on the spur, and he consequently
has no grievance on that ground. Norton
also said that surely if oil men wanted
to see the present rate from Bakersfield
reduced, they would have shown enough
Interest In the case to be present at the
hearing.
The case will reopen this morning at 10
o'clock. .
Norton continued by saying that in his
experience in the legal profession- he had
never seen less testimony presented by a
plaintiff's attorney than in the oil rate
case. He said that the attorney for the
plaintiff had brought forward no wit
nesses, but had simply spent all his time
cop.tradicting the evidence that the rail
road attorneys had presented.
Attorney Short declared that unless the
Railroad Commissioners at once took
stepa to see that the price of haulins oil
from Bakersfield to this city was reduced
the oil men would be in the poorhouse
and the oil industry would be abandoned.
Attorney Norton spoke for a few min
utes. His first argument was that, had
the case been taken to a court of Justice
instead of to the Railroad Commissioners,
he would have at once demanded that it
be dismissed. His grounds for the re
quest of the dismissal would have been,
so he stated, that the plaintiff would have
to prove that the reduction in tne freight
rate' would be of benefit to him.
Norton Criticizes Short's Methods.
Attorney Short handed in sheet after
sheet of. statistics about the present
rates in vogue by the Southern Pacific.
He claimed that certain industries were
being fostered by the railroad, while the
oil business, as J. C. Stubbs is reported
to have once said, stood "all the traffic
would bear." Â¦
This line of attack appeared to worry
Attorney Herrin a great deal.
"Are you aware of the fact, Mr. Short,
that the line between here and Portland
is not paying?" asked Herrin. "The com
pany lost $300,000 on this branch of the
syst'em last year." '' :
"No, I did not know it," replied Short.
"What do you think we ought to do?"
continued Attorney Herrin. "Close down
the road?"
Line of Attack Worries Herrin.
A few minutes before adjournment T. J.
Norton, solicitor for the Santa. Fe, opened
Ms argument, but as it was late in the
afternoon he will continue at 10 o clock
this morning.
During the day some pleasantries were
exchanged between Attorneys Short and
Herrin, the latter representing the South
ern Pacific. Attorney Short was attempt
ing to show the Railroad Commissioners
that the freight. rate between Portland,
Or., and San Francisco were much less In
comparison than those between Bakers
field and this city.
The attorneys In the oil transportation
rate hearing opened their arguments yes
terday morning before the Railroad Com
missioners in this city. Attorney Frank
Short, who represents John Le Blanc, the
plaintiff in the suit, made the opening
argument. His lino of attack was mostly
based on mathematical facts. He quoted
figures from the moment he arose almost
until he closed late in the afternoon. r>ur
ing the time he had the floor, however,
he found time to criticize General Mana
ger Kruttschnittâ in fact, from his - re
marks, the Railroad Commissioners were
led to infer that Kruttschnitt could- cast
the late C. P. Huntington's record into the
shade at making evasive answers.
A resolution -was adopted authorizing
the payment of merchants' demands 'of
1'33. aggregating J75.000, out of the sur
r!us fund. The bills of the Pacific Tele
phone Company for that year, amounting'
to $45fO. were ordered held up pending an
iivestigation of their validity.
The Twentieth Century Athletic Club
v.as given a permit for a boxing contest
in November.
The bill defining certain limits within
vhich shoddy mills, carpet beating works
and tanneries may be maintained was
passed to print.
The Joint Judiciary and License Com
mittee was authorized to subpena the
president and secretary of. the various
street railway companies in order to take
testimony on the financial condition of
the roads. The evidence adduced will be
utilized in shaping- the committee's report
on the proposed ordinance, increasing, the
license tax on street cars from $15 to $50
per annum.
License Tax on Street Cars.
The ordinance providing regulations for
the installation of electrical wires, ap
paratus or construction in or on buildings
Â¦was finally passed.
The bill regelating the speed of auto
mobiles and providing: for the storage of
gasoline for the machines was finallj'
passed.
A resolution appropriating: $4500 out of
the urgent necessity fund to extend the
quarters of the Insane Detention Hospital
was adopted.
A resolution was then adopted direct
ing the Board of Works to levy fines on
thf firm if the specifications for street
sprinkling are violated in the future. The
demands for street cleaning during July
by Gray Bros, were ordered paid. Braun
hart's resolution requesting the Charter
Amendment . Committee to submit an
amendment directing the Board of Works
to clean the streets by day's labor in
stead of by contract was referred to the
committee named.
Reed objected to the adoption of the
report on the ground that the Judiciary
Committee had only heard one side of th<5
case. He said a. number of merchants
had complained of the imperfect manner
in which the streets had been cleaned by
Gray Bros. Reed told of loads of sweep
injrs which had been allowed to remain
in the streets for days at a time. Bran
<;ersteln stated that the proposed hearing
l;a<i been sufficiently advertised and that
there was no evidence that the firm had
violated its contract. The committee ad
mitted that during: July the streets were
not properly swept, owing to inexperi
ence, but the specifications .were violated
only In minor details.
Street-Sweeping Trouble.
The resolution declaring the contract of
Gray Bros, for street sweeping at an end
was defeated on the report of the Judi
ciary Committee that the firm had not
violated the eight-hour labor clause in
the charter.
Fourth â Must each proposition to a proposed
bond issue be voted on separately, as: Library
suites. library building, school building, park
extension lands, hospital and sewers?
Fifthâ May the election be held on one day
for all propositions, or must there be several
elections on separate days?
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution requesting the City
Attorney to advise regarding the method
of procedure to acqufre sites for the new
public library donated by Andrew Car
regie in case it is decided not to use sites
now possessed by the city. The questions
on which the board seeks information fol
low:
Firrtâ If money Is provided In the tax levy
for a Eite to cost more than $50,000 what are
the proceedings necessary to be followedT
What. In case the money is to be provided by
a bond issue? Must the eite be described in
the ordinance, and in what detail? .
Second-If several sites for branch libraries
in different parts of the city are to be acquired
Pt en aggregate cost of more than $50,000, out
at the tax levy, if it necessary to have a vote
by the people on the question?
Thirdâ Can the city condemn the leasehold of
the Lincoln School lots?

KILL THE DANDRUFF GERM
Cr Your Hair Will Fall Out Till You
Become Bald. -
Modern science has discovered . that
dandruff 13 caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp In scales, as it burrows down
to the roots of the hair, where It destroys
the hair's vitality, causing (ailing: hair,
and, ultimately, baldness. After Professor
Unna of Hamburg, Germany, discovered
the dandruff germ, all efforts to find a

NEW" YORK, Sept. 3.â The reason for the
sudden reversal of speculative opinion in to-day's
stock market, so far as events of the day threw
any light upon it, was rather obscure. The bear
party, which was obviously intimidated on last
Friday by the good support offered to stocks
by inside Interests and disappointed at the
failure of the money market to stiffen on the
eve of the triple holiday, were apparently will
ing to take chances on the short side that they
were afraid to venture upon for the interval
during which no market would be available for
them to close contracts in. Their renewed
vigor In selling stocks thus represented a re
newal of the bear campaign based upon the
closer tendency of the money market which was
interrupted by the holiday. The actual condi
tion in the money market- conformed pretty
closely to what was expected on Friday, and
which the Saturday bank 'statement served to
confirm by anticipation,, but the sterling ex
change market promptly responded to the closer
condition in the local money market in a way
to indicate the operation of rorces at work for
the relief of the market by drawing gold from
abroad. In tidditlon there was the " announce
ment of {750,000 in Australian ' gold at San
Francisco, available for telegraphic transfer to
New York and the expected receipt later in the
month of $1,230,000 to the same destination. In
the prevailing sentiment of Friday the mark
ing up of the money rate which occurred to-day
would have been Ignored, if offset by these
counter-effects. The, ruling rate for call loans
to-day was 3V4 per cent. None were made below
3 per cent and the rate ran up at one time to 4
per cent. Money was reported In abundant
supply in London and the downward course of
interest there was not affected by the drop in
New York exchange. In fact, conditions were
more cheerful in London this morning and the
prospect of being called on for gold by New
York Is viewed with - equanimity. London's
higher range for â¢ Americans had the effect of
opening this market . higher, but the opening
prices proved to be the highest. The action' of
the foreign exchanges has been so anomalous
of late that some distrust is felt of the present
weakness as Index of - coming gold imports
Large loans are known to be making of foreign
capital here, which involve the selling of long
exchange, to be covered by purchase of sight
exchange when the loans mature. Jt is known
that arrangements have also been making in
the Paris exchange market for meeting future
requirements for the purchase of American
wheat. The recent heavy export movement of
wheat from here is to some extent artificial
being stimulated by demoralization of ocean
freight rates, caused by Jhe extremely scanty
demand for room to export merchandise. These
factors all have a bearing upon the future of
the foreign exchange market, promising some
support at the period when exchange is gener
ally the weakest. When traders perceived large
felling to-day by brokers generally acting for
interests which have consistently supported the
marktt through all recent signs of weakness

COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.^
The weather has been too cool for rapid fruit
drying, but favorable for hops, corn and po
tatoes. Grain thrashing Is progresrfig rapidly
in the central and southern counties, where
Tieavy crops have been harvested; In some of
the northern counties the . yield of wheat and
barley is light and thrashing is completed.
Shipments cf grain and ether produce continue
light, cwinr: to labor troubles. In San Benito
County there are still large quantities of un
thrashed grain and unbaled hay not under
cover, and work is being rushed as rapidly as
pcsElbls. Hops and sugar beets are doing well.
Hop picking is progressing in some sections
There will fce a heavy crop of beans In Sail

excellent in quality and the yield very good.
V.'Jne ar.il raisin grapes are in good condition

tome sections will be nearly average. Late
deciduous fruits are ripening rapidly. Citrus
fruits and walnuts continue thrifty.
Grain harvest is completed except in a few
Bcattercd localities and thrashing is progress-
Ing as rapicly as possible. Shipments of grain,
hay and other produce are still very light,
owing to the labor troubles. There Is some
danger that the immense crops of hay and
grain in San Benito County and other places
may be damaged should early rains occur, as
It is impossible to secure thrashers and balers
to handle the crops. Sugar beets, hops and
beans are being harvested and the crops are
turning pot very well. Corn and vegetables
are tu good condition. A heavy crop of sweet
potatoes is being gathered in the San Joaquin

CHICAGO, Sept. 8.â Wheat was steady early
with corn, selling off later . In sympathy with
weakness in coarse grains."" News of the day
was generally favorable to holders, but the
trading was light. The fact that the amount
afloat is decreasing in the face of heavy world's
shipments was considered a bull argument, but
this was partially offset, however, by the in
crease In home stocks. : The visible supply
statement was also â¢ a disappointment to hold
ers, s showing over one and three-quarters of a
million increase,- instead of decrease, as antici
pated. December opened at 71%<8>71%c. but de
clined with-corn, the low point being reached at
71c. The close was %c lower at 71@71%c.
There were fluctuations in corn of over a cent,
but the market was dull and lacked any special
Interest. Â¦ Higher' cables caused a strong open
ing, but later on reports of improvement in the
condition of the crop there was selling and
prices declined. Trading was confined mostly
to locals. December closed %c lower at 56%@
56%c.
Oats opened steady, with prices a shade firmer
In sympathy with corn. Later prices had a
downward tendency along with other grains.
Aside from a little changing, floor traders did
the bulk of the business. December closed' %o
lower at 35c.
Provisions opened steady and prices were a
shade easier on lower prices for hogs, f The
market lacked any particular features. January
closed a shade lower, lard a shade lower and
ribs unchanged.
The leading futures ranged , as follows : i
Bran and Middlings are again quoted firm.
Receipts of Hay are not heavy at the moment,
and prices accordingly keep up, though the feel

NEW YORK, Sept., 3.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market had a firm "opening to
day, but the cheerful feeling was short-lived,
a- â¢ general heaviness following the early
strength.
Paris came as a seller on an unlikely story
to the effect that France, as a result of the
quarrel with the Sultan, was preparing â¢ a
naval demonstration against Constantinople and
that Turkey was busy arming. American
stocks early in the day hesitated nervously
awaiting New York's attitude after the triple
holiday. When New York sold there was ai
general -drop of from.X to 4% points. The
decline was on sales owing to the extremely
narrow market. The . close was pretty close
to the bottom prices for the day. Money
rates ruled easy.

Ernest Moore Chadwick, or Sir Harry
Westwood Cooper, as he is sometimes
known, will in all likelihood escape pun
ishment for forging the telegram that led
pretty Norine Schneider to marry him.
Chadwick was tried on June 13 before
Judge, Cook and the jury disagreed.
Before Judge Lawlor last evening his
attorney moved to dismiss the charge,
claiming that such a proceeding was in
order as he had not been retried within
sixty davs. The attorney. referred to a
recent decision of the Supreme Court in
the Bergerot case, in which the court sup
posted this contention. ;
Judge Lawlor took the matter under ad
visement until Thursday afternoon at 4
o'clock. The trial is set for September 16.
While the first trial was in - progress
Judge Cook ordered Chadwick into cus
tody until the Grand Jury could meet'and
indict him for perjury. His attorney Is
now trying to have that indictment
quashed, and with that end in view, has
asked to have the grand jurors examined
in court. Last evening the assistant sec
retary of that body was examined Â¦ and
Chadwick's attorney was satisfied al
though nothing Of material interest was
developed. . â¢ â¢ -. ' Â¦ u

the indictment , under advisement.

In the tenth round both men were Â¦ ip
bad shape. De Coursey taking the count
for the second time, but Herrera was too
weak to finish him. De Coursey did all
the leaning after the third round, and in
the close fighting had the Mexican at his
mercy. The body punches made the
Bakersfield lad cautious, and toward the
end of the fight he was hard put to last
the limit . â¢; : : ,.
Harry Stewart refereed â¢ the fight, and
his decision gave -. general satisfaction.
Much Bakersfleld money went begging at
odds of 100 to 70 on Herrera, and consid
erable was covered at those figures. The
preliminary between "Kid" Solomon and
Clyde Burnham was called. a draw.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 3.â After twenty
rounds, marked by some fast and furious
fighting, Eily de Coursey of Los Angeles
was given the decision over Aurello Her
rera of Bakersfield to-night at Hazard's
Pavilion. Herrera was a distinct disap
pointment, and showed none of the^qual
lties that at one time i classed him as a
man worthy to meet McGovern. The only
time he seemed to have a chance to win
â¢was in the third round, when he sent his
opponent to the floor twice, De Coursey
taking the full, count the last time. Be
fore the round closed the men got into a
fierce mix-up and Herrera became groggy,
and was saved from going out only by the
bell. ; ' . v.i :'

Congressman Barney was trying 1 a case
In court at the time. He was overcome
by the shock and the court adjourned.
The women were driving across the
track end the train struck them. For
over two hours the remains lay at the
station at Port Washington, no one be
ing able to identify them. After many
had viewed the remains W. H. Ramsey
Jr. was asked to see if he could recog
nize the bodies.
Ramsey picked lip the covering upon the
body of Mrs. Barney,- but the remains
wtre so terribly mangled that he could
not make out the features. He then

MILWAUKEE, Sept. 3.â Mrs. S. S. Bar
ney of West Bend, wife of Congressman
S. S. Barney of the Fifth District, and
Mrs. W. H. Ramsey Sr. of Port Washing
ton, wife of a former State Bank Con
troller, were killed by a. Northwestern
train this afternoon near the Port Wash
ington station. .
HAVANA, Sept. 3.â Official advices from
Manzanlllo say that the Judge who is in
vestigating there the murder of Martinde
Castro, the well-known Cuban newspaper
man, who published articles attacking the
rural guard of Manzanlllo. and who is
also inquiring into other murder cases,
has ordered the arrest of a captain and
Sergeant Ramirez of the rural guard.
Captain Grierspn of the United States
army, who sent the dispatch, says he has
complete confidence in Ramirez and be
lieves he should be released, as he is the
only man capable of .catching Mesa. Act
ing Governor General Scott has sent the
adjutant general of the rural guard, Ava
loe, to Manzanlllo to investigate there. â¢ Â«
Another murder which is being investi
gated is that of a man named Castillo,
who was killed early in the year, le was
claimed at the time that he was killed by
the rural guards. Castilla was editor of
the Tribuna, on which De Castro also
worked. Â¦ ,
The spot selected for- the robbery was
well adapted -for this kind of work as
it is wild and heavily timbered. The con
ductor and several passengers walked
back â¢ to Â¦ Texarkana, a distance of four
mile/. The Sheriff and posse- have been
summoned to go in pursuit of the robbers.
There were five men in the gang.
A suspicious character was .seen to
hoard the head end of the train leaving
Texarkana. â¢ Railroad employes here seem
to .be confident that the . robbery .was
committed by railroad men from the man
ner in which they superintended the cut
ting off of. the cars and the handling of
the engine. . . -
The robbers after securing the loot cut
off tho engine from the mail and express
cars, and forcing the engineer to get off
they took the engine in charge of the rob
ber engineer and went south at full
speed. At 1:30 o'clock this morning the
engine had not been found.
Iso passengers were molested. They
were, however, badly frightened and hid
their valuables. The robbers were evi
dently in possession of all'the facts con
cerning Â¦Â¦- this 'particular shipment of
money, together with a schedule of the
train, as their scheme Â¦ was successful In
every respect, : Â¦ . Â¦
The train was flagged by one of the rob
bers, who forced the fireman to g-o back
and cut off the mail and baggage cars,
and returning forced the engineer to give
up the management of his engine. One of
the robbers, who, it appears, is an expert
engineer, ran the engine, mail and ex
press cars about a mile -from the point
â¢where the first stop was made and forced
the , express messenger to open his car.
The robbers then blew open the safe with
dynamite, securing, It is said, a very large
amount of booty. The exact amount is
withheld by the railroad company and the
express people, but it is known that a
very large shipment was made to-night
on this train. .
TEXARKANA, Ark.; Sept 4.-No. 1

residence after he had regained con

Richard English Has Narrow Escape
From Death While Cycling Down
. , Laguna Street.
Richard Knglish plunged hea'dlong from
his bicycle through a window of a Union-
Street car yesterday afternoon, and not
only lives to tell the tale but bears but
two cuts to remind him of his narrow
escape from death.
English- is the young sexton of St.
Brigid's Church and resides in the paro
chial residence on Van Ness avenue. He
started out on his wheel in the afternoon.
Intending to ride to tho- Presidio. He rode
down Laguna street hill at a merry clip,
and Â¦ as an Inbound car stopped on the
crossing he turned to avoid it. A car
was coming from an opposite direction,
and of course English did not see it in
time to avoid an accident.
The result was that he crashed Into it
with such force that he was hurled head
long through one of the windows. Glass
wa3 scattered over several women pas
songrers. who became greatly excited
when they beheld the unconscious and
bleeding English hanging limp and help
less on the window sill. The car was im
mediately brought to a stop and English
carried into a drug store at Laguna and
Union streets. Dr. N. S. Gibersoh, who
was called, dressed a severe cut . English
had sustained on the upper lip and an
other on his knee.

from United States Consul Talbot J. Al
bert, who is stationed at Brunswick, Ger
many, a special report In which he says
that the prospects for winter fruit in the
northeast and west of Germany are "the
wcrst that could be possibly, thought."
Apple?, pears and all seed" fruits have
suffered from the drought and also from
the attacks of insects. The same Is true
of !>eaches, plum? and other stone fruits.
There will, therefore, be a large demand
for fruits for the winter months and early
Fhipmer.t and better packing are desired.
This will be good news to the exporters

PROMINENT SOCIETY COUPLE
WEDDED LAST EVENING IN
OAKLAND. ; ,
Changes Ordered in Postal
Service and Pensions
Granted.
Frank Smith. Isaac Citron and Fred
Stahle. who are on the deputies' eligible
list, were compelled to content themselves
with their original appointment from the
list of clerks, which examination they
also passed. Deputies are paid $125 pr>r
month and clerks $100. and the appoint
ment of the three men named to the
lower positions made possible the selec
tion of deputies lower down on the eligi
ble list.
As another Instance of juggling with
civil service the case of John J. Boyle,
at present a deputy in the Tax Collector'?
office, and the only employe not on the
civil service roll, is causing unfavorable
comment among the deputies who were
forced out of their positions by civil ser
vice eligibles. Boyle failed in the exam
ination for experienced clerks in the tax
office last December. When Scott ap
pointed the civil service clerks last Janu
ary he transferred Boyle to a deputyship.
Thirteen deputies were dismissed on Au
gust 10 and were replaced by civil service
eligibles. The Civil Service -Commission
is aware that Boyle is retained In viola
tion of the civil service rules, but It took
no action.- Scott has the appointment of
two mere deputies, but is blocked by.
Charles Broad, .who has sued to compel
mm to select him (Broad) for one of the
places. Broad .will withdraw his suit cnly
on condition that he be appointed, but
Scott desires him out of the way so that
he may appoint Edward J. Casey and
William T. Howe to the vacancies. Should
Broad be non-suited Boyle will have to re
tire to make way for Casey or Howe.
Boyle's retention is due to Mayor Phe
lan's friendship, though his Honor forced
out the other thirteen deputies not on tha
civil service list.
Juggling "With Civil Service.
But Sheerin is said to have both Phe
lan and Fay behind him, and as he has
been of service to the organization In the
Fortieth Assembly District, he will be
rewarded. Colonel Mendell. president of
the Board of Works, and Mayor Phelan
have had several conferences lately. They
no doubt discussed questions concerning 1
the municipality's welfare, but it is be
lieved that Sheerin's appointment was
taken up incidentally.
During the interim, however, the fine
work necessary for Sheerin's selection,
made possible by the civil service rule of
certifying three names for one position,
has been in operation. Cowden is at pres
ent a clerk employed In the Board of
Works, having been selected from the
civil service eligible list of clerks. He is
in receipt of $100 per month, and has been
given to understand that lie must be sat
isfied to remain where he is in order to
clear the way for the selection of Sheerin,
who is second on the list. In other
words the fact that Cowden holds
one civil service position is made a bar
to his promotion to one higher, although
that plan is the essence of the civil ser
vice system. This, too, notwithstanding
that he is first on the list for field dep
uty and is a licensed civil engineer, which
weli fits him for the position.
Cowden Slakes Way for Sheerin.
When Captain Thomas failed in the re
cent civil service examination for outside
field deputy there were only three con
testants who succeeded in passing the
test. These were J. H. Cowden, with 85.05
per cent; Frank L. Sheerin. 84.25 per cent,
and Benjamin Heath Jr., 77.7 per cent.
After a little persuasion by the Civil
Service Commission the Board of Works
filed a requisition for the certification of
eligibles and the three names mentioned
were submitted. Since then the appoint
ment has been delayed, presumably ow
ing to the absence of Commissioner Man
son, who returned yesterday from his va
cation.
Frank I* Sheerin has been slated by the
Board of Public Works for appointment
to the position of outside field deputy,
made. vacant by the enforced resignation
of Captain Charles E. Thomas. Sheer
in's appointment will be made either to
day or to-morrow, and back of it lies a
tale of how politics sometimes enters
largely into the alleged merit system of
the present municipal administration, and
which shows that Mayor Phelan himnelf
is not averse to taking a hand in ths
game when the selection of his own po
litical favorites is at stake. The position
Is better known 'as Chief of the Bureau
of Streets, and pays a salary of $200 per
month. Â¦

Special Diepatch to The Call.
The ground which the law takes in tho
matter is that when one portion of a* will
is declared invalid the rest is also invalid*
unless there is a line of demarkation
which will permit of the various sections
being separated. The executors claim
that this line exists in the Fair will, and
the heirs hold to the opposite opinion.
The courtroom was crowded with, attor
neys and visitors anxious to hear the ar
guments which will enable the Supremu
Court Justices to determine the final dis
position of the enormous fortune.
Attorney Garret McEnemey opened the
case' for ihe executors. He contended
that the trust clause was valid in the
matter of the personal property. Supreme
Court decisions and statutes by the score
were referred to In order to establish the
claim that James G. Fair's Intentions
were set forth in a legal manner.
Charles S. Wheeler addressed the court
for the heirs. â¢ He maintained that the
personal property and the 'real estate
were so closely connected in the trust
clause that the annulment of the one in
validated the other. The whole trust
scheme, he attempted to show to the
court, was shattered when the one part
fell. There is no dispute as to Fair's in
tentions, but the fight is over the manner
In which he attempted to carry them out.
Considerable more time might have
elapsed before the case was brought to
trial, but both parties to the suit agreed
to hasten matters as much as possible.
All the arguments were not heard yes
terday and the matter will be taken up
again this morning. The case will then
be submitted and a decision may be ex
pected within a few weeks. Litigation
will then be practically at an end. al
though the attorneys for Mrs. Craven are
still attempting to find some avenue by
which they may again enter upon the field
of action.
The amount of money at issue Is esti
mated at more than $8,000,000 and consists
for the most part of various stock hold
ings in this State and in New York. The
Supreme Court had. declared the trust
clause invalid In so far as It pertains' to
the real estate. Judge Troutt came to the
same decision in regard to the personal
property. The Supreme Court is .now
called upon to either affirm or reverse
this decision.
Another chapter in the seemingly end
less litigation over the millions left by
James G. Fair opened in the Supremo
Court yesterday with the attempt on the
part of the executors to secure a reversal
of Superior Judge Troutt's decision which
invalidated the trust clause in regard to
the personal property pertaining to the es
tate.'
Albert K. Happersberger. M. D., In tha
furtherance of his constitutional right to
retain his life and enjoy hl3 liberty, has
filed suit for divorce. His wife, Eupheraia
Happersberger, he charges with having
inflicted upon him more kinds and de
grees of cruelty than were ever dreamed
of by the imperial executioner of the
court of Peking. Dislocated joints, bruised
flesh and mangled emotions he says have
been his fate.
Dr. Happersberger's detailed statement
of his woes and suffering Is worthy of a
place among: the musty records of the
dark days of the inquisition. He says:
Plaintiff and defendant were married In San
Francisco on July 3, 1895. At all times men
tioned in this complaint plaintiff was a prac
ticing physician with offices at 41 Third street.
â¢ During the twelve months last past the de
fendant (Mrs.' Happersberger) has. nearly
every n!ght. at il Third street, applied to the
plaintiff, obscene epithets; has run about the
hallways of the place, shrieking and yelling
and. after plaintiff and defendant had retired
at night, has kept plaintiff awake the sraate?
part of the night by loud and offensive talk.
has threatened to kill plaintiff, has searched
his clothing In search cf money, with the pro
fessed-purpose of purchasing a pistol with
which to kill him. and frequently upon such,
occasions she ha3 struck plaintiff with her
shoes and chairs and other articles of furni
ture.
On one occasion, Happersberger contin
ues, his wife locked him out of his rooms,
compelling him to search elsewhere {or
a place to repose. On another occasion,
he says, she locked him in his rooma, kept
him there for an hour and caused him to
miss Important professional engagements.
Again, about three months ago. Hap
persberger says his wife's screams caused
a crowd to gather in the street and in tho
hallways of the building, and she waa
only subdued after two policemen had
taken a hand in the quarrel. On another
occasion it took three policemen to stop
Mrs. Hapersberger, her husband avers,
and then only after she had been threat
ened with arrest.
On May 3 last Happersberger claims hla
wife beat and kicked him black and blue
and finished the assault by Dulling his
night shirt from his back and tearing it
into shreds.
Happersberberger's diary continues:
May 10â Defendant struck and abused plain
tiff. May 13â Defendant struck and abused
plaintiff for an hour and took $5 from hi=Â»
pocket, saying she would buy a pistol Â«n<t
kill plaintiff. May 17â Defendant struck . plain
tiff and acted so boisterously that the polico
were summoned and plaintiff was struck by
defendant with such force and violence as to
dislocate his. left arm. May 24. 23. 2Â«. 27 ana
29. June S. July 2 and 3â Defendant assaulted
plaintiff, pulled his hair, bruised and dislo
cated his body. July 21â Defendant threatened
to beat out plaintiffs brains with an iron cus
pidor.
On many other occasions. Dr. Happers
berger says, he was beaten, - cursed,
kicked, abused and made the target for
various missiles by hl3 wife. His wife
uses stimulants excessively, he says, and
this fact, coupled with an uncontrollable
temper, has made his life a misery.
Judge Seawell will try the case.

d'esprit made over pink taffeta, with
transparent yoke and aleeves. Shirred
ribbons formed a dainty trimming, and
the shower bouquet was of bridesmaid
roses and white tulle.
The bridesmaids, Miss Carrie Nicholson
and Miss Kate Chabot, were gowned alike
in pink French crepe over pink silk. The
gowns were trimmed with white lace, and
the young ladies carried bridesmaid roses
tied with pink tulle.
The bride's Ivory white gown was an ex
quisite creation . of panne satin crepe,
lined with white silk and elaborately
trimmed with Brussels lace and orange
blossoms. The lace yoke was outlined

SENT FRK TO MEN!
A Most Remarkable Remedy Thit
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Paekaea Sent by Mail
to All Who Write.
.Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years again A the mental and
physical suffering of lost manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute free
trial packages to all who write. . It Is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any, form of sexual weakness result-
Ing from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength^ and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the . desired location, giving strength
and development just where It Is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come'
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success In
all -cases. A request to the State Medi-
cal Institute, 32S Elektron building. Fort
Wayne. Ind.. stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages; will be com-
piled with promptly. The Institute Is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free samples will enable them
to see how easy It is to be cured of sex-
ual weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no
restrictions. Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed in a
plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write
without delay.
POSTTJM CEBEAL.
MORE BOXES OF GOLD,
And Many Greenbacks.
To secure additional information direct-
ly from the people, it is proposed to send
little boxes of gold and greenbacks to
persons Â¦who write the most interesting,
detailed, and truthful descriptions of their
evperience on the following topics:
1. How have you been affected by coffee
drinking and by changing from coffee to
Pcrtum?
2. Do you know any one who has been
driven away from Postum because it
came to the table weak and characterless
et.the first trial?
3. Did you set such a person right re-
garding the easy -way to make Postum
clear, black, and with a crisp, rich taste?
4. Have you ever found a better way to
make It than to use four heaping tea-
Fpoonfuls to the pint of water, let stand
on stove until real boiling begins, then
note the clock and allow it to continue
*>aey bollinc full 15 minutes from that
time stirring down occasionally? (A piece
of butter about the size of a navy bean,
placed in the pot, will prevent boiling
over.)
5. Give names and account of those you
know to have been cured or helped In
health by the dismissal of coffee and the
tlal!y use of Postum Food Coffee In its
plsce.
C "Write names and addresses of 20
frirnds whom you believe would be bene-
fited by leaving off coffee. (Tour name
wl!l not be divulged to them.)
Address you letter to the Postum Cereal
Co.. Ltd.. Battle Creek. Mich., .writing
your own name and address clearly.
Be honest and truthful; don't write
poetry or fanciful letters, just plain,
truthful statements.
Decision will be made between October
SO and November 10, 1901, by three judges,
not members of the Postum Cereal Co.,
and a neat little box containing a $10 g-oiu
' piece sent to each of the five best writers,
a box containing a $5 gold piece to each
of the 23 next best writers, a $2 greenback
to each of the 100 next best, and a $1
preenbaclc to each of the 200 next best
writers, making cash prizes distributed to
325 persona.
Almost every one interested in pure
food and drink 13 willing to have their
name and letter appear in the papers, for
such hÂ«?Jn as It may offer to the human
race. However, a request to omit name
v. lil be respected. ...
Every friend of Postum Is urged . to
Â¦write and each letter will be held In high
esteem by the company, as an evidence
of such friendship, while the little boxes
of gold and envelopes of money will reach
many modest writers whose plain and sen-
sible letters contain the facts desired, al-
though the sender may have but small
faith In winning at'the time of writing.
Talk this subject over with pour friends
- and see how many among: you can win
prizes. It is a good, honest competition
und.ln the best kind of a cause. . .THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4j 1901.

SPECIAL NOTICES.THE SAN FRANCISCO. CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1901.
The Supreme Court dismissed the case
of the city cf Oakland against Judge
Hart yesterday. The City Council at
tcaapted to fix water rates and was en
joined from so doing pending a decision
of the court. Appeal was taken, but as
the Council affected has retired from of
fice a. deefsion would have been produc
tive of no important results. .
Water Bate Case Dismissed. '
PROBABLY the largest audience
of .the Central Theater's history
R-athered last night to see the
Tong promised Biblical drama, "A
Voice From the Wilderness," and
to judge by. its reception of the play "A
Voice From the Wilderness" will forever
more remain a first favorite with melo
dramatic audiences. . For it is a melo
drama, pure and simple, with any num
ber of strong situations, mostly conse
quent upon the Interpolated incident of
the passion of Herodias for John the Bap
tist. Its author, .' Edward Eisner, com
! pares his treatment of the story with Sar
i dou's method of handling themes, but he
has out-Sardoued Sardou with a tor
ture scene that takes place before the
audience, when John the Baptist is bound
to the wheel and afterward released with
bleeding hands held to heaven for help!
However, the audience seemed to like it,
C. K. Rosenberg, secretary of the
Hicks-Judd Company stated that the
placed had been closed at 5:30 p. m. He
could not imagine how the fire started.
He dissipated the belief that it was
caused by electric wires by saying that
tbe electric power had been turned off
an hour before the fire was discovered.
He also said there was a stringent rule
against smoking in the building. Mr. Ro
senberg estimated the value of the plant
and stock to be 5150,000. He' said the
company carried $70,0)0 insurance in va
rious companies and that 160 people would
be thrown cut of- employment.
The building is called the Sacramento
block. It is owned by the Regents of tne
University of California. The first floor
Is occupied by the Crane Company, deal
ers in wrought iron pipe, steam fitters'
and plumbers' supplies. It suffered a
slight loss by water. The second, third
and fourth floors were used by the Hicks-
Judd Company. The fire was confined to
the third and fourth stories, but the
6tock en the first floor was ruine.l by
water. Fortunately for the company the
building was divided by a firewall. This
prevented the fire from breaking through
to the adjoining plant, though consid
erable damage was done by water that
poured through the windows. The Pa
cific Ccast Rubber Company at 21 First
street suffered slight damage by water.
During the progress cf the fire seme
unknown men on First street fired a shot
in the direction of the crowds standing
on Market street. Fortunately no one
was hit Officers Sylvester and Mulca
hey saw the flash and rushed toward the
men. but they escaped.
Fire broke out on the top floor of the
Uicks-Judd Company's printing: establish
ment at 73 First street last night, and
before the flames could be- subdued con
siderable damage was done to the plant
and building. Tbe conflagration was dis
covered at 10:33 p. m., but an. alarm was
not turned ! in until nearly ten minutes
later. This delay was costly, as the fire
had a. chance to mate headway and when
the department arrived the . flames bad
wrapped the entire upper portion of the
structure in their embrace. The water
tower was halted in front of the build-
Ing and six lines of hose . were attached
to the fire-fighting 1 machine. The volume
of water that was thrown into the build
ing was tremendous. For fully twenty
five minutes the tower poured an inces
sant stream through the top windows and
tbe secondary battery at the base of tbe
tower sent its volume of water Into the
third story. The force of the water was
so great that bricks were dislodged from
tbe structure and crashed to the sidewalk
below. Tbe tower stream was directed
by Captain Peter Wralty and Lieutenant
J. Belden. Edward Shaughnessey, the
driver, operated the battery.
Besides these streams, hose lines of
various engine companies poured water
Into the building from every side. The
standplpe on the Golden Gate Warehouse,
which adjoins the burned building, was
utilized with good effect. As the top of
this structure was on a level with the
top floor of the building, holes were
punched into the wall and the brave
fire-fighters stood manfully by, pouring
volumes of water on the fire.
Chief Sullivan directed his men. His
presence was felt by them and they
worked with a wilL This was his first
fire sine* hii return from his twenty
eight days of rest. He confined the con
flagration to the upper stories of the
building, and claimed that he could havo
done better if an alarm had been turned
in more quickly.

special counsel to assist the Government
In the prosecution of Dimmlck. Assistant
Attorney General Beck . was expected to
come I he're from Washington, D. C, to
take part in the prosecution, but yester
day .United States District Attorney Mar,
snallB. Woodworth received a telegram
from Washington stating -that Beck was
unable to journey to the coast.
The preliminary examination of â¢ Dim
mlck was resumed yesterday morning be
rore^Commissioner Heacock, Superinten3
ent Leach of the Mint being the first wit
nesscalled. He . was ' cross-examined at
some length , by Dlmmick's I attorney, and
admitted that he had kept certain Mint
accounts In private books, which accounts
should have been public property. Leach
stated that air the Mint funds, were under
the .- exclusive control of. the cashier, .and
that Dimmlck had nothing to - do . with
the handling of moneys. In; all. the cases
of alleged embezzlement, Dimmlck had
made the .proper entries ln the books.
_ Leach said' he could not swear that
DImmick had ever converted to : his own
use any part -of the $498 which formed
the basis of 'â¢ the . charge of , embezzlement.
-Attorney,. Collins tried to trace the fund
to which the , $498 j . belonged, but : only
learned that it came'out of the. "ordinary
funds" of the Mint John' Lewis Andre,
messenger, for the Selby Smelting Com
pany,: was cross-examined by DImmick' 3
counsel. He stated. that all' bills he pre
sented at the Mint were paid by the cash
ier, and never by DImmick as chief clerk.
Cashier ;W. :K.: Cole on cross-examina
tion contradicted the previous witness by
stating that. the sum. of $498. entered .: on
the books as of April 7, 1900, had no place
in i his mind, , except : as far as ' it showed
on> the books. > . .; ; ; : .:
Â¦ Vlt'is jthe onlye transaction," said "Cole,
. "in , which I did not pay the account' my
self to Selby's messenger."
No efforts will .be spared' by the Gov
ernment in the prosecution of Walter N.
DImmick,/ late "chief clerk of the Mint,
who stands charged with \ embezzlement
of. sundry; "sums and who Is also accused
of having" .stolen $30,000 In gold coin from
.the cashier's vault. ' \
Captain of Detectives Seymour took
charge of the explosive,"- and at once
placed several - of his shrewdest men . on
the case. Until a late hour last night
they had made no report that would lead
to the explanation of the â¢ mystery. 1 No
suspicious characters - were found in - the
neighborhood, at the time. Sergeant Shaw
made his discovery, and no clew what
ever has been obtained.. Alongside the
wharf on. which 1 the 'bomb was picked up
lay several schooners, and -whether 1 it
was . intended that these, together with
the wharf, should be blown up. is a mat
ter of conjecture. There - Is I another the
ory â that the explosive; was. hidden under
the. lumber, by criminals, who reserved it
for other purposes. ; â¢
j Shortly after 8 o'clock Sergeant Shaw,
who commands a squad ln that section
of -the .city during the ' striko j troubles,
was .walking along the. lumber, wharves.
His attention was attracted to a sus
picious-looking < . cylindrical \ object that
protruded from underneath . one of; the
piles. Calling two - of his men, he re-'
moved the lumber and - secured the ob
ject. It was at once I sent to the office
of Chief of Police Sullivan, where it was
I found to be a brass shell filled with dy
namite. The . shell was about one . foot
long and five inches in diameter.
The Police Department is busy in an
effort to solve a dynamite mystery. Yes
terday morning a ' shell containing suffi
cient of the deadly explosive to incur a
less of thousands of dollars' worth of
property, was found concealed : beneath a
pile of lumber, at Sixth and- Channel
streets. It was primed and ready for use.
Jean A. Dwyer has temporarily enjoined
the Beard of Education from proceeding
to try her on the charge that "her un
governable temper is a menace to good
order and discipline in the Sherman Pri
mary School." Miss Dwyer filled the po
sition of teacher in the Sherman Primary
until August 28, when she was notified to
appear for, trial upon charges contained
in a communication to the board by Miss
J. M. A. Hurley. v-" '
The communication follows:
SHERMAN PRIMARY SCHOOL,
- Â¦_ Autrust 17. 1901.
To the Honorable Board of Education: I am
informed that Miss J. A. Dwyer has asked to
be reinstated in the Sherman Primary School.
I ' most earnestly ' protest against her re
assignment to any class under my supervision.'
Owlns to her ungovernable temper, I con
sider that her presence in this school would
be a perpetual menace to the harmony and
good discipline now existing.
. Through their children, many of the parents
have become aware of the recent trouble be
tween Miss J. A. Dwyer and Miss O'Brien,
and having knowledge of this matter, it would
undoubtedly impair the confidence and respect
of those parents were Miss Dwyer to be re
assigned to take. charge of their children.
Mies Dwyer" s open display of temper I con
sider has had a baneful Â¦ effect and has been
detrimental to the welfare of the school. I
am, yours respectfully,
' - J. M. A. HURLEY.
Miss Dwyer points in a suit filed yes
terday to restrain the board from trying
her to the fact that a provision of the
charter prohibits the trial of teachers on
charges other than those filed by the
Superintendent of Schools. She also holds
that Miss Hurley's protest is not suffi
cient ground for an investigation by tha
board.
Upon the filing of the suit Judge Dunne
issued a temporary restraining order,
making the same returnable before Judge
Hunt on the 13th lnst.

do in the line of presenting an acceptable

the talk-about Major Hooker and James

icar gossip is that the real dark horse in
the McNab political Tiarn is ex-Supervisor
and ex-Registrar ..William M. Hinton, who
is a~ stalwart Democrat and was the life
long friend of Henry George. There was
a time when Mr. Hinton wasiregarded as

The convention of the Union Labor par
ty will meet and probably organize to
morrow. There will be a fair representa
tion of trades unions, but many of the
.unions have neglected or declined to send
delegates. Politicians believe that a com
plete ticket will be nominated by the con
vention.
Aside from caucusing of district delega
tions there is little activity in the Repub
lican camp. T. P. RIordan and Edmund
Tauzsky. are spoken of as candidates for
chairman of the convention. The latter
is supported by the five Grand Hotelers,
and the former- is backed by an equal
number of the Forty-second District dele
gation. Delegates do not take enough in
terest- in the - chairmanship to express a
preference for candidates. â¢:â¢Â¦_/ -._.:Â¦
In the Municipal Field.
Recently .word". was passed, along the
line that McKinley would not interfere.
As matters now stand the Supreme Court
slate is Beatty for; Chief Justice and
Sweeney and Shaw for Associate Jus
tices. Beatty is on the slate because the
politicians, are convinced that they cannot
defeat his renomination. Sweeney Is on
to help Gage In Northern California, and
Shaw is slated in deference to Republican
sentiment in Los Angeles, but it is ex
pected that his frienCs will help Gage in
the very difficult task of Â¦ securing a
friendly delegation' frcm his own county.
Judge I Angellotti of Marin County is
said to be a candidate for Associate Jus
tice. It is predicted that he. will be sup
ported by many of the delegations repre
senting Northern and Central California.
John F. Ellison, Superior Judge of Te
hama County, is highly indorsed by the
lawyers ! of Northern. California. It is
known also that A; J. Buckles, Superior
Judge of Solano County, is in the contest
again and will probably be able to swing
several delegations from' the north. Indi
cations are that Judge Sweeney will come
to the convention supported by Shasta
County alone. If the candidates for the
judiciary are wise they will not mix up
in the gubernatorial fight. Candidates for
Governor who seem \to be - prominent at
this time may decided to. draw out after
the delegates are chosen. â¢Â¦
The friends of Judge Shaw in Lios An
geles observed with considerable appre
hension the Intimate association of Gage
and Judge McKlnley. The latter bossed
"the programme for the indorsement of the
Kelly-Crimmlns County Committee by
the State organization of the party. In
the south it was readily suspected that a
scheme was hatching to do up Judge
Shaw and give McKinley a place on. the
ticket as a candidate for Associate Jus
tice. Â¦ 'â¢" â¢ - '- Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ , . Â¦ ,
There is a deal of hard work in store
for the political manipulators who have
promised- to bring Gage delegations from
Northern California to the next Republi
can State Convention.' The programme
to create an alliance with certain aspi
rants for. the Supreme Court has been re
vised. ! Judge Eaward Sweeney of .Shasta
County is an out and out candidate for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
and his forces are joining those favorable
to Gage. Judge Sweeney will have his
hands full in taking care of Shasta Coun
, ty for Gage. In â¢ the ; general field t oÂ£
Northern California counties he finds that
Lieutenant Governor Neff has a multitude
of friends and supporters. Neff' s friends
are not going out of their way to help
Gage to a renomlnation. Â¦ In Slsklyou
County E. B. Edson, Railroad Commis
sioner, will get a friendly delegation. In
Placer and El Dorado counties Harold
Power- has a strong following and his
friends are Nell's friends.
i When the plan was adopted by the ad
ministration push to bring the Supreme
Court aspirants into the gubernatorial
contest, it was proposed that C. H. Ga
routte should be supported for Chief Jus
tice. One Associate Justice was allotted
to Northern California and the other to
the southern part of the State. Judge
Sweeney of Shasta was programmed for
the north and Judge Shaw of Los Angeles
for the south/
Garoutte Alarms the Administration.
When the time came for pledging Jus
tice Garotte hard and fast for Gage and
against Flint the Judge declined to pledge
himself. The refusal on the part of Ga
rotte to bind himself and his friends to
Gage caused alarm in administration cir
cles. It was noted, moreover, that public
sentiment- inclined to the' renomlnation of
Chief Justice Beatty. The result of sev
eral administration conferences-was a de
cision to turn down Garoutte. and indorse
Beatty. It is fair to Chief/ Justice Beatty
to say that he was not consulted or â¢ ad
vised in the ' manipulation. The Gage
forces simply deemed it prudent to with
draw all opposition to the renomination of
Chief Justice Beatty. It appears, how
ever, that C. H. Garoutte is still In the
contest for the chief place on the Supreme
bench. - He has served twelve years as
Associate Justice and does not care to ex
tend the term to twenty-four years. He is
a Native Son and is not lacking in politi
cal sagacity or personal popularity. . He is
confident of his ability, to secure the sup
port of many delegates without the help
of an alliance Â¦with other candidates. - -

The removal of . Dr.., ..A. E. -Osborne
from the superlntendency of the Home
for Feeble-minded Children in order to
make a place for Dr. William M. -Lawlor
has created -widespread indignation. The
politicians, two Democrats and one Re
publican, who were recently appointed to
the Board of Trustees, say nothing to
justify or explain their .conduct. Two of
the i trustees who voted for Dr. Osborne's
removal had Just been commissioned â¢when
the recent meeting at . the Grand I Hotel
took place. They had no personal knowl
edge of affairs at the institution when
they voted for the change, as they had
never [ seen the home.' Some excuse may
be â¢ invented Â¦ by the " (governor, and the
trustees to allay â¢ public resentment, but
the fair-minded people of California will
be satisfied with nothing less than the re
instatement of the able and efficient su
perintendent, who was expelled to make
room for a political hade.
