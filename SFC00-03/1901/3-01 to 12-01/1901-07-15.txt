President KuMs Delivers Opening
Speech, of the Bundesfest in
the Pavilion.
President Kuhls, accompanied by his
aids and the vice presidents, mounted the
platform and addressed the people thick
ly packed on the pavilion floor. Follow
ing is his speech in full:
Brother Scbuetzen: It was to have been
my pleasure to welcome to-day the king
of shooters, whose unerring hand has
wielded the royal scepter for the past three
years, but I am sorry to state that Mr.
Hayes is too 111 to attend this ceremony. - I
bid ycu welcome, brave riflemen, . true and
good women and lovely maidens! Welcome,
heroes, defenders of your country, veterans
of tbe German army, and gallant and brave
warrior* of the Army and Navy Union!
"Welcome, all you pilgrims from across tha
continent and from beyond the sea, from
every State and section of this great and
mighty nation, who have assembled here,
upon these distant shores, of the Pacific,
to witness the friendly contests among
America's truest and best j sons. It Is my
proud privilege to bid you all a most cor
dial welcome to-day on behalf of the Na
tional Shooting: Bund of the United State*
and on behalf of all the people of Cali
fornia.
I feel proud. Indeed. In tbÂ» consciousness
that the privilege Is ours to â¢welcome ' you
here- as our guests on this auspicious occa
sion, all of you who have come to contribute
by your presence, by your participation, to
add luster to this splendid . celebration. . It
havoc with the shooter. When he goes
into the range he leaves the outside
world behind him. He is as earnest and
as intent upon his work as any birddog
in the field. When he has blazed away
his allotted cartridges he forgets the
game and the struggle. -and then becomes
ftne of the merry makers to .whom" -the
Bundesfest Is a big and prolonged picnics,
nlc.
Away from the ranges and scattered
aoout the park were thousands whose in
terest was not bound up in the shooting.
For them the dance pavilion and the
open-air concert were of far more mo
ment than the best of scores and shooting
that brings as a reward handsome prizes
in gold and silver. Men and women, old
and young, made the most of the holiday.
The park, dressed in bright colors and
beautifully decorated, was a splendid set
ting for the merriment and the jollity of
a crowd bent on pleasure. The booths
rang with the German songs and toasts
from noon. till long after the sun had set
and the ball of the evening was in full
swing. On every side was the sound of
voices raised in gayety and the enjoy
ment of the hour.
After the long morning march along
the principal streets of the city the
Schuetzen companies embarked on the
ferry boat Oakland. The trip across the
bay was one of band music and song.
Every national German air was treated
Â¦with the greatest fairness. Not one of
them was slighted. Such good spirit pre
vailed that when the Oakland mole was
reached the organized companies left the
boat, still engaged in voicing their patri
otic sentiments in throatal melody. From
the mole to the park the trip was a bit
more subdued in tone. The pangs of hun
ger were beginning to gnaw at stomach
linings, for the march had been a long
and an early one. Silently the Schuetzen
marched from the train to â¢ the pavilion

At the "Ranges.
At thÂ© ranges the noise was of the
popping kind. Men walked about with
stern looks on their faces. They were
there to shoot, to win prizes and to build
The routine was carried out to a dot.
But more than that, the real German
spirit, always found in exuberance on
such occasions, bolstered the regular or
der of business over any possible quag
mire of monotony. Every participant In
the opening of the fest seemed to bubble
over with enthusiasm. On the line of
march, on the boat or at the ranges It was
just the sameâ song, dance or social hilar
ity. The spirit of fraternity ruled.
And there was business transacted, too.
Between times these . ardent, earnest
* Schuetzen fought out their battles at the
ranges. For this some of them crossed a
continent, and with Itching palms they fell
to work in the ehooting ranges soon after
arriving at Shell Mound Park. There the
peppering, incessant fire was a sure
enough Indication that something big In
rifle competition was going on. The very
air sputtered with the sharp explosions of
the guns and the din and ratfy of the fire
ruled In high handed fashion. Now and
then a shout would go up when some skill
ful marksman had accomplished a feat of
arms more than ordinarily effective. It
did not take long for a fine score to Im
press itself upon the crowd. When the
markers swung their flags 200 yards away,
indicating a high figure on the targets, the
ppectators on the elevation back of the
ranges would cheer lustily and long. The
honored shooter, appreciative of the ap
plause, would then do the proper thing,
and with moistened throat and a toast or
two on his lips, would return to the ranges
once more, fortified In heart and spirit
and seemingly better equipped for more
earnest effort.

SUCCESSFUL BEGINNING
OF THE BUNDES FESTIVAL
Opening Scenes at Shell Mound Park
During the First Day's Shooting of
the National Organization of Riflemen
â¢^* yINB o'clock was the appointed
n^ T hour for the grand parade of the
I National Schuetzen Bund yester-
J .^j day morning,- and without the
Â¦A. *; -waste of a moment's time Grand
Marshal Wieneke swung his pro
ce,?flon of;: schuetzen -companies
at the -corner, of Market land -New Mont
gomery streets. There was no confusion
or undue excitement. The plans had been
carefully laid and all arrangements per
fected in advance, so when the signal lor
the start was given the procession moved
as if It were a well regulated machine.
Up Market street the silken sashed and
gayly capped societies of .' shooters
marched to the stirring music of many
bands. In numbers and appearance It was
a procession that compared favorably
with . the best civilian parades ever seen
in this city. All along the line of march
the crowds edged the sidewalks, and ap
plauded from time to . time as society
after society passed In review. Every lo
cal German club, uniformed or In civilian
dress, distinguished by sash or headgear,
made -a part of 'the procession. Then there
were the Eastern organizations, all head
ed with well ordered local bands.
Not much attempt was made at the
spectacular. There 'was a strong, striking
simplicity about this procession, and some
very interesting and noteworthy features.'
It was dignified, without the presence of
absurdities in the way of floats or sym
bolic displays.
Along Market Street.
â¢ Proceeding at a steady pace up Market
street, the parade countermarched around
the Lick monument and then down Mar
ket to Kearny street. Then, moving 1 north
ward the next turn was made down Cali
fornia street to Montgomery. - Reaching
Market street on this turn the procession
arrived at the ferry In ample time for the'
11:15 boat for Shell Mound. -.
â¢ In all the' parade nothing attracted more
attention than the mounted men of the
Hannoveraner Vereln. A white â¢. horse
rampant adorned the coat-of-arms of the
Kingdom of Hannover, and this fact gave
significance to the mounts of this, verein,
their horses all white, though not exactly,
rampant. In fact, they were mostly very
fat and sleek and seldom has so comfort
able a looking organization taken part to
a San Francisco, parade" as these* portly
men of Hannover and - their well-fed
horses.
The Schwaben Vereln tent more bright
ness of color to. the parade and- to. the
multitude in Shell Mound Park than did
any other organization.* This society had
its men and a number of girls attired In
the old costume of ? Wurtemberg, . and
nothing in the day's celebration lent so
much of olden time and old country gala
day appearance as did the \ drea? of . the
Schwabians.
Court Hubertus, the German lodge of
the Order of Foresters, was gay In for
esters' hats with a green band bearing
quarters in tents arranged about the cir
cular track where athletic games are 'held
on other occasions. In the center of this
.circular field. Is the "Gaben Tempel,"
where the prlaes offered are exhibited.
This handsome little edifice and; Its pre
cious contents - were the cynosure "_ of all
eyes yesterday.
Among the clubs whose j headquarters
were ' crowded with guests were the San

tractit;: Germania SchuetBen Club, Nord
deutscher Vereln and the Helvetia Schuet
zen- Club of .Sacramento, ThÂ© Nord

scene -.of much merry-making. Many of
theVcraek shots from \ the East* were s en
tertained -there, and " champagne . corks
/were kept a-popping, _^^
While the cIuds were hastening to their #
assigned placÂ«3 of rendezvous, to await
the start of the parade, a ceremony oS
much significance occurred in the court
of the Palace Hotel, A guard of honor
from the San Francisco Schuetzen Vereln
was drawn up, with Captain F, A. Kuhls
in command. Captain Herman Weber of
the Independent New York Schuetzen ad
vanced, holding in his hand the staff of
the flag of the National Schuetzen Bund,
of which his club has been custodian since
the last Bundesfest. Â¦ He surrendered the
banner Into the hands of Captain Kuhls
with an appropriate charge. Captain
Kuhls accepted the trust and placed tha
banner In the hands of a stalwart stand
ard-bearer. By him it was carried at tha
head of the" parade.
Ferris Hartman, M Doc" Leahy, ant! a
numbeT of other choicÂ» spirits marched
In the rear ranks of one of the last divi
sions, and looked as German, almost as
the dachshund that a red-faced, blond-*
mustached man led by a string, or even
as thÂ© Hannover mounted brass band tha*

outside of shooting clubs that participated

carried off the honors on that anniversary
entitles him to be called Schuetzen Kaiser
instead of plain Schuetzen Koenlg.
"Schuetzen Kaiser."
The Schuetzenfest must certainly- be
highly successful from start to finish, for
never did "Schuetzen . Llesel" carry, out
her part as mascot of the festival with
more : spirit and cleverness than Hiss
Catherine Kr leg exhibited. She wore the
, old-German shooting festival costume, re
sembling the Tyrolese costume as to bod-
Ice and skirt. " '". Her hat \ was a Jaunty,
turban-like effect cocked- upon the side
of her head, and. with a' target marked
upon its top. The Schuetzen Llesel car
ried a silver goblet* in one hand, lifting
It on high often in response to the cheers
of the throngs along the line of march.
-A. miniature wine cask with silver hoop.**
was slung by a strap across her shoulder.
The' Schuetzen Llesel 'marched close to
the head of the parade, all the way up
Market' street and back and out Kearcy
.and back on Montgomery street and down
to the ferry, and could have marched miles
further.: On the special boat she was: the
center . of , a . good-natured, bantering
crowd of sharpshooters, and- throughout
the day 'the Schuetzen, Ldesel was an Im
portant feature of the celebration.

the parade was the championship' banner

scored the honor, of making the
first bullseye of the Third Na

than fifteen minutes after the
shooting began when he fired the shot
that hit the bullseye. A great shout
arose, and the proud marksman. was the
recipient of many congratulations. Â¦ ..'. :
Few of the crack shots, East or. West,
participated In ,the shooting yesterday.
These men for the most part preferred to
wait until conditions were better for top
notch shooting.
August Hohman of the Norddeutscher
Vereln was the first to shoot at the
honor target. His score was 65.
j The absence of the shooting king, Wil
liam Hayes of Newark, who was too ill
to participate in the opening exercises,
was a cause of much regret.
Coliamarini and Russo, the opera favor
ites, were at the park arid were toa3ted
wherever they appeared along the ; line
of club and singing section booths. Russo
is disconsolate. His exquisite rifle, with
which it is alleged he made scores of 23,
24 and 24 In three practice .shots at the

shooters have enacted a very important;
and momentous part in the fortunes, and

A comparatively small nation of moun
taineers, noted for their prowess and the
accurate aim of its citizens, has maintained
its independence through -centuries against
the aggressions and onslaughts of. the com

earth, which encircles its mountainous

a people whose homes and boundaries are
guarded by men of steady arm and aim, a
nation that fosters the practic>Â»pf Its de

of home and fireside, of personal and na

Thus flourish the shooting iruilds in
Geimany and In Switzerland, and thus
cherish and perpetuate the brave men of,

the noble pursuit, wherever they have

This thought leads me to a retrospect of
the history of owe beloved adopted coun

riors from the old fatherland. An irresist
ible, passionate yearning after freedom and
equal" rlehts of citizenship drove many of
the bravest and best men from the old
sod across the broad expanse of the ocean
to this land of liberty and of promise.
Unmindful of hardships, dangers or perils
of the sea or land, they came to build new
homes for themselves and for posterity.
In this respect it may be truthfully said
that Germany has eiven America invalu-

of peril and their contempt ! for death â it
is their example we strive to imitate. We

California was well and worthily, if not
largely, represented at the former two fes
tivals held in New York. Our gallant little
band of veteran riflemen and stalwart Call-"
fornia youths who represented their native
State returned crowned with glory and la
den with medals and trophies. Our dele
gates were overwhelmed, with kindness and
"attention while in the East; every home and
heart was open to Califcsrnia's favored sons.
It was only natural that our delegates be
came imbued with an ardent desire to re
ciprocate at their own gates. They soon
started a propaganda to get the third Bun
desfest to California. Eastern shooters
smiled good-naturedly at what they consid
ered an absurd proposition, to induce rifle
men to make the Journey from -one end of
the continent to the other, and expressed .
the gravest doubt over the success of such
an undertaking. The California boys were
undismayed, making converts for their
cause on all sides, persuading their Eastern
brethern that a trip to America's paradise
on the Pacific was the proper caper for
every sharpshooter, and the prizes that Cal
ifornia would offer should alone make It j
worth the while to travel thousands of
miles.
May Nation and Bund Prosper.
Upon yonder shore of the Atlantic the
Bund consists of the clubs and guilds from
Baden, Bavaria, Saxony, Hessia, Prussia,
Hanover, the Rhine lands, Switzerland, the
Tyrol and adjacent countries. On this side

â¢ ' First Bundesfest. - . -
The beneficent .results of the first Bundes
~ fest astonished even its most sanguine ad
vocates and promoters. ' The â¢ participation,
of nearly all the crack shots of Europe .was
- beyond anticipation. .* A new; ambition was
awakened; men practiced assiduously to
"Â¦win honors and trophies of such magnitude
as to tempt the best of them. Each con
secutive Bundesfest was attended with
. greater success than the preceding one. and
i the large, cities of . Germany and Switz
erland put forth their greatest efforts, to se
; ';Â¦ cure "the- Bundesfest. Our German-Ameri
cans who had visited the various festivals
brought the idea back to this country,' and
laid' the foundation for a National Shoot
' ing Bund of the United States. The first
Bundesfest on this side of the Atlantic was
held In New York in 1833, and proved a most j
glorious success. Three years later the Â«ec
ond festival, also held in New York,, was
successful only in a measure, because many
fs of the best marksmen were at the time en
gaged In more serious work â they were
fighting with our army and navy in Cuba
and in the Philippines, where the country
needed their services.
I crave your indulgence in picturing as
briefly as possible the history of shooting
and the origin of the National Bund. Tar
get-shooting, from its early and primitive
stages, has ever been fostered and cher
ished more than elsewhere in Germany and
In Switzerland, and shooting festivals had
their birth with the patriots of those
countries, which have given us and all the
world for centuries past the 'greatest and
noblest patriots and heroes, whose memories
are cherished by the entire human . race.
Those noble, high-minded, brave men have
transplanted the love for the chase and the
art of guarding and protecting homes and
firesides across the Atlantic and to the ex
treme end of the continent,, and it was
perpetuated by their descendants. Gener
ations have come upon the earth and have
vanished since, but the noble practice of
Over the mountains and through valleys,
across mighty streams and from beyond the
sea, many of you have come to glorify this
festival â and to you especially, and
in the name of the National . Fed
eration, I want to offer a most cordial and
fraternal welcome to our feast here
in this enchanting jsarden, Â¦where the
best men of this great nation will vie
with one another to reach the center mark,
here by the Golden Gate of the Pacific. Mine
is the honor, mine the rare good fortune
to ereet you who compose this distinguished
assemblage. This day is dedicated to the
revival of the time-honored custom of the
land of our birth or of our ancestors, made
more glorious by the filial affection which
binds us with stronKer ties to the land of
our choice, Columbia, the land of the free,
the home of the brave.

NEW YORK, July 14.â Fog. tied up the
narbor to-day. The excursion steamboats
on their way to Coney Island had to feel
their way through the mist. . The presence
cf the fog gave rise to startling, reports
that two excursion boats had. gone down
with all on board. When sifted down
these rumors resolved themselves into the
fact that the Email: excursion boat Julia,
plying between Canaxsie and Rockaway,
had gone ashore in Canarsie Bay, bift
was floated again In two hours. No one

Coalition^ of Western
Theater s^Nearing
CHICAGO. July 14.â The Tribune to
morrow will say: With a capitalization j
of between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000 twelve j
of the chief vaudeville theaters between!
Chicago and the Pacific Coast are abbut |
to be merged into a single property. The
principles employed in industrial com
bines are being used to bring about the
unification. Stock in the new 'corporation
will be Issued to the individual theater
proprietors in amounts proportional to the
valuation placed on the respective thea
ters. The largest interests involved in
the coalition are those of the Kohl and
Castle theaters of Chicago and of. thea
ters of the Orpheum circuit of the West.
Tho only vaudeville manager in a city
east of Chicago to be a party to the ar- ;
rangement is M. C. Anderson of Cincin- |
nati, controlling Hueck's Opera-house and
the Walnut-street Theater In. that city. |
The twelve theaters which will tecome
the property of the combine are:
Chicagoâ The Chicago Opera-house, the
Olympic Theater, the Haymarket Theater, |
Hopkins' Theater and, indirectly, the Ma
sonic Temple Roof Theater.
Cincinnatiâ Hueck's Opera-house and
the Walnut-street Theater.
San Franciscoâ The ' Orpheum Theater,
Maurice Meyerteld, proprietor and owner
of the Orpheum Theater Company.
Los Angelesâ The Orpheum Theater,
owned by fhe Orpheum Company.
New Orleansâ The Crescent Theater.
Kansas Cityâ The Orpheum Theater. .' '
Omahaâ The Creighton-Orpheum Thea
ter. â¢
Denial of a vigorous sort was given to
night to a question asking if the union
was one either of offense or defense
against the East.
"The stock company," said Manager J.
J. Murdock of the Masonic Temple Roof
Theater, acting spokesman, "will be
formed on business lines alone. It is not
meant as an instrument for fighting any
one. The question simply is to join a
number of enterprises into a single con
cern. The present managers will remain
undoubtedly, but they will remain as di
rectors of the larger corporatfon instead
of owners of ~the separate theaters.
"The coalition of the Western theaters
will mean a saving of much money in
operating expenses. Salaries, however,
will not be cut, and. I think the combine
will be to the interests of the performers.
It will give them a continuous engage
ment of a number of weeks."

WOODLAND, July 14.â The land owners
pf Reclamation District No. 108 met here
yesterday. Of the 72,000 acres comprising
the district more than 60,000 acres were
represented. Recently an assessment waa
levied, to which many of the small land
owners are bitterly opposed. The big land
owners, such as E. B. Pond, the Fair es
tate and others, generally favor the as
sessment. A committee consisting of E.
B. Pond, L. R. Poundstone, W. R.
Mumma, C. S. Neal and James Baldson
was appointed, with .instructions to make
a report as to the past, the present and
the probable future of the district and to
suggest plans for future reclamation to a
meeting of the land owners which will be
held in this city on the 3d of August. , I
The district comprises some of the most
fertile land in the State, but a great deal
of it . is subject to overflow, and no suc
cessful plan of, reclamation has yet been
devised. There is a great divergence of
views among the land owners. , The small
holders defiantly announce themselves aa
opposed to all, reclamation schemes that
have been or are likely" to be proposed,
and . annourioe their intention to fight tho
assessment -. to the bitter â¢ end. Most â¢ of
them, claim, that . their land is high and
dry and that they are included in the dis

tion is likely to be expensive and long

TACOMA. July 14.â Fourteen arrests
have been made at Singapore In connec
tion with the recent robbery of the Hong
kong and Shanghai Bank of notes
amounting to nearly $300,000. A small por
tion of the money was recovered. Tho
prisoners are bank . clerks and money
changers and include two women. The
robbery was effected by means of a dupli
cate key to the bank's strong vault, the
key having , been stolen from the Char
tered Bank of India, which used the same
vault. The principal thief escaped to
Madras with ?250,000.
Statistics show that 21,000 foreign tour
ists visited Japan last year, spending
about 20,000,000 yen. The tourist business
is now regarded as an important source
of revenue, and efforts are being made to
more thoroughly advertise Japan in Amer
ica and Europe.
Many protests are being made because
the Russian authorities at Port Arthur
are opening all letters to and from the
American and European residents there.
Nothing is permitted to be sent out that
contains any allusion to Russian military
affairs or criticism of- Russian methods.
Yokohama papers publish a story to the
effect that an American subject two
months ago posted a letter to relatives
in the United States at the Imperial Rus
sian postoffice at Port Arthur. The letter
was opened and its contents were foun-t
to include details regarding a number of
troops at Port Arthur and the naming: of
the forts. The American was arrested and
Imprisoned for three weeks, being- finally
released on orders from St. Petersburg.
Newspapers of all kinds are absolutely
barred if any copy is found to contain a
criticism of Russia or Russian methods.
The harbor at Port Arthur is watched
every ni^ht with searchlights and tha
strictest vigilance is paid to occasional
visits of foreign men-of-war. .

* LONDON, July 14.â The War Office .has
received the following dispatch from Lord
Kitchener, dated at Pretoria:
"Broadwood's brigade surprised Reitz,
capturing Stein's brother; and others.
Stein himself escaped in his shirt sleeves,
with one other man only. The so-called
'Orange River Government* and papers
were captured."
Lord Kitchener also [ reports that
Scheeper's commando (as announced in
press dispatches â¢ early last week) burned
the public buildings In Murraysburg, Cape
Colony, and some farm houses in the
vicinity. '
According to further advices from Lord
Kitchener, the column under Feather
stone ajid Colonel Dixon has reached Zeer
ust, Western Transvaal. It met with op
position and made some captures. Tho
British casualties were one officer killed
and three* officers and twenty-four men
wounded.
"General" Broadwood." says a dispatch
to the Daily- News from Bloomfontein,
"surprised fleitz due east of Llndley at
dawn last Thursday, July 11. He took
twenty-nine prisoners, including General,
A. P. Clownc and General Wessel, Com
mandant Dwaal. First Cornet Pelt Steyn
(President Steyn's brother), Thomas
Brain, Secretary of Government, and
Roches do Villiers, Secretary of the Coun
cil. Â¦ Steyn himself fled without coat or
boots. General Dewet 13 believed to have
been present."
. Lord Kitchener has advised the Govern
mentâso the Dally News understandsâ
that it is possible to withdraw a large
number of Infantry regiments from South
Africa, amounting virtually to the greater
part of the unmounted army. At the same
time he requests that he be supplied with
more mounted men. The Government Is
considering- this, according- the Dally
News, and probably will be" gutded by
Lord Kitchener's advices.
"It Is also contemplated," says the same
journal, "if the infantry is largely with
drawn, to concentrate the\British troops
along the Natal railway, between Durban
and Pietermaritsburg and - between Jo
hannesburg and Pretoria', thus carrying
gold and. provisions for the troops by a
shorter route than the Cape Town route.
A portion of the line from Cape Town to
Pretoria may be abandoned."

loved by the regiment. . He travels all
over with Company B and is up with the

roaming through the country. Many visit
ed the Napa Insane Asylum, while others
went on drives **o nearby towns and
places of interest. In the evening the
band of the regiment gave a secred con

pavilion which adjoins the camp grounds.
The Mayor of the city will welcome the
regiment and formally turn over the town

CALL HEADQUARTERS. CAMP
POWER. NAPA. July 14.â
Promptly at 6:20 o'clock this
morning the camp was aroused
from slumber by the first call of
reveille, blown by a lusty-lungred bugler
who evidently delighted In awakening his
comrades to another day of activity.
There was a piling: out of tents and with
in a few minutes the company streets
were scenes of bustle/ and life. Those
who were unwilling to turn out were
dragged out by the heels. Ten minutes
later reveille was again sounded and the
cannon would have boomed at the rais
ing of the flag had not some practical
Joker made away with the breech-lock.
Mess call followed Quickly and the cadets
moved over to the open-air dining place
and filled up on substantial food.
The cadets busied themselves for the
next hour preparing for church. The un
fortunate lads who were placed in the
g-uardhouse the night before for coming
In after taps had to sweep streets and
do other menial Â¦work.
At 8:15 the first ceremony of guard
mounting occurred. Andy Gaughran, at
one time drill inspector of the San Fran
cisco Police Department, directed this
pretty ceremony. The new guard was in
spected according to rule and during the
ceremony the band played waltzes and
pplrited marches.
Shortly before 10 o'clock the regiment
formed and marched to St. John's
Church. It was the intention to have the
cadets present sabers at the consecration,
but the small size of the church would
not permit of this stirring scene. The
Rev. Philip CRyan, chaplain of the regi
ment, celebrated the mass. Fred Miholo
vich and Thomas Dunne, members of the
Hospital Corps, acted as acolytes, and
Sampson Manaton beat the drum at the
consecration. Special music was rendered
by the choir, augmented for the occasion
r>v visitors to this city. The following
composed the choir: Soloists. Miss Mil

OFFICIAL PROGRAMME OF THE EPWORTH LEAGUE CONVENTION.
Miss M. E. Vaughn, Miss Clara Walton; Miss
Minnie "Walton and A. L. Walker.
The headquarters of the committee at
the Pavilion was silent as the grave for
the greater part of yesterday. â¢ During the
afternoon the silence was agreeably
broken by Organist Skeele, who spent two
hours in practice on the magnificent Stan
ford organ. Professor Skeele tested the
instrument in every way known to the ex
pert, and at the conclusion of operations
pronounced it perfect.
The demand for seats for the organ con

| SOME HEMBER5 OF THE LOCAL EPWORTH LEAGUE COMMITTEES WHO ARE BUSY PEOPLE AT PRESENT.
THE thousands of Epworth League
delegates now In the city in ad
vance of the main army, which is
due to arrive in the city to-mor
row, observed the Sabbath yester
day In a manner befitting the
tenets of the noble organization
to which they have sworn allegiance, by
attending divine services In the various
local Methodist Episcopal churches. It
Â¦was a day of recreation for the hard
worked members of the various sub-com
mittees, and with a few exceptions the
assistants of the general committee rested
from their labors to gather strength for
the arduous trials which will confront
them from now until the close of the con
vention.
Two trains arrived from the East yes
terday, one Just before noon and the
other last evening. Both were crowded
Â¦with Leaguers, and all were greeted by
the Berkeley section of the Oakland re
ception committee at Sixteenth street and
escorted to this city. It is estimated that
nearly 200 Leaguers were in the party to
arrive yesterday. Owing to the fact that
the members of the entertainment com
mittee were not on duty, the visitors were
directed to the various hotels, where they
Trill remain until other provisions
their comfort or convenience can be ar
ranged for.
As foretold by The Call yesterday, the
arrivals were very light. The report was
current that a dozen trains were to ar
rive, and the result was that hundreds
of people gathered at the ferry in ex
pectation of meeting friends. The failure
of the latter to materialize proved a tore
disappointment to many.

J| them the Southern Pacific Cora
â¢ "^^ pany has moved Its river steam
ers and freight ferry boats to
Washington-street wharf and the pier for
merly used by those vessels has been
turned into a receiving shed for trafJcg
only. All the small baggage and parcels
are handled in the ferry building nnd
everything is systematized so that th^re
willbe no trouble nor confusion when the
rush comes.
The railroad company Is using two re
lays of baggage handlers. One gang Â«oej
on at 7 a. m. and works to 7 p. m.. wlieii
the njght gang goes on and holds the fort
until breakfast time. The night men nave
a little the best of it, as the last boat gota
in about 12:30 a. m- and after that they
have a comaaratlvely ea3y time of it.
In the trunk shed more than a thousand
packages are/ already piled up awaitlnz
owners. They are segregated In alpha
betical orde^r, but in no one d4yia.ion is
there m.orp than 100 trunks. " \ >
The structure in which, the trunks are
stored is lighted with more t}ian 200 in
candescent lights and at night, when the
men are at work the place is illuminated
like a fairy palace.
Monday and Tuesday nights the bag
gage handlers expect a hot time of it and
all of them are saving up their strength
for the occasion. Â¦ ;
seats will be resumed with limitations to
day, however. Thousands of the Incoming 1
Leaguers have expressed their earnest
desire to attend the concert, and the com
mittee has decided to make suitable provi
sions toward that end.
There w}H be a rehearsal of the chorus
at the Pavilion this evening. Chairman
Husband of the music committee an
nounces that none but the members of the
chorus will be admitted. This may be a
source of inconvenience to the ladies, who
have heretofore attended the rehearsal3
with escorts, but the executive order in
necessary, says- Mr. Husband, In ordaC
that the best results may be attained. Tha
final rehearsal of the chorus takes placs
to-morrow afternoon.
President Will Press Button
it is now definitely known that President
MeKjr-ley will not only press the electric
button by which the great Stanford orgran
will peal forth its silver notes to herald
the opening of the Epworth League con
vention Tuesday evening, but that he wili
send a characteristic greeting to the con
vention, which will be read to the gathered
Leaguers amid the warm applause of
thousands of visitors from all parts of the
United States.
A few days ago Rev. Thomas Filben,
chairman of the general committee, sent
the following telegram to the President:
President William McKinley. 'Washington:
The general committee of tha Epworth League
Convention, 1901. request that you press ths

trains came rolling in frdm the East, un

had arrived. The majority of them I will
remain over until to-morrow, - although
many of them will resume their journey
to-night The visitors spent the day at

GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Col., July 14.â
The thoroughly organized gang of pick
pockets operating at Colorado Springs Is
responsible for a party of about twenty
Epworth Leaguers becoming stranded here.
Men and women alike have been robbed,
not only of every cent they had with them
but of railroad tickets as well, and unless
the railroads will issue tickets back home
on their proof of having purchased and
paid for rides to San Francisco and back
the members of the. party will be com
pelled to ask aid from the county authori
ties.
and Tickets.
"The proof that there is a God cannot
be adduced of the kind that men adduce
of other things. Nature is silent when
asked to explain whence things came,
when they began, how the soul and body
are united in man, why he was made,
whither he goes, if anywhere, when he
dies. The world has long struggled with
these questions. Some say there is no
.God; most people say there are many
gods, and many believe all is God.
"When St. Paul went to Athens he
found idols for every known god, and if
through ignorance the Athenians omitted
any god they set up a tribute to the 'un
known god.' So much as could be known
of him St. Paul undertook to reveal.
"Without the belief of a personal God
there is no adequate restraint in human
passions. The mere belief in the being of
God will not suffice. He must' be felt and
made the rule of life. Man finds. a spring
of consolation In the hope of immortality.
When I preached on Mars Hill the most
impressive thought that came to me was
that St. Paul went there unknown, and
now his doctrines are followed by all the
nations of Europe except Turkey.
"Christians worship an unknown but not
unfelt God. Ho is unknown because the
finite cannot comprehend the Infinite. Su
perstition springs up at the very threshold
of the church. Christian science and the
anti-medicine faith-healing the church is
not ready to accept. Sometimes the min
istry, is too high up for the laity to reach.
The words of Christ are explicit: 'Ye are
the light of the world. Let your light so
shine that they may see your good works
and glorify your father which is in heav

In his sermon, "there was no beginning
and if there was no beginning there is no
God. Evolution is a hypothesis supported
by many recent conditions and processes
but however far back it is followed it
must be thrown away at last, for it denies
the being of a God. Darwin doubted thÂ©
being of a personal God; Professor Agas
siz refused to accept evolution, and Pro
fessor Joseph Le Conte undertook to har
monize it with Christianity. The best that
man can do is to believe and feel there
is a God, -who preceded heaven and earth
and created them.
at Central M. E. Churchl
The Rev. Dr. James M. Buckley, editor
of the New York Christian Advocate,
preached the sermon at the Central Meth
odist Episcopal Church yesterday morn
ing. Dr. Buckley, who Is regarded as one
of the best orators in the Methodist
church, took for his subject the text "To
the Unknown God."
"If there was no God," said Dr. Buckley
The Rev. A. C. Bane, pastor of the Cali
fornia-street Methodist Episcopal Church,
delivered a stirring sermon to his congre
gation last night. He chose as his sub
ject, "If Christ Should Rule the Conven
tion," and his words sank deep into the
hearts of the many Epworth Leaguers
present. '
The church was prettily decorated with
the colors of the Epworth League. A red
and white message of welcome was
stretched across the church in front of
the pulpit, and on the railing which sur
lounded the choir stand beautifully, deco
rated letters formed the word "Califor
nia."
Dr. Bane in his sermon referred to the
great benefit which the presence of so
many wnose every effort tended toward
the spreading of Christianity would prove
to San Francisco. "The greatest gather
ing in all history," said Dr. Bane, "is
about to assemble in. this city. Because
of the possibilities that shall "flow out of
it and the truths that shall be spoken
from the platforms there will come a
great benediction to the people of this glo
rious State.
"The spirit of God shall speak wisdom
to these gathered hosts. The tread of a
new and mighty army shall be heard at
the close of this convention. These young
people will go back into the world pre
pared to spread the truths Into the dark
est of heathen lands, and wlllbe prepared
to remove the doubts existing in the
minds of those who are without faith.
This great convention is going to bring
the church Into closer touch with the sin
ful, sorrowing, suffering world. It Is go
ing to put a great body of young people
out into the world prepared to teach that
a day is not well spent unless some por
tion of it has been spent In communion
with the spirit which will rule the conven
tion.
"It will show to the world 50,000 young
people who are living the life that they
profess."

to Mr. Cortelyou, the President's secre
tary. That gentleman was heard from
yesterday in a brief telegram announcing
that the President would be pleased to
send his greetings to the thousands of
Leaguers now assembling in the city. The
dispatch bore no reference to the request
to press the electrical button at the White
House, and, fearing that the spirit of his
telegram had been misunderstood. Rev.
Mr. Kilben wired again. A definite reply
will doubtless be received this morning.
Rev. Mr. Filben states that the Presi

request. The arrangements for this in

Tuesday evening the line from this city

P'lTTSBURG, July 14.â Ffom pres
ent indications it appears proba
ble that President Schaffer's
strike order, Issued^ last night to
the Amalgamated Association
members in the employ of the American
Steel Hoop Company, the American Steel
Company and the American , Titl> Plate
Company, will be obeyed, and the great
struggle between the Amalgamated Asso
ciation and the steel companies will bs
on in earnest to-morrow. In the united
mills ; of . the three companies against
which a strike has been declared it Is pre
dicted that not a wheel will turn to-mor
row. An effort will be made to close some
of the non-union mills of the city, and
cripple the- rest. The Amalgamated peo
ple are sanguine of success^
i "The -strike was not of our own seek
ing," said President Schaffer to-day; "It
was forced upon us.' We were not con
tending . for wages, but for principleâ for
self-preservation. The tin and sheet peo
ple will not be able to turn a single wheel
to-morrow. We - have â¢ our forces thor
oughly organized and there will be some
surprises in. store.- The strike order will
be promptly obeyed by all our men/'
Pittsburg the Strike Center.
Developments to-day indicate that
Pittsburg is going to be a pretty lively
strike center. The most interest attaches
to the Painter mill, on the south side, and
to that of Lindsay & McCutcheon in Alle
gheny. Both mills are controlled by '.the
American Steel Hoop Company and have
hitherto been aggressively non-union, and
much depends upon the action taken by
the men in those plants. The employes
of both mills held open meetings to-day
and decided to strike to-morrow. These
mills employ 700 men.
However, W. Jenks, manager of the
American â¢ Steel Hoop Company, said to
day that both mills would resume to-mor
row as .usual. The fight at the Painter
mill is to be made the fight of the strike.
Both sides will make stubborn resistance.
If the Amalgamated people can close this
mill they believe they will have. won the
greater part of the striked The mill is
not an important one, but the Steel Hoop
Company has for years succeeded in
thwarting the efforts made to unionize it.
President Schaffer was asked to-day if
he had set a time when, no settlement
having been effected, he would extend the
strike to all the subsidiary steel compa
nies of the United States Steel . Corpora
tion. He said he must decline to make
his plans known at present. It -may t be
said, however, on the strength of reliable
Information, that the strike within its
present limits- is intended merely as a
show of strength.
At the conference last week the repre
sentatives of the steel corporation were
repeatedly - warned that the association
was much stronger than they knew. They
were told of the organization of mills of
which they had no knowledge. But the
steel men would not believe that the asso
ciation was as strong as it was claimed
to be.- ; ;
Preliminary Test of Strength.
Thus, It is believed, the purpose is to
show its strength by confining the strike
to three companies. When . the show of
strength has been made, whatever it may
prove, the association expects the com
panies to ask for another conference. If
the companies show no Inclination to
make a settlement, the strike will be ex
tended to three more companies. If the
trust will not 'yield then, the strike will
be extended to such Independent compa
nies as sell their finished products or raw
materials to companies to which a strike
has been declared. Should the strike at
tain such proportions it would be likely to
go still further. â -Â¦
The Amalgamated Association and the
Federation of Labor two years ago form
ed a secret alliance, It Is claimed, when It
was agreed that the organization when
on.strike could also call out the steel men
of the federation. The latter organiza
tion has organizations In 'many mills
whose workmen are not eligible to mem
bership in the association.
' In the course of a statement late to
night President Shaffer said: _ -_
â¢ "With the 74,000 men affected by the
original order calling out the sheet steel,
steel hoop and tin workers, this last gen
eral order will increase the number to
more than 150.000 and will involve the Fed
eral Steel Company, the. National Steel
Company and the National Tube Com
pany." Â¦- " - r
BOTH SIDES BEQP-ET BBEAK.
President Shaffer Says There Was No
Other Course to Pursue.
PITTSBURG. July 14.â In describing the
conclusion of the conference In. the Hotel
Lincoln on Saturday afternoon, President
Shaffer said that after the final proposition
of the manufacturers had been taken up
and dlscuBsed there was a painful silence
for about five minutes. The workers
.waited for some further remark on the
part of the manufacturers and the latter
appeared to be waiting for a remark from
the -workers. Finally one of the manu
facturers' committee broke the silence by
saying:
"Well, I euess there is no further use
In waiting for other , developments. -The
men. have nothing to- offer and the manu
facturers have gone as far as they can in
justice to themselves." .
President Shatter replied that he ac
corded with this, view. If the manufac
turers had no other proposition to offer it
was useless to remain. Each side arose
to leave. . Â¦ ' .
"Warner Arms, president of the Amer
ican Steel Hoop Company, said to-night:
"I am sorry that our friendly relations
in the past should have to be broken in
this way. We have done all In our power
to meet this trouble in an amicable man
ner With this breach once opened it must
be understood that the onus Is on the side
of the Amalgamated Association and the
public will understand this." c :
While keenly regretting the break in the
peaceful relations between the organiza
tion and the manufacturers, President
Shaffer said that there seemed no other
course to pursue. His offer to the hoop
company to reconstruct the scale for cot
ton tie and hoop . mills was one of the
most Important sacrifices that had ever
been offered by the association. He
doubted if the settlement could have been
made on that basis without a great deal
of trouble, but the committee felt willing
to make this concession to preserve peace.
Willis Li. King, vice chairman of the
board of managers of Jones & Laughlin,
an independent corporation, did not hesi
tate to say, when approached to-day, that
the inability of the conferees to agree was
a most unfortunate condition and meant
an Immense loss, not only to all concerned
but to the country generally.
"A claim for ' increased wages by the
workingmen," he said. "Is a compara
tively easy thing . to arbitrate,- for both
sides will make some concessions, but
where there Is a principle concerned, as
there is In this case, and I take the news
papers as the authority for it, then it
reaches a point where arbirtatlon is Im
possible, and either one side or the other
must acknowledge defeat by surrender
ing." ' Â¦ Â¦ - ' : ' .;â Â¦Â¦
In answer to a auestion Mr. King said:
"Should the fight become very bitter and
be Ion)? 'drawn out I can see no earthlv
hope of the workinemen winnintr. They
could cause much trouble, but I, do not
think they could ever come out victor
ious." .
AWAIT ACTION OF OTHERS.
Employes of the Humbert Plant Will
Not Take Initiative.
CONNELLSVILLB. Pa., July 14.â The
employes of the Humbert plant of the
American Tin Plate Company, at Connells-;
ville are hanging in the',balance to-night.
They are waiting for the other tin plate
mills to take the initiative. The Humbert
mills are non-union.
At Greenville 700 men will be affected
by the strike, and the- majority favor
holding out to the end.- / Â¦
At New Kensington the members of the
Amalgamated Association, employed In
the Pittsburg and Pennsylvania plants. of
the American Tin Plate Company, will
not resume work, to-morrow. > \ The men
declare that they are in better shape to
withstand a long fight than ever before,
and no matter what demands their lead
ers . may make. ;, they; will be approved ; by
the ' workers "Â» here, for they will stand ; as
be introduced. Commencing on the 7th
there will not be a dull moment until after
the close of the 9th. There will be barbe
cues, banquets . and balls, interspersed
with bicycle races, baseball games and all
kinds of athletic sports, and the badge of
a Native Son or Daughter will procure
open sesame to the city's hospitality.
It rs difficult to estimate at this time
the number who will be the guests of San
Jose during the celebration. The San
Francisco and Alameda County parlors
have informed the local committee that it
may expect 10,000 from those, two coun
ties' alone. With those who will come
from districts south and east of San Jose
the local committee will have to arrange
for the entertainment of from twelve to
fifteen thousand guests. The accommoda
tions: committee expects no trouble, as
the hotel service is better than ever and
the niaber of rooms in the residence por
tion 01 the city larger than before. The
only fear that Chairman Koppel and
Messrs. Levy and Amldon of the commit
tee have had is that a sufficient number
of halls would not be available for parlor
headquarters. The committee has listed
and rated enough halls so that no fear
need be felt on this score now.
E>uringr the week a number of parlors
had representatives in the field looking
for headquarters. Among these . were

BRITISH DISCONTENTS.
In the meantime the Government is spending money
right and left. The improvement in guns has rendered
the old naval station at Gibraltar indefensible, and at
Recently the Navy League severely criticized the
manner in which the Government has neglected the
navy, and particularly the naval stations in the,Med
iterranean. .The League asserts there is no break
water at Malta, that Egypt is undefended, that black
powder and blunt-nosed shells are still in use on many
battleships, that a number of ships are armed with
old-fashion guns, and, in fact, that the navy has
been allowed to fall behind the requirements of the
time, and is not a sufficient protection for the empire
against a powerful foe.
DISPATCHES fr"om London are to the effect
that the British are so dissatisfied with the
conduct of affairs at the seat of war in South
Africa that it is probable the Government will recall
Lord Kitchener and deprive him of command while
nominally promoting him. Of course, the degree, of a
popular discontent can be easily exaggerated, and
therefore a report of an intention to remove Kitchener
may be without foundation, but none the less it is
evident the British public has become extremely dis
satisfied with the management of the affairs of the
empire. Moreover, the discontent is not confined to
South African matters. The Ministry is about as un
popular as the general in command of the army, and
if the Liberal party had a leader and a policy Lord
Salisbury might be relieved about as soon' as Lord
Kitchener.

RECENT reports from France give glowing ac
counts of results obtained with a torpedo boat
in Ajaccio harbor, and a little later with a flying
ship at Paris. In each case the operations are"
described as being very nearly all that is required to
prove the success of the inventor in solving all the
difficulties of his problem.
In the test of the torpedo boat several warships in
the 1 harbor were warned that attempts would be made
to attach a torpedo to one or more of them. Signal
stations were established in various parts of the bay
and a sharp lookout was kept. In spite of all vigilance
the torpedo boat was not discovered. She made her
way under water, easily avoiding all obstructions and
making upon the surface no indication of her pres
ence. Thus, without difficulty, she evaded all the
signal stations, gained a position under the bottom of
one of the warships, fixed a torpedo in place and
made her way back to a place of safety. . ;
The reports of the flying ship are equally glowing.
We are told the inventor started with his ship from
St. Cloud, rose about half a mile in the air, proceeded
in any direction he chose, circled around over Paris at
will, and finally, when a slight accident occurred to
the rudder, he 'brought the ship to the ground, re
paired the defect, rose once more in the air and made
his way back to St. Cloud. It is added that during his
whole course he did not make use of a single, ounce
of ballast to preserve the equilibrium of his craft.
Neither of the reports is official. Doubtless when
we get the official statements we shall learn that there
are- defects in the submarine torpedo boat and in the
flying ship. Still it will be noted that, marked progress
has been made toward the accomplishment of each of
these marvels. Scientists and inventors are working
at them in all civilized countries. It was but a little
while ago that it seemed as if Count Zeppelin woufd
win for Germany the credit of producing the first
flying machine, but now it appears that France may
have it. A similar rivalry exists in the efforts every
where being made to produce a successful submarine
boat, and there is no telling in what year or in what
nation the feat will be achieved.' .
TORPEDOES AND FLYING SHIPS.
THE weather was the predominant factor in trade
last week. All over the West, and particularly
the Southwest, the heat was intense, running up
here and there to 105 and even no degrees in the
shade. No rain of any consequence fell in the great
corn belt, which covers the States of Illinois, Missouri,
Kansas, Nebraska and some parts of Iowa and Okla
homa. Every day the sun burned down from a cloud
less sky, parching the already dry soil, and, in the
jargon of the grain trade, "burning up" the crops,
cereal, vegetable and fruit.
The effect of this heated term, the severest in thirty
years, was serious. It cut down the corn and oat
crops and started wild speculation in these two cereals
Cn the different exchanges throughout the West and
East. It very largely caused the slump in railroad
stocks in Wall street by menacing the earnings of the
Western U"unk lines in the coming fall. It kept people
indoors, drove farmers from their fields and towns
people from the streets, and played the mischief with
the retail trade. It damaged the internal trade of the
West to the amount of many millions, particularly in
the Southwest, where numerous cancellations of
orders for merchandise are reported. It burned up the
vegetables and potatoes in Texas and sent that State
to California for cabbages and other garden and field
stuff, which we are now sending down there.
. But while the West and Southwest suffered, other
parts of the country escaped. The Northwest reported
business good, owing to the excellent prospects for
the wheat crop, and the East and South sent the usual
reports for this time of the year. The country's bank
clearings showed a gain of 40 per cent over the same
week last year, and, with the exception of Minneap
olis, which seems to be a chronic laggard of late,
every important city in the country showed an in
crease. The failures were 208, against 196 for the same
week last year.
The great staples show little change. They seldom
do in midsummer. More tone was reported in iron
and steel, though new orders were small. The manu
facturers of agricultural implements, who have been
holding off for an expected decline in material, en
tered the market again for steel bars. Structural ma
terial and builders' hardware were quoted in brisk
demand. The wool market seems to be slowly im
proving, and the demand for the finer grades of raw
wool has been very good of late. The shipments of
boots and shoes, while smaller than during the pre
ceding week, are still large, while hides and. leather
are quoted firm and in good demand. The railway
earnings continue heavy, those in June showing an
increase of 6.8 per cent
Crop conditions, excluding corn and oats, which
have been damaged by the extreme heat, are fine.
According to the Government reports, we will have
about 700,000,000 bushels of wheat, 685,000,000 bushels
of oats and 2,058,000,000 bushels of corn. Hay will be
Â¦ good crop except in the Southwest, but fruit will
cot be heavy anywhere this year.
Conditions in Wall street were disturbed last week.
The damage to the Southwestern crops led to a fear
that the railroads would suffer along in the fall, and
this led to a desire to liquidate. On several days
stocks went down, with a run. hiit after each decline
there was a tendency to recover the lost ground,
which, however, was not regained.
There is nothing new in the local situation. East
ern and Western conditions are not materially affect
ing us, and we are placidly pursuing the even tenor of
our way, after the California fashion. All conditions
seem favorable, and there is nothing in sight to cause
distrust. . .

PERSONAL MENTION.
(The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published below, but presents
them for whatever value they may have as
communications of general interest.
Editor Callâ In your editorial, entitled
"Fact and Fanaticism," In Tuesday's is
sue, you reiterate the oft disproved stories
of the springing up of saloons in the vicin
ity of Fort Sheridan immediately after
the passage of the anti-saloon law; and
you allege that that vicinity was griven
over to drunkenness and debauchery on
tbe first payday following the passage of
the act, and then add: "The same results
have followed the abolition of the canteen
everywhere."
It is incredible that The Call manage
ment does not know those assertions to
be false. It must know that It 13 the
policy of the "War Department and of the
liquor power everywhere to discredit the
anti-canteen law, and that to that end
both the War Department and the Liquor
League are sending out those lying-re
ports to alt the papers that will publish
them. This must be known to The Call
as well as the fact that these many fabri
cations of the canteen's friends have been
shown to be false, time and again. The
Mayors of the cities where the riots on
payday are said to have occurred, the
constabulary and police force, the officers
in charge of the several commands con
cerned, have made affidavits innumerable
to show, and have thereby shown, tint
the stories of payday riots, the erection
of new saloons, etc., are absolute false
hoods, propagated by the "War Depart
ment and the rum power. This you mu3C
know. Then, in God's name, why do you
retail it regularly as news, if you are not
in â¢ the service of the canteen gang at
"Washington to deceive the people? The
value of any newspaper to the public Is
in direct ratio to the honesty and sincer
ity of that paper; and when it (.is known
that the "War Department or the liquor
league can procure in any newspaper the
publication of known falsehoods, with the
intent to deceive the public, the life of
that paper should speedily close. Very
truly, G. P. HURST,

It Is twenty-five years since Turkey
placed any naval orders in England, all
such contracts having gone to Italy and
Germany, chiefly to the latter country.
The only vessel now being built for Tur
key is a cruiser of 3250 tons, 12,000 horse
power and 22 knots speed, at Cramp's
yard. The contract price is $1,890,000, pay
able in twelve installments, work to begin
with the first payment In advance and to
complete in twenty-two months.
Japan Is contemplating the building of
six large docks Jn addition to the two , at
Yokohama and Kure of sufficient size to
accommodate ships of \ the Shikishima
class. The new docks will be located as
follows: Yoko3uka and Omlnato one each,
Sasebo ana Malziiro two each, apd one
each for Kobe and Hakodate. Within a
few years Japan will have twelve. large
docksâ four owned by private \ firms â of

The first report about the failure of the
NarVal trials proves to have been Incor
rect. The boat navigated the open sea for
forty consecutive hours without stoppages
and covered a distance of 260 miles in that
time. About one-half of the distance was
made while. the boat was submerged. The.
sea was rough, the crew does not appear
to have suffered unusual hardships and
French advocates of this type of subma
rine boats are naturally elated over the
result." # -;â¢/;
The l^atnha d' Amelia, supposed to be a
cruiser, built at Lisbon for the Portuguese
navy, has had her trials, with highly sat
isfactory results. The contract called for
5000 horsepower and a speed of 17.5 knots,
and the full power steam trial gave 5396
horsepower, and 20.6 knots speed. The ves
sel is of 1600 tons displacement and carries
the heavy armament of four 5.9-lnch
quick-firers, two 3.9-lnch, two three-pound

standing this formidable battery for so

lieutenant had fired at hist opponent six
seconds before the signal was given and
killed the midshipman. The court .'held

OUR GUESTS AND CLIMATE.
SAN FRANCISCO during the present week will
entertain many thousands of visitors. Probably
the city will be as near being crowded as at any
time in its history. Large numbers of these guests are
to be assembled morning, afternoon and evening in
thronged auditoriums, and other large numbers are
to be 'in the open air at the .shooting- park all day
long. Thus our summer climate is to be tried within
doors and out of doors by people gathered in large
multitudes, and it is safe to predict that from first to
last there will be felt no discomfort on account of the
weather. ,
We are going to give to all of our guests a cordial
welcome and the best entertainment our city can pro
vide. There will be dinners and social receptions and
fruits and flowers, not only in plenty but in profusion.
When all have been tried, however, the one thing that
will have contributed most to the enjoyment of guests,
and of ourselves, will have been the cool, bracing days
and nights that have kept every one in full vigor for
work or for pleasure.
We hardly appreciate the full value of our climate.
We grumble at times because of a fog or a wind that
blows a little too briskly for our satisfaction, but, in
comparison with the sweltering heat and humidity
that prevail during the summers in the East," our
breezes are genuine delights.
For upward of. three weeks now the reports from
the East have been filled with accounts of the severity
of the heat over the whole region from Kansas and
Nebraska to the Atlantic Coast. In the cities the daily
record of deaths caused by heat prostration is almost
like the report of casualties sent from a battlefield. In
fact, in the war in South Africa the British and the
Boers are not .killing one another so fast as men and
women are perishing beneath the fierce heats of New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston.
Nor is it in the cities only that the weather is like a
calamity. In the fields of Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska
the very crops are being parched and dried up by the
blistering sun. The corn fields that once promised to
yield bountifully have now been so badly blighted that
the farmers hardly see enough corn in prospect to feed
their hogs and cattle, snd, as a consequence, they are
sending them prematurely to market, and selling them
for whatever price can be obtained.
While such conditions prevail in the East in town
and country we receive our guests in a climate where
every hour of day or night is pleasant, wnere there
is always exhilaration in the breezes and comfort in
the sun. As a city for summertime conventions or
gatherings of any kind there is no other city in the
Union equal to this, nor even one that approaches it.
One of the notable results of the hot season in the
East was a demonstration of the . superiority of the
automobile over horse carriages. When horses were
dropping in the streets all over town the machine was
all right. .

TURNS IN THE FIRE ALARM
TO GET THE GIRL'S PICTURE
the present time the entire harbor and shipyard . can
be commanded by concealed batteries placed on Span
ish soil. To provide a sure harbor, it has been de
clared by a committee to be necessary to abandon the
western harbor altogether and to construct another
on. the eastern side of the rock. The estimated cost is
$20,000,000. Upward of ten years -will be required to
complete the work.
With such heavy, expenditures called for in the way
of providing for defense at home, it is not strange that
the British should be impatient over the continuance
of a war which is costing them more than $5,000,000 a
week. The latest popular outburst has been due to the
manner in which the press reports from the seat of war
are censored, and the fierceness with which Kitchener
lias been criticized ' for the- censorship shows how
irritable the people have become. Should Kitchener
lose his office, however, Salisbury will have to thank
the incapacity of the Liberals for not having to lose
his at the same time. ' : â¢ : - . .
WE publish a communication from : G. P.
Hurst, which indicates a state of- wounded
feelings on that gentleman's part because
we called for proof of Rev. Mr. Ferguson's statements
regarding the army canteen.
We must beg Mr. Hurst's pardon for saying that
we don't know that "the. stories of payday riots, the
erection of new saloons, etc., are absolute falsehoods,
propagated by the War Department, and the rum
power." Nor does he know it, nor is it known by any
one, for it is a falsehood. It is on a par with Rev. Mr.
Ferguson's statement that army chaplains "have been
ordered from Washington to cease reporting the army
saloon."
â¢ We are aware that there is some difference of opin
ion amongst army officers as to the effect of the can
teen and the results of its abolition; but we are also
aware that the preponderance of testimony favors the
canteen as against the deadfall. The Hursts, Fergu
sons and those who stand with them are a unit with
the rum power for the deadfall against the canteen.
The army surgeons, who have in charge the physical
health of the enlisted .men, are practically unanimous
in favoring the canteen as against the deadfall. The
deadfall is a stalking horse for worse vices than drunk
enness, which bring in their train those dreadful taints
which the army surgeon must deal with. When the
curse of all armies declines with the rise of the can
teen and increases again with its fall one would sup
pose that at least the anti-canteen clergy would be
impressed with the sanitary superiority of the canteen
over the deadfall. But they are not impressed. In
stead, they devote their time to making statements
about the President and Secretary of War that are
point blank lies, and to conjuring a rum power that
is in favor of a canteen when not a drop of rum or
any distilled liquor was allowed to be sold!
' Mr. Hurst's letter is a fair sample of the submer
gence of human intelligence and ordinary common
sense by a spirit of unreasonable fanaticism. He
assumes that "the War Department and the liquor
power are sending out lying reports to all the papers
that will publish them" to discredit the anti-canteen
law, and then adds that "this must be known to The
Call." It is not known to The Call, nor to Mr. Hurst,
nor to anybody else, for it is not true; and his cool
assumupticn that we arc taking War Department and
liquor league reports and imposing them upon our
readers as Associated Press news, or news gathered
by our special correspondents, is an impudent, unwar
ranted and bald falsehood.
The Fort Sheridan riots were reported by the Asso
ciated Press and were the subject of comment and
news treatment by all the papers in Chicago. They
held the whole district in terror for more than a day,
and were almost beyond the power of the civil author
ities.. Their existence, their prolongation, their cause
and their effect are as well established as the existence
of Mount Shasta. Army surgeons and chaplains, offi
cers and enlisted men know of those riots, and so do
hundreds of civilians and civil officers, by a sore ex
perience. And yet we have Mr. Hurst declaring that
"it is incredible that The Call management does not
know those assertions (of the riots) to be false."
A man who appeals so readily to the name of his
Creator <:o clinch his statements should be careful that
they are true.
The Call has published the news and the opinions of
interested people as tc the canteen. We believe the
preponderance of testimony is in favor of its substitu
tion for the outside rumhole. We know that it is
preferable to give soldiers a chance to indulge reason
ably in light beer and wine, rathef'than in poison
whisky. We know that it is better that such indul
gence should be inside the army post, and under disci
pline, instead of beyond discipline and in contact with
the other vices which are the physical and moral ruin
of men. Looking at the average soldier as an aver
age man, and he is, he is bound to have the average
appetites and follies of men, and it is better for him
that their satisfaction shall be made as little harmful
as possible. So far no system has been devised that
seems to be superior to the canteen. Prohibition is as
impossible in the army as it is in civil life. Therefore
there seems to be no choice between the canteen and
the deadfall. We prefer the less harmful. Mr. Hurst
and Rev. Mr. Ferguson prefer the more harmful and
are fighting for bad whisky, for the low vices, for the
tainted blood and rotten bones that are strung on the
deadfall! The style of their frantic fanaticism dis
credits them as guides of any public policy. Their
class have pursued the President with every fanatical
He that can be coined. One reverend gentleman, in
tfie course of an anti-canteen argument, represented
the President as a debauchee, and said that he was
drinking iiquor in the President's room at the Capitol,
where he and his Cabinet waited to consider belated
bills on the last night of a session of Congress. Means
were taken to. compel this fellow to openly confess
himself a liar. Others are sticking unmanfully to state
ments that they either know are false or do not know
to be true, and at the same time are lecturing the
wicked newspapers for publishing known facts, that
are disputed only by fools or fanatics.

A BELLE OF SALINAS. WHO SURPRISED THEIR FRIENDS BY
TRAVELING TO SAN FRANCISCO TO WED.
C. H. Murphy, chairman of thÂ© teachers'
executive committee, has issued the fol
lowing statement concerning the claim
made on the teachers for the return, of
$7000, which was paid for litigation by tha
merchant creditors:
A statement was recently Issued by the Mer
chant Creditors' Committee, requesting thÂ»
teachers and janitors of the San Francisco pub
lic schools to return to them the sum of $7000,
advanced by the merchant creditors to tha
teachers and Janitors of San Francisco in
March. 1300.
Keferenca to tha contract, which was pro
posed by the attorney for tha merchants, ac
cepted and entered into in March, 1900, by tha
committee of tha teachers, the Union Trust
Company, Asa R. Wells and this same Mer
chant Creditors' Committee, discloses the facts:
the Union Trust Company to pay this $7000 to
Mr. Wells for distribution to the teachers fcr
a valuable consideration, via.: the adjustment
of pending litigation, and the prompt payment
to them of the balance of all available funds
then in the- treasury of the city and county of
San Francisco, viz. : $20,834 81.
Secondâ Thi3 $7000 was used to pay all thÂ«
expenses of litigation undertaken by the teach*
ers/ amounting to about $2500. and tha balance
was- divided pro rata among the teachers.
It will thus be seen that the return of this
$7000 to the merchants is not called for by the
contract, which is an equitable one, and that
to return tha money would ba for the teachers
to defray the expenses of their litigation them
selves. No teacher is under any legal or moral
obligation to Day any portion of tha $7000 to
the merchants. In the course of the negotia
tions leading up to the final agreement it was
expressly recognized by both parties that tha
effect of the compromise would bo that the
teachers would get more than the face of their
salary claims in the event of the passaga of
the constitutional amendment authorizing the
payment of salaries for November and Decem
ber. 1838.
It may be well to state that Interest on thÂ»
paid now, because some merchants* claims arÂ»
being preferred in the the expenditure .of the
appropriation made by the Supervisors for the
interest.
TEACHERS WILL
NOT PAY CLAIMS
The Rev. 'William Rader preached an
Interesting sermon last night at the Third
Congregational Church. His subject was
"Science, and what it has done for re
ligion as illustrated in the theories of
John Fiske and Professor Joseph Le
Conte." Dr. Rader paid a high tribute to
the two learned men -who have recently
passed away, and said that they had aid
ed largely in the advancement of religious
thought by the dissemination of historical
and scientific ideas. These ideas always
contained the element of truth and did
much to manifest the providence of God,
Dr. Rader said.
"I would especially commend to my
hearers/' said Dr. Bader, "John " Flske's
book, 'The Destiny of Man.' for you will
find In it a tonic which will open your
eyes to your spiritual life. FIske places
the human spirit above all created things
and shows by scientific arguments the
eternal reality oÂ£Â» religion. I would rec
ommend that you read books of that class
rather than the current fiction of the day.
No books on spiritual light should be more
eaperly sought for.
"Professor Le Conte was the "Whlttler
of American science. He was a broad
minded man, a genial gentleman and a
beautiful character. 1 have heard him
traduced, criticised and accused of heresy
and dangrerous thought, but I know that
the peace of God was in his look when he
died. Who knows that he may find a
fulfillment of his doctrines In yonder
Â¦world and his beloved eyes be opened to
the glories and the mysteries of the king
dom of God. Professor Le O>nte had
earned my respect. He was a man who
told the truth, and I say 'Rejoice in the
man who does so.' Do not stone him, for
we have stoned men who have been
prophets. Rather stone the men who
snide you wrongly. Rejoice in the men
who tell the truth; whether in geology,
or history, or science of any kind. AH
hail to Fiske and Le Conte."

It is now thought that the Secretary of

sufficient reason for Strong to have taken

rious unions connected with the San Fran
cisco Labor Council to raise the $20,000 a
week from affiliated unions which Presi
dent McCabe of the Iron Trades Council
declared at the las't meeting of the Labor
Council Is necessary "to keep the boy3
from going back. to work." A meeting of
the special committee and leaders of the
labor movement to prepare the necessary
plans for raising this large ' amount- of
money each week from the members of
the various trades unions not out on
strike was held yesterday at 1159 Mission
street.
A proposition to increase the involun
tary per capita tax of 5 cents per week
to 12% cents, or 50 cents a month, was se
riously considered, but met with opposi
tion. It was stated during the course of
the debate that the strike of the cooks
and waiters was not progressing as well
| as had been expected at its inception; that
the metal polishers had given up their
strife; the butchers had returned to work
after less than ai week of conflict: the
I porters and packers had delayed their de
mands, and that ether organizations that
intended to follow in the footsteps of their
predecessors were weakening.
The machinists pleaded for a continu
ance of the strike and assistance in a
financial way for a week longer at lealst.
The leading members of the council turn
ed the tide of disaffection by securing the
passage of a resolution to place the mat- I
ter of Â¦ways and means in the hands of
the executive committee of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council.
The Iron Trades Council met in the
morning at their headquarters in the
Emma Spreckels building and discussed
what propositions the council Â¦would sub
mit to the Metal Trades' Association,
through the medium of the conciliatory
committee. The meeting was a long and
stormy one, some members saying that it
Â¦was impossible to keep a family on the
$6 a week allowed married men and single
men with dependents as strike benefits.
The disposition of the men seemed ad
verse to a continuance of the strike. A
compromise was effected by preparing a
statement embracing a modification of de
mands, which will be presented to-day.
The Beer Drivers' Union at its meeting
on Saturday night decided to cast its lot
with the other branches of .the trade.
There are three unions of brewers on the
coast, consisting of a number of branches
divided into eleven brewers' unions, ten
bottlers' unions and three labelers' unions.
It is necessary for all these to combine
in a movement against the Brewers' Pro
tective Association, in which all the brew
eries of this city and in this vicinity are
affiliated. It will be at least two weeks
before the brewers' and maltsters' unions
can take action. If the agreement asking
for an eight-hour work day should not be
signed by the boss brewers all the affil
iated unions which now enjoy the eight
hour day "will also go out on strike in
sympathy, or for lack of material, as they
are not allowed to handle the product of
any brewery which is declared unfair.
The advent of the national secretary is
anxiously awaited. Until his arrival no
precipitate action will be taken.

The twenty-fifth annual picnic and out
ing of the Draymen and Teamsters,'
â¢Union, which was held yesterday, at
tracted more than 1000 picnickers to
Schuetzen Park. From the moment the
crowd reached the shady hills and .vales
of the park until the time of the depart
ure of the last train for home not a single
unenjoyablo moment was passed. So well
had the committee of arrangements per
formed its duties that there was amuse
ment galore for everybody. The manage
ment of the park voted the picnic one of
the most orderly and best conducted ever
held on the grounds.
" After the last train had arrived and the
picnickers had finished their lunches the
races and games began. The contests,
which were for prizes of considerable
value, excited great interest and in many
cases much merriment. In the fat men's
race, which was by long odds' the event
of the day, Daniel Keating, president of
the Draymen and Tteamsters' Union, won
by a magnificent spurt, which gained for
him the applause of every fair lady pres
ent.
Â¦ More interest than usual was attached
to the picnic this year by reason of its
proximity to the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the founding of the order. This anni
versary falls on the 26th of November and
will be fittingly celebrated by a grand
ball and entertainment at Union Square
Hall.
The officers of the union and the com
mittees to whose efforts is due in a great
measure the success of yesterday's out
ing are as follows:
President, D. W. Keating; vice president, J.
Steuart; treasurer, John French* financial sec

above is a copy of the letter of appreciation sent by Robert WIeneke,
| grand marshal of the Schuetzen Verein, to Mrs. J. J. Wolf. Mrs. "Wolf Is
| the author of the "Schuetzen March and Two-Step" that was published in
II The Call last Sunday. She did Mr. Wleneke the honor of dedicating to him
this creation of her musical genius.
tfliis is not Mrs. Wolf's first composition. She has written many popular bits
of music, among which is the McKinley "Welcome March." This was played by
all the bands during the stay of the President in San Francisco, and has become
quite a favorite.
The "Schuetzen March" is remarkably catchy and melodious, and promises to
occupy a place of its own In the "ears of the musically inelined. So great has been
the demand for it since its publication in The Call that Mrs. Wolf has had it print
ed in sheet form, so it may be obtained at all the leading music stores.

A- R. Curtis' Luxor annexed the big 120
dog stake yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. The result surprised the wise^ ones
somewhat, not that the winner was a
newcomer, for he has been at the game
for a long while, and as a final getter, too,
but the almost unanimous verdict of the
talent, rendered some time ago, was that
Luxor had run his last final. Nor was
that all the luck that was credited to Al
bert Curtis, for before the dogs were
slipped for the deciding course first, sec
ond and third money was already his,
with Flying Fox as runner-up and Rector
reaching the semi-final.
The day's coursing was unusually good,
and but few flukey trials were recorded.
Down toward the finish of the card the
favorite players were made unhappy by
the unlooked for results. Luxor had beat
en Ripple, "White Hat and Narcissus with
out giving them a point, and then was
booked to race with Wedgewood, the
stake favorite. Jones' dog was made a 3
to 1 choice but failed to land. Rector came
next, and upset the figuring -of the wise
ones by getting the flag in a hard course
from Herschel's Pride, a 2 to 1 favorite,
and Little Sister followed by beating Van
dal at the same price. Flying Fox beat
Sister, and because of Rector's withdraw
al Luxor had a bye in the semi-final.
In the closing round the dogs were at
even at slip time. They ran an undecided,
and in the run-off the Fox was made
choice at 2 to 1. He showed the speed and
got a close turn. Luxor made a point and
scored the kill. ' , . â¢ - Â¦ â¢ '
Harlean Gladys went out in her first
course to Rienzi. It was ten to one that
she would get the flag from him, or at
least the talent figured that way. The
dogs went up the field like a double team.
When nearing the hare and as Gladys
6teadied herself for a drive Rienzi dashed
in, got the kill and was hailed the win
ner. Other short ends were: Vulcan beat
"Warship. Tyrone Prince beat Wedgewood.
For Glory beat Sir Pasha and was beaten
by Bonnie Pasha at 3 to 1; Lady Clare
beat Game Boy, Lilac beat Candelaria,
Sir Laurence beat Golden Russet, John

LOOLOOS TAKE
TWO IN IN A DAY
Hodson Loses Control and
Rube Levy Loses the
Crowd.
The wind blew all ways at once out at
the Harrison street baseball grounds yes
terday afternoon, and Reuben Levy's de
cisions followed the wind. Reuben tried
to be fair. He did not give either nine
the worst of it. He was just impartially
rank and the crowd lit into him.
But that was not the reason the ycung
men from the 6unny citrus belt walloped
the Dudes all around the lot. Mr. Hod
son of the Oakland aggregation, ran. a race
with the wind lor control, for one thing,
and lost it. Then the Looloos had their
batting clothes on and the fit of them was
beautiful to see. Also they played strong
to the pitching of young Mr. Jones, who
was closing his record-winning stunt that
day, and who could not be rattled, no mat
ter what the bleachers and the coachers
and the grand stand did to him. For the
crowd was with Oakland. That waa what
made the drubbing they were given more
beautiful to see to the eyes of the lovers
of fair play.
It began in the first inning and was
carried right out to the end. Brockhoff
struck out and Reitz went out from third
to first. Then the young men from Or
angeland broke off a trick they have of
playing winning ball with two men out.
Hutchinson made a two-bagger to deep
left along the line and Householder fol
lowed with one just like it in right field,
Bcoring Hutchinson. Then Reilly went out
to flrfct.
It was one. two, three for Oakland, and
then Householder laid down to rest in the
shade of the right field fence and was
called home by the umpire. Los Angeles
pushed Spies around in the second on a
bunt by Kelly, a wild throw to second by
Lohman and a. sacrifice by Brockhofit that
covered a pretty double steal by Spies and
Kelly, and again it was one, two, three
and out for Oakland.
Neither nine could do anything in the
third. In the fourth Spies flew out to cen
ter and Jones got to first. Brockhoff look
a walk on four balls and went ahead one
on Reitz' safe hit to right, Jones scoring.
Brockhoff scored on Hutchinson's hit and
that made two. Truck Eagan made a home
run over the fence for Oakland in this
inning, but that was all they could o.
It was blank all in the fifth. In the sixth
the heavy stick work of the Angels push
ed Brockhoff around, and the Oaklahds
got one also, because the gentleman who
plays in right field for the southerners
dropped two easy flies, one from Strieb
and the other from Arrellanes.
LOS ANGELES.
The seventh and the eighth were blank
and each side scored one in the ninth.
Also Mr. Reilly of Los Angeles cleverly
held up the umpire for a few minutes; dis
cussing the policy of permitting small
boys to gather within the foul lines, while
Jones got breath to go on with his pitch-

MORNING GAME-
OAKLAND.
There was nothing: to boast of In the
batting way in the morning game at Oak
land, although both Drennan and Hutch
insorx made home runs. Hutchinson lost
the ball in the trees beyond the right field
fence, and saved the game for his side.
The men in both clubs hit", it is true, but
not at critical times. It was in this game
that Jones began his record-breaking per
formance of pitching two winning games
in one day. He wanted to show his friends
what he could do, he said. The score:

TRAP SHOOTING
AT INLESIDE
pÂ»^-|FÂ«^HERE are only three disengaged
1 1 grain vessels In port and the own-
II er of at least one of them seems
,11 to think that freight rates are
going to jump. The British ship
Toxteth arrived here on June 15 and her
owners have since refused 3t)s 6d to load
grain for Europe. The firm that made
the offer deemed it a very liberal one, as
the Toxteth will carry nearly 5000 tons
of wheat, but the owners did not look at
it in the same light. As no higher bid
was made the ship has been taken to
Martinez and will lay up there until rates
reach the owners', expectations or drop
out of sight.
Of the other disengaged vessels in port
the Willy Rickmers and Otto Gildemeister
are tied up owing to the strike, the Max
well and Allerton will probably be char
tered this week and the Henry B. Hyde
and Henry Failing will probably load for
Australia or China. The steamships Arab
and Alameda also figure among the dis
engaged fleet, but they also are tied up
because of the strike.
Lahaina Is a Clipper.
The new barkentine Lahaina did re
markably well on her maiden run to the
Sound. It took her eleven days to make
tho run to Port Hadlock," but then she
had to buck a northwester all the way up
tho coast. In a letter to the builders
Captain Carlson said she was a fine
weather boat and made twelve knots an
hour, close hauled on the wind. Run
ning free and the wind abeam the cap
tain thinks the Lahaina will easily make
fourteen knots. The barkentine is bound
for Shanghai and her owners expect her
to make a record run.

News of the Sugar Fleet.
The bark Albert sailed for Honolulu
yesterday morning. She took quite a
number of passengers, among whom was
Mrs. Turner, wife of the chief officer.
This is the lady's first voyage and it was
only her husband's coaxing that got her
on the water.
Three of the belated fleet made port
yesterday. The barkentine Archer and
the bark Kaiulani . came in almost to
gether, but the Archer beat the Kiau
lani three days in the run from Honolulu.
Both vessels report light winds and
calms.
The French bark Montebello, seventy
five days from Newcastle, Australia, also
made port yesterday. The voyage was an
uneventful one.
Engineers to Hold an Election.
Since the disappearance of Frank
Bragg, the Marine Engineer's Association
has been without a secretary. An elec
tion will be held in a few days and half
a dozen candidates are out drumming up
votes. A thorough examination was made
of the late secretary's books and instead
of his being short the association owed
him money. It is said that Bragg if in
a private sanitarium in Southern Cali
fornia. He is supposed to have wandered
away while mentally unbalanced.- Some
one of the engineers on the coasting fleet
ran. across him in one of the southern
ports, so It is said, and placed him la the
sanitarium, where he is -now slowly re
covering.
Water Front Notes.
Captain Dan James of the tug Ida w
has a new deckhand of whom he expects
great things. Saturday evening he was
short a man and "hired". Jke Tuchler to
help him dock the schooner Czarina.
When the tug got alongside the codnsher
it was found that the only man aboard
was Captain Walstedt. All the others
had gone uptown to celebrate the big
catch made in Bering Sea. When it came
to a question of getting up the schooner's
anchor the captain wanted to send ashore
for men. Ike was equal' to the occasion,
however. "You pull on one capstan bar,
captain," said he. "and I'll pull on an
other, and I think we can. manage." Ike
worked harder for fifteen minutes than
he ever did in his life before, but finally
he got that fifteen fathom of chain in
and now Captain Dan looks upon him
as a world beater. - .
There is Â¦ still no Word from the Nome
steamers St. Paul and Conemaugh. The
John S. Klmball, which â arrived on the
Sound last night, will probably bring
some news of their .whereabouts.
The transport Grant sails " for Manila

William McDermott was caught on the
water front yesterday ' with, an
fan in his possession. by Detectives Egan
and' Freel. He said he bought it from
a stranger for 25 cents. The explanation
was not ; satisfactory, so he was locked
up en a charge of petty larceny.
A party of Italians, composed of three
men and two children, got a ducking yeB

began to back and finally pushed the
wagon and its occupants overboard and
then followed itself. The fishermen
pulled the entire party out.

ALOT of bloomer girls from Boston
âthey have been a long time from
Boston and from anywhere â went
out in^ the lot on Harrison and
Eighth streets yesterday forenoon
to play ball with Bushnell's boys. They
could not play â not to any great extent â
but the boys were good to them and so
the exhibition was more interesting than
it would have been otherwise, perhaps.
They are good boys, those Bushnell boys.
They would succor beauty in distress
without doubt if they should chance to
The bloomer girls were in gaudy uni
form, and wore a uniform scowlâ all but
the center fielder. She was a tentative
blonde, of the strawberry type, and the
comedienne of the aggregation. Between
times she chewed gum and Â¦went among
the crowd in the stand and bleachers,
making remarks of the flippant kind and
selling photographs of her sisters in the
field. The crowd, which was fairly large
and more than fairly good-humored, re-
come across beauty In that plightâ and
they .most certainly treat age with proper
respect. They showed it yesterday.
NEWS OP THE SEA AND BAY
There was a man In the bloomer nineâ
the catcherâ but he was at a distinct dis
advantage because he was the only man,
and because the Bushnell boys went after
him and got him, too, at every opportun
ity.
But though the Bushnell boys were good
boys they would not carry their gallantry
to the extent of permitting the bloomer
girls to win. The score was 9 to 8 in favor
of the Bushnells. The bloomer girls play
ed at Oakland In the afternoon. They play
ball again at Harrison and Eighth streets
this afternoon.
The rumor, It Is well to state in passing,
that the shortstop of the girls was a man
in bloomera, is utterly and entirely with
out foundation. The lady says '. she la a
lady, and the real thing. The story was
started by envious rivals. Other ladies
have shapes like that, and the shortstop
was not the only girl that could play ball.
The pitcher is a pretty good ball player
herself, and nobody accuses her of being
a man.
celved her kindly. Likewise It received
kindly the apparent efforts of the Bush
nell boys to let the girls score, by over
throwing and by clever errors at critical
times.
Play was rather light on the California
tennis courts yesterday, but. during the
day a o few good matches were played

favor of the former was 4-6. 6-43-0
Young Smith is rapidly coming to the
front and as he has a good style he will
undoubtedly be heard from in the future

BERKELEY, July 14.â When the Town
Trustees meet Monday night the proposi
tion will be brought up to declare void the 1
franchise over the old horse-car line be
tween East and West Berkeley, now held
by the Oakland Transit Company. Cap
tain W. H. Marston, the president of the
board, is the leader In the movement to
disfranchise the road.
When the line was purchased recently
by the Transit Company work of fearing
up the roadbed was immediately com
menced, presumably with the object of
putting down a better track. Since then
no eara have been run. This is contrary
to the franchise, which calls for the "con
tinuous" running of cars. On this ground
members of the board claim the right to
make the company forfeit its privilege.
"When the original fifty-year franchise
Â¦was granted some sixteen years ago no
provision was made for the town to se
cure a percentage of the receipts.. For this
reason the Trustees want the franchise
forfeited and another one issued. Town-
Attorney B. A. Hayne. under Instruction
from the board, is looking up the law on
the matter.
The old franchise has become valuablp
nrooerty In recent years. The road would
make the connecting loop between the San

OAKLAND, July 14.â Organized labor is
preparing to celebrate Labor- -day as -It
has never been celebrated in Oakland be
fore. Labor Is well organized upon this
side of the bay and it has been decided
to make this day a general holiday and
to provide a series of events that will
make It memorable.
The Federated Trades has taken the
initiative In this and has . appointed a
committee consisting of C. D. Rogers,
State president of the Federated Trades,
who Is a resident of Oakland, and Messrs.
Cole and Hopkins to have charge of the
day. This committee will arrange the de
tails, consult with ihe various unions and
the public officials and make the neces
sary arrangements.
It is proposed to have the celebration
entirely within the unions and it is ex
pected that they will vie with each other
as to the showing each will make.
There is a general movement through
out the unions of Oakland to support the
butchers if any of them should get into
trouble with their employers through the

BERLIN, July 14.-Last week ended
with a new low record of quotations in

trade of the week. The news from thn
industrial centers continued unfavorable
The newspapers generally concur in the
opinion that the downward movement haq
not yet been exhausted. All describe the
tone of the market as extremely dp
pressed and hopeless.
Many companies, in the course of the

In the American section there was an
immense decline, the greatest being in
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, which
fell off 17 points, and Atchison, which fell
off 16 points. Union Pacific shares de
clined 14 points and other' Americans
showed proportionate losses. It is now
rumored here that the decline was the
result of a preconcerted plan by the lead
ers of the market to shake out the weak
bull Interests. Fortunately the local bull
is a comparatively small one but
the moral effect of trading has been de
cidedly pressing.
The money outlook for the future it
quiet and easier.
What had seemed a promising outlook
has grown worse from the day of the an
nouncement of the failure of the Leip
zeiger Bank. While at first this seemed
an isolated event it now appears to have
involved Germany, Belgium and even
Paris in a severe depression. Germany,
anxious to strengthen its financial po
sition, threw securitieu recklessly on an
unreceptive market. Every fresh effort
to realize only accentuated the downward
movement. Following ; this continental
depression came the Argentine finance
bill riots. Next came the most serious
and most unexpected blow of allâ the bad
break In New York, just when the dis
bursement of a big crowd of Impending
dividends, estimated at Â£130,000,000, led
London to expect the strongest American
support. Naturally the bottom dropped
out of everything here. Consols touched
the lowest point since 1875 and home iails
fell off 20 to 30 per cent from last year's
highest figures.
LONDON, July 14.â There Is little en

view of financial conditions in-London at

described as bad and the most optimistic
are forced to admit, that the era of re
covery and prosperity, so often predicted,
must now be postponed to a very indefin
ite future.

CHICAGO. July 14.â The problem of di
rect transformation of coal into elec
tricity without the medium of steam en
gine and dynamo â that will o f the wisp
that has so long and successfully eluded
chemists and electrical engineersâ has at
last been solved by Assistant City Chem
ist Kugo Jone, and his invention, a coal
consuming battery, has been patented,
bearing date of June 25, 1901. Speaking
of the effect of his invention, Mr. Jone
said to-day:
"The shortcomings of the steam en
gine have been long recognized by engi
neers. The waste of heat energy in pro
ducing steam from coal and converting it
into power Is more than 90 per cent- In
some engines: even with the best it does
not fall below 80 per cent In my battery
electrical energy is produced by oxidation
of lead and of ferrous chloride. The ox
idation â¢ is effected by nitric acid, which
after deoxidatlon is again regenerated by
being brought into contact with air. The
nitric acid, therefore, is not used up.
"Lead and sulphur dioxide are obtained
by heating sulphate of lead with pow
dered coal in retort, the proportion of
these -being twelve parts of sulphate of
lead to one part of powdered coal. The
retort is heated by coal ordinarily, though
gas. gasoline or oil may be used.
"In the battery the lead and sulphur
dioxide, after having been utilized for the
production of electricity, combine to form
sulphate of lead. This can again be
broken up by heating with coal and can
once more be used for generating electri
city. The one feature of my battery la
the conversion of heat into electricity."

OAKLAND, July 14.â The announce
ment of tb- death of Harvey N.
Sloper this morning came as a
shock to the community In which
he had so many friends, for it was
hardly known that he was sick. He was
about his usual haunts on Wednesday
evening, attended a meeting of the direc
tors of a company in which he was inter
ested, dropped into the Elks' clubrooms
for a few moments and then went home
to be taken with a chill that developed
into pneumonia, from which he died be
fore daylight this morning at his home
on Myrtle street. He was sick scarcely
more than three days and it was not even
certain that he was sick enough to send
for his mother, the widow of the late
State Senator Eli S. Denison, who was
summering at L"ake .Tahoe. When death
came his mother and sisterB.were com

a special train this afternoon and arrived
in Oakland at midnight. HJs wife, one
sister, Mrs. R. B. Ayer, and his brother
in-law, R. B. Ayer, were with him at the
time of his death. Pneumonia of the most
rapid type was the direct cause of death.
Harvey N. Sloper was one of the most
popular of the young men of club and
business life in Oakland. He was the step
son of the late Senator EH S. Denison. and

General Manager Cooke, under date of June

but that it Is not far distant. "We are nego

possible and very probable that the entire out
fit will be on the cars or on the wapon road

headed for the Inyo County oil fields." He
sends a lift of San Francisco men who are in

benefits of successful operation almost beyond

the venture by taking 6tock. To make the in

The most Interesting clause to the gen

should the average price received for the

slashed and stabbed his victim in a dozen

interfere. When ycung Welch fell b'eed

crowd, but was found hiding in one of
the buildings half an hour later by Offi

arrest.
Whalen, who is not yet 20 years o'd,
refused to talk.
Both the murderer and his
victim had gone to the pleas

the French society's celebra

the fatal quarrel began, but
the two youths had been

ENDING TO
QUARREL
In addition to this there was an excess
of $17,901,133 in the value of silver bullion
exported over the value of that metal im
ported. Â¦
Notwithstanding this large balance of
trade In favor of the United States, figures
show that the imports of gold during the
year exceeded the exports of that metal
by but $11,342,332. This mean* that the
immense balance of trade between this
country and the rest of the world was
largely settled by other means.
A certain amount of gold is carried
abroad by American tourists and return-
Ing European?, but as most of these carry
letters of credit thla amount Is relatively
small. A large part of the balance goes to
pay freight bills on American exports car
ried in foreign steamers and some of it
to pay Interest and dividends on American
securities held abroad. The small imports
.of gold in the face of a large balance of
trade durlnjr the past year, however, is
principally due to the fact that American
capitalists are now allowing much of their
money to remain in Europe for investment
and sales of bonds by foreign gox-ern
ments in the United States have gone far
toward settling the balance of trade.
The principal items of American export
are breadstuffs. live animals, provisions,
cotton and mineral oils. During thiÂ» year
just closed the total export* Â«f breadstuff*
amounted in value to $2Â«7.4S7,233: cattle and
hoga amounted to J36.M7.0fi2; orovislons tr>
$179,875,250. cotton tr> $."813,283,573. and min
eral oils to $69,905.K89. Each of these arti
cles showed Increases, thougrh while the
quantity of mineral oils exported was
greater than in the previous year. thÂ« Fe
duetion in prices reduced the valuation
nearly $5,000,000 below last year's figures.
A preliminary statement prepared by
the Bureau of Statistics In the Treasury
Department shows that the combined val
ue of Imports and exports for the fiscal
year amounted to $2,310,413,077. against
$2,244,424,2*56 for the year ending June 30,
1900, the largest previous record.
The imports for the year amounted to
$822,756,533, a decrease of S27.1S4.651 in com
parison with the imports for the previous
year. The exports amounted to $1,487,656.
544, an increase of $93,173,482 in comparison
with the previous year, making the bal
ance of trade for the year In favor of
the United States $664,900,011, or an increase
of $120,358,113 over the balance of trade for
the previous year.

LONDON, July 15.â "The intense heat
has completely dried up the country
around Berlin," says the Berlin corre
spondent of the Times, "and all moisture
has withdrawn from the soil to a depth
of several feet. Fruit is falling from the
trees before it is ripe and potato and hay
crops have been seriously affected by the
drought."
COPENHAGEN". July 14.â Extreme heat
continues throughout Denmark. Seven
deaths due to heat were reported to-day.
GENEVA, July 14.â There is no abate
ment of the terrible heat. At noon to-day
the temperature was 99 degrees Fahren
heit. Numerous cases of heat prostration
and slight sunstroke were reported.
ETJEOPE SUFFERS FROM HEAT.
drought ever experienced in this section
was" broken this afternoon by a terrific
rainfall of more than two hours' dura
tion, the volume of rain being almost
equal to a cloudburst. The storm was ac
companied by a wind of almost tornado
force. Reports Indicate that the rain is
general in this vicinity. It has come just
In the nick of time to save the cotton
crop. It will benefit the fruit crop and
supply water for stock, lack of which
had caused much distress.
The Southern Methodist Episcopal
Church, recently erected at a cost of $15,
000. was partially demolished and a num
ber of small houses In the northern por
tion of the city were wrecked. Shade
trees and window glass throughout the
city suffered. A tornado Is reported to
have passed over the Chickasaw Nation,
but. there are no particulars here.
DENISON, Tex., July 14.â The worst
.RAIN- BREAKS THE DROUGHT.
KANSAS CITV. July 14.â No relief cams
to-day to break the almost unprecedented
drought in the Southwest. The day was
a repetition of the past two weeks, with
reports from many places in Western
Missouri,' Kansas and tha Territories of
temperatures above the ICO mark. At most
places the sun shone mercilessly, with not
even a fitful ciould to break Its rays nor a
slight breeze. In Kansas City last night
conditions proved more bramble, a breeze
from the north alleviating the conditions,
hut a day of Intense heat followed.
To-night there Is a prospect of rain In
Oklahoma, but there are no indications
of a change fr3m any other part of the
Southwest.
With no relief in sight the fears for the
crops that have been experienced daliy
are fast becoming realities, and the scar
city of water and generally dry conditions
make the element of fire almost a serious
one. What tha real damage to corn, the
crop most affected, will be is problematic
al, but it is probably safe to say that half
the crop will be lost. The supply of water
is short in almost every direction, and the
shipments of cattle and hogs to this mar
ket to save them continue.
In Kansas City to-day the Government
thermometer registered 102. and Â«t Mary
ville, Kan?., 104 was recorded, against 100
yesterday. There were three prostrations
at Marysvllle.
ARDMORE. I. T.. July 14.â Reports from
the cotton belt show that cotton Is being
injured by the drought that has prevailed
in the Chlckasaw Nation for the past five
weeks. Unless rain fall within the next
few days crops will be cut short. About 60
per cent of the corn crop has already been
ruined. The crop of other grains is a total
failure. ' *
ST. PAUL, July 14.â The hot -wave con
tinues throughout Minnesota and the Da
kotas. At Huron a child went 'to sleep in
the sun and died from the heat. New Ulm.
Minn., reports o temperature of 104. with
a number of prostrations. The State ag
ricultural experimental farm reports that
the hot weather is doing great damage to
wheat in Southern Minnesota and that
chinchbugs are very numerous and are
contributing to the destruction.
OMAHA. July 14.â This State has had
a very torrid dav. The thermometer here
registered 104. The atmosphere was fresh,
however, with an absence of anything
that tended to hot winds. Reports from
th'e State are to the effect that rain is
needed, but with the absence of winds the
crops will stand considerable hot weath
er. Spring wheat and oats in Nebraska
are well nigh a failure.
BURLINGTON, Iowa, July 14.â To-day
Â¦was the sixth day in succession that the

After leaving thÂ« saloon the fire fiend
went to the bam of the Signal Transfer
Company at 1114 Lsrkin street and applied
his torch for the fourth time within two
hours. Altogether eighteen horses were
burned to death and more than $3000 worth
cf property destroyed*
A short time afterward a blaze was dis
covered in a barn on Olive avenue^ be
tween Larkin and Polk, but was extin
guished before any serious damage was
done. A young man' answering the "de
scription of the one who met Mrs. Wilson
was eeen leaving the place immediately
after the fire broke out. An Investigation
showed that the fire was started at the
bottom of a chute around which a lot of
hay had been piled-. One of the hostlers
was sleeping upstairs in the loft, but he
managed to get out before the fire gained
any head was'-.
Soon afterward a j-oung man with
wild starin? eyes entered the saloon at
Gear?' and Jjarkin^ and after looking \n
qulsitlvely at the walls and ceiling, went
to the rear and remained there for about
five minutes. He had left the saloon only
a very short time when fire was discov*
*red in the rear of the saloon. An exami
nation showed that the blaze was started
under the stairways where a young man
named Adelstein had seen the stranger
standing a few minutes before* His de
scription fits that of the man who was
seen in the vicinity of the other two fires.
Mrs. Wilson's description of the mtn
tallies exactly with that of the alleged
firebug.
Rushing out into the street to sound an
alarm, she was mot by a dark young man,
who asked her to direct nlm to the near
est fire boxi She pointed toward it. when
the fellow ran in the opposite direction
and quickly disappeared.
A few minutes before the fire broke out
In the barn of the Can Mateo Dairy Com
pany on Elm avenue, between Van Ness
and Franklin, a young man named Tony
Siminhoff-, living at 220 Elm avenue, no
ticed the door of the barn partly open.
He called his sister's attention to it, but
she thought lightly of It and advised him
to go to bed-. A few minutes later Mrs.
Wilson, the sister, happened to look out
of the window and saw flames bursting
through the door of the team.
After a thorough investigation Fire
Marshal Towe and Detective Tom Gibson
are satisfied that the series of fires early
yesterday morning were the work of an
incendiary-. The firebug is said to be a
youns man, who Tras seen in the saloon
at Geary and Larkin streets, which was
among the places set on lire Saturday
night. He is descrfoed as being about 25
years of age-, medium height, clean shav
en and with dark hair and eyes. The
authorities are reasonably certain that
the fellow is insane.
Authorities Are Satisfied That
He Is Mentally
Deranged.
Seen in a Saloon Owned
by One of His "
Victims.

BIG LITIGATION
IN BODIE MINES
Mrs. Hearst and Haggin
Ask Judge Morrow
for Injunction.
Allege That { Kelly & Doyle
Have Jumped North
Noon Mine.
The first step in what promises to be a
hotly contested litigation was taken last
Saturday .forenoon In the United States
Circuit Court, when a pstition for a writ
of injunction was filed on behalf of Mrs.
Phebe Hearst and J. B. Haggin'to restrain
the firm of Kelly & Doyle from taking
ores out cf the Noonday and the North
Noon mines,' near Bodle;
Mrs. Hearst and Mr. Haggin are the
owners of the mines, and the assessment
work was done on the Noonday for the
benefit of that mine and the North Noon
as well; Kelly & Doyle, alleging that no
assessment work had been done on the
North Noon, entered upon that property
and proceeded to extract ore therif rom.
They also leased the Syndicate .mill, in
Bodie, of J. Parr, the owner, for the pur
pose of working up the ore taken from
the mine.
Hearst and Haggin, represented by
Deal, Tausky & Wells, asked the court in
their petition to restrain Kelly & Doyle
from proceeding further with the extrac
tion and working of the ores from the
North Noon mine. Judge Morrow issued
a citation commanding Kelly & Doyle to
appear before the court on August 5 and
show cause, if any they have, why they
should not be enjoined from further tres
passing upon the property mentioned.
Deputy United States Marshal Burnham
started for Bodie at 6 o'clock last Satur
day evening to serve the citations'. The
litigation arising out of this Issue will be
Important as well as interesting, and it is
expected that the legal phases of assess
ment work will be thoroughly reviewed.
The mines have already given promise of
great richness and are worthy of an ex
pensive legal battle, which will be fought
in the United States Circuit Court in the

At coon the car lines leading to the
Chutes brought crowds of men, women
and children to the gaily-decorated
grounds. American and French flags were
In evidence everywhere and the children
of sunny France with their American-born
offspring entered thoroughly into a day
of complete merriment. The best of order
prevailed and the presence of a. force of
police officers was only necessary to watch
over the safety of the pleasure-seekers.
"The various committees were at the
grounds at an early hour and when the
visitors commenced to arrive everything
was In complete order. The arrival of the
French Consul General, accompanied by
the Consuls of Mexico and Guatemala,
was , the signal for a salvo of cheering.
The official representative of France was
In full uniform and as he was escorted
Into the pavilion of the Chutes the mili
tary band in attendance rendered the
"Marseillaise," the air being sung by the
happy visitors.
The large pavilion of the Chutes was not
sufficient to accommodate those who de
sired to listen to the literary and musical
exercises. The interior of the building was
tastefrully decorated with the colors of
the republics of France and America. At
2 p. m. the place was crowded and shortly
afterward the' general and sub-commit
tees escorted the French Consul General
to tho stage. :
The exercises opened with the overture
to "Fra IMavolo, played by Roncovieri's
