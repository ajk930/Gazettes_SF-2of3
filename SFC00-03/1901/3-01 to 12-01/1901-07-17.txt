unnecessary delays, caused doubtless by
the - misinterpretation of orders from
headquarters. The result was great in
convenience to those who were expect
ing friends from the East, and who had
been Informed with posltlveness that
certain trains would arrive at specified
hours. The hours came and went, but the
expected train failed to materialize for
hours after the scheduled time.
The Iowa delegation arrived at the Oak
land Mole at 3 o'clock. On the arrival of
the party on this side of the bay the mem
bers of the reception committee, who
had been on duty since midnight, proÂ»
vided them with accommodations and
they went on their way. rejoicing. The
party numbered 100 persons. Specials
which arrived last night were met at,
the Oakland Mole and escorted to this
side of the bay by the reception detail
at that point. The â¢ crowds Â¦ were well
handled and little confusion was notice
able.
; At midnight nearly 8000 Leaguers had
registered at the Pavilion. Arrangements
have been made to register 6000 more
to-day. The registration force under the
guidance of Chairman Klngrsbury has
been largely increased , for the occasion.
THE Epworth Leaguers are in
our midst, and San Franciscans
are proud to do them honor. Sev
eral thousand arrived yesterday,
but the bulk of the big army,
Â¦which was expected yesterday,
will not arrive until to-day.
Nevertheless, San Francisco's streets
show the effect of the appearance in the
community of thousands of strangers
wearing badges, white caps and the flut
tering flags and other Epworthian in
signia. That .the Leaguers have taken
possession of the city for a period, the
crowded thoroughfares amply prove.
That they are being taken care of in a
fraternal spirit, a glance at the head
quarters of the general committee will
testify. It is a glad season in which ail
alike testify by their acts to the cordial
spirit of amity and friendship that b'.nds
the visitors from the Kast to their fel
lows of the Pacific Coast.
Contrary to expectations, the half-hour
trains announced on the previous even-
Ing for arrival, failed to appear, yester
day until after nightfall. Only two- spe
cials arrived during the day, bearing per
haps 1000 delegates. That number was
Increased later by the arrival of other
specials which had been detained in tran
sit from five to twenty hours -because of
the crowded state of the roads,' which
rendered rapid travel impossible.

Â¦;.The choral programme began with "The

During the evening TV. F. Skeele of Los

pleasure. But neither organ nor organist
was heard to best advantage under the
circumstances and the really fine instru
ment cannot be Judged by Its work last

good numbers were the following:

Another feature of unusual Interest was
the cornet playing of the Park sisters, a
quartet of clever girls, who handle the
brass like veterans and produce most
pleasing results therefrom. They played
a "Faust" arrangement, and, persistently
encored, a transcription of "Annie

of Chicago also added to the pleasure of
the evening.

President of Proposed Exposition
Makes Effort to End an Inter

ST. LOUIS. July 16.â A letter has been
addressed to Thomas M. Carter, chairman
of the national committee, by President
Francis of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position, requesting an official definition
of the boundaries of the Louisiana Pur
chase. The letter, in part, follows:
"The information Is desired to insure
uniformity in the maps and historical ac
curacy in the literature pertaining to the.
world's fair. We also desire it in order
to perfect the Louisiana Purchase organ
ization for co-operation ln the exposition.
In this connection I wish to call your at
tention to the difference in the maps Is

years, some of them projecting the Louis
iana Purchase territory through' to the
Pacific Ocean; others limiting It to the
watershed line between the Mississippi
and the Pacific.
"A report made to Congress several
years ago by the Government commission
seems to afford some basis for the claims
of those who think the Louisiana terri
tory extended to the Pacific. An official
expression on the weight to be given tni3
report is considered desirable."
Strikers Will Return to Work.
DENVER, July 16.â The striking hod-

State Board of Arbitration, after hearing
both sides of the controversy, decided
that the contractors â¢ could not afford to
pay higher wages under existing con
tracts, but recommended that an Increase
be granted on January 1 next. The hod
carriers are getting $2 50 and the mortar
mixers $2 75. They a3ked for $3 and $3 50

voted to invite bids for fuel oil. to be

SAN JOSE, July 16.â The tragic se
quel to the love romance of pretty
Louisa Navaret and Charles J.
Johnson, who yesterday committed
suicide after a futile attempt to kill,
his sweetheart, was described before a
Coroner's jury this afternoon. Miss Nav
aret was the principal witness. Her
wounds are not as severe as was at first
Eupposed and she was able to come in
from the County Hospital. Aside from the
bandages on her head one would not have
known she had been through such an ex
citing ordeal. She stood and chatted and
exhibited no sign of remorse.
Miss Navaret's story of the attempt on
her life and the suicide of Johnson was
practically the same as that given in The
Call this morning. For a year she and
Johnson had been engaged, and he was
continually demanding that they be mar
ried right away. Every time she post
poned the date he threatened to kill her,
and these awful threats he nearly carried
out yesterday.
The girl said Johnson fired four shots at
her. After two of these had struck her he
stood coolly by and loaded his revolver and
then sent one of the bullets crashing into
his own brain.
Mrs. Navaret, the girl's mother, aaid
that Johnson declared to her that unless
the girl married him he would kill her and
himself.
The jury returned a verdict that John- .
son came to his death from a -Â¦ gunshot
wound inflicted at his own hands.
Johnson was a native of Sweden and 26
years old. He was employed as a lineman
at the electrical works in Redwood City.
He had no relatives in California, but 'his
mother and father reside at Eau Clafre,
Wisconsin.
There is little doubt that Miss Navaret
played fast and loose with Johnson's af
fections, and this, with his mad infatua
tion for the girl, led him to .commit the
rash act. That the' girl escaped death
. seems almost miraculous. Both bullets
lodged between the parietal and temporal
bones of the skull. After the inquest to
day she gazed on her dead lover's body,
and as she emerged from the dead room a
tear glistened in her eye, but this soon
dried . and she became as gay as a bride.

Oil Discoveries in Texas Cause Prices
to Rise to Astonishing
Figures.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 16.â The .recent dis
covery of oil in abundant quantities in
Duval County, this State, has caused the
prices of lands throughout that section
to advance to astounding figures. Prior
to the oil discovery the lands were pracÂ»
tically worthless, except for cattle graz
ing, and could be purchased for .50 cents
to $1 per acre. These lands are now
selling readily for $500 per acre.
Joaquin Miller, the "poet of the Sierr
ras," who purchased about 2000 acres of
land in that section more than a year
ago for a few dollars when there was no
thought of oil existing there, could now
get nearly $100,000 for his holdings. The
Duffey Petroleum Company, .which owns
the best part of the oil lands and pro
ducing wells in the Beaumont fields, has
leased several thousand acres in the
Duval County fields. The company will

Pretty Louisa Navaret Exhibits Neither Pity Nor Hatred for the
Man Who Committed Suicide, After Attempting to Murder Her,
Because She Had Played Fast and Loose With His Affections
The Conservative newspapers generally
commend the paper. The Times calls on
Lord Rosebery to "place his great abili
ties at the service of the country by
throwing himself, heart and soul, into the
v.-ork of converting the Liberal party to
the policy in which he believes. It al
ludes to his "singular advantagesâ birth,
ability and nationalityâ for playing an
important part at a critical time."
The Daily Chronicle asks if Lord Rose
bery will take his part toward realizing
the desired end. The Daily News regards
Lord Rosebery as "standing outside the
vineyard and throwing stones at the
workers." Going on to analyze the let
ter, the paper defines it as a "deliberate
and mischievous effort to prevent re
union."
Lord Rosebery's pronouncement is con-
Eidered by the Daily Telegraph as "sev
ering the last connection with a hopeless
opposition." The Daily Chronicle says:
"It is destined to have a profound effect
upon the country, pointing to the forma
tion of a National Liberal party, num
erous materials for which are scattered
within easy reach."
"It is a matter of sorrow and anxiety,"
he says, "to see a weak Government faced
by a weaker opposition at a Juncture of
foreign hostility and international com
petition which needs all the vigilance,
power and agility at our command." He
believes that Great Britain is at a crisis
which may have unlimited effects upon
its future.
The Liberal party can become a power,
he continues, only when it ehall have
made u]> its mind on the "imperial ques
tions which are at this moment embodied
in the war." After asserting that "th-5
whole <?mpire has rallied to the war," he
discusses the attitude of the Liberal pEcrty.
"What is the attitude of the Liberal
party?" he asks. "Neutrality and an open
wind. Now I contend that this is an im
possible attitude and spells impotence. No
party can exist on such conditions." '
He declares that the difference would
not cease to operate when the war is over,
because "statesmen who disassociate
themselves from a nation in a great na
tional question, such as the war in which
we all strive to suffer together, disassoci
ate themselves for much longer than they
think." He considers that the severance
is a "sincere, fundamental and incurable
antagonism of principles with regard to
ihe empire at large and our consequent
policy." As there is this "honest and ir
reconcilable difference on questions of the
first iaipoitance," he sees no favorable
issue. Lord Rosebery concludes with a
gloomy touch.
LONDON, July 17.â Lord Rosebery has
issued a manifesto on the divisions in the
Liberal party* It is contained In a letter
to the City Liberal Club, which had In
vited him to deliver an address. He dis
claims any desire to re-enter politics, but
speaks out "under the remarkable char
acter" agreed upon by Liberal members
of the House of Commons of "hearty and
undisputed allegiance to the leader and
complete liberty jof action to dissent with
regard to the one vital question before
the country."

CRISIS AHEAD
TIENTSIN. July 16.â The orders for the
depasture of the Bombay cavalry have
been countermanded and the strength of
the British troops remaining here will be
increased by 1000 men.
It was at the meeting of July 11 that the
Ministers had eomething in the nature of
an agreement as to the indemnity, but al
most immediately a radical difference de
veloped between Great Britain and Rus-
Ela as to the details of the plan of pay
ment. All the Ministers were- ln accord
with the scheme early ln June, subject to
the approval of their governments, but
Great Britain disapproved the arrange
ment on the ground that it did not ade
quately protect her commercial inter
ests
The neutral Ministers assert that either
Great Britain or Russia must make ma
terial concessions before a conclusion of
the agreement is possible. Meanwhile
the committees of the Ministers are work-
Ing upon comparatively unimportant de
tails, such as improvements in navigation.
If the financial question was settled the
negotiations could be closed in a day.
â¢"LI Hung Chang keeps sending strenuous
requests to the Ministers of the powers to
present a complete plan. He represents
that China is willing to accept any rea
sonable terms and is chiefly anxious to
know definitely what the powers require,
so that she may begin compliance with
the terms. The Ministers regard news
paper accusations of procrastination on
their part as exceedingly unjust. The
Government and not the Ministers is
responsible, the Ministers say, for the
deadlock.
PEKING, July 16.â The Ministers of the

Mr. Crews is also editor of The Canadi
an Epworth Era. &He was born in the
county of Lambton,1857, and receiv9ftÂ»his
education at the Ingersoll High School
and Victoria â¢ University. After ordina
tion he spent one year as assistant editor
of the Christian Guardian, and has been
stationed In St. Catharines, Hamilton,
Winnipeg and Toronto. He was elected
to his present position in 1895. . Since then
he has traveled through all parts of the
Dominion in the prosecution of his work.
Rev. G. R. Turk and Rev. G. W. Kirby
Of Toronto arrived yesterday over the
Santa Fe. They are popular divines of
the Methodist church. They have no
church South, Episcopal, } Reformed or
other factions. There is only one church
in Canada, all lines having been swept
away fourteen years ago, when the union
of the churches took place.
Among the most prominent of the'Can
adian arrivals Is Rev. James Henderson,
D.D., of Toronto. He is associate mis
sionary secretary for the Dominion, and
he .will respond to the address of welcome
Thursday afternoon for 'â¢ his delegation.
He is said to be a most eloquent, and at
tractive speaker.
"Our delegation will be augmented by
parties coming on other trains, so that
we will have fully 250 Canadians present.
This will be more than we had at Indian
apolis in 1899. We will stay nearly a
month visiting throughout the State.
There are plenty of Canadians in Cali
fornia. Ontario, in Southern California,
is named after the province of Ontario,
and is largely inhabited by natives of
that province. â¢
"Among the more noted personages on
our special were Rev. T. E. Shore, D.D.,
Toronto; Rev. W. - J. Smith, Brantford;
Rev. C. T. Scott, London; Rev. E. E.
Scott, Vancouver, and Rev. E. S. Rowe,
Victoria,"
"Our work in Canada is in good condi
tion. It was never more effective nor the
outlook more hopeful. Our membership
has not grown to any extent during the
year just closed, but otherwise we are in
good condition.
"I am to preside at some of the meet-',
ings, and in conjunction with the other
two general secretaries will constitute
a business committee to handle all the
business that comes up.
"There are thousands of Leaguers on
the road," said the Rev. Mr. Crews on
his arrival at the Pavilion last evening,
"and the railroads are doing nobly by
us. To think of the men working as they
have to and no more delays than we have
had is a credit to them. Some conduc
tors told us that they had not slept for
three days, and the work had not yet be
gun.
"The unique feature of this convention
is the missionary exhibit and conferences.
"We never have had such an attractive
missionary display as the one now being
installed in the Pavilion. The thing to be
emphasized in our work this year is mis
sions.
"The registration of delegates is more
Â¦systematically done here than ever before
and will give us a much more accurate
knowledge of the attendance than we
have ever had before. We will surely
have a grand convention."
Rev. A. C. Crews of Toronto, Canada,
general secretary of the Epworth
Leagues of Canada, arrived last night on
a special train with 170 Canadians, includ
ing his wife. He stopped over Sunday at
Salt Lake City, but- claims to have -left
there on the first special Epworth League
train Sunday night -at 13 o'clock.
Resolved. With the consent or the Mayor
that our surplus be applied to the cost of il
lumination of the City Hall dome and ferry
depot - tower, and that the Treasurer be au
thorized to make such payment.- - '
The action of the Presidential commit
tee was received with intense satisfaction
by Chairman Thomas Fllben of the Ep
worth League committee last night. "It
was* a' generous' act," -he said, "and will
do us. a world of good. The contributions
to our fund, although generous in some
quarters, were not as munificent as we
expected they would be. Still we have no
complaints ,to make. -:Wje: T wi.ll, get ? along
somehow, and -with'.this. addition to .our
fund we expect to keep bur heads above

Whereas, â¢ The Mayor recommends that the
surplus be used for the illumination of the

League. and Shooting Festival, as well as the
illumfnation of the ferry depot: and

Numerous trains arrived last night, but
the majority of those which were to ar
rive yesterday will not come in until to
day. About 10,000 delegates are still on
the road, wondering, no doubt, when the
sight of the placid Pacific jtvill gladden
their eyes. When the echoes of the con
vention have died away President Hays
of the Southern Pacific will seek to lo
cate the responsibility for the apparent
bungling in the handling of this passen

would have been deemed a crime that

The Epworth League Convention com
mittee makes the following official concert
announcement to the public:
Thousands Fail to Enter.
The sale of patron's badges began yes
terday with satisfactory results. Persons
with these badges will be admitted to all
meetings of the convention. The price of
the badges is $1. This sum Is charged in
order to swell the. entertainment rund,
which is still short of the requirements.

Chinese girls under the Woman's Foreign
Missionary Society at $12 Washington
street will occur to-day at 2 p. in. Bishop
Hamilton will preside. Bishop I. \v.
Joyce, Dr. J. M. Buckley and others have
been invited to participate | in the exer
cises. All interested will be welcome.
The receipts of the concert amounted to
about $5000. This sum will be turned over
to the finance committee to help defray
the convention expenses. ' :
voices, the grand organ, the manipulators
of the keys, whose reputation for skill is
unequaled in the West, and the fact that
an audience of more than 8000 persons
would be present, served to attract one or
the largest and most brilliant assemblages
ever seen in this city. The programme as
published was rendered in its entirety and
in a manner that reflects the highest
credit upon, the music committee.
As was anticipated, there was a crush
at the Larkin-street entrance long before
8 o'clock, at which hour the programme
was to begin. Owing to the. facts that
the entire house had been sold out and
that thousands of tickets of general ad
mission had been disposed of some con
fusion resulted at the doors, particularly
after the announcement that only those
holding reserved seats would be admitted.
Many were not aware of this, and when.
tickets of general admission were present
ed the holders were turned back with the
information that the tickets would be
honored next Saturdav. Numerous com
plaints were heard, but the vexation ex
pressed was only momentary. Thou
sands returned to their homes with
smiling faces, resolved to be on hand at
an early hour on the date specified.
A squad of twenty-five policemen led by
Lieutenant Blrdsall managed the crowd
in admirable fashion. ' Captain â¢'Wittman
arrived later and ,took command. The
crush for a time was enormous, but when
the side entrances were opened, shortly
after 8 o'clock, the congestion was appre
ciably relieved.
1 The ushers did excellent work in seat
ing the vast audience. The was little if
any confusion, the arrangements for pre
venting such having been faithfully car
ried out. The chorus, ranged in seats
which ascended far above the gallery
floor, presented a spectacle which, for
color and brightness must linger long ln
the memory of all who were present. The
audience was a representative one in
every respect. '-;"â¢". -

The assassin Iba is described as a man
51 years of age. He was originally a
follower of the Tohugawa dynasty and
was skilled in the art of fencing. He
founded two schools after the reforma
tion of the Melji era and has taken an
active part in educational work among
young people. In 1892, he and others pro
moted the Japan Savings Bank in Tokio,
of which institution he was elected presi
dent.
The wounds sustained by Mr. Hoshi
were so serious that he fell dead without
uttering a word. The body was sent in
a carriage to his house in Akasaka after
an Informal inquest. The assassin was
taken to the Metropolitan Police Bureau,
wh'ch stands close to the City Hall. He
told the police authorities in a quiet com
posed manner that he had been watching
for a chance to kill Mr. Hoshi. as he had
resolved to sacrifice his property and his
love for his wife and family In order to
strike the man. He gave as a reason
that it was necessary to strike a blow
In the interest of sound education. He
was bleeding freely from the forehead
when arrested.
The wounds received by Mr. Hoshi were
five in all. All were deep and mortal.
From accounts published In the Japan
ese papers it seems that Mr. Hoshi had
been attending a meeting of the Alder
men. The meeting was held in private
and the discussion was concluded at
about 3 ' o'clock. Mr. Hoshi and the
Mayor were having a social . chat when
the assassin entered the room. The man
was well dressed. He gave his name and
said he -was a member of the Educational
Committee of Totsuya Ku. No one sus
pected that he was bent upon murder and
consequently little attention was paid to
him. He walked behind Mr. Hoshi and
drew a dagger, instantly plunging It Into
Mr. Hoshi's right side, penetrating the
lung. The assassin dealt the blow before
Mr. Hoshi could offer any resistance.
Mr. Hlrago, clerk of the City Assembly,
was the first to see what had taken place,
and he at once sprang upon the assassin
and held him. The others in the room
then helped to secure Sotaro, which they
succeeded in doing after a struggle. The
police authorities arriving on the scene
shortly afterward, he was taken Into
custody.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 16.â Details were
received by the Empress of India to-day
of the assassination of Hoshi Toru, the
Japanese statesman, in the City Hall of
Tokio. : He was stabbed to death by a
fencer named Iba Sotaro. There appears
to have been no desire on the part of
tho assassin to .hide the motive for his
act. The murderer is a man of influence
and high alms and apparently has been
a well-to-do citizen.

FIFTEEN" FREIGHT CARS
WRECKED ON SANTA FE
Hot Box Causes Disaster to a Train
and Starts a Grain
Fire.
VISALIA, July 16.â A disastrous smash
up occurred at Le Grande, eighty-two
miles north of this city, Sunday night at
6:15 o'clock. A north-bound Santa Fe
freight train was wrecked and fifteen
loaded freight cars were piled into a
shapeless , mass. The train contained
about sixty cars. The accident was caused
by a hot box, which had become so heated
that when the air brakes "were applied
the end of the axle was twisted off. The
train was going about fifty miles an hour.
The wreckage was a sight to behold.
Rubber-tired buggies, bicycles, eggs, pelts,
crackers, cheese, groceries, canned goods,
etc, were crushed into a conglomerate
mass. When the hot box was torn from
its gearing it fell Into a ripened grain

AT PROSTRATE VICTIM
UKIAH. July 16.â Two stages that left
this city at 2 o'clock this afternoon wete
held up by a lone highwayman between
here and Lakeport and the passengers
robbed of their money. One stage, driven
by Burt Bucknell. was bound for Blue
Lakes, Laurel ; Dell. Saratoga and Upper
Lake, while the other, driven by Ray
mond Hill, was en route to Potter Valley.
The two were close together, going in the
same direction, when at a point about one
mile beyond a wayside saloon called Fort
Brown, at'a turn of the road on an up
grade, the disguised highwayman sud
denly stepped out, presented a revolver
and ordered the drivers to stop. They
obeyed and the passengers, twenty in
number, were ordered to get out and line
up. Then they were commanded to throw
their purses on the ground and turn their
pockets out. No resistance was offered.
The passengers were outing tourists, on
their way to surrounding resorts. The
highwayman was a jolly fellow and had
considerable fun with his victims while
they were engaged in emptying their
pockets. About $400 was deposited in a
heap at the roadside before the drivers
were ordered to whip up. The passengers
were warned that if they valued their
personal safety they should refrain from
looking back. The stages then proceeded
to their destinations.
One of the passengers, who had $200 in
gold in his pocket, dropped the coin in the
road while the attention of the robber was
distracted and covered it with dust. He
went to Potter and then returned, and is
now hunting for this money.
As soon as news of the robbery reached
here Sheriff Smith left this city in pursuit
of the highwayman. The scene of the
robbery Is a deep canyon heavily wooded
and broken. It affords excellent oppor
tunities for the escape of the bandit.
Sheriff Smith and Deputy Archie Lav
ton returned late to-night from the scene
of the hold-up. No clew has been discov
ered, nor have the officers obtained any
description that will aid them in their in
vestigation. A few half dollars were
found on the road where the Blue Lakes
stage was stopped, evidently having been
dropped by the passengers as they were
waiting to be relieved of their coin. Dep
uty Sheriff Ornbaum is still on the ground.

a negress companion in a dying condition
at 1 o'clock yesterday morning. She
passed away soon afterward, despite the
effort of physicians to restore her. To
day a Coroner's jury returned a verdict
that the woman came to her death from
the effects of poison administered by per
sons unknown.
Back of this tragedy there is a mystery
that promises to develop one of the great
est criminal sensations of the decade in
this State. Officials who are investigating
the case are working on the theory that
the woman wxs murdered because she
possessed knowledge that would have cent
to the gallows the perpetrators of an
other crime that was committed in this
city in 1898.
Three years ago a baker named Christ
suddenly disappeared. It was said that
he Â¦was last seen in the company of some
rounders along Barbary Coast. Christ had
considerable money on his person and
sauntered into a low resort, where he was
robbed after a dose of chloral hydrate had
been administered to him in a glass of
beer. The body was said to have been
wrapped in a blanket and interred in a
field west of the depot.
Recently a quarrel arose in this saloon
find tome one openly charged that Christ
had been murdered in The place. Kate de
"Witt remarked that she knew who killed
the baker and threatened to expose the
murderers. .
That threat was the woman's death sen
tence. Two days later she was poisoned.
The officers believe that when they learn
who administered the fatal drug to Kate
de Witt they will have found the murder
ers of Baker Christ.
When Kate de Witt left her home Sun
day evening ani went to a saloon uptown
she â¢was in the best of spirits. She was
gone about an hour and was accompanied
home by two raen. She was found dying
two hours after they left her.
The stomach of the murdered woman
has been sent to a chemist in San Fran
cisco for analysis. The body was taken
to Gilroy for interment, the woman hav
ing relatives there whom she supported.
It is believed arsenic was the poison used.

sisters, one a bookkeeper at Santa Cruz
and the other a school teacher somewhere
near that city.
SAJCTA BARBARA, July 16.â Sheriff
Nat Stewart of this county and
Constable Blosser arrived from
San Luis Obispo this morning with
William Kelso in custody. They
feared an attempt might be made by the
enraged populace to take him from them
while passing through the Santa Maria
Valley and he was concealed under twenty
drummers' trunks in the baggage car.
However, there was no demonstration.
In an interview with Kelso this after
noon he said that he had not seen the ac
counts of the crime with which he was
charged. He declared that he left
Santa Maria on July 3, the day
before Harry Blochman was mur
dered, and that he was scarcely ac
quainted with the boy. He admitted that
he knew Harry Blochman by sight. Kelso
said he had been working at Santa Maria
two days, but could give no reason for
having left so soon. He said that he left
that place at about 6 o'clock in the even
ing; but Kincaid, his companion, who is
confined there, says that he could not
have departed that early. Both had been
drinking and Kelso was intoxicated early
in the evening, but later became sober
again. Kelso says Harry Blochman did
not give him 50 cents on the evening of
July 3, but witnesses will swear that he
did.

DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-BOOT.
Your Kidneys,
Unhealthy Kidneys Make Impure Blood.
All the blood In your body passes through
your kidneys once every three minutes.
fThe kidneys are your
blood purifiers, they fil-
ter out the waste or
impurities in the blood.
If they are sick or out
of order, they fail to do
their work. \
Pains, aches and rheu-
matism come from ex-
cess of uric add in tho
blood, due to neglected
kidney trouble.
Kidney trouble causes quick or unsteady
heart beats, and makes one feel as though
they had heart trouble, because the heart is
over-working in pumping thick, kidney-
poisoned blood through veins and arteries.
It used to be considered that only urinary
troubles were to be traced to the kidneys,
but now modern science proves that nearly
all constitutional diseases have their begin-
ning in kidney trouble.
If you are sick you can make no mistake
by first doctoring your kidneys. The mild
and the extraordinary effect of Dr. Kilmer's

The conditions were favorable for good

ranges. When the fog cleared in the

In the place knew that It would be a busy
day. Tbe cro*vd that sizrg-ed. round the

Cracks Shy at Shooting.
The second day of shooting was an in
crease on the first. 'Zh.& third day
doubled tbe Incremental value of the
second. And so It will gro itntil the close
of the fest. Enough lead was splattered
on targets yesterday to kill off an army
corps or two. Some of the shots fired
went to good advantage; others were
wasted, not upon the desert air, but on
the white places of the target The
crack shots, those men whose chests are
double lined with medals of every de
scription and character, looked askance
at the 200-yard objective points of peace
ful war. They literally shied at shooting.
When the Rhine wine warms their blood
and stiffens their nerves they will v/alk
Into the glass cases and shoot for the
honorary prizes, which a thankful com
munity has liberally provided. This will
be any day now, for the Schuetzen fest
has got into their veins. That means
that they must shoot.
â¢ Festival Is a Success.
Until yesterday there was some doubt
about the success or non-success of this
festival There is no question of it now,
for the third day's puffing and smoking
of puns In their continuous rattle was a
positive indication of a happy and suc
cessful termination of this national shoot
ing carnival. The ticket sellers were kept
busy and the shooting secretaries re
eharpened their pencils more than once
as they jotted down the scores of the
ambitious. i
Not until the afternoon the ranges
really crowded. When thÂ« matutinal aspi
rants took to the long lunch tables scat
tered through the park an hour's cessa
tion from noise and explosive tumult was
installed. Then- the gay New York con
tingent was missed. Toasts with the good
Rhine wine were not lacking, nor were
the national songs, but the tall, familiar
figure of Captain Webur and his general
band of happy marksmen, like the pro
verbial school boy on a vacation, were not
to bo found. All of them have gone sight
seeing through the State. Del Monte,
Catalina and Coronado will be visited in
turn and then they will return to take
part in the shooting on Saturday.
Hardly, has the third national shooting
festival settled into the routine of its
dally course when on every side one hears
talk about the fourth. Colorado wants it,
bo does Milwaukee, and both are fighting
for It. The Denver advocates shout for
their city, claiming that it Is centrally lo
cated and far better situated for such af
fairs. "Not so," asseverate the Milwaukee
visitors, and besides that they Bay in
the next breath: "Look at our breweries."
Bets are being laid on the result of the
fight.
Afternoon's the Thing.
Quite a few visitors dropped into the
park in the afternoon. The life of the fes
tival is a negative quantity in the fore
noon, but when the sun has taken Its
westward incline the guests come in from "
every side and make the best of an im
promptu picnic. The music In the pavil
ion and in the track stand draws quite an
audience. It is a different kind from the
harmony and melody of the rifle ball, but
just as popular Tslth the ladies. The favcr
ite place for promenade and loitering is on
the platform back of the shooting boxes.
Here the great, free and frolicsome life
of the national shooter goes on. The
crowd has caught the spiritâ the ' Rhine
wine spirit.' That in itself augurs succees.
Some time during the afternoon William
-Wolff , H. G. Lally and W. J." Davis of
this city visited the grounds. They tried
the ranges for a few shots, but soon sur
rendered to marksmen more experienced
and more skillful. They then found
themselves at the table fixtures on the
platform. The bottles popped and the
crowd grew . one by one as the toasts
grew longer and thicker in number.
â¢ â¢ ;- - Shooting Moderately Good.
The shooting was not of such high
caliber yesterday as on the preceding
day. There were no Henderson or
Schmld ' performances, and" none of the
very big 1 men stepped to the ranges for
registration, but any number of moder
ately good shots blazed axvay at tho tar
gets, scoring fair averages. William
Hayes, king of his republican country,
'was again on the scene. He was busy
with his cartridges and his guns, but he
did not shoot. He, too, is working himÂ»
self into the spirit, and one of these fine
days will be found in the ranges punch

DENVER, July. 16:â The ministers of

considerationâ looking to the uplifting of
the entire community, i Â¦ They propose to
establish an organization of power as far

shot at while driving to a Cabi

the carriage. Her grievance was based
upon the fact that In 1S9G her husband.
Count Olzewsky. was inveigled in Xice

"The interest displayed by the Pope in

"I have been myself in many countries

"So far as the Philippines are concerned,
there are many problems, including the
disposition of church. property, which the
Holy See is anxious to have solved on the

Notable' Fourth of July
Celebration Held at

Filipinos Crowding Into Mi
kado's Empire for
Education.
YOKOHAMA, July 5 (via" Victoria, B.
C). July 16.â American Btock is booming
In Japan at an unprecedented rate. The
celebration of the Fourth of July yester
day transformed Yokohama into a veri
table American town and the scene at
noon, when the warships in the harbor
joined in the salute, responding to tho
shore festivities, was a most inspiring
one. The day closed with an exhibition
of fireworks.
The honors to be paid on the expected
arrival of General MacArthur from the
Philippines will at least equal those re
cently accorded to ?Field Marshal von
Waldersee, and everything possible will
be done to testify to the â¢ genuine respect
and affection In which the empire holds
the American republic.
A potable feature of the time Is the in
flux of Filipinos, who are now arriving in
large and. increasing numbers. They are
mostly of. the better class and seem to bo
coming for the educational advantages
which Japan affords. Already they are
winning high praise for their general good
behavior and their eagerness to learn.
Another sign of the times is the move
ment on foot for the general teaching of
the Russian language in the empire. It is
felt that events are rapidly shaping them
selves to bring Russia into closer con
tact with all national and commercial re
lations here, it being recognized that th6
northern power is to be the most impor
tant factor in Oriental politics and trade.
The growth of the JIji Shimpo, the lead
ing journal of the metropolis, well illus
trates how thoroughly Western and espe
cially American. ideas are dominating the
country. The special "editions of the pa
per on important occasions and holidays
rival in size and in special features the
leading Journals of New York. The lat
est enterprise inaugurated by it is the
adoption of the "fresh air fund" move
ment, and large numbers of children from
the streets of the capital are now being
sent into -the country for outings of a
week or more. The movement is attract
ing much attention .and will doubtless be
emulated by. many . other . metropolitan
journals. , -
The financial- situation Is slowly 1 but
steadily improving, the altered aspect of
Chinese affairs being " felt and political
matters at home being unusually quiet

One of the oddest spectacles In the
transrortation business Is the sight of an
electric car running two miles or more a
minute on a one-rail track. Even if it ap
peared feasible, on a casual examination
one would say that it was about the most
dangerous form of traveling that could be
devised. But the truth is the exact re
verse, judging by the records of the three
mono-railroads which are in existence.
There is one in Ireland, another In France,
and a third in Belgium, and it Is proposed
now to build one in England to run be
tween Manchester. and Liverpool, thirty
four and one-half miles, which distance,
it is said by the projectors of the scheme,
can bo covered in eighteen minutes.^
The. line in Ireland, from Listoweli to
Ballybunnion, ten miles, has been run
ning thirteen years, and the company
proudly points to the fact that in that time
there has not been a single accident on
the road: The cs.rs~and the engine are
suspended from a single steel rail, which
rises "about three feet from the ground.
The center of gravity of the cars Is be
low the rail, which takes away the possi
bility of the trains leaving the track.
SWIFT ELECTRIC CARS.
The Senator's exact statement on the subject is
thus reported by the Boston Herald: "I think we
should go very slowly in binding the country irre
vocably in such matters by treaties. We find it neces
sary to revise our tariffs every few years ;_ but a
tariff made by a treaty can never be repealed without
breaking our faith, and can never be revised without
the consent of a foreign country and a two-thirds vote
Despite all the efforts of the free traders to break
down the protective system by reciprocity treaties,
there is good reason for believing that a majority in
the Senate will vote against the treaties when they
come up for final consideration. In addition to, the
generally urged objection to them there is another
which Senator Hoar has recently stated â that such
treaties would take tariff questions out of the hands
of the House of Representatives, where of right they
should be, and would place them in the domain of
diplomacy, and thus subject them to foreign in
fluences. .
The club accurately states the Republican position
on the subject of reciprocity and accepts it as its own
by adopting a resolution declaring: "That in ad
hering to the principle of reciprocity as originally
formulated in the Republican platform of 1900, we
favor the associated policy of reciprocity so directed
as to open our markets on favorable terms for Â¦ what
we do not ourselves produce, in return for free for
eign markets." ... â¢./;.â¢-,?
SINCE so many efforts have been made to align
the manufacturing interests of the country on
the side of the various reciprocity treaties ne
gotiated by Mr. Kasson, and which bear so injuriously
upon California, it is gratifying to note that the Phila
delphia Manufacturers' Club has ' declared against
them. Evidence is thus given that the manufacturers
of that city at any rate understand that protection in
this country must be made fair to all industries. It
was not designed for manufacturers only.
THE RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
There they have remained ever since
and are growing rapidly. They seem to
take kindly to the innovation, and at the
first sign of danger they all retreat to the
duster, nestling among the feathers.
The problem was solved by the boy. who
suggested that the hen be killed and the
big feather duster be substituted for the
hen. The duster was suspended just above
the floor in the corner of the kitchen and
the chickens placed under it in a box.
The chickens were hatched about three
weeks ago, their mother being an old hen
which the family had bought in market
and had intended to fatten and eat. Be
fore she arrived at the proper condition
to be baked she took a notion to sit. As
is usual in such cases, persuasion was
vain', and she held to her determination
to raise a family. A dozen eggs were
given her and she hatched out eight
chicks. Of these she was very proud.
About two weeks ago a number of friends
from out of town visited the family unex
pectedly. The problem of what to have
for dinner was a serious one, as -it was
Sunday and no groceries were open. It
was suggested that the hen be k killed, but
the children were not willing that the
chickens should be left to shift for them
selves at so tender an age.
Seven fluffy little chickens belonging to
a family living on Twelfth street, near
Broadway, Louisville, have a queer
mother. For the past two weeks the only
protection they have had has been a big
feather duster. The substitute for the
mother has served its purpose so well that
the family expects to raise chickens in
the same way every year.
OLD FOSTER PARENT.
Even under the best conditions of weather from
this time on, however, it will not be possible for the
corn States to wholly recover from the effects of the
long drought and blighting heat. It has been an
nounced that many farmers when they saw their corn
withering in the fields sold their hogs and cattle for
fear they would not be able to feed them. Such losses
cannot be made up by the coming of good rains.
Fortunately the wheat crops were ripened before the
heated wave" came upon the fields. From that and
other cereals the farmers may possibly get something
of a compensation for the losses on their corn.
Some of the railways in the Mississippi Valley are
largely dependent upon the corn crop for their fall
business, and accordingly when it was feared that
nearly the whole crop would be blighted by the heat
the value of the stocks of those roads fell in Wall
street, as it was doubted whether they would be able
to pay dividends this fall. Such fears are now likely
to pass away, or at least to be greatly diminished.
The benefits, of course, reach much further than the
farmers. Corn is one of the most important crops
grown in the country. A recent authority states that
it averages a total yearly farm value double that of
wheat or cotton, and more than double that of oats,
rye, barley and buckwheat put together. It far ex
ceeds in aggregate value even the hay cropland, like
hay, it forms a principal source of support for the ani
mal food of the nation, aside from entering directly
into a large popular consumption.
GRATIFYING reports come from Kansas of
rains in various parts of the State." The
Weather Bureau at Washington estimates
that the worst of the hot spell is over for all parts of
the Mississippi Valley, and that while no general rain
is to be expected, yet thunderstorms will probably
bring cooling and >, refreshing showers throughout
Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois and In
diana. The showers will materially benefit the corn
crops, which were threatened by the drought, and will
doubtless save the farmers from much of the heavy
I6ss they had begun to fear.

In comparison with the greater international ques
tions with which Mr. Hay has had to deal this of the
Turkish claims is but a small matter. It nevertheless
affords another proof of his masterly ability in hand
ling diplomatic affairs. He has succeeded where many
before him failed, and some of the greatest Foreign
Ministers in Europe would be glad if they could be
equally effective in dealing with the Turk.
The work of bringing the Sultan to a payment of
the claims has been under way for more than ten
years. Since it began several Ministers have served
this country at Constantinople, but, though each was
zealous in the task, little or nothing was accom
plished beyond collecting evidence to support the
claims and obtaining from the Sultan's Government
some more or less serious consideration of them. Ac
cordingly when Secretary Hay entered the State De
partment it was not expected that he would be able
to achieve more than his predecessors. Many people
believed that we, like the nations of Europe, would
have our Turkish claims as an everlasting possession.
It is therefore a striking proof of Mr. Hay's diplo
matic firmness and tact that, with the assistance of
the present American Minister at Constantinople,
Mr. Leishman, the Sultan has been brought not only
to consent to pay the indemnity but to actually pay
it. The full sum of $95,000 has been paid over to the
American Minister, and drafts for it have been re
ceived at Washington.
When Secretary Hay undertook to recover from
the Sultan the amounts due to injured Americans he
had a difficult task upon his hands. The Sultan has
had long experience in evading payments of all kinds.
Nearly every diplomatist of high rank in Europe has
a.t one time or another been engaged in the task of
getting a financial settlement with the Turkish Gov
ernment. Most of these claims are still unpaid, and
consequently in seeking for the .payments due us our
Government had to deal not only with the evasive
ness of the Turk but with the jealousies of European
Governments who wished their own claims paid first.
It is natural that men should pay more attention to
matters of strife than of peace, and have mqre to say
about a nun who talks of war than of one who goes
quietly to work and accomplishes his ends by peace
ful means; t>ut none the less the peaceful victories are
far more useful to a nation than strife, and the mÂ«in
who achieves them deserves credit for his work.
SO long as the Sultan of Turkey evaded all
claims made upon his Government by the
United States for indemnity for losses suffered
by Americans at the time of the outrages in Armenia
there was a good deal of attention paid to the subject
and public interest in it was keen. In fact, at one
time when an American warship sailed for the
Mediterranean it was rumored that the object was to
compel the Sultan's compliance by a display of force.
Lately there has been very little said about the sub
ject, and now that the announcement comes that the
Sultan has paid the $95,000 which our Government
asked it is treated as a matter of course.
THE SULTAN PAYS UP.
BUMMER AND LAZARUS-H. S., Ala
meda, Cal. "Bummer" and . "Lazarus"
were two dogs that were famous In the
sixties In San Francisco. The first named
followed Ned Knight, one of the old-time
reporters on the Alta California, from
Petaluma to this city. He was a cros3
between a Scotch terrier, black and tan.
and a Japanese snub-nosed poodle, with
coat like a moth-eaten fur and one ear
cropped shorter than the other. He
proved to be a famous ratter, and be
came, despite his homeliness, a favorite
around the markets on Clay street. For
want of a better name he was called
"Bummer." He became everybody's
friend and everybody became "his friend.
Some time after ,his appearance he was
joined by a mongrel dog, part hound, part
terrier, and the two- were always to
gether, they having formed a ' sort of
Pythian friendship. They visited the
lunch counters for food, also the markets,
and whenever there was an occasion both
were in it for rats. OnÂ© day Bummer
came to a saloon for his usual meal, but
it was noticed that Lazarus, the other
dog, was not with him, and that instead
of eating what was given him he carried
It away. This he did for several days, so
he .was followed and it ; was discovered
that Lazarus was sick in a crockery crate
and that Bummer was nursing and feed-
Ing him. This was written up at length
by the reporters of the day and attracted
the attention of every one in the city.
Kvery one knew Bummer and Lazarus.
One day the poundkeeper scooped In Laz
arus, and that act aroused so much in
dignation that a citizen paid the amount
required to release him, and then the Su
pervisors on petition gave the two dogs
the freedom of the city and immunity
from arrest by the poundkeeper during
life.. One day some heartless individual
poisoned Lazarus. . Bummer became dis
consolate and moped, seeming to care not
how soon the end came. A few months
after Lazarus went to dogland Bummer
was kicked by â¢a drunken ruffian and he
died In- a few days from the effects of the
brutal kicking. The offender was arrest
ed and fined $20. The skins of both do-s
were stuffed and are still preserved as
relics of bygonÂ» daira. v " veu **

PERSONAL MENTION. 5
ONE of the most remarkable railroad crossings In the
world is that just outside the Newcastle-on-Tyne Cen
tral Railway station, England, pictured In the illus
tration here reproduced from the Scientific American.
On a day when the regular schedule Is being followed
1135 trains pass over this extraordinary network of railways,
which is used by the passenger, mineral and general freight
trains. Of this total 675 trains pass over the High Level
bridge, the tracks which lead to this bridge being those on the
extreme left of the picture. The remaining 460 trains pass to and
from the district on the east side of the station. The switches
are worked from the signal box, shown on the extreme right
of the picture, which contains 224 levers. It is operated by a
staff of signalmen, worked in three shifts of eight men to each
shift , working eight hours at a stretch. The crossing is spanned
by a signal bridge which Is 155 feet in length, and there Is ona
man for each shift stationed on this bridge. At the end of
the station represented in the picture there are ten platforms.

There is of course no need at the national capital
for another memorial of Washington. The city bears
his name, high above all its buildings towers a
mighty monument raised to commemorate his fame,
and not far distant the beautiful estate of Mount Ver
non, which was his home and is his resting-place in
death, is carefully preserved by the nation. .What is
now undertaken, therefore, is not designed as a
memorial so much as an institution to carry out his
express desires for the promotion of higher education.
The Washington Academy of Sciences has procured
the passage of a law by Congress providing for the
use of all the resources of the great departments of
the Government for research and study by all stu
dents and investigators under such conditions as* the
heads of the departments may specify. The faculty
of the Washington memorial will aid in directing
students how best to profit by the advantages offered.
"'"â¢Tife, Memorial Association has members in every
State in the Union, the aggregate ; being upward of
1500. It has already accumulated a considerable.^und
and is now appealing for more. Doubtless Congress
will be asked to make an appropriation if ample
voluntary subscriptions are not forthcoming, so it
seems fairly well assured that the institution will ere
long be established and in operation.
In the appeal issued by the committee the purposed
institution is thus described: "The George Wash
ington Memorial Association has undertaken to
carry out' its purpose by securing a site and erecting
thereon in Washington a substantial, dignified, useful
memorial building, sacred to the memory of Washing
ton and dedicated to higher education, science and lit
erature. Such building will form the permanent home
of the Washington Memorial Institution, the 4 Na
tional Academy of Sciences, with its affiliated societies,
and of the George Washington Memorial Association.
It will serve as the meeting-place and headquarters
of the scientific, literary, educational and patriotic
bodies which meet from time to time in Washington.
For- this purpose it must needs be of ample propor
tions, solidly built, with large auditorium, small halls
and numerous offices."
AFTER long deliberation the committee ap
pointed to devise ways and means for bring
ing about the establishment of an educational
institution at Washington on the lines suggested by
Washington himself has submitted a plan and has
appealed to the country to support it. The institution
is not to be a university, as it was deemed inexpe
dient to provide another institution of that sort in
the immediate neighborhood of those of Baltimore,

THE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL.
MORE THAN A THOUSAND TRAINS
GO OVER THE CROSSING DAILY
With such .reports coming from centers where it
was believed the reciprocity treaties would find their
strongest support, it seems we may conclude that the
treaties are virtually beaten. When first the fight
against them began it looked as if California would
have to battle alone, but the longer the subject was
studied the more widespread became the opposition
and the weaker became the support. At present pub
lic sentiment is against them, and even those who be
lieve that their ratification by the Senate would be
favorable to our trade may still be inclined to oppose
them on the very valid grounds given by Senator
Hoar.
of theSenate. Such a, measure -takes t the tariff out of
the hands of the House of Representatives. : It is true
that a treaty" may be made conditional to the assent of
the House, but. one House can never bind the hands
of another. Mr. Webster was charged with a purpose
of making a tariff by treaty. He replied With great
indignation/ L T hope I know the constitution better.'
The. simpler, and easier way to do this thing is by
concurrent legislation." . -..-... , â¢
It is interesting, however, to observe that' Mr.
Bryan proposes to bolt. His clans have gathered in
Ohio and will meet in convention to nominate a rival
ticket This is too, too interesting. After calling the
Gold Democrats bolters and warning them never to
come back any more, he now proposes to bolt a regu
lar party convention and fight its ticket and platform.,
The country will look on with some interest and more
amusement.
Mr. Champ Clark thinks the issues of 1904 will be
made by the issuers of 1896 and 1900. We hope so.
They have bungled two jobs, and can more easily
bungle a third by reason of their experience in
bungling.
Turn Clubfoot loose on his own hams. The Repub
lican party will furnish the sapling.
In Solano County, California, there roamed for
years a celebrated grizzly bear, called Clubfoot, be
cause of an injury to one of his feet caused by being
caught in a bear trap, from which he tore himself
loose. After this trying experience he lived and fed
on young pigs and lambs for a score of years, his
depredations being always fastened upon him by the
track left by his club foot. Finally, one day old
Clubfoot was roaming at will in the mountains above
Vaca' Valley,* and stopped to* scratch himself on a
pine sapling, after the fashion of Highlanders. He was
long and the sapling was small, and bending around
it his hind quarters were brought to view. Thinking
them the buttocks of- a rival bear he immediately bit
them; feeling the bite he thought the other bear was
biting him, and thereupon proceeded to chew him
self off down to his ears, and when he was found he
had his head in his own mouth. This seems to be the
programme laid out for the Democracy by Clubfoot
Bryan. He is at present biting his own buttocks and
thinks it is the Gold Democrats! In 1904 he will be
found with his little head in his big mouth, dead,' in
the belief that he was biting another bear.
Major Watterson hails the Buckeye buck with
effusion and informs Mr. Bryan that the men in the
trenches are tired of sucking empty eggshells, and
that the revolt is on and only a fool will*try to stand
in the way. But Mr. Bryan does not propose to sub
mit to the will of the party, in Ohio or elsewhere, to
play the barrow pig in politics. In an interview in
St. Louis he says: "It is a case of gold bugs trying
to administer absent treatment to the Democracy of
the nation." To which brilliant and indeed peerless
observation Champ Clark added: "And it is also
a case of the tail trying to wag the dog, a feat that
was never yet accomplished, and, mark me, will not
be this time. I do not know what the issues of 1904
will be, but I do know who the issuers will be. They
will be the men who were faithful to the party in 1896
and 1900."
The Dervishes looked vainly along the ranks of
great meu from the dawn of history to these days for
one fit to compare with Bryan, and failed.- To their
distorted vision he' was the foremost man of ajl time,
"the peerless one," one fool called him." In no State
was this craze more acute than in Ohio. . Jones,
Mayor of Toledo, a communist, and Monett, a Re
publican and cx-Attonvey General of the State, led
the choir there, and it looked and sounded as if Bryan
would walk off , with McKinley's State. From
Kelly's Island to Walnut Hills, from Cuyahoga to
Hamilton, from the Maumee to the Scioto, the wor
shipful Democracy bent the knee to the lonesome and
peerless person, and put up the money to pay him for
speeches from his car tail. Sam Medary and Tom
Corwin, "Backbone" Todd and John Brough, never
saw such a yesty ferment in Ohio politics even in the
brave days when Buckeye was an October State.
Ohio pulpits even rang with pious approval of the
prophet, ster and revelator from the Platte, and he
was served up, with texts, like liver with bacon on
the side.
This was only so little while ago that a wise child
born then does not yet know its own father, and. yet
Ohio has forgotten the object of its adoration.
Where there was harvest heat how is the icy tempera
ture of cold storage. When Bryan's picture was car
ried into the convention it was trampled under foot
The silver question and the whole round of issues
raised by the Chicago and Kansas City conventions
were ignored. Communism was purged out of the
platform, and the Republican principles of sound
money and anti-silvcrism, good public credit and
scientific finance, were either directly indorsed or ac
cepted by refusal to reject them.
As usual, the Democracy camped on the Republi
can trail five years after the issue was decided.
TO one who saw the idolatry, the Bryanolatry, of
the Chicago, convention the sudden reversal in
the Ohio Democratic convention is of keen in
terest. In 1896 the crude and unmasticated ; political,
theories of. Mr. Bryan were swallowed without a wink
and he was set upon a pedestal for the adoration of
his party.' The brains of the Democracy suddenly
flowed but of its skull and left a'body swinging arms
and a head making snoots and howling.

Private Joe Catanya of the hospital corps
deserves a special vote of thanks from the
regiment for faithful service in the medical
department. While other cadets are roaming
through the county in search of fun. Catanya
stays at bis post caring for the lads who have
made themselves temporarily Blck by over
eating. Other members of the hospital corps
are doing splendid work, but Catanya is notice
able In this aggregation. The health of the
camp Is remarkable. Very few boys are 111.
Dr. Morrisey and the embryo doctors, Doyle,
O'Dea and Meagher, are watching over them.
At Elck call each morning the cadet who wants
to shirk guard duty or drill and the lad who
believes the watermelon he ate is disagreeing
with him, or the youngster who has a sliver
in his paw stands before the tent and receives
medicine and advice. The hospital tents are
situated a distance from camp, beneath a group
of shade trees.
Archibald Fitzsimmons and Ernest Doling of

morrow morninff and play for their hosts.
This morning a flre call startled the regi
ment- The Etirrinr strains were blown by the
bugler on duty at the guardhouse, and within
a few minute* half the regiment wan "hot
foot" across the fields to a grass flre that en
dangered a house on a hill. The cadets
charged up- the embankment, vaulted fences,
ducked under barbed-wire and then, without
forming line, charged up the hill as did the
boys in blue at San Juan. They fought their
first battle in brave fashion. The fire king
had to retreat under their heavy assault of wet
sacke. and after fifteen minutes' work they re
turned Jubilantly to camp. Lieutenant Colonel
McGloln and Andy J. Gaughran led the attack.-
The colonel mounted the roof of a house and
in stentorian tones directed the battle. He
waved his sword and grew husky from con
tinued yelling of commands. Gaughran de
ployed the column. He sent a force in the rear
cf the blaxe and a company in front. Andy
had his eyebrows singed, but, like- a courage
ous officer, stayed on the firing line. The resi
dents of the houses that were endangered were
profuse in their thanks to the cadets.

Norah Helen Gertrude Finnistone
O'Neill Murphy has 'at last opened a
channel that promises to lead to the hid
den wealth of her former husband, Ber
tram Samuel Joseph Finnistone O'Neill
Murphy, son of the late D. T. Murphy,
brother of Lady Wolseley, Countess Le
Gonldec and Madame Domlnguez and a
man of many alleged assumed names and
some reputation on the Continent as a
duelist, won as a defender of the honor
of the late Queen Victoria. B. S. J. F.
O'N. Murphy's financial condition was the
subject of official inquiry before Judge
Murasky yesterday. Daniel T. Murphy,
his brother, was on the stand and conr
trlbuted some interesting information.
The witness stated that there was not
in his control any money, property or se
curities which belonged to his brother
which might be applied on the $70(W ali
mony judgment held by Mrs. N. H,. G. F.
O'N. Murphy. "Sam/' the witness ex
plained, was disinherited by hia father,
but after his death an agreement was
reached by the disinherited son's mother
and the children by which property val
ued at $200,000 was set aside for his use
and benefit.
Daniel T. Murphy then explained that
his brother had made a deed of gift cov
ering .all the property in his favor in 188$,
and subsequently, In 1897, the old deed
having been lost, the same was renewed.
Frank Powers and Elliot McAllister, rep
resenting Mrs. Murphy, then intimated
that collusion, and, fraud had been prac
ticed against their client. The proceed
ing continued, however, and the witness
admitted that since his brother made the
deed in gift he had been well supplied
with money, as much as $10,000 some
years, less in others. The witness said
that very recently he sent his brother -a
remittance.
At this point an adjournment was taken
until to-day at 2 o'clock, when the exam
ination will be resumed.. Mrs. 1 Murphy's
attorneys expect to set aside the deed of
gift on the ground that no valid consid
eration for the same ever passed to B. S.
J. F. O'N. Murphy. Mrs. Murphy's at
torneys also 'expect to Bhow that since
their client secured a divorce and since
her former husband's Â¦ marriage to his
present wife, Mrs. Beryl Murphy, he has
led an extraordinary life. They expect to
show that in order to avoid service and
for other purposes he has grone by the
name of Murphy, O'Neil, Murray and
Munroe.
Murphy Is now busying himself with the
bankruptcy courts in England. His legal
opponents, however, claim that this la
but a ruse on his part to put a stop to the
present proceedings, but they assert that
this move will have but little effect on
the lnaulry at bar.

MURPHY GIVES
PROPERTY AWAY
' An investigation of sixteen days by the
Federal authorities has failed to produce
results war ranting, the arrest of the em
ploye of the Mint who stole six sacks of
gold containing $30,000.
Director of the Mint Roberts has left
the city. Superintendent Leach and Se
cret Service Agent Hazen are continuing
to probe' for evidence, yet the employe of
the. Mint who stole the money is still re
porting daily for duty and laughing at
the efforts of Leach and Hazen to place
him behind the bars.
In the two weeks in which Leach and
Hazen have conducted their investigations
they have secured a mass of testimony,
but they have no more reason to-day for
claiming that a certain employe is guilty
of the theft of the gold than they had
when they first commenced to work on
the case.
During the entire investigation suspi
cion has been directed at Chief Clerk
Walter Dimmlck, but ' that . gentleman
calmly attends to his duties and says
nothing. Among the Mint employes it is
generally stated that Leach and Hazen
have lost the opportunity of discovering
the thief of the Government gold and that
they have made a complete failure of
their would-be sleuth efforts.
While accusations of all kinds have been
hurled at the chief clerk, none of the asr
sertions have connected him with the dis
appearance of the six sacks of gold.
Proof has been forthcoming' that Dlm
mick opened pay envelopes of employes;
evidence has been given that he was
caught in the act of imitating the signa
ture of Superintendent Leach; allegations
have been made against Dimmick that he
was paying attention to a blonde widow
living in the Tenderloin; the vault com
bination of Cashier Cole has been found
in the private memorandum book kept by
Dimmick; yet no evidence has been
forthcoming to show that the chief clerk
was the man who looted the cashier's
working vault.
The count of the gold in the Mint pro
ceeded yesterday. More than $5,000,000
was counted and resacked, but no short
age was discovered. The counting of the
gold coin will probably be finished this
week.
A. prominent official of the Mint, in
speaking of the theft of the sacks of gold,
said yesterday:
"If the investigating officials had any
reason for suspecting a particular em
ploye of the Mint, it seems strange
that no definite action was taken
at once. The fact that no ar
rest has been mads makes it look
as if there is no desire on the part of the
investigating officials to make one. It is
unjust to the employes of the Mint that
this matter stands as it does to-day. If
the person suspected of the robbery had
been placed under arrest at the start it
might have been possible to secure cer
tain testimony that Is lacking now. The
employes fear to tell all they know of a
man as long as he is at liberty, but if an
arrest had been made it would be differ
ent. From what I know of the investiga
tion I believe that there will be no ar
rests."

Attorney Charles Heggerty thereupon

said he would take the matter under ad

will also be set for trial. Â«
The attorneys for Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,

The old Idea, -was that dandruff Is scales
of ekin thrown off through a feveriBh con-
dition of the scalp, is exploded. Professor
TJnna, Hamburg. Germany, European
authority on ekin diseases, says dandruff
Is a grerm disease. The germ burrows un-
der the scalp, throwing up little scales of
and sappinjr the vitality of the
Thalr at the root. The only hair prepara-

Herpiclde. "Dertroy the cause, you re-
move the effect." Not only cures dan-
druff, but stops falling hair and causes a

"WHO DID THE SHOOTING. â ~
Craven Hot Hazed at Annapolis.
WASHINGTON, July 16.-The newspa
per report from New York to the effect
that Henry Smith Craven, grandson of
the late Rear Admiral Craven, U. S. N.,
who was committed to the Bloomingdale
Asylum on Monday, had become Insane as
a result of hazing â¢ administered to him
while a student at the Annapolis Naval
Academy 13 disproved by the records in
the possession of the Navy Department.
As a matter of fact, .Craven, as shown by
the record, was never actually a student
at the academy. He was appointed to it
in 1S98, but owing to his physical condition
never entered the Institution.
ST. LOUIS, July 16. â Sensational admis
sions have been made on the stand by
Samuel A. Gaylord, senior member of the
firm of Gaylord, Blessing & Co*, which
failed recently. Gaylord, who is one of
the oldest stockbrokers here, admitted
at the hearing before Bankruptcy Referee
Coles that the firm had been practically
insolvent for two years and had been do
ing business on funds secured from local
customers.
Deals wherein no stock ever changed
hands being a mere matter of bookkeep
ing, in which the firm never forgot to
charge up commissions, margins and in
terest, were admitted by Gaylord, who
also told of the employment of relatives'
names and the use of an insane man's
name in the accounts. At the time of the*
failure they were short $150,000 in bonds,
face value, and over six thousand share3
of stock in New York.
It was admitted by the witness that the
failure was due to their speculation, by
which they had hoped to win out and pay
off their indebtedness, estimated to have
been something near $200,000. As to the
missing collateral, left with the firm by
customers, attached to promissory notes
Gaylord admitted that all had been
hypothecated with banks as security for
loans to the firm. There was no apparent
desire to conceal anything concerning the
involved transactions of the firm on Gay
lord's part and the revelations he mad*
were the more astonishing to the creditors
assembled because of the confidence and
trust for many years reposed in Gaylord.

Suit Against a Railroad Company.
BALTIMORE, Md.. July 16.â A suit in
which the Baltimore and Ohio Railway
Company is charged with violating the
interstate commerce, law by discriminat
ing against shippers was filed In the
United States'Court here to-day by Myers

per annum by reason of being compelled
to receive, house and feed their cattle at
the Union Stockyards in this city, alleg
ing that officials of the railway company

"WASHINGTON, July 16.â Secretary
Long has in hand the report of the naval
board, charged with the preparation of
plans of the naval station for the Phil
ippines, at Olongapo,- on Subig Bay. The
board has been stopped from submitting
a detailed project by reason cf the
broaching of tbe proposition to Inaugu
rate at this point the favorite project of
Secretary Long looking to a combination
of the vaiious staff bureaus in its man
agement. The board asks the Secretary
for direction in this matter. Under the
existing practice each of the four bureaus
â Naval Construction, Steam Engineering,
Equipment and Yards and Docksâmain
tains independent establishments in each
yard. Secretary Long has recommended
to Congress a consolidation of the bu
reaus in the Navy Department itself un
der one head, so as to rid the service of
the wrangling and jealousies that mar the
best plans for ship .construction.
Several preliminary questions must first
be passed on by the various bureaus of
the department before the plans for the
new station can be prepared. It is said
that even the location of the station in
Subig Bay has not yet been absolutely de

otherwise entitled to registration under Its
provisions. The board shall then Issue to the
said applicant, on his paying the sum of $2,
a certificate of registration. Any practicing
pharmacist falling to comply with the require
ments of this section within sixty days after
the 1st day of July, 1901, shall forfeit his
right to registration and shall appear for ex
amination as provided for in this act.
Entitled to Registration.
It Is under this section that the conten
tion will be urged that a man who was
registered under the old law. whether he
has paid his accrued fees or not, is en
titled to registration on his credentials
under the new act. At least one case is
known wherein Clerk Calvert has exacted
from an applicant for registration three
years back dues before issuing him a cer
tificate as a licentiate under the new law.
The druggist in this case holds the sec
retary's receipts for the three years, but
it should be stated in justice to Calvert
that he Is acting in this under the rules
of the new board. At all events, this is
but one case, although it may be made
the test case,.
"I have a large number* of the druggists
in the city behind me," said Attorney
Kingwell yesterday, "and I believe the
law will not stand. There are several
ways by which I will get into court. In
the first place, back fees have been ex
acted from some . of my clients, and I
may bring suit against the board to com
pel the restitution of those fees. Or I
may bring mandamus proceedings to com
pel the secretary of the State board to
register another of "my clients without the
payment of fees at all. There is one man
on our side, a very good man, but I pre
fer not to name him at present, who has
refused to register, claiming his right to
make a living under the constitution, and
a writ of mandamus on this contention
would bring the constitutionality of the
new law directly at issue. At all events,
I will move in the matter within the next
two days."
But greater than the hardship that Is
worked by the new law upon the full
fledged druggists is that worked by the
interpretation of the law by the State
board upon those young men who are just
from the schools and who have. been
taught, in theory at least, all that- it is
in the power of the State to teach of
pharmacy. The present Board of Phar
macy is composed of W. M. Searby of San
Francisco, who is also the dean of the
California College of Pharmacy, affiliated
with the State University; H...J. Finger
of Santa Barbara, E.' A. Baer of Bakers
field. C. H. Rowley, of Santa Barbara, K.
D. Owen of Los Angeles and J. J. Crow
ley of San Francisco. These gentlemen
are all registered pharmacists. They
have been registered by their own secre
tary, John Calvert, under the new law
and without -any examination so far as
the public is informed.
Technical Education Wasted.
As dean of the California College of
Pharmacy, Mr. Searby may be fairly as
sumed to be in a sense responsible for the
acquirements of the young men turned
out of the college as competent pharma
cists. And yet every one of those young
men who has applied for registration un
der the new law has been informed that
the State board will not recognize cre
dentials from the State Institution as suf
ficient, and that he must pay his $5 and
come up for examination before the State
board in due time.
The milk in this examination cocoanut
is that It means an assessment of $5 ex
tra levied upon every druggist in the
State and of $2 extra upon every boy in
a drug store. Now it is estimated that
there are in the State- of California 1000
druggists, employing perhaps 1000 assist
ants and as many helpers, or boys. An
assessment of Jo and $2 a head upon these,
respectively, would foot up the nandsome
sum of $25,000. In addition to this, each
druggist and each qualified clerk would
pay his $2 per year and each boy. in a
store his $1, under the law. That would
mean $5000 more, making a clean total of
$30,000. There is a provision in the new
law that the State Board of Pharmacy
shall pay its own expenses, and that the
balance, of the money in Its hands, after
paying such expenses, shall be paid to
the State Treasurer, who shall keep it as
a special fund to be used in carrying out
the provisions of the law. But there is
no provision for the regulation of. the ex
penses of the State board by any author
ity other than its own, nor for the audit
ing of its accounts by any State official
not directly connected with the board. ;

CINCINNATI, July 16.â Judge i C. D.
Clark of the United States District* Court,
during the hearing of the motion to dis
solve the temporary Injunction issued
against the striking machinists, Indi
cated very plainly to counsel for the de
fense to-day what his opinion would be
on the two points involved. He said
that for picketing an injunction would be
granted, but that acts of violence and
even boycotting were not to be met by
injunction. He said:
I have arrived at the conclusion be
yonfl all doubt that picketing Is unlawful;
that it is immoral and Â¦wrong. Counsel
for the defense must understand plainly
that I am opposed to picketing. in any
form whatever and that I will promptly
make the power of this court felt
against it." .
The Judge described picketing as inter
cepting men while going to or from the
factoryâ anywhere, . even . miles : awayâ by
one man or by more than one, and any in
terference with ' Ingress and egress of
workmen. But violence, he added, is not
to be remedied by injunction in this court.
He announced that . the decision- of the
case i would rest on. the point whether or
not it would be shown that there had been
picketing.. As his mind was made up on
picketing he asked counsel to cite authori
ties on that point.- - , ;.-. .....

DETROIT. July 16.â Ten thousand peo
ple saw Eleata, a four-year-old black
mare, bred on^the Palo Alto farm in Cali
fornia, and owned by ex-Senator Jones of
New HanripBhire, win the $10,000 Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' stake for 2:24
class tictters at the Dress Point track
this afternoon, and lower, the record for
the race from 2:10% to 2:0S%.
In the early auctions Eleata brought $11
to $200. but when the first heat was called
she was bringing $50 to 5S5. Neva Sim
mons was second choice in the betting but
could not get better than third place in
the race. ,
Another record was broken in the 2-08
trotting evenr, when The Monk forced
BoraJma to go the last heat In 2:Q7&, low
ering his mark three-quarters of a sec
ond. Fifteen hcrses answered the start
er's bell when the first heat of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' stake was
called. It was a hard field to get off.
Neva Simmons had the pole, but she
broke before the first turn and Eleata
took the- lead as riiey turned for the back
stretch and held It to the wire. Neva
Simmons took a second in this heat by
splendid trotting on the back stretch after
Price had got her on her feet again.
Eleata was In front all the second heat,
although Country J made a strong bid
in the stretch.
Going steady as a clock the black mare
took the third heat In record time and was
greeted with enthusiastic cheers as she
came under the wire with Driver Marsh
looking back and shaking his head at the
others. Of the stakes $2000 Is held out
for the consolation stake on Thursday and
the remainder, with the added money, win
ro as follows: Eleata, $5850; Country J,

tt LL-FEELING between strikers and
I non-union men resulted last evening
II In a shooting affray at the corner of
11 First and Harrison streets. F. A.
Pagendarn and Fred M. Cliff, em
ployes of the Dundon Iron Works, flred
the contents of their revolvers into a
crowd of alleged strikers, shooting Wil
liam Dunn through the fleshy part of the
right leg.
The two employes of the Dundon Works
started for their homes about 5:30 p. m.
At the corner of Main and Folsom streets
a crowd began following them, they say,
and as they started to walk up Main
street to Harrison they were greeted with
jeers and cries.
Cliff, who is an ex-soldier, pulled a re
volver from his pocket and called on Pag
endarn to do the same. With their fire
arms In their hands the two men called
upon the crowd to retreat, according to
their story- The mere sight of the weap
ons failing to check their pursuers, the
Dundon men fired Into the air, then at the
men who were following them.
A number of police officers, attracted by
the shooting, ran to the spot and disarmed
Pagendarn and Cliff. William Dunn was
the only man wounded in- the melee and
he was removed to the Harbor Hospital
in an ambulance. Dr. Boscovitch re
moved a bullet from Dunn's right leg. The
missile had grazed the bone but did not
injure it. Barring blood-poisoning, Dunn
is in no danger.
Pagendarn and Cliff were sent to the
Southern police station and charged with
assault to commit murder. They were re
moved to the City Prison and last night
were released on $2000 bail each, bonds
being furnished by P. F. Dundon and J.
E. Buckley.

them. This evening a crowd of men fol
lowed us for some distance when â¢ we left
work. They threw stones and rocks at
us and called us vile names. I had my
father and little brother with me and I
feared they would be hurt. When we got
to First and Harrison streets Cliff called
to me, 'For God's sake pull your gun!' I
did so and we warned the crowd to get
back. Then we saw them coming nearer
and throwing stones again and we flred
Into the air. They continued to throw
stones and we then fired at the crowd in
self-defense. I realized that we were in
danger and might have been seriously in
jured. Some of the men formerly worked
under me."
Cliff told a story similar to that of
Pa^endarn. "~r
William Dunn, the wounded man,
claims to reside at Twentieth and De
Haro streets. He refused last evening to
give any information as to the shooting.
He denied being a metal worker, but when
told that he was known to be a striker
replied. "Well, if you know it, what is the
use of asking me?" He asked that no
mention of the affair be made in the pa
pers, and said he would not prosecute the
two men under arrest.
A number of strikers gathered at the
Harbor Hospital while Dunn was on the
operating table. They gave their names
as A. C. Butt, T. Conley, G. Cook and.
Frank Burns.
Story of the Strikers.
Butt said: "I was coming along Harri
son street toward First. A few men were
with me. We were not following the
men from the Dundon Iron Works. The
In reply to questions Burns said: "I
saw the men who flred the shots coming
along Harrison street toward First. A
few men were half way down the block
behind them. The men in front suddenly
wheeled around and started firing at the
other men. .No rocks were thrown at the
men In front, nor were they molested in
any way. We are strikers, but we did
not give those men any cause to start
firing."
wounded man Burns, Butt and the rest
of the men appeared confused, but gave
no explanation. The men left the hospi
tal to secure an ambulance in which to
remove Dunn to his home.

by the police last evening and statements
were secured that rocks were thrown by

FIGHT ON HAY WHARF.
"Scabs" and Union Men Have Night
Battle.
There was a "dynamite scare" around
Third and Berry streets yesterday caused
by the discovery of a mysterious pack
age, and for a time the police were of
the opinion that some person or persons
unknown intended destroying property.
There had been a fight between union and
non-union, men on the hay wharf the
night before, and that made a basis for
the - "dynamite scare," but it fell to the
ground when the package was opened and
found to -.contain three big firecrackers,
half a pound of powder, some loose
matches and a piece of fuse.
The steam schooner National City has
been laid up for repairs ever since the
strike. Her boilers have to be fixed up
and her machinery overhauled. Monday
last the steamer was anchored out in
China Basin and early in the moring a
gang of non-union workmen were sent
out to her. The strikers were informed
of the fact and Monday night they lay
in wait for the "scabs" on Hay wharf
When the non-union men came ashore
there was a free fight and a squad from
the Southern station had to be sent to
quell the disturbance.
Following this disturbance came the
finding of the mysterious package near
J. A. Reid's blacksmithing shop at 149
Berry street. About three months ago
Reid's place was set on fire and two
months aeo a bomb was placed in the
rear of Sievert's place, 137 Berry street.
The explosives placed behind Reid's place
yesterday were wrapped up in a piece of
oiled paper with the fuse protruding. The
paper had been set on fire, but the wind
blew it out instead of fanning the flames.
The police now think that the whole af
fair was a practical Joke and that neither
the strikers nor non-union men had any
thing to do with it. ~:
Within the next two days suit will be
commenced to test the constitutionality
of the pharmacy law passed at the last
session of the. State Legislature. It is a
movement in which every pharmacist in
the State is interested, and the San Fran
cisco men have entered into a combina
tion to make the fight. Their attorney,
Frank I. Kingwell, has advised them that
the new law will not stand the test of the
courts. The reasons given are that,
in the first place',' the law discrimin
ates, in that, while retail druggists and
their clerks, as 'the handlers of poisons
and the compounders of prescriptions, are
compelled under its provisions to be regis
tered as . pharmacists, there is no provi
sion whatever for . . the registration of
wholesalers and their clerks. And yet the
wholesalers, handle poisons also, and ev
ery wholesale drug house in the State
maintains a laboratory, Â¦wherein are com
pounded preparations that are, I In effect,
prescriptions ind are constantly being
prescribed by physicians or used by drug
gists in the compounding of physicians'
prescriptions. And while the retailers em
ploy none but graduates in pharmacy, or
men expert through long years of experi
ence In the handling of prescriptions and
familiar with chemicals and their com
binations, the wholesalers, it Is claimed,
In many cases employ boys and cheap as
sistants for the purely mechanical work
of mixing. The mixtures of the wholesale
dealers reach as many or more sickbeds
than the prescriptions put up behind the
prescription counters by graduates In
pharmacy.
Still Stronger Reason.
But there is another and still stronger
reason, perhaps, why the new law is
deemed unconstitutional. Why, the drug
gists ask, should they be the only men
of any profession who are charged a fee
for the right to make a living from an
expert education? When a man graduates
from a law school or from a medical col
lege, receiving his degree and his admis
sion to practice his profession, there is
no more question about his professional
standing. Once admitted as a lawyer or
a doctor, he is always thereafter a lawyer
or a doctor. The law and the people pre
sume, and wisely, that the man will gain
In knowledge by practice, and that the
more years he faces the courts or the
more calls he has to the beds of the sick
the more accurate will be his knowledge
of controversy or of illness. \ And yet the
law, and the State Board of Pharmacy
under the law, .goes upon a presumption
the exact opposite of this in dealing with
druggists. And some recent actions of
the State Board of Pharmacy and its sec
retary, John Calvert, would lead to the
conclusion that the gentlemen composing
the board, every one of them a pharma
cist, had been led to the conclusion that
the longer a man worked in a drug store
and the more he studied drugs under the
.tutelage of presumably the best^profes
sors of the day, the less he knew about
his business. ' ". Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ â¢â¢ â¢ - . . .-
If this is not true, why are graduates of
the California College of Pharmacy, itself
a branch of the State University, to be
compelled to take a second examination
In pharmacy at the hands of the State
board, and why are men w,lth years of ex
perience and the best schools behind them
likewise to be put through an examina
tion like mere schoolboys?' It is precisely
of these things that the druggists com
plain.
Collecting Back Fees.
Still one more hardship in the construc
tion of the new law by the State board
is complained of by druggists, and It is
upon this point that the test of the law
may come. Under the old pharmacy law,
repealed by the passage of the present
act, there was a certain laxity in the col
lection of registration fees, and many
druggists allowed their fees to fall into
arrears, not through inability or unwill
ingness to pay, but simply because the
secretary of the old board did not make
sharp collections. It, has been ruled by
the new board that all such men as are
in arrears under the old law must, be
fore they are registered under the new,
make up such arrears, or else submit to
a new examination before the State board
before they will be registered and per
mitted to practice their profession in this
State. The hardship in this lies not in
the exaction of the money, which is a
small matter, but in the compelling of
men who have committed no fault to take
time from their business to cram for an
examination which might be easy for
schoolboys with no practical knowledge,
but which also ! might stump the most
expert pharmacist who had not crammed.
Secretary Calvert Talks.
"It is a fact," said John Calvert, secre
tary of the State Board of Pharmacy,
yesterday, "that all graduates In phar
macy, of whatever school, must take an
examination before the State board be
fore they will be registered as Â¦ licenti
ates."
"Graduates of t"he California College of
Pharmacy?" he was asked.
"Yes; graduates of every college."
"Whyf*
"It Is a rule the board made."
"And If a man who was a registered
pharmacist under the old law has neg
lected or failed for any reason to pay hia
dues under that law, must he also take
the examination?" . Â«
"No. He must pay his back" dues or'
take the examination. One or the other.
We will accept the back dues accrued
under the old law, or the applicant must
take the examination. ' That is a rule the
board has made. We do not recognize de
grees from anywhere." " '
Provision of New Law.
TheÂ»new law provides. In section 4, for
the assessment of $2 a year upon prac
ticing pharmacists and licentiates, as the
old law ,did, and for a yearly tax of $1
upon assistants In drag stores; but it
likewise. In section 6, makes- this provi
sion:
It shall be the duty, of the board to examine
and register as pharmacists or assistant phar
macists all applicants whom It shall deem
qualified to be such respectively. All persons
on applying for examination or registration
shall pay to the secretary a fee of ?5 for licen
tiate and $2 for assistants, and on passing the
examination they shall be furnished \ with a
certificate signed by the secretary and the ex
aminers. Every registered pharmacist who
desires to continue the practice of his profes
sion in this State shall annually, on such
date , as the Board of Pharmacy may deter
mine, pay to the secretary of 'said board a
registration fee to" be fixed by the board, but
which shall in no case exceed the sum of \Z
per annum, for which he shall : receive a re
newal of such registration. - ..
The section then goes on to provide that
assistant pharmacists, or' helpers In
stores, shall be charged a fee of $2 for
examination and of $1 per year for regis
tration thereafter.
The limitation of the right of registra
tion under this - section to those persons
only - who have passed- the examination
prescribed by the State board is claimed
by druggists to work a needless hardship
upon many men who are at least as com
petent as the members of the State board
themselves... - . ., '. Â¦"â¢ \
Section 4 of the new law reads:
Cvery pharmacist claiming the right of regis
tration under this act shall, on or before the
1st of July, next after Ha passage, forward to
the State Board i of Â¦ Pharmacy satisfactory
proof that he was a duly registered pharma
cist under the provisions of an act to regulate
the practice Â¦ or Â¦ pharmacy . or sale of poisons

CHARRED BODY
IN THE RUINS
May Be Remains of "Wil
liam Hoist, Proprietor
of Glass Works.
William Hoist, proprietor of the stained
glass works at 134-136 Guerrero street, is
believed to have perished in the flames at
yesterday morning's lire. After the Fire
Department had left the scene Polic Offi
cer Slattery, while poking among the
ruins at 5:45 a. m., found the body of a
man in the same location as the room oc
cupied by Hoist. The legs had been burned
off below the knees and the arms had
been charred off from the elbows down.
The mutilated trunk was taken to the
Morgue and was viewed by several friends
of Hoist, but the body having been burned
almost to a cinder they were unable to
identify it. But It was known that Hoist
occupied a room in the works, which was
a one-story wooden building, and It was
known that he had disappeared since half
past 9 o'clock on the previous night, and
that no one else was. missing.
The proprietor was unmarried. He had
not been very successful in business re
cently, but he was of a cheerful disposi
tion, and his friends will not entertain
the idea of suicide.
Tho fire was first seen at 2:12 a. m. in
the glass works. The building being of
wood,- well dried, burned very rapidly and
fiercely, and as soon as the vanguard of
the Fire Department arrived a second
alarm was turned In. The glass works
building was burned to the . ground and
all its contents destroyed. It was the
property of William Hoffman. The ad
joining three-story frame building, Nos.
140, 142 and 144, was partly consumed and
nearly all the contents destroyed. It was
owned by Carrie Martin and occupied for
dwelling purposes by herself, J. E. Sulli
van, C. H. Hamm and "W. E. Stager. The
two-story frame Â¦ building, 132 Guerrero
street, was badly damaged. It was owned
by Henry Schwarge and occupied as a
dwelling by Philip H. Meyer. Meyer suc
ceeded in getting most of his furniture out
of the house before the fire reached it.
The one-story fwrme in the rear of 132%
Guerrero Is simply a shed used by the
United States Bottling Company. The
loss there was small.
The total damage will reach $25,000. The
origin of the fire is a mystery. It is be
lieved by the fire officials that It orig
inated by spontaneous combustion of
chemicals used in the manufacture of
stained glass.
There is another theory that the fire
may havo been the work of the mysteri
ous incendiary who is believed to have
started several fires in this city within the
last few days.

Chamber of Commerce Meets.
The quarterly meeting of the Chamber
of Commerce was held yesterday. The re

had in charge the reception and entertain

Rivers and Harbors, was read and ac
cepted. A communication was sent to
William M. Bunker, who is representing
the commercial bodies of San Francisco
at the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Con

toward having that body pass resolutions
urging the Secretary of War to hasten the
survej's and construction of the impound

ris, a retired merchant of Oakland, filed a

* The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute,
at a regular meeting held last evening,
adopted resolutions censuring Trustee P.
J. Healy, who has been writing public
communications in which he has advo
cated the transfer of the sitÂ© of the Me
chanics' Pavilion to the city for the pro
posed Carucgle. Library. Healy has also
found fault with the management of the
institute. The resolutions that were
adopted by the trustees were based upon
and indorsed a report from the library
committee in which it was asserted that
Healy had been making' mlsstatements
about the institution. He was disputed
squarely on several points. It was denied
in the report that the dissemination of
information and useful knowledge by the
establishment of a library of circulation
and reference had become a secondary
consideration with the trustees.
It was also denied In the report that 60
per cent of tho books purchased by the
trustees were works of fiction, as. since
March, 1900. only a. little over 43 per cent
of the purchased volumes have beÂ«n fic
tion "It certainly ' seems to be to the
credit of the management," ' so reads the
report, "that while 82 per cent of the cir
culation was fiction, only 43 per cent of
the books purchased were of that classi
fication." Heaiy's assertion that the in
stitute has lost 1000 members since the be
ginning of the fiscal year 1900 and is stead
ily losing members was also denied and
the statements were characterized as
"lacking evidence of a. love of facts and
fairress." An increase of 260 actual pay
ing members was claimed on the showing
of a' gain in $522 in the. collections on ac
count of the dues and entrance fees.
Healy Severely- Censured.
"Mr. Heaiy's evident intent," so reads
the report, "was to bring the library into
disrepute and it is useless to follow out
all the statements, assertions and opinion^
made by him In hfcr communication and
reply to them in detail, as they are all
devoid of accuracy and not entitled to any
consideration from the members of the in
stitute or of the public at large."
The resolutions declared that "the
board hereby condemns the action of
Trustee Healy in publishing the state
ments referred to as an effort to injure
the Mechanics* Institute and the library
and to bring them into disrepute without
the least foundation upon the facts as
they exist."
After this action Trustee Healy moved
that a committee of three should be ap
pointed to consult with the municipal gov
ernment concerning the Carnegie Library
and the site. No one seconded the mo
tion. Various propositions to the trus
tees in reference to the site of the Me
chanics' Pavilion are still before a com
mittee, which is expected to report at the
next regular meeting, which will take
place August 6.

says, have sold bulletins and other pub

TATE MINERALOGIST AUBURY
(j^^ has decided to make an innbva-
tion. He says that a price will be
te^-J/ charged for the publications of the
State Mining Bureau. This applies
to certain publications now in the library,
and also to those that are to be issued
hereafter. Heretofore all the issues of
printed matter from the bureau, from the
date of the establishment of the bureau,
have been free and every citizen of the
State was entitled to receive copies as
long â¢ as they lasted. In addition to the
charge 'for the bulletins, reports, etc.,
postage will be required. A little printed
slip has been prepared under Aubury'a
direction to be sent out to inquirers, in
which prices are quoted as follows: First
biennial report, $1; third biennial report,
Aubury'g explanation is that he thinks
there ought to be a revolving fund, and
that hia move is In that direction. The
purpose of the fund would be to supply
money to pay for the cost of getting out
new editions of any work of the bureau
that is in demand but Is not in stock. The
allowance of $7000 made by the last Leg
islature will be needed, he says, to pay
for the new bulletins to be prepared on

NEW YORK, July 16.â There was a show. of
strength in the early stock market to-day, but
It was mostly dissipated before the close. The
attention to the crop news and the reports over
night of rains was a strong influence in the
advance of the. corn carrying railroads, which
extended to from 2 to 2% in the most prominent
members of the group, Atchison leading. The
sharp rally in the corn market late In the day
and the language of the weekly Government
crop report depressed the corn-carrying roads,
and Just before the close St. Paul fell to a
sharp fraction under last night. The United
States Sieel stocks were apparently pegged,
and their unyielding support discouraged mere
raiding tactics on the part of the bears, but
the insiders who bought the stocks had to ac
cept a continued stream of liquidation all day.
There seemed to be Influential buying also of
the Pacifies, Grangers and Southwesterns, but
it consisted in the acceptance of offerings
rather than of active bidding for stock, and
not much resistance was offered to the late re
action. The banks show no evidence of a desire
to foster renewed speculation, and are asking
rather highar rates for time money. Call loan
rates receded, but without resulting in any
actual pressure of money to loan, and sterling
exchange was also easier this morning,- al
though it stiffened again before the close.
Favorable progress was reported In the Lon
don stock exchange settlement; The sub-treas
ury is contributing to the money market and
that institution's debt at the clearing-house to
day ran up to $2,690,S96, due to heavy pension
payments and to payment of a check for Klon
dike gold deposited on the Pacific Coast. The
relaxation thus variously . Indicated of require
ments upon the New York money market was
the important factor in the firmer and quieter
stock market to-day. The headlong liquida
tion of last week and yesterday morning was
thus shown to be unnecessary. There is no dis
position, however, to encroach upon the
money market supplies, which, it is believed,
will be certainly needed at an early period in
the croi> movement.
The railroad bond market was quiet and ir
regular, with a narrow range. Total Bales, par
value, $1,435,000. '.
United States 3s, the old 4s and the 5s ad
vanced ft and the new 4s declined ft per cent

WHEATâ The foreign markets continued

Chicago dropped from 66%c to 65%c and ad
vancad to 67%c. It was largely a. weather
market. The skies were partly cloudy through
out the West, with light local' showers here
nnd there, occasional thunderstorms and one
or two copious rains. Generally, speaking, the
rainfall amounted to little or nothing. There
were increased reports of blight in the North
west. Bradstreet's gave a decrease in stocks
of 4,442,000 bushels, as follows: East of the
Rockies, 1,842,000; Europe and afloat, 2,600, CCC.
The market was distinguished by excellent
buying, particularly at St. Louis, where the
French importers bought liberally, and 100,000
bushels were worked for shipment to Minne
apolis. At Chicago the class of buyers was the
best for a year. There were bad crop reports
from Minnesota and Kansas.
This market was firm, with an advance in
futures.

OATS â The market has not been as dull as
has generally been reported. In fact, a re
markable demand has been going on for four
or five days. A well-known brokerage firm has
bought up from 40,000 to 50,000 sks, chiefly red,
and will take 50.0CO sks more; believing, in
view of the damage to the Oat crop all over
the world, except on this coast, that the goods
are cheap. But in spite of this sharp demand
and the large sales, prices have not advanced.
Reds are being taken, because the other de
scriptions are in too limited supply for any
activity. Most of the offerings on 'Change
consist of red, very few whites and blacks
being seen. Further large transfers may be
expected, as the demand is still keen.

Weather Report.
General Summaryâ Nearly normal weather
eruditions have prevailed during the week,
with comparatively high temperatures in 60me
portions and light fogs along the coast. Up to
the present time there has been no material 1e-
Jury to grain or fruit from extreme heat or
northers, but field fires have caused consid
erable damage to grain.
Harvesting 1 and threshing are progressing
rapidly in all sections. Small shipments are
being made, but most of the grain will be
etored in warehouses. Reports from nearly all
the grain-growing districts north of the Te
hsrhapi show that previous estimates were in
the main correct: the yield of wheat and bar-
Ify is the largest for several years, and In
fome instances above the average. Both are
excellent in quality. The yield of grain in
Southern California is below average. The
hey crop is one of the best for many years
und of good quality. Sugar beets, hops, corn,
beans and vegetables are generally in splendid
condition, with prospects for large crops.
Pasturage is becoming scarce and cattle are
b^ing driven to mountain ranges.
Much progress has been made during the
week in picking, drying and canning deciduous
fruits. Nearly all varieties are excellent In
quality, but except In a few favored sections
the yield is far below average, lleager re
ports are received from the grape-growing dis
tricts, but indications are that the yield will
be about average, Oranges are in excellent
condition, and a heavy crop Is predicted. Wal
nuts are doing well.
Sacramento Valley â Nearly normal tempera
ture has prevailed during the week, and con
ditions have been favorable for growing crops
end all kinds of farm work. Grain harvest,
hay making and baling have progressed rap
idly. Wheat, barley and hay are of excellent
quality, and in some sections the yield is
above average. Grass and brush fires have
caused slight damage in Tehama County. Green
feed is becoming scarce in some places. Corn,
hops and potatoes are doing well. J Frult pick-
Ing, drying and canning are progressing.
Grapes and citrus fruits are in good condi
tion.
Coast and Bay Sectionsâ Conditions have
bÂ»en generally favorable for all crops, except
that prunes in the Santa Clara Valley have
been somewhat injured by heat. Grain harvest
and threshing are progressing, and good crops
are being gathered. In Sonoma County the
yield is the largest for several years. Hay
baling continues; in San Benito County the
yield and quality are above average. Hops,
corn and sugar beets are In good condition.
Fruit picking and drying are In progress. Ap
riccts and prunes are yielding light crops, but
are mostly of good size. Citrus fruits and
gTapes are looking well.
San Joaquin Valleyâ Excellent weather pre
vailed during the past week for the ripening
and harvesting- of all crops. The grain harvest
continues to progress rapidly. The yield is
fully up to expectations: the crop will be
large and the quality Is excellent. Considerable
prain has been shipped, but far the greater
portion Is being stored in the warehouses. De
ciduous fruits are ripening rapidly, and in some
localities the apricot crop has been gathered.
Peaches and plums are being handled in large
Quantities. In some localities the crop is good
and in others light. The quality of the fruit
Is reported to be excellent. Canneries and dry
ers are in full operation. Melons are making
rapid progress and are of fine quality. Grapes
are doing nicely and the prospects are for a
large crop. Water for irrigation Is plentiful.
Stock of all kinds are doing well.
Southern Californla^-The weather during the
week has been generally clear and warm with
a few foggy mornings along the coast There
was a trace of rain en the 10th at Poway. A
fair crop of wheat is being harvested, but in
6ome sections the grain is badly rusted The
corn crop will be light. Sugar beets are thrifty
and will yield a good crop. Fruit picking and
drying are progressing; there is a light crop
of most varieties. Grapes, walnuts and citrus
fruits are in trood condition.
Bean Crop Specialâ Mr. L. E. Blochman of
Santa Maria contributes the following: "Owinst
to unusually cool weather in June and the
damage to vines by worms, the plants are be
low normal size, and the bean crop will be
much less than anticipated. Present condi
tions are very favorable, however. The bean
belt Includes all of San Luis Oblspo County
and Northern Santa Barbara County, and Is
one cf the largest centers for the small white
(navy) bean."
Eureka Summaryâ Corn and peas are doing
well, but potatoes and root crops generally are
beginning to show the effect of continued dry
weather. Oat haying le progressing finely and
yielding better than was expected.
Los Angeles Nummaryâ The weather Is favor
able for ripening and drying fruit. Apricot
harvest Is on; crop light. Walnuts are growing
well, but dropping more than usual. The honey
crop Is largo la the southern mountains, where
white cage ia in full bloom.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
The Weather and Crops.
jrfail advices from New York say:
"There is more inquiry in the market both
rt-orc the local and country trade for a number
of lines of spot goods, but sellers do not ap
pear at all sanguine that any material in
crease in actual business \nil result. A little
ertivity is noted in currants and prunes, sale
of an assorted car of the latter being reported
to arrive from the coast at the previous range
of rrict*. Spot prunes are going out very 'well
for the season of the year, mostly to the out
of-town trade. The size most wanted Is 60-70s,
bet 40-50s, 50-60s and 90-100s are also meeting
with some sale In a small way. Apricots are
rteady and in some rc-quest in a jobbing way.
There is a fair export trade In fancy. Some
inquiry is noted for round lots of apricots. No
tales of future apricots were heard of yester
day, hut there were roroe further evidences of
an awakening Interest in the new pack, al
though the general sentiment appears to be
that the Ideas of coast holders must come
down farther before the trade here will buy
to any extent. Some business is going on in
new crop Smyrna figs, but prices are with
held. A fair jobbing business is doing in sed
less Muscatel raisins and evaporated apples.
Prime, choice and fancy apples are firm, but
no .business is heard of in a carlot way. Small
fruits are dull. Imported Sultana raisins are
easier, about 3000 boxes, now due, being offered
at Il^ic, 12>iC and 13%c for 2, 3 and 4 crown
respectively. Nuts are dull. The arrival is
reported of 160 bags of Brazils on the steamer
from Liverpool."

San Francisco Meat Market.
CHICAGO, July 16.â The weather remained
the all-potent factor in wheat to-day, although
at the opening weak cables joined with re
ports of better weather in the Northwest were
influential in considerable liquidation of wheat,
September opening %@%o to %@%c lower at
66c to 65%c. Aggressive local support and re
ports that New York Stock Exchange traders
were buying stemmed the tide almost imme
diately. During the rest of the day reports
were received showing that the situation 'in
the spring wheat territory is practically un
changed. Some claimed considerable damage
In South Dakota. The official weather fore
cast gave slight prospect of better conditions.
Commission houses sold with"' considerable
liberality on small * bulges, but the market
easily handled all offerings, and September
steadily advanced to 67%c. The close was
firm, lc higher at' 67V4@67%c
There was a heavy trade in corn. Scat
tered reports of rain, the appearance of
clouds or of cooler weather, resulting In a
rush of sales at the start, September opening
%c to l%c lower. Numerous ether reports
showing that considerable damage had been
done already and that climatic conditions gen
erally were still against even an ordinary crop
of corn, and the heavy run of hogs, caused a
rally. The close was strong, l%@lfto higher
at 50%Â®50%e.
Oats were moderately active and displayed
a firmness independent of the strength de
veloped In corn. September closed %@?4o
higher at 31%c.
Provisions were dull and heavy, owing to
the heavy run of hogs and a drop In prices
at the yards. Fluctuations were narrow, clos
ing prices being about as they were at the
opening. September pork closed 7%o lower,
lard 5c lower and ribs 10c' depressed.

NEW TORK, July 16.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:.
The stock market to-day was more cheerful
and the natural reaction after the slump and
demoralization of the last few days was en
couraged by .the Cape Premier's strong speech
on the war. In consols the bears scurried to
cover, causing a rally of % to 92%, but there
Is more talk of a f re6h war loan (possibly
Â£100,000,000). The new Indian loan of Â£3,000.000
proves a fiasco, only Â£1,000,000 having been
subscribed. The loan has been withdrawn.
The foreign markets i were more cheerful,
but coppers were weak.
American- stocks opened hard, but business
wa3 confined to two and three hands. London
bought slightly, but most orders, from New
York were feverish and fluctuating. Atten
tion was mainly centered on Atchisons, Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific. United States
Steel was comparatively steady.

TEACHERS' OLD CLAIMS
WILL BE PAID TO-DAY
Auditor Will Distribute to Them Sal
ary Warrants for November
and December, 1898. â¢
The city will wind up its obligations to
the teachers and janitors by paying them
the balance due on their salary demands
for November and December, 1S98, out of
the surplus fund to-day. Auditor Wells
has had his force of clerks busy for two
weeks preparing the warrants and they
will- be "ready for delivery this morning at
9 o'clock. A large . number, of warrants
have been hypothecated to money brok
ers,' but the Auditor says the latter must
stand, aside until the rush . of teachers
who have not sold their warrants, is over.
. The settlement with the teachers will
also be instrumental in settling .the dis
pute with the merchant creditors. Each
teacher will surrender her proportion ot
the $7000 advanced to the teachers by the
merchants in March. 1900. and vexatious
litigation will thus be avoided.

said to-day that the results of the trials

stamped the challenger aa the fastest
yacht this side of the water. Sir Thomas
said he thought the Shamrock II was able
to beat the Shamrock I by eight minutes
In a thirty-mile course, and he therefore
believed- she had a good prospect of suc
cess against her American competitor.

he expected of her.' The Shamrock II will

San Francisco has been selected as
the point at which all the energies
of the International Association of
Machinists will be concentrated with
in a few days to force the manufac
turing ironworkers of this city into
a compliance with, the demands of
the local organization as presented on
May 20. Every demand embraced in
,the original proposition, for the fail
tire to grant which the men walked
out on that date, is to be enforced.
In connection with the .American
Federation of Labor, the machinist
association proposes to raise a fund of
$100,000 a week to prosecute the
fight. . " .-
The situation resolves itself to this: In
the International Association of Machin
ists there are said to be 1,560,000 machin
ists. Each of these has agreed to pay 6
cents per week to the strike fund, or a
total of $78,000 a week, which will be
available at once.
Fourth Vice President Thomas L. Wil
son of the International Association of
Machinists furnished these figures last
night at the headquarters of . the local
Machinists' Union and made the follow
ing statement:
'The machinists accept the ultimatum
of the employers and feel that the strikes
in the East having been settled and not
called off, instead of having a detrimental
effect on the local situation, will have a
tendency to strengthen our hands here.
We have the assurance of the Interna
tional Grand Lodge that the funds will
be forthcoming for a finish fight in San
Francisco. Eighty per cent of the men
out on strike in the East have been
granted their demands and 20 per cent of
the men have returned to work at the old
schedule. It is our expectation that we
will call the latter out within the year and
have them placed on an equality with the
others."
The American Federation of Labor and
the International Association of Machin
ists and local bodies affiliating with both
organizations propose to raise a strike
fund of $100,000 a week, which will be sent
to San Francisco to carry out the plans
of the strike leaders. In this city the
San Francisco Labor Council has asked
for a per capita tax of 50 cents a month
in place of the 20 cents now levied, and
responses are being freely made. The
leaders of the Ironworkers* strike are
confident of victory with this amount of
money at ' their disposal.
Union Iron "Works Contract.
M. J. McEvoy. secretary of the Machin
ists* Union of Omaha, Neb., has sent Sec
retary Wisler a copy of a contract and
explanatory statement sent out by the
Union Iron Works to employment agen

break away from local leaders and go back
to work. "*â¢

The Municipal League of San Francisco
met last night for the purpose. of receiv
ing the report of the committee appointed
to attempt to bring about a settlement of
the machinists' strike. Secretary Wisler
of the International Association of Ma
chinists was present and took part in an
animated discussion regarding the strike
situation and a probable solution of the
difficulty. The following report of the con
ciliation committee was read:

These gentlemen have had numerous confer

1118 Broadway. July 16.
The Board of Supervisors to-day closed
five Upper Fruitvale drinking resorts. In
cluding the Hermitage, which for nearly
twenty years has been conducted at Di
mond with a notoriety which is State
wide. The licenses of Charles Tepper,
Mrs. B. Walliser and Robert E. Taylor
were also revoked by a unanimous vote
of the board. .
Leon Faure, proprietor of the Hermit
age, had one supporter, Supervisor
Church, who also opposed the closing of
Peter C. Nielsen's barroom. But the
other members of the board declared they
would not make fish of one and flesh of
another.
The Hermitage was not singled out in
the fight of the Fruitvalers against the
saloons, but the place was, unfortunately
for its owner, among the group of re
sorts which the antl-saloonists had deter
mined to drive out of business. The de
cision of the board covers all but one of
the Upper Fruitvale places where liquors
are sold. The Neckhaus Gardens were al
lowed to retain their license because no
evidence of disorder was introduced
against the resort.
The action by the board was a com
plete victory for the men and women of
Upper Fruitvale, who have been battling
against the hoodlumlsm, depravity and
disorder which have marked the conduct
of some of the resorts that have been de
nied licenses.
When the Supervisors convened this
morning to render their decision the
lobby was packed with an interested au
dience from Fruitvale. Chairman Mit
chell called up the resolutions on revoca
tion of the Walliser, Tepper and Taylor
licenses. The charges made against each
resort were sustained by the board, and
promptly the five members voted to close
the places. . .
Supervisor Church said he would not
have voted to close Tepper's place, ex
cept that the proprietor had himself said
that he was going out of business, so
Church was ready to close the place at
once.
When the applications of Faure and
Nielsen were read Church was in favor
of granting the renewal of the licenses.
He said noÂ»evidence had been Introduced
to prove disorderly actions. But the other
four members of the board did not agree
with their confrere, and they sent the
Hermitage into oblivion. Nielsen runs a
saloon in connection with his gro
cery. There was no special complaint
against him, except on the ground that
the citizens of that suburb had deter
mined, if possible, to close all saloons.
As soon as the voting had decided the
fate of the resorts Chairman John Mit
chell made the following announcement:
"It might be well to state right here
that the Board of Supervisors is deter
mined to clean out everything of a dis
orderly character in Alameda County."
The Clerk was directed to notify the
proper authorities that the licenses were
revoked and that no liquors can be sold
at the resorts.
The men* who were prime movers in this
successful crusade were the Rev. Frank
lin Rhbda, William C. Ralston. F. C.
Hinckley, W. S. Dunlevy and William
Lowenburg, with the backing of all the
citizens and residents in Upper Fruitvale.

BOARD CLOSES
FIVE RESORTS
The Republican Primary League, undis
turbed by the conflicting petitions for ap
portionment of delegates to the munici
pal' nominating convention. Is going for
ward in the work of enrolling citizens for
the campaign against the bosses. Under
the auspices of the league a club has been
established in every Assembly district.
As the Republican State Central Commit
tee has responded to the boss cry for
help and decided to interfere on- behalf of
Kelly, Crimmina,' Lynch and Jere Burke,
it becomes the duty of all respectable Re
publicans to join the league and fight the
battle for good local* government at the
primary election.
At the worst, the State Committee can
only indorse Crimmins and Kelly. There
is no official ballot to recognize. The par
ty tickets are blank. The law provides
that posters containing the names of dele
gates to be voted for can be pasted on
the ticket. Happily for the Republican
Primary League, no alliance was made
with the . tagenders of the hotel" party
that knifed Horace Davis, the Republican
nominee for Mayor two years ago. It
was suspected at the- outset ofthe cam
pa.'gn that the tagenders were preparing
to betray the friends of good government
to secure the nomination of two or three
favorites. The suspicion is verified as
fact by present movements. The remnant
of the hotel party Is going over bag and
baggage to Kelly and Crimmins. > .
The Republican Primary League peti
tioned the Board of Supervisors to declare
August 13 a legal holiday. The petition
was granted. . The league hopes that every
citizen of San Francisco who is entitled to
vote will register -his choice for delegates
to the nominating convention. The bosses
base their hope of success on the belief
that the worklngmen, merchants; business
men and taxpayers generally will fall to
vote. It is said that the merchants and
business men who can afford to go to the
country will leave town Monday evening,
August 12, and not return until Wednes
day, August 14. The business men and
taxpayers of the city should come togeth
er and resolve to stay in. town and make
one more determined effort to down the
whole crew of bosses and boss sympathiz
ers. Good local government cannot be
gained by wishing for it The fight to win
it must be made at thÂ« primary election.
In every district the bosses will put for
ward a ticket headed "Against Boss
Rule." That is an old trick devised by
Sam Rainey and! Kelly. Before election
day comes citizens should make up their
lists of delegates to be voted for. The Re
publican Primary League has no candi
dates to boom. The aim of the organiza
tion is to elect honorable men to the con
ventionâmen that cannot be cajoled or
controlled by the bosses.
At a meeting of the Regular Republican
Club of the Forty-second Assembly Dis
trict held last evening at Golden Gate
Hall, seventy-four new members signed
the roll, which now contains 111 names.
The appointment of a campaign * com
mittee of five was left in the hands of the
president, Colonel R. B. Treat.
I. W. Lees was appointed chairman of
the finance committee. .
An executive committee of fifteen was
appointed, one from each precinct.

be signed by every machinist accepting a
position with the Union Iron Works. The
agreement provides that the wages shall
be from $3 to $3 50 per day, and so long as
the strike lasts he will be lodged and fed
at the expense of the company, which
will give him protection before and after
the strike. All men must pay their own
way on the railroad or make a deposit
equal to cost of ticket, but the money will
be refunded after six months' work.
As to the Municipal League.
Following the failure of the conciliatory
committee of the Municipal League to
bring together the I striking ironworkers
and their emplo'yers, the members of the
Metal Trades Association, both sides
yesterday quietly rested. Some comment
was made as to who and what kind of
people composed the Municipal League.
One of the first questions propounded by
Henry T. Scott, when the matter of the
conference was proposed to him was,
"What is the Municipal League?"
"We never had much confidence in the
Municipal League to bring our affairs to
a satisfactory conclusion," said President
McCabe of the Iron Trades Council. "But
as the people who represented it and
called on us insisted that we let them try
to end the strike, we gave them a.n ulti
matum upon which to work. Our men
are standing out just as firm as the day
they walked out."
Inquiries at the offices of the Fulton,
Risdon and Union Iron works brought
forth the information that no further con
sideration would be given to the demands
of the ironworkers. Under no circum
stances, say one and all, will the nine
hour day be granted.
President McCabe wishes to notify the
public that some person unknown to the
Iron Trades Council is malting, a house to
house canvass in various portions of the
city soliciting- funds for the benefit of the
strikers. President McCabe says no one
has been authorized to solicit money from
private individuals.
"Wo have our committees out among
the unions and that is all," said he. "we
will ask the police to aid us in apprehend
ing the party."
H. Glldea. treasurer of the strike-benefit
fund, has issued a notice to all, unions re
questing that moneys subscribed for the
benefit of the striking ironworkers be
sent direct to him at the headquarters,
room 711, Emma Spreckels building, and
proper acknowledgrment will be made.
The boiler-makers and iron ship builders
received their strike benefits yesterday.
Quite a large sum was paid out.
The State Board of Barber Examiners is
preparing to close up its business in this
city, preliminary to visiting Alameda
County. It is expected that by the end
of the week all San Francisco barbers
will be provided with the certificates now
required by law. While there are a large
number of applications - yet on file, the
members of the board feel that they can
get away with them all in that space of
time: â¢ " "

time for work a year ago the Beer Bot
tlers' Union held a jinks and smoker at

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 16. â From a member
of the firm of J. P. Morgan &.Co., spon
sors for the United States Steel Corpora
tion, The Call correspondent obtained to
day a statement of the company's view
of the present labor troubles and the pol
icy -which It entertains on the strike ques
tion. The statement is absolutely author
itative, and is notable because it makes
clear the unj-lelding attitude of the big
corporation and the serious nature of the
conflict with the Amalgamated Associa
tion.
"Things have reached a point," said the
Informant, "-where it Is absolutely neces
sary to make a -settlement, once and for
all. The fight will be pushed to the bitter
end. The United States Steel Corporation
and its subsidiary companies have taken
a stand and they will not recede one step
from their position.
"The policy of the United States Steel
Corporation toward its men has been lib
eral. Their demands have been granted
when it was possible. But it is now ab
solutely out of the question to accede to
their demands. The company simply can
not do it and succeed in business. Since
that is the case, we have decided to take
issue with the labor union, and the matter
will be fought to a finish.
"Should the men gain the point for
which they are striving and should they
eucceed In extending the system they aim
to establish in the steel trade into other
industries, the entire business condition
of the country would be upset. With the
knowledge of that fact, we are unable
even to consider, the Idea of the concession
they ask.
"We have broken otf negotiations with
representatives of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation because of their impossible re
quest, and there is no occasion now for
further conference with them. Such con
ference -would be fruitless at present. Any
advances vith a view to ending the 6trike
must come from the men. and they must
be prepared to recall the demand for the
right to dictate our policy in non-union
mills. They know our position and we
Ehall stick to it."
"Will the United States Steel Coruora
tion interest itself as a. company in strike
matters?" was asked.
"My impression is that officials of the
subsidiary companies trill be allowed to
handle the details without interference."
was the answer. "Later on the comDany
officials may take an active part in the
matter."
The importance of the present fight was
dwelt on etill more forcibly by another
representative of the Morgan Interests.
He declared that the steel capitalists re
garded the demand of the men that union
agreements should be signed for non-union
mills as "outrageous and unjust," and
added: "The steel companies cannot yield
a particle to the men when they make a
demand of that sort. They feel that if
they should give in they might as well
go out of business and so might -every
body else who had to endure the same
thing."
STRIKERS CLAIM SESTJLTS.
PITTSBURG. July\6.â The second strike
day closes with the Amalgamated officials
in a satisfied mood and claiming to have
made good every promise as to results
On the other hand, the manufacturers will
not say a word concerning the strike, and
refuse to be quoted in any way. Repeated
efforts to secure statements from Presi
dent Corey of the American Sheet Steel
Company and General Manager L W.
Jenks of the Hoop Company have been
met with the response that there waÂ£ no
change and nothing to be given out.
The Amalgamated people eay that noth
ing has been said to them of any plan for
mediation or arbitration and that they
will continue to carry out their pro
pramme as originally announced. The
closing down of the Clark mill and of the
Monessen Sheet mill are looked upon as
telling -victories and an almost complete
tie-up of the three companies in the dis
trict. But one tin mill, that at Monessen,
and one sheet mill, at Duncanville, re
main at work.
Ihe fact that the National Tube men
(non-union) received a substantial ad
vance In wages yesterday has caused dis
content among the union men employed
by the National Tube people at their Sec
ond avenue plant and at the Republic Mill
on the South Side. The men here think
they are entitled to a similar increase.- To
consider the matter meetings were held
to-night on the South Side and it is Bald
r. demand will be made. The following
telegram was received to-night:
WKLLSVIL.LE. j u i y ie.â The Wellsville roll
ing mill will be run. and it will be run non
union. It will utart to-morrow. If It could
not be run non-unUm It never would be run at
all.
This statement was made to-day by
Persifer F. Smith of Pittsburg. district
manager for the American Sheet Steel
Company. He was here this morning and
made an address to the striking mill men.
He told them they had no grievance, that
they had been well cared for in the past
and would be in the future. The an
nouncement that the mill would be started
to-morrow and started non-union has
given rise to no little speculation and un
easiness among thÂ« citizens. Many of the
strikers, expecting prolonged idleness,
have left the city for hunting and fishing
camps. No new mÂ«-n have- been brought
in and how Manager Smith expects to
start to-morrow is a matter for conjec
ture. To-day, as yÂ«?Â«tercay, only a few
laborers were -working.
The foregoing is the first indication as
yet given by th<? manufacturers that they
were otter than passive participants in
the big strike. What the result may be
of an attempt to operate the Wellsville
plant none of the local Amalgamated peo
ple will predict. All they say is that it
cannot be acrompishrrd. Wellsville is
looked upon by both eides as an important
point and developments are anxiously
awaited by alL

o'clock this morning, when JKX) members
of the organization in this section of the

Special Dispatch to The Call,
EL PASO, Tex., July 16.â A fireman be
longing to an American train crew, for
merly operating on a southern division of
the Mexican Central Railway in the in
terior of the Republic, told an unusual
story here to-day â¢which was not made
public until he and his companions had
escaped to the United States and were
safe beyond the reach of the Mexican au
thorities.
Some days ago the freight engine on
which the fireman worked ran over a
Mexican at a remote point in the Interior,
killing him almost Instantly. Knowing
full well that they would all be thrown
in prison and held for an indefinite period
if the accident was discovered by the
Mexican officials, the trainmen were
greatly troubled over the- situation. They
were running between stations when the
accident occurred and the region there
abouts was but little frequented. Owing
to this none of the inhabitants saw the
killing and it took the trainmen but a
short time to realize that if they could
conceal the body of the dead they might
escape to the border and avoid a long
imprisonment in the Mexican jail before
given an opportunity of clearing them
selves of the charge of criminal intent.
Accordingly they decided that the most
effective way to dispose of the body
would be to cremate it in the locomotive
firebox. All agreed to this and the body
and other evidences of violence were
gathered up and cast into the furnace.
The train then proceeded and before the
next station was reached the corpse had
been reduced to ashes. The trainmen lost
no time in making their way to El Paso,
and all succeeded in escaping before the
officers and relatives of the deceased dis
covered that he had been killed.

For the Arbitration Court.
WASHINGTON, July 16.â To maintain
the present balance of the American rep
resentation on The Hague Arbitration
Commission, the President regards It as
essential to appoint a Republican to fill
the vacancy created by the death of for
rrer President Harrison. Difficulty la be
ing experienced in finding a suitable per
son of national reputation. The Supreme
Court will not be further drawn upon.
The United States Senate is barred as a
field of selection, and the indications are
that the choice will fall upon some di3
tlr guished member of the State judiciary.
Esparto High School Instructors.
"WOODLAND, July 16.â Miss Beatrice
Bannon of Sacramento has been chosen,
principal of the Esparto High School and
Miss M. Johnson of Yolo county, assist
ant.
Deeds will be placed on record to-day by
which properties aggregating about six
teen acres, situated In the Potrero and
bounded by Slariposa, Sierra. Tennessee
and Iowa streets, will be conveyed to the
Santa Fe Railroad Company. For somo
time the Santa Fe has been tmrchastns
lots to secure the material with which to
fill in the China Basin. Captain A. H.
Payson has acted for the company, em
ploying the firm of Baldwin & Howell,
real estate brokers, to acquire the needed
property. In the tract are high hills which
have all the material required, estimated,
to be about 2,500,000 cubic yards, which,
can be made to contribute to the Im
provement of the basin at a nominal cost.
The filling of the basin will cost about
$500,000, but this Is for the labor mainly.
The removal of the hills will improve the
tract upon which they stand and add to
the valuable holdings of the company.
There are about fifty dwellings to be
moved. Property that would be affected
by the changing of the grades of streets
which will result from the company's ope
ration in connection with the filling of the
basin was purchased. A striking change
will be effected in the Potrero. which will
be made practically level south of Eight
eenth street from Indiana east. The
money to be paid for the many properties
bought will amount to about $500,000. so
that the expenditure of about $1,000,000 la
Involved altogether. "When the work is
done the houses that now stand on hills
will be upon level lots, surrounded by
improved streets. A large force of men
will be employed for a considerable pe
riod.
The principal sellers are as follows
Pacific Improvement Company, Mrs. Emma
Livingston, the Potrero Land and Improvement
Company, Bertha Bloominsdale. Potrero Land
and Water Front Company, John O. Reis, N.

vide that any such license shall cease

ASSEMBLY BILL 456, "which

very clever joker,* too. In the light of
this proposition sent to thousands of retail
liquor dealers in counties other than San
Francisco, the people will begin to see the
true inwardness" of the cunning legisla
tion:
I hereby appoint.. and such
counsel as he may select, to test the power of
the Board of Supervisors of: County
to Impose a license tax upon the business now
carried on by the undersigned within the
municipality of and in the
even that said business is relieved of the pay
ment of such license tax now imposed by said
Board of Supervisors, ' and a final determination
be obtained from the Supreme Court of Cali

Coward and Weber were the original man
â¢Lgers of the company, but when we found that
they could not be trusted, myself. Mr. Ellert
and Mr. Lackmann deposed them and took
charjre of the business. We have devoted many
months to perfecting the plant, building the
mill and developing its business arrangements
without salary or any compensation whatever.
My own time has been devoted almost exclu
sively to this business an<i it is with a view
to petting control of the company, now in a
prosperous and healthy condition, that this suit
has been brought. I do not believe that Mr.
I>ingee or Mr. Henshaw are leading in this
movement, nor are they aware of the true facts
of the case. If they were I am satisfied that
they would not countenance this suit, which is
purely. In my Judgment, a blackmail and ma
licious affair. We shall meet the Issues at the
proper time and dispose of them in court.
A temporary injunction, restraining Ber
teling. Ellert and Lackmann from dispos
ing of any of their stock, wee issued yes
terday by Judge Dunne and made return
able before Judge Murasky Friday.
When the Continental Company was organized
the salt business wre dead. Coward had been
running a little establishment without making
much progress and it was this business which
we purchased. Later on the saltmakers or
r&nlzed a combination and succeeded in raising
the price. It is this circumstance which now
Impels Coward and Weber to bring this ac
tion. They think salt making is becoming
profitable and they desire to break or black
mail their way into the business. '.
This action is in the nature of blackmail.
For months Coward and Weber have been seek
in? to get control of the company, and in doing
eo they have resorted to all sorts of dishon
orable tactics. It is utterly false that the stock
of this company is now or ever was worth
52 50 a fchare. Within a month I have offered
to sell Dingee and Henshaw all my stock for
to cents a chare. When we purchased this stock
at C5 cents it was worth nothing and Coward
and Weber knew that as well as I do. At that
time they could have had all ol it they wanted
at 25 cents, and 23 cents is all that their stock
L. A. Berteling, president of the Con
tinental Company, Issued the following
statement yesterday:
Bertelingfs Statement.
"The rerolution for the sale was passed
at a stockholders 1 meeting at which all
the stock. 16S.5C0 shares, was represent
ed. All of it was voted for the resolution
except thf 4003 shares held by Weber.
Cowcrd voted lor the sale, but he has
since been deposed as manager, and that
is why he is against us now.
"Berteling, Ellert and myself have put
In all th,e money that has been expended
in this enterprise, except $1000 invested by
Weber. We have not levied assessments
nor In any way gone about this as if we
were trying to freeze out. or embarrass
Weber or Coward. Our acts have been
regular and honorable. "We have given
our time to this without a cent of recom
pense either in salaries or dividends."
"On June 12 Mr. Andreano. who is as
sociated with Mr. Hess, told me that the
above things had been told to him by
Weber, who had requested him to tell
me. Andreano had told Weber that Mr.
Hess was better acquainted with me and
he would better get Hess to tell me those
things."
In regard to the transaction which the
plaintiffs characterize as looting Lack
mann asserts that it was not even an at
iÂ«npt to freeze out the smaller stock
holders. He explains that when the com
pany was formed it was agreed that Cow
ard should hold one-third of the stock Is
sued, Berteling a third. Ellert a sixth and
himself a sixth, approximately. Weber's
holding- was ;ibout one-fortieth of the to
tal. All of Coward's was issued to him,
and to keep the proposition as agreed
upon it was decided to issue to Berteling,
Ellert and Lackmann 76.V00 shares more,
at 25 cents per share, or half the par
value â the valuation that had been placed
upon the first itsue of 168,500 shares. In
payment lor these shares Berteling, Ellert
and Lackmann gave promissory notes,
which, they claim, can be collected upon
any time that the company needs the
money for furtaer increase in the plant.
"On June 3 William T. Hess, the attor
ney, cunc to see me and stated that Os
car T. Weber had requested him to tell
me that they. would give me $5000 for my
stock in the Continental Salt and Chem
ical Company and would also take up my
note and that Weber had said that if I
took that everything would be all right,
but if not, then they would bring suit
agrainst Berteling, Ellert and myself. He
had alEO stated to Mr. Hess that it would
look pretty bad tor the Sheriff to be mixed
up in a lawsuit and had said that I could
not afford it on account of being in pol
itics.
Would Be Bad for the Sheriff.
"Weber and Coward were the promoters
in the organization of the corporation.
They interested Berteling and Eilert, and
as a friend of theirs I went into the propo
sition also. Weber had it planned out
that he was to he secretary with no work
to do but draw a salary of $100 per month.
We Â¦would not have it that way. and con
sequently he har. been a constant source
of trouble.
Sheriff Lackmjnn charges that the suit
of William T. Dingee, William G. Hen-
Bhaw and Oscar T. Weber against him
self, L. A. Berteling and L. R. Ellert for
$171,000 for damages for the alleged loot
ing of the Continental Salt and Chemical
Company, has behind it acts on the part
of Weber which border closely upon
blackmail. He asserts that Weber has at
tempted to secure advantages which he
could not get otherwise by playing upon
the Sheriff's fear that charges against
him. however unfounded, might hurt him
politically.
"The plaintiffs allege." Sheriff Lack
mann said yesterday, "that by irregular
transactions we have inflicted damage
upon them to t!;c amount of $171,000. Now,
as a matter of fart, tlie valuation placed
upon the rait works at Alvarado, which
we acquired of H. C. Coward, was but $20,
000. and that was four times its actual
value. We have spent more than $20,000
on a new' building and machinery, but
operations have not begun, and there
could not possibly have been such finan
cial damages inflicted upon the plaintiffs.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The announcement that appeared exclu
sively In The Call, yesterday that the
Southern Pacific Company would Institute
injunction proceedings against the local
ticket brokers or "scalpers", to restrain
them from selling Epworth League tickets
caused a great sensation In railroad
circles. The representatives of the law de
partment of the Southern Pacific filed the
papers â¢ yesterday morning and shortly
afterward Judge F. H. Dunne issued a
temporary injunction restraining all
ticket brokers from, selling Epworth
Leagne tickets. .
A. Ottinger, who is really the only
broker who will make a fight in the case,
was served with the injunction about 2
o'clock yesterday. afternoon and then his
troubles began. Ottinger says that he
will still continue to sell tickets and that
he intends to fight the case. His first
move will be to get the injunction dis
solved. He rang up Judge John Garber
over the telephone and requested him to
take charge of the suit. Garber replied
that his connections, with the Southern
Pacific Company were close and that he
could not give Ottinger the benefit of his
services. It is more than probable that
Garret McEnerney will take the case for
Ottinger.
As soon as Judge Dunne had issued the
injunction ho assigned the case to Judge
Murasky's court and arguments to set
aside the restraining order will probably
come up on Thursday.
Attorney Walker of the Southern Pacific
law department, who is handling the
case for . the corporation, yesterday
said that he is confident the in
junction will be rcade perpetual. The
Supreme Court has decided similar actions
in favor of the railroad companies on sev
eral occasions. He claims that a person
who buys a railroad ticket at a scalper's
office and boards a train to ride on a
ticket representing himself . as some one
else is performing an illegal act. He
said yesterday that last year the same
case came up at Nashville, Tenn., over
excursion tickets and that a perpetual in
junction was granted.

As soon as the creditors of the woman
learned that she was about to bid them
good-by and go they notified the Chinese
Six Companies and that corporation laid
the matter before United States District
Attorney "Woodworth. The time for
Leone's deportation expired yesterday,
but Woodworth ordered her to> be held
in custody pending hearing on a felony
charge. If convicted and punished by im
prisonment she will be rearrested on the
expiration of her term of sentence and
will be deported to China on the confes
sion made by her to the bureau.
The Chinese Six Companies have inter
fered in the matter of the deportation of
Leong "Woon Ho, who surrendered herself
to the Chinese Bureau July 8. and thereby
hangs a tale.
It appears that the woman was the
keeper of a slave den on Sullivan alley
and that for two or three weeks prior to
her surrender she used her credit for all
it was worth, borrowing money from
friends and tradespeople .until she had
piled up an indebtedness amounting to
nearly $3000.
Then she caused a message to be con
veyed by a trusted Chinaman to Chinese
Inspector Gardner to the effect that she
was a slave and had been landed in this
country on perjured testimony as a native
born Callfornian. She added that she
was tired of the life of a slave and wished
to return to China, there to spend the
remainder of her days in some Christian
mission home or until a good Christian
husband could be found for her.
Dr. Gardner almost wept with Joy at
the prospect of snatching this yellow
brand from the burning and In accordance
with the plan proposed thy the pseudo
MagdalenÂ© he descended upon the den
with a posse and rescued her. Leong
was then taken before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock and re
peated the message that she had sent to
the Chinese Bureau. She was thereupon
ordered deported to China at the expense
of the Government.

MEN WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE TROUBLESOME LI
CENSE LAW. Â¦
The fact is clearly established that' the
Kelley amendment or new section was not
proposed to avert prohibition, as the Su
preme Court had fully passed on Â¦ that
point. Everything points directly . to the
conclusion that the scheme was concocted
and put through the Legislature to - divest
Boards of Supervisors and. municipal gov
erning bodies of the power. to impose any
license for revenue.- Perhaps the framers
had in mind the lucrative business now
under way, for it seems a sure. thing that
the lawyers, with the law fixed,- have a
mortal : cinch to win.- It is no wonder,
therefore, that the solicitor of legal busi
ness allows the saloon-keeper .to insert
this provision in the agreement: -v.-
: It being distinctly. understood and agreed that
I advance nothing for costs or' counsel fees and
in no way become liable therefor;' unless said
No Licenses for Revenue.
In another of the Merced cases (Helm
& Nolan respondents) the Supreme. Court
declared that under the provisions of the
county government act giving power to
license for the purposes of regulation and
revenue all and every kind of business' not
prohibited by law prohibition cannot be
effected, and the very terms of the power
preclude the exercise to such an extent as
to prevent the carrying on of the business.
The power to license and regulate the sale of
liquors for the purposes of revenue is distinct
from the power to prohibit such sales, and an
ordinance which ! in terms proceeds . under the
power to regulate and to impose a license tax,
but in its effect amounts to an exercise of the
power of prohibition, cannot be upheld.
In one of the Merced cases decided by
the Supreme Court January 21, 1896, it
was declared that: . . â¢Â¦ .
The authority of the Board of Trustees to
Impose fees for the purpose of revenue does not
warrant their being made Â¦ so heavy as to be
prohibitory.
In ex parte J. E. Haskell on habeas
corpus, April 14, 189G, the Supreme Court
held:
Justice Harrison , wrote the opinion.
Justices De Haven, Fitzgerald, Van Fleet
and Chief Justice Beatty concurred. -
We are clearly of the opinion that the ordi
nance of the Board of Supervisors of Kings
County is inoperative within the- city of Han
ford, and that the petitioner Is illegally-re
strained of his liberty and must be ' discharged,
and It Is so ordered. . .Â».-...;
By the organization of , a . city within the
boundaries of a county the territory thus organ
ized is withdrawn from the legislative control
of the county upon the designated subjects, /and
is placed under the legislative control of its own
council. [.-..:, :";.'â¢
' The petitioner .was released from arrest,
the court holding: . â¢ . -
The petitioner is held by the Sheriff of Kings
County under a warrant of arrest issued by a
Justice of the Peace of Lucerne Township in
that county, upon a complaint charging him
with having sold at his saloon in the city of
Hanford certain intoxicating liquors, in viola
tion of an ordinance of the Board of Supervis
ors of Kings County. The ordinance which the
petitioner is charged with violating is entitled,
"An ordinance for the purpose of regulation, re
lating to saloons and other places where intox
icating liquors are sold." The city of Hanford
is a municipal corporation of.- the sixth, class,
organized under the municipal government act
of April 13, 18S3, and had prior to August 13, 18S4.
passed an ordinance providing for the issuance
of licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors.
The petitioner had complied with the.provis
ions of this ordinance, and had received â¢ from
the city "of Hanford a license to carry on the
business of retailing liquor within that city.
It is contended on the part of the ' petitioner
that he is illegally held, for the reason that
the Supervisors of Kings County are without
any police authority within the city of .Hanford;
that the ordinance passed by that body under
which he was arrested is limited in its opera
tion to those portions of the county not Includ
ed within the boundaries of any municipality
therein.
Important Supreme Court Rulings.
â¢ The Supremo Court in its decision de
clared: .
A Kings County case decided by the Su
preme Court September 29, 1894, is .relied
upon to sustain the lawyers who are can
vassing for agreements. In the matter of
William- M. Roach on habeas corpus, the
court ruled: >.
Significant words in the new law are
these: "And for the purpose of regulation
as herein provided AND NOT OTHER
WISE, shall have power to license," etc.
When the law as "jokered" is read in
connection with Supreme Court decisions
one can see why attorneys agree to
charge nothing if they fail to win in the
courts.
