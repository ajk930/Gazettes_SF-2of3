/ i AND DAMAGED' ANOTHER BEFOEE BEING DISPERSED. :
BETWEEN 700 and 800 men of
the Forty-fifth and Forty
sixth Volunteers participated
In a rlct at the Lombard
etreet entrance to the Pre
sidio grates last night that re-
suited in the complete demo
lition of the ealoon at the corner of Green
wich and Baker ' streets, .kept by. Mrs.
Mary Powers. Considerable damage alco
was done to White & Crowley's saloon,
and but for the bravery of three police
officers the riot would have ended in the
murder of helpless women. { S*he trouble
was the culmination of an attempted rob
bery of a soldier earlier In the day. -
The Forty-sixth Regiment was paid. off
In the morning and mustered out of the
service. With hundreds of dollars in their
pockets, the discharged men started out
to celebrate their release from military
eervice. The saloons In the vicinity of. the
Presidio were visited and it was not long
ere many of the ex-soldlers fell into the
hands of the "sharks" who infest the en
trances to the Presidio on payday.
About 4 p. m. two men of the Forty
sixth Regiment were found by -some of
their comrades in a comatose condition
near the Lombard-street gate of the res
ervation. The men were taken Into the
camp of the Forty-fifth Regiment and
were treated. When they came to their
senses they told a story of being drugged
and robbed in a saloon.
The men of the Forty-fifth j Regiment
Â¦were soon in possession of the â¢ details of
th^ victims' stories, and with repetition
the occurrence was distorted and magni
fied. It waa even rumored that the two
men had died.
SOLDIER FOUND XnrCOlTSCIOTJS.
Abcut 7 p. m. two men of Company G,
Forty-fifth Infantry, found a. man' named
Morgan, a private of the Forty-sixth;In
.ftnto't lying on the sidewalk^ near -thÂ»
junction of Greenwich and Baker, streets
covered with blood. Captain Loye of the
Forty-fifth Regiment was passing on a
car and went to their assistance and had
Morgan conveyed to the camp of his com
pany. He found $175 In Morgan's pockets,
and the soldiers who first discovered the
unconscious man said that " two civilians
bad tried to rob him, but that they had
driven them off. Medical aid was given
to Morgan and he revived sufficiently to
talk, but could give no clear account of
what had happened to him during tho
evening. ' Â¦
Â¦ Again the men of the Forty-fifth Regi
ment heard a 6tory of an attempt to rob a
comrade, and knowing that they would bo
paid off next Monday and that similar at
tempts might be made to rob them, they
at once proceeded to form a plan to wipe
out the saloons In the vicinity of the Lom
bard street entrance to the Presidio where
the soldiers feared they might be de
spoiled.
About 7:30 p. m. Police Officers Hogan
and Jackson observed groups of soldiers
standing at the corner of Greenwich and
Baker streets. The officers scented trouble,
as the soldiers moved away- each '. tlmo
they approached the groups of uniformed
men.

Riot Grows Out. of Rumors That Two Volunteers of the
Forty-Sixth Infantry Had Died After Being Given
"Knockout" Drops in the Place and Robbed of Money
ALTURAS, May 31.â Flvo men lynched for petty thievery! Swift and
awful was the vengeance visited upon a quintet of culprits by a
Modoc County mob last night. ,Hanging to the stringers of a bridge
, on the outskirts ot Lookout, a town ten miles west of Adin.
the bodies of "Calvin Hall, two of his three sons and another young
,. man who had shared his home, are still swaying In the breeze.
From a culvert between the town and the bridge the body of tha
third son Is suspended^ Shorter shrift was accorded him than to the others of
the lynchers' victims, because he fought for his life. â¢
The mob was In no mood to be delayed. Halting long enough to choke- out
the .life of Frank Hall, it proceeded on its way to the place selected for the execu
tion* There, the father and; his remaining two sons and their comrade were put
to death. No. tlmo was wasted. The victims. of the mob's vengeance were not
even given the opportunity of making a farewell statement., * One by one they
wtre stretched "up,- willing hands pulling at the" ropes , that hauled them Into
eternity.'. ; V- :
!â¢ Never in the history of California has there^been such wholesale punishment
as this meted out to "frontier offenders. 'And their crime had not attained even
the dimensions of horse-stealingâ always a' capital "offense in those counties yet on
the borderland of civilization. They were petty thieves, no more: their booty wa3
tho "proceeds of nocturnal raids upon clotheslines and woodsheds.
STOLEN ABTIGLIS POUND IN THKIK.HOME.
Calvin Hall was 72 years of ageâ aa old raan' tottering: on the verge of the
grave. .He, was a squaw-man,, and his threa sons â Frank,' aged C6; James, aged 19,
and Martin, aged 16â were the half-breed progeny of his life-union with an Indian
woman.' B.' D. Yaritis; :'JwKo shared the' Hall home, was i 27 years old.
For sometime past the Halls and Yantis have been suspected of the thefts
of numerous articles,- such : as 'barbea wire, pieces of harness and articles cf rai
ment taJfejv* from, the clotheslines 'jot Lookout. 1 ; They were arrested on 'Saturday
-and'coay.WMeaj^
search served to bring* to Hgnt* evl.>ncebf . their : guilt,- and they were taken "from
the Hall ranch - ; tt>*,X*iokout and there, detained In custody to-' await - examination
and trial. ..In the meantlmo the search was . continued, and halters, dishes and
more articles ' of clothing were lound hidden away. ( The simple and honest popu
lace .was aroused to the highest pitch of excitement 83 one by one tha stolen ar
ticleswere restored" to their owners. , From the day of the arrest of the culprits
there have been. muttered threats, 'and (the "Halls and Yantis knew that only a
leader was needed- to ; place their lives in jeopardy.
The aged father was chargedwith petty larceny, consisting of the pilfering of
several hayforks only,' and he was allowed to" go, free on hl3 own recognizance.
His arraignment was to have taken place this morning. The other four faced
burglary charges, and their examinations were set for June 3. They remained In
custody, having^ been unable* to procure the ,$300 ball demanded by the Justice
of'the Peace before. whom they had been brought
There being no jail in Lookout the four prisoners' were, held In custody in tha
Ixtokout hotel.'- In guarding 'them Constable Carpenter was assistad by R.
Nichols.'J.W., Brown and S. Goyette. .The former two remained on duty from
noon until midnight, when they were relieved by ; the others. Calvin Hall re
mained as a guest of the hotel, no a-Â» to be near his sons. .
MOB OF : LY1TCHER.S OVERCOMES THE OFFICERS.
:Â¦ At 2 o'clock this morning a mob.of. masked men, their number variously es
timated at from thirty to ~ fifty, . suddenly appeared In the street before .the
hotel. : No hint of their comlng'had been given and the two men on guard were
taken completely : by surprise. No attempt to spirit the prisoners away to a
place of safety or to defend them fromthe mob was possible. Brown and Goy
ette faced the. overwhelming odds of two scpre of determined men well armed.
They looked into, the muzzles of rifles and shotguns held by. steady hands, and
gruff' voices from behind the; masks ordered. them bluntly to keep still if they
were not ready to ; die. The two guards were powerless to make resistance
and they attempted none. , :
While some were disarming Brown and Goyette, others of the mob broke In
upon. the accused men and dragged them from their quarters. The masked men
knew their gTound thoroughly, and lost no time in rounding up the frightened
quintet. The old man. Calvin Hall,' was dragged 3 from his bed and hurried out
and thrust into position b>% the side' of his sons, while preparations were under
way for the grim, march to the Pitt River bridge,. which had been chosen for the
scene of the mob's terrible vengeance.
-The hands of each of the accused men were "bound securely behind him, and
a rope was noosed about the heck of each. The mob worked swiftly and silently
in the dim light of lanterns and torches, and few words were heard except the
entreaties of the doomed 'men, begging for their lives.
GTJAIRDS ABE FORCED TO AID THE . AVEJTGERS.
: :' "Now come with, us," one of the leaders said to the two guards. "We need
your help." And Brown and Goyette were shoved Into the ranks of men holding
the ropes that tightened about the necks of the trembling prisoners. â¢
: The mob moved swiftly and silently through the streets and along the road
leading to the bridge that spans Pitt River. There was no hesitancy or discus
sion. The details" were well planned and had been decided upon at the mob's
rendezvousâ whereveV that may, , have beenâ for the coming of the mob and its
going after tho lynching was done are veiled in mystery.
Frank Hall, the" oldest of the three sons, stopped pleading when tha merci
less purpose of ,the vigilantes . became evident." He set ' his teeth with i the grim '
Btoicism of his mother's race, and refused to proceed. He fought his captors
â¢with the "strength of despair, "and, even after he had been choked almost' into
unconsciousness. by the tightening noose he still offered stubborn resistance.
Â¦ The mob was in no mood for wasting Its time with a refractory, victim, and
the 'struggling prisoner was dragged and tumbled alons to aculvert over a deep
gulch conveniently, near. The rope was made fast/ and youns Hall was pushed
from the 'roadway Into -the gulch; with a sheer drop that left- little life in his
body. .When his executioners became . assured that the swinsing body was past
resuscitation; they^ dragged \ the old man and his remaining , two sona and Yantia
a way f rom 't he : sight of the fate that was: to be theirs. and* hastened - on to

lONTSTERS SATISFIED
WITH CHINA'S ACCEPTANCE
One Phrase in the Note That May
Cause Some Delay in.
Evacuation.
PEKING, May 31 âChina's uncondi
tional acceptance of 450,000,000 taels as
the indemnity to be paid the powers has
caused great satisfaction among the for
eign Ministers, as it leaves practically a
few minor details to complete the nego
tiations.
The phrase in the joint note Vto the
satisfaction of the powers" may cause
some delay in the evacuation of Chinese
territory, as the Ministers fall to see
how China can guarantee payment, and
as all the Minsters beiieve it would be a
mistake to have a large body of foreign
officials collecting revenue. â¢ Were reve
nue thus collected over 2000 officials would
be required, and the aggregate salaries
of these men would be very large and
amount to more than the ordinary Chl
nÂ«-pe "squeeze."
The majority of the Ministers now fa
vor raising the customs to 10 per cent
and taking 5,000,000 taels yearly from the
Hkin tax. This method would give, after
the payment of interest on foreign Â¦ debts
now existing, about 23,000,003 taels a year.
The Ministers would agree to this sys
tem if China will discontinue the col
lection of all likln duties on foreign
goods.

There has been friction for some time.
While drilling yesterday a guardsman in

CALL BUREAU, 1406G STREET, N. W.,
;WASHINQTON, J May, 31.â Attorney Gen

for the President' as to the â¢bearing of the

Â¦At a "meeting of (the; Cabinet to-day the
Attorney^.Qeneral announced that 'it â¢: was
his opinion,,; '.without..'., having
carefully examined the official. text of the
decisions of Hhe court, that ''the decision'
would' not necessitate any -change in the
pre&enf course' of the Government as to
the collection ; of these dutres. He said,
however, that this was not his final opin
ion, . and after the matter had been < dis
cussed briefly it- was decided that Mr.
Griggs J should: prepare a written" opinion
to be adopted for. the guidance of the ad
ministration until the decision of the
Philippines case is announced by . the
court. - v
It is understood. that the Attorney Gen
eral and Secretary of War Hoot will col
laborate in the preparation of this - opin
ion,' as Mr. Root has devoted a great deal
of study to the legal', aspect -of -the rela

There is little doubt among the mem
bers of the administration as to the power
of the President under the authority dele
gated to him by the Spooner amendment
to the army appropriation bill to- promul
gate a tariff in the Philippines which will
be perfectly valid, but there is consider*
able more doubt as to the right to collect
duties under; the Dlngley law on imports
from the Philippines or as to the author
ity of the President to promulgate a'spe
cial'tariff on goods Imported from those
islands. 1 -, 1 Â¦ , â¢â¢ â¢ Â¦ . , - i , â¢ :'-. . I : Â¦Â¦.'.
The administration Is not greatly dis
turbed'by the suggestion that goods from
other countries will .be, shipped -into the

United States,' where duties will be paid
under : protest â¢ in the ; hope ' of having Â¦ the
money refunded when' the Supreme Court
decision in Â¦â¢the : Philippines case is an
nounced. This . plan could . proba-bly .be
spoiled by putting t.up . duties on these

The blocks in the vicinity! of the sa

not stop their comrades. -
"They are our men," said one sentry,
when asked why he allowed the soldiers
to run past the guard. lines. ' .

by the police officers, is a private in Troop

the riot and said: j ' -" Â¦ .
"1 am out on a pass/until to-morrow at

accused me of being one of the men who
had given knockout drops to some sol
diers in the afternoon. They 'would not
listen to reason, but acted like wild men.
I owe my life to the police officers. If it
had not been for their bravery I would be
a dead man now." â¢ - Â¦ Â¦ ' :
Harris was badly cut about the face and
bruised all over his body. Mrs. Powers
Â¦was also seen in the apartments above
her wrecked saloon after â¢ the riot. In
speaking of the occurrence ehe said:
"I have always been kind to the boys
and have conducted my place orderly. I
cannot imagine ; why they should attack
me and wreck my place. My license
would have expired to-morrow night. The
soldiers called me the vilest of names and
threatened to kill me and every onÂ© ' in
the place. The saloon was my only sup
port and I have a family to look after.
One of my daughters was almost knocked
down by a big rock that was thrown
through the window of her room. What
a lot of cowards these men are to attack
a woman. I will demand satisfaction for
the damage done and shall see my law
yers in the morninr." - }
Mrs. Powers estimated the damage at
$2000. Not a thing was left Intact In tho
saloon. The doors were wrenched off their
hinges; the bar and fixtures were split to
kindling wood: the gasjets were torn
down; kegs of beer and bottles of whisky
were emptied all over the place: chairs
and tables were demolished and the till
was robbed of $20, the receipts of , the
night. "When the attack occurred Bar
tender Charles Keenan fled with Mrs.
Powers to the upper part of the house,'
The officers of the Forty-fifth Kcgi

fused to give any information. ' . . J

' the action of the Cuban Constitu
tional .Convention .on the Platt amend
ment defining, future relations between

isfactory, to the administration, this dis
patch was sent as the result of to-tlay'a
Cabinet" meeting, \ in which the action; of
the: Cuban convention was discussed at
length. ..; Secretary Root had with him
the full text of the document the Cuban
convention adopted as an appendix to the
provisions of the Platt amendment. He
has not yet made this document public,
but it is known that it is unsatisfactory
in many ways, and is "of such a character
that the President'could not construe it
as Justifying the withdrawal of the mil
itary government- if he wished to do so.
The Interpretation and "limitations placed
by the Cubans on several of the articles
or the .Platt amendment. are declared en
tirely ; Inconsistent of the text of those
articles. " , â¢ â¢
p| Objects of Articles Defeated.
Tho 'fifth "article of the Platt amend
ment, which stipulates that Cuba will
execute'and, as far as necessary, extend
the plans "already devised or other plans
to be mutually agreed upon for the sani
tation of the cities' of the island. Is so
modified as to exclude the requirement
for the execution of such plans as might
be agreed upon in the future. .This de
feats the. object of : the article, which Is
to. insure the carrying out of a plan of
sanitation at least as effective as that
which has been adopted* by the' military
government. - * .
- It is regarded as being essential to the
prevention of the spread of infectious
and' contagious diseases from Cuba to the
United States that there shall be no re
laxation , in the sanitation of . the island,
and that a guarantee of effective sanita
tion shall not be left to i he chance of a
satisfactory agreement -being reached af
ter :-Â¦ the ' Cuban " Government shall .have
.been set up. Â¦Â¦..â¢. Â¦ Â¦ Â« Â¦
'.;.- The sense of article 7, providing for the
sale or : lease to the United States of
naval and coaling stations- has been, it is
hold, entirely perverted by the Cubans.
Instead of making it provide that Cuba
"will" sell or lease, it it- provided that
she- "may . sell or lease, thus making it
â¢optional for the Cuban' Government to do
so or not. The administration will insist
that this -be changed so that there shall
be no-option about it. - Â¦ â¢ .-.
Intervention in Contingencies.
. The most' objectionable of all to the
administration is the action of the con
vention on article 3, which provides' for
intervention, by ' the United States in Cu
ban affairs to certain contingencies. Part
of the supplemental- document devoted to
this -article * is- so involved that It was
difficult for the President and his advis
ers to determine just what It meant. It
is regarded as so interpreting the Platt
amendment as to entirely . pervert j its
meaning. â¢ ,

delegates are incorporated. The adminis
tration .objects to this because the pro
priety of quoting the Secretary of War
as to his understanding of them is doubt
ed and because they bear evidence of the
delegates having misunderstood the sec
retary. It is said that ideas have been
attributed to Secretary Root which noth
ing he said would warrant.
It Is not believed by the administration
or*" by those Senators who have been
called in consultation that there is any
prospect that Congress will *n any way
change the Platt amendment* to nuke it
more acceptable to the Cubans, and It la
hoped- that when the Cuban delegates
realize that the President Is without
power to change the terms, and that
Congress is without a disposition to do
so, there will be little delay in. accepting
the . amendment without the impossible
interpretations applied to It.

Cuban Delegates Say the Convention
Cannot Recede.
HAVANA, May 3LâThe N decision of the
United States Government not to accept
the Cuban constitution as adopted by tho
Havana convention caused, great surprise
and keen disappointment to those mem
bers of the convention who voted for th*
constitution as adopted. Two leading
Conservatives who were Interviewed to
night on the subject said in substance
that they had reason to suppose that the
constitution would be acceptable to Wash
ington, and that otherwise they would
not have voted for the majority- report a.3
submitted. .They aL>o pointed out that in
order to avoid a possibility of rejection the
majority report had been changed "at tha
last moment by striking out the Interpre
tation at the end of the clauses end put
ting these In the form of a resolution by
themselves, thus accepting the i Plait
amendment) as passed by Congress.
"It is true," said one of the:Conserva
tlves in question, "that the committee in
terpretations of tha explanations of the
Teller resolution which were offered by
Governor General Wood and Secretary
Root, together with the Washington com
mission's report, were Included with the
Platt amendment as an appendix to tho
constitution; but when we voted on the
report it was but with one purpose in
view, napieiy, to accept the Platt amend
ment." . <i- Â¦:.:Â¦ .i-f
Both delegates expressed regret that a
misunderstanding had arisen, and said
they doubted that the. convention would
now reconsider its action, as the fight haJ
been hot. the victory had, been won by
on!? one vote, and those who had tried
to do their duty toward their country had
been bitterly assailed as traitors and per
jurers.
Senors Capote and Tamayo had a long
conference with General Wood to-night.
General Wood, in the course of a brief
interview, said:
"I never understood that the explana
tions of Secretary Root would be incor
porated in the acceptance. I always con
sidered that the convention .regarded
these explanations as explanations mere
ly, and that they would not form part.of
the acceptance." V--

LONDON, May 31.â On the anniver
sary of Lord Roberts' entry into
Johannesburg the country has
been startled by the news of des
perate fighting and heavy British
losses within forty miles, of the Gold Reef
city. The battle at Vladfontein, on the
Durban-Johannesburg Railroad, reported
by Lord Kitchener to-day, is the most se
rious engagement since General Clements'
reverse at Magalcsburg. It shows that
General Delarey is in no way daunted by
the capture of eleven of his guns by Gen
eral Bablngton six weeks ago.
The garrison of Vladfontein, apparently
largely composed of yeomanry, had 174
men put out of action. That their assail
ants came to close quarters and suffered
heavy loss is shown by the number of
cead left on the field.
FAILS TO GAIN
NEEDED STRENGTH
Most Grave - Feature in
Mrs. McKinley's
Sickness.
WASHINGTON. May SLâ The physi
cians who are In attendance upon Mrs.
McKinley after a consultation this fore
noon issued the following statement of
her condition:
Mrs. McKlnley Is recovered from the fatigue
of the trip. The illness from which she was
pufferinsr in San Francisco still continues,
though in less intense form. She is still feeble
and cannot be considered out of danger. Her
progress win no doubt be slow, but Improve
ment Is looked for.
P. M. RIXET. M. D.
GEORGE M. STERJCBERG. M. D.
W. W. JOHNSTON. M. D.
Mrs. McKinley failed to show any im
provement during the day, and to-night
her condition is reported as unchanged
from the status given in the bulletin
issued during the morning. One of the
grave features of the ; case is the fact that
she continues extremely \seafe and fails
to gain in strength. She Is very seriously
111, but has had severe attacks of Illness
heretofore, and this gives rise to the hope
that she will yet show improvement. No
bulletin vras issued to-night and none will
be until after the consultation of the
physicians to-morrow. Both Drs. Stern
ber? and Rixey called daring the evening
at separate times, the latter remaining
â¢ with the patient a long while.
DEL MONTE, May 31.â Dr. Hirschf elder
was seen here to-day in regard to a report
from "Washington that he had stated that
Mrs. McKlnley cannot recover. He de
nied absolutely that he had made any
such statement, and said:
"I have made no statement at any time
concerning the case of Mrs. McKinley,
other than those contained in the official
bulletins published by Mr. Cortelyou, and
I have absolutely nothing to say now re
garding the case."

\m ,v^ OR the second time In the aacred
I dramatic history of America Cali
|f~*^-fornia has had the unique honor
JJL .. of producing the only modern Pas
sion Play existent west of Ober
arr.mergrau.
The playgoer* of a score of yea& ago
will well remember the first production of
the sacred drama in San Francisco, writ
ten by Salmi B. Morse and given at the
Grand Opera-house by the notable com
pany of players then associated with the
old Baldwin Theater. The play created
an enormous sensation. From the.bitter
est denunciation to an almost worshipful
partisanship public feeling was aroused to
highest pitch. The house was crowded
nightly with Jews and Christians, Protes
tants and Catholics, atheists and bigots,
ministers and laymenâ all alike profound
ly interested in the attempt of the modern
actor to picture the sacred story.
No expense was spared on the produc
tion, which cost "Lucky" Baldwin a cool
$40,000 to put on the stage. The costumes
were on a satisfying scale of splendor,
with settings and mechanical appliances
of the best that could then be procured.
An orchestra of 200 pieces was engaged,
performing ' among other numbers tho
Rossini "Stabat Mater" and. say those
who .were present, doing excellent servica
In the creation of the necessary aolemnity
of atmosphere.* No applause was permit
ted, and the sable draperies of the thea
ter and black-edged programmes added
still further to the dignity and unusual
ness of the occasion. Nothing', in short,
was left undone that could lend sacred
ness, truth, beauty, or dignity to the play,
and only the ever open question of the
propriety \ of human representation of di
vinity remained to be settled.
, Archbishop McCloskey. to whom the au
thor and "Lucky" Baldwin had submitted
the manuscript of the play, was gener
ously appreciative of its possibilities, en
tirely in sympathy with its standpoint
and hopeful of Its spiritual effect. Other
important ecclesiastical authority was
similarly encouraging, and it was with the
most sanguine expectations that author,
actors and manager presented for the first
i time before an American audience the
sacred story of our Lord's life and death.
1 Among those in the cast of the play
were James Nelll,. then a striking
! beautifulâ there is no other wordâ youn?
man. He was leading man in the Bald
win Stock Company, with Lewis Moorrison
as co-star, - and, according: to Mr. Morri
son, who is the only representative of the
famous cast now in town, was a noble
figure as the Christ, for which part he
was cast. â¢
"Neill was very nervous that first
night," says , Mr. Morrison. "Ho feared
riots and possible shooting, for crowds
followed us to the theater with all kinds
of friendly and unfriendly manifestations;
, but from the moment the curtain went
up, showing Christ -with his disciples, and
the opening words 'Let us pray' fell Into
the silence, the proper note was at once
struck and the play waa heard with a
rightful reverence from beginning to end.
"I was the Pilate â and never before fully
realized the high worth of the character,
by the wayâ and after the great speech,
'I have found no guilt in this man,' poor
Morse came to me and said: . 'Morrison,
you will never need to play another part
for all your life.' James A. Herne, or
Samuel Piercey, was the Herod; Mackey
the Juaas,-Forrest Robinson the Caiaphas,
Mary "Wlnkes Mary Magdalen, Olive West
Mary the Virgin. Five hundred people in
all appeared and each seemed to enter
fully Into the spirit of what was to all the
most memorable performance of their
lives.
"The Passion Play ran Just three weeks.
It offended the sensibilities of a large
number of the "unco guidf and Neill and
I were arrested nightly after it was over.
Every night we paid our $50, and Baldwin
offered to put up the fines by the week
to save time. Every day. too. we had to
stand trial, till the Nelll-Morrison case
became a standing Joke. Then the State
was petitioned against the play and finally
the President himself was approached and
the first Passion Play of America, died an
ignominious death.
"Afterward Henry E. Abbey, the New
York impresario, became Interested in the
production, bought the rights of It and
took over the principals to New York to
give the Passion Play there. But the New
York public would have none of It. Ab
bey had prophesied tnat Gotham's greater
breadth of outlook would insure its friend
ly reception in the East, but he was not
permitted to produce Morse's drama, at
all there. ' One private performance at
Proctor's Theater was given, with Henry
C. de Mille, then professor of English lit
erature at Columbia University, as the
Christ, and that ended the eventful his
tory. Tho , sequel is somewhat tragic.
Morsk the disappointed author 'of the
play, one week later committed suicide."

Thomas Rendl had the parts of St. John
and St. Fetor, following after their fath
ers, and Rosa Lang the part of Mary, the
Mother of, Jesus, following the other side
of her house. Johann Z wink; said to be
the most impressive actor I of the whole
group, twice took the -part "of. Judas,
which had frequently, before fallen to the
Zwinks. And so.it is with most. of the

From fathers to sons the obligation on
the community has been recognized, and
the vow faithfully accomplished, - with
few interruptions. And as the generation
coming has assumed the sacred duty of
the one passing, so in many cases the
son has been chosen for the particular
part performed on several successive de
cennials by the father, who, perhaps, in
like manner .followed the grand-father.
While there Is a redistribution of the
parts on each occasion, and they are in
no sense considered hereditary or belong
ing- to , any ono family- more than anoth
er, yet as the son derives from his father
by birth and constant association his ex
celling skill as a musician, sculptor, wood

three occasions, and then that of r the
High PriesfCaiaphasLthree.tim.es, up. to
1S90, in 1900 . retired from the cast while

ly in case of : the latter, and- he is said Uo
be an ; exact Â» counterpart of his - father i at

Lang, in 1900 took, the part of Herod; be-

ance, it is claimed,/ has no such deriva
tion. It dates from 1634, when it was In
stituted in accordance with a vow made
by the village in council in 1633, on ac
count of the pestilence caused by the
wars of Gustavus Adolphus, which pre
vailed over Central, Kurope. at that time."
Caspar Schuchler, a native of the village,
who had gone to the low country to
work, brought back the plague, which
threatened to depopulate the village, as
it had done elsewhere. The villagers met
in council' and made a vow that .if" the
sS'ourge was stayed they would every ten
years forever perform the play "for
thankful remembrance and edifying con
templation, and by the help of the_Al
mighty, of the sufferings of Jesus, the
Savior . of the world."
Until quite recently a few visitors from
Munich and other cities of Southern Ger
many, with the inhabitants of the neigh
boring mountain villages, formed devout
audiences before which were rendered
with pious fervor and devotion the pictur
esque scenes and impersonations of the
"Passions-Spiel." A few years have
wrought great changes. Until 1850' the
world at large knew nothing of Ober
ammergau and its PasEions-Splel. Then
Edward Devrient witnessed the perform
ance and on his return to the world pub
liihed an account of it. Others followed
him, and in 1SSO a number of magazines
snrt Journals of both America and ISurope
were represented at the performance.
Then the place was made. more accessible
by modern conveyance. Now the visitors
are numbered by the hundred thousand,
and what was for 200 years performed as
a sacred duty, and at some considerable
cost to the community, has become a
source of large revenue to the village. In
l*fr) some 200,000 people found their way to
the Passion Play village, and the receipts
for admission were over 700,000 marks, or
nearly 5175,000. and in 1900 these figures
were increased by nearly 70 per cent, the
visitors including devotees and tourists
from nearly every nationality in the
world. Oberammergau lies forty-five miles
southwest of Munich and by railroad and
ticliey line can now be reached In three
hours time. Unterammergau, six miles
below, and the old monastery of Extal,
nearly as far above, are its only near
neighbors. It stands 2600 feet above the
level of the sea and is overlooked by the
cross-surmounted Kofel Peak on the west,
giving i\ a close and wild background; It
has a population of some 2000 souls, | from
which al\ the actors and participants in
the sacred dramaâ some -700 in number â
are drawii - - â¢ . .
From th\s remote spot the real "Pas
elon Play" l^ias been brought to the notice
of the worll at large. Several other Ger
man and SVlss villages have plays and
representations of a religious nature, but
they, are oniy survivals of. the-."myste
ries" or mlricle - plays . common in con
tinental Eurt)e* and parts of England
quaint little old villages of Unter and
Ober Ammerrau have had little part in
history and no place at all on most maps.
And such would still undoubtedly be the
case but for the "Passion Play," which
has for nearly three centuries past been
produced at regular Intervals at the last
named place. *
Â»vÂ«r, Oberammergau and its unique re
ligious dramatic performance, the latter
jerving to Introduce both, have become

THE PASSION PLAY
OF OBERAMMERGAU

The whole cast â In all more than 125
boysâ is deserving 1 of praise. The play
was costumed very satisfactorily and the
Bcenlc appointments, painted by Michael
O'Sulllvan, a new member cf the profes
sion, are of high artistic value. The
etape management was in the capable
hands of Father Ford and things ivent
with unusual Emoothness for a first
night's performance.
And now, whether or not thin "Passion
Play*' has come to stay, and it is amply
rufSicient for its purpose, I think the au
thor could write such a "Passion Play"
with all but the central figure; with Mary
and the Magdalen and the careful Martha
and Salome, daughter of Herod, as the
women element, as should terve to satisfy
the neede of a larger public than that

Here, then, is the playwright's difficult
and delicate problem; to suggest the pro

Christ, as a flower is suggested by its
perfume, as the sun's light is suggested
by the moon, Mary, too, must be thus
fÂ«lt at least once in the sacred drama,
at the nativity, even if all the other wo
men of tiae New Testament must be omit
ted. Furthermore, the interpretation is
in the hands of a crowti of clever bu* in

teur institution, but lacking in many of
the conveniences of the professional plat
form, altogether an almost Qulxotically

Archelaus by Athelas, the remorse of
Judas and the rending of the Veil of the
Temple.
The play is divided into four "epochs"
and cine chapers, "the Star of Bethle
hem" suggesting the nativity opening the
cycle. The scene represents the plains of
Bethlehem and is a remarkably good ef
fort in the scenic line, by the way, and
the etar shines above the humble inn
Â¦where the tJavietrr he* come, and from
the hills above the shepherds are looking
down, upon, the small village of the Naza-
Tenes. To them come the wise men from
the East and emitsaries from Herod
tetking the new bern King.
Another pfcupesqim scene, is the second,
-.akiiitr place in Herod's court, where is
proclaimed the order for the slaughter of
the innocents, Judas then becomes the
central rig-ure and his 6uboming by the
high priebts and subsequent treachery is
the subject of the next three chapters.
"The Entry Into Jerusalem" is effective

"The Klse of Judas" Is related by the
Apostles and also the incidents of the

responsible for California, being
eble to claim the authorship of the only
two American passion plays, but such is
the Eufnciently remarkable fact. To the
genius of Clay M. Greene the produc
tion of the second sacred drama, "Naza
reth," is due, and it was to-night given
for the first time, to eelebrate the golden
jubilee of the Jesuit College in Santa
Clara,
Mr Greene is e. graduate of the college
tad a well known dramatic writer, and
when last year he was requested to fur
nieh a play for the goideiÂ» jubilee of his
elma mater, ha at once suggested the
passion play, long a favorite subject with
him. The usual difficulties in the way of
buch college productions were discussed,
the objection earrllegiaus; the objection
feinininee; the objectien of amateur ma
terial for its interpretation, and &o on;
but the playwright ewept aside all .ob
stacles by hie announced conviction that
a passion play might be written about a
suggested Christ; that the feminine fig
ures could be omitted and that the ma
terial to hand w&iÂ» sufficiently adequate
for a g-ood and worthy presentation.
"Hamlet without Hamlet," without
Ophelia, without the Oueen mother, was
about the measure ef Mr. Greene's hercu
lean task, and that he has acquitted him
eelf admirably must be frankly admitted.
Whether or not the game is worth the
candle is another question, a sufficiently
important one to have persuaded the at
tendance of at least one Eastern manag
er, Joe Grismer, at the jubilee ceremonies
of a country college in far California.

It Is now certain that there will be a
rowing rc&atta. on Lake Merritt on In
dependence day, and there Is every rea
son to believe that It will be the most
successful one that the oarsmen have
had for several years. . The execu
tive committee in charge of the Fourth
of July celebration met in the rooms of
the Merchants' Exchange at Oakland on
Tuesday evening, and listened to the re
port of the committee appointed to look
after the entertainment to be given in
the afternoon of that day. The report
recommended a rowing and swimming
regatta and waÂ« adopted by unanimous
vote. The regatta will be in charge of
the afternoon entertainment - committee,
consisting- of District Attorney Allen, J.
J. Lea and Instructor Carroll of the Re
liance Athletic Club, but all the details
of the various events will be arranged
by the regatta committee of the Pacific
Association of the Amateur Athletic Un
ion. President Cerf of the Boating Asso
ciation of the University of California
says that the Berkeley oarsmen are anx
ious to take part in the regatta if they
can procure a suitable boat. The finances
of the affair are in very satisfactory con
dition, the City Council of Oakland hav
ing appropriated five hundred dollars,
and the County Board of Supervisors a
like sum, to the celebration fund. - A
committee has gone over Lake Merritt
End ascertained that a straight mile
course can be obtained. Over the greater <
part of the course there Â¦will- be ten feet
of -water, and on the day of the regatta
the flood-gates at Twelfth street will be '
closed at high tide, thus securing a min
imum depth of five feet at the turn. The
races will be one and a half miles, with a
turn at the half distance. Spectators
will have excellent opportunities for see-
Ing the races, there being at least three
points affording a good viewâ the willows
rear Schilling's place, the Boulevard and
Twelfth street bridge. It has also been
ascertained that It will be easy to get the
rowboats to the Bcene of action, as
those from the Alameda and University
boathouses can be pulled down Oakland
creek up to the Twelfth street floodgates
and carried across the roadway to the
lake. The barges and outrigged skiffs
from San Francisco can be taken over, on
the creek boat and rowed up the estuary
to the same spot. It is probable 'that all
the city rowing clubs, except the Tritons,
will send crews and single scullers in
the regatta,, the prizes in which wiir be
much better than in the ordinary races
on the bay. , â¢ Â» â¢Â¦*Â¦:
Last Sunday the Ariel Rowing Club
took the first step . - toward removing

decided, an explanation is due the cours
ing public for the absence .of SIsquoctfrom
the- grand bunch of champions that! gave
the event such importance. That the
courser, did not appear t is not, because of
his lack of reputation or necessary .qual
ifications, for no dosr In the 1 history of
the game has kept befofe the public and
won the record that Sisauoc : has in so
short a space of time., Since Jimmy Dean
sold the hound back to D. J. Healoy'it
has been a- succession of victories for, the
Petaluma kennels, and in" the swell event
in coursing it was naturally, expected" that
Sisquot would not only be an entry, but
that second" money would be - the ; hardest
luck that could befall him. : â¢ , Â¦ Â¦' ' '
Â¦ When the\ members ' of the . committee
were hustling for . the naming of dogs
for the big stake, Dan : Delury sought
Healey and asked* for the Drivilege â¢ of
placing . Sisquoc to ". run â¢ for him. Healey,
acquiesced, but conditionally: "Yes, Dan,,
you | may nominate , him, I and if he Â¦ .wins
anything you can. have back youi ten
dollar entrance fee." was Healey's offer.
When it is considered that tha custom in
the Waterloo coursing stake, the world's
greatest event,- and in fact every other
kind of sport, is to divide all. winnings be
tween the owner and ' the nominator, it
can be imagined that the offer was not
tempting to Delury. To make â¢ , himself .
better understood - Healey â¢ Â¦ declared that
the â¢ honor of â¢ winning .was r suillcient - rec
ompense for the nominator, and "that ; in
this case it must needs be, for those terms
were his ultimatum, >> , : . Â¦' .Â¦ . ,
;. Somehow, the committee learned of the
affair, and "Delury was tola to look . for
some other flyer. As the time .for the
drawing came around Healey found -him-'
self with a champion courser trained and
on edge, but .without the necessary. com-,
mitteeman to" nanve his , dogr for,' the rich
prize event. , More , than ' one . member of
the committee mentioned t the 'fact' that
Sisquoc's : coursing * privileges ; for >the
stake had been. offered to him, but; after
hearing of Delury's experience, decided
that it was -due -as a. member of the .board
to resent â¢ what was deemed an Insuit to
the California' Coursing, Committee, - and

The scratch singles tournament for the
championship of San Francisco, com
menced last Thursday, was ." productive of
many surprises. Bob Whitney, who was
thought to be going back In his game and
who has heretofore cut but 'little figure
in tournaments, upset calculations by
beating Harold Crowell and Drommond
McGavin, two^very good second class men.
Should he play the game Saturday that
he played on Thursday Bob Whitney will
8 tend a very good chance of beating his
brother George for the championship hon
, Another man who surprised everybody
was Ray Cornell. He hu always been
considered a very fair doubles player, but
In singles he Â¦ has never accomplished
Thursday, In which he won- a set. caused
his stock to take considerable of a rise
Cornell is a good tournament player and
Â£?'Â£ Sm" 6 more practice will be able
to hold his own with any of the. second
class men. Chet Smith, one of the younr
est Players also surprised the on-lookera
by his all. around good work. Grant
Smith, wiio-waa In the poorest kind of
form, on Thursday almost went down to
defeat before Fred Brown, whom he was
expected to dispose of easily.
ThÂ© match on Saturday between R. N.
\ tlney i and Grant Smith to determine
who will meet George Whitney In the fin
als should be a very good one. In prac
tice Whitney would probably beat his op
ponent without very much trouble, but
In a tournament Smith's chances of down
in? nls opponent are very good.
_Last year the Hardy brothers Journeyed
East to try conclusions with the cham
pions of that, section. At the close of
the season Surnner ranked twelve, while
Sam ranked twenty-two. This year the
Whitney, brothers have received a very
good offer from J. P. Gardner of the Ken
wood Country. Club, Chicago. The Whit
neys, who are now Â¦ champions of the
coast. \Will undoubtedly go East this year
and as George is by far the best player
on the roast he should do great things
on the trip. The Hardys came within an
ace of winning â¢ the Western champion
ship at Chicago and .the Whltneys beat
the Kardys in straight sets shortly after
their return. . Â¦ - . â¢Â¦ Â¦
/The next big tournament in the near
future is the singles for the championship

WELL-KNOWN PLAYERS WHO WILL COHPETE IN TQURNAnENT WHICH BEGINS TOMORROW AT SAN FRANCISCO HANDBALL ALLEY.
HA2CDBALL grows more popular
every day. Thousands of young
and old men are deriving pleas
ure and exercise from the old
Irish game. At the Olympio
Club the regulation court, which is con
ceded to be the handsomest and the best
fitted west of Chicago, is crowded daily by
devotees of the game. Among the clever
players who'are playing exciting rubbers
at the club are Charles Sullivan, Fred
Butz, George James, Jack Gleason, Henry
Rust, Tom Prendergast, Tom Walsh, Tom
Powers, Jack Tate, Oatle' Crable, Al
Hampton, James McElroy, Louis Levy,
Jim McElroy and a score of others. Mc-
Elroy's return to the game strengthens
the Olympic .lists materially. He threw
his knee out four months ago and it was
feared that he would not be able to. play
again. On Sunday last he had a try-out
and managed to play his usual good game.
Al Hampton is the star of the aggrega
tion. He Is practically in a class by hlm-

sion and decided to commence the sched
ule on October 23. The athletic clubs will
alternate, in playing the varsity elevens

the old university players and men who
had played on Eastern college teams.

to put forth an eleve nthat will uphold
the club's reputation in athletics. Charlla
Fickert, ex-captain of Stanford's victori
ous eleven of 'W>, will captain the Olympic
Club team. Such sterling players as
Greisberg, Hopper. Code and a dozen,
others will be on- the team. The club will
see that they are properly trained, and
Al Lean, the club trainer, who has had
considerable experience with football
teams, will have the men in hand.
The Olympic Club will hold a swimming
tournament on the evening' of June 12. On
June 16 the regular cross-country run
from Mill Valley to Willow Camp will bÂ©
held under the direction of George James,
the club's captain. The club will furnish
a sumptuous repast at Willow Camp and
tho members will sharpen their appetites
by a leisurely jog over the hills to tho
charming spot. This run is extremely
popular, and more than a hundred mem
bers make It ' each year.
On or about June 7 a handball tourna
ment - for - the championship of the coast
and the Melrose cup will be held at the
club. ' All the experts will compete. A
tournament exclusively for club members
will . follow. ... ' . .Â¦;

ens to contest on the gridiron.

this afternoon was a comedy of errors,

Tyler, the new umpire, was all at sea,
all of the time, and turned the comedy
into a farce. His decisions on balls and
strikes were bad. on bases they were
wore*, and he 'allowed the players to dis
pute Wm at will and wrangle together for
ten and fifteen minutes at a time over
every close decision. In consequence it
Took two hours and forty minutes to play
the game. Held pitched for Oakland, and
pave seven men free tickets to first, but
was hit safely only eight times. His sup
port made eight errors. Stricklett, who
officiated for Sacramento, was hit seven
times, walked six men and hit Babbitt

PHOENIX, Ariz., May 31.â Inability of
the ranchers In the Salt River Valley to
secure laborers to gather the hay and
grain crops has assumed a j most serious
form, and unless . help comes soon - the
damage will be very heavy. Much of the
first crop of alfalfa is spoiling in the
fields because enough men cannot be'en
eaped to care for It, and the second crop
will be ready in a few weeks. The largest
grain crop ever known in this Territory
is ripe, but much of it will be ruined un
less men can be found to handle. It. . *

The board met in the afternoon to hear

of the : Mission ! Clubs objected . to spend

thought that $40,000 for the Bureau of En

Center.-; â¢ "Too much money, is paid in

that the statement made by Center that

$200,000 worth of work done is incorrect.

In the California Club's; annual regatta
the time allowances were -not calculated,
but .they make, no difference to the re
sults, the sloop Hope winning the flag in
the thirty-foot, class, the sloop Jessie.E.'
in the thirty-six-foot class and the yawl
Idler in the forty-four-foot class.' There
were two slight mishaps during the race,
the yawl Gypsie carrying away her spin
naker In the run from Mission Rock and
the sloop Jessie E. carrying away her
backstay while beating out to. Blossom
Rock buoy. The flagship Thelma has not
yet been. repaired since her collision with
the steamer- Transit; but" went * over -the
course in cruising rig. The California
fleet made a pretty sight as it crossed
the starting line, the starts in all three
classes being made between 1:55:15 p. m.
and 1:57:55 p. m. Â¦'. ,
The regattas of. the Corinthian and Cali
fornia Tacht clubs sailed on Decoration
day were both very successful, though the
wind, especially on the last leg of the
California course, was too light for the
heavy weather boats. But In the channel,
especially toward the) close of the regatta,
the Corinthians grot a fair. breeze and a
moderate sea. As the race was sailed
wholly on an ebb tide, there was no diffi
culty, even for the smallest craft, in get
ting across the starting line; indeed, all
the starters did so within the ' prescribed
period of five minutes. For the same rea
son there was : no trouble about .being set
down by the tide ,on\ the > windward buoy,
some of the helmsmen holding- on too long
before going about { to . round , the " mark.
There was some .verypretty racing. In the
Corinthian regatta; Prank Stone's. Presto,

ner for the last two or three years. Among

place. Ed Howard on going to windward
for. the second time seemed too far out,
but came about and . rounded - the mark

Track Notes.
nONTALXiADE and Glendenning
furnished the surprises at Oak
land, yesterday. The former
won the three-year-old and up
race In easy fashion, being
quoted on the slates at 8-1, a rank out
sider. True Blue, the favorite, was never
in the race after the near turn. Glenden
ning administered even a greater surprise
Jolt than. Montallade. Set down by the
pencilers at 10-1, this two-year-old walked
away from the field, beating Carlo, the
favorite, by five lengths..
Bassinger's first victory -was registered
on Irate, an 11-5 favorite, over the six
furlong route. .Irate led all the way, Ga
lene and Aurora holding on until the pad
dock, when Fauntleroy on Alaria worked
through the pack and landed the place.
Parizade, a 7-5 favorite, gave Basslnger
his second victory. After a long delay at
the post, due to the inability of Burlin
game In steadying You You, the two-year
old fillies broke in a fair start. When the
stretch was reached Parizade shot out in
front, .Lady Carlo and Quadra tacking on
in Chinese fashion. Flattered, with Hoar
up, passed Quadra at the paddock and the
bunch strung out as the wire was passed.
Gibraltar, never headed, won the third
race over the Futurity course. The two
Rios, De Altar and Chico, were in the
running until the stretch. The start was
a. good one after a long delay caused by a
combination play of unruliness, In which
Mike Rice,. Gibraltar and Altar assumed
villainous parts.
Montallade at 8-1. the outsider in a four
cornered race, the fourth on the card, over
seven furlongs, won without a struggle
on the stretch. True Blue, the favorite,
and Byron Rose had a comfortable lead
down the back stretch as they teamed to
gether. At the far turn Montallade
moved up and when the stretch was
reached cut out In front. Byron Rose,
third choice, captured place money, True
Blue finishing last. - - . , < .
When Glendenning with "Webster up, a
10-1 shot, won the five-furlong race for
two-year-olds a shout went up from â¢ the
asphalt. Carlo, the 11-5 favorite, was fig
ured as the proper play, but at no time
was Glendenning headed after steam was
up. Five lengths behind was Carlo when
the tape -was breasted. Halnault came in
for the show. In this race Fauntleroy on
Porous fell just above the paddock and
was thrown against the fence. How he
escaped extinction is miraculous. As It
â¢was, he was badly stunned and bruised
and was carried to the hospital, where he
soon revived. - *
Tho sixth race was between Dangerous
Maid and Spike, both marked at about the
same price on the books. Spike led. but
from the paddock the Maid showed her
gameness and won by a neck.

TWO RARE SURPRISES
FURNISHED THE TALENT
â¢ Sid Cavlll, swimming instructor of -the
Olympic â¢' Club, was last night . given six
months', leave of absence by the board of
directors in order that he may recuperate
his falling health. During his absence
Percy Cavill, a brother of the present in
structor, will teach ' in hi3 place. Â¦
. Cavlll' has been ailing; for the past few
months.' He. contracted a cold while
standing around the big tank at the club
and. he has suffered severely. His usual
weight is 180 pounds, but he now weighs
140 pounds. His physician warned him
that. if he did not take a rest he would be
a candidate for burial honors. Sid took
the advice to heart and he made applica
tion to the board f or Â¦ leave of absence.
The directors having in mind the splendid
work done by Cavill? granted his request.
They also agreed to engage his brother
Percy, until Sid returns to the club.
Sidney Cavill intends going to New Zea
land, where his brother . conducts a coun
try, resort. He hopes. to recuperate his
strength and return to the club in good
shape to teach the art of swimming.
Percy Cavill, who will act as. instructor
during his absence, is < also a clever swim
mer. He has held/ a number of world's
records and won - a . score of valuable
trophies. He also has ' a record Â¦ for life
saving. He is a member of the famous
frn.ily of swimmers, the r Cavills of Aus
tralia. â¢ There are at present four ; boys
and a girl surviving. .',, The parents were
experts in ; the water, and . taught Â¦ their
children' to swim as soon as they could
toddle down 1 to the? water. One brother
lost his life while giving an exhibition at
the Stockton baths. He was overcome by
the gas that generated at the bottom of
the tank used for bathing, and before he
could be brought to the top he expired.

THE CHINESE TRIBUTE.
ONE of ..the very impressive scenes of Decora
tion day was at the tomb of Grant, when Wu
Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister, under or-'
ders from Li Hung Chang, laid a wreath on the tomb
and delivered an address. The matter of the address
was exceptionally good, and the tribute paid to the
American General and President could not have been
excelled in fervor by one of his companions in arms.
When Grant visited China in his tour around the
world he was treated with honors and distinguished
courtesy. "Li Hung Chang became much. attached to
him and was impressed by his wisdom and broad and
humane view of Asiatic problems. When the General
died Earl Li directed that the Chinese embassy in
Washington every year pfece a wreath on his tomb.
The discharge of that duty by Wu this year furnished
the occasion for his address. In that effort he devel
oped what may be the sympathetic link between China
and. this country- He said Grant's hold. on,, the old
empire is the appeal which his career makes to the
Chinese imagination. He was not born in the pur
ple and was. not the result of aristocratic lineage or of
the opportunities of wealth. So his fame appealed
to the Chinese, who have a saying, "Statesmen and
generals do not come from an exclusive stock." This
means that the. opportunity to rise and achieve fame
is open to all, and success depends upon the individual
quality and not on birth or riches.
In their contacts with Europeans the Chinese have
come to learn that the European rule is the opposite
and that birth and wealth are the factors in advance
ment, while individual genius languishes without rec
ognition.
In Grant. they see an illustration of their own prov
erb, and in American institutions" an application of
their own philosophy.
It is to be hoped that fate will not subject, them to
the rule of aristocracy, as will be the case if the land
grabbing European Governments succeed in oppress
ing them to the point of partitioning their country.
Whatever misgivings Americans may feel about the
new attitude'of this country toward the .world, and the
new duties thereby" imposed/ there is no. difference <of
opinion about using our new found position to the
fullest extent in prevention of the division of China
and the enslaving of its people- j;
The people of^this country have submitted patiently
to the decree of the Board of Geographical Names
thÂ«t the natives of the Philippines shall be known as
Filipinos-, but when the attempt is made to 'fix upon
the natives of Porto Rico the name of Puertori
quenos it is time, to protest.. There are few newspa
pers in the country that can give more than space
enough', to call them Porto Ricans. <-f<r,-
Gaverrior' Allen of Porto Rico in his report to the
State Department said the natives are too lazy to do
anything except lie in hammocks and eat bananas and
yams ; yet when he returned to the island they
greeted him with processions, fireworks and eulo
giunjs: Possibly they'thoughit he f was t~ying to com
plinient them on 'their repose of manner and absence

About the only thing at the Buffalo exposition that
has thus_ far given rise to much discussion is the.
speech made by Senator Lodge during the dedication
EervicesT" It "is a warning to Europe to keep but' of
this hemisphere; and while some say it is patriotism,'
and others say it is jingoism, all admit it -is a great
speech^ Â¦'â¢ . '' - ' /-,,'Â¦ ' h Â¦ '
One authority attributes the drain to the large num
ber 'of 'Americans who abroad.^- Immensely rich
The situation is certainly 'a curious one, Jbecause the
apparent balance of, trade in our favor_ is surprisingly
large; it is, iri^ fact, enormous. During the 'past 'ten
months of the current fiscal year the exports "of.'mer
chandise and silver from the United States Â¦in; excess
of imports have aggregated $607,833,749, against which
there has been a net import of only $23,218,586 in gold,
thus leaving an unsettled balance in our favor|of
$584,615,163. Nevertheless -the present movements of
gold is away. from this country to Europe. 'Â¦;;, '.Â¦ : -
Until very recently the, theory of large, cash bal
ances in Europe due to America was generally" ac
cepted as accounting for the apparent discrepancies
in the trade balance and the various amounts due for
freights, , interest and traveling expenses, but objec
tions are now being made to it. Some of the', leading'
bankers in New York are reported to be unsatisfied
with that explanation and have pointed out that bank-,
ing houses having. European connections have been
and are drawing large amounts of 60 and oo.day for
eign exchange bills which are in the nature of a loan
from Europe to the United States, and are commonly,
drawn in quantity at this season of the year, to.be'
settled . later on, when the surplus American grain
â¢ crops are marketed. If any balances exist' abroad,
says one of the bankers, the bills drawn would be de
mand bills of exchange and not long bills. In other
words, the .foreign exchange market at New York'
'is^now in the same state in which we find it when
the foreign trade balance is against us, but will soon
turn' in our favor through the export of newly har
vested crops. . y = Â¦ :
Every student of the subject of course takes note
of the factors in the problem which are not recorded
in the ordinary trade statistics. Â¦'-, So many millions,
are allowed for freights paid to foreign ship-owners,
so many for interest and profits on foreign invest
ments in this country, and so many for .the traveling
expenses of rich Americans in Europe. These, of
course, constitute an immense offset against the trade
balance in oiir favor," but' they do not upon even the
most, liberal computation appear to account for the
whole of it. Consequently it has been calculated that
a considerable portion of our profits. on exports have
been left in European hands because better returns
could be had for. the money in foreign lands than at
home. ' ; t . .
HARDLY any feature of the financial situation of
the world is engaging so much attention at
this time as the strange fact that despite the
enormous balance of international trade in our favor
gold is being exported to Europe. Officials of the
Government, statisticians and political ecojiomists
have offered various 'theories to account 'for it, but
none has been thoroughly -satisfactory/. ..."

BECAUSE; Director of the Mint Roberts, Con- ;
â¢gressman Babcock of -Wisconsin, Senator
Beveridge and some other Republicans have
at various times expressed a belief that in the near
future it will be necessary to revise the tariff, in order
to adjust it to changes in the' industrial and commer
cial world, some of the Democratic leaders and organs
who have been looking for an issue ever since the last
election have declared in' favor of reopening the con-'
troversy between free trade and' protection, or at least
of beginning an agitation against the tariff in the hope
that it can be ..worked up into an' effective 1 campaign
issue and tried out in the Congressional elections next
year. : '. ' â¢ â¢ . Â¦â¢.','.
It is not surprising that some siiclv scheme should
be advocated by Democratic leaders, -for drowning
men catch at Straws, and since neither free 'silver" nor
anti-imperialism, nor Â¦ socialism, \ nor .government"
ownership nor any other plank in the Bryan platform
can be made available in another election, it is but
natural they should grasp at the straw that appears
to be floating their way along the currents of tariff'
discussion. â¢â¢ â¢ â¢ . ~ , " ,
They, are aware -that under the lead of Cleveland
they once elected a President on a tariff reform plat
form, but they have . forgotten that the experience
which the country had with the Democratic tariff has
been sufficient for the test of this; generation.
No tariff, however .wisely tdevised to suit the re
quirements of a particular time,- can be expected to
remain unchanged forever. Consequently it is self-':
evident that sooner or. later tariff revision will have
to.be undertaken. . There is,, however, no need for it
at this time. 'In fact, a renewal of tariff agitation, With 1
a resultant uncertainty as to 1 what changes would be :;
made in â¢ the existing- duties, would -do- more harm
than almost anything else that could befall our indus
trialand commercial system -at this juncture. It is,
therefore, not at all likely that any encouragement will
be given by the, masses .of = the people to the mad
scheme of renewing the 'tariff fight. Such changes as
froin time to time niay' be" - advisable "' in' the
duties must be made by the friends of protection and
not by the men whose tariff tinkering produced the
Wilson bill. Â¦ ' V ,
Strangely enough the 'only sanej leader among 'the 1
Democrats at this time.' appears.i to be'Senator .Vest,
whose erratic arid fiery temper has been cooled by
age and from whose eyes blinding partisanship* has
been removed by his approaching retirement . from
politics. He was recently interviewed on the subject
of the paramount issue for the coming campaign and.
said: "The issues wilf be made by the conditions, and
the man will be indicated. by th'eassues. ; ; The issues
may be brought before .us in. a week. 'They may come
in a single day. Wall street may ' indicate them.
Hanria says prices in Wall street are based on actual
values. If Hanna is. right and the prosperity We now
enjoy is continued up' to the next election there will
be little need for 'having-any Democratic policy in
1904." , . " .
That is about as accurate a forecast as can be made.
Under any circumstances the Democrats might as well
stick to Bryan and free silver, or have no policy at
all, as to try to win a Presidential election again in
this 'generation on a free trade platform.

. Work of the Copyriglit Office.
There is one division of the library
which is distinct in character and has no
parallel in other librasies. This is the
copyright office. It is under a register of
copyrights, who, under the direction of
the Librarian,- performs, with a special
force, all the duties relating to copyrights.
His force now consists of forty-live per
sons,- who a.re - exclusively engaged -in re
ceiving applications for copyright and the
accompanying fees, in making the entries,
.and in receiving and recording the various
articles deposited. : The number of en
tries,-and with them the volume of the
copyright business in general, grows at
the rale'of 10 per cent a year. The entries
last year numbered 94,798, the articles de
posited 141,444; - the; fees received $65,206.
The Copyright Office, therefore, earns a
revenue to the Government, a net revenue
â¢last year of. nearly ?20,000 over and above
its operating expensesâfor service, print
ing and stationery. Its operations are in
teresting in detail, but are so distinct in
character from those of the library proper
as not to be dealt with specifically in this
statement. It is the privilege of the li
brary proper to make requisition upon the
Copyright Office for any copyrighted ma
terial which may be useful- to its purpose
as a library. What it does not draw re
mains in the files of the Copyright , Office
in a distinct portion of the building.
.Manuscripts of Great Value.
The material in the special divisions' of
the library is preserved and handled ac
cording to its special needs. For the man
uscripts . there are not merely, special
locked cases but steel safes for the collec
tion, which, while not a large one, ln
Â¦ cltides material of inestimable value and
irreplaceable. The collection of the Mar
quis de Rochambeay, for instance, includ
ing 300 - manuscripts maps . of the Revolu
tion; ,the papers of Paul Jones, ih twelve
volumes; the records of the Virginia com
pany from 1621 to 1682; - the journal of
Washington on the 'Braddock expedition,,
his diary of the Federal convention, "his
Â¦.orderly .book at, Valley Forge, forty vol
umes of other Revolutionary I orderly
.books and military journals and various
other "manuscripts, including the original
material for the Force archives, in 365
.folio volumes. Among other manuscripts
,.of special note are thirty-six volumes re
. cording the . testimony as to. â¢ royalist
claims taken before the Commissioners at
Halifax after: the Revolution; With a few
Â¦ : exceptions,' the entire : collection, relates to
the eighteenth century. A great many of
the individual manuscripts, being | frayed
and delicate, have to be repaired and re
inforced. Two repairers are constantly at
-work â¢ upon . these. The material â¢ used is
chiefly crepeline, a transparent silk, which
is pasted over the face of the manuscript, :
front and â¢ back, stiffening and protecting
without obscuring it.' ? . Â¦ :â¢â¢.;â¢. Â¦"â¢'Â¦Â¦. ..
The cataloguing of manuscripts involves
not merely an ordinary index, nut a cal

The selections of the books for the li- Â¦
braryof Congress is, determined in 'vari
ous ways. .Certain, books come to it by
direct gift; certain others (chiefly docu- \
ments) through - international exchange
(fifty copies of all Federal documents are
placed at its disposal for exchange with
olher countries); certain other books
(chiefly serial publications) come to it ' as ;

submitted -to it .by dealers for purchase;
various, others are considered. by it from
descriptions, in; . publishers' prospectuses
and catalogues, and in book reviews. < But
in addition' 'there; is a:, systematic growth
based upon systematic recommendation.
When a cataloguer' discovers, .a gap in
aÂ«set he makes a'reconimendation that it
be lilled;" when one' of 'the bibliographers
in checking over the bibliograpny of a
subject tinas lacking In the library works
which are necessary to the proper repre
sentation, of that subject, he recommends
their purchase;- -when: an Â¦ attendant in
serving the public discovers the library
to be lacking a volume required for the
use of a reader and .reasonably within
tUe scope of the, library, ' he recommends
its purchase. The reader also is privi
leged to recommend. The recommendation
in each case comes to the .Librarian on a
card, and when approved by him the card
is initialed and. forwarded to the order
(purchasing) 'division. That division de
termines where the -order is to be placed,
whether with a domestic or- with a toreign
agent or dealer, and?; the reasonable price
.to be paid,"Snd places the order. The,li
brary has agents In the leading, book cen
ters abroadâ .London, Paris, The ' Hague,
Amsterdam, Frankfort; rLeipsic, etc. The
orders that with each correspondent form
a consecutive series are ,. consecutively
numbered. The price of any item may be
doubtful, since four-flfths of the material
purchased is material no longer current.
It must; be picked up as second hand. .For
the -moment it may not be in the market.
In,this case a. request must issue for a
quotation and the order is not made defi
nite until a quotation has been secured
and accepted. . - -^ ' "',-.; â¢
Vast y7ork',:of Cataloguing.
In the library of Congress thirteen per
sons are exclusively engaged -in the pur
chasing and : receiving division;, forty-six
in the preparation of the books for use,
their classification and the compilation of
the catalogues.- The accessions last year
numbered 38,110 books .and - pamphlets.
This is in- addition to the manuscripts,
maps and charts,. music and" prints, which
arc separately dealt" with in the several
special divisions, and of which 34,957 pieces
Â¦.were, added. to the library In the course of
the Itist rear. o. ~ - tS. Â¦-.Â¦-Â¦'
. Blit in the case of the library of Con
gress there is also pending 1 a huge, work
in the nature of arrearage. The entire
existing collection is to be reclassified on
the shelves, a subject catalogue compiled
and the cards for this as well as the
author cards printed. All the cataloguing
is done on cards. > This work would
alone, it is estimated, require ninety-one
persons five years. It is being dealt with
by as large a portion of the present force
Â¦as can be spared from the work on the
current accessions. \-
mality. These exhibits are composed with
reference in part to : anniversaries or, par
ticular . occasions and are changed from
time to time.- Â¦ â¢ - ' '
The library is in receipt of 1600 current
newspapers and periodicals.. Twenty-tnree
hundred of these are displayed on tables,
racks, and open cases in the newspaper
periodical reading room, "where they are
directly accessible to the public without
formality. This -room now assembles per
haps ? the fullest representation in exist-j
ence, in any one spot of . the .current po
litica.1 literary, scientific and commercial
Intelligence of the world. -It Is in inces
sant use by hundreds of readers. .
. ''Heading- Room for the Blind. .
'Â¦ The. reading room for the blind has a
special function and Is pursuing a special
career of . usefulness. It has a collection
of books 'in raised maps, music,
chart's and ; modeled reliefs. It has, be
sides, examples of the mechanical contriv
ances for. writing the various styles now
current, . including point and American
Braille. But it has ' something more than
these: -It is endeavoring to exnibit what
undertakings may be usefully pursued by
the .blind and. for. this purpose It has a
typewriter, â¢ telegraph operating instru
ment and a printing Dress. Eevery secu
lar'day' except Wednesday during the
winter season there is a readlntr for the
blind "given by volunteers; on "Wednasday
there are recitals. The room has a piano
of its pwn. â¢ These readings and recitals
benefit the .blind of the District of Colum
bia, but their benefit, as the benefit of the
room is general, 'goes much further. It ia
visited by 30,000 persons every year, com
ing from all parts of the world. The illus
tration which It . offers of what mavbe
done for the unseeing is, therefore, taken
and - applied subsequently in " various lo
calities, so-- that the influence of its work
reaches rajr beyond the limits of Washing
ton.' , '.'-. . . Â¦ . â¢ Â¦
The total number of recorded readers of
ordinary books last year was 123.844. This
does not by any means include the entire
use, but only the recorded use in the main
reading room.
Value to th.e Reference , Reader.
For reference use the library, in effect
from its beginning, has been free to all
persons. It is still free, and free without
formality; Books for home use are by
statute issued only to members of Con
gress and their families, the Justices of
the Supreme Court and Court of Claims,
the heads of ' departments, i the members
of the. diplomatic corps and a few other
designated officials. It is very possible
that the privilege may be broadened in
the interest of 'the higher scholarship.
The needs of the ordinary reader- of the
District of Columbia will ultimately be
met by the public library of. the district,
which Is to be developed In the new, build
ing provided by Mr. Carnegie at "a cost of
$350,000. â¢ ._ .( - '. Â¦ ' Â¦"
The -most important service of the li
brary of Consre3S, as of the British mu
seum, which issues not a single book be
yond Its walls, must be tljat to the refer
ence reader. ' For special research read
ers come to it from all parts. . No history
of the United â¢ States, or of American.af
fairs,, can adequately be written without
some reference to its shelves. As the col
lection broadens recourse to it will be In
dispensable in many other fields of knowl
edge. . 'Â¦ \ .,* . ' Â¦ -
The maintenance ht the. Naiional Capitol
of a great reference collection is -in itself
a justifiable undertaking and necessary to
the dignity of the United" States among
civilized nations. Â« The library of Congress
can, however; reach out its benefits in va
rious ways to compensate each locality of
the United States for its share in its
maintenance. It is. as I have stated, al
ready to an extent a bureau of informa
tion for the entire country. > It will make
its resources valuable bytheissue of pub
lications which will point out the availa
ble literature on' various subjects of public
interest. Several . such publications have
already' been' compiled and Issued. One,
/or instance, on colonial administration,
one on railroad finance, one on marine
subsidies, one on? canal and railway
routes, one on trusts. ,
"Work for. All the Libraries.
It will make eenerally available the re
sults of .its cataloguing work by ,the dis
tribution to libraries and institutions; at
a nominal cost, : of the cards which it com
piles and prints representing a' catalogue
of the trooks which it receives. This pro
ject'Is already determined on, so far aa
it concerns â¢â¢ the . books entered- for copy
right. The cost of cataloguing a book and
of writing or printing a singrlecopy of the
catalogue card is, on the average, not
less than 20 or 25 cents. This expense is
being borne in repetition by hundreds of
libraries taking the same book. The ma
jor Dart of it consists in the work of the
cataloguer and in the composition on the
card if printed. This Â» part the national
library, having to bear for itself, can un
dertake once for all for the entire Coun
try." It can then furnish duplicate copies,
of a card to other institutions on the same
basis as Government publications can be
furnished by the, public printerâ namely,

people' ; like * the ' Astors , and Martins vi and the
heiresses who have , married European nobles by T no
means cause the bulk of the drain. "There is a host of
people of comparatively moderate means who live
most of their. time in Europe and draw their revenues
frd'nv the United States". It is said that in the city of
Dresden alone there are upward of 30,600 Americans
of the leisure class, and in the aggregate the number
of such throughput Europe is verylarge. It appears
from this that the United States is suffering some
what from a species of absenteeism that is causing* a
tremendous drain. on. the revenues of the country.

THE Portland Oregonian files a demurrer to our
forecast of the future Greek a.s a product of
California.
;In a spirit of fairness "we 'conceded* that the Califor
nia Greek would have the Â«vices as well as the virtues
of the citizen of ancient Attica. 'The Oregonian, in
rejoinder,' concedes that we have now the Greek vices,
even those of Alcibiades, but denies 'to us a' spark of
Greek virtue or genius. It names various great char
acters in California oratory, 7 poetry, journalism arid
art,- all born outside the State and on exhibition as
exotics. As to our indigenous genius and domestic
bred talent, it, calls the roll of the native sons and
daughters and fails to tally one great name in the
whole lot.
We may be permitted to say something in behalf of
the climate and physical environment which* develops
the latent genius that was born elsewhere but lay in
its shell without germination until touched by the.
"fructifying sunshine of California. It was so' of the
gifts .and graces that garland the names of Baker,
Bret Harte, Ina Coolbrith, Sill,- McAllister, Starr-
King, Field, McDougall, Gwin, Bierstadt, Cooper, *
Keith, Fisher and a long roll of worthies in litera
ture and law and art. When Joaquin Miller emerged
into a reputation that is believed to be destined to
immortality it was as the poet of the Sierras. , Had
he sung of thÂ» Cascades, the Callapooia. the Siuslaw
or the Willamette there is reason for believing that his
name would ne'ver'have been known outside the Ore
gon county where he dispensed justice as a local Judge.
Fancy him trying to fill the trump of Fame as "the
poet of the Wrickriaw," or "the sweet singer of
Jump-off Jo!" It is intolerable!
This is a subtle psychological discussion. The na
tives of California muster, at present, scant two gen
erations. We did not pretend that the climate acting
as "a force in psychological evolution would be able,
in a time so brief, to produce Homer, Euripides,
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. An unrecorded and
unknown age passed over the tribes that pitched
their tents in" Attica before their skin dwellings were
evoluted into the sublime architecture that is able,
even in its ruins, to thrill the cold blood of the mod
ern alien as he stands uncovered and reverential be
fore those poems in stone that stir the heart though
the tooth of Time has gnawed away- many a line.,.
We beg the Oregonian to give us time and not
foreclose on us prematurely. .
Meantime what has that classic journal to say for
Oregon? What has the dank and moldy climate of
that suburb of California produced besides catarrh to
arrest the attention of mankind? Was the genius of
Delusion Smith born there? Did Jo Lane cut his
baby teeth on that wet sod? Did even the historic
nose of Cronin get aught but its opalescent tint from
the rainbows that "arch the moisture of the Emerald
State? The -great journalists of Oregon are Harvey
Scott and Tony Noltner, "one of whom was said to
be able to run a paper without brains or money.
But, alas! they are not the products of the soil. Does
Sylvester Pennoyer ewe his transcendent talents in
statesmanship to an origin in the mud slime of the
State that shines like a dim and gibbous moon m his
reflected light? . . '
. Nesmith, Williams and Whitman were all importa
tions. The rank vegetation of that rain belt is still
vegetable, and the native Oregonian of. note remains
to be" noted. As we vaticinated a Greek out of phy
sical conditions of California, Â¦ we , now foretell , the
mermaid of the future as a physical development of
Oregon. She will comb, her damp tresses on the mud
bars of the Columbia and Cro\v Creek, eat raw salmon
and camas root and make"fish- eyes at the merman
in the spray that wets Oregon City, and the future
population will be half mutton, half fish. .

Loomis, who is now in Europe seeking
to recuperate, will be given another dip
lomatic position as soon as a suitable
place can be found. Meanwhile Mr. Rus
sell will remain in charge of the United
States legation at Caracas for a period
of time not yet determined upon, but
likely to be fixed by the attitude of the
Venezuelan Government.
It is not the present intention of the
Government to take official notice of the
criticism passed by President Castro of
Venezuela upon Minister Loomis, as con
tained in a newspaper interview. The
officials cannot bring themselves to be
lieve that the President* of Venezuela
would willingly reflect upon the personal
character of the Minister of another Gov
ernment, who, according to official state
ments made by this Government, acted
by explicit direction of his own Govern
ment in the matters which formed the
â¢subject of the criticism. Therefore, It. is
probable that our Government will be
satisfied for the moment, in the absence
of further untoward developments, with
official disclosures.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â It Is officially
admitted that Minister Loomis will not
return to Venezuela. There are two rea
sons for this decision. ' In the first place,
Loomis has suffered in health at his un
congenial post, and in the second place the
President Is not disposed to expose him
again to the attacks he has suffered in
Venezuela as a result of the execution
of the orders of the State Department.

SLAYER OF J. . N. E. WILSON
AND SOME WITNESSES AT,
THE CORONER'S INQUEST.
. S. H. Bocklln, pressman, testified that
shortly after being-shot Wilson said:
"Clancy shot me; I believe I am about to
die. It's \ all up with me . now. . Clancy
came to my office and shot me down like
a doff." '
Detective Sergeant Thomas L. â¢ Ryan
produced another dying statement, taken
in - his presence by Police Clerk Otto
Heineman, in -which Clancy is accused of
the murder. : Â¦
â¢ H. F. Young, a brother-in-law of the
dead lawyer, produced an envelope that
he had found on Mr. Wilson's desk. On
the back of the envelope in the handwrit
ing of the dead man was the following:
Patrick Clancy killed me; shot ; nys twice.
God bless Jeannette. J..N. E. WILSON. ,
On being asked as to his reason for
shooting Wilson, Clancy told the officer:
"He has cheated me out , of all my
money; the â ; â should have had it a
long time ago. You better hurry up and
send somebody down to Wilson's office,
because there's nobody there."
' Bond Clerk T. I. Fitzgerald produced
the dying -statement of Wilson. Â¦ Before
taking it witness informed the wounded
man that as he was a lawyer he was well
aware of the Importance of such a state
ment, and Wilson replied that he believed
that he was about to die. Â¦ * Â¦
Dr. Emmett Rixford testified that Wil
son, when he first reached the hospital,
said that he was iucky not to have been
injured worse than he was.
Police Officer Jacob L. Nelson testified
that Clancy came to him on Kearny street
During the proceedings Clancy sat be
side his attorney and- his face wore a
gloomy look, as though he realized the
gravity of the crime committed by him.
L. Moebus, a printer employed in an of
fice adjoining that of Wilson, testified
that a few moments after he heard the
pistol shots Wilson staggered into the
place where the witness was and mus
tered sumcient strength to say, "Patrick
Clancy snot me; telephone for. the police."
Wilson then lay on the floor and talked
incoherently about mortgages and Clancy.
He fcald several times that Clancy had.
shot him, and that he had had no quarrel
with the shooter.
The evidence was all one way and
shewed no provocation for the murder.
Clancy, by advice of Robert Ferral, bis
attorney, dfd not go on the stand, so that
the line of his defense was not disclosed.
The prosecution was represented by Dis
trict Attorney Byington, A. B. Treadwell
and L>eputy District Attorney Charles L.
Weller. . . Â¦Â¦ . - ; . . â¢
W. Clancy, whom we charge with willful
murder." >v
The verdict was signed by F. Lacey,
Jack Hecht, Charles T. Newman;' C. E.
Keal. W. O. Jones, William F. Hartford,
Harry R. Toung ,and H. J. Katzenbach,
and was approved by Coroner Leland.
The young woman and her father dis
appeared from Wilkeson together to-day
and were seen going In the direction of
Buckley. To-night the father returned,
but his daughter's whereabouts Is at
present unknown. Hendricks* brother,
who is influential at Wilkeson, says he
will have her arrested and prosecuted.
With the evidence that the man had
been poisoned followed the hasty inquiry
which led to the suspicion that the young
bride was the guilty person. The glass
she gave to him bore a strong odor of
carbolic acid, while that from which she
drank had nothing but the smell of wine.
Even his whiskers were burned and his
hands blistered by the powerful acid.
This morning when confronted with the
charge of having administered poison to
her husband, Sirs. Hendricks said some
one told her to do it, but she would not
tell who. This statement is received with
some doubt, but on the other hand no
motive can be imagined why she should
seek to'take the life of her husband, un
less it be the fact that he has about
$2000 in bank.
"You drink what I have fixed for you."
"Without suspicion of danger, the man
1 put the glass to his lips and tasted the
wine. Instantly he spat it out and said It
was too strong. The poisoner was foiled;
but the unsuspecting: husband appears to
have had no thought of the evil design
of his wife. There had been no trouble
between them. On the surface, every
thing was serene.
v The deliberate determination of the
bride -was shown again in the afternoon,
when she offered her husband a glass of
poisoned wine. He asked where she got
it. She said it came from home, and add
ed, "'Vincent, vou drink it." He took
, the proffered glass and swallowed the
wine. Soon afterward he was seized by
violent pains, and the doctor was hastily
summoned, arriving in time to save his
life.
TACOMA,' May 31.â Stella Hendrickfl.
the bride of three days, who was married
to Vincent Hendrlcks at Wilkeson. in this
county, on Sunday and tried to poison
him on Tuesday, has confessed that she
made two attempts oa his life by giving:
him carbolic acid in a glass of wine once
early Tuesday morning: and again In the
afternoon. Hendrlcks is still alive and
likely to recover. His bride of 17 failed
in her first attempt to poison him, by
pouring In too much carbolic acid. Early
Tuesday morning she brought in a glass
of wine and handing it to her husband,

'Â¦- ..-Â¦'â¢. Risk.
MOJAVE, May 31.â The Mojave-Keeler
stage, outward bound from here,' was
held up by a lone highwayman to-day and
its only passenger; was relieved of his
ready, cash. ',' The outlaw made a light
haul, as the, passen^er's'purse was slim
and the stage carried no treasure of any
kind. Â¦
â¢ The stage left here at 6:10 o'clock, in
charge of Ed Monroe. When about a mile
and a half out it came' up to a man walk
ing along the road. As the coach was
passing him he suddenly produced a re
volver and commanded a halt. Then it
was seen for j the first time that he was
masked. - .
The mail on the stage was not molested
and from the single passenger- only $1 50
was collected by the highwayman. Orders
were given- for the stage to go on its way
and its occupants not to look back, and
these instructions were followed. From
the. Eighteen-mile House the news was
brought here late this afternoon. : :.
i'.The robber- was on foot, "was dressed in
overalls and a dark shirt and his face was
hidden by a, handkerchief. ,As no other
description except -that he was short and
of heavy build is given.'it is not likely
that- he .will- be 'apprehended. . , ;

had been on a spree for three weeks.
Last Thursday Mrs. Badger bought a
quart of grocery whisky before noon and
partook of it freely. In the evening Dr.

streaming from the wound on her head,
but that they had not. had sufficient cu

CHICAGO, May 31.â Chicago's machin
ists' strike began more than 1000
men quitting work in various shops and
factories because the employers ' refused
to sign the agreement sent yesterday, for
a 12% "per. cent increase in wages, a nlne :
hour day and extra pay for all time over
nine hours. ' Â¦ ' ' - t ~:
,:When the force of 280 machinists , gath
ered at the works of Fraser & Chalmers
early In the' morning they were', met by
W. J. - Chalmers, who told ,them;_ they
might as, well go home if they , expected
him to sign the agreement.' The machin
ists' accordingly dispersed.'* Similar scenes
were enacted in many "other .plants,
though a few manufacturers Â¦ signed the
agreement.
The machinists' strike - situation â¢'. as
sumed a more grave aspect with the
threat of -the allied .trades , to declare a
sympathetic movement- at" once, v . With
the exception of. Â§ix shops, none of those
to which â¢ the agreement was presented
have signed. It is 1 expected that by to
morrow nearly 2000 men' will 'be 'out. -The
s'tuation is called a strike, but Â¦ In , reality
is almost as much a lockout, since many
shops made no pretense of permitting the
men to go to work to-day. Early in, the
afternoon the strikers .were joined by 150
machinists, -who quit at the Meihle Print
ing Press "Works, and 100 ,who struck- at
the Bibsor. Spring Company's plant. Â¦ -.Â¦-.*,
An important development in the situa
tion was a sympathetic strike ;. by .the
metal workers. In response to, an, order 1
by Business Agent Otto Nowack 150 metal
workers quit at different shops. to aid the
machinists in their/fight." Others will' be
called out . where it is: considered? that
their he'ip may be' effective. ; It is. expect

It Hid a Luxuriant Suit of Straight
and Very Dark Hair.
The Father of his Country concealed a
luxuriant suit of hair beneath his queue
wig. Many now wish the old fashion were
In vogue, to conceal thinned hair or bald-
ness. Yet no onÂ© need have thin hair nor
be bald, if he cure Â£he dandruff that
causes both. Dandruff cannot be cured by
scouring the scalp, because.it Is a germ
disease, and the germ has to be killed.
Newbro's Hferpicide kills the dandruff
germâ no other hair preparation -will.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the ef-
fect." There's no cure for dandruff but
to kill the germ.

MMI something of the soap he uses. There is a
l|j||E well-founded objection to using a floor-dean-

is the bather's soap. It costs more than common
soaps, but the difference is In the ingredients and
making. Why not treat yourself with a little respect.
Is not the human skin with its marvellous delicacy
entitled to pure soap ? Ivory Soap.â it floats.

Several weeks ago the Pacific Coast
Company started a regular line of excur
sion boats between here and San Diego
and the venture has been such a success
that the company is sorry it did not try
it long ago. Three of the flnest steam
ships on the coastâ Queen, Santa Rosa
and Corona â are on the route, and/to-day
the Corona sails with every berth Â¦ taken,
and would-be passengers turned away
Sho will stop at all the way ports, giving 1
the passengers a chance to get a run
ashore. At Port Harford a visit can be
made to the sulphur baths, while at Santa
Barbara the mission and the famous min
eral eprings can be , Inspected, and from
San Diego a short run can be made into
Mexico. A magnificently, illustrated book
has been got up by the steamship com
pany, describing the trip south, a copy of
which can be obtained by tourists.

Incidentally there will be one more
leave-taking on the transport wharf after
the Sheridan gets away. Captain N. P.
Batchtider. U. S. N., will superintend the
departure of two hundred and odd school
mcrms. who are going to the Philippines
on the transport, and then he intends tak
ing: a two weeks' vacation. . There will be
no transports in port for ten davs or
more, and, judging by what he has had
4 n put up with so far, the gallant captain
thinks he will require a two weeks' rest
after he is through with this morning's
fiiesre. All hands Â¦will gather in the main
office this afternoon to wish Captain
Batcbelder an enjoyable holiday. â¢

Water Front Notes.
E. E. Engblom, a sailor on the ship
Henry Villard, fell down the hold of the
vessel yesterday and fractured his skull.
He died in the Emergency Hospital.
Matthew Grimes severed the radial
artery in his right wrist on the steamer
Santa. Rosa, and H. Bawaraza sprained
his ankle on the steamer Bonita. Both
men were taken to the Harbor Hospital.
Peterson's launches will run to the bat
tleship Iowa to-day and to-morrow. The
warship leaves for the Sound In a few
days.
Lieutenant J. P. McGinniss has been de
tached from the Alert and ordered to the
battleship Iowa.
Uncle Sam is going to curtail his trans
port fleet and in consequence there will
be nine steamships seeking outside busi
ness next month. All the chartered ves
sels will be released on their arrival here
and many of them will go back Into the
regular trade.
The Aztec is now out nine days from
Nagasaki for this port. On her arrival
she will be turned over to the Pacific
Mail Company. The Pennsylvania, Ohio
and Indiana of the Empire line are all
on their way here from Manila and will
be released on arrival. They originally
came here from the East for the Klon
dike trade, but have been running as
transports almost ever since they reached
the coast. The chances are that they
will go into the Nome trade.
The British steamships Pak Ling, Gla
morganshire, Lennox and Kintuck and the
Norwegian steamship Tnyra are all due
on the coast during June and will be
turned back to their agents just as quick
ly as Uncle Sam can get rid of them.
The Lennox and Kintuck will go' to Port
land and may run from there to the Or
ient, the Thyra may go back Into the
coal trade, while the Pak Ling and .Gla
morganshire will probably go to the
Sound. The return of the volunteers and
the addition of Eastern transports to the
San Francisco fleet gives Uncle Sam all
the vessels he wants without the assist
ance of outsiders. The purchase of the*
Samoa gives the service a steamship that
can carry 10,000 tons of merchandise, or
as much as any three of the vessels
released.

"Wreckage Washed Ashore.
The Merchants' Exchange received
word from Unalaska yesterday that a
considerable quantity of new lumber had
been washed ashore about May 15. 8ome
of it was marked E. C. and had piping

The schooner C. T. Hill, which sailed
from Unalaska for the Seal Islands on
April 30, turned back on May 6, owing to
having encountered ice thirty-five miles
south of St. George Island.
The schooner Nettie Sundborg, which"
left here May 23, was ashore at Fort Ross
yesterday. She got off with the loss of
her rudder. The vessel is leaking slightly.

heads fell into the basket and the work
Is not yet completed. Next week will

"When John C. Kirkpatrlck succeeded
Major Harney on the board he suggested
that the work of driving piles along the
front be let by contract. The suggestion
was accented and bids called for. One
of the offers was accepted, and in con
sequence all the men on the State's pile
driver were let out yesterday. Their
names are: J. FJanagan, M. Damuth, P.
J. Kelly, C. R. Hale, G. J. Britt, C. E.
Fowler, G. Godfrey. T. F. McGrath, F.
Perate and Ed Franklin.
The other changes were the result of
Major Harney's retirement. Commission
er Kirkpatrick now controls the patron
age and his appointees are replacing those
whose time has expired. James Foster
succeeds M. O'Brien in the street depart
ment, James Graham succeeds P. Carroll
and James Ginnity succeeds E. Maloney
as sweepers; James Faulkner succeeds M.
J. Dwyer as watchman, Thomas F. Mc-
Grath succeeds William Morrisey as

place as machinist is abolished.
C. E. Hale and T. F. McGrath of the
piledriver were given other positions by
the board. Hale succeeds J. Fennell on
the top driver and McGrath succeeds Mor
risey as boatman. A number of changes
among the wharfingers and collectors will
be made by the board at its next regular
meeting. ,
There was? no rivalry in the election of

Elliott Elected President
A resolution thanking the local bankers
and citizens for the attention shown the
members of th-i association was adopted.
Whereas. The proposed amendment to the
ccnFtitutlon of the State of California, which
provided for the exemption from taxation of
Suite, county, municipal and school bonds, was
defeated at the last general election: and
whereas it is the belief of the California Bank
ers' Association that the people did not fully
understand the advantages which would have
resulted from the adoption of said amendment;
and whereafi. steps have been taken that the
matter be again submitted to the vote of the
people. Be it
Resolved. That the California Bankers' As
sociation take all honorable means to instruct
the voters of this State of the- benefits that
may be derived by the adoption of an amend
ment to the constitution of our State, exempt
ing frrrn taxation State, county, municipal and
schecj bonds.
Retolved, That we invite the Code Commis
sion, now In session, to make amendment to
our law in the respect above mentioned, and
to make such other amendments as may occur
to said commission as needed after' a com-,
parison of ours with the laws of the States
above mentioned.
Whereas, That under the laws of our State
promissory notes bearing special covenants are
thereby rendered non-negotiable and knowing
that we are In conflict with the laws of neigh
boring and many Eastern States which have
adopted a uniform law for negotiable Instru
ments; and whereas, the attempt to adopt the
came law for this State failed. Therefore be It
Kesolved, That the members of this associa
tion will by petition and otherwise severally
labor to procure the tnactment cf a law at
the next session of the State Legislature au
thorizing in some form at the option of parties
interested the extension of the corporate ex
istence of corporations.
Whereas. The corporate existence cf sundry
banks, members of this association, fixed In
their articles of corporation will be reached at
an early day; and whereas, it Is desirable for
the banks themselves,' their depositors and
debtors and the community at large that power
thail be given by the law for them to extend
the periods of their corporate existence without
the necessity of liquidation. Therefore
The resolutions committee submitted
the following, all of which were unani
mously adopted:
Resolutions Adopted.
A paper on "The Client of a Country
Bank." by J. J. Morey of the Pajaro Val
ley Bank, was read by W. B. Porter of
Watsonville.
C. W. Bush of Yolo followed with the
subject, "'Banker and Patron." His pa
per mentioned the relations that should
exist between these two.
"Corporations as Bank Customers"
was handled by James K. Lynch of the
First National Bank of San Fr^icisco.
Be termed the present era a "corporation
age," and said the public little realized
the magnitude and number of great in
dustries In the country, nor as yet were
thfir benefits appreciated or their dan
gers thoroughly denned. He said it was
most important for bankers to know ex
actly the liabilities of shareholders of
companies organized under the laws of
other States. He urged that bank man
agements be careful in dealing with cor
porations of the latter nature and to
make the transactions so stringent as to
discourage the formations of the con
cerns under the laws of other common
wealths. The transfer of stock by share
holders was referred to and it was sug
gested that it would be wise to adopt a
law that would compel such a move to
be made known at the County Clerk's
office.
Treatment of Corporations.
At the morning session, Henry Brunner
of the Germania. Trust Company of San
Francisco read a paper on "Some Essen
tials of the Modern Corporations." It ex
plained the banking business, in clivers
ways, conducted Tilth corporations, and
offered many suggestions of changes in
the laws that govern the latter that
might well be adopted in future legisla
tion.
SAN JOSE. May 3Lâ The California
Bankers* Association completed Its busi
ness sessions this afternoon and adjourn
ed sine die. To-morrow their entertain
ment at the hands of the local financiers
will cdnmence and they -will be feasted
and taken for a drive to Alum Rock Park
end other points of interest abaut the
city. The session just closedâ the eighth
âis declared to have been the most Inter
esting In the history of the association.
The convention declared itself In favor of
legislation extending the corporate ex
istence of banks without -tbe necessity of
liquidation, a uniform law in regard to
negotiable notes and instruments and .a
resubmission to the voters at the next
ceneral election of the amendment ex
empting State and municipal bonds from,

Professor Howard of the Stanford Uni
versity delivered a' lecture last night at
Metropolitan Hall on the famous Persian
astronomer-poet, Omar Khayyam, and
his sublime poem, "Then Rubaiyat." He
explained why the translation of the
poem by Edward FitzGerald did not ac
cord in all instances with the thought' and
philosophy of the original. He stated that
while an English poet was the first to
make a fitting tran&latlon of "The Rubai
yat," the. American people were the first
to appreciate Its merit. . â¢ Â¦ " : j

Reiterates Her State
ment Under Cross-
Examination.
Ex- Judge . James G. Maguire yesterday
cross-examined little Kum Ylng, the child
taken from the home of her master, Gin
Leung Gow, by Donaldina Cameron of the
Presbyterian Chinese Mission for the pur
pose of showing that she was not, as she
claims, sold into involuntary servitude;
but the purpose failed. The technical
questions put by Judge Maguire In cross
examination were cleverly parried by the
tiny Chinese maiden and she rigidly ad
hered to her original statement that some
thing over $200 was paid for her. ,-â¢;..;'
Judge Maguire handed her money to
count In order to ascertain whether or
not she could count $200 If such a sum
was laid before her. She counted the
money without hesitation, explained her
knowledge of the difference between the
value of gold and silver and finally left
Judge Maguire without more questions
and the audience, at least, with a fixed
impression that her story was true. .
After the child left the stand an affi
davit, sworn to by Ho Tow, Chinese Con
sul General, Intending to correct the im
pression that involuntary servitude or
slavery exists in the households of many
of the Chir' . merchants of this city,
was read, -n iiÂ«e affidavit Ho Yow says:
Though I believe the statement to the effect
that such so-called slavery exists in the fam
ilies of many merchants in this city was made
In good faith, it is erroneous. There is a eys
/tem of domestic service common among the
Chinese by which the poorer children are
bound by contract to those able to care for
them. It is an apprentice system, not a sys
tem of slavery, . and when the apprentice
reaches a certain age she in free to return to
her parents or her guardians, â¢who must find a
suitable husband for her. It Is a system uni
versally adopted in China for the protection
of the poor children. In China the females
outnumber the males, and as there are no
industries In which these millions may be em
ployed, it is necessary that such a system ex
ist for their protection. They are always
clothed, boarded and otherwise cared for and
ofttlmes are paid for their services, which, In
any event/keeps them from being turned Into
the world to meet a much more deplorable
fate.- Â¦.-Â¦:
It Is unjust and unwarranted to class these
apprentices with the unfortunates who I are
forced Into real slavery. These suggestions
may not fc*Â» relevant to the case on hearing,
but on behalf of the Chinese people I make
this answer. If this custom is abolished a
place and ways and means must be found to
care for the millions of poor Chinese girls.
Under the present conditions, however, the
system Is necessary and the good th.at results
therefrom must be apparent. '
The Consul General's affidavit was or
dered placed among the records of the
case by Judge Coffey, notwithstanding the
objection of opposing counsel.
Some evidence was Introduced by both
sides, after which a continuance was
taken until this morning. ,* ;'
KUM YING SAYS
SHE WAS SOLD
I brought this action, first, because: I be
lieved the allowance of the demands of these
county officers out of the school fund to be
a serious attack on the charter. - It amounts
to nothing more or less than Incorporating
Into that instrument, a' State statute, which
the recent civil service cases show to be
clearly unconstitutional, and then attempting
to - spend the school funds under such ques
tionable authority.* ' ' .,' â¢ ,"
Second because even if the demands should
ultimately be upheld by the court, I desire to
protect the record of the administration from
the accusation of rushing to pay $600 per
month out of the school fund before obtaining:
the opinion of the -City Attorney, upon de
mands which have been declared illegal by
two attorneys for the board, one of them be
ine President* Kincaid's special counsel. Pro

SEEKS TO HAVE PAY

School Director Denman Goes After
Superintendent Webster's Sub
ordinates in Court. v V>- â-
School Director "benman has filed a pe
tition to restrain Auditor Wells from
jmditing the demands of Deputy Superin
t^dents of Schools W: D. Kingrtmry. Dr.
W B Howard, D. J. Sullivan and R. A.
Jordan, who have , been receiving
$1=0 a, month for ' their services.
Denman alleges that there is no
authority for the payment of sal
aries to these deputies, and says he con
siders the allowance of the same to them
"a serious attack upon the charter." On.
the other hand, it is stated that Denman
Is actuated by personal motives. In any
event the other members of the board
refuse to join Denman in his suit and hold
that the deputies are necessary for. the
proper conduct of the department over
which they preside. ' Â¦Â¦_ . " . . '
Concerning the stoppage of the Deputy
Superintendent's demands on the school
fund, Denman says:
VINCENT'S school, conducted
:^j^ by the Sisters of Charity, and at-
to St! Patrick's parish,
will hold - its annual commence
ment this year on June 7 at 2:30 p. m., at
the Grand Opera House. Apart from the
ordinary importance attached to a com
mencement, the event this year is one of
surpassing interest to the sisters and
students of St. Vincent's, not to mention
their many thousands of friends, who are
now and have been .members of St. Pat
rick's parish. The affair will be" con
ducted this year on a scale of great mag
nificence. Both priests and laity are,
working energetically to make this com
mencement a memorable one in the his
tory of parochial education.
"If any one," she said, "came down
from heaven and told me that my son
â¢was not insane when he committed the
deed with which he Is charged, I would
not believe him. It Is so foreign to- what
he has done before and. knowing his ideas
of euch things as I do } I know he could
not have done it if not of unsound mind.
Nobody, not even Christ himself, could
make me believe my boy was not of un
sound mind when he did this thing."
At this point she became hysterical,
and after a few moments ?he was able
to continue, t-hc said: "If my boy had
done Ihls wrong knowingly and brought
thle sorrow on my gray hairs I would
turn my tack on him and would not look
on h!s face again. Our name has been
po pure and good." She burst into a hys
terical fit of crying, and after a minute
or' two sobbed out: "He Is Insane; oh, I
know he is insane." She was led from
the etand sobbing as It her heart would
break.
The defendant's wife also testified as to
certain Incidents which made her believe
that he- was of unsound mind. She is a
quiet, refined looking lady, and her ap
pearance and testimony had an apparent
Effect on the jury. The trial will be con
tinued this morning.
Among the witnesses examined yester
day for the defense were: James T.
Gorgensen. salesman In Nolan's shoe
store; Policeman P. E. Fraher; T. M.
Eherman, cashier In Hooper, Jennings &

Oakland; William H. Nolan, shoe dealer.
Market street, and Joseph Xolan; George
D. Winn of Seattle; James A_ Deering;
Hester Ford Cornell, sister of the defend
ant, and Mrs. Pauline Ford, his mother.
The evidence of the mother of the de
fendant was dramatic. She testified that
he was always a good boy and supported
her. He got work where he could, but
no matter where he was he always look
ed after her. He never went out at
night, and never to her knowledge drank.
He furnished e. house for her and his
wife in - comfortable style.

ceived with ringing cheers.
After the palmistry diversion came the
pilgrimage of farewells. In the science
hall Miss Medora Block made the speech
of farewell. Miss Lois Kohn said good

farewell to mathematics, Miss Alice Baer
took leave. of history. Miss' Annie Fisher
made the adieux . to English and Miss

pointed and clever. * They abounded with
a spirit of fun, a touch of sarcasm and a
deep note of regret for the teachers and
the schoolthe girls were about to leave.
Luncheon followed the pilgrimage. Dur
ing the service of a dainty menu there
was a programme of music and song, in
which Miss Leila Samuels, 'Miss Jessie

droning chorus of "Glory Hallelujah."

was laid aside and the jinks in good

A lengthy protest against the action! of
Judge Dunne in summarily demanding the
closing of its labors and a compliment to
the Board of Supervisors on the cleanly
condition of the City Hall concludes the
report. A new -Grand Jury will be Im
paneled in a few days. - Â¦ "-> -,
recommendation is made that "an amend
ment to the charter taking the appoint
ment of officials from the Mayor and giv
ing the election of the same to the people
as heretofore" be made. v â¢ :
Because Mavor Phelan did not remove
Chief of Police Sullivan at its behest the
Three features are embodied In the re
port that are of public Interest. One is
the recommendation that a new County
Jail be erected between Brenham place,
Washington, Clay and Dupont streets.
Another is to convey prisoners In electric
motor vans over the lines of railway to
the various Jails to which they may be
sentenced. A shower bath for the nurses
In the City and County Hospital, in the
absence of hot water, Is likewise urgently
recommended.
The jury was impaneled on December
28, and during the five months of its ex
istence has received eight complaints, on
which four Indictments were found. Of
the latter the Sullivan bail bond forgery
cases were the only ones of any signifi
cance.
Sheriff Lackmann comes in for a due
share of commendation for his manage
ment of the county jails. Attention is
called to the management of the City and
County Hospital and suggestions made
that the spaces devoted to the storage. of
old tins can be turned into lawns, and
that certain trees be removed. Details as
to the minor wants of the hospital are
fully net forth. . â¢ :.
The management of the Almshouse is
given praise. The need of sewers in sev
eral portions of the city is considered
in the next paragraph. The management
of the Recorder's, County Clerk's and
clerk of the Justice Court's offices is
highly commended. The new Morgue
building is declared to be unsanitary. The
other city officials are complimented, ex
cept the Police and Fire Commissioners.
The heads of both are taken to task. In
the matter of the Police .Department re
iteration is made of portions of its pre
vious report. Secretary McCarthy of the
Fire Department is accused of violating
the spirit of the charter in the purchase
of supplies and the transfer of men from
one position to another. .: > ; :;
"L<et it be filed in the records of the
court," said the Judge. "The Grand. Jury
is dismissed from further service."
Then the voice of the bailiff rang out,
making the formal announcement that
court was adjourned. . <Â¦>:$' *;..'.Â¦.â¢Â¦"
Only twelve members of the jury were
presenl when the report was presented.
Judge Dunne told them early in the after
noon that if they could not secure a quo
rum he would receive the report any
away. Foreman Dunker handed the doc
ument to the Judge, saying:
"This" is the final report of -the Grand
Jury."
Without the customary expressions of
good will on the part of the presiding
Judge of the Superior Court, the Grand
Jury yesterday afternoon went out of ex
istence. Rumor has It that owing to
Judge Dunne's intimation conveyed 1 re
cently in a letter to each Jucor that he
would be pleased if they â¢ ended their la
bors it was Intended, in the final report,
to grill the Judge. But the latter care
fully censored the report before it was

"It resembles Just such hatchets as are
ueed by fruit or poultry dealers," said he.
*'X am not thoroughly satisfied that the
blood on it Is that of a human being. If
It was the property of a poultry dealer it
could be reasonably supposed that the
blood was that of a chicken. Another
thing that puzzles me is the failure of the
dootors who examined the body to agree
whether the wounds were inflicted by a
hatchet or a knife. Until that Is definite
ly settled there is little satisfaction in
looking for the owner of the hatchet."
Both Captain Seymour and Detective
DilJon are satisfied that the boy Is mis
taken in the Identification of the hatchet.
At least a dozen people who were robbed
of hatchets visited police headquarters
yesterday to look at the bloody weapon
which It is supposed was used by the
murderer. None of them, however, could
Identify the weapon. Captain Seymour la
Inclined to believe that the hatchet found
by the police belonged to a poultry and
lruit dealer.
"I am satisfied that Lukherath did not
commit the murder," remarked the head
cf the detective department last night.
"While there are several discrepancies in
his statement, particularly as to denying
that he was acquainted with young His
lop, I am convinced that he is not the
murderer."
Thus tar the police have been unable to
lind an owner tor the hatchet which was
used in killing the unfortunate boy. Yes
terday Captain Seymour thought he had
found an owner for It in the person of
F. Lu Turpin, who lives at 40 Bartlett
street. About two months ago a tramp
went to the residence of Mrs. Turpin and
aeked for something to eat. He claimed
he was hungry ana volunteered to chop
wooq if he was given a meal. Mrs. Tur
pin and her son .Floyd were home at the
time, and as the leliow seemed to be in
need of food they first gave him a meal
and then set him to work cutting wood in
. the back yard. While their backs were
turned the tramp picked up the hatchet
and left the place.
On learning of the episode Captain Sey
mour sent Detective Tom Dillon to inter
view the Turj>lns.
Armed with the bloody hatchet which
â¢was found contiguous to the Hislop resi
dence on the night of the murder Dillon
vent to the house yesterday and allowed
Mrs. Turpin and her son to inspect It.
After carefully examining it Mrs. Tarpin
declaied that it was not the hatchet that
had been taken by the tramp. Her son,
however, was positive that it was the
hatchet. Mrs. Turpin explained to the
detective that the hatchet which was
fctolen did not have claws like the one in
the possession of the police. In contradic
tion of her statement her son, who is
r.hout 17 years of age, declared that he
was sure that the hatchet Btolen from
them had claws. '. i-
Herman Lukherath, who was arrested
on suspicion of having murdered Robbie
Hifclop. will be released to-day. Captain
of Detectives Seymour will not detain him
any longer pending a possible "solution of
the mysterious murder.

INEW TORK, May 3Lâ Bradatreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
At the beginning of this week the transac
tions at the Stock Exchange fell off in a way
which gave Wall street . not a. little anxiety.'
The foreign markets were closed on " Monday
for the Whitsuntide holiday,' which partly ac
counted for the extreme dullness, but apart
from this there was every 'evidence that the
American public had liquidated the main - part
cf its' speculative holdings and was .' disposed
to take further part in the proceedings. The
heavy decrease In the New York bank Joans
shown by the two last clearing house state
ments afforded striking evidence i as to this
and as to the effects of the recent severe blow
the speculative market had received. It would
seem, however, that the liquidation necessary
under the circumstances had; been finished and
that the losses incident to the Northern Pacific
corner were in the main adjusted. Some anx
iety ' made itself felt in this Â¦ latter connection
as to the position of the London Bhort interest
though it would seem that the amount and im
portance of the .latter had been exaggerated.
The most * cheering . indications . which the
market received were the fact that settlements
were 'being made with the London bears In
Northern . Pacific at 150 for the stock and
that the fortnightly account â¢ which began on
Wednesday. was being. carried out without the
dreaded complications. Up to this time our
market's dullness was attended by a heavy
tone In the general .list, in spite of the firm
ness of a few issues. In which manipulation
and reports of coming deals had - an effect.'
The . bearish operators were also more i active
and the appearance of the market justified to
some â¢ extent the â¢ expectation of . a further : de
cline. . More favorable Indications at ', London
had, however, a good influence, - which was sup
plemented by decided 'intimations that the
contending factions in' Northern Pacific had
reached a v satisfactory Â¦â¢ settlement . as. to. the
control of that company, and 'the bearings of
the Burlington deal. . . Vi

XEW YORK. May 3Lâ The stock market de
veloped quite a buoyant tone to-day and the
activity was still further Increased, giving
the market a good deal the appearance again
that it offered during the boom period. The
strength became very general during the pro
gress of the day, but the effect was in part
sympathetic and flowed from the conspicuous
strength of prominent stocks. The current
conjecture in the Btreet pointed' to a conclu
sion that the movement of the principal
stocks was due to operations by the Harriman-
Rockefeller-Gould element and to those of the
Pennsylvania Railway In retaliation. The ad
vances scored in the London market during
the holifiay yesterday and before the trading
was commenced here to-day gave the market
a good start at the opening and there were
many grains ranging between 1 and 2 points.
After the preliminary reaction to selling. to
take profits by the buyers of Wednesday Atch
ison moved very aggressively upward on an
absorption of thousand-chare lots. During the
rest of the day there were successive devel
opments of similar movements In other stocks,
notably Pennsylvania, Union Pacific, Southern
Pacific, Missouri Pacific and the Southern
Railway stocks. The buying of Atchison came
from many sources, apparently In an effort to
disguise its origin, but the prevalent opinion
was that a large part of it was for Philadel
phia account and In the interest of the Penn
sylvania Railroad. A large speculative pool
was also active in the stock and helped along
the advlnce by . manipulation. The buying of
Southern Railway was attributed to the same
source, and t confident predictions were heard
that announcements would soon be made of
a Pennsylvania controlled company. The ad
vance in Atchison reached 5%, In the preferred
2%. Pennsylvania 3% and Southern Railway
3% as a result of this buying. -The movement
In* Union Pacific, Missouri, Southern Pacific
and the Southwesterns generally was almost
equally impressive. Union Pacific rising an ex
treme 4%, Kansas and Texas preferred 3%,
Southern Pacific 3% and Missouri, Pacific Z\L.
The- street was full of well-defined rumors that
a settlement had been agreed upon between
the contending interests In Northern Pacific.
v.-hieh would result In even stronger conditions
Jn the railroad -world than at present.' This
was the underlying cause of the strength in
the market, but the railroads in the Southern
region responded much more notably than
those In. the Northern region. New York Cen
tral rose 2% and Baltimore and Ohio 2%, ap
parently in sympathy with Pennsylvania. - The
eo-called. Great Missouri Pacific retained Its
full force as a factor. The decided strength of
the steel stocks also had a considerable influ
ence. There was talk of an early dividend on
the common stock. It advanced 2Â»i and the
preferred t%. Amalgamated Copper rose nearly
4 points In spite of the reported formation of
an opposition corporation. The combination of
the opposition was said, to be preliminary to
Its absorption by the Amalgamated Company.
The etock reacted later and closed with a net
pain of less than 2 points.' There were gains
â¢ I from 2 to VA Doints In a number of other
industrials. 1 Â¦-.--.->.. â¢ . -Â¦â¢

Northwest. Broomhall was bullish on. the Con
tinental situation, and estimated that European
requirements of American. wheat, for the com
ing year. would be 240,000,000 bushels.' .The out
siders bought September' and the pit crowd sold
July. Complaints of Hessian fly were increasing
and offerings were very light. Louisville was a
large buyer of September. At the close the lo
cal crowd sold on reports of rain at Huron, S

"Xuts are very quiet, except Jordan shelled.
which are* higher and wanted. Holders were
very firm yesterday at SSc. some asking up to
89c. Stocks of Jordan* are believed to be
light."
"About the only business worthy of special
mention is In Imported Sultanas, sales aggre
gating 900 boxes being reported in the past
forty-eight hours at prices around 12c, 13c and
14c for 2-crown. 3-crown and 4-crown. Some
little trade Is reported In Valencia layers, also
at 7c. There is rather better buying of cur
rants by the country trade, but males are alto
gether for immediate wants. Oregon 3O-40s
prunes are firmer, none being heard of under
t)' 4 c, with not many available at that price.
Other sizes of Oregons are virtually exhausted.
California, prunes are wanted in a small way
only. ..
"Dried fruits are quiet throughout practically
the whele list, but the market generally is held
fslrly steady, owing 'almost entirely to the
fact that spot stocks in nearly all lines are
extremely light. With the prevailing dullness
and anything like normal supplies at this period
there is no doubt whatever that the market
would be in very bad shape. Currants and
apricots are held very firm, but unquestionably
prices on any other line of goods could be
Â¦shaded for round lots. There is almost no In
quiry for sizable quantities, however, and the
orders that are being filled are, as a rule, very

â¢ Heavy., brown goods have steadied under bet
ter Chinese inquiry, but local retail and job
bing trade is restricted by unfavorable weather.
Although It is between seasons with the silk
trade 3 there is a ' good demand and available
stocks of the more desirable lines are reported
light. The ribbon trade continues brisk, de
spite lowering skies." Carpets and upholsteries
improve and in staple clothing woolens' there
is more activity. This brings out raw wool
more freely, but there is not demand enough
to advance prices in the face of heavy stocks
and a large new clip coming forward. In fact
the accumulation of supplies has Â¦ had a dis
tinctly depressing influence and in the Phila
delphia-'-market" quotations' are perceptibly
easier. - The decline extends to the entire list
of domestic wools, although - not' more than
a cent in any grade. ; :
I Extended holidays abroad and a short one
in this country have tended to make the grain
markets unusually quiet, while corn has had
the added drawback of hesitation among
traders, Â¦ who have J not recovered from the
manipulation in the May option. Foreign pur
chasers were driven out of this market by In
flated quotations, as shown by Atlantic exports
In five weeks of only 9,436,265 bushels, against
17,341.065 Vast year, and 13,433,818 in the same
weeks of 1899. Each reaction in â¢ wheat is
quickly followed by recovery and much sup
port is found in gloomy reports from growing
sections. Insufficient moisture and low tem
perature are the chief causes of complaint and
injury from insects is-also rumored, but there
is always more or less loss through these in
fluences and the splendid condition earlier in
the' season gives reason to hope for an abun
dant yield. * - . â¢
Misfortune ' has also overwhelmed cotton
plantations, according to the pessimistic views
circulated . by traders and factories, who are
endeavoring . to sustain prices in the face of
heavy receipts and unsatisfactory conditions at
New England mills, where print -cloths have
been sharply reduced to 2%c in order to dispose
of the accumulation, which is said to reach
2,000,000 pieces. â¢
i There is a little less ' activity among manu
facturers . of â¢: boots and - shoes, some . of -Â¦ the
smaller plants . reducing time or ; closing, . os
tensibly for the purpose of taking stock. â¢ In
ventories would easily wait a month, however,
if orders were abundant. Salesmen in the
West and South are sending good orders for
fall delivery, but the local Jobbing trade has
received a setback from the continuous rain.
Leather is still strong and active for heavy
sole and high-priced uppers. Shipments of
boots and shoes from Boston have shown the
expected decrease, from the phenomenally large
figures of recent preceding, weeks,- but are still
very heavy and since January 1 exceed last
year's by about 7000 cases.
Iron and steel mills are working at full ca
pacity and more new plants have been v put.in
operation. Quotations are well maintained,,
without any effort to secure advances. Farm
ing machinery is a feature of the* domestic
business and there is ' no sign of decrease in
the export movement of these products, which
has attained enormous proportions.
"Rails are also going out freely to Australia
and South America. Railways are unable - to
secure freight cars and other supplies, while
structural work proceeds briskly with little in
terruption from labor controversy. . .'
While the weather in the East has hampered
distributive trade to a Â¦ large extent ' this j week,
rendering j the season In some lines rather un
satisfactory, \ the West Â¦ and. . South report un
changed conditions, Â¦ with operations - up
tothe recent average.' It is the season- when
crop dam'age rumors 'are always heard, and
they have come' from' many quarters, but prob
ably in Â¦ large part owe their origin to , specu
lation. There' is nothing as' yet to cause any
modification of the general estimates made re
cently and founded- upon the special returns
from" correspondents *of R. *G. r Dun & Co. The
labor situation is a little brighter. | Many strikes
have been settled and others ! are- expected to
terminate * shortly. ~ " . , .

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been two arri
vals of coal from British Columbia, 14,403 tons;
seven from Washington, 17.655 tons; three from.
Oregon, 1200 tons; .total, 33,258 tons. Although
arrivals have been liberal for the past several
weeks, , there is no accumulation In the yards,
and some of our wholesale dealers have been
endeavoring to get a reserve stock on hand
to prepare for emergencies. It is very mani
fest that the fuel consumption this year is
materially greater than last, when we com
pute the fuel oil that is being used by soma
of our largest factories, railroad companies,
etc.. which formerly utilized coal only. Prices
are well sustained, and values are now named
exclusively . by our coast colliery proprietors,
where formerly Australian and English pro
ducts were the principal factors in establish
ing quotations , for years past. It is
probable that the Australian list may bÂ«
swelled considerably within the next threa
months, for coal delivery here the latter part
of the year. This is almost assured, as wheat
tonnage must i reach here from the Colonies,
and coal Is the only available article to carry.
The oil position is bettering Itself somewhat,
and must continue to do so, as the manage
ment Is drifting into commercial hands, where
it will be Intelligently manipulated. Fuel oil
values will be advanced, and producers will
willingly pay 25 per cent more for it than thÂ«
present ruling prices."

SAYS HUSBAND'S CRUELTY
"WTLX. CUT OFF HER LIFE
The trouble originated when thre check
covering the rent for May Was presented
to the .Auditor to poet in his accounts.
The check called for J33S7 25, Instead of
J4GQ0, the full amount, as provided In the
lease of. the San Francisco Real Estate
and Investment Company to the i prop
erty. - ''.:â¢-
Upon > Inquiry the Auditor learned that
Hanson had accepted the check and given
a receipt in full for the rent. Upon de
n anding an explanation from Hanson the
Auditor was informed that .the difference
of $10 75 represented the cost of some re
pairs made to the premises by. 1 the lessee
company on its own account. .
â¢That is an irregular proceeding," said
the Auditor to Hanson, "and you must
correct it by requiring, the filing of a
clajjfi for the repairs on the part of the
company*."
Hanson muttered something about . the
Board of Education being independent of
the Auditor, in regard to the collection of
school funds. Wells emphatically replied
that the Auditor was a pote"nt factor In
the transaction. At this point Hanson
asked for his May salary demand and
the Auditor directed one of his deputies
to withhold it.
"That will not Influence me to alter my
action in this matter," said Hanson, who
had become excited. "I: will not be
coerced by. the Auditor or any. other of
flclal.'.' ' â¢ "
"I am the bookkeeper of the city' gov
ernment," said Wells severely, "and you
are a subordinate. bookkeeper. -.It, is my
duty to seÂ« that you perform your dutie3
properly, .and until, you do you will not
receive your salary."' -â¢ .. Â¦ Â¦-. . k Â¦Â¦
Hanson retired, very much subdued, and
at last accounts was trying to induce the
Auditor's â¢ deputies to give him * his de
mand. .... . ... Â¦ -; Â¦â¢: -.: ..,-Â¦-:.
John H. Hanson,' secretary of "the Board
of Education, ran afoul of Auditor Wells
yesterday and as a result his salary de
mand for May. will be held up until, he Is

Account -to Be Returned to the
Contributors.

tel management, having incurred some ex
pense in preparing for the function, pro

easy reckoning that the directors resolved
to refund to members the full amount
paid in by each subscriber to the banquet
club.- Two hundred and seventy members
contributed to the fund, each paying $7 50.
Checks were drawn yesterday, in favor of
the banquet ticket- holders and ln ; every

ered by the check. -. ...
The announcement that the club would
entertain the President and other distin
guished guests added quite a number of
new members to the roll, of .the club,. but
the a mounts received . on. account, of ini
tiation fees and. advance dues will not
offset the expense Incurred In preparation
to welcome the illustrious guests.. The
two chief receptions â one .in. honor of > the
Presldent.and the other in recognition of
the visiting Governors qnd Congressmen
added to the' league's prestlffe.

"You are under arrest."
NEW YORK, June Lâ The Press this
mcrning publishes a statement that L.
James Gordon, sales and contracting
agent in Russia of the Baldwin Locomo
tive Works, disappeared in St. Peters
burg last January and that his disap
pearance was caused by his arrest by the
Russian authorities on charges unknown
to the public The Press says:
"Baldwin received a contract for loco
motives, some of them now in use arid
others in course of construction for the
Tiaiis-Siberlan Railway. This contract
was for $2,500,000 and was signed shortly
before the disappearance of Gordon.
Whether that happened subsequent to the
p^ruinp of the contract or was the cause
cf the disappearance is not known."
Gordon's arrest is described as follows:
One night in January last Gordon was
seated in the library of his home dfctat
jnp some correspondence to his secretary,
Hfdg-es, an Englishman, when the police
officially entered. They touched him on.
the shoulder and simply said;
"You are under arrest."
Gordon matie no resistance: He 1 asked
to be allowed to finish his letter, but thc
re^uest was refused. gome letters al
ready written but unsigned were on the
table. He asked to be permitted to sign
thrm. This was refused. He was told to
put on his furs at once and enter the
sleigh Â¦waiting' at the door. On the day
ftxx-eedlng' the arrest a St. Petersburg?
paper contained the following notice:
"Mr. G- â n, a well known business man,
xv*s arrested yesterday."
Tho exercises of tha graduating class of
the -Lick School of Industrial Art* was
held at the school building yesterday.
There was also an exhibition of the work
of the pupils, and a . similar exhibi
tion of the work of the pupils of the Wil
merding School, which Is affiliated with
the Lick School..
In the morning there was a short pro
gramme In which there was an address
by H. B. Vrooman, the representative of
the Oxford movement here. He congrat
ulated the graduates 'upon the fact that
the course of study which they had gone
through had fitted them for creative work
and had made ' them . competent to make
their way. through the world with their
hands as well as , with their intellects.
There were also piano solos by Marguer
ite Schleef and Clarence P. Bradford, and
an invocation by Rev. E. F. Dinsmore.
Frank J. Symmea, acting president of the
board of directors of the school, presided.
The exhibition of the work of the pupils
caused a great , deal of favorable com
ment. In the LJck School the course of
study has been confined to the iron
trades; In the Wilmerding School it has
been confined to the building 1 trades, and
in each the exhibition of - work showed
remarkable proficiency. ~ ,
This plan of cooperation has been ent
ered into within the last year. It was
found that it would be better for the
pupils and would more' fully, carry, out
the designs of the founders of each insti
tution if they each took up a certain
branch of industrial work.. It was this
Idea which dictated the policy of estab
lishing the iron trades In the Lick and
the building trades in the " Wilmerding.
The qualifications for admission into
the Wilmerding' have been slightly
changed. It was Wilmerding's wish that
there should be plenty of work and not
much study, so the half year of prelimin
ary study will be abolished and with, the
beginning of the new term students will
be put at work at once. A further quali
fication is that the applicant must have
completed the grammar course in the pub
lic -schools.

Beginning -with the next school year a course
of ship drawing will be added to the present
apprentice course of machine drawing..
After the present year the apprentice course
of architectural drawing will be discontinued..
Any of the present second-year students of thÂ«
Lick School who mean to elect that course win
be transferred to the Wilmerding School.
The course preparatory for college will be ex
tended to four years. This course has always
been a difficult one to finish In three years, and
now that the -University of California has
added new requirements for admission to the
engineering courses, it becomes necessary to in
crease the time to four' years. ... .,'.

BOLD BURGLAR
IN THE TANKS
LOS ANGELES, May 31.â Viola Murphy,
a 10-year-old girl attending the,Boyd T
street public school, was kidnaped from
that institution at 1:40 o;clock this after-;
noon by her mother, who was escorted by
a man whose identity has not been re
vealed. Up to a late hour to-night the
child had not been recovered.: . V '"Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Viola is the daughter of William H.
Murphy, - who | resides " at . the corner â¢ of
Fourth and San Pedro streets. The mother
is Elizabeth Murphy, who deserted her
husband and child more than six years
ago, and, according to the police, went to
Arizona, where she lived a rough life . in
mining camps.
Murphy devoted himself to his' little
daughter, who for six years was appar
ently forgotten by her. mother. Mrs. Mur
phy.made her appearance in this city to
day in an unexpected manner. She pre
sented herself at the school in the after
noon and told the teachers that she was
Viola's mother and desired to speak to the
child. ' ; . . ,
Mrs. Murphy was accompanied by a
big man. As soon as the little girl was
left with her mother the latter and her
escort seized her and conveyed her to a
hack in waiting. The driver was ordered
to drive to the Arcade depot and to whip
up hia horses. . . â¢ Â¦' ...
Tho teachers, who had become aware
of the kidnaping, followed the. hack to the
depot and called the attention of some of
the railroad employes to the proceeding.
Before they- could act Mrs. Murphy and
tho man became frightened, put the child
into the hack again and were driven in
the direction of Nauds Station. There all
trace. of them is lost. The DistrictjAt
torney was communicated with and drew
up a complaint against the woman and
the unknown man, accusing them of child
stealing. A warrant for their arrest was
issued.
Telegrams were sent in all directions to
Sheriffs and Chiefs- of Police to stop the
trio wherever found. All local trains were
vainly searched by the police: there was
no trace of the kidnaped and kidnapers...
At 9 o'clock to-night the hackman was
located. He had just returned from a
trip to Sierra Madre, whither he had taken
Mre. Murphy, her daughter and the-un
known man. As soon as this information
was received Detectives Benedict and
Ritch were sent out to that place by Chief
of Police Elton. It is not likely that the
abductors will get out of the State.

INTO FORTRESS
SEATTLE, June Lâ Within a stone's
throw of the police station George Mulli
gan, a wealthy mining man, was held up
this morning and robbed of $17,000 in cash.
Not satisfied with getting Mulligan's
money, the footpads gave him a brutal
beating, thereby preventing his raising an
on 'cry. Â¦
The police were notified immediately
after the robbery took place, but they
have used every effort in their power to
suppress the details, and it was only after
persistent effort that Mulligan, the vic
tim, was located in the Alaska Hotel this
morning.
His head showed where he had been
beaten and his shirt and vest showed
where the highwaymen had used a razor
to get at the money, which was concealed
under his shirt.
Mulligan was on the way to his hotel,
walking along Main street, when the at
tack was made. He felt himself clutched
by an iron hand from the darkness of an
alley. In an Instant two men had dragged
him into the allev and a moment later one
of them struck him a terrific blow on the
head with a club. While he was in a
dazed condition his vest was ripped open
and the money was cut from his shirt. He
recovered consciousness in time to make
a strilg-gle. but another clubbing settled
him for the time being and the robbers
escaped.

The dogs which Hastings and Corbusier
took with them to Nome from. St.. Michael
are part of those he obtained on his trip.
They are quite Â¦ wild and never saw a
horse until they reached Nome. The dogs
attempt to attack every horse they see,
believing it some wild animal. ;
J. B. Hastings, manager of the Alaska
Commercial Company in St. Michael, and
C. R. Corbusier arrived in Nomtf the mid
dle of March, six days from St. Michael.
Corbusier's first trip was to the Tanana
station. Leaving St. Michael on November
8, he was twenty-one days in reaching his
destination and only ten. days in return
ing. While there he heard of a big strike,
through a letter he received from Charles
Grimm, on Myrtle and Slate creeks, in the
Koyukuk district. Grimm wrote ' that
they had struck gold at last on these
creeks; $100 to the shovel being the aver
age pay, and that wages were ?15 a day.
Corbusier's next trip was to the Kus
kokwim- to procure fresh dogs for the
company. He left St. Michael on Janu
ary 4, traveling over the divide from Rus
sian Mission to Bethel. Then he made a
wide circle to the. south .of the Kuskok
wim'- over the tundra to the foothills,
striking -the Kuskokwim Â¦- again at its
mouth, and from there back to St. Mi
chael on February 20 with twenty-five
dogs, which he procured for almost noth
ing, the finest dogs being worth about $15
each.'. - . â¢ Â¦ â¢-â .
In the twenty-three' Indian â¢villages
which 'Â¦' Corbusier visited in the Kuskok
wim district he found only one stove, and
he says that Indians live in their igloos
all winter without any fire, keeping warm
with reindeer skins and living on raw
blackfish and salmon. There is no wood
for miles on the tundra until the moun
tains are reached and Corbusier went for
days: without a fire, living, like the In
diana, on raw fish* Even at the village
he was , not able to procure even a cup
of tea, , ' - â¢ Â¦. '..
SEATTLE, .May 31.â In a . desolate and

There will be a new line of steamers to
connect Apia with San Francisco. Mr.
Kunst, who bought the land in German
Samoa known as the American lands, has
now bought two steamers from, the Union
Steamship Company of New Zealand.
The first, called the Rangoroona, is daily
expected at Apia and thence she will pro
ceed to Honolulu and San Francisco. Since
the Oceanic Company stopped calling at
Apia settlers and traders have been de
spondent, but now, in'Mr.Kunst's venture,
their hopes are being revived, and they
make no secret of their endeavor to
cripple the trade of Pago Pago, which
place is the great envy of the residents
of German-Samoa,
The balance of the lands held by Eell
man, Neylan & Hobbs of San Francisco
in trust for the Polynesian Land Com
pany has been sold to G. Kunst, who sev
eral years ago bought Vailima, the home
of the late Robert Louis Stevenson. This
transfer places the largest American in
terest in real estate in the Islands under
German control. It is the intention of
the new proprietor to send to Germany
for settlers to work the newly acquired
lands.
The German court of Apia convicted two
of the accused Samoans of the murder of
a Chinese last year. The principal. Pupu.
was sentenced to be hanged, and his ac
complice to serve fifteen years of hard
labor. Pupu suffered the penalty last
week. The night before his conviction he
endeavored to commit suicide.

and the Samoans want him to come back.
It is stated that he will not return until
Great Britain. Germany and .the United
States have carried out the promises
given to Malietca when he was In
ducted to abdicate the throne in order to
give the High Commission a clean field
to work upon. He was to receive an an
nuity and an education. T^ie promise does
not appear to be expressed in writing and
the High Commissioners may deny the
promise. Malietoa is positive that when
a document was handed to him by a per
son representing the commission and
which he was then induced to sign, he
was promised the powers would assist
him ii; his desire for a higherVeducation
and would make provision for his future.
Malietoa has written to the three powers
but so far has not received any satisfac
tory reply. Dr. Solp, the German Gover
nor, states that he has reserved a high
position in the Government for Malietoa,"
Â¦ In Tutuila on April 17 the American Sa
moans held a great celebration. It was
the anniversary of the hoisting of the^
United States flag in Tutuila and the

The only question remaining- to be dis
posed of In connection with Samoa is that
of claims arising out of the military oper

WASHINGTON, May 31.â One of the final
steps toward closing. up the Samoan ques

to sell at public auction the 5000 stands of
arms surrendered to' the high Joint Sa
moan Commission by adherents of the Sa
moan chiefs Malietoa and Mataafa and
brought to the United States in the auxili
ary cruiser Badger.
These arms have been stored at Mare
Island and have been a source of some
negotiations by the three interested pow
ers â Great Britain, Germany and the
United States.. Great Britain and Ger
many finally decided that it would be wise
to dispose of the arms and they, requested
this Government to sell them. The pro

the State Department, which will consult
with the other powers regarding the dis
bursement of the money to the natives

Doors of .His Ticket Brokerage Office
Are Closed for Good. .
Bamuel Newman, ticket broker, -who
conducted an office at 634 Market â¢ street,
has retired from the scalping buslnes. i
The ticket-brokerage business has been
a pretty disastrous venture for Newman
and his friends. It is claimed that he and
Chris Buckley, who was a partner In the
business, have lost close upon 57000 In the
past two years.
Ticket scalping is not a very lucra
tive business In San Francisco just at
present, owing to the low rates that the
Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe offer
and because of the precautions that the
corporations take to suppress the selling
of scalper's tickets.
About two months ago Mike Welch,
who was employed as a clerk for New
man, became Involved In financial diffi
culties. Newman had to make the dis
crepancies good and all his enthusiasm
in the scalping business vanished. New
man soon after this occurred stated that
he would retire from business,! and he
kept his word.
