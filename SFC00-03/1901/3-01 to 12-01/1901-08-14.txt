THERE was no contest to speak
of in Democratic circles yester
day. A majority of the Demo
crats participating In the pri
mary election cast their votes for
Republican delegates. It la
known that 300 Democrats belonging to
the Ralney-Maxwell forces of the party
joined hands with Martin Kelly yesterday
to defeat the Republican Primary League
ticket In the Forty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict. They signed the voting roll as Re
publicans and did not hesitate when chal
lenged to swear that they intended to vote
the Republican ticket at the municipal
election. It is estimated that fully 5000
Democrats went to the polls to help the
Republican bosses. Coin was freely cir
culated. In the entire city only 3633 Dem
ocratic ballots were called for and voted
yesterday. The fact is clearly demon
strated that the primary election law
must be amended.

'R&mey and Kelly Arc
Prepared to Sell
Nominations*
THE allied bosses, under the lead
ership of Martin Kelly, were- suc
cessful at the election yesterday.
In tie Fortieth District the Re
publican Primary League ticket.
headed by Thomas P. Woodward,
president of the league, was elected. In
several other districts tickets Indorsed by
the league were successful. The bosses
cla^m that Kelly has sufficient strength
to organize the Republican municipal con
vention and dictate the nominations, and
the claim appears to bo well founded.
For reasons best known to themselves
E2#X) registered voters refused or neglect
ed to participate in the primary election.
It Is easy enough to trace some of the
reasons for this apparent Indifference. No
doubt many of the 20.003 Republicans who
did not go near the polling places were
simply disgusted or disheartened by the
shameless conduct of the Republican
State Central Committee In lending Its
indorsement to the Kelly-Crimmlns Coun
ty Committee. Others refrained from vot
ing to preserve the right of petition to
place on the official ballot candidates
other than those deriving nomination
from the regular party convention. The
absence from the polls of the great mass
of Republican voters ran be ascribed to
general indifference to the management of
municipal affairs. The regular politicians,
the place hunters and spoilsmen partici
rated actively. Money was freely and
openly used to buy votes for the boss
ticket.
Democrats Sick of Phelan.
Twenty thousand Democrats who are
wesry and sick of the Phelan administra
tion refrained from voting. No doubt 5000
Democrats were rallied to vote for Re
publican delegates and nearly all of them
voted the Kelly-Crimmlns boss ticket.
The strength of the anti-boss Republican
column was overcome by the Ralney
Democratic push. In precincts where
Democratic majorities axe heaviest the
vote for Republican delegates was largest.
Democrats readily signed the . roll as
Republicans and were readily provided
with Republican ballots. It Is a weakness
of the primary election law that the push
politicians of toth parties may combine
to control the nominations of one or the
other of the conventions. Yesterday only
400G votes were thrown for delegates to
the Democratic municipal convention.
These votes were cast mainly by the reg
tilars of the Phelan-McXab-McDonald or
ganization.
The issue involved In the" election was
clearly presented to the people of San
Francisco by The CalL By declining to
participate In the election the voters of
â¢the Republican party signified their will
ingness to accept boss domination in the
convention. This journal made a clean,
consistent fight for the principles of good
local government. It had no candidates
to advocate. It had no schemes to pro
mote. It was grided by a purpose to pro
mote the good of the city, and It still ad
heres to that pnroose.
Independent Delegates May Bevolt.
Perhaps the independent citizens whose
names were placed on Boss Kelly's tickets
Jn BeveTal of the districts where the
Ixwses -were not cure of their strength will
revolt and refuse to take orders from
Martin Kelly, but they may not be able
to do more than enter protest against the
methods of bosslsm.
The delegates placed before the people
by the Republican Primary League rep
resented the true anti-boss spirit of the
party. The allied bosses under the leader
ship of the adroit and corrupt Martin
Kelly defeated the candidates of the
league. It would be useless to underesti
mate Kelly's triumph. He planned thÂ»
campaign In advance. It was by his order
that a provision was placed in the primary
election law giving the State Central
Committee authority to Interfere and
recognize a county committee. The law
was framed to cover this contest In San
Francisco.
Kelly Has Nominations to Sell.
Boss Kelly expects to sell the Repub
lican nominations to the highest bidder.
Smaller bosses may attempt to break In
for a share of the boodle, but Kelly Is not
the kind of a fellow to weaken and give
Jn after going through the political tun
nel for the treasure. Lynch, Herrln. Mac
kenzie and others of his followers may
bluster around and threaten dire conse
quences If a proper division of the spoils
Is not guaranteed, but noise will not
avail. Boss Kelly having gone to the
front to make the flgrht Is entitled as a
Â¦winner to make the division of the plun
der. He is the chief of the bosses. He
Is a delegate to the convention. His name
heads the successful delegation In the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District. It will
be the first name called on the roll of the
convention. Republicans of San Fran

At a meeting of the trustees of the State
Mining Bureau yesterday morning it-was
voted. that the mineral part of the show
at Buffalo might be transferred to
Charleston. The State Board of Trade
refused to agree to 1 this, being under a
bond for the mineral exhibit."- Knapp of
fered to furnish a. similar bond; but the
beard, declined the offer. .
\ The State Board of â¢ Trade yesterday
rejected' the "â¢ application of . J. V.
Knapp, special commissioner for the

fornia exhibit now at .Buffalo, to be taken
ta Charleston. S. C, for the show to open
December 1, 1901, and to close June 1, 1902.
Knapp addressed the board at some
length. He urged that there are 50,000
tourists who annually visit Florida and
who do not come to California and that,
as the exposition would be on their route
of travel, they would stop over. The ef

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 13.â Attorney
General Sheets has sent for a transcript
of the testimony of President Schwab of
the United States Steel Corporation be
fore the Industrial Commission at Wash
ington for use in a proposed investigation
into the concern's status under the State
anti-trust laws. He declined to state his
pians further than this.
Attorneys here think the United States
Steel Corporation can defy : the State offi
cials Â¦'for the reason .that it has simply
bought a majority of the stock of the
constituent â¢ companies ; In this State â not
the full properties. For this reason the
United States Steel Corporation is neither
a trust under the Ohio law nor a foreign
corporation doing business in this State.
The Secretary of State will to-morrow
forward to the president of the United
States Steel Corporation blanks similar to
those sent to other foreign corporations
doing business in the State, notifying the
corporations that the State is ready to
receive the tax due it under the law ap
plying to foreign corporations. If the
company refuses to pay the tax suit will
at once be brought to collect it. If the
corporation consents to pay the tax it
will have qualified, it is claimed, merely
to do a legal business in the State. The
Secretary of State and Attorney General
say they are convinced that the constitu
ent companies are doing- an illegal busi
ness in the State in that they are con
nected with a trust, and, whether the
United States Steel Corporation pays the
tax or not, proceedings will be brought
against the Ohio companies under the
anti-trust law.
The State of Ohio has no jurisdiction
over the United States Steel Corporation
as a whole, and if the corporation's re
turn to the Secretary of State satisfies
him that it cannot qualify to do business
in Ohio it is possible that the Attorney
General of the United States and the At
torneys General of all States in which the
steel trust operates may'be asked to bring
proceedings against it. Attorney General
Sheets admitted that such a course is
within the range of possibilities, but de
clined to make a statement as to his
probable action.

LONDON.- Aug. 13.â At to-day's session
of the South African Compensation Com
mission Newton Crane, counsel for the
American claimants, made further repre
sentations regarding the claims of nine
men who were expelled for complicity in
the plot against Lord Roberts. Major
General Sir John C. Ardagh. representing
the Foreign Office, read documentary evi
dence from the military authorities, in
cluding a letter from Lord Kitchener, to
the effect that United States Consul Adel
bert.S. Hay had been invited to visit the
men In prison and had declined to guar
antes the Integrity of these nine or their
worthiness to be allowed to remain. When
General Ardagh read an affidavit alleging
that James G. Maloney of New York, one
cf the claimants, was an "extremely im
pecunious drunkard and an associate of
ex-convicts." Crane interposed, saying:
"I'll inquire into the truth of the state
ments, and if they are substantiated the
American Government's pressure in re
gard to this claim will be circumscribed."
Chairman Milvan jocularly replied:
"We won't go to war about this." â¢>
Crane, in setting forth the position of
the American Government at the close of
the hearing, said that with two excep
tion?. Great Britain had made no explana
tion-of the arrest or deportation of Amer
ican citizens. He denied the right of de
portation either in peace or war until evi
dence had been taken of an infraction of
the law of hostility to the Government.
The United States would not be bound by
any narrow legal rule as to the damages,
but expected that the broadest considera
tion would be given to the demands of
these of her citizens who had been im
properly arrested and deported. Jt was
no excuse to say they had been given full
soldiers' rations and traveling accommo
dations. The American claimants were
net -soldiers. They were subjected to bru
tal physical sufferings and must have
compensation.
General Ardagh suggested that one of
the claimants should give oral testimony
and said that the British Government
would pay the witness' expenses. Mr.
Crane accepted the suggestion.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â The American
claims which are being presentd to the
South African Compensation Commission,
now sitting at London, are understood to
be those, presented to the State Depart
ment' and forwarded to Embassador
Choate. The Embassador was asked to
put the claims In the proper channel for
formal presentation and he was author
ized to secure the services of such coun
sel as migrht be necessary. It is probable
that Newton Crane, who Is referred to as
counsel for the American claimants, is
acting under this authorization or he may
be looking after the individual interests of
the claimants.

REDDING, Aug. 13.â Assemblyman J.
A. Hubbard of Shasta and Modoc coun
ties, and Charles Keeler, a young man of
Anderson, in which town Mr. Hubbard
has his home, narrowly escaped death by
drowning to-day In- the Sacramento Rivi
err. They were saved by the prompt ac
tion of their comrades.
Hubbard and Keeler are members of
the Alfalfa Club, a pleasure organization
of Anderson, and In company with ex-
Senator Frank Sprague and eight other
members of the club, started to take
a ride down the Sacramento River from
Anderson to Balls Ferry in a hastily con
structed raft. In passing beneath the
Terry railroad bridge the raft struck a
pier, 5 and Hubbard and Keeler were
thrown into the water. Hubbard struck
a timber and was Injured to such an ex
tent, that he could not swim. Simon L.
Rodshund, one of the party and a strong
swimmer, went to the injured man's as
sistance. He succeeded in getting him
ashore after a hard strugrgle. Keeler
could swim but little, but George Storey,
another one from the raft, swam to him
and carried him to shore on his back. .
BOSTON, Aug. 13.-Joseph A. Conroy ia
the Democratic Congressman-elect from
the Ninth Massachusetts District and one
of the leading members of his party in
this city. Joseph K. Norton is a member
of the Boston Board of Aldermen. It is
thought here that the third member of
the party is Patrick Bowen, a Boston
Alderman, who is in New York.
Conroy received a stab wound in the
back and Francis was wounded in the
thigh. The wounds of the injured men
were dressed and they said they would
make no complaint, even if the police suc
ceeded in finding the man who did the
stabbing.
From what could be learned at the hotel
three Boston politicians, whose names the
police give as Joseph A. Conroy. Patrick
Bowen and Joseph Norton, started the
fight. The Wall Paper Manufacturers'
convention is being held at the Gilsey
House, and a number of the delegates
were standing in front of the doorway
when the three men crossed the street to
enter the hotel. Conroy, it is asserted,
had some words with some of the paper
men, and in a moment a lively fight was
in progress. William F. Francis, also
said to be a wall paper manufacturer, was
attracted to the scene from a neighbor
ing restaurant and went to the assistance
of his friends.
NEW TORK,,Aug;. 13.â A fight which re
sulted in the stabbing of two men occurred
In front of the Gilsey House early to-day.
The police can give very little informa
tion about the row or what led to it, t.nd
no arrests were made.

QUARREL ENDS
IN A STABBING
Assemblyman George C. Brown, one of
Boss Kelly's devoted admirers, made him
self obnoxious at booth 106 at 28 Broad
way. He became involved in a quarrol
with Joseph Spohn and the police were
compelled to interfere. Brown was ar
rested and sent to the station-house, as
was also Spohn. When the latter returned
to the precinct another Kelly and-Crim
rnlns loafer took up the argument and
Spohn defended himself. He was then
sent back to jail, but was bailed out by
friends.
When the polls opened a crowd of' men.
who are known as "Chinese gin bums',"
gathered at the .voting place and deposited
their votes for the bosses."- The* policemen
on duty were disgusted with'the lot. They
had the unpleasant taskof bundling many
of the : bunch 'into; a; patrol wagon and
sending them to prison, to sleep off -the
effects of the cheap gin. Throughout- the
day Kelly and -Crimmins . men *- watched
over the, booth.' They'allowed no vote to
escape them. Intimidation was their forte
and they captured many ballots. The vot

The voting at Montgomery and Pine
streets was quiet and steady during the
entire day.

take votes away from the better element
of the party. The anti : boss party worked
hard- to win. ' Abe Ruef was on the- spot
all day. and used his personal influence to
win .votes. In Ruef's own precinct the
bosses made a special effort to defeat him.
They spent in the neighborhood of $4Gd<)
to bring this about. .More than fifteen
known Democrats , voted the . boss ticket
during. the day and they were promptly
challenged by the anti-boss party. -These
men, wh,o were known to be Rainey Dem
ocrats, swore' that they intended voting
the Republican ticket at the coming elec
tion. . Â¦ .
Forty-Fourth Assembly District.
With the exception of a trivial row be
tween two drunken hoodlums, the. elec
tion passed off quietly in the.Twenty
ninth District. Among the Kelly and
Crimmins workers were Denny Coleman,
Barney Hughes, Teddy Morris, William
B&tchelder, James Flynn, who was de
feated at thelast election for State Sena
tor; John Glynn, Deputy County Clerk
Corey, James Welch, ex-employe of the
Street Superintendent's office, and Deputy
Sheriff Dasher. Jack McNamara, with
several of his friends, made a hard fight
against the gang,- but to no avail. Â¦
Considerable surprise was occasioned by.
the failure of Jack Daughney, who for
several years has .bitterly fought the
Kelly-Crimmins gang, to show himself In
the district. Investigation- revealed that
Daughney, who conducts a saloon at 328
Fourth street, was induced Monday night
to "see" Phil Crimmins, and it Is reliably
said that he agreed not to take a hand
in the fight in consideration of being given
the nomination for Supervisor.

ICEW YORK, Aug. 13.â Helen Potts
Hall, who Is suing to recover the large es
tate of the late George Francis Gilman,
obtained an absolute divorce to-day from
Blakely Hall, the proprietor of several
publications, by a decree of Justice .Mc-
Lean of the Supreme Court. By order of
the court all papers In the case except the
decree were sealed, and the decree seems
to have been drawn to avoid any expres
sion of facts not absolutely essential. The
case was heard before a referee, but his
name Is not given. Such a trial Involved
the denial of charges made by Mrs. Hall
and an agreement of counsel for both
Fides. The name of the attorney for Hall
does not appear in the decree, and no ob
jection was made on his behalf. to the
confirmation of the report of the referee.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Aug. 13.-The
fact has just come to light that General
W. J. Palmer of this city, at the time
that Jie sold his interest in the Rio Grande
Western Rairoad for $6,000,000, about three
months ago. made a distribution of 1000
shares of the stock of the company, then
at 104, among the employes of the road,
amounting in all to : more than a million
dollars. Each employe, from section fore
man to general manager, was remem
bered, Vice " President I>>dge receiving
more than $100,000 worth pt stock.

Generosity.
General Palmer, Formerly of the Hio
GIVES THE EMPLOYES
A MILLION IN STOCK
"I myself, assisted by Charles N. ..Post
and George A. Sturtevant, will conduct
the prosecution. The outrage was so
gross, henlous and glaring that the whole
power of the State will be employed to
punish them, and, as I said before, we are
certain of bringing the ringleaders to an
swer for their crime. The punishment of
the convicted men will be either death or
life imprisonment."
"The trial will not take place until some
time in September, as the defendants have
got out a writ of prohibition against Judge
J. H. Harrington of Modoc County, and
that â¢will delay the case for a couple of
months. The State has more evidence
than it needs right now and Is ready to go
on with the trial to-morrow. We know
the name of every man connected with
the lynching and the exact degTee of cul
pability of each individual, and we will
make them wish they had respected the
law befor^we get through with them.
"About a month ago I sent Eugene
Thacker, a son of the Wells-Fargo detec
tive, and Fred H. Jackson up to Modoc
County to obtain evidence- against the
lynchers. They have been working in the
vicinity of Lookout ever since and haye
got enough evidence to make certain the
conviction of Eades, Brown and Levan
ton, the three men now -in custody for
participation in the outrage. You can also
publish the fact that these three men are
not the only ones who will be made to
answer for the hanging.
When shown the foregoing dispatch last
evening. Attorney General Tirey L. Ford
said:
"Thty were not a very brave lot of men
and they are now thoroughly cowed," said
Jackson. "They are all equally guilty and
will have to pay the penalty. I paid abso
lutely no attention to their warnings and
threats, and think I can -prove their
guilt."
Jackson says that the hanging of the
five men was entirely unjustifiable. He
reels confident, that a clear case N can be
made out against each member of the
lynching party, the names of whom he
had, but refused to divulge.
Jackscn is employed as a Wells-Fargo
messenger on the Jackson and lone stage
and made himself famous in the battle
which resulted in the death of John Son
tag and the capture of Chris Evans, |in
which fight he lost a foot. Shortly after
the Mcdoc lynching he appeared in this
vicinity, ostensibly to spend several
months at his wife's former home on
Churn Creek Bottom, near Redding, but
In reality to assist the State in establish
ing the identity of the lynchers. The pub
lic in general failed to suspect the occa
sion of his visit, but the guilty members
of the midnight party of Lookout did so
immediately. It now seems that their
representatives stopped at a Churn Creek
Bottom home, where Jackson spent a few
days as a blind, and, waiting upon him,
warned him to depart. Unmindful of this.
Jackson went straight to the stronghold
of the lynchers and, avowing the purpose
of his visit, began his â¢investigation. He
was again waited upon after his arrival
there, but declined to take cognizance of
threats made against him. He completed
his investigation . and departed without
molestation.
REDDING, Aug. 13.â Every member of
the mob which took Calvin Hall and his
three sons and Daniel Yantis from the
custody of a Constable and his deputies
at Lookout, Modoc County, several
months t ago and hanged them to a bridge
near town will be brought to justice. So
declared Fred H. Jackson, who has made
an investigation of the late tragedy for
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, and who
passed through here last night on the way
to San Francisco to make his report.
The steel corporation held its ground at
Chicago, Joliet, Bayview, Youngstown and
Columbus, the Kiskiminetas Valley and
the Carnegie group, with the exception of
the instance named. The strikers are con
sidering plans for breaking the decision
of Chicago, Joliet and Bayview to stand
â¢with the steel companies, but what they
plan to do has not been made clear. They
are charging some of the Western men
with both dishonesty and disloyalty and
there is a general desire among members
cf the Amalgamated Association here for
eome form of inquiry.
The Chartiers plant at Carnegie is
owned by the American Sheet Steel Com
pany. The orders to tear It down went
out this afternoon. It will be removed to
Leechbnrg, in the Kiskiminetas Valley.
The strikers were called together yester
cay by Superintendent John Kenry and
preliminary notice of the company's plan
served on them. Eighty strikers respond
ed, and Mr. Henry told them that the
fires would be lighted and all preparations
made for a start to-day. He said that at
2 o'clock the whistle would be blown and
IX the men failed to respond the fires
would never be relighted. The programme
as outlined was carried out, but when the
whistle sounded the men did not respond.
The fires were at once drawn and the
order to dismantle and remove the mills
was given. The officials of the company
said that the plant would be down and
moved within two weeks.
Removing Another Plant.
So far good order has prevailed, al
though the steel officials assert that there
has been intimidation at Wheeling, Mc-
Keesport and Pittsburg. Both sides ex
press their confidence of ultimate success
and are carrying forward their plans.
President Shaffer of the Amalgamated As
sociation will leave to-morrow for Wheel-
Ing. Trhere be Is to address the strikers.
The number of men out as a result of the
general order is now roughly estimated at
16,000. and on the three orders at 62.000.
Many strikers have found work in inde
pendent mills or at other occupations and
many are idle merely because the skilled
men are out.
The strikers made gains at Wheeling
and the steel officials admitted to-day that
Benwood would be closed down." Clark's
mill here is moving along full-handed, the
liindsey & McCutcheon Js operating: wita
a 6mall crew and the managers are plan
ning to open Painter's and Increase the
force at Lindscy & McCutcheon's. A break
in the ranks of the men who struck at
Painter's Is expected, but the strike man
agers deny that one will occur. Another
break is reported as possible at New
castle, but there are as yet no positive
Indications of It. The American Tin Plate
Company has a small force at the Cres
cent plant in Cleveland and is also plan
ning resumption at other points with non
union men. The steel corporation has or
dered that the Chartiers plant at Carnegie
be dismantled and removed to Leechburp.
Make Gains at Wheeling:.
The Bellalre plant, in which the men
Etruck on Sunday, was finally closed down
to-day, working short-handed until yes
terday afternoon. When another start
will be made is problematical. Several
hundred boys employed at the National
Tube Works at McKeesport went out dur
ing the night and day and their action
materially aided the effort of the strikers
to finally .tie up the plant. The works o're
going ahead short-handed, but the ranks
of the workers are thinning and the sup
ply of material is limited.
Ten men, five of them skilled, quit at
the lower union mill of the Carnegie Com
pany in Pittsburg and joined the strikers.
Their defection represented the first break
in the Carnegie forces of more than 15,000
men.
PITTSBURG, Aug. 13.â Neither Bide
moved decisively to-day in the great in
dustrial conflict between employers and
employes in the Bteel trade and the re-
Eult is still in the balance. The strikers
made gains at Pittsburg, McKeesport,
Wheeling: and Bellalre in the last twenty
four hours, but in the main the advantage
is etlll with the mill owners. Both sides
claim to be preparing moves that will
bring: confusion to opponents, but neither
eide has shown Its hand. The general
situation to-night can be briefly sum
marized as follows:

NEW .YORK, Aug. 13.â Justice Jerome
and officials attached to the District At
torney's ofBce held another judicial In
quiry to-day concerning the chary.es that
police officials have been accepting bribes
from keepers of illegal resorts. Frank
Moss of the Society for the Prevention of
Crime was present during the proceed
ings. â¢ <
Twenty persons had been summoned to
give testimony, among them Captain Wat
son A. Vrendenburg of the Oak-street po
lice station. Captain Vrendenburg's ex
amination lasted during the afternoon and
was adjourned and taken up again sev
eral times. Once he left the building in
company with Assistant District Attorney
Garvin. They came back in a few min
utes, bringing with them -Cetex- Delacey,
proprietor, and three assistants of an al
leged poolroom on Park Row, which
Frank Moss alleges was "tipped off "by
Captain Vrendenburg Friday night when
the. trap which has caused such a'sensa
tion was sprung.
When the session adjourned Justice Je
rome was ask 3d if anything had. devel
oped so far which lea to the discredit of
Whitney's testimony or its corroboration.
He said:
"Nothing has been adduced so far which
causes us to doubt Whitney's testimony.
Where the testimony of other witnesses
touches upon the same subject it is cor
roborated, and in no. case has his story
been diverged from."
"Will this testimony be placed before
the Governor?" . .
"If he requests it such would probably
be the case. A transcript of the original
complaint will at least be sent to the At
torney General."

Secretary of Dental Examiners' Board
in Chicago Arrested on Serious
Charges.
CHICAGO, Aug. 13.â Dr. Jacob H. Smy
ser, secretary of the State Board of Den
tal-Examiners, was arrested to-night on
two warrants issued by Judge Kavanagh,
charging him with forgery and with Issu
ing forged reports for the State board.
The arrest was made at the instance of
James H. Worman, United States Consul
at Munich, Bavaria, and brought to a cli
max his charges against the State board,
which caused Governor Yates to demand
the resignation of the members of the
body. After the arrest Worman declared
with emphasis that it was but the tlrst
step In what would be "one of the hottest
sensations in several years in Chicago."
Smyser was released on $3000 bail.
HONOLULU, Aug.' 6.â J. J. Dunne, act
ing United States District Attorney, has
written to Washington for instructions as
to the enforcement of the clause In tha
organic act of Hawaii, which states that
no corporation in the islands shall hold
and acquire more than 1000 acres of land.
The matter was brought up In a "suit of
J. B. Atherton against the "Wahiawa Su
gar Company, the defendant making a
claim that Atherton had no standing in a
court of equity, as he was violating, as
trustee of a corporation, the provision re
ferred to. This plea was overruled by
Judge Gear as having nothing to do with
the case at bar, but he called the atten
tion of the United S-jates District Attor
ney to the matter. Dunne secured a post
ponement of the case for thirty day3, un
til he could hear from Washington.
There arc many corporations here that
held thousands of acres, and the reply
frcm Washington is awaited with much
interest. Judge Gear held that the titles
of such corporations to any amount ot
land were valid, except against the Gov
ernment.

Â¦ Dr. Sanclemente has a considerable fol

received a mail report to-day from the
United States Consul at Colon under date
of July 29 saying that guerrilla fighting
had been goin;? on at different points be
tween Colon and Panama. The only at
tempt that the guerrillas have thus far
made to interfere with traffic on the rail
road is believed to be the one reported by
Consul' Cudger at Panama several days
ago. and it is believed that the arrival of
United States warships at both ends of
the railroad will deter the guerrillas from
Interfering with the property of the com
pany.
Acting 1 Secretary Adee also received
mail advices from the United States lega
tio"h-",at Bogota, Colombia, under date of
July' 8, which announce the arrest and
imprisonment of prominent friends of Dr.
Sanclemente, former constitutional Pres
ident of Colombia. The present govern
ment of Senor J. M. Maroquin, who was
Vice President at the time of the coup
d'etat by which Dr. Sanclemente was
deposed in July of last year, has taken
these measures upon information that the
Nationalists,' Dr. Sanclemente's support
ers, had joined with the Liberals, who are
said to be showing increased strength
and activity in the revolutionary propa
ganda they have been conducting in Co
lombia- since June, 1900, for the overthiow

CENSURE FALLS
UPON UILFOUR
JEALOUS RIVAL
SEEKS HIS LIFE
The attention of officials here has been
attracted to the manifesto issued by Gen
eral Uribe-Uribe, leader of the Colombian
revolutionists, ' declaring for a ."greater
Colombia," and although nothing of Â£>n
official nature has been received on the
subject yet it appears to bear out the
ideas held for some time as to the scope
of the present trouble. According to 'the
manifesto Uribe-Uribe is seeking to unite
the interests of Colombia, Venezuela and
Ecuador. There is an-entire-lack'of-offi
cial information here concerning the pro
gress Â¦ of affairs in either Venezuela or
Colombia. Whether th>Â« Colombian Min
ister actually has left Venezuela, as re
ported in a press dispatch from Willcm
stad, is not known here. Tho departure of

supporting the insurgents the difficulties
confronting the Colombian Government
are considerably increased.
Senor Herran. Chafge d' Affaires of Co
lombia here, is inclined to believe that
there is some mistake about the report
that Dr. Sanclemente's friends are.con
tributing materially to the support of the
Insurrection. He received cable messages
from Colombia until July 27. since when
cable communication has been interrupt
ed, and his dispatches of much later, date
than July 8 contain no information con
firming mail advices received by the State
Department: On the contrary, up to the
time when cable communication ceased all
of Senor Herran's advices tended to show
that quiet was being restored throughout
Colombia and that only scattered guer
rilla bands were in the field in oppositidn
to the Government.' - ; j
Direct news from General Uribe was ex
pected a week ago, but it did not come.
His friends were disappointed again to
day, when the steamer Zuiia of the Red
D line arrived without bringing a letter
from him. Dr. Restrepo said to-night that
he did not believe the report of General
Uribe's death, and hoped to be in a posi
tion to give positive evidence in a day or
two that he Is alive and fighting.
Senor Eduardb. Espinoza, ex-Consui
General of Colombia in this city, also dis
credited the storr; . / J
No direct news has been received from
General Uribe since June 15, when,- it is
said, he sailed from this city for Venezu
ela. Colombian officials said that he went
there to secure aid from President Castro
In- the shape of arms and ammunition for
the rebellion. Since then Dr. A. J.
Restrepo, the diplomatic representative
of the insurgents, has received indirect
information that Uribe reached Colombia
safely and is fighting at the head of 15.000
men. ' Â¦ â¢
Much excitement was caused among
Colombians here by the report. The
friends of General Uribe consider it.sig
nificant that the Colombian Government
has not sent the news by cable to its rep
resentatives, for the Colombian Consulate
here has not been officially notified. While
there is nothing definite on which to base
a denial of the report, the general's
friends discredit it on the ground that
several times during the rebellion a year
ago General Uribe was -declared killed in
battle.
El Conservador's authority for this re
port i3 a message sent by General Iguran,
in charge of the Colombian Government
forces at Rio Hocha, to the commander
in chief at Barranquilla. The Colombians
engaged in the fight at San Cristobal were"
led by Dr. Rangel Garbinas.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13.â The Times" to
morrow will say: According to El Con
servador, a semi-official newspaper ' pub
lished at Barranquilla, Colombia, General
Rafael Uribe-Uribe was killed at San
Cristobal, Venezuela, on July 27 while
fighting with the Venezuelan . troops
against the Colombian invaders. ;

You may have . a sample bottle of
Sv/amp-Root and a book that tells more
about it, both sent absolutely free by
mall. Address Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bing-
hamton. . N. Y. . When writing mention
that you read this generous offer in thÂ«
San Francisco Daily Call.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in* the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pain in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding pain in passing it, or
bad effects following use of liquor, winÂ©
or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during tho day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. K you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists in fifty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let it stand twenty-four hours:
a sediment or settling indicates an un-
healthy condition or the kidneys; if It
stains the linen it is evidence of kidney
trouble* too frequent desire to pass it. or
pain in the back, is also convincing proof
that the kldcey3 and bladder are out of
order.

located at a distance from Washington,'
whom he might wish to have appear be
fore the court. This was done because
it was taken for granted' that most "of

respect the professional zeal of the press

-WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.â Acting Secre
tary Hackett of the Navy Department
gave out a statement to-day in relation to
the witnesses to' be summoned before the
Schley court of inquiry. It is as follows: '
Beyond this statement Hackett declined
to answer specific questions as to particu
lar witnesses, especia'ly as to whether Ad
miral Sampson was on the list prepared
by the judge, advocate of . the court, and
he further announced that hereafter he
would decline to answer all inquiries re
garding matters relating to the Schley
court.
told that he would have a right to call
others as witnesses, and was also in
formed that -some of the persons named
by him might possibly be called by the
judge advocate. The whole thing is in the
preliminary stageâ to see to it that officers
of the navy who are cognizant of the
facts involved will be where they/ can be
readme! in season to attend as witnesses
if needed." â¢ . - , < ' ,

Then, with Postal Clerk Tulley holding
an empty mail sack, the robbers went
through the coaches and robbed every
passenger. They got J2S0 in one coach. A
negro who. refused to give up his money
Â¦was severely beaten. The passengers
â¢were compelled to throw their valuables
into the pouch. Superintendent "Sam
Gaines of the railway mail service says
he does not believe the robbers got much
money out of the mail pouches.
After the work was done the robbers,
who seemed to enjoy the situation, sat
around and laughed over the mattoer. and
one even went back into a. car to get
something. After holding the train two
hours the robber? left, going east Into the
dense bottom j timber for which Caney
Oreek is noted. The trainmen cut out the
wrecked express car and ran down to
Caney Station and advised offices up and
down the road. Within two hours posses
of United States marshals with blood
hounds were on the . trail. The express
company claims that it lost nothing, and
the conductor estimates the passengers'
loss at about $400, not counting the jew
elry. Both safes were demolished by the
explosion and the car is a wreck.
The robbers then put a charge of dyna
mite to the safe and 'blew it open. They
demolished the sate, but they got only
$150, as the money had all been left at
Muskogee, to ie picked up by the "Katy
Flyer," which runs through the Territory
by day. The passengers and clerk were
forced to assist the bandits in their work.
Every mail pouch was emptied and the
mail " considered valuable by them was
taken.

Dynamite "Wrecks a Car.
From -within came no resiÂ»onse. The
two men could not be seen. They waited
only the result. When there -sras no reply
from within the robbers again called out:
"Open the door or we will blow it open
and blow you to hell."
There was no response to _tne second
call, and the firing again began, and fully
twenty shots were discharged. Still there
was no response to the firing and three
men prepared a smaJl blast of dynamite
against the -car door.
In the meantime the shooting*had awak
ened the passengers. The first intimation
that it was a hold-up sent the conductor,
brakeman and porter back into the train,
and as they came in and called out "It's a.
hold-up," the passengers tried to hide
their money and valuables. The dynamite
blast was exploded. It was a small
charge and was intended more to frighten
than a-nything- else.
A larger blaet of dynamite was pre
pared and exploded. This did the work.
It tore the side off the car. The robbers
leaped through the opening and the
frightened messenger had nothing to do
but accept their orders. He was over
powered and narrowly escaped being torn
in shreds, as was his car. He was ordered
to open the safe, but he could not, as the
combination was .at .the end of the run.

The Tampico was built last year by the
Craig Shipbuilding- Company of Toledo,
Ohio, and is owned by the Hawgood Tran
sit Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She is
1451 tons net burden, 247 feet long, 42 feet
â¢beam and 24 feet de'ep. She will probably,
go into the local coal trade.
The Tampico took 102 days to make the
run.- She was caught ir. a big storm off
the River Platte and had to put into Mon
tevideo with her rudder damaged. She ar
rived there on June 11 and did not get
away again until June 28. The run
through the Straits" of Magellan 'and up
the Pacific Coast was uneventful. The
Tampico brings 1900 tons of coal, con
signed to the United States Government.
The new American steamship Tampico
arrived from Norfolk,- Va., yesterday.' She
is one of a ileet of ten vessels Â¦ coming
here, to go into the coast^trade. Of the
ones that have already got here the Asun

The schooner lizzie Prien also went

Tne Argus belongs to the California
Navigation and Improvement Company
and was brought down here about two
weeks ago to load shingles. She was par
tially loaded on the Mission mudflats, and
when last seen Monday night seemed se
curely moored. From some unknown
cause, however, the mooring line parted
and then the anchor dragged. Once in
deep water the anchor was off the bottom
and' the Argus went out with th'e tide.
The- Snow & Burgess arrived from the
Sound with lumber over a week ago, and
she is awaiting a chance to load.
The big river barge Argus, partially
loaded with shingles, was nearly wrecked
on Alcatraz last Monday night. She was
anchored in. Mission Bay, but broke adrift,
and went out with the tide. Off Vallejo
street she collided with the bark Snow &
Burgess and started a number of planks
in that vessel's -hull. Eefore the crew of
the barlccould secure her the Argus broke
away and soon disappeared in the fog.
Early yesterday morning the Spreckels
Towboat Company was notified that a
barge was ashore on Alcatraz, and the
tug Reliance â¢ ivas sent to tow her off.
When Captain Shaw got to the island he
found the barge hard and fast on the
beach directly I'nder the prison. A sol
dier was standing: guard on the cliff, and
as soon as the tug was made fast a cor
poral's guard went aboard the barge and
searched her for possible runaways.. Soon
after the Reliance started pulling on her
the Argus came off and was towed over
to the Pacific-street wharf.

Soon after the Encinal picked up the
men the launch " William D came along
and made fast to the derelict. The sloop
would not tow, however, and soon after
she seemed to disappear altogether. The
boatmen think that she will wash up on
Ooat Island. t
very narrow escape from drown
ing yesterday. Had.it not been for the
prompt assistance rendered by Captain
Harmsworth of the ferry steamer Encinal
all of them would most likely have been
drowned.
When' the ferry-boat was about ten
minutes out from Oakland mole Captain
Harmsworth saw a boat bottom up with
three men clinging to it. He at once al
tered the Encinal's course and stood over
toward the lighthouse on Goat Island.
When close enough the â¢ steamer was
stopped and a boat lowered. It took some
little time to get the men off the capsized
boat, as they could not help themselves,
and the men in the lifeboat were afraid of
drowning some of them. Finally they
were got aboard the Encinal and after
being given a restorative were sent into
the ttreroom to dry their clothes.
The men say the accident" was due to
carrving too much sail and too little bal
last. "We started out from Oakland
Creek on a iishing expedition in the thir
ty-ton sloop Pearl this morning,"- said
Coleman. "We sailed around Goat Island,
anchoring at different places, and made
a very good eatch. Finally it began to
blow and the sea got choppy. Then we
decided. to go home, and after heaving up
the anchor made a start. A few minutes
after we got under way a squall struck
the Pearl and she turned clean over.-
Luckily we got clear of her and managed
to clamber back on the keel. We could
not keep our place there, however, as
sometimes she would roll one way antl
sometimes another. Kach roll was enough
to throw us off, and then we would have
to clamber back again. This kind of work
in chilly -water soon tired us, and I think
in another ten minutes we would have
been drowned if the Encinal had not come
along. I suppose the sloop will be recov
ered, but even if she is not we ought to
be grateful that we are alive."

VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 13.â The steam
er Olympia, which arrived from, the Or
ient this morning, brings advices of the
trial of three Americans by United States
Consul Ragsdale at Tientsin. They were
charged with looting in Chankoechuang,
a Chinese village thirty miles northwest
of Peking. The accused â Richard Leslie
Butler, Alfred Plant and James "Winnâ
were sentenced to four years' imprison
ment each.
According to the complaint of Chang
Tuen Fang, which was made to the Amer
ican Charge d' Affaires at Peking by Li
Hung Chang under date of July 8. the
three Americans, together with H. F.
Piper, correspondent of a Shanghai paper,
and others, took a number of Chinese
carts to the Chinese village to loot tha
place on June 23. They broke into the / j
Chinese pawnshop and, firing a. fusillade '*
which frightened the Chinese, declared
the pawnbroker was accused of being a
Boxer leader and that they had come to
search the place for firearms. They strung
him up and bound all those in the store>
and, threatening further violence, de
manded payment of 5000 taels. The Chi
nese could only raise but 500 taels. Not
satisfied, they ransacked the place, keep-
Ing up a constant gun fire, in which one
man was wounded. While they were ri
fling the place a Chinese military patrol
approached the row of Chinese carts
brought by the looters and>the drivers,
becoming frightened, fled. They were fol
lowed by the soldiers, who captured one.
The Americans spent the night in thÂ»
pawnshop and next morning, just before
daylight, they left with a large quantity
of looted silver and jewelry. They seized
the pawnbroker's brother and made him
walk in front of them as a hostage, to
prevent the soldiers firing on the party.
They were subsequently arrested because
of a complaint laid in Peking and will
serve four years' imprisonment for their
offense.

The first event of the day was a 2:25
pace, for which a purse of $500 had been
hung up. It was best three out of five,
mile heats, and four entries responded to
the bell. Charlie Whitehead's sorrel geld
ing Toppy~ sold as a heavy favorite in the
betting, the bookies finally offering 6 to
1 against the field with no takers. Toppy
Justified the expectations of his backers
by winning In straight heats in 2:15%,
2:WA and 2:18%.
The second race was a running event,
five furlongs," with six entries.. S. F.
Capps' bay colt Gypsy Boy, with Burllng
ame in the saddle, took the lead and
showed a clean pair of heels all the way,
coming under the wire in 1:03.
In the third race, also a running event
at six furlongs, McLaughlin's Mike Rice
seemed to be a gen'eral favorite, but Ed
Corey's David S proved the winner In
1:14 at even money.

five furlong dash, went to John "Whelan's
speedy little mare Swiftwater in 1:01^.

Single-Scullers, Swimmers and Other
Athletes Will Go North From
i San Francisco.
The programme of the eighth annual
Astoria regatta has been sent down to San
Francisco by J. C." McCue, secretary of
the executive committee, and includes the
following events: Pacific Coast single
shell championship; consolation single
shell race; four-oared shell race; four
oared barge race; junior outrigged skin!
race; senior outrigged skiff race; single
pleasure boat race, and double pleasure
boat race. The single shell, four-oared
shell, four-oared barge and outrigged skiff
(senior-and junior) races will probably be
rowed off in heats. In the four-oared shell
race there will be four competitorsâ the
Portland, Victoria and Vancouver, B. C,
and' the University of California crews;
There will a(Â§p be four barge crews, rep
resenting the Alameda and Olympic Boat
clubs and the South End and Ariel Row
ing clubs. â¢
The Astorians expect Alex '"W. Pape of
the Dolphins to go up and defend his title
aa senior shell champion of the Pacific
Coast against the northern scullers, but It
is not probable that he will make the trip
this year. It is also expected that repre
sentatives of the Ariel. Alameda and
South End clubs will pull in the single
shell races. The prizes in all the rowing
events will be handsome gold medals.
In addition toMhe rowing events there
will be duck hunts, tub races, walking the
greasy pole, races in Chinese barges, div
ing and swimming under water, life-sav
ing exhibitions, high diving, swimming
and races in gigs between crews of the
United States vessels Philadelphia, Man
zanita and Columbine. The rowing races
will take place"on the mornings of August
29 and 30 and the sailing races In the aft
ernoons of the same two days. On. the
morning of the first day there will also be
a race between gasoline launches for the
cup presented by the" Union Gas. Engine
Company of San Francisco. On the after
noon of Saturday, August 31. the track
and field sports will be held, in which
teams will take , part â¢ representing the
Olympic Club of San Francisco, the
Multnomah Amateur.- Athletic Club and
the Young Men's Christian Association
clubs of Portland," the University of Ore
gon, Pacific University and Spokane.
Teams from Seattle and Tacoma may also
compete. . '
The coronation of the queen of the
carnival and the ball in her honor will
take place on the'nlght of August 29, and
on the next evening there will be an In
door athletic- exhibition, the principal fea
ture being a* wrestling- match between Mc-
Kenzie of the Olympic Club and Calm of
the Multnomah Athletic Club. There will
also be boxing, club swinging, tumbling,
juggling, exhibitions on the slack wire,
horizontal bar and flying rings, bag
punching and comic acrobatic feats. The
three days of the regatta will be pre
ceded by a street fair, in which will be
seen the people of the Elks\ carnival at
Tacoma. â¢-â¢ Â¦.,' Â¦
Altogether* if the strike does not pre
vent the sailing of the steamers for
Portland, transportation will be pro
vided by the carnival committee for thirty
athletes from San Francisco. . Â»

It is probable a delegation from the
Labor Council V.-I11 make a further formal
protest to-night before the Board of Po
lice Commissioners against the appoint
ment of additional special police officers.
"\Ve are more interested in this letter
which we have just received from Mayor
Phelan," said Secretary Rosenberg. "It is
in response to the conference we had with
him yesterday, and we will probably reply
to it to-day. For the present we have
nothing to say."
Nothing v.-as heard of the proposition at
the headquarters of the Labor Council,
where the executive committee .was in
session until a late hour, and none of the
members would express an opinion re
garding what steps would be taken in
case the proposition should be presented
to them.
Efforts to bring- together all those inter
ested in arranging: a plan of conciliation
have resulted in the suggestion that per
haps Benjamin Ide Wheeier, president of
the University of California, might prove
an agreeable mediator to both the labor
ing element ani the Employers' Associa
tion. President "Wheeler was in the city
yesterday afternoon and said he would
act if both side-; would agree to the prop
osition, but would not endeavor to force
himself into the controversy. The matter
will be presented to the Employers' Asso
ciation and the San Francisco Labor
Council to-day.
At the headquarters of tho City Front
Federation, the San Francisco Labor
Council and the Building Trades Council
the leaders in the strike movement were
busy catching up with neglected details,
and r.o move of consequence was made.
The rest seemed very welcome and much
accumulated business was disposed of.
OUTSIDE of the efforts of the vari
ous improvement clubs and retail
merchants' organizations toward
arranging- a conference with the
Employers' Association yesterday
â¢was practically without an Incident of

concerned. As it was a leg-al holiday,

The wholesale merchants spent the day in

plaintiff in suits to-day in the Superior

years. He came to Redlands from Kan
sas about two years ago.
SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 13.â George

What promised to be a bloody battle be
tween the police and the strikers was pre
vented on the water front yesterday by
the liberal use of clubs by Officers Mc-
Grath and McCormack. Sergeant Cook at
tempted to disperse a gang of man that
were hanging around the neighborhood of
the strikers' headquarters and succeeded
in driving them all away with one excep
tion. William Herley resisted the at
tempts of- the sergeant and gave him bat
tle. He struck at Cook several times and
then threw his arms around him and tried
to throw him. The men who had been
driven away came running back, and for
a few moments trouble seemed imminent
Officers McGrath and McCormack, who
were on duty at the Mission street whart
ran to the rescue of Sergeant Cook and
by using their clubs freely kept the men
back. An opportunity offered and Mc-
Grath brought his heavy stick down on
Herley's head, rendering him unconscious

ANOTHER PLAN FOB PEACE.
Secretary Lytle of the Master Painters'
Association claims that but two of ' its
members have signed the schedule. "The
majority of the employing painters who
have signed the agreement," he said, "are
small concerns that do not belong to the
association. They are bosses one day and
journeymen the next."
"The Building Trades Council at the
present time Is In possession of facts
which show that the employing painters
of this city and county, using 90 per cent
of the material are agreed to the request
of the council, and those of them who
have not up to the present time opened
up their shops are In many instances now
prepared to do so, and will in the future,
as in the past, resume harmonious rela
tions with their employes.- There are
ninety-eight shops operating at the pres
ent time, many of whom belong to the
Master Painters' Association and all of
which are in accord with the request of
this council."
According to P. H. . McCarthy, president
of the Building Trades Council, the strike
of the painters comprised In Unio'n 73 is
practically won. In consequence no meet-
Ing was held last night, but the execu
tive committee of the Building Trades
Council discussed the situation and later
President McCarthy made the following
statement:

Work on the. streets was suspended yes
terday by reason of the day being a mu

During the afternoon Frederick Drlscoll,
commissioner of the Newspaper -Publish
ers' Association, addressed the convention
in behalf of the newspaper publishers. He
congratulated the delegates upon the es
tablishment of the principle of arbitra
tion to settle differences arising on con
tracts between the publishers and their
employes. He advocated the extension of
the same principle to all differences which
might arise.
Details of the plan of separation were
not discussed and will be allowed to rest
until the preamble is acted upon by the
local unions. Both branches of the print

James Maddison, a marine engineer, liv
ing at East and Mission streets, swore to
a complaint before Judge Cabaniss yes
terday morning charging Policeman O. H.
Knight with battery. He said that he was
standing on East street Monday when two
or three strikers were fighting and a
mounted policeman. rode along and com
pelled them to fall back to the sidewalk.
He was crowded off. the sidewalk, when
Knight came ud to him and told him to
move on. He said he was walking as fast
as he could, whereupon Knight struck
him on the head with his club. Knight
surrendered himself at the City Prison
and was released on $10 cash bail. Knight
said that nearly 200 strikers were congre
gated in front of the entrance of the Mall
dock and got up a fight among them
selves to distract his attention so that
they could rush the gates and do violence
to the non-union men at work. Policeman
Meyers came along on horseback and the
policemen started in to clear the street of
the strikers. Maddison defied Knight to
make him move and the latter gave him
a shove. Maddison then called him an
offensive name and again defied him, when
he drew his club and hit him on the head
with it. In a few minutes the street was
cleared.

a union of all the conciliatory committees
so that their efforts may have more
weight with the Employers' Association.
There are now about five conciliatory
committees in the field, all working
toward the same end and formulating va
rious propositions looking toward a set
tlement. It is believed that If all com
bine in their aim arid select the most
plausible proposition the Employers' As
sociation will be readily induced to effect
a settlement. At the meeting this after
noon it will probably be determined to
call a mass-meeting of the retail dealers
for the purpose of entertaining a genorrtl
protest against the existing state of af
fairs.

Eight or nine thousand people will lose

Sailors' Union that a crew be permitted
to discharge the brig W. G. Irwin, which

REDONDO BEACH, Aug. 13.â The

from San Francisco last night a little
more than an hour behind schedule time.
The Santa Rosa is the only steamer that
has touched at Redondo in a week. She
brought the usual number of passengers

against the possibility of disaffection
among the boat's crew a high wooden
barricade was run across the shore end
of the pier and guarded by local peace
officers, who prevented every one passing

San Francisco, Aug. 13, 1901.
There is one point I desire the Labor Council to understand
and appreciateâ that whatever may be the merits of the con
troversy between the employers and the employes, I, as a law
officer, must see that legal rights are preserved and that In
the pursuit of them no man shall suffer violence if it may be
prevented.
This is the authority under which the Commissioners have
acted. The Chief will swear in no man for such service unless
after an examination he proves himself to be of good charac
ter. He shall be instructed in his duty by the Chief, who will
see that he does not exceed his instructions.
"The Board of Police Commissioners shall have power, at
its discretion, upon the petition of any person, firm or corpora
tion, to appoint, and at pleasure to remove, special police offi
cers. Such officers shall be subject to all of the rules and regu
lations of the board."
It was therefore a question for the Board of Police Com
missioners to decide whether the best interests of the city
would be served by granting' or refusing this request, 'ine
board decided several weeks ago that, as special officers, such
men were amenable to its rules and regulations, but as private
detectives or guards they would be wholly under the control
of their employers, ana for this reason the public interests
eeemed to dictate that they be put under the control of and made
responsible to the constituted authorities. This was the only
reason which prompted the decision of the Commissioners.
The charter, section 4, chapter III, article VIII, provides as
f ollows :
same privilege to others. Now, as a matter of fact, on account
of the excited condition of the public mind, many acts.of law
lessness have been reported here and there throughout the city
in neighborhoods which have had no police protection. There
fore the present plan of the Police Commission is to take the
regular police off the trucks and assign them to their 'beats.
When apprised of this the owners of drays decided to employ
gruards or detectives at their own expense to protect their
property and employes, and they furthermore asked that these
men be made special officers as authorized by law.
The Labor Council, In common with other labor organiza
tions, has declared its policy to preserve peace and order and
cf acting strictly within its legal rights while granting the
From my observation on that occasion I must say that I
fully acquit Mr. Newhall of any discourtesy or of any prejudice
or bias In the matter of which you complain. On this account
and for other reasons I am of the opinion that he will act
fairly and impartially as a member of the Board of Police
Commissioners according to his oath of office, which is to sup
port and defend the laws.
When by appointment I personally met the board they
promptly and formally refused to discuss the subject with me,
and as they preferred to remain in Ignorance of the real condi
tions I did not place much value on their previous expression
of opinion.
After receiving the communication I asked the privilege
from the officers of meeting- the board of directors that after
noon for the purpose of considering strike conditions, which
Â¦was granted. I then called upon the Governor and asked him
to attend the meeting with me and to Jointly propose a plan
for the Chamber of Commerce, as a body peculiarly Interested,
to advance a means of settling the strike. I did not ask the
Governor directly or indirectly to take any other action.
I would first call your attention to the fact that the letter
was not the letter of Mr. Newhall, but a communication from
the beard of directors of the Chamber of Commerce and so
signed* Messrs. Newhall and Scott certifying: as officers to its
authenticity as the act of the board. While I believe that the
communication was unwise and unnecessary, still I have re
garded It simply as an expression of opinion from the board of
directors of that body.

It is a pleasure to find an organ of an influential
Christian body that uses calmness. and reason_in the
discussion of this question. We agree with the Advo
cate tlfat if the deadfalls could be abolished and the
enlisted men were isolated from all > opportunity to
abuse an appetite for liquor, there would be no argu
ment left in favor ol the canteen. We fear, however,
that such isolation is impracticable. The Advocate
argues that it is, using as an illustration the abolition
The Advocate says that we have taken too seriously
the extravagant utterances of some of the radical tem
perance papers on the army canteen question. Upon
that question the Advocate says: "There is another
point in The Call's contention to which we give our
most hearty assent. The deadfalls that surround the
army posts, in "point of fact, are ten times worse than
the army canteen. But we are not in favor-of adding
to the temptations of the soldier by adding the can
teen." , *.l. \;
THE California Christian Advocate, in a kindly
and reasonble spirit, joins The Call in deprecat
ing the conduct of the Christian Instructor in
gloating over the death of the son of Secretary Hay.

PROPERTYâ J. M. S. C. City. If a
man marries a widow ard after marriage
purchases property with his individual
money, then it Is his individual or sepa
rate property and in no wise community
property. If the mother should die flrat
and she before death give to her children
one-half of the property she owned be
fore marriage, that would be perfectly
legal. The children would not have any
rights in the separate property of their
stepfather.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES-
PERSONAL MENTION.
.These items show something more than a popular
interest in wireless telegraphy and the eagerness of
inventors to improve upon the system. of Marconi.
They prove that the Marconi system is no longer an
experiment merely, but an accomplished invention of
use to the world and of such importance that capital
is ready to support almost any well devised enterprise
directed to its operation: It is well known that in
ventions do; not come singly," and there may soon be
as many kinds of wireless telegraphy as there are
sewing machines or harvesters, f In fact, now that the
primary difficulty in the- way of sending messages
without wires has been overcome there is no reason
why improvements should not be both rapid and nu
merous. In the course, of the development of the art
the Marconi system will be superse'ded, but nothing
can take away from the gifted Italian the credit
belongs to the first inventor of that method of tele
graphing. He has laid the- foundation. Others can
do.no more tljan build upon it.
Another dispatch in the same paper and of the
same date announces the completion of a plant for
wireless telegraphy at -Siasconset, Mass. The New
York Times about the same time reports arrange
ments madeÂ» for an "improved wireless telegraphy"
between Boston and Danvers, where an electrical and
telegraph school has bought a farm of sufficient. area
for running electric cars in connection with a- course
of instruction for motormen. It is stated that a relay
system for intercepting a wireless message and send
ing it forward with more^ force has been invented by
the principal of the school, and he expects to prove
its efficiency in the operation of the line he has just
established. The claims made for the invention sound
extravagant, for it is said: "The inventor professes
to be able to send a message" fifty miles over land and
then pass it through the relay apparatus, which he can
manipulate *at the starting point. He predicts that
such stations can be established at intervals of about
fifty miles, repeating and forwarding the message al
most indefinitely." ' â¢
RECENTLY the New York Sun announced that
there has been established near Port Jefferson,
Long Island, a large plant designed to operate
a wireless telegraph system devised by Nikola Tesla.
For the purposes of the plant 200 acres of ground have
been purchased. ThÂ« main building will be 100 feet
square and will be occupied by an electric dynamo
with a capacity of 350- horsepower. It is the expec
tation of the managers of the plant that from that
point it will be possible to carry on wireless teleg
raphy over a wide region of country extending from
Philadelphia to Boston.

. The Vice President has rather increased public in
terest in him as a character unique among our pub
lic men.
Now he has gone back there as the guest of the
State to deliver the address at the celebration of the
quarter centennial of Colorado's admission. He has
revisited Victor and other scenes of the riotous
demonstrations against him last fall, and his clear
grit and good humor have won the people over. It
may not be charged that he does this for political
effect. It is simply the act of a strong and very self
centered man, to show that he is not capable of fear
and has confidence in his countrymen's sense of fair
play. Whether Colorado know it or not, he has ren
dered that State a great service by his return. He
has permitted her to purge her reputation and remove
the stain placed upon her by the mobs of last year.
Had he not returned to the scenes of those excesses
Colorado must have rested under the stigma placed
by her own disorderly people.
At one place a fellow bawled: "How about em
balmed beef?" Instantly the plucky colonel an

fused to hasten his departure from towns when he was
threatened with, violence, and would not leave a hall
by a back door nor take a side street to his train
in the interest of his personal safety. The public au
thorities connived at the attacks made upon him, but
he stayed his schedule time in Colorado, and the first
outing he took after his election was in Colorado to
hunt mountain lions.
ROOSEVELT may excite antagonism, as posi
" tive men do, but he is no quitter. His progress
through Colorado during the campaign was
through an almost continuous mob. He was at times
restrained with difficulty from accepting the challenge
and going into a hand to hand fight with his torment
ors. He refused to quit speaking when interrupted
and gave back as good as the mob sent
â¢ ROOSEVELT'S GRIT.
If all stories are true that were told at the time the
various "punitive expeditions" sent out by Walder
see were in effect as brutal and as cruel as the
slaughter on the banks of the Amur, but the slaugh
tering done during the expeditions was carried out
over a wide region of country and extended over a
considerable period of time, and consequently there
was no signal dramatic horror to rouse public at
tention throughout the civilized world and stagger
humanity. Therefore, while Gribski dies a suicide,
Count Waldersee is received with honor by an Em
peror who cordially indorses aH he did, and, indeed
accepts the credit of having done it himself. It is th'e
fortune of v/ar.
Russian news is very carefully censored and it is
not certain what causes led Gribski to commit sui
cide, but it is believed the Czar held him responsible
for the cruel slaughtering of a number of peaceable
Chinese who were living on the Russian side of the
Amur at the time of the Boxer outbreaks. The
story goes that when the Chinese attacked the city
of Blagovestchensk Gribski asked instructions as to
v,hat he should do with the Chinese in the town, and
was ordered to "fling the Chinese across the river."
The general was absent when the dispatch came, but
his subordinate interpreted it literally and the entire
Chinese population was driven into the river. It will
be remembered that the massacre gave rise to a great
deal of comment at the time. Gribski was recalled to
St. Petersburg to make an explanation, and now the
story comes of his death by his own hand.
The two commanders seem to have had an equal
chance to advance their fortunes. Each served an
autocratic master capable of richly rewarding him,
and each went to the front resolved to do his mas
ter's bidding. The duty that awaited them was that
of reducing China to such a condition of weakness
that her Government would consent to pay any in
demnity asked by her foes and grant any other terms
they chose. Gribski failed. His management was
such that he was made the scapegoat for everything
that went wrong with the Russian forces, while Wal
dersee was so successful that he has felt at liberty to
say that everything he did was done in accord with the
will of the Kaiser," or, to put if in his own words: "If
I succeeded in some measure in China, it must be at
tributed solely to the fact that I had Emperor
Wilhelm behind me and was able to act in' accord
ance with his instructions."
BY an interesting coincidence of dates we re
ceive information of the honors conferred
upon Count Waldersee upon his arrival at
Berlin immediately following the announcement that
the General Gribski who commanded the Russian
forces on the Chinese frontier at the time of the Boxer
uprising has committed suicide. Gribski returned to
St. Petersburg to make a report even as Waldersee
returned to Berlin, but while the one found favor with
his sovereign the other met such a greeting as led
him to put an end to his life. .

NOTED PRELATE DUE IN NEW YORK TO-MORROW "WHO BEARS
GREETING FROM ENGLAND TO THE TRIENNIAL CONVENTION
OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH TO BE HELD HERE IN OCTOBER.
The Pan-American Congress has been called mainly
for the purpose of devising means of settling disputes
among the various states of this hemisphere by arbi
tration. Should it succeed in doing so it will fill a
long-felt want. . At the present time our Government
is gathering quite a fleet 'around the isthmus and
may soon have occasion to make use of it. A short
time ago a dispatch was received at Washington from,
our Consul General at Panama to the effect that the
Liberals had stopped a passenger-train at Matachin,
and as the United States is bound by treaty to keep
traffic by that route open to the world, the Govern
ment will have to interfere should such disturbances
of transportation become frequent or dangerous.
Altogether our Spanish brothers in the great pan-
American family are decidedly troublesome, and. if
they can devise a means of putting a stop to their
wars we will be quite willing to help them enforce it.
From the figures given the contending forces ap
pear to be large, and yet a war that has been drag
ging along for two years can hardly have been
prosecuted with much vigor. A recent dispatch an
nounced a battle in which 900 men were killed on the
Government side, but such battles are rare. As a
rule the only information that comes from the dis
turbed country is that of menace to property. The
passengers who arrived at New York a few days ago
on the steamer Altai reported that there is a des
perate condition of affairs in the interior of the coun
try. As a result of the revolt and the uncertainty of
the 1 future business is at a standstill and gold is said
to be at a premium of 3000 per cent. As if it did not
have trouble enough with its own people, the Colom
bian Government now charges Venezuela with giv
ing aid to the rebels and threatens war against that
country.
The trouble is the outcome of the seemingly inter
minable conflicts tHat go on in those countries be
tween the men who" are" in office and those who are
out. Diaz Guerrajflthe representative in New York
of the Colombian revolutionists, is, reported to have
said recently: ,'The revolution has lasted since
1899, and there have been killed or, wounded during
that time about 40,000 men. Only as recently as May
there was fought-at PalosNegros a bloody battle that
continued for seventeen days. At the end of that pe
riod the revolutionists had to retreat for want of am
munition, and the Government soldiers were too ex
hausted to follow them. At present the regulars
(Government troops) number some 20,000, and the
Liberals (revolutionists) outnumber them." .
FROM, the disturbed , condition . of affairs in
Venezuela and Colombia it appears that our
Government may have to interfere to protect the
interests of foreigners, or else give way and permit
Europe to do the work. The latter alternative is of
course not to be thought of, . and consequently our
Government will doubtless be forced "to prepare to
act vigorously at any /point in the vicinity of .the
Isthmus of Panama where disturbances are likely to
be injurious to property' and to foreign trade.. .

ments, who comes as the personal repre
sentative of his Grace the Archbishop of

cob is regarded as one of the ablest pre
lates of the British "church and Is a
preacher of acknowledged power. As
Bishop of a population largely Industrial,
his Influence Is very great. To his efforts
the final settlement of a desolating strike
among the coal men* of his diocese on a
basis satisfactory to both parties in con
troversy was due. The Bishop will be
heard during the convention at several
churches and at the great meeting in the
Mechanics' Pavilion. The Lord Bishop
left England on Saturday last and will
reach New York, It Is expected; on Thurs
day of this week.
The Right Rev. Edward Jacob, Lord
Bishop of Newcastle-on-Tyne, is the son
of the Venerable Philip Jacob, Arch
deacon . of Winchester, and was born in
1S44. He was educated at Winchester and
is a graduate of Oxford, where he ob
tained a, first class in classics and an A.
B. degree, taking a third class in the final
classical school in 1867. In 1870 the degree
,of M. A. was conferred, and by diploma
D. D. in 1895. In 1896 the honorary degree
of D. D. was conferred by Durham Uni
versity. He was ordained deacon In 1868
and priest In 1869. From 1868 to 1869 ho
was curate of Taynlow, in the diocese of
Oxford; curate of Witney to 1871,,curate
of Bermondsey In 1872 and domestic chap
lain of Bishop Mllman of Calcutta from
1872 to 1876; commissary of the Bishop of
Calcutta from 1876 to 1888, and until 1896
examining chaplain to the famous Harold
Browne, Lord Bishop of Winchester. He
was honorary canon of Winchester for
twenty years, honorary chaplain to the
Queen from 1884 to 1896, chaplain in or
dinary to the Queen from 1890 to 1895,
chaplain to Bishop Davidson of Winches
ter in 1895-96, rural dean of Landport and
chaplain to her Majesty's prison in King
ston, Portsmouth, from 1892 to 1896; proctor
in convocation for Hampshire and the
Isle of Wight from 1895 to 1896, honorable
secretary to the Board of Missions for
the province of Canterbury from 1888 to
189C. He was consecrated Lord Bishop of
Newcastle in succession to Dr. Wilber
force, translated to Chlchester In York
Minster on January 25, 1896. The title of
the see is Newcastle and the jurisdiction
extends over the city and county of New
castle, the county of Northumberland, the
It now remains to be seen what sort of a ticket he
will nominate. He may deem it advisable to place
at least some good men -on the ticket to give it
strength. WHen the ticket is made up it will then be
time to determine how far self-respecting men can
support it. That, however, is a question for the fu
tttre. The one thing for Republicans to do this morn
ing is to bow to Kelly and take their medicine. He
is the doctor.
For this condition cf affairs no one is to blame ex
cept the good citizens who were too busily engaged
in private affairs to attend to their public duties even
when such duty entailed no further energy than that
of going to the polls and casting a ballot.- Those
who stayed away from the polls virtually voted for
Kelly. The situation was made clearly known to them
for weeks before the election took place. They were
warned over and over again that Kelly would carry
to the polls nearly the whole predatory vote of the
city, for the following of the Democratic bosses was
placed at his disposal and he made use of it. There
was but one way to beat him and that was for all
good citizens to vote against him. They did not
do it. .
Having thus planned the campaign and fought the
battle, Kelly is entitled to the spoils. It will be use
less for his allies to come in and attempt to take away
from him the honors or the profits. It is his victory
and not theirs. It will be his convention and not
theirs. It is to him the Republicans of San Fran
cisco must look for a party ticket.
It is but fair to admit that Kelly is the author as
well as the beneficiary of the victory. He planned the
whole campaign from start to finish, and personally
conducted it. It was he who had the primary elec
tion law amended so that he could bring in the State
Central Committee to uphold him in case any attempt
was made to deprive him of control of the party ma
chine in this city. The event has shown how wisely
he planned at. that time, and he deserves credit for
his foresight even when he is condemned for the
unscrupulous means by which his policy was carried
out.
As the head of the victorious ticket in the Twenty
eighth District Kelly will have the public*honors of
the triumph. His name will be the" first called in the
convention. He will have affront seat. He will be
conspicuous in every step in the, proceedings. He is /
not to be the power behind the throne but the power
on the throne, and will be visible to all as the master
of the convention.
BY the primary elections yesterday it is made,
evident that Martin Kelly is the boss of the
voting strength of the Republican party in this
city.- That thousands of Republicans who deem.them
selves good citizens are opposed to him counts for
nothing. Most of such citizens were so indifferent
to politics and to public affairs that they did not take
the trouble to vote. The supporters of Kelly didÂ«
vote, and so it, happens that Kelly shows up this
morning as "the real thing."
The Advocate admits that abolition of the canteen
will not reduce, to any considerable extent, the drink

in that hope, but with grave doubts.

The city contended that the property
was wholly within streets laid out and

BITTER. LEGAL FIGHT
THE Great Council of the State of
California. Improved Order of Red
Men, convened yesterday morning
In ' the Post-street wigwam, and
the council fire was kindled by
order of Great Sachem F. O. Brandon
Thera weie present a large number of the
past grand sachems, all the great chiefs
and representatives from all the tribes in
the reservation of California.
Mayor Phelan during the forenoon ap
peared before the Great Council and de
livered an address of welcome to the vis
iting Red Men, and for this he was ten
dered a rising vcte of thanks.
The reports of the great chiefs were pre
sented and referred to the committee on
distribution.
The great sachem in his great sun re
port says:
I am happy to be able to report that ten new
tribes and six councils have been added to our
ranks, all of which are in a prosperous condi
tion, and that the tendency of growth of our
order seems to have nothing- ephemeral about
it, but is onward and upward throughout the
State, the Increase In this reservation durini?
the past Great Sun having reached 956. the
greatest In our history. This result has not
been attained without earnest and persistent
work, and in this connection it is only simple
Justice to say that the greatest credit is due
to the great chief of records. Brother Porter
L. Bliss, who has been indefatigable in his
efforts to place this order upon the pedestal
it is entitled to occupy. No other cares are
permitted to distract his attention from what
he conceives to be his duty to Redmanship, and
our Great Council is to be congratulated upon
having secured the services of a chief who is
courteous and accommodating to the last de
gree, and who seems to devote his whole time,
thought and energies to the work of this or
der.
The fund placed at the disposal of the execu
tive board for the extension of the order has
not lain idly buried in the ground to be brought
forth at the end of the term and returned to
those who gave it. I take pleasure in saying
that the gTeater portion of it has been used in
furtherance of the purpose for which it was
designed, and has contributed in no small de
gree to the happy results achieved in the In
crease of our membership. And if that fund
had been larger it would have been still more
.freely used, for. while much preparatory work
has been done, there are still many important
1 districts in this grrcat State which scarcely
know the name of our order, but where strons
and well-directed efforts, needing the use of
wampum, would establish and place It upon a
firm foundation.
Becommendations of Great Sachem.
. During the past great sun there were
but three appeals. The great sachem
made seventy-s^ven official visitations and
granted many dispensations. He said that
The Great Council of the Degree of
Pocahontas was also in session yesterday
in the wigwam. The representatives of
the several councils; together with the
appointed great chiefs, the following
elected ones: Jennie Weisel. Great Poca
hontas; Mina Rew, Great Wenonah; Kate
Wilson. Great Mlnnehaha; Annie E. Gill,
Great Prophetess; E. J. Brazile, Great
Degree of Pocahontas.
During the noon recess yesterday the
great chiefs and representatives were the
guests of the Degree of Pocahontas, who
served them an excellent lunch.
The election for great chiefs will take
place to-day. The only contests will be
for great junior sagamore, in which
Thomas Roche of Bald Eagle Tribe and
C. S. Davis of Mona Tribe will take part
and for representatives to the Great
Council of the United States, three in
number. The candidates are F. D. Bran
don, Henry A. Chase, J. G. Smith and
Colonel A. A. Andrews.
There are so many teams that want to
exemplify the work of the adoption de
gree in the competition for the trophy of
fered by the Great Council that it was
discovered the work could not be accom
plished in one night, bo it was decided
that four teams shall work to-night in
Union Square Hall and the others to-mor
row night.
A great deal of time was taken up in
relation to securing a new home for the
order, but at adjournment no conclusion
had been reached.
A communication signed by Henry Lun
stedt, grand secretary of the Native Sons,
extending on behalf of the Native Sons of
the Golden West the grasp of true fra
ternal fellowship, greeting the Red Men,
congratulating them on the noble work in
which they are engaged and wishing them
all prosperity, was read.
From the report of Great Chief of
Records Bliss it appears that the number
of tribes is sixty-three, ten having been
instituted during the year and one having
surrendered its charter. The total number
of Red Men in the reservation is 5930.
There were adopted 15S7 during the great
sun. The loss by suspensions, deaths and
withdrawals was 779, leaving a net gain of
Â£06. The amount paid for relief was $24,
357 80, and for funerals $4779. The assets
of the Great Council and tribes i3 $146,

"William of Germany and
Attendance.
Edward of Britain in
The royal party left the nark at 12:25
p. m. In the first carriage was Queen
Alexandra on the risht and the Empress
on the left. The second carriage contained
King Edward on the right and Emperor
William on the left. Numerous court car
riages bnre away the invited guests and
dignitaries to their homes or to the rail
road, and the crowd rapidly dispersed.
After the body had been lowered Into
the vault the choir from the Berlin
Cathedral sang "Christ Is the Resurrec
tion," by Grell. A prayer followed, and
then the choir sang. "Be Faithful Unto
Death." In the meanwhile the Emperor
stood beside the tomb in a most solemn
manner. There was no weeping, but
King Edward frequently used his hand
kerchief, for beads of perspiration were
coursing his brow. After the brief cere
mony the royal party withdrew, and the
invited guests, military men, diplomats
ard Ftatesmen filed in for the last view
of The coffin.
The coffin was carried into the mauso

The procession occupied twenty minutes
in passing. All the bells of Potsdam con

After the military came the highest
clerical dignitaries of Berlin. Including Dr.
Dryander, the court preacher, and Bish
op Aszman, the highest Catholic military
chaplain, in a resplendent purple robe.
Over the head of the coffin were
the Imperial colors, on which was a
crown of state of massive gold and
heavily jeweled. Also on the colors
was a wreath deposited there by
Emperor William, at Cronberg, and two
other wreaths. Behind the coffin marchea
the Emperor, with head erect and display-
Ing the greatest self-possession and dig

Emperor William and King Edward wore

At the head of the procession rode Ma

carefully attended to prevent their being
contaminated by the poison. The motive
of the poisoner cannot be surmised, un
less the fact that some of the neighbor-?
of Lentholtz have long complained of the
scent arising from the farm may be taken
as a reason for the act.

SAN JOSE, Aug. 13.â Bert Hale, a clerk
employed~by Hart & Roberts, dry goods
men, for the past three years, disappeared
on Saturday night, "and his friends fear
he has committed suicide. He leaves a
wife and two small children, and Mrs.
Hale is unable to account for her hus
band's acts. He owed some bills around
town, and this may account for his dis
appearance. Hale is 26 years of age, and
was married in Alameda three years ago.
He is stout, weighing about 1S5 pounds;
wore a blue sack suit and black derby
hat, and had a small black mustache. A
brother and his father-in-law, Richard
Eustice of Alameda, are here looking for
him. .

These hardy men would, It is con

number of Chinese and Japanese, who
have come to be unpopular workmen. It
is proposed to bring two shiploads of the
Icelanders and their personal property
and to arrange easy ! methods of settle
ment, so that they will be content to make
their homes on the coast. They would be
vastly better settlers than the Orientals,
who send their money all back to their
families In China and Japan. The canners
are thoroughly dissatisfied with their ex

A series of petty troubles and minor ac
cidents of various kinds have attended
the building of the celebrated hacienda.
MONTEREY, Aug. 13.â That there is a
"hoodoo" on the Tevls hacienda near this
city is believed more firmly than ever by
the superstitious of this community since
yesterday afternoon, and now the predic
tion ir. that the house will never be com
pletely finished. Foreman Whitby and
George Cooper, a skilled artisan, were on
top of a high scaffolding adjusting a part
of the carved wood ceiling decoration in
the billiard room. The scaffolding sudden
ly gave way and both men fell to the
floor, sustaining severe injuries. Whitby
struck on his side on top of a post and
was badly hurt internally, but it is be
lieved he will recover. Cooper was not so
badly Injured and will probably be able to
resume work in a few days.

The Ringling Bros, are justly proud cf
this item in their list of circus values. In
fact, the menagerie part of the Ringling
Bros, show is rated above all others for
its remarkably rare collection of wild ani
mals. Only recently a giraffe was added.
This is the only one known to be In cap
tivity and cost a small fortune. Giraffes
are fast disappearing, and to find one of
late years seemed impossible. The giraffe
was captured In February .last and has
been journeying to this country by slow
stages since. .The zoological collection of
the circus was further benefited last week
by the arrival of two baby li^r.s and a
baby yak. There are over 500 horses with
the Ringling circus, more than 200 of
which" are '.performing* animals of fine
breeding and high-strung natures. The
wonderful way in which . eighty-one of
these thoroughbreds respond to the com
mand of John O'Brien, without 1 whip, bit
or bridle, stay or strap of any kind, is one
of the sensational acts in a list of one
hundred or more in the circus programme.
The trained elephants, numbering thirty
in all, with the Ringling Bros.' circus, to
be here week after next, are a remarkable
feature. These great, cumbersome ani
mals are put through a course of tricks
truly amazing. They play musical instru
ments, sing coarpely, dance heavily, stand
on their heads,- form pyramids, smartly
waltz and actually go through the humor
ous Incidents of a farcical skit.

This very pleasant function was man
aged by a committee of one from each
tribe and council, of which P. S. Seymour
was president, Emilio Lastreto vice pres
ident, J. Hutaft secretary and Henry A.
Chase treasurer.
The grand ball In the Mechanics' Pa
vilion in the evening Was a most success
ful affair. More than 6500 ladies and gen
tlemen filled the large building and the
many colored toilets of the ladies as they
moved on the ballroom floor to the sounds
of delightful music made a pretty picture
most pleasing to the eye. Before the
dance programmes were given out there
was a promenade concert by Stross' or
chestra. This was followed by the grand
march, led by Floor Director John AV.
Kelly and his sister Mise May E. Kelly.
In this there were about 500 couples, who
moved in graceful figures to the several
points of the hall. At the termination of
the march there was the first number on
the dance programme, lancers, followed
by thirteen other numbers and four ex
tras. v "

To-day there will be the election for
great chiefs. Mlna Rew will be advanced
to great Pocahontas. but for the other
elective offices, except for great keeper of
records and great keeper of wampum,
there will probably be contests.
On Thursday night teams from Poca
hontas, Alfarata. Yosemlte and Ramona
councils will exemplify the adoption de
gree in a contest for a $75 silk flag.
During the afternoon the council was
visited by Porter L. Bliss, Thomas Roche
and V. F. Northrup, a committee from
the Red Men, who each gave a short talk
for the good of the order.
The great keeper of records in her re
port showed that the membership of the
order is 1735, that there was a gain of 319
members, ' that there are 'twenty-four
councils in the order and that two sur
rendered their charters. These and other
reports were referred.

Mr. Carr can do nothing further in the
case until his appeal has been decided. It
will probably come up for hearing when
the Circuit Court of Appeals convenes
here in September. In the meantime
Judge Bellinger's order is In force and the
destruction of Carr's fences Is likely to
be proceeded with. Mr. Hall will prob
ably hear from "Washington to-morrow
morning, and if his requests are granted
United States Marshal Houser will send
men to Southern Oregon to-morrow even
ing to commence the demolition of the
fence.
That the President is hereby authorized to
take such measures pa shall be necessary to
remove and destroy any unlawful inclosure of
any of said lands and to employ civil or mili
.tary force as may be necessary for that pur
pose.
. The act mentioned is "An act to pre
vent unlawful occupation of public
lands." Section 5 reads as follows:
Circuit Court haa ordered Marshal to destroy
unlawful fence of Jesse D. Carr Land and
Livestock Company in summary manner.
Fence is about 40 miles long. "Will you
authorize Marshal by wire to employ men to
help destroy it? Also get an order from Presi
dent directing Marshal of California to destroy
portion" of fence in that State, under section 5,
act of February 25, 1S85.
J. H. HALL, United States Attorney.
Mr. Hall then prepared and forwarded
the following dispatch to the Attorney
General at Washington:
iand Livestock Company, has been duly served
with copies of the injunction by service upon
William Dalton, foreman of the defendant, at
the place where the said fence is being main
tained, upon the 31st day of July. 1901, and a
copy of the same was duly served upon Jesse
D. Carr. president of defendant corporation,
on the 7th day of August, 1901, and it further
appearing to the satisfaction of the court that
eaid defendant has wholly failed, neglected
and refused to remove said fence, or any part
thereof, it la therefore ordered and directed
that the Marshal of the United States proceed
at once to remove and destroy said inclosure
and fence, excent where the same shall be
upon private property, and that the costs and
expenses thereof be taxed against defendant
as a part of the costs of this suit.
CHARLES B. BELLINGER, Judge.
And it apnearingr to the satisfaction of the
court that defendant, the Jesse D. Carr Land
Now, at this time, .comes the plaintiff by
John H. Hall, United States Attorney, who
prosecutes in its behalf, and moves the court
for an order directing the Marshal of the
United States to destroy the - inclosure de-;
scribed in plant! fTs bill of complaint herein,
which has heretofore by this court been de
creed to be unlawful.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 13.â JessÂ© D.
Carr's fence, which Incloses 80,000 acres
of Government land In Southern Oregon
and Northern California, must come
down. Judge Gilbert, in the United States
Circuit Court, to-day approved the $10,000
bond of the Jesse D. Carr Land and Live
stock Company, on appeal from . Judge
Bellinger's decision to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals, but refused to
grant a stay of proceedings. The bond
was signed by John P. Irish of San Fran
cisco and James D. Carr, and at the foot
was a statement signed by Judge Morrow
to the effect that he considered the sure
ties sufficient. The bond was sent here
for the approval of Judge Gilbert and for
him to decide whether a stay of proceed
ings should be granted under it or not.
The matter came up before Judge Gilbert
this morning. No argument was made, as
none was necessary. Judge Hunt ap
proved the bond and indorsed on it, "No
stay of proceedings in this case is al
lowed." Mr. Hall at once took the fol
lowing order in Judge Bellinger's court: .

Chicago opened easier on disappointing ca
bles, but subsequently recovered. There were
scattering country orders to buy, which ag
gregated a large quantity, and made the mar
ket firm, though the crowd was bearish and
fought any advance. ' The weakness in Corn
affected the market. Clearances from the sea
board, again exceeded 1.500,000 bushels. Ex
porters were very bearish and worked hard to
minimize the effect of the Â¦ large clearances by
wiring that Europe was overbought. The move
ment of new Wheat in the Northwest was in
creasing,' and the elevator concerns, both In
the Northwest and ; Southwest, were selling.
The Corn crowd were free" sellers of Wheat.

NEW YORK. Aug. 13.â Business to-day was
on a small scale, but there was a wider distri
bution of the dealings. Strength was shown
by many Important stocks, but the general
movement continued Irregular. The opening
was higher on a resumption of yesterday's
strength and the good tone of the London mar
ket. The fortnightly settlement abroad was
arranged satisfactorily and arbitrage houses
bought more liberally here than for some time.
First prices were not leng maintained, as trad
ers realized, but when a demand arose for the
Eastern trunk lines and bituminous coal road
etocks the entire market rallied sharply. Sugar
was about the only notable exception to the
day's strength, the bears lowering it 5 points
at one time and selling steadily when it ral
lied. There was little news of importance bear
ing en either the crop conditions or the steel
strike and the influence was less marked.
Frequent relapses In prices were made causing
the Pacific stocks to sag temporarily under yes
ttrday's close. Prices rallied easier, and as
there were large purchases of St. Paul and
the Eastern stocks shorts covered more gen
erally- in the market. The improvement in the
trunk lines and solt coal stocks was partly due
to the benefits' expected to accrue from the
recent formation of a bituminous coal com
bination. New York Central made the largest
rise of 3V t . but Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsyl
vania, Chesapeake and Ohio and Norfolk and
Western averaged 2 points better. St. Paul
was taken in good amounts and advanced 3%
on reports that there might be an increased
dividend declared next month. Short buying
was considered to be responsible for the im
proved tone of the market, but the waning in
fluence of the crop conditions and the steel
strike was also considered. Western and Pa
cific stocks followed pretty closely In the wake
cf St. Paul on its advance and the grain-car
rying roads were helped by the heaviness of
the grain market. Little interest was mani
fested generally In the United States Steel
Etocks and they moved quite generally inde
pendent of other stocks. An early risÂ» of %
and % respectively in the common and pre
ferred were followed by a gradual decline and
they ended only % and hi higher. The large
payments made by the sub-treasury on account
of army and navy credits and some receipts
of gold at Pacific Coast points caused a loss
of about $1,500,000 by the banks to the sub
treasury up to yesterday to be turned into a
sain of about as much. The stock market
closed strong and at about the best for the
principal features.
The bond market was quiet and firm. Total
sales, par value, $360,000.
United States bends were all unchanged on
the last call.

are .steady. Â¦ .
Apricots are almost gone, and Figs are hardly
seen, except in a scattering way. Nectarines
continue dull.
Lemons are easy at the decline already noted
and the market Is better supplied than for some
time. Oranges and Limes are firmly held.
There is no change worthy of note in Ber
ries.
While there is plenty cf fruit lying around,
there is a scarcity of real sound peaches. Pears
and Plums,, and these fruits rule steady In
consequence. Overripe fruit has to go for what
it will bring. There are plenty of melons of
all kinds here, more than can be worked off
on the wharf.

COAST AND BAY SECTIONS
Extremely hot weather during the week has
caused a rapid ripening of fruit and there has
been eoneidprable difficulty in promptly hand
ling it. It is reported that Tokay grapes in
the hill vinf.yp.rds around Vacaville have been
sericusiy injured by heat. In ' most places
grapes aro yielding better crops than anticipat
ed, and in many cases much' larger than last
wason'f. The damage by the late frosts In
the vicinity of Sacramento was much less than
estimated. Pcr-ehes on thÂ» uplands are of ex
cellent flavor and the yield is heavier than
expected. Wh*at harvest is progressing and
is nearly completed in some sections. Sugar
beet fcarvff t has commenced in the large fields
around Tehama. Kop picking begins to-day in

wt-eks s,to. The grrape? now coming to market
ere mostly of excellent flavor and pood size.

the werk. and there has been some difficulty
in promptly handling the fruit. The labor
trcuHes in San Frarioipco have also seriously
interfc-r^d with shipments of fresh fruit and
other produce.
Grain harvest and thrashing are still in pro
gTers and will continue for several weeks in
Eome sections. The yield of wheat and barley
is exefeciirg expectations in many places, and
the qual.ty is superior. Sugar beet harvest
has commenced in the Sacrnmento Valley and
hop jiickins will begin this week. It is re
ported that there will be heavy crops of beets
and bow. Beans and corn are progressing
favorably, with prospects of socd crops. Al

crops during the v-e*k. Along the coast the
weather has been clear and warm through the
day and cool at night, with frequent heavy
fogs and in 'lie interior extremely high tem

and on covering by shorts the price advanced
to 73%c, but declined again to 73@73%c on sell
ing by local longs. The close was . a shade
lower at 73%@73%c.
The conflicting reports as to the relative
amount of damage done the corn crop by the
recent drought were reflected somewhat in the
attitude taken by local bulls, who were in
clined to get rid of 'their holdings. Trade,
however, was very small. September closed
nrm and 34c lower at 59%@59%c.
Oats opened lower in sympathy with other
grains. Trading was within a narrow range.
Prices . were firm all - day. September closed
with a rain of %c at 36%c.

that way never failed to stop for refresh

of one of the former proprietors, who had
the gout so badly that he could not walk
and used to lie all day long on a couch in
the corner of the dining-room and growl
about the pain he suffered: 'He had a
Shetland pony, trained to lie down on the
floor beside him. When he felt thirsty, he
climbed upon -the pony's back, rode over
to the punch bowl, drank freely of the
beverage that always could be found
there and then returned to his corner and
rolled upon his couch, while the patient
pony would lie down beside him until his

OAKLAND, Aug. 13.-City Attorney
Johnson this afternoon decided that the
appointment of Joseph Courtney, brother
of the Councilman, as street sprinkling in
spector was illegal. ; ' â¢
The City Attorney finds that for several
reasons the appointment is faulty. First,
the Coupcil created the. position by reso
lution Instead of by ordinance, which
alone makes the position illegal.- In the
second place, the appointment was made
by the Council, though the charter gives
the Board of Public "Works control of the
streets of the city. Under .this provision
of the charter it would be necessary to
make the position so that it could be filled
by the Board of Public : Works.

Mrs. Scott is an elderly woman, with
but little experience in this world's af
fairs. She says McCoy induced her to go
into a great scheme for making money.
He was to take up Government land at
Bakersfield and a fortune was to be won
by reselling the grants at a great advance
over the cost of procuring the land. The
proposition teemed fair and Mrs. Scott
was delighted when the first transaction
came to a head a few days ago and a pur
chaser was found for a piece of the land.
So pleased was the woman that she did
not hesitate a moment to cash a check
signed by "J. A. Thompson," the ostensi
ole purchaser. But when the Thompson
check was sent to the bank and it had
gone through the trade channels the al
leged forgery was quickly uncovered.
Mrs. Scott waited In vain for a settle
ment with her partner. The adjustment
was not forthcoming. After waiting what
she termed a reasonable length of time
Mrs. Scott decided upon a prosecution
Yesterday she located McCoy at Sacra
mento, and the aggrieved woman has
tened there. She swore to a warrant
charging McCoy with forgery. He was
arrested, his bail being set at $1000.
Oakland Office. San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 13.
J. B. McCoy, a real estate operator, is
under arrest, accused of forgery by Mrs.
J. Scott, residing at 1231 Alice street, who
claims Ehe is only one of numerous vic
tims of the alleged forger.
Mrs. Scott declares she has lost $40
through her acquaintance with McCoy,
who Induced her to honor a check for that
amount which proved to be worthless.
She also accuses McCoy of having de
frauded J. Cox,* a Broadway photog
rapher; J. Champion, the owner of the
residence where Mrs. Scott dwells, and
also v-*ith having forged the name of the
United States Land Agent at Bakersfleld
to a receipt for $22. Champion put up $SO
on a checK which subsequently proved to
be valueless.
The City Council was determined to dic
tate who should be the attorney, but it
split over the "who." Some wanted W.
W. Foote and others wanted William R.
Davis, and between the two City Attorney
Johnson announced that he wanted the
election of his assistant If one was to be
allowed him. The original proposition
was to set aside "between $6000 and $8000
for the appeal.
The matter was settled, as far as the
Council was concerned, last night, when
ft abandoned all effort to name either W.
W. Fcote or William R. Davis, and it
passed the whole matter up to City Attor
ney Johnson, leaving him to get out of it
as best he can and take the responsibility
of success or failure. The result was the
ordinance that was passed last night,
which passes everything up to City At
torney Johnson j most, effectually.
It Is understood that George M.- Shaw
will be selected- to -assist Mr. Johnson,
though the City Attorney declines to dis
cuss the matter until the ordinance be
comes a law.
After several months of delay the City
Council has made some provision for the
appeal of the suit brought by the Contra
Costa Water Company against the city of
Oakland over water rates, in which Judge
Hart delivered his remarkable decision
that has resulted in the doubling of the
water rates of the city. It- is true that
the arrangements for the appeal are not
such as would be deeme'd the most liberal,
but they are regarded as the best that can
.be secured from the solid seven in the.
present municipal legislature.
The Council has passed to print an ordi
nance which creates the position of Dep
uty City Attorney, the duties of that offi
cial being to assist in the preparation of
the appeal in the water case. The salary
is fixed at $200 a month and appointment
is to be made by City Attorney Johnson.
The term of the deputy is to be during the
pleasure of the City Attorney.
This ordinance was the result of the at
titude of City Attorney Johnson. The
City Attorney and the City Council have
not been in that sweet accord and happy
harmony that should characterize
branches of the municipal government.
City Attorney Johnson openly announced
that if any one was to be retained to
carry on the water suit litigation he
would like to have Robert Y. Hayr,e. the
man who conducted the suit in the Supe
rior Court. But the City Council dis
missed Judge Hayne without benefit of
clergy, and then began a contest as to
who should assist Johnson.

Senior Class Officers.
The placing of '05 on the hills Is a chal
lenge to the sophomores, and shows that
the freshmen desire a more intimate ac
quaintance with members of the class
above them. ' \
During the rush troubles of last year a
committee of senior boys was placed in
charge of affairs and acted as a court of
arbitration and for the suppression of
class spirit. President Wheeler urged the
necessity of the one class ruling, but it
took six months for the peace plans to
achieve the desired results. Collegians
are now speculating whether the new
class - will require a term's tussling and
another volume of faculty edicts against
conflicts with upper class men to calm
the intrants, or whether they will slip
quietly on under the rule of perpetual
peace and. do nothing. The juniors, at
once the friends "and enemies of the fresh
menâthe protectors in case of strife and
the instigators to conflict in case of peace
â are still musing over their freshly paint
ed plugs and the prominence In college
life another year has brought them, and
are not alive to the fact that the campus
is covered with young hopefuls in need of
experience. When the freshmen are all
assembled Monday for registration the
juniors will undoubtedly remember.
BERKELEY, Aug. 13.â A crowd of spir
ited freshmen, not yet posted on univer
sity rules and regulations, placed the class
number on the hills back of the college
buildings last night. This morning '05
stood out on the brown hills in fifty-foot
letters of paper and lime, much to the ad
miration of the Intrants. The sophomores,
still remembering the experiences of their
bumptious days of a year ago, have ig
nored the figures thus far, but pent up
class patriotism has a limit of elasticity,
and the numbers are not expected to re
main long on the hills.

MacRae arrested Brown and two com

late Sunday night, September 23, 1900. on
Buena Vista avenue for fast driving. The
officer overhauled the young men by
boarding a passing street car after they
had disregarded his command to stop.
After he had stopped their rig he told
Brown to get out, and handcuffed him.
MacRae then had Brown get back Into
the buggy and was getting In himself to
drive it to police headquarters when the
horse was started, throwing him between
the wheels. He ordered Brown, who held
the reins, to stop, threatening to shoot
if his command were not heeded. Tho
horse kept on and the policeman fired
three shots at his escaping prisoners. He
then boarded another car and arrived at
the Webster-street bridge before they did.
He found that Brown was badly wounded
by his fire. At the Receiving Hospital the
surgeons gave it as their opinion that thei
injury was a mortal one, and the wounded
man died two days later. MacRae was
arrested and charged with manslaughter.
Considerable difficulty was experienced
in finding Jurors who thought a policeman
justified in shooting a man attempting to
escape after arrest for a misdemeanor

Special, Dispatch to The Call.
, ?, r V c Â£ arIes von Radesky is firm in the
belief that \\ anner'e death was brought
about by natural causes, and he scouts
the idea that strangulation or brutal
treatment had any part in it. He savs
that half the statements attributed to
him in the effort to support a story with
out foundation axe false.
"You know," said the doctor, "that
after death any wound or bruise that
might have been received In life is very
greatly magnified. It usually looks ten
times worse than It really Is. So It was
in the case of Wanner. The blackened
?-ye looked bad, but it was not enough to
kill him. The other discolorations were
not bruises, but blood marks. As for the
fractured fkull and the broken jaw that
is all buncombe. The man died from nat
ural causes."
The body is resting in a receiving vault
and no investigation is likely.
"Thf ro was really only one mark of vio
lence." said Gallagher, "and that was the
blackened left eye. I understand that that
was received before he left here. The oth
er discolorations were caused by coagu
lated blood. Wanner was a large and
full-blooded man. and unless a body such
as his is taken charge of immediately
after death coapulation Invariably results.
If the head is below the level of the rest
of the body the blood all goes to the head.
In this case the body was not treated un
til three days after death.
"The marks on the neck and chin which
some of Wanner? friends thought were
bruises were simply the marks made by
the instrument we use to keep the jaw's
together until rigor mortis sets in The
statement that there Is evidence of a
broken jaw is absolutely without founda
tion, as I know positively there was noth
ing of the kind. I am satisfied that Wan
ner's death was due to natural causes."
"I saw the body." said George Odell
Gallagher's assistant, "and I saw the dis
colorations. but I am positive that they
were caused by coagulated blood. The
idea that they were bruises resulting
from rough handling- never suggested it
self to me. All the statements attributed
to me regarding these so-called bruises
are untrue."
Wanner was a partner in the Tivoli sa
loon, on Park street, and drank excessive
ly before he lost his mind, which made
his ca.se the more complicated. Superin
tendent Smith said that Wanner had to
be strapped down all the time, as he was
f-o hard to handle. The body arrived in
Alameda Sunday tnornini?. tv.o days after
death. It was taken ctnrm of and pre
pared for burial by the Gallagher Under
taking Ccmpanv. Hugh Gallagher, who
had charge of the funeral preparations,
says that there? were no evidences of
brutal treatment on the body.
The statement of Superintendent Smith
of the Ukiah asylum regarding Wanner's
death is that he died from acute mania.
. ALAMEDA, Aug. IS.â The story that
Louis "Wanner met a violent death at the
hands of attendants at the Ukiah State
Insane Aeylum is the offspring of an idle
statement. Wanner's death was due to a
natural cause, the superintending physi
cian of the asylum ascribing it to "ma
r.ia." His skull was not fractured, his
jaw was not broken and there are no
marks of violence on his body except a
discoloration of the left eye caused by his
own frantic efforts at the Receiving Hos
pital. What Wanner's friends took for
evidences of brutal treatment are nothing
more than the discolorations on the body
caused by coagulated blood.
George Foster, a friend of the deceased,
innocently stalled the story of foul play
when he made the -casual statement to a
group of friends that Wanner's body was
badJy bruised and suggested that he
might have been killed at the asylum.
The news spread, and many of Wanner's
friends came lo view the remains. They
were deceived l.y the facial discolorations
and went away with the impression that
the man had been murdered.
Wanner was violent when he was taken
from Alarneda to the Oakland Receiving
Hospital for examination for insanity two
weeks ago. It took two men to hold him
down until the hospital was reached. At
the hospital it was necessary to strap him
to a cot, so violent were his actions. When
the time came to take him to Ukiah he
became stil! more frantic and attacked
Warden Paee. The men had a desperate
fight, out of which the Warden came vic
torious after a terrific struggle. It was
then that Wanner received the blackened
eye which marks him even in death.

She did not intend to take up ivory por
traiture: as a profession, but merely to
perfect herself In a refined and delightful
accomplishment. Her success, however,
has been eo phenomenal -that sho now
finds her diversion a very profitable
source of income, as she has risen to the

work is eagerly sought for, and she has

' r ADVISORY BOARD ORGANIZED.
At a meeting of shareholders at this office
Saturday, August 10, an Advisory Board of the
Montezuma Mining Company was organized for
California and other shareholders of the south-
west. The beard consists of nine members,
whose names will be later announced by cir-
cular. Thirty-five shareholders were present at
the meeting and stock to the number of about
400.CC0 shares was represented. Mr. J. S. C.
Thompson was elected delegate to the annual
stockholders' meeting in Tacbma, September
A DIVIDEND DECLARED.
The Montezuma Mining Company has an-
nounced Its first quarterly dividend, payable
October 31, 1001, of $1 per thousand shares of
paid up stock; that being equivalent to 5 per
cent | per annum on the average cost of shares
for the past six months. This dividend comes
from a single sale of coal and agrees with the
policy to which tlfe company is committed.
Other and larger dividends may be confidently
expected from the same source as the produc-
ing capacity of the coal-mines Is Increased.
Present price of shares Is ISc cash or 21c on
Installments. These are strictly . ground-floor
prices and the expenditure of a little money
will put one In possession of a considerable
block of what is confessedly , the best mining
stock on this or any .ether market at the price!
He who waits for the low-priced stock of a
new company will lose the three years that the
Montezuma has gained from its success in
placing of shares. Write to* us for full infor-
mation concerning this : big, strong, safe min-
ing company of Washington.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
.OF THE PACIFIC COAST
The resolutions adopted declare that thÂ©
Japanese were examined in a harsh man
ner after the white cabin passengers had
been passed without any examination at
all, and the removal of Dr. Cofer is asked
for. It was declared by the mass meeting
that the manner of examination was un
necessary, unusual and in violation of
common decency and an insult to woman
kind at large, regardless of race or color.
The Japanese declared that it was an un
just and unreasonable discrimination be
tween the Caucasian and Oriental passen
gers and a direct and personal insult to
the Japanese Government In the person of
its Vice Consul to Honolulu.
The passengers . over whose treatment
the complaints were made are Vice Con
sul S. Okabe and his wife, who arrived
here on July 25 on the steamship America
Maru. When the vessel arrived a case of
sickness, suspected to be plague, was re
ported on board, and the vessel was kept
in quarantine until the nature of the sick
ness was investigated. It was found that
the man was not suffering from any dan
gerous disease and the vessel was re
leased from Quarantine. Okabe anji his
wife, who were cabin passengers, were
subjected to a physical examination under
what it is -claimed were deeply humiliat
ing circumstances, while the other cabin
passengers were passed without such ex
aminations,'and there was great indigna
tion among Japanese here when the mat
ter was reported ashore.
HONOLULU. H. T., Aug. 6.â A large
mass meeting of. Japanese residents of.
Honolulu was held last Friday evening to
protest against the actions of Dr. L. E..
Cofer, United States quarantine officer
for this port, in subjecting -a Japanese
consular officer and his wife to physical
examination when they arrived here on
the 25th of July. The local Japanese Con
sul, MIkl Salto, took 'part in the meeting
and feeling ran high, ending in the adop
tion of very severe resolutions, copies of
which will be sent to the Japanese Minis
ter at Washington and to President Mc-
Klnley and other officials at the national
capital. i
Charges Are Made That He
Insulted a Vice Con-'
sul's Wife.

Thomas' Corbett, a laborer, was arrested
yesterday on a charge of mayhem. Cor
bett boarded at the lodging-house of Mrs.
Phillipine Aymard, 403 Broadway, and
was forced to leave because he could not
pay $45 due for board and" lodging. He
went there yesterday under the influence
of liquor, and when Mrs. Aymard told
him to learve it Is claimed he grabbed hold
of her and bit her on the shoulder and
finger. In trying to escape Corbett fell
downstairs and was wounded on the fore

Accused of Mayhem.
At the approach of the officers the boys
left their plunder and started to escape.
One of them succeeded, but the other,
whose name is John Welch, was over
taken at the corner of Pine and Kearny
streets after a spirited chase. The boy
who escaped is known to the police andi
he will undoubtedly be placed under ar
rest to-day.
Herbold at the time of the hold-up waa
on his way home. He lost nothing in the
affray, but the boys, in attempting to
extract his watch from his pocket, broke
the chain.
The pair of juvenile footpads met Her
bold in a saloon at the corner of East and
Mission streets, where he had been im
bibing. The boys followed him until he
reached a secluded spot at the corner of
Commercial and . Sansome streets and
there attacked him. Before rifling him
of his property they beat Herbold severe
ly about the head and cut a deep gash
over his right eye. They did not succeed
in rendering him unconscious, and when
they attempted to remove his watch and
chain he cried out for help. His cries at
tracted the attention of Special Officers
Gillen and Whelan and Policeman Du
Guire, who immediately ran to his as
sistance.
Two newsboys, .neither ' of whom Is
more than 16 years of age, attempted a
daring robbery last night about 10 o'clock
at the corner of Commercial and San
some streets. Only the arrival of two
special officers and a policeman saved
their victim, William Herbold, a cook on
the transport Mea-ie, from the loss of his
watch and money.
She allowed him to go through the
house and he climbed out a side window
and ran down Howard street. When the
crime was committed the only person on
the street was E. . Mojoi of 261 Ninth
street, who was some distance away. The
young man was also seen by C. A. Hunt
of 417 Larkin street, who passed him as
he ran down Ninth street.
Young Friedlander notified Officers Mills
and Ross, who were stationed at a near
by polling place, and they gave chase, but
the robber made good his escape. The
officers. searched the houses in the neigh
borhood and finally learned that the thief
had entered the 'rear of 1129 Howard
street, occupied by Mrs. Hutchins. Mrs.
Hutchlns informed the officers that a
young man had dashed through the back
door of her home and cried out: "I'm a
scab. A mob is after me. Help me get
away or they will kill me."

A conference of the teachers of the
eighth grades in the public schools was
held yesterday afternoon in the assembly
room of the Board of Education. Direc
tors Kincaid, Mark and Denman were
present to hear suggestions, from the
te&chers regarding the conduct of their
claf-&es. Some teachers expressed the opin
ion that the studies as laid down In the
course were a little too comprehensive and
It required much hard work to finish them
within the prescribed term. Teachers who
have two grades in their classes pleaded
for the study of only one poem instead of
two, as difficulty was encountered in com
pleting the study since the "no home
study law!' has been put in force. . The
board decided to take the suggestions un
der consideration, and it is quite likely
that some plan will be adopted whereby
the course of study will be modified in
some unimportant particulars.

weeks ago in company with S; A. Popst,
an Otterbein student." Popst acquired cold
feet in Southwest Missouri and severed
his connection with Winter Zero, who ac
complished the journey alone. The trip
was uneventful, the most exciting ' inci
dent occurring on the plains, when W. Z.
paced a bull for a half-mile spurt. The
distance ridden, as recorded on his cy
clcmeter, was 32S8 miles and never a punc

rode from Dayton to New York' last sum

During the two years In which Dr. Hut
slnpiller officiated as minister of the
church he now leaves a debt of $10,500 was
paid off, leaving the church free of debt.
An increase of $1000 a. year in his salary,
with the almost positive assurance of a
permanent pastorate in his new field was
one of the principal reasons why he left
San Francisco.
While the members of his congregation
are loth to lose Dr. Hutsinpiller, they
realize that he is going to a church where
his ministerial labors will be as fully ap
preciated as they were in this city. A
farewell reception will be arranged for the
departing clergyman, and he will be ac
companied by the good wishes of his flock
in his newly chosen field.
Rev. Dr. Hutslnpiller was formerly pas
tor of a. church in Athens, Ohio, and he
filled many pulpits In that State. He left
a pastorate in Erie, Pa., to accept the call
to me Central Methodist Episcopal
Church * in this city. The minister Is a
graduate of the Ohio Wesleyan, Univer
sity and is about 48 years of age. â¢ Before
coming here he had been traveling in
Europe for a period of twelve' months. On
his return to this country he received
many calls from Eastern churches, but
believing there fw a pood field on. this
coast he accepted the call from the Cen
tral M. E. Church. At one time he was
pastor- of a Congregational church in
London.
Only two -months ago Dr. Hutsinpiller
was offered the presidency of the Ohio
State University of Athens, Ohio, at a.
munificent salary, but he declined the of
fer, preferring to remain with his flock
in this city. The minister will proceed to
the Methodist Conference, which is to be
held in Chatfield. Minn., on September
25. This* conference will be presided over
by the T^ght Rev. Bishop Cranston, the
resident Bishop of the Northwest, and Dr.
Hutsinpiller will undoubtedly be assigned
to the church which has made an urgent
call for his services.
Rev. Dr. S. D. Hutsinpiller, pastor of
the Central Methodist Church, located on
Mission street, notified Presiding Elder
W. W. Case of the California diocese
yesterday that he had decided to resign
the pastorate of the church. - Dr. Hutsin

musical one, fully appreciated the excel

Mr. Steindorff, the leader, comes in a
good third for the credit due for last
night's performance, the orchestra being
admirably handled and held up to Its
work throughout. Xlcolini's few small
intermezzi were gratefully heard, and Plo
Facci was, as always, rather amusing In
his part of Casslo.
For Montanari I think It kinder to re
serve judgment until she is heard in a '
part that suits her. She Is evidently un
puited to the role of Desdemona both by
temperament and voice. She was very
nervous also â the nervousness due to an
ill-fitting role, and also, I think, to a not
sufficiently intimate acquaintance with Its
difficulties. Montanari's voice is pure,
sweet and flexible, with a sometimes too
evident tremolo and a tendency to uncer
tain intonation â again a common result of
nervousness. Judgment is therefore re
served.
Politini was her usual quiet, thoroughly
satisfactory self as Emilia. The house
was a model one from the box office
standpoint and jealous of respect for the
opera to its last gracious note.

TWO ACRES OF STONE
ABE BEADY FOB, BLASTING
charge of Thirty Tons of High
Grade Explosives.
Top of Arch Bock A-waits the Dis-
There will be a mighty explosion at
noon to-morrow. Two acres of the sur
face of Arch Rock in the bay will be sent
flying skyward by the propulsive energy
of thirty tons of high grade powder, all
of which will go off at once. Contractor
Axman. who has the task of removing
the rocks frcra the harbor of San Fran
cisco, says that this will be the largest
explosion that has ever taken place in
the United States, with one exception.
When the greatest of all the rocks in
Hell Gate, in New York harbor, was
blasted away several years ago the ex
plosives were little more In quantity. But
when the top of Arch Rock goes shooting
into space the explosive employed will be
nearly four times greater than that used
â¢when Shag Rock was blasted. The dan
ger line for vessels during the explosion
has been placed at a distance of one mile
from Arch Rock, and measures will be
taken to keep all craft safe. A party will
go out with the contractor to get a view
cf the final operations. Crowds will un
doubtedly gather vpon the north. shore
of the bay to witness the spectacle that
will be afforded. . .
To say that Castellano held his own
even measured against Salassa is to say
much, but barring the defections of his
voice Castellano's Otello did not suffer by
comparison with his great confrere's Iago.
It was a spirited, dignified and highly In
tellectual performance, and the role suits
Castellano vocally better than anything
else he has been heard in here, with its
demand for a high-pitched, brilliant vocal
organ. The ensemble work between the
two artists was a model of certainty, and
nothing so good in its way has been heard
here for many moons. It is also pleasing
to record that the audience, a delightfully
"Otello" grows on one with very hear
ing. It is the most modern of modern.
Italian music; greater, incomparably,
than the Puccini, Leoncavallo or Mas
cagnl school from every standpoint. It Is
eminently melodious, yet never descends
to the tricky tunefulness of some of Verdi's
earlier operas, their cheap and violent
effects. It Is dose akin in spirit to Wag
ner in its breadth of design, clearness of
construction and masterly handling of
material, and is a musical marvel as the
work of a man already past the allotted
three score years and ten at its writing.
As to the performance, it is "place aux
hommes" with "Otello" as given at th<?
Tivoli this week. Salassa excels himself
as Iago. He Is In admirable voice, ana
with his vibrant and eminently sympa
thetic song, marvelous facial expression
and graceful genius of gesture gives a su
perbly satisfactory interpretation of
Shakespeare's supple villain. With the
iest of the audience I can but say
"Bravo! Bravissima!" Salassa!
THE Tivoli management Is to be
congratulated on the very clever
fashion in which it has succeeded
in so far arranging its programme
as to insure increasing interest
with each performance. This is the third
week of the season, "Otello," given last
night, the sixth opera, and unquestionably
the best programme yet performed.
It is expected that Sheriff Veale will al
low Winters to remain in the City Prison
at the Hall of Justice until the balance
of the loot Is recovered from the waters
of the bay. He will then be taken to Mar
tinez and prosecuted. ;
"I won't tell you a thing about it," he
said, "and any statements that I have
talked about the matter are lies. But you
can bet that I won't go to prison and I
won't have to work for a long time.- I
know what I am talking about."
Winters is willing to talk about the
robbery and poses as a great criminal,
but he will not tell just how much he was
offered by ex-Chief of Police Lees to dis
close where he had placed his booty.
Winters dented yesterday that he had
told any one that he had been promised
$5000 and a short sentence in order to con
fess as to where the gold was hidden.
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa. County
and Constable Moiles of Crockett 'were in
the city yesterday, but they did not visit
the Hall of Justice. Chief of Detectives
Seymour had sent word to the Sheriff that
he desired him to come after the robber,
but Veale did not put in an appearance
at the City Prison. Winters was told that
he wculd be taken to Contra Costa County
yesterday and he became very excited.
His conduct leads to the belief that he is
feigning insanity In order to escape his
well-deserved punishment.
The detectives were of opinion yester
day thnt the four missing bars of gold
had been placed by Winters in another
hiding place, and Detective 'Gibson came
over to the city from Crockett in order to
have a talk with the gold thief. Winters
assured the officer that he haul dumped
all the loot from the Selby vault at the
spot in the bay he had pointed out. De
tective Gibson wanted to take Winters
back to Crockett, but after talking with
the prisoner the detective hurried to
catch a train and return to the scene of
the robbery.
One of the bars recovered yesterday
bore a number not published in the orig
inal list of the stolen bullion. Un to yes
terday thÂ«s amount of gold 'bullion recov
ered figured ?2o3,000, and the Selbys state
that there are. still four bars to be fished
for, the value of the same being $65,000.
Detective Tom Gibson and Pinkerton
Agent Sayers spent yesterday morning in
diving at the spot where the gold was
dumped. They worked three hours. The
incoming tide put an end to their opera
tions.
Winters spent yesterday in the prison
at the Hall of Justice in this city, and
he kept up the game of "playing crazy"
whenever he was approached by news
paper representatives, j Â¦
It is believed by the detectives that
Winters did not place all the gold bars in
one spot. The sleuths are of the opinion
that Winters has hidden some of them
on land and that he hopes to secure them
inthe future, at the same time account
ing for the non-recovery of all the gold
from the bay by the excuse that spmeof
the bullion slipped down through the mud
into deep water.
Two more bricks, valued at $24,492, were
recovered yesterday.
Chief Bookkeeper Arthur Beam of the
Selby works stated last evening that a
revision of the books showed that Winters
had secured $320,000 worth of bullion.
A bar recovered yesterday from the
â¢waters of the bay near Vallejo Junction
bore a number not found in the printed
reward list.
John Winters, the robber, who looted
the vault of the Selby Smelting Works at
Vallejo Junction last Tuesday morning,
secured as his booty gold bullion to the
value of $320,000, or nearly $50,000 more
than the sum originally given. An error
was made in compiling the list of stolen
bars.
PEKING MAKES
PORT AT LAST
"It must not be supposed that the com
mission will not be able to accurately de
termine what the actual value of the land
is. An advisory committee has been ap
pointed, which includes as expert judges
of timber lands as there are in the State.
Among these are Captain Charles Nelson,
Robert Dollar, General N. P. Chtpman,
Hervey Lindley and W. W. Van Arsdale.
There is also expert knowledge of timber
lands on the part of two members of the
commission. It will not do for the lum
bermen to point out that a certain tree
will produce so many shakes, etc., and so
estimate its value. There are questions
concerning what it will cost to get it to
market and what the net profit will be.
"It is true that the commission, as The
Call has stated, was invited to go into the
Big Basin whiie the Sempervirens Club
was there as the guest of the club. It
might as well be understood that the
Commissioners do not wish to go there
under such conditions. We do not wish
to be under any obligations to any one.
Moreover, we will not deal with any one
except the owners of the land, and not
then until we have from them a cleancut
proposition, accompanied , by the neces
sary maps and descriptions. The Semper
virens Club has the land to the extent of
about 2500 acres under a bond. This bond
will expire September 1.
Commission's Position Stated.
One of the Commissioners said to a re
porter for The Call yesterday: "There is
no doubt, as The Call has set forth, that
the very lands that are held for the State
under the supposition that we will buy
them at $100 per acre have been sold in
the past eighteen months for very much
less. money. Indeed, we have found that
tracts in the very cream â¢ of the forest,
belonging, to Timothy Hopkins, have in
that period changed hands for $40 and $50
per acre. I personally might be willing to
give the Big Basin Lumber- Company an
advance on the actual value of the lands
for timber, considering that they are eli
gible for a park. Perhaps I- would even
allow them an advance of 25 per cent- in
some instances, but a profit Â¦ of 110 per
cent is altogether out of reason and is ex
tortionate.
the Big Basin country at $100 per
acre have been routed. The Call told first
of this plan, ani has since been vigorously
abused for that act by those who stood to
win if the deal could be carried through.
This journal desired to have , the State
pay only a fair price for the lands in
question. Its fearless presentation of facts
has borne good fruit. The Redwood Park
Commission will not submit to imposi
tion, nor will it take up any proposition'
without due and careful consideration.- A
park will be acquired. If the lumbermen
insist upon an extortionate price the right
of eminent domain will be used - in con
demnation proceedings,- and nothing but
the actual value will' be given in return
for the forest reservation which is sought
by the State. Good citizens will hail this
victory of The Call for the > public from
one end of the State to the other. -

when values are put on that footing.
Possible Hotel Scheme.
"The Commissioners were Informed
some time ago that two tracts would be
offered to the State. One of these.em
braced 700 acres and the other 1200 acres.
Between the two tracts was a. distance of
about two miles. Of course, a hotel could
be placed by private Individuals In that
intervening space, and the work of the
Commissioners in improving the park
would be -largely in the nature of making
grounds for a hotel if we took up with
any such idea. At our first meeting we
therefore voted that all the lands must be
contiguous. Since then a tract has been
suggested which includes the â¢ 1200-acre
tract but not the 700-acre tract, the latter
including the choicest timber. Around
the 1200-acre tract are other lands which
the commission will be offered to make
up a tract of i500 acres, so I am credibly
Informed. But those lands are not as
good as those which Timothy Hopkins
sold a few months ago for $40 and $50 per
acre. In the tract of 2500 acres, so made
up, is a jog which includes about 300
acres. The explanation given by Mr.
Middleton concerning the exclusion of
this jog from the tract is that there is
litigation concerning the ownership. That
explanation is not good, for the State
can condemn the land just the same and
settle with the owners when the courts
determine where the title Is vested.
Cannot Deal With, dub.
"Possibly that ' jog might be used by
private individuals for a hotel site if the
State bought the tract that surrounded it
on three sides. We will not deal with the
Sempervirens Club. I think that the club
people are honest lovers of the forest and
are all right, but possibly they are being
used. When a- club appears to be urging
the establishment of a park that gives
the enterprise a look of public spirit.- If
the Same, thing was done by private own
ers the motive of selfishness would be
more easily j inferred. Every one under
stands that when there is State money
to expend there is an expectation of get
ting a big price. There will be no realiza
tion of anything of the sort in this in
stance. Every tract of forty acres will
have the timber upon it estimated by ex
perts. The real value will not be difficult
to reach."
This authoritative statement of one of
the Commissioners in behalf: of the board
will awaken much interest. In the Big
Basin great preparations were being: made
for the coming of the Governor and the
commission. . Buildings were erected on
the east fork of Waddell Creek, and also
tents, the entire outfit being called "the
Governor's camp." This, it is reported,
with the other expenses Involved In put
ting up tanks to water the road leading
into the Big Basin, the clearing up of
good trails from the Sempervirens' camp
to the Governor's camp, etc., have cost
H. L. Middleton and the other men asso
ciated with him in the Big Basin Lumber
Company about $3000. The company could
well afford this outlay if the devised plan
could be carried through. The names of
the incorporators of the Big Basin Lum
ber Company have been already published
in connection with the original expose in
The Call. The largest individual owner
of timber lands in the Big Basin is Tim
othy Hopkins. He is also largely Inter
ested in the Big Basin Lumber Company.
