POLICE UNRAVEL
DENVER MYSTERY
OF STOLEN CHILD
Q.Emile Rivierre, Who Caused Grave
P^llp â¢ l-vl DC LJ\X\L lur Iâ *1 Vlll^ VV lie?;
G. Emfle Rivlerre, whose escapades have struck the chords of sensation In two
large cities, has shifted the scene of his actions to San Francisco. In New York
he caused a grave to be opened for his wife, though she va3 alive and well; in
Denver he realized handsomely, on his ruse of representing her as dead, and de
serted her, kidnaping her child and disappearing. Last night he was located by
the police in this city, whither he had brought the baby.
The. finding of the kidnaped child adds the most romantic chapter to thn
strange story. It had been thrust into the keeping of a woman on Fell street
by the father, who surrounded his every act with mystery. Half dressed and
ragged the child was introduced into a family of strangers and Its identity was
only yesterday discovered. Meanwhile Its father remains in the city and declares
his intention of taking . the child away with him to-day.
Last Saturday morning Mrs. A. Lage, a widow, who resides with her six
children at 108^ Fell street, was startled when a man with a baby in his arms
"entered hurriedly and deposited his burden on a bed in one of the front rooms.
The man was a total stranger to the woman and his appearance alarmed har.
As soon as she recovered her power of speech she Inquired the meaning of his
queer action and was told that she was 'to keep the child. The youngster was a
boy scarcely three years of age. It was attired as If it had been dressed hur
riedly. Even its little stockings were not mates. The woman and her children
Etood breathless, looking at the stranger, but he offered no further explanation,
and after once more making the request that she give the child a home hÂ«
passed out in the same hurried manner that he had come.
RECEIVES ANOTHER VISIT FROM THE STRANGER.
.The next day Mrs. Lage received another visit from the stranger. This tlma
he brought the baby's trunk, a hand grip and a bicycle. He talked more freely
than on the first occasion and said that he was a bicycle rider and that his
name was Wall. He paid for one week's care for the child and asked that It bÂ«
kept until he could find another home for it. The woman still retained her
suspicions, but she said j nothing and. awaited developments. â¢ The father of the
child, as he had announced himself, gave the positive order that the little one
was not to be taken from the premises on any pretense whatever until ha
should take it away himself, and offered to provide amply for Its welfare.
In conversation with Mrs. Lage subsequently the man intimated that some
thing might happen to' him, and again the child's future came under discus
sion. He. gave an address on Filbert street and said that if ever he disappeared
or was found dead a letter directed to her would be found on the bureau In
his room. Inside the^ envelope would be found policies for insurance- on hi3 life
and documents which would reveal the baby's history. There would also be a
will in which all of his possessions would be left to herself and the llttlo one.
Mrs. Lage marveled constantly at the strange course ot' events that had in
terrupted the smooth flow of life in her little household. She was not by any
means .satisfied with the details of the case that had been given her, and the
conflicting stories told by the man concerning himself â¢ convinced her that ho
was concealing his true identity. At one time he said he was a bicycle rider,
again that he was a stock broker and still again that he was an insurance
agent
DENVER DISPATCH GIVES CLEW TO MYSTERY.
The story of the strange little guest at the Lage fireside became the subject
of discussion among the neighbors, j They pronounced it a case of kidnaping
from the first and watched the newspapers for a solution of the mystery. At
length the light dawned. A dispatch from Denver, published Tuesday morning
In The Call, told of a man who, after setting the tongues of 'gossip wagging In
two cities, had ended his adventures in that city by deserting his wife and steal
ing their child: ' The stated age of the missing youngster misled them to some ex
tent, as it was givenjnjthe^dls5atch as 12 years~_Nevertheless. It gave the poUc*
a clew, on whIcBTlo"work.* Â¦
The present custodian of the child was brought to police headquarters last
night and there she told her story. The trunks left at her home by the stranger
were opened and letters contained in- them fully established his identity and
cleared up the Fell-street mystery. The child is the one wanted by its. mother
In Denver, and its father is G. Emlle Rivitrre.
The history of Rivierre's checkered career reads like a novel. He was an in
surance agent in New York City and married into an excellent family several
years ago. Mrs. Rivierre's aunt is Mrs. Patterson of 33 Monroe place, ; New
York, who Is reputed to be worth 1700,000. The union for a tune was happy, and
three years ago a son was born. Then the wife's health began to fall, and about
Christmas time of last year the couple moved to I>enver.
GRAVE READY IN" NEW YORK FOR THE I#TVINO.
Rlvierre confided this much of his past* history to Mrs. Lage. lie. said that
he had spent a large amount of money trying to restore his wife's health, and
failing to do so had determined to desert her. He had laid his plans carefully.
'About three weeks ago he wrote from Denver to the wealthy aunt that his wife
Â¦was rapidly sinking and that the end might be expected at any time. This was
to pave the way for his final play. A few days later a telegraphic message con
veying the news of the â¢woman's " death â¢was sent to New York.
With the announcement of his wife's demise Rlvierre made a request for
funds with which to ship the body to New York.' He asked for- $150. He also re
quested that a grave be prepared in Greenwood Cemetery. The money was for
waided without a, demur and the sexton of the cemetery broke the sod for the
grave. The New York relatives donned garbs of mourning and sat down to
await the arrival of the body. .
A startling revelation was In store for the sorrowing ones. About the time
the body of Mrs. Rivlerre, was to arrive they received a telegram from that lady
herself, dated Denver, and saying that Rlvierre had deserted her and taken
their child with him! According to the details furnished from Denver, the hus
band took advantage of his wife's temporary absence* from their home and
gathering together a few trinkets belonging to the little one, made a hasty de
parture. The 5150 secured for his wife's burial was the fund with which the hus
band accomplished the desertion and the theft of the child from its mother.
HTVIEBBB PREPARES TO MOVE CHILD AGAIN.
Rivlerre Â¦ paid Mrs. Lage for one week's care of the child. The week ends
â¢ to-day. ' In conversation with her yesterday the father said he had found another
home for her charge and that her responsibility would end with the week. He
asked her to have the. baby prepared for traveling and said that hÂ© would call
for it in tha morning. Whether he shall take It or not is yet a question, as thÂ«
police will interfere if authority is received from Denver to do so. Rlvierre first
gave a house on Vallejo street as his place of residence, but when h$ told of his
foreboding that something might happen to him" he said that hÂ© was stopping
at 523 Kearny street It was there that Mrs. Lage was to find the letter on the
bureau. . .- . \\ } J,'A â¢â¢.-.*'-â¢: - v "'

desired to live up to the obligations Im
posed by that treaty, it could complete the
Panama canal by merely getting the con
sent of Colombia, which has offered it on
the most advantageous terms.
Hence the. interest which the British
Government is taking in the matter. For
tunately Great Britain has not refused to
abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. - On
the other hand she has indicated clearly,
as stated, that she merely desires -reit
erated in treaty form that neither Gov
ernment will occupy, colonize or assume
dominion over any part of Central Amer
ica. At the same time the British authori
ties understand the lever the United State's
holds in the Panama negotiations and it
may swing them into i'ne to authorizing:
Lord Pauncefote to sign a treaty which
the Senate will accept.
LONDON. April li-Negotiatlons on the
Hay-Pauncef ote abrogation .of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty are progressing, though
they have not yet passed the tentative
stage. It is said that they are being con
ducted on a Quid pro quo basis and that
no other method of abrogation would be
considered by the British Gvernment. .Tha
Foreign Office hopes that a settlement
satisfactory to both the United States and
Great Britain will be arrived' at 'before
Congress is reconvened?
If Great Britain were to refuse to pivw
her consent to the abrogation of the Clay
toc-Bulwer treaty and the United State3
This interest arises, principally on ac
count of the effect such action will have
upon the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the
negotiations now In progress between Sec
retary Hay and Lord Pauncefote. the
British Embassador. for Its abrogation.
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty Tefers "to any
means of communication by ship canal
which may be constructed between tlie
Atlantic and Pacific oceans by way of the
river San Juan de Nicaragua and either
or both lakes of Nicaragua or Managua
to any port or place on the Pacific Ocean."
It is therefore contended that the Panama
canal is not affected by the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty except as provided In article
VIII. which binds the two governments
to "extend their protection by treaty stip
ulations to any other practicable commu
nication, whether by canal or railway,

Americans in Bobber Band.
BERLIN. April 12.â According to a dis
patch from Peking, dated yesterday, to
the Kolnis hie Zeitung, a robber band of
four Americans an-1 four Chinese was
recently captured by a German outpost
at Tungklaofu, west of Tientsin.
It is asserted in German military cir
cles that the withdrawal of . superfluous
German, troops In China will be effected
at the end of May or early In June, unless
new complications arise.
In high official circles in Berlin the re
ports published In 'the American press to
the effect that the Washington Govern
ment Is opposing Germany's claim for Chi
nese indemnity are described as erroneous.
"The American Government knows per
fectly well." said an important official to
day, "that the claims filed by Germany
and Great Britain are much smaller than
those of some other powers. It Is also
understood that Dr. Steubel, director of
the Colonial Department of the German
Foreign Office, effected an agreement dur
ing his recent visit In London whereby
both governments will lump the claims of
their citizens, carefully examine them and
then apportion the total amount among
the claimants."

a similar letter was sent to the Viceroy

W., WASHINGTON, April 12.â Minister
Wu seems to be of the opinion that China
can pay $200,000,000 if she is given 100 years
In which to do so. Brigadier General Wil
son, who" was with General Chaffee in
rhina, believes that at the outside China
can raise $300,000,000. His estimate, how
ever, is far in excess of that of other
authorities, who believe that not more
than 5200,000,000 should be demanded in in
demnity.
Though Belgium has suffered compara
tively little damage in China. It was
learned to-day that she has submitted a
"modest" claim for 30,000,000 francs ($6,000,
000). Holland has also filed a heavy claim.
Russia's claim Is necessarily large. This
Government appreciates that there is Jus
tice In the Russian claim. Unlike other
nations, however, which propose to Insist
that their claims shall be oald in full,
Russia Is willing to adopt the view of the
IÂ»r.!ted States, that all claims be propor
tionately scaled in order that a lump sum
may be determined upon which China can
pay. 4

Information is thus far obtainable that
5300.000.000 in gold can be raised without
injuring China's resources. The examina
tion by the committee into the subject is
Thus far incomplete, and it will probably
subsequently learn that other Chinese re
sources for indemnities are available. The
discussion of politics has this week given
place to amusement, commencing with
the German races at the huntlpg park

Cabinet As near as can be learned mem
bers of the Cabinet with legal training are
of the opinion that these proceedings are
contrary to the rights of the Government.
The view expressed is that when neutral
ity proceedings are inaugurated In United
States courts they should be brought in
the name of the United States, an alleged
violation of neutrality being a quesrion
affecting nations, not individuals. The
mover of the proceedings In the New Or
leans case Is a man claiming to be a resi
dent of South Africa, who contends that
his Interests are placed in jeopardy.
Knox Will Investigate.
It is pointed out that if an individual
could go into the courts and secure re
straining orders on the ground that the
neutrality laws of the country were being
violated the commerce, of the country
might be serfously endangered. These
views of the New Orleans proceedings
were elicited during a brief suggestion
with reference to the statement that the
British Government had decided to use
no more American meat in its army.
No official Information exists concern
ing this report. Attorney General Knox
will make thorough investigation of the
New Orleans case. If it Is found that the
neutrality laws are such as to permit indi
viduals to bring proceedings in courts,
Congress may be asked to pass such
amendments as will leave these questions
wholly in the hands of the Government.
The Present submitted to the Cabinet
a very gratifying cable from Secretary
Hunt of Porto Rico expressing the satis

WASHINGTON, April. 12.â Remarkable
results have been attained with the latest

grounds. Rear Admiral O'Neill, chief of
ordnSice, \ was Informed to-day by Lieu
tenant Straus,' in charge, of 'the Â¦ proving
grounds, that the gun had' developed a
maximum velocity of 3330 feet a second
with less, than seventeen; tons pressure."
This velocity was given to a fifty-pound
projectile. . . .Â¦ ;
The great superiority of the new
weapon over the five-inch; 1 gun ori the
Kearsarge will be understood when it is
known that the maximum velocity at
tained with a fifty-pound projectile fired
by the latter is 2550 feet a second. With
the ' sixty-pound shell a velocity of 2990
feet a second has been' attained with the
latest model. The muzzle energy obtained
was 3724 foot tons. In the trial to-day
with the fifty-pound projectile a muzzle
energy of 3918 foot tons was obtained.

o'clock flames were rising from it, the
surrounding woodwork was smoldering
and on the point of Igniting. Careful not
to make a display of excitement, the sis
ter seized the basket and, with great dan
ger to her own person, carried it to the
door and threw it into the street. By the
lime she had returned the woodwork v.-as
in a blaze. Just at that moment one of
the older boys chanced to pass through
the hall, and with his assistance the prin
cipal brought a bucket of water and threw
it on the fire. Meanwhile the smoke had
found its way into the schoolrooms. Some
one cried "fire!" and a dozen or more
pupils made a rush for the hall, "but the
principal ordered them back, with the as

Existence of the Dread Dis
ease at the. Canaries
Is Reported.
United States Consul Tells of the In
difference With Which the Af-
flicted Persons Are Re
garded.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â The existence
Â¦ of about 200 lepers on the island of Tene
rlffe Canary Islands, has been officially
reported here by United States Consul
Berliner at Teneriffe. He says there are
three distinct classes of leprosy on Tene
riXTe Island, namely, lepra arabum, lepra
elephantiasis and lepra tuberculosis. The
disease diverges into two main varieties.
the spotted and the nodular. The report
is based on personal Investigation and the
assistance of physicians, and says:
â¢ "Leprosy is somewhat endemic among
the people here on account of their eating
a good deal of fish, often putrid, and their
general uncleanllness. As being conta
gious, it is generally discredited here, but
in my opinion it is very infectious. In
former years Spain had established a
dblony at Grand Canary for lepers. They
were housed there, but had perfect liberty
to wander about, with the restriction that
they must sleep in the houses built for
them. In course of time this law became
a dead letter and gradually they spread
over the different islands.
"At Santa Cruz de Teneriffe, the capital,
â¢there are twenty-two lepers, fifteen of
â¢whom are men, and there also are some
children of these unfortunates. They are
*riven a place about fifteen minutes' walk
from the City Hall, where they live, which
Is called Barranco Santo. There are
also living at the same place about 200
people, nearly all beggars. You meet
them at all times of the day in town or
on the road, asking alms and exposing
their limbs. Many have no fingers or
toes and hobble along and a more pitiable
sight is hard to imagine."
Officially it is not recognized that lep
rosy exists on the islands. The provincial
government at Teneriffe has lately built
a large building- about two miles out of
town. {The building has two separate
wings, one for insane patients and the
other for lepers.
United States Consular Agent Swanson
on Grand Canary Island, in an accom
panying- report, says that leprosy there is
decidedly decreasing. There are fifty
patifnts in the leper hospital at Las.
Palmar. A few families infected with the
disease live in their own homes.

Reports From the Beaumont Field
Describe Enormous Supply From
the Seemingly Inexhausti
ble Gushers.
(special Dispatch to The .Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., April 12.â It Is the opin
ion of former Governor J. 8. Hogg, who
has spent considerable time 'at Beaumont
investigating the new oil field, that the
I discovery of oil in such bountiful quanti
ties there will revolutionize the fuel ques
tion of the whole world.. He says that
the maiufacturers of this country and of
Europe have not yet come to a sense of
realization of what the wonderful oil dis
covery and development irr the Beaumont
field means to them. Many of the ac
counts published throughout the country
of the flows of the wells "brought in" in
the Beaumont fleld have been looked upon
as gross exaggerations and fakes by the
reading public, while, as a matter of fact,
they have been true. The published state
ment that, a test of the flow of the Lucas
g-usher showed- that it had an output of
over 7000 barrels of oil per day of twenty
four hours was branded as untrue by per
sons who believed that a flow was
next to impossible. The statement was
true, and that first test has been repeated
several times since then and, has shown
no decrease in the world-beating flow. ]
The problem. that now confronts the* oil
producers of 'he new district is, what
shall they do with the oil.' It has been
correctly asserted by an official of the
Standard Oil Company that the present
demand for fuel oil in this country does
not amount to the output of one well in
the Beaumont district. But the Beau
mont producers say that the demand will
be Increased rapidly, and they are already
hard at work building up a market; Â¦-,â¢'*
Since their discovery of the flrst well,
known as the Lucas gusher, its owners.
Galey & Guffey, have shipped to distant
citie3 of the United States and to foreign
countries over 100,000 barrels of oil for ex
perimental purposes. These shipments
have been made with a view of creating
a market for the product, and went to
manufacturers In New York City, Phila
delphia and even to/Pittsburg. Over 30,000
barrels of the oil have been shipped to
manufacturers In Manchester, England,
and Liverpool, where the new fuel will be
given a oractical test and if found to be
all that is claimed for it large orders will
be forthcoming. The American Sugar Re
fining Company sent a special representa
tive to Beaumont to make a full and com
plete investigation Into the merits of the
oil as a fuel. This representative was so
well pleased with the saving that could
be obtained by the use of the oil over the
use of coal that he had 2500 barrels
shipped to Cuba, where it will be burned
in one of the largest refineries of the
trust located in that country. If this test
is successful the oil will be used in all the
refineries of the American Sugar Refinery
Company.

Country's Meats.
Â¦ LONDON, April 12.â The British war
Office, admitted to-dav that It is going to
try the experiment of supplying the army
with only home-grown beef. The experi
ment will extend six months from June
1. The director of contracts, a major,
said :
The new rule applies only to refrigerated beef
hitherto bought in the ope-n market In London.
It will not seriously affect the American trade,
as the total weekly supply for the army is only
Â£200,COt>, which Is barely 2 per cent of the
weekly imports of refrigerated beef into Eng
land, from the United States. Mr. Broderisk's
action was taken long before the New Orleans
proceedings. It is quite absurd to suppose that
any idea ot retaliation prompted the order,
which was due to a natural desire to help some
of the home industries. The difference in price
is very trifling and we are making that up by
giving Tommy Atkins frozen mutton two days
Instead of one day weekly. If the plan is satis
factory our supply problem will be greatly sim
plified, for we often have complaints and dis
agreements over refrigerated beef. Tou must
not suppose that we now use no home-grown
beef. Aldershot and some of our other camps
are almost entirely supplied with home-grown
beef. We have hitherto used refrigerated beef
as an addition to our rations, other than as an
integral part. "We have no prejudice against
Americans firms, and- we do not believe they
will miss this trade to any extent, even if it is
decided to continue the experiment.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â The informa
tion in the possession of the Departmen:
of Agriculture regarding the British Gov
ernment's decision to buy only home
bred beef for Its army supplies after Juno
1 next consists of the advices from three
large packing houses in Chicago and the
press report from London confirmatory of
those advices. No official confirmation has
been received. Among officials here the r e
is no disposition to accredit the reasons
that actuated the new roller to anv dis
satisfaction with American meats. No ob
jection has been offered to American beef
or beef products on the score of theÂ«r
quality or condition. The beef shipped
from this country to England for the use
of the British army, it is stated, always*
has been of the best quality and uniform
ly in prime condition when delivered arvl
distributed. No complaint has been made
by the British authorities.
Secretary Hay has cabled to Embassa
dor Choate an inquiry into the reason for
the order of the British Government, a
measure which excludes the American re
frigerated beef heretofore used. This ac
tion is taken at the instancy of the De
partment of Agriculture.
- Secretary Wilson said to-day that every
thing the administration can do in the
matter is being done.
"But -I cannot understand," he said,
"why. the British Government has taken
this step. They know that our grain-fed
beef is the kind that is shipped to them.
There must bio some* reason that is not ap
parent on the surface. "We sell them a
million dollars' worth of metis for every
million of their population. Suppose thay
have a quarter million in the field. It can
make, little difference to our producers
whether they take enough from the home
grown supply to feed the soldiers, for if
they do that they must import just that
much more to supply -the deficiency. The
British do not produce enough in Great
Britain to supply 'their home demand.
There must be some other reason."
Increase of Industrial Stagnation la
Evidenced by the Closing of
Factories and Dismissal
of Employes. .
BERLIN. April 12.â A recent article in
the Berlinger Tageblatt takes a gloomy
view of the industrial conditions in Ger
many, which it says are so bad that tha
efforts of the charitable are powerless to
cope with the situation. Reduced produc-
tion and the consequent dismissal of
working: people are so general as to no
longer attract notice.
It is safe to say that a quarter of tha
working people are either idle or insuffi
ciently employed. There is little prospect
ot an improvement. The situation* is
made more serious by the uncertainty of
Germany's commercial policy. The num
berless industries of the country do not
knew whether disastrous tariff wars will
not destroy the work of years. The un
certainty of Germany's vacillating trade
policy drives German capital and Intelli
gence to found large industrial undertak
ings abroad and hinders business rela
tions with foreign countries. are
so depressed in Silesia that even the iron
works there, which possess their own coal
mines and furnaces, cannot cover operat
ing expenses. The tin plate and tube man
utactures, plants for the manufacture oC
electric supplies and the textile industries
are in a similar, plight.
.lany factories have closed and In oth
ers the hours of labor have been reduced,
while work folk crowd to the prates of the
factories seeking 1 employment. The*
wealthy classes feel the pressure of this
cor.ditlon proportionately with the work
ing and professional classes.

IT IS IMPORTANT.
To Know What You Are Taking
"When Using 1 Catarrh Medicines.
Catarrh Is the short route to consump-
tion and the Importance of early and Judi-
cious treatment of catarrh, -whether locat-
ed in the head, throat or bronchial tubes,
cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The list of catarrh cures is as Ion* if
the moral law and the forms In which
they are administered, numerous and con-
fusing, from sprays. Inhalers, washes,
ointments, and salves to ppwders,- liquids
and tablets.
The tablet form is undoubtedly the most
convenient and most t-ffective. but with
nearlv all advertise-1 catarrh remedies it
is almost entirely a nutter of euesswerk
as to what you are taking Into vour sys-
tem, as the proprietors, while making: all
corts of claims as to what their medicines
will do, always keep it a close secret as to
what they are.
The success and popularity of the new
catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets. Is
largely because it not only cures catarrh
but because catarrh sufferers .who use
these tablets know what they are taking
Into their systems. Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets being composed of Eucalyptol, Hy-
drasttn. Guaicol and similar valuable and
antiseptic ingredients, and are pleasant to
the taste and being dissolved in the mouth
they take Immediate pffect upon the mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passages
and whole respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished In old chronic cases of
catarrh are little short of remarkable,
and thÂ« advantage of knowing what you
axe putting into your stomach is of para-
mount importance Â«rhen it is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine ' habit has
been frequently contracted- as the result
of using secret catarrh . remedies.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval from physicians, because
their antiseptic character renders them
perfectly safe for the general public to
use and their comDosItlon makes them a
common-sense cure Tor all . forms of ca-
tarrhal troubles.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for'
full sized packages.

MONTEREY, April 12.â George Q. Can
non, the noted Mormon apostle and prac
tical head of his church, died in this city
a few minutes before 2 o'clock this morn
ing, after having lived nearly two days
longer than either of his physicians be
lieved possible. He was conscious up to
almost the last moment and finally passed
away so quietly that even ; those beside
thp bed did not know the exact moment
of his death. His physicians say his vi
tality was marvelous, especially when his
age, 75 years, and previous wearing, ill
ness are considered. The real cause of
death was nervous prostration, but a
bronchial complication that . appeared
since his coming to Monterey is believed
to have hastened the end.
Five of the apostle's children, including
the three sons who were summoned here
by their father's illness, and his wife (a
daughter of the first Brigham Young)
were at his bedside when he breathed his
last. Dr. Frederick Cllft, his Salt Lake
physician, and his private secretary, Mr.
Wilkins, were also with him. The body
was taken to San Francisco on the 6:50
a. m. train, where It will be embalmed
and on Monday shipped Â¦ to Salt Lake.
There it will lie In state for a day, and
the funeral will take place on Wednesday.
Part of the family accompanied the body,
the others following on the noon train.
Apostle Cannon left a large estate, but
its exact amount is not known. 'All his
business affairs were settled during his
stay here and his property disposed of
among his large family. His son, who
made this statement, said that the dis
tribution was satisfactory to all - con
cerned. It is believed by some members
of his family that the strain of attending
to the business was one factor that aided
greatly in : hastening the: end. -Â¦ ,-
Gecrge Q. Cannon was born in â¢Liver
pool, England, on January , 11, 1827. , He
came to America in 1844 and was ordained
an elder of the Mormon church in 1845.
In 1846 he joined the main body of the
Mormons from Nauvoo, 111., on the < way
to Utah* and reached. Salt Lake in 1847.'
In 1S49 he went to California on mission
arv work, and in 1850 he Â¦went to the
Sandwich Islands and remained there for
four years. In 1855 he established the
Western Standard in San Francisco. In
I860 he was made a member of the quorum
of the Twelve Apostles. He was â¢ a dele

SAN DIEGO, April 12.â Sensational
charges against "; prominent persons j are
contained -in a complaint filed with the
County Clerk this morning by H.' S. Utley
and Patterson Sprlgg, attorneys for the
plaintiffs. The title cf the* case Is W. C.
and Rose Purdin vs. E. W. Loring, J. N.
Bunch, William Gilcher, Elizabeth Gil
cher and Michael Traver. The last named
three defendants are. residents of Los
Angeles, while the others are well-known
citizens of this city. The plaintiffs are
residents of Escondido.
The complaint charges that the defend
ants â¢ fraudulently represented that â¢ de
fendants Gllcher and his wife owned 500
acres of land In Emaruel County, Georgia,
and 500 acres of land In Johnson' County,
Kentucky, which .was given in exchange
for property owned by plaintiffs near Es
condido. i The Eastern property, it is
claimed by the plaintiffs, was misrepre
sented by the defendants both as to value
and location. It is. further alleged that
a note for $2000 signed by Charles A: Fred
erickson in favor of Michael Traver, and
which was made a part of the considera
tion in the trade, was valueless and was
so known to the defendants at the time of
making the trade.' On these allegations
plaintiffs pray >that the Superior. Court
cancel and annul the deed given by them
to E. W. Loring for their property, and
for all | other relief pertaining to equity
and for costs.* ... . : Â¦
The charges of fraud made by the com
plaint against J. N. Bunch, the real estate
agent who engineered the trade, are vig
orously denied .by. him,. though he ac
knowledges -that he is the Â¦ principal de
fendant. "He asserts that when Mr. : Pur
din entered into the exchange of the. prop
erty he did It with complete knowledge
of the value of the Georgia property, hav
ing had an abstract of it in -his possession
for months before the traBe was made.
It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the
Georgia property is pretty much a myth
and that other people have been swindled
by it. The property is said to be an im
mense overlapping land grant and the
other title is the one which holds good.

LOS ANGELES. April 12.-The strike
fever which had its inception among the
longshoremen at San Pedro and. next at
tacked the section employes of the Ter
minal Railway has been spreading. The
bottlers at Maier & Zobelein's big brew
ery struck this morning and .- for three
hours there was no one in the establish
ment to bottle and cork the company's
daily output. At the snd-of that time the
management acceded to thto demands of
its employes and work was recommenced.
Maier & Zobelein were not the only ones
affected by the action of the Bottlers'
Union.- Adloff & Hauoiwass, as bottlers
for the Welland Brewing Company of San
Francisco, and the Los Angeles Brewing
Company participated in the capitula
tion. â¢
Up to a month ago the ' bottlers were
paid $S to $10 a week. -The bottling: depart
ment is one of the mo3t important of the
industry and requires skliled men. There
was a meeting of the union and they sent
to the. brewing associations a demand for
a flat rate of $12 a week. The breweries
at once combined against the demand and
sent back a refusal of the terms suggest
ed. The union was as llrm as the brew
eries and turned the cuestion over to its
delegate, Thomas O. Dunn, chairman of
the grievance committee. â¢
Mr. : Dunn at once, began a vigorous
fight. He waited upon every customer the
breweries have in the city, explained the
situation and asked for co-operation. He
also called up every, political and business
"pull" he could muster ind finally Adloff
& Hauerwass surrendered. Maler & Zo
belein and the Los Angeles Erewine Com
pany held out and insisted that nothing
would compel them to fall into line.
They made good their threat until this
morning and- then the order was given the
bottlers at Maier & ZotxÂ»leln's to : stop
work. They did -so and three, hours later
the management of the brewery sent worrj
to ; Mr. Dunn that after due . deliberation
the. company had decided "to agree to nil

BOTTLERS' UNION
WINS A STRIKE
MTSS WINIFREDB McLAUGHLIN,
WHO GETS A DIPLOMA AS A
HARP VIRTUOSO.
NEW YORK, April 12.â William E.
Coffin of this city, who was a former part
ner in the banking house of Coffin &
Stanton, which made a general assign
ment in 1894, filed a petition in bankruptcy
in the United States District Ceurt to-day.
He schedules his liabilities at $4,150,907
and assets at $25, which is cash in bank.
The secured claims amount to $2,986,172.
Â¦ The debts are old ones, having been con
tracted by the firm in its usual transac
tions of a banking-house business prior
to the assignment in 1894. Coffin is liable
on all the claims named in the petition un
der the laws governing partnership liabili
ties. In October, 1894, the house made a
general assignment for the benefit of the
creditors to Newman Erb. Later, by an
order of court, Thomas P. Wicke was
made receiver of all the assets of the firm.
The largest creditor who holds no se
curity is the city of Santa Cruz, Cal.,
$332,000. This sum is due the municipality
on a contract for bonds purchased.
The firm, it was said, was in the habit
of making loans with "Western banks by
putting up a partial security of first-class
bonds and stocks and hypothecating as
the balance of security bonds and stocks
of companies which the firm had pro
moted and which were practically unmar
ketable. In furthering their numerous
plans the partners became practically the
fiscal agents for a number of "Western
cities, Including Seattle.

W.. WASHINGTON, April 12.â Secretary
sf the Treasury Gage, in pursuance of his
policy to purchase on account of the sink
ing fund such long-time bonds ap may be
offered at a price making the return to
the seller equivalent to selling new 2 per

A lot of these same bonds was offered to

BAN RAFAEL, April 12.â Some days ago
the San Francisco daily papers contained
the notice of the death of Honore Mallon
et the City and County Hospital. The
simple announcement has created more
than usdal interest here, for the people
of this city remember Hono* Mallon as a
person other than a subject for charity.
Nature had civen her a beautiful form
and face and the death of her father and
mother and later her brother conferred
upon her an estate that made her a much
sought heiress. This is why people could
hardly believe that the Bubject of the
death notice was the once beautiful Ho
nore Biggins.
In the early days of this county Thomas
Eiggins made his home here with his wife.
In association with other pioneers he
6tarted extensive brick yards on the bay
Bhore. San Francisco was growing and
the brick business brought Thomas Big
gins a fortune. His wealth was dis
tributed over the county, Including
ranches, town lots and buildings in many
localities. Fortune smiled upon him in
other ways. His home was blessed with
several childrenâ two boys and a girl.
The boys were bright lads and the girl
possessed wondrous beauty. All went
well with the Biggins family until death
claimed the parents. Then fortune
ceased to smile upon them.
The boys, Thomas and James, no sooner
GAGE MAKES
BOND PURCHASE
received their share of the estate than
they launched upon careers of dissipation.
They went the pace that kills and in sev
eral years both were dead. Thomas died
here and James passed away in San
Francisco, where at the time it was be
lieved he committed suicide.
In the meantime Honore had married
Charles E. MaJIon. Several children
blesseo the union and for a time it seemed
that Ill-fortune .would pass the stately
Honcre and leave her In the possession of
husband, children, beauty and wealth.
But this was not to be. In 1893 Charles
Mallon died at his home In this city. The
blow was a sad one for his wife and for
a time she mourned him deeply. Then a
change came over her. She was no longer
contented to lead the quiet, humdrum life
she had before. The same sinister fate
that had made victims of her brothers
seized her. Her lands and properties
were scattered to the winds. Along the
primrose path of reckless pleasure she
scattered with lavish hand her inherit
ance. Her children were placed in an
orphan asylum. She sold the roof over
her head and went to San Francisco. The
life she led there is shrouded in mystery
to her friends here.
The notice in the papers recently has
awakened many memories here. ' Honore
Biggins, belle of the county, admired and
loved, and Honore Mallon dead, a pauper
in a public institution! The lives of the
members of Thomas Biggins' family -have
been tragedies. ' .

The heat Increased, ily bones seemed as
though crisped and charred with heat
and I could seem to feel my fle3h melting
and dropping away from the bones.
"I tri^d to pull my hand away and could
not. I braced my knees against the mar
ble slab and gave an extra wrench. In
stantly I found myself lying on the cop
crete floor. I must have fainted for a
moment, but did not know it.
"The burn was carefully dressed and I
thought no more of it for twenty-four
hours. Then I began to have pains in
my stomach. The bowels and muscles of
the stomach would contract and . relax
spasmodically and the pain was intense.
It was similar to the feeling experienced
when one grasps a heavily charged elec
tric battery."
Gradually Ames grew worse and blood
poisoning set In. For three weeks he was
kept alive on a diet of strychnine and
brandy. First his hand was cut off and
yesterday the arm up to the elbow was
amputated to save bis life. He Is likely
to recover.
Ames Is chief engineer of the Tacoma
Railway and Power Company, owning the
Tacoma street railways. He has workcl
around power houses fifteen years ana
never before received a. burn. B*or four
teen years he was an engineer for the
Southern Pacific and for several years
served as engineer for the Pacific Steam

It Is admitted that Lieuteant Com

his object had been attained in making
an example of two agitators, who, it is
alleged, were at the bottom of the recent
labor I troubles, and who had been even
mere recently engaged In inciting another
strike. , The . former strike was settled by
a mutual agreement by all parties to re
gard the schedule of wages drawn up and
published in the Official Gazette as the

the, schedule as unjust and calling upon
workmen to resent it.
HAVANA,' April 12.â The Cuban Consti

record to-day against the Platt amend

that the convention should declare itself
opposed to the amendment "on account of
the terms of some clauses and the way in
which they are drawn, and also on the
contents of the others, especially clauses
III. VI and VII."
-The .. conservatives assert that . this ac
tion is embarrassing, inasmuch as it prac

incensed and threaten to make trouble.
At a later hour this afternoon both men

SAN JOSE/ April- 12.â William M. Grlf
,fln has rnade public his letter of resigna
tion as president of. the California Pack
ers' Company bearing date March 28.
He says he was led to take this step
on account of controversy between him
self and members of the directory of the
Cured Fruit . Asociation, and that he did
it in the interest of harmony. He asserts
that if there is any trouble It Is his own,
and that none exists between the pack
ers and - the association.
To-day he took the tiger into the arena
to put him through some of his tricks.
Rajah was known to be very vicious. Bos
terek wore a heavy wire mask over his
head and neck and carried a revolver and
a club. The animal was cowed into sub
mission while in the arena and was final
ly released and started toward his cage,
the route being a winding passageway
that extended . from the arena back to
the . rear of the cages. While Bosterek
and the tiger were in the narrow pas
sageway the animal suddenly jumped for
Bosterek and sunk his fangs into the
trainer's left arm. The force of the blow
threw Bosterek to the floor. Then the
tiger tore at the mask, his teeth going
through and tearing Bosterek's face in a
terrible manner. He was unable to use
his revolver and shouted for help. Cap
tain Bonavila, another trainer, rushed to
Bosterek's assistance and drove the tiger
into the cage. Bosterek's right foot and
legs ' are badly injured and he may lose
his left arm.

AT>'P7Â«7RXT s * >< 'f M KiyPR.THE second series of baseball
games is now under way and tho
contests so far played show
enough to prejudge the kind of
baseball which wlll.be offered by
the California League during the early
part of the season.
There is no question that the season has
opened with every indication of strong
popular favor and conditions are such this
year that the game can be brought back
to Its old-time popularity. It is the public
that Is being served and every demand
made by it I should be given an attent
ear. So far the teams playing In the Cali
fornia League have acquitted themselves
on the field in good fashion. The rest lies
with the managers.
Popular verdict has fixed upon the San
Francisco and the" Los Angeles teams as
the two strongest combinations of the
league ' and that impression seems to be
founded on facts. â¢ But It. is too early at
this stage of the running to pick out win
ners. The four nines, although settled
as to personnel, have. not yet crystallized.
The local team has been experimenting at
third and In the right territory. I Nordyke,
who guards the third station, is not' yet
In form, but should develop Into a good

FOR THE EARLY BASEBALL LEAD
man. . Croll has been relected to attend
to the right 'garden. It remains as yet
for these newcomers to show the measure
of their abilities.
Sacramento was crippled by. the absence
of Stanley, during several of the games
of the first series.- Oakland and Los An
geles, however, have, not suffered in any
such way. They have played their reg
ular teams without suffering a hitch.. .
That no mistake was made in drawing
the Los Angeles team into the league Is
clearly evidenced by*the enthusiasm mani
fested In that city. In the southern city
the . people' are swelling with ' baseball
ardor. They consider their team I as
something of themselves and grow wildly
vociferous â¢ when attending a game in
which the Los Angeles team takes part.
The Thursday and Friday, attendance
has increased. This was noticeable in the
first Los Ang-eles-San Francisco game.
The second game of tlie series of the
League, of the Cross Cadets Baseball
League will be played at Sixteenth: and
Folsom street grounds to-morrow. . . The
first game will be between Companies D
and C at 12:30 and the second srame be

ANGLERS ENJOYING
THE EARLY FISHING
W. R. Welch, Game Warden of Santa
Cruz, writes to the Fish Commissioners
that fishing in his county is unusually
good. He pays one. fortunate angler killed
five flsh over three pounds In weight in
one day in Soquel Creek. Reports from
Boulder Creek and vicinity are unusually
favorable for this time of the year.
Some of the members of the San Fran
cisco Fly Casting Club tell some very in

catches made in coast streams since the
opening of the season. - â¢ â -
Colonel William Keller has gone to the
MoCloud River and will make his head
quarters at Baird for the next month or
two. The conditions on the McCloud are
eaid to be favorable. Quite a number of
the members of the fly-casting club will
go up there the latter part of next week.
The fly-casting club jkIM hold a series of
contests on Stow Lake this afternoon and
to-morrow. Since the lake -was cleaned
out the water is as clear as crystal. The
trout and bass that were taken from the
lake when the water was drawn out can
be seen in the pool at the foot of the

on previous occasions . they are unusually
fine specimens.

recognized as the accepted course for row
ing races. :; He would llke;to see a track
built alongside . the water, so that races
could be followed from start to finish by
spectators on ari^- observation train. He
believes that "â it can be satisfactorily
shown. that the enterprise of the railroad
company, would be well rewarded." He has
obtained facts and figures from rowing
centers in the East tending to show how
great is the public interest in boat racing
when properly conducted. --- .- .
The oarsmen of San Francisco are Blow
in beginning the serious work of the row

fact that hardly a single one of the boat

COLLEGE MEN ON â¢
THE TENNIS COURTS
One week from to-day the intercollegiate
tennis championship games will be played
at the California Club at Bush and Scott
streets. With the games but one . week
off, the uncertainty of the outcome seems
to increase daily. . . ' ' _
In recent practice games Harry Weihe,'
Stanford's best player, showed that . he
has improved much, although he hasprac
ticed but little during the past year. Wei
he Is probably the Quickest man on' thn
c<Jurts and at volleying -he - has -few - su
periors. William Roth, who will play the
other slngleB match for Stanford, has been
playing very poorly in practice, but -as he
is strictly a tournament player his col
leagues axe not worrying much. Dick Ad
ams, who will be Weihe's partner in the
doubles, is rather an uncertain element.
Should he give his partner any support
at-all in doubles their chances will be very
good.
Stanford has Â«. slight advantage inas
much as she Is represented by three men
and will have a fresh man in the doubles,
while California is represented by but two
men who will play both singles and-dou
bles, i
Paul Selby and Drummond McGavin will
wield the rackets for Berkeley. Selby is
the older and probably better player of
the two. but his partner is very little be
hind him. McGavin is the youngest player
of the five, but has been â¢ playing tennis
ever since he could hold a racket." At
times he plays, a remarkable game in prac
tice, but he is a very poor tournament
player. McGavin Is a better doubles play
er than sineles. as he is very slow on his
feet and seems unable to execute his
Btrokes on the run. On the whole, Cali
fornia's chances depend very much on
the way this youngster plays on the day
of the meet. .
In a practice match during the week
Selby and McGavin won two sets from
George Whitney and Sumner Hardy. The
team work of the former was very good.
Grant Smith will try conclusions with
the Stanford - men to-day , on . their own
courts. . ; â¢ ...

CONDITION OF
BLUE AND GOLD
MEN NOT GOOD
Suffering From Injuries and Over
training â Rest From^Work Is
Remedy Prescribed by Coaches
BERKELEY. April 12.â Most of Call
fornia'6 track men have been resting sinca
Ihe university championship field day, or
doing very light work. Many of them were
in the first stages of stalcness and others
were at the point of feeling the effects of
too fine training at the time a halt In work
was declared.
There will be no more heavv practice
before the intereollepiate meet of April
20. Rest is needed by all the men and nec
essary to several who have been hurt on
the field. None of the injuries are expected
to keep the men out of the intercollegiate
field day, but anxiety among the athletes
is felt for several.
Sprinter Cadogan's thigh was strained
during the university championship meet.
It is feared that he has a split muscle.
The result of such an injury can hardly
be foretold. Sometimes it is serious and
sometimes not. With awiet and care Cad
ogan will probably be in good condition
by the time he is called upon to sprint for
California. Â¦
Powell, hurdler and high jumper, has a
split muscle in his thish of three weeks'
standing. The injury r>t first was slight,
but he went into two field days since then
and now training is out of the question
with him. Fortunately it is a "sprinting"
muscle and not a "jumumg" muscle that
is split. In his events Powell needs his
"jumping" muscles most. Rest of a week
will probably build up die wasted tissue
to its normal state.
Brown and Townsend, who fell in the
220-yard dash two weeks ago. are recover
ing from their injuries. Squires, the 440
yard man, keeps in soo'l condition. Ser
vice, after his wonderful mile run, was
laid off a week. -,:.V
Plaw came out yesterday for the first
time. He whirls the hammer in his same
old style. Hoffman has commenced train
ing for the northern trip in the pole vault
and high jump. He has competed against
Stanford four times and by intercollegiate
agreement cannot enter again. This does
not, however, keep him from contesting
with the universities of Oregon and Wash
ington. His past work assures him a place
on the track team which will go north In
May.

ATHLETES AT
STANFORD ARE
HARD AT WORK
Changes in the Baseball Team
Bring Improvement Track
Men in a Tryout Competition
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 12.â
The athletes who will represent the car
dinal In the various intercollegiate events
have spent a busy week in rounding
themselves into final form. The baseball
men have been given the most careful
training by Dr. Murphy in order that
some of ' last Saturday's costly 1 errors
may riot be repeated in to-morrow's game
with Berkeley. ; The infield . will remain
without change, but the outfield ' will "be
shaken up considerably. Lowenthal at
left field will give place to Brown, who
was in right field, Bennett will go to right
field, while Symonds will remain in the
center garden. Parker will be in the box
for Stanford again, and it is expected that
his experience in last Saturday's game
will be of much value to him. The infield
has shown marked improvement this week
and should play its consistent game to
morrow.
The tryouts to decide upon the men who
will represent Stanford upon the track
were held last evening. They resulted as
follows:
120-yard hurdleâ Naramore. '03, first by a
yard: Kuhn. '03. second. . Time, :17.
Mile run â Hamilton. '02, first by two yards;
Sprague, '04, second by thirty yards; Nangle,
'03. third. Time, 4:59.
440-yard dashâ Dunn, '04, first by three yards;
Holman. '04, second by two yards; Blrtch, '01.
thl--d. Time. :55. .
100-yard dash â Hamilton, '04, first by a foot;
Lamb. '04, second by a yard; Bubbl '04, third.
Time. :10 2-5.
Half-mile runâ Chadbourne.' '02, flr*t by ten
yards; Hawley. '03, second. Time, 2:07.
220-vard hurdle, first heatâ Taylor. '04,' first
by fifteen yards; Kuhn. '03, second: time,
:2S 2-5. Second heatâ Naramore, '13, first by
ten yards; Knight, second; time, :28.
220-j-ard dashâ Lamb, '04, first by two yards;
Hamilton, '04, second by two yards; Bubb
â¢04 third. Time, :23 1-5.
The poor condition of the track, together
with a cold wind which blew across the
runners, prevented any good records be
ing made. -
The second intercollegiate game of the
series between the two colleges will be
called on the Stanford campus to-morrow
at 3 p. m. A special train will bring the
California people back to the city after
the glee club concert In the evening. .
HOME AND HOME
TOURNAMENT ON
OAKLAND LINKS
Local Golfers Considered Strong
Team but Contest Between
the Two Clubs Will Be Close
This afternoon the second half of the
home and home tournament between
teams of six men representing the Han
Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs will be
played on the Adams Point course. Tha
Oakland representatives will probably be
the same as on last Saturday, viz.: .W. P.
Johnson, E. R. Folger, F< S. Stratton. It.
M. Fitzgerald. C. P. Hubbard and Arthur
Goodall. Last Saturday the San Fran
cisco team placed 22 holes to Its credit,
but the lead may be a little reduced this
afternoon, as the Oaklanders will be on
their home links. But the silver trophy
to be taken by the team- winning two out
of three matches over thirty-six holes is
almost certain to become the property of
the San Francisco Golf Club, which won.
the first match. The San Francisco team
will be somewhat changed to-day. Lans
ing P. Kellogg, captain of the city club,
returned to San Francisco a few days ago
and will probably captain the team. It
is ' possible that John Lawaon may not
play, while H. D. Pillsbury will probably
be included in the team. H..B. Goodwin
has recovered from his recent indisposi
tion, but, having had no practice for sev
eral weeks, will not take part In to-day's
contest.
Ihe San Rafael Golf Club has no event
set down on Its schedule for to-day, but
next Saturday will hold a medal play
handicap over eighteen holes for men, to
begin at 2 p. m. Early In May a tourna
ment, open to men or women members of
any of the local golf clubs, will be played
on the San Rafael links.
The Oakland Golf Club is prospering
and may enlarge its clubhouse and change
its course, which at present has fourteen
holes, into a full elghteen-hole one.
The fair green of the Fort Baker course
is in tetter condition now. than ever be
forei but the clay putting greens still
leave much to be desired. An entertain
ment in aid of the building fund of the
Sausalito Golf Club will be given to-night
in the- main hall of the San - Francisco
Yacht Club house by the Albatross Club,
which is composed of officer a of the
United States Fish Commission's steamer
and their wives, assisted by several young
ladies of Sausalito: Several tableaux
vlvants and a dramatic piece will be pre
sented.
Some new ground rules are being rec
ommended for adoption by the San Fran
cisco Golf Club with reference to the
wood, the^c&rral and the telephone wires.
It ia proposed that a player whose ball
falls into the wood to the east of tho
course, instead of dropping his ball and
losing the distance, may play It out if
this- can be done. Also that any- ball
which on an approach shot hits a post or
wire on the fly may be played over again
without the loss of a stroke. That, !f the
telephone posts or wires are hit on going
to the second hole, the player may make
the stroke again without counting it; or,
if the ball lies so that he will break his
club if he plays It, he may move It away
and drop it without penalty. With regard
to the corral in front of the ninth, green,
it is suggested that the player should be
permitted either to play out or to lift the
ball, dropping it ten yard3 behind the
corral.
It is plain that certain details 6f the
formation of the Pacific Coast. Golf Asso
ciation which were not given to the local
press until April 5 were, divulged in some
quarters at an earlier date, as an Eastern
golf monthly contains a statement of its
formation in its April issue. The selec
tion of Hugh Tevis as president of the
new association is a good one, as he is an
enthusiastic golfer and a rich man,, who
Is largely Interested in both Central and
Southern California. Other clubs repre
sented . on the board of directors are the
Oakland and San Rafael Golf clubs, the
Country clubs of Pasadena and Los An
geles and the Riverside Polo and Golf
Club, with four seats on the board left
for the Pacific Northwestern Association.
The associate clubs, with full privileges,
will pay annual dues of $25, while the al
lied clubs, whose members may play in
tournaments, but who take no part In the
government of the association, pay $15 per
annum. Invitations have been Issued to
all the clubs within the district to join the
association, with the view of being quali
fied to enter members for the champion
ship competitions to be held during the
year. It is confidently hoped that - many
of the best golfers of Southern California
will visit San Francisco to take part In the
first men's championship, the railroad
companies havinc promised reduced rates
to all duly qualified members of the a3-

James Braid to-day on the links at El

brilliant golf and a splendid contest was
the result. At the end of the first round
Vardon had a one-bole lead, his scores
being 75 and 77. Vardon won the match
two up and one to play.
The second round was a tie, 74 to 74.
Both the players showed phenomenal

OLYMPIC CLUB HANDBALL
Owing to Illness in his family Thomas
Curley, who was Robert Bowman's part
ner in the doubles handball tournament
now coming to a close- at the Olympic
Club, was unable to play lact evening and
It devolved on his Dartner to either de
fault the game or play slngle-hande.i
against Powers and Green. He decided to
play it out alone and plucklly oitted his
skill against that of his two opponents.
Powers and Green, however, proved too
much for him. They defe?-ted Bowman by
a score of 51 to 32. Bowman made a erai
lant struggle, but the fifteen points handi
cap enjoyed by his opponents and their
cleverness was too much for him.
On Sunday afternoon Oreen and Powers
are to meet Jack Gleason and Louis Levy.
The winner of this game will be pitted
against Russ and Kennedy on Monday
night to play the deciding game of the
tournament. The teams that will play to
morrow met last week and Powers and
Green won their game by one point after
the severest handball game of the tourna
ment. Gold and silver medal3 will be pre
sented by the club to the.teams securing
first and second places.

SEASON'S EVENTS
FOR TRAP-SHOOTERS
A few months ago all the prize-fight
promoting organizations were extremely
.-r.xious to take a fling at McGovern.
Then Jim Kennedy arrived upon the scene
and McGovern was given up as lost. Jim
Kennedy smiled serenely, and when all
other match-makers were burning wires
to head off the Terrible and switch him
on to their own tracks, he sat back in a
comfortable cafe chair, demolishing tar
tar steaks and making yellow Pilsener
look as if it never was. And he might
well Emile. Terry is for the Twentieth'
Century Club and none other.
The last day of this month McGovern
will fight with Oscar Gardner. Eastern
and Western men who have seen both
perform see but one man In the ring.
Gardner, who'is training at Alameda, is
training well and faithfully, and there is
just a chance that something might slip
in this contest. This tnay be Terry's Wa
terloo. â¢
But it is not the Gardner-McGovern
contest that In its very prospect sets the
\\ estern tongues on the wag. Erne-Mc-
Govern is the shibboleth, and we are very
likely to get it. Frank Erne says much
about returning home, yet he stays â very
much like the maid who would not b*e
kissed. Before any Erne-McGovern
match is consummated, the latter will be
in this city to nominate conditions. As
Terry will arrive some time next week,'
all further negotiations have been put off
until then.
Xed Homan and Alec Greggains. as di
rectors of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, realized early in the day that Mc-
Govern was bottled, so Homan will leave
for the hj&st this evening for heavy
weight game. He Is out for Fitzsimmons
.and Jeffries or a series of big cards.
George Green has come to life again.
He wants to put out Cribb and Thurs
ton In the same evening. Greggains
would like to match Thurston with Green
for good money.
Joe Bernstein and Solly Smith have been
matched to fight in Los Angeles in May.

the absence of Partin the shot-put should
be won by Rose, the lanky giant from
Healdsburg 1 , and the contest for first place
In the high Jump between Bell of that
school and Hicfcey of the Berkeley High
should furnish a close fight. Bell Is also
scheduled to win points both in the pole

Track Notes.
JAKE HOLTMAN, who made his
.California debut at Oakland track
during the recent turf unpleasant
ness, replaced Starter Dick Dwyer
at Tanforan yesterday. Dwyer left
for Chicago in the forenoon and he will
flash the red bunting there on the opening
day. at the Lakeside track. : The Tanforan
management would not listen to ( the use'
of the recall flag, so Holtman,' much
against his wishes, "went It their way."
The starts were ' punctual and clean cut,
his Oakland successes being again re
peated. -
Six difficult betting problems confronted
the talent, of which number it (solved but
three with any very satisfactory pecuni
ary results. " The fields were several de
grees below stake quality, though supply
ing some very fair sport.
Pat Dunne's gelding, Toah, a 7 to 10 fa
vorite for the opening six funong sprint,
made a most indifferent showing. Never
at any part of it did he display much
speed, finishing third. Ada N, ridden by
Ijominick, early took the lead, and, ridden
out, beat Bernota a length. Byron Kose,
a 5uC to 1 shot, had considerable speed.
A band of twelve very ordinary young
sters started in the maiden two-year-oid
scramble, with Quadra, the Jennings en
try, closing a slight favorite over Pcrous.
Owen Mounce had the leg on the latter
colt, and showing first in the' stretch won
easily." R. -Murpny sneaked. up on the In
side with Tou lou, an 8 to 1 criance, steal
ing the place from Quadra.
i'irst Call, the crippled imp. Order horse
frcm Jimmy Coffey's barn, defeated the
ragged collection - of platers in the first
mne selling affair like breaking sticks.
Backed down to 6 to 5 favoritism, he was
cut off on the backstretch, and then came
in, eased up, before Canejo and Midian.
The latter horse propped as the barrier
went up, losing several lengths.' -
111 fortune again tacked on to Par
menion, for, after practically closing fa
vorite in the betting on the second mile
run, he was defeated somewhat handily
by Alaska. Mounce â¢ rode the latter, and
waiting to the stretch turn, there made
his move and led Parmenion out a length.
Urchin at 7 to 1 finished third.
P.ecause it was generally supposed Dr.
Bernays was a bit short last time out,
Fisher's horse was made favorite for the
mile and a furlong run, decided under
selling conditions. Despite all of Mounce's
urging the Doctor could not untrack him
self, finishing a poor fourth. Four to one
could be had about Scotch Plaid, and rid
den by J. Ransch. the Burns & Water
house entry was never headed. Gauntlet
ran second, a lengrtSi before Twinkler.
Merops finally won another purse. Re
ceding in the betting on the concluding
mile run from 8 to 5 to 5 to 2, he shaped
out all the running, and with little to
spare at the wire disposed of Floribird by
three lengths. . ,
Three Favorites Gather In Purses at Tanforan.
â¢ Toah Made a Disappointing Showing, v
By F. E. Mulholland.
Thirteen innings of baseball; "like moth
er used to make," was dished up yesterr
day for 500 diamond gourmands at Recrea
tion grounds. The Angels were 'the
guests and they violated every right and
privilege of social gustatory etiquette by
subjecting their hosts to a humiliation
which subsequent blood-letting can alone
atone. "When the last course was served
the local entertainers were put under the 1
table and the orchestra play_ed bell, music
which , sounded 7 â 6. a new sort of tune
for the sacred- local nine to dance to.
The orangemen seem to have extra in
nings in their inside pockets. "With them
It Is not sporadic, but epidemic.
During those long thirteen innings It
was all earnest baseballâ all but ' once,
when voiceful Mr. Johnson forgot himself
In a revelry of lung execution. The
blatant outpourings of - the - Southerner
jarred on Umpire O'Connell's nerves and
"Youngey" went out of the game long be
fore the fruits of victory were gatnered.
"Fireman" Fitzpatrick lost the game for
San Francisco and Jimmie Whalen saved
the nine from a .crushing defeat. ; Fitz
patrick stood on the slab in the first in
ning, and after he had'-- presented the : or
ange growers with three strolls to first,
five, swats and as many runs, his most
ardent admirer was willing to lay him on
a colder slab and forget his few past deeds
of goodness.- He was compelled to sun
himself on the bench. throughout the rest
of the long game and bemoan his fate,
'while his side partner Whalen strove hard
in the box to prevent inevitable defeat. -
It was a game that will go down in" the
annals of local baseball history â thirteen
innings of heartthrobs for the spectators .
and anxiety, for every player on the field.
The isolated rooter lost his voice, Captain
Hutchinson frequently his temper and the
management many nice new .balls Â¦ valued
at $1 25 apiece. -" ...
After Los Angeles had scored five tal
lies'in the first, the local team held the
visitors down until the seventh. In the
interim Uncle Hank's own rolled up four
runs. The Orange Blossoms gathered an
other petal in the . seventh and Uncle
Henry, managed to even the score, in the
ninth, necessitating the- extra innings.
Then Los Angeles worked like beavers,
but through the splendid. pitching of Wha
len were unable to make the deciding run
until the thirteenth, when BrockhofJ sin
gled to right and Bowman scurried home.
It was a veritable pitcher's battle, .with
honors on Whalen's , brow. ] Hale worked
hard and showed -himself a capable twir
ler, but the freckle-faced youth who occu
pied the box for the local aggregation was
even cooler and headier. "With victory in
their grasp a half dozen times, San Fran
cisco was unable -to seize it. Luck and
clever fielding on the part of the men
from the land of sunshine and .flowers
were agajnst them.
Kelly accepted thirteen chances and
never made â¢ a miss. His fielding and
throwing to bases was brilliant. Bowman
nailed some difficult ones and "Hank"
Spies of the "old world',' was by no means
dead. Â¦ .
Hildebrand contributed a circus catch
and two runs? Pabst was asleep at the
switch at one stage of the game and al
lowed Krug to handle a ball that was in
the center fielder's garden, costing his
team a run. â¢ â¢
Captain Hutchinson filed a protest with
Scorer McFarlln that ne will not press.
He is of the opinion that to call a man
out on an infield fly, both first and sec
ond base must be occupied. â¢ Umpire
O'Connell thought differently and ruled
that Hale was out on a pop fly dropped
in front- of the plate by Graham -when
Bowman was on .first. . The detailed ac
count of the game will be found in the
following score:

CHANCE TO SMILE.
While such difference of opinion exist ' it is of
course not at all likely any* movement will.be made
to change the system. The only feature of note,
therefore, in the discussion is the evidence it discloses
of'the eagerness of the American people to bring all
the old and'time-honored institutions of society to' the
test and determine; by full debate whether they are
really so excellent as custom ranks them. -.On one
An advocate of a majority verdict says: "If the
Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States
constantly fail to agree upon questions of a class per
fectly familiar to them, and minority Judges are con
stantly writing dissenting opinions, it is impossible to
suppose that a constant stream of unanimous conclu
sions from juries upon all sorts of questions, upon"
many of which expert witnesses differ widely, repre
sents actual unanimity of opinion." He argues, there
fore, that the unanimous verdicts which we" get from
juries are not really unanimous, but represent either
a politic concession on the part of the minority or
else a stamping out of the minority by a majority of
the jurors. Thus we have a virtual majority rule by in
direction, and: it would be much better to establish
such rule by law and thus save time and the not in
frequent disagreements resulting from the present
system.
The conservative side of the question has, however,
strong supporters. One of them- in a communication to
the Boston Globe says: "After an experience of a
quarter of a century at the trial of civil and of crimi
nal cases I answer no to . the question propounded.
No American institution has better stood the test of
time than our present Jury system; man has been
unable to find a better method of finding facts on
disputed evidence." Another lawyer of long; expe
rience, at the bar says:. "By all means let us adhere
to the unanimous verdict. It works substantial justice
in the average case, and when it errs it is more likely
to err upon the right than the wrong side. * * *
There is no coercion in the jury-room that a patient
and conscientious minority cannot' resist. ".'â¢
The discussion has now shifted to Boston, but in
that city the question is not whether juries shall be
abolished altogether, but whether the law shall not be
so amended as to give a majority the right to return
a verdict.
SOME time ago attention was directed to a dis
cussion in Pennsylvania over the statement of
one of the Judges of that commonwealth that
â¢;he time has come for a revision of the prevailing sys
tem of trial by jury. It was brought out during the
controversy that a good deal of dissatisfaction exists
with the system, and that a considerable number of
litigants would prefer to have their cases heard and
determined by a Judge alone rather than by a court
made up of Judge and jury. A similai "condition of
public sentiment was a little later disclosed in Lon
don, where a"n investigation showed that a very large
proportion of suits in that city where the parties had
the option of a trial with or without a jury were heard
bj r the Judge alone, the litigants preferring not to take
the risk of a jury verdict or a mistrial resulting from
inability onthe part of the jurors to agree.

Another in the same section, which worships at tht
feet of Bryan and has howled ceaselessly against our
policy of getting islands in the sea, turns and rends
its leader and its fellow followers in this way: "Next
to the fall of their beloved Aguinaldo the Yankee Fili
pinos will have cause to mourn over the probability
that the Danish West India Islands are more likely
than ever to fall into Uncle Sam's bag. The King
Â«nd Crown Prince of Denmark, who heretofore have
been bitterly opposed to ceding the islands, are re
ported as now favorable to the proposition. The rest
should be easy for everybody but the New England
rum trust. The isles of Santa Cruz and St. Thomas
are famous for the superior quality and pleasant flavor
of their rum, and when they become American, and
their products hence domestic, the coarse distillation

One Democratic paper in South Carolina broke
out in words and phrases as follows: "The slant

VERILY our Southern brother, of Democratic
faith, is mysterious and past finding out.
The most merciless and really foolish propo
sitions as to the disposition to be made of Aguinaldo
:ome from the press of that section. Northern papers,
as a rule, take a dignified view of the fallen general,
repress respect for him as the leader of a people whose
good will is" desired by this country, and make no sug
gestion for his degradation or infamous punishment.
But it is not so with the press of that section which
ttood solidly for Bryan in the last two campaigns.
SOUTHERN OPINION.
;ln this connection it is worth noting that the New
York Times recently published a review, of gifts made
for public purposes in this country, showing that the
total value of such gifts for the' year 1900 amounted
to $47,500,000, and that during the last eight years the
aggregate reached the magnificent sum of $314,600,
000. It thus appears that if the opportunities for ac
quiring wealth are greater in this country than else
where, so also are the inducements which incline tha
successful to share their good fortune with the whole
community. Our millionaires are not only the most
numerous but the 'most liberal in the world. Europe
and Asia combined can make no such showing of gen
erous gifts as that which is presented here. It is
therefore evident that the American is not only the
most enterprising in acquiring- wealth, but is the most
generous and public spirited in making use of it.
One of the most convincing evidences that the
monetary wealth of the world is now in the United
States, is to be found in the fact that New York has
become the financial center of the world. At the pres
ent time it appears likely that the deficit in the British
tmdget for the year will exceed $300,000,000, and it has
been pointed out that had such a condition, existed
twenty-five years ago there would have been great
uneasiness and alarm in the money markets of the
world; whereas to-day, despite the large expendi
tures fqr military purposes in China, in South Africa
and in the Philippines, and vast industrial enterprises
under way in all parts of the globe, there is no dis
turbance whatever in the' world of finance. No dif
ficulty is found in obtaining capital for the largest
kinds of enterprise, anrl- the civilized world moves
along as if the British financial situation were a mat
tst of no particular moment..
In each of the cases specified there is clearly a
laige exaggeration of the fortune, and consequently
the summary as a 1 whole is discredited thereby. It is
quite probable, however, that the estimate that one
half the millionaires of the world are citizens of the
United States is not far wrong. This country is so much,
richer than any other, the opportunities for acquiring
wealth have been so much more abundant here than
elsewhere, and the stimulus to obtain wealth for the
power, it gives in all enterprises for the advancement
cf cities and States and the natioa itself, is so much
stronger than among any other people that it is nat
ural more Americans should attain possession of vast
fortunes than the people of all other lands put to
gether.: Consequently the conclusion of the writer
referred to is not to be rejected in that respect merely
because of his evident exaggerations in particular in
stances. .. .
The list is not to be relied upon as accurate, for the
estimates of the wealth of the men included in it are
apparently based upon reports that are hardly bettc
than guesswork. Thus !Beit, the diamond king of
South Africa, and Li Hung Chang are credited with
being the richest men in the world, their fortunes
being rated at $500,000,000 each. The third place is
assigned to Robinson oi South Africa, who is said
to have a fortune equal to the value of $400,000,000,
while Rockefeller comes fourth with $250,000,000.

The first effect of an attempt to revise the tariff
would be to reopen the whole question, and that
would mean the subjection of ihe business interests
of the country to another long period of uncertainty,
and ; inevitably lead to a repression of enterprise. No
capitalist would care to undertake new industries so
long as he was in doubt what duty would be levied
upon foreign goods coming into competition with his
products. There may be changes of a minor kind
that might be advantageously made in the tariff, -for
nothing in this world is perfect, but that Baboock will
have. any strong support for. his bill providing for a
considerable reduction of duties or a radical altera
tion of the tariff is not at all likely.
It is difficult to believe that in all this there is any
thing more than springtime talk. The country has
been so prosperous under the present tariff and has
so shortly recovered from, widespread disaster caused
by tariff- tinkering in the direction of free trade it is
hardly likely any considerable number of statesmen
will seriously attempt to make a change of that kind
again. Even Democrats may be expected to, fight
shy of tariff reform for many a year to .come. .They
would rather make another contest for free silver than
for free trade, for what class of workingmen can be
expected to make another trial of the experience that
followed the enactment of the Wilson bill?"
. As Roberts is a Republican the. free trade papers
have been, quick to seize upon his speech and quote
it as an evidence that protection is no longer regarded
as a fundamental principle of Republicanism. Congress
man . Babcock of Wisconsin is another Republican
who is said to have taken "what' the free traders call
''broad views of the situation." He is reported to
have started a movement to reduce duties levied under
the.present tariff, and it is asserted that the represen
tatives of some of the protected interests are so. far
with, him that they will make no objection to his
scheme. â¢ ...
The discussion had its origin in a speech made by
George E. Roberts, Director of the Mint, before the
Bankers' Club of Chicago. Mr. Roberts is reported
to have said that our trade balances are now so large
we cannot expect our customers to pay in. cash, nor
can we bring all our wealth home; we must leave* a
large portion of it in foreign lands, consequently we
must become a foreign trading nation, and therefore
must revise our present tariff to suit the changed con
ditions. ' â¢ .
CONGRESS is not in session, politics is dull and
the silly season is approaching. It is therefore
in the natural' order of "things' that all sorts of
discussions should break out here and there by way
of making talk' and giving statesmen an opportunity
for keeping themselves before the public. The first
of these discussions that has obtained any wide no
toriety is, of all things in the world, a discussion of
tariff reform. It is a suggestion that the time has
come for reconsidering the question of free trade or
protection.
A NEW TARIFF DEBATE.
point it is pleasing to note that all parties agree, and
that is that juries should be composed of men who are
known to be honorable and should be treated with as
much consideration as the Judges and the attorneys in
the- case. ;
We plead, therefore, for the constant exercise of the
kindliest thoughtfulneis for the comfort and quiet "of
the President and his party, and are quite, sure that
we will not plead in vain.
The trip will be very arduous at its best. As he
comes by New Orleans and crosses Western Texas,
New Mexico and Arizona at the time of year when
the ardor of summer heat is upon. that line of travel,
it must not be- forgotten that much time must be
granted for rest and recuperation.
Therefore let us spare him as far as possible the
fatigue of mere ceremonial and give him ample access
to the hearty and non-fatiguing, considerate and
kindly contact with the "people.
He is now in his' second term in the most exacting
position in the world. No other -man charged with
the administrative affairs of a people is compelled to
address himself to as great a variety, volume and com
plication of issues as the President of the United
States. It is President McKinley's fixed habit to
work everything down to the minutest details, and
the magnitude of his ta=k is almost incomprehensible
to those who in " their business or profession have
only one simple line of duty.
It is difficult to restrain California hospitality and
the desire of all our people'to do what they esteem to
be complete honor to the head of the nation and the
members of his official family. But this laudable de
sire must be tempered by consideration for the phy
sical comfort and welfare of the President and his
party. He desires to meet the people, the great, un
official and level-headed people, on at least one occa
sion when he can look them in the face and discourse
of the relation of the government to their welfare,
and develop the old truth that government is of their
making and they should make it wisely if they con
sult their own interests. This opportunity he should
have at all hazards, no matter what mere ceremonial
functions have to be cut to permit, it. Such a course
will be in line with his wish and purpose, and* it is the
truest hospitality to consult the views and comfort of
a guest in such a matter.
Otherwise he should be spared, as much as pos
sible, the fatigue of making speeches.
It will be readily seen, therefore, that mere functions
should yield to the leisure required for the fulfillment
cf the greater purpose of the tour.
It is for this reason that nearly his entire Cabinet
accompanies him. .Those gentlemen have daily duties
of administration which intimately affect the whole
people and relate to the conditions under which they
live and exert their energies for the development of
the country.- - â¢ / â¢*
THE tour of the President, to. begin next month,
is the most extensive -ever made by an incum
bent of that office. It is a wise thing for the
President to do. Wise, not in a merely political sense,
but for its economic value to the material interests of
the country. From the beginning of his career in
Congress President McKinley has been singular
among American statesmen in his close attention to
and expert knowledge of those material interests.
With very definite ideas of the relation of government
to the welfare of the/people he has adhered with the
'most remarkable steadfastness to the principles of leg
islation which he believed would promote ' general
prosperity, and therefore stimulate the enterprise of
the people, giving them a chance to further their for
tunes on the' line of the least resistance. To him, there
fore, this tour means a most intelligent inspection of
physical and economic conditions, and an addition to
his store of that knowledge â¢ which he acquires and
uÂ«es"solely for the public benefit.

the results of their mvestigatlhs. There

having watched their work fork genera

that with but one or two exceptkns there
has- never been any attempt bylhe head

long to the Census Office, and the inform
ation resulting from inquiries covering
such points is collected every teh years.
On the other hand, the department, as a
rule, deals with representative facts, it it
desires to know the rates of wages they
can be ascertained from a sufficient num
ber of concerns In different industries to
establish the facts. If it desires to ascer
tain the cost of production, it is not neces
sary that the data should be secured from
all the establishments in a given industry.
Such a method would be altogether too
expensive for 'the department to under
take, but it can secure the information
from a sufficient number of firms to es
tablish the facts as to the cost of produc
tion in a particular industry. Its investi
gations, therefore, covering indicative in
formation from representative establish
ments, are sufficient to satisfy a study or
the question involved. Sometimes, of
course, the department Is able to cover
the question so thoroughly as to secure
aggregate statements, as, for Instance, in
its investigations relating to building and
loan associations, marriage and divorce,
convict labor, strikes and lockouts.
Statistics of Strikes and Lockouts.
One or two illustrations will serve to
show the methods adopted by the depart
ment. It has made two comprehensive
reports giving the statistics ! relating to
strikes and lockouts in this country. The
first was in 18S7, and covered the data for
the six years, beginning January 1, 1881.
and ended December 31. 1886. and the tenth
annual report covered like data from Jan
uary 1, 1SS7. to June 30, 1894.- The depart
ment is now engaged in collecting similar
data for all strikes and lockouts which
have occurred since the latter date and up
to December 31, 1900, and when this report,
is published the department will have the
data for all strikes and lockouts occurring
in the United States from January 1, 1S81,
to December 31, 1900.
In collecting this information, which re
lates to the number oi persons involved
in the labor controversies, the losses to
capital and to labor, the duration and the
results of each controversy, all properly
tabulated and presented by States and In
dustries, the department secures the data
from' each side engaged in each contro
versy through the personal inquiries of
an expert. An account 13 kept of the oc
currence of- all strikes and lockouts and
then the localities are visited by the ex
pert. He is prepared with schedules of in
quiry, so that the information collected
by all the experts shall be on a uniform
basis. If the parties ordering the strike
and the employers r.gainst whom the
strike is directed agree as to the facts
they are accepted. If there is a, disagree
ment it is the business of the expert to
ascertain the points of disagreement and
by continued inquiry to secure an agree
ment as to the facts. "Thus the statements
reported must be accepted as thoroughly
trustworthy, no effort being spared to se
cure accuracy. Sometimes the facts are
easily obtained, but in great and compli
cated strikes, where a large number of es
tablishments are involved, the difficulty
is very greatly increased.
Getting Statistics of Divorce.
Another illustratlqn is that connected
with the investigation relative to divorces,
especially ordered by Congress. An in
vestigation of the kind, in order to have
any value sociologically, must cover a
sufficiently long period of years to mako
the comparisons valuable. So the facts
were gathered for twentv years. At the
time the investigation was made thcrÂ«
were over 2700 courts. State and Federal,
in the United States having jurisdiction
of divorces. To secure the reauired data
all the facts relative to every petition for
a divorce and every decree for a period of
twenty years from all the 2700 and more
courts had to be examined, yet this worK
was accomplished and all the facts se
cured, either' by the service of experts or
by the mail, for all the courts in the coun
try.
After the information Is brousrhf to the
office it is carefully examined, each sched
ule individually, and if errors occur re
course must be had to original sources of
information for correction. When the
schedules are all in correct order, or as
perfect as the physical conditions wMl
warrant, they, are then tabulated and the
facts arranged and classified in accord
ance with the Information to be brougbc
out.
Value of Labor Statistics.
It is often asked, "What good do labor
statistics do? What 5s the value of the
work of the Department of Labor?" One
might as well undertake to answer the
same auestion relative to the Bureau of
Education or to other offices devoted en
tirely to the dissemination of knowledge.
No one of these offices really puts money
into the pockets of ihÂ«Â» citizens of the
United States. They are and must be
considered as a part of the educational
force of the Government.
Under the general welfare clause of the
constitution the United States oGvern
ment spends about $8,000,000 annually and
employs over 4000 people in scientific and
educational All their work might
be abandoned without interfering one jot
br tittle with the administration of the
Federal Government. There are. however,
certain classes of information which pri
vate enterprise cannot secure, as, for in
stance, no private individual or set of in
dividuals would undertake the collection
of data relative to strikes and lockouts
or-the various other questions which have
been covered by the United States Depart
ment of Labor; yet all such information
is useful. Congress desires it for its own
use, and after having secured it feels at
liberty to publish It for the use of every
body else. So, while it can be shown here
and there that the facts secured by the
Department of Labor and kindred offices
in the United States have resulted In
shaping wise legislation and also in pre
venting unwise legislation, the informa
tion has been more generally of the char
acter of educational work â adding to the
knowledge of the world.
Benefits of Sociology.
The results of the work of such offices
constitute most valuable contributions to
social and politloal science. Sociology to
day commands the attention of thinking
people, but sociology without facts is sim
ply a- theoretical view of the construction
of society. What we need is the actual
facts of what society is doing, for only by
knowing the actual facts can laws be de
duced relative to future conduct. Labor
and capital are both vitally Interested in
social and economic Information The In
vestigation of existing conditions in va
rious directions results In positive knowl
edge,' and through positive knowledge the
errors which grow, out of empirical
observation are corrected. One of the
chief values of the work of the DeDart
ment of Labor is correcting the erroneous
conclusions drawn simply from observa
tion. The time will come when the sta
tistical method will enable governments
to avoid certain things and to adont oth
era, all of which will conduce to the. e-eti
eral welfare. . ,-. Ben "
But when, statistical offices become nar
tisan in their nature, adopt any particular
ideas of reform, become proDae-anrtiÂ«tÂ«
and aim to bolster up one party as against
another in its economic theories their
work will be criminal* and not scientific
A partisan cannot be a good statistician

partisan, and lay itself open 4egitimatelv

antagonize such position. It is onlv bv the
fearless publication of facts, without re
gard to the influence those facts may
have upon any party's position or any
partisan's view that the department can
justify its continued existence. : -
Education for the Masses.
It is now well understood- that the pop
ular education of. the masses in the ele
mentary facts of political and economic
science Is one of the greatest educational
ends of. the, day. and that departments
and bureaus of statistics and labor are
working emphatically, in the line of facili
tating this great work by their faithful
investigations into all the conditions
where facts should be known and into all
causes of bad conditions of whatever na

COMMISSIONER OF LABOR.
(COPYRIGHT, 1901.)
IX. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.
The Bureau of Labor was* established
by act of Congress approved June 27, 1884,
and was attached to the Department of
the. Interior. The head of th*e office was
designated the Commissioner of Labor,
the act providing that he "shall collect
information upon the subject of labor, its
relation to capital, the hours of labor and
the earnings of laboring men and women
and the means of promoting their mate
rial, social, intellectual and moral pros
perity."
The United States bureau was organ
ized in January, 1883, and the Commis
sioner on February 4 addressed a letter
to the Secretary of the Interior declaring
the policy of the bureau, stating:
It should be remembered that a bureau of
labor cannot solve industrial or social prob
lems, nor can it bring- direct returns In a ma
terial way to the citizens of the country, but
its work must be classed among educational
efforts, and by Judicious investigations and the
fearless publication thereof it may- and should
enable the people to comprehend more clearly
and more fully many of the problems wnicn
now vex them. , -
After three and a half . years of suc
cessful operation an act was passed (ap
proved June 13, 1888) providing for a de
partment of labor, the consequence of
which was practically to perpetuate the
work of the Bureau of Labor in the De
partment t of the Interior, but the name of
the office was changed and it was made-
Independent of any of the great depart
ments. The head of the department was
still designated the Commissioner of La
bor, and by the act he became officially
responsible to the President and to the
Congress, and not to a secretary in the
Cabinet.
Work of the Department of IÂ»abor.
Â¦ The work of the â¢ Commissioner.' of ' La
bor, whether at the head of the 'bureau
or of the department, has been contin
uous and consecutive, his reports being
numbered without reference to the form
of the organization, the first three ema
nating from the Bureau of Labor and the
others from the department. In all there
have been fifteen annual and nine special

Keports on th.e Condition of I*abor.
By the act of Congress approved March
2, 1895, the Commissioner is authorized to
publish a bulletin relating to the condi
tion of labor in this and other countries,
with condensations of State and foreign
labor reports, facts as to conditions or
employment and such other facts as may
be deemed of value to the industrial in
terests of the country. % By the act of July
1 " 1898, the Commissioner is authorized to
compile and publish annually, as part of
the bulletin of the Department of Labor,
an abstract of the main^features of the
official statistics of the cities of the United
States having over 30,000 population. In
accordance v.ith the act of March 2, 189a,
the first number of the bulletin was pub
lished in November of that year,, and it
has "been Issued every other month since,
containing usually from 120 to 150 pages.
The ma4n portions of the bulletin are the
results of original - Investigations; the
other parts contain condensations of State
and foreign labor reports, as provided by
law, the labor laws of the different States
of the United States as they are passed
and the decisions of the highest courts
in the country interpreting such labor
laws as have come before them.
' It will be seen fhat the acts creating
the bureau, and afterward the depart
ment of labor, are very broad. The Com
missioner can take up any question which,
relates to the material, social, intellectual
and moral prosperity of the people. It
has been considered that the department,
in acting under this broad authorization,
must confine itself to the collection and
publication of information; that it is not
the province of the head of the office to
make arguments for or against proposed
measures for promoting the material, so
cial Intellectual and moral prosperity of
'the people. In the early days of bureaus
of labor very many people considered that
the head of such offices should take up
this, th-at or the other proposed scheme,
remedy or alleged panacea as official busi
ness but that idea has been laid aside
almost entirely, the head of the United
States Department of Labor taking the
ground that if he took up one side of a
question and collected facts or material
relating to it, he was in duty bound to
take uo the other side of the same ques
tion- that officially he could not adopt the
ideas of any party or organization as the
basis of work, but that he fulfilled the
intention of the law when he faithfully
collected and published information bear
ing upon any of the great questions which
Congress or the public had- to consider,
leaving Congress and the public to draw
their own conclusions and make their own
deductions from the facts presented.
' 'Gathering Statistics of Labor.
*As a rule the department confines .itself
to the statistical methodâ that is, the col
lection of information on carefully pre
pared schedules of inquiry put* into the
hands of experts. This is the usual
method of collecting . information, but
there are questions which cannot be dealt
with by the statistical method, and yet
all the work. of the department- must be
the result of original inquiry' made in some
form. Rambling and nebulous observa
tions which would be likely, to result
from ah' investigation carried on by in
quiries not properly scheduled, 'are and
ought- to be avoided. The-: great advan
tages of the statistical method, carried on
through the means of properly prepared
schedules, hatfe been .demonstrated by
many years of practical experience in dif
ferent States and by the^ department it
self. With properly, instructed special
agents, who can secure exactly the in
formation required, and i who are on the
spot to make any explanation to parties
from whom data are sought, and who can
and must consult the. books jÂ£ account at
the establishments under " Wvestigatlon,
the best and most accurate information
can be secured, and in a- condition -for
tabulation..- * 'â¢â¢ Â¦ .'â¢Â¦â¢â¢Â¦
The department does not aim to secure
aggregates, except in rare casesâ that is,
it cannot count the people; it cannot col
lect the facts of all: the Â¦ manufacturing
establishments- in the country, nor-class
ify the occupation of Â¦â¢; all the people,'- nor

Kelly is a cousin of Mayor Phelan, and
this Is not regarded as a factor that
might militate against his appointment.
Kelly has just returned from a trip Hi
Europe, where he made a special study
of institutions for the care of the sick

Kelly may be appointed to succeed him
should he not be selected for the Aims

in a deputy sheriff or constable for the
particular county through which the train
happened to be running. The men . who

level-headed, and they have been chosen
on account of their iitness for the duty
devolving upon them.

Captain Seymour, the Brooks-Follls

are wroth at Marshal Chubbuck of Chico
and It is probable that . the Marshal may
find himself in serious trouble unless he
divests himself of the idea that to the
victor belongs the spoils.
Several months ago two safecrackers â
Charles Tessier and -William French â who
had been operating In this city and had
attempted to blow open tUe safes In the
offices of the Brooks-Follis Company and
the Pacific Tool Company, and. failing,
had stolen a number of valuable tools,
were arrested in Chlco for safecracking.

the two firms here were found in their

tence Captain Seymour has written sev
eral times to the Marshai for the return
of the stolen tools, which are valued at
$300. Â¦ ' V--V.
Marshal Chubbuck has studiously avoid
ed replying to these letters and finally thÂ«
Captain wrote to District Attornev J. D.

yesterday: >:- v

Captain John K. Seymour. San Francisco,
CaL â Dear Sir: I am In receipt of your sev
eral letters In regard to the kit of tools taken
by Marshal Chubbuck from French and Tes
sier. The Marshal has them in his possession,
and he seems to think that the tools belong
to French and Tessier. and. If so. he has as
good a right to them as anybody. "Of course,
this matter !a of no personal interest to me.
I have never advised Mr. Chubbuck as to wbat
to do with them. I have shown him your let
ters, but as you write, he does not seem - to
pay much attention to them. I know of no
way that the owners can recover them if ha
is not disposed to give them up. except by
an action in replevin, or to sue him for the
value of them. I don't think that he holds
them for their commercial value at all, but
belnp a young officer was rather proud of his
capture and successful conviction, and 'wants
to keep them more as trophies than anything:
else. Yours truly. . JO. IX SPROUI*

By the same reasoning. If a detective
captures a burglar with several diamond*
in his possession he . can claim them as
trophies of his capture.

a Bad Husband.
Fred Jjeidlin, a woodturner, was sen
tenced to six months in the County Jail
by Judge Mogan yesterday on the charge
of failure to provide for his minor chil
dren. Neldlin's wife lives at 865 Mission,
street and supports herself and youngest
child- by needlework. The two older boys
have been in the Youths' Directory. Mrs.
Neidlln testified that in Sacramento Neid
lin beat her and threatened to kill her
and was .held in $2000 bonds. He went to
Oregon and returned. On another occa
sion he was ordered to pay her $35 per
month alimony, but hÂ© again 'fled to Ore
gon.- Later he was arrested for failure to
provide and convicted by Judge Conlan.
He promised to pay for the children's sup
port, but again fled. He had threatened
to kill her and kidnap the children as
soon as he was at liberty.
Philbrook finally took the stand and
gave a detailed statement as to hi3 ac
quaintanceship and relations with Van R.
Paterson. A continuance until Monday
was then taken.
Philbrook occupied the morning session
reading the record of the disbarment pro
ceeding against him. At the opening of
the afternoon session Supreme* Court
Clerk George "YV. Root was called "to
prove that he had shown his prejudice
against Philbrook by placing the entry of
the disbarment proceeding among tho
criminal records." Judge Murasky held
that the matter was immaterial and Root
left the stand. Robert Y. Hayne, T. E.
Harris and "William H. MHI3 were called,
but could throw no light upon nor furnish
any proof in support of Philbrook's con
spiracy charge.
The trial of the action Instituted by
Horace TV. Philbrook against Van R. Pat

AS an attraction the Industrial Arts
Exposition in the art. gallery of
the Mechanics' Pavilion is grow
ing in favor; as a financial ven-
- "yture it is proving a' great suc
cess, and as a source of entertainment
it is equaling in value its worth as a proof
of the versatility of Californian talent and
ingenuity.
There is more to look at along the walls
than can be seen In a full day, and most
of the visitors are taking their time to
inspect thoroughly everything there is on
exhibition, but every afternoon and every
evening the programmes change,* and
there is as much Native talent shown in
them as there is represented in the art
objects on show. Each day is under the
especial charge of some member of the
California Cluo, who is responsible for the
care r.nd entertainment of the day's visit
ors. Yesterday Mrs. W. S. Leake was in
charge; to-day Mrs. Arthur W. Cornwall
will direct the proceedings. â¢."Â¦
.Yesterday alternoon the .: programme
contained three numbers of more than
usual interest, end all the more valuable
from being practically impromptu. Three
choruses of school children sang and gave
an exhibition of how music is being taught
In the classrooms. The children were of
all ages, but (hey, sang with a freedom
and certainty that would teach self-pos
session to many of their ciders..
The first exhibition was by the children
of the fourth grades of the Moulder
School. The tchool Is on the corner of
Page and Gough streets, and the children
were marched from their classrooms to
the Pavilion and on to the stage with no
more preparation than time to put on
their hats. They were directed by Miss
Estelle Carpenter, supervising Instructor
of music in the city school department.
They were Very small but very bright, and
their childish voices, blending sweetly in
songs that everybody knew, touched the

Band of Mercy.
Twenty members of the Band of Mercy
from the Humboldt and the Adams
schools, under the leadership of Miss
Katherine Black, Miss Carpenter's assist
ant, sang the second chorus, some verses
set to the music of "Home, Sweet Home."
They .wore the costume of the band, a
white loose dress hanging straight from
the shoulders, with a scarlet collar and
loose flowing sleeves of white with wide
scarlet cuffs, and each wore a bow of
scarlet or of white ribbon in her hair.
They came in singing a march to the
chorus .of . "John Brown," and when they
ranged themselves in order upon the plat
form they made as dainty a picture as the
whole exhibition afforded.
The last chorus was given by the eighth
grade of the Clement Grammar School,
taught by Miss Kate Mandeville and Miss
F. R. Lewis. The children were' older
and sang .as if their work were play. The
choruses were a most pleasing feature of
the afternoon. They were a true exhibi
tion of the practical - work of "the school
room, for the children had had no time to
prepare anything special. ThÂ« system of
tone formation was shown, and to the
gestures of their leaders the children ran
runs and trilled trills and sang chords
and harmonies until every one was de
lighted. It was music of a kind that the
old art gallery of the Pavilion was unused
to, nor has it heard any that was much
more pleasant. The children were all in
vited to remain after their numbers, an
invitation of waich they willingly availed
themselves.

Large Evening Attendance. .
The attendance in the evening- was large
and Interest in all portions of the exhibit
was manifest. The musical programme
was of such uniform excellence that the
attention of a larger part of those present
was claimed by it to such a degree that
during the rendition of the numbers the
exhibits suffered general neglect. # -

attractive by the appearance of the Treble
Clef Club, which sang two double num

The British ship Ardnainurchen has been
heard from. Of all the overdue fleet sho
is the one that ha* kept the underwriters
and gamblers on the tenter hooks. OnÂ«
day the^ rate of reinsurance would reach
Co per cent and then all of a sudden it
would tumble to 30 oer cent. At the latter
figure the g-amblers would not do business
and then day by day the rate would creep
up until 65 per cent <vas again reached.
This happened twice and then on the 4th
Inst. the rate again went down to 40 X>er
cent. Thursday It had reached 60 per
cent again and yesterday morning the
r.ows came that the tr.uch Insured vessel
had been epoken off tbo English coast on
the 10th Inst.
The Ardnamurchen left the Fraser
River, British Columbia, on November 26
last for Liverpool with Â«3,578 cases of sal
mon. Boon after leaving Pueet Sound a
fierce storm came up in which several ves
eels were lost. A quantity of salmon and
wreckage came asho.e on the Oregon
coast and some of the canned goods were
said to have been part cf the Ardnamur
chen's carco. 6teved-Â»res who helped to
load the vessel were positive that the stuff
that was washed ashore had been stowed
in the lower hold of the ship and that,
therefore, she must bs Â» total wreck.
The storm In which the Ardnamurchen
â¢was supposed to have been caught was
central off the Columbia River. The Brit
ish ship Andrada was caught in it and
driven off shore. A Columbia River pilot
was aboard, but neither ship nor pilot
have ever been heard from since. Many
people supposed that the Andrada and
Ardnamurchen had been in collision and
that both vessels had pone to the bottom.
All surmises have proved to be false,
however, and the Ardnamurchen probably
is rjow safe at Liveroool.
The British chip Fiery Cross, which left
Victoria, B. C. on November 3, arrived at
London last Wednesday and she it was
probably that .spoke the Ardnamurchen.

Courts. Probably "Will Be Called Upon
to Determine the Status of
$208,500 Collected From
, Taxpayers.
A petition was filed with the Board .of
Supervisors yesterday by A. S.Llllle and
Gteorge W. Hughes asking for the jeturn
of the tax levied last June for the.ial^rest
and j sinking fund accounts ' of theflTOQds
which were to have been issued for park,
school, sewer and hospital purposes;. but
since declared unconstitutional by- the Su
preme Court. The individual amounts -of
taxes paid by the petitioners are not large:
but the total amount involved is $208,500;
which it Is claimed should . never ; .have
been levied until the validity of thebbiid
issues had been established. A similar
petition was filed with the Tax Collector,
and if the Board of Supervisors fail -to
take action the matter will be pressed -to
an Issue in the courts..
Auditor Wells has all along contended
that the levy for the interest and sinking
fund on the bonds should be' transferred
to the surplus fund; â¢which would be In
creased thereby to $468,500. This sum the
Auditor claims must be used to pay off
the city's old indebtedness and the bal
ance reapportioned among the various
funds of the'next fiscal year. How far
correct this interpretation of the Â¦ charter
is will 1 only. be determined by a court de
cision. The petition for the return of the
taxes follows: . .;, .... â¢ ', A
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of
the City' and County of San Francisco â Gen
tlemen: We. hereby petition the refunding of
the tax illegally levied for park, school,' sewer
end hospital bonds paid by us under protest
to the Tax Collector on all property owned by
us In the city and county of San Francisco,
said bonds being declared illegal by the Su
preme Court of the State. Respectfully,
A. S. LILtilE, 1247 Sanchez street.

GROWING CHILDREN.
The Period When the Nervous Activ-
ity Is at Its Greatest.
The Home Doctor.
"Against the practice of giving tea and
coffee to children we cannot speak too
strongly. Childhood is the period when
the nervous activity is at its greatest. The
brain is ever busy receiving new impres-
Piors. Reflex action, co-ordination of
muscles and the special senses are all un-
der a special course of training.
"The nervous system is pushed to its
utmost capacity, and long Is the list of
victims that follow its overstimulation.
In these little people nothing but harm
can comÂ© from the use of such cerebral
stimulants as tea or coffee. Bad, then, as
this practice Is, let us as physicians be ag-
gressive in Its prohibition.
"Do not be satisfied by answering 'No'
Â¦when a*kcd as to Its use, but let, us teach
the families with whom we come In con-
tact that such practice is evil. We .speak
emphatically, because not only among the
poor and uneducated but among the rich,
who should know better, this practice is
xnarvelcusly prevalent."
Children like a warm beverage for
breakfast, and it Is well for them, to have
It If the drink is a food and not a drug. : ;> .
Pcstum Food Coffee is made to supply
a rich, nourishing liquid food ivlth a crisp
coffee taste for those who cannot, and
should not use coffee. Analysis shows it
to contain about 14 per cent of muscle-
formiKg elements and 66.11 per cent of
energy and fat producing elements, which
go to nourish and sustain the delicate
nerve centers throughout the body and
from \rhlch the vital energy proceeds.
The 6upreme Importance of proper food
in place of drugs is not generally under-
stood, but the success of child or adult
depends largely upon proper sustenance
for the body. Children who depend upon
the Intelligence of their elders to furnish
them with 'good food deserve our. most
careful attention and thought- upon- this
subject. . . - .

A Noted Boston Woman Describes
â¢ its Symptoms and Terrors.â Two
Severe Cases Cured by Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
"I am so nervous! no one ever suffered as I do! There
. isn't a well inch in; my body. I honestly believe .my lungs
are diseased, my chest pains me so, but I have no cough. I
am<-so "weak at my stomach, and have indigestion terribly, and
palpitation of the heart ; am losing flesh; and this headache
and backache nearly kills me, and yesterday I had hysterics.
" There is a weight in the lower part of my bowels, bearing
down all the time, with pains in my groins and thighs- â I
can't sleep, walk, or sit, and blue â oh goodness ! I am simply
the most miserable of women."
This is a most vivid description of a woman suffering with
nervous prostration, caused by inflammation or some other
diseased condition of the womb. .
No woman should allow herself to reach such a perfection
of misery when there is no need" of it. Read about Miss
Williamson's case and how. she was cured.

Chicago Grain Market

. CHICAGO, ' April . 12.â The most influential
factor in the wheat market early was the heavy
export business as revealed by Immense clear
ances from the seaboard,', which in wheat and
flour amounted to 1,281,000 ' bushels. Of this
915.000 bushels. represented the raw product. A

rallied during the forenoon to 71%@72c. Outside
support, however, failed when longs attempted
to - take profits. Â¦ Long I wheat .was offered â¢ be
cause of the lightness of the day's export
business and reports minimizing accounts of In-
Jury from Insects. Aside from a narrow scalp

Considerable irregularity has prevailed in
speculation this week. The market, continues
to be very active and presents the same strong
undertone which has been a leading feature
for- some weeks past. New high price records*
have been made in various stocks and the
deals and developments concerning , corpora
tions which are understood to be in progress
have not lost their power as incitements to
bullish activity. The money market, however,
has developed a degree of- strength which,
though by no means i approaching anything
like positive stringency, gave a sharp check
to the. upward movement -of prices and caused
recessions, with a renewal of more conserva
tive opinions among the rank and file of Wall
street. Last Saturday's unfavorable bank
statement, which appeared when the â¢ market
was taking a three days' holiday, was widely
discussed and was generally construed as in
dicating that easy money could not be counted
on any longer, and when' Jhe Stock Exchange
reopened on Monday, there % was a very -heavy
selling movement, representing both liquida
tion of long - holdings and short sales by
traders. ' The call money rate on Monday ad
vsneed to 6 per cent and most borrowers were
ibliged to pay 5 per cent for such accommoda
tion, that rate being generally maintained for
the rest of the week. The money quotations
again Â¦ touched 6 ' per cent on Thursday and
Friday which produced sharp declines In the
various stocta which . had. renewed thÂ«ir ad
vancing tendency as soon as it was apparent
that no stringency was probable. ;
NEW YORK, April 12.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial -Review to-morrow will say:
Bradstreet's Financial Revieiv.
NEW YORK. April 12.â To-day's stock mar
ket was rather a tame affair as compared with
the excited dealings fcr some time past, but
an imposing aggregate of business was never
theless transacted and there were considerable
fluctuations in prices. The market was ex
tremely irregular, all recovering sharply from
the opening depression, but yielding again be
fore the close, which was heavy in tone and
decidedly below the best, but with consider
able gains remaining fcr many important
stocks. Operations were of a highly manipula
tive character and seemed to have for their
object to discourage the selling of stocks. No
very aggressive efforts were apparent to at
tract renewed buying demand. Fluctuations
Â¦were by no means bo violent or so feverish as
has: been the rue of late. There were some
wide advances among high-priced Investment
etocks and some usually inactive stocks, North
west, after a preliminary decline, rising four
points; St. Paul preferred 2^4; General Elec
tric. 3; Consolidated Gas, 6^; Brooklyn Union
Gas, 9, and a number of less prominent stocks
from 2 to 3>i. Speculation continued active in
the copper stocks and Amalgamated Copper
rallied strongly from its opening loss, but did
not hold the advance well, closing with a net
rise of only 1%. Rumors continued conflicting
regarding the status of the Burlington deal.
The stock's extreme range was 3% and it closed
v.ith & net gain of a point. Rock Island ros<
fl1 * from last night's price and closed with a
net gain of *H- The New York public utili
ties were all strong, apparently on account of
the fixing of the date of adjournment by the
Legislature. The coalers also became strong
giving rise to a Fuppositlon that the danger of
a strike on the New Jersey Central had been
averted. The market developed very general
strength after the opening weakness, which
was due in some extent to selling for London
account, the denials of peace negotiations with
the Boers and the hardening of the money
rate in London serving to depress that market
The recovery here seemed to be closely con
nected with the more cheerful feeling regarding
th* money outloik. This was not reflected in
the money rate itf*lf until most of the day's
requirements had been met when belated lend
ers made considerable concessions in the rate
of Interest. It wts asserted that large loans
were placed here for the account of Chicago
tanks during the day. The preliminary esti
mates of the interior cash movement Indicated
that the balance against New York for the
week was Insignificant and the New York ex
charge at Chicago rose to 25c per tliousand,
compared with 50c yesterday. The sub-treas
ury was a debtor to-<lay at the clearing hous*
to the extent of 51.4S6.74l, owing to large pen
sion disbursements and a payment of ioOO.OOO
made to the banks on account or Philippine
anr.y expenditures. The sub-treasury ha<s
therefore taken -cnly about $1,000,000 from the
market for the week and next week will see
the high level for the month of the pension pay
ments. After the close of business on the stock
exchanpe. announcement was made from Wash
ington that the Secretary of the Treasury had
purchased $1,000,000 of Government bonds In
this market. This, with the calling of loans
by the banks, if it has resulted in the reduc
tion of The loan averages, will therefore have
the effeot of making & much less unfavorable
benk statement than was apprehended. With
to-dny'E payment in London of the Installment
on the exchequer bonds and the conclusion of
the stock exchange settlement there, the cours.
of the money market In the next few days is
awaited to indicate its true condition.
The ' heaviness of the United States stfrfl
Etocks was a disappointment to the speculators,
as they are basing hopes of measures of pro
tection against money stringency by large
financial Interests en the supposition that it is
tlecigjieA to Â«upyort the prices of these stocks.
The price moveiiicnt of Iionds was Irregular.
Iota! sales, par value. 52.955.000. United States

i NEW YORK. April 12.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade will say:. The tone, of gen
eral business has been better, this week/ Mark
ed activity In the distribution of merchandise
is reflected in the gains of 45.9 per cent in
bank â¢ clearings at/New York, compared with
1900, and 20.8 per cent over 1899, v with gains
of 13.5 and 10.8 for the same period at lead
ing cities' outside of New York. Even the
textile markets show pronounced gain. 'Activ
ity in the | metal division has . taken pigiron
production . to near record figures and some
dealers â¢ do not see . how production of partly
finished forms this year Is to be made to meet
the demand. The Government report of the
condition of wheat , on April 1 is the surest
possible basis upon which expectation of con
tinued commercial prosperity could be founded.
Stringency of money Is largely local in New
York and does not alter reports from most of
the larger Â¦ cities of favorable conditions In
collections. Railroad earnings in March were
7.4 per cent larger â¢ than last year and' 32.4
per cent over 1899, according to practically
complete returns. Pigiron production on April
1, according to the Iron Age, was at the rate
of .296,676 tons weekly.^ This quantity has been
exceeded twice In the history of the Indus
try, on December 1. 1899, when 296,959 tons
were produced, < and oh February 1, 1900, when
the .output was 298,014 . tons. The remarkable
feature of the situation Is the decrease of
69,558 tons. in furnace stocks/during March In
the face of this enormous production, while
In six months .the .loss.. In. supplies . amounted
to "203,656 tons. Quotations are generally
steady for all forms except plates, on which
$2 a ton more Is Â¦ demanded with restricting
purchases. . Contracts for delivery of. plglron
do not as a rule ..extend beyond 1 this month
and furnace stocks cannot.be expected to con
tinue decreasing .unless, new business' comes
forward, for-.many -furnaces have gone Into
blast since the month opened/ and production
on May 1 1 ,will probably . be â¢ at., a new,- high
record. '.-Â¦'Â¦ ...... - . Â¦. â¢â¢ -. â¢ -

.Crops and trade advices alike continue favor
able. The seat of greatest ' strength is In : the
Iron and steel trade, while textiles evidence
the most irregularity. ! . Despite [ the ' unques
tionably quieter tone of export trade in manu
factures, it is to be noted that Americans are
Etlll" reaping some advantages from their supe
riority in certain lines of iron and steel. Retail
trade has been -helped, by ' better, weather " ( in
most sections, and ; while '. spring : Jobbing ' ; is
Emaller at several markets, . improved retail
trade conditions are- expected to help re-order
business. â¢ The low price of - cotton is still â¢ a
determent to trade at 'â¢ the â¢ South, and talk of
restriction of the anticipated Increase of acre
age is heard. Planting Is, however,, being,ac
tively pushed and retail trade is for this reason
still quieter. Â¦ Northwestern trade advices ; are
quite cheerful and large numbers of buyers are
in the towns. . On the : Pacific > Coast, â¢ Alaskan

CLOSING.
Business slackened ' on the stock exchange
here to-day and the tone depressed because of
the. lack of confirmation- of. the report that a
settlement was to be had with Botha ' of the
South African troubles. The American depart
ment also was restricted for a while in sym
pathy with the general market; but besides this
general cause, the bulls were nervous to-da/
over the drop in prices in New York yesterday
and the fears of dearer money in Wall street.
They sold steadily until In the afternoon/when
upon the New York opening the cables brought
over unexpectedly higher prices and orderr
which hoisted Union Pacific. Southern Pacific
and Northern Pacific. Berlin also was a buyer
of Northern Pacifies. ' Upon these two bull
movements London took courage, buying Eries
and Atchlsons. The i result was a cheerful
close, with prices at the top. Several attempts
have been made to Interview Mr.' Morgan.
They have all proved practically futile.

Mrs. Lizzie Treest, who. as Miss Lizzie
Donovan was Jrawn into the family trou
bles of the McKetchnies, believes that she
is the victim of fortune tellers. It v Is al
leged in a suit for divorce just filed by
Captain McKetchnie . that the charges
against her are false.
Mrs. Treest has lived for many years In
the neighborhood where she now resides,
and feels keenly the publicity which has
been elven Mrs. McKetchnie's charges.
S.he said: Â¦
"I can only explain Mrs. McKetchnie's
malicious attacks upon me on the theory
thÂ«t her constant association with for
tune tellers has driven her insane. Ever
since one of these fakers told her. about
three years a?o, ; as I am credibly in
formed, 'Beware of the light complex
loned girl in the white house." she has
followed me with the vilest slanders. T
have heretofore paid little heed to her, as
in the neighborhood here she and I are
both too well known to allow her words
against me to have. any weight.
"On one occasion, when she went so far
as to strike me on the public street. T had
her arrested for battery and she was con
victed. Lately I have found out that she
carries a hatchet under her shawl when
ever she goes out, so that I have become
very much afraid of her.
"The woman has been consorting with
these uncanny fortune tellers, and she
has just gone crazy. I am satisfied that
they have put her up to her attacks upon
me. as she has never had the slightest
show of proof of any wrong 1 on my part.
I suppose that the reason I was selected
as a mark for their plots was the fact
that I used to go back and forth across
the bay morning and night, often travel
ing on Captain McKetchnie's boat.
"The neighbors tell me that one of these
fortune tellers visits Mrs. McKetchnie
continually. They tell me that he i* a
smooth-looking young man, and he seems
to have her completely under his con
trol." â¢ â¢ ' ' :

As to its cheapness. C. C. Splnks, who
is using the oil in the bunk and cook
houses at the Caribou wells, says that a
barrel of oil is yet to be consumed in the
bunk i house, where a flre has been used
every nisrht for "months for heating pur
poses. Eighty cents per barrel is about
the retail price of the crude product,
which makes It by far the cheapest, hand
iest and probably best of fuel for domestic
use. ->.
MOURN AT THE GRAVE
OF JOHN F. XIDDER
HANFORD. April 12,â Oil In crude form
has been used on the "West Side for fuel
since last fall and Is proving a great suc
cess. The cook stoves are entirely with
out expensive burners. All that is re
quired is a plate over the lower grato to
prevent the oil running through. A quar
ter-inch pipe is used as a conductor of lhÂ«
oil to the stove. This runs Into the fire
box over the place where the fire la want
ed. The end of the pipÂ© is flattened out
to distribute the oil more evenly, and a
stopcock is used to turn on and shut off
the oil supply. 'Â¦.Â¦"'.:
As soon as it is necessary to light the
stove the oil is turned on for an instant,
and a small piece of paper serves an a
starter. The oil Â¦ begins to burn imme
diately, and as soon as the stove Is some
what heated, the oil burns with a clear
blaze, .leaving little or no residue, and
making no smoke.

Committee Is Appointed to
Frame Plan for Strong
Organization..
Large Representation of Producers st
Conference Considered More Im
portant Than Any Yet
Held.
The most Important meeting of the oil
producers of California ever held took
place last evening at the Palace "Hotel.
Every large producing company north of
Tehachapl with the exception of the Reed
Crude Oil Company and the Peerless Oil
Company was represented and the absent
ones sent regrets.
Steps to form a "strong organization . to
include all the producing companies were
taken and a committee was. appointed to
meet this morning at Henry Ach's office
In the Mills building to rrame 'a plan of
permanent organization. This committee
consists of one representative of each of
the following companies: Producers,
Kern Oil. Kern River. San Joaquin, Monte
Cristo. Peerless, ReÂ«d Crude, Globe, Ster
ling, Alma, Petroleum Development, Cali
fornia Standard, Four Oil and Revenue.
Henry Ach. president of the Monte
' Cristo Company, who sent out the invita
tions for the meeting, presided, Charles
Musaus was the secretary. There was a
long discussion in which Henry Ach said
the opinion that the competition of the oil
producers against one another was prin
cipally responsible f or the low price of oil
was general. Ach said the production was
largely overstated and this led to a wrong
impression concerning the amount of fuel
oil available. There was no opposition, he
said, to the formation of -a strong and
permanent organization. Â¦ .
The meeting of the committee to-day
will be of great Importance. After the
plan of organization has been agreed upon
there will be another meeting of the com
panies, all of which have offices in this
city. It is 'hoped to steady the price of
oil and to regulate the . market so the
price shall be more satisfactory than it
has been lately. This is one of the lead
ing incentives to concerted action.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 12.
Hunt Bros.' big fruit canning plant at
Haywards was wiped out by flre this
morning, which swept the two acres of
wooden buildings to tp& ground. Besides
the- immense cannery proper a new can
making factory was destroyed, with all of
its valuable machinery and $70,000 worth
of tinplate stored for the opening of work
on May 1. Eighty-five small three-room
cottages owned by the company were
burned, ten of which were already occu
pied by families awaiting the beginning
of'the canning season. Six Southern Pa
cific boxcars on a siding near the works
were consumed. The Southern Pacific de
pot was scorched, as were Stone's grocery
and C. K_ Nissen's box factory, across
the tracks from the burned cannery. The
loss is $140,000 and insurance $20,000 less.
The cannery cannot be rebuilt in time to
handle much if any of this year's fruit in
Eden Township. The destruction of the
works throws the orchardists into a bad
plight, for :\hoy have during the past six
years sold be bulk of their product to
Hunt Bros. '-W 'âÂ¦â¢';
J. H. Hunt, the surviving owner of the
cannery, is now in the East. His resident
superintendent, Charles C. Van Eaton,
and Secretary Clarence Cook say they are
unable at this time to tell what will be
done about rebuilding.
The cause of the fire is unexplained. At
9 o'clock last night two mechanics who
had been working in the new can-making
building left the place and locked all the
doors. Four hours later flre broke out in
the east end of the structure, which was
In the center of a group of large wooden
buildings. The cannery site is along the
Southern Pacific tracks, a mile distant
from the towu proper. There was not a
drop of water available. A six-inch main
had been laid from the town water works
to the cannery, but no connections had
been made. The volunteer firemen hauled
their apparatus to the scene aa soon as
the alarm had been given, but all they
could do was to save the little furniture
in the cottages on the grounds. '
The flames had full swing, and hundreds
of townspeople were compelled to stand
helplessly about the flre unable to turn a
hand toward saving the big plant, because
some one had been tardy in providing pro
tection. The nearest hydrant was 3000 feet
away, and- there was no water in the use
less main. r '',-^r--::-
Big Plant in Ruins.
The big plant was in Tulns by 5 o'clock
this morning, and at daylight all that was
left was a mas of blackened corrugated
iron roofing, tin and machjnery. The smol
deringiembers were smoking all day, evi
dence only of the complete destruction of
the works. . â¢
The disaster was particularly severe In
that the company had everything in read
iness for a big year and had made large
and expensive additions to its already ex
tensive property in anticipation of a heavy
season's output. Two days ago the big
consignment of tlnplate was put in the
works, and $50,000 worth of machinery for
can-making had just been installed. The
Hunt Bros.' concern had not been in the
cannery syndicate and had .prepared to
make its own cans this year. There were
also about 70,000 empty cans, which were
destroyed. There was $10,000 worth of
canned fruit in the warehouses. The re
mainder of the loss is in the burning of
the many other buildings â the cooking,
syrup" and fruit cutting departments, the
box factory an I storage rooms, the board
ing-houses and the cottages.. The latter
were small and were of little value.
Among those who occupied the. cottages
within and without. the works were H. W.
Klee, Mrs. Lummis, T. Tichner, Peter
Connor, C. Zerner, William Arnold. Mrs.
Jose. M. Daken, Joseph Sllva, M. Garcia,
J. Figuera, A. Silveria, M. Cottle. W.
"Walker, O. Owens, James Smith, Archie
McCartney and W. Ross.
Many People Affected.
The occupants had plenty of time to get
out of danger and to- save some of .their
small possessions. Those who were ren
dered homeless were taken in hand by the
townspeople and will receive care and at
tention. â¢
The cry of incendiarism was raised as
an explanation for the fire, but Superin
tendent Van Eaton was not ready to clear
the mystery in that way. He was particu
larly bitter because of the lack of water.
For several years Mr. Hunt had tried to
induce the Town Trustees to compel the
San Lorenzo Water Company to run Its
mains out to the cannery. Recently the
company started to comply with -the re
quest and a main was laid to within 100
feet of the works. But no hydrant con
nections were put in. leaving the uncon
nected main as useless as if not an inch
of pipe were laid. The superintendent
claims that had there been the ordinary
pressure of water in the pipes the flre
could have been checked at the brick fire
wall which separated the can-making
plant from the cannery building.
He declares he requested the water com
pany to turn in a stream and let it run
into the open trenches, so that a bucket
brigade could have made an attempt to
check the flre. .
The glare of the flames aroused people
at San Leandro. six. miles distant, and an
alarm was given there which called out
the firemen. Â¦
The company had expected to employ
from 1500 to 1800 people this season. There
is a bare possibility that the cannery can
be sufficiently rebuilt. to handle cherries,
the season for which will open about June
15 But until President Hunt, who is now
in" Chicago, shall return a definite state
men* concerning the future will not I be
given cut. Â¦ * ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ * Â¦
The Eden Township fruit growers will
have to rely on the San Leandro cannery
and en San Jose canneries and driers to
handle their product unless the works can
be rebuilt In time to take part of this
year's crop. The hundreds of poor families
who depend for employment during the
season at the canpery will suffer serious
ly through the destruction of the plant.

BANNING GETS
THE POSITION
Receives the- Appointment
as First Assistant Dis
trict Attorney.
Young T>. B. McKinley, the Presi
diat's Cousin, May Be Selected
to Fill Vacancy Created by
the Promotion.
Second Assistant United States District
Attorney E. J. Banning received a tele
gram from "Washington yesterday after
noon announcing that he had been ap
pointed first assistant to fill the vacancy
caused by the promotion of Marshall B.
Woodworth to the District Attorneyship.
The appointment was made by Attorney
General Knox.
The promotion of Mr. Banning leaves
the way clear for the appointment of L.
B. McKinley. a first cousin of the Presi
dent, as second assistant. Mr. McKinley
is a son of Benjamin F. McKinley, uncle
of the President, occupying the position
of Assistant Posjtmaster in this city. He
is the President's choice. Duncan E. Mc-
JCinlay of Santa Rosa was said to be the
choice of Senators Perkins and Bard for
the place secured by Mr. Banning.
The new appointee received his legal ed
ucation in this city and has been acting
as second assistant in the United States
Attorney's office for the past two years. â¢
After a long contest Marshall B. Wood
worth was appointed Untted States At
torney. .Northern District of- California,
to succeed Frank L. Coombs, who re
signed after election to Congress. Imme
diately after Mr.- Woodworth was appoint
ed an open fight'began lor the position of
first assistant in the attorney's office.
Edward J. Banning:, who terved as secorrl
assistant under Mr. Coombs, rallied his
friends to sustain him in an effort to ob
tain the first place under Mr. Woodworth.
One of his uncles in Ohio enjoys the
friendship and confidence of Judge Day
and the Judge happens to be next' to the
Attorney General and pretty close up to
the President. The pull in this direction
made it obvious to the California Sena
tors that Banning was ir. the field with
prospects of winning out.
Senators Perkins and .bard favored that
the first position in the office, the one
that Mr. Banning was seeking, should be
awarded to D. E. McKinlay, campaign
orator and eloquent exponent of protec
tion to all of our Industries. Moreover,
the Senators contended that they had the
right to bestow the patronage and place
it where it would do tbe countrv In gen
eral and the Republican party in particu
lar the most good. Ifce contest proceeded
with considerable vigor on both sides. All
the kinsfolk of Banning, Lynch and Day
in Ohio were lined up on one side and the
Senators f rom W^allf orrua. on the other.
It was the Impression at the beginning
of the contest that the losinsr candidate
for the first place would get the secon-i
place without opposition, but another sur
prise, however, comes to D. E. McKInlay
in the report that young Ben McKinlcy,
who was an aspirant for legislative nom
ination last fall, is slated for second place
under Mr. Woodworth and that nothing: is
left for D. E. but the prospect of going
into the field and hslping the party win
another victor.".

had been made by a committee, Â¦ reciting
the work that has been done to get the

lutions were headed with a- preamble, in
which it was set forth that the people of
the State of California have, .by their
votes, expressed a .willingness to pay and
have provided a law by. which; the Board
of Supervisors of San Francisco may pay,

a movement on the part of the Supervisors
to arrange for the, payment of only one
half of the claims, etc.- Therefore it was
resolved as follows:
That we, the merchant creditors of the -city,
!n meeting assembled, recognize that the time
has arrived when our claims can be * legally
paid, and, having waited nine years patiently
for : such a' condition to Â» exist, do hereby

Another fruitless session of the Grand
Jury was held yesterday afternoon in a
lengthy discussion over the intricacies of
the Sullivan case. One of the peculiar
features of the case that Is so puzzling
to the jurors Is that District Attorney
Byington is perfgrce acting in a dual ca
pacity. He is the public prosecutor and
as such Is obliged to prepare indictments
against all offenders.
In the Sullivan case the additional du
ties imposed upon his office by the char
ter make him appear as defending: the
acts of his subordinates. It was In the
bond and warrant clerk's office whence
the scandal emanated. With the excep
tion of Sullivan, all the attaches are ap
pointees of Byington. So the Grand Jury
sought enlightenment from the presiding
Judge of the Superior Court, Frank H.
Dunne. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ ' _ Â¦ .
It was originally planned that the Grand
Jury should go into Judge Dunne's court
and seek his advice. But Judge Dunne
wanted a little heart-to-heart talk with
the jurors, and armed with a marked
copy of the Penal Code entered their
meeting room. He first told the jurors
they talked too much and then told them
the law would not permit any one,
except the District Attorney or his as
sistants, to participate in the hearing of
a case. Judge Dunne emerged from the
room well satisfied that his words would
be heeded. - â¢ '
The Grand Jurors discussed the matter
for a short time and then took up the

consideration of a coudIÂ© of old and oft
tried cases of minor. Importance. No wit
nesses were called in the Sullivan case.
James H. Kelly, a disappointed aspirant
for a soft snap as plumbing inspector un

munication , alleging gross - frauds on the
part of the Civil Service Commissioners

fired. In his excitement, and not know
ing if he had injured Trewhella, Glaze
started to " reload his weapon. Then he
was met by Mr. Porter and went with
him to the office. There he gave his pis
tdl and cartridges to his stepson and went
out of the hotel to give himself up to the
police- We will prove all this and ask
an acquittal at your hands, gentlemen of
the. jury." . ' "
The first witness called by the defense
was Christopher Merchant. He testified
that he was a butcher and had supplied
the "Windsor Hotel with meat. The wit
ness said that on the day of the shooting
he had talked with O'Connor, the bellboy,
who had denied witnessing the shooting.
The witness testified that last year he
had conversed with Trewhella about
Glaze, but that he had not told Glaze
what Trewhella had said.
The expected evidence of Merchant that
Trewhella . had made threats against
Glaze was not forthcoming, and Attorney
FootÂ© tried to impeach his own witness
by his evidence in the Police Court. Mer
chant was emphatic in his statements
that he had not repeated to Glaze any
conversation held by witness with Trew
hella. Witness then detailed the conver
sations held with Trewhella. â¢ They con
sisted of complaints as to the manner in
which Glaze was carrying on the business
and Trewhella's determination to sell out ,
his Interest. No mention was made by
Merchant as to any threats made by
Trewhella against Glaze.
. In cross-examination by the prosecu
tion Merchant stated that Trewhella al
ways spoke in a calm way about Glaze.
"He was i a man of few words," said
Merchant, "and told me the business was
all right,- but that he did not like Glaze's
way of doing things. He said that he did
not suit Glaze and that Glaze did not suit
him, and -in- order to avoid trouble he
would sell out his interesfin the hotel."
H. H. McAllister, formerly employed at
the Windsor Hotel, was then called to
the witness stand by the defense. Mc-
Allister testified that a dispute had ex
isted between â¢ Glaze and Trewhella over
the cancellation of a bill for $50 by Glaze
for Janes, his former partner.
'Glaze said that it was a custom not to
charge hotel men for their board," said
McAllister, "but Trewhella said that he
had bought out Janes and that Janes was
no longer in.the hotel business and should
pay his bills -like any other guest."
In cross-examination witness stated
that Trewhella was decided in his state
ments, but was not angry.
"Trewhella said to me," stated McAl
lister, "that he would have felt better if
Glaze had consulted him about the bill of
Jane*. This matter took place in May,
1900." -Â¦ Â¦ - - Â¦ Â¦. ;
R. H. Porter, formerly a bellboy at the
Windsor Hotel, testified that on the day
of the shooting he was in the bar: of the
hotel. : . -
"When I heard the shots fired," said
Porter, "I ran down the steps to the
court. I saw O'Connor near the kitchen
door. He was running toward the office.
Several times that day he told me that he
did not see the shooting. I saw Glaze in
side the kitchen with a pistol in his hand.
I took hold of him and escorted him to
the office. We stopped for an instant
where Trewhella's body was lying. When
we got to the â¢ office Glaze gave his re
volver and ! cartridges to his stepson.
.Shelly, and then we went out and he gave
himself up to an officer."
In cross-examination Porter stated that
he saw O'Connor standing in the door
way of the kitchen, within a foot of
where Trewhelle. lay dying. "Deal, a
boarder, followed me to the kitchen," said
Porter, "and asked the bellboy what the
trouble was. O'Connor replied. 'That
darned fool Glaze has shot Trewhella.'
When we went in the office Glaze started
to go upstairs. Then he came back, and
his stepson, Shelly, told him that he had
better give himself up to the police. Glaze
was excited and several times said, 'He
threatened me.' "
Mr. Bylngtonâ Did not Glaze say to you,
"For God's sake, Porter, don't go back on
me?" (
The witnessâ Yes, he said so.
At the afternoon session Frank L. Seav
ler was called by the defense. He testi
fied that he was repairing the bells in the
elevator on January 14, and had a con
versation with Glaze between 1 and 2 p. m.
Shortly afterward the witness heard
sounds .of firing and ran into the court
yard. He saw Trewhella lying wounded
en the ground and went for a doctor.
\On cross-examination witness stated
that he saw the bellboy O'Connor in the
courtyard immediately after he (the wit
ness) had eone there, after, hearing the
sounds of shots. .
. Leo Aron, a thin old man, who said that
his â¢ business was that of a painter and
decorator, was r>ut on the witness stand
by the defense. Aron testified that I he
lived at 2188 Sutter street, and that he
had done considerable work for Glaze at
the Windsor Hotel. The witness said that
last year Glaze had send for him to re
paper some rooms and had Introduced him
to his partner. , . "
"I don't know his name," said Aron
"but it was Glaze's partner, the man who
was killed. His partner showed me the
rooms^I was to fix up. When I finished
my job, Glaze asked me for my bilL The
work for the rooms amounted to $18 and
there was a' balance of an old account.
Glaze'paid, me the* whole > amount, about
$60 or $70 odd. Trewhella saw him pay
me the money and said to Glaze: Tou
, if you pay another cent out on thi3
building I will kill you.' "
Aron was subjected to a rigid cross-ex
amination by District Attorney Byjngton.
The attempt of the defense to have read
the testimony of Silas Hatch was opposed
by the prosecution. Hatch gave evidence
in the Police Court, and though served
with a. subpena to attend the present trial
has left the city. Judge Dunne would not
allow Â¦ the defense to read the evidence
unless further proof .was forthcoming of
diligent search to locate the missing wit
ness. The trial .-will be resumed on Mon
day morning: at 10. â¢ -

The testimony for the prosecution in the
case of Robert E. Glaze, charged with. the
murder of his partner,' William Trewhella,
in the Windsor Hotel on January 14 last,
rested yesterday and the defense' com

When court convened in the morning the
prosecution was allowed to read the evi

Police Court. Havens has left the city
and it was impossible to serve him -with
a subpena to appear before Judge Dunne
and the jury trying the murder case. The
testimony of Havens was to. the effect
that on' January 14 he heard shots fired
in-the court of the .Windsor Hotel and
that he ran down to the courtyard. There
he saw Glaze and another man proceed
ing into the office. Havens also saw the
body of Trewhella lying near the kitchen
door and. that .Trewhella had a cigar in
the fingers of his right hand. The evi
dence showed that Havens had attempted
to help Trewhella, but could not do so.
Havens testified that he saw O'Connor,
the bellboy, near Trawhella's body.
Alfred, Kendall, stepson â¢ of Trewhella,
testified that .he had known Trewhella all
hislifeand that the deceased was about 5/
years old at the time of his death.
F. M. Black, hotel steward of the South
ern Pacific dining car system, testified
that on January 14 last he was employed
at. the "Windsor Hotel. "When theÂ» prose
cution tried to prove by the witness that
Glaze had made frequent threats against
Trewhella, Judge Dunne sustained the ob
jection of the defense on the ground that
the conversations between' Â¦witness' and
Glaze were too remote. -
At this point the Assistant District At
torney announced that the prosecution
rested Its case.
Argues Claim of Self -Defense.
â¢ Attorney Peixotto made the] opening ad
dress for the defense and claimed that it
would prove that Glaze killed Trewhella
in self-defense. The attorney dwelt upon
the life and career of Glaze and his mar
riage to Mrs. Shelly, his present wife.
Peixctto told how Glaze had gone intp
business at Â¦ the Windsor Hotel and .how
.Trewhella had a man named
Janes, as : his partner. He said Trewhella
had accused Glaze of dishonesty in allow
ing Janes $50 on' his board account and
from that transaction bitter feeling arose
between the hotel partners.
"We will show," said Peixotto, "that
Trewhella threatened the life of "Glaze
many times, especially Â¦when speaking to
a tradesman at the hotel. "We will show
that Trewhella said, 'I have trouble with
my partner and unless I get my money I
will, kill the â â â .' I We
will . prove that this tradesman Â¦ warned
Glaze. We Â¦ will â¢ also ' prove that Trew
hella, In: the presence of a witness, . said
to Glaze, 'If you pay any more bills like
this I will kill, you the very first time.'. "
Peixotto then 'told how Glaze had tried
to raise money in order to buy Trewhella's
interest in the hotel and that on the day
of the shooting Glaze went to look for
Trewhella In order to get his signature to
certain* documents. The attorney also
dwelt on the trouble between Mrs. Glaze
and Mrs. 'Trewhella on the night previous
to the shooting, when Trewhella forced
Mrs. Glaze out of his, wife's rooms and
shut the door in her face.
Says Trewhella Hade Threats.
"On the day of the unfortunate affair,"
said Peixotto, "Glaze and Trewhella had
words about the quarrel between their
wives on the previous night. Glaze tried
to quiet Trewhella, but Â«he latter was
angry and took up a. big butcher knife ajid
threatened Glaze. Glaze went away and
looked for his wife, hoping that she would
be able to pacify Trewhella. Again they
met in the kitchen and had words. Then
Glaze had < to go downtown on business.
On his way. uptown he secured cartridges
for his" revolver. ! . He had a right to do
this, being in the habit of carrying a
weapon, as all hotel men do who are on
duty in the office of hotels. The revolver
was cleaned and repaired at the store
without any suggestion of Glaze.
"When Glaze returned to the hotel he
had his lunch and then worked on the
books. He expected Trewhella, In order
to fix up. certain matters of the proposed
sale of Trewhella' s Interest to Glaze. Glaze
Â¦went to look for Trewhella In the kitchen,
where he knew Trewhella usually was at
that hour. In looking: for Trewhella Glaze
looked in the door of the old bakery and
saw Trewhella coming-; In at - the . other
door. Trewhella at once said to- Glaze:
'What, you. here? 'ââ¢ you, I will kill
you.' - Glaze saw something glisten in
Trewhella's hand and pulled his pistol and
