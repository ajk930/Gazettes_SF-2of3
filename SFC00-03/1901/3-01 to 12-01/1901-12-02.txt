PHILIPPINES
Pope Leo Will Settle the
Ecclesiastical Diffi
culties.
Mgr. Sbaretti Will Go at Once
to Manila as Apostolic
Delegate.
Will Have Plenary Powers in the
Islands to Carry Out the Policy
Soon to Be Outlined by
His Holiness.
Special D!?patch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. Lâ Advices
from Rome state that In a few days Pope
Leo XIII will issue a pontflcal bull which
Trill finally determine a settlement of the
ecclesiastical difficulties in the Philip
pines. It will be to parry out Its provi
sions that Mgr. Sbaretti, former Bishop
of Havana, will go at once to Manila
from Rome as Apostolic Delegate in suc
cession to Mgr. Chapelle, who will re
turn to his see in New Orleans.
The document will probably be about
10,000 words long, and will be drafted in
the form of an apostolic constitution. It
will be addressed generally to the hier
archy of the Philippines and specifically
to Mgr. Nozelada de Villa, Archbishop of
Manila. '
ICceds of the Islands,
In the first part the bull will treat of
the historic record of the church in the
Philippines, In the second of the discip
linary needs of the islands and in the
third of existing conditions of the church
there.
In accordance with his Judgment on the
reports presented to him of these con
ditions the Pope will order the holding
of a provincial council in Manila, at
which the canonical laws and diocesan
regulations enacted by the Ecumenical
Council of Archbishops and Bishops of
Latin-America, held In Rome " in 1899,
will be made also of force in the Philip
pines, modified only by such local needs
&s the islands show.
The clergy, secular and regular, will
remain as they now are, but new sem
inaries and schools and a new system
will be established for their education.
The present Bishops of all the sees, name
ly, Manila., Cebu, Jaro and Nuevo Car
ceres, will be retained, but four or five
new sees will be created. To these lat
ter American prelates or men trained in
American seminaries and ways will prob
ably be appointed.
Will Have Plenary Powers.
M*r. Sbaretti, new Apostolic Delegate
to Manila, will have the same plenary
powers as those exercised by the delegate
in Washington, and he will be charged in
Rome with the strict application of the
policy outlined by the Pope In this bull
to the hierarchy of the Philippines and
the laws enacted at the provincial coun
cil, which it summons and over which he
will preside in the Pope's name.
Archbishop Nozelada will leave for Ma
nila about the first of the new year, and
Mgr. Ebaretti will probably go with him.
Rev. Dr. Bonaventure Broderlck of New
Haven, Conn., will go as Mgr. Sbaretti' s
â¢ecretary, having been with him also dur
ing bis successful settlement of the prop
erty and other questions In Cuba.

PANAMA. Dec. 1.â To the Editor of The
Call: The revolutionists have been com
pletely routed. Their officers and men are
coming in every day to surrender. A
commission of Liberals has left to obtain
the surrender of General Diaz, coin
lnander of the revolutionary forces.
There Is considerable Indignation against
the Panama Rayroad Company for hav
ing given transportation to the revolu
tionary troops that captured Colon, and
for afterward having refused to carry
troops or mobilize the force of the Co
lombian Government, according to , con
tract. There Is no proof that the Insur
gents used any force to compel the rail
road to carry their troops to Colon.
General Alban has triumphed completely
and the Government is securely estab
lished in Colon and Panama. ' Peace Is
assured. Business men In Colon have re
opened their stores, which were closed
during the rule of the Liberals.
It is accepted by all that the war Is
at an end on the isthmus. Commanders
of foreign warships acted in a neutral
manner.

COLON, Dec. 1.â The Call correspondent
obtained an interview with General Car-
los Alban, Governor of the Department
of Panama and commander of Â£he mili
tary and naval forces of the isthmus, re
garding the situation. When General Alban
was asked If he could now maintain free
transit on the isthmus, he replied:
"Colombia does not require foreign aid
to maintain free transit across the isth
mus. Within nine days we have recap
tured Colon and have killed or taken pris
oners the troops which occupied that
fort."
"Are you satisfied with the terms of the
treaty executed in Colon?" was asked.
' "Yes: the terms are the same as those
arranged in July of iast year, when the
revolutionists surrendered at Panama. I
must'~say/ however, that many ot, .those
same rebels have again taken up arms
against the Colombian Government."
"Do you consider the isthmian revolu
tion entirely at an end?"
Will Crush the Liberals. "'
"Not yet," replied General Alban, em
phatically. "There are still several bands
of insurgents in the interior of -the De
partment of Panama. These bands will
soon be crushed.
"One of the revolutionary generals on
the isthmusâ Domingo Diazâ has already
been defeated. We are now going to de
feat the other insurgent general, Bells
carlo Parras, who capitulated last year.
"Diaz had a strong personal following.
So , has Parras. This condition of af
fairs clearly shows what the Colombian
nation has in prospect should Liberals
ever triumph. When the Liberal party
governed Colombia there were fifteen rev
olutions in twenty years." '
Bocas del Toro Taken.
News has reached Colon that a commit
tee of insurgents several days ago de
manded that Bocas del Toro should sur
render. It is now believed that Bocas del
Toro is in the hands of the revolutionists.
The British cruiser TrlbuneJeft port to
day for Bocas del Toro to protect British
interests there. The Tribune will return
on Tuesday and will report the situation
at Bocas del Toro..
The engines of the warship
General Pinzon are now being cleaned, as
the engineer declared that he would not
be responsible for any accident. When
the British cruiser Tribune returns to this
port the General Pinzon will be ready to
proceed to Bocas del Toro, if it is neces
sary.
The prefect of Colon and others who
have been imprisoned by the Liberals re
turned to Colon this evening.
Colonel Barrera, who led the force of
insurgents In the field against General
Alban's troops, has been found in the
bushes In a wounded condition. He will
receive his freedom and medical care in
Colon.
Troops Go to Interior.
The - Government will send troops Into
the interior of the department to-morrow
to operate against General Parras, whose
Insurgent force General Alban is anxious
to crush. T:'-
In an interview General Toliaco, com
mander of the Colombian warship Gen
eral Pinzon, says the surrender of Colon
was a burlesque. He declares that with
in twenty-four hours of the armistice the
Liberals secreted the best arms and left
worthless rifles. He says j this is shown
by the nature of the wounds of the Gov
ernment soldlero. â ' U "â¢â ".â - iV'.v" â¢.
Fourteen revolutionists boarded a train
for this port yesterday to surrender. They
were 111 and said they did not wish to con

CALL BUREAU, 1406 -G street, N. W.,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.â International
action looking to the prohibition of the
Importation Into China of munitions of
war and all material for the manufacture
thereof must be taken, if the peace of the
world is not to be disturbed by another
outbreak in the Celestial Empire.
This is the opinion of high officials
based upon . Information they have re
ceived. It^B expected that Minister Con
ger, in concert with his colleagues of the
diplomatic corps in Peking, will make
earnest representations to Prince Ching
and Yuan Shih Kai, with a view to com
pelling the Chinese Government" to 6top
importing .munitions of war or - material
to bemused In connection with their manu
facture.
. ; Remember Temporary Successes.
The Chinese have not forgotten the
temporary successes they achieved, first
in driving back to Tientsin the for
eign column under command of Vice Ad
miral Seymour, and in holding the native
city of Tientsin, and they believe that If
well armed they will in another war with
the hated foreigners have a better chance
of success. To prevent rearmament and
the resumption of hostilities against the
West, the foreign Ministers in Peking in
serted in the peace protocol a provision
requiring China to stop the importation
of munitions of war and materials for the
manufacture thereof for a period of two
years, and it was further provided that
the prohibition should continue for two
additional years if the powers deemed it
necessary.
â¢ Instead of enforcing this provision of
the protocol, China has , eagerly opened
her ports to foreign munitions of war and
material for the manufacture thereof.
May Secure Legislation.
The United States is in a somewhat em
barrassing position in this matter, owing
to the fact that the President has no
authority to prevent shipment by Amer
ican merchants of war munitions to
China. Certainly they could not be
stopped from sending to China materials
used In the manufacture of rifles an-.l
ammunition, because these materials are
also employed for other purposes. It Is
probable that the President and Secretary
Hay will seriously consider the advisa
bility of securing legislation under which
the importation of arms to China, ar
least, can be stopped.

WILLIAM G. CRANDALL MEETS
A HERO'S DEATH IN THE WRECK
Will Determine
Where Blame
Lies.
THE loss of life paused by the
heavy fog on \ Saturday night
when the ferry boat San Rafael
was ripped open by the Sausa
lito is not as great as was at
first feared. So far the reports
show but few lives lost. The awe and
terror of it all have largely passed away
and people are now, wondering that the
death list is so small.
Underneath the lies the ill
fated boat, the exact location of which
is not yet known. . Little of the buried
San Rafael will be of any "future value
except as wreckage. Her boilers, were
practically condemned, . but her engines
were good. As to the hull the general'
opinion is that it /was water-logged. Ac
cording to law both Captain McKenzie
of the San Rafael and Captain Trlbble of
the Sausallto will be obliged to file reports
with the ; United" States Inspectors of
Steam < Vessels. This will be done this
morning and r it is Just possible that the
investigation will be begun this afternoon.
Already jthe captains are talking about
their whistles and their, signals. Some
sort of a conflict is sure to develop. '.:â 
During the morning Captains Roach
and Whitelaw; master hands in drawing
wrecks from the deep, ' interviewed Cap
tain Tribble. in order to; get the location'
of the sunken boat. They will drag for
her to-day. The Impression current
among bay mariners condemns the San
Rafael for any future sea service. . . l
The Sausallto * was pretty badly dam
aged from the collision. Her; bow was
shattered to such an extent that .during
the service yesterday she ran as a'slngle
ender, backing out ; of: the slips and turn-
Ing round, very much after -the manner
of the boat that now lies submerged.
Would Try the Deep.
â  â¢Now ; that the ' heat of the excitement
and the nervous strain, of those who
were a â  part ? and parcel of the wreckage

even the children; remember those things
which were blank to"' them on Saturday

felt his footing go as "she sank from' sight. '

: George Treadway, one of the .waiters,

fifteen minutes that elapsed from i crash
to submergence. They picked up Tread
way, who was pinioned by a heavy: piece
of wood as the bow of the San Rafael
broke into the restaurant. Treadway's
che3t was crushed. Brown, and Scouler
carried him to the upper deck, where they
laid him out on the floor. All around the
boat were crying, . fear-stricken women
and children. To these they turned their
attentions, and so hard did they work that
they had barely time to save themselves.
As they felt the boat sink from under
them the dying cries of Treadway- rang
out. "For God's sake, Doys, don't leave
me!", he shouted. It was too. late. He went
down with the ship. ..'....
-And so the tales come in from all sides!
Acts of bravery there were in plenty, and
although the crash brought' panic at first

method of life-saving was tried. The
crew, a little slow to act at first, worked
weli In the heat of action. Boats were
lowered from both the San Rafael and

of lack of coolness on the part of the

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Surrenders His
Life to Save
Others.
THE body of 'William G. CrandaU,
secretary of the Long Syrup Re
fining Company, was found to
day among the rocks on the shore
of Angel Island. Crandall per
ished in the bay disaster. Tha
- discovery of the remains was
made by a soldier on guard at the quar
antine station shortly after 10 o'clock yes
terday morning. When Coroner Eden of
Marin County reached the scene the Iden
tification was made complete. â 
Crandall, when found, wore a life-pre
server. He was coatless and his body bora
no marks of Injury. He evidently drifted
beyond the call of help after he had sac
rificed personal safety and time in the)
work of rescuing others and died of sheer
exhaustion In .the water. How long tha
unfortunate man lived after the San Ra
fael sank from human vision and the Sau
sallto 'steamed away for San Francisco
with Its load of rescuers and panic
stricken survivors will never be told.
Crandall died a hero. He gave his own
life in saving those of weak women and
helpless children. Instead of scrambling
aboard the vessel that had survived the,
terrible force of the collision he remainad
behind on the sinking ship, rendering: ser
vice every minute of the time until tha
last passenger had left the sinking ferry
boat. Then he gave heed to his own
safety.
Lingered Too Long on San Rafael.
But Crandall had lingered too long. Tha
rescue ship went away and left him to
his fate in the dark waters. He floated,
sustained by the life-preserver he wore,
and there Is little probability that he died
immediately. He may have endured for
hours of awful suspense berore the end
came, too exhausted to raise an outcry
that would bring him aid.
The brave secretary commenced hla la

sels came together. He left the side of his
traveling companion, William- Mersfelder,
and quickly learning tne nature of the

to the ! upper cabins,- where the women
and children were. He led the way to

THRILLING TALES TOLD BY THE SURVIVORS
BRAVELY
BATTLES
FOR LIFE
Miss Mundell Barely
Escapes Death in
the Wreck.
Remains Afloat in Icy
Water for Twenty
Minutes.
Sees Little Girl Fall
Into the Bay and
Disappear.
PROBABLY of all those who were
rescued from the sinking ferry
boat no one had more thrilling
adventures or a narrower es
cape from death than Miss Es
ther llundell of â  San Rafael.
With her mother and little sis
ter Marguerite, she was seated In the
cabin reading when the collision oc
curred. Her first thought was to assist
her mother and sister to escape from the
sinking boat. In the excitement she was
accidentally pushed into the water from
the narrow railing of the upper deck of
the , San Rafael. She remained in the
â water, as near as she can judge, twenty
minutes, and then succeeded in climbing
back on board the San Rafael. Just as
the boat took her final plunge Miss Mun
dell jumped again into the water and sue- .
ceeded in obtaining a hold on a lifeboat.
Her troubles, however, did not end
here. As the San Rafael was disappear
ing beneath the waves the flagstaff fell.
The pole struck Miss Mundell a glancing
blow and almost precipitated her again
into the icy water. While she was cling
ing to the lifeboat Miss Mundell believes
that she witnessed the drowning of a lit
tle girl. The girl, whose name is not
known, was also clinging to the lifeboat.
A rope was lowered from the deck of the
San Rafael. She grasped the line and
â was being- drawn up when she let go and
disappeared into the water. Miss Mun
dell says' that she did not see the little
one reappear at the surface. The miss
ing child wore her hair parted In the
middle and hangs in braids down her
back.
Girl Breaks Open the Case. .
Miss Mundell's story of the collision and
the events 'ihat followed is very vivid.
She said: "When the shock came mother
and I and my little sister Marguerite
were in the ship's cabin, reading. We all
rushed over to the case where the life
preservers were kept and I broke the
glass windows with my hands. A gentle
man whom I do not know helped us to'
adjust the life preservers. The men 'were
encouraging the women and requesting
them to keep their self-control, telling
them that there was no danger. After
tho women realized just what had hap
pened they displayed as much self-control
as the men. The children were the only
ones that made any outcry. ,.
"After we had our life preservers prop
erly arranged we went out on the stern.
I then saw the Sausalito a few feet away.
My sister and myself went below to see
what chance there was of escape in that
direction. I saw the water bubbling
through the hole in the side. and con
cluded at once that the boat was doomed.
We went to the opening in the side of the
San Rafael, through which the passen
gers were being taken aboard the Sausa
lito. There was a dense crowd about the
hole And I thought that it -would be little
use for us to wait there. We again went
on the upper deck to where mother. was.
Almost as soon as I reached her the ves
sel settled deeper in the water, going
down with a motion similar to that of an
elevator. I cannot imagine how it was
possible that all those who were down
below waiting to be taken aboard the
Eausalito escaped when the boat 6ettled.
Escape* Through Broken Window.
"In order to get free of the San Ra
fael I broke through the windows at the
stern, using my hands to push out the
glass. JVhen we got outside there was
only a_ very narrow railirig for us to
cling tb. As I was endeavoring to make
my way along the side of the boat some
one pushed me overboard. I gave up all
hope of ever being rescued and com
menced to think that my time had come.
"My mother and little sister succeeded
in crawling through the window at the
stern of the San Rafael and got hold of
a life boat which was still fastened to
the deck, with a canvas stretched across
â¢ its top. As the San Rafael sank this life
boat broke loose from its fastenings. My
mother and sister still clung to it, but
because of the canvas which was
stretched over its top their hold was very
' precarious.
"The life boa\ floated near me and for
a time I was In grave danger of being
. crushed between it and the deck of the
. einking ferryboat. My mother gave me
her hand and by clinging to it I was able
to keep above water. My mother tried to
pull me aboard the life boat, but when I
saw she could not I swam the best I could
with the assistance of the life preserver
, back to the San Rafael or at least to the
! very small part of her that was Etlll
afloat When I reached the sinking boat
I do not think there was any one left
aboard her and so I was the last person
to leave her. By standing on the upper
deck of the vessel I was able to leap
- over and catch hold of the rim of the life
boat. I secured my hold 'just as my
mother was being drawn on board the
Sausalito.
"It was at this time that the flagpole
of the San Rafael came down and almost
knocked me again Into the water. It
struck me a glancing blow or else it
would certainly have loosened my feeble
Viold. By this time I was benumbed by
the chilly water.
Child Falls From Bope.
"While I was clinging to the life boat
I saw a woman and a little girl also hold
ing on to it. I Judged that the woman was
the little girl's mother. . A rope was
thrown from" the Sausalito and the little
girl took hold of it. As the men were
drawing her up the child's strength must
have given out, as she let go her hold and
sank at once into the water. I do not
think that she arose to the surface, at
leaÂ«:t I did not see her. Soon after that
a rope, emooth and slippery, was thrown
to me. It was with the greatest difiiculty
that I retained my hold until I reached
the deck of the Sausalito. i was almost
overjoyed when I found my mother and
sister safe.
"During the whole dreadful accident
surprisingly little excitement was dls
* played. Captain McKenzie acted in the
most commendable manner. While the
passengers* were' being taken aboard the
Sausalito through the opening in the
San Rafael's side Captain [McKenzle re
quested that the ladles and children be
cared for first. I- am not sure that his
request was entirelr obeyed. The en
gines of the doomed vessel made a most
fearful noise and " I dreaded every . mo
ment that there would be an explosion."
The young lady who passed through all
this thrilling experience spent yesterday
with her mother, Mrs. W. B. Mundell,
and her little sipter, at the home of a
friend on Oak street. Both the mother
and the older daughter have several pain
ful bruises. The hands of both were in
jured by the rope with which they were
drawn aboard the Sausalito.

He Goes Bravely to the Bottom, of
the Bay With the San â¢
Rafael.
The familiar old sorrel horse used for
many years for hauling baggage on and
off the San Rafael went down with that
ill-fated vessel Saturday night, and if it
Is possible for an animal to commit sui
cide this one certainly went to its doom
with the deliberate intention of not sur
viving the disaster.
...When Captain McKenzie saw the great
er part -of his passengers in safety on
board the Sausalito after the collision he
thought of the old horse hitched to a ring
in the wall near the left paddle box. He
ran down stairs and entered the lower
-passageway, which was then submerged,
and untied the animal. He attempted to
lead the horse to the rear of the boat,
which was then free from water. The
animal was perfectly calm and appar
ently unmoved by the scenes of excite
ment and panic which were being en
acted on every side. When Captain Mc-
Kenzie sought to guide the horse to a
point where the instinct of self-preserva
tion might prompt it to struggle in its
own behalf the equine refused to stir.
The boat was settling rapidly, and after
one, or two ineffectual attempts to coax

Among the pets on the San Rafael
which are missing is a tabby known as
FlpEsie. W*hen the vessel went down a
passenger In a boat saw a cat swimming
in the water. He drew it into the boat
and it was taken aboard the Sausalito.
The feline appeared to be greatly dis
tressed and went about the Sausalito
mewing plteously. When the ferryboat
drew into the slip Flossie disappeared and
has not been seen since. The cat was
born and raised on the San Rafael, and
the belief is that It Is searching the ship

its old home and meeting its feline asso

REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR
MTTRPHY NOT PROBABLE
Arizona, Executive Will Serve the
Balance of His Term Without
Hindrance. t
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 1.â A special to
the Republican from Washington says:
"The fight for the removal of Governor
Murphy seems to be confined to personal
opponents of it in Arizona. No echo of
it Is heard in Washington. . No charges
have been filed, and it is the intention of
the administration to have him serve out
his term. . . â¢
"Governor Murphy's commission is dat
ed to expire on December 14, 1902, This
commission is held to be an original ap
pointment and has nothing to do with pre
vious commissions or the term of office
of the men who held them. The recent
fight against Murphy is looked upon by
officials here as a closed incident, to " be
revived only in the case of future devel
opments. As the Governor does not de
sire a reappointment, the President will
find some other man. Colonel Brodie prob
ably stands the best chance at the end
of Murphy's term, though the matter is
far from being definitely disposed of."

bay disaster reached here. All

a general feeling of suspense. All night

jsat at the posts of duty, deluged by mes
sages of inquiry from both sides of "the
bay. Crowds of anxious people lingered
about to make themselves acquainted
with every particle of. information ob
tainable and many were obliged to wait
for hours. - â 
At daybreak the dense fog commenced
to lift. - It revealed a condition of abso
lute calm on the bay and disclosed to
view several ships that had left San
Francisco ocean-bound, but which had
sought . anchorage, fearful to proceed. At
first It was believed- that some of these
vessels had come in from the ocean and
had lost their bearings In the thick mist,
but small boats that spoke them learned
otherwise. x -V^' '
Passengers Receive Welcome.
About 8:30 the whistle of the ferryboat
Bausalito sounded and a rush was made
for the slip. The Sausalito steamed up
cautiously, displaying- battered woodwork
and a badly smashed rudder as a result
of the collision. Her passengers were be
sieged by the anxious and they were
obliged to Â«tell all they knew of the dis

It was not until late in the afternoon,
however, that every one except the three

MJL S the hours pass since the San Rafael had her side opened

stories of rescues more or less heroic in character are told by par
ticipants and eye-witnesses. The very nature of the collision end
the circumstances under which the boat .gradually disappeared in
the water precluded the possibility of a great and general heroism
on the part of the survivors. Nevertheless, there were many in
stances'of genuine bravery and from many tongues come stories
of the bravery of both men ah d women. Here and there a help
ing hand was outstretched with the result ihatynqre than one life
was saved, which otherwise would have been lost. It was coolness
and quick action that prevented drowning in many cases. So far
but a single act of great- self -sacrifice is onrecord. â  While devoid
of spectacular and sensational heroism the small loss of life is in
itself a sufficient testimony of useful labor executed with a sure
hand. The rescuers, and there zvere many of them, did a noble
piece of work. ;â :â â  : .' â¢ : . '

Some of the passengers speak of the ut
ter worthlessness of the tule life-pre
servers. In some cases they are said to
have sustained the weight of the strug-
Hng passengers, and in others they/be
came a burden. The fact that plugs had
not been- properly placed in the lifeboats
is also a subject for condemnation. The
first boat that touched the water was
rendered useless and nearly caused the
drowning of Its occupants, and it Is said
that the aperture in â  another was plug

Superintendent E.H. Shoemaker of the

knowing the condition of the atmosphere
and the details of the collision, thinks
differently -to us. Both vessels made the
trip from their slips under less. than half
speed, feeling their way along as they
proceeded. The engines .were worked all

have been done had the vessels been gor

quite possible. I found myself in the grip

away from my rescuers. I felt that if I
was borne away from the scene of the
wreck I was lost, although I was well sup

become paralyzed. All I could do was to
lie still yd yell for help, which never
came. Ifheard shouting, but as I was
borne away into the fog by the tide these
cries became more and more still, until at
length I could hear nothing but the wash

where I was, and I gave myself up for

instinct of self-preservation is strong in

found Lorenz lying on the ground. He
soon recovered consciousness and said he
had been struck from behind. He had
been drinking and was on his way home.
His gold chain and locket and about $2
which he had in his' pocket had been
stolen, but his silver watch was in his
vest pocket. He was sent to the Re

my fancies would change and I thought
myself lying upon a slab at the Morgue.
Last Cry of Despair Is Heard.
' "This sort of thing filledCme with a ter
ror I hope never to experience again.
The chill of approaching death gripped
me, and despairingly I shouted once more.
It was this cry which was heard and to
which I owe my rescue from death.
"In answer to my cries came a call
near me in the fog. I felt as if I were
dreaming, but when I shouted again, the
answering hail struck my ear like the
strains of divine music I thought I was
dreaming, when I felt myself clutched by
the collar and dragged into a boat. Com
pletely exhausted I lay on my back con
scious of only one fact, that the neces
sity for struggling to keep my head above
water no longer existed. A man leaned
over me and gave me whisky to drink.
After a time my rescuer told me his
name was Cuneo and that he was return
ing from his fishing grounds i when he
beard my shouts and came to my assist
ance. I was then " in the gate making
double-quick time for the Farallones.
Juneo took me to his house on Lombard
street and this morning I was taken to
my residence. I learned that I was in
the water four hoursâ it seemed a hun
dred to me. I have had adventures in my
time, but none. is comparable to this. I
hope I will never experience a similar
one." - 'â¢ ,

EXPLAINS
TULE FOG
Unique Vapors Appear
5 All Over Pacific
Coast.
Hang Like a Blanket
Over the Sea arid
% Land.
Mariners Should Take
Warning of the <
Danger. -
THE unusual density of the fog
of Saturday evening, in -which
the San Rafael was sent to the
bottom of the bay, was the sub
ject of considerable speculation
yesterday. Old residents declared
that the like of the fog had never
been seen by. them in California before,
and in some respects this was true. The
fog was what is known as a tule, , or
ground fog, and while it is a purely local
meteorological phenomenon it often
reaches a thickness of from 100 to 500
feet and extends over a vast territory.
Alexander G. McAdle, forecast official
of the. Weather Bureau, who is an ex
pert on the subject of fogs, gave a scl
tenific explanation of the dense one .â¢ of
Saturday night to a Call reporter yester
day. He said he had watched its com
ing with interest, and early on Saturday
realized that it would be of a character
full of menace to shipping on the bay.
Bulletins were accordingly issued to that
effect. Resuming, he said:
"The fog was an unusually thick' one,
and extended from this city to Red Bluff,
Sacramento, Fresno and Santa Barbara.
It was about 100 feet thick. , It was a
tule fog, formed. by the condensation of
water vapor in the lower level of the am
This moist>ir, in coming in contact with
a slow-movir.g current of cold air, was
condensed, thereby producing . a fog
through which it was difficult if not im
possible to distinguish objects twenty feet
away. The primary cause of the fogwai
an area of high pressure over Nevada.
This pressure was- blocked in that section,
and when it .began to move it moved
very slowly toward the coast. "When it
reached this section the fog . resulted.
- "Indications received to-day . tend â¢ to
show that the stagnation in the air cur
culation is breaking and that there will
be no fog after .to-morrow. The chances
of rain within the next twenty-four hours
are excellent. There was no fog at Point
Reyes or on Mount Tamalpals yesterday.
If any one had got into a balloon at
5 o'clock yesterday afternoon he would
have been suspended at 500 feet elevation
over a fog blanket above which the sun
was shining ! brilliantly. "If the ferry
boats on the bay were provided with
masts seventy-flve feet high the chances
are that a lookout thereon would be well
above the fog and well able to distinguish
the proximity of vessels with equally high
masts. I have seen several fogs as thick
as that of Saturday* night during my res
idence here, but fortunately nothing oc
curred to make them memorable. We may
expect them at any time, and particularly
in January, which will prove to be the
most dangerous month by reason of their
presence for the shipping on the bay."
EAGAN CAUSES
GREAT DAMAGE
Invades Castle on Sum
mit of Telegraph
: Hill.
Mortimer Eagan created quite an ex
citement about 11 o'clock last night in the
observatory building on the crest of Tel
egraph Hill, which is at present in charge
of Emile Vincent and his wife. The build
ing was formerly occupied as a boarding
house for men employed by a contract
ing firm. .â¢ â 
Vincent was Asent last night when
Eagan made his appearance at the ob
servatory. He knocked at the front door
but was denied admittance. He then went
around to the rear, found a window that
was - unfastened, and crawled in. He
went into the room occupied by Mrs.
Vincent and proceeded to demolish every
thing in sight.
Eagan cut pictures from their frames,
overturned tables, and generally de
stroyed the furniture. Mrs. Vincent
screamed and attracted the attention of
some of the neighbors, who notified the
police. Eagan saw a shotgun in a corner
and seizing it, pointed It at Mrs. Vincent
and commanded her to keep quiet. Mrs.
Vincent promptly did so by falling in a
taint.
When Policemen Silver and Gould re
sponded to the call for help they found
that Eagan, shotgun in hand, had barri
caded himself in the building and was
prepared to resist all intrusion. As it wag
Impossible to get in at the front part of
the building, the police went around to
the rear and finding an open door, rushed
in and captured Eagan before he had
time to realizeuhat his new-found strong
hold had been carried by assault.
The officers secured the shotgun after a
short resistance and. handcuffed him. They
left Mrs. Vincent, who was gradually re
covering from her fright, in care of her
neighbors and cent Eagan to the City
Prison, where he was charged with dld
turbing the peace. Other charges may be
preferred against him to-day.
Trapp Has Disappeared.
The disappearance of Edwin Trapp,
sometimes called Trlpp, a lather, was re
ported to the police yesterday by his
wife, who is living, with her friends at
3323 Twenty-third street. Trapp left his
home, 206 Polk street, about six weeks
ago to work near Napa. Since then he
has not been heard of and his wife has
learned that he never reached his desti
nation. She fears foul . play, as. she Is
sure he -would have communicated with
her if ho were alive. He is 36 years of
age. y \
Order Fighting Stopped.
. Placards were posted late last night
throughout Chinatown by order of the Six
Companies calling upon all Chinese tongs
to cease fighting and-Â«dvising them if
they had any differences to settle to call
upon them. It is thought by the police
and those conversant with the feeling In
Chinatown that but little attenion will be
paid to these notices. An additional force
of officers was again sent into Chinatown
last nisht. .

PARENTS OF CYRUS A. WALLER
FEEL SURE THEIR BOY IS DEAD
Mind of Mother Is Overcome by Grief and Physicians
Pronounce Her Condition Very Grave.
THE news of the wreck of the San
Rafael caused the most intense
excitement at Mill Valley. Fully
forty residents of the little town
were known to have been aboard
the sunken vessel, and friends and
Â¦ relatives of the passengers who
were not immediately accounted for went
nearly wild with anxiety. As those who
had escaped returned they were met at
the station by almost the whole popula
tion of the village and besieged with ques
tions. Most of those who were expected
to arrive on the San Rafael were ac
counted for Saturday night, but several
were not heard from until yesterday. Late
last night it was finally decided by the
townspeople that no one from the Valley
had been lost.
Miss ; I.".. Diffenbach,. Miss Sallle Boyle
and Frank Loyez were those for whom
the greatest concern was felt, but all
three were found to have been rescued,
although the last named had a very nar
row escape. He stayed aboard the doomed
vessel . until the water reached to his
knees. ' A rope was at last flung to him,
and he had just time to wind it about
his arm when the San Rafael sank. He
was dragged aboard the Sausalito in an
almost unconscious condition as, a result
of having been battered with some of the
loose, wreckage. His right arm and side
were quite seriously injured, but he was
able to be removed to Mill Valley last
night.
Mrs. A. R. Tuckey and infant daughter
were reported among the ' drowned and
the most diligent Inquiry revealed no
trace of their whereabouts. It was
learned yesterday, however, by the half
crazed husband that they had been taker
from the water and were at the home of
a relative in this city. Mr. Tuckey camo
to San Francisco and found them both
alive and well, except that the "wife was
You would usually pay about $12.50 for a suit or overcoat as good as these. You ask
wliy is our price so low, and you wonder if we have sacrificed workmanship or trimming. Our
answer can be summed in a few wr^ds. The reasonableness of the prices and the superioriry of
the goods are due to the privile^s we enjoy in our manufacturing facilities. We buy the
cloth direct from the mill and make the clothes ourselves â make them in great quantities for
our two large retail stores in New York and San Francisco, and for our wholesale trades. The.
saving does r&t come in the workmanship or the materials, but in the selling to you direct,
thus saving what ordinarily goes to a middleman; and there is a saving, too, in making
clothes in immense quantities. Isn't it perfectly plain to you that we sell clothes at fully 25
per cent less than merchants who must buy through middlemen?
Furthermore, for your protection every suit or overcoat is guaranteed and money-
backed. Here are mentioned two of our many values: - ''â  ,'â *"..

Mother's Hind Gives Way.
All hope for the safety of their five
year-old son Cyrus A. Waller, has been
abandoned. by his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Waller of Ross Valley, and the
mother's mind has been seriously affected.
Mrs. Waller, her daughter Ruth and little
son ' Cyrus were passengers on the San
Rafael. Mrs. Waller and her daughter
were saved, but little Cyrus was evidently
swept overboard.
For a time there was a belief that the
five-year-old boy picked up by W. A.
Beedy, Miss Fannie Shoobert and Mrs.
Olive Hamilton was the missing child. All
night long the father and mother lived in
hope that it might be. Mrs. Hamilton took
charge of the little one who was so
strangely thrown upon her hands, and so
soon as possible took him to her Sausalito
home.
Last Hope Dispelled.
Bright - t and early yesterday morning
Waller started out on his search, and
finally located Mrs. Hamilton. He was
shown the clothing worn by the lad and
at once said it was not that of his son. At
last the search was abandoned and the
dread news was brokeh to the distracted
mother.
Overcome by the excitement of the pre
vious night and distracted at the lack of
news of her missing son Mrs. Waller was
in a state of nervous collapse all day. But
when came the dread news that no fur
ther tidings could be obtained her over
wrought brain gave way and a state of
delirium ensued. Medical aid was sum
moned, and not until powerful oplafes
had been administered did relief come to
her. Notwithstanding the promptness
with. which treatment was given her the
attending physicians deem her situation
very grave. T V ;
Every effort Is being made by the father
to recover the body, and in order to stim
ulate the search he has offered a reward
of $25. The boy .was dressed In a navy
blue sailor suit, trimmed with white
braid, and wore black shoes and stcck
ings. The child was of light complexion,
with light hair, trimmed short.
Charles "Waller, the father. Is employed
as a janitor In the Hlbernia Bank. Mrs.
Waller is at present with her parents cu
Kentucky street, It not being deemed ad
visable to leave her alone In Ross Valley.

HIS "USUAL STRENGTH
Simply Overtaxes His Strength and
a Night's Best Restores Him to.
Normal Condition.
Angelo Brizzolara, who did such gal
lant rescue work in the Sausalito Just
after the collision, and was finally pros
trated, was sufficiently recovered yester
day to visit his home In San Rafael. Dr.
Sartorl, who was called upon to attend
him, found that the excitement had af
fected his heart and prescribed rest and
quiet for a few days. Brizzolara was put
to bed in his brother's house and after a
night's rest felt but little the worse, for
his efforts.
Brizzolara' s father was killed In an ac
cident on the San Joaquin River on the.
night of November 26. 1838, the Saturday
following Thanksgiving day. Brizzolara
Sr. was severely scalded by the explosion
of one of the boilers of the T. C. Walker,
on which he was a passenger, and died
two days later. Thanksgiving day of
this year was the anniversary of hlÂ«
death. /

ACTORS PERFORM
BEFORE ROYALTY
Entertain King- Edward
and English Court at
Sandringham.
LONDON, Deo. 1.â The theatrical event
of last week was the summoning of Dan
Leno to Sandringham, where he and Ella
line Terriss and Seymour Hicks perform
ed before the court. Lieno is the first mu
sic hall artist who was ever invited and
the papers are full of interviews with him.
His wife and family and a large crowd
of admirers met Leno on his return as if
he were a victorious general. The King
gave him a diamond scarfpin. Among the
support of Miss Terriss and Hicks was
Holbrook Blinn. who was very proud of
being the first man actor to be summoned
by the King. Blinn says the King's ap
pearance is remarkable, in contrast with
the current reports of Hjs ill health. Re
turning from a day's shooting, his Ma
jesty in shooting costume welcomed his
guests in the heartiest manner. His cheeks
â¢were ruddy. The Queen appeared, for the
flrst time since Queen Victoria's death,
in a white evening gown. The King mani
fested a special interest in Dan Leno and
Eaid:
"I suppose, out of deference to you, we
ought to smoke during the performance,
but I trust you will amuse us without it."
"The Belle of Xew York" was revived
at the Century Theater Wednesday with
every sign of success. Sullivan and Ellen
Dupont are the only members of the orig
inal cast in the present production, Madge
I^essing taking Edna May's old part, while
Elfle Fay makes the hit of the play as
the Bowery girl, which Ella Snyder in~
troduced in London.
PALL IN COPPER PRICES
NOT DUE TO THE TRUST
Amalgamated CompanyEndeavors to
Sell When a Corner Cannot
â¢ Be Maintained.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â The Times in its
financial article, discussing the copper po
sition, says it thinks- it very improbable
that the Amalgamated people have engi
neered the fall in copper prices in order
to force other mines to join the combina
tion, because such a policy, even if suc
cessful, would be dangerous, inasmuch as
it would have the effect of depreciating
the prices of other commodities and se
curities which the Amalgamated group is
anxious to keep up.
The Times is of the opinion that the
Amalgamated Company only endeavors
to sell copper when its managers believe
It is useless to try to maintain the corner
any longer, or when they believe it in
convenient to lock up so much money in
one article. In view of the big consoli
dation schemes In the United States and
the withdrawal of the investing public
since the New York panic May 9, the
Times says if would not be surprised if
some powerful capitalists were to con
sider it prudent to increase their cash re
serves.

MADRID, Dec. 1.â When the Princess
of the AsturiaH, sister of the King, who
was married February 14, 1901, to Prince
Charles of Bourbon, gave birth to her

Charles carried the infant around and
presented him to Premier Sagasta, â  the
Ministers and other dignitaries. The
royal salute was fired. A telegram was
sent to the Pope asking his blessing. It
is expected'the Pope will consent to be
the young Prince's godfather. He will be
christened next Tuesday. His name will
be Alfonso Andrew. A royal decree has

VÂ» ,.;*? â  *
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 â The annual re
port of William li. Ridgeley, Comptroller
of the Currency, has been prepared for
transmission to Congress. "The /report
starts with a detailed statement of the
resources and liabilities of the national
banks, as shown by the rive , reports of
condition made in 'response to the call of
the Comptroller. In commenting on this
statement the Comptroller says:
The authorized capital '"stock of the 4279
national banking associations in -existence on
October 31. 3Â»U1, was.*663,224,l35, which is a net
increase durinc the year . ot. fiO, 721,800. There
was an increase In capital stock- of $21,674,500
by banks organized during the year, including
1120,000 of newly organized associations,, which
increased their capital . stock to -that, amount
subsequent to ' the date of ' organization The
associations which were in existence on Octo
ber; 81. â  1900. increased their- capital stock dur
ing the year to the extent- of t21,S13.OOO. There
was Â» decrease of capital 'stock of *8, 040,000 by
voluntary liquidations. On October 31, 1901, the
outstanding circulation Â« of." : national banks,
amounted to j359,Ka2, 715, an .increase for thÂ«
year of ?2Â«,219,447, and since the passage of
the act of March 14, 1900, of $105,806,485.
The Comptroller has prepared ' tables
showing- the aggregate resources -of na
tional. State savings banks, private banks
and loan and trust companies from.re
ports made to him or obtained from other
sources. The result of this investigation
shows the existence of 12,972 banks of all
kinds in the country, with an aggregate
capital of $1,138,042,134; surplus and un
divided prolits of J693.465.095 and $270,855,
253 respectively; deposits, $8,G19,2S5,110, and
loans ana discounts. $6,461,030,743.
Banks in New Possessions. .
Statistics obtained from one national,
three other incorporated and two private
banks In three incorporated
banks In Porto Rico and seven incorpo
rated banks. Including branches, in the
Philippine Islands, making an aggregate
of sixteen institutions in these new terri
torial possessions, show an aggregate cap
ital of $4,313,978: surplus and undivided
profits, $1J27.25O; deposits, $23,018,602 and
loans, $13,908,262.-
.. Under the various acts of Congress 0006
banks with an authorized capital of $795,
407,682 have been organized, of which 4279
were in active operation at the close of
the report year, 1340 in voluntary liquida
tion and 387 In chargre of receivers or
finally closed.
Geographically the largest number of
banks chartered during the report year
were organized in the Middle States.
In the Pacific States, including Hawaii,
fourteen banks of the smaller class were
organized, with aggregate capital of $360,
000, and twelve of the larger class, wilh
$1,800,000 capital.
During the last session of Congress a
bill, to provide for the extension of the
charters of" national banks passed the
House : of Representatives, but failed to
receive consideration in ..the Senate.
: Comptroller Ridereley urgently recom
mends that this bill or a similar measure
be enacted into law.
Comparing the volume of business of
the savings banks of the United States
with those. of the European countries the
report shows that in the matter of de
posits the United States, as for years
past, stands at the head. The banking
power of the United States since 1S90
shows an' increase of 121 per cent. Ag
gregratine- the banking- power of tho
United Kingdom and the .United States

Money Needlessly Locked Up.
In commenting on the present system of
sub-treasuries the Comptroller calls at
tention to the disadvantages and derange
ments its operationse cause in our finan
cial matters, and says:
There could be no better illustration of this:
than its onsratlona in the last few months.-
This been to needlessly lock up and take
out of circulation vast sums of money just at
a time when it will be badly needed for mov
ing crops and transacting the regular business
of the country. If the Secretary of the Treas
ury" is given authority so that he can arrangp
to have more of the money collected by the
Government deposited with the national banks
and kept there until needed, it can be done
under such regulations, restrictions and super
vision as to insure the Government against loss
and give relief from the present system.
Referring to the criticism which has
been made of the act of March 14, 1900.
to the effect that it does not properly
safeguard the gold standard, but leaves
it possible for the Secretary of the Treas
ury to practically undo the effect of the
act by departmental action and regula
tion without further legislation, the
Comptroller says:
If the act can be made 'stronger by amend
ments and the gold standard of value rendered
more secure from any future uncertainty it
should be done without any delay.
Since the passage of the act of March 14,
1300, the total amount of circulation which all
the national banks have outstanding has been
increased from $254,026,230 to $859,382,715, an in
crease of $105,806,230, or over 41 per cent.
The provisions of the act . have also added
somewhat to the elasticity of the national bank
currency. It, however, leaves much to be de
sired In the way of elasticity, the lack of which
13 the greatest fault of our national bank is
sues.
Congress has already had under discussion
and consideration various measures for the
modification of the national bank currency.
There is much discussion on the subject by
bankers and financiers and many plans are
urged for adoption. Somewhere between the
views of the ardent advocates of asset cur
rency and thoee who oppose it with vehemence
as unsafe and unsound in every respect, there
should be found safe middle ground..
PRESIDENT CONFIRMS
A SENTENCE OF DEATH
Private Daniel Healy Must Die for
Murdering a Sergeant in the
Philippines. ....Â» rjii^
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. â President
Roosevelt has confirmed a sentence of
death Imposed by a general court-martial
convened at Nueva Caceres, Philippine is
lands, upon Private Daniel Healy, Com
pany C, Twenty-seventh Infantry, who
was tried for . and convicted of murder
and, sentenced to be hanged. This is the
second instance since Roosevelt entered
upon his duties as President cf the United
States wherein a death sentence imposed
upon an American soldier has been ap
proved by him. In but one case did the
late .President McKinley sign the death
warrant of a soldier of the United States â
that of Phineas Foutz, an. Ohio soldier,
who murdered his Filipino sweetheart.
It is said at the War Department that
Healy's crime was the shooting of a ser
geant of his company while the latter was
asleep.

EX-QUEEN LILIUOKALANI
HASTILY LEAVES GOTHAM
FOR NATIONAL CAPITAL
Former Ruler of Hawaiian Islands Is Dis=
pleased by Lack of Courtesy Shown .
by People of New York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. I. â Former Queen Liliuokalani,
with an imperia 1 retinue and seventeen pieces of
imperial baggage, left New York to-day for Wash
ington. Her departure was somewhat unexpected,
as it had been given out that she was lo remain in the city
for several. days. Her Majesty was much disappointed, how
ever, at 'the' way New York ,had treated her. She was willing
to forgive- the fact that several hotels were too full to accom
modate her, for she appreciated that they did not realize that
royalty was knocking at the door. But nobody came to pay
her homage, not even Mayor Van'Wyck or Squire Croker or
daughters of the crown. The feelings of her Majesty were
hurt by this neglect, and k;te on Saturday night she called her
royal secretary, Joshua Rea, into her royal presence and had
a talk with him. v,
"Joshua," said the ex-Queen, ''the people of this city
don't seem to appreciate the fact that royalty is here to be en
tertained. What are we going to do about it?" ,
"I don't know, ma'am â I mean your Majesty," said Rea.
fl guess they haven't the.right idea about queens in this town.
Suppose we go to Washington?" -
. The lady agreed and the party left the Hotel Roland at
8 o'clock this morning and was driven to the station.
WASHINGTON, Dec. i.â Ex-Queen Liliuokalani of
the Hawaiian Islands, accompanied by Miss Myra Heluluhs,
John D. Amiolku ,and Joshua K. Rea, arrived in Washing
ton to-night from New York. The former Queen and mem
bers-of her suite would not meet callers.
BRITONS HONOR
GENERAL BULLER
Demonstration in Lon
don in Which Trades
Unions Participate.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â "Buller's" Sunday
passed without serious Incidents. The
Government had taken, every precaution
to prevent disturbances. This included
the reading, at three parades last week,
of a special order in the military regu
lations which forbids officers or soldiers
from "taking part in any meetings, dem
onstrations or processions for party or
political purposes." * .
A large body of police, many of whom
were mounted, were stationed along the
line of the procession and notably in front
of the War Office.
The trades unions and worklngmen's so
cieties, with bands and banners, assem
bled . along the embankment this after
noon. There were thousands of specta
tors. Owing to the difficulty of marshal-
Ing the large bodies of men the procession
was late in starting.- It was headed by a
huge banner on which was a portrait of
General Buller. The procession traversed
Northumberland avenue. Pall Mall, St.
James street and Piccadilly to Hyde Park.
The window* of clubland, and especially
of the service clubs, were crowded with
sightseers.
At Charing Cross several mounted po
lice rode up to the head of the proces
sion and attempted to seize a plaster bust
of General Buller.- The man carrying the
bust dashed it to the ground. This inci
dent caused much Indignation, but the
leaders were able to curb and restrain the
paraders, some of whom wished to attack
the policemen.
Opposite the War Office there was much
groaning and cries of "shame" from the
men in the procession, but otherwise the
proceedings were without incident.
When Hyde Park was reached it was
almost dark. Here speeches from several
platforms representing England, .Ireland,
Scotland, Wales, Devonshire and the Col
onies were made. The confusion was so
great as to render the speakers almost
inaudible, but amid a roar of cheers a
resolution of sympathy for General Bul
ler was proposed and adopted' with" great
enthusiasm and a wild waving of hand
kerchiefs and hats.
Features of the demonstration were the
passing of collection boxes for a work-^
ingmen's memorial to General Buller and
the large sale of buttonhole portraits and
favors of the general.
It Is estimated that at least 50,000 people
were present at the demonstration in
Hyde Park. This makes it the biggest
thing. of Its kind which has occurred for
many years.

PORT TOWNSEND, Doc. l.-According
to Oriental papers brought by the steam
ship Glenogle, a high official of the Chi

throne - to ' publish an illustrated ' book

ing Its memorable flight from Peking, and
asked that the- book be circulated

MENELIK'S AID
IS IN AMERICA
Young Man's Gorgeous
Uniform Attracts
- Attention.
Special Dispatch to The. Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 1.â A young man of
dark brown complexion, looking not un
like an American negro, Who was a pas
senger by the. French liner La Gascogne,
in to-day from Havre, enforced the no
tice of everybody on the French pier by
his gorgeous uniform, his bearing and his
swords.
That part of the uniform distinguishable
in rifts in the golden clouds of lace was
blue. The young man announced himself
to the reporters as Lieutenant Bonlto Syl
vain, "aid and naval officer to his Majesty
King Menelik of Abyssinia." He spoke
with a strong'French accent and was sur
prised apparent**- that Menelik's aid-de
camp was not tteated more graciously by
the customs inspectors.
The lieutenant had two swords, one in
his hand and the other in a scabbard by
his side. He has other swords in his bag
gage. He started to leave the pier before
his trunks had been examined and O. K.'d
and was turned back. He protested that
he was the representative of "ze great
Menelik, ze King of Abyssinia."
He was told, he would have to take hi3
turn with the other passengers unconnect
ed with African royalty. He said he could
not understand why anybody connected
with the court of Menelik should be treat
ed that way, but he had to submit. He
said he was on his way to Haytl, partly
on business for his King and partly on
pleasure.

WILSON OPPOSES PLAN
OF THE LIVESTOCK MEN
Says There Is No Need for the Ap
pointment of an Additional
Federal Commissioner.
CHICAGO, Dec. 1.â Livestock men need
expect no assistance : from Secretary of
Agriculture Wilson in their plan to have
Congress create a Federal livestock com
missioner to rank as Second Assistant
Secretary v of Agriculture. Wilson, who
was said by some of the delegates of the
National â  Livestock Association to be in
favor of the proposition, arrived here to
-day and announced his opposition to the
plan. ' , â 
"We have a Bureau of Animal Industry
now," said the Secretary, "and it is en
tirely competent to lqok after the i live
stock interests of the country. There are
1(KX) men under the direction of the bureau,
which is headed by Dr. Salmon, who is
thoroughly versed in all matters pertain
ing to the cattle raising Industry. I my
self am a livestock man and in sympathy
with the alms and objects of the livestock
association. I can see no reason for the
creation of any new office in the depart
ment and if any one has said otherwise
a mistake has been - made. - I do not see
that the livestock interests can complain
of the manner in which they have been
treated. by the Federal Government." -â

LONDON, Dec. 2.â A dispatch to the

Boer forces do not seem to diminish.
The dispatch says the Boers are con
stantly, escaping from the concentration
camps and towns to rejoin the fighting
forces, and that measures will have to be
taken to stop this leakage. The Boers in
the towns are still irreconcilable, says the
dispatch, and believe their cause will

CAPE TOWN, Dec. 1.â Sir Gordon Sprigs.
Prime Minister of Cape Colony, during
the course of a speech at a banquet, said
Cape Colony was maintaining in the Cape
an army numbering 18,000 men. the bulk
of whom were mounted, and that these
â¢numbers were increasing weekly. It was
a great strain on the treasury, said the
Prime Minister, but the Colony was pre
pared to bear it as long as necessary. The
rebels were being gradually worn down
and the prospect was not discouraging.
BERLIN BOEKSE IMPROVES.
Reports From the United States In
fluence the Market.
BERLIX, Dec. 1. â Increased confidence
and further gains, were . noticeable â¢ on
the Boerse during the last week. It was
the best week in many months, all de
partments scoring advances.
The German financial reviews explain
the improvements on the Boerse In vari
ous ways. .They all agree, however, that
the domestic and industrial situation docs
not warrant this improvement. Among
the causes named as responsible for the
week's amelioration is the great abun
dance of money, the forthcoming flotation
of numerous domestic, foreign . and
state loans, ushering in an era
of greater activity for the banks of
emission, and the especially strong Amer
ican iron market. This market is giving
unusual strength to .German Iron shares.
<These Irave also profited from -the ex
pected â  reduction In the price of coal,
which was announced yesterday and
which amounts, in most grades, to 1
mark per ton. The reduction in coal
also profited the coal shares, though to
v a less degree than the other departments.
The reports from the United Sttea ex
ercise an especially strong influence on
the/ market. The Boersen Courier says
these reports constituted the market's
chief impulse, and points to the exces
sive optimism shown by German specu
lators, saying it is a fact that German
iron shares since the recent Improvement
have risen more than United States steel.
The other papers attempt to dampen this
excessive optimism, and refer to the con
tinued discouraging reports from the
Iron trade. News from the Lorraine and
Luxemburg districts represent business
there as growing worse. The Cologne
Gazette says the demand for plates has
improved, and that producers believe the
depression has reached its extreme limit.
American securities were apparently
neglected. The money market was the
easiest known for years; call loans reach
ed 1 per cent. It was at times almost im
possible to place money, and the abun
dance of money made the monthly settle
ment extremely easy.
The Frankfurter Zeitung believes that
the rates for money will continue to be
low, and that the improvement hi the
market is likely, to continue.
Cresceus in Winter Quarters.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1.â Cresceus, the
king of trotters, arrived at Lo^Angeles
to-day, accompanied by Tim C. Murnaner,
his trainer. Cresceus was taken to his win
ter quarters at Agricultural Park. The
great trotter will be sent against the
world's record on December 14 if the track
permits of the attempt on that date.

TELLS OF DEATH
OF MISS STONE
Vali of Salonica Confirms
Story of Finding Her
Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIENNA, Dec. 1.â The Constantinople
correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse
telegraphs that the bodies of Miss Stone
and Mme.i. Tsilka have been found near
Dubnitza, Bulgaria, twenty-two miles
from Sofia. An official report from the
Vali of Salonica confirms the statement
that the two wpmen are dead. Their
deaths apparently occurred a month ago.
In commenting on the dispatch the Neue
Freie Presse says the report is possibly a
mistake. â¢ â¢ >â¢â¢ - , â .â¢â¢*â  '-
SOFIA. Dec. 1.â M. Mihalowsky, presi
dent of the Macedonian committee, recent
ly made a speech at Varna, In Bulgaria,
in which he denounced M. Saratoff, for
mer president of the committee, and the
Macedonians as agitators, murderers and
blackmailers. Among other crimes he 'ac
cused them of kidnaping Miss Ellen M.
Stone, the American missionary.
The Macedonians of Sofia held an indig
nation meeting here to-day. Violent
speeches were made denouncing M. Miha
lowsky and in which M. Saratoff was
eulogized as the hero of Macedonian
youth. This Incident is important as dem
onstrating the schism In the Macedonian
camp.
Reports received here to-day from Dub
nitza announced increased vigilance on
the part of the authorities and the police
of that ?lace.
Bulgarian official circles are evidently
much Impressed by the menacing attitude
of the United States Government in the
Stone affair. They declare, however that
they are unable to do any more in the
matter than they have done already. *

PROGRAMME OF THE SENATE.
Matters of Great Public Interest Soon
to Be Considered. \
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.â One of the first
measures of national interest which will
be introduced in the Senate at the session
which will begin to-morrow will be a reso
lution looking to public action concerning
the death of President McKinley. Thi3
will be presented on Tuesday by either
Senator Foraker or Senator Hanna, prob
ably the former, and after its introduction
the Senate will adjourn Immediately as a
mark of respect to the memory of the
dead President. The annual message of
President Kooseveit will not be received
unuui Tuesday, and on tms account the
session or Monday will De exceedingly
brief. It is not uow expected that any
thing will be done on tnac day beyond tne
announcement of the death of Senator
Kyle, following wmch tne Senate, in ac
cordance with custom, will adjourn lor
the day.
On Tuesday the President's message will
be read, and alter its reading tne an
nouncement of the death of President Mc-
Kinley will follow at once, whereupon un
der the precedent estabhsned when Presi
dents Lincoln and Garfleld died resoiu
tions providing for the appointment of a
committee to act with a similar commit
tee of the House of Representatives to
take appropriate action relative to the
matter, ana then calling for immediate
adjournment for the day will be adopted.
Heretofore committees have been appoint
ed to arrange the details of public exer
cises, and it is understood that plan will
be pursued in this instance, and tnat later
in the session some public man of dis
tinction will be invited to deliver a eulogy
in the Capitol.
Wednesday and Thursday will be de
voted to the introduction of new bills,
and as usual there will be a flood of them.
Among the first bills of Importance to be
presented will be the ship subsidy bill,
which will be introduced by Senator Frye,
and the Nicaraguan canal bill, which Sen
ator Morgan will present. Senator Frye,
has not entirely completed his bill, but he
said to-day that it would be different in
many details from the old bill of last ses
sion; that measure was* framed by former
Senator Edmunds. Senator Frye himself
is the author of the new bill. Senator
Morgan's canal bill will be a duplicate of
Representative Hepburn's bill on â¢ the
canal question. Other early bills of Im
portance will be one looking to the con
struction of a submarine cable from the
western coast of Hawaii and another pro
viding for the establishment of a new
executive department to be known as
the Department of Commerce. On Thurs
day the Senate will adjourn until the fol
lowing Monday.
The general opinion among Senators is
that very little real work will be done be
fore the Christmas holiday. The rirst
subject demanding attention is recipro
city. Various treaties are now pending
in the Senate looking to commercial agree
ments between the United States and
other countries. Senator Aldrich will re
new his effort to have these .treaties,
which already have been reported from
the Committee on Foreign Relations, re
ferred to the Committee on Finance, on
the ground that they deal with tariff ques
ions. The friends of the treaties will op
pose this demand and the preliminary
skirmish expected to ensue probably will
serve to develop some Interesting features.
The early days of the session -will be
marked by the reorganization of the Sen
ate committees so far as may be neces
sary, and a caucus I of the Republican
members will be held to-morrow for the
purpose of considering this question and
appointing a committee to suggest names
for the vacancies. The most important
place to be filled la that of chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations. It
is generally conceded that Senator Cul
lom, who is the senior Republican mem
ber of that committee, will succeed ta
the chairmanship.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE HOUSE

tion of Officers..
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.â The pro
gramme for the opening day*in the House
to-morrow, although It will follow rigidly
routine precedents, will be . Interesting,
and, to a certain extent, picturesque. Ad
missions to the galleries will be by card,
of which two* have been issued to each
member, and the galleries will no doubt
be crowded to their fullest capacity. The
desks of the popular members will be
laden with flowers. The clerk of the
House will call the members to order at
noon, and after prayer by the 'chaplain
the roll will be called by States.
The Speaker will be formally elected
and escorted to the chair by a committee.
General Henderson, whose re-election as
Speaker is assured, will then address the
Hous& after which Bingham of- Penn
sylvania, father of the House (a titular
honor conferred upon the oldest member
in point of continuous service), will ad
minister the path to him. The Speaker,
in turn, will administer the oath to the
members-elect. The old .officers of the
House, who were'rechosen by the Repub
lican caucus, will then be re-elected and
sworn in. Following this resolutions will
be adopted to appoint committees to In

BOISE, Idaho,\Dec. 1.â Governor Hun.
has replied to Governor Van Sant's letter
asking Idaho to aid in fighting the North
ern railway consolidation. "
His letter In part is as follows:
I agree with your views as to the danger of
this monstrous combination to the commercial
interests of all the territory through which
these lines may pass without competition, but
I regret to say. and. I think that sentiment Is
shared generally by the people of the Stat<;,
that Idaho has no constitutional provision or
legislative statute that ca^ be used to prevent
the consolidation of two or more corporations
of this kind. But I am able to state that this
question will be the subject, of "action by our
next Legislature and that you have the moral
support and sympathy of the people of this
State, who will pray to God to strengthen your
hands and give you the courage and persever

MODENA..TJtah,' Dec. 1.â Yesterday the
jury at Pioche, Nev., -returned -a, verdict
of assault and battery against seven of
the two houses has assembled and that
Congress is ready to receive any com
munication he may have to make. Reso
lutions to adopt temporarily the rules of
the last House and to fix the daily hour
of meeting also will precede the event of
opening day, the annual: seat drawing.
The President's message will be withheld
until Tuesday.
General Grosvenor of Ohio probably will
make the announcement to the House of
the death of the late President McKinley,
and offer the resolutions upon which the
House will act. * â¢ â  .
On Tuesday that portion of the Presi
dent's message referring to the. death, of
McKinley probably will be 'referred to a
select committee to arrange a programme
of eulogies. It is a remarkable â¢ coinci
dence that . McKinley was the chairman
of the committee which arranged the
programme when President Garfleld died.
Blalne pronounced the eulogy upon that
occasion. Elihu.B. Washburn was chair
man when Lincoln died, and George Ban
croft, the historian, was the orator. After
Tuesday the House probably will ad
journ three .days at a time until Con
gress recesses for the Christmas holidays.
Speaker Henderson will occupy this time
preparing his committee lists, which will
be announced as soon- as the House con
venes after the holidays. Practically no
business will be /transacted, before . the
holidays. ' , -

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE â¢ NATION AND THE PRESIDING OFFI
CERS OF SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, "WHOSE
RESPONSIBILITIES INCREASE BY CONVENING OF CONGRESS.
ing statement of its purpose and effects
has been issued: â¢
The'purpose of this proposed legislation Is
to prevent the further free use In common of.
the public 'domain in the arid grazing region,
and thereby to prevent the destruction of the
forage by overstocking- the same, by which
process the land Is becoming desert, the country
more arid, and springs. and watercourses losing
their flow. Used free find In common, the West
ern ; range is practically without law, and the
competitors -for Its occupancy attempt to, hold
It" against each other by violence and armed
force,' causing the destruction of life and prop
erty. This domain belongs to all of the people,
but has been used by a few as' a means of
acquiring , wealth, without compensation to the
rest of the owners. The availability of the re
gion - involved ! for agricultural settlement has
been' injured by the Increase of Its aridity that
has â¢ followed the extirpation â¢ of its covering of
grasses and ; forage plants, and the land's po
tentiality as 'a producer of wealth will disap
pear unless It is protected by law and Us users
.are, compelled to pay for and protect what they
occupy. â¢ ' '"â¢ '
...The. proper policy of this Government Is the
encouragement of settlers to occupy all parts
of- the.publlc domain upon which families may
gain -a living. To this end the proposed law
reserves all. the rights of the homestead set
tler. The Government encourages the adven
turous â  mineral - prospector, and this law re
serves all 1 his rights to make mineral entry
In any part of the domain that it covers.
Besides these prospective entrymen there are
existing' rights that must be protected.
.The present agricultural settler, who tills
land, raises crops and keeps domestic stock,
finds under, the present system of free use of
the public domain that flocks and herds are
driven upon hls"freehold, consume the forage
upon which his domestic animals should feed
an* Inflict such Injury upon him that he ts fre
quently constrained to sacrifice his property and
seek "another location, only to be again over
taken by the same intolerable conditions. The
proposed j law gtves him the â  preference of ' a
leasehold on abutting public domain, which he
may . protect from the trespasses which now
Injure him;,-:- - - >. '.
.The. next preference Is given to freeholders
whose pursuits are pastoral, to protect them
selves In. like manner, from nomads, and secure
the â¢ range needed for their stock. ' ,
â¢ Lands not taken by either of the foregoing
classes of freeholders shall be subject to lea.se
by stockgrowers who were In use . and occu
pancy during the year ending on January 1,
1901; each , to . have a leasehold In proportion to
his interest, ro that none, not even the least,

CONTINUED TRADE ACTIVITY.
GENERAL trade showed no material change
last week. The country's bank clearances
exhibited a slight gain of 9.2 per cent over
the corresponding week last year, the gain at Ne*v
York falling to an increase of only 7.4 per cent, while
Boston, Baltimore aud New Orleans showed small
losses. The largest gain of the most important citie3
was 427 per cent at San Francisco. The failures for
the week were 198, against 184 last year, and were
generally small and unimportant.
Wall street was quiet during the week, and the only
incident \vaÂ« a sharp break in copper stock (due to
the reported cutting of prices for copper) to the low
est point 5ir.ee the floating of the Amalgamated Cop
per coinbiiic. Otherwise the street was featureless.
The recent exports of gold to Europe, as previously
mentioned, have hed no effect on the market, as the
stock of monetary gold in the country November I
was about Si.I/O.cjoOjOOo, which is being continually
augmented by Pacific Coast receipts from Alaska and
Australia and the regular home production, so, as
one New York banker puts it, "the exit of a few
millions to Europe need cause no concern, especially
as it will afford relief in Europe, where most needed."
The same authority says of the current occasional
shrinkages in Wall street: "Had prices been allowed
to react to a mort. natural basis in response to the
United States Steel strike, the corn crop disaster and
the assassination of President McKinley we sho'tld
have now an excellent situation for legitimate activity
and advancing prices, but the powerful and persistent
manner in which the market was sustained against
those adverse iaclois made outside buyers hesitate."
The merchandice business of the country is proceed
ing smoothly, apparently regardless of what is going
on in Wall rtrcet. Scarcity of rolling stock ra the
great railroads is still hampering the output and mar*
keting of many manufactured products, and .some
iron mills have been obliged to dose down, not be
cause of lack of business, but wholly owing to their
inability to obtain engines and cars to deliver their
output. Yet the different works are turning out cars
an4 engines as fast as they can. This condition, while
working hardships in some individual cases, speaks
well for the activity in trade throughout the country.
As far as the call for goods is" concerned, it seems
as if the country never would get iron and steel
enough to satisfy the demand, which is breaking all
records, in spite of the increased production and the
recent advance in prices. The textile trades are re
ported in better condition, there having been large
sales of cotton goods for China, which have materi
ally increased* the export valuations of this product
for the year. The woolen : mills a # re: also actively em
ployed and the retailers and jobbers report a brisk
call for heavyweight goods. The boot and shoe trade
continues to send out good reports, most of the New
England mills being in operjton,' with an active de-,
mand for their output. Wheat has not changed much
during the past week, the price having been sustained
by the strength in the minor grains, which are scarce
throughout ,the West and Southwest, and by the re
appearance of the French as buyers in the American
markets. Thus it will be seen that the 'trade situation
is favorable all around.
Locally there is nothing new. The recent rains
throughout the central and northern .portions of the
State have enhanced the general feeling of confidence,
and the sale of over 20,006,000 pounds of prunes at
San Jose to an Eastern syndicate has infused new life
and strength into the dried fruit market.' Exporters,
wholesalers and jobbers all report a good demand for
merchandise, with easy collections,- and the retailers
are doing a brisk holiday trade. The situation in this
city and State is fully as flattering as in any other
section of the United States, which is saying a good
deal. ,
Tolstoy says that after, working in the fields he can
do his mental" work better thah'wheh he gives' his
whole day to that kind of work, which is equivalent to
saving that when in the fields he doesn't toil very
bard. . SHIM
FEDERAL RELATIONS TO TRUSTS.
PUBLIC attention has been given to the report
that President Roosevelt intends making some
recommendation concerning- trusts in his mes
sage to Congress, while at the same time there seems
to have been a presentation of the question in the
Northwest, where the Governor of, a State threatens
to attack the recent railway combination.
While much has been said, little is really under
stood about this question of trusts, which, in the
many details of most interest to the public, is~tiot as'
complicated as might be supposed.
The jurisdiction of the Federal Government extends!:,
only to matters relating to interstate affairs... Where
the question lies wholly within "the territory of the
State no Federal question is involved.' ; : "
Congress, by the Sherman anti-trust law, passed in
1890, imposed stringent restrictions and penalties,
upon all contracts in restraint of trade, and upon com
binations and monopolies; but of course the applica
tion of this act was limited to the Federal questions,
that is, interstate questions. It wifl b\ remembered
that some time since, in this city, the Coal Trust was
prosecuted in the Cifcuit Court presided over by
Judge Morrow, and judgments and penalties were re
covered in the .litigation, and it will also be remem
bered th2tnot very long ago the United States Su
preme Court affirmed the judgment of the .lower
courts which held that the great Traffic Association of
the Eastern railways was void..
There are a number of corporations recognized and
existing by virtue of Federal franchises, it toeing held
that the power, to create such Federal corporations
was necessary in order that the Government might
carry out its constitutional powers; but 30 one has
ever for one moment contended that the Federal Gov
ernment could clothe a Federal corporation with
authority which would authorize it to invade the terri
tory of any State and there assume corporate func
tions without the direct permission of the State itself,
except where the business was between the States.
A Federal railway corporation seeking to enter the
boundaries of California is subject to all .the regular
tions appertaining to all railways in the State of Cali
fornia. It can acquire its land only in the manner
pointed out for all railways, and, in fact, possesses no
immunity from State control except where, by virtue
of its extension through other States, it acquires that
interstate character which makes its interstate rates
and freights a matter of Federal control.
Foreign corporations, that is to say, corporations
organized under the laws of other States or of for
eign countries, have no power nor right to enter the
territory of any State and perform or do any business
within that State except by permission of the. State
itself. They exist in all other places than the place of
organization only as a matter of comity and not of
right.
The constitution of this State provides only that
foreign corporations shall not be allowed to do busi
ness in the State of California on any more favorable
terms than are. allowed to domestic corporations.
' From all of this it would seem that the question of
trusts, except in so far as a Federal corporation is
engaged in a Federal enterprise, that is to say, be
tween States, is entirely subject to and can be "con
trolled by the Legislature of the State. They may be
debarred from entering and doing business within
the State, -and why is this not a practical solution of
the trust problem?
In Texas, which has gone as far, if not farther, than
any other one State concerning the anti-trust propo
sition, a statute was passed which provided that any
corporation holding a charter under the laws of the
State of Texas which should violate any of the provi
sions, should forfeit its charter and cease to exist, and
that every_foreign corporation violating the same pro
vision! should be denied* the right and prohibited
from doing business witltin the State. This law was
upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States,
and illustrates that proper legislation by the State 'of
California will present to the people the solution of
much annoyance resulting from corporate combina-.
tions.
An anti-trust law placing proper restrictions upon
foreign corporations, honestly enforced, would obvi
ate most of the objectionable features of the trust
question, so far as the sale of the product of such
combinations in this State is concerned.^
FOGS AND DISASTERS.
BY. the awful accident of Saturday evening, when
.the ferry boat Sausalito ran into the San Ra
fael and sank her, one more lesson was given
of the urgent need for the invention of some adequate
method of guarding against the dangers of fogs. At
the present time we know of nobetter safeguards for
ships than those of moving slowly and keeping the
whistles sounding. It appears that both of those pre
cautions were taken by each of the colliding boats
during the heavy fog of Saturday evening, but they
availed little: In that fact there is nothing of novelty
and no occasion for surprise. On the foggy Atlantic,
and particularly around the British isles, where the
waters are crowded with shipping, accidents of' the
kind are numerous, and it is now recognized that slow
movement and fog whistles do not afford sufficient
security for ships in times of dense fog. - â  .
The hurnan mind is not accustomed to rely upon
a single sense for the understanding of any phenom
enon. The eye habitually helps the ear to determine"
from what direction and from what distance a partic
ular sound comes to us. When sight is" obscured by.
a fog and we hear a sound coming to us out of the
darkness we cannot readily locate the position from
which the sound comes. Hence the frequent disas
ters that occur at such times.. The officers of each
ship may hear the fog whistles of the other and yet
never know exactly. where the approaching vessel is
until it is so near that collision is inevitable.
'Â» Over and over again efforts have been. made. to de
vise a certain method of determining at what distance.
two ships are from one another no matter how dense
the fog may be. Up to this time, however, all such
efforts have failed. Lately there have been great hopes r
that wireless telegraphy maybe found, efficacious in
solving. the problem.. It is believed that the apparatus
can be ; so 'arranged that vessels equipped; with* the
system would not only communicate with one another
automatically as soon as they came within a .fixed
distance, but that the instrument could be made to
disclose whether or no the ships were drawing nearer
after the first notice of approach, and thus .a clear"
warning be given v of '.the increasing danger/ 6f; colli
sion. It is to be hoped that these expectations will'
be fulfilled, for certainly some such method of giving
and receiving automatic warning is' sorely needed. ._
It is an old saying, "Accidents will happen in the
best regulated families." The wide acceptance of- the
proverb attests the. general belief that the complexi
i ties of life are such that no human foresight or 'care'
can guard against all possibility of accident^ We
must,' therefore, not be too prone to attribute fault. or.
blame for the accident of Saturday evening. In due
time there will be an official inquiry, and we shall then
learn -how far all precautions were exercised and _ to
what /extent there was negligence. With that evi-

Enough is. now known to show that we may' well
tie thankful the loss ,of life has .not been' far greater
than it was. .It might easily have ; been. that the dis
aster.would have carried mourning into hundreds of
homes. As it was, most of those involved in the dis
aster appear to have acted with as much of courage
and coolness as could be expected of any mixed mul
titude of men, women and children under such dire
ful conditions.- Taking the country as a whole, the
Thanksgiving week was marked by a series of ap
palling accidents. They occurred in fires in crowded
tenements, in mines and on railways. Our local .dis
aster, .which might easily have proven one of the most
destructive of human life, has been one of the lightest.
CONGRESSIONAL CAUCUSES.
FROM the proceedings of the caucuses of the
two parties preceding -the meeting of Congress
the public can form a fairly correct estimate of
the conditions under which -the two will enter upon
the work of. the session. 'In the Republican conven
tion' ; there .was : perfect harmony from first to last.
In the Democratic, caucus, 1 . on the other hand, there,
was displayed so much of dissension that certain reso
lutions submitted for adoption had to be got rid of
by referring them to a committee, because to have
put them to a vote would have resulted in a split.in
the party v then and there. â  .; ; -\" . #
As was expected, the Republican caucus unani
mously nominated General Henderson-for re-election
to the Speakership. In addition, all the officers wha
served during the late session were renominated.- It
is well known that Speaker v Henderson will make
very few changes in the House committees and none
in important places, consequently the House will be
ready to begin business about as soon as it is'organ
ized. ; , . ... â 
This harmony of action on'the part of. the majority
in Congress must be as gratifying to the country as
to the party. There is a great deal of important work
before Congress) and," to' accomplish any considerable
part of it, the session will have to be devoted to busi
ness from first to^ last. ': ; In' accepting his nomination
for : the: Speakership General Henderson said: "There
is always more activity at every Congress preceding
a Congressional election than at any other time. We
will require all the wisdom we possess and all the pa
triotism, for we have a great danger to confront, us
continually, and' that "is the surplus in the treasury.
I appeal to all my colleagues, Republicans, to keep
in mind that this is a danger, and that if we be wise in
the presence of that danger we will find approval of
the American people." From that speech it will be
seen that the Speaker will enter upon the work of
the session with a true appreciation -of the difficulties
before'.him. and no better guarantee could be given of
faithful work from start to finish.
. The Democratic caucus was notable, first, because
with two exceptions all those members of Congress
who have hitherto ' called themselves Populists
dropped their pretensions to form a third party and
entered the caucus as Democrats. On the surface
that looked something like the establishment of har
mony among the various elements of the opposition,
but the appearance was deceptive. Representative
McClellan of New York introduced a series of resolu-.
tions outlining a policy to be pursued by the opposi
tion during the session. No sooner were they read
â than a row began. Mr. Ball of Texas offered as. a
substitute the Kansas City platform. A discussion
ensued. Fitzgerald of New York said : "We ' can
never win if we do not discard 1 the heresy of free sil
ver." Mr. Ball of Texas replied: "We can never win
unles's'mcn calling themselves Democrats support the
national platforms of the Democratic party." Then,
for the sake of peace, Richardson of Tennessee, who
was nominated as the party . candidate for Speaker,
moved that all resolutions be referred to a committee,
which was agreed to, and the row ended for the time.
The various resolutions, or at least a report of the
committee concerning them, will be submitted to the
caucus at a meeting to be.ljeld early in January. At
that time an ; attempt will be made to formulate a
party policy with respect to the Philippines, ship sub
sidies, currency .legislation and- other important
measures likely to be taken up during the session. If
anything approaching. harmony of action be manifest
at that caucus we shall be able to learn from it what
will be the main features of the Democratic platform
in the elections' next fall. If, however, there should
be discord, everything will be in as much confusion
as ever, and we shalMiave to face once more a politi
cal guerrilla warfare, with a different Democratic pol
. icy to the front in every district.
GATHMANN AND HIS GUN.
BETWEEN -Inventor Gathmann and the army
officers who made the test of his great gun
there has developed a considerable difference
of opinion concerning the results of the test. It ap
pears the officers deem the gun and its peculiar am-:
munition to be virtual failures, while the' inventor is
reported as asserting that the merit of the weapon
was 'conclusively demonstrated.
The gun is 'one of the costliest and largest ever
constructed. It is, in fact, the largest of guns firing
the modern shell. It is 44 feet long, weighs 59. tons,
has an 18-inch bore and; fires a projectile 71 inches
long weighing 1830 pounds. : The shell contains
about 500 pounds of guncotton, and 4he theory is
that when the shell. strikes a vessel the force of the
exploding guncotton would be sufficient to shatter
it into instant wreck. In the tests made at Sandy
Hook the target was broken, but the army experts
after inspecting the extent 'of the ' damage came to
the conclusion that it was caused almost wholly by
the impact of the maasive shell. itself and not by the
exploding "guncotton. Should that judgment stand
the gun will . have to be classed as a failure, for the
great merit claimed for it by the inventor is its" power
to discharge a- shell *so loaded that when it bursts
oiothing that floats could withstand it if struck by it.
Mr. Gathmann in defending the showing made by
theguiiin the tests said' that while the first shot'fired
was not effective either of the; other two would have
sunk â¢ any battle-ship. The â¢ second shot, he alleges,
"drove back the plate of the target thirty-three inches
at. one end and a foot at the other, while the third
broke theplate in two from top to bottom and drove
if, back still . farther with its cofferdam structure
crushed and the timber braces smashed." . Had the
target been a battle-ship, he said, nothing could have
stopped. the incoming water, while the explosion of
the guncotton would have killed everybody on
board. - â  . /
.Such is the inventbr's side of the story. ' Perhaps
in. thV end. the Government may be induced to pay
the cost of. another test, though such things come
high. >

BRITISH ADMIRALTY INVESTIGATING
A STRANGE GUN PRACTICE ACCIDENT
THE terrible accident on board the British battleship
Royal Sovereign while at gun practice, November 10, ore
the Greek coast, Is being inquired into, and in the mean
time the cause remains somewhat mysterious. One om
cer. Captain Spurway of the marine artillery, and five
men were killedâ Commander R. Arbuthnot, Lieutenant James
and seven men more or less severely injured and ten men were
slightly hurt. The accident occurred with a six-inch shell, and
it was first reported that the breech had not been closed when
the shell was discharged, which, however, .is unlikely. An offi
cer gives his views in the London Chronicle and discards the
idea that the shell ceuld have been ignited by any fragment ox
smoldering cartridge left in the gun from the previous shot.
The probability is that there was a misfire; that Is to say, tne
shell had failed to go off when fired by electricity. It is the
rule when a misfire occurs to allow a certain time to lapse be
fore opening the breech, but in this case the time allowance
may have been insufficient and the charge went off just as the
breech was opened. Electricity; plays stiange pranks and may
in this case be the cause of the accident.
The British cruiser Thetis, '3400 tons, built in 1890 and first
-commissioned in July, 1892, has been -overhauled at a cost of
$65,000. Her steam trial of six hours under forced draught came â¢
off October 19 and gave results far in excess of the estimates.
The horsepower, was 112 short of 9000 calculated, but the speed
averaged 21.75 knots, an excess of 1.75 knots. The ship made
about 20.5 knots on her trial in September, 1891. and the recent
outlay appears to have been a good investment.
The damage to the armored cruiser Eurayalus by-fire some
months ago while under completion at Barrows has been sup
plemented with another accident. The ship was docked at
at Birkenhead fwhen the keel blocks canted and the vessel s
bottom , was greatly damaged.- The keel, - frames, inner and
outer skin, will have to be renewed. from the stern to tho en
gine-room,- involving an expense of $500,000.
â  â¢ The London Engineer states that the Admiralty contemplates
changes in administration v/hich v/ill in a measure throw open
the designing of ships to public competition.
New records have been made with the British 9.2-inch and
12-inch guns, from which it appears that the former can dis
charge two 380-pound projectiles every thirty seconds, and the
12-inch gun can fire a projectile weighing 850 pounds at the rate
of one in thirty seconds. ;â  > !;.'*'Â£ ?.-
The Japan Gazette of . November 2 states that the Uraga
Dock Company is reported to have received an order from
the -American Government to construct six gunboats for
use in the' Philippines, and that Sakurai Jozo, an official
of the company, left for America on October 24 to se
cure the contracts. The cost of .these gunboats is esti
mated at from $75,000 to $100,000 each. The foundation
for this report is probably the recent recommendation
of the Secretary of the Navy that six gunboats . of about
200 tons and' of light draught be built for service in the Phil
ippines. The late Congress did not authorize any such vessels

House of Whalebone.
A resident of Philadelphia, who has just
returned from a visit in Charleston, says
that a summer house made from tho
bones of a giant whale, with the jaw-bone
entrance large enough for a man on
horseback to ride In without bending his
neck, is an attraction on Sullivans Island,
just across the bay from Charfes ton, S.
C. Selections of "ribby" backbone ara
used for comfortable seats in this unique
resting place, and Captain John H. Dev
ereaux, In whose handsome lawn the curi
osity stands, has refused an exorbitant
price from a museum anxious to buy it
for perpetual preservation. The shrill
winds from the sea and the great waves
which frequently ride through the Island
In the hurricane season have added the
bleach to what was once the monster
whale of the South Atlantic waters.
This whale was captured in the harbor
of Charleston after a most desperate sea
battle. With steamers and. tugs and row
.boats running close and pouring in show
ers-of lead, the sea monster had to sub
mit and his mighty head was laid low.
When the whale turned into the harbor
entrance and swam toward the wharves
and tha battery he played out by the
"Grave Yard," where the water was deep
est. He was cutting and plowing through
the water when the pilots picked him. off
with the glasses, and the word went out
forthwith that an enemy was within tha
bar. The small boats moved cautiously
toward the "Grave Yard," where the sea
monster was cutting antics la twelve
fathoms of water, and when the attack
ing force increased in numbers the battlo
was begun. Every missile and every
weapon within reach was used with mora
or less effect on his whaleshlp. When his
snout was lifted above the water his
troubles started afresh and the attack
ing party closed in. The animal could not
withstand the attack, and his life blood
drained out. Then his body drifted back
and forth with the changing tide and
lodged on the Island beach.
Wagons loaded with cordwood came up.
and this was placed around the whale,
while buckets of oil assisted the fires to
burn. Out of the ashes the great bones
were saved, and the pick of them were
secured by Captain Devereaux. who
planned the ' summer house by his gate. J
The chief credit for the death of the
whale was due to General Wilmot de
Saussure and Captain Frank Porcher, two
expert sportsmen of Charleston.
Wife's Loyal Repartee.
It was at a National Methodist gather
ing, where the , much-mooted question of
the right of women to a seat in the con
ference was under discussion.
Chancellor J. R. Day, now the head of
Syracuse (N. Y.) University, was one of
the prominent speakers and he wasn't at
all in favor of the women. He said so
in language that was unmistakable.
A woman in the audience, the wife of
another well-known man, who- has been â 
a professor in a Methodist institution, f
was highly Incensed at Dr. â¢ Day's re
marks. When he concluded she turned
to the lady seated next to her and said
with emphasis: "Well, I'm glad that Dr.
Day isn't my husband!"
"So am I," the unknown lady respond
ed, and then she added, with a quiet
smile,, "because he happens to be mine."
"You keep half a dozen of U3 dangling
after you," groaned the young man, de
spairingly, "and give each one just
enough encouragement to make him hope
he's the favored one. Pardon me for say-
Ing so, but you are what the boys would
call pretty smooth."
"Well, what else would you naturally
expect me to be?" said the handsome Miss
Slick, looking at him archly.
And he was her .willing - slave again.â

FISCHER'S HALL
FOR BURLESQUE
Concert House to Be Re
modeled Into a
Theater.
Fischer's concert house is to be tufned
into a high-class buslesque theater, mod
eled after the famous Weber & Fields and
the Victoria theaters in New York. Not
only will the handsome structure become
a counterpart of Weber & Fields', but in
appointments the management Intend to
duplicate as far as possible the burlesque
successes that have made the New York
house famous. A burlesque stock com
pany which will embrace some of the best
stars in the country will be organized.
Mr. Fischer has taken W. C. Rebman in
to the scheme as a partner and the firm
will be known as Fischer, Rebman & Co.
S. H. Friedlander, the local theatrical
man, has been selected as manager for
the new amusement concern. He will
have sole charge of the burlesque pro
ductions.
Plans fcr the remodeling of the big con
cert hall have already been let and work
on the new theater will commence Imme
diately. The interior of, the concert hall
will be completely changed. A row of pri
vate boxes, encircling the entire house,
will be built under the first balcony and
another balcony will be built above, thus
increasing the seating capacity. New
opera chairs will be installed throughout
the entire house, from the last row In
the top balcony down to the first In the
orchestra.
The cost of the alterations will proba
bly run up in the neighborhood of $50,000.
The stage and proscenium will be greatly
enlarged to accommodate the biggest of
productions. A new electric light plant
â¢will be put in. together with a big switch
board and moaern novelty light-produc
ing appliances. The dressing rooms will
be downstairs under the stage. The en
tire floor of the concert hall will be taken
up and a new ore laid, sloping: gradually
toward the stage so that the people in
the rear can have an unobstructed view
of the players.
The new theater will be opened on or
about March 13.

Result.
While Sergeant Duke and Policemen
Young and Prendergast were standing- on
the corner of Twenty-fourth and Valen
cia streets about 4 o'clock yesterday
morning they saw two men come out of
a small back alley running from Twenty
fourth to Twenty-fifth streets, between
Valencia and Bartlett.
The men walked in the direction of the
Officers, but upon observing them they
turned and ran up Bartlett street to
Guerrero and into a vacant lot. They
jumped the fence and disappeared. Ser
geant Duke called to them to halt and
tired several shots st the taller of the
two to intimidate them.
A thorough search of the neighborhood
was made by the officers, reinforced by
others from the Seventeenth-street sta
tion, but no trace of the men could be
found. It Is supposed they were either
burglars or foorpads and were afraid of
being arrested.

MERRY COMEDY
AT CALIFORNIA
Bill at the Orpheum Con
tains Many Excellent
Numbers. Â»
Entertaining Plays Are on
This Week at All the
Theaters.
It was a big audience that packed the
California last night to laugh over the
funny complications of "A Stranger In
a Strange Land." -Fun reigned from the
rise to the fall of the curtain, at times
the laughter becoming so vociferous as
to delay. the action on the stage. It is
without doubt as good a farce as we have
yet had here, and the presenting com
pany is exceptionally clever.
An American Indian forms a conspicu
ous feature of "A Stranger in a Strange
Land." There is a real Indian and "two
bogus ones, and the complications that
arise from mistaken Identity are intense
ly ludicrous. The fun is so clean and
wholesome that one cannot fail to enjoy
this farce from Â» first to last. William
Friend, who has to do all the lying in
the farce, is very dexterious in the art,
and manages to wiggle out of the tight
est corners with a smoothness that is as
tonishing.
Charles Drake is very unctuous In the
part of the old uncle who Is always get
ting into scrapes, and F. J. Donnelly as
the real Indian gives a characterization
that is positively startling. The parts are
all well sustained, and the entire action
goes with a swiftness that fs only at
tained through long familiarity with th'e
different roles. Big business should be
the rule this week at the California. â¢
Next Sunday night S. Miller Kent fol
lows in Clyde Fitch's famous comedy "A
Cowboy and a Lady," which has never
been out to the coast before.
* â¢ â¢ '
There is a good show at the Orpheum
this week. The Dumond Parisian Min
strels is about as funny a combination as
has appeared here in some time. There
are three in the troupe v and each one Is
a clever musician. They sing and per
form on several stringed instruments and
while doing so amuse the audience by
their facial contortions. Their appear*
ance on the stage is a signal for great
aDplause, as their makeups are most gro
tesque.
Mile. Taglione is a good dancer and her
terpsichorean efforts are enhanced by at
tractive stage settings. The turn of Wer
den and Shepherd, illustrated song voc -.1
ists, met with a hearty reception. The
pictures illustrating the songs sung are
wonderful reproductions. Andy Lewis,
tae "Cocaine Fiend," is still on the bill
and is as popular as ever. The Kauf
manns and Goleman's trained dogs and
cats are still favorites of the audience.
La Belle Tortajada, vocalist and dancer,
did not appear last night, owing to sud
den illness. She will appear to-night;
j At the" Columbia Theater this evening
! the attraction will be the much-talked-of
! French farce from the Criterion Theater,
! New York, entitled "The Girl From Max
im's." From all accounts it is a lively
and laughable piece and well presented by
the company organized for Its interpreta
tion which As headed by Lena Mervllle
â¢in the role of Praline. "The Girl From
'Maxim's" is from the pen of George Fey
deau, author of the other clever farce,
"The Gay Parisians." Besides Miss Mer
ville the company includes Florence Ger
ald, W. H. Turner, Joseph Allen. J. H.
Armstrong, Harry Dull and twenty oth
ers. The next attraction for the Colum
bia will be Jefferson de Angelis and a big
musical organization in "A Royal Rogue."
The sale of seata for the engagement of
Misa Minnie Sellgrnan at the Grand Op
era-house Opens this morning. It is ex
pected that this engagement will be one
of the most successful in the history of
the theater. The first play to be present
ed will be "The Crust of Society," and
the opening performance will be given
Friday evening, December 6. There will
be the usual Saturday and Sunday mati
ness and the same popular prices will pre
vail.
The Alcazar Theater has an excellent
attraction this week In Robert Stephens'
romantic drama, "An Enemy to the
King." The drama takes for its presenta
tion almost the whole resource of the Al
cazar's strong company and will be ac
ceptably mounted and staged. Next week
"Christopher Jr." will be put on.
Russian melodrama gives way to the
home variety at the Central Theater this
week, with the "Streets of New York" as
the current bill of fare.. The cast will be
up to the usual mark and the manage
ment advertises a realistic fire scene as
a feature of the performance. They do
that kind of thing most effectively at the
favorite uptown house, and the drama al
together should prove a strong attraction.
At the Tivoli, with the clever young Pol
lards, "The Geisha" will continue to re
main the programme for this week. "The
Geisha" has so far been the season's hit
with the Australian Opera Company. The
piece is presented in most effective
fashion and most of the alert youngsters
have made individual hits. Little Daphne
Pollard, aged 5 years, will be Wun HI,
the Chinaman, and is as clever as they
make them all round. This is a show for
children, though it is Just as entertaining
for their s^lf-denving escorts. But no
child should miss ft. The Juvenile Opera
Company remains but two weeks longer.
The sale of subscription Beats for the
series of three symphony concerts that
are to be given by the San Francisco
Symphony 8oclety will open this mornine
at Sherman & Clay's music store and will
close on Saturday next. The single sent
sale will open the following week. The
first concert of the series will take plane
on Friday afternoon, December 13. and the
following concerts on the afternoons of
January 10 and 17. There Is every Indi
cation of a large and substantial interest

morning the landlady, Mrs. Leonie Mof
fet, went to the room and finding the
door locked called to Frank Wheat, one
of her roomers,, who climbed through the

CHINESE MUST
PAY HEAD TAX
Prince Ching's Scheme
for Raising Indem
nity Fund;*
PORT TOWNSEND, Dec. 1.â Accord-
Ing to mail advices from the Orient, Chi
nese officials are resorting to all kinds
of means to raise money to assist in pay
ing the Indemnity agreed upon by the
powers. Beside a gigantic lottery scheme,
in which more than $1,000,000 is involved,
half of which will go into the indemnity
fund and half be given away In prizes,
and which scheme has received the sanc
tion of the court, it is now proposed by
Prince Ching to Impose a head tax on all
Chinese, whether residing within thfl
limits of the empire or in foreign coun
tries.
Prince Ching's plan, as submitted to
the court, is to send commissioners to all
foreign countries to collect the tax from
Chinese residents, claiming that, as .they
do not become citizens of other countries,
they should assist in paying the indemn
ity. Prince Chlng's project has created
considerable dissatisfaction In the south
ern provinces of the Chinese empire and
is liable to result in serious disturbances.
It is claimed that resident? nf the north
ern provinces were alone responsible for
the Boxer movement and that they
should be called upon to bear any ex
pense caused by their action. Chinese of
the southern provinces were friends of
the foreigners, 'and as most of the mer
chants in foreign countries are from the
southern provinces, the movement on foot
to resist the taxation for Indemnity is
rapidly gaining ground. It is said that
the Chinese abroad will refuse to pay
the proposed tax. â¢
Prince Chins, accordlnsr to Chinese pa
pers, says that if they refuse the burden
will fall upon their relatives in the
southern provfnees; that other oppressive
measures will be enforced against them
and that merchants abroad refusing, to'
pay the proposed tax wUl not be allowed
to return to their mother country and
Will be classified as traitors.
â  According to the Manila Times, Fiske
Warren of Boston, a Fillnino sympft
ihizer, who toured the United States with
Sixto Lopez, the FiHnlno emissary, was
held ud by the United States commission
upon his arrival at Manila, and. before
he was allowed his l*berty, was made to
hold up his right hand and swear that
he would refrain from any utterance or
action which would tend to incite resist
ance to his Government. "Warren accom
panied Rlxto Lopez as far as Hongkong,
where Lopez remained. Before Warren
left the steamer he was handed a cony
of the act paused by the commission with
reference to Lopez, after which he came
ashore under guard and- with -but -little
hesitation took the prescribed oath. War

dered the hymn "Good Night" while tho

brance. ,

OAKLND MEN
PLAY FAST BALL
Win the Last Game of
the League Season
Cleverly.
Oakland wound up the season of . the
California Baseball League at Recreation
Park yesterday by defeating the Sacra
xnentp team by a score of 3 to 2 in a game
replete â with sensational plays.
The Senators started" bravely, scoring
their two tallies in the first inning. Flood
â was given a pass to first and stole sec
ond. He scored on Stanley's two-bagger.
Stanley reached home on an overthrow
to first by Babbitt of Hotter' s hit to third.
The Oakland men accepted some seem
ingly impossible chances, which robbed
Sacramento of several runs. With two
men on bases in the third, Hoffer lined
out what looked like a safe hit. Mohler.
at second base, made a grand stop, throw
ing the batter out at tirsL In the sev
enth there was a chance to tie the score.
"With a man on second, Sheehan flew to
deep center. Dunleavy went after what
the spectators thought a safe hit. Dun
leavy just reached it. stopping the gal
lop of the two men, who were intent on
Xnaking a rapid trip around the bases.
Oakland's three runs were garnered in
the fourth Inning. Mohler, the first man
up, sent the ball to the left field fence.
xna.king third base by dint of hard runing.
Frances was given a pass to first. He
played well off the bag and Stricklett
threw to catch him. Francks started for
second, which he reached in safety, while
Jlohler scored, just beating the ball home.
Stricklett, the Sacramento pitcher, was
in the air by this time and sent Dun
leavy to first on a pass. Dunleayy stole
second, Devereaux missing the bail which
â¢was thrown him. Francks scored on the
play.
With two men out and the score a tie.
Dunleavy took one of the most desperate
chances of the season. He played well off
third and as Stricklett pitched the ball he
started for home. Babbitt made connec
tion with the ball and sent it out to Flood
at second base. The ball fell a little short
and Flood failed to catch it. Dunleavy
scored. Babbitt retired the side, being
caught stealing second. This ended the
run getting. . Â«
Streib sent the ball to the cent* field
fence in the sixth inning and made only
one base on the hit. The ball struck the
fence ju?t at the angle and bounded back
nearly to second base. A few inches
either side and It would be good for at
least a double.
The Sacramento team was full of ginger
during the first half of the game. Davis
tried his best to rattle 'Waterbury, the
Oakland twirler. In this he failed. In the
fourth inning he put on a fiery red wig
and created much excitement.
The Senators secured only four hits off
Waterbury. This does not include one
Devereaux got in the side which took the
wind out of him. The score:

ALL AMERICAS
WIN AT SAN JOSE
With Heavy Stickwork
They Get Five Runs
in the Fifth. -
SAN JOSE, Dec. 1.â The tables were
turned on the National baseball leaguers
to-day by La Joie's All-America's, who
won the game by a score of 6 to 3.
This was an even break, in the two
games and gave San Joseans a chance to
judge both teams in all their plays. Al
though not such a fast and snappy game
as that played yesterday, there were as
many brilliant plays and more. heavy bat
ting. The two games just played are the
best exhibitions of ball ever given in this
city, and the local enthusiasts are hungry
for more. In fact, baseball has been given
such an impetus that steps may be taken
to put San Jose in the State League.
"Kube" Waddell did the pitching tor the
All-Americas and gave a superb exhibi
tion of his skill. He did not confine him
self to the box entirely, but fielded all
over the infield. He struck out five men
and allowed nine base hits.
Charley Doyle, a San Josean and a mem
ber of the Sacramento team, pitched for
the Nationals. His work almost equaled
that of his famed opponent. He struck
out five men and but ten hits were made
off his delivery. He seemed to have a
grudge against several of the men who
faced him, as he succeeded in hitting
three of them.
La Joie, whose fame Is second to none
other, played a great game. His style of
playing was greatly admired. The stick
work of both teams was terrific. Nineteen
base hits were made in the game. Stein
feldt secured a three-bagger. La Joie two
two-baggers and Davis and Chance one
each. Bradley, the third baseman of the
All-Americas, made three base hits.
Steinfeldt. Van Haltren and Carr also did
eood stickwork.
The All-Americas made the first score
in their halt of the second. They were
tied by the Nationals in the fourth. TerÂ«
rifle batting by the All-Americas secured
five runs in the fifth. The Nationals
made another run in their half of â  the
inning and scored again in the seventh.
The score follows: Â»

Still Discuss Henley Regatta.
LONDON, Dec. 1.â The decision of the
Henley stewards to admit foreign crews
to the regattas receives much attention
from the Sunday papers. A Cambridge
man, .writing to the Sunday Times, says:
"The features of American life which
Dickens caricatured are dead. The typi

DENSE FOG AND HEAVY SEAS
DAMAGE SHIPS ALONG COA5T
ALL kinds of craft seemed to have
a bad time of it Sunday. The Co
lumbia came in with her starboard
deckhouses stove in and her cab-
ins flooded. The Argyll was in
trouble off port early in the morning, the
Examiner newspaper boat, was stalled in
Oakland Creek and the launch Crowley
went ashore at Bakers Beach, the cap
tain thinking he was at Tiburon. It took
the tug Liberty to get the Crowley into
deep water again.
It was not until 11 a. m. before. the fog
began to lift, and then it came up only
an inch at a time. By ,2 p. m., however,
the bay was clear enough for the ferry
boats to resume their regular runs. The
first to take up her schedule was the Sau
salito, and later the Tiburon joined in
and then came the Oakland boats.
HEAVY WEATHER ON THE BAB.
Steamship Columbia Had Hard Time
Leaving Astoria.
The steamship Columbia, which arrived
from Portland Yesterday, had a hard time
of it crossing out. When on the Colum
bia River bar she was struck by three
seas in succession and at one time the
crew feared she was gong down. The
cabins and fireroom were flooded, and
the firemen had to seek the upper deck
in a hurry. About. fifty feet of the cabin
was â¢carried away, and Captain Doran
had to study his charts in three feet of
water.
When the Columbia came in yesterday
she looked as thougn a cyclone had
struck her, and the passengers will one
and all swear that a cyclone alone was
responsible for the damage. .
Panama Steamship Arrives.
The Panama Railroad Company's Ar
gyll arrived. from the isthmus yesterday.
She brought only three cabin passengers,
but had eighteen in the steerage. The
vessel had an experience with an earth
quake in midocean about two months
ago. While at Panama the; officers of
the steamship saw boys of 10 and 12
years pressed into the military service
and children ndt , -ready to leave school
carrying a musket. The rebels seemed
to be getting the worst of the fight, and
no man in Panama could call his soul his
own. \:'-x.^'
. "Panama is all right Just the same,"
said one of the officers yesterday, "., "and I
think the canal will go through."
Water Front Notes.
The steamship Meteor was. delayed on
account of the fog, but got away yester
day for the Sound.
The Hyades was also delayed, but got

NARCISSUS WINS
CHAMPION STAKE
Beats Palo Alto After
Being Led Many
- Lengths.
Palo Alto, Eugene Geary's fast grey
hound, incurred the displeasure of his
many backers yesterday at Union Park
by losing the final course of the Cham
pion event when, by the least effort, he
could have won the stake.
Palo Alto went to the slips with Curtis'
Narcissus for the final. He had beaten
Sir Pasha handily and had refused the
crack Rector a point in his earlier runs
in short order, both courses consuming
but forty seconds.
The speedy work of the champion
showed he was on edge and the wise ones
were eager to lay a to 1 that he could
dispose of Narcissus. An unusually strong
hare was liberated for the pair. Palo
2*10 took such a long lead up the field
that the crowd looked for a short course
and the speedy one to score a shutout.
Ten lengths in advance of .his opponent
Geary's dog made the turn and it seemed
the talent's hopes would be realized. After
scoring a few points the favorite showed
a disposition to lay off the game, and
finally by his laziness gave up his posi
tion to Narcissus. Curtis' dog was not
slow in scoring and kept out-working tho
champion. "When the flag was raised Nar
clssus had tallied eighteen points to Palo
Alto's thirteen.
Little Sister was looked upon as a
strong candidate for final honors, but be
cause of the withdrawal of Floodgate in
the second round ran a bye with her
brother, Sir Pasha. She was given such
a hard course that she had to De retired.
The talent was badly shaken by the de
feat of Rector in a bye In the first round.
Naughty Girl was his opponent and :n
ti.e minds of me wise ones the trial
looked so favorable to Curtis' youngster
that he was backed at 10 to 1 to win the
course. Rector led, but the Girl got pos
session and cleverly outworked him for
the flag.
In the open event the Curtis kennel
scored another victory. By the with
drawal of Royal Archer. Vulcan was de
clared the winner by default. The Pasha
kennels' entry had done good work, but
had hard courses with Master Clalr and
Sofala, a bye dog, that forced his retire
ment.
Sacramento Boy ran well, but lost to
Vulcan in a close course.
A lively lot of hares made hard cours
ing the rule and the relief dogs were
called out on many occasions.

PiNEY WOODS.
Healthful but Not Always Curative.
To go to the pir.ey woods is a help, but
if one carries along the bad habits of
food and drir.k that have caused sickness,
the piney woods will not produce a re-
covery.
Coffee drinking caused blindness in a
Virginia gentleman and his remarkable
experience is worth reading. "I have
been a coffee drinker since my earliest
pemembrance. Tf I missed coffee at a
â¢nreal It brought on headache. This
Kaould huve shown me that I was a vic-
tim to a drug habit. Finally, â¢wakeful,
restless nights came on. After dinner 1
was always drowsy and after sleeping
would waken stupid and morbid, and felt
as though I had been drugged, and when
â¢ this feeling wore off nervousness and
'""y"' stlc-fsncss would set in until I drugged
myself with coffee again.
"At last my eyesight began to fall.
Some of the best optical specialists
agreed that I had an affliction of the op-
flc nerve, and after two or three years
treatment my eyes slcv.ly lost Uieir pow-
er and I became almost sightless.
"I v.as advised to go to a pine woods
near the sea in a most isolated place.
This I did and lived there for two years
without any visible benefit. I gai-e up

DKAY'S DEATH IS MOURNED.
Former State Senator Popular in Sac
ramento County.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 1.â Expressions of
regret were general in this city to-day
over the death of ex-State Senator Find
ley R. Dray. Several weeks ago Mr.
Dray hurried after a street car. "When
he took his seat he suffered a fainting
spell, resulting from his exertion and a
weak heart. He was brought to his home
and his condition, though showing
marked improvement at times, remained
the subject of care up to his death,
which came unexpectedly.
Mr. Dray was in the fullest sense a
gentleman of the "old school" and his
appearance on the floor of the State Sen
ate, where he represented Sacramento
County for two terms, was finely impres
sive. He was honored in all walks of life
in Sacramento, which had been his home
since the early fifties. He held a position
under Sheriff James McClatchey, the vet
eran editor of the Bee, and this was the
beginning of his political career. After
leaving the Sheriffs office he served as
Public Administrator for eight years and
subsequently was twice elected County
Assessor and filled out an appointment
as Supervisor. After he had entered the
Sacramento Savings Bank as a director
he was, in 1S86, elected to the State Sen
ate, and such was. the confidence of the
people in his ability and integrity that he
was' called upon to servo a second term
as Senator.
Mr. Dray was a native of Pennsylvania
and 68 years of age. Besides his wife he
leaves four daughters, Mrs. George H.
Perry of Alameda, Mrs. Charles A. Cul
ver of New York, Mr3. James Warrlck
and Miss Alice Dray of Sacramento, and
three sons, Dr. Frank R. Dray of San
Francisco, Arthur F. and Bruce L. Dray
of Sacramento.
LACK OF HOSPITALITY
RESENTED BY SENATOR
Why the Yakima Indian Agent at
Fort Sinicoe Is to Lose Sis
Place.
TACOMA, Dec. 1.â An Interesting story
is told on good authority, in explanation
of the recommendation by Senator Foster
of Dr. Hare, a North Yakima Re
publican, to succeed Jay Lynch as
agent of the Yakima Indians at Fort Slm
coe. Hare's appointment Is expected, to
occur soon after Congress meets.
The undoing of Lynch is said to result
from his somewhat cool and inhospitable
treatment of Senator Foster on the oc
casion of the latter's visit last summer.
Senator Foster happened in one day to
look over the agency and investigate the
proposed opening of part of the Yakima
reservation. Agent Lynch did not seem
very much pleased to see him, but never
theless gave all required information
cheerfully. The agent's house is a email
one, not suited for the entertaining of im
portant personages. In consequence Sen
ator Foster was told after dinner that he
could not be very well taken care of and
would better spend the night at a hotel
near by. Senator Foster "did so, and left
the next day without taking formal leave.
At the first opportunity he took occasion
to recommend ! the appointment of Hare
to succeed Lynch.

Kill Herself After Family Quarrel.
YOUNG WIFE OF OAKLAND CIGAR DEALER WHO LEFT HIM AF
TER A QUARREL AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE

of herself and husband because
of a family tiff, Mrs. Sadie Camp
bell, the young wife of Daniel
Campbell, a cigar manufacturer of this
city, drank six ounces of ammonia this
afternoon at her residence, 963 Jefferson
street, in an attempt to commit suicide."
That death did not result was due to the
energetic measures of Dr. McRae and
Steward Harry Borchert at the Receiving
Hospital, to which Mrs. Campbell was
taken shortly after she drank the flery
fluid.
It was the news that her husband had
departed for Australia after selling out
his Interest in the Oakland Co-operative
Cigar Company, 467 Seventh street, to his
partner, O. A. Smith, that led tho despond
ent wife to give up hope and to attempt
suicide. She had determined that she
would never again see the man whom she
had left In anger, and there was nothing
more for her in life.
It was at the dinner table a week ago
that Mrs. Campbell and her spouse had
a tiff over what she said to-day was "only
a trifling family matter." Both were
angry, and the wife, in a fit of hot-head
edness, left the house, going to her
friends, the Newlands, in East Oakland,
i "They told me not to return to my hus
band but to make him come to me and
settle the quarrel," explained Mrs. Camp
bell. "So, Instead of going to him, I wrote
a note, saying he must come back to me
before I would make up with him.

heart to go after it.
"1 became so despondent that I threat
ened to end my life. There was nothing

thought of a separation forever. That is
why* I drank the stuff.

LONDON MARKET
REMAINS QUIET
Speculators Expect Bad
Break in Copper and
: , Silver â .Stocks, r
Discontent in the Industrial
Situation Causes
Stagnation.
LONDON, Dec. 1.â During the past
week the Stock Exchange has been any
thing but a cheerful resort. Money . baa
been decidedly tight, forcing borrowers
to have recourse to the bank.' Fortunate
ly, the ""Government's disbursements have
been larger for this week. Prance has
also shown a disposition to Increase her
balances in London, while the hope is
expressed that further gold will be forth
coming from New Torkv But with the
approach of the . year end and a large slice
of the last loan soon due there Is small
hope of easy money before well Into Jan
uary of next year. In the meanwhile busi
ness is as stagnant as ever.
The Industrial situation is' decidedly
bad. The "Welsh miners, who have been
stopping work in the blind hope of rals
ing-v prices by restricting the coal pro r
duction, have merely succeeded in irri
tating the owners, who now j threaten a
lockout, while the reported -uncertainty- of
the "Welsh situation has . thrown numer
ous steam coal contracts for Great Brit
ain and France into the hands of Ger
man and Amtrlcan competitors.
The copper situation is enveloped â¢ in
as much mystery as it has been for
months past, and there is a feeling in
the air that unfavorable developments
are imminent. Silver ls closely allied to
copper, and the present phenomenal de
cline in copper is taken to indicate* that
American interests, which are here be
lieved to have been maintaining artificial
ly high prices . are about to relax their
grip. A sharp break in both metals is
possible. - ' â¢
It is only fair to say that such gloomy
views are largely based upon the infer
ences of speculators, and are probably in
tensified by the general .discontent in the
industrial outlook and the never-ending
war in South Africa.
The situation in Germany adds a cer
tain encouragement. While it is believed
here that the worst of the German finan
cial crisis is, over the present industrial
stagnation in that country supports the
theory that "numerous small failures are
bound to be reported at Intervals for
months to come. Such an outlook is
scarcely encouraging for promoters.
There are rumors of a new German
loan, and it is said in some quarters that
the rumored loan will probably be issued
in February. /
THE FRENCHMEN LEADEBS
IN AERIAL NAVIGATION
Have Been Persistent and Daring in
Their Efforts Since the Year
1783. â  . . >
As far back as 1783 the French took an
active interest in aeronautics. In that
year two Frenchmenâ one of them of no
ble, bloodâ made an ascension that lasted
twenty, minutes. The passion for balloon
ing, we might say, has been hereditary
with the French. Nor does the fact that
Mr. Santos-Dumont is a Brazilian bv
birth militate against, our statement.
There -are no recognized aeronauts in
Brazil. The winner of the Deutsch 1 prize
is an air, sailor in consequence of his long
residence in Paris. : , â¢ â 
It would be an exaggeration to say that
aeronautics is a French sport,, yet in no
other country is it followed so persist
ently and so enthusiastically. Two years
ago an . aeronauts' club, the Aero Club,
was organized in Paris. During the ex
position some notable trips were made,
of which perhaps the most notable was
the race eastward from Vincennes. A bal
loon named the Centaur traveled from
the old French town to Korostlchef , in
the province of Kief, Russia, in thirty
nve and three-quarters hours. Another
balloon, the St. Louis, sailed 1361 kilo
meters in twenty-seven and a quarter
hours. The grand prize at the exposition
contests was won by the Count de la
Vaulx, who a week or two ago, It will be
remembered, unsuccessfully attempted to
sail across the Mediterranean.
The most successful -aeronaut up to
date, Santos-Dumont, uses an airship of
his own design. It is shaped like a tor
pedoâa cylindrical body sharpened at
both ends. His first noteworthy ascension
was made more than three years ago In
September, 1898, but it was not until two
years later that his achievements became
extraordinary. In September, 1900 dur
ing the sessions of the Aeronautic Con
gress, he sailed against the wind. His
latest and greatest feat consisted in sail
ing from a suburb of Paris to and
around the Eiffel Tower and back with
in half an hour. The success of the un
dertaking-contrasted sharply with the
Count de la Vaulx's failure to cross tho
Mediterranean.
So far as this country is concerned, ths
only serious recent contribution to aero
nautics, while the subsidized German
product. Count Zeppelin's airship, is not
yet worthy of any deep attention. The
chances, therefore, seem to favor the
French as the solvers of the problem of
aerial navigation.

It is a pride to every American that the Steinway of to-day has for its
clientele the cultivated people of the entire world. Its conquest, it is true,
has not been gained without a struggle. There were positions fortified by-
tradition and conservatism to be carried. ' But Messrs. Steinway & Sons
started out with the laudable ambition and determination to impress the
Old World with the achievements of the New. So successful and effective
was the campaign that-the artistic worth of the Steinway now commands
recognition and support in all lands.
Travel where you will and you will find that the crowned heads of all
countries have paid it official and personal recognition by use in their pal-
aces and by royal patents appointing Steinway & Sons as makers to their
courts. Among the royal indorsers are:

were full,' of course, and of ' musicians
naturally.. but society and the bourgeoisie
were conspicuous by their .absence. â¢ The
house downstairs was a damp and dreary
sight, the dress circle no better, but, in
the ancient and time-honored phrase, the
house made up in enthusiasm what It
lacked in numbers. "Why . last night
THE SArN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1901
should have been regarded as an "off"
night it is beyond me to imagine, with
Gadski's Elsa to hear and a good cast
besides, but the rows upon rows of empty
seats pathetically testified to the opinion.
One would not have wondered had the
performance suffered therefore, but it was
just the other way about. The subtle
sympathy raining down from those music
loving gallery crowds soop made Itself
felt over the footlights, and without Van
Dyck, without Schumann-Heink, the per
formance yet held a bigger swing : and'
spirit than- either of the preceding ones
of the season. -. . â â -â -'â -<â â :.,.
Gadski's Elsa is known to us from last
year, and is as lovely to-day as it was
then. She excelled herself last night in
every way, singing with a fine passion
and pathos and. acting the part with full
nobleness and filling its jsvery tender re
quirement. Gadski has a profoundly
touching quality in. her voice, tears melted
into song. It Is like no other voice in the
company, V and it is in this human, pa
thetic, tender note that her Elsa excels.
She has not' the dawn-like purity of
Eamea In the part, nor ' the : majesty of
Nordica, but It is a more humanly lovable
conception than either. One can only say
as the house said with generous noise last
night, "Bravo! Gadski! Bravo!"
Louise Homer's Ortrud is. a big sur
prise to me, and was. to most folk who
know her only as Amnerls and in the
few smaller roles she has been heard in
here. Her voice, big, rich and sweet, I
have-always doffed my cap to, -as well
as to her dramatic capacities, but that
she could do what she did- with the" part
of Ortrud last night I did -not dream was
among the likelihoods. But she gave a
broad, fine reading of the role that came
well ; even "after Bchumann-Heink's gor
geous Interpretation. - of the Braban tine
Jezebel, singing with a power and even
brilliance that filled all that kind of re
quirement.- It is not yet an even concep
tion. She did not act at all, for example
âan Schumann-Heink does. every minute
in the A fl rst act, though her second was
dramatically very effective, and she has
of course not the splendid vocal finish,
control, of the first artist. But as a por
tent of future ' attainment â¢ I have 'heard
nothing so promising for long months,
and her work has the' air: of an. original
inspiration, though she has studied her
Schumann-Heink to advantage. Mme.
Homer must get the throatiness out of
her voice and pick up somewhere a reper
toire of facial expression, and, then' she
need do nothing but. grow along. her pres
ent lines to become one of the great of
the operatic world.
Dippel was the Lohengrin last night and
did some free, fine work in the part. â¢ It
was Dippel at his best, and quite , the
broadest thing I have heard him do. He
looked the silver knight handsomely and
sang and. acted the part with a fresh,
young accent that was very pleasine." Mr.
BIspham was also in noble form.' He was
never more Impassioned, more powerful,
or. vocally more satisfying than last
night. -which is saying that ' the Tebra
mundiof-the cast was all that it; could
or. should be at any time. â¢ Mr. ' Blass was
the. Kin? to. the cast's entire advantage,
Mr. Muhlmann i was ; the â¢ herald < and the
chorus and orchestra were In stunning

TWO SINGERS OF GRAU OPERA
COMPANY WHO APPEARED
LAST NIGHT IN "LOHENGRIN."
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON
THE grandeur of "Wagner's "Lohen
grin," as presented last night by a
selected cast of Grau's singers,
failed to attract a crowd to the
Grand Opera-House, ? which was
about half-filled.
The slim attendance furnished but an
other prjoof that grand opera is, as Grau
says, merely a vehicle for society to make
a display. With a cast of singers includ
ing Madame Gadski, Louise Homer, Bis
pham, Muhlmann, Blass and Dippel thp
house should have been crowded to the
doors, considering the popular prices
chareed for seats.
Slim as was the attendance the audi
ence .was most prolific In its applause,
and the work of the artists and orchestra
under Damrosch was rewarded with
rounds of applause at the end of each act.
It is. a significant fact that the .Wag
nerite3 who flock to the opera-house on
"society nights" are not. to be seen there
when the management gives the same
splendid musical offerings at reduced
prices. .
The present opera season furnishes con
siderable room for thought. "Lohen
grin," with its great' cast of singers at
popular prices, presents dozens of empty
seats in the opera-house, yet the mere
fame of a singer who may not come up
to expectations is sufficient to draw a big
crowd that fills every portion of the thea
ter at twice the price.,
This afternoon begins the last week of
the Grau season. The matinee bill is "Le
Nozze di Figaro." Eames and Sembrich,
who created a veritable sensation In it
before, will reappear. The house Is al
ready sold out for' this afternoon.
To-night Calve is to sing Santuzza in
"Cavalierly. Rustlcana," in which she Js
supposed to be at her best. "La Boheme,"
with Suzanne Adams, Fritzi Scheff, De
Marchi and Scotti In the cast, will also
be sunf to-night.
"Tristan und Isolde" is to be heard, for
the first - time in this city, to-morrow
evening,, and there is considerable desire
to hear the great Wagner composition.
Reuss-Belce, Louise Homer, Van Dyck,
Bispham, Muhlmarin, Reiss, Bars and De
Reszke will be in the cast for the Wag
.ner opera.
The farewell appearance of Madame
Calve and Sybil Sanderson is to take
place on Wednesday night In "Carmen."

CARRIES PISTOL
IN A HATBDX
Highbinder, Peculiarly
Equipped, Sets Out
to Kill. M,
Jue Num Devises a Clever
Ruse, but Policeman
Arrests Him.
The police expect more trouble In
Chinatown. Yesterday they received
word that at least fifty gun-fighters had
arrived froni San Jose, Sacramento and
other interior cities, prepared to avenge
the shooting of Little Lou, the noted Chi
nese gambler; and his bodyguard. Chief
Wittman in view of the influx has de
tailed an extra squad in the Chinese quar
ter, with the instructions â¢ to arrest any
and all suspicious characters.
Through the vigilance of Policeman
Tillman of the Chinatown squad a notori
ous highbinder, who Is known as Jue
Num, was prevented from committing
murder early yesterday morning. Num,
who is known as one of the most desper
ate members of the warring tongs,
was seen walking along Washington
street with a hatbox in his hand. Recog
nizing him Tillman, in a loud voice,
asked him what he had in the box.
Without deigning to reply the high
binder suddenly dropped the box and
started to run. Tillman gave chase and
soon overhauled the fleeing Chinaman.
Taking him to where he had dropped the
box the policeman ordered him , to open
it. As the Chinamaji raised the lid the
vigilant officer was surprised to find that
it contained a 41 Colt's revolver, fully
loaded.
Num was arrested and locked up in the
City Prison, the revolver being booked as
evidence against him. Several Chinese
merchants yesterday visited police head
quarters and asked that Num be given a
long sentence, as they were led to believe
that he had been hired to put them out
of the way. - >
Chief Wittman and his men are satis
fied that Num was bent upon murdering
some member of a rival tong, but was
prevented by the officer.
A short time afterward another high
binder, who was out to do murder, was
arrested with a loaded revolver in the
sleeve of his blouse. He was also charged
with carrying concealed weapons.
Last night Sergeant Conboy and De
tective Ed Gibson arrested a highbinder,
who is known as Suey Nom, and charged
him with . carrying a concealed .weapon.
He was found with a 41 Colt's revolver in
his sleeve, evidently intending to commit
murder. The prisoner belongs in Sacra
mento and is regarded as a desperate
highbinder.
