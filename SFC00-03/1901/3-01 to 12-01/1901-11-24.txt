â¢ Iâ l some attempt toward ; it is made
V I â¢ whenever we meet' our fellows, it Is
JL . strange , that we are not '. all '- more
proficient. It has been suggested that we
have reason to be grateful that we have
a few conversational formulae, to be used
under certain., circumstances, such as
"How do you : do?" "Oood-by," "Thank
you," "You are .very kind," . "I should be
delighted." Fancy the mental strain, if,
Instead of these, we had to Invent some
! new combination' of words to suit each
occasion. . . Â¦
The charm of agreeable, conversation is
appreciated by all, while its cultivation is
within the reach of each; arid we may be
our own tutors.. Nothing so quickly opens,
hospitable doors,; and in its influence it
may be an evangel. T
Some of the Essentials of Good Con
versation.
, One of Its essentials is a well-modulated
voice,' which always seems a distinguish
ing mark of gentlehood. Much lias been
eatd about our high-pitched voices, but it
will bear reiteration, sines it is In our
power, to change them. A.ll feel the charm
of the softly musical voices of English
women. They are like, some qweet-toned
bell, â¢ while a ' lew among *us recall the
"ear-plerclng fife." A gentleman, upon
escaping from tin- infliction of 'such an
one, quoted to his friend,
Â¦ "And silence like a poultice comes
To heal lite blow* of sound!"
We should aim. too, to speak our lan
guage In Us '"English undented"â

There is a cosmopolitan: language spoken
I among educated people everywhereâ
"their speech betrayeth them." By it we
judge their culture, their refinement, "their
social I position. Provincialism and slang
are not less a revelation of the absence
of these advantages. The subject Bug
gests Coleridge's well-known story of the
â¢ stranger at . a dinner who passed for , a
" dignified and worthy personage until his
pleasure at the excellence of. the dump
lings caused him to break the silence that
had won him the reputation of wisdom by
exclaiming, "Them's the Jockeys for me!"
No matter what . - his moral character,
whether saint or hero, his mental caliber,
his rusticity of breeding, stood confessed.
In cases less extreme the influence would
be as conclusive. . None should be able to
tell by accent , or Intonation from what
part of the country we come. â¢
The French know their language bo
thoroughly that they use It with the pre
cision and sensitiveness with which a cul
tivated musician plays upon his instru
ment, English la more comprehensive,
and, well selected, it can fitly express any
mood and meet every requirement, but
few of us know Its resources and have
them at command.
Chaim in Conversation.
Entertaining conversation Is not alone
dependent upon a well-stored mind, a
ready wit or broad culture. It lays under
contribution qualities of heart as well as
head, and should reveal sincerity, sym
pathy and simplicity. We must feel an
interest in Our subject before we can in
'[,ll, It iii others, and enthusiasm is con
tagious when it Is sincere. It gives anl
tetnta to fhe face, vivacity to the manner
and has a thought-compelling power that (
aids fluency of expression. This and the
gushing exuberance that speaks only in
superlatives are "many miles asunder."
. Sympathy and adaptability are created
in a measure by the desire to please; but
one must be sensitive to the mood of one's
audience, and quick to perceive when
some one else wishes to â¢ speak. Â¦ There
are talkers who, metaphorically, take the
bit between their teeth and run away with
the subject. When they finally cease, no
on* has anything to say, despairing of
opportunity. Unselfishness lies at the
Toot of sympathy.
Without simplicity no conversation has
charm. The moment we perceive that it
Is labored, or that the speaker seems to
calculate the effect of his words, if \ un
necessary mention is made of desirable
acquaintances, or there is a display of at
tainments or mock-innocent vaunting of
advantages, that moment do we see
through the "pose" and feel only con
tempt for the affectation and pretense.
Truth has a marvelous power of making
Itself felt in spite of what is said. Self
consciousness is but egotism under a less
severe name, and self must be forgotten
before we can add to our speech the grace
and dignity of simplicity.
: v â¢ , Subjects of Conversation.
The subjects of interesting conversation
are, of course, multiplied by increased
knowledge of books, of the world of men
and women, music, art and travel. One
should be familiar with the current news
of the day and the N topics occupying public
attention, with the names and authors of
the new books, and be able to say some
thing worth hearing about what one has
read and heard. .' Many get no farther in
speaking of a book than that it is dull or
interesting. Others r give in few words
â¢what seem to be its central ideas, its
characteristics, the time and scene of its
action, quoting ; perhaps some sentiment
that has impressed or witticism j that has
pleased. . .._Â¦
One's conversation may become the cen
ter around which one's reading and infor
mation are grouped. The habit of mem
orizing with j a definite aim In view, and
the consciousness of having something to
say, , give a â¢ sense ,j of power. Practice
arouses and strengthens the habit of
ready selection and quick and apt appli
cation. ;" â¢ .
True culture carries with it an atmos
phere .of ' breadth-r-the world and not the
village. A woman lacking it was said to
betray by her conversation a mind of nar
row compassâ "bounded on the north by.,
her servants, on the east by her children,
on the south by her ailments, and on the
west by her clothes!" Some one has said
that the three "d's" are not discussed in
polite societyâ dress, domestics \ and dis
eases. . - _ . .
â¢'.Â¦. The mind grows shallow when perpetu
ally ..; occupied with trivialities. , A course
of solid reading is a good tonic. When ig
norant of our Ignorance, we do not know
when we betray ourselves.
It is better.to.be frankly dull than pe
dantic. Not exhibition but service is im
posed by superior talent or advantages.
â¢ Some persons give an opinion as though
their verdict were absolute and final. Dog
matism has been defined as "puppyism
come to maturity." Others hold forth
with oracular vagueness, but convey few
ideas, as though - they were educated
above their intelligence.
. One must guard one's self from the
temptation of "talking shop," as the slang
of the day expresses it, and of riding
one's "hobby." Our interest is apt to blind
us to the lack of it In others. It comes
under the reproach of "bad taste," as
does also the retailing of family affairs.
The sanctity of home life should be guard
ed by us with a self-respecting reticence.
A bore has been described as "one who
talks about himself when you want to
talk about yourself." The sarcasm aside,
whatever sets one apart as a capital "I"
should 'be avoided. Anecdotes that are
supposed to be of Interest because con
nected with ourselves should be reserved
for our intimates. Our troubles annoy
those whom they do not sadden. i.el us
only pass upon pleasant things. A joke
or humorous story is dependent upon its
freshness for appreciation; some â¢Â¦mo
tions will not bear "warming over." A
foreign phrase for which liter. Is no exact
equivalent in English seems occasionally
to give point, finish or adornment to a
sentence, but one must De wary or assum-
I Ing that it is untranslatable. . It is bad
form to use foreign expressions unless
they be idiomatic and pronounced with
correct accent. Â¦ "
It is now a well-established and ac
cepted canon of good form that only
pleasant things are to be said of any one.
An ill-natured criticism is a social blun
der as well as a moral one. "Though wo
speak with the tongues of men and of
angels, and have not charity, it profiteth
us nothing"â in good society.
Gossip and Exaggeration.
Gossip, too, is really going out of fash
ion. , Any one self-convicted hastens to
retract whatever may . give the impres
sion that one has indulged in anything so
vulgar and plebeian. It has a corrective
and an inspiring influence to imagine tne
persons spoken of to be within hearing.
Exaggeration is misstatement, which is*
untruthfulness. It often does as much
harm as a deliberate lie, and is not as
honest. -Â¦
True wit is a gift, not an attainment.
Those who use it aright never yield to the
temptation of saying anything that can
wound another in .order to exhibit their
own cleverness. . It is natural and spon
taneous. "Those who run after wit aro
apt. to catch : nonsense." Talk ' that has
heartiness in it and the liveliness and
sparkle that come of light-heartedness
and innocent gayety is a fairly good sub
stitute for wit. .
Talk That Influences.
It is a form of influence to pass on in
conversation whatever one has read or '
heard that may be helpful and inspiring
to others. Many an important resolve
taken, in the course. of one's life has been
greatly influenced by what one has heard
in a chance conversation. -' â¢,
We may do much in the cause of truth
and kindliness without advertising our
motive or sounding a trumpet before us.
"With an art that conceals art we may ,
lead the conversation away. from scandal
and innuendo into I channels pure and
peaceable. "Out ci the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh"â therefore the
source . must be right. . Fearlessly but
never aggressively, should we defend our ,
convictions : and . "show our : colors."
Preaching is out of place. Society is not
a school, but a playground where people
meet to exchange ideas and forget their
work and their worries. : Most of them
have to work hard in some way or other
and ; need relaxation. 'Â¦. ; .
1 The Early Stages of- Conversation.
The 'preliminary stages of conversation
offer the principal difficulty â "the dread
of silence makes us mute." The weather
seems to have perennial interest. Why
may not one treasure a few bits of stor
ies apropos- of that much-worn topic, to
be brought out , upon occasion? For in
stance, some one speaks of the variabil
ity of the weather, whereupon one nJght
tell of. the lady whose physician vised
for her change of climate. "Why, doc
tor, you forget that I am a New York
woman; I never ' have anything but
changes!" was her rejoinder.. At least it
is better than mere â¢Â¦- acquiescence, and
when people have laughed together the
ice is 'broken. It Is possible to have at
one's tongue's end some trifling things
of Interest on various ' subjects, but the
supply needs frequent renewal.
Conversation at Dinners. ' '
There are moments when the embar
rassment of silence is relieved by the
knowledge that nothing but the veriest
commonplaces are expected. When a host
ess has paired her guests before a din
ner and each man seeks the woman as
signed to him he usually says: "I be-,
lieve that I am to have the pleasure of
taking you in to dinner " and she has
but to bow and smile while accepting his
arm, and may say in a voice of perfunc
toiy politeness: "I am very glad," or if
she wish to be very complimentary may
venture "I am fortunate,
It is usually the man who takes the
Initiative and the woman who bears the
burden of the conversation. On the way
to the dining room they may improve
the occasion or not, as they please. There
is sometimes an awkward pause at tha
beginning of the meal before the company
seem to have adapted themselves to their
surroundings and to each other. A host
ess blessed with tact will know how to
set the ball rolling, perhaps with some
thing of Interest treasured for the occa
sion.
E&i h person at table should endeavor
to make himself or herself agreeable to
both neighbors, as opportunity serves.
General conversation is only possible
where there are few present. Talk is
usually then at its best and brightest.
One with very humble powers, in the
colloquial commerce of thought, and when
kindled by sympathy with the subject
discussed, surprises himself not less than
others by unsuspected eloquence. Thosa
who have the reputation of being good

A SMALL
BOY'S IDEA
OF A PERFECT
THANKSGIVING
DINNER
THE only trouble about lhanksgiving â
I have decided in thinking it over â
Is that it takes so long for the helping,
'Cepting for that boys would be in clover.
Parts of the turkey are better than others,
And grown folks sometimes are long in choosing,
So every time that a plate goes by you
You think what an awful lot you're losing.
Often there comes that terrible feeling â
While I am watching and waiting and smelling â
"S'pose, when my turn comes, there shouldn't be any.7
I'm big, but I'm sure THEN I couldn't help yelling.
I think if a fairy should give me three wishes â
(I don't much believe any fairies are living)
I should first wish for the sort of a dinner
That would be perfect on every Thanksgiving
In the town hall that's as big as the church is,
I'd have a platform instead of a table,
On it a turkey twice taller than I am,
Everything big as the fairies were able ;
Cranberry sauce and just barrels of gravy,
Buckets of squash and tall celery bunches,
Monstrous plum puddings and pies big as cartwheels
('T wouldn't be one of your delicate lunches!)
I would invite every boy in the village â
Nobody else â to my wonderful dinner.
Each one could just walk around on the platform
Helping himself. Well, we wouldn't be thinner
When we got through and went off to play football-*
What did you say about washing the dishes?
Clearing the platform? The fairies would do it â
That would be bargained for in the three wishes.

than we are, and naturally feels
that she can give us "pointers."
Strange to, say, she has, not so far de

Paris threw us Into a panto in the early
spring by giving us fair warning, but her
second has not followed the example, for
which most of us are duly thankful.
But this latest coiffure. What is It?
Well, after all. It is not so very different
from what you are wearing right now;
that is, if you are affecting the loose,
easy, careless fashion.
The trick Is simple enough. Gather all
your hair into one hand and comb it
straight up until the crown of the head is

reached. Then let It fall gently on all
sides just as It will. When the hair la
fluffy the style Is a very pretty and a very
becoming one.
The ornaments are where the difference
comes in. A silk hair ornament, liberally
sprinkled with, jet or beads, or silk flow
ers, is worn very low, almost la the
nape of the neck, in fact.
To even things up a bit, silk flowers are
set high in the coiffure. Not primly, but
naturally and gracefully, just as though
they were perfectly at home.
Some people cannot stand the low effect,
so a sunburst of diamonds Is cunningly
fastened in the soft pompadour. It tend*
to make the hair droop over the eye a tri
fle, and at the saino time makes a decid
edly swell ornament
Natural flower I are by far the prettiest
of all the numerous and fetching frills,
but they soon wither and lose their
charm. Carnations have proved the best
stand-bys.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
Next to fashionable coiffures cornea
fashionable millinery.
Everything is feathers, feathers, feath
ers.
An awfully swagger hat la made of
black panne. A plain, round hat, turned
slightly off the face. Four nodding
plumes spring from the crown and peep
curiously over the brim. It gives a sweet,
girlish appearance, besldea being a little
out of the ordinary.
Another swell hat la made of dark gray
velvet. The crown is on the Tam-o'-
Bliuiiter style. From the side front two
long white feathers roll backward, veld la
place by a rhinestone capsion.
As the hat alts at an angle of forty-live
degrees, the plumes sweep down and uen
tly cover the hair. Buch a hat is swell
merely with a walking suit. It is far too
heavy to be worn with anything very
light and dainty.
The combination of fur and feathers Is
Â¦omewhat in vogue. Persian lamb and
ermine make effective rims and plumes
do not look at all out of place with either
of them.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
Fur Is worn so much this winter that
all sorts and conditions of combination*
axe smart.
An Eton jacket of black Persian with a
high collar, revws and cuffs or ermine is
opt only awfully good form, but warm
and best of all. serviceable. To make itAGUSTA

Quite complete, a large cozy mun or er
mine is absolutely necessary.
Gray fox has been taken up as a fad
this year for boas and muffs. And could
anything be prettier or daintier? The del-
Icate ellvery tone adds to many a toilet
Just the tone that was needed.
Opera cloaks h.ave not even been ex
empt. a soft brocaded material has first
a band of chinchilla and then a band of
lace. 'i'jie broad turnover collar rests on
the upper part of the kimono sleeve which
the laco and the st-lf-.sanic couple meet
In all amiability at the flowing cuff.
Even breast trimming is used on wraps.
For a while these breasts took the*place
Â«f feathers, as neither the wind nor fog
affected them, but no one dreamed of
/nakingr capes, collars and even broad
boas out of them. A cape made of bro
caded satin with the collar; and fronts
of the breasts may be worn either In thÂ» o
day. or evening. For the latter, a blac!Â°
chiffon ruche' supporting- the collar makes
Jt look twice as stunning. Black always
has that effect, .by the way.
One must necessarily have something*
swell, to wear with these wraps. A sweet "
evening , frock Is made of rose crepe da
chine. The style Is somewhat like a prln
cesse, there being no break at the waist.
Tne only decoration on It is a large gar
land of pink .roses which. fall over the
shoulder and half across, the bodice. They
are held in place by a rosette of chiffon,
a streamer of which strays to the waist
and loses Itself In the fastenings of the
frock in the back. The skirt has a flounce
of white chiffon plaited with pink satin
stripes. The rose idea Is carried out by'
having them twine themselves about the
skirt as a heading for the flounce. ,
The Bower idea is a novel as well as a
pretty one.
/ For Btreet wear one may wear that
which pleases her fancy the most.
Velvet seems to be popular. Blue, black
and green. One of the swellest is a green Â¦
L'Alelon suit. While the name sounds
fancy, the cut itself bo closely resembles
the old-time blouse Etons that unless you
are strictly up in names you would prob
ably call It that. The mark wouldn't be
missed much, either. V' Â» i
Long cloaks are a convenience, such a
convenience, in fact. Â» They cover and pro

"MRS, DSWEY"
A HOME-;:
/ i^HE Little: captain is to nave tne
. . Iâ¢ , â¢ biggest .Thanksgiving of all, the six
A i he has , ever seen. For the Doll
1 jl house is his.
.'Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦'Â¦ Not - simply a Dollhouse. Not
such a one as anybody might buy in any
store, but The : Dollhouse, the one that
you spell with capital letters and think,
of with reverence and yearning every
time the doll show is mentioned.
' There were people at the show, many
"â¢'" of them, far richer and bigger than the
Little Captain, and they ; all seemed to
want the' Dollhouse as much as he did.
Or perhaps not quite as much; for the
- Little Captain has never In all his lifo
j known what it was to be quite well, and
/ when a person has to lie around the
house and can't get out to play shinny
Â¦* and prisoners' base, he has more time
. to think and think and work up a fever
of thinking about his chance of drawing
the prize.
That is the way it was with Robert La
Fontaine, winner of this season's Doll
house. He has lived six such miserable
years, of sickness and weariness and
wishing. "When he was taken to the Doll
Â¦ Show and suddenly came upon the House
he was quite certain that he was dream
ing.
Then he went up to it and looked closer,
and the peculiarity of this dream was that
It didn't vanish the way others, do. After
ten minutes' critical examination, which
took in the details of all the eight rooms
and their furnishings from bath to tele
phone, he came to the conclusion that it
k was a real thing and the most real thing
he had ever seen.
Then he wanted it. How he wanted it:
He asked a thousand Questions to the
minute about it and how* it was to be
had. When he was told about the ruille
arrangement he explained it carefully to
his mother and demanded that she buy a
ticket.,
i She did. That ticket was fatefully num-

The Little Captain . could hardly be

dragged away from the House, although
it came time to go home and he was
tired out. But he felt as if he must stay
-on the spot, as if by doing so he might
help on the career of his precious ticket.
When he went home he thought of
nothing else, he talked of nothing else.
He had an immense amount of confidence
in what his one ticket would accomplish,
although his mother thought it held a
very small chance and told him so. But
the Little Captain was going to hope to
the end and he defied anybody to discour
age him.
He had owned a dollhouse already
which his mother had made for him. In
the Intervals when she could snatch time
she had used her deft fingers to fashion
a home for his bisque family. It was a
most ingenious affair, considering that it
was made by a mother, but compared
with the palatial affair at the showâ
there was no comparison whatever. It
was lighted by a simple candle chan
delier and it lacked most modern con
veniences, even the simplest, such as
running water and telephone. Admiral
and Mrs. Dewey, who constituted the
bisque family, had been obliged to live in
this urn. had been cheerful and smiling
always in spite of inconveniences, but the
truth is they must have realized all
the time that their home was made not
of brownstone, not of colonial nrlck, not
of fashionable stucco or even comforta
ble clapboard, but as a matter of plain,
unvarnished fact, it was made, ofâ
cracker boxes!
It cost a pang to think of keeping a
national hero and his beautiful bride in
a cracker-box house. All the more so to
Robert because, being 1 a United States
officer himself, he could the better ap
preciate the admiral's heroism. The l-rlttlo
Captain has been called so since he was
three years old, when he used to go out
to the Presidio and drill Captain Hager'a
Tennessee Regiment while the whole hun
dred of the boys in blue obeyed sharp
at his lisped command. He was a soldier
in heart, but his strength was too little
then for his duties as captain and after
ward, when he went^lnto a camp and
came out with a rousing case of army
measles, his military career had to be cut
off short, v .
Hut his heart is in the same place and
the life that he leads in his feverish im
agination is aglow with red, white and
blue. Therefore his dolls are permitted
to be no less personages than generals
ami admirals and heir families.
1. explained to the Deweys that they
had a prospect of moving into new quar
ters. They took it stoically, with no intent
of exciting themselves while the matter
\
was as yet in the air, and Mrs. I^a Fon
taine was frightened at the tremendous
confidence that The Captain showed, for
she realized that the chances of number
610 were one against many hundred.
The Little Captain simply kept right on
believing.
There are those who will say that hia
Xaith was what accomplished the wonder.
As for him, he was not in the least sur
prised, only breathlessly delighted,
61U won.
"You can move right in," he told tho
Dewey family.
It proved that they had to delay a lit
tle in the moving, for the wonderful eight
room Colonial mansion hud to be tai.cn
apart before it could be wriggled Into tho
Jai Fontaine front door. Howersr, mov
ing always involves some delay and soma
iruonvÂ«nlences and the Deweys are phil
osophical. They look forward to eating 1
their Thanksgiving dinner in the splendid,
dining-room where Flemish oak and green
tapestries make dining a work of art and
where a dark butler will be present to at
tend to their every want.
It will be a Thanksgiving worthy the
name. And as for The Uttle Captain â
It passes words to him. And yet ha
knew it waa going to happen all the time.
London Telephone Girls.
. . ...
"When girls are chosen for the neir
Government telephone service In lÂ»n
don," says the London press, "the edu
cational examination sinks into insignifi
cance before the physiological test. . No
girl will be employed if she is be;tff-<jr 5
feet 2 inches high in her stocking feet.
She must possess good hearing, have no
defect of speech, and must be tested by
viva voce examination, in which partic
ular attention Is to be paid to articula
tion, pitch of voice and general self-poa
sesslon. Any candidate showing any in
dication of nervousness, hysteria, want of
self-possession or a strongly marked
twang 1 shall be rejected. The majority,
will probably pass in self-possession, but
dialect Is a severe test." __. 4THE BEST KNOWN CLUB WOMEN OF THE PACIFIC COAST
TL yt us. LOWENTSERO wins out ny
f\ / I her womanliness.
I V I That is the secret of her. She
>â¢ ~ I Is a veteran club woman, and
Â¦A withal so unclubliko according
to the popular standard that she cornea
upon you with a little jolt of surprise.
She doesn't even believe thoroughly in
suffrage. At least, she doesn't'think she
wants to vote.
Now that is very unlike the. most of
them. Many woman's clubs are a sort of
disguise for suffrage. "Women who want
to votoT. sometimes band together under a
liternT^' and harmless exterior and watch
their chance. They are going to get it,
too, by the way, for they are in earnest.
Mrs. Lowenberg says the same thing, and
she says that she has the best kind of
friends who are of the suffragists; that
she believes them to be conscientious ani
serious and wise, perhaps, but she is
doubtful of the righteousness of their
cause.
Interesting, Isn't It? For nearly all the
Â¦women who even pretend to be up-to-date
and broad-minded and advanced feel
called upon to talk suffrage. Some of
,them wouldn't know what on earth to
do with the ballot if they had it; would
Icok at it wonderingly and then run away
from it perhaps; but they must say that
they want it. But Mrs. Lowenberg, one
of the cleverest, brainiest, most earnest
club women in ' this city, says frankly
that although she believes the ballot for
women is coming, she doubts if women
or the country will be any better off for it. ,
"Will women purify politics?" she says.
"It is a question. Â¦,Â¦ ' .
"I am so afraid that instead of their
Improving politics, politics will hurt them.
May not the polls rub off something of.
that sweet womanliness which every one
loves and admires? I am not sure of this,
you know. I am open to .conviction on
this as well as on all other subjects, but
I fear At.
"A /woman at the polls must mingle,
with all sorts and conditions. It is not
being snobbish to dread this. Women
must keep up their ideals. Men depend
upon us for this. Â¦Â¦** Â¦
"Suppose a woman were running for
office (and why should she not, .if she
Â¦were permitted to vote?) would she not
have to associate with all kinds of wo
men in her seeking of votes? Would she ,
not have the temptation to lower her
eclf in order to gain favor? - It is a great
risk.

talkers must be careful not to over
shadow others, if the" would give pleas
ure. A fluent talker is apt to be over
eager to say what he has in his mind
and his conversation often becomes a
monologue. A professional talker is a
professional bore. . \ Â¦ ...
At table he should not engross one's t
neighbor by conversation, however charm
ing", so that he is unable to satisfy his
appetite and in some measure to appre
ciate what his hostess has been at pains
to provide. Courtesy excludes the intro
duction of all subjects calculated to ex
cite heated argument, unpleasant discus
sion or anything that may. be obnoxious
to any one . present.
Upon the return of the men to the
drawing 1 room to rejoin the ladles there
is sometimes an awkward moment. A
suggestive opening may be to carry on
the central idea of the talk just con
cluded in the dining room. A man may
sky "We have been having a most in
teresting discussion since you left us,"
and the lady may ask. "What have you
men been talking about that called forth
such spontaneous laughter?" It is un
necessary to add that gentlemen do not
discuss in the neighborhood of ladies'
matters that could not be repeated in
their hearing and it is a rule that should
work both ways. Â¦
Compliments.
The famous Mme. Recamier said that
Bhe always found two words sufficed to
make her guests feel their welcome. Up
on their arrival she exclaimed "At last!"
and when they took leave she said "Al
already?" If taken literally we Â should
deprecate the flattery- Flattery is insin
cere praise and wrongs "him that gives
and him that takes." It is sometimes
kinder to accept a compliment than to
Â¦ parry it. One may say "Thank you, it
Is pleasant to be seen through such kind
(or partial) eyes," or perhaps, "It is a
Â¦ comfort to know that friendship is part
ly blind as well as the mythological boy,"
ork*ny nonsense that serves to show that
appreciates the spirit that prompted
the kind expressions, however wide of
the truth. The frequent repetition of the
name of the person addressed holds a
subtle compliment, implying more com
plete concentration of ,the speaker's
thought upon his or her personality.
Good Listeners.
De Quint says: "More is done for
the benefit of conversation by the simple
magic of good manners than by all varie
ties of intellectual power," It Is the sym
pathetic and responsive listeners that
call forth the best efforts of a talker. For
such are reserved his choicest stories, his
finest thoughts. A kindling of the face, a

There is nothing more trying than to
find that one's conversation is receiving

Test Words and Phrases.
In our whimsical language, accuracy is
largely a matter or custom. We . in
stantly assign a low place to those, who
are guilty of grammatical errors, but we
classify one as lacking in refined training
who would say "I don't know as," " a
long 1 ways," "somewheres." It is the evi
dence that the speaker has reached a cer
tain grade of cultivation, and no higher.
Society has its test words. It is con
sidered provincial to say "depot" for
"station," "bureau" for "dressing-table," -
"store" for "shop." Fruits, nuts, etc.,
are "dessert;" sweets are not "dessert."
We refer to our sisters, sweethearts, ami
wives 'without the prefix of "Miss" or
"Mrs." Lord Roberts, for Instance, in
his autobiography says, "I met my fate
in the form of Nora Bews." He does not
say "Miss Nora," nor does a lady in Eng
land ever speak of her husband as "Mr.
Smith," any more than she would of her
daughter us "Miss Smith," to her friends
and equals. She says "my, husband," as,
of course, she says, "my daughter," or
calls them by name, and in America we
are fast following her example. A man
is plain "Smith" to his men friends, and no
referred to by them. We used to be much
ridiculed for our exaggeration of modesty
in conversation. An Englishman once
told an American girl that he had re
ceived a "llmb-acy" from an old aunt,
seeking to adapt his conversation to his
hearer. Â«
The Bible word "sick" is only used to
express nausea in England, and we too
have adopted the word "ill" in its stead.
One would-be-elegant young woman In
the country asked the writer if she were
"sea in" on her return voyage!
phrases that are considered so provin
cial as to grade the speaker are, "Comm
end me to your wife," "Our home is at
" "We have company," and to refer
to one's relatives as "Cousin Mary,"
"Uncle John," to strangers, is not in
good taste unless with the preface of the
personal pronoun followed by the sur
name,â "My uncle, Mr. Jones."
A much ridiculed phrase is "a lady
friend of mine," "a gentleman friend."
It is to be assumed that all one's
friends are ladies ml gentlemen. "A
man friend of- mine," "a lady whom I
know," is sufficiently explicit. . Natural
courtesy teaches us when to say "wo
man," when "lady." There are those who
lead them to be better citizens and vot
ers.

In the Society which spells itself with a
capital S, there is a fashion in pronuncia
tionâconformity 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ to whose shibboleth
marks the exact runs of the social ladder
to which one belongs. In its conversa
tion the form is often better than the sub
stance.. The final "t" in "valet" is sound
ed, "patent" rhymes with "latent," etc.
Fortunately the tendency, is toward cor
rectness and simplicity, and small inele
gancies offend ears fastidious.
Slang. ->â¢
Slang vulgarizes the language, no mat-,
ter how pkiuant and pithy it may seem.
The use of it, begun In run, ends in habit.
Some one has said that "slang is lan
guage in the making," and it is true that
what is linguistic heterodoxy in one age la
orthodoxy in the next, but one may leave
the pioneer work to others, with advan
tage to her. own speech. Especially do
slang phrases seem to coarsen the con
versation of young women. Lowell says
of Chaucer that "he found his native
tongue a dialect and left it a language.
The process may be reversed. Already a
learned professor has ascribed the de
terioration of the English language
(whim he assumes as proven) to the fact
that the Bible and Shakespeare are so
much less read than formerly.
Final Suggestions.
As an "accomplishment" the art of con
versation has many advantages. In some
of its various phases it is always avail
able, and one never lacks an instrument.
A few suggestions may serve to show
how far simple good manners are a guide
to success and charm in conversation,
and those who charm can influence.
Offer to each one who speaks the hom
age of your undivided attention. Look
people in the face when you talk to them.
We should talk often but never long, giv
ing others their opportunity. Conversa
tion should be like a game of ball.
Show courteous respect for another's
point of view, In argument give fair play.
Concede to your opponent his full due,
allowing him to finish his statement with
out fear of interruption. Unless principle
is involved, it la better to leave him ap
parently master of the field than prolong
a discussion beyond the limits of good
taste. You will snatch victory from de
feat.
The best substitute for wisdom is si
lence. Never claim to know things of
which you are ignorant. Some one will -
see through the sham. Acknowledge your
ignorance frankly and naturally.
Have convictions of you/ own. Be your
self and not a mere echo. No one else
can contribute your peculiar personality
to the world, and God made nothing eu

THE SPIRIT OF THANKSGIVING
*^-| S we approach the annual Thanks
f I giving season, what more beautt?
fâ I ful or appropriate sentiment could
V. I be suggested for the hearty con-
JL slderation and quiet meditation of
every person than that contained,
!n St. Paul's exhortation to the church at
F.phesus: 'â¢Giving thanks always for all
things unto God."
It Is the duty of all to be thankful to
God. who is the active source of all bless
ings in creation, in providence and in
grace. All are the recipients of God's
favors which demand return of thanks
giving. It is not only God's right, but
man's happiness, and not to render it Is
to wrong: both God and oneself. It is
right and "comely" and "pleasant" both
to God and man. Thanksgiving and
praise is the employment of earth as well
as of heaven. All certainly owe thanks
giving to God as a tribute for past mer
cies.
O, holy Father* Just and true
Are all thy works and words and ways.
And unto thee alone are due
Thanksgiving end eternal praise!
As children of thy gracious care.
We veil the eye, we bend the knee.
"With broken Â¦words of praise and prayer.
Father and God, we come to thee.
It is solacing Indeed to think of at least
one little season in the whole year when.
In the midst of all the rigor and vigor
of life, all persons shall possess to some
degree the thanksgiving spirit. Like the
Israelites of old, all should come to God
with a peace offering of thanksgiving
which would be delightful to God and
double the offerer'?- blessing; for It is
"More blessed to give than to receive."
As the Israelites came to the altar with
festive gladness in their hearts, because
peace was established between God and
themselves, and reconciliation was real
ized, so likewise should we all unite in a
sacrificial banquet of joy and thanksgiv
ing over peace and plenty, through our
Heavenly Father's good pleasure. The
offerings of the Israelites were an expres
sion of their gratitude to God, an ac
knowledgment of his infinite power and
glory, an expression of their reverent
sense of God's goodness to them, .and of
a desire to render some service to him
in return. This ancient people of God did
not always approach him with requests;
they often came with offerings intended
distinctly for thanksgiving.
We. as true worshipers of God, should
not only seek God when we have requests
to present, or when some danger threat
ens, or some great need presses; but there
are seasons when we should come to him
with songs of praise and thanksgiving.
There are times when the language of all
should be, â¢"What shall I render unto the
Lord for all his benefits toward me?"
"Bless the Lord. O my soul," "Thanks be
unto God for his unspeakable gift." Is
not our annual Thanksgiving season such
an occasion? Is not this a time when all
should yield themselves in devotion to
him who has been their gracious bene
factor? Is not this a time when the
happy recipients of his grace, like the
stem full of sap throwing out many
branches, will give vent to their full
heart of praise in many different forms?
This is a time when language is lame,
and we say with Hannah More:
Fountain of mercy, whose pervading eye
Can look within, and read what passes there.
Accept my thoughts for thanks: 1 have no
words.
.My soul, jo'erfraught with gratitude, reject*
The aid of language: Lord! behold my heart.
V.v call, with Milton, upon all nature to
aid us in rendering praise unto God:
His praise, ye winds, that from
Four quarters blow.
Breathe soft o'er land; and
Â¦Wave your tops, ye pines.
With every plant, in glen
Of worship wave.
In any normal human being, unless
morally degenerate, gratitude naturally
rises in the heart toward human bene
factors. How much more should it toward
God. in whom we live and move and
have our being. And yet we find the
prophets frequently rebuking Israel for
ihanklessness and reminding them that
the dumb creation put them to shame.
There were many lepers cleansed by
Christ of whose healing no record is
given. The reason the healing .of the
ten lepers is mentioned Is no doubt be
cause one of them came back, "giving
him thanks." The incident was mention
ed to teach us the lesson of thanksgiving.
So much to the credit of the one leper.
The nine had not the excuse "nothing to
be thankful for. " which is so often
heard. They were thankless and grace
less, for these two qualities of character
are concomitant. They were hard-hearted.
"Neither were they thankful" is men
tioned as one of the marks of man's apos
tasy from God. Gratitude is to man what
the ballast is to the ship. A ship should
have sufficient ballast for the sail it car
ries. Only in this way can it have the
needful steadiness. A man with great
gifts and honors but who is without the
ballast of gratitude and praise to God is
very likely to make shipwreck on the rock
of pride. A man who realizes his right
relations to God will have the right ap
prehension and consideration of the ben
efits conferred upon him and he will know
how to esteem and value them. While
each new gift Increases his sense of re
sponsibility It also gives him a growing
â¢sense of his unworthiness and of his de
pendence upon God. I say dependence
upon God, for what is the Idea of thanks
giving. If it Is not true, sincere and spirit
, ual worship of God in a spirit of thanks
for blessings received? It is Impossible
for an atheist to be thankful In the true
sense. His Words of praise and thanks
giving would not be worship, for while
his language used implies the existence
of a personal God. Infinite in power and
goodness, his heart denies his existence.
Like Cain's sacrifice, It would not be ac
ceptable to God because it was not offered
in faith. Thanksgiving without faith and
heart In it is mockery. The Psalmist
says: "I will praise thee, O Lord, my
God, with all my heart; for great has
been thy mercy toward me."
We find then that the thankful heart is
the most worshipful, for the spirit of
thanksgiving Is the predominating element
in praise, which is the essence of true
worship. Worship is only acceptable to
God when it is the Joyous expression of
.a thankful and reverent heart. It Is then
that man is brought under the spiritually
transforming power of God, 'whom he
worships. "Praise," said one, "is the rent
we owe to God, and the larger the farm
the larger the rent." It is to be feared
that there are many fine farms from
which he receives little or no rent, "In
everything pi ye thanks, for this Is the
will of God concerning you."
While we have appointed and convenient
thanksgiving seasons when special atten
tion is directed to this obligation, yet the
thanksgiving spirit is to become a dis
position, "giving thanks always." Ac
cording to Faber there was a beautiful
tradition among the Jews which Lancisius
quotes from Philo. It is to this effect
"When God had created the world he
asked the angels what they thought of
the work of his hands. One of them re
plied that it was so vast and perfect that
only one thing was wanting to it, namely
that there should be created a clear
mighty and harmonious voice, which*
should fill all the quarters of the world
incessantly with its sweet sound, thus day
a.nd night to offer thanksgiving to its
maker." But instead of that one mighty
voice God has designed that every human
voice and every living creature and all
nature itself should hymn forth inces
santly his praise.
"The heavens declare the glory of God
and the firmament showeth fcjs handi
work.
"Day unto day uttereth speech, and
night unto night showeth knowledge.
"There Is no speech nor language where
their voice 1s not heard."
What is needed Is the thankful dispo
sition that takes thanksgiving up as a
life work and Joy, like David, who jeaid:
"As long as I live I will praise thee."
Thanksgiving with us is not to be "tran
sientâa fit of music and then the instru
ment hung by the wall till another gaudy
day of some remarkable providence make
thee take It down," but our Incessant em
ployment, yea our life. Our Lord is to
abide in us and we in him. Like Caleb
of old. we should acknowledge God's gra
cious keeping in all the experiences of our
lives. He attributed to God's mercy all
that he was; he traced the stream of life,
health and strength to this source. "The
Lord hath kept me alive," as he said
Think of the multitudes who live without
any thoughts of thanksgiving whatever.
It was the law In some old monasteries
that the chanting of praise should never
be interrupted and that a choir of monks
should relieve another in the holy service.
How beautiful the thought. May It be
more than mere sentiment to us. May
gratitude become the common spirit of
our lives instead of the exceptional Im
pulse. "Giving thanks always."
Another beautiful thing about this
thankful disposition is that it learns to be
thankful "for all things."
Many are thankful for some things, for
great favors, agreeable and pleasant oc
currences of providence and temporal
blessings. But when it comes to the little
favors of God and man, to the adverse
experiences of life and to spiritual and
eternal blessings, they show no signs of
gratitude. Thankful "for all things"? I
beg you have me excused; I cannot go
that far with you, they say. He who is
only thankful for some things is brother
to nim who is thankful for nothing.
This is the point at which the spirit of
THE SUNDAY CALL.
REV. FRANK
K.
BAKER
thanksgiving with many stops. Here they
become very pessimistic. How can a man
be thankful for the dark chapters in his
life, the deep sorrow that has wrinkled
his brow, bent his back and whitened his
hair? How can he be thankful for the
cares and misfortunes that have blighted
his happiness and robbed him of his
peace of mind? He can be thankful for
these afflictive experiences of life only
when he realizes their purpose. We don't
requite the physician and surgeon for
their distasteful medicines and painful
cuttings with thanks and praise because
we like these things in themselves, but"
because they are the means to restore us
to health. If we would look at the af
flictive experiences of our lives in the
same light, believing that he who holds
our lives in his hands, through them de
signs to rid us of our sins, restore us to
spiritual health, and preparo us to be
heirs of his everlasting kingdom, then
we would be thankful for trouble and sor
row as well as for ease and pleasure.
What an Illustrious example of this
faith we have in the life and death of
President William McKinley. He lived in
the faith that "God's way" is the safe
way and that he plans best who plans
with God. The spirit of resignation and
brave submission manifested in his suf
fering and death was a part of his life.
He felt from his. young manhood that a
higher power was working through him
and beyond him, and sometimes, no doubt,
seemingly against him. and yet making
chapters of a kind of history that was to
last. It was easy for such a noble man
of God to say in his last hour: "It Is
God's way. His will be done!" This
Thanksgiving day finds this country of
ours and the whole world under new obli
gations to be thankful for tha life of our
martyred President
As there are some trees that will not
thrive unless their roots are laid bare, so
It la said to be a rare soul that can be
kept in any constant order without the
smarting remedies Incident to this life.
How cultivate the thanksgiving spirit?
That It may be cultivated Is obvious.
That all have It In germ and that all
should cultivate it Is not realized by
many as it should be. How to cultivate
the thanksgiving spirit, even among the
most selfish of persons, is not difficult of
solution. Annie M. Tooley says: "It has
no narrow creeds or tenetsâ no special
forma of devotion for the exercise of its
influence. It is simply an annual, heaven
born Incentive to do good and to make
others happy and grateful to our Maker."
One way to acquire this spirit is by
human charity and pity. The real thanks
giving spirit sends its prayers in a bas
ket or wagon to the poor widow; it proves
its pity with its purse and shows its heart
with the palm of the hand. Only when
the solemnities of a Thanksgiving day
leave such an impression on the people as
that they are more careful and cheerful
in doing their duty afterward are they
indeed acceptable to God or profitable to
man. Some people are like a bog which
catches the surface water of the sur
rounding country, but which has no out
let, they have an unlimited capacity for
receiving and absorbing, but they neve,
give out to others. They seem blessed by
the constant stream of Gods mercies and
their life is full to overflowing, yet they
give not to others that which would make
Them happy. Blessed with plenty oÂ£
money, health and congenial associations
they withhold 'that from others whch
might make them happy forever aswÂ«n
as themselves. Selfishness and Insâ¢"
turle are conjoined. The selfish life Is a
narrow and untrue life: it is a stagnant
marsh. But how sublime is the life or
the thankful soul who. forgetful of itseh.
is devoted to God and duty, and whose
brothers good is his good. There is
nothing more divine or Chrlstllke than a
man whose whole life is possessed with a^
desire to help others. However lonely tr^i
trail of human life, however deep and
dark the forest through which it runs,
however many and strong the spiritual
enemies that infest his way. his heart Is
kept In perfect peace, because he feels he
is a coworker with God in his great work
of bringing men into his kingdom. This
is the spirit of brotherhood that will make
possible the dream of Olive- Schrelner
who says: "I dreamed I saw a land, and
en the hills walked brave women and
brave men, hand In hand; and they looked
into each other's eyes and were not

We have reasons to rejoice that thÂ«
angels' carol Is being translated into
Christian experienceâ "On earth peace,
good will toward men." It is said that
the true thanksgiving spirit cements be
yond the fear of dissolution the fraternal
kinship of Christianized humanity. The
selfish man and the unbelieving man who
Ignores the sacred obligations of the
Christian church and the house of God
is standing in the way of the. real broth
erhood of man. It is only as the spirit or
him who gave himself for us leavens the
heart of men and permeates society, that
the proper adjustments can be made be
tween capital and labor, the employer
and the employe in the economic world.

Another way of cultivating this Thanks
giving spirit is by counting our mercies.
"We all have more blessings than we are.
mindful of, but we get so used to them
they become common to us and we fail Â¦
to appreciate them. â¢
We look upon the dews of the evening,
or. the crops In the harvest, as something
regular and customary, and, deprived of
tlitse, we feel justified in uttering our
complaint as if their bestowal was not
calculated to call forth thankfulness.
We daily receive supplies of water and
the rays of the sun, and we gaze upon
the stars of heaven which God kindles
nightly as though they were very com
mon things.
The very frequency of our blessings and
the regularity of their coming make them
common to us and lead us to forget the
Giver. We accept many of our blessings
God gives us as if they were not sent.
Many are prone to dwell upon their
sorrows and rehearse them who never
count God's mercies to them. None are
so skilled in numeration as to be able to
count all God exhibitions of goodness,
which are as numberless as the sands by
the seashore.
Oliver Wendell Holmes gives us a beau
tiful and suggestive illustration of the
thankful heart, finding abundant mercies.
Said he: "If any one should give us a
dish of sand and there were particles of
iron in it. I might look with my eyes for
them and search them with my clumsy
fingers and be unable to find them; but
let me take a magnet and sweep it. and
how it would draw to itself the most in
visible particles by the mere power of at
traction. The unthankful heart, like my
finger in the sand, discovers no mercies,
but let the thankful heart sweep through
the day. and, as the magnet rinds the
iron, so It will find in every hour some
heavenly blessings: only the Iron in God's
sand is gold." I
Then count your many blessings, name
them one by one. and you will find much
to be thankful for. Jesus tauprht that a
man s life does not consist in the abund
ance of the things he possesseth. It is
not the abundance a man has that makes
him thankful; it's being faithful in that
which Is least. Thankfulness, like Justice
and truth, is the companion of the soul
A sunny spirit is always a thankful
spirit, and to look on the bright side of
things is a fair way to cultivate the grate
ful heart. If we were Just as quick to
hunt for the bright places in life as we
are for the dark ones we. would find less
so for sighing. - \
We might mention one more way in
which to cultivate the Thanksgiving spir
it, and that is by considering the rela
tive importance and value of the thing-*
seen and unseen. The constant apprecia
tion of the brevity of life and the hop*
of Immortality will rob life of its drudgery
and make it worth living. We are told
that over the triple doorways of the whÂ«te
marble cathedral of Milan there are three*
Inscriptions spanning the splendid arches.
Over one is carved a beautiful wreath of
roses and underneath Is the legend, "All
that which pleases is only for a moment. '
Over the other is a sculptured cross, and
these are the words, "All that which
troubles is but for a moment." Over thÂ»
great central entrance. In the middle aisle.
is the inscription. "That only is which is
eternal." To live In the light of these
great facts will develop a thankful heart.
The hope of the life which is to come
makes this life worth living. The belief
"that life here and now has Its roots In
immortality, that here and now we have 1
close kinship with heaven, and that th.3,-*
purposes and hopes that animate us to
day, instead of being destroyed by death,
shall find their completion and fruition
in the realm beyond death." will crown
life here with Joy and gladness and yon
der with glory.
Cultivating this upward look toward
life and immortality beyond the grave Is
to bring into our lives a sweeter ami
richer consciousness of the heavenly
world: rob our lives of much of their bit
terness and lighten the shadows which
bereavements have cast over our path
way. It is an inspiration to live In an
ticipation of reaching the city which hath
foundations, where we shall be reunited
with "those whose bark sped out into the
night and over the sea % while we stood
weeping upon the shore."
May Thanksgiving day find us enter
ing into "peace with, God" by bringing
to him the "sacrifice of peace offering."
which Is "a broken spirit" and "a broken
and a contrite heart."
And while we call home our dear ones
and hold our family reunions around all
our hearthstones, while we render to God
services of praise and thanksgiving for
the bounteousness of the harvests and of
our general prosperity, may we also give
ourselves to deeds of brotherly kindness
and loving charity, endeavoring to "give
back the upward looking and the light"
to the sorrowing and to "rebuild in them
the music and the dream." \^

COmmiSSlO|\l'S 80/15 ACBASROSS.
1 KB United States steamship Alba
tress has lately returned from, a
cruise of several months in the wa
ters of Southeast Alaska, where she
has been Investigating the salmon
fisheries.
The canneries of Alaska have grown so
much in cumbers and size in the last few
years and so many millions of dollars
have been Invested in them that it Is well
Cor the companies that their fisheries re
el so much Government care and at
tention.
It Is not so very long ago that all sorts
ef schemes and devices were in- force to
trap the salmon on the run up for the
spawning season. â¢;. v '.
The barricade was the most usual trap,
consisting of a tree thrown across the
stream and heavy logs nailed to the tree
bo they touched the water. The salmon
coming up would find themselves stopped
by the barricade and would not have the
sense to attempt to leap, and were
slaughtered wholesale.
There Is now a fine of 51000 for any one
found using a barricade and $250 per diem
for maintenance of the same and, as
many ef the companies now fish the same
streams, they keep a sharp lookout for
one another's shortcomings.
The work done on this last cruise of
the Albatrose has been mainly the ex
amination of hatcheries already working
end the selection of good points In the
streams for future hatcheries.
Visits to most of the large canneries
were made, with an idea of getting some
knowledge of the season's catch, the sys
tem of packing and the general routine
work.
Many of the streams were explored this
year with the aid of the Indians and their
canoes and there are certain risks that
the explorers run. ?
Mr. Chamberlain, assistant fish expert
of the Albatross, gives an experience that
a young officer and he had on one of the
lakes they were exploring. It appears
that they got into rapid water and their
beat came pretty near capsizing and some
of their paraphernalia fell overboard.
The officer promptly went over into the
rapids after the various articles and as
promptly was swept off his feet and car
riee 1 , down stream. â¢
Chamberlain gauged the distance and
found it would be Impossible to get a rope
to his companion, so he proceeded to save
the rest of the Valuable paraphernalia
and beach the boat.
When he got around the bend he was
thankful to see a shivering but safe offi
cer scrambling ashore. The officer was a
teetotaler, but he managed to say be
tween the chatters, "Chamberlain, by â â
Elr, if I had some whisky here, me if
I wouldn't take a drink."
"We always took a flask alone after
that," Mr. Chamberlain concluded.
Many of the lakes, though fordable.
have quicksand bottoms, and while ex
amining one of them Mr. Rodman, the
senior officer, with a heavy pack of in
struments and guns, suddenly began to
sink.
The moment was a critical one, but with
rare presence of mind he stood perfectly
still and called to one of the Indians to
come and take his pack.
The Indian moved gingerly to within
two feet of Mr. Rodman and took his
pack from behind, and with the load off
his shoulders he ceased to sink and slowly
moved back out of danger.
"With the dangers there are the pleas
ures. The magnificent scenery, the gla
ciers, the woods and the wonders of the
Alaskan countryâ all tell a story impres
sive to the mind.
It is a unique country, with its clear
air, so perfect for photography; the can
neries and salters, the hatcheries â read
a Â¦on to any one anxious to gain
knowledge.
Then there is the well earned rest on
board the cozy ship after a hard day's
work.
The swapping of experiences over the
well cooked dinner; the fragrance of the
after dinner weedâ all these good things
make an "entente cordiale" and force one
to forget the iciness of the rivers crossed,
the shaking sand and the whirling pools.
The cruise in Alaskan waters was cut
short this year on account of smallpox
breaking out on board at Naked Island
anchorage. Prince William Sound, the
ship going into quarantine at Swansdown
Harbor.
The cases fortunately proved very slight
ones.
On the 12th of September the Albatross
started another important work, namely,
the setting of pots for lobsters.
The following notes on the history of
the planting of Eastern lobsters in the Pa
cific Ocean will give an idea of the great,
persevering trouble that has been taken
in the past to introduce the Eastern lob
ster on the coast.
Five attempts have been made. The
first trial was a failure, owing to a rail
road accident; the others were successful
to the extent of reaching the coast with
live lobsters and depositing' them in suit
able waters.
In 1E73 Livingston Stone, who . repre
sented the United States Fish . Commis
sion, made his first attempt to transport
live lobsters.
He started with 162 lobsters obtained!
from Woods Holl and Massachusetts Bay.
By the breaking of a railroad bridge
over the Elkhorn River, near Omaha, the
aquarium car was wrecked. In 1874 Mr.
Stone made a second attempt, the con
signment consisting of 150 egg-bearing
lobsters, procured in Boston, but only a
few lobsters reached the coast alive.
They were deposited in San Francisco
Bay at Oakland on June 12.
Mr. Stone did not make another attempt
till 1879, when he brought over twenty
two females, to which were attached
400,000 eggs nearly ready to hatch. Twen
ty-one lobstt-rs arrived safely and were
deposited in excellent condition off Bonita
Lighthouse, in a sheltered position a few
miles outside of the Golden Gate.
Nine years later the Fish Commission
sent, under the charge of J. Frank
Ellis, a relatively large number of adult
and embryo lobsters to California, which
were planted in Monterey Bay.
On June 23 of the same year 162 lobsters
were placed in the sea about three-quar
ters of a mile off shore from Pacific Grove
in water twelve fathoms deep with a
rocky bottom.
A second plant of ninety-five lobsters
was made July 1 a mile off Point Lobos.
On July 4 the Albatross left San Fran
cisco with thirty lobsters on board, the
lot consisting of thirteen males and sev
enteen females. These were planted off
Trinidad Lighthouse.
A further shipment was made in Jan
uary, 1889, in charge of J. Frank Ellis.,
These were intended for the Washington
and Oregon coasts. Of the 710 lobsters
sent out, 233 survived the trip and were
placed as follows: Eighty-eight off Cape
Disappointment at the mouth of the Co
lumbia River, twenty-two in Shoalwater
Bay and 123 in Puget Sound, nÂ«*r Port
Townsend. \
The question naturally arises, "Where
are the lobsters?"
' The Fish Commissioners were anxious
to have this question answered so the Al
batross has been setting pots on her way
down. First at Port Townsend, then sev
eral at Cape Flattery.
At Cape Disappointment the pots were
left in the care of the captain of the life
saving station. On arriving off the Faral
lon^s a man was left on the islands to
pet pots there.
Yet the question remains unanswered,
"Where are the lobsters?" No one knows.
A. B. Alexander, fishing expert on
the Albatross, thinks that some parts
of the Alaskan coast afford better condi
tions for the lobster than exist on the
shores of the Pacific Coast, chiefly urging
"that the temperature and other environ
ments of that region correspond more
closely to the home of the lobster on the
Atlantic Coast."
"It Is quite evident," he continues, "that
lobsters require a great change in temper
ature of water, far greater than they
would find off the Pacific Coast below
50 degrees north latitude, from the fact
that they are only found in latitudes
THE SUNDAY CALL.
SEARCHERS OF
THE DEEP
where the water undergoes such a
change."
Captain Moser, late of the Albatross,
is convinced that the Pacific Ocean, owing
to its rocky bottom, is unsuitable to the
lobster.
The ideal bottom should be soft and
more or less muddy, permitting the lob
ster to burrow and hide.
Captain Moser also thinks that the seals
have had much to do with the disappear
ance of the lobster, and it is a fact that,
all said to the contrary, no Eastern lob
ster has ever been caught on the Pacific
Coast.
Francis Hobert Herrick, Ph. D., pro
fessor of biology in Adelbert College of
Western Reserve University, gives a brief
summary of the most important observa
tions, which have been detailed by him in
a most exhaustive work on the "Life His
tory of the Lobster."
The geographical range of the lobster
comes about 20 degrees of north latitude,
from the thirty-fifth to the fifty-second
parallels, and includes a strip of the At
lantic Ocean 1300 miles long and from
thirty to fifty miles broad.
The most northern point at which its
capture has been recorded is Henley har
bor, Labrador; the most southern point
the coast of North Carolina.
In speaking of the migration of the lob
ster Professor Herrick has this to say:
"No coastwise migrations are known
t> occur, but large numbers of lobsters
move to and from deep water in fall and
spring, the migration bsing influenced by
the temperature of the ocean, by the
abundance of food and to some extent by
the molting and breeding habits."
The Albatross has a most enviable rec
ord for work splendidly carried out and
accomplished. She made her first cruise
in 1833 under Captain T. L. Tanner, and
up to the present time her dredging rec
ords include data connected with 1786
hauls of the dredge heam, trawl, etc., at
all depths, from the shore down to 417?
fathoms, and coyer areas extending fror.
the banks of Newfoundland along both
coasts of North and South America to
Bering Sea, with limited areas in the trop
ical Pacific and the region from Japan to
Kamschatka. Since the Albatross went
into commission she has been in charge of
four naval commanders, whose periods of
service have been as 'cllows: November,
18S2, to May, 1834, T. L. Tanner; May, 1894,
to May, 1596, F. J. Drake; May 1896 to
October 25, 1901, J. F. Moser, and on Octo
ber 26, 1901, Chauncey Thomas took com
mand, j
The Albatross has been detailed at va- Â
rious times for special work in other de- ,
partments.
In 1889 she was assigned to the service t
of the Senate Committee on Indian At- t
fairs In Alaskan waters, and in ISSI she
â¢was engaged in the survey of the cable
route between California and the Ha
waiian Islands. In ISOa she was detailed
to the Navy Department for service in
the war with Spain. During the Bering
Sea controversies the vessel was employed
with the naval patrol of the Bering Sea
and the investigation of the fur seal fish
eries.

THE lover of Shakespeare . will find
a great deal to enjoy in Hamilton
Wright Mabie's work, "Shakes
peare, Poet, Dramatist and Man,"
of which the third edition has just
been Issued by the Macmillan Company.
The exhaustive work of generations of
critics has. In so far as scientific data is
concerned, left little that is new to be
said concerning: Shakespeare. Every
word that Shakespeare wrote has been
weighed so carefully that, considering
alone the technique of the dramas, so to
speak, there remains email occasion for
the exercise of originality in criticism.
Very wisely Mr. Mabie has not attempt
ed In this work of his a studied investi
gation of each play for the student of
English; what he has attempted to do
and what he has succeeded so admirably
in doing- has been to draw from the well
known facts of Shakespeare's life and
from his works an evaluation of the phe
nomenon of Shakespeare's genius and an
explanation of the possibility of the ap
pearance of this phenomenon. Mr. Ma
bie s fine appreciation of the beauty of
the deeper meaning of life, whether this
reveal itself in a play .of the emotions or
* n Mm *. nenomena of nature, and his
facility la expressing this appreciation,
J J ent t0 his work a poetic Quality
which must appear in any â¢ criticism of
Shakespeare If this is not to leave upon
2â¢.^ er the Impression that there is
something essential lacking.
Mr. Mabie's book opens with a brief ac
count of the origin of the drama in the
first crude attempts to accompany by
f~VT v , re J he chorlc son ** whl <*
a the festivals In honor of the god Diony
tÂ«â¢ a r A rat M *Â£ wanderll and adven
tures. As Mr. Mabie then goes on to ex
plain, out of this rude beginning there
came the gradual development of the
chorie dance into the true drama of clas
sical times, when narration of events by
x chorus had given place to representa
tion of adventures and emotions by means
of the action and speech of individual
l?%? * After the passing of the splendor
at the tragedy and the brilliancy of the
comedy of the best age of classic litera
ture came the dark ages, in which the
drama degenerated into pantomime
and dialogue of the coarsest type. With
the revival of learning came renewed ac
quaintance with classic models, and a
rapid advance of the drama toward the
standard they set. until just before Shake
speare wrote there had been written plays
i!!* v' ere no mean Precursors of those
which have come to stand for the highest
achievement of modern dramatic art.
Mr. Mabie writes at some length of
Shakespeare's early life at Stratford, and
at the country round about the town; as
he holds that while Shakespeare's genius
received its bent from the circumstances
surrounding his later life, it was to the
knowledge he gained while a youth at
Stratford and the acquaintance he made
â¢ the beauties of Warwickshire scenery
.hat we may look for the explanation of
two facts: Shakespeare's wide knowledge
at the motive? and Impulses dominating
the -en of the age of Elizabeth, which
helps make him the chief exponent of
the spirit of that age. and the intimate
acquaintance with the beauties of nature
to which the poet gives such exquisite
testimony again and again.
The fact that the only systematic, in
tellectual training which Shakespeare had
y.as in an unimportar town, which of
fered only ordinary advantages of educa
tor., does not argue. Mr. Mabie contends,
that the poet must be considered an un
lettered man. the explanation of whose
penius is that it was a divine flan
v. <-. ping over him without warning and
r.ot the Cowering of his experience ' The
central idea of Mr. Mabie's book is that
L-fcakespeare as he appeared in hi best
work was the logical development of
great forces active throughout civilized
J.urone in his age and having free play
ta the life of England, and that these
forces found their clearest expression in
Shakespeare fcr the reason that his soul
Â¦was best attuned to Their meaning if
Shakespeare Is par excellence the em.
l o'liment of the genius of the Anglo-
Saxon race, then his life previous to the
time when this genius found utterance n
him is in explanation and not in contra
diction of the work which he produced
Fhakespeare is not only a poet for the
litâ he is a dramatist who appeals
to the experience and understanding of
the people. The perennial popularity of
l.is plays shows that ie speaks in a lan
suage which all can understand; that
there is no emotion in the gamut of hu
man feeling which hen- not found expres
sion in him. Believing this, it Is not dif
ficult to see how the seeming disadvan
tages of Shakespeare's career worked for
his ultimate advantage. His quiet Hf Â»
among the peaceful beauties of the coun
try about Stratford gave time and place
for attentive ear to the marvels told by
travelers and strolling players of the won
ders that were opened to view by the dis
covery of a new world and by the grow
ing consciousness of the. inherent strength
hi A greatness of England. Then. too.
when 'chance or the growing poverty of
his father drove him to London he was
forced to gain a practical knowledge of
stagecraft, which later stood him in such
good stead, and an acquaintance with old
plays which proved the inspiration and
stimulus of his future work.
During the age of Elizabeth the thea
ter was frequented by representatives of
all classes and, in the license of the time,
the wit cf the rabble played as freely in
criticism of a play as that of the noble
poetaster. As a result the playwright
who sought enduring popularity must in
his characters appeal to an experience as
wide as that of human nature Itself. That
Shakespeare did this with pre-eminent
success is shown by the fact that for the
learned and the simple of all times his
plays have come to be a treasury of the
knowledge concerning the workings of the
human sou!.

BOOK REVIEWS
AND LITERARY CHAT
speare's writings are a record of the deep
ening and broadening of ; his experience
and of his spiritual 1 unioldingj Mr. Mabie
reviews the list of plays and poems. He
points out the coincidence of the different
groups of plays with certain crises In
Shakespeare's life. He finds that most of
historical plays were written when
â¢ Shakespeare was filled with' a splendid
enthusiasm for the growing importance
of the national greatness of England, and
that the best of the comedies were com
posed when Shakespeare was on the ris
ing tide of fortune, when he haa already
gained an enviable fame and when he
was reveling in the discovery of a won
derful creative faculty; while the mas
terpieces of tragedy were the result lof
the bitterness of spirit which laid its hold
upon Shakespeare when death entered his
own home, and when the political dissen
sions which marred the peace of the last
years of the reign of Elizabeth had
brought disaster to his patrons and
friends. . ;
In the last dramas of Shakespeare,
Winter's Tale," "Cymbeline," "The Temp
est," . there are evidences of an enlarge
ment, of vision, an added tenderness of
feeling and a reserve of Judgment, which
distinguish fittingly the end of the labors
of a writer whose work it was to j em
body In substantial form the history of
human feeling. In these plays there rings
again an echo of the Joyousness and op
timism of youth blended with a note of
resignation and serenity, which evidences
the peace which Shakespeare had at last
attained after the stress of earlier years.
One thing that Mr. Mabie says on the
subject of the sonnets deserves a hearing.
In Judging Shakespeare's mental and emo
tional life through the medium of these
poems Mr. Mabie would take a middle
ground and consider them \ neither the
formal expression of artificial sentiment
nor. on the other hand, a faithful de
scription of actual experiences. For, ho
argues, while in Shakespeare's time the
sonnet had come to be such a common
vehicle of literary expression that writers
had to simulate- emotions to make up a
sufficiently large supply of themes, still
the traces of genuine sentiment in the .
poems are too many ro make it probable
that the truth is other than this: that the
personnel of thÂ» sonnets is fictitious, but
the sentiments and emotions voiced In
them are largely genuine.

Lysbeth..
One of the best things written by Rider
Haggard Is a romance of Holland In the
time of Alva. The novel, which is called
"Lysbeth," from the name of its heroine,
deals with the fortunes of a family which
lent adherence to the New Faith at a
time v.hen the death warrant swiftly fol
lowed upon a suspicion of alienation from
the national religion of Spain.
Lysbeth is a charming young girl, whose
beauty and wealth invite L.ie attention
of a Spanish soldier of fortune, who at
the time the story opens is In command
of an important garrison in Holland. The
Spaniard. Count de Montalvo, succeeds in
winning Lysbeth from the man /she really
loves. Dirk Van Goord, a Hollander, like
herself. Not long after the marriage be
tween Lysbeth and the Count it is dis
covered that the latter has been married
for -several years to a Spanish woman.
In despair Lysbeth flies from the home
whose master she had already learned 10
hate and fear. She takes refuge in. a
lonely marsh, where she is succored by
a poor outcast, Martha the Mare, who
has been reduced from a position of af
fluence to destitution, and who has un
dergone the most terrible tortures be
cause she is under a ban of the church.
Lysbeth is restored to her former lover.
Dirk, whom she marries. With him she
passes many happy years. But unhap
piness again comes to Lysbeth when the
Spaniards increase the persecution of
the Hollanders to such an extent that
that unhappy people is goaded to throw
off the yoke of one of the crudest mas
ters of historic times. The fortunes of
Lysbeth and her' family are connected
closely with that of her country; for the
wealth of some of its members excites
the cupidity of .the Spaniards, and the
misfortunes of unhappy Holland find an
instance in the persecution to which this
particular family is subjected.
Mr. Haggard has chosen for the time
of his story a period so full , of interest
that a story of the time even passably
well written would hold attention. But
given in addition to the Interest of the
historic background of the romance, the
well known skill of Haggard in' telling a
good story, the result is a historical novel
of more than average merit. Besides, in
this latest book of Haggard's he has
made a successful attempt to win the
sympathy of the reader not only by the
charm of recital of adventure, but by that
due to a good picture of interesting char
acters. (Published by Longmans, Green

Drawings by Gibson. ?
The volume ,of drawings by Charles
Dana Gibson which is issued this year
by R. H. Russell presents all of the at
tractions for which we have learned to
look in Gibson's work.
The book contains eighty-four draw
ings, half of which form a series repre
senting the courting of a beautiful young
widow by a large circle of admirers. The
widow makes her first appearance when
she is still overcome with grief at the
loss of her husband. She seeks one di
version and then another as a distraction
from sorrow and in Â«time re-enters soci
ety. But. although there is offered her
pleasure in plenty and-'ih^ny' lovers as
well, she makes her escape from the
world and takes refuge sln a convent,
where she appears charming as ever and.
still worshiped at a distance by her
faithful swains.
The remaining drawings illustrate the
foibles of different sorts and conditions
of men and women. We still find among
Gibson's characters, if they ; may be
called so. the stately girl whom he -has
made famous. But we find, too, as -time
goes on, that Gibson can draw not only
fair women and good looking men, but :
people interesting for their peculiar traits
of form or feature. The value of ; Gib
son's work is enhanced, as he adds to his
surety of touch a better appreciation of
the differences of temperament which dis
tinguish even persons of the same general
type. , -.-. .-.â¢-- Â¦ . ; . Â¦â¢ .-.
The beauty and . daintiness of the vol
ume must- make it, like Its predecessors,
a. leading favorite among holiday books.

A Cabinet Secret.
"A Cabinet Secret," by Guy Boothby, is
an absurd tale of the calamities occurring
to leaders of affairs in England at the
outbreak of the war in South Africa. A
band of foreign anarchists, in order to
inflict as much harm as possible upon tne
English Government at a time when Its
difficulties leave it open to attacks from
its enemies, plot to kill the leading states
men and generals. The principal agent
of the band is a beautiful woman who
masquerades as a grande dame, the Coun
tess de Fenetza. She goes from the Conti

A BOOK OF SONNETS IN SLANG
BY A SAIN FRANCISCAN.
Wallace Irwin, a young San Franciscan,
whose verses in lighter vein have already
caught the public's fancy, now comes
forth with a book that out up-to-dates
them allâ "The Love Sonnets of a Hood
lum." Mr. Irwin has taken the highest
form known to lyric writers and with due
regard to all the mechanical convention
alities and requirements of the sonnet,
gone to work with an impassioned ardor
that gives even the "Letters of an Eng
lishwoman" an Icy appearance and mrkes
the slang of George Ade's fables look like
the English of a college professor.
From a glance at the advance sheets
it is safe to say that the book will make
a hit. Through the twenty-two sonnets
runs the story of the love of Willie for his
Mame-a sad tale of woe expressed in
more slang than even the American lan
guage has been credited to possess. Here
is the third sonnet, which shows the gen
tleman's remarkable ideas concerning the
wearing apparel that should win the heart
of his inamorita:
As follows Is the make-up I shall buy.
Next week, when from the boss 1 pull my pay:
A white and yellow zig-zag cutaway,
A sunset-colored vest and purple tie,
A shirt lor vaudeville and something fly
In gunboat shoes and half-hose on the gay.
I'll get some green shoe-laces, by the way.
And a straw lid to set "em stepping high.
Then s*hall I shine and be the great main
squeeze,
The warm gazook, the only on the bunch.
The Oklahoma wonder, the whole cheese,
The baby with the Honolulu hunch-
That will bring Mame to timeâ l shouM say
yes.
Ain't my dough good as Murphy's? Well, I
guess !
Bad luck hovers close to the doughty
lover's standard, however, and Murp*hy
carries off the lady. Willie sings of the
splendid establishment. She makes her
way into English society, and by this
means obtains information of the move
ments of the commander-in-chief of the
British army, the general who is to go to
Africa in charge of the army there, and
of several other men of equal distinction.
Through the machinations of the reputed
Countess these men are kidnaped, and
put on board an old ship which is to be
sunk at a certain time by an infernal
machine. But this uesign is frustrated,
and at last the Englishmen are rescued,
while the anarchists meet death in a
storm at sea. (Published by J. B. Lip

King Midas.
"King Midas," by Upton Sinclair, takes
its title from the struggle in the heart of
a beautiful girl just entering womanhood,
who tries to please her friends and to
gratify her own love of the beauty and
luxury that wealth brings by giving her
hand to a millionaire suitor when her
heart does not go with it. It is a wonder
ful study of a woman's soul. Lovers of
music will be especially interested by the
skill with which music is made a lan
guage for the expression of emotion and
the revelation of character. The story
ends in scenes of thrilling dramatic in
tensity, culminating in tragedy; but be
yond the tragedy is seen the promise of

Sylvia.
If ingenious advertising can make a
novel famous, then "Sylvia" should take
front rank. The author or the publishers
have hit upon a device new in introduc
ing a novel to the public. The heroine of
the book, "Sylvia," by Evalyn Emerson,
is described as "the most beautiful In
Europe." Twelve well known illustrators
have each drawn to represent Sylvia a
portrait portraying their ideal of beauty
in woman. The twelve pictures of Sylvia
introduce the reading matter of the book.
The pictures are preceded by a notice in
viting the public to try for a prize of
five hundred dollars by sending to the
publishers a coupon found in each copy
of the novel. Upon this coupon is to be
written a list of the photographs in or

sad culmination to his wooing in the fol
lowing pathetic strain:
At noon to-day Murphy and Maine were tied.
A gospel huckster did the referee.
And all the Drug Clerks' Union loped to see
The queen of Minnie street become a. bride.
And that bad actor, Murphy, by her side,
Standing' where Yours Despondent ought to be.
I tvent to hang: a smile in front of me.
But weeps were in my glimmers when I tried.
The pastor murmured, "Two and two make
one,"
And slipped a sixteen X on Mamie's grab:
And when the game was tied and all was done
The guests shied footwear at the bridal cab.
And Murphy's little gilt-roofed brother Jim
Snickered, "She's left her happy home for
him."
The last two lines of the epilogue have
a ring to them in a humor particularly
fetching:
To just one girl I've tuned my sad bazoc.
Stringing my piiie-dream off as it occurred.
And as I've tipped the straight talk every
word,
If you don # t like it you know what to do.
Perhaps you think I've handed out to you
An idle jest, a touch-me-not, absurd
As any sky-blue-pink canary bird
Billed for a record season at the Zoo.
If that's your pruess you'll have to guess again,
For thus I fizzled in a burst ol glory.
And this rhythmatic side-show iloth contain
The sum and substance of my hard-luck story,
Showing how Vanity is still on deck
And Humble Virtue gets it in the neck.
Gelett Burgess has written an introduc
tion in quaint defense of the perverted
combination of the sor.net and slang. The
humor that underlies his apparently pon
derous exposition of the peculiar fitness
of slang and its use by old writers of
world fame is quite delightful and pe
culiarly Burgess in flavor. Mr. Irwi.Vs

Tommy Foster's Adventures.
We are indebted to Mr. Frederick Ober
for much good ilterature. He has written
some two dozen books of various kindi,
dealing with travel and adventure mainly,
and now and thtn a dip into history.
"Tommy Foster's Adventures" is a book
that boys will read with keenest plea.s
ure. it appears opportunely, too, for at
no previous time has there been so gen
eral an interest in the Indian tribes o!
the Southwest, among whom the hero of
the story passed several pleasant yet
exciting weeks.
Tommy's father is a sufferer from
asthma and is ordered "Out West" to
obtain, if possible, relief from his ail
ment. Tommy's mother goes along to
take care of her husband, and Tommy-a
pretty lively boy of 14â is one of the party
because there is no one with whom he
can be left. They reach a little, strag
gling town in New Mexico, and right here
.Tommy's adventures begin.
His first exploit is to shoot an Indian
dog, mistaking it for a coyote. He ia
locked up in consequence, but an Indian
boy cf about his own age helps him out
of this trouble, and the two become fast
friends. Then <=till more exciting adven
tures follow, and the mistakes and trials
of Tommy before he arrives at something
like wisdom are told in a delightful way.
Tommy is not a hero exactly, but he is a
plucky lad and is sure to have plenty of
admirers. (Puuiished by Henry Altemua

Year Book of Lyrics.
"A Year Book of Famous Lyrics," by
Frederick Lawrence Knowles, is a unique
compilation combining the general excel
lencies of an anthology with those of a
year book or calendar of daily selections.
Every page has one or two short poems
which are acknowledged masterpieces,
and are pre-eminently suited for memor
izing. In all there are more than boo
poems. While It is impossible to group
so many selections without involving
some unevenness in quality, the general
average fs exceedingly hign. Seventy
four different English and American
poets are represented by selections, ani
the birth and death dates of the more no
table of them are indicated in fine type
on the appropriate pages. The illustra
tions include sixteen full-page portraits of
famous poets.
There are indexes of titles and first
lines, a general introduction, and seven
pages of explanatory notes.
The mechanical make-up of the book is
good, and the cover design is simple and
appropriate. (Published by Dana.Estea &

Winifred West.
"Winifred West" is a story for girls, by
Blanche M. Charming. The scene is laid
in Western Massachusetts, in a simple
country home. The young heroine is the
daughter of a thoroughly good and con
scientious physician, who has endeavored
to give his children, of whom there are a
large number, as good an education and
as many advantages as he possibly can
with his limited means.
Tne young girl develops a great taste
for the violin, and her parents finally de
cide to give ber the benertts cf a winter's
study in Boston, under one of the finest
of violin masters. Here Winifred is
thrown upon her own resources. Her sim
ple country life comes as a ray of sun
shine in the Boston home where she
stops. Her steady application to her
work, making the most of her opportuni
ties, wins its reward, and at the end of
the year she receives unusual praise from
her stolid old violin master and from the
large audience which gathers to hear the
final recital of his pupils. (.Published by

Last of the Arawaks.
"The Last of the Arawaks," by Fred
erick A. Ober, is a story of adventure,
in which the author gives a picture of
the internal condition of affairs among
the people of the Island of San Domingo,
where revolutions are of almost constant
occurrence. He shows clearly the des
potic power of their chief executive, who
at the time of this story was President
Heureaux.
Into a picture of the times the author
has woven many interesting facts con
cerning the early history of the island,
with which the name of Christopher Co
lumbus is inseparably connected.
Mr. Ober is well able to write under
standingly concerning the affairs of this
island, for his life has been spent more
or less among the various islands. He
has spent much time in! Government em

the World's Fair had charge of many of
the South American exhibits. (Published

The Spectacle Man.
"The Spectacle Man" Is a story of a
missing bridge, by Mary F. Leonard. The
scene Is laid In Louisville, Ky., and has
as Its central figure and heroine a young
girl, whose character the reader soon
learns to love. In the early chapters of
the book the reader realizes that for some
unknown reason an unpleasantness exists
between the girl's father and his reia
tives, but it Is not until the closing chap
ters that the author divulges the reason,
which proves to be the marriage of the
girl's father and mother, which did not
meet with the approval of his family.
The little heroine, however, develops such
beautiful traits of character that without
her knowledge she is the means by which
her father and his aunt are reconciled.

* A Heroine of 1812.
"A Heroine of 1812" is a Maryland ro

takes up the many hardships and reverses
which characterized the early part of the
War of 1812. The young heroine, a stanch
supporter of the policy which guided the
early events of the war, threw herself
heart and hand into the cause. Although
differing in opinion from some of her
Northern friends, yet she wins their
hearty admiration. The hardships
through which she passes form the found

picture of the early stages of the war.
This volume will be followed by another

period of the war will be depicted. (Pub

Messrs. A. t". tflcCUwp & Co. announce
for early publication a life of Herbert
Spencer, by Dr. David Starr Jordan,

It will be complete to date, and compre

any reliable biography of Spencer will un
doubtedly insure a favorable reception for
a volume by so eminent an authority.

Cicero. The volume will be printed on Old
Stratford r'eckle edge paper. Except the
designed title page and unique end papers

great care has been taken with the press
work and the book will form a worthy
addition to any book lover's library. The
cover is from an old Florentine design
and the book will be bound in cloth and

Theodore Roosevelt, in the Introduction
he has written to A. G. Wallihan's forth
coming book. "Camera Shots at Bifc
Game." censiders the photography of wild
animals as a sport and lauds the camera
shot above the rifle shot. He says:
"Mare and more as it becomes necesaary
to preserve the game, let us hope that th^
camera will largely supplant the rifle. It
is an excellent thing to have a nation pro
ficient in marksmanship, and it is high
ly undesirable that the rifle should be
wholly laid by. But the shot is, after aJI,
only a small part of the free life of thn
wilderness. The chief attractions lie in
the physical hardihood for which the IHa
calls, the sense of limitless freedom which
it brings, and the remoteness .md wild
charm and beauty of primitive nature.
All this we get exactly as much in hunt
ing wtth the camera as in hunting with
the rifle, and of the two the former is
the kind of sport which calls for The high
er degree of skill, patience, resolution and
knowfedge of the life history of the ani
mal sought."
The mention of Mr. Wallihan's camera
shots in particular are as those of a pho
tographic sportsman of the rtrst order,
whose record may never be equaled, for
the reason that he has been a pioneer in
the best game fields in the time at th^
greatest abundance of wild life. The vol

r killed by being shot through the head;
i that other soldiers had also been killed,
1 and they, the officers, were sure that the
| Americans must be in Angaqui this very
3 hour.
j Same date.â At every step we found the
mountains getting higher and the cold
: more chilling. It was 2 o'clock In the
1 morning. A strong wind was blowing.
1 The cold, becoming more and more In
tense, was penetrating almost to our
bones. Our skins had become dead to
feeling and our lips drawn purple from
cold.
December 3.â lmmediately, and without
even breakfasting, we resumed the march.
The Terror of the Kanao.
i December 7.â We reached the Banana
settlement- We have seen the "kanao,"
.or head dance. It is a feast which the
;lgorrotes celebrate in each ranch or set-
Btlexneht when one or any number of them
B secure he head of an enemy by means of

Same day.â ln this ranch there Is an
I abundance of "camotes." or native pota-
I toes. But there is a great scarcity of
1 rice, hence our meals are reduced to two
[\ a day. vis., the first at 9 a. m.. consisting
3of emotes, " end the second at 3p. m.,
Â¦} consisting of water-cooked rice and other
:1 foods. We only allow half a "chupa" or
.] about a fourth of a pint of rice for a ra
il tion, thÂ© result being that we never get
j| enough to eat; and when we cannot get
ft other foods on account of we cannot get
foods on account of their scarcity
I we supply the deficiency with "talbos," or
shoots of the "camote." and with unhulled
rice cooked in water and Fait. The eeoend
meal sometimes consists of "camotes"
when there is no rice, so that we have
nothing but "camotea" during the entire
day.
December 16.â The honorable President
explained to a meeting called in a thicket
not far from our camp a very critical
state of things, viz., that the Americans
had taken Bayambang. hence we could
not go further forward; that there were
Americans behind us; that they were pur
suing us, and had already arrived at the
Sagada settlement; that our situation
here In Banane Is dangerous, because not
only aro our enemies the Americans,
in front of us and behind us, but the very
Igorrotes who surround us are also our
enemies, only waiting for the opportu
nity to cut off our heads.
Separating From the Women.
Same dateâ (ln the same meeting)
Senor Villa was of the opinion that wo
should separate from the women, wno
constitute such a great Impediment or ob
stacle to any plan that we might form.
He would send these women to Manila,
accompanied by two trustworthy officers.
(After discussion the honorable President
so ordered.)
December 21. â The sun Is beclouded: it
is a sad day for us. The fresh breeze gen
tly moves the trees. The separation from
the women, from these beings who give
us life and courage, sorely afflicts
us; night is coming npon us; oyr
vision grows dim; our legs and knees are
already weak and tremulous, our breath
ing laborious, and the thirst is intense.
The clinging mud increases our troubles. "
THE SUNDAY CALL.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The night now Is very dark. The
leafy mountain trees shut out the star
light of the heavens. We no longer see
one another. Along that narrow pathâ l 6
inches wideâ which we travel, lie the
precipices of death, and looking down Into
their depths suffices to make one have a
feeling: of faintness and swimmy^g in the
head, or to imagine himself on the edge
of death. Each one of us uses as a guide
the limb of a tree, probing into the dark
ness with the point of it for the location
of an abyss. * â¢ â¢ It Is 9 o'clock at
night. We are, perhaps, at an elevation
of some 2300 metres. Ascents are still
awaiting us; hunger! thirst!â we are sick
and faint. Corporal fatigue prostrates
us; yet we continue our journey, almost
crawling. * â¢ â¢ We reach the sum
mit at 10 o'clock at night. We are ex
hausted; we lie down on the ground with
out a "petate" (native covering of woven
bamboo). The intense cold makes our
teeth chatter. Soon a profound slumber
and great exhaustion has robbed us of in
telligence. â¢ â¢ â¢ At 2 o'clock In the
morning the honorable President awoke
and ordered that we should continue the
march.
December 22.â 1t was 7a. m. when we ar
rived in Ambayuan. Here we found the
women, worn out with the painful lour
ney they had suffered; they were seated
on the ground. In their faces are observed
Indications of the ravages of hunger; but
they are always smiling, saying they
would prefer suffering In these mountains
to being under the dominion of the Amer
icans, and that such sacrifices are the
duties of every patriot who loves his
country.
December 24.â The women marched off
to Talubln to present themselves to the
enemy. What a mournful parting!
Resolve to Face Death.
December 26.â At 8 o'clock the honor
able President ordered the companies
formed, and he explained to all that the
only remedy left was for all to results
and face death: that on that morning we
would have to continue the Journey to the
front; that it was very probable that we
would encounter the Americans; that we
should resist them even though they
might kill us all; that we should endeavor
to break their columns so as to pass out
toward the mountains in the north. Af
terward he said: "Do you swear not to
abandon me?" The soldiers cried out that
they preferred death rather than to aban
don him into the hands of the enemy.
December 27.â 1t seems that our strength
Is becoming exhausted. The day Is fading
away; copious perspiration covers us from
head to foot; we have not yet eaten any
thing; night falls upon us and we find our
selves in the midst of several very high
mountains, unable to see anything on ac
count of the intense darkness. Suddenly the
soldiers In advance announce that It Is im
possible to continue marching, as the trail
is too narrow and they are in danger of
falling into the precipices. A rest was
ordered. All the soldiers at once sought
water for drinking purposes and to cook
their rice, but unfortunately there waa
none to be found. Thus It happened that,
in spite of our having eaten nothing all
day and of not being able to eat on this
night we had to make the best of our for
tune, or misfortune. We tightened our
belts, and, half-dead, we went to bed on
the ground among the rocks and trees,
whjch for the time were our bedding.
December 28.â We are up at 5 a. m. At
6 o'clock the honorable President ordered
us on the march. Bo we began the Jour
ney, though we sleet in the water last
night, had nothing to eat all day yester
day and without even having any break
fast now.
Same date.â One of the honorable Presi
dent's horses fell Into a precipice and
died. Finding no food In these regions to
appease our hunger, we laid hands on the
horse and utilized him for our luncheon.
Afterward we continued the journey un
til suddenly attacked by the Igorrotes.
The lances which they were throwing at
us came from many points.
December 29.â The Igorrotes again at
tacked us. â¢ â¢ â¢ We came to a river
on the side of a high mountain, and, while
we were passing down the mountain to
ward the said river, suddenly a rain of
rocks fell upon us, lasting a considerable
time. Fortunately for us we had no casu
alties.
A Period of Happiness.
January 5. 1900.â Hours seemed like years
to us, as we longed for daylight to come
at once so that we might continue the
march and reach the first town in Isa
bella inhabited not by Igorrotes but by
Christians. Now Indeed for us have fin
ished the lofty and extensive mountains
finished, after three months of living In
the depths of the woods and using the
scarce "camotes" as our food. Now our
lives are Indeed saved from those Igo
rotes, who are always armed with spears
and arrows and ready, at the least care
lessness, to rob us of our lives. Hunger,
thirst, heat, cold, laborious breathing,
nausea and swimming of the head, ex
haustion, the dark nights, and the trem
bling of our legs and kneesâ all of this
la past, and we are through with it for
good. â¢
January 7.â At 8 o'clock In the morning
we set out on the march, everybody ju
bilant. The soldiers sang to their light
footsteps. We ran across many deer and
wild caribous In the mountains. The hon
orable President shot two of the former.
January 20.-Captaln Vlllareal and his
forces remained In Carl* waiting for the
Americans, the forces being well ar
ranged. The people of the town notified
them that two Americana had arrived
accompanied by a Chinaman and ha,.
gone to the house of the telegraph oper
ator Our forces at once went to the
telegraph office. The Americans at once,
on seeing our soldiers, said: "Cosa. tu
Insurrecto?" (Jargon for "Who are you?
an Insurgent?") One of 'our soldiers re
plied. "Yes. good Insurgent: bring your
gun." The American answered: "Ameri
ca mucho bueno." and Immediately ran.
Our soldiers pursued them and fired some
shots, and in a few moments the soldiers
were dead.
January 21.-At 8 o'clock this morning
the Chinese companion of the two Ameri
can soldiers was executed.
A Thief in Camp.
January St.â When the forces were In
spected It was seen that the orderlies of
both Villa and Barcelona had made their
escape, that of the first having stolen
$50 and the honorable President's blan
ket. Â¦
Treachery of Tirona. .
February s.â At 12 o'clock there ar
rived In our camp Manuel Guzman, ex
. lieutenant of Tirona's unfortunate bat
talion. This officer, after telling us all
that occurred In the surrender of Caya
gan Valleyâ an act due to thÂ© Infamy,
cowardice and shamelessness of General
Tiranaâ also told us that the said gen
eral Is still with the American captain to
whom he surrendered. It has been* ob
served by everybody that the said gen
eral. In order to Ingratiate himself with
his master, the American captain, la act
ing as his personal servantâ now trying
to secure for him the most exquisite meals
possible, and now washing the dishes and
quarreling with the cook and private ser
vants of the capfain; and then, again,
cleaning the captain's table. And when
thÂ» hour arrives for the captain to write.
General Tironn goes into the office ahead
of him and gets the pen and inkstand in
his hands, ready to offer to his master,
the captain, the pen when he wishes to
write. Also, that this general was occu
pying himself every morning In cleaning
the captain's shoesâ one word, he was
promoted to be majordomo. ,
Horse Races and Executions.
February 6.â At 4 o'clock in the after
noon, at the instance of Senor Villa, there
was a race between his horse and that of
the "Count of Camote." The race was
won by Senor Villa's horse, a present to
him from the honorable President.
February 7. â At 4:30 o'clock the troops
were formed to take part in the execu
tion of Domingo Calinga, the deserter,
but the honorable President on seeing
that the criminal had already been car
ried out to be executed, at once wrote
an order or pardon and immediately dis
patched It by courier to save the crim
inal's life. The Judge Advocate, after
perusing the pardon, read it aloud In thÂ©
presence of all; and Immediately every
body cried out: "Hurrah for the honor
able President! Hurrah for Independ
ence t"
February 10.â About 1 o'clock this after
noon we received, from a source some
what trustworthy, the grateful news that
our independence has been recognized by
five nations, though we do not know who
these five nations are. But we made this
news pass from one ear to another. In
spite of the fact that It Is much desired
by all, we are quite bored with contin
ually hearing this news.
Agninaldo Warned.
Same date.â At 9 o'clock the honorable
President received a letter from a patriot
In Ilagan Informing us that in the provin
cial capital the hostile forces were prepar
ing for an involving forward movement
toward our camp so as to catch (so they
say) the honorable President.
February 28.â While we were ascending
the first mountain encountered in our
march this morning, the honorable Presi
dent noticed that all our faces were pale
and covered with abundant perspiration,
our respiration laborious, that there were
complaints of thirst, obscurity of vision
and nausea, and in a loud voleÂ© he said
to all: "What a costly thing is indepen
dence! How we are suffering!" On hear
ing this everybody cried out in the Interior
of the mountains: "Hurrah for Indepen
dence!"
March 4.â While crossing the rtver the
velocity of Its current was so great that
we had to grasp one another in order to
keep from being swept away: and while
the cold was killing us we sought to dis
tract attention from our sufferings by say
ing: "What troublesome jokes are these
of Otis!" ' 2 â¢

been coming to congratulate him since
yesterday evening at 5:30 o'clock, and
twenty-five soldiers have organized a band
of music, using as Instruments the bam
boos, muslcong. bumbong. Their congrat
. ulations have been solemn and imposing,
because the honorable President, after re- A
ceivlng them affectionately, offered sweet
] meats, cigars and wines to all. The hon

gratitude to all and at the same timeAGUINALDO'S CHIEF OF STAFF

arrived when we could all gather together
and give outward expression to our senti
ments which are all converging on one
purposeâ defense of the Independence
of our country, which finds herself In the
claws of an ambitious nation. We prefer
to live in these mountains rather than
submit to foreign rule.
March 26.â At 2 o'clock this morning the
honorable President was attacked with
severe gastralgia, accompanied by vomit-
Ing and cold sweats. But. thanks to the
administering of remedies, the disease
yielded readily about 3 a. m.

r.ews about the coming of the Americans.
May 17.â This morning we did not know
how to carry our sick soldiers, who, on
account of the seriousness of their condi
tion, cannot walk. There was no remedy

shrunkenâ ln fact there was a complete
debilitation of the body, attended with
profound mental prostration.
Lashed Themselves Together.
May After having walked about two
miles, we came to the first river. The
current being somewhat swift, we lashed
ourselves together In order to ford the
stream. As soon as we crossed over we
struck the second river. Tying ourselves
together, we immediately entered it. But
as the velocity of the current was some
what greater than that of the previous
river, many of us were swept away.
A Social Diversion.
May 28.â Senor Villa was sent ahead to
prepare the town of Enrile for a recep

Senor Villa posed as the hospital steward

it is well known by the Inhabitants of

able President made a brilliant speech,

GOSSIP OF THE ART
WORLD AT HOME
AND ABROAD.
â¢a, V EWS from New York says that
/\ I the well known California artist,
>l Julian Rix, will this coming
V^ spring desert his New York
studio for a time, and return to
his old home in California. Mr. Rix thinks
6f establishing a temporary studio in San
ta Barbara, but will in all probability
tour the State making studies for future
use. Charles Dickman has proved his a<
legiance to picturesque Monterey by pur
chasing a romantic b^it of land lying mid
way between the old capital and Pacific
Grove. After the club exhibition and the
holidays Mr. Dickman will return to Mon
terey to superintend the building of the
jolliest kind of a bungalow and studio. As
this artist's popularity does not confine
itself to San Francisco, Monterey can look
forward to some social life when the bun
galo is completed.
K. J. Eloomer has a great deal of work
under way. Living as he does In the
suburbs of San Rafael, he has had the
advantage over his fellow artists, for he
has only to step to the door In order to
have the most charming stretch of wood
land pose for his brush. At present Mr.
Bloomer is working upon a marine â the
subject, an old deserted boat over which
break the waves. There is just x a little
pathos In this lonesome looking craft that
has outlived its usefulness, and lies half
burled in the sand and spray. Mr. Bloom
er caught the movement of the water
as it rolls landward, the green transpar
ency of the white-capDed wave, and the
effect Is very beautiful.
Few of the artists have made a greater
stride in their profession In one year's
time than has J. M. Gamble. This artist,
who has heretofore been painting in some
what prosaic detail, has this season taken
a new stand with splendid result. Some
of his last studies, scenes from the Rus
sian River country, painted In a low tone,
are full of poetry- One, entitled "After
the Storm," is particularly pleasing, for
it Is good In composition and has all the
atmosphere of a wet, threatening day.
Those who think times are not looking
up should visit some of the studios and be
convinced that money in the world of art
changes hands occasionally. This last
month was an especially happy one for
H. Breuer, for three of his good-sized
canvases were sold. One, an afternoon
landscape, was added to the fine collec
tion in F. Tillmann's gallery. A Contra
Costa scene was secured by Mr. Rath
burn, secretary of the Bohemian Club,
and Mr. McGee bought a picture of the
Cliffs, which was exhibited and much
admired at the recent Sorosls Club exhibi
tion. Frequent sales have always been
the best possible proof of good work.
The work of Mr. Breuer has a strength,
with a sentiment and delicacy of nature,
that mark's him as one of California's
best landscape painters.

mediocre work, would be as great an at

from a photograph the portrait of a de

picture was all right, only grandfather
had a wart on the left side of his chin.
So, according to Instruction, the wart waa
painted in, when soon another relative
strolled along. "Oh. but the wart Is on
the wrong side," said shew After a warm
discussion and much rubbing out and
painting In of the picture a general con
sultation of the entire family resulted in
still a divided opinion regarding the lo

to satisfy all concerned, painted a wart
on either side and sent the portrait home.

THE THANKSGIVING
CRANBERRY
THE CURTOUS INDUSTRY THAT
BRTNfSS PROM. A BOG THOU
SANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF
BUSHELS OF BERRIES AND '
DOLLARS TN THE MTLUONS
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND
bushels of cranberries will be eaten
by the people of the United States
Thanksgiving day. The men who
sell the berries say the chances are
the aggregate will go higher, but it will
certainly not fall below the number given.
As the total cranberry crop of 1901 Is
placed at 1,000,000 bushels, it will be seen
that in our section of the world man does
something besides give thanks on the ap
pointed day.
The housewife has paid for her cran
berries this year from 5 to 10 cents a
quart, generally the latter figure, accord
ing to the price the marketman or grocer
think* fits the occasion. The total value
ot this year's yield is $1,700,000 to the pro
ducer, The consumer will pay enough to
swell the aggregate amount finally paid
for the crop to $3,000,000. The latter is the
amount of money the cranberry crop will
put into circulation.
The new crop of berries began to drift
into the market early in September, The
first installment came, as usual, from
the Cape Cod country. In October the
Western and Jersey berries came Into the
market, closely followed by the Long Isl
and product. From the first was evident
that the crop was going to be greater
than that of 1900, which was 569,000 bush
els, and so it proved. The men who deal
in cranberries say that when they make
their last Thanksgiving sale the total
amount disocsed of to consumers in No
vember will be fully 400.000 â¢ bushels. The
cranberry is a Thanksgiving joy for rich
and poor, and it will be eaten this year
as never before.
Theoretically, the millions of people who
eat cranberries know where they come
from, of the growing and all. Practically,
sot five person* in a hundred know how
they grow, and the majority of those who
do know live in the vicinity of the
rarshes or boers. As a matter of fact,
cranberry growing is an industry in
which it requires considerable capital to
embark, and the cranberry vine which
produces the greater part of the crop is
carefully cultivated.
It costs from $300 to $500 an acre to pre
pare a cranberry bog or marsh and carry
it to a point of profitable productiveness.
Sometimes a salt marsh is selected, but
more often abandoned mill ponds are se
cured wherever possible, because the bot
toms of these prove to be by far the best
of all bogs. From five to ten inches of
clean, sharp sand is spread over the peaty
earth in either marsh or bop, and the up
rights or cranberry shoots Â¦ are either
placed therein in rows fourteen inches
apart, lifter the same plan adopted in the
case of cuttings from house plants,' or else
cut in short pieces and scattered over the
sand. The young shoots come up through
the rand as thick as wheat, making an
excellent growth, and the whole "surface
is matted with them. This mode requires
more vine:; than the other, but yields a
crop sooner than by planting in any other
way. The success of this method of hand
ling the uprights well illustrates the hard
iness of the cranberry vine, for, particu
larly where the upright* are practically
only stuck in the ground and left to grow,
they take root almost immediately, send
out runners which, in turn, take root, and
in three years* time the vine thus begun
comes Into bearing. In five years, if it has
received proper attention, a bog so begun
gives a liberal yield of fruit. . %
Cranberry bogs require a plentiful supply
of water, and to. provide this the grower
follows a system of irrigation. Ditches
are excavated through the bogs, and from

these. 180 to 300 feet apart. 1a.....-, â¢*
Cross ditches, are constructed, in whicn
the water runs from six to twelve inches
deep. The flow of water is regulated by
a gute, and the different sections of the
beg are separated by dikes.
These dikes are essential features of
the bug, because by their aid the flood
ing syistem is accomplished and regulated.
Fiost is the cranberry's enemy, and, sing
u:arlv, water is the only protection for
the berries. Thus, when a gower be
lieves a frosty night at hand, he floods
tho.:e sections of the bog where the fruit
remains ungathered, letting the water in
until its level is from 18 to 24 inches over
the tops of the vines. "With the coming
of the sun, the water is drained off, and
In a short time the ground is dry enough
for the pickers to work. After the crop
is gathered, in fact from the first of Oc
tober until the last of March, the bog
remains In a flooded state.
The cranberry vine blossoms in June,
and it is this appearance which gave the
berry its name. Just before expanding
into the perfect flower, the stem, calyx
and petals resemble the neck, head and
bill of a crane. Hence the name "craned
berry," which u^age has shortened to the
familiar cranberry.
In September the cranberry harvest be
gins, although October may more prop
erly be called the harvest month. When
the section of the bog where the picking
is to start is selected, it is divided into
rows, the boundary lines being marked
by stout twine, nanning the entire length
or width of the section. These rows vary
in width from two to three feet. A row
is assigned to a picker, who must strip
the vines therein thoroughly before he Is
allowed to change to another row.
The method of removing the berries
from the vines is 3imple and expeditious. T
The picker places his fingers, slightly
spread beneath the vine or oush, close to
the ground^ a quick upward movement,
and his hands have stripped the vine of
its fruit. The berries are dropped into
a pan by the picker's side. When this
pan becomes full it is emptied into a pail
holding one-third of a bushel. The con
tents of these pails is placed in crates.
The crates are taken to a storehouse,
where the berries are put through a win
nowing machine, which removes the dirt
and leaves gathered during the harvest
ing. Following this they are crated or
barreled, and made ready to ship to mar
ket
Three-fourths of the cranberry crop of
the United States finds an Eastern mar
ket. The remainder stays in the Middle
and Western States. Every year a small
consignment of cranberries is shipped to
Europe, and statistics show a slight but
steady increase in exportation. It 13 only
natural that this increase should occur,
because the American cranberry is in
efldbly superior to the European.
Gauged by the eternal fitness of thin^r^
New lingland, the home of the ThankW
giving turkey and the cranberry, ought

QUEEREST SURGICAL
OPERATION ON RECORD
FROM a late adventure among the
Passamaquoddy Indians, who live
on the border of New Brunswick.
Dr. Robert Loud of Boston, who ha^
been hunting bears in the Maine woods
for the yast month, believes that the ab
original inhabitants of America are pos
sessed of a wide knowledge of medicin*
and surgery, using some methods which
may bÂ» adopted into general practice with
benefit to the pubMc. Late in August
whiie camping on the Micmac River h*
had the misfortune to cut a deep gash in
his leg, which bled copiously and caused
urn much pain and trouble until he ww
so fortunate as to receive a visit from
Chief Oku. a great medicine man of the
tribe, whose tame is known among all
the Indians of the Eastern States. The
cut was badly inflamed when Oku ar
rived, hut he at once reduced the swelling
by bathing the leg- with a decoction of
elm bark and tying up the wound in fresh
clay from a brook. When Dr. Loud asked
the Indian to take some stitches in the
cut Oku replied:
"Heem no good. Tread heem mak - heÂ»ra
swell up, so be sore. See wat Oku heem
do."
The chief went to a clearing and re
turned with a dozen large and very livHy
brown ants. Then. ?rasp,ng the two s.des
or the cut between his thumb and nn^-r
and pinching them together, he caused an
ant to bite at the edge, putting his
through both sides of the cut and d<
them as firmly as if they had been in a
vise. When he had applied eight auts ;r>
this manner he coolly pulled oft their bod
ies, leaving nothing but their heads at
tached.
"Now heem bin stay there till beem
sore geec well." said Oku. winding j.
bandage of suit cloth around the le,
fastening it as neatly as a trained nurse
could have done, 'in nine dayâ twelva
day. maybe, take off cloth; find heem 411
well."
Dr. Loud followed instructions and cntna
out cured. The heads of tho ants had
held on as rirm!> as pincers, and alt:
the insects wer# long dead it re-;
considerable torce to pull away the locked
jaws. Dr. Loud also believes that the
formic acid which the ants secrete from
their mandibles has antiseptic qualities- *
which are unknown to medicine, and pro
posea to make a few experiments along
this line on hi 3 return to Boston.â New

dried pea roup, which is not to be de
spjsed.
In one of the suburban towns a year
or two ago several neighbors who were
the best of friends decided to have a co
uperative dinner. Tl.is not on the score
of economy, but for sociability. This
proved a great success financially, from a
labor-saving point cf view and, more
than all, for the Jolly good time It afford
ed both the older people and the children.
At the old homestead where the dinner
was served the turkey was roasted, the
vegetables cooked and the coffee mndo.
One housekeeper whose bread and pastry
had achieved more than a local reputa-.
tion brought the vheaten loaves, the
golden pumpkin pies and the flaky cran
berry tarts to grace the feast. A second
furnished a big pan of luscious scalloped
oysters, with crispy iringco" celery and
home-made jelly. A third, who hurl in
herited her gift for- dainty- cookery from
a line of famous Dutch hausfraus,
brought a delectable s^alad, a store of
wondrous home-made pickles and cakes
tha*. would melt in your mouth, while a
foui'thâ a bachelor maidâ supplied the
fragrant coffee and the salted almonds.
Home-made bonbons and artistic: menus
and name cards were the gift of another,
while all brought happy faces, contented
hearts and a Ftore cf overflowing good
humor, that made the co-operative dirfher
a function long to be pleasantly remem
bered. '
In arranging the Thanksgiving table do
not go to the absurdity of using ribbon
decorations, which really have no raison
d'etre on any table. The snowy linen
cloth or the polished mahogany or oak
need no such fictitious and unmeaning
accessories as bows and loops of ribbon to
enhance their Attractions. If flowers are
used golden chrysanthemums, dark red
asters or stalks of scarlet salvia. the gifts
of the rich auiumn, are always appro
priate. Fruit makes always an effective
center for the Thanksgiving table, and
one truer to tradition than flowers. Ar
range It on a low glass or silver dish,
placing a reflector under it if you have
one. Take pains with the color effects.
Select the rosiest, yellowest apples and
burnish until yt<u car. see your reflection.
Choose the yellow brewn pears and the
rich purple and white grapes, and these,
with the scarlet of your radishes, the
crisp green and white of your celery and
the rich brown of tuikey, will give you
all the color you need. If the dinner Is
served in the afternoon, as was the
Thanksgiving dinner of our ancestors,
you will need no artificial light. If lights
must be used candles are the best means
of lighting, as they do not destroy the
pure atmosphere of the room.
If the cooking of turnips, onions and
so forth has left the least suggestion of
their preparation In the dining-room pour
a few drops of oil of lavender in a vase
or bowl and half fill with hot water. This
gives a delightful freshness to the room
and is a valuable expedient to bear in
mind in cases when the house is prone

A most delicious sauce to accompany
game, roast or broiled birds or poultry

Some men seem born to carve turkey.

knowledge of his turkeyship's anatomy,
a platter large enough to allow for the
play of knife and bird, and a conscience
void of offense that will give a steady
nerve. These requisites maintained, the
carving of a fine, plump, well browned
turkey is a Bight to be thankful for. Hav
ing personally seen to it that his blade
1b keen before dinner is announced, the
deft carver will plunge his fork Into the
breast of the fowl, having the reck end

separate the two thigh Joints from the
body, passing the knife between the legs
and the body, pressing the former out
ward and dividing the joints. Next carve
the wings from the shoulder joints, after
which the breast is to be sliced down

If you do not care for oyster or chest
nut stuffing, try this of rice which proved
its popularity at the Rice Kitchen at the
Pan-American Exposition: Brown a chop
ped onion in some butter and mix with it
two cupfuls of boiled rice and one cupful
of bread crumbs which have been mois
tened in a cupful of milk. Season with
salt, pepper, sage or other sweet herbs
as preferred, and add half a pound of
sausage meat chopped fine. Stir all the
ingredients until thoroughly mixed, then
stuff the prepared turkey and secure the
openings.
To prepare thÂ© radish flowers for the
table, select the smooth, round, hard ones.
Wash, trim off the threadlike root, but
leave about an inch of the green stalk
and leaves, which Is really the choice
bit of the radish. With a sharp knife cut
from the tip down about half way to thÂ«
stem, making six cuts and merely through
the skin. Slip the point of the knife un
der these petals and press back slightly;
then put In ice water to open out, until
ready to serve. Drain thoroughly and ar
range in a pretty, low dish.
An excellent stuffing for ducks is made
by adding a half cupful of peanuts rolled
fine to th% ordinary bread dressing.
A little manila vegetable hand brush
will be found most convenient for cleans
ing celery. Scrub each stalk lengthwise,
rinse thoroughly, then with a sharp knife
perape off all rusty lines and lay on the
ice until ready to serve.
A celery cream soup can be made from
the outer and tougher stalks of the
celery heads, which are unfit for the
table. Take three stalks (which should
be the equivalent of two bunches and
must be bleached) wash well. trim, off the
green leaves, cut into small pieces and
boil slowly for three-quarters of an hour
in a quart of water or of water and white
stock in equal proportions. Strain the
celery and water in which it was cooked
through a puree sieve, pressing: the pulp
of the vegetable through. Add a quart
of milk, and when the mixture comes to
the boiling 1 point thicken with two large
tablespoonfuls of flour mixed with the
same amount of butter and thinned with
a little of the boiling soup. Stir steadily
for eight or ten minutes after adding the
thickening, and season with salt and pep
per. It may be made still richer by the
addition of the yolks of two eggs beaten
In a cup with a little milk or cream. Draw
the kettle to the back of the stove, add
enough of the hot soup to the mixture
to heat it and prevent Its curdling, then
stir quickly Into the remainder of the
soup. Serve with croutons cut from stale
bread into small hearts, circles or die*
and browned In the oven.
In place of egg thickening for oefery
soup, many think that the addition of one
quarter of a cupful of almonds chopped
to a paste Is a great improvement to cel
ery soup.
Sorbets or Roman punch are th* ioe*
properly served in the midst of the din
ner. If game la offered the Ice follows
the roast and precedes the game. Sor
bets, like punch, are merely iced or only
partially frozen. They should be of a
smooth, even cream-like consistency. The
sorbet may be served in the dainty cupa
of crystal made for the purpose, or In
little Impromptu cups of lemon or orange
lirid. Set on a pretty china plate. Can
died rose leaves or violets are sometime*
scattered over these ices.
A most delicious lemon ice may be made
In this way: To one quart of milk add
the juice of six lemons and a cup and one
half of sugar, or more if need be. Freeze
at once. Do not be alarmed if It ourdles;
It will come all right as It freezes. This
may be flavored with ginger if preferred,
or colored a delicate pink by adding a
small quantity of strawberry, raspberry
or cranberry juice.
EVOLUTION OF OPERA HAT.
THE opera hat," said the manager of
a fashionable hatting establishment,
"was formerly made almost exclu
sively of merino. There were a few
men who wore opera hats of ribbed ailk,
which they had made to order at a cost
of |12 each, the cost of the merino hat
being J7; and there were also a few, these
mostly older men, who wore opera hats
of black satin, whicn likewise they had
made to order. August Belmont wore a
satin opera hat.
"The merino hat, however, was long the
most generally worn, and so it remained
âand practically unchanged except that
it had come to be finished with sacin on
the under side of the brimâ until some
eight or ten years ago. Then men took
to wearing silk hats to *hÂ« opera, and the
distinctive opera hat fell Into disuse
took for an opera hat their oldest sillc
hat, which was as good as any for this
service, for, tucked ur.der a seat or into
the corner of a box. it was sure to be sub
jected to hard usage.
"This fancy for the silk hat as an opera
hat lasted two or three years, and then,
about seven years ago. the opera hat was
again restored to full favor, which it still
holds. But while it went out, so to speak,
in merino it came back after that brief
period of collapse In ribbed silk, of whichi
material, once regarded as a sort of lux
ury In this U3e, by tar the greater num
ber of the opera hau worn are now
mad*.'

their heads, they work, work, work.
"Are you fond of wheeling? Do you ride
for recreation? " was asked the women.
"Ride? We never want to see a wheel
outside of working hours," they an
ewercd.
Turn a sport :nto labor and it can never
be a sport again. The Kaufmanns can
not see a wheel and think of anything but
bread and butter and the sweat of their
brows wherein they eat it. That is. except
the wonder boy, Frank. He would ride
his steel charger to the ends of the earth
end no one said him nay.
In Eastern cities, where the continuous
performance goes, these people have to
chow their cleverness fourteen times a
Â¦week. They look upon us as a snap be
cause we let them off with ten times.
But West or T'ast or in London or on the
Continent. wherever they may be, two
hours' morning practice is the infallible
rule.
"That two hours is given to perfecting
Old work and develor-iri?: new," says Nick,
the big one, the leader of the troupe. "If
there has been any mistake during a per
lormance the trick which failed must be
practiced over end over to make sure that
the thing doesn't happen again. Then we
must keep learning new things. The pub
lic demands that. Sometimes it takes two
years to develop a trick after it h?.s been
thought of. It will occur to one of us,
and we will bo sure it can be done; but
first attempts prove failures. Nothing
but practice solves the problem. â¢
"It Is a curious fact that tricks nearly
always are discovered by accident. In
the daily practice one of us often stum
bles upon something new. Perhaps we
happen to do some stunt while trying an
other, and immediately the idea occurs
that the accidental movement can be
made into a trick. Then arises the dif
ficulty of doing it again.
"We try and try and repeatedly fail.
But inasmuch as we know that it has
been done once we know that it can be
done again, and to that end we work.
"The reward of this perseverance is the
fact that a trick once learned is never
forgotten. After you know how to do it
it comes bo easy that you wonder if there
was ever a time when you didn't know it,
and you couldn't unlearn it if you tried."
' Downstairs in the two dressing-rooms
the six were making tip deliberately, eas
ily. There was no flutter of anxiety as
their time drew near. Serious accidents
never happen, therefore they never worry
about them. Wallie. the baby, the 14
year-older. was chirping "Tell Me, Pretty
Maiden " in his high soprano while he
lazily adjusted his pink and green cos
tume. Frank loafed down the aisle be
tween the dressing-rooms to ask at the
women's door:
"Black or tan?"
"Black," was the answer.
"We have to change our shoes often."
Mary, the elder of the women, explained.
"In fact, we have to change our costumes
all the time. We must keep showing
something new, not in tricks, but
oven in dress, or we will be back num
bers before we know it."
She took down her ow n black boots and
began to lace them. They were high
higher than the men's, but otherwise like
their*. They are made especially for the
troupe, all of soft, strong leather, the
scles like the tops, ht^l'iess. and with the
laces reaching far down the toes, to give
all the spring possible.
"The soles have to be soft so that we
can feel' the pedals," they explained.
Otherwise? there is nothing peculiar
about the costumes. The women wear
silk tights, stays, blouse and trousers".
They claim that the ftays firmly laced
are no hindrance in their gyrations. So
much for your physical culture hobby
ists.
All of the bunch, men and women, are
a well formed lot. Dancers are proverb
ially fiat-chested, acrobats are apt to be
overdeveloped as to mui-cle, but these
bicyclists are firm, well rounded, vigor
ous and graceful. They believe them
selves that such riding as they do is
ideal exercise, but say that is a very
different matter from racing.
"Racing is out of our line." says Nick.
"There isn't pne of us could make any
fancy time in a race. I used to have a
hand at that sort of thing now and then
in early days before safeties were in
vented and when my horse was one of
the o!d-fashione<j high wheels; when the
record was at somewhere in the neigh
borhood of three minutes instead of one.
But there is no good in racing; it wears
a man out instead of building him up.""
The Kaufmann bicycles are not particu
larly different from those that all of us
use. They are not made 10 order, al
though each performer is entirely de
pendent upon his own wheel, w r hich he
knows. It is adjusted to suit the needs;
each one is arranged with no brake, a
coaster, smaller gear than usual, and an
ordinary saddle. The wheels are very
strong in the cranks. The tires must be
pumped according to the stage, being
deflated much more for use on a slippery
floor.
That matter of the stage is an impor
tant consideration. The Kaufmanns say
that the only nervousness they ever feel
is the first night on a new stage. The
size, the slope, the shape, are all impor
tant to their nicely adjusted work, and
the slightest difference in any of these
points is felt.

in Bohemia he was born and there his
father gave the youngster his first music

excepting market gardeners. Later on
Jan appeared at the Prague Conservatory
as a prodigy. Trie child wonder grew into
a man wonder, and Kubelik has made a
tremendous sensation in Europe of latb.
His greatest success has been in England,
where he has played for two seasons in
concerts. His programmes are chiefly
made up of the Paganini repertoire.

?T *Â» ER Highness," announced a maid,

JL / that vert to his troubled soul like
%y a coolirr draught to the fevered
throat. He turned toward her instantly,
&!1 the Irritation, all the uneasiness, ail
the loneliness vanishing like mist before

infr.
"I cannot deny the request of a Prin
cess." he rcFpor.ded, smiling gayly. He
held forth his band toward her, half -fear-.
ing she would not take it.
The Princess Yetive came straight to

drew it to his lips and then released it

"Are you better?" she asked, with her
pretty accent. "I have been so troubled
about you."
"I thought you had forgotten me," he
Bald, with childish petulance.
"Forgotten you!" she cried, quick to
resent the imputation. "Let me tell you,
then, what I have been doing while for
retting. I have sent to the Regengetz
for your luggage and your friend's. You
â¢will find it much more comfortable here.
You are to make this house your home
as long as you are in Edelweiss. That Is
how I have been forgetting."
"Forgive me!" he cried, his eyes
gleaming. "I have been bo lonely that I
Imagined all sorts of things. 'But, your
Highness, you must not expect us to re
main here after I am able to leave. That
Â¦would be Imposingâ"
"I will not allow you to say it!" she
objected, decisively. "You are the guest
of honor in Graustark. Have you not
preserved its ruler? Was it an imposition
to risk your life to save one in whom you
had but passing Interest, even though
ehÂ© were a. poor Princess? No. my Amer
ican, this castle is yours in all rejoicing,
for had you not come within Its doors to
day would have found it in mournful
terror. Besides, Mr. Anguish has said he
â¢will stay a year If we insist."
"That's like Harry." laughed Lorry.
t"But I am afraid you are glorifying two
\ rattle-brained chaps who should be in a
home for imbeciles Instead of in the cas-
# tle their audacity might have blighted.
Our rashness was only surpassed by our
phenomenal good luck. By chance It
turned out well; there were ten thonsand
chances of ignominious failure. Had we
failed would we have been guests of
honor? No! We would have been stoned
from Graustark. You don't know how
thin the thread was that held your fate.
It makes me shudder to think of the
crime our act might have been. Ah, had
I but known you were the Princess, no
chances should have been taken," he
sand, fervently.
"And a romance spoiled," she laughed.
"So you are a Princessâ a real Prin
of?s." he went on, as if he had not heard
her. "I knew it. Something told me you
were not an ordinary womanâ"
"Oh. but I am a very ordinary woman,"
Â£he remonstrated- "You do not know how
pasy it is to be a Princess and a mere
woman at the same time. I have a heart,
a head, breathe and eat and drink and
f leep and love. Is it not that way with all
women?"
"You breathe and eat and drink and
s=l rep and love in a different world,
( â¢ lhougrh. your Highness.".
"Ach: my little maid, Therese, Bleeps as
poundly, eats as heartily and loves as
warmly as I, so a fig for your argument."
"You may breathe the same air, but
would you love the same man that your
maid might love?"
"Is Â¦ man the only excuse for love?"
Fhe asked. "If so, then I must say that
I breathe ana eat and drink and sleepâ
and that is aIL"
"Pardon me. but some day you will find
that love Is a man, and"â here he laughed
â"you will neither breathe, nor eat, nor
sleep except with him in your heart. Even
a Princess is not proof against a man."
"Is a man proof against a Princess?"
the asked, as she leaned against the
casement.
"It depends on the"â pausedâ "the
Princess, I should say."
"Alas! There Is onÂ© more fresh re
sponsibility acquired. It seems to me that
everything depends on the Princess." she
said merrily.
"Not entirely," he said quickly. "A
great dealâ very great dealâ depends on
circumstances. For Instance, when you
â¢were Miss Guggenslocker it wouldn't
have been necessary for the man to be a
Prince, you know."
"But I was Miss Guggenslocker because
a. mas was unnecessary," she said, so
gravely that he smiled. "I was without a
a. title because it was more womanly than
to be a 'freak,' as I should have been had
every man, woman and child looked upon
me as a Princess. I did not travel through
your land for the purpose of exhibiting
myself, but to learn and unlearn."
"1 remember it cost you a certain coin
to learn one thing," he observed.
"It was money well spent, as subse
quent events have proved. I shall never
regret the spending of that half gawo.
Was It not the means of bringing you to
Edelweiss
"Well, it was largely responsible, but I
am inclined to believe that a certain de
sire on my part would have found a way
without the assistance of the coin. You
don't know how persistent an American
can be."
"Would you have persisted had you
known I was a. Princess?" she asked.
"Well, I can hardly tell about that, but
you must remember I didn't know who or
what you were."
"Would you nave come to Graustark
had you known I was its Princess?"
"I'll admit I came because you were
Miss Guggenslocker."
"A mere woman."
"I will not consent to the word 'mere.'
What would you think of a man who
came half-way across the earth for the
Bake of a mere woman?"
"I should say he had a great deal of
curiosity," Bhe responded, coolly.
. "And not much sense. There is but one
* man a man would do so mu<* for, and
the could not be a mere woman in hl3
eyes." Lorry's face was white and hi*
eyes gleamed as he hurled this bold con
clusion at her. - . ,/
"Especially when he learns that she is
a Princess!" said she, her voice so cold
and repellent that his eyes closed involun
tarily, as if an unexpected horror had
come before them. "You must not tell
me that you came to see me."
"But I did come to see you and not the
Princess Votive of Graustark. How was
I to know?" he cried, impulsively.
"But you are no longer ignorant," she
eaid, looking from the window.
"I thought you said you were a mere
woman!"
"I amâ and that Is the trouble!" she
eaid, slowly turning her eyes back to him.
Then she abruptly sank to the window
eat near his head. "That Is the trouble.
I gay. A woman is a woman, although
she be a Princess. Don't you understand
*'hy you must not cay such things to
tneT'
"Because you are a Princess?" he said,
bitterly.
"No; because I am a woman. As a
Twoman I want to hear them, as a Prin
ter ss I cannot. Now, have I made you un-
Cerstand? Have I been bold enough? " Her
lace was burning.
"Youâ you don't mean that you "he
G. B. McCUTCHEON
half-whispered, drawing himself toward
her, his face glowing.
"Ach: What have I said?"
"You have said enough to drive me
mad with desire for more," he cried,
seizing her hand, which she withdrew in
stantly, rising to her feet.
"I have only said that I wanted to hear
you say you had come to see me. Is not
that something for a woman's vanity to
value? I am sorry you have presumed
to misunderstand me." She was cold
again, but he was not to be baffled.
"Then be a woman and forget that you
are a Princess until I tell you why I
came," he cried.
"I cannot: I mean. I will not listen to
you," she said, glancing about helplessly,
yet standing still within the danger cir
cle.
"I came because I have thought of you
and dreamed of you since the day you
sailed from New York.. God, can I ever
forget that day!"
"Please do not recallâ" she began,
blushing and turning to the window.
"The kiss you threw to me? Were ycu
a Princess then?" She did not answer,
and he paused for a moment, a thought
striking him which at - first he did not
dare to voice. Then he blurted it out.
"If you do not want to hear me say these
things, why do you stand there?"
"Oh." she faltered.
"Don't leave me now. I want to say
what I came over here to say, and then
you can go back to your throne and your
royal reserve, and I can go back to thÂ©
land from which you drew me. I came
because I love you. Is not that enough
to drag- a man to the end of the world?
I came to marry you If I could, for you
were Miss Guggenslocker to me. Then
you were within my reach, but not now!
I can only love a Princess!" He stopped
because she had dropped to the couch
beside him, her serious face turned ap
pealingly to his, her fingers . clasping his
hands fiercely. -Â¦".'-..
"I forbid you to continueâ l forbid you!
Do you hear? I, too, have thought and
dreamed of you, and I have prayed that
you might come. But you must not tell
me that you love meâ shall not!""
"I only want to know that you lova
me," he whispered.
"Do you think I can tell you the
truth?" she cried. "I do not love you!"
Before he had fairly grasped the im
portance of the contradictory sentences
she left his side and stood in the window,
her breast heaving and her face flaming.
"Then I am to believe'; you do." he
groaned, after 'a moment. *Â«I find a Prin
cess and lose a woman!"
"I did not intend that you should have
said what you have, or that I should
have told you what I have. I knew you
loved me or you would not have come to
me." she said, softly.
"You would have been selfish enough
to enjoy that knowledge without giving
joy in return. I see. What else couid
you have done? A princess. Oh. I would
to God you were Miss Guggenslocker, the
woman I sought!"
"Amen to that." she said. "Can I trust
you never to renew this subject? We
have each learned what had better been
left unknown. You understand my posi
tion. Surely you will be good enough
to look upon me ever afterward as a
princess and forget that I have been a*
woman unwittingly. I ask you, for your
sake and my own, to refrain from a re
newal of this unhappy subject. You can
see how hopeless it is for both of us.
I have said much to you that I trust you
will cherish as coming from "a woman
who could not have helped herself an
who has given to you the. power to undo
her with a single word. I know you will
always be the brave, true man my heart
has told me you are. You will let the be
ginning be the end?"
The appeal was so earnest, so noble
that honor swelled in his heart and came
from his lips in this promise:
"You may trust me, \ your Highness.
Your secret is worth a thousand
more than mine. It is sacred with me.
The joy of my life has ended, but the
happiness of knowing the truth will never
die. I shall remember that you love m
âyes, I know you doâ and 1 shall never
forget to love you. I will not promise
that I shall never speak of it again to
you. As I lie here, there comes to me a
courage I did not know I could feel."
"No, no!" she cried, vehemently.
"Forgive me. You can at least let me
say that as long as I live I may cherish
and encourage the little hope that all. is
not dead. Your Highness, let me say that
my family never knows when it is de
feated, either in love or in war."
"The walls which surround* the heart
of a princess are black and grim, impene
trable when she defends it, my boasting
American," she said, smiling sadly.
"Yet some prince of the realm will bat
ter down the wall and win at a singlo
blow that which a mere man could not
conquer in ten lifetimes. Such is the
world."
"The Prince may batter down and seize,
but he can never conquer. But enough of
this! I am the Princess of Graustark;
you are my friend, Grenfall Lorry, and
there Is only a dear friendship between
us," she cried, resuming her merry humor
bo easily that he started with surprise
and not a little displeasure.
"And a throne," he added, smiling, how
ever.
"And a promise," she reminded him.
"From which I trust I may some day be
released," said he, sinking back, afflicted
with a discouragement and a determina
tion of equal power. He could see hope
and hopelessness ahead.
"By death!"
"No; by life! It may bo sooner than
you think!"
"You are forgetting your promise al
ready."
"Your Highness* pardon," he begged.
They laughed, but their hearts were
sad, this luckless American and hapless
sovereign who would, If she could, be a
woman.
"It Is now 2 o' cloakâ the hour when you
were to have called to see me," she said,
again sitting unconcernedly before him. in
the window seat. She was not afraid of
him. She was a Princess.
"I misunderstood you, your Highness.
I remembered the engagement, â¢ but it
seems I was mistaken as to the time. I
came at 3 In the morning!"
"And found me at home!"
"In an Impregnable castle, with ogres
all about." .â¢â¢-Â¦.;;â¢ . l :

A WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
Lorry was removed to another room
before dinner, .as she had promised.
After they had dined the two strangers
were left alone for : several hours. An
guish regaled his friend with an enthusi
astic dissertation on the charms of one
Countess Dagmar, lady in waiting to the
Princess. In conclusion he said glow
ingly, his cigar having been out for half
an hour or more because his energy had
been spent in another direction:
"You haven't seen much of her, "Lorry.
but I tell you she is rare. And she's not
betrothed to any of these confounded
counts or dukes either. They all adore
her, but she's not committed.""
"How do you' know all this?" demanded
Lorry, who but half heard through his
dreams.
"Asked her, of course. How In thunder Â»
do you suppose?" , m
"And you've known her but a day?
Well, you are progressive."
"Oh, perfectly natural conversation, you
know," explained Anguish, composedly.
"She began it by asking me if I were ~
married, and I said I wasn't even en
gaged. Then I asked her if she were
married. You see, from the title, you
can't tell whether a Countess is married
or single. She said she wasn't, and I
promptly and very properly expressed my
amazement. By Jove, she has a will and
a mind of her own, that young wuman
has. She's not going to marry until she
finds a man of the right sortâ which is
refreshing. I like to hear a girl talk like
that, especially a pretty girl who can deal
in princes, counts and ail kinds of nobil
ity when it comes to a matrimonial trade.
By Jove, I'm sorry for the Princess,
though."
"Sorry for the Princess? Why?" askÂ»d
the other, alert at once.
"Oh, just because it's not in her power
to be so independent. The Countess says
she cries every right when she thinks of
what the poor girl has to contend with "
"Tell me about it."
"I don't know anything to tell. I'm
not interested in the Princess, and I
didn't have the nerve to ask many ques
tions. I do know, however, that she is
going to have an unpleasant matrimonial
alliance forced upon her in some way "
That ia usual."
"That's what I gather from the Count
ess Maybe you can pump the Countess
and get all you want to know in connec
tion with the matter. It's a pretty seri
ous state of affairs, I should say, or she
wouldn't be weeping through sympathy "
Lorry recalled a part of the afternoon s
sweetly dangerous conversation, and the
perspiration stood cold and damp on hn
brow.
"Well, old man, you've chased Miss
Guggenslocker to earth only to find hei
an impossibility. Pretty hopeless for you
Lorry, but don't let it break you up com
pletely. We can go back home after a
while and you will forget her. A Countess
of course, is different."
"Harry, I know it Is downright madness
for me to act Mke this," said Lorry, hi.*
jaws set and his hands clenched as ha
raised himself to his elbow. "You don't
know how much I love her."
"Your nerve is to be admired, butâ well,
I'm sorry for you."
"Thanks for your sympathy. I suppose
I'll need it," and he sank back gloomily.
Anguish was rightâ absurdly right.
There was a rap at the door and An
guish hastened to open It. A servant
handed him Count Halfont's card.
"Shall we see the old boy?" asked Har
ry.
"Yes, yes," responded the other. The
servant understood the sign made by An.
guish and disappeared. "Diplomatic call,
I suspect."
"He is the Prime Minister, I under
stand. Well, we'll diplome with him un
til bedtime, if he cares to stay. I'm get
ting rather accustomed to the nobility.
They are not so bad, after all. Friendly
and all that Ah, good evening, your
Excellency! We are honored."
The Count had entered the room an 3
was advancing toward the couch, tall,
easy and the personification of cordiality.
"I could not retire until I had satisfied
myself as to Mr. Lorry's condition and
his comfort." paid he, in his broken Eng
lish. He seated himself near the couch
and bent sharp, anxious eyes on the re
cumbent figure.
"Oh, he's all right," volunteered An
guish, readily. "Be able to go into battlj
again to-morrow."
â¢That is the way with you aggressive
Americans, 1 am told. They never give
up until they are dead," said the Count,
courteously. "Your head is better?"
THE SUNDAY CALL.
Before he had fairly grasped the
importance of the contradictory sen
tences she had left his side and stood
ii the window, her breast heaving
and her face flaming.
fc It does not pain me as It did, and I'm
sure I'll be able to get out to-morrow.
Thank you very much for your interest,"
said Lorry. "May I inquire after the
health of the Countess Halfont? The ex
citement of last night has not had an
unpleasant effect, I hope."
"She is with the Princess, and both are
quite well. Since our war. gentlemen,
Graustark women have nothing to acquire
in the way of courage and endurance.
You, of course, know nothing of the hor
rors of that war."
"But we would be thankful for the
story of it, your Excellency.- War is a
hobby of mine. I read every war scare
that gets into print," said Anguish, ea
gerly.
"We of Graustark at present have every
reason to recall the last war and bitterly
to lament Its ending. The war occurred
Just fifteen years agoâ but will the re
cital tire you, Mr. Lorry? I came to spend
a few moments socially and not to go
into history. At any other time I shall
be "
"It will please and hot tire me. I am
deeply interested. Pray go on," Lorry
hastened to say f for he was interested
more than the Count suspected.
"Fifteen years ago Prince Ganlook of
this principalityâ the father of our Yetlve
âbecame incensed over the depredations
of the Axphain soldiers who patrolled our
border on the north. He demanded resti
tution for the devastation they had cre
ated, but was refused. Graustark is a
province comprising some eight hundred
square miles of the best land in this part
of the world. Our neighbor is smaller In
area and population. Our army was bet
ter equipped but not so hardy. For sev
eral months the fighting in the north was
in our favor, but the result was that our
forces were finally driven back to Edel
weiss, hacked and battered by the fierce
thousands that came over the border. The
nation was staggered by the shock, for
such an outcome had not been considered
possible. We had been too confident. Our
soldiers "were sick and worn by six
months of hard fighting, and the men of
Edelweissâ the merchants, the laborers
and the nobility itselfâ flew to arms in
defense of the city. For over a month
we fought, hundreds of our best and brav
est citizens going down to death. They
at last began a bombardment of the city.
To-day you can see the marks on nearly
every house in Edelweiss. Hundreds of
graves In the valley to the south attest the
terrors of that siege. The castle was
stormed, and Prince Ganlook, with many
of the chief men of the land, met death.
The Prince was killed in front of the
castle gates, from which he had sallied In
a last brave attempt to beat off the con
querors. A bronze statue now marks the
spot on which he fell. The Princess, his
wife, was my sister, and as I held the
portfolio of finance, it was through me
that the city surrendered, bringing the
siege to an end. Fifteen years ago this
autumnâ the 20th of November, to be ex
plicitâthe treaty of peace was signed in
Sofia, We were compelled to cede a por
tion of territory in the far northeast, val
uable for its mines. Indemnity was agreed
upon by the peace commissioners,
amounting to 20,000,000 gavvos, or nearly
150,000,000 in your money. In fifteen years
this money was to be paid, with interest.
On the 20th of November, thiÃ year, the
people of Graustark must pay 25,000,000
gavvos. The time is at hand, and that is
why we recall the war so vividly. It
means the bankruptcy of the nation, gen
tlemen."
Neither of his listeners spoke for some
moments. Then Lorry broke the silence.
"You mean that the money cannot be
raised?" he asked.
"It is not in our treasury. Our people
have been taxed so sorely in rebuilding
their homes and In recuperating from the
effect of that dreadful invasion that they
have been unable to pay the levies. You
must remember that we are a small na
tion and resourceless, gentlemen. Your
nation could secure $30,000,000 in one hour
for 1 the mere asking. To us it is like a
death blow. I am not betraying a state
secret in telling you of the sore straits
in which we are placed, for every man
in the nation has been made cognizant
of the true conditions. We are all fac
ing it together."
There was something so quietly heroic
in his manner that both men felt pity.
Anguish, looking at the military figure,
asked:
"You fought through the war, your Ex
cellency?"
"I resigned as Minister, sir, to go to
the front. I was in the first battle and I
was in the last," he said, simply.
"And the Princessâ the present ruler, I
meanâ was a mere child at that time.
When did she succeed to the throne?"
asked Lorry.
"Oh, the great world does not re
member our little history! Within a
year after the death of Prince Gan
look, his wife, my sister, passed away,
dying of a broken heart. Her daughter,
their only child, was, according to our
custom, crowned at once. She ha 3
reigned for fourteen years, and wisely
since assuming full power. For three
years she has been ruler de facto. She
has been frugal, and has done all in her
power to meet the shadow that is de
scending."
"And what is the alternative in case
the indemnity Is not paid?" asked Lorry,
breathlessly, for he saw something
bright in the approaching calamity.
"The cession of all that part of Grau
stark lying north of Edelweiss, including
fourteen towns, all of our mines and our
most productive farming and grazing
lands. In that event Graustark will be
no larger than one of the good-sized
farms in your western country. There
will be nothing left for the Princess
Yetive to rule save a tract so small that
the word principally will be a travesty
and a jest. Tms city and twenty-five
miles to the south, a strip about one hun
dred and fifty miles long. Think of It!
Twenty-five by one hundred and fifty
miles, and yet called a principality! Once
the proudest and most prosperous state in
the east, considering its size, reduced to
that! Ach, gentlemenâ gentlemen! I can
not think of it witnout tearing out a
heart string and suffering such pains as
mortal man has never endured. I lived
in Graustark's days of wealth, power and
supremacy; God has condemned me to
live in the days of her dependency, weak
ness and poverty. Let us talk no more
of this unpleasant subject."
His hearers pitied the frank, proud old
man from the bottoms of their hearts.
He had told them the story with the can
dor and simplicity of a child, admitting
weakness and despondency. Still he sat
erect and defiant, his face white and
drawn, his figure suggesting the famous
picture of the stag- at bay.
"Willingly, your Excellency, since it Is
distasteful to you. I hope, however, you
will permit me to ask how much you are
Bhort of the amount," said Lorry, con
siderately, yet curiously.
"Our Minister of Finance, Gaspon, will
be able to produce fifteen million gavvos
at the stated timeâ far from enough. This
amount has been sucked from the people
by excessive levy, and has been hoard
ed for the dreaded day. Try as we would,
it has been impossible to raise the full
amount. The people have been bled and
have responded nobly, sacrificing every
thing to meet the treaty terms honorably,
but the strain has been too great. Our
army has cost us large sums. We have
strengthened our delenses, and could,
should we go to war, defeat Axphain. But
we have our treaty to honor; we could
not take up arms to cave ourselves from
that honest bond. Our levies have barely
brought the amount necessary to main
tain an army large enough to inspire re
spect among those who are ready to leap
upon ub the instant we show the least
sign of distress. There are about us pow
ers that have held alcof from war with
us simply because wo h%ve awed them
with our show of force. It has been our
safeguard, and there is not a citizen of
Graustark who objects to the manner in
which our state aflcJrs are conducted.
They know that our army is an economy
at any price. Until last spring we were
confident that we could raise the full
amount due Asphain, but the people in
the rural districts were unable to meet
the levies on account of the panic thAt
came at a most unfortunate time. That
is why we were hurrying home from your
country, Mr. Lorry. Gaspon had cabled
the Princess that affairs were in a hope
less condition, begging her to come home
and do what she could in a final appeal
to the people, knowing the love they had
for her. She came, and has seen these
loyal subjects offer their lives for her and
for Graustark, but utterly unable to give
what they have notâ money. She asked
them If she should disoand the army, and
there was a negative -wail from one end
of the land to the other. Then the army
agreed to serve on half- pay until all was
tided over. Public officers are giving
their services free, and many of our
wealthy people have ndvanced loans on
bonds, worthless as they may seem, and
still we have not the required amount."
"Cannot the loan be extended a few
years?" asked Lorry, nngry with the ruler
in the north, taking the woes of Grau
stark as much to heort as if they were
his own.
"Not one day! Not in London, Paris
nor Berlin."
Lorry lay back and allowed Anguish to
lead the conversation into other channels.
The Count remained for a half-hour, say
ing as he left that toe Princess and his
wife had expressed a desire to be remem
bered to their quests.
"The Princess has spent the evening
with the Ministers of Finance and War,
and her poor head, I doubt not, is rack
ing from the effects of the consultation.
These are weighty matters for a girl to
have on her hands, solemnly stated the
Count, pausing- for an instant at the door
of the apartment.
After he had closed it the Americans
looked long and thoughtfully at each
other, each feeling a respect for the grim
old gentleman that they had never felt
for man before.
"So they are in a devil of a shape,"
mused Anguish. "I tell you, Gren, I never
knew anything- that made me feel so bad
ly as does the trouble that hangs over
that girl and her people. A week ago I
wouldn't have cared a rap for Graustark,
but to-night I feel like weeping for her."
"There seems to be no help for her,
either," said Lorry, reflectively.
"Graustark, you mean?"
"No â I mean yes, of course â who else?"
demanded the other, who certainly had
not meant Graustark.
"I believe, confound your selfish soul,
you'd like to see the nation, the crown
and everything else taken away from this
helpless, harassed child. Then you'd
have a chance," exclaimed Anguish, pac
ing the floor, half angrily, half encourag
ingly.
"Don't say that, Harry, don't say that.
Don't accuse me of it, for I'll confess I
had in my heart that meanest of longings
â the selfish, base, heartless hope that you
have, guessed. It hurts me to be accused
of it though, so don't do it again, old
man. I'll put away the miserable hope, if
I can, and I'll pray God that she may find
a way out of the difficulty."
They went to sleep that night. Anguish
at once, Lorry not for hours, harboring
a determination to learn more about the
condition of affairs touching the people
of Graustark and the heart of their Prin
cess.
XIII.
UNDER MOON AND MONASTERY.
For two days Lorry lived through In
termittent stages of delight and despond
ency. His recovery from the effects of
the blow administered by Dannox wag
naturally rapid, his strong young consti
tution coming to the rescue bravely. He
saw much of the Princess, more of the
Countess Dagmar, and made the acquain
tance of many lords and ladies for whom
he cared but little, except when they
chose to talk of their girlish ruler. The
atmosphere of the castle was laden with
a depression that could not be overcame
by an assimilated gayety. There was the
presence of a shadow that grew darker
and nearer as the days went by, and there
were anxious hearts under the brave,
proud spirits of those who held the des
tiny of Graustark in their hand*.
The Princess could not hide the trouble
that had sprung up in her eyes. Her
laugh, her gay conversation, her rare
composure and gentle hauteur were pow
erless to drive away the haunted, wor
ried gleam in those expressive eyes of
blue. Lorry had it on his tongue's end a
dozen times during the next day or so
after the Count's narrative to question
her about the condition of affairs as they
appeared to her. He wondered whether
she, little more than a girl, could see and
understand the enormity of the situation
that confronted her and her people. A
strange, tender fear prevented him from
speaking to her of the thing which was
oppressing her life. Not that he expected
a rebuff from her, but that he could not
endure the thought of hearing her brave,
calm recital of the merciless story. He
knew that she could narrate It all to him
more plainly than had her uncle. Some
thing told him that she was fully aware
of the real and underlying conditions. He
could see, in his imagination, the proud,
resigned face and manner of this per
plexed Princess as she would have talked
to him of her woes, and he could also
picture the telltale eyes and the troubled
expression that would not be disguised.
The Countess Dagmar, when not mo
nopolized by the very progressive, or ag
gressive Anguish, unfoWed to Lorry cer
tain pages of the personal history of the
Princess, and he, of course, encouraged
her confidential humor, although there
was nothing encouraging in it for him.
Down by the great fountain, while the
soldiers were on parade, the fair but vol
atile Countess unfolded to Lorry a story
that wrenched his heart so savagely that
anger, resentment, helplessness and love
ozed forth and enveloped him in a mul
titude of emotions that would not dis
perse. To have gone to the Princess and
laid down his life to save her would have
given him pleasure, but he had promised
something to her that could not be for
gotten in a day. In his swelling heart hÂ«
prayed for the time to come when he
could take her In his arms, cancel hiÂ«
promise and defy the troubles that op
posed her.
"She will not mind my telling you be
cause she considers you the very best of
men, Mr. Lorry." said the Countess, who
had learned her English under the Prin
cess Yetive's tutor. The demure, sympa
thetic little Countess, her face glowing
with excitement and indignation, could
no* resist the desire to pour into the ears
of this strong and resourceful man the
secrets of the Princess, as if trusting to
him, the child of a powerful race, to pro
vide relief. It was the old story of the
weak appealing to the strong.
It seems, according to the very truthful
account given by the lady, that the Prin
cess had it in her power to save Grau
stark from disgrace and practical destruc
tion. The Prince of Axphain's son. Lo
rena, was deeply enamoured of her, in
fatuated by her marvelous beauty and
accomplishments. He had persuaded his
father to consider a matrimonial alliance
with her to be one of great value to Ax
phain. The old Prince, therefore, aome
months before the arrival of the Ameri
cans in Graustark, sent to the Princess a
substitute ultimatum, couched In terms
so polite and conciliatory that there could
be no mistaking his sincerity. He agreed
to give Graustark a new lease of life. A3
It were, by extending the fifteen years,
or, in other words, to grant the conquered
an additional ten years In which to pay
off the obligations imposed by the treaty.
H-Â» furthermore offered a considerable re
duction in the rate of Interest for the
next ten years. But he had a condition
attached to this good and gracious prop
osition; the marriage of Graustark' s sov
ereign. His ambassador set forth the
advantages of such an alliance, and de
parted with a message that the matter
should have most serious consideration.
The old Prince's proposition was a
blow to. the Princess. who was
placed In a trying .position. By sac
rificing herself she could save her
country, but in so doing he- life was to be
plunged into interminable darkness. She
did not love, nor did she respect Lorenz,
who was not favorably suppled with civ
ilized Intelligence. The proposition was
laid before the Cabinet and the nobility
by the Princess herself, who said that she
would be guided by any decision they
might reach. The counselors, to a man.
refused to sacrifice their girlish ruler, and
the people vociferously ratified the resolu
tion. But the Princess would not allow
them to send an answer to Axphain until
she could see a way clear to save her peo
ple in some other manner. An embassy
was sent to the Prince of Dawsbergen.
His domain touched Graustark on the
south, and he ruled a wild, turbulent class
of mountaineers and herdsmen. This em
bassy sought to secure an Indorsement of
the lean from Prince Gabriel sufficient to
meet the coming crisis. Gabriel, himself
smitten by the charms of the Princess, at
once offered himself in marriage, agreeing
to advance, in case she accepted him.
twenty million gavvos. at a rather high
rate of interest, for fifteen years. His love
for her was so great that he would pawn
the entire principality for an answer that
would make him the happiest man on
earth. Now, the troubled Princess ab
horred Gabriel. Of the two, Lorenz was
much to be preferred. Gabriel flew into a
rage upon the receipt of this rebuff, and
openly avowed his intention to make her
suffer. His infatuation became a mania,
and, up to the very day on which the
Countess told the story, he persisted in
his appeals to the Princess. In person he
had gone to her to plead his suit, on his
knees, groveling at her feet. He went so
far as to exclaim madly in the presence
of the alarmed but relentless object of hi 3
love that he would win her or turn the
whole earth into everything unpleasant.
So It was that the Princess of Graus
tark, erstwhile Miss Guggenslocker, was
being dragged through the most unhappy
affairs that ever beset a sovereign. .With
in a month she was to sign away two
thirds of her domain, transforming mul
titudes of her beloved and loving people
into subjects of the hated Axphain. or sell
herself, body and soul, to a loathsome bid
der in the guise of a suitor. And, with
all this confronting her, she had come to
the realization of a truth so sad and (Re
tracting that It was breaking her tortured
heart. She was in love â but with no royal
Prince. Of this, however, the Countess
knew nothing, so Lorry had one great se
cret to cherish alone.
"Has she chosen the course she will pur
sue?" asked Lorry, as the Countess con
cluded her story. His lace was turned
away.
"She cannot decide. We have wept to
gether over this dreadful, this horrible
thing. You do not know what it means to
all of us, Mr. Lorry. We love her and
there is not one in our land who would
sacrifice her to save this territory. As
for Gabriel, Graustark would kill her be
fore she should go to him. Still she can
not let herself sacrifice those northern
subjects when by a single act she can
save them. You see, the Princess has not
forgotten that her father brought this
war upon the people, and she feels it her
duty to pay the penalty of his error,
whatever the cost."
"Is there no other to whom the can
turnâ no other course?" asked Lorry.
"There is none who would assist us.
bankrupt as we are. There Is a question
I want to ask. Mr. Lorry. Please look at
meâ do not stare at the fountain all the
time. Why have you come to Edelweiss?"
She aaked the question so boldly that his
startled embarrassment was an unspoken
confession. He calmed himself and hes
itated long before answering, weighing
his reply. She sat close beside him. her
clear gray eyes reading him like a book.
"I came to see a Miss Guggenslocker."
he answered at last.
"For what purpose? There must have
been an urgent cause to bring you so far.
You are not an American banker?"
"I had intended to ask her to be my
wife," he said, knowing that secrecy was
useless and seeing a faint hope.
"You did not find Miss Guggenslocker. '
"No. I have not found her."
"And are you going home disappointed,
Mr. Lorry, because she is not here?"
"I leave the answer to your tender im
agination."
There was a lonr pause.
"May I ask when you expect to leave
Graustark?" she asked, somewhat timidly.
'Why do you wish to know?" he asked
in turn.
"Because I know how hopeless your
quest has been. You have found Miss
Guggenslocker, but she is helc' behind a
wall so strong- and impregnable that you
cannot reach her with the question you
came to ask. You have come to that wall
and now you must turn back. I have
asked, how soon? "
"Not until your Princess bids me take
up my load and go. You see. my lady,
I love to sit beneath the shadow of the
wall you describe. It will require a royal
edict to compel me to abandon my posi
tion."
"You cannot expect the Princess to
drive you from her countryâ you have
done so much for her. You must go, Mr.
Lorry, without her bidding."
"I must?"
"Yes, for your presence outside that
wall may make the imprisonment all
the more unendurable for the one your
love cannot reach. Do you understand
me?"

W., "WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.â President
Roosevelt's recommendation in his forth
coming annual message that the navy be
largely increased will be accompanied by
important and strong references to the
Monroe doctrine.
In .the draft of the message which has
been read to the Cabinet, the President
lias not given any definition of the Mon
roe doctrine, as desired by Great Britain.
He has simply shown the necessity of
having a. force that will enable the pro
tection of outlying dependencies and com
pel European respect for the Monroe doc
trine.
"While Europe In general and Great
Britain in particular are anxious that the
United States should in black and white
define the Monroe doctrine, the adminis
tration is disposed to utter no other defi
nition tnan that which was promulgated
by President Monroe.
Of Advantage to England.
'An official of the administration who
* discussed the report published this morn
ing in relation to the desire of Great
Britain that the United States should give
a definition of the doctrine with a view
cf her acceptance of its principles said
each action would naturally bÂ« far more
advantageous to the London than to the
"Washington government. Officially, Ger
many is the only friend Great Britain
"has on the European continent, and the
feeling of the people of Germany agairjst
their English cousins is so bitter that
even Emperor William may find it nec
essary to go -with the stream. If Great
Britain could be assured that the United
States -would protect her colonies in the
American hemisphere she would be able
to concentrate her forces for the protec
tion of her home territory and her colo
nies elsewhere. It is not believed, that
xrar will occur between Great Britain and
Germany over any present questions/ but
the official who discussed the matter to
day said that the attitude of this Gov
ernment -would be most important in such
a struggle. Canada is one of Great Brit
ain's most desirable colonies, and If Ger
many had an opportunity she would at
tack it. The question immediately arises,
â¢-Can the United States permit German
r Conquest of Canada?"
Would Resist Acquisition.
Jefferson, whose advice was requested
upon the suggestion that the United
States should take decided grounds against
the Holy Alliance in South America, re
sponded that "with Great Britain with
drawn from their scale and shifted into
"that of our two countries, all Europe
combined would not undertake war, for
now could they propose to get at either

honestly join in the declaration that we

ble interposition of any other power as
auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any other
form or pretext, and, most especially,
- their transfer of European colonies to any
power by conquest, cession or acquisition
in any other .way."
The official with whom I talked con
. ceming the English suggestion for a def
inition of the Monroe doctrine said it
would be Impolitic at this moment to of
ficially define the attitude of the United
States with respect to Canada, as its ef
fect might be to place this country in
Ejcttxal alliance with Great Britain, espe
cially if the latter government were then
to formally announce adherence to its
principles. He said emphatically, how

Germany or any other nation to occupy
the Danish West Indies would be resisted,
and left it to be Inferred that a similar
attitude would have to be observed in the
case of Canada.

are on foot for the coronation of King
Edward. The Duke of Norfolk, heredi
tary Earl Marshal and Premier Duke and
Earl, this morning summoned well-known
London costume makers to Norfolk
House, where, spread out on wicker
frames, were specimens of the robes to
be worn by the peers and peeresses at
the next year's great function.
This inspection, which was superintend
ed by the Duke, was to enable the cos
turners to get the exact tint of the crim
son velvet, the position of the Mlnerver
and ermine and other details for the all
important making of the robes, on which
work will now be started in earnest.
The British Museum has been besieged
by those who are searching the records
for notes of the dresses and regulations
of previous coronations.
Queen Alexandra has ordered from
Delhi a quantity of the finest embroidery,
for which the former capital of India is
so famous, which will adorn her Majesty's
robes at the coronation ceremonies. This
action, which has produced the greatest
satisfaction in India, is due to the good
offices of the "Vicereine, who, when in
England recently, showed the Queen some
priceless Delhi embroidery and so stimu
lated royal interest as to cause the pres
ent order to be given.
Many of the Federal Troops Captured by
Liberals Join the Insurgent Army.
added that a commission will be sent to
Bocas del Toro to advise the surrender
of that place to the Liberals.
The situation here is still quiet. The
merchants of Colon are pleased at acts
of the new government. ATI of the export
duties have been removed and the import
duties have been reduced one-half. Traffic
over the railroad is uninterrupted.
Prevent Running of Specials.
The steamer Canada, Belonging to the
Compagnie Generale Transatlantlque
from Havre, is the first steamer that has
entered the port under the new regime.
She will sail for Savanilla to-day. There
is much conjecture as to how her papers
will be received on her arrival there.
The Liberals along the line of the rail

The Ottoman Bank utterly refuses to
make any more advances, and the penury
is so acute that even the troops in many

the real danger of the situation.

Special Dispatch to The CaXL
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
Â¦W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Details of
the grand scheme under which, tha United
States will build the Nicaragua canal are
rapidly becoming known since the Isth
mian Canal Commission has completed
its report and Senators and others have
been taken into the confidence of mem
bers of the million dollar board.
The Call is able to-day to present facts
and figures of the engineering features.
Unless a legislative miracle happens Con
gress will this winter vote to construct
the canal at a cost of $189,000,000. This
will Id dude two great harborsâ one at
Greytown, on the Atlantic or Carribean
end of the canal, and the other at Brito,
at the Pacific endâ for a canal of eight
locks and one enormous dam at Con
chuda, on the San Juan River, several
miles above the' mouth, of the Carlos
River.
Wide Entrance Provided.
Greytown harbor and the entrance to
the canal will cost |2,196,560, and the Brno
harbor and entrance Â£,509,470. As tho
canal is to have a depth of thirty-five
feet, it is necessary that the harbor and
entrance should have the same. It is
proposed to have the harbors at either
end of the canal protected by jetties 3300
feet long. These jetties will be construct
ed of loose stone and will be six feet
above water. The entrance will be 500
feet wide and of thirty-five feet depth.
Much more dredging will be necessary
at Greytown than at Brito. The sand
movement at Brito will be less than at
Greytown and the ' cost of maintenance
will 1-3 Jar less. Within the harbors
therr v l *; be a turning basin of 1800 feet.
A'r;>J ToadT oad must be built for about 100
m' -. This railroad will cost, It 13 esti
mated, $73,000 a mile, and its total cost
will be 17,575,000. This is understood to be
exclusive of equipment. A branch of
this road will also have to be run from
the main line to the proposed great Con
chuda dam.
Dam to Regulate Flow.
Â¦ This dam is to regulate the flow of the
San Juan River in wet and dry seasons,
and this is to be done /by means of great
gates and sluices. A force will have to
be ' constantly on watch for floods and be
ready at a minute's notice to put the ma
chinery in operation which will let the
surplus water out or keep the needed
water impounded. This dam, including
sluices and machinery, is to cost not to
exceed $4,017,660. There Is also to be an
auxiliary wasteway. including sluices and
approach channels to the dam, which will
cost $2,045,322.
Lock No. 1, including excavation, will
cost $5,719,686. Then -follows a stretch of
about twenty-eight miles, costing about
$1,000,000 per mile.
Leaving the river at this point of de
parture from the lake, the course will
next be across Lake Nicaragua for fifty
and a half miles. Nine miles beyond the
lake the plans of the commission 'bring
the canal to lock No. 5. . Hare very ex
tensive work has to bj done. The exca
vation becomes very heavy as the divida
beyond the lake Is c! mbed, and it had
been found necessary to .construct enor
mous receiving basins to intercept the
: Rio Grande, Las Lajas and Chocolate
! rivers. The total cost of the expenditure
! at this point will be more^than $24,500,000.
The Drop to the Pacific.
The canal is now very near the Pacific
'. side and the drop now begins. To lock
No. 6 is only a distance of about a mil -.
I The excavation and lc-k will cost about
$7,500,000. To lock No. 7 the distance <s
less than two miles, and the work will
I swell the cost $7,000,000 more. The next
rapid step 'down the Pacific slope is to
lock No. 8 and the last two miles and a
half, which will cost the Governmenr
| nearly $6,000,000. This icck will bring ship
'â¢ ping within a mile and a quarter of Brito
'Â¦ and into salt water, practically to the Â«nd
| of the canal.
[ The length of the canal will be 183.66
\ miles. ' There are several deep cuts on the
canal. Near the ConcLuda dam the depth
will be at one point more than 200 feet.
' The cut at Tamborcito. twenty-six miles
from Greytown, is to bo the deepest of
' all. The canal will have a system of
, double locks, so that in case one is disa
j bled or closed for rep* rs or renewal the
other can take care of the traffic and
, commerce will not be interrupted.

Wrath at Chamberlain's
Speech Increases
in Berlin.
Editors in the Kaiser's Realm
Discuss the Speech of
Hay.
BERLIN, Nov. 23.â Germany continues
to ring with protests against the refer
ences which Chamberlain, the British
Colonial Secretary,' made to the German
army In his speech at Edinburgh. Meet
ings, are held every day and there is no
sign of abatement of the agitation. The
Pastors' Society of Gladbach is circulating
a protest, which has already received
the signatures of 680 pastors. The Wur
terr.buig Veterans' Society has issued a
warning: against attaching too great im
portance to one man's utterances. |
The letter from Chamberlain's secretary
ie pronounced here to be unsatisfactory,
for. as the papers . note. ' Chamberlain
takes nothing back.' The press generally
regards the letter as another insult and
rejects the assumption that the anti-
British movement Is artificial. On this
latter point the Cologne Yolks Zeitung as
serts that the movement is as spontaneous
as it is possible to imagine, adding that
the government has tried by, every means
to suppress it. but has failed in the effort.
Other papers describe the movement as
being the most remarkable of Its kind
ever witnessed.
The Liberal organs, like the Tageblatt
and the Vossiche Zeitung, try 1 to prove
that the movement is directed exclusively
against Chamberlain, and not against
Great Britain; but the Frankfurter Zei
tung admits that German patriotic feel
ing has been inflamed in an unmistakable
manner against Great Britain. The paper
asserts that it was unstatesmanlike on
the part of Chamberlain to give fresh
fuel ti| this feeling, and says Chamberlain
was not wise In reasserting his error.
Germany's Policy Criticized.
Nevertheless, the Frankfurter ' Zeitung
admits that part of the cause
of this friction is to be found
on German soil. It says the move
ment here expresses the German want of
care In the management of Germany's
foreign policy, which is looked upon as
being lacking in steadiness and power,
and as acting by fits and starts. The
paper last quoted says that if the govern
ment had rightly gauged the movement
at the start it could have forestalled it
by a timely utterance. Nevertheless, the
paper concludes that too much noise has
been made In Germany over the Cham
bci'ain matter. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ .'â¢". Â¦ Â¦
Secretary Hay's speech at the banquet
of the New York Chiraber of Commerce
Tuesday last has raised a lively discus
sion of German-American: relations. Th*
Kreu* Zeitung sees (.herein proof that
Washington does not intend to be liber li

the European States, and that it Is 1101.
willing to concede the -.ame duties as'oto

adds that since Secretary Hay holds fast
to the Dlngley tariff other countries can
only answer with the.mpositionof simi
lar duties. : \ : .
The assurances given by Dr. yon Hol

the attitude of Emperor William and the
German people toward the United States
have been warmly received here. All the
papers express the hope that there will
be an improvement la the relations he â¢
tween Germany and Â¦ the United States
through this clearing of the atmosphere.
Conduct of Pan-Germans.
The Berliner Zeitung rails Dr. yon Hoi-!
leben's assurances a -litavowal of the
Pan-Germans. The paper admits that the
Germans advocated foreign conquests in
a manner which necessnrily caused v.exÂ£.-.
tion abroad. It chows from the Pan-Ger
man Association printed matter that the.
Pan-Germans w&nt-to annex Chile, A. â¢
gentina. South Brazil, the West Indian
Islands, The Netherlands, Turkey, etc..
and goes on to show that the German ,
Fleet Society, which enjoys high Govern

"Upon whether we succeed., in winning

Th" reassembling- of the Reichstag on
Tuewlav attracts little attention. Tie
tariff debate is not expected to begin im
mediately, the bucket having precedence,
but a general tariff discussion during the
budget debate is regarded as certain to
recur. The Government's preamble to
the new tariff bill was sent to the mem
bers of the Reichstag to-day, but the re
port governing the reason for the changes
is not ready. It. forms a bulky volume.
The tariff agitation has assumed greater
activity since the Bundesrath passed the

GREEK PREMIER
GIVES REASONS
Deputies Are Told Why-
There Have Been
Great Riots.
Government's Action Is Ap
proved After an Exciting
Debate.
ATHENS, Nov. 23.â Theoktis, the Greek
Premier, taking part to-day in an ex
cited debate in the Chamber of Deputies
over the recent disturbances here arising
from the objection of the students to the
translation of the gospels into modern
Greek, quoted from certain letters of the
Holy Synod, addressed to Queen Olga In
1899, in which the Synod's reasons against
the translation of the gospels were ex
plained.
The Premier blamed the Metropolitan
of Athens, Procopius Oeconimtdis, tor the
disturbances. He said the Metropolitan,
owing to the weakness of his character,
had not the courage to support the Synod
upon the occasion of the Metropolitan's
audience with the Queen.
Referring to Queen Olga the Premisr
said her piety, Christian sentiments and
nobility of character were the admiration
of the whole world. During the war she
was everywhere told by wounded soldiers
that they could not read the gospels be
cause they did not understand the text.
The Quetn then arranged, continued the
Premier, for the publication of a transla
tion of the gospels into modern Greek, ex
clusively for family use.
The recent disorders had been caused,
Theoktis explained, by the demonstrators
assailing the troops with stones and re
volvers. The troops only fired in the air.
That was proved by the wounds of the
victims being from revolver and not from
rifle bullets. When speaking of the dead
tears ran down the Premier's cheeks and
the sitting of the Chamber wa3 suspended
for some minutes in order to allow him
to regain his composure.
The opposition was led by Delyannis,
who accused the Ministry of weakness
and of being responsible for murder.
Vast and noisy crowds surrounded the
Chamber of Deputies while the debate was
going on. The troops, however, were dis
posed in force and overawed the assem
blage. The Chamber finally adopted a
resolution approving the Government's
action by a vote of 107 to X 7. The Depu
ties at the close of the sitting were safely
escorted from the building to their hbmes.
The city if. resuming its normal aspaet.

MARCONI WILL
TRY THE NORTH
â Â«
Celebrate! Inventor to
Experiment in New
foundland.
Special B'.siHiteh to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. w.â Marconi will sail
Monday for St. Johns. Newfoundland, to
carry out some interesting scientific ex
periments. As it would be tedious and
expensive work to erect a huge mast at
each spot selected for an experimental
station Marconi takes with him two bal
loons of 2u,<a)o cubic feet capacity. These
balloons will be used to suspend aerial
wire from the shore station. Ordinarily
the balloons will be kept about 150 feet
in the air, but may be used up to 300 feet.
The ki station will be on a steamer
equipped with a pole 120 feet high. The
efiect of rocky shores, inclosed bays and
fogs will be studied. Electrical disturb
ances at present form one of the most ag
gravating obstacles to distinct and unin
terrupted communication.
"It is quite possible that the result of
our trip may be nil," said Marconi. "It
has been claimed that there are certain
atmospheric conditions more favorable to
wireless telegraphy than others."
"Do you expect to reach a greater dis
tance by making experiments from a bal
loon?" asked The Call correspondent.
"No. I think the orescnt maximum of
say 2ft) miles, is as far as communication
is likely, at least for some time to come.
The cirvature of the earth has nothing
to do with limiting the radius of wireless
communication. So far as we have been
able to learn as yet it is simply the ques
tion of perfection, or rather the imperfec
tion of our apparatus.
"What further may develop it would be
fnnlish for me to venture to predict, but
for the present at least I do not think
there is any immediate probability of our
signaling across the ocean, for instance.
We certainly do not expect to make any
experiments with that object."
"Will the station at Newfoundland give
you any better cc-munieation with ocean
steamers?" was asxed.
"Possibly with Canadian steamers." said
Marconi. "Our Cape Race station is
eighty miles from the west-bound course
or HO miles from the past-bound course
of the northern route. This route is only
used for five months in the year, from
August to January, by trans-Atlantic
steamers, which for the remaining seven
months take a southern route over 200
miles farther iw."

Disappearance of Twenty Thousand
Dollars' Worth of Gold and

EL PASO. Tex.. Nov. 23.â The fact that
12 bars of gold and silver bullion, valued
at over $20,000. were stolen six months ago
in transit from the smelters here to East
ern refineries has just come to light.
The shipment was made over the Gal
veston. Harrisburg and San Antonio Rail
road under heavy bond. It was not miss
ed until the car reached New Or'eans. It
has been since learned that the bullion
had been thrown from the car near this

tempted to kill his wife and then com
mitted suicide.
Halllday had recently been complaining
of sleeplessness. He and his wife boarded
the Cymric at Liverpool, after passing a
couple months visiting friends in
County Down. Ireland. Halliday prayed
all night long and showed evidence ihis
morning that his mind was affected.
After breakfast he announced that all
the people on board the ship ware to be
killed, and drawing a knife from hla
pocket he commenced hacking his wife
and slashing at his own throat. Mrs.
Halliday struggled desperately to escape
the fury of her husband, receiving ter
rible gashes on the hand and body, and
was finally compelled to desist.
Halliday then continued to hack his
own throat until he had severed all the
veins and muscles and dropped dead out
side of his stateroom. The body was
then taken ashore and Mrs. Halliday also
disembarked. The Cymric proceeded on
her way at 11 o'clock.

know that Peruna saved my life and
I cannot speak too highly In ltd praise.
Three years ago 1 caught a heavy cold
which settled in catarrh of the head and
bronchial tubes. I thought it only an or-
dinary cold at first and paid little atten-
tion to it until the catarrh developed-Â»ji^
coughed badly and was unable to secure
a good night's rest. Finally my father
read of a cure called Peruna and sent for
a bottle. I found that" it relieved me won-
derfully, and so kept taking it for nearly
three months, when I' was well once more.
Peruna has a great number of friends in
I this neighborhood. It has a good reputa-
tion as a catarrh remedy which it well
deserves."â Myrtice James.

ENGLISH WEARY
OF CHAMBERLAIN.
Colonial Secretary Los
ing Much of His
Reputation.
LONDON, Nov. 23.â Once more has Jo
seph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary,
proved his right and title to be the most
thoroughly hated British statesman.
The storm now raging in Germany over
his animadversions on the Prussian army
has had a powerful reflex in Great Brit
ain, where, regardless of party ties,
Chamberlain has been severely criticised
for uselessly "putting his foot in it." On
all sides can be heard irritated expres
sions of opinion by English business men
and politicians, who, while thÂ«y perhaps
believe Chamberlain was correct In what
he said, denounce the uttering of such
sentiments.
It is recalled that Chamberlain's utter
ances regarding the Czar and the Anglo-
German alliance have been the causes of
the only serious outbreaks of anti-British
feeling on the Continent in recent times.
It was no exaggeration to say that the
financial world of England would bt=> drjA
lighted to see Chamberlain muzzled whelr
intending to speak on England's foreign
relations.
As might be expected Chamberlain him
self takes the whole affair with his usual
cynical indifference. He is ;\ivink quietly
at Birmingham and is not exhibiting any
particular interest in this storm which he
has raised. At the Colonial office a cor
respondent was informed that Chamber- 1
latn does not desire to enter into any con
troversy and .stands by what he said. If
the German papers continue to misrepre
sent him (this is Chamberlain's point of
view>, why it cannot be helped. With the
othÂ«Â»r Government departments the belief
exists at the Colonial office that the whole
agitation will die a natural death. Ther^
is no doubt, however, that by this latest
break Chamberlain has seriously, if not
irreparably, damaged his reputation with
"re hptrt-r classes in England. fe7 ADVERTISEMENTS.

JAMES P. TBEADWELL
SUES HIS GUARDIAN
Alleges That George Y. Bollinger Is
Withholding- Money That Is
Due Him.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 23.â James P. Tread
well, the young capitalist, who, about a
year ago, came Into an estate of $400,000,
to-day brought suit against his former
guardian, George Y. Bollinger, to recover
$167 25, alleged to be due on a note exe
cuted in August, 1900. Treadwell also de
clares in the complaint that Bollinger has
in his possession $17 50 which he received
for Treadwell.
Bollinger is a man of means and one of
the best known citizens of this county.
He has served a term as Sheriff. He says
that, as guardian, he has satisfied every
whim of the young capitalist, who was
continually getting in scrapes, and that
the suit comes as a great surprise.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1901.
FALLS IN LOVE WITH A PHOTOGRAPH
AND WILL SOON WED ITS ORIGINAL
Captain CorkhiU of the British Bark Sierra Blanca Will Carry Wealthy
Mrs. Rawson of Los Angeles Across the Seas as His Bride.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23.â When Captain J. E. Corkhlll of the British bark Sierra Blanca made a flying visit to
Los Angeles last week he had little thought of the momentous consequences attending his brief visit. But the "old
sea dogs" are impulsive creatures when ashore, and when the Sierra Blanca next sails from the Pacific Coast for
foreign lands she will carry as the bride of Captain Corkhill Mrs. Delia B. Rawson, one of the handsomest and
wealthiest women of Los Angeles. And thereby hangs a delightful little. romance.
Captain Corkhill has followed the sea, boy and man. for thirty years, the past twelve years having been spent as
master of various English merchantmen. Three years ago he was in command of the four-masted bark Crown of In
dia, and when he sailed from San Francisco early in 1898, for Sydney, Australia, thence to Liverpool, he had on board as
an apprentice young Don Rawson. a son of Mrs. Rawson, the lad undertaking a deep-water voyage in the hope of re
gaining his health.
Captain Corkhill became greatly at ta cnedÂ» to the American boy, who had evinced a strong fascination for a seafar
ing life. The boy was apt and anxious tÂ° master every detail aboard ship, and the captain was always ready to aid him.
Young Rawson had several photographs of his mother with him, which Captain Corkhill admired very much.
Don Rawson completed the voyag e around the world with Captain Corkhill, returning to San Francisco in the
summer of 1599. The skipper was anxious to have the boy sail with him again, but the youngster, loyal to his nation's
flag, wanted to go to sea on an Ameri can shi P- and tne two P arted company, Captain Corkhiil to start on another voy
age around the world and Rawson to s hi P on the American ship John Ena, for South Africa. Captain Corkhill and
the boy's mother had never met, but possibly it was the remembrance of the pictured face of Mrs. Rawson, as much
as it was his friendly interest in the 1&& himself, that prompted the gallant salt to cast aside his brass-buttoned uni
form at the earliest opportunity after reaching San Diego on his new ship ten days ago, don his best "shore
clothes," and hasten to Los Angeles t<> visit Don Rawson-as he said. The boy had sailed only a few weeks before
for New York, but Mrs. Rawson was a* home, and cordially greeted the man who had done so much for her son.
The captain was impressed-so much so that his return to San Diego and his ship was delayed a day or two, and
âwell, to-night Captain Corkhill was called up by telephone and admitted that he would embark upon the sea of
matrimony before he left these shores.
The Sierra Blanca Is now loading ballast at San Diego for either Portland or Tacoma, where she will take car
go for Australia or England, and it is Captain Corkhill's intention to be married before he begins his long voyage
He is 43 years old, and comes of a wealthy English family.
Mrs. Rawson is a strikingly handsome woman, and for a number or years has been prominently identified with
the business interests of this city.
VERDICT ACQUITS
MRS. HOUSEWORTH
Woman Accused of
Forging Fuller Will
Goes Free.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OROVILLE, Nov. 23.â Mrs. Minnie
Houseworth was found not guilty of the
crime of forgery by a jury this morning.
The verdict is a blow at the evidence of
handwriting experts, who know nothing of
the facts except what their microscopes
and knowledge of chirography tell them.
One of the principal witnesses for the
prosecution was Expert Theodore Kytka,
who spent several days before the jury,
tracing the sinuosities of the handwriting
of Mrs. Houseworth. He declared em
phatically that Mrs. Houseworth wrote
the entire body of the will to which Al
fred Fuller's name was forged, leaving her
nearly his entire estate.
Mrs. Rodley, wife of Dr. Rodley, under
sentence of twelve years for perjury In
connection with the will, swore that Kyt
ka had offered through her to testify in
Mrs. Houseworth' s favor if paid a suffi
cient sum.
The verdict is taken as Indicating so
strongly how a jury of farmers disregards
the testimony of handwriting experts that
it was believed to-day that no effort would
now be made to convict Mrs. Houseworth
on another possible charge, where the
prosecution would have to rely largely
upon experts. It Is believed that the case
of Dr. A. J. Landis, indicted for forging a
note against Fuller's estate, will never
come to trial for the same reason.
The Houseworth case was given to tnc
jury yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. Th's
morning at 9 o'clock when the courthouse
bell rang hundreds of persons hurried to
hear the verdict, which was:
"We, the jury, find tr.e defendant, Mrs.
S. M. Houseworth, not ;ruUty."
The defendant was accompanied by her
son, J. P. West, and Attorney Duncan.
When the verdict was read she sat erect,
apparently with little anxiety. Then shs
sank back in nor chair and wept.
[ The result of the Houseworth case
promises to speedily terminate all the
criminal cases arising out of the Fuller
1 estate. Landis was to have come to trial
next. With him disposed of the case cf
! John Garner, who signed the will with
j Rodley as a witness, would come up
! Garner, who has been In jail two year.-!,
has pleaded guilty and testified against
Rodley and Mrs. Housoworth. He will be
sentenced and then gubernatorial clem
ency will be invoked in his behalf.
| The United States Supreme Court has
; just cut off Rodley's last recourse. The
officers propose to star! with him for San
] Quentin some night and try to land him
Â¦ in prison before his attorney can once
more stop them in San Francisco with a
court order.
Theodore Kytka, when seen In regard
to the testimony of Mrs. Rodley in the
trial of Mrs. Minnie Houseworth in Oro
ville, displayed great indignation, and
branded the woman's statements as ut
terly false.
"In 1898," said the writing expert. "I
sent a report to the Grand Jury at Oro
ville declaring- that the will was a for
gery and that it was written by Mrs.
Houseworth. In 1899 I testified in full
that the will was a forgery. It was not
until 1900 that I met Mrs. Rodley. Through
her solicitations to George Collins he in
troduced her to me. It makes me boil
â¢with anger when I think of it â that any
body should be so ridiculous to think
that I would sell myself and reputation
for $125â1 who get thousands of riollars
for fees."
ALASKAN STEAMSHIP
FABALLON DISABLED
Loses Two Slades of Her Propeller
and Puts Into Skeena
Biver.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 23.â The
steamship City of Seattle, which arrived
here this morning from Skagway, brought
news of a serious accident to the Alaskan
liner FaraHon, Captain Ord. The Farallon
was found lying in shelter under the leu
of Kennedy Island, at the mouth of the
Skeena River, and will remain there until
some steamship comes along to tow her
to Seattle. The City of Seattle took the
Farallon's mails and several passengers
aboard and the rest of the passengers
will come on the Dolphin.
The Farallon v/as passing through drift
wood just south of Wrangel Narrows on
Wednesday when her propeller struck a
log and two blades were stripped off be
fere the machinery could be stopped.
Then the engines raced and the steam
ship had to be stopped altogether. Later
in the afternoon the engines were started
again at half-speed, but with only a quar
ter of a propeller they could not bÂ« con
trolled, and the jarring of the ship caused
her to spring a leak. The longer the ma
chinery was kept running the more the
water came into the hold, and to prevent
the boat sinking, steam has to be shut
off entirely.
In the meantime sails were- rigged up
and the vessel wae held on her course to
the south, Bhe Bailed all that nlrht ana
next morning, and by noon had anchored
off KÂ«=nne<3y Island.

STORM RAGING
UP THE COAST
Rivers in Western Wash
ington Are Out of
Their Banks.
Special Dispatch to The Car.
TACOMA, Nov. 23.â The heaviest rain
storm known here since November, 1898,
has been sweeping over Western Wash
ington since last Tuesday. Rivers have
been rising rapidly for the last two days
and last night Puyallup, White, Kalama
and Chehalis Rivers began overflowing
their banks. Railroad traffic has been in
terrupted since yesterday morning. Trains
due in Tacoma yesterday afternoon were
blockaded at Eagle Gorge, in the Cascade
Mountains, where serious washouts on the
Northern Pacific were caused by an un
usual freshet in Green River. Three de
layed trains, carrying mail, arrived this
afternoon and evening. Another large
washout is reported on the Palmer cut-off,
which is used by fast passenger trains.
Trains leaving Tacoma last evening were
held at Puyallup until the bridges could
be strengthened, because of the large
quantities of driftwood and trees that had
lodged against them. Similar slides and
washouts have occurred on the Great
Northern west of Cascade tunnel. The
movement of wheat to Tacoma ware
houses from Eastern Washington will be
interrupted for several days.
Near Kalama yesterday a long stretch
of county road was swept into Kalama
River by a landslide. Four landslides
have occurred on the newly built Wash
ington and Oregon Railroad, and one train
is now blocked between two slides five
miles south of Kalama.
A boom at the mouth of the Kalama
River with more than 1/(00,000 feet of logs
in it is likely to float away before morn
ing, as one end has already given away.
Men have been working all day trying to
get the logs into the slough for safely,
and succeeded in securing about 250,000
feet, but there are at least 750,000 feet
more in danger. Heavy rains have caused
high water in the Chehalis River, and
yesterday afternoon a log boom of Chand
ler Brothers at Dryad went out. To-day
1400 cords of shingle bolts are floating
down the Chehalis to Grays Harbor.
Other booms are threatened. The rains
have continued to-day and the rivers are

INDIANS POISON
SUPPOSED WITCH
Unique Murder Trial
Ends in a Double
Conviction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, O r!*ov. 23.-A unique
murder trial was finished to-night when
Columbia George and Toy Toy, two Uma
tilla Indians, were found guilty of murder
in the first degree for the poisoning of an
Indian woman, Anna Edna, on the Un-a
tilla reservation, near . Pendleton. : The
motive for the deed was. the Indians' be
lief that Anna Edna was a witch and had
been practicing her diabolical art to the
fÂ«m!i? A of the two Indians and their
famil es. According to the old tribal be
km 1 Lf W Z s the proper tning to do to
fn Lri he3 ' wherever and whenever
found. Anna Edna was a harmless old
woman, whose practice of mixing herb
concoctions, coupled with her old age
and ugliness, led to her death. The crime
was committed on August 24
In the trial the defense followed novel
thrm?^ 11 ? i ntroducl n& Indian testimony
through interpreters as to the Indian be
liefs in witchcraft and the right to kill
witches practicing' their art. This un
doubtedly led to the verdict of the jury fo r
life Imprisonment, rather than capital
punishment, as the evidence was clearly
against the two. â¢ " Â¦
.Columbia George admitted having given
the squaw poison, but blamed Toy Toy for
the suggestion. George said he believed
he had a right to kill the woman, as she
was a witch, but he acknowledged to Dis
trict Attorney Hall that he knew it was
against the law to kill anybody '
"Anna . Edna never did me any harm "
he said, and I had no reason to kill her."

ENTHIiIA^I?NVERfsr
There Are Thousands of Them
Who Believe as This
Woman Does.
Mrs. Ira Knowlton of Butte, Montana, is a
most enthusiastic convert to the virtues of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets as a cure for ob-
stinate stomach trouble. She 6ays: "I had
poor digestion nearly all my life. It now
seems to me that for years I never knew what I
it was to be hungry, to have a good natural
app3tltÂ».
"I was troubled with gas in stomach causing
pressure on the heart with palpitation and
short breath. Nearly everything I ate soured
on my stomach, sometimes I had cramps ia
the stomach which almost resembled spasms.
"Doctors told me I had catarrh of the stom-
ach, but their medicines would not reach it
and I would still be a sufferer had I not, in
sheer desperation, decided to try Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets.
"I knew they were an advertised remedy and
I didn't believe anything I read about them
as I had no confidence in advertised remedies,
but my sister living in Pittsburg wrote me last
spring telling me how Stuart's Tablets had
cured her little daughters of indigestion and
loss of flesh and appetite and I hesitated no
longer.
"I bought a fifty-cent box at my drug store
and took two of the large tablets after each
meal and found them delightful to take, being
as pleasant to the taste as caramel candy.
Whenever during the day or night I felt any
pain or uneasiness in the stomach or about
the heart I took one of the small tablets and
in three weeks it seemed to me as it I had
never known what stomach trouble was.
"I keep Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in thÂ«
house and every member of our family uses
them occasionally after a hearty meal or when
any of us have a pain or ache in the digestive
organs."
Mr. E. H. Davis of Hampton. Va.,. says: "I
doctored five years for dyspepsia, but in two
months I got more benefit from Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets than in five years of the doctor' a
treatment."
Stuart' a Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest as
well as the simplest and most convenient rem-
edy for any form of indigestion, catarrh of
stomach, biliousness, sour stomach, bloating
aiter meals, sympathetic heart trouble.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is not a cheap
cathartic, but an active digestive remedy con-
taining the pepsin and diastase which every
weak stomach lacks, and they cure stomach
troubles because they digest the food eaten and
rive the weak, abused, overworked stomach a
chance to rest and recuperate.
Stuart's Dyspepsia, Tablets are steld in every
drug store In the United States, Canada and
1 Great Britain.

.Kilmer s Swamp-Root, because as soon as your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one. . ;
Many women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not cor- -'
rectly understood; in most cases they are led to believe that womb trouble or female
weakness of some sort is responsible for their many ills, when in fact disordered
kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
!Â¦ Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache in the back, weakness or bearing down sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine, with strong odor, frequent desire to pass it
night or day, with scalding or burning sensationâ are all unmistakable signs
of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there is any doubt in your mind as to your condition, take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place it in a glass or bottle and let it stand twenty-four
hours. If on examination it is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust settling, or
if small particles float about in it, your kidneys are in need of immediate attention,
Other symptoms showing that you need Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizzi-
ness, irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow, unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambi-
tion, but no strength. . r ,Z. : . .-
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and is used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians in their private practice, and Is taken by doctors them-
selves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound.

PORTLAND MAN MISSING
AS WEDDING DAY NEARS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 23.â The disap
pearance of Alexander K. Bell in San
Francisco on the eve of his wedding to
Miss Edna Cannon, a society young
woman of Portland, has given rise to
grave fears as to the safety of the miss
ing man. Bell is a well known loan and
insurance man, and his wedding day was
set for next Wednesday. Every detail
of the ceremony was complete, from the
creation of the wedding gown to tb.e
choice of ushers and bridesmaids. The
disappearance cf Bell has been a great
shock to his fiancee and to all the mem
bers of both families. There is no suspi
cion that Bell is trying to avoid his wed
ding engagement.
The fact was made known to-day that
Bell recently intrusted $5000 in cash to a
friend, to be placed in a safety vault.
This money was to be used for the
honeymoon trip to Europe. It has also
developed that this friend, whose name
is known only to Bell, recently left sud
denly for San Francisco. Suspicion aris
ing in Bell's mind that his friend was
playing him false, he left two weeks ago
for California. Up to ten days ago let
QUICK ANSWER
OR A STRIKE
Switchmen at Pittsburg
Suddenly Demand
More Pay.
PITTSBURG, Pa.. Nov. 23.â About one
third of the switchmen employed in the
various freight yards here have present
ed a sudden and unexpected demand for
an advance in wages and other changes
in their work. The notice was served
upon the officials of the several railroad
companies in the city this morning at 10
o'clock and a request was made for an
answer before 10 o'clock Monday morn
ing.
The wording of the demand is such as
to lead the officials of the roads to be
lieve that a strike will follow the refusal
of the demand.
Presented so unexpectedly and with so
little time to consider the matter, and
with the utter impossiblitiy cf submitting
the demand to the proper officials in New
York, Baltimore and Philadelphia, it is
said it will be an utter impossibility for
the local officials to make any definite
answer to the men.
Should the men strike it would be far
reUching in its results, and cripple the
roads in the most congested sections,
coming as it would at a time when it
has been by superhuman efforts that the
roads have been kept open at all.
The present difficulty is largely due to
a disagreement between the Federation
of Railroad Employes, representing all
branches of the railway service, and
what has been termed a radical element
that once was connected with the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen.
Should the strike be ordered it would
affect the Pennsylvania Railroad, the
Pittsburg and Lake Erie, the Baltimore
and Ohio, the Buffalo, Rochester and
Pittsburg, the Bessemer and Lake Erie
and the Allegheny Valley Railroad. So
far as known the switchmen in the yards
of the Fort Wayne and Panhandle reads
are not allied with the new union.
Charges Against Heistand.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â The sub-com
mittee of the Senate Committee on Mili
tary Affairs to-day resumed its hearing
of the charges against Lieutenant Colonel
H. O. Heistand. No witnesses appeared,
however, and the committee adjourned
until Monday.
ters were received from hfm. He was in
a weakened condition, from a recent ill
ness, and It is believed that this busi
ness worry has caused him to breaJc
down. In his last letter he 3Â«4d he would
immediately place himself to a physi
cian's care. Â»

WYOMING LAND
FOR THE BOERS
Gigantic Plans in Pro
gress for Vast Colo
nization.
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 23â almost
world-wide movement for the colonization
of the broad expanses of Western terri
tory as yet undotted by homes of settlers.
Is becoming: more and more definite every
day. Several movements are now on foot
which will bring hundreds of thousands of
homeseekers Into various Northwestern
States.
Wyoming Is receiving her full share of
this colonization. The Homestead Irriga
tion Company of Saratoga is making a
special effort to reclaim 200,000 acres of
land in the Saratoga Valley. Fifteen hun
dred farmers have already made applica
tion for tracts of this land. The Cody-
Ealsbury canal project. in Big Horn Coun
ty, Wyo . is another of the gigantic pro
jects, in which Colonel W. F. Cody, better
known as 'Buffalo Bill," is interested. It
contemplates taking water out of the
Shoshone-Riyer near the Colonel's town
of Cody, and carrying it fifty miles in a
ditch, to cover about 245,000 acres of good
agricultural â¢ land, now barren for the
want of water. 'S^'.'Ss. i;,
Another equally gigantic project of
Wyoming colonization Is that of a number
of bankers of The - Hague, - Holland, who
Â¦will establish a colony of Boers and Ho!
land Dutch on a tract of 300,000 acres Just
secured in the valley ; of. the Green River,
in Sweet Water County. The soil here is
especially adapted for sugar beet culture,
and a large refinery will be established.
Montana has do such vast tracts of arid
land lo be settled, but thÂ« State Land
'Commission has this year pursued a suc
cessful policy of auctioning off the State
.land grants to bona fl<ie settlers, in this
way $300,009 has been added to the endow
ment funds of various State schools,
'Many hundreds of thousands of acres yet
Â¦remain to be disposed of, the sale bo far
having only been conducted in two coun
ties.
The Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific railroads expect to handle a bigger
homeseekers' traffic the coming- spring
than ever before. Each road is planning
for at least 10,000 In the month of Febru
ary. Last winter and spring the two
roads brought 35,000 settlers into the
Northwest. The companies now have
their immigration agents at work
throughout the East. Farmers in various
parts of Montana have been asked to send
samples of what they can raise.
MUELLER PLEADS GUILTY
TO CHARGE OF ROBBERY
Companion of Aged Man Found Dead
Near Mount Olivet Makes
Confession. ,
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 23.â Fred Mueller,
charged with having: robbed aged Jacob
Huber, who was found dead near Mount
Olivet a few months ago, had his prelimi
nary examination to-day before Judge
Brown and shortly afterward pleaded
guilty before Judge Burnett in the Supe
rior Court. He will be sentenced on* Mon
day.
Considerable mystery attaches to Hu
ber's death and the Grand Jury has had
the case under investigation for several
days. Huber, Mueller and another man
known as Bassman had been traveling
together. Huber was the only one of (he
three known to have any money. About
the time of Hubcr's death Mueller dis
appeared, but not until he had displayed
evidence of suddenly acquired wealth.
Mueller was afterward arrested In the
southern part of the county and brought
back.
Receives ?Â«rious Burns.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 23.â Mrs. Charles
H. Holmes Jr.. wife of City Marshal an<S
Tax Collector Holmes, was the victim of
a distressing accident last night. While
< arrying a lamp across the sitting-room
she was seized by a spell of dizziness and
talL Oil from- the lamp saturated her
clothing and the oarpet and before the
flames could be extinguished Mrs. Holmes
was badly burned about the limbs and
body. Only prompt work on the part of
tlie family prevented the destruction of
the house ami its contents.
Rich widows are the only desirable sec
ond hand articles ou the market.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1901.
REDS BECOMING
SELF-SUSTAINING
Improved Condition of
the Indian Tribes of
Montana.
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 23.â The Indiana
of the Northwest are taking from the
shoulders of President Roosevelt his self
appointed burden of trying to find a solu
tion of the problem of making the Indian
a self-sustaining citizen of the United
States. President Roosevelt's long resi
dence in the West has made him especial
ly interested in this problem. "Washing*
ton dispatches state that he has of late
been holding long conferences with Indian
Commissioner Jones.
Commissioner Jones, like an economical
official, is looking at the financial aspect
of the situation. He believes that the
present annual appropriation of $15,000,000
for the care and maintenance of the vari
ous Indian tribes could and should be cut
down. He proposes that every male In
dian be given 160 acres of good agricul
tural land and told to go it alone. He
wants the President to urge Congress to
take action along these lines.
So far Jones is all -fight, but the facts
do not bear out his statement that the
continuation of the present system of
caring for the Indian wards of the Gov
ernment is making them more dependent
every year. This certainly does not hold
true In regard to the Indians of Montana-
Some interesting facts along this line
have been developed of late.
For Instance, Major J. E. Edwards,
agent for the Government on the Crow
Indian reservation, one of the largest in
the State, said to The Call correspondent:
"Aside from a few mendicants and pau
pers the Crows are now self-sustaining.
My reports to the department at "Wash
ington will bear out my statement that
the Crows are to-day the best and most
industrioys band in Montana, This has
been an exceptionally good year with
them. Those who farmed raised good
crops and found a good market for them.
"The principal business and big money
maker for the Indians Is stock raising.
Those following this line also did excep
tionally well this year. Their cattle
brought a good price. Many carloads have
been shipped East from the reservation.
Nearly all of them made their profits In
buying yearlings and generally Increasing
their herds. Some good horses were also
sold by the Indians to agents of the Brit
ish Government for use In the South
African war.
"The 2000 CrowÃ on the reservation are
taking kindly to the new order just put
In force from the department at Washing
ton, namely, that the rations be dimin
ished by degrees and finally cut off en
tirely, but the Crows have been practi
cally self-sustaining for some time."
The Assinibolns and Gros Ventres on
the Belknap reservation are other Im
portant tribes in this State. Concerning
their condition James C. Fltzpatrick, on
his way through Helena for a vacation
trip in the East, said:
"There is no feeling of unrest among the
Assinlboin and Gros Ventre Indians.
They are contented and happy and, what
1s better, they are becoming ambitious
and thriftr.
" 'Gros Ventres,' the name given this
tribe by the Canadian French many years
ago, means 'fat and lazy,' but this tribe
is fast dismerltlng the name. While they
are suave and easy going, they are by no
means lazy. I believe contact with the
Asslnlboins has done more than anything
else to dispel the ennui which so long
characterized the tribe.
"It used to be that the Indians were sat
isfied to lounge about their huts and draw
their rations, but of late years they have
become ambitious. Many of them are suc
cessful farmers. Others have large herds
of cattle and horses.
"The new order from the department
for the cutting down of rations will prin
cipally affect the 'squaw men,' white men
married to Indian wives. For years the
Government has been paying their gro
cery bills and they have been steadily
growing rich from their stock, fed on the
free ranees. I believe most of them will
move to other parts of the State now and
take up land. Strange as it may seem,
some of the happiest families I have ever
seen have been among this class. The
squaw men, as a rule, are kind and in
dulgent to their wives and families. I be
lieve the Indians are ably seconding the
apparent efforts of the Government to
make them self-supporting."
MAKING A FIGHT
FOR RECIPROCITY
President and Members
of the Cabinet Favor
Legislation.
In Opposition Are a Coterie of
High-Protection Senators
and Representatives.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â President
McKinley saw the commercial handwrit
ing on the wall and recommended reci
procity in hia last public utterance.
President Roosevelt believes that reci
procity is necessary as a safeguard for
commercial prosperity of the future, and
will recommend the principle in his forth
coming message. Secretary Hay will urge
a ratification of the Kasson treaties now
before the Senate. Secretary Gage favors
reciprocity legislation. Some of the great
manufacturers of the country, notably
those who export agricultural machinery
and Implementsâ and their business rep
resents hundreds of millionsâ have not yet
given up the fight, and will come here this
winter to get the ear of public oxen.
John A. Kasson, who negotiated the
treaties which bear his name, is
still firm in his position, but he
frankly admits that he see little hope
in the coming session. He is so hopeless
that he sees signs of doing away entirely
with the fourth section of tha Dingley
act.
Opposed to'all these men, who have
studied and thought out this question
enough to forecast the commercial future
of the country, are a coterie of high-pro
tection Senators and some pretty big men
like Dalzell in the House. They are well
known leaders and men of great influence
in both branches. In fact they . may be
said to dominate legislation. That is why
the reciprocity men are about ready to
throw up their hands and give up hope.
One faint ray left is the President, who
is now expected to speak in no uncertain
terms in his message.
While the outcome of the reciprocity
convention has hacT only a cold water
effect on the friends of the treaties
now in Washington it has stirred others,
notably in some of the Western States,
to renewed action, and already they are
beginning to let the President know their
views. Word has reached the President
that the Western people want reciprocity,
want it badly and want it now. At tho
same time comes the suggestion that they
are not disposed to leave a settlement of
a question so broad to a few influential
statesmen, who base their opinion on thÂ£
business interests of their own constitu
ents.
Los Angeles Sells Her Bonds.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23.â The City

MILLIONAIRES
ARE SUMMONED
Rich Men of New York
Must Obey a Court's
Order.
Financiers Pail to Appear
When Presence Is
Required.
NEW YORK. Nov. 23.â Several of New
York's millionaires have been summoned
to appear before Judg-e Lacombe in the
United States Circuit Court on November
29 to show cause why they should not be
punished for contempt of court.
The financiers who have been summoned
are William G. Rockefeller, Henry H.
Refers, P. J. Mclntosh, Frederick B. Ol
cott, James Stlllman, Anson Flower and
Leonard Lewisohn. The men are direc
tors of the Boston and Montana Consoli
dated Copper and Silver Mining: Company.
The order to appear was Issued to-day
upon the application of Attorney Frank
lyn Dien. who appeared on behalf of John
MacO-lnnlss, a plaintiff in an action
against the company.
Some time ago the Montana branch of
the court appointed a commissioner in
this city to examine the directors in con
nection with the case. The court set 10
o'clock yesterday morning for the exami
nation. At the hour set the only director
who appeared was Anson Flower.
Through his attorney he refused to give
any testimony or be sworn. The hearing

Interior Department Stops the Adver
tising of San Jacinto Beser
vation Tracts.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23.â 1t Is doubtful
If the three townships of the San Jaclnto
reserve will be thrown open to the public
on January 22, as formerly announced.
The matter had been advertised by the
local land office and many inquiries have
been received. However, a telegram has
been received from W ashington briefly
asking that publication be suspended. Ex
planations have been mailed.
The Â«vident postporement will prob
ably disappoint many persons from tha
East, as it is said several parties were
making preparations to come to Califor
nia to view the land. Despite the fact
that the greater portion of these lands
are outside the artes : an belt and are
pumping propositions, people appear to
be as eager as though property were
of fertile character.
SUING TO COMPEL
SON TO SUFPOBT HUB
Montana Woman Goes to Law With a
Pitiful Story of Suf
fering.
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 28.â 1f Mrs. Mary
A. Cronin wins a rather unusual suit she
has Just brought In the Butte courts
against her son, Francis John Cronin,
there will be no more deserting here of
aged mothers by sons who are able to ren
der them support and sustenance.
Young Cronin Is a miner and la making
good wages. His mother's complaint Is a
pitiful one. She says she is getting too old
to work, but that she has struggled hard
to make a living for herself and a younger
son. Her husband died several years ago.
The son who refuses to help his mother
lived at home until last September. "When
he left he gave all tradesmen notice that
he would pay no bills of his mother's con
tracting. She asks the court to compel her
son to pay her $10 a week.

A NIW ANNOUNCEMENT. '
Let Me Tell You
How to Get WelL
Send no money; simply state the bonk
you want- It will tel you what I spent
a lifetime In learning:
With the book I will send an order on
your druggist for six bottles of Dr.
Snoop's Restorative, and he will let you
i test a month. If satisfied, the cost 13
*5 50. if It fails, I will pay* your druggi3t
myself.
I do just as I say. Over half a million
people have secured my treatment In that
way, and 39 out of each 40 have paid for
It because they -were cared. Not a penny
is accepted if tt fails.
There are 39 chances In 40 that I can
cure you. No matter how difficult your
case, I take the' entire risk, for those half
million cases have proved what my rem-
edy can do.
My way Is to strengthen the inalds
nerves. I bring back the nerve- power,. .--
which alone makes each vital . organ do
i its duty. No other remedy does that:
and In most chronic diseases there is no
other way to get well. Don't let doubt or
prejudice keep you from asking about It.
Simply State Book No. lon Dyspepsia,
which book you Book No 2on th Hear %^i
want, and address Book Na 4 for Women '
Dr. Shoop. Box 630, Book No. 5 for Men. (sealed)
Racine. Wta. I Book No. ( on Rheumatism.
Mild cases, not chronic, are often cured
by one or two bottles. At all druggists'.
ENOTTN'CES AIfABCHY
IN THE COTHJTBY
Solicitor General Richards Speaks
of Its Suppression at a
Banquet.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. a.â The Union
League to-night celebrated "Founder's
Day" by a banquet, at whlcn many of the
guests of honor were men of national
prominence. Among the distinguished
guests were: Secretary of the Treasury
Gage, Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock.
Senator W. H. Frye, of Maine: ex-Attor
ney-General John W. Griggs, Postmaster-
General Charles Emory Smith, Secretary
of Agriculture Wilson, J. K. Richards.
Solicitor-General of the United States, and
"W. H. Hunt, Governor of Porto Rico.
Solicitor-General Richards spoke on the
topic: "A Present Peril. 1 suggesting
methods for the suppression of anarchy.
He said:
"A murderous assault upon the Presi
dent, aiming as it does at the life of the
Government, Imperils the safety of the
whole country, and whether successful or
unsuccessful should be punished by deaths
The freedom of speech for which ou#
fathers fought was not the right to ad-J
vocate the destruction by force and vio
lence of the government they founded.
The right of the United States to exclude
alien anarchists and to deport such as
have not yet become citizens must be
conceded. If Congress intrusts to the
President the power to exclude alien an
archists and to deport all unnaturalned
ones, I fancy it will not be difficult to put
in operation an effective plan of ridding
the country of these bloody-minded peo
ple."
Governor Hunt delivered an Interesting,
address on Porto Rico and the people of
that island, and Senator Frye dwelt
strongly on the need of Government aid
to shipping.
Redmond Talks of Lynch.
CHICAGO, Nov. 23â John E. Redmond,
who, Â¦with two brother members of Par
liament. Thomas O'Donnell and Patrick
McHugh, arrived here to-day to take part
in the Irish demonstrations to-morrow on
the anniversary of the execution of the
Manchester martyrs, expressing hi 3 opin
ion that Colonel Arthur Lynch would take
his seat In Parliament despite hia service
under the Boers, said:
"I think there i 3 no doubt Colonel Lynch
will take the seat to which he was elected. >
It Is altogether probable that his election ]
was the direct result of his service under
tha Boers. He is a man of ability and
can In no sense be considered a traitor.
What fighting he did was honorable wa*Â»
fare."

MINE ENTOMBS
THE INSPECTORS
Officials Who Entered
Virginia Shaft Not
Found.
POCAHONTAS. Va., Nov. 23.â A1l hope
of finding the eight mining officials who
entered the West mine yesterday to
search for bodies entombed by the recent
explosion in the .Baby mine has been
abandoned.
Up to 1 p. m. nothing had been heard of
them. A rescuing party entered the mine
this morning, but was able to proceed only
300 yards. The coat of Superintendent
O'Malley -was found hanging on a peg
about 200 yards in the mine, but no other
trace of the party was discovered.
The mining experts now here have de
cided upon a plan of attempted rescue,
but the mine officials refuse to give any
aDy information to the public. It is said
that another effort will be made this
evening to enter the mine. Hopes had
been entertained up to this morning that
the party had escaped through' the Tug
River outlet, three miles distant, and mes
sengers were dispatched at an early hour
to that point. They failed to find any
trace of the party.
Assistant Superintendent King, who led
the rescuing party and who was overcome
Iblackdamp, has recovered. He says it
mpossible for a human being to live
jen minutes in a mine in the condition
mine was when his party entered yes
terday.
It has been raining hard since early
morning, and the main entrance to the
mine presents a gloomy appearance, with
the friends and relatives of the missing
miners standing around.

CRITIC TROUBLES
OVER IRVING'S STRANGE
ENUNCIATION.
HILLARY BELL of the New York
Press has been saying things of
Sir Henry Irvine's Shylock, lately
seen in New York. Mr. Bell has
gone to . the trouble, with very
picturesque result, to spell out the Shakes
pearean blank verse as pronounced by Sir
Henry Irving, according to the Bell audi
[ tion. He prefaces this literary curiosity
; by saying:
[ There were times when Sir Henry ir.lg-ht as
well have translated the fount of English un
defiled, so far as coherence of sound and syl
lable were concerned, into Choctaw.
Here Is the .Irving English as heard by
Mr. Bell â it is perhaps necessary to state
that it is Shylock's speech to Antonio:
Wa thane, eet no eperes. Ah: I'm! yo neJ

I The New York Press critic then goes
on to say:
.- Only an intimate knowledge of the play
Itself can carry us through these puzzling
experiences, for when the actor becomes ex
cited by hi* role not even a professor of lan
guages can decipher him. With all his faults
Sir Henry is a wonderful player. In the battle
scene of "Macbeth" he abandons Shakes
peare's verse entirely and contents him with a
â¢series of grunts and Inarticulate exclamations,
yet whÂ« etta portray the Thane of Glamls bet
. ter? In hie scene wit h Tubal on Friday night
not one word In . ten could be distinguished,
even with an opera-glaesâ yet Irving' Shylock
is f. stroke of genius that has no parallel in
the annals of the drama.
It is i paradox that an actor who is defi
cient In one of the fundamental principles of
acting should remain in the applause of critics
and th*a**r-roers, be knighted by his sover
eign, and universally recognized as the great
est player of his day. The p.iy*s the thing
with us, as It was with Hamlet, and any per
former who so mumbles the language of the
drama that It cannot '. be understood must
merit condemnation, apparently, - rather than
compliment. Sir Henry Irving openly defies
elocution. He pronounces the English tongue
es it Is pronounced by no other man, woman
or child. He lards the flowing verse of
Shakespear* with ejaculations, interjections,
exclamations and inarticulate grunts that have
no place in the poet. Wholly apart from his
carriage, which is individual and unique, this
actor Is fecund with vocal eccentrictles that.
If the laws of logic ruled the theater, would
be rejected on the stage. Oddly enough, the
better he acts the worse he enunciates, until,
when the dramatic fervor is at its loftiest
height, the audience can make nothing of his
language.
The good old stand-by, "Yon Yonson,"
is to be the 'California Theater's pro
gramme this week, with the special Inter
est of a "yenuine Yon' in the title role.
Knute Erickson is his name, and Sam
Thall picked him up at Kullagunnarstop,
etc.. in Sweden, last summer, after see
ing him in the role in London. The honor
of being first comedian in Sweden Is
claimed for Mr. Erickson, and there is no
doubt of his success in England ana Ger
many in Swedish dialect parts. He is said
to resemble J. K. Bmmett in personal ap
pearance as that favorite actor-singer ap-
i peared in his younger days, and also sings
like him in a voice that vividly recalls
Â¦Emmett's. His humor is of the same rich,
spontaneous sort and he is going to show
us a Yon that, by all accounts, will range
itself with the delightful German dialect
characters of Emmett. The names in the
- supporting cast promise well.

matists, an Apology." in which he pre
sents some truths in ~ his usual forcible

for our stage lack ; virility, . argues that
America has not yet produced a dramatist
of the first rank and that none of those
now before the public give evidence of
real creative power. He insists' that it is
owing to this dearth, of strong dramatic
fare that a large class of Americans keep
aloof from the playhouse altogether. .. He
also accuses our -dramatists, of- pilfering
wholesale, blaming them little for this,
seeing that they merely follow in the foot
steps of Shakespeare and ' Mollere. but
finding* fault because they fall to embel
lish what they take. ' i:

ISOLATING- OONSUM-PTION:
INCIDENT to the discussion of quarantine and isolation of consumptive's on railway trains
Dr. Grant of Denver, in a paper read to the American Academy of Railway Surgeons last
year, described the liability to infection in the Pullman cars. The plush furnishings, drapery
with a nap and carpet on the floors, offer the needed facilities for harboring germs which
may easily inoculate the healthy traveler. Dr. Grant's paper did not at the time produce any
further impression than to draw a protest from some of the Pullman employes, who were con
vinced without trial that it would be impossible to run a car especially for invalids. One point
raised they did not answer, however, and that was in relation to the furnishing of the cars. There
can easily be some system of identifying a car in which patients have ridden so that at the ter
minal it may not only be dusted out, but thoroughly disinfected. If a traveler breaks out with .
smallpox it is found easy to disinfect the car in which he has ridden, and it should be just as
easy in the t case of the more fatal and deadly disease, consumption.
Judging by the news that comes up out of the deserts in New Mexico, Arizona and South
ern California the immigration of consumptives to those points is greatly increasing. In San
Diego County, in this State, the consumptive colony of Sunbath has been established. It has
long been known that our Indians are proof against consumption in their natural state, living an
outdoor life and during much of the year going almost nude. When they wear our costume, live
in houses and no longer get the sun direct upon a large part of their bodies, they languish and die.
Applying this knowledge, it has been the practice in the consumptive camps near Phoenix. Ariz.,
for the sufferers to spend the greater part of every day clad only in a breechclout. The sexes are
separated, of course, for the purposes of this treatment. The clothing is divested gradually to
harden the skin to the heat, and is finally discarded entirely and the body is exposed to the direct
rays of the sun in a temperature that ranges above a hundred In one of the sunbath 'camps in Ari
zona there were sixty patients, all of whom arrived in the last stages of the disease. In two years only
two have died; a majority of them have gained wonderfully and fifteen of the number have gone
home completely cured and as sound as ever. The pioneer in this heroic treatment was an actor
who was given up by his physicians. He went to Phoenix, bought a horse and tent and struck
out. into the desert, where he lived entirely naked for two years. At the end of that time he was
well and is back in his profession.
One interesting feature in this system is the unwillingness of the people to leave the desert
after they are cured. This is not due to fear of contracting the disease again, but to the fascination
of the desert itself. This is contrary to all that has been said in history and literature about the
desert, but those who have lain in its hot sands and have seen the night fall and the day break across
its shimmer, and have been in the enchantment of its mirages, and, above all, have heard the music
of its solemn silence, join in testimony to its charm.
The new camp at Sunbath is one hundred feet below sea level, in the Colorado Desert,
and capitalists from Phoenix have undertaken its development. They are having building mate
rial taken to the locality, and will build a sanitarium planned in consonance with the treatment by
direct exposure of the naked body to the sun.
The design will be to put this refuge within' the reach pf all, and to make it a public sani
tary enterprise of first importance. It is to be hoped that the projectors will guard against making
it too elaborate and too much a resort rather than a sanitarium. What the patients need is to get
back as near to nature as the wild Indian and get her blessing in health such as he enjoyed before
vice and civilization lured him from her.
In view of the founding of Sunbath and the desert camps, it ought to be easy for the rail
way surgeons, and the national and State boards of health, in conference with the Interstate Com
merce Commission and the Western Passenger Association, to reach a plan by which the sick who
journey to the life-giving sand and sunshine may be isolated from the well en route.
It will be glad tidings to Southern California that consumptive tourists are to be isolated in
this new retreat in the kindly desert, for their presence in the hotels and boarding-houses of that
section of the State has unfavorably affected the healthy tourists, who are afraid to travel with
them or to lodge in the same house, where carpets, hangings and curtains are so many traps for
catching germs that may infect scores.
As our California Board of Health was the first to suggest quarantine, may it not be hoped
that it will lead 'in securing the scarcely less important safeguard of isolation in traveling?
' THANKSaiVINO- WEEK.
CALIFORNIA enters Thanksgiving week with a prosperity not inferior to that of any
other State in the Union, and with bright prospects for the future. In the Eastern
States and in Europe the approach of winter has been heralded by storms of a severity
unusual for this season of the year. Heavy snows have fallen over all the country from
the Lake States to the Atlantic coast. Great Britain has been swept by tempests, while reports
from continental Europe abound with notes of bad and threatening weather. We, on the con
trary, are enjoying a fall propitious to every interest. We have had rains enough for the season
in nearly every part of the State, and nowhere have we had too much. On that score then if for
nothing else we would have good reason to rejoice in our good fortune and give thanks for the
blessing.'
In addition to our natural advantages we have cause for Thanksgiving in the well-ordered
condition of all our material interests. The disturbances between labor and capital which inter
rupted trade and industry for a time are ended upon terms satisfactory to the conservative on each
side. We can thus look forward to a long period of harmonious co-operation between these two
elements of the community., each of which is absolutely essential to the prosperity of the other.
The swift advance the people are making in wealth is manifest on every side. It is to be
seen in the number of new buildings arising in San Francisco and in other cities, in the improve
ments made on the farms, orchards and vineyards of the rural districts, and in the official reports
of banks and of the export and import trade of the port. We have, therefore, ample reason to ap
proach the great national festival in a genuine Thanksgiving spirit. Every State in the Union has
some cause for rejoicing, but none so many causes as California.
A short time ago Mr. Moore, Chief of the Weather Bureau, officially declared the practice
of cannonading hailstorms for the purpose of dissipating them was absurd and futile, but now
comes a report that the Swiss Government, after investigating the results of the experiments in
France, has come to the conclusion that cannonading is a good thing, and is to apply it in the
vine districts of Switzerland.'
Joseph Jefferson in his old age has begun to take an interest in the political affairs of the
country, and by way of improving things he suggests the election of two Presidentsâ one to shake
hands with the people and the other to attend to business. The suggestion has merit, but for
tunately at this time we have a President who is quite capable of attending to both jobs.
Two runaway girls in the East, when captured, explained their conduct by saying they in
tended to go to Bulgaria so that they could be kidnaped and thus be able to demand damages It
is sad their romance has been spoiled, for now they will have to seek damages in the common way
by suing some man for breach of promise.
There is said to a famine imminent in certain parts of Texas, and in the absence of fuller
information on the subject it is fair to infer that so many farmers have quit farming and gone to
boring their land full of prospect-holes that they are about to starve to death.
General Funston is never weary of doing startling things. The latest report is that he has
entirely recovered from the effects of the operation performed upon him for appendicitis. It seems
that even the surgeons dan't get ahead of him.
After all the talk about the famous blue Hope diamond it is announced that it isn't blue. The
report, it will be noted, was not made public until the gem was sold, so perhaps the pur
chaser is blue.
Boss Croker can bear to hear Seth Low and all the reformers laugh, but what grinds him is
the consciousness of the fact that there is a smile on the face pf David Bennett Hill.
Congress will be asked to repeal the tax on beer, the tax on whisky and the tax on tea, so
it looks as if there might be free drinks of all kinds before long.
THIS SEASON GIVES
GLIMPSE OF IMPRESARIO'S
MANY TROUBLES.
Blanche Partington
IT was thought last year that Mr. Grau j
was overinsistent in his pride In the j
fact that only once was the bill i
changed, and that in an insignificant \
detail, during his three weeks 1 season
here. But we have this year had a
glimpse of the troubles of an impresario,
and with sympathy for Mr. Grau comes
appreciation of the reasonableness of his
joy In last year's unchanged programme.
Not only the delicately throated Calve, j
but Fritzi Scheff. Van Dyck. Sybil San
derson and ether singers of lesser ilk
have been indisposed, with the result of
a general upsetting of programmes and
trouble all along the line. Nothing but
sympathy is expressed for Mr. Grau, who
has behaved In the handsomest possible ;
fashion under the trying circumstances. I
or for the singers, who are evidently Just
Â¦a sorry as we are for the various disap- |
pointments. The artists who are in good |
form have come to the rescue in noble
fashion, and. with their generous assist
ance, the season in spite of its troublous
course â or because of it â has 30 far been
even more successful than last year's.
Probably Mr. Orau never before gath
ered together a greater company
of artists than he has just now,
and the task of replacing one bill
by another has therefore been a
comparatively light one. But gratitude i
and admiration are due both to the im- j
presario and the singers for the splendid j
fashion in which this has been done. I
These they have in fullest measure, to- j
gether with the cordial liking and respect
of all those cognizant or the circum
stances. It is sincerely hoped that the
season's programme may now be carried
out without further disaster, for the ben
efit of all concerned, and at present it
looks that way.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The week has been chiefly remarkable
for the matchless performance of "LÂ«
Nozze di Figaro," the splendid production
of "Die Meistersinger" and the Carmen
of Calve, the fair lady who has upset
things so successfully this Beason. Not
least among the things Calve has upset
is the reigning conception of the part In
which ehe first found herself famous.
The other evening her audience was evi
dently puzzled, disappointed, even. In the
opening scenes of the interpretation. It
is pitched in quite another key from that
in which the majority of the audience
had determined that the role should be
played. It was therefore long before the
beauty of the Calve Carmen could make
headway against previous conceptions â
or misconceptionsâ of the part. The opera
is a favorite here and familiarly known
to every opÂ«ra-goer. The singer had to
contend with an opinion, practically the
bize of the audience, that was bounded on
the one hand by Zelie de Lussan's Car
men and on the other by the Tlvoli's gyp
sy, Collamarinl. The work of both has its
merits, too familiar to need description,
but it is the kind of thins they give
dramaticallyâonly more so, that was ex
pected from Calve in her Carmen. So
much we know. But that is exactly what
Calves Carmen is not. It is everything
else, and one at last greets it as the only
Carmen, the Prosper Mertmee Carmen
with Calves genius to boot.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Its subtle artistry is recognized from the
moment Calve appears, a barbaric splash
of color among the other girls but evi
dently of them. She makes no passionate
effort to catch the eye, but magnetizes at
tention Just as she draws the unfortunate
Don Jose to her, by the sheer force of her
greater beauty and sensuous charm. She
is imperially sure of herself, and exercises
her attractions with a lazy insolence that
is infinitely more realistic than the usual
busy coquetry of the Cajmen Interpreter
She is less busy fend therefore more Span
ish, all through the conception, but when
the flash of passion comes its thrill is
electric. Nothing more powerful upon the
stage has been seen than Calves acting
in the scene where she flnga down the
cards that prophesy death. Her face has
the dim horror of a thousand rears of su
perstition in its mobile depths, and every

lithe line of her figure spells a crouching
terror. Breath was scant in the house
j during that scene. in spite or the fact that
! she was unable to give it its full vocal
! expression. '
Calves conception is climactic in char
; acter. ; building up. little by little the pic
ture of the fascinating gypsy. Not a
touch . that can add truth or strength to
, the character is forgotten, from the odd
i charcteristic \ trick of . â¢â¢frizzing" a lank
; lock of hair-to the wearing of a trained
gownâ the sign manual of her kindâ
the dance scene. Its passion la' as deep
j as it is subtle, as all- p irvadiHa- -as it is
! deep, not depending for its advertisement
1 on the voluptuous tricks of the usual
1 Carmen, but slowly biting its way. into
the consciousness to startle at recog-.
i nition of its depth. All the bold vanity
! of the creature is there, .the tigerish
i grace, the splendid lawlessness, the cru
elty, a brilliantly consistent dramatic
conception, and Calve, the better than
beautiful, like a glowing tropical bloom,
looks Carmen to the last necessity.
She was not in good .voice the other
| evening, sang when she shouldn't, in fact,
and we do not, therefore, fully know what
she can do. She has the wonderful low
Carmen notesâ produced with exquisitely
legitimate artâ yet she sings Juliet. She
sings Carmen, yet . Marguerite is an
other favorite part. A marvelous com
! pass, and as could be heard the other
night the voice has a quality as beautiful
as It is rare. It will be the regret of a
lifetime, if Calve shall not recover suffi
ciently to be heard here at her best. She
is promised for a week from Saturday
night, and again in "Carmen."

GERMANS RULE
A SUGAR TRUST
British Merchants Dis
cover Existence of
Combination.
Vigorous Measures to Abolish
the "Kartell" Will Be
Taken.
LONDON, Nov. 23.â The British sugar
magnates assert that their investigations
have revealed the existence in Germany
of a great trust, called the "Kartell,"
which has been in existence about a year,
and that it is chiefly owing to its agency
that sugar has been forced down in Eng
land and other countries to the lowest |
point in the history of the industry, an'l
that Germany to-day is enabled to dictate
to the world the price of that commodity.
The exact extent of the "Kartell" was
discovered, they say, only quite recently. I
The magnitude of its operations supplied
the missing factors in the present alarm
ing condition of the sugar market.
The abolition of this organization will
be one of the chief objects of the nations
other than Germany attending the forth
coming Brussels conference. Already j
British linns have entered into negotia- j
lions with loading American sugar inter
ests and tables are now being drawn up
showing the transactions of the "Kartell,"
with a view of submitting them to the
authorities at Washington.
Threats From the British.
The British Government will be urged
to empower its representatives at tho
Brussels conference to threaten retalia
tory and countervailing measures unless
the "Kartell" is broken up or at least
modified.
The latest figures available in London
show that Germany now produces one
third of the world's supply of beet sugar,
of which she exports no less than 1,250,
00 tons after completely supplying her
own population. These exports, which are
almost one-fifth of the world's available
supply, are sent out at a loss to German
manufacturers, but thanks to the "Kar
tell," plus the bounty, they are able not
only to make up for this, but to reau a
handsome profit in addition to gaining
absolute control of the sugar market.
The "Kartell" is run very secretly, but
from confidential reports in London it is
learned that it consists of an ironclad
combination of almost all producers and
refiners to keep up the price of beet sugar
in Germany. This is done so successfully
that German consumers to-day pay as
much for sugar as the Briton does for the
same article imported from Germany.
Methods of the "Kartell."
The members of the "Kartell" bind
themselves to buj r from and sell only to
I those affiliated with the combine. This
I has worked so satisfactorily that the
I "Kartell" now includes practically every
factor of the sugar interests in Germany,
from the agricultural producers to the re
finer. The latter agrees always to pay
12.75 marks per hundred weight for the
raw article, though natural conditions
might ordinarily allow him to buy three
marks cheaper. This, however, insures
more permanently high prices to the con
sumer. The enormous profits consequent
upon these methods are pooled in the
"Kartell" and are' divided upon an elab
orate and ingenious scale, and the sur
plus product is disposed of at a slight loss
in other European and American mar
kets, though even this deficit is often
made up by the bounty that Germany pro
vides.
British sugar authorities are quoted as
saying that the German "Kartell" and
bounty combined will, within two years,
ruin the beet and cane industry In other
countries, especially in Cuba and the West
Indies.
CRITICS ROAR
AT THIS CRITIC
Literary London Upset
by an Article on
Stevenson
LONDON, Nov. 23.â Literary London is
stirred to its depths by a remarkable
criticism of the late Robert Louis Stevon
son, contributed by William E. Henley to
a Christmas number of a periodical.
"Blazing indiscretion," "ill-judged
screed" and "lampoon" are samples of
the terms applied to the article by indig
nant and surprised admirers of the author
of "Treasure Island." Even those who
attempt to defend the justice of the criti
cism find that it lays Henley open lo
charges of disloyalty and bad taste. The
Dally News is emphatic in its protest. It
says:
"We are not surprised that the literary
world is scandalized. It is astonishing
that any man of ordinary feeling should
have written in such terms of a dead
friend. One thing is made quite clear by
the article. Stevenson has a genuine
hold upon the affections of his country
men, and that affection will last long
after Mr. Heniey's ill-judged screed is
forgotten."
A wiiter on the Star affects to regard
the article, as a literary hoax. He says:
"Henley was Stevenson's friend of
friends. Therefore he could not have
written this lampoon. Doubtless Henley
deems the imposture unworthy of the
honor of exposure."

OLD CRUISERS
ARE DEFECTIVE
Severe Criticism of the
Albany and New
Orleans.
Two Vessels Bought in Eng
land Must Be Recon
structed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov . 23.â Serious
defects which make the ships unfit for
habitation have been discovered in the
protected cruisers Albany and New Or
leans.
These vessels are sister ships, and were
purchased at Elswick, England, just be
fore the outbreak of the war with Spain.
Surgeon Harris, recently attached to the
Albany, and now on duty on the Monoc
acy, says in an official report that from
a sanitary point of view the Albany is so
radically defective that it is almost im
possible to relate in detail the necessary
changes which will have to be made be
fore she can be transformed into a reason
ably sanitary teasel.
The space on board is not sufficient to
meet the requirements of the health of
the crew. Ventilation from the deck
should be provided for tne entire berth
deck from the engine room forward. Sur
geon Harris thinks an improved system
of ventilation is absolutely necessary.
"It is impossible to overestimate," he
says, "the danger to health of those who
are berthed in wing passages should the
weather require the ship to be battened
down for several days. With a tempera
ture of 136 degrees F. it is obvious that
people could not live in these places.
"The reason that the health of the
crew of this ship has been about the
average since she went into commission is.
in the first place, that she has never had
her full complement of men aboard her.
and, in the second place, that she has
done most of her cruising in favorable
weather. If these conditions are material
ly changed, the health of the crew will,
in my opinion, proportionately suffer."

LONDON, Nov. 23.â Public interest In
the hearing of the charges against Theo
dore Jackson and Laura Jackson (Ann
O'Delia Diss, de Bar) fit the Marylebone

been taken in Joliet penitentiary. The
woman prisoner at that stage of the pro

counsel, saying that a^e was never there,
whereupon counsel Jar the prosecution
said that if her identity was disputed they
would call an officer from Chicago.
A photograph of Theodore Jackson,
taken in New Orleans, was also shown.
Both of the prisoners, testifying in their
own behalf, denied the charges made
against them. Jackson said he had been
the adopted son of Swami. as the woman
prisoner had been frequently referred to,
for twenty years.
Though the case was adjourned for a
week, the magistrate announced that he
would commit the woman for trial on the
charge of swindling, and that he would
also commit Jackson on other charges.

BULLION THIEF
EXPECTS PARDON
James Heney Elects to
Remain in Nevada
Penitentiary.
Refuses to Gain Liberty
by Signing Pauper's
Oath.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, Nov. 23 -James Heney, sen
tenced to eight years : i the Nevada peni
tentiary for complicity in the robbery of
the United "States Mint in this city, has
completed his sentence, save in respect to
the $5000 fine imposed ,n addition to the
imprisonment. There are three ways Ea
which Heney could have regained his lib
erty to-dayâ by paying his tine, by mak
ing oath beforo Comnassioner Edwards
that he is a pruper and unable to p.-ty
the fine, or by President Roosevelt re
mitting the fine. The logical way would
have been to take the pauper's oath. To
do this one must sign papers making an
application to hs) taken before the Com
missioner, after having served notice on
the United States District Attorney.
When the papers were presented to
Heney for his signature he refused to
affix it. In default of having taken ad -
vantage of any of the three ways men
tioned Heney must se~ve out his $5000 fine
at the rate of $2 a day, or 2500 days. It is
hardly likely that he proposes to do this,
and it is probable that he looks for clem
ency on the part of the President.
Had Heney taken the pauper's oath and
obtained his liberty he would still have
occupied an unpleasant position. The
amount of the fine would have hung over
his head as a judgment, and if he ever
acquired property to the value of $5000 the
Government could step in and confiscate
It. Or if he has monry in hiding which
he can obtain upon his release and the
Government's secret agents learned of it
he would stand convicted of perjury ar>d
be in for another term in the peniten
tiary.

MILLIONAIRE BRADBURY FLEES FROM WRATH
OF CORTE MADERA WOMAN WITH SHOTGUN
?
Dispute Growing Out of a Real Estate Trade Results in a Hostile Demonstration and
an Involuntary Attempt to Lower the World's Sprinting Record*
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 23.â The novel spectacle of a tall, well dressed mil
lionaire running zig-zag uown the county turnpike at Corte Madera,
v.ith an irate woman trying to draw a bead on him with a shotgun,
greeted the eyes of the citizens of that place yesterday afternoon
and supplied them with a fresh topic for neighborly comment. The
millionaire who fled from a couple of charges of buckshot was none other
than W. B. Bradbury of San Francisco. The woman behind the gun was
Mrs. S. Enna of Corte Madera. ' ;
The affair was the result of a trade. Mrs. Enna owned a house and lot
in the little town that Bradbury wanted â that Is, he wanted the lot, with
out the house. After extended negotiations between the two a trade was
effected, whereby Bradbury was to give Mrs. Enna a lot, remove her house
to it and then hand her $50 "to boot."
According to all reports it was the "boot" that caused the trouble. The
lot was given and the house was moved, but the $50 came not to Mrs. Enna.
In fact, according to her story, Bradbury denied that he owed her $50.
Bradbury accompanied by a couple of trusty ploughmen, repaired to his
newly acquired lot yesterday afternoon and commenced to plough up the soil

Pan-American Congress
Discusses Big Im
provement.
MEXICO CITY, Mex.. Nov. 23.-Now
that the Pan-American delegates have
returned from their excursion they are
getting down again to serious work. In
addition to the resolution adopted by the
committee on banking and monetary ex
change the Pan-American Railroad com
mittee, of which Senator Henry W. Davis
is chairman, held this afternoon an im
portant meeting. Senator Davis present
ed a long and interesting report.
While no definite action was taken by
the committee, it is understood that the
committee is in favor of giving evedy
possible encouragement to an interconti
nental railroad. The practical action
which the committee will in all proba
bility take will be first, to create a com
mittee with headquarters in Washington
in which all the smaller American re
publics are to be represented, and which
will keep the project alive; second, to
empower Senator Davis to interest
American capitalists in the project to the
extent that may be necessary; third, to
secure a pledge from the interested Gov
ernments of substantial aid to the pro
ject, either in the form of pecuniary sub
sidy or lands for colonization; and,
fourth, to pledge the more prosperous
countries to aid the construction of a
railroad through such of the American
countries as might not be able on account
of the condition of their finances to do
their share of the work unaided.
The committee on Pan-American bank
ing and monetary exchange at its ses
sion to-day approved a resolution favor
ing the establishment of a large bank
ing institution, located in New York, do
voted to the commercial interests of
North, Central and South America,
with agencies or correspondents in the
principal cities of the republics of
America, and doing business on the same
principle, charging the same rates of in

COLD TN THE HEAD,
SAYS MBS. CLEVELAND
Wife of Former President Gives a
Statement About Her Hus
band's Illness.
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. 23.â Mrs.
Grover Cleveland made the following
statement to-day:
"Mr. Cleveland is suffering from a cold
In the head, which he contracted a short
time ago. He was most annoyed by It
on Thursday, but since then has been
resting comfortably. He has not been
threatened with pneumonia, and if he has
been in any danger whatever of serious
illness there is surely no further indica
tion of it in his present condition. He is
confined to his room, but we expect his
complete recovery very soon."
Cleveland contracted the cold while on
a gunning trip in North Carolina- He re
turned to Princeton early in the week and
since thÂ«n has been indisposed. Although
confined to his room, his closest friends
have felt no anxiety over his condition,
as Dr. J. H. Wickoff, the family physi
cian, told them Cleveland had nothing
more serious than a cold.
When pressed for a statement on Cleve
land's condition, Dr. James H. Wickoff,
the attending physician, gave out the fol
lowing for publication:
"Mr. Cleveland's cold is broken up an<i
it is only a matter of two or three days
when he will be fully recovered. Although
the danger is passed, Mr. Cleveland has
been Quite ill."
DON CARLOS' DAUGHTER.

Romance of Princess Elvira of^Bour
bon Ending Pathetically in
Barcelona.
ROME, Nov. 23.â Princess Elvira of
Bourbon, infanta ot Spain, and second
daughter of Don Carlos, has reached the
end of her romance. She has been aband
oned by the Roman painter, Folchi, with
Â¦whom she eloped four years ago, and is
now lying dangerously ill and almost en
tirely destitute at Barcelona, with no one
to care for her but her old French maid,
who has remained faithful to her through
all her adventures.
A Barcelona priest whose pity has been
aroused by her misfortune has just ar
rived in Venice for the purpose of invok
ing the pity of the pretender for his
daughter and with the object of bringing
about a reconciliation between Don Carlos
and his child, who, according to all ac
counts t hajÂ» not many weeks to live.

on the scene.
"This lot is not yours, Mr. Bradbury, until you pay me the $50 boot, and
this work will have to stop," remarked the insistant woman.
Bradbury denied the debt and ordered the men to continue their work.
Then Mrs. Enna did some ordering. From the ample folds of a shawl she
unlimbered a hungry looking shofgun in full working order.
"Get off this land, and quick," she exclaimed.
Bradbury got. From his speed it was believed that he intended getting
off the earth. His men* also mounted their horses and fled. The woman
and her shotgun reigned supreme. In the excitement of the moment, it is
said, Mr. Bradbury forgot the range of a shotgun and ran some two miles
further than necessary.
Bradbury is well known in San Francisco, where several years ago he
came into prominence by trying to defeat an anti-expectorating ordinance.
He was arrested and convicted of drenching a streetcar floor with the frag
rant juice .of some plug-cut.
Mrs. Enna still holds her lot, awaiting the "boot."

and exacting a promise of reformation,

During the performance in the Grand
Opera-house last evening Miss Van Buren
again complained of the loss of several
articles from her dressing room, and Mr.
Frawley caused Chase to be taken in cus

When interviewed in the oity Jail by Mr.

paper adds:
"We may depend upon having to cope

Rider Severely Hurt.
A Cincinnati man visiting in Texas, on
a ranch, was thrown from a horse and so
-* severely injured that his life was de-
spaired of. He takes pride in telling how
'. ood saved his life. The heavy drugs
piven seriously injured his stomach and
as he says, "It seemed I would soon have
to starve in the midst of plenty. My
â¢-tomach refused to digest food and I
ran down from 165 to 133 pounds. When
my appetite failed I was ready to give
up, and it looked as though I would
soon wink out. 1
"One morning the foreman's daughter
brought in what she called a splendid
food, and it turned out to be Grape-Nuts.
A little skeptical I ate it and found !t
was roc -1. and just the kind of food I
oculd keep on my stomach, which had
been almost burned out by the vile drugs.
"I felt. that I had obtained a new lease
of life, for improvement set in at once.
A week later I was weighed and had
gained two pounds. My weight has' since
steadily increased by the constant â¢ use
of Grape- Nuts, and I am now better than
I have been in years, as my friends will
Â all testify.

WELL-EARNED PROMOTION
FOR POPULAR SERGEANT
Members of Company B, First Infantry, Advance
John O'Keefe to Second Lieutenancy.
POPULAR YOUNG NATIONAL GU ARDSMAN WHO HAS BEEN CHOSEN
SECOND LIEUTENANT OF COMPANY B, FIRST INFANTRY REGI
MENT, N. G. C BEING PROMOTED FROM SERGEANT.
A QUIET investigation has been
made in regard to a practice
which it is claimed is not only
reprehensible, but detrimental to
discipline in the guard, that has
prevailed for some time in this city. It is
in regard to the playing of cards in some
of the company rooms in the armoriP3.
And it came about in this way. So.â¢
time since a young mvn enlisted in one
of the companies, and his parents soon
discovered that he went to the armcry
oftener than <luty required, so the fathe"
made a visit to the plact and in the com
pany room found his son and several oth
ers engaged in a game of poker. The re
suit was that at the :'ext meeting thc-e
was an application to the company com
mander for a discharge from the service
on account of removal.
This matter having ccme to the knowl
edge of superior offlceis, an inquiry was
started, with the result that it has bear.
discovered that not only is poker in
dulged in, but that in some of the com
panies the officers join with the enlisted
men in a friendly game of draw, often tv
their satisfaction and at the expense of
the men. Such is no doubt prejudicial to
discipline, so think those in authority, an l
it is probable that as a result of the in
vestigation an order will be issued calling
attention to the matter and giving \
warning that c continuance of the prac
tice will result in various court-martials.

Robbed by a Roommate.
ANGELS CAMP. Nov. 23.â Frank Mon
teverde, a saloon-keeper, let Joe Berg of
Carters share his .room last night. Berg
arose at 5 o'clock this morning and de
parted, telling Monteverde he was going
to Robinsons Ferry. When Monteverde
arose he missed 5300. He at once began
to look for Berg, but did not succeed in
finding him until this afternoon. "When
officers tried to capture Berg he fled and
was not caught until he had run about
two miles. He was brought to town and
locked in Jail. When he was searched
only 55 cents was found. It is believed he
took the money and buried it before the
officers caught him.

GRIP
(From N. Y. Sun.)
A New Form of Grip Epidemic.
Within the last week the physicians of
this city have made the discovery that
Grip in a strange form ls epidemic. The
attack is accompanied by pains in the
muscles, particularly of the arms and
shoulders, which suggest the twinges of
rheumatism. Vague sensations in the
chest of a very uncomfortable description
induce a "rone" and forlorn frame of
mind. There is a sharp cough, but the
most distressing features of ordinary Grip
are lacking.
The prompt use of Dr. Humphreys' Spe-
cific SEVENTY-SEVEN ("77") will break
up the worst attack of Grip and Colds.

PROTECTION AIDS
GERMAN INDUSTRY
Preamble of New Tar.ff
Bill Proves Most
Interesting.
Necessity of Replacing the
Exsting Measure With
Entirely New One.
BERLIN, Nov. 23.â The Government's
preamble to the new tariff bill, issued to
the members of the Reichstag to-day, sets
forth the necessity of replacing the ex
isting tariff by an entirely new one that
3hall not be inferior to that of any other
country in delicacy of arrangement. Pro
tective tariffs, it ls added, have con
tributed materially to . the prosperity of
German industry and commerce. In con
nection with this prosperity a dislocation
in the distribution of the wage-earning
class has taken place, to the detriment
of agriculture. The increase in the
wages of agricultural laborers caused
by the increase of the wages of
the industrial classes has resulted in
an almost intolerable increase in the
working expenses of the agriculturists.
On the other hand, there has recently
been a setback in the upward movement
of German industry.
Whether this setback has reached its
lowest ebb or how long it will last can
not be calculated to a certainty. In or
der to avert the disastrous consequences
which that dislocation mentioned will
eventually have, not on agriculturists
alone, but on the whole community, tho
adoption of effective counter-measures
can no longer be delayed. One of the
bill's essential aims is to place home agri
culture in a more favorable position by
affording it such greater customs protec
tion as will alleviate the disadvantages.
Although it is not expected that grain
imports can be entirely dispensed with
it is highly desirable to have the perma
nent home production sufficient for the
greater part of the nation's requirements.
In any case the dependence of home price
on internal prices will continue. The pos
sibility of feeding the people ls being
rendered more and more difficult, and this
necessity certainly imposes the obligation
to exercise the greatest caution. Never
theless, should it be found that this bur
den is laid on the consuming public the
burden must be borne, in order that dan
gers far more serious to the state shall
be avoided.
Respecting commercial treaties with
other countries, the Government is ready,
after the tariff bill is disposed of, to enter
in due course in negotiations to these ends
with those countries desiring to do so.
The recasting of the tariff bill will not
prevent the country from effecting new
commercial treaties. Nevertheless, tne un
certainty of politics and of the commer
cial future, the tariff bill provides for
more severe compensation measures.
It is desired that the new tariff become
effective January 1, 1904. As, however,
there is little probability of new commer
cial treaties becoming operative at the
same time, desirable as this may be, the
bill reserves that the fixing of the date
upon which the new tariff shall become
effective shall be by imperial decree, with
the assent of the Federal Council.

CHAPMAN UNDER
GRAVE SUSPICION
May Have Been Acces
sory to the Murder
of Mole.
Dolan Gives Himself Up but
Refuses to Talk of the
Crime.
John M. Dolan, believed to be the mur
derer of Alfred A. Mole, who was stabbed
to death on O'Farrell street early Friday
morning, gave himself up at the Hall of
Justice yesterday morning. He refuses
to discuss the murder or to answer ques
tions. Meanwhile Hugh B. B. Chapman,
who Â¦was with Mole and Dolan for some
hours ixrlor to the murder, has caused
suspicion to be directed at him by his
contradictory statements, and he as well
as Dolan will be held in custody until
after the Coroner's inquest at 10 o'clock
to-morrow forenoon.
Detectives Tom Gibson and Hamill are
satisfied that Dolan Is the man who
plunged the knife into Mole's heart. They
are also convinced that Chapman saw
the b:awl, even if he did not participate
In it. It is even possible that Chapman
and liolaxi are the two men who followed
Mole home Saturday night a week ago
and tried to force an entrance to his
room, and at whom he fired five shots.
Chapman at first admitted to the de
tective* that he saw Dolan strike Mole.
LÂ»ater lie denied having made such a state
ment, and last night he brazenly told
Gibson that he had made no statement
cf any kind, though there were seven
witnesses to lus statement to the detec
tives.
Dolan i>= a stocky young fellow of hard
character and bad record. He has been
living at BH O'Farrell street with a
woman known at 19 Bacon place as Clara
Dolan. It was she who was taken lo
the police station Friday night and
locked up. The man arrested at the same
time was Thomas Casey, who occupies
the rear bedroom of the suite in which
Dolan and the woman have lived. Dolan
had been drinking- heavily and keeping
under cover since the murder, but yes
terday morning, when he learned that the
woman and Casey were locked up, he
went in and surrendered himself, saying
he migtit as well "face the music." He
refuses to talk until he has seen an at
torney, but he shows unconcern about
getting a la-w-yer. having evidently been
coached by one before he surrendered
himself.

THE RIGHT THING.
A New Catarrh Cure, Which Is
Rapidly Coming to the Front.
For several years, Eucalyptol Guaicol
and Hydrastin have been recognized as
standard remedies for catarrhal trouble,
but they have always been given sepa-
rately and only very recently an Ingenious
chemist succeeded In combining them to-
gether with other antiseptics, into a
pleasant effective tablet.
Druggists sell the remedy under the
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and It
has met with remarkable success in the
cure of nasal catarrh, bronchial and
throat catarrh and In catarrh of the
stomach.
Mr. F. K. Benton, whose address is care
of Clark House. Troy, N. V., says: "\VhÂ°n
I run up against anything that is good I
like to tell people of it. I have been
troubled with catarrh more or less for
some time. Last winter more than ever
Tried several so-called cures, but did not
get any benefit from them. About six
weeks ago I bought a 50 cent box of Stu-
' art's Catarrh Tablets and am glad to say
that they have done wonders for me and
I do not hesitate to let all my friends
know that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are
the right thing."
Mr. Geo. J. Casanova of Hotel Griffon
"West 9th street. New York City, writes-
"l have commenced using Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and already they have
giver, me better results than any catarrh
cure I have ever tried."
A leading physician of Pittsburg advises
the use of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets in
preference to any other treatment for
catarrh of the head, throat or stomach
He claims they are far superior to in-
halers, salves, lotions or powder, and are
much more convenient â¢ and pleasant to

dren take them with benefit, as they con-
tain no opiate, cocaine or any poisonous

MRS. EMILY STEPHENS, wife

The couple were married last May, her

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1901.
about twenty minutes later Mrs. Brown,
who lives . next door, heard a scream.
Not hearing a repetition of the noise, she
paid no further attention to the matter
until about 8:30 o'clock she detected the
odor of illuminating gas and called the
attention of the father of Mr. Stephens,
who resides with his son and daughter
in-law, to it.
Mr. Stephens, who is old and feeble,
tried to open the door of Mrs. Stephens'
room, from which the gas was escaping,
but found that it was barricaded on the
inside with some heavy object that he
could not dislodge. He called C. C.
Bouvier to his assistance and they suc
ceeded in pushing aside a bureau that
formed the barricade and effected an en
trance. They found the dead body of the
other children, he claims, time and again,
but they have turned a deaf ear to his
entreaties, notwithstanding that they are
well able to contribute toward the com
fort of the old people.
The plaintiff estimates that his parents
have cost him $35 a month, and wants
the court to order the rest of the family
to shoulder part of the burden. He also
sues to recover $840, which he claims ho
has spent on his parents above his share
during the last two years.

Joseph A. Skellen, a soldier, was ar
rested yesterday by Sergeant Donovan

accused of breaking into the room of Ha

unfortunate woman, the head resting on
the floor and the feet on the bed. A bot
tle, in the bottom of which was a small
quantity of muriatic acid, was on the
bureau. This bottle had been in the base
ment and was used by Mr. Stephens for
cleaning shells for his shotgun. Burns
on the dead woman's mouth and chin
showed that she had swallowed some of
the acid. The gas stop was opened to
Its fullest extent and the room was full
of the lethal fumes. There was no scrap
of writing found that would throw any
light on the woman's reason for self-de
struction.
Deputy Coroner Brown visited the
Stephens residence and made an investi
gation. He was satisfied tl.at the unfor
tunate woman was demented when she
committed the deed. The body was al

enthusiasm by lis subordinates. At th<?

PROFESSOR MAOEE SPEAKS
ABOUT PHYSICAL CULTURE
Outlines Its History, Beginning With
Its Introduction in Philadelphia
by Benjamin Franklin.
Professor Magee of the University of
California delivered another of his inter
esting lectures on physical culture last
night In the auditorium of the Y. M. C.
A. building. The professor described 'n
an entertaining manner the history of
physical culture In the schools and col
leges of thlÃ country, beginning with its
introduction in Philadelphia by Benja
min Franklin. The speaker declared that
Thomas Jefferson was a firm advocate
of bodily exercise and was instrumental
in having It Introduced in the University
of Virginia,
The professor stated that In the begin
ning the teachers neither had the train
ing nor Inclination to gain success In the
domain of physical culture. He said that
the apparatus was usually exposed to the
weather, that little interest waa mani
fested by the instructors and that little
or no money was forthcoming to con
struct and equip gymnasiums. He as
serted that the first gymnasium at Har
vard University was not constructed un-
STUDENTS ARGUE
ON ANNEXATION
The Commercial Society
Wins From Vacaville
High School.
Judges Are Out a Long Time
Before Reaching a
Decision.
Under the auspices of the Debating
League of California, the Commercial
Evening Debating Society and the Vaca
ville High School had a lengthy debate
last night at the Girls' High School aud
itorium. So closely contested was the
debate that the three Judges used the
best part of half an hour to decide where
honors rested. They finally decided in
favor of the Commercial Society.
The subject was: "Resolved, That the
annexation of the Philippine Islands is
a detriment to the United States." The
Commercial Society, represented by David
E. Marchus, E. J. Rellly and R. S. Law
lor, had the affirmative. The negative
was in the hands of the Vacaville High
School, represented by Hugh Bucking
ham, Jourdan Hayte and Joseph Koford.
Charles Wesley Reed, H. Barcar and Pro
fessor Martin Flaherty of the University
of California were the iudges.
David E. Marchus opened the debate
for the. affirmative. He said that toe
United States in annexing the Philippines
has violated the principles of natural
law. He also declared that the purposes
of freedom as well as freedom itself were
subverted by the annexation of the Phil
ippine Islands.
Hugh Buckingham was the first to
speak for the Vacaville students. He said:
We have sown, now we must reap. Now that
the United States has become a tactor in the
great international drama the part must b_>
played out. We have tried the fortunes of
war and must now act upon our victories. The
Oriental trade or anything which makes us
closer to the Oriental countries must be
nurtured. Other things being equal the friend
ship of nations increases as the distance be
tween them decreases. The possession of the
Philippines will tend to increase the friendship
between the United States and other countries.
E. J. Reilly had the next inning for the
affirmative. He said:
We will look at this question from the po
litical standpoint. If we look at the Filipinos
as subjects we Bet Into trouble. Has not the
constitution guaranteed life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness? We know that American
labor cannot suffer the introduction of Filipino
labor Into our country. Although we have our
flag floating over the Philippines the Inhab
itants Import but a very small percentage of
the total.
Jourdan Hayte, second speaker for the
negative, expounded the doctrine of ex
pansion. He said that the history of this
country shows nothing but expansion.
Louisiana, Florida, Texas, California and
Alaska were made examples in the evi
dence for the benefits of expansion.
R. S. Lawlor was the last speaker for
the affirmative side. He said we could
not expand in territory occupied by ninety
people to the square mile when we in
America have territory occupied by only
twtnty to the square mile.
With Joseph Koford rested the closing
for the negative. R. S. Lawlor took up
the rebuttal, and when he had concluded
the Judges retired to deliberate upon a
decision.

HIGHWAYMAN FIRES TWO
SHOTS AT FLEEING VICTIM
Rivey Van Anden Tells Police Hs Is
Believed of Coin and
Watch.
Rivey Van Anden, who resides at 14
Stanley place, reported to the police lati
last night that he had been held up ani
robbed by a lone footpad in the vldnft/
of the Second rtreet bridge. He claimed
that the robber fired two shots to prevent
him from escaping and compelled him to
deliver up his watch and chain and money
at the point of a pistol
Van Anden in making his report stated
that at the time of the hold-up he was on
his way home. He said he had reached
a point a little below the Second street
bridge when the footpad, approaching him
from the opposite side of the street, point
ed a pistol at his stomach and demanded
that he turn over his money. Van Anden
saM that instead of complying he took
to his heels and attempted to escape. He
claimed that he was brought to a halt
by two shots from ths footpad's revolver.
He informed the police that after he had
stopped the footpad came up and relieved
him of his watch, chain and some sma'l
change.
After the robbery the highwayman Is
said to have walked .eisurely away in
the direction of the S-cond street bridg3
Apparently no one was attracted by the
shots that he fired after Van Anden. Tne
man who claims to have been held up de
clared that he could recognize the foot
pad among a thousand. He stated that
the man had a heavy blsck mustache and
wore h'.s hat pulled down tightly over hi 3
head, partly concealing his face.

WRONGED WOMEN
SEEKING REVENGE
â H-
Are Determined to Con
vict Fred/Pi nard of
Bigamy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Nov.. 23.â Fred N. Pinard,
who deserted - his young wife of a few
months to marry a second time, had hi 3
preliminary examination before City Jus
tice Cobb to-day on a charge of bigamy.
A few days ago a similar charge against
Pinard was dismissed In the Superior
Court, after he had once pleaded guilty,
because his lawful wife, who had sworn
to the complaint, could not testify against
him.
About a year ago Pinard married Julia
Alvord. but left her and married Stella
Herman without procuring a divorce.
The two women, when they learned that
Pinard had played both false, decided to
punish him. and Mrs. Pinard No. 1 swore
to. a complaint. He was held to answer,
but when the case came to trial his at
torney contended that Mrs. Pinard could
not testify against her husband. Mrs. Pin
ard No. 2 then swore to another com
plaint. Not being his legal wife, she will
be enabled to testify against him.
Evidence was taken to-day to prove
Pinard had committed bigamy. The case
went over to "Wednesday, when a motion
to dismiss the complaint will be argued.
An Olympian Social.
The members of Olympla Grove and of
Olympla Circle, United Ancient Order of

under the direction of Floor Manager
Herbert G. Armstrong, assisted by J. H.
Heath, Harry Ford, Robert Driscoll and
Samuel Nichols.

SAYS HUSBAND
WAS JUSTIFIED
Colorado Jurist Speaks
of Cruelty Toward
Woman. w
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Nov. 23.â "Wholesome p*raÂ»
ishment is a good thing for some women,
and if this woman refused to accompany
her husband to his home he was perfectly
justified in forcing her along. Such an act
cannot be characterized as cruelty."
Judge Palmer delivered himself of this
opinion yesterday during the course of
his charge to the jury before which waa
tried the suit of Ethel G. Richards for
divorce from George V. Richards on tba
ground of cruelty and non-support.
Mrs. Richards and her close friend, Mrs.
G. L. Gerard, had attended a public dance.
Richards interrupted their pleasure by
taking his wife by the shoulders and com
pelling her to go home with him. Mrs.
Richards said her husband had sworn at
her frequently.
"When a woman marries a man she
undertakes to live with him. in his station
in life. If he has provided her with the
living that was within his means then
he ha 3 fulfilled his obligations. Concern
ing the allegation of cruelty, wholesoma
punishment Is good for some women. If
the defendant wanted his wife to go with
him and she refused, then he had a per
fect right to take such means as would
compel her to accompany him, although
he should not strike her. Home was the
proper place for her, and not a danca
hall.
"It is also charged that the defendant
swore at the plaintiff. Swearing need not
necessarily constitute cruelty. Some
women would only laugh at an oath while
others would suffer acutely."
The Jury returned a verdict for Mm
Richards without leaving the box.
Slight Rainfall in City.
A small amount of rain fell In San

MISS ETHAI/TX M. DEPETV.
In an Interview with *. reporter at her home
aTter the operation Miss Depew said: "I be-
came Interested ln the science of. hypnotism by
a book called The Philosophy of Personal In-
fluence,' which was sent me freÂ« by the New
Tork Institute of Science. I read the book
carefully and It rave me confidence In the
marvelous power. I decided to be hypnotised :
for the operation. I am simply delighted with
the successful result and so are all my friends.
r I believe hypnotism Is the most powerful hu-
J man agency on earth for rood. I earnestly
advise every one to send for the book I have
mentioned. It does not cost a single cent and
tells how you can quickly acquire a mighty
hvpnotlc power and cure yourself and the eick
and the suffering around you. I would not be
without the knowledge I have gained from
this book for anything in the world. Anybody
who desires to improve his condition in life or
master a perfect method for heaiing the sick
ought to write for it immediately."
The reporter also learned that the demand
for the free book referred to by Miss Depew
has been so great that the directors have Just
decided to print a special edition of five thou-
sand copies and distribute them absolutely
free. It is requested, however, that only those
write ror It who are really interested. This re-
quest is made because the special edition of
the books will be published at great expense
and it is "manifestly unfair 10 people who are
really in earnest to be deprived of the oppor-
tunity to pet vital information which will help
them all through life by mere curiosity seek-
ers. The bock is totally unlike anything ever
printed. It contains the writing's of the most
lamouf hypnotic specialists in the tvr.rld. It is
richly illustrated with the finest half-tone en-
gravings of thrilling and amusing hypnotic
scenes end experiments. It is intensely inter-
estinc. It tells how the all powerful! secret
forces of nature are controlled and made to
serve the needs of man. The veil which hides
the inner mysteries of Hypnotism, Personal
Maentlsm and Magnetic Healing is drawn I
aside and the real secrets revealed with won- j
derful clearness. You are tcld exactly how to
acquire these mystic influences in a short time
in your own home: how to increase your in-
corr.?: liow to cure disease and bad habits with-
out the use of drugs or medicine; how to con- j
trol the rrinds and actions of those you love; ;
how to make your business pay better; how to i

BERNOTA WINS CROCKER HANDICAP
WITH EONIC THE FAVORITE SECOND
Frank O'Neil, the St. Louis Rider, Scores a Hit With Oakland
Race-Goers â Four Pronounced Choices Bowled Over*
AN old axiom reads: "It Is a lcng
lane that has no turn," and the
fortunes of the Burns & Water
houFe BtaMe, which have been
varying and uncertain since the
inception of the season, took a turn for
the better finally. On Friday, at Oakland,
LJeinota managed to get left at the post,
but yesterday redeemed herself by win
ning the Crocker handicap at six and a
half furlongs, from a small but select field.
Nearly all the handicappers figured the
race a good thing for Eonic, with only
100 pounds on her back, and Caesar
Young's filly was accordingly installed an
even money favorite. Giendenning had
all the worst of it with 110 pounds in the
saudie, and 10 to 1 was quoted about him.
Articulate, allotted top weight, 128 pounds,
had quite a string of followers, and, to be
Â«ure. O'Connor's presence on the back of
Janice attracted attention that way, even
if she was asked to handle 123. Bernota,
in at 9t> pounds, and with Frank O'Neil.
the St. Louis boy, in the saddle, warmed
up through the muddy going like a Tjutch
cr's cleaver parting a square of limbur
gor cheese, and, coupled with Rosenar, 6
to 3 was freely laid against the stable
entry. At the post O'Neil, on Bernota,
handled his horse to perfection and when
tlie barrier was released by Dwyer, was
npht at the heels of Glendenning. The
li. tier's stay in front was extremely brief,
the 2-year-old dropping back before three
furlongs had been covered. Bernota now
hf !d a commanding lead and fortunately,
no doubt, for the brown fellow. Hoar, on
Eonic, was cut off at the far turn by
Glendenning, while trying to steal
through on the rail. This proved
disastrous for the favorite. Losing
three lengths, she' closed fadt
though in the run to the wire, being bea*
en by less than two lengths in I:22â very
fast time when the coniition of the track
Is considered. Janice ran in ahead of Ar
ticulate for the show.
The gross value of the stake was JlsvO.
of which amount the winning horse re
ceived $1200.
Despite the ihreaterJr.g aspect of the
weather there was a large crowd in at
tendance, and the bookmakers were faj Â¦:
ly besieged with coin. The talent received
a fearful Jarrlnjj for four rounds, when
the tide changed, and Wro favorites, Ord
nung and Galanthus, came through on
schedule time.
Link Jackson, the diminutive spider
weight of Dr. Rowells stable, left ihe
maiden jockey class en Darlene in the
opening six-furlong run. Quiz 11, which
came out after a long lay off, led to thr
paddock, where he was collared and beat
en two lengths by the Kowell entry. Can
sor, the favorite, seems to have lost a'l
form, finishing third.
Many were under tne impression that
Spencer on Quadra, favorite for the two
year-old sprint, threw the race away by
one of his "Cornmandu riaes," and it did
look that way. He t truck the stretch
with his mount under lestraint and for a
time did not perceive Lr.rry Daly crawling
up on the outside with Sir Lewis. When
it settled down to a drive the latter won
by a neck. The winner was Bto 1.
The Brutus gelding Duckoy upheld his
title to being a first-o'.ass mudlark by de
feating Greyfeld and Bangor handily in
the mile purse run. Greyfeld, having J.
Woods in the saddle, closed a hot favor
ite. His unruly behavior at the post d:i
not brighten his chances. When sent
away Bullman at once went out In the
lead with Duckoy and was never headel,
winning at the wire by two open length*.
The favorite finished a weary second,
about the same distance ahead of Ban
gor.
Green Morris dropped his good horse
Autolight in at a sprinting distance in
the fifth number. While the brown fel
low gave Ordnung a tussle, he had been
hustled from the jump, something not
down in his daily diet, and the Schorr
crack beat him out. The latter had a
slight call in the betting, and the pair
furnished a pretty and exciting finish.
At the paddock Woods, on Ordnung,
played his trump card, and, drawing
ahead, scored by a length in 1:15, another
fast run.
A barrel of coin went in on Wyoming
to win the last race. The old horse, to
gether with Imperious, faljed to break
with the balance of the field and was left.
Galanthus then went out and made a
runaway race of it. Merops disposed of
Ronnie Lissak for the place.
Track Notes.
Charley Norris, well known as manager
for Barney Schreiber's booking enter
prises, is back In California again.
Frank O'Neil only arrived at the track
yesterday morning. He wafe one of the
best of the lightweights riding at St.
Louis, and his clever handling of Ber
nota at once Installed him a favorite
with the crowd. O'Neil comes here un
der engagement to Walter Jennings.
The two Daly brothers, J. and L,., made
their reappearance in the saddle at Oak
land yesterday after a successful season
East. Larry, on his father's two-year
old. Sir Lewis, beat Spencer, astride
Quadra, a head, and Johnny was sucess
fui In landing Galanthus first. Both lads
have grown considerably, and are now
perfectly at home in the saddle.
Seventeen books cut in. Frank Lauter
man took a rest, and Willie Applegrate
weighed in.
H. J. Crocker, after whom the Crocker
stake was named, waa numbered among
me big crowd of spectators.

ENGLISH RACING SEASON
CLOSES AT MANCHESTER,
LONDON, Nov. 23.â This year's racing,
under Jockey Club rules, was concluded
with - to-days meeting at Manchester,
where the races .were run in such a dense
fog that the judges had difficulty in dis
tingushing the winners. The Americans
failed to score, but Maher ends the sea
son second on the list of winning jockeys
with 94 wins against Maddens 130.
Maher' s percentage of wins, however. Is
23, Maddens 17. J. Reiff Is fourth on the
list with 89 wins. L. Reiff, in spite of his
suspension, is seventh, with 75. Martin
has 43 wins, Jenkins 42 and Thorpe 14.
Carabine won the Manchester Novem
ber handicap of Â£1500, for three-year-olds
and upward, distance one mile and six
furlongs, at the Manchester November
meeting to-day. Blacksand was second
and Rambling Katie finished third.
Twenty horses ran.
Twenty of the most promising- American
Jockeys have made during the season Just
drawing to a close the astonishingly large sum
of $300 000, Bays a special dispatch to the
Enquirer. The division of this $300,000 among
the twenty Jockeys is Interesting, and thÂ«
figures here given may be regarded as ap
proximately icorrect, in some cases, perhaps, a
lesser amount being credited to a Jockey than
actually has been received.
Twelve of the number have bÂ«en the real
stars of the year's racing, six of whom have
been riding in this country and "lx abroad,
in England, Russia and Austria.
The list, with the amount credited to eaoh
Jockey, is as follows:
Jockeys abroadâ Maher, $40,000; J. Reiff, $25,
00; O. "Sloan, $15,000: L. Reiff, $30,000; Taral,
$25,C00; Jenkins, $15,000..
Jockeys in Americaâ Shaw, $25,000; O'Con
nor, $25, COO; Burns, $20,000; Turner, $15,000;
Cochran, $15,000; Wonderly, $10,000.
Of the lesser lights eight who have ridden
prominently throughout the season are as fol
lows: The second divisionâ Bullman, $10,000;
Odom, $8000; Mounce, $6000; Walsh, $4000; Spen
cer, $3000; Michaels, $3000; J. Martin, $3000; J.
Woods, $3000.
I>avid Gideon, the horseman, has won more
money in bets on the turf during the past
season than any two race track plungers. It
has been his most profitable year since his
colt His Highness won the futurity. The book
makers credit him with having got nearly
$150,000 of their money.
STRIKERS MUST
FACE SOLDIERS
Kentucky Miners Con
tinue to Ignore Man
date of Court.
MADISON VILLE, Ky., Nov. 23.â The
striking union miners continue defiant
and remain to-night in their camp near
the Providence coal mine. They hold
that the order of Judge Hall Is illegal and
treat it with contempt. They maintain
that the action of Adjutant General Mur
ray In making the necessary prepara
tions to enforce Judge Hall's order was
unauthoritative.
The strikers are In camp to-night in
greater numbers than before, notwith
standing that the time limit of Judge
Hall's order that the camp should be dis
banded and moved out of the county ex
pired more than twelve hours ago. This
refusal to heed the order of the court is
based upon the advice of W. H. Yost of
Greenville, chief counsel for President
Wood of the United Mine Workers. Yost
and Wood are defiant in their talk and
declare that the court's order was a
farce, Illegal in the extreme and Issued
without authority.
When a correspondent visited the camp
to-day the strikers were eating break
fast. More than 200 were assembled In
the camp, with probably more than a
hundred In the vicinity. There were four
large canvas tents, the lodging capacity
of which is about two hundred. There is
much speculation about the reception the
militia will receive when they march on
the camp to make effective Judge Hall' 3
order. There is no change in Judge Hall's
determination to have his order executed.
This afternoon, after conferring with
General Murray on his return from the
camp, Judge Hall made the following
statement:
"There has been no change in my de
termination to disperse the camp and tne
orders have been given General Murray
so that he may get his forces in readiness
to meet the emergency in such manner
as his discretion may suggest. I would
suppose that the increased number In the
camp, with their continued hostile dem
onstrations, would require great precau
tion in General Murray's preparations, all
of which is left entirely to him and will
necessarily cause some delay."
General Murray began at once the mak
ing of plans for carrying out the orders,
and intimated to-night that he would act
soon. There is a rumor, not confirmed
by General Murray, that the soldiers will
be sent to the camp at 6 o'clock to-mor
row morning, and that in the event the
campers doÂ» not disperse their tents will
be removed and the inmates forced to
disband. The squad of twenty-flve sol
diers stationed at Providence, guarding
the Providence Coal Company's property,
have not been ordered to Madisonville.

EXCITING HANDBALL
GAMES AT OLYMPIC CLUB
Flayers in the Big Tournanwnt Treat
the Spectators to Some
Rare Sport.
The handball tournament at the Olym
pic Club has become extremely interest
ing to the members of that organization.;
Every evening whan contests are in prog
ress the gallery overlooking the big court*
is crowded with clubmen, who delight In
chaffing the players and encouraging
them on to greater endeavors. Last night
Thomas Powers, who is known as the
"Irish champion," handily defeated
"Tom" Kennedy. The former played in
great form and had his opponent guess
ing. Kennedy served to Powers' right
hand, thinking that he, as a left-handed
player, would be unable to return the
ball, but Powers surprised him. Powers
took both games by a score of 21 â 12,
21â15.
Charles Melrose defeated J. Cordes by
a score of 21â12 and 21â8. Cordes has the
making of a good player. He is gradu
ally developing a stroke and uses his left
hand to advantage. He surprised veteran
players by his cleverness. Melrose only
defeated him after the hardest kind of
a struggle. Every point was won after a
long rally.

OPPOSE BAY VIEW FARM

Supervisors Appoint a Committee of
Protestants to Recommend Other
Available Locations.
The Supervisors' Health and "Hospital.
Committee met yesterday to hear protests
Â« against the proposed ordinance authorir
â¢;ie purchase of the Bay View farm
as a site for a pesthouse.
Dr. Vcn Krakau, ' p-esldent of the Bay
View Improvement Club, said that if the
matter was presented to Congress proper
. ly,. provision would be made to send lepers
to some island of the island colonies. He
objected to the location of the institution
It Mi destined to be a fine residence
district, as it Would destroy the future of
that section of the city. Numerous fami
lies had already declared their intention
to remove from the district if the pest
fcouse was built there, he said.
Supervisor Lawrence Dwyer made a plea
for the removal of the pesthouse from the
Mission, saying that as a matter of equity
It should be removed at once.
F. \\\ Dohrmann argued that there
v.ould be no danger if the pesthouse was
in the very heart of the cty. Mr. Dohr
mann recited the history of the present
pestho\is< , stating that it waa built during
the epidemic of 1864, and it was intended
to burn it down, but it still semalned as
â¢a standing disgrace to the city. He
6trong:!y advocated the proposed site in
Br.y View.
It was decided to appoint a committee,,
three protestants and two from the Mer
chants' Association, to recommend sites
of not less than four acres, the committee
to report by December 15. The committee,
co far a-s appointed, consists of Dr. Todd,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1901.
GEARY MAKES SUDDEN DEPARTURE
TO AVOID PERSISTENT POLITICIANS
Would-Be Chinese Exclusion Committeemen, Scenting Possibility of
Free Trip to Washington, Make Rush on Chairman of Late
Convention and Force Him to Flee*
THOMAS J. GEARY, chairman of
the late Chinese Exclusion Con
vention as well as of the executive
committee of that organization,
left the city quietly yesterday af
ternoon and announced that he would not
return until to-morrow, at which time
he promised to name the remaining two
members of the committee of five which
is to go to Washington in the interests of
exclusion.
When Geary accepted the responsibility
of naming- the committee he evidently did
not realize the character of the job on his
hands. He presided at the meeting of the
executive committee Thursday evening at
which Mayor Phelan, Andrew Furuseth,'
secretary â¢of the Sailors' Union, and |
Truxton Beale were chosen as members
of the Washington committee.
This left two members still to be se
lected by Geary, and, as there was some
promise that the expenses of the Junket
ing tour to the national capital might be
paid out of funds to be raised by parties
and societies interested in exclusion, a
rush for the honors resulted. Pressure
was brought to bear upon Geary to ap
point this and that man, and so pressing
were the applicants that Geary resolved
to hiÂ« himself to the country, where he
might think the matter over. On his re
turn to-morrow his selections will be an
nounced to the committee.
The convention authorized the commit
tee to appoint a secretary for the Wash
ington committee and to fix his salary,
the same to date from the time of his ap
pointment. Those of the executive com
mittee who were prominently identified
with labor politics during the canfpaign
took the matter in hand yesterday, and
John McLaughlin, secretary of the Broth
erhood of Teamsters, was selected for
SENATOR SIMS
IS IGNORED
Democratic Tactics in
Chinese Exclusion
Convention.
There was no open attempt on the part
of Democratic politicians who were prom
inent In the Chinese Exclusion Con
vention to outgeneral the Republicans. It
was observed at the outset that the Re
publicans were prepared to take care of
themselves. In the Democratic camp
there was active effort . to send some of
the leaders t,o the front and keep others
in the rear. The programmers managed
early in the convention to sidetrack J. C.
Sims, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, and keep him on i*ne
siding until near the hour of adjourn
ment. It is surmised that Senator Sims
has aspirations for Democratic leadership
In 1902 and might easily win the nomina
tion of his party for Governor. Perhaps
Sims was turned down by the program
mers to give Geary a boost, but what
! ever the reason the slight did not escape
the notice of Senator Sims' personal and
political friends. They regret that grat
ification of small animosities and petty
prejudices were permitted to mar the con
vention.
Samuel M. Shortridge was excluded
from prominence in the convention at the
i suggestion of the yellow press. This was
I regrettable, for Mr. Shortridge's record
as an advocate of Chinese exclusion Is
well established and his ability as an or
ator Is widely recognized. The yellow
newspaper in San Francisco, which fur
nished some of the Democratic hustlers
with a programme, has a real or imag
inary grievance against Shortridge.
Ex-Governor Budd Outplays Mayor.
In the little linesse of skilled politicians
ex-Governor Budd outplayed Mayor Phe
lan, although the latter had the advantage
| tage of position. The Republicans, who
were closely watching the play, noted
the skill of the ex-Governor. Mayor Sny
der of Los Angeles did not lose a trick.
There is no doubt that a majority cf
citizens comprising the convention haÂ«\
in view the extensirn of the exclusion
act, but It is a well-known fact that oth
ers who sought special prominence hau
In mind political advantage.
The Republicans In t.ic convention took
a broad and patriotic view of the quep
tion. They did not ?.o ip with knives
sharpened to do up ono another, but thÂ«y
were wary of their political opponents and
have no cause to .regret th<'ir vigilance.
; It cannot be said that either party gained
j special advantage In the counc'l of de
! liberation. It is a source of regret, hov
j ever, that an occasion of so much con
cern to California shojVl have been used
by Democratic cliques and factions to se
cretly gratify a spirit ol resentment. Af
! ter all, the convention has not advanced
j any aspirant's chance lor gubernatorial
or congressional honors, and if It has not
added much to the store of wisdom on
the main proposition to exclude the Chi
nese from competition with white laboi
it has done no harm to the cause of ex
clusion.
The yellow press announcement that
' Shortridge was given a .back seat among
the silent because he has Chinese clients
is the most amusing statement of the
season, when it is cono'dered that Geary,
the chairman of the convention, has hvi
more than his share of the business In
landing Chinese in California.
Their Chinese Landing Records.
The Mongolian business which Short
ridge holds or has ever held is a mere
trifle compared with Goary's patronage ir
tire same line. If ali the Chinaman
brought aehore by Geary were placed~tn
column and procession might extend from
the Federal courthoupa to Sullivan's al
ley, in Chinatown.
Duncan E. McKlnlay, who was an elo
quent speaker 'n the convention, has had
more Chinese clients than Shortridge
ever had. Gearj\ however, has had
the cream of the business. When the
State campaign gets 1 airly under wa/
The Call will gratify the curious publ'3
by presenting Federal court statistics
showing the number of Chinese cases to
the credit of every lawyer-politician. The
number landed can then be compared
with the number they are likely to ex
elude. Of course, the-o Is nothing po Â¦
litical in this comment. It happens that
the Republican lawyers are almost as en
terprising as their Democratic brother*
at the bar in pursuit of Chinese clients,
but the people may want to know if the
Republicans can produce a lawyer who
can match Geary In the special field of
landing Chinese under the color of the
law. Perhaps olg politicians belonging to
the Democratic National Committee may
organize steamship lines and transfer
coolies from China to Mexico, so that the
Chinese may get to California through
the back door, but such admission would
not be lawful.
BOLLEBBVILLE. Ohio. Nov. 23.â A gang of
five robbera blew open the poetofflce safe herÂ©
laet night and secured $300 worth of stamps and
$60. besides fund* belonging to tha local lodge
of M&ccabee*
the* place. Although McLaughlin's selec
tion for this responsible position was not
definitely admitted, it is certain that he
is the man, and that his selection will be
formally announced to-morrow.
Eiscuss Salary Question.
The question of McLaughlin's salary
was discussed by the members of the
executive committee, but no conclusion
i.as been reached. Some of his partisans
are seeking to have the figure fixed at $250
a month, and it is likely that this sum
will be allowed. The expenses of the
Washington committee will probably be
partly met by contributions from the va
rious unions of this city. It was reported
yesterday that an appeal to the labor or
ganizations to this effect was in prepara
tion, but this statement could not be
verified.
Now that the convention is a thing of
the past some of the incidents of the
gathering which were kept quiet for po
litical purposes, as it appears, are grad
ually creeping: to the surface. Whether
or not the convention was called more in
the interests of certain Individuals who
have political aspirations than of the peo
ple at large remains to be eeen. Why it
was necessary to mutilate telegrams to
the convention in order to mislead the
delegates as to certain prevailing condi
tions Is a matter that Is puzzling all
who attended the sessions of the gather-
Ing. That a telegram was mutilated by
Chairman Geary or on his order there is
documentary evidence. The telegram was
from Congressman J. C. Needham, and
In its entirety was as follows:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21, 3001.â Hon. James
r>. Phelan, San Francisco: I have seen the
President. Have best authority fcr saying that
he will not only recommend in his, message
the re-enactment of the Geary law, but will
go further and urge that it be made stronger.

. I predict that the law will be re-enacted by
I practically unanimous vote In both houses of
Congress. J. C. NEEDHAM.
When Mayor Phelan received this tele
gram he turned it over to the secretary
of the convention, who had several copies
struck off for the press. These cople3
were submitted to Chairman Geary prior
to the reading of the dispatch to the con
vention, and when they were furnished to
the reporters the words, "I predict that
the law will be re-enacted by practically
unanimous vote in both houses of Con
gress," had been stricken out by pencil.
The telegram in its abbreviated form was
then read to the delegates and received
with great applause.
Why it was deemed wise to cut out the
prediction of Congressman Needham Is
a secret buried in Geary's breast. He
may have thought that Needham's pre
diction, coming as it did from a man on
the field and occupying a position which
rendered his opinion one of value, was
both superfluous and harmful. To those
who are trying to solve the enigma it
has been suggested that the publication of
Needham's prediction, based upon an in
timate knowledge of the real situation,
might have had the effect of convincing
some of the non-Dolitical delegates that
the necessity for a protracted fight did
not exist.
This view once firmly grounded, those
of the convention who are seeking to
make Chinese exclusion a vehicle in
which to ride Into political offices might
find themselves In the position of the man
who had to go way back and sit down.
Whatever the reason for the cutting of
Needham's telegram by Geary may have
been, it is certain that the act is occa
sioning considerable gossip, and there are
many who declare that it is up to Geary
to make some sort of explanation.
NEGRO SHOOTS
TWO PERSONS
Row on Pacific Street
Ends in Serious
Manner.
Thomas J. Gibbs, a negro, shot James
Wilson and George Tyler, the former a
negro and the latter a Portuguese, dur
ing a fight in the Surprise saloon, 429 Pa
cific street, last night. A bullet struck
Wilson on the left breast, causing a su
perficial wound. Tyler was shot through
the left wrist. The trouble grew indi
rectly out of the recent strike.
Gibbs and another negro named Wynn
Smith came to the coast from Cincinnati
last summer and went to work on the
water front in the places of striking
stevedores. When the strike was over
both were thrown out of employment,
and when Smith needed money Gibbs
loaned him a dollar. Since the loan was
made Gibbs has become poverty-stricken,
and Smith, although a debtor, wore an
air of prosperity. Both met last night,
and Gibbs reminded Smith of his obli
gation.
"Funny," he said, "you can wear neck
ties and I have to go around hungry."
Thereupon Smith, instead of producing
the dollar, hurled a large cobblestone at
Gibbs' head, knocking the latter to the
floor. The bartender of the saloon, James
Wilson, then took a hand and attempted
to eject Gibbs. The last named resisted,
and drawing a revolver fired four shots.
One struck Wilson, another hit Tyler,
who was a spectator and who took no
part in the Quarrel, and the others were
imbedded in the wall.
The injured men were treated at the
Harbor Hospital. Gibbs tried to escape
after he did the shooting, but was cap
tured after a long chase by Officers Al
Holmes and Bob Skain.

BOLD BURGLARS
STEAL JEWELRY
A Washington Street
House Loses Heavily
by Crcok's Visit.
Burglars entered the Jewelry store con
ducted by Sam Cohan at 601^ Washington
street early yesterday morning and took
coin and valuables amounting to $500.
This is the third burglary on police rec
ords that has happened in this store
within one year.
When Cohan came to his place of busi
ness early yesterday morning he was sur
prised to find that the door of the place
was open, the lock having been pried off.
A small Jimmy with which the Job was
done lay Inside on the floor.
Cohan rushed to the Central police sta
tion and officers accompanied him to
Washington street while he made an in
vestigation. Cohan found that $100 in
gold coin had been taken and rings,
precious stones and watches valued at
$400 were missing. All these were secured
in a small drawer, which was also pried
open with the Jimmy.
Cohan has lost over $2000 during the
past year on account Of the visits of
burglars. On two other occasions money
and valuables were stolen, and the police
believe the same thieves committed the
three crimes.

CUT THEIR WHY
TO THE MONEY
Unusually Bold Robbery
at Stone's Shipbuild
ing Yard.
â¢fcueves Secure $1050 Left by
the Bookkeeper in the
* Office.
A cleverly executed robbery, resembling
in many respects the rifling of the strong
box of the Selby Smelting Works, for
â¢which Theodore Winters is now serving a
long sentence in the penitentiary, was
committed between 4 and 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon at W. F. Stone's ship
building yard at the foot of Baker street.
The robbers secured $1050. They had
cut a hole in the floor and during the
temporary absence of Al Hannify, the
bookkeeper, crawled through the aperture
and helped themselves *o the money.
A young man named Ericksou, who is
employed at the yard, is under arrest on
suspicion of knowing something of the
robbery.
During the forenoon Hannify went to
the bank and drew $1050, which was to be
used in paying off the men. After return
ing to the office of his employer he placed
the money In thirty- two envelopes, rep-
Liag the number of men employed
Â«.t the ship yards. Shortly after 4 o'clock
Hannify, after placing the envelopes with
their precious contents on a small table
in the office, locked the door and went to
ge some gold.
f :. his return, about twenty minutes
he was dumfounded to find that
the envelopes had disappeared. An ex
;tion showed that the robbers had
cut a large hole in the floor and covered
It wiih a piece of canvas which they had
found in the office. They then waited for
a chance to enter and steal the money
lo be used in payir.p off the employes.
Hannily is satisfied that at least one
cf the robbers was employed In the yard
was thoroughly familiar with the
premises.
After notifying his employer of the rob
bery Hannify -went in search of the rob
bers. Seeir.g Erickson and two other
young men hurrying from the scene he
pave chase and overhauled the former.
Erickson, when questioned, denied that he
kr.ew anyihii-g- about the theft. He
claimed that he was not acquainted with
The two men who were with him and said
he had met them accidentally. Despite
-otestations of innocence he was ar
rested by Police Officer Tierney and
J up pending further Investigation.
Detective Crockett, who was detailed on
the case by Captain Seymour, is anxious
ly searching for the men who were seen
with Erickson. Both Crockett and Han
r.:fy are satisfied that the hole in the
Coor was made severs! days ago.
I-SOJT TRADES COUNCIL
ISSUES A STATEMENT
Declares That Strike Is Not Settled
and Two-Thirds of the Men
Are Still Out.
The following statement has been is
sued by the Iron Trades Council relating
to the present situation in the iron trades
strike:
The Iron Trades Council of San Francisco
desires to pl&ce the reading public right -with
reference to the situation or the iron trades'
etr.ke. which has been on since May 20, ISOL
lor <he introduction of the shorter work day
Articles have appeared in the daily press
from time to time, which would lead you to In
fer that the Iron trades' strike had been ad
justed end that the men were nearly ail at
work, and that all that remained to be done
was to gather up the fragments and straighten
them out and the Iron trades' strike would be
a thing of the past.
We desire to inform you that while we have
made adjustments with several of the smaller
employers of iron workers and some of the
men have returned to work, that about two
thirds of the men Â¦who went out on May 20
1301, are still on strike, despite all other re
ports to the contrary.
The conditions of settlement under which
the men have returned to work have been the
granting of the nine-hour day, with the over
time to commence after nine hours have been
worked, an Increase of wages ranging from
13 per cent to 7 per cent and the reinstatement
of all old employes.
We are gratified to be able to state that
we have succeeded In convincing some of the
.firms heretofore connected with the Metal
-J^rades Association of the Justice of our re
quests, and In our judgment they are much
happier and contented, and we can assure you
beyond possibility of doubt their employes are
aJso. under the new order of things.
We have yet to make a settlement with some
eight or nine firms. They seem to abhor trade
unions. We refrain from making any per
for.ai reference, as they are well known by
their actions.
We are daily receiving encouragement from
gentlemen high In the nation* council and we
realize that we must concentrate our power
and use every weapon at our command to
force those firms to treat us with some degree
of justice. >'
Â¦We re aware that wealth Is a power but
rest assured we have counted the cost before
Â¦we embarked in this struggle and we believe
In the language of the lamented Abraham Lin
coln when he -stated in his inaugural address
â¢Wealth tl great, but labor is greater than
wealth, ita creator." History keeps on repeat-
Ing. Etlll come are so blind they cannot see
and when they awake from their lethargy they
may come to their -senses and realize that wage
earners have - me rights.
To the ware workers in the North. South and
far away East: We wish you to remember
/ that the strike of the ironworkers of the Pa
cific Coast Is Â¦â¢ I oil all reports of the Metal
Trades Association to the contrary notwith-
Etanding. Â¦ . *
In conclusion we earnestly request men in
the Iron trades to pay no attention to adver
tisements and clrcnlars. as all such matter is
unreliable, and when the strike Is over an
official notice of the facts d!] be made public
By order of the Iron Trades Council.

Creations.
MANAGER GRAU Is indeed hav
ing a trying time in endeavor
ing to carry out his programme
for the present grand opera sea
son. Everything that enterprise
and expense could furnish to
the public of San Francisco in the way of
musical entertainment has been given in
lavish manner, but. as far as the pres
ent season is concerned, "man proposes
and the weather disposes."
The vagaries of the climate of San
I Francisco have played sad pranks with
the vocal organs of thÂ© stars of Manager
Grau's combination of singers.
"When the season opened the public
learned with deep regrat that the famous
diva. Calve, would not be able to appear
as scheduled. There was a change in the
order of operas, and that is a difficult
task for the operatic manager. / Under
studies have to be located, rehearsals
called and a hundred worries are gone
through that the public little dreams of.
The non-appearance of Calve during the
first week of the season cost Manager
Grau thousands of dollars, but he bore the
blow with fortitude.
Well, the Calve did appear last Wednes
day night, and when the patrons of grand
opera looked for another enjoyable per
formance on last Friday night, lo and
behold! the diva had overtaxed her
strength and was forced to leave for
Southern California for a vacation.
Then Sybil Sanderson, who was to have
sung to-night in "Les Huguenots," caught
cold and another name was added to the
sick list.
Yesterday the musical public and so
ciety of this city were to hear Mme.
Eames in the afternoon in "Lohengrin"
and Mme.. Sembrich in the evening in "II
Barbiere dl Siviglia."
Again luck was against Manager Grau,
and just at the time that a vast audience
was being seated for the matinee per
formance word was sent to Grau by Mme.
Eames that she would be unable to sing
in "Lohengrin." *
The great songstress had broken one of
| her rules by visiting Chinatown on the
day before she was to sing. Mrai Eames
herself haÂ» said that on the day previous
to her appearance she never leaves her
room and rests her voice by not engaging
in conversation.
The diva caught- a slight cold on Fri
day and has paid dearly for her temer
ity in going near the city's unsavory-
Oriental cuarter. She lost the large sal
ary, runnine Into four "figures, that she
receives from Grau each time she sings
in public.
Mme. Louis=e Reuss-Belce gallantly of
i fered to fl!l the breach caused by the ln
' disposition of Mme. Eames. She sang
j the role of El?a before a house that was
i enormous in its proportions. Hundreds of
expensively gowned women had waited in
line before the Grand Opera-house yester
| day afternoon, eager to pay $2 each for
the privilege of securing "stanfiiiig room"
in the theater and hearing "Lohengrin"
with Mme. Eames in the cast.
Audience Is Good-Natured.
When they entered the theater they
read the little slips in the programmes
j that the diva could not appear and that
Mme. Reuss-Belce would sing the role of
Elsa.
The San Francisco patrons of the grand
opera take the unavoidable indispositions
of the singers with good grace.
Yesterday afternoon not a single re
quest was made at the box office of the
Grand Ot>era-house for money to be re
funded because Eames was not In the
cast. Manager Grau was ready to return
j money for tickets, but he was not called
| upon to do so.
"It's too bad that he has such bad
luck," was the general comment heard in
the theater yesterday afternoon, "but we
will have our moneys worth anyway in
the performance of 'Lohengrin.' "
And the big matinee audience indeed
did get its moneys worth, for Madame
Reuss-Belce gave a performance of Elsa
that won the hearts of every one in the
audience. The great cast of singers that
presented the Wagner opera received en
-thusiastic receptions at the end of each
act, and Damrosch and his orchestra
came in for an ovation.
"We did not hear Eames, but we heard
a grand production of the opera," was
the general sentiment as the matinee
audience wended its way out of the the
ater.
Esmbrich Greeted by Society.
Society was present in full force last
night, when Rossini's charming comic

was a large attendance of both sexes and
the programme presented was received
Â¦with gTeat favor.
Jeremiah Deasy, a member of the execu
tive committee, was chairman of the
e\ening. He delivered a short address of
welcome, after which the officers elected
were installed. The newly elected officers
delivered short speeches.
The Rev. Father Michael J. Clifford,
president-elect of the society, in response
to the call of the audience, sang in Gaelic
a barytone solo, "The Colleen Dhas
Crinthin Na Mo," which was received
with applause. A Gaelic address, by J. P.
Hagerty, and a Gaelic song by Jeremiah
Deasy, followed. Remarks were- made by
the Rev. Richard Collins and Theodore

HUMOR THAT CALVE HAS
THROAT CANCER DENIED
Dr. Grant Selfridge Says Report to
That Effect From Los Angeles
Is Untrue.
A dispatch from Los Angeles last night
stated that it had been discovered that
the true malady from which Calve, the
great opera, slr.rer, was suffering wis
cancer of the throat. Calve is now in the
southland for the bene-'it of her health.
Dr. Grant SeWridge, who was one of
Calves physicians while she was in this
city, denies the cancer story. The doctor
said:
"Calves condition now, or at least when
I saw her last, was much better than
when phe arrived in the city. Her ailment
is diffuse bronchitis. Shortly after her
arrival I was called upon to examine her
throat. This I did, and found her vocal
chords to be as perfect as any I ever saw
in my life. The cancer story is absolutely
unfounded. The night she appeared in
'Carmen' she evidently caught more
cold, which caused a recurrence of the
bronchitis. With a little rest in a warm
climate she will soon be in good health
again, her illness by no means being of
a permanent or serious nature."
Skull May Be Fractured.
Elmer Waters, an employe of the
Chutes, living at 141 Ferry street, while

collided with an Oak street car at the
corner of Oak and Stanyan streets. He

is believed he sustained a fracture of the
skull.

John Boyle and John Comerford were

DEBUTANTE
MAKES HER
FORMAL BOW
Miss Anna Foster, the prepossessing
daughter of Mrs. A. W. Foster, made her
debut into society at a tea given in hsr
honor in the Century Hall yesterday af
ternoon. The rooms of the organization
were crowded with friends of the young
lady and a delightful afternoon was
spent. Miss Foster was the recipient of
many handsome floral tributes from her
Ulends.
Refreshments were served and the
guests were treated to beautiful music,
rendered by an orchestra. The clubrooms
were prettily decorated with potted
plants, flowers and greens.
Mrs. Foster and her daughter were as
sisted in receiving by the following
named: Miss Alma McClung, Miss Elea
nor Morrow, Miss Mary Foster, Miss
Alice Wilklns, Mifas Louise Crosby, Miss
Cornelia Scott, Miss Virginia Nokes, Miss

who will take a prominent part in society
functions during the season.
Criminals Sentenced.
John Cosby, who was convicted of an
assault with a deadly weapon, was sent
to the County Jail for nine months by
Judge Dunne yesterday. W. D. Thomp-
Bon was sent to the same place for eight

guilty to a charge of grand larceny some
time ago, withdrew his plea and pleaded
guilty to three different charges of petty
larceny. Judge Dunne gave him six
months on each charge

and Scotti will be heard in the opera,
and if the theater is not packed to the
doors it will not be the fault of Grau.
To-morrow night "Faust" is to be
given, with Madame Eames in the cast,
and the evening is sure to be a "society
event."
Tuesday evening "Die Walkure" is to

HIGH-PRICED ENGINEER
LOSES HIS LAWSUIT
Herbert Lang Contradicted Under
Oath by Manager Daily of Cop
per King Company.
In the suit of W. E. Dean vs. W. H.
Daily and the Copper King Mining Com
pany United States Circuit Judge Mor
row rendered judgment yesterday in fa
vor of the plaintiff for $230.
The case was transferred from the Su
perior Court of Alameda County to the
United States Circuit Court. Daily being
a citizen of Maryland and the copper
company being a corporation under th?
laws of the State of New Jersey. Dean
is the assignee of Herbert Lang, who
sued to recover $2220 50 for services as
consulting engineer at a salary of $500 per
month and for moneys advanced to em
ployes at the request of the defendant.
Lang went on the stand in the Circuit
Court and swore that Daily had hired
him under a verbal contract at the salary
of $500 per month. Daily flatly denied this
statement.
Judge Morrow remarked that it did not
appear that any meeting of the company
had ever been held to take notice of the
alleged contract, and on the point as to
whether there was or was not such a con
tract the evidence was evenly balanced.
Judgment was rendered for $200 for
plans and specifications for a blasting
furnace and for $30 for draughtsmen, the
defendant not contesting that part of the
claim.

A MORE piquant contrast than the
afternoon and evening bills of
yesterday at the Grand Opera
house could hardly be imagined,
"Lohengrin" for the afternoon
fare and "II Barbiere di Siviglia" in the
evening. Neither suffered, it is unneces
sary to say, and the merry masterpiece
of Rossini was to the full as much en-
Joyed as the beauties of "Lohengrin"â
nay, more, for it was a surpassing per
formance. It was sung to the last inch
of efficiency last night, and its merry
drollery interpreted in a fashion that set
the whole house shaking to most ungodly
and un-grand-operatic laughter. It was
another red-letter night all through, and
the days to come will be brighter and
merrier until its last mercurial echo shall
have died away. One month the opera
took to write, and it sounds that way â
gay, spontaneous, arch and unaffected,
and the whole cast and orchestra last
night combined to give to the full its
sprightly and scintillant grace.
Who shall choose among so many gtars
of equal light? Each part was taken Just
as it should be, and each as perfectly fit
ted to its neighbor as the suave and con
genial sardines in their scanty boxes.
However, ladies first, and Sembrich, the
glorious, at your pleasure.
Perhaps Mme. Sembrich's was not, by
the shade of a shade, quite the victorious
note of her Susanna last Tuesday night,
but who cares when it was a consum
mately beautiful achievement even so?
From the standpoint of vocalism pure and
simple, Mme. Sembrich is unapproachable.
There is no question of this â her absolute
mastery of all technical material, the
phrasing, nuance, color, the incomparable
voice itself, all stamp her as the most
beautiful singer now before us. Rosina
fits her like the pitcher fits the milk, its
gay coquetry and arch dialogue drawing
out the best she has to give. Of course the
"lesson scene" was the vocal climax of
her work, and the diva gave the effective
coloratura composition of Johann Strauss,
"Voce di Primavera," composed especially
for her, to begin with.
As encore she gave an aria from "San
nambula," and as encore to that a grace
ful little Chopin song, to her own ac
companiment on the anachronistic piano
that was cast for a turn in the lesson
scene. Still the entranced audience was
not satisfied, and with the orchestra
Mme. Sembrlch then gave a quaint and
tender little lullaby that showed her as
consummately satisfying in simple mel
ody as in all the vocal fireworks she
makes so beautiful, and left the audi
ence, to a man, her humble slaves.
Salignac â the tenor follows the lady,
naturallyâ shone last night in the florid
opportunities of Almaviva's part. He
looked very picturesque as the amorous
Count, and acted with irresistible gayety
and ease. The part suited him admira
bly, too, so far as the voice goes, and he
sang its, florid measures with power,
flexibility and sweetness. Neither is he
lacking in the necessary humor, and in
the "tipsy"' scene showed a rich fund of
it, together with an artistic restraint that
offered a very worthy measure of appre
ciation of the tenor's high capacities.
But De Reszke! He was the Don Basilio,
and the house laughed till It cried at the
radiantly absurd drollery of the concep
tion. De Reszke's superb proportions add
unspeakably to the fun of it. He is a
starched and pompous pedant, a coward
and a busybody, and the scene where
Almaviva has him at sword's point,
sneaking around the furniture and behind
the tiny Bertha for protection, is as irre
sistible in the remembrance as it was on
sight. And De Reszke seemed to get as
much fun out of it as anybody, all of the
singers appeared to be enjoying them
selves for the matter of that. Of course
he was, as usual, eminently satisfying
from a vocal standpoint.
Campanari was the Figaro, and a spirit
ed and brUlÂ»ant figure. The "Figaro"
song was jpven with all its robust jollity
and waggish suggestion, and Campanari's
excellent vocal equipment was never more
thoroughly in evidence than in his work
last night. He was thoroughly enjoyed
by the audience. Bartolo, done by Ta
vecchia, was another creation of the clev
erest. Tavecchia shows all the pompous,
heavy vanity of the creature, and sings
the droll music in infectious fashion, with
a pleasing and powerful voice.
The orchestra was at its best under Sep
pllli, the few choruses were well sung,
and altogether the night is a memorable
one.
The fatal coincidence of the large sal
ary habit and throat trouble has again
been forced unwelcomely upon the public
attention down at the Grand Opera
house. This time it was Eames who dis
appointed her audience. She was billed
for Elsa in "Lohengrin" yesterday after
noon, but at the last moment developed
"indisposition," and her place had to be
taken by Mme. Reuss-Belce.
At the little Tivoli, with salaries atâ
well, not $1000 or $1500 a performance, the
singers seemed always to have their
throats with them. In a twelve weeks'
season the bill was never once changed,
and, with the exception of Montanari,
every singer sung when billed to appear.
Collamarini sung with a face half again
its usual pi#np proportions from tooth
ache, and a small matter of a cold or
such never seemed to prevent the singers
from coming up to time. It is of course
different where' throats are worth $1500
a night, but it is a curious contrast just
the same.
Any performance of "Lohengrin" with
Schumann-Heink in the cast is worth the
price for her work alone. She was in
magnificent trim yesterday afternoon
she always isâ singing with all the splen
did vigor and sweetness that distin
guish her work. The voice is a perfect
one, vital, golden, thrilling. It sounds
every note in the garnet of human pas
sion and suits the Wagner moods to the
last necessity. Her XDrtrud is her best op
portunity, and Schumann-Heink in the
role ranks with the most important fig
ures of the season.
Bispham started rather sleepily yester
day as Telramund, but soon woke up to
his work. His sympathetic voice is al
ways a delight, and his many-sided art"
makes of the figure a strong and con
sistent personality. Van Dyck flatted
painfully in "Mem lieber Schwan, " but
later roused to pitch and power, though
he did not seem to be in as good form as
usual.
Mme. Reuss-Belce, who substituted for
Mme. Eames, filled in the part not un
acceptably and in places with taste and.
power. But her voice lacks sweetness,
breadth, and in the fortes betrays not a
little harshness. Mr. Muhlmann was thi?
Herald, and Mr. Blass the King, both
with their usual ample success, and Mr.
Damrosch and the orchestra did their
duty nobly.

The run-down of the open stake yester
day at Union Coursing Park resulted In
well contested trials. Every course w.i:
decided on merit, and not a single "unde

noon. An exceptional'}- strong lot of
hares helped make the going interesting.
Â¦ Considering the unlooked for lorg
courses, the favorite players had a good
day and won twenty-two of the thirty
two chances. One of the day's features
was the clever work of W. H. Robinson's

Four of the titter were entered in the

Lord Freedom beating Melrose Girl, Pat
Freedom outpointing Alameda Lad at 1
to 2 and Bessie Freedom outworking
Might Be Keen in a long course at 3 to 5.
Slipper Jim Grace aided to his record

hare that had speed tÂ«> spare worked the
hounds almost to a standstill, and proved
even a match for two relief dogs that

lot in the open the hare sought the home
escape. As It passed the slipper's box
young Grace by a dexterous move caught
the hare and threw It over the fence. In
the last course of the uay the slipper re

All the scoring was done in the first

series of fumbles, Berkeley's fullback
punted the ball high !n the air, putting
Plummer on side. Plummer carried the
ball for a touchdown, and Kerns kicked

play that saved the day for Lowell.
Vosburgh was the particular bright star
of the day. On Lowell's 45-yard line
Berkeley fumbled the ball, which bounded
into the hands of Vosburgh. Organizing
interference in phalanx formation, his
men protected him yard after yard until
the goal line was reached. For 65 yards
he ran right along the side line. Hamil
ton kicked a very difficult goal.
The second half was full of delays, the
weaker Lowell team making a game de
fense whenever their goal was in great
danger.
The tie game leaves the academic
championship undecided. Lowell and
Berkeley were the two contestants for
championship honors, and another game
will be played. Were It not for the many
fumbles a different story might have
been told.

was small.
The first heat was between the sopho

rowed by the freshmen. At the finish the
sophomores were two lengths ahead. In
the second heat the juniors, in the Ariel
boat, with 10 seconds handicap, won over
the senior crew by one and a half boat
lengths. In the final the juniors rowed
the Ariel boat, but were soon overtaken
by the sophomores, who won handily.

WASPS SHUT OUT
BY THE CRIPPLES
Apparently Unable to
Hit Pitcher Hodson
Safely.
Three Scattered Singles the
Best Uncle's Heavy Bat
ters Can Do.
The San Franciscos were shut out yes
terday at Recreation Park by the Oak
land cripples, the score reading 4 to 0.
Uncle's men apparently could not and
certainly did not hit in keeping with their
usual success. Three singles in as many
different innings proved the net result of
their efforts. The Oaklands proved more
successful, getting four in the sixth inn
ing, which netted them three runs.
Oakland started well, sending Francks
home In the first inning. He singled and
went to third on Graham's overthrow.
Streib hit to Krug, who juggled it long
enough to permit Francks to get home.
In the sixth inning Dunleavy hit to
right field, and with a full head of steam
on finally landed at third base just ahead
of the ball. Streib was safe on Whalen's
fumble. Eagan sent a hot one just in
side the right field foul line that was
good for two bags. Dunleavy scored on
the hit. Babbitt hit toward first. Gra
ham fumbled the- ball, leaving Babbitt
safe, while Streib scored. Eagan scored
on Hamilton's single. Hanson sacrificed.
Hodson singled and Babbitt wns caught
out at the plate on the play. Mohler flew
out, retiring the side. That ended the
run-getting. The score:

OVERWHELMING DEFEAT FOR YALE
IS ADMINISTERED BY HARVARD
Superb Football Machinery of the Crimson Eleven Runs Up Score of
v 22 to 0 for Wearers of the Blue*
SOLDIERS' FIELD, Mass, Nov. 23.
â Vengeance never sweeter and
victory never more decisive,
cajne to Harvard this afternoon
when her football eleven defeat
ed Yale, 22 to 0. Three touchdowns, two
of which were converted Into goals, and^
a gcal from the field, of brilliant execif
ton, were Harvard's portion. For Tale
there was nothing but a whitewash.
The Harvard men required about five |
minutes In which to start their superb
football machinery. After that Yale was
never in the playing. In scrimmages, i
tackles, line-plunging, hurdling, punting
and drop-kicking, the Yale men were com- j
pktely outclassed. The Harvard players
gave also a demonstration of uniform play
that was remarkable, and as a result the
clcrs of the crimson waved in delirious
joy during the greater portion of the two
hours occupied by the contest.
Thirty-six thousand spectators, a great
er number than ever before gathered at a
football game, watched the crimson battle
from the mammoth stands. Three-quar
ters of the enormous crowd cheered Har
vard, while 9000 sympathizers tried to en
courage the overwhelmed wearers of the
blue.
Harvard presented a team the personnel
of which was unchanged from start to
finish. The players who thus won glory
for the crimson were almost as full of
dash when the referee's whistle sounded
for the last time as they were when it
sounded for the opening kick-off. Yale,
en the other hand, required sixteen men
to meet the onslaught of the Harvard
plunges. Panic came to Yale and sympa
thy went out to Yale from the Harvard
thousands when the crack quarter-back,
De Saulles, as a result of a flying tack'e.
vhich prevented another .Harvard score,
was hurt. A blow on the head made him
unconscious. Later it became necessary
to remove him from the field on a stretch
er. As the game progressed Weymouth, ]
Cl.adwick, Hamlln and Gould were com
pelled to retire in favor of substitutes.
Cleanly Flayed Game.
The game was as cleanly played as any
ever witnessed on this field. Not one in
stance of slugging nor unnecessary rough
ness was visible. Three penalties were
imposed by Umpire McClung. Harvard,
from the overanxiety cf her players,
thrice lost their yards of distance, for
holding, off-side play and interference.
Harvard scored seventeen of her twenty
two points in the first half. In the flrgt
half Harvard resorte.l more often to purg
ing. Yale played much better football in
the second half, and Harvard had to be
satisfied with a touchdown which failed
to a goal. Harvard after the first five
minutes of the game liad possession of |
the ball the greater portion of the time
Her goal line was really never in danger
Once in the first halC Yale landed thi
ball on Harvard's twenty-yard line
where Harvard forcel De Saulles to try
for a goal from the field. He failed. In
the' second half Yale, "or the fiercest play,
reached the nine-yari line, only to los<".
the ball on downs. The crimson s
weightier lines and faster back field
worked out the touchdown in the second
half, but Cutts could r.ot make the goal
against the wind.
The general feeling of the Harvard
coaches and players was one of surprise
at Yale's weakness and satisfaction at
Harvard's strong defense. Coach Rsil
said after the game:
"It was due to the fighting spirit; every
man on the team had it in him, and they
came to the scratch in great shape. I
had confidence in them and they came up
to my expectations. Every man played
the whole game for all he was worth."
Captain Campbell said: "The game
spoke for itself. All 1 have to say is that
when the university backs up a team a3
it has this one it will nlways win."
Yale Men Despondent.
Not a Harvn-d man was seriously in
jured. Kcman's sprained ankle was
strained a little and 'Jutts had his knee
sliprhtly hurt, but the rest of the men
fhowed no effects bey.vid a few scratches
and black eyes.
The Yale men were despondent and took
their defeat hard. There were many who
limped badly. De Saulles was the worst
injured. He was kicked on the head and
it was thought at first he had concussion
of the brain.
The Harvard students after their cele
bration on the field marched around the
college yard, cheering and singing. Red
fire was burned on every side and fire
works were set off. Finally most of the
men started for Boston to finish their
demonstration.
The officials were;
T'mpire â Paul Dashiel, Naval Academy.
Refereeâ Matthew A. McClung, Lehigh.
Linemenâ J. A. Smith, Harvard; W. T.
Bull. Yale.
BOSTON, Nov. 23.â The wild scenes on
SoMiers' Field were repeated upon the
streets of Boston to-night, chiefly in the
south end, by the exuberant Harvard un
dergraduates, reinforced by hundreds of
friends who never saw the inside of the
University's classic halls. Street fight 3 be
came frequent and big squads of police
were sent out to keep order. Arrests were
numerous, but a police official said the
street affrays generally did not involve
students, but rather others who had ac
cepted of too much hospitality. Nearly all
the hotels were noisy places, for students
gathered to celebrate. Several of the the
aters were given up to student audiences.
It is years since Harvard has had sucn
an opportunity to celebrate as to-night,
and the lost time was fully made up.
De Saulles, the Yale quarterback, was
reported by Manager Francis to be all
right at 11:30 to-night. He said De Saulles
hac! the wind kicked out of him. This was
followed by severe nausea, which for
some hours made his case look bad. He
recovered rapidly, anfl while yet in the
hospital, will be as well in the morning as
the reÂ«st of the team.
INDIANS PLAY TIE GAME.
Neither the Carlisle Men Nor Their
Opponents Score.
PITTSBURG. Nov. 23.â 1n spite of an
all-day rain, which made the field a veri
table mud puddle, a good-sized crowd
gathered to witness the contest between
the Washington and Jefferson School
eleven and the Carlisle Indians. As in
the game last season, neither team
scored.
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 23.âMichi
gan 89, Beloit 0, is the astonishing score
of the football game between these two
teams to-day. The strong team from Be
loit was unable to do anything against
the Ann Arbor men. Only once, near the
end of the game, did the visitors gain
their live yards. On account of the
heavy, wet field, which was practically
a pond in the center filled in with saw
dust before the game started, few end
runs were made. Most of Michigan's
touchdowns were made through line
buckins.
LAWRENCE, Kans,, Nov. 23.â Kansa3
I 'diversity 12, Texas University 0. Kan
sas won an uphill game after a hard,
straight game of playing. No score was
made in the first half, in which the Texas
team excelled in punting, and in which
the ball was on Texas' 13-yard line once.
The score in the second half was made
after nearly twenty minutes' play.

ago that they should each fetch a house
hold pet to school on Friday in order to
make studies of their peculiarities. When
Miss Chapman called the class to atten

quest had been taken literally. There
were sufficient animals on hand to stock
a Barnum annex.
In the midst of the studying something
happened to start the girls to the high
places and the boys upon a hot pursuit.
By some unaccountable means a white
rat that belongs to one of the boys got
out of its cage. It was detected by a
brindle cat, which gave It a run for its
life. The proprietor of the white rat pur
sued the cat in an attempt to rescue the
rodent. Stirred to fewr neat by the ex
citement, a big Newfoundland dog joined
in the race. Soon every boy in the room
was doing his best Co herd the rat into
a corner. Teachers and girl pupils sought
safety on tKe chairs. Not until the cat
caught the rat was order restored.

LOSES HIS LIFE
FOR FIVE CENTS
August Lundgren Jumps
From Fast-Moving
Street Car.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
118 Broadway, Nov. 23.
Laboring under the impression that he
was about to be ejected from a street car
for non-payment of fare, August Lund
gren jumped from one of the coaches of
the Haywards electric railway last night
and fell in such a way as to land upon
his head and crush his skull. Death re
sulted early this morning at the Receiv
ing Hospital. ,
Lundgren and his wife had been guests
of the Campbell family at Elmhurst for
a week, having come from their home in
Towle, Placer County, where the hus
band was a blacksmith". He vohmteered
last night to go to High street to pur
chase some supplies at a grocery store.
Not being acquainted with the geography
of the place, he rode past his destination,
and while the car was running along
East Fourteenth street, between High
street and Frultvale avenue, the con
ductor demanded of him another 5 cents,
his first payment coi|ering only a portion
of the journey. Lunlgren refused to pay
the extra fare and the conductor was
about to stop the car to let him off when
he, thinking he would be put off, jumped
of his own accord. The car was going
at such a rate of speed that the man was
thrown heavily to the ground, landing
squarely upon his head.
Lundgren's death is particularly dis
tressing, as he had five children depen
dent upon him, the eldest of whom is 18.
His wife arrived at the hospital shortly
after his death.
giving day services, which will be held
et the First Methodist Church. The Rev.
Ernest E. Baker will preach the sermon.

DEATH ENSUES
FROM GLANDERS
A Prominent Society
Woman Is Mysteri
ously Stricken.
Scientists Are Baffled by the
Case of Mrs. Bertha
Martens.
Oakland Office Snn Francisco CaJ\
118 Broadway, Nov. 33.
Under circumstances which have baffle*!
the expert investigations of several phy*
sldans, Mrs. Bertha Martens, wife of DÂ»
Richard Martens, a prominent member of
the German colony of this city, died at
midnight at her residence. 903 Linden
street, from glanders. In what manner
the patient became Infected with the dis
ease the doctors have been unable to
le&rn. The malady Is one that rarely at*
tacks human beings. Careful examination
of the horses owned by the Martens haÂ«
failed to disclose the slightest trace of thÂ«
disease among them.
Mrs. Martens was stricken several day*
ago. Dr. J. P. Dunn was called to at
tend the suffering woman, only to have
his suspicions immediately aroused con*
cernlng- the nature of her affliction. That
he might have absolute certainty In thÂ«
diagnonsis, several other expert micro*
scoplsts and bacteriologists were sunn
moned.
No hope could be grlven for the recovery
of the patient, for there Is no known renvÂ»
edy nor cure for glanders, either in thÂ«
horse or In the human being.
The doctors were compelled to tell tha
sorrowing family that the case was fatal,
and only alleviating means to check thfli
suffering as much as possible until deatl*
should call could be used.
The physicians who attended Mrs. Mar*
tens refused absolutely to discuss tha
case. The certificate, as signed by Dr.
Dunn and recorded at the health office,
shows "glanders" to have been the causa
of death.
Because of the nature of the disease the
funeral was held privately this afternoon,
interment taking place in Mountain Vie**
Cemetery.
Mrs. Martens, nee Reichling, had lived
in Oakland since her babyhood. She waa
a native of Volcano, Cai., 40 years of age*.
She returned only a short time ago from
a tour of Europe. In social life she wad
very prominent. As an officer ar.d active
member of the German Ladies' Relief, So~
clety, Mrs. Martens was well known. Tha
family are recipients of much symparÂ»
i thy from a wide circle of friends.

Not Weaknessâ !
Symptoms
By far the greater number of patients, hew- -
ever,' seeking relief for so-called "Weakness 1 '
is furnished by . healthy and robust men. On
examination, we find a Prostate Gland which
has been damaged by either a contracted dis- .
order or early dissipation. These patients have
no weakness at all. Prematureness. Loss of
Vitality etc., are the symptoms, or disordered
function of the chronically Inflamed prostate
gland. We find by curing this inflammation
that full vigor at once returns. It should be
; understood that tonics, electricity, etc.. might
cure : a . real weakness, . but would do harm in
inflammation. The main object is to reduce',
the size of the tender, swollen and inflamed â¢
! prostate. This we accomplish by local treat-
. ment, thus avoiding drugs. Men who have un-
! successfully treated for a weakness should now
understand the cause of failure. We send free

which will be found useful in home diagnosis .

Pinkham is More Successful Than
Many Family Doctors.
A woman is sickâ some disease peculiar to her sex is^fast develop-
ing; in her system. She goes to her family physician and tells him a
story, but not the whole story.
. â¢ She holds back something, loses her head, becomes agitated, forgets
what she wants to say, and finally conceals what she ought to have told
1 this completely mystifies the doctor. . .
- Is it a wonder, therefore, that the doctor fails to curÂ© the disease?
Still we cannot blame the woman, for it i 3 very embarrassing to detail
some of the symptoms of her suffering, even to her family physician.
This is the reason why hundreds of thousands of women are now
in correspondence with Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass. To her tnejr-
can give every symptom, so that when she is ready to advise them sir
is in possession of more facts from her correspondence with the patient
than the physician can possibly obtain through a personal interview.
Following we publish a letter from a woman showing the result of
a correspondence with Mrs. Pinkham. All such letters are considered
absolutely confidential by Mrs. Pinkham, and are never published
in any way or manner without the consent, in writing of the patient
but hundreds of women are so grateful for the health which Mrs. Pink-
ham and her medicine have been able to restore to them that they not
only consent to publishing their letters, but write asking that this be
done in order that other women who suffer may be benefited by their
experience.. , . ,â¢ .
Here is Proof of the Value of Mrs. Pinkham's Advice.
" Deab Ms 3. . Pinkham :â I have been taking- your medicine for two
months and write to yon for some advice concerning it. I am in very poor
; health and have been for nearly three years. lam troubled with a pain and
i soreness in the back of my head and neck which develops into an almost un-
bearable headache at time of menstruation. Since last August I have been
â¢ confined to my bed a great part of the time. In January I was taken very
} . sick with one of -my awful headaches, and lay for five weeks in a critical
j . condition. Oar doctors were unable to tell me the cause of my illness. I had
a slow fever seemingly in my nerves with a marked bilious affection. I was
I . completely prostrated. My physician did nothing for me but to put me to
I sleep, said it was the condition of my nerves at the time of menstruation. I
j was advised to take liydia E. Pinkham's "Vegetable Compound, and
j â¢would like yo-ar' advice and to know the cause of my bad feelings."â Mbs.
Fbaxcss I. McCbea, Sheridan, Mont. (April 27, 1900.)
1 DsA.it Mas. Ptxkham ?â? â I wish to testify that I have been greatly bene-
j fited by the use of your medicine. After taking four bottles I felt better, my
j head and neck were greatly relieved. After reading the testimonies in the
I book you 1 sent me, I believed that I had a tumor, and a while after when
i something the size of an egg passed from me, I was convinced of the fact. I
j now feel like a new creature, can go to my work, and can eat and sleep well,
a privilege that I appreciate very much." â Mrs. Frances I. McCrxa,

HURRY IS QUICK
WITH HIS FISTS
Wife Says He Beat Her
Cruelly Very
Often.
Catherine Hurry of 1444 Folsom street
is tired of the cruel a;:d inhuman treat
ment she alleges she uas received at the
hands of her husbano, James S. Hurry,
and is suing for a divorce on the ground
of extreme cruelty. She filed her com
plaint yesterday, and ii her allegations
be true she has pu.t up with abuse enough
aljnost to cajise her to so gunning for hor
spouse.
They were married in 1894, and, com â¢
mencing in the fall of that' year, Mrs.
Hurry' claims, she has received a punch
ing or a kicking at least once a- week up
to the early part of the present month.
In 1894, alleges Mrs. Hurry, her husband
struck her and dislocated her Jaw and
kicked her so brutally that she suffered
intense pain for days. The weekly 'beat
ings that Mrs. Hurry 'Claims she received
were evidently varied in their severity,
for she makes no mention of any one of
those administered from the time that her
Jaw was dislocated until October 18 of this
year. On that date, aheges Mrs. Hurry,
her husband came home to dinner, and
finding that she had set the table for the
meal in the kitchen instead of 'the dining
room got very angry and commenced de
molishlng the dishes. lie drove his wife
out onto the back porch, she alleges,
punching and kicking her, and then
grabbed her "by the hair and dragged her
and Jerked her all over the porch. On
this occasion, alleges Mrs. Hurry, sha
took her two little children and went to
the home of her mother.
Mrs. Hurry returned to her home the
next day and enjoyed ceace until October
23. On the night of October 28, she al
leges, Hurry came home, broke open the
door of the bedroom in which she was
sleeping with her babies, brandished a
chisel over her head, beat her and then
hacked the furniture with the chisel.
Mrs. Hurry wants a divorce, the cus
tody of the two children and alimony
enough to enable her to clothe, feed and
educate the children. She claims that
her husband has an income ranging from
$100 to 1200 a month and is the owner of
GOO shares of stock In the Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Association.
Janet Arzner, wife of Louis Arzner, a
saloon-keeper, whose place ot business is
located at 16 Market street, is suing her
husband for maintenance, alleging In her
complaint that on November 14, 1901, he
deserted her, and thai since that day lie
has failed to provide her with the com
mon necessaries of life. The Arzners have
two children, one aged 9 years and the
other 4. The plaintiff wants $500 a month
to clothe and provide food for herself and
little ones. She claims that her husband
Is able to provide this sum without in-
Jury to himself or his business. She al
leges In support of nor demand for this
sum that he is possessed of property
worth 148,000, which she claims is com
munity property. The Arzners were mar
ried In Detroit, Mich-, *r. 1885,
David Jacobs, a tailor, got the worse of
an encounter with the law In Judge Sloss'
court yesterday morning. He was denied
a divorce from his wife, Etelle Jacobs.
Instead of a decree he received an order
to pay his wife $20 a month. Mrs. Jacobs
sued her husband for maintenance, and
he answered her compla'nt by filing a suit
for divorce om the ground of cruelty, al
leging that because his wife accused him
of supporting three other women he suf
fered great mental anguish. When ih*.
case came iip yesterday Mrs. Jacobs was
in court ready to face the charge, but
Jacobs failed to appear and -In conse
quence lost his suit.
Charles Kedlingr, who was married at
New Orleans -n December, 1899, is suing
for a divorce on the ground of desertion.
He alleges that his wife, Estelle Redling.
Is at present in the Crescent City run
ning about with all sorts of disreputable
characters.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterd<iy
by Louisa Lippe against Louis Lippe for
cruelty, and Flora Zacharias against
Charles Zacharias on the same ground.
URGES THE USE
OF SALT WATER
Commissioner Hecht Fa
vors Utilizing It to
Fight Fire.
Every effort is a,bout to be made by the
Board of Fire Commissioners to take up
the plan of an auxiliary salt water sys
tem for fire extinguishing purposes, as
suggested by Chief SutiJvan. At first the
system would be extended only to the
business portions of thÂ»: city, and wouid
be owned and controlled by the munici
pality. The proposition may be voted upon
at the coming bond election.
Speaking of the matter yesterday
Colonel M. H. Hecht o; the Board of Fir Â»
Commissioners said:
I am in perfect accord with the rest of the
Board of Fire Commissioners and the chief
engineer on that question. It is not a new
idea by any means, though it has been very
much neglected. When I became a member
of the Board of- Fire Commissioners one of the.
first things I did was to gather data on tltis
subject from the various Eastern cities and
found that where it was in use it was en
tirely satisfactory. I had plans and data sent
to me, which at the request of his Honor, the
Mayor. I turned over to him and he has them
now. He is entirely with us in this matter.
Situation Is Favorable.
There is not another city in the United State*
that is more favorably situated to establish
such a plant than San Francisco. New Tork
does most of this work through very powerful
fireboats, but the system proposed by our chief
engineer is far more certain and always ready
Boston, I believe, has a system of mains. We
here have practically no more protection for
our water front than anywhere else, except by
pumping water right from the wharves and
delivering it as far as our hose can carry. It
is true there la a flreboat; I am not familiar
with its power, but do know that it is prac
tically not in service, being used frequently
for excursions and inspections by the State
officers and often would be hard to find if
available at all. I believe the Spreckels Bros
Company has a tug fitted up as a flreboat but
it is private property and is intended only for
their own protection. This of Itself is a strong
argument that we should do something in this
direction. A plant should be established at
once that could take in the whole water front
and extend as far as Market and Fifth streets
and take in everything east of that for many
blocks. The chief engineer says the cost is
a mere bagatelle to this great city. It could
be used also for street sprinkling purposes, for
which use salt water is said to be much better
and healthier than fresh water. Apart from
all other reasons why this system should be
taken up at once Is the fact of the present
Inadequate water supply in many if not in
most places. Ever since my connection w4th
the Board of Kire Commissioners It has been
a constant fight for larger mains, more water
and more hydrants. The latter we can always
get, for the city is sufficiently generous in
that particular, but what use are the hydrants
when the mains are not put in place? The
records of the commissioners will show de
mand after demand upon the water company
for what is urgently needed, but very little
is ever done. Ido not know If anything more
needs to be said when I quote Chief Engineer
Sullivan, who says that had there been any
large fire at the same time as the Baldwin
conflagration the city would have been at Its
mercy for want of water.
Hopes Public Will Take Interest.
I sincerely hope the public will Interest Itself
in this matter and not leave It to be worked
out alone by the Board of Fire Commissioners
the chief engineer and the Board of Under
writers. As I said before, Mayor Pttelan is
favorable to the system. No doubt the com
ing Mayor can be easily convinced and If th*
general public will urge tbe establishment of
such a system I am quite certain It can be
brought about and if It la we will have made
the greatest Improvement the city has had for
years, if not ever.
It has been suggested that the western por
tion of the city can be supplied with salt water
from the pumping plant ana mains now being
operated in a limited way by the Olympic
Salt Water Company. That may be so, but un
less some equitable arrangements could be mad*
for many years, it would be better for the city
to own its own works. San Francisco should not i
be at the mercy of any corporation or company I
'rÂ«r uÂ« v/ntÂ»r gi'TiDlv for any purnose. While |
we have every reason to be proud of our flrÂ»
department yet it must have proper facilities
to maintain Its efficlei^-v. T do "it beHÂ»vÂ» t*e
people know how rapidly the city Is growing,
nor do they realize how much more promising
our future growth appears to be. hence we
must make changes and improvements to keep
pace with our progress. .

to straighten them out. A suit for an ac
counting was filed yesterday by George
Davidson, J. M. Quay and Duane Fargo,
executors of the will of Calvin F. Fargo,
against I* J. Rose Jr., executor of the
will of Jerome B. Fargo. The plaintiffs
allege In the complaint that the estate
of Jerome Fargo is Indebted to the estate
of Calvin F. Fargo for H0.198 7L
According to the complaint, Jerome
Fargo, at the time of his death, was pos
sessed of a valuable estate. In his will
he named Calvin F. Fargo as executor
thereof. A great deal of money was re
ceived by him as executor, but the plain
tiffs claim he* was compelled to pay out
much more than the income warranted,
and to meet the drain upon the estate he
was, they, allege, compelled to advance
various sums until he had drawn upon
his own resources to the amount of
$10,198 71.
He filed an annual account in 1896. It
was disapproved by the Probate Court.
The disapproval of the account was not
due to any fault of the executor, but was
owing to some slight irregularities in the
numerous claims upon the estate.
The failure to secure an approval of
the account is the cause of the present
troubles A short time after the account
was filed Calvin Fargo died and his
duties devolved upon L. J. Rose Jr.
Calvin Fargo named as executors of his
will George Davidson, J. M. Quay and
Duane Fargo. They found the two es
tates so mixed up that the suit filed yes
terday was necessary.
Sold Adulterated Milk.
George W. Forsyth, driver of a milk
wagon, was convicted oy Judge Cabanlaa
yesterday on the charge, of having adul
terated milk in his wagon. A test showed
that there was more Water than milk In
the decoction. The Judge sentenced him
to pay a fine of $26.

IN REAL ESTATE MARKET
Forward Movement Is Setting In and AH of the
Brokers Are Correspondingly
Happy.
\ Â¦ Â¦ *Â¦ - Jf '
â¢Â¦ Â¦ . " â¢ / Â¦
The -expected forward movement in real
Â«state has. set in and all the brokers are
bappy. There are buyers for lots in all
sections of the city and for available
suburban and farming properties. There
â¢.re also enough applicants for flats,
bouses and tenements to keep, the rent- _
ing: business active. There are few ellg:i-.<
We lionises that are not rented where the
Landlord has provided proper facilities
tor the tenant. In some of the real estate
brokerage houses the renting boards giv
ing an account of properties that are for
rent are nearly bare. On all sides, among
Solders of realty and also among the
' "purchasers confidence is expressed in the
future. Conservative estimates give the
dtV a growth approximating 10 per cent
sino<t the time of the taking of the last
censV*. when the population was 342,00)
in rotk'nd figures. The pressure upon the
hotels ,Â£or accommodations and the build
ing of new hotels, lodging houses and
apartment housÂ»:s to meet the demand
for room are signs that are not over
looked by .the Investors who are studying
the present situation and the outlook with
care. , \ Â¦
The progress ot* building is satisfactory^/
In the last we z the value of improve
ments to be adof d to the city In the im
mediate future was set forth la con
tracts to the amount of $195,000. The
large structure *chat the Mutual Bank Is
placing on Market street, running
through to Geary, already looms up im
posingly. All the speed possible is being
â¢ made to prepare for the erection of the
Flood building on the old site of the
Baldwin Hotel, .and also for the Crocker
Hotel on the cÂ»raer of Geary and Powell
streets. The building-? of the old Rlsdon
plant have been, removed. The Southern
Pacific Company will at once begin to
improve in that locality. The ' era of
costly buildings has been fairly ushered
in for San Francisco. The wholesale sec
tion south of Mairket street and east of
Third is rmdergoinsr such a change that
it amounts to rebuilding that part of San
Francisco on a scaie of expense that as
tonishes even the old-time dwellers in
the city, who have for years been pre
dicting *he future greatness of San ;
Francisco.
A much larger space than usual is need
ed for the reports of the doings of the
realty brokers, -who have ' long lists to
(ire out. Uaeir summaries of recent \
transactions are given below.

DESERT FIELDS
BEING LOCATED
Bowers Gives Account of
Wells Drilled on the
Colorado.
Shcrtage of Oars Works a
Hardship to the New
Industry.
Some idea of the extent to which the
California desert regions have been taken
up by oil prospectors is afforded by the
report of Stephen Bowers, field assistant
to the State Mineralogist, concerning the
Colorado Desert. Claims on that desort
have been located by the Cactus, Ca/ri'so
Creek, Flowing Weils-, Helvetia Inves'.
ment, Longrehr Oil and Development.
Palm Springs, San Diego Desert, Sail
Diego Oil BeK. San Di.\jo Oil and Dev-1
opment. Signal Mountain Oil, Signal
Mountain Exploration and Developmert,
Success Oil, Yallecitos Oil and Yuaha Oil
companies?. The desert has been divided
into four sections, wliith are known as
the Coyote Wells, C^rriso Creek, Fish
Creek and Seventeen Palms Spring dis
tricts. All of Carrizo Cieek district, near
the bed of Carrizo Creek, from the foot
of the mountains to Salton Lake, ai;d also
along the bed of Valiecltcs Creek below
Vallecitos Springs, has been located. The
district is bounded on the north by Black
Mountain, on the west and southwest by
Vallecitos and Laguna mountains and c.n
the south by Carrizo Mountain. The va 1 â¢
ley ,of Palm Springs, including the clay
hills, is about eight miles wide, at CW
rizo Springs about ten miles wide, ami
about five miles wide at the Cactus Com
pany's oil well. The v.ells that have been
begun in the desert ir this general local
ity have been drilled by the Palm Springs.
Cactus Oil. Mesquit3 Oil and Hanna.
Roark & Blethen companies. On the des
ert are water and jras wells and soda
springs. The district is generally de
scribed toy Bowers as fellows:
This dietrict extends from the boundary line
between the United States and Mexico on the
south to the Riverside County line on the
north, and skirts the mountains at their east
ern extremity, which in early Tertiary tines
Â¦were islands in the ocean, or made a deeply
indented seashore across what is now -?an
Dfego County. The district extends from tna
mountains eastwardly somewhat Indefinitely.
The desert proper slopes from an altitude of
about 400 feet toward the Colorado River and
Gulf of California, and in some places Is be
low sea level. Much erosion has taken place,
and the desert Is largely covered fvith washes,
sand dunes, scarps, etc., which make travel
more or leas difficult. The mountains on the
western side of this vast plain are destitute of
vegetation, but mesqulte trees, greasewood
end some other shrubs grow along the washes,
i.in the desert. S
The Car Shortage. /
The shortage of oil cirs on the Southern
Pacific is working a groat hardship to tn-?
oil producers. As an example the facts
concerning the Union Iron Works are
quoted by the Pacific Oil Reporter as fo 1
lows:
"When the oil fields of Coalingra and Kern
were developed so as to Insure an alipndant
supply of fuel the Union Iron Works made a
contract with the Mcnte Cristo Company by
which they agreed to take a larpe amount of
oil, covering a long period of time. The oil
is used under six large boilers, and nearly a
car and a hajf is consumed daily. For a
while all went well. The oil burned well, a
great saving of fuel was effected, and the
labor bill for handling fuel was lessened The
contract provided that the Union Iron Works
buy the oil at Bakersfi>!d and do Its own
transportation, and as the demand for oil
increased all over the State the Union Iron
works began to have trouble to get cans. At
last It became Impossible to supply the neces
sary fuel for the furnaces, and one after
another the oil burners were taken out and
coal took the place of oil. At present only
one furnace Is burning oil, where there should
be six. The Monte Cristo has the oil, but
the Southern Pacific Company has not got
the tank cars. Over half a dozen of the larg
est consumers in San Francisco have gone
back to coal, not because they did not prefer
oil, byt because they could not get it The
Standard Oil Company has Its own cars, and
makes the railroad haul them. It seems to lie
the only concern that is able to supply oil as
Favoring Combination.
Nearly every witness who could be
classed as an oil producer who appear*!.:
before the Railroad Commissioners the
last week in the railroad rates case at
tributed the demoralized condition of ths
oil business in this State to a lack of com
bination among the producers. It wo 3
conceded that nothing could raise the
price of oil except combination. The L/>s
Angeles witnesses, attributing the falling 1
off in the price at Lus Angeles to the
competition of the Kern River oil in the
first instance, spoke as decidedly in favor
of making a strong .-omblne as did the
owners of oil properties in the K>rn Coun
ty fields.
The manager of the Standard Oil Com
pany announces that from Point Rich
mend the Pacific islanri? will be supplioa
with California fuel oil .The company be
lieves that there will he a very large do
mand for oil in the Philippine Islands.
The Bakersfield Caliiornlan says that
the Peerless Oil Company has three
strings of tools at work, and that four
more holes will be driiiÂ«\3.
The New York Corrmercial gives the
following figures relative to the produc
tion of the Beaumont gushers: Total
shipments of oil to November 1, 1,500 .000
barrels; amount in storage, 900,000 barrels;
waste from Lucas. Beaumont, Palestine
and other gushers. 1.000,000 barrels; total
barrels, 3,400,000. From this it appea- s*
that there are 2,400,000 barre's for the
market exclusive of the 1,000,000 barrels
that went to waste. To make this total
shipment would require a demand for 10.
00 barrels per day for five months. The
domestic consumption of the Beaumont
oil. so says the Los Apgeles Herald, has
been confined to Tex.is and Louisiana,
and this has been increased by the ve-y
low price of from 10 to 20 cents per barrel
f. o. b at Gladys City or Beaumont.

TWO YEARS MORE
FOR DIMMICK
Judge de Haven Denies
Motion in Arrest of
Judgment.
A Fine of $730 97 Is Added
to Those Already Im
posed.
Walter N. Dimmick yesterday had two
yetrs added to his punishment for falling
to deposit Government funds properly.
United States District Jud^e de Haven
denied the motion in arrest or Judgment
antl sentenced the defendant to two years'
imprisonment at hard labor in the peni
tentiary. A fine aggregating $$730 97 was
imposed also, that being the total of the
two sums of money alleged to have been
held over by Dimmick from the quarter
In which It was received into the next
quarter. This sentence was imposed on
th 3 verdict of conviction on the nineteenth
and twentieth counts of the indictment.
The motion for arrest of judgment on
the conviction on the seventeenth count |
was granted by consent of counsel for the j
prosecution, the last day of the quarter
mentioned therein falling upon a Sunday.
Dimmick's counsel was allowed twenty
days' time In which to prepare a bill of
exceptions, and ten days' stay of execu
tion of sentence was granted in which to
prepare a writ of error.
Judge de Haven filed a lengthy written
report in the matter of the motion in ar
rest of judgment. It had been insisted by
the attorney for the defendant that the
Indictment was defective in this, that all
the facts alleged might be true, and yet
the defendant might not be guilty of any
crime, because, consistently with the facts
alleged, the defendant might have deposit
ed >he money in the United States Sub-
Treasury before receiving notice to de
posit the same upon the date named in
tho indictment, or, after having received
such notice, he might in fact have depos
iroci the money before the time fixed by
the notice.
In commenting upon this point Judge de
Haven said that while the indictment
would be more valuable as a precedent
If it had distinctly charged that the de
fendant did not, upon the date he was re
quired to do so, or at any time prior
thereto, make deposit of the money re
ferred to, and that he willfully failed to
n ake such deposit until after the required
date, still, he did not think that the judg
ment should be arrested for that omis
sion. The court continued:
"It is not necessary that such defense
'should have been anticipated and nega
tived in the indictment. The rule is, that
'all matters of defense must come from
the defendant, and need not be anticipat
ed or stated by the prosecutor.' (Chitty
on Chlminal Law.) 'Only a prima facie
case against the defendant is required.'
(Bishop on Crim. Proa, Sec. 513.) The al
leged omision in the nineteenth count
did not tend in any manner to the preju
dice of the defendant upon the trial, nor
wr.s it claimed by him that he deposited
the money referred to before the date
wl:en he was required to do so, and if j
such had been the fact he was entitled
to prove the same under his plea of not
gu'lty."
MINSTREL SHOW FOB
NATIVE DAUGHTERS' HOME
Members of Buena Vista Parlor to
Sing for a Worthy
Charity.
One of the institutions in this city that
in time is destined to become one of the
pi eminent features of fraternal organiza
tions in this city is the Native Daughters'
Home, on O'Farrell street, near Van Nes3
avenue. It was started for the purpose
of providing- a place where members of
tbe order coming here from the interior
can rest in comfort. The parlors of the
order have assisted the home in many
ways, but as yet sufficient funds have not
been secured to warrant the securing
of larger quarters, which are needed, as
the cosy little place now utilized is hardly
large enough to accommodate all who
would like to make it their home while
in the city. With the idea of creating the
nucleus of a fund that may in time be
swelled by donations, the members of
Buena Vista Parlor, of which Grand
President Mrs. Genevleve Watson Baker Is
a member, have generously offered to give
a minstrel show in Native Sons' Hall, on
the night of the 2d of E>ecember. This
action on the part of Buena Vista Parlor
has aroused a degree of Interest in the
other parlors, and the members are doing
all they can to help the cause along and
to have a crowded house to witness the
ladles in white and black repeat the per
formance they so successfully presented
a few weeks ago, for the benefit of the
fund for the sick of their parlor.
There will be a change of programme,
new jokes will be Introduced and there
win also be some special features.
Past President Miss Annie Worth will
again appear as interlocutor and the
principal participant will be Miss Alice
Ticoulet, president of the parlor; Misses
Annie Tremier, Belle O'Brien, Adel Laig
non, Laurler Miller, Etta O'Brien, Etta
Welch, Lillie Wilson, Emily Siebrech and
Mrs. Ella Wehe.
Druids Visit Oakland.
Noble Grand Arch Julius S. Godeau and
a nunjber of the grand officers of the
United Ancient Order of Druids, together
with the Past Arches' Association of this
city, paid a visit last night to Rome
Grove in Oakland, where there was an
exemplification of the ritualistic work.
Addresses were made by the noble grand
arch, by President James F. Martlnoni
of the Past Arches, Grand Trustee A. M.
Armstrong and other visitors, after which
there was a banquet.
Boy Thief Convicted.
Richard Silva, the 15-year-old boy who
Tias employed In the store ot the Max
Shlrpser Jewelry Company and systemati
cally stole articles of jewelry, which he
distributed among his friends and rela
tives, was convicted of petty larceny by
Judge Mogan yesterday. Ex-Judge Tread
v. ell made a jstrong plea for leniency, but
the Judge said he would make an ex
ample of him when he appeared for sen
tence to-morrow.
Murder Case Dismissed.
The case of Mrs. Bertha Dale, midwife,
charged with the murder of Mrs. Flor
ence Hamilton, was dismissed by Judge
Mogan yesterday. The Judgre held that
the evidence utterly failed to substanti
ate the charpe.
NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
VASELINE NO GOOD FOB HAIB,
Dandruff Germ Thrives in It, as Well
as in All Grease.
A well-Vnown Chicago hair specialist
invited the Inter Ocean reporter to come
to his office and see, under a microscope,
how the germ that causes dandruff
thrives in vaseline. The specialist said
that all hair preparations containing
grease simply furnish food for the germs
and help to propagate them. The only
way to cvre dandruff iÂ» to destroy the
germs, and the only hair preparation that
will do that is Newbro's Herpicide. "De-
stroy the cause, you remove the effect."
Without dandruff no falling hair, no bald-
ness. Ask for Herpicide. It is the only
destroyer of the dandruff germ.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORE. Nov. 23.â Speculative activity
was very great in to-day's short session of the
Stock Exchange and munipu'.ative devices were
freely used, t>oth by the bulls and the bears,
The -^.sequence was a feverish and excited
Â¦market. There was a notable accumulation of ]
New York Central. Norfolk and Western and j
Southern Railway stocks, Individual tractions
In these running from 1000 to SBOO shares. New
Turk Central was lifted an extreme 2%. Nor
folk and Western 1%. and Southern Railway
preferred 1%. There was a disposition to take
profit* In some of the recent favorites, which
had an unsettling influence upon the market
from the outset. Michigan Central Jumped
twenty point* The Buffalo, Rochester and
Pittsburg stocks and Minneapolis, St. Paul and
Fault Ste. Marie preferred rose 2%#Â«V Amal
gamated Copper was weak throughout, with
the exception of a Blight fractional gain at the
opening. In the late dealings the stock
slumped to 83, which is a fraction below the
lowest prices ever previously touched. The as
sertion waa published in the street that papers
against the Amalgamated Company are being
prepared In the Attorney General's office at
"Washington. This effected a break of 2% points j
In Sugar as well. This weakness took the edge
off the rally on the strong bank statement and
made the closing very irregular. Renewed sell
â¢r.r developed at the last In the transcontinen- ;
tal stock* also. The cash reserves of the banks i
increased about as foreshadowed and the heavy ,
loan contraction of $13,504,400 confirmed the be- j
lief that the goM exports of the week went to
liouidate foreign loans. It is asserted that the ;
I break in exchange is partly due to renewed
S celling by bankers in the process of extending
foreign loans *t!ll maturing, which amounts to
the creation of a fresh supply of short ac
counts in exchange, to be covered at later ma-
There was extraordinary Irregularity. In the
stock market during the week, leaning to the
tide of depression in the earlier part, but giv
ing place to strength and animation after the
middle of the week. In the comparative dull- <
nor* of the earlier part of thÂ« week the specu
lative sentiment of the general outlook was
vague nd conflicting and the only movement* j
of any importance were based on causes Indi
vidual to the stocks affected. As a conse
ciuence prices of different stocks were often
moving strongly in opposite directions. The
contending factors were, on the side of de
pression, the uncertain money outlook, due to
he heavy requirements of foreign money mar
kets for our gold and the agitation set on foot
in the Northwest States against the purposes
of the Northern Securities Company. So much
has been made of the formation of this com
pany as argument for higher prices, and the
stocks of the companies affected directly and
indirectly by It have been advanced to
po high a point that the prospect of legislative
opposition to the company was bound to be
considered in the speculative situation. Pro
testations .of determination to maintain the
separate V>nganl*aUon of the railroads brought
under the ownership of the one company did
not prevent a persistent drooping of the prices
of the transcontinental railroad stocks. The
export on Tuesday to France and Germany of
upward of $7,000,000 In gold. the largest
vjmour,t ever -exported from here in a single
/vay. kept attention focused upon the unprece
' dented condition In the foreign exchange mar
ket and offered no relief to the anxiety a* to
how far the obscure causes at work might con
tinue. The fact that the/ money, market hat
been only moderately affected was not convinc
ing as to the future. ;
It is a noticeable fact that the hardening ten
dency of call loans in the New ' York market
has not driven borrowers to resort to the time
money markets to supply themselves against a
fixed term in the future with funds at the pres
ent rates, which are rather below the current
rates for call loans, to say nothing of what
they would be in the event of stringency by
reason of the gold exports. The extensive re
sources of the domestic money market are
illustrated by the constant recuperation against
the losses of the gold output Although this out
flow Is about normal at the season of heaviest
merchandise experts, and must be to a large
extent â¢ unforeseen. It is partly made " good by
the constant inflow of. Australian . gold lat the
Pacific Coast. This country's own - production
of gold at the rate of over $1,000,000 per month
is also a part of the account, and must go to
explain the facility with which the needs of
European countries for the metal for money
purposes are supplied. The option offered by
the Treasury Department for redemption of
Government bonds Is also a safety valve
against money stringency, although the effect
of these redemptions Is modified by the fact
that some of the bonds offered for redemption
are withdrawn from the treasury, where they
were deposited to secure circulation, thus ope
rating to retire that much circulation. The re
laxation of the tension in the foreign exchange
market In the latter part of the week has been
an important influence In relieving fears of
money stringency - and reviving - speculative
movements in the stock list.' The absence of
gold exports to-day is taken as assurance that
the requirements abroad are satisfied, as it was
expected shipments would be necessary to meet
American -subscriptions, due in London on De
cember 5. to make the final installment of the
British loan. Besides the British loan, a large
Russian loan early next year is impending,
while the Chinese loan to provide that Govern
ment with resources to meet indemnity charges
is to be made some time in the ruture. Whether
these- requirements can be met without further
resort to our money market remains an unset
tled problem. The considerations which served
to make these doubtful factors .in the stock
market have to do with the extraordinary trade
activity and prosperity of the country as re
flected in the record consumption of pig iron in
attempts to "keep up with current orders, heavy
volumes of bank clearances and a . volume of
traffic in all lines never . equaled and beyond
the capacity of the railroads to meet, in spite
of the great increase of equipment and carrying
capacity in the Immediate past. Supplementary
influences are found in rumors of financial pro
jects looking to the consolidation of the minor
Var.derbilts. extra distributions by the subsidi
ary lines of the New York Central and of an
intended merger of New York City traction
lines by means of a security-holding company.
The railroad bond market has been moderate
ly active during the week, and investment is
sues have shown a firm tone.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â The statement of the
associated banks for the week endinK *to-day
shows:
Loans. $569,063.000; decrease, $13,504,400.
. Deposits. $932,579,700: decrease, $13,126,800.
Circulation. $31,972,400; decrease, $10,200.
Legal tenders, $70,550,800; increase, $515,400.
Specie, $177,175,500; increase, $586,000.
Reserves, $247,726,300; increase. $1,101,400.
Reserve required, $233,339,475: decrease, $3,
281,700.
Surplus, $14.456,925; increase, $4,383,100.
The Financier says: The 'm<*st reliable of
the estimates of the actual movements of
money, so far as they affect the bank state
ment, show that last week the banks gained
$55,400, notwithstanding the large gold ship
ments to Europe. The- payments by the sub
treasury for unmatured bonds and for new
gold, the net receipts by the banks in the
interior and the receipts of gold from Mon
treal, together exceeded by the above amount
the sum withdrawn for shipment to Europe
and the excess of receipts over payments by
the sub-treasury on the regular operations of
that office. The amount Â©aid for bonds pur
chased by the treasury was $4,564,900, and fhe
disbursements for assay office checks, repre
senting domestic bullion and also Yukon gold
deposited at Pacific Coast points, were $1,402,-
SOO, making together $6,267.7'X>. The receipts for
transfer through the sub-treasury were $130,000,
hence the net payments by thar olttce were
$6,137,700. The banks lost to the "sub-treasury
on fiscal and other regular operations $1,325,200.
so that the net gain to the banks from the
sub-treasury was $4,812,600. The interior move
ment of money resulted in a gain to the banks
cf $2,119,400 and $1,000,000 received from Mon
treal made tbe total gain $7,931,000. Gold ex
ports were $7,835,500, leaving tiie banks' gain
of cash for the week $95,400. The bank state
ment shows a gain of $1,101,400 in cash, of
which $5SÂ«,000 was in specie and $515,400 In
legal tenders. There were remarkably large
contractions in loans of $13,504,000, duo chiefly
to the repayment of borrowings through for
eign exchange. Hence a reduction of $13,126,800
in deposits. The lessening of $3,281,700 In re
serve requirements, together with the gain in
cash, caused an increase of ?4.383,100 in surplus
reserves to $14,486,925. Presumably exchange
leans will continue large for the needs of the
borrowers who resort to foreign money markets
for accommodation are urgent and hence an
expansion of loans may be expected to follow
last week's contraction. The increase in sur
plus reserve would seem to give assurance of
at least moderately easy money after the in
terest and dividend disbursements to be made
this week. The gain to the banks on the in
terior movement shown last week appears to
reflect a return of currency from the West,
whither It was sent for crop Durposes. Here
after, it Ib lair to assume, this movement will
most HUely gradually increase.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 23.â Trading In the corn pit
was the heaviest in a week, notwithstanding it
was Saturday. The demand all around was
good, both for samples and options. Decem
ber advanced steadily to a strong close, lc
higher, at 61>ie.
Wheat trading was dull and narrow. Decem
ber opened a shads to He higher at 71%@72%c
on better cables than had been expected, but
fluctuated between these two prices until just
before the close. Receipts were liberal, partic
ularly in the Northwest. Late reports stated
that the rain in the Southwaat had not brought
relief from the drought, but clearances were
light and the probability of large world's ship
ments to be reported made a steadying effect on
thÂ» market. December closed firm, %c at 72%
7S%c.
Bullish activity developed early in the Oats
pit.. December quickly advanced under this in
fluence and with hardly a setback closed
strong, lftc higher, at 42% c.
Provisions were dull, with an early easier
feeling which, however, was dissipated soon by
a fair demand by shorts and the grain bulges.
The hog run was large and estimate for Mon
day large. Pork closed 17% c higher, January
lard 2V>c up. at $8 87%, and January ribs Pfcc
higher, at $7 82%.

A WISE CONCLUSION. Â».,.., ,v
Mr Renterâ l've been a "damphool for the
last 15 years of my life. -_
Mr. Wisemanâ How do you make that out?
Mr R.â l have been paying from $20 to $2o
rent per month for a flat In a tenement ever
since I was married, and still I don't own a
stick of timber in it.
Mr W âYou certainly have been very fool-
ish. All that money is dead loss. Rent, rent
rent from early manhood to decrepld old
age. and still it is rent, and nothing to chow
Â°Mr. Râ That's as true as gospel, and that
is why I call myself a "damphool."
jr. W. It is never too late to mend, so
take the advice of a man of experienceâ ln-
vest In some "Ocean View " lots, build your-
self a cottage on the Installment plan; In
a turn short years you will have a nice home
surrounded by fruit and flowers, where you
can spend your declining years In content-
| ment with no fear of the landlord's call for
! monthly rents.
Mr. R.â Your advice is of golden value and
[ I sincerely thank you for it. Here is a de- ,
posit for the four lots. If I find the title ;
is O. K. I shall build me a cottage at once
I and then I can discard the name of "dam-
phool for ever more.
Ocean View Is a beautiful suburb of San
1 Francisco It Is eltuated in a lovely valley
in sight of the Grand Old Ocean, while the
gradual slopes Insure perfect drainage and
afford elegant sites for building purposes.
The San Jose Railroad, the San Francisco
i and San Mateo Electric Railway pass through
Ocean View every few minutes, enabling mer-
chants, mechanics and worklngmen to reach
their place of business at any hour during
the day or night.
Lovely lots and beautiful cottages can be
bought at Ocean View cheaper than In any
' other part of the city. '

THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY.
Erecting the third. If not second, largest oil
refinery In the world, capable of employing
from 1000 to 2000 men, and furnishing cheap
fuel, which will make Richmond the manufac-
turing center of California, and affording em-
ployment to more men than any other two
combined manufacturing centers In the State.
THE MORGAN SYNDIC-VTE AND OTHEP.S.
With their recent purchase of the Marasohi
property of over 500 acres, Including Molate
Point, at a great cost, combined with over
three miles of water front, will accommodate
the
LARGEST SHIPS THAT FLOAT IN THE
WORLD;
Where rallroad'and water will come together
and the trades of the Orient and the whole
European country will have access to our
western shore at this point, the extent of which
Is so great that it would be In vain for us to
predict the immense volume of business that
will center in this section within the next few
years. The
RICHMOND TRACT,
Which has just been subdivided and placed
upon the market, adjoins .the lands of the
Santa Fe Railroad Company's property, where
the car shops, roundhouses, warehouses, etc.,
are located. The Richmond Tract is In the
direct line of the improvements now being
made by the Standard Oil Company, adjoins
the postofflce, hotel, stores, and five minutes'
walk to the Santa Fe Railroad station. The
Richmond Tract Is the key to the situation of
all the lines of Improvements.
The first offer of lots in the Richmond Tract
will be sold at low prices and upon easy terms,
so that any one who makes an Investment In I
this property will be able to double their
money long before they have their lot paid for.
ONLY ONE WEEK ON THE MARKET,
OVER 75 LOTS SOLD IN' SIX
DAYS' TIME.
THE CHEAPEST AND MOST CONVENIENT
PROPERTY IN THIS WHOLE DISTRICT.
Remember, purchaser, this is only a com-
mencement of what will be done. If you
do not take Immediate advantage of this spe-
cial offer you will regret it. You, yourself,
will see month by month this property increase
in value, and it will then be that you will
say to yourself, "If I had only bought one or
two of these lots six months ago." We ?ay
to you, buy now, do not wait. Our first offer,
for thirty days only, will be from $153 to $250
per lot. Only $25 cash as first payment, bal-
ance at $5 per month, with low rate of inter-
est on the unpaid balance.
RICHMOND TRACT
Is the most eligible tract In Richmond.
la five minutes' walk from the Santa Fe
station.
Is inside the town of Point Richmond; ad-
joins the postoffice.
Is in a few blocks of the roundhouses and
carshops of the Santa Fe Railroad.
Has two applications for an electric road,
one granted, running directly In front of this
property on the north and south side of the
tract.
Is Intersected by three of the main streets of
the townâ Macdonald, Nevin and Richmond
avenuesâ each of which Is 60 feet wide.
Adjoins the Santa Fe lands where the rail-
road Improvements are going on and where
property must enhance in value most rapidly.
Soon their land will be covered with work-
shops, warehouses, employing hundreds of
men. Now Is the time to buy; It is still very
cheap compared with property adjoining. Noth-
ing is more certain that your Investment at
the present prices is better than any Savings
Bank in the United States and sure to bring
you greater returns upon the amount invested
than any other property in this section.
Richmond will be a great manufacturing as
well as a great shipping center.
RICHMOND, THE CHICAGO OF CALI-
FORNIA.
Three things have made Chicago a great city.
Its central location, Its position at the head
of navigation and its railroad system.
I Richmond enjoys these advantages already,
and very soon it will enjoy the manufacturing
business of the coast. It will enjoy the deep-
est water vessels that, travel from the Orient
and European waters.
The Ban Francisco Call In a recent editorial
says the development at Point Richmond
"means that this city (San Francisco) will
transact its business along the whole eastern
shore of the bay and that its greatest concen-
tration and best development wilt be where
ship and car can come togetner."
If space would permit dozens of thes* Â«di-

Entertainment Postponed.
The entertainment and dance which the
members of Tamalpais Camp of the
Woodmen of the World had planned for
last Wednesday night, but which had to
be postponed on account of the heavy
downpour, will be given on the night of
the 18th of December In Mission Opera
Hall, when the degree team of the camp,
which has just been organized, will pre
sent several surprises.
A most interesting lecture was delivered
before the Corona Club, the literary as
sociation of. the ladies of the Mission dis
trict, at its last held meeting. It was on
"Common Sense Reading," by Miss Jen
nie Long, who deplored the decadence of
the systematic study of good reading and
writing in the public schools, saying that
arithmetic was the only one of the three
Rs so thoroughly taught to our grand
mothers which is thoroughly taught now.
Miss Long illustrated her remarks by
the reading of simple themes from the
Bible. Longfellow and Bryant and hu
morous selections, which were highly ap
preciated by the large audience, in which
there were many ladies of other clubs cf
this city. Miss Carolyn Lunt gave a
short talk on "Domestic Science." Mrs.
E. Dewys entertained with instrumental
selections, and Madame Carrington, who
has a fine soprano voice of wide range,
delighted her hearers with vocal numbers.
This club continues to grow in numbers
and it is developing a wonderful desire
on the part of the members to learn more
of literature and appreciate it.

STEAMSHIP CHINA IS DELAYED
BY A BREAKDOWN IN MACHINERY
Expected Race to Honolulu Between That Vessel and the Alameda
Is Prevented by the Accident
THE PACIFIC MAIL COMPANY'S CHINA AND THE OCEANIC STEAMSHIP COMPANY'S ALAMEDA STARTING
FOR THE ISLANDS. SOON AFTER GETTING AWAY ONE OF THE CHINA'S STEAM PIPES BURST AND
SHE HAD TO RETURN TO AN ANCHORAGE FOR REPAIRS.
A GREAT amount of interest was
manifested along the front yes
terday in the sailing of the
Oceanic Steirnship Company'-J
Alameda for Honolulu and the
Pacific Mail Company's China for the
Orient. The latter calls at Honolulu on
her way to Japan and China.
The China is the "crack" of the Mail
Company's fleet and a./.ds the record be
tween Honolulu and San Francisco. At
the time she won thij the heads of tho
departments were aboard and the vessel
was speeded to see what she could da.
The Alameda was iccently remodeled
and a few days ago completed a most
successful round trip. It was generally
thought along the front that the vessels
would races but both Captains Herrima-.
and Friele said when questioned that r.o
such thought ever entered their minds.
They will make the regular time and no
more. Â«
The China was scheduled to sail at 1 p.
m. and left the Mail dock a few minutes
after that hour. When out in the strean
and headed for Angel Island she was sud
denly seen to put about and make for an
anchorage in the China basin. At first it
was said that she was waiting for the
Alameda, which sailed an hour later, in
order to give her a brush; then it was
said that she was awaiting a belated pas
senger, but when a gang of men from t*i^
Union Iron Works, headed by Robert
Forsyth, engineer in rhief, went aboard
it was feared that something serious hud
happened in the engine-room.
The damage to the China consisted of
a twisted steampipe, and workmen were
engaged all night repairing the damage.
It was expected she would sail early this
morning. She carries the following pas
sengers:

MOVEMENTS OF TRANSPORTS.
Two of Them Due Here Early Next
Month.
The Hancock from Kobe and the Sheri
dan from Nagasaki, Jappn, should both
arrive here early next month, while the
Thomas from Manila should get in about
December 20, or in time for Christmas.
The Warren is now on the drydock near
Yokohama. The Sheridan, Warren an'l
Hancock all got into trouble while at
tempting to bring homo a number of sick
and discharged soldiÂ«us. The Sheridan
was first to get into trouble, and the
Warren took her passengers and started
for San Francisco. Off the Japanese
coast the Warren struck on some rocks
and had to put Into Kobe in distress.
While proceeding to the relief of the Wat Â¦
ren the Hancock went ashore, and later
got off and is now coming home with tho
Warren's passengers. All the transports
were damaged in the Tnland Sea and were
in charge of the pilot at the time.
Hyades Arrives From Panama.
The Panama Railroad Company's Hy
ades arrived from Panama yesterday with
an enormous cargo l^ut no passengers.
She brings no late news from the isth
mus. The quarantine officer visited h"r
before sundown, but left her with the
auarantine flag flying, so she did not
dock last night.
Will Run to Vallejo.
The Southern Pacific Company has pur
chased from the California Transporta
tion Company the steamboat Pride of the
River, and Ehe is now on the Vallejo run,
replacing the Herald, which has gone to
Oakland Creek for an overhauling. The
Pride of the River tormerly ran on the
Sacramento and was deemed one of the
best of the California Transportation
Company's fleet. It is '-umored, however,
that this is only the lirst purchase, fcc4
that this particular opposition will soon
pass over to the Southern Pacific. This
would leave the Sacran.ento Transporta
tion Company as the one opposition line
to the Southern Pacific on the SacJ\i
mento.
Water Front Notes.
Captain Ellis of the thip Elwell is back
from a trip to Englanu, and will take his

proved to be a great success. It trav
eled 357 yards four feet under water and
struck thp object against which it was di
rected as true as a die.

ented an appliance for shifting- topsail 3

COMMEMORATION OF
EVACUATION DAY
San Francisco Society of New Yorkers
Will Partake of a
Banquet.
The San Francisco Society of New
Yorkers will hold its second annual ban
quet in the Occidental to-morrow night
in celebration of the day on which the
last of the British troops marched out of
New York and George Washington and
the Continentals marched In via the Bow
ery.
Major H. P. Bush, secretary of thÂ© soci
ety, in the invitation to the members to
take part in the festivities, says:
"And when good digestion ha 3 waited
on appetite long enough to satisfy it. be
fore offering the final 'tip,' let us discuss
the legends and traditions which have
cast their glamor over Manhattan Island
and its famous city. In the old Dutch
archives a view of New Amsterdam in
1640 shows prominently a fort, a Jail, a
gallows, a pillory, several taverns and
stores, and incidentally some houses.
While the gallows and pillory are gone,
there are now several more taverns and
stores and some more houses. As late
as 1674 old Jacob Van Der Water, the
Mayor of New Orange, had. as part of hi 3
duty, to make the rounds of the city
every morning, unlocking the gates. The
Mayor of New York 13 not that kind of
a 'rounder' these days, but he doubtless
has harder work to keep the city from be
ing stolen. But as has been well put:
Hail, mighty city; high roust be his fame
Who round thy bounds at sunrise now should
walk;
Still art thou lovely, whatsoe'er thy name-
New Amsterdam. New Orange or New York.
"Let us discuss the birth and growth
of the Empire State and the history and
progress of The City of the New World.
Knowing that In 1789 it was officially de
creed by the powers that be that there
were only 300 'in society,' let as guess
at the conundrum of why It has taken a
hundred years to add a hundred to the
list, while at the same time the increas
ing wealth, culture and brains of the na
tion congregate there from all the States.
Is a democracy fatal tÂ«> the growth of
'society'; and do republican institutions
foster the growth of everything but that?
Must the republic and the democracy jive
way to 'society, 1 or will the 'survival of
the fittest' result in a counter decree?
Those of us not in 'society' can easily
take a fall out of it on these lines."

INTO MEMORIAL PROJECT
Meeting Is Called to Take Steps to
Reorganize the Lincoln Monu
ment League.
A special meeting ef the Lincoln Mon
ument League will be held in the Cham
ber of Commerce, in the Merchants' Ex
change building, next Wednesday after
noon at 2:30 o'clock for the purpose of
reorganization. The league was organ
ized in March, 1597. for the purpose of
erecting a monument to the memory of
Abraham Lincoln. About $3000 has been
collected since that time, but the amount
is deemed entirely inadequate.
In order to awaken interest in the mat
ter a committee on reorganization has
been appointed. Henry E. Highton is thÂ©
chairman, the other members being W.
H. Beatty, James D. Phelan, Claus
Spreckels, John D. Spreckels. W. W.

clinch the liar.

Of course if you're posted you'll go to Hale's for your linens. If you're
not it's worth your while to get posted. . . ... -
The big folks come hereâ they're the shrewdest buyers of all. They
say they .must get as close to the fountain-heads as they can, if they'd get the
freshest patterns. And they pay less' than they would after an importer and
commission man got mixed up with .it. . â¢
Where big folks spend their hundreds is certainly a safe place for little
.folks to spend their tens. For no one. cares to go where they are not getting
all they can for the money. ' ; â¢ ' . .%Â¦ ' . ,_ . :^; ;

REPORTS FROM ALL SECTIONS SHOW A BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR MINERS
The busy season of the miners In Call
â¢fornia Is about at hand again, and in all
directions preparation* are making on a
large scale for delving tor ores In the
various ways now In vogue. The early
rains have given heart to many. Reports
received from various directions indicate
that this season will be made memorable
for the activity with which the mining
industry will be pursued In California,
and also in the other Pacific Coast States
and Territories and ir the north.
The Redding Free Piess reports that
eight miles of thirty-inch pipe have beÂ«n
laid for the Sweepstake mine, in Trinity
County, from rue mine to the headwaters
of East Weaver Creek. A portion of the
ditch has jet to be dug. A syphon will
connect the two lines of pipe. The sy
phon v.ill cross the low divide on Oregon
mountain. Unless stormy weather inter
feres too seriously the Xvork of bringing
water to the irine from East Weaver wili
be completed In about tliiee weeks. Tb.3
big -reservoir nt the mine is nearlng com
pletion, and preparations are being made
to work the mne during the winter.
The Memoria Coppci Company has been
Incorporated in Stjasta County, with H.
M. Le Barron, M. D. Merritt, Joseph A.
iLahny, 2s. D. Fowler iind Â£. M. iiobbs
as incorporators.
The Anti-Debris Association, according
to the reports in the Sacramento papers
of a recent meeting h?li in Sacramento,
has received maps and other data show
ing the condition of '.he several minas
that are operated by tne hydraulic pro
cess. The following report is credited to
Robert T. Devlin, attorney for the asso
ciation:
Robert T. Devlin, attorney for the associa
tion, reported that the case of County of Tuba
vs. Kate Hayes Company was argued in the
Supreme Court on the 14th of this month, and
that the eaTse of County of Sutter vs. William
Johnson, involving the Polar Star and other
mines, would be tried on December 9, and that
preparations were now being made for trial.
In this latter case the question of the effect of
a -oermit from the California Debris Commis
sion will be brought before the court. This
mine la located at Dutch Flat and is owned
by William Nichols. He has obtained a per
mit from the California Debris Commission
authorizing him to mine. The officers and
watchmen of the Anti-Debris Association have
investigated this mine and find that his re
straining works are totally insufficient and that
debris from his. mine enters the river.
Buy Washington Claims.
Joseph Morovits of Whatcom, Wash.,
has bonded claims on Swift Creek, In the
Baker Valley, says the Seattle Poet-In
telligencer. The parties taking the claims
under bond, to the number of thirty-four.

Maguire is the president and P. H. Wheel
er secretary of the syndicate. Morovits
tells the Post-Int.elliger.cer that he has a
Klondike. His statement is:
I have worked these claims a little bit my
self, and have taken out about $800. The largest
piece of gold I found was worth about 75 cents,
and the richest panful contained $1 50. The
value of the ground Is due. to the fact that the
gold is evenly distributed. The most of the
claims are in a box canyon. At the head of
this canyon will be placed a dam, the intention
being to turn the water out of the creek, while
from the head of the dam will be got a hy
draulic stream. It is estimated by experts that
in these claims and along the banks are $4,000,
00 in gold. I have tested the banks in two
places by putting in a small hydraulic appar
atus and cutting in where they are about 100
feet high. The earth in the banks runs 20 cents
to the yard. There will be about 400 acres of
this kind of mining. I now have 275 feet of
tunnels driven on bedrock on the aides of the
creek. The men to whom I bonded the prop
erty expect to make a -thorough investigation
and are satisfied that their venture will prove
vastly profitable.

for $10,000.
A. H. Hiatt and Victoria Haynes have
bonded to George Lightfoot the Victoria

price is $20,000. Lightfoot must begin op

Murray Innes of San Francisco has

Asbestos in El Dorado.
The Reading Searchlight says:
Since the closing down of the asbestos mine
In Tulare County there has been little or no
actual production of that comparatively rare
metal In the State, but there is a prospect that
the outrun will soon assume even greater im
portance than ever before. The Bearchlight re
ported about ten days ago the location of an
enormous deposit of asbestos by ex-Roadmafter
Craig near Sims, and now comes the story of
a discovery of a large body in El Dorado Coun
ty, on property owned by State Printer A. J.
Johnston and his assistant. E. S. Hadley.
About ten years ago they bought the property
to mine on it for gold. Some yearn afterward
they found a ledge of asbestos on It. They
thought little of the discovery until a few
months ago, when an expert from the East,
who was thoroughly acquainted with the asbes

State Mineralogist Aubury does not
take any stock in the reported success of
the \V3-nn process at Denver, by which
ore that assayed only $1 per ton is al
leged to have been made to give up $42 1,2
in gold. Metallurgists, he says, are hav
ing new and supposedly wonderful pro
cesses brought to their attention almost
daily. Inventors often find backers, and
the backers are often deceived and lose
their cash. Sometimes the chemicals em
ployed, if they tetrted, would be found
to assay well in gold. Aubury recalls the
case of Paraf. who once operated in San
Francisco, as an Instance of a man who
made extravagant claims for his pro
cesses and succeeded in landing a great
deal of cash. Paraf obtained a rock from
the Pctrero, from which local assayers
could not obtain a trace of gold, which
was "green," so Paraf said, fan that the
gold had not developed. After Paraf hid
manipulated the rock with his secret
acids he made it yield on the basis of
thousands of dollars per ton. The secret
of his success was brought to light when
a sample of the mysterious acid employed
by him was discovered and submitted to
analysis. It contained a largo amount of
gold in solution. About that timÂ« Para
left San Francisco and went to South
America.
* Mineralogist Aubury recalls, thÂ« last .
example of any note of thÂ«'Paraf sort,
which was very crude. A man named
Granville claimed in Chicago to be able
to create gold from the oxides of anti
mony and tin. He associated with him
a nephew' of Calvin S. Brice, but the
scheme was exposed before those who
might have been duped had parted with
mucn of their coin. Granvllle then vis
ited Los Angeles and there worked sev
eral capitalists on the same proposition,
and a monument of that exploit stands in
furnaces, etc., on .the outskirts of Los
Angeles.
â¢ Mineralogist Aubury wishes Â¦to express
doubts concerning any such claims as arÂ«
now set up in behalf of the latest Wynn
process. ]; He says that the miner of to
day "is well satisfied to obtain from, his }
ores about the per cent. that a fine assay
will yield. Yet there are many persons
who are not familiar with metallurgical
processes who are willing to believe the
impossible can be accomplished, especial
ly if they are mystified by a great amount
of seiieca:. - â¢
