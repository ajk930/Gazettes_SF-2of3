has notified the Sultan's first sec

between France and Turkey are

informed his Government to that effect.
M. Constans communicated direct with
the Sultan because the latest negotiations
were transacted with the Sultan person

LONDON, Aug. 22.â Diplomatic opinion

pears that the chancellories of Europe
have been considerably annoyed by the
Sultan's, recent efforts to reassert him
self and to shake off the limited control
.exercised by Europe over certain parts of
his administration. The Sultan's dispatch
of a mission to the Far East was also
displeasing to the great powers. The lat
ter, therefore, are expected to generally

PITTSBURG, "Aug. 21.â The steel
strike situation* underwent ! ho
change to-day. There was no ex
tension of the strike and the steel
managers did not attempt to start
any more mills. Late in the day the fires
were lighted in the Demmler, Tin Plate
Works at McKeespprt, but the machinery
was not started and no. attempt was made
to operate it. If is believed, however, that
the move Ms. preliminary to a start with
non-union men. The ; managers , of ths
company have been preparing for several
days to reopen a number of their proper
ties, "and it is thought they have decided
to act 'at once. Their Monessen plant is
moving ahead uninterruptedly with full
crews, and their Crescent Works at Cleve
land has about half the machines in ope
ration. There has/been no break In the
Carnegie group, and the mills that have
been started with non-union men since
the strike began are going ahead with
about the same force of men. j The leaders
on either side were busy. all day, but at
nightfall both said there were no an
nouncements to make. I
President Shaffer was at the office of
the Amalgamated Association all day and
spent most of the time conferring with
delegations of strikers. _
According to the strike leaders, only
twenty men who' were formerly members
of the Amalgamated Association '-. have
gone to work in mills that are now. being
operated partly or in full 'with non-union
men. The steel managers place the num
ber of desertions at a bigger figure. ;

OAKLAND, Aug. - 21.â The published
statement that the wholesale lumbermen
of San Francisco propose to boycott all
planing mill owners who shall maintain
the agreement to unionize their mills on
September 1 Is declared to be without any
foundation in fact by the .managers of
such wholesale firms as are engaged In
business in this city. Some of the planing
mill owners say they have assurance that
the wholesalers will demand the discon
tinuance of the use of union labels on Sep
tember 1, when the agreement made six
months ago between the Planing Mill As
sociation and the operatives' union com
promised a strjke. George W. Fisher
manager of the Puget Sound Lumber
Company, said:
"There has been no refusal nor is there
any refusal intended to sell to mills with
union hands. -The fact is that the mill's
generally buy from the retail dealers."
Hugh Hogan of the Humboldt Lumber
Company says he knows of no such move
as a boycott under contemplation by the
lumber dealers. - ,. .

â¢ The -number of men returning to work Is not
large and were only a few of the molders. and
Borne of those who returned on last Monday
morning have again come out and Joined forces
with . the Molders' Union ; once more. As for
the other iron trades on strike I can state
positively that in the' thirteen weeks of thÂ»
4000 or 5000 men who have been on strike there
have, not been over twelve desertions Irom the
ranks. I further wish to state that there is
only one union connected with the iron trades'
6trike who came out immediately in sympathy
with the machinists' move for the shorter work,
day a.nd that was the Ship Joiners, and at the
present time they are out on a sympathetic
strike with the other unions on the water front.
As for the other unions connected with the
iron trades' strike each and all of them made
the request for the nine-hour day with no re
duction in pay. Â» â¢Â¦ ' .
The task of getting machinists in the East to
come -and take our plates has not been suc
cessful, for at the end of three months there
is not one shop in this city that has been ablo
to get enough men to say that they are doing
any work at all. Jn fact we know that the
men hired .and called skilled mechanics are
not capable of filling the bill, neither are they
doing the work, but are kept in the different
shops merely as a 'bluff, and the statement
given out that the different, shops are running
full handed or almost bo is very far from the
truth. I have information from our lodge in
the East .that the employment agencies are
offering from 50 cents to $1 a day more for men
to come here to take our places than the iron
trades are asking, and we deem this a direct
refutation of the statements made by the em-,
plovers that they . cannot grant us the nine
hour day with no reduction in pay as against
Eastern competition. We will admit the fact
that the wages paid on this coast are somewhat
higher than paid in the East, but we are also v
brought face to face .with the condition that
all kinds of material, household supplies, etc.,
are Just as much higher comparatively as
wages. r. I. WISLBR.
. Replying to the statement in one of the

Impression that the statement In the aforesaid
morning paper would lead one to believe. One
might infer that the machinists' strike was
broken .and that the men were Â¦ gradually re
turning to work. Such is not the case, as the
machinists and other iron trades are standing
just as firmly now as they did on the 20th of
May and with more determination than ever to
win than at that time. They realize that this
Is a fight .for the very existence of the trade

BENICIA, Aug. 21.â There came very
near being a tragedy enacted on this side
of the straits this evening by a gang of
striking Btevedores from Port Costa and
a deputy constable with a company of
non-union laborers for the - Warehouse
men's Association. A representative of
the association arrived here on the Sac
ramento local with a gang' of about twen
ty-five laborers ; and attempted to take
them from the train at Army wharf. In
the meantime the stevedores had received
news of this. move and a large posse of.
them came across the straits on the ferry!
Solano to prevent the non-union men
crossing. They marched in a body toward
Arsenal station and the association's rep-'
resentative, . fearing trouble,- called on
Colonel Mordecai, commanding Benicia
arsenal, who placed a guard of United
States soldiers near the wharf to prevent
any act of violence. The workmen were
taken away on the launch, but the rep
resentative on his way back north was
assailed in the railway station here and
knocked down and kicked almost into
insensibility. Â¦ â¢
A Contra Costa' deputy constable was
sent ever -to heljvkeep order, but he 'soon
found he was out of his jurisdiction upon
being relieved of his club and revolver and
receiving a little rough treatment.
Sheriff . Veale of Â« Contra Costa County
has been called upon for more protection
and. a large force of deputies is .now
guarding the water front from Port Costa
to Crockett. There has been considerable
friction on the bother side, and if the em
ployers attempt to put non-union men at
work it is feared hostilities will commence
in earnest. . . . - -
"I am getting all the men I want for

be put to the necessity of calling upon
the unions for help again."

POX/ECEMAIT FOUND GrTTILTY.
Judge Cabaniss Holds That Knight
Overstepped His Authority.
Judge Cabaniss gave his decision yester
day morning in the case of Policeman O.
H. Knight, charged with battery. He
finds' the officer guilty as charged, but
sentence was postponed till .Saturday,
Knight's attorney, Joseph Coffey, having
given. notice of appeal.. .. _ ;',:.; .<*Â¦â¢-.
The action v against ; Knight was brought
on'-, complaint - of James Â¦ Maddison,- . a
marine engineer, f On Monday, August 12,
two firemen were fighting on East street
in front of the Oceanic dock. Knight and
other . officers cleared the crowd- away.
Maddison i was moving away slowly when
Knight told him to move on. Maddison,
called the officer a vile name and the of
ficer struck him on the back, as he claims,
with his club. 'The club glanced and in
flicted a scalp wound. on the side of Mad
dlson's head. Â¦ . . -
Judge Cabaniss' decision follows in full:
The court* intimated in a very general way
when this matter was here the other day Its
view as to the law governing the matter,
stating then that its apprehension was not
that there would be any difficulty with refer
ence to the law, but that, as is so often the
case, any nice Question which might' arise In
the matter would have to Â¦ do with the evi
dence rather I than with the law. I read very
carefully, and more than once, each and every
citation submitted to me by Mr. Coffey, the
attorney for the defendant, and that careful
reading confirmed my own judgment as to
what the law was. . â¢ . â¢ .
Now, without going in extenso into the mat
ter, it is enough to say generally that I take
it that there is and there can be no question
as to the right or even the duty of the police
officer where a crowd of persons have assem
bled under circumstances which lead him to
believe that that assemblage will, if not dis
persed, result In a breach of the peace, to first
of all, as the law points out, order them to
disperse, and in the event of their failure so
to do to use every endeavor to forcibly. If
necessary, effect a dispersion. That is clear.
It is equally clear, I think, from the evidence
here, that there was on the occasion In ques
tion a concourse of people somewhere on East
street in the vicinity of the Oceanic dock, and
that several officers engaged in duty there. In
cluding the defendant. Officer Knight, were
apprehensive that unless that crowd waa dis
persed more or less serious trouble would en
sue, and they therefore did, according to their
tAra statements, ! and according to the state
ments of the witnesses generally, disperse the
crowd. â¢-
Now, the one point in this matter which
seems to me to be absolutely decisive of the
case, technically speaking-, and it 1 a with the
law, technically speaking-, that I am com
pelled to deal, with this reservation; that
where a person Is charred by the law, as a
police officer is with more or less onerous
duties, which upon occasions Â¦ of emergency
such as has been \ presented here, which de
mand that he act promptly and sometimes
vigorously, without- taking time . for serious
consideration, I would be disposed within reas
onable limits- to sustain an officer who, under
such circumstances, in the exercise, as he un
derstood it, of, his duties, even if In. some par
ticulars he Â¦ may naye overstepped the bound
ary - a hair's breadth, 'but in this matter,
while I have considered It from that aspect
and have been prone as I conceive it my duty
to have been to give the benefit of any reas
onable doubt. to this defendant, yet I cannot
escape the conviction - that those authorities
submitted by Mr. Coffey are not in point, -and
for this, reason: The evidence - all . tends to
show, more or less persuasively' that at the
time of the occurrence which i resulted - In ' Of
ficer Knight's arrest the crowd had been dis
persed, or rather, if not dispersed, Â¦ had been
shifted by the officers from the original scene
of the gathering to another point, and it was
testified | by the officers themselves that the
complaining witness in this case did not move
with the crowd, or if he did move, did not
move with celerity,, and at the time of this
Occurrence was not a part and parcel o'f the
crowdâ was I some I distance | from Â¦ the crowd.
This transaction, therefore,' is subsequent in
poiht of time to the original episode, namely,
the dispersion of the crowd, and so far as this
complaining witness is concerned he was there
alone, practically, and had chosen, as he says,.
because of i his physical condition, but as the
officer evidently thought through perverse
ness, ; not to move , on. Now, if he did. that
right in the midst of tHe crowd, even -though
his purpose in mingling with : the crowd had
been not to violate the - law Â¦Â¦ but to . conserve
the law, as he says, in fact, was his purpose,
and that for ' the ;Â¦ reason where there is- a
crowd-assembled and where there. are at least
some people in the crowd who, according to
the view of the officer and according to < the
facts as revealed by the evidence, persons who
were more or less inclined, to acts of lawless
ness, ! it is under those circumstances, I take It,
as much the duty; of a citizen who goes there
to preserve the peace to move on, as it is the
duty, of any person in that crowd who may be
more or less lawlessly disposed so. to do. - Â¦
Â¦Â¦\ To | -what | extent the members of Â¦ tfiat I crowd
â¢were lawlessly disposed, or if they were how
many of the crowd were so disposed, of course,
cannot be accurately determined from the evi
dences nor is it necessary it should be. - It is
enough In that regard to know there had' been
a flight, a scrimmage of some sort there, and
that.it attracted a large crowd, ' and : that the
officers believed unless that ' crowd was scat
tered trouble and more serious Â¦ trouble might
ensue, but ' so far as this transaction' is con
cerned-It stands separate and apart;*, in a legal
point of view,; from -thÂ« . main demonstration
there," and it becomes - my ' duty, therefore, to
"We are in a position to know that fully
thirty molders would have gone back to
the Union Iron Works had it not been
that many feared personal violence by
adopting that course. We have proof that
from $5 to $10 Is being paid to persons for
every assault made upon union men who
return to work. As for. the charge that
we were bribed to go back to the 1 works,
the statement Is Â¦ simple nonsense; The
fact Is that we went back with the full
knowledge that we were to accept the old
schedule of hours and wages. After being
out thirteen weeks or thereabouts we
have simply accepted conditions which we
might have enjoyed a.l along without the
loss of a single day's pay. The most of
the molders went- out without their free
"President Martin Fox of the National
Union informed the men of the Occidental
foundry that they.thould not strike with
out authority from the national body. The
result was that after being out a few days
they returned to *vork. Vice President
Valentine, who was in this city, cautioned
the union not to' go on a sympathetic
strike, as the support of the National Un
ion could never be secured. Nevertheless
the 6trike was declared by open vote ol
the union.
"Many of us became members of the
union very relucantly. because we feared
walkouts and did not care to suffer the Ills
that follow in the wake of protracted
strikes. It has been said we asked to be
allowed to join the union, but this. too,. Is
a falsehood. Pressure was brought to
bear upon us to join and finally to secure
harmony we became members of the or
ganization. % , , ' .
"In May the strike of the machinists oc
curred. The Molders* Union, being af
filiated with the Iron. Trades Council, the
proposition of going out on a sympathetic
strike was advanced to union members.
In ISftO. when the molders struck, the ma
chinists refused to assist them In their
light, and while the machinists could not
consistently ask the molders to help them
cut In their strike, the fact that the mold
ers were afnliated with the Iron Trades
Council was made the pretext for stand
ing in with the machinists. The proposi
tion cf strike or no strike was brought up
In the union in the shape of a resolution
not tc work at the Union Iron Works be
cause it was unfair. The sentiment was
pretty evenly divided, but the resolution
was "carried by a bare majority. The
strike was then agreed upon, against the
nrotes ts of the better element of the
union and in violation of the laws of the
International union, wrich forbade a
strike of subordinate unions without the
sanction of the national body.
"When the strike was declared the un
derstanding .was that the strike benefit of
55 a -week would be, paid to members in
good standing even though assistance
must be secured from other unions. We
received' the assurance that the National
Union would ultimately recognize the jus
tice of our action and extend us financial
aid. We were out thirteen weeks and in
that time we drew $11 per man. Some,
men were out eleven weeks, but they drew:
the same amount. None of the promises
of the union in this respect were kept and
the result was not only dissatisfaction but
hard times %xnong the members who had
families to support. Whenever Inquiries
were made concerning the fulfillment of
the promises of financial assistance the
men were put off from day to day and
nothing was done.
Troubles in the "Union.
"On August 12 Secretary Rosenberg of
the Labor Council delivered an address to
the molders. in which he said that if any
of the men desired to return to work they
could do so without being declared to be
'scabs.' The matter of withdrawing the
molders' delegates from the Iron Trades
Council came up, and it was supported by
many in the hope that this would result
in the men returning to work. The senti
ment was strong in favor of withdrawing
from the council, but not sufficiently
strong to carry it through. Whenever
any one arose to speak in favor of going
back to work he wa3 hooted down. At
one meeting a man who expressed him
self against the strike was badly beaten.
Secretary McCabe of the Ironmolders'
Union, and who is also the president of
the Iron Trades Council, opposed every
effort of those members of the union who
were desirous of returning to work. In
consequence of his course he has been
condemned by the better element of the
union. Â¦ Â¦
Joined the Union Reluctantly.
THE fact that nearly a score of
molders have returned to work at
the Union Iron Works is causing
the members of Ironmolders
Union No. 164, as well as the Iron
Trades Council, considerable annoyance.
Official statements from the managers of
the Union Iron Works us to the return of
the men have been declared as lies and in
support of this declaration the charge
was made that the men were bribed to go
baclt to the places they held prior to the
strike. . The additional allegation was ad
vanced that the returning molders were in
fact non-union men. they having been
suspended from the union for displaying a
lukewarm interest in the striking ma
.chinists' cause.
A delegation of union molders who went
to wcrk at the Union Iron Works... last
Monday was Interviewed by a Call re
porter yesterday at the request of the
men themselves. These men. who are
known to be experts in their line and some
of whom have been identified with the
Ironmolders' Union for years, stated that
they had been misrepresented by the
strike leaders and that they desired- to
make a statement of the facts of their
case. The spokesman of the party said:
"There; are seventeen union molders at
â¢work in the Union Iron Works at the
present time. One man walked out to
day, but another took his place imme
diately. Every one of us belongs to Iron
molders' Union No. 164. All of us are in
good standing, as the books of the secre
tary of that organization will show. The
statement of the officials of the union that
Â¦we were suspended because we were not
in sympathy with the machinists is
false.

return to work without suffering the
odium of being termed scabs. The strike
situation will not suffer by reason of the
action of this handful of molders.
"It is untrue that money is paid to any
one for assaulting any one who returns to
work. These assaults are the work of
hoodlums, and all strikers condemn them
unsparingly. Regarding strike benefits,
I will say that the full benefits were not
paid. Some of the strikers refused to ac
cept any money at all. At the last meet
ing of the union it was decided by a vote
of 126 to 1 to send our grievance to the
National Union. We have received the
assurance that it would be favorably
acted upon. This means that we will re
ceive the sanction and assistance of the
Isational Union. The molders, numbering
nearly 250 who are out, are determined to
remain out to the end, and they will not
be influenced from their course by the
anonymous statements of a few. scabs
The machinists' strike is- still on and it
will continue until the demands of the
men have been complied with.".
"Nearly all the statements made by the
molders who went to work at the Union
Iron' Works are false. The sentiment in
favor of a sympathetic strike was not
evenly divided. On the contrary, it was
very much one way or there would have
been no strike. Vice President Valentine
never cautioned the union not to strike.
On the contrary he said such a move
ment would be indorsed by, the National
Union. That body is now. about to indorse
our action; so that within a short time we
will receive all the financial aid we re
quire. /

Union was seen last night and asked to
express his views concerning the allega
tions made by the molders at the Union
Iron M'orks. He said: " .

consent, and now, .when they desire to
furnish food for their families they take
the chance of being waylaid and beaten
to death. We have been threatened, but
to be forewarned isrto be- forearmed, and
any one who tackles us does so at his
peril. We never had a grievance against
our employers, and the strike was not
only illegal, but it. was damaging to the
cause of labor in this- city. The hearts
of the men were not in the movement and
it lacked moral support. The leaders,
who receive pay from the unions in times
of strikes, are responsible. for all the trou
ble. Surrounded by their fire-eating
cliques they are in a position to force
through any measure that pleases them
to advocate. Secretary McCabe never
kept a single promise made to us, but,
on the contrary, heÂ»deceived us' on nuÂ»
merous occasions. We are satisfied to re
main at work and quit the union forever.
Having come to this conclusie-n for the
sake of our families and for the best in
terests of the community at large, we are
willing to take our chances with anything
that the future may bring fortn."
The strike situation did not change in any important particular yesterday. A few more non
union men were pat to work at Port Costa and along:, the water front, lyit additions . to the working
force were not made in. the wholesale district nor at the Union Iron Works. The sand teamsters, who

only to flm* that it had crept through the

of wood were burned on the sidetrack.
At 3 o'clock the fire was under control
and by 6 o'clock the timbers had burned
out and the roadbed cooled so that 400
workmen began cleaning the debris and
laying new ties and rails. They will work
all night and will have the track fully

"You had slanned the job for a long
time, and I believe that any man who en
ters a building for the purpose of stealing
is no better than a murderer, for if caught
in the act I believe he would commit mur r
der to protect himself. I believe you
wculd, too. You confessed because you
believed the- evidence was so strong
against you that there was no possible
chance to escape. The judgment of the
court is that you be imprisoned in the
Stale orison at Folsom for a term of fif
teen years."
Attorney Alvarado asked that the pris
oner be sent to San Quentin, but this was
refused. Winters had nothing further to
say. He bade "good-by" to Superintend
ent Ropp and Constable Moiles and a few
others, and was then hustled to the depot
and took the Sacramento train for Fol
som.
The court, in passing sentence, said that
it was an unpleasant duty to send a man
of the character of the prisoner to prison,
but that he did not consider he was en
titled to any mercy.
Attorney Alvarado, who appeared for
the prisoner, said that Winters was sorry
for his crime; that he had done all that
mortal could to restore the property to
the owners, and that a short sentence
would carry out the law as well as a long
one. He believed one spark of hope
should be held out to the man.
Winters was told to stand up. After
the Information was read to him the pris
oner was asked if he had any reason why
judgment should not be pronounced. In a
trembling voice he said that previously
he had always led an upright life and had
been an employe of the Selby Company
for the last seven years; that he was
sorry for the crime and wished the court
to take his previous good character into
consideration, as it was his intention to
be a good citizen after he served his time.
He pleaded for mercy.
Superintendent von der Ropp of the Sel
by Company arose and said that he wish
ed to redeem a promise that he had made
to Winters when he confessed. He said
that he told Winters that one-third of the
stock ' of the company was held by em
ployes, and that they could ill-afford to
lose the amount taken. He believed it
was on account of this that Winters con
fessed. Ropp said the prisoner had al
ways been a good â¢workman and he asked
the court to extend leniency to him.
When court opened, promptly at 10
o'clock, the room was crowded with spec
tators eager to get a glimpse of the bur
glar. As Winters had pleaded guilty,
Sheriff Veale was placed on the stand to
determine the degree of the crime. The
Sheriff said that Winters told himself and
Theodore Moiles that he accomplished the
Job between 9 p. m. and midnight on Au
gust 5. The court then adjudged the
crime was burglary In the first degree.

Mystery..
Griffin behaved himself until about' two
weeks ago, when the drinking and abuse
began again. Last Saturday, Gillespie
says, and this Mrs. Griffin admits, she
The Griffins were married two years ago
to-day. Six weeks ago they buried a year
old baby. The baby was born in the Gil
lespie house, at 119 Ninth street. There
the couple continued to reside until about
two months .xgo. when they removed to
more commodious quarters. ' - .
Griffin Was Abusive When Drinking.
According to lodgers now staying in the
house Griffin was a hard drinker and was
constantly abusing his wife. "When the
baby died Mrs. Griffin told Gillespie they
wished to return, as she wanted to be in
a house where there was always a man
around. From this Gillespie inferred, he
said yesterday, that she was afraid of her
husband. He rented them a room on Mrs.
Griffin's assurance that her husband had
taken the pledge and was another man
since the baby's death."
Gillespie admits having been in a state
of great excitement, which he attributes
to his indignation at a foul epithet ad
dresed by Griffin to Mrs. Gillespie. He se
cured the revolver, he says, for the pur
pose of bluffing Griffin. He had no inten
tion of using U, but as he recalled the
name Grifljn had applied to his (Gilles
pie's) wife he gradually worked himself
Into a rage. Without knowing what he
was doing he had pressed the trigger and
the mischief was done.
Mrs. Griffin sticks to the statement that
her husband did not at any time threaten
Gillespie or his wife, or, pick up or ex
hibit, as Gillespie states, a knife or any
weapon whatsoever. She says further
that the only knives in the room were
ordinary silver rlated ones, and that they
were nevei disturbed.
QEORGE D. GILLESPIE, the
lodging-house keeper, who on
Tuesday evening shot and killed
William F. /Griffin, one of his
lodgers, was brought before Po
lice Judge Conlan yesterday morning and
instructed as to his rights. Gillespie is
charged with murder, and on Saturday
morning Judge Conlan will set the date
for his preliminary examination. The pris
oner has- retained ex- Judge Ferral to de
fend him.
The stories of the killing as told by Gil
lespie and Mrs; Griffin, wife of the de
ceased, are contradictory in some very es
sential details, and the closest cross-ex
amination fails to change either account
of the shooting.
- "I'll give him a show to prove that he
had provocation," Griffin said yesterday.
"It s possible he had, for my brother was
ugly when in liquor, but If it is proved
that the 'kid' v/as killed in cold blood as
this little girl (meaning his sister-in-law)
says, I'll fix Gillespie all right." -
The inquest will be held on Saturday
Corporal George W.' Russell yesterday
made drawings of the scene of the mur
der for use at the trial.
Mrs. Griffin tells another story. She de
nies the knife incident, and declares that
Glllespie held his pistol pointed at her
husband's head for fully five minutes*
that Griffin v was seated in a rocking-chair
laughing at his landlord. She crossed the
room, she says, and pulled Glllespie's
hand in. which he held the gun down to
his side. She (then walked over to the
bureau just in time to see In the mirror
the reflection â¢ of a flash. Her husband
never moved again. She denies the abuse
of Mrs. Gillespie, and declares the intru
sion of the Gillespies to have been un
warranted. She admits, the quarrel with
her husband and the breaking of the
dishes, "but the dishes were ours " she
said, "and the quarrel none of the Gilles
pies' business."
J. H. Griffin, a brother of the deceased,
declares that he will avenge his brother's
death. He called at the City Prison yes
terday with this end in view. He gave a
false name but was recognized by one of
the prison officials and denied the inter
view he sought.
Stories of the Shooting Disagree.
Gillespie says that on the night of the
shooting his wife went to the Griffins'
room, attracted by the sound of loud
voices and breaking dishes. He heard
Griffin call Mrs. Gillespie a foul name,
and decided to take a hand himself. Grif
fin .ordered him out, saying, "Gillesp,
get out of this; I'm in earnest.
If you don't go I'll fix you so you won't
be able," went to a closet and secured a
-large knife. Gillespie says:
"I got out as quickly as I could, went
to my room and secured my revolver,
after which I returned. Griffin still had
the knife, and when I pointed the gun at
him laughed at me and told me I would
never shoot. He half-sat in a chair, and
then put his hand in his pocket to get his
pistol, as I thought. I raised my revolver
and in my excitement it was exploded. I
was the most surprised person in the
room when I saw the result."
told him that she could stand Griffin's
abuse no . longer and she was going to
leave him. She paid the ! rent for the

If she left he would return the unearned

court. It will be treated as is usual In cases

of challenge before courts-martial and courts
of Inquiry shall be exercised. . ' -

from the minds of Liberals any. doubts
that they might have, authorized Presi

declined the privilege and agreed that a

QUITO, Ecuador, Aug. 21.â It is false
that any Invasion of Colombia has been
attempted by Ecuadorans. Colombia and
Ecuador are at peace with each other.
Dr. Silva received a mail from Colom
bia to-day and as it contained no con
firmation of the press reports^ concerning
the trouble on-'the Venezuelati and Ecua
doran frontiers he is Inclined to believe
that the seriousness of the situation has
been exaggerated. â¢Â¦
( No Invasion by Ecuadorans.
Dr. Silva, the Colombian Minister, takes
a very hopeful view of the situation and
does not believe that there is serious
danger of revolutionary attacks upon the
railroad trains. He said this evening
that while it was true that the guards
had been with-rawn from the trains,
there were Colombian troops at stations
along the line, and it was very improb
able that the revolutionists would attack
the railroad in any way. He does not
think it will be necessary for the United
States to land men, but he believes that
the presence of American ships on both
sides . of the isthmus will have an excel
lent effect and will tend to deter the rev
olutionists and guerrillas from action that
would bring them into conflict with the
United States^ as well, as with Colombian
soldiers. . :
In view of the information conveyed in
this dispatch the 1 , authorities here are
satisfied that no mistake was made in
hurrying warships to both sides of - the
Isthmus. "With no American ships Â¦ at
hand there would be danger of a possi
bility of some European nation landing
men on the excuse that they were need
ed to protect passengers of their nation
ality traveling across the isthmus.
Warships May Be Weeded.
Acting Secretary of State Adee received
a cablegram to-day from H. A. Gudger,
United States Consul General, at Pan
ama, which indicates that there has been
no substantial improvement in the situa
tion and that the Colombian forces on
the ground are probably hot strong
enough to rid the country of the revolu
tionists. Gudger' s dispatch, which was
dated August 12, says that there has
been no change in the political situation
on the isthmus so far. as < he can observe
since his last report, that the revolution
ists are still within a short distance of
the railroad line and that the Govern
ment has thus far made no effort to dis
lodge them for a week^preceding his re
port. A guard of fifty men had been
sent out with each passenger train, but
at the time of writing the guards had
been withdrawn owing to representa
tions made by the railroad company that
their presence might invite attacks on
the trains.

was raw and biting. Spectators there
were none, but as play progressed and
the sun strove desperately to lighten the
scene nearly two hundred interested on
lookers followed the pair. At the end of
eighteen holes Maud and Sears "halved"
at thirty-six, two under bogie for these
links. On two occasions Sears holed with
two. good enough golf to win anywhere.
Unfortunately for Sears in driving for the
thirteenth hole the guttapercha ball fell
In the bunker and from that time on his
play was ragged and unsteady. Rlsrht on
top of this bit of misfortune in driving
from the next tee the ball sailed off the
course and was lost. Maud, playing with
the precision of clockwork In a manner
that was evidently aggravating to his op
ponent, at this stage had the advantage of
one up. The score he rolled along to five

Sam Hartiv Was Beaten.
. Local tennis enthusiasts were greatly
surprised to learn that Sam Hardy, one
of the best players on the, coast, was de
feated up north in the tournament for
the championship of the Northwest.
Hardy met hÂ»s Waterloo at the hands of
R. Powell of Victoria. Not only waa
Hardv beaten but he failed to win even a
2 e ,*- o T he score In Powell's favor was 7-3,
6-3. 8-4.
Â¦ When Hardy went north it looked to bÂ©
easy going, as Freeman, the only, man
who seemed tojiave a chance againat
him, dislocated his shoulder and was un
able to play. Powell Dlayed on the local
courts last winter and his showing there
would entitle him to a third class rank
ing here George Whiffy and Smith beat
him with ease and hi3 improvement in
the last year must have been remarkable
to beat a man of Hardv's ability.
Wright took the first game of the next
set and had his opponent to two all.
Lamed then got one of his brilliant
streaks and ran a lead of 4 â 2. Wright
made a beautiful stand in the next and
took It on well played shots. He mado
one more stand with the score 5â3 against
him. but could not do much. Larned play
ing as brilliantly as ever and taking: the
set. Câ 4, and the lead of set, 2 to 1.
Wright took the first two games of-thÂ»
fourth set, Larned beincr a little off In hla
direction. The Summit crack reversed
the story In the third game, but lost the
fourth after making a good. flght for it.
Larned pulled the next out of a bad hoiÂ©
and took courage from the performance,
running four eames In quick succession,
makinjr it 5â3 In his favor. Wright made
a great stand at this point and took one
eame and forced the next to deuce twice
Larned took it. however, and the match.
6-2; Â«-Â». Â«â Â». Â«-4. This makes Larned
national chamninn and the seventh to hold
the honor. There win be no challenge
match as Whitman defaults.
Lamed started the second set with a bit
of unsteady playing, making three double
faults in the opening game, which went
to Wright after fourteen points had been
played. The next alao he got on his own
service, but Larned began to pick up, tak
ing the third at fifteen and the fourth,
after deuce. Thla made the games even
at two all. The odd one went to the older
man at love on his own service. Hla
smashing was a great factor. "Wright
evened it, and though Larned had a lead
of 40â0 at the seventh, he pulled up and
took it and the lead after deuce twice.
Larned took the eighth and it was four
all. Each lost a game on hla service and
then each won a love one on his opening
stroke. Wright then bunched the two
necessary ones and took the set, 8 â 6,
making it one set all.

Lamed was the victor to-day in the final
contest, for the national lawn tennis cham
pionship, defeating Beals C. Wright In an
interesting serie3 of games. Lamed took
the opening game of the match by the
most aggressive play. The second game
was a long deuce one. the call coming five
times before Lamed took it, aided con
siderably by Wright's two double faults.
In the third Wright took a brace and
scored a love game, Lamed taking a turn
at double faulting. After that Lamed
got the young Bostonian on the run and
allowed him only one more game, thÂ©
sixth.

deputies were stationed at the track when
the crowd beg-an to arrive in the after

Word was conveyed to the Delmar track'
and the Sheriff and his deputies brought

withdrew. Constable Lmhart remained
outside after his posse departed and was
allowed to enter the grounds. He was
unable to serve his warrants on the Sher

he had left the documents in the care of
a member of the posse. When he with

The Martins are a most 'unmarried-like
couple. There Is nothing honeymoony
about them, nor yet is there the easy fa
miliarity that characterizes the pair
whose honeymoon has waned. They are
very correct toward one another. There
is an elegant formality about their greet
ings and moments of tete-a-tete conver
sations. Perhaps that is the reason why
all Mrs. Martin's friends persist in al
luding to her as Mary Scott and why the
secretary made the mistake of calling her
Another late arrival was "Walter Mar
tin. He came speeding along on his wheel
and made a dash to reach the side of his
brJde, fearful lest he would be too late
to see her "drive."" I But he was many
minutes too soon and he employed his
time in doing the gallant and hunting
around for a bit of string to tie back the
cuff of Miss Hager's rolled up sleeve. He
was ready with his camera when Mrs.
Martin took her club in hand. The young
husband Is authority for the statement
that, he is positive he got a splendid pic
ture. ;

DEI> MONTE. Aug. 21.â As. early
as half past 8 this morning the
crowd sought the golf links to
watch the final game for the
golf championship. It was an
energetic crowd and followed the players
around the links. The ladles were in the
minority at that early hour, but by W
o'clock, when the golfers of the gentler
sex stood ready to begin the qualifying
game, there was a splendid gathering on
hand.
Mrs. Gllman Brown was the last one
to reach the links. She had an air of
confidence about her and there was a glit
ter of determination in her eyes, i The first
one to greet Mrs. Brown was Miss Caro
Crockett. There was a cordial handshake,
which was all the more conspicuous see
ing that the ultra-fashionables here have
decided against the palm to palm salute.
A nod on the part of the lady, a low
courtesy from 'the gentleman who holds
his hands behind his back. Is the sanc
tioned fashionable greeting.

VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 21.â Mate Ne
routzo3 of the lost steamship Islander
this morning filed with Captain Gaudin.
local agent of the Dominion Marine and
Fisheries. Department, a formal report of
"the disaster, upon which an inquiry will
be held. The report is practically a re
quest for an inquiry and contains no new
details beyond giving- the . exact spot
where the ship went down and an esti
mate of the loss of life and the number
saved: He estimates that the number lost
Â¦was forty- two and the number saved 143.
The' scene of the wreck is given as Point
Hilda, six and a quarter 'miles west by
south, three-quarters south, magnetic.
Some .interest . has been manifested in
the course which was followed on the
fatal morning, and In this connection it is
said that the pilot followed the identical
course upon which, the Islander sailed on
Â¦the previous. trip. A comparison with the
log of Captain Foote on prior , trips shows
that there^ was no deviation.
The quaVtermaster, a moment before
the' collision, had put his wheel over one
point,, so as to bring his ship into 'more
of a mid-channel track than 'by following
that upon which ' he was then sailing.
Had the Islander held on her -way for
three minutes longer she would 'have
probably cleared the obstacle which sent
her . forty fathoms deep. . ' ' â¢ Â¦ . Â»â¢ .
â¢ In this connection an interesting story
was told to one of the passengers by. the
captain of the * Juneau steamer Flossie,
which subsequently rescued the survivors.
He says that the Flossie passed over the
same waters as those on which the
Â¦ Islander was wrecked early in the. after
noon preceding- the ..catastrophe. ~ Its
navigator was looking for large bergs,
when suddenly he saw right ahead a low
lying one with its surface a little more*
than flush with the surface of the sea.
The course of the Flossie -was altered just
in time to save her from contact, with
the submerged mountain of ice. One. of
â¢the officers afterward remarked to the
captain what a perilous thing it consti
tuted, lying right in the track of the
Skaguay liners, and predicted that it
would bring some of them to grief.

Old Brig Rio Loge Being Used in
"Labor" Trade.
One- of the last of the old full-rigged
brigs is now being used in the "labor"
trade in the Southern Seas. The Olga
whs the last seen on this coast and she
was lost in Bering Sea many years ago.
The L-urline, Galilee and half a dozen
others now trading from San Francisco
are generally called brigs, but they are
really brigantines. The vessel in ques
tion is the Rio Loge and she has just com
pleted a voyage of 3000 miles among the
islands of the Southern Seas in search
of labor for the Queensland sugar planta
tions. She has been for years in the ser
vice, but proved slow, so her owners sent
her to the Union Gas Engine Company of
San Francisco and secured two thirty-two
Â»horsepower gasoline engines. . Three
months ago these were put Into the Rio
Loge and yesterday she arrived at
Queensland with a full load of laborers,
nearly two months before she was ex
pected. The Rio Loge is probably the
only vessel of her kind afloat. She is a
full-rigged brig and has auxiliary twin
screws, propelled by California gasoline
machinery. She is not a large craft, be
ing only 241 tons net, 122 feet 3 inches long,
24 feet 7 inches beam and 12 feet 8 inches
deep, and was built of iron In Glasgow In
1S69.
THE LAST OF HEB KIND. '
Of course. In entering into this agree
ment the Southern Pacific is violating
the injunction Issued by the Superior
Court at the company's request- It is
also violating its faith with the Eastern
roads that route business over its rails.
Moreover, it is making the public and
the various big societies that convene
here from time to time innocent parties
to the deception by getting- them,
through their chambers of commerce and
various committees, to promulgate reso
lutions indorsing its policy. But the
scheme is a paying one: so what Is the
difference?
Ottinger seems to have realized the
chance given him. He has consolidated
his offices at Los Angeles. San Francis
co. Seattle. Spokane and Salt Lake with
those of 'Wasserman at St. Louis and
Chicago. Straub at Denver and Burnet
& Kelsko at New Orleans, and is pre
paring, with the assistance of the South
ern Pacific Company, to take charge of
the entire ticket-scalping business of the
West.
This nice arrangement not only shuts
out every broker from doing what little
business he might pick up despite the
injunction issued against the scalping of
Epworth tickets, but turns the whole
tickef-scalp!ng business of the entire
"West into the hands of Ottinger. What
the profits to Ottinger will be can only
he surmised. He will gain by what the
Southern Pacific allows him for the re
turn of the detached coupon, by the dif
ference of the price of that coupon and
thp price at which he bought it. and the
difference of the price at which he pur
chased the validated portion of the ticket
and the sum at which he again sells it
ovpr the Eastern road. Moreover. he
v.ill have the entire field to himself, as
the other brokers through this arrange
ment and the injunction concerning Ep
worth tickets are entirely shut out from
all opportunity .of doing any business
â¢whatever.
All Other Brokers Are Shut Out.
By this system the Southern Pacific
people are assured of receiving back at
least a portion of iheir share of the prof
it? on all tickets sold over any part
of their read. The Eastern read that or
iginally issued the ticket is left to look
after itself and has to stand the entire
brunt of the business done by Ottinger
on the validated portion of the ticket that
i? sold eastward over its lines after the
Southern Pacific coupon is detached.
To illustrate the manner In which the
scheme will work one has merely to take
an Epworth ticket for example. Say. a
passenger bought one of these tickets
from Chicago to San Francisco and re
turn and paid $50 for it. After arriving 1
at San Francisco he decides to remain
longer than the specified time and wants
to get rid of his certificate of transpor
tation. He takes it to Ottinger, who
buys it at something less than its re
maining value of $25. Then Ottinger does
business with the Southern Pacific, .re
ceiving from that corporation a certain
proportion of its share of the profits and
the ticket back with the Southern Pa
citic coupon detached. The ticket is then
validated and sold for whatever it will
bring over its line east of Ogden. Should
the owner of the ticket refuse the price
offered by Ottinger, that gentleman takes
a description of it and turns the descrip
tion in to the Southern Pacific people.
The conductors on every train are fur
nished with a blacklist composed of these
ticket descriptions and should the pass
pert be scalped by any other broker, the
unlucky purchaser will be detected as
peon as he presents it and put off the
train at the next station. "
How the Scheme Is Worked.
They claim that Ottinger has formed a
combination with J. C. Stubbs and E. O.
McCormick by which the Southern Pa
cific Company guarantees to purchase
from him its portion of all tickets scalped
by Ottinger or his agents and to validate
the balance of the ticket in consideration
of Ottinger acting as spotter and bullet
ining ail tickets onered for sale. By this
means the Southern Pacific protects it
self and offers a good thing to Ottinger,
tnougn in so doing it violates its agiee
ment with all the roads east of its sys
tem, save those that torm a part of the
Harrtaan syndicate. This agreement
does not apply alone to Epworth tickets.
Tickets of every description are embraced
in the agreement between the Southern
Pacific omcials and the broker. The prof
its to the broker promise to be so large
that he is organizing a company with a
capital of $2(X.',000 to control the business
which he expects to get.
The local ticket brokers are very much
incei*ed over what they term the crook
edness cf A. Ottinger and the Southern
Pacific Company. The trouble originat
ed in the scalping of Epworth League
tickets. The brokers now claim that,
notwithstanding the injpnetion that was
sued out against them by the Southern
Pacific people last month, that company
and Ottinger together are doing more
scalping than all the brokers in the city
combined.

trils of decency. These are strong terms; (but : riot
too strong, for .the odor of this crime against civili

The letter refers, directly to the recent lynching, at
Carrpllton, of which town Mr. Bingham is a resi
dent. He asserts that his observation . of the affair
led him to believe that not one citizen of Carrollton
had anything to do with it. The lynchers came in
from the country. The Sheriff, says the writer, is "a
man advanced in years; he is and always has been
a man of peace; neither by nature nor by training
was he prepared â¢ for such an emergency as arose"
when the mob came upon him. Proceeding then to
Â¦deal with the cause of thc-crime- he says: "Many
persons, including some officers, did not "think
troops should be asked for, nor that opposition to
the mob should be carried to the extent of using
force; they held that erroneous view under' the r mis
taken sentiment that. 3 white man should not be hurt
by officers in protecting a negro criminal.", '
We recently directed attention to a speech made by
ex-Governor Jones in the Alabama constitutional
convention denouncing lynch' law and advocating the
summary removal of any Sheriff or other officer who'
permitted a mob to take a prisoner from his hands.
Since that time another Southern man, J. R. Bing
ham of Mississippi, has. written a public letter on the
subject and has attempted to account, for the evil.
Mr. Bingham does not give even a passing notice to
the plea that the offenses of the criminals who are
lynched are so vile that the wretches ; merit death
without trial, even to the extent of putting them to
death by fire. He attributes the whole practice to a
breaking down of respect for law.
ONE of the best signs of a possible improve
ment in the relation between the two races
in the Southern States is the number of ear
nest and influential Southern men who have come
forward to protest against lynch law and to rouse
the dominant elements of the white population to
unite in a resolute effort to starnp it out.- -
THE CAUSE OF LYNCH LAW.
It is a" curious feature of our politics that" no one
actually holding a Senatorial position has ever been
elected President, for- the fact that so many retired*
Senators. have been elected shows that the Senate is
a very good place in which to make a reputation that
puts one into the ranks of Presidential aspirants. The
list of Senators who attained that rank and yet failed
to reach the coveted prize is even more notable. than
that of those' who won it after leaving the Senate.^,. It
includes the names of Burr, Crawford, Webster, Cal
houn, Clay, Cass, Dallas, Douglas, Thurman,.'Hen
dricks, Blaine, Sherman, Conkling, Cameron, Lo
gan; Edmunds and Bayard. Other names hardly less,
illustrious than some of those .' given imight be added.

A considerable number of Presidents had served in
the Senate before elected to the Presidency. The list
as given in the Philadelphia Record begins with
James Monroe, who was Senator previous to Â¦' 1800,
and was not" elected President, until 1816. John
Quincy Adams, was the next, having been a Senator
from 1803 to 1809; but he was not chosen President
untili825. His successor, Andrew^ Jackson, was Sen
ator from' Tennessee from 1823 to 1825, and was
elected President Jn 1828. Martin Van Buren was
Senator from 1821 to 1828, and was elected President
in 1836.. , William Henry Harrison was a Senator
from Ohio from 1825 to 1828, but was not chosen
President until 1840â twelve years later. John Tyler
was Senator from Virginia from 1827 to 1836. He
was elected Vice President, in 1840? and succeeded to
the Presidency on the death of Harrison. Franklin
Pierce was a Senator from New Hampshire from' 1837
to 1842, but wa's not elected President until 1852.
James Buchanan was a Senator from Pennsylvania
frqm 1834 to 1845, and was elected President in 1856
Andrew Joknson was a Senator from Tennessee from
1857 to 1863. He was elected Vice President in 1864,
and succeeded to the Presidency upon. the death of
Lincoln, in April, 1865. Garfield became President
on the day he would have taken his seat in the Sen
ate. Benjamin Harrison's. one term in the Senate ex
pired March 4, 1887, just two years before he: was
inaugurated as 'President. ' -t/3
BY reason of the dullness of politics at this season
one of the clever^ writers at Washington has
found time to look up the records of Senators
who aspired to the Piesidency, and has compiled an
interesting review of the subject. His paper is based
upon the supposed. aspirations of Senators Allison,
Fairbanks, Cullom, Foraker, Spooner and .Hanna to
obtain, the succession to McKinley. He recalls the
popular saying that no- Senator has ever been elected
to the .Presidency, and finds it to be true to the ex
tent that no man has ever been elected President
while an active member of the Senate. Garfield, in
deed, was Senator-elect from Ohio when elected
President, but he had not taken his seat.

scenic standpoint. Dado in the title part

â¢ In a summary of the results obtained by the ex
periments it is stated that while it is evidently some
what cheaper to cook the food at home, yet there
may be conditions under. which it would be as cheap
to have it done outside. An increased demand for
ready cooked food would naturally result in a more
abundant supply of it, and a supply of a better qual
ity. Hence the investigators conclude by saying:
"When arrangements for delivering food' hot and
ready to serve arc perfected it may be found entirely
feasible to*" adopt this method of providing", for the
family table, and one feature of the domestic problem
will be solved."
By the experiments made in the cost of cooking
meat it was shown that "the actual cost of cooked
turkey, exclusive of fuel, labor, stuffing-. and other in
gredients, after substracting the market trimming,
cleaning and loss of weight due to cooking, aver
aged 20.513 cents per pound. The cost of stuffing,
etc., and cooking averaged 3.246 cents per pound as
purchased." The report adds: "The items for fuel
and labor might be deducted from the total cost of
cooking the article at home under the conditions
mentioned in the bread experiments.* That would of
course lessen the cost of the home production. At
an average cost of 23.749 cents per pound the home*
cooked turkey is still cheaper than that bought ready
cooked for 35 cents per pound."
Owing to the length of time required to obtain
accurate data for comparison for any one food, the
investigations whose results are embodied in the re
port were limited to breads and meats. Of the. first
the report says: "The average cost of producing one
pound of bread, including the cost of materials, fuel
and labor, is 5.865 cents. .The' cost of one pound,
not, including labor, is 3,72 cents. The cost of one
pound not including either labor or fuel, but merely
the cost of materials, is 2.942 cents. The ordinary*
five-cent loaf of baker's bread does not weigh a'
pound. The average of eleven loaves taken from
three different bakeries was 14.4 ounces. Hence the
cost of a pound of baker's bread is somewhat higher,
more than the cost of a loaf. A pound of baker's
bread costs 5.55 cents, which is 315 thousandths'of a
cent less than a home-made pound costs when the
cost of both labor and fuel is considered.".. It is
noted, however, that if the fuel has to be used in any
case and the labor is employed by the week and is
available for bread-making without loss of time, it
would be slightly cheaper to make bread at home
than to buy it.
The report of the work of this committee, is de
vcted mainly to the results obtained by a' scientific
study of the problem of the preparation of food in
or out of the house. In Boston, as in San Francisco
and other large cities, it is possible at the present
time to obtain ready cooked food of almost all kinds,
and it was with that supply the home-cooked food
was put into competition. The investigation was in
trusied to Miss Gertrude Bigelow and was carried
out by making experiments as to the cost of material,
the cost of labor, the cost of fuel, the cost of wear
and tear of equipment and of 'waste. It was not
found possible to make a comparison with respect
to the quality of the fcod, because, as the report says:
"There are as yet no accepted standards. Persons
disagree widely, their choice resting mainly on ac
quired taste, or preferences formed after Continued
use of certain kinds of food." %
ACCORDING to the August issue of the Mas
sachusetts Labor Bulletin the committee on
domestic service of the Boston branch of thfc
Association of Collegiate Alumnae decided in ti8o8
that the solution of the domestic problem lay not in
work with the individual domestic employe but in the
evolution of housekeeping, and accordingly it set
about studying the possibility of having more house
work done outside the home. The domestic service
committee was therefore transformed into a com
mittee on domestic science, and investigations were
started to find out the comparative cost of laundry
work, cleaning and cooking when done by outsiders
or by domestic servants. . Â»

PERSONAL MENTION.
"Lady Huntworth's Experiment" is
proving a much more popular bill at the
Columbia Theater this week than any-in
trinsic merit of the play warrants. But
the good acting -of several members of
the Daniel Frohman. company, that have
the play in charge, serves to redeem
somewhat, the comedy's inherent weak
ness. Next week another comedy by R.
C. Carton will be presented, '.'Wheels
Within Wheels," which is said to offer
much happier opportunity to Miss Hilda
Spong, the beautiful leading lady of the
company, as well as to the other clever
folk in the- organization. "Wheels Within
Wheels" has. enjoyed long runs in many
Eastern cities, including New York, Bos
ton, Chicago and Philadelphia. Annie
"Barbara Frietchie," the most popular
bill of the Neill season at the California
Theater, is having a successful revival
this week. Crowded houses have greeted
the pretty play, and the wisdom of the re
vival has been amply justified. Edythe
Chapman in the title role is her most
charming self, and Mr. Nelll makes out
strongly in the part of Captain Trumbull.
The play is well costumed and effectively
staged. "Rosemary," John Drew's big
success, will follow.- . jt Â¦

White Whittlesey and Miss Roberts, of
course, appear In their .well-remembered

It is to be noted in this connection that the ChinesÂ©
immigration question is not now a Pa
cific Coast issue. The number of Chinese in the East
is increasing rapidly. ( There is. already a considerable
colony. of them in New York and another in Boston,
and it was recently found that a large number of
them make their way,, into the country across the
Canadian border into New : .York or New England.
It is accordingly evident that an extreme watchful
ness'will have to be kept over the working of every
clause in a treaty that gives to the Chinese any^ right
whatever to 'enter the country, i
For the purpose of checking this evil the treasury
officials, it is announced, have decided to take advan
tage of the proviso in ''the treaty that stipulates that
they shall be satisfied of the good faith of the China
man seeking to go through the United States to a
foreign country, and instructions will be sent the offi
cials at San Francisco "jto require that eÂ£ch ChinamanÂ«
claiming Mexico as 'his destination shall establish
his good faith. If the Chinaman is under contract to
perform labor in Mexico he may present his contract
as evidence of good faith, but in case of his failure to
satisfy the officials he will not be permitted to land..
It is said that during the. last few years many thou
sands of Chinese have been landed at. this; or other
American ports under alleged contracts- to work on
plantations and railroads in Mexico. They have been
permitted to pass in accord withthe terms of. the
treaty to that effect, but investigation- on the part of
the treasury officials has brought to light the fact
that hardly ip per cent of them ever reach the points
to which they are ticketed. It is said they leave the
trains near the northern border of Mexico and in a
short time reach the United States and scatter over
the country. '-â¢ .T
REPORTS from Washington are to ; the effect
that the officials of the Treasury Department
have long been of. the bpjnion that Chinese
are taking undue advantage of the j law -which ' allows
them to pass through the_ United States when oh
their way to some foreign country, and that instead
of going to their alleged destination' they manage by
one means or another to remain in "the United States;
or to return to it. "'Â¦ .â¢'.-.- .â¢

"Men and "Women" Is the play
this week, and is pleasing: laige audiences
at the uptown house. Annette Marshall,
the new leading lady, has made a favor-
There are many instances that might be studied
with profit by public officers who interfere when
business men invoke the law to protect their prop
erty.
The strike may be over in a week or it may last
a year. Whatever its duration the friendliest act
toward all parties concerned in it is the restraint of
their passion and the prevention of widespread dis
order. The industries and business of the city are
bound to suffer any way, and in. some lines will be
permanently impaired. To the extent to which they^
suffer, either permanently or temporarily,, the labor- .
ing men themselves will suffer with the rest of the
community. If to this inevitable effect be added the
consequences of disorder and riot there will follow
an increase of injury that will be serious. It has
been the uniform testimony of strikers after a strike
is over that their best friends were those Â¦ who re- ,
strained their excesses, and their worst enemies
those who encouraged them to violence. The public
officer who appears, as this Supervisor has, in oppo
sition to the means of enforcing the law and pro
tecting life and property, as a rule gets no benefit
from his violation of duty. ' In the railroad strike
1 of 1894 the Sheriffs of Sacramento and Alameda
counties were especially . subservient to the strikers
and permitted them to go to all sorts of excesses.
The Sheriff of San Joaquin County and the Chief of
Police -of the town cf Alameda, on the other" hand,
bravely did their duty and protected property against
the mistaken zeal and temper of the strikers. At the.
election which followed the two truckling Sheriffs
were badly beaten, the ex-strikers cutting them every
where, while the San Joaquin Sheriff was re-elected
and the Alameda Chief of Police is now Sheriff of
his county.
But. be this as it may, the citizens who have-asked
for special police are not paying the till for pastime
or to make a point against anybody. They are by
law the judges of the necessity. The law fixes the
steps necessary to be taken, and it is merely a dema
gogic play with fire for this Supervisor to attempt a
roundabout nullification of the law and the right it
gives the citizen by adding to the cost of the enjoy
ment of that right. '
All men know thatthe heat which brings a man to
that depth of inhumanity is not far from the temper
ature of murder.
An incident like that shows a bitterness that is un
known in battle and between the members of clash
ing armies. No soldier refuses to succor a wounded
THE reputation of San Francisco' for law and
order should not be imperiled. The law pro
vides for the appointment of special policemen,
with the authority of regulars, to protect person and
property, and to be paid by those who require such
protection. As the citizens who ask for the benefits
of this law are supposed to know whether they need
protection and as they pay the bill, it is unbecoming
in any public officer to obstruct or burden the means
by which they are protected. Such obstruction is the
ordinance offered by a member of the Board of Su
pervisors compelling specials to be uniformed like
regulars. This is intended to so increase the ex
pense of protection that many cannot afford it, with
the possible result of bringing on riots and the loss of
life and property. Daily events in this city support
the demand of the citizens who ask the protection
for which they are willing to pay. The unwise and
intensely inflammatory appeals made by individuals
and in the press have put life and property in peril.
When feeling has reached such a pitch of bitter in
humanity that a hack driver, refuses to take to his
home a man sorely and perhaps fatally wounded by.
an accident aboard ship because he did not belong to
a 'union, and leaves him perhaps to die in the street,
it is useless to insist that everything is peaceable.

might have been 'convinced that lynch lawj was re

been lynched for petty stealing or other offenses
hardly much grosser, and it has been! found impos
sible to get juries to convict the lyrrchers. It is there
fore not a spirit of race prejudice only but one of
lawlessness that the South has to combat. The fight
will be difficult, but it can be won if the Southern
leaders are true to their people. Every : such plea as
that made by Mr. Bingham. is an influence for good,

.The class for deaf and dumb children
was ordered established in .the Harrison
School. It will be opened on August 26
and placed In charge of Mrs. Holden, who
will receive a salary of $75 per month. Sho
will have fourteen pupils in her class.
A new class will be formed in the Irv

A resolution providing that a substitute
appointed for six or more months shall
draw full pay for the position occupied
was adopted.
M. E. Blanchard was temporarily re
lieved from his position in the Lowell
High School and placed in charge' of the
Hancock School.
That the board turns the cold shoulder
on teachers in the department and Is par
tial to strangers with influence was dem
onstrated in the transfer of W. H. de Bell
from the princlpalship of the Hancock
School rb that of the Spring Valley School.
Bell is a new recruit from the university,
but has been favored to the exclusion of
older educators in the department, not
withstanding the boasted predilection of
the board for the merit system. .
Board Partial to Strangers.
Superintendent Webster was not pres
ent at the meeting of the board yester
day, as he was busy preparing his an
nual report. No date. was set for the
trial, but a letter * was read from Miss
Hurley, principal of. the Sherman School,
in which Miss Dwyer was teacher.^ , In
the communication Miss Hurley alleges
that Miss Dwyer is possessed of an un
governable temper and asks that in. the
interest of harmony " she be transferred
to some other school. It is interesting to
note that in her report on the efficiency
or Inefficiency of her teachers, filed with
Superintendent Webster on June 20, Miss
Hurley wrote that Miss Dwyer was
"satisfactory as a teacher and satisfac
tory as a disciplinarian." Miss Hurley
at the same time made a plea for Miss
Dwyer's transfer because of her alleged
ungovernable temper and her proneness
to dictate to her principal. Miss Dwyer
was subsequently transferred to the
Irving School by resolution of the board,
which has never been rescinded. After a.
perfunctory investigation the president of
the board suspended Miss Dwyer.
Principal Hurley begged Superintendent
Webster, to let the matter "drop, as â¢ she
had not asked for Miss Dwyer's dismissal,
but only for her transfer. Â¦ On the utter
failure of the prosecution to establish that
Miss Dwyer had been guilty of unprofes
sional conduct or conduct unbefitting a
teacher, Webster, after an exhaustive In
vestigation, refused to prefer charges. The
board is bent on ousting the teacher, how
ever, and has condemned her beforehand,
as it did In the case of. Miss McKenzle.
In fact, at the conclusion of the prelimin
ary investigation Director Kincaid was
much put out because Webster would not
prefer the charges, saying, "Why, can't
you see that she is guilty?" Another prin
cipal has > been pressed into service in the
prosecution of Miss Dwyer. C. B. Bar
low, principal of the Irving School, sent
a .letter to the board yesterday stating
that Miss Dwyer taught in his school dur
ing, the Barrington board's regimg and
that she was then possessed of a temper.
Â¦ , The \ Board of Education has been de
tected in a barefaced attempt to railroad
Miss Jean A. Dwyer, a teacher in the de-
partment, out of her position. Notwith
standing the fact that Superintendent
Webster, who Is clothed by the charter
with the power to investigate charges
against a teacher, has notified the board
that no one has yet been found to stand
by the. charges against Miss' Dwyer, the
board will proceed to try her on its own
account. '

Lyons & Co. state that in no way will
they assume responsibility for the mon
eys advanced to Stanley by those from
whom he took orders, that being a matter
which Lyons & Co. say only affects Stan
ley and those from whom he "borrowed."
At Ukiah it is said that Stanley decided
to become cowboy. He engaged in nu
merous fights in true cowboy style and
finally, reports state, he fell 'into the
hands of the country constable for bad
riding, which resulted in the loss of a
front porch to one of the town hotels.
Finally E. G. Lyons & Co. located Stan
ley by phone at Willetts, ordered him to
return the team to Santa Rosa and send
in his resignation. Stanley took the team
to Santa Rosa, as directed, and since then
he has not been seen by his employers.
Two months ago Stanley was directed
by his employers to "make" the moun
tain route through Lake and Mendocino
counties. His employers say- that he
"made" the route and while making it
"went the route." He hired a team at
Santa Rosa and drove away into the wil
derness of hills and vales. Finally his
employers say the only evidence they had
that he was still "working" was that
bank drafts for his expenses constantly
arrived. It was decided to locate Stanley
by telephone. Orders for goods, E. G.
Lyons & Co. aver, came in with a state
ment to the effect that a portion of the
money due the firm on the orders had
been advanced to Stanley.
L. H. Stanley, drummer by occupation,
cowboy for fun, has, upon request, sev
ered his connection with the firm of E. G.
Lyons & Co., wholesale liquor dealers, 549
Mission street. Stanley's connection with
the firm lasted only six weeks, but It is
said they were full of joyâ for Stanley.

HAPPY COUPLE WHO WERE
MARRIED IN THIS CITY LAST
EVENING.
DRUMMER STANLEY HAS

CAPTAIN JOHN MBTCALFE and
Mrs. Annie Cave North were
quietly married in the main parlor
of the Palace Hotel last night.
None but the immediate relatives
and friends of the bride and groom were
present and after the ceremony the
happy couple left for Vancouver, B. C,
whence they will go to Banff to spend the
honeymoon. On their return Captain
and Mrs. Metcalfe will reside at 2319 Cen
tral avenue.
Captain Metcalfe came here In 1S75 as
master of the White Star liner Oceanic.
The vessel was under charter to the Oc
cidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany and Captain Metcalfe ran her be
tween here and Hongkong until 1889. He
then retired from the sea and has since
represented Lloyd's in this city. Mrs.
North formerly lived at Menlo Park, but
latterly, has made her home in this city
with her mother. She and Captain Met
calfe , are old friends, so their marriage
does not come as a great surprise to their
acq uaintances.
The ceremony was performed last even
ing by the Rev. Dr. Gardiner of Palo Alto.
The noise on the boss bench has sub
sided since it became known that many
more independent Anti-boss delegates
were elected to the Republican convention
than the first estimates gave. . The cer
tainty of formidable opposition from the
Labor party will cause both the old par
ties to throw overboard the dead weight
of bossism and put in the race clean
tickets. The election promises to become
so important that a vote approximating
the full registration of 75,000 will be cast.
The shouting and the tumult disturb not
Boss Martin Kelly, who is preparing his
great speech to the Republican conven
tion. Herrin, Lynch and the smaller bosses
of the alliance grow green with envy
when they fancy Kelly at the head of his
delegation responding to the first name
on the roll of the convention.
General E. S. Salomon and Frank Mc-
Gowan are candidates for the nomination
for District Attorney on the Republican'
ticket. Mr. McGowan is pretty certain of
the support of the Grand Hotel party,
which elected five delegates to the con
vention. The bosses have on the slate
ex-As&emblyman Arthur Fisk, the Ex
aminer'* Republican candidate. '
The leading candidates for Mayor in the
Republican party are Judge Bahrs, Audi
tor Wells. Charles L. Patton, Charles S.
Laumeister and Henry J. Crocker. Men
tion is made of Harbor Commissioner
Kirkpatrick, but there is no intimation
from Mr. Kirkpatrick or his intimate
friends that he would accept. '
Leading Republican Candidates.
Enthusiastic advocates of the new de
parture in municipal politics claim that
18,000 union members and 10,000 sympa
thizers will vote for the candidates of the
Labor party. Leaders of the new move
ment say that if the ticket is successful
in the local campaign steps will be taken
to extend the organization so that a
ticket for State officers and members of
the Legislature may be placed in .the field
next year. ' -*
The Republican Primary League, which
was supported by -eight thousand two
hundred voters and which elected 127
delegates to the primary on the 13th inst.,
is not relaxing Its efforts to induce voters
to register for the municipal election in
November. The allied bosses in their at
tempt to programme the convention have
bumped up against several solid delega
tions of the league. The headquarters of
the league at 930 Market street are open
daily from 9 a.m. until 10:30 p. m.
It seems to be settled that Eugene E.
Schmitz, president of the Musicians'
Union, will be the Labor party's nominee
for Mayor. A committee consisting of
twenty-five delegates to the convention,
each delegate representing a labor union,
waited on Mr. Schmitz at the Columbia
Theater yesterday afternoon. The politi
cal situation in all its bearings was dis
cussed. At the conference the committee
tendered to Mr. Schmitz the nomination
for Mayor on the Â¦ Labor ticket. He
agreed to accept on the condition that
the nomination should be unanimous as
far as the delegates to the convention
were concerned. Mr. Schmitz is a well
known citizen and a director of the Re
publican Print ary League.
Political gc/Nip in labor circles is to the
effect that Hr*'*V. Hutton, attorney of the
Labor Council, will be nominated for Dis
trict Attorney by the Labor imrty con
vention. For the office of County Clerk,
ex-Assemblyman ' M. M. Coffey is men
tioned. It is said that J. W. McAdams,
secretary of the Labor Council, will be
chairman of the convention, which is
called to meet in Metropolitan Temple at
10 a. m., September 5.
Primary League Still Active.
The list of candidates for the Board of
Supervisors is increasing. Horace Wil
son and George Sanderson are each will
ing td serve another term. New candi
dates in the field are: Charles Stanyan,
J. H. Wllkins, Henry Stern, Joseph
Nightingale and George M. Pefine. Henry
Ste.rn of the Forty-third District is Jake
Shaen's particular friend.
The Thirty-ninth District delegation or
ganized Tuesday night and elected Meyer
Jacobs chairman. The Thirty-eighth
District delegation has elected Al Haacke
chairman. The Forty-flrst District dele
gation will meet this evening at 1922
Broadway and organize. - An effort ' was
mads Tuesday to organize the. Forty-fifth
District delegation, but two members re
fused to go into caucus.
Delegates to the Republican Municipal
Convention talk of giving to each Assem
bly District delegation the right to name
one candidate for the Board of Super
visors. It happens that the number of
Assembly districts in San Francisco â
eighteenâ corresponds with the number of
Supervisors to be chesen. If Martin
Kelly should name a trusted lieutenant In
the rpRrenty-eighth and Sam. Rainey-pre
sent a push statesman from the Forty
fourth the convention would be- expected
to Indorse the district recommendations.

CHICAGO. Aug.' 21. â September wheat opened
unchanged to %c higher at 70@70%c on buying
by Ehorts who had a profit in sight. Light sea
board clearances, heavy receipts and generally
favorable weather soon turned the scale and
on a moderate volume of sales the . market
declined to 63%c. Here the market steadied and
ruled dull for a time under local conditions.
The report of the severance of diplomatic re
lations between Turkey and France later came
to the aid of the bulls. Offerings dwindled to
almost nothing and a small demand from
nervous shorts was sufficient to cause a rally
of lc from the bottom. The close was steady,
September %c over yesterday at 70%c. That
? he foreign diplomatic situation did not cause
a sharper rise was due to the Paris market,
which was considered weak and hence a dam
per on reports of the diplomatic situation
being alarming. The Government report show
ing considerable improvement In crop condi
tions since August 1 had a depressing effect
on values all day. Heavy quantities were
liquidated early and during this movement the
bears embraced the opportunity of taking a
flyer on the short side of Â»the market. The
creation of the latter interest led to a partial
recovery later when wheat turned firm, as the
fihorts were quick to run to cover. September
closed easy, %c. under yesterday, at 57Vic.
â¢ Oats opened easy and ruled easier for a time
in sympathy with wheat and corn. A steadier
tone crept in later in sympathy with the wheat
rally and on a fair general demand from peo
ple who sold yesterday. September closed un
changed at 3.\%c.
Provisions opened easy, sharing in the gen
erally bearish feeling and having the additional
Incentive of heavy hog receipts. There was
only a small speculative interest represented

Chicago Grain Market.
The sales for the week amount to 4.672,000
pounds domestic and 520,000 foreign, making a
total of 5,192,000 pounds, against a total of 12,
935,000 for the previous week and a total of
3,620,000 for the corresponding week last year.
The bulk of. the Territory wool has been pur
chased outright and is in strong hands. The
whole situation, as regards both wool and
goods, looks sound and - healthy. Â¦ -
While the demand for wool during the past
week has been quieter j there has nevertheless
been more than an average business transacted
and prices in all lines have been fully main
tained. The demand -is widely distributed and
it has practically all been for consumption,
there being no speculative tendency observable
as yet. There is a firm undertone to the mar
ket and consumers who attempt to secure wools
at any concessions from present prices do not
succeed in securing wool. The .rank and file
of them are contented, however, to pay current
rates. There Is'no disposition on. the part of
the holders of wool to force the market. '

community of interests. The coming monthly
increase of 10 cents on a ton of anthracite also
counted. The Erie stocks themselves sold off
on account of some unexplained remarks of the
chdirman in his report regarding the approach
of a time when arrangements for capital can'
be made. There was some continued buying
from Western sources of the grain-carrying
roads, which was apparently for short account.
Some revision of pessimistic views regarding
the ccrn Â«;rcp seemed to be the cause of this
covering. The United States Steel stocks were
almost dormant and were merely steady. These
stocks have apparently arrived at a stage
where they are unaffected by. the strike news.
The sterling market resumed its downward
course again to-day and offerings of bills
against grain exports were reported in in
creased supply, with -'a sprinkling of cotton
bills. The continued ease of the London mar
ket for money and the further drop in call
loans there to-day to 1 per cent gives- ground
for some expectation that the Bank of Eng
land rate will be reduced to-morrow.
The railroad bond market was decidedly more
active tc-day, but the tone was steady to firm.
Total sales, par value, 12,213,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Prices of many railroad stocks are EtSlUhigh,
judged by the dividends which they return and
fcy the fact that ceaeral business activity has
touched high-water mark. But this is not the
only inf.aence controlling values at present,
for it should be remembered that the entire
railroad system of the United States Is passing
through a process of centralization that has a
most important bearing upon values. The
grouping of American railroads into a few great
eyettms, which promises to be socn completed,
adds immensely to their stability as invest
ments. Ruinous rate wars are very probably
a thing of the past and roads which have been
doing business at a loss are rapidly entering
the dividend-paying list. Watered stocks have
cither b-Â»en eliminated by reorganization or paid
for in outlays from 'earnings. Our railroads
were never in better physical and financial
conJiticri than to-day, and their prospects as
Cividend-naytrs are excellent. Very few are
paying aii Uicy earn: consequently any mod
erate reduction in gross earnings would not
affect dividends for the reason that the pres
ent large outlays lor new equipment and im
provements, will not be permanent. Conscrv
s t'Fm has been ths rule in railroad manage
ment for the last few years and stockholders
have bÂ«n getting the advantage of this new
policy Plans for railroad consolidation are
xn>t by any means complete. One combination
forces another and the present movement is
not likely to end untii the whole country has
been divided into groups; this being the ulti
mate result predicted years ago by tar-sighted
practical railroad men. This tendency need
cause no concern in the public mind, for suit
able legislation will certainly be devised to
control the powers of these great railroad
magnates. Public ownership of the railroads
would plunge us into a sea of unknown forces.
Â¦National supervision could readily be made
sufficiently effective to prevent corporate
abuses. .
"The future of the market appears somewhat
encouraging. The country is still prosperous;
there is plenty of trafflc in sight for the rail
roads for the balance of this year at least,
end we are likely to have a good export de
mand for our surplus products of the soil.
The farmers as a class are sure of. a year of
more than average though not record-breaking
prosperity. When the next upward movement
in stocks begins the lower priced securities are
likely to be made more active, as the old fa
vorites are now so high as to call for prudence
In handling them."

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 21.-By the col
lapse of a burning oil tank to-day at the
Atlantic Refining Company's plant at
Point Breeze, -where - a fire has been
raging since Monday afternoon, about 100
persons, firemen, employes of the com
pany and spectators, â¢ were more or less
severely burned. Most of the cases were
treated on the ground by ambulance sur
geons, but a few of them were sufficiently
serious .to necessitate removal to the hos- y
pitals. . :
When the tank careened and fell the
heavy iron sheathing separated, precipi
tating large , quantities of blazing pe
troleum into -Â«.asseyunk avenue. There
was a wild stampede among the people in
the vicinity and many of them were bad
ly* burned. Late to-night the Â¦ firemen
and officials of the company said the fire
was under control. Only one tank is now
burning, and unless the wind -changes
from the. southwest the fire will burn
itself out within a . few hours. rV.
-It' is difficult to secure an accurate idea
of the loss. Â¦ President Lloyd of the At

The power of suoh a life is hard to estimate.
For thirty years his name has been a tower
of strength to the university, not simply for
his scientific fame and Intellectual attainment?,
but even more for his moral strength and
beauty. His life has been woven Into thou
sands of roung expanding lives In this Western
commnnwAaUh. and his cheerful hopes have
lighted up their homes. The power of such a.
life cannot be estimated. You have felt it. I
hav* felt.lt, and the world is better that he has
lived. :.- ..
His was a wonderful combinationâ that fresh
ness of youth with the wisdom of age. To be
revered by the old and at the same time to
be loved and soueht for by the young is a rare
experience. "While honors were heaped upon
him â academic and scientific â to^the student he
was always "Doctor Joe." He knew It and it
pleased him, and he always kept In close touch
w'th them.
W lth all Dr. Le Conte's distinctions he never
lost his Blmpllcity and gentleness. Amid the
laborious cares of his daily duties he always
lent a willing ear to the humblest questioner
Love and goodness filled his heart to over
flowing. His dally life was the practical ex
pression of a soul grounded on deep religious
convictions. External nature whose phenome
na he delighted so much to Investigate was to
him only the manifestation of the indwelling
God and his own moral being rejoiced in th*
constant presence of the Infinite father
He lived very close to nature, and when in
his mountain camping trips he lay down to
sleep under the giant trees and looked Up
through their interlacing branches to the glit
tering stars, he thanked the giver of all goo-1
gifts for the robe of lavish beauty he ha<l
spread over the wo-ld for the delight of hU
children.
D * a y. ls ;./ Ormer President of the University
of California. He said:
spiring us to a generous emulation in all
worthy and noble endeavors.
Let us strive for a moment to penetrate the
secret of the great influence our revered teacher
exerted upon the lives and thought of the world
in general. You will remember that he was
fond of .getting comparative views, of seeing
things not merely as facts, or Items of knowl
edge, but in their relations to other things.
With him the comparative method in all study
was both precept and practice; comparative
physiology, comparative psychology, compara
tive thought In every field. How often have
we listened with delighted attention as he sent
his fancy roaming into adjacent fields of sci
ence and philosophy, or of science and the fine
arts, or of science and religion, for exemplifi
cations of N universal law, as with felicitous ar
gument h? made a group of scientific ideas
answer some of the profounder questions of
philosophy. . of religion or of the art of living.
His was the true scientific spirit that searches
for the truth, not In order that its 'discoverer
may win victories, may secure fame, material
comfort or riches, but because the truth will
help man to live the strenubus, the nobler life.
Scientist he was, not in the- narrow, but the
broad sense, searching for knowledge, -not of
facts, but of relations, striving to place man
true, not merely to his local and temporal en
vironment, but also and especially to his bound
less and eternal environment.
Painfully conscious are we to-day of the great
loss we have suffered. For almost a third of
a century we have had the friendship and dally
counsel of a man, whose thought has been able
to penetrate beyond the limitations of tradition
al opinion and creeds Into the regions where in
tuition a^d reason, may work in harmony to
gether, and to draw from thence for our in
spiration some of those eternal verities which
make for man's dignity and welfare.
Although to the rest 'of mankind he was also
a great teacher and a friendly counselor, for
when Joseph Le Conte spoke the world lis
tened, to us, his colleagues and pupils, he has
been far more than these. In the classroom, in
the council chamber, in the Philosophical
Union and at the fireside his thoughts have
become our thoughts In a way that others may
Â¦ not know.. There have been the contacts of
thought with thought, which strike fire an>l
bring out Intellectual and moral enthusiasms
to a blase. There have been the communlng3
of soul with soul in that close Intimacy where
all affections and artificialities cease. As he
walked back and forth In our midst there was
the everconseious. . everabidlng reality in our
hearts that here was being worked out for us
a stimulus to all higher endeavor, a reproach
to all baser motives, one of humanity's great
est Ideals: -
- - - Horace Davis' Address.
The closing address was by Hon. Horace
Tn behalf of the students Ralph T
Fisher, former president of the Asso
ciated Students of the University of Cal
ifornia, said: >
One mark of Dr. Le Conte's greatness lay
in the fascinating simplicity with, which hÂ»
explained the most difficult subjects In the
classroom. Nothing was confused^ and no sub
terfuge of terms was ever resorted to. He was
a devotee of truth at all costs, and this con
viction of the truth made possible that earnest
ness which ; was contagious throughout hla
classes. Another mark of the scholar was the
faithfulness with which he prepared his lec
tures. He stated himself that he never thought
of coming before a class without two hours of
preparation on the work. This made his words
ever fresh and fired him with interest as of
a new discovery. University students are of
a critical mind, i but though he was with us
for over thirty years he 'never lost, thejr re
spect, their admiration or their affection. It
is certainly a telling record and testimony.
A beautiful tribute . to his relation toward
the student body Is that his birthday was each
year invariably remembered by some gift and
pome expression of their love from his pupils.
On such an occasion it- was not always easy to
keep one's eyes dry as he responded sympa
thetically to the remembrance from his class.
And I prize highly the letter from him ac
knowledging, the last birthday gifts we shall
ever be able to bestow. But It occurs to me
that since he has been taken from us nothing
could be more fitting to his memory than that
the student bodv should, on the recurrence of
his birthday In February of each year, present
In his name some gift to the university whoss
welfare he placed above his own and In whose
service he passed away. Â¦
His Memory Imperishable. '
Professor Irving Strlngham, dean of the
college of social sciences, gave, the follow
ing expression:
Since our last meeting In this home gathering
place where we come for mutual talk and help,
an ever-present and Inspiring. reality- has been
changed to a Bad though an imperishable mem
ory; sad, because for a time we must be pain
fully conscious that a rare person has gone
away f rom ' us to return- no more: yet also
Joyful, because the spirit of his personality is
to. remain with us through all our lives, In-
certainly sympathetic that it is no wonder
the unanimous student sentiment exalted him
to the position which he has. always held In
tne affections of the university community.
Teaching was to him a pleasure and It was
as a, teacher he was pre-eminent.
Fame may challenge admiration and ability
command respect, but only a noble character
and a loving heart can secure such universal
devotion as Dr. Le Conte inspired.
This university will doubtless, on its long roll
of faithful servants, have many distinguished
scholars who will leave their names graven ns
de'eply in her temple of fame for the work
they have done in widening the bounds of hu
man. knowledge, or deepening the channel of
human activity, but when again shall It find
a man who shall combine with puch 'eminent 1
scholarship and faithful service the catholicity
of culture, the poetic Insight, the eloquent
tongue, the warmth of . human sympathy, the
gentle and chivalrous spirit, that characterized
that great soul whose loss we here mourn. His
Influence shall endure In this State of his adop
tion long after, his memory shall have faded
Into tradition in this university to which hla
Mfe work was devoted and which has repaid
with affectionate devotion .the whole-hearted
love, he bore for her.
In Behalf of the Students,
As a former pupil of Professor Joseph Le
Conte and as one who loved him. I am grate
ful for this opportunity to Join in this expres
sion of resoect to the memory of our great
teacher and friend. I am glad also to here
bear testimony to the profound sympathy and
sense of loss felt by my colleagues of Stan
ford University. It was my privilege with
many others of the earlier graduates of this
university to sit for three consecutive years
under his inspiring teaching and my further
privilege as a young Instructor to have for sev
eral years the advantage of a more Intimate
personal contact and to benefit by his friendly
advice and criticism. I may safely say that
by no other teacher was I so much influenced
In my ideal of scholarship and personal char
acter as by him.
If we earlier students missed manv of the
advantages which the students of this uni
versity at present enjoy, surely looking back
ward we may say that our greatest compen
sation lay in the longer and more intimate in
tercourse "which we enjoyed with a few great
teachers and among these none perhaps was so
generally admlrÂ»d and so unlverpally loved as
Dr Joseph Le Conte. HIb broad scholarship,
his' clear and logical power of expression, his
masterly method of presentation, his eloouence
and enthusiasm challenged universal admira-
He wa? one who was so keenly alive to the
joy an* humor of llf*. so lenient to harmless
youthful follies could po well appreciate a
Kood natured Jest even if he were himself the
subject of It, was so unfailingly kind and so
Professor J. M. Stillman of Stanford
University was introduced. He said: - ,- :
Stanford Professor's Eulogy.
As one deviated to the cultivation of srienc*
and the teaching of science he insisted not
only upon his duty but also upon his right
to devote a considerable portion of his time
and strength to searching after new knowledge,
to testing authority. Each day he claimed the
scholar's most precious right â some hours alone
Â¦with his thoughts. He tells us in hts auto
biography that although he repeated his course
of lectures in geology fifty times he never went
before his class without having devoted two
hours to preparation for It. And so he spoke
-with authority. Nothing- I ever got from him
Impressed me more than the maintenance of
his own views as opposed to those held by
others In one of his first lectures in his course
in geology. There was power unto righteous
ness and eternal life in truth as he uttered It
because he never uttered It until he made It.
In humility and sincerity, part and parcel of
his own life.
We find here a strong resemblance between
Le Conte and Aeasslz. Both obtained deep
and original Insights into the foundation utxm
which a Sound doctrine of organic evolution
would have to rest, and this before the doctrine
itself was builded secure by Darwin: both re
fused for years to build upon the foundation
they had helped to lay, and both were un
doubtedly held back from this, not so much
by the theological dogmas they held as by the
depth and sincerity of their religious natures.
The difference between the two was, of course,
that Agasslz never came over to the evolution
ary view, while Le Conte did and became ont>
of Its most ardent, consistent and lucid ex
pounders.
ing the years of his apprenticeship In learning
of becoming: a teacher and consequently receiv
ing no pedagogical training at all. he reached
an eminence as a teacher that has been at
tained by but few.
Himself of a deeply religious nature, carefully
nurtured in a religious creed that held God's
creative power to have been exercised directly
in the productive organic species, and having
this belief fortified and extended by the great
authority of Agasslz. he became a convert to
the evolutionary doctrines of Darwin, and the
role he played in defense of this great truth,
and In robbing it of Its danger to religious
faith, is so familiar tp the world as to need
no mention on an occasion like this. Looking
at bis life In this cursory way arid from but
one point of view, it flight seem to have, in It.
a considerable element; of Instability. But no
large life can be fully-Â«een from one direction.
The truth is stability 'was one of his most dis
tinguishing traits. The seeming Instability was
entirely the instability of growth and inevitable
circumstance. Study his life and work atten
tively and you will find these two on every i
page he wrote. In every thought he uttered, in
well-nigh every deed he did. The anointed
prophet of the phenomenal world, the child of

Professor Ritter gave a lengthy bio
graphical record of Dr. Le Conte's work
and continued:
The president 'presented Professor Wil
liam E. Ritter. whose address was from
the point of view of the alumni and scien
tific students who had followed Dr.,Le
Conte. Professor Ritter said: I
â¢ We knew while he was still with us that
Joseph Le Conte was a great man. But our
love for him as a human being so occupied ui
as to distract our attention from the grandeur
of his life and work as a whole.
For Alumni and Science Students.
Let this meeting serve to Impress upon us
the life of that member who has gone and
that it Is not bounded by days, not measured
In form, not named, but a life behind common
thincs that takes hold of God and the life im
mortal.
We are met together to-day in order that
we may quicken our minds and hearts to a
recognition of that spiritual university in
which with Joseph Le Conte we have shared
and still share membership. Of such spiritual
membership in a SDirltual body his life here
among ur and his life in the larger world of
letters afforded an example so fully typical
that we cannot let it pass from the present into
the past until we for once bid its image halt
before us. that we may make it and its mean
ing sure possessions of our memories and our
lives. The university of which he was a mem
ber with us we recognize beyond a question
was not an Institution of buildings, or of
courses, or of statutes, and as a member of
It he was much more. Immeasurably much
more* than professor, or geologist, or philoso
pher that his connection with us and his life
among ue shine out as brilliant revelations and
confirmations of our faith that the things
which are lie deep behind the things we touch
and see.
Mrs. Le Conte. the widow, and the son,
Joseph N. Le Conte, who was absent from
the funeral, occupied prominent places at
the exercises.
The services were opened by President
Wheeler, who said:
In all it was a solemn and Inspiring as- 1
semblage. Old and young gave their
presence and voices to attest their love
for the noble character whose life was be
ing honored as his memory was being re
vered.
Interspersed with the stated speeches
were musical numbers, these being a
striking portion of the programme. In ad
dition to the men from the University of
California there came from Stanford Uni
\ersity Professor J. M. Stillman, a former
pupil of Dr. Le Conte, to lay his gift upon
the altar of memory.
Striking Musical Numbers.
It was in beautiful keeping with the
gentle nature of the teacher who had
gone that no attempt should be made at
elaborate display in this, the university's
tribute to his memory. In the large hall
there, Â¦was only one outward sign of
mourning. To the right of the speakers"

of black crape draping the gold frame.
That was all, but sufficient it was, for
the strong words and magnificent eulogy
from the selected representatives of uni
versity life were the realities of this pub
lic tribute.
That his death only served to indicate
the intense love and admiration his fel
low workers felt for.the eminent scientist
was manifest at this afternoon's gather

of 3 o'clock, announced for the opening
of the exercises in memoriam, the audi
torium was crowded. Two thousand
students occupied the chairs on the main
floor and 500 more were in the galleries.
Upon the platform were the members of
the faculty in full academic regalia,
gowns, hoods and mortar boards. With
the professors sat some prominent lay
men, notably William R. Davis . and

Mayor Johnson visited the scene of the
accident early to-day and immediately
upon his return ordered all construction
work on the tunnel stopped until every
safeguard shall be provided for the pro
tection of the men.
James Williams, who lost his life, was
one of the men who heroically entered the
tunnel after the accident of last week at
crib No. 2 in search of victims of that
disaster.
Heavy iron girders and machinery
weighing more than a hundred tons were
forced out of the shaft by the explosion.
The crib was wrecked. Death must have
been Instantaneous to the workmen in the
tunnel, for their comrades above heard no
outcry. So great was the destruction,
wrought by the explosion that it will prob
ably be weeks before the damage can bo
repaired and the bodies of the unfortunate
workmen recovered.
The heavy casing of the shaft was shat
tered and an immense volume of water
from the lake rushed in upon the unfor
tunate workmen at the bottom. Two men.
who were at work on staging at the top
of the shaft, were blown high Into the
air, but alighted on the crib, and beyond
being stunned were not seriously Injured.
The accident occurred early last night,
but nothing was known of it on shore un
til to-day. Thirty men who were on the
crib when the explosion took place spent
the night vainly signaling for assistance.
It was long after daylight before a tug
reached them. It is supposed that the
men digging struck a vein of gas, which
was ignited by a spark made by a work
man's pick.

It is a striking fact, however, that while
thirty States of the Union have adopted strln

years, yet during the same period the amount
or capital and labor employed in the form of
consolidated incorporation to which that name
is usually given, has in those very States stead
liy and even enormously increased, which
would seem to show that without trenching
Â¦upon rights guaranteed by the constitution of

the Baltimore and Detroit league clubs here to
day ended In the fourth inning, | when Umpire
Connolly declared It forfeited 9 to 0 in favor of
Detroit. The actual score was 7 to 4 in favor
of the visitors. Connolly had given several de
cisions particularly exasperating to the local
crowd, " for. which there seemed to â¢ be no Justi
fication. At the beginning of Baltimore's turn
at the bat In the fourth another such decision
occurred and the home players gathered around
Connolly to - argue the matter. . Though they
were talking peaceably. It took . Connolly less
than a minute to declare the game forfeited.

Judge Searls -was going to his Berkeley
home from Oakland last: evening and
boarded a Telegraph-avenue car. At the
corner of Bancroft way and Ellsworth
street, a block and a half from his home
at. 2317 . Durant avenue, he jumped from
the car. : The car was going faster than
he thought and he was thrown violently
to the ground. He got to his feet without
assistance and despite the pain In his
ankle he walked the block and a half to
his home. When, he reached there. he
nearly fainted from pain and exhaustion.
A physician was sent for and it was found
that he had sustained a severe sprain of
the left ankle and that he was badly
bruised and wrenched from the fall. His
age makes the injuries the more serious.
Judge Searls is now confined to his bed
and it is hardly expected that he can be
out inside of a month.
." Niles Searls,. former Justice of the Su
preme Court of this State and one of the
most prominent jurists in California, was
seriously injured while alighting from an
electric car last night. ' His "left ankle
was sprained and he was so badly injured
otherwise that it will be a month before
he 'will be able to leave his home.

JURIST THROWN
BY MOVING CAR
Both men sprang into the water at the
pistol shot and .began their hard race
shoulder - to shoulder. They used the
double -overhand stroke. Leary led the
first lap but lost on the turn. Wideman is
a fast man in turning, and at the kickoff
gained two feet on Leary. The latter went
right after his rival and passed him. but
lost again on the turn. They came down
the tank neck and neck at the finish, and
while Leary's hand went. under the rope,
Wideman's hand shot over it. On one side
of the tank it looked as if Wideman was
the victor, but on the other side it ap
peared to be a dead heat. >-'Â»Â«,â¢
Judges Wallace Taylor and J. A. Geddea
declared Wideman the victor, and I Ken
neth Melrose declared it was a dead heat.
As there was some : dispute Wideman
magnanimously agreed to swim the race
over. again at Sutro Baths a week, from
next Sunday. The. race will be straight
away and the victor. will win on his mer
its. .The contestants did, the distance in
forty-four seconds, which is two seconds
above the record established by Wideman.
The race was the second of a series now
being conducted at the club. Wideman,
who represents the Lurllne- Swimming
Club, was challenged by Leary of the
Olympic Club. The directors of the ath
letic institution offered a handsome tro
phy for three races of fifty, seventy-five
and one hundred yards each, to be con
tested on separate nights. On Monday
evening last Wideman defeated Leary in
the fifty-yard match by a scant foot and
lowered the American record for the dis
tance one-fifth of a second. Last night
the pair came together tor the seventy
five-yard event.
H. A. 'Wideinan, America's champion
short-di3tance swimmer, and Scott Leary.
a young aspirant for aquatic honors,
swam what looked like a dead heat at the
Olympic Club last night in the presence
of a few hundred members. Two of the
Judges decided that Wideman had won by
six inches, and the other Judge was of the
opinion that the race was a tie, and so ex
pressed himself.

Another interesting incident In the Fed
eral court is the postponing of the high
sea assault cases against Captain Wal
lace of the ship Sea King and Captain
Baker of the Emily Keed Just as they
were about to be tried by a special jury.
When the District Attorney was away
on the mainland his substitute. J. J.
Dunne, proceeded against the shipmasters
oy criminal information. Instead of having
â¢S r f I l d A t Â£ lry sum moned, for the cases.
District Attorney Balrd on his return re
fused to prosecute the cases until they
J> ad _ eone before a Grand Jury. The de
fendants lose three months of their time
besides, their commands. A score of wit
nesses are also held in jail for appearance.
A contest is on in the Supreme Court to
test the legality of the income tax law.
The enactment is being contested jointly
by the Merchants' Association, which
took the initiative, the Chamber of Com
merce and the Planters' Association.
Briefs are to be filed.
The suits for condemnation of lands at
Pearl Harbor for the naval station will be
contested. Commandant Pond, who fur
nished the estimate of valuation for the
condemnation, iiroceedings. placed the to
\fl ou Sl. toT sbou t S00 acres at less than
*i/.uw. The answers of owners already
filed In court amount to $1,132,200 There
are more to come. As a matter of official
record the properties sought to be con
demned a're assessed for many times the
amount at which the Government seeks
to obtatn possession. The condemnation
proceedings are brought under the Ha
waiian law of eminent domain, which
provides for a condemnation value of 20
per crcit- above- the assessed value. The
respondents will make a. demand for a
jury trial a part of their fight. .
Jv.dge Estee has decided, that any Chi

HONOLULU, Aug. H.-The drought en
the island of Hawaii is t<ecoming serious.
Scarcely any rain has fallen since the
latter part of April, ar^a there was very
little then. Besides Irjury to the upcom
ing crop of sugar cane, cattle and all live
stock are becoming emaciated. In some
sections water for domestic purposes iÂ§
sold by the pail at famine prices. There is
an account of a village barber who re
fused to shave a traveler for lack of
water, but the customer got a bottle of
so<ia water aud had the shave. In the
li.uu district only has the drought been
effectually broken.

with them In cash. Â¦â¢.... ,.-'-.
On the opening of United- States Court

Woodworth -moved that.. the. amount of
bail should be increased from .$18,250, .the
sum named by the Commissioner, to $37,

cock thereupon visited Judge de. Haven in
his chambers and when he resumed his
seat upon the bench announced . that he
would allow the bail to remain as It stood,
but that if the United States Attorney, in
the event of Dimmick's release on. bonds,
should - give reasons why additional bail
would be demanded ' the court '} would toe
willing to entertain ' the proposition.
WOodworth announced that' his prin

ter of the momentum and the car stopped.
The motorman applied the brakes at the
beginning of the incline, but owing to
the slippery condition of the rails and the
weight of humanity aboard the car they
failed to hold. When it became evident
that the car was beyond control panic,
reigned among the passengers, but the
speed was too great for any attempt to
seek safety In jumping off. Rounding the

result from her injury, but are confident
that she will never again be able to see.

was Byrnes' comment.
"I wish she'd done it at home," said the

Hospital, believes that while she prob
ably will not die she will lose the sight
of the remaining eye.
The Schmitt family is out . of town.
Peter Byrnes, who is employed at a liv
ery barn at 1629 Pine street, was in charge
of the Schmitt residence. He and his wife
and Miss "Ackerman, who is his wife's
sister, took up their abode there during
the family's absence.
Miss Ackerman, who came . down from
Stockton a few weeks ago to, visit her
sister, made the acquaintance soon after
her arrival here . of James King. The
story ' of this acquaintance and its re
sults Miss Ackerman related in "a state
ment Â¦ made last ' night at the Receiving
Hospital. It was a case of love at first
sight between herself and King, she said.
King, however, had one serious fault.
He drank. Before the acquaintance was
many days old she decided, she said, to
become engaged to him, but before plight-
Ing her troth determined to eradicate, if
possible, his love of liquor. King braced
up and until Tuesday last remained faith
ful to a pledge of. total abstinence. .He
called on her Tuesday evening, however,
very much the worse for drink. .
