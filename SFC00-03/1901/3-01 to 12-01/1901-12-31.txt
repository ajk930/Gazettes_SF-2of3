MINNESOTA COURT GRANTS AN INJUNCTION
THAT CHECKS GIGANTIC RAILROAD MERGER
JAMES L. FRAZIER RESIGNS POSITION
AS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WESTERN
DIVISION OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
He Is to Take Charge of the Toledo, St. Louis and Western Road,'
and Predictions Are Made in Railway Circles That Vacancy Will
Probably Be Filled by W. S. Palmer or B. A. Worthington
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE WESTERN DIVISION OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD SYSTEM, WHO
TENDERED HIS RESIGNATION TO MANAGER AGLER YESTERDAY AND WHO IS TO TAKE CHARGE OF
THE TOLEDO, ST. LOUIS AND WESTERN ROAD.
JAMES L. FRAZIER, superintend
ent of the Western division of
the Southern Pacific Company,
with headquarters at Oakland,
has tendered his resignation to
his superiors In order to become
the g-eneral superintendent of the Toledo,
St. Louis and Western Railway.
The resignation of Frazier came as a.
tig surprise to the occupants of the "yel
low building" at the corner of Montgom
ery and Market streets Just before the
close of office hours last evening. The
resignation w&s placed In the hands of
James Agler, manager of the Pacific sys
uim.
That Frazier would sever his relations
with the Southern Pacific Company was
the last thought in the minds of Agler
and his associates and the withdrawal of
the popular official created quite a een
: atlon. The news spread rapidly through
the various offices and was discussed
eagerly by those who heard It. No action
was taken by Manager Agler on Frazier's
resignation, owing to the late hour at
which It was received.
The subject naturally caused consider
able surmise as to the probable successor
Â«f Fra/ier to the important position from
which he has resigned.
Predictions were made last evening in
the "vellow building" that Frazier will
he succeeded by Warren S. Palmer, su
perintendent of the Sacramento division,
pr by E. A. Worthington. superintendent
of the coast division, both of whom are
considered to be among the most efficient
railroad men in the country.

the holders of Northern Pacific
preferred.. _,,- \ v .. ~s,a ., ,
MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. , 30. â
Judge Elliott of the' District
Court of Hennepin County
to-day granted a temporary
order restraining the officers
of the Northern Pacific Com
pany from retiring the preferred stock
of the company. The order was issued
on the application of Peter Power 1 of New
York, who ho'lds 100 shares of the com
mon stock. It was supposed that the
failure of the action brought in the New
York courts, by holders of. preferred
stock cleared away the. last obstacle to
the retirement of the preferred on Janu
ary 1, leaving the Hill interest in con
trol of the road through its majority of
the common stock. It is inferred, al
though it does not so appear, that the
present action Is brought In behalf of the
Harriman interest to prevent control
passing out of its hands for another year,
ct until the legal standing of the North
ern Securities Company is settled.
The claim set up by Power in his suit
is that the retirement of the preferred
stock Is in violation of the agreement
Lhat such retirement would lay no ad
litlonal burdens upon the common stock,
ind he holds that the certificates of de-
Denture bonds to be issued to effect the
retirement of the preferred would become
* lien upon the common stock and thus
ivork an injury to his property. It is
.mderstood that the block of 100 shares
ield by Power is the only block of com
non not controlled or definitely located
ipon one side or the otherâ the Harri
nan people or the Hill-Morgan interest.

Hill's Consolidation Scheme.
The petition recites briefly the history
of the Northern Pacific Railroad -and the
division of its stock into common and
preferred. It is alleged that the* only dif
ference between the* preferred stock and
the common stock was that the preferred
stockwas entitled to the 4 per cent divi
dend prior to anything being paid on the
common stock and the bill in this connec
tion alleges that the preferred stock was
subject to be retired at any time within
twenty years after the time for reorgani
zation of the company arid the issuing
of the stock out of the surplus net earn
ings of the company and not othetwlse;
that in other respects the rights of the
preferred and common stockholders were
identical.
The bill next recites the organization of
the Great Northern and the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy lines and alleges that
the Northern Pacific Railway Company
and the Great Northern Railway Com
pany are parallel lines to the Pacific Coast
and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railway Company has a parallel line from
Billings, Mont., to Chicago, and. that all
such lines are competing lines for the
business qf the Northwest.
It Is alleged that the officers of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company dur
ing /the last summer and since the plain
tiff became the owner of this stock, and
without any knowledge on his part, went
Into a combination with the Great North
ern and the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy, the purpose of which was to con
centrate and consolidate the three systems
under one management, and, knowing that
it could not be legally effected, the direc
tors of the three companies,* for the pur
pose of doing indirectly what they could
not do directly, caused to be organized the
Northern Securities Company, a New Jer
sey corporation with a capitalization, of
$400,000,000, which, under its charter, was
authorized to purchase and hold stocks;
bonds and securities of other corporations,
the intention being to cause a majority of
the stock of all three of the railway com- â¢
panles to be transferred to the Northern
Securities Company, and to be controlled
by it, thereby controlling the three sys
tems of railways through the medium of
the Northern Securities I Company, sup- j
pressing competition, regulating the tariff
rates and conducting the entire business
of the three systems as one corporation.
It is further alleged that thereupon the
Northern Securities Company proceeded
to advertise publicly, upon terms of ex
change, all the stock of the Great North
ern Company and that the whole scheme
was illegal, in violation of the law of this
State and the. other States through which
the railway lines pass, against the public
laws of the United States and of each of
the States. â¢ . \ -,.

virtue of the charter of the Northern Pa

visions of the reorganization agreement,

and not otherwise; that notwithstanding
these provisions, the directors of said
company, for the first step of carrying out
their plan of transferring the control . of
the defendant corporation to the Northern
Securities Company, have nerved- notice
upon the holders of the preferred . stock
that on January 1, 1902, they would retire
such preferred stock.
The bill alleges further that since its
reorganization the Northern Pacific Com
pany has conducted a successful and
profitable business and has paid 4 per
cent on preferred stock and is now pay-
Ing 4 on the common out of the earnings,
after paying the fixed charges and the
operating expenses; that there is a fund
of about $3,000,000 set aside to secure pay
ments of dividends^ on ' preferred stock
and between $2,000,000 j and $3,000,000 of a
general surplus; that it has, now on hand
exceeding $3,000,000, derived from the earn
ings of the road, -wherewith to pay the
$75Â«000,000 of the preferred stock at par,
but that in order to retire such preferred
stock the directors of the company are
threatening to issue and sell certificates
of ' Indebtedness or debenture bonds
amounting to $75,000,000 of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company and out of the
proceeds pay off the stockholders of 'the
preferred stock at par January 1, 1902.
It Is alleged that, the Northern Pacific
Railway Company lias caused to be sent
to each of Its preferred stockholders a
notice that it would retire the whole of
the preferred stock at par on the first
day of January, 1902, and that the trans
fer books of the company, were closed ' on
Tuesday, December 10, 1901, at 3 o'clock,
for the retirement of the preferred stock,
as aforesaid.

HOPES TO BLOCK
THE CANAL BILL
Panama Lobby Centers
Its Efforts Upon the
Senate.
. :
Powerful Interests Will At
tempt to Defeat Public
Will Once More.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â There are in
dications that the Panama canal lobby
will resume operations in Washington
next week and make a heroic effort to
again block the way for canal legislation.
For many years the opponents of legis
lation for the Nicaragua canal have util
ized the Panama scheme to prevent sucn
legislation. Representatives of the trans
continental railroads have been more or
less conspicuous in all of these efforts,
but with public sentiment so unanimously
in favor of the isthmian canal this oppo
sition has had to keep in the background
and make its influence felt thr.ough ad
vocacy of the Panama canal. The report
from Paris that the Panama Company is
now . ready to sell its concessions and'
property for $40,000,000 and that the gen
eral secretary or the company has sailed
for this country has provided a new ex
cuse for those who wish to prevent the
passage of the Hepburn bill. This bill has
been made a. special order for January 7.
There is no doubt about its passage by
the House by a large majority. It will
receive an almost unanimous vote in the
House, and will be sent to the Senate be
fore the close of next week.
The efforts of the opposition â will be cen
tered in the Senate. That body can be
depended upon for deliberation and long j
discussion. In fact, the opponents of the
bill say they can always depend upon
Senator Morgan, chief advocate of the
Xicaragxian canal, to help them delay the
vote by his weakness for long argument.
It will be difficult, however, for the op
ponents of the canal to present new con
ditions in this readiness of the Panama
Company to sell its property and conces
sions for $40,000,000, the estimated value
put upon the property by the canal com
mission. The report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, recently submitted to
Congress, shows that this Government
could not utilize the Panama canal, even
should that company make us a present
of its property. The accepted plan of Con
gress and of the American people is for
the Government canal to be owned and
controlled by the United States Govern
ment.
There is no possibility of a canal by the
Panama route. The Isthmian Canal Com
mission makes this point clear in its re
port. But even with this report of the
canal commission before Congress, there
are Senators who talk about the advan
tage of the Panama route. They profess
. to believe that we can drive a good bar
rain with the Panama Canal Company, â 
knowing the property to be purchased
would never enable this Government to
own and control the canal.
With the Panama proposition and the
demand for absolute treaties with Nica
ragua and Costa Rica granting the con
cessions, the opponents of legislation hope j
to delay the Hepburn bill's passage until
the close of this sesion. They will not
fight the bill openly, but â¢will use these
arguments for delay, and depend upon
the Senate to prevent legislation through
one mere session.
It will require diplomacy and strategy
for the Senators to - hold back the canal
bill, but the Panama lobby will try to fur
nish excuses to enable it to do so and let
another session pass without canal legis
lation.
FRAZIER RESIGNS HIS POSITION
Continued from Page One.
â way of the western division of the South
era Pacific system, find in March, 1900, he
became assistant superintendent of the
division under Agler.
W. S. Palmer Succeeded J. B. Wright.
When President Hays retired J. B.
Wright from the post of superintendent
of the Sacramento division Palmer was
selected as Wright's successor. If he is
slated for the post of superintendent of
the Western division, to succeed. Frazier,
Palmer will bring to the office a thorough
knowledge of its manifold duties.
33. A. Worthing-ton, who is also spoken
of as a possible successor to Frazier as
superintendent of the Western division,
is at present in charge of the coast divi
sion, with headquarters at Third anil
Townscnd streets.
There is no more popular railroad n:an
on the Pacific coast to-day than "Bert"
Worthington. and his value is recognize"!
by those in power in the "yÂ«llow build
ing" of the Southern Pacific corporation.
From Messenger to Superintendent.
Worthington entered the service of thÂ«
Central Pacific Railroad Company in 1S74
as a messenger in the Sacramento office. !
His ability was quickly recognized and
fate soon became telegraph operator at
many important localities. When the â 
railroad wires were leased to the We&tern
Union Company Wortbington "went with
the plant," and In 1SS0 was chief operator
for the Western Union in Los Angeles.
En April, 1881, he was transferred to the
railroad service and became private stc- ;
retary to the late A. J. Stevens, general
master mechanic of the motive power and
machinery department of the Southern
Pacific Company, with headquarters at
Sacramento. When Stevens died in April,
18SS, Worthington was brought to San
Francisco by the late A. N. Towne, vice
president and general manager of the
Southern Pacific, serving- as private sec
retary.
When Towne died in July, 1833, Worth
ington was appointed private secretary to
H. E. Huntington, then assistant to the
president. He remained in that position
until April, 1S99, when he was placed in
charge of the tonnage rating of locomo
tives on the Pacific system lines west of
El Paso.
On July 22 of this year Worthington
was made superintendent of the Tucson
division of the Southern Pacific, with
headquarters at Tucson, Arizona. >-. .
President Hays was considerably im
pressed with the ability displayed by
Worthington and at the first oportunity
selected him fÂ«r promotion. After Hays
resigned from the presidency of the
Southern Pacific system the heads of the
corporation did not overlook Worthing
ton. Two months ago he was brought
back from Arizona and placed in charge
of the new coast division, with headquar
ters in this city.
T. R. Jones May Be Promoted.
In the event of W. S. Palnrer being se
lected as the new superintendent of the
Western division it is probable that he
will be succeeded on the Sacramento divi
sion by T. R. Jones, the present assistant
superintendent. He is a veteran railroad
man and is recognized from one end of
the country to the other as a thoroughly
competent official. Jones is most popular
with his brother officials arÂ«l his ap
pointment as head of the Sacramento di
vision would give great pleasure toÂ«his
friends in the capital city.

The berman Minister to Venezuela, Dr.
O. SSchmidt-Leda, who has been on a va
cation nere, is now on his way to Ca
racas. The Foreign Office solemnly reiter- \
atejs the statement that it does not con- j
template territorial acquisitions in Vene
zuela, i
Replying .to Germany's assurances to j
the united States regarding tne former's :
plans in connection with Venezuela, the j
Foreign Office here has received an an- |
swer rrom Secretary Hay expressing full j
satisfaction with Germany's position, j
Germany still hopes to collect her claims
peaceably. |
To-aay the small German cruiser Ga- |
zelle was ordered to sail immediately |
from Kiel to Venezuelan waters. The !
Government intends to send one or two j
other small warships to reinforce the |
present OJerman squadron in the Carib
bean Sea. The aaditions to Germany's
navel force in the Caribbean Sea will not
be sufficient to give rise to suspicions
among the peopje of the United States
that Germany meditates anything beyond
the collection of claims due the German
subjects. The German Government de- j
sires beyond anything else in this matter
to avoid disturbing the Government or the !
people of the United States. German ;
newspapers published to-day are full of â 
expressions of this kind and many of j
these expressions are so much alike that I
it is easy to infer that their utterance
was suggested by the Government. A re
markable thing is the fact that there is
not a single unkind expression toward
the United States in any of these news
paper comments. - .
Public Opinion Erroneous.
"We hope that this opinion," says the
Berliner Neuste Nachrichten, -which
grew out of the Spanish war and which
we consider to be wholly erroneous, will
soon give place to a more correct con
ception of Germany's aims. It is quite un
reasonable that the people of the United
States holding such opinion should con
nect this opinion with the Venezuelan af
fair, insomuch as Washington has been
fully informed of Germany's intentions."
The Lokal Anzeieer says: "The task
for our diplomacy is to make German in
terests prevail against Venezuela without,
at the same time, losing touch with the
American Government. The authorities
at Washington have up to the present
time shown such intelligent comprehen
sion of the situation and such a disposi
tion toward Germany's wishes that no
grounds for apprehension exist at this
point." '-._*- -'-_

were the "thinnest kind of sensational
nonsense."
'"Moreover," said Mr. White, "President
Roosevelt, commander in chief of both the
army and the navy, it is well known, en
tertains not only official but personal pre
dilections for Germany, which have been
known not only officially to the German
Government, but which have long- been
known among his friends. He studied in
Germany, reads and loves German litera
ture and has a most sincere personal re
spe*ct for the German fimperor. Any ut
terance of the kind alleged by an officer
of either service would be sternly rebuked
by President Roosevelt."
Battleships Guard Our Interests.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 30.â The Navy
Department has been notified of the de
parture yesterday from Acapulco, Mex
ico, of Rear Admiral Silas Casey, com
manding the North Pacific squadron
aboard his flagship, the Wisconsin, bound
for Callao, Peru. By the time the Wis
consin arrives at the latter port, it is
expected, the battleship Iowa will be
ready to merge from the dock at Talca
huano, Chile, and at the Navy Depart
ment it is thought probable that Admiral
Casey will transfer his flag back to the
Iowa, from which vessel it formerly flew.
This state of affairs will leave the larg
est two battleships of the Pacific squadron
cruising In the waters off the coasts of
Chile, Argentina and Peru, so that In
case the threatened hostilities between
Chile and Argentina materialize American
interests in that quarter would be well
looked after.

LONDON, Dec. 31.â Most of the mom-

the German-Venezuelan dispute. They
are generally agreed that Germany is not
anxious to provoke complications and
will be careful not to ruffle American sus
ceptibilities. The Daily Chronicle says
that the United States has no interest In
seeing its guaranty against foreign ag
gression turned into a cloak for bad faith
toward foreign powers.

Expedition in Colombia.
COLON, Colombia, Dec. 30.â General
Herrera's expedition debarked at Tonosi
on December 24 from the Liberal steam
ers IbiBs, Darlen yid Gaitan and sailing
vessels. Herrera *!s the general who
capitulated at Panama last year. He Is
considered to be one of the best, If not
the best, generals the revolutionists pos
sess. He is a clever and able man, who !
has sacrificed everything for the sake of
the revolution. - Herrera is said to be sur
rounded by first-class men. Generals Por
ras and Lorenzo are doubtless aware of
Herrera's arrival In their vicinity and will
do their utmost to join forces with him.
In view of Herrera's movement the Gov
ernment has requested that reinforce
ments be sent from Barranquilla. In the
meantime, recognizing the gravity of the
situation, the . Government officials are
taking active measures to meet all exi
gencies. A steam tug belonging to the
Panama Canal Company was procured at
Panama on Saturday to transport troops
but the crew, including the engineer, re
fused to take part in any military opera

to obtain another crew from the shore
The tug l,eft Panama with the Boyaca

Herrera making a final desperate effort.

CAUCUS OF REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS
WILL DECIDE HANNA-FORAKER FIGHT
Both Factions. Concede That on the Outcome of the Present Con
test for Control Will Depend the Supremacy of One or the
Other of the Warring Senators in the Ohio Political Field
COLUMBUS, O., Dec. 30.â The Ohio
Legislature, which will elect the
successor of Senator Foraker,
will convene here next Monday.
The party caucuses to nominate
candidates for presiding officers and other
positions In. both branches of the General
Assembly will be held on Saturday night.
As the Republicans have a large majority
in both houses and as there is no opposi
tion to the re-electicn of Senator Foraker
the Senatorial question for this session is
settled, but there is a very bitter contest
in progress bearing, upon the re-election
of Senator Hanna two years-hence, as it
is believed that a majority of the Repub
lican members will be re-elected to the
next Assembly.
Senator Foraker Is at his home at Cin
cinnati and Senator Hanna remains in
Washington. Neither is expected here
this week, but are in constant communi
cation with the leaders of their respec
tive forces. John R. Malloy, secretary of
the State committee and coal . inspector
under Nash, is manager of the Hanna
forces, and ex-State Chairman Charles K.
Schwartz, who was private secretary to
Foraker as Governor and who headed the
fusion in the Legislature against Hanna
four years ago, Is manager of the anti-
Hanna forces. It is claimed by the Hanna
men that the present contest- is" "the
same old factional fight of 1S97-9S over
again." The Foraker men claim that
they are simply exercising their right to
support their, friends.
Both factions have their respective tick
ets for the' caucus nominations and they
are called the Hanna and Foraker tickets
ass openly as the Democratic and- Republi
can tickets are designated in campaigns.
Four years ago the contest did not end
with the party caucuses, but was car
ried into the Legislature. It. is conceded
by both sides that the results of the cau
cuses next Saturday night will be final.

FEARS BRITAIN

London Paper's View of
Plan to Adjust the
Boundaries, '
LONDON, Dec. 31.â Commenting upon
the statement from Reuter's "Washington
correspondent concerning the probability
that Secretary Hay and Lord Pauncefotn,
British Embassador at Washington, are
arranging a commission in which the
United States, Great Britain and Canada
will be represented for the settlement of
the Alaskan boundary and other out
standing difficulties betwen the countries
in question, the Daily Mail thinks thdt,
having secured the isthmian canal treaty
without an equivalent the United States
should now prove reasonable.
"Although it can hardly be hoped," says
the Daily Mail, "that the Canadian
claims will be conceded in their entirety
perhaps the wisest course would be to re
sort to arbitration, and, in the question
of warships on the Great Lakes, to permit
the existing understanding to continue
undisturbed."
Ihe Daily Mail expresses the sincere
hope that the correspondent's statement
is a correct forecast of the Anglo-Ameri
can negotiations. But it Is not sanguine
of results from the commission, which,
so far as Great Britain is concerned, is
rather "after the fair" because, with ;h.j
Nicaraguan controversy closed, Great
Britain has nothing left to bargain with,
while the United States is quite content
in other disputes with the statuquo.
The Daily News characterizes the Ca
nadian claim to negotiate the reciprocity
question independently as very significant.

SWOLLEN RIVERS
ARE NOW FALLING
Danger of Serious Floods
in Pennsylvania Is
About Over.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 30.â From all
parts of Eastern Pennsylvania to-night i
reports show, that the rivers -and creeks
which became greatly swollen as a result'
of Saturday night and Sunday's continu
ous rain are steadily falling. There is one
exception," however, the lower part of the j
Susquehanna River being reported to be â¢
still rising and close to the danger mark. I
Although considerable damage was done
the losses will not be great, most of the
flood areas being low lands against the
Upper Schuylkill, Lehigh and Susque
hanna rivers. In the anthracite coal dis
tricts a few of the mines were flooded,
causing a suspension of work for the day.
Along the lower Susquehanna there Is ap
prehension that damage will result from
ice gorges.. The water is said to be ris
ing six incnes an hour in that vicinity.
Schuylkill River in this city rose eighteen
feet above the normal, which rise has been
passed only once in thirty-two years.
Manayunk, one of the mill districts, suf
fered most from the flood.' Every mill
along the river was forced to suspend
operations, throwing out of work for the
day about 30c : 0 persons. The river drives
through Fairmount Park and several sec
tions of the railroad tracks on both sides
of the river between the park and the
mouth of the Schuylkill were under water
for a short time during the day. It was
feared that the Baltimore and Ohio sta
tion on the east side of the river at Chest
nut street would be flooded, but just as
the water got within a few feet of doing
harm, it began to recede and all danger
was t>ver.
The rain, which began falling at 7
o'clock Saturday night, ceased at 7 o'clock,
this morning. During that time the pre
cipitation amounted to 3.26 inches.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec. 30. âThe
flood in the Talipoosa River broke the
dam of the Tallahassee Electric Company,
180 to 670 feet of solid masonry giving
way. The dam cost $400,000. The power
was to have been turned into Montgomery
early in January. Two hundred feet of
the Tallahassee cotton mills stone dam
was broken and the loss is estimated at
$70,000. Xhe rainfall was over seven inches
and ten feet of water noured over the
whole length of the power company's
dam.

GETS A REBUFF
FROM ARGENTINA
Uncle Sam's Friendly
' Offer to Mediate Is
Rejected.
Buenos Ayres Government
Apparently Wants War
With Chile.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â Advices re
ceived here indicate that Chile has shown
a more temperate disposition than the
Argentine Republic in dealing with ques
tions which may ultimately involve the
two countries in war. The most surpris
ing feature of the negotiations, according
to these advices, is the refusal of Argen
tina to accept the friendly offices of the
United States to bring about an amicable
adjustment and the promptness of Chile
in welcoming American Intercession.
Since the "Baltimore affair" in 1891,
which nearly involved Chile and this j
c6untry in hostilities, Chileans have sup
posedly maintained a .bitter feeling to
ward their North American neighbors,
fctrt that disposition appears to have
changed. Argentina, on the other hand,
was regarded as especially friendly to
ward trie United States. Her rejection
of the offer of this Government is sur
prising not only on that account but also
because the manner of Argentina's re
fusal indicated that she does not enter
tain any feeling of warmth for the
Washington administration.
From reliable Information received here,
Argentina appears to have been only
half-hearted in her agreement to accept
'.he arbitration of King EdVard, and tfie
conviction is growing among officials
that she is not willing to have a peace
able adjustment with Chile.
In a telegram to the State Department,
Buchanan, one of the American delegates
to the Pan-American Congress in the
City of Mexico, says an agreement for
arbitration along the Hne3 of The Hague
treaty appears to be favored by a ma- I
jority of the Latin delegates and - the '
congress probably will use that treaty as
a model in reaching conclusions. Some
of the countries desire to make a more
radical agreement than that arranged at
The Hague, and Buchanan says they
probably will sign a separate agreement.

GOVERNOES MEET IN HELENA.
Van Sant of Minnesota Outlines the
Anti-Merger Plans.
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 3kâ No definite 1
action was taken to-day at the meeting*
of the Governors and Attorneys Gen-
eral of the Northwestern States
called to consider plans for oppos
ing the proposed consolidation of the
Northern Pacific, the Great Northern and
the Burlington railway systems. From the
discussion at the meeting, however, it is
considered probable that the plan of 'gov
ernor Van Sant of Minnesota will be in
dorsed by the executives of the other
States who were present, and that the
fight against the railroad consolidation
: will be carried to a finish. What this plan
1 is Governor Van Sant refused to say un
til the meeting to-morrow morning shall
' have taken action.
i The meetings were held In Governor
Toole's private office and behind closed
doors. There were present besides Gov
ernor Toole and Attorney General Dono
van of Montana, Governor Van Sant and
Attoney General Douglass of Minnesota.
Governor Herreid and Attorney General
Pyle of South Dakota, Governor Hunt
and Attorney General Martin of Idaho,
and Attorney General Stratton of Wash
ington, Governor MeBride of that State
not being able to be present on account i
of the death of Governor Rogers.
Governor White of North Dakota was
expected to attend the conference, and, in
fact, had telegraphed to Governor Van
Sant that he would be" present. In a later
telegram, however, he said that it was
impossible for him to attend the meetings.
The meeting, was organized by the elec
tion of Governor Van Sant as chairman
'â  and Attorney General Martin of Idaho as
secretary. After reading Governor
, White's communication stating that he
; would 'not be present Governor Van Sant
made a brief speech in regard to the ob
' jects of the meeting, giving a history of
. the proposed railroad consolidation and
I the effect he believed it would have on
j the States affected.
"The State of Minnesota," said the Gov
ernor, "has. had on her statute books for
more than twenty-five years laws prohib
iting the consolidation In any way of
parallel and competing lines of railway.
It has been the settled policy of our State
to maintain free, open and unrestricted
competition in freight and passenger
rates. The Great Northern and the North
ern Pacific railway companies operate
parallel and competing lines of railway
within the State. They are practically the
only roads which furnish any transporta
tion facilities to the northern half of the
State, with the exception ot the two
known as the 'iron ore roads.'
"It has been recently announced that
Mr. Hill and his assistants have obtained
the control of the Northern Pacific Rail
road Company and intend to operate the
same jointly with the Great Northern,
anfi in effect bring about a consolidation
by removing all competition and all riv
alry between these roads. To this end
the Northern Securities Company was or
ganized in New Jersey to acquire a con
trolling amount of tho stock of the Great
Northern and the Northern Pacific rail
road companies in exchange for its own
stock, and it is through this company the
unity of management and control is to be
effected.
"As soon as this fact became known to
me I felt it my duty as Governor to do
everything in my official power to oppose
the consolidation or amalgamation of
these properties within the State of Min
nesota. If there is such a consolidation
contemplatedâ and that fact seems to be
practically concededâ it is an open
violation of the law, as well as
the declared public policy of the
State of Minnesota, and I feel that
I should be negligent of my duties as the
official head of the State if I remained
quiescent â¢ under such circumstances I
have been Informed that the States which
you gentlemen represent as Governors
and Attorneys General have constitution
al or statute laws similar In effect to
those of the State of Minnesota and that
this was a question, in which our State
was not alone interested. Acting upon
this belief. I took the liberty of asking
for this conference of Governors and At
torneys General of the various States
through which these two roads pass, be
lieving that all such States were equaDy
interested in maintaining the principle
heretofore asserted in the State of Min
nesota and reasserted here In its objec
tion to this consolidation. I felt that the
interests were so vast and at the same
time so similar to those of our own State
that the States of. which you gentlemen
are the official- heads should be consulted
and, If possible, such methods of proced
ure adopted as would be uniform.

fice her own wishes in order that bcr
mother, who 13 now in Paria, misht bo
present at the ceremony.
At luncheon in Sherry's last night,
when a friend commented upon the suc
cess she had attained, the young woman
laughingly replied that her newly founU
happiness was sufficient to give her .i
voice, had she never possessed any. Ru
mors then began to circulate, all of whieli
she fenced with half denials, until to-day,
when seen in the Walton Hotel in thU
city she admitted the truth of her jest.
"Should I speak?" said Mme. Sanderson,
questioningly, turning to a friend and to
a stalwart Frenchman who was with ncj
in her private parlor. "My mother had
not been told of it yet."
" "Oh tell it," counseled the young wo
man's' friend. So Mme. Sanderson told it.
as she toyed with a superb diamond ring.
"We have been engaged just no time at
all " said Mme. Sanderson, "but I haw.
known him for many years. He arrived
here just a week ago and he says that he
came to America for no other purpose
than to ask me to marry him. Silly,
wasn't it?"
"I made up my mind I would have 't
settled and so I came to America and
I shall never ceasa rejoicing that I di1
so," broke In the Comte,
"We shall sail on the Kron Frinz on
January 4," said Mme. Sanderson, "ami
will arrive in Paris about a week later. I
shall continue on the stage."
The Comte de Fitz-James bowed low
as he kissed the fingers of his future f
bride, and said: "
"Surely my dear win be happy if devo-
tion can make her so."
The Comte Henri de Fitz-James Is an
officer of cavalry In the French territo

oppose this consolidation. This determi
nation is not entered into with any spirit
of hostility toward railroads. Our State
has dealt liberally with them and ha*

cultivation by the people of Minnesota.".
The visiting Governors and Attorneys
General were given a. dinner this evening
at Governor Toole's residence and later
were guests of the Montana Club.

LUMBER MILLS
IN A COMBINE
Strong Association Is
Formed to Change
the Prices.
Development of Trade in
Foreign Markets Com
pels Action.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 30.-A new
association of lumbermen, the formation
of which was being completed in Tacoma
to-day, will, in a few days, announce
startling changes in the price ol" lumoer
for foreign shipments, as well as for local
consumption, with an important ruling on
the output and capacity of the various
mills.
TJ -r ht; . comblne , embraces all the mills in
British Columbia and Washington and is
backed by the banks as well as by the
moneyed men of Puget Sound, who have
been endeavoring to complete the asso
ciation for the last eieht months.
... . xnost radical changes brought about
will be an increase of $4 per thousand to
local consumers for most classes of lum
ber and an increase of $2 on foreign ship
ments. An allotment of the output of
each mill, calculated upon its capacity
and its average output during other years,
w JiL also ,, be n?ced by the new association.
lhe mills have been making very little
money for several years, but with the
larger demand for lumber in the develop
ment of markets in China, South America
and Australia the prospects are consid
ered good enough to insure a large busi
ness at increased prices.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, ., DECEMBER 31, 1901.
ROSORMONDE AT RIPE, MELLOW ODDS
BEATS GREYFELD OUT IN A DRIVE
Tower of Candies Is the Only Successful Favorite at Oakland.
Landseer Fails to Bring Home the Coin-â Flo Culver Defeats
Quadraâ¢ Staid Oid Wyoming Reaches Wire First Once More
WHEN Andrew Carnegrie or
some of the other noted phil
anthropists have tired of dis
bursing their wealth in en
dowing libraries, colleges and
such like and find that they still tip the
scales forty or fifty millions overweight,
it might by way of divertisement furnish
them a surer coin outlet if they could be
induced to back Greyfeld every time he
starts. Bob Smith's horse looked to have j
a rosy chance to win the Encinal handicap
at Oakland yesterday, with but 109 pounds
in The saddle, and from the way the race
was run should have done so. Unfortu
nately, though, for Greyfeld, the Pueblo
stable entry, Kosormonue, upset matters.
In the handicap on Saturday the latter
mare fell heir to more than her share or I
ill racing lu<;_, but yesterday bid the Held ,
farewell at *>e start. She carried Kanscn ;
and ninety-eight pounds and under torced
draught, lasted long enough to beat Grey
feld a neck, covering the mile and hny
yards in 1:43%; Bullman ran Greyfeld
on two or three sand bars, weathered
two or three typhoons and at the head j
of the stretch was blown half a dozen
leagues out of his course, but still he
probably encountered no worse weather
than Goldone, Janice or Sir Hampton.
Bullman laid his bad luck at the door of
Waterbury, the skipper of Varro, but
Waterbury doesn't know a leg lock from
a half-Nelson. Jackson roae Goldone
through the stretch as if afflicted with
lecomotor ataxia, while Birkenruth s tiller
work on Janice, the favorite, resembled
that of a land lubber who had never
learned to box the compass. Tommy-
Burns on Sir Hampton was bumped at the
start, but did not drift out to tne Faral
lon-JS before crowding on all sail. He did
first rate until becalmed, just in sight or
the post.
An average Sunday crowd crossed the
bay and found the guessing more difficult
than usual. Tower of Candles, a favorite,
lighted everything up temporarily, but all
the other choices went out. The books
undoubtedly collected a few dollars.
In. the introductory sprint over the Fu
turity course with the weights raised
twenty pounds above the scale. Tower of
Candles a 7 to one favorite, ran away
from her field. Caesar Young's filly shoul
dered 126 pounds and with Tommy Burns
up led Alzura out four lengths. Rose of
Ililo finished third.
At the start of the mile selling
run. the barrier ; was carried away,
seriouslv impairing the chances of the
favorite Plead. The latter mare with I^ee
Jackson in the saddle bad to weave his
way from the rear, and was then beaten
a length by Canejo, a 9 to 1 chance, ridden
by Mounce. The show fell to Aloha II, a
15 to 1 shot. Alfred C quit after show
ing early speed.
Roscoe Troxler, the Texas rider, won
the rirst race at the meeting on Flo Cul
ver, in the two-year-old sprint at six
furlongs, in a pretty finish with Quadra
and Landseer. Troxler was pocketed be
hind Quadra and San Lution to the
stretch, where he got out. and at the end
downed the first named filly a neck. Land
seer, backed from 6 down to 11 to 5 favor
itism, was cut off on the back stretch, and
then finished a close third.
Owner Tom. Ryan's Constellator made
his first appearance in the seven-furlong
run. and because of good work reports
ruled an 8 to 5 favorite. The Brutus horse
ran as if a trifle short, for he passed it
up in the run home. Johnny Woods
astride Wyoming overtook Goal Runner,
the pacemaker, the last eighth of a mile,
scoring- -without effort. Sweet Tooth -was
cut eff at the start.
The veteran Pat Morrlssey, an 8 to 5
chance for the final mile run, looked all
over a winner at one time, but eventually
found the route too far.
Bullman on McNamara, an 8 to 1 shot,
then took command, coming in first, two
lengths before Alicia, another outsider.
Track Notes.
â  Birkenruth is not riding in the form he
showed before his suspension. Possibly
he is now a member of the Venus Social
Club, an organization devoted to astron
omy and shrimp salads. Many of its
members arise too early and retire too
late.
Sweet Tooth, which started in the seven
furlong run, sported the colors of the New
York turfman, L. V. Bell.
After two weeks of excellent work with
the starting gate, Dick Dwyer gave way
yesterday to Jake Holtman, who will dis
patch the fields during- the next fortnight.

San Rafael Disturbed by
Discovery of an
Explosive.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 30.â This city was
thoroughly aroused to-day when sticks of
giant powder were found in a room at
tached to the German Hotel in this city.
For a time it was feared mat the un
known fiend that has been burning barns
here had Invented a new method of de
struction and that hereafter he would
make use of dynamite.
Constable Louis Hughes was Immedi
ately notified of the find and proceeded
to make an Investigation. Four sticks of
giant powder were found wrapped up
with some fuse and lying on a table In
a room at the hotel. The room Is one
used by guests and adjoins the dining
room. The fuse was uncapped and there
was no particular danger in the package.
Constable Hughes said:
"I find that four men from the Point
San Pedro Quarry stopped at the hotel
last night. It is probable that one of
them had the powder "in his. pocket and
left It on the table after washing and
before eating. From the harmless condi
tion of the powder I do not think any
harm was or could have been intended."
Patrick Cassidy, who was burned while
trying to save several horses from his
burning barn last night, is resting easily.
He was terribly burned, but will recover.
The officers have so far failed to get any
clew of the barn burner.

STORM TOSSES
GOLDEN CARGO
Cottage City Has a Haz
ardous Voyage Prom
Alaska. X
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 30.â
After a tempestuous voyage, the steam
ship Cottage City arrived this evening
from Sitka and way points, bringing fifty
passengers and $70,000 in bullion.
Captain Wallace reports that he escaped
the storm of December 25, but on the 28th
encountered a gale of unusual fury. The
sea was lashed into a foam and the wind
blew with-such violence that the Cottag6
City was compelled to seek shelter in
Carter Bay and it was with difficulty the
vessel was held at anchor.
For the second time a jury has brought
in a verdict of murder in the first degree
against Homer Bird. 'The trial com
menced December 19 and on Christmas
the jury returned a verdict. The murder
of which Bird was found guilty was one
of the most atrocious in the criminal
annals of Alaska.
Captain Gilgore, of the revenue cutter
Rush, who arrived from Sitka- on the
Cottage City, expressed grave fears for
the steamer Discovery. He says that It
may be possible that she Is safely at an
chor in some sheltered place in a crip
pled condition, but the fact that nothing
has been heard of her for forty days,
when she was at Kodlak, makes the
chance of her safety very doubtful.
McCormack Stays the Limit.
ALLENTOWN. Pa., Dec. 3O.-Jim Jef

SCIENCE STAYS
HAND OF DEATH
Chicago Professor An
nounces Marvelous
Discovery.
Finds Means of Preventing
Disintegration in Cells of
Sea Creatures.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 30.â Another startling
scientific discovery in psychology, which
some investigators say, is a long' step
toward revealing the secret of immortal
life and by which science has succeeded in
checking the death process In the living
cell, was announced by Professor Jacques
Loeb of the University of Chicago to-day.
The announcement was made at the first
session of the annual conference of Amer
ican Psychologists, which is meeting at
the university, and was the cause of con
siderable stir among the many scientists
present.
Professor Loeb's paper, the subject of
which was "Prolongation of life In un
fertilized eggs of the sea urchin by po
tassium cyanide," gave the result of ex
periments conducted by himself and his
assistants at Woods Holl, Mass., last
summer. He said:
"As the result of my experiments on
the eggs of the sea urchin and star fish
I am of the opinion that death is not due
to disintegration in the life cell. Death
is an active process, which starts with
the first appearance of life in the cell
and which, if not checked, leads to an
nihilation. My experiments show that in
an unfertilized egg two processes start
at onceâ one toward life and the other
toward death. My object was to find some
substance that would check the death
process and be a preservative of life- In
the cell. +
"The egg naturally dies at once unless
it becomes fertilized. Enzymlc action, or
a sort of fermentation, seems to be re
sponsible for this mortiferous process.
Hoping to counteract this enzymic action
I put some eggs into a solution of potas
sium cyanide and the result was impres
sive beyond our fondest dreams.
"Not only was the death process in the
eggs checked, but the solution acted as
a preservative of the life cell. That life
was thus sustained was proved when the
eggs were removed from the solution and
hatched. I succeeded in preserving life
in this way as long as seven days."
What the ultimate results of experi
ments upon the budding cell life of higher
animals will be scientists would not vent
ure to predict.
Professor Martin Fischer, one of Pro
fessor Loeb's assistants, declared that
ability to check the death process in cells
from which the mature animal spring9
means the solution of the problem of end
less life. Scientists are eager to see how
far up in the animal scale Professor Loeb
can control conditions of life and death.
Several other papers of importance were
read during the meeting. Professor D. J.
Lingle of the University of Chicago gave
the Yesults of his research into the effect
of common salt upon the heart beat. He
affirmed with great emphasis that,
contrary to the statement of Professor
Howells of Harvard, salt is the sole agent
responsible for the rhythmic action of the
heart.
Professor F. S. Lee of Columbia Uni
versity made some Interesting reports up
on the action of alcohol upon muscles.
By experiments upon the frog he demon
strated that a small amount of alcohol
increased the working power of muscle,
enabled it to make more rapid contrac
tions In a given space of time and delayed
fatigue; that, in short. It mide the muscle
a much better machine. In larger quan
tities, however, alcohol was detrimental
in all respects.

GIVE MEDAL TO SCrffiLEY"
Spokesman Pays Tribute to the TJn
. selfish Conduct of the Hear
Admiral.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30.â The Maryland
councils of the Junior Order of Mechanics
to-night presented to Admiral Schley a
magnificent medal studded with diamonds
as an evidence of .their esteem "and ad
rciration of his services to th'e country.
The presentation took place in Admiral
Schley's apartments in this city and was
made by a committee from the councils,
which came over from Baltimore on an
afternoon train.
Rev. C. F. Wyatt, acting as spokesman
of the committee, referred to Admiral
Schley's participation In the battle of San
tiago and his conduct following it, and
added that his unselfishness had en
deared him to the hearts of the American
people. Referring to the court of in
quiry. Dr.- Wyatt said that the people had
sympathized with the admiral in the or
deal through which he had passed and
had substituted the minority report for
that of the majority, because they
weighed opinions rather than counted
them.
Admiral Schley sincerely thanked the
committee and added:
The services which this beautiful emblem is
intended to commemorate were those which
every lover of home and country will eladly
perform for his people and for their prestige
It was my good fortune to have participated
on that eventful third day of July in an en
gagement which readjusted the geographical
lines of this continent, and this testimonial
from your organization is only another recogni
tion from my fellow countrymen that these
services have met their approval. I thank
you again for this kind tribute.

Michigan are ready to step upon

Every man is in splendid physical
shape and is playing his game. Stanford
is supremely confident that the Wolver

Coach Yost's men score ' a touchdown it
will be on its merits alone.
On the other hand the Michigan eleven
expects to keep up the admirable work it
has done this season by piling up a big
score against the cardinal.. The men have
become acclimated and are feeling in
grand fettle. They have discarded the

On Christmas day the men lined up in

into play that they broke their cleats in
the soft sand. To avoid accidents of this
kind the players have tried the regula

Michigan seems to possess even greater

DEFINES LAKE
COUNTY MINES
Aubury Brings Out First
of Long Expected,
The State Mining Bureau yesterday re
ceived from the State Printing Office at
Sacramento the first copy of a register
of the mines and minerals of Lake
County, which was prepared under the
direction of State Mineralogist Aubury.
Some curiosity has been manifested con
cerning this register, which Is the first of
a series of ten which will, severally, ex
ploit L-ake, San Diego, El Dorado, Placer,
Ainadcr, Santa Barbara and Shasta coun
ties in an entirely, new and practical way
for the .benefit of all concerned in mining
as operators or investors. With the Lake
County register is a map upon which are
figures showing the exact locality of min
eral1 deposits mentioned in the register.
The register and map are, therefore, sup
plementary. Each successive register will
be accompanied by a map. -The introduc
tion to the register of Lake County indi
cates the general scope of the work un
dertaken. In part it is as follows:
: The Register of Mines ' and Minerals of the
State of California, issued by the State Mining
Bureau, is intended to give information con
cerning the gold mines â quartz, hydraulic,
dritt, placer, etc.â as well as a list of mills
and arrastras. and also to give corresponding
information relating to each of the mineral
substances mined or commercially utilized In
the State. This forms both a State and county
directory of the mines of California, the reg
ister being 'so printed that each - v county is
represented in a separate pamphlet. .The reg
ister wlir answer for the emdanee of thoss
who want" to. look at any particular mine or
to learn tlie essential facts concerning it. Xo
accompany- the printed " register is a topo-
Kraphieal map -of each county. , showing all
mineral locations, . etc. â  These maps are on the
scale of two miles to one inch. .The mines
are numbered in the table and a corresponding
number tm; the. map indicates the : exact loca
tion. One may find from this, approximately,
how far he must go from any specified town or
station to reach any particular mine and may
, learn the location of railroads, trails, roads,
etc. â  , . .it.
The Lake County register has a pre
liminary summary of the mineral re
sources of the county, and this is fol
lowed by a tabulation In which the min
ing deposits are enumerated and de
scribed with considerable detail. Prom thÂ«
table it appears that Lake County has
sixteen quicksilver mines, four copper
mines, one onyx deposit, one chrome iron
deposit, two iron mines and one oil well,
i ne quicksilver mines are nearest the fol
lowing places: Sulphur Creek, In Colusa
County; Middletown.TLower Lake, Quick
silver Knoxville and Lakeport. in Lake
County, respectively. The one oil well is
near Lakeport. The extraordinary rich

Judge Fritz Has Been Successful it*.
Bringing Two Male Parents
to Time.
Judge Fritz has for the second- time
played the role of protector for chil
dren who are neglected by their male
parent, and he feels proud of tho
achievement. A week ago Joseph Thomp
son, a longshoreman, residing on Perry
street, between Harrison and Bryant, was
brought before him for getting drunk and
neglecting his family by wasting all his
wages. The Judge made him promise to
take the pledge and in future give his
wife enough money to support her and
ihe children, and continued the case for a
week. Yesterday Mrs. Thompson ap
peared in court and said that her husband
had taken the pledge and had not tasted
a drop since, giving her all the . money
she needed. The Judge continued the case
for another two weeks to Ee?'how Thomp
son behaved himself.
Yesterday he had a similar case before
him. Christian Peterson, a longshoreman,
was charged by a neighbor. Mrs. Mar
garet McClenegan, 504 Greenwich street,
with frequenting saloons and not provid
ing for his four young children, who were
produced in court. They had to depend
upon the neighbors for support. The
Judge made Peterson promise to go to
work at once and totally abstain from
liquor for a week, and to bring him a
strict account next Monday of what he
had earned and what he had spent for
necessaries. The case was continued till
then.
Laborer Gets His Trunk.
Justice of the Peace Daniels gave judg
ment yesterday in favor of Robert Wad
dell, who sued James Gately, a Potrero
bcarding-house keeper, and the Risdon
Iron Works for the recovery of a trunk
retained by Gately. Waddell came here
from the East under contract to labor
for the iron works, but deserted his po
sition after one day. Gately refused to
give Waddell his trunk until he had paid
for hl.s^fare from the Kast. Justice Dan
iels now orders the return of the trunk
or its equivalent in value. . .

ANOTHER TRIAL
Motion to Dismiss the
Second Indictment
Is Granted.
The second indictment against A. C.
Widber, ex-City Treasurer, charging him
with the embezzlement of $13,000 of the
city funds, was, on motion of Attorney
Pelxotto, for the defendant, dismissed by
Judge Cook yesterday on the ground that
the sixty days during which the trial
should have been held had elapsed. The
point was made in view of the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Bergerot case
from ban Jose.
The Judge in granting the mAtion said
he would like to have the point decided
upon by the Supreme Court, but the Dis
trict Attorney says he is doubtful if hf
can appeal in view of the fact that the
indictment was dismissed, which practi
cally ends the matter. It the indictment
had been quashed it would have been dif
ferent. - ,
When Widber was sentenced to eight
years in San Quentin, about three years
ago, the second charge was put on th>Â»
reserve calendar without objection, so
that in the event of Widber being released
on parole he could be tried again on that
charge.

SUPREME COURT SEALS
FATE OF SPECULATOR
T.ulare County Man Tries to Maka
Too Much Out of Squirrel
Bounty.
The Supreme' Court decided yesterday
that John A. Howard of Visalia must be
punished for attempting to : obtain the
bounty for dead squirrels offered by Tu
lare County, on rodents' tails Imported
from Alameda County. v
The animals became such a pest , to
farmers that the Board of Supervisors
decided to offer a bounty of 3 cents each
for their destruction. It was provided
that the tails of the squirrels must be
produced and that an affidavit must be
presented stating that they were killed
in Tulare* County. The. people of Visalia
and ; vicinity l soon exhausted the supply
of squirrels^ and Howard went over into
Alameda ( County - and/ collected 12,000 of
the necessary ââ¢ tails. He and two : friends
presented the evidence and. made affidavit
that. the animals had been killed within
county limits. - One of the friends finally

Stanford engaged in secret practice to

a will and played splendidly. Signals
were given with a snap and the play was
executed in faultless style. Coach Fick-
confessed where the squirrel tails had
been secured and arrests followed.
Howard was tried on the charge of at
tempting to obtain money by false pre
tenses and was convicted. He appealed,
but, the Supreme Court holds that h'.s
punishment is just.

"CHINESE IN TBANSIT"
FBATJD IS DETECTED
Mongolian Immigrants Mention Fic
titious Firms in Mexico as Their
Future Employers.
The lack of good faith on the part of
Chinese Immigrants seeking to pass
through this country on their way to
Mexico was forcibly illustrated yesterday
in the case of three coolies who swore be
fore the Chinese Bureau that they were
en route to a town in Mexico, near the
border line, under contract to work for
three firms, of which they gave the
names. - Something in their manner
aroused the suspicions of the Chinese Bu
jeau and they were denied a landing.
In the . meantime Customs Collector
Stratton addressed a confidential letter to
the American Consul in tho Mexican town
named, inquiring 'whether there were
such firms there as were mentioned by
the Chinese. The Collector received a
reply yesterday informing him that no
such firms existed and never had. The
Chinamen will be deported.

Dave Brown of Stanford will referee j
the game and in all probability Bert
Oliver, the giant Reliance guard, will act I
as umpire. Brown has been an official of !
some kind in every big football contest. â 
He was at one time Stanford's best mile j
runner. He is well up in the rules and I
should prove a capable man. He is the |
choice of both teams. Oliver's excellent
decisions in the last intercollegiate game
v/on him the approval of the victors and
'vanquished. He acted justly to both sides
and his gentlemanly manner and coolness
won him the admiration of students in j
both colleges. â 
Every seat for the coming contest has
been sold and standing room will be at
a premium. The grand stand will accom
modate 3000 people; but if it were twice
its size it would r.ot contain the people j
who are anxious to see the contest.

MAY NOT PAVE
MISSION ROAD
City Attorney Lane Says'
the Procedure Is
Illegal.
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Works yesterday that the Board of Su
pervisors had no power to authorize the
expenditure of 113,000 upon the paving Oi.
Mission street from Silver avenue to
Onondaga avenue and advises that, the
bids therefor be- considered as void and
that the check deposited be returned.
This opinion will be unwelcome news to
the property owners along the line of the
proposed improvement who subscribed
Wo.OOC for the purpose, the city appropriat
ing a like sum. The opinion says:
The city, under the charter, cannot expend
its funds for the pavement of an unaccepted
street. Nor can the city expend more than
$10,000 per year for the improvement of county
roads, if there be any such roads within the
limits of the municipality. Therefore, what
ever Mission street may be, whether county
road or city street, there was no power in the
Board of Supervisors to authorize the expendi
ture of $13,000 for the work proposed and no
power In the Beard of Public Works to call
for bld3 therefor.
The proposed street work involved herein is
Important and necessary and it may be that
by following: another line of, procedure it can
be done by the city, but the procedure taken
ha3 not been such as the law countenances.

The Yosemite Athletic Club, which has

for big matches nest year. At Its head is
Sol Levison. Among the gentlemen who
are said to have an interest in the new
organization 13 Harry Corbett. James C.
Kennedy, matchmaker of the Twentieth
Century Club, which brought oft many
important bout3 during tha past year,
will act in the same capacity for the new
club.
Kennedy may not be overpopular on this
coast, but it is a fact that boxers of abil
ity place implicit reliance in his word and
judgment. He is really the only man who
can induce Fitzsimmons to re-enter the
ring, and he is now using every effort to
get the blacksmith to box in this city.
If he succeeds Jeffries and Fitzsimmons
will battle here for the championship in
February.
The Yosemite Athletic Club now has a
bona fide membership, and as socn as Its
gymnasium is completed Levison will ap

"A Lady of Quality," Who Is Interesting Theater-Goers at the

1JUST dropped in,"in a friendly sort of
way," to see an act of "Carmen"
last Sunday night at the Grand
Opera-house, and found an audi
ence as large as a Calve house en
joying Miss Seligman'B conception of the
sultry heroine. The house looked tarn
last night in comparison, though tiie
ragtime moralities of the strenuous
Clorinda in "A Lady of Quality serve
Miss Seligman with equal felicity
On the whole it "was a neat and well
balanced performance that was given by
the house company and the reigning

and enjoyable, and was well applauded

is an impossible sort of person when she
is considered seriously. It is therefore
the part of wisdom to take herâ if you
take her at all-lightly. She is a pretty
good and plausible sortâ as they went in
those daysâ for the first acts, but the
thr-ad ot the likely gets pretty well
later. A bonny tomboy brought
up by her fox-hunting papa to swear,
drink and hunt with the best of his sex
may not be the prettiest spectacle, but she
has happened. Also, having sown her
wild oats like a gentleman she has fre
quently repented.
But I doubt me much if she has ever
pinked a rejected loverâ after attaining
to British matronhoodâ stuffed him un
der the couch and held a pink tea over
his unlamented remains. Also it is not
the habit of Dukes of the common or
garden variety to tell the lady, when she
casually informs them of the little cir
cumstance, that they love her just the
same. Which is all why it Is better not
to take "A Lady of Quality" too seri
Â°UMiVs Selieman has the name role and
succeeds in lifting the part to conviction
occasionally. Herschel Mayall plays the
villain with a pretty accent and without
his usual amplitudinous sighs. William
Bernard has a part to fit as Lord Hum
phrey Ware, H. D. Byers does a sturdy
bit of work as Sir Cnristopher Croweil
and Fred J. Butler is sufficient unto the
needs of his part as Sir Geoffrey Wildairs.
Gilbert Gardner is excellent as the chap
lain, nd later s Twemlow, and Charles
Waldron Is a good Duke, looking the part
to satisfaction. Elsa von Braham is a
graceful Lady Betty and Caroline Francis
Cooke pleases as Anne Wildairs.
They have mounted the piece well at
the Grand Opera-house and it should
serve an evening's turn. Next week is
the last week of Miss Seligman's engage
ment and for the farewell programme
will be given a grand double bill, Gilbert's
"Comedy and Tragedy" and a dramatiza
tion of "Caval'.eria Rusticana.".

When the Commissioners recently hand

week at the Alcazar. Judging from the
crowded audience of last evening it is
sure of a good run. All the characters
were well sustained and Frank Bacon, as
Charley's Aunt, excelled himself.
M. L. Alsop, who took the part of Jack
Chesney, made an ideal lover, while Hen
ry Shumer, as Charley Wykeham, was
the typical college undergraduate. Both
helped in a : great measure to make the
play the success it Is, while Paul Gerson,
as Colonel Sir Francis Chesney, Bart.,
and Miss Marie Howe,, as Donna Lucia
d'Alvadorez, were excellent in their parts.

Central.
"The Two Sisters" at its initial per
formance at the Central Theater last
night scored a pronounced hit. The play
is the best " that the company has pro
duced in several months and a most suc- y
cessful run is assured if the enthusiasm of
last night's audience is any criterion.
The villain, the hero, the wronged girl,
a promiscuous use of firearms and the
other usual characteristics of the melo
drama are all present; but, as is unusual,
they add to rather than detract from the
proper rendering of the play. Some of
the scenes are laughable in the extreme
and the players carry the thing forward
with so much vim that interest never lags
for a moment.
Hallett Thompson, Stanley Ross, James
Corrigan, Annette Marshall, Agnes
Ranken and Margaret Marshall all ap
pear at their best and are excellently sup
ported by the remainder of the cast.
"The Girl with the Naughty, Naughty
Wink," sung by Georgie Cooper, assisted
by Mae Keene, Zora Irwin, Minnie Chap
man and Helen Day, received an amount
of applause that has seldom been equaled
at the Central.
California.
Black Patti and her troubadours are
giving a good show to good houses, and
while no cartloads of flowers are being
hoisted over the footlights there are
trainloadsof applause. While Ernest Ho
fean, the best colored minstrel . on the
stage, is missed from the troupe this sea
son, his place is satisfactorily filled by
John Rucker, "the Alabama Blossom."
Rucker is funny by nature and refined by
art, and is by all odds the best number
in the show. The Watts come nextâ a
clever pair of singers and dancers. The
cake-walk is very funny â funnier than one
would expect, combining as it does the
two extremes of grace and grotesqueness.
The performance has not a dull moment
in it and closes with an operatic pot
pourri, the "Inflammatus," from Rossini's
"Stabat Mater," being especially well
sung, followed by a selection from the
third act of "Martha."

To the audience at the Orpheum Thea

COLONEL EVANS
SAYS NOTHING
Declines to Affirm or
Deny Story of His
Promotion.
Wells, Fargo & Co. Directors
to Elect President
Thursday.
: The. exclusive publication by The Call
of the announcement that Colonel Dudley
Evans'' would be elected as the successor
of John J. Valentine to the presidency of
Wells, Fargo & Co.'s r Express was the
leading topic of conversation in business
circles yesterday. Inasmuch as it was
confidently expected that the honor would
fall to a San Francisco man the news that
Valentine's mantle of office would be
thrust upon the shoulders of a New Ydrk
official of the company was a revelation,
to many connected with the big* corpora
tion.
The disclosure was the subject of more
than one conference among the directors
during the day. These gentlemen affected
to know nothing of the matter when ques
tioned, and all declared that the "story
was premature and therefore untrust
worthy. They did not deny the truth of
the statement that Colonel Evanf was
the coming man, but none could be found
who was willing to confirm the report
that the Huntington influence in Evans
interest had asserted itself and that his
selection for the responsible post was a
certainty.
It is well known that the Southern Fa
cific holds heavy interests in Wells, Fargo
& Co?, and that H. E. Huntington was
made a director of the express company
in order that those interests might not
suffer. Since Huntington's election as
director the Southern Pacific has changed
hands, and E. H. Harriman is now its
guiding spirit. It happens that Harri
man and Evans are quite friendly, and
when Valentine's illness reached the fatal
stage the question of selecting his suc
cessor was at once taken up. Colonel
Evans was sent to this city at once to
look after affairs, and following him came
letters signed by Huntington to several
â directors requesting their indorsement of
Evans for the position: It was a bitter
pill for some of them to swallow, but as
one director said yesterday: "The influ
ence of wealth and power is not to be
overcome." This means that the influ
ence of the Southern Pacific in the inter
nal affairs of Wells, Fargo & Co. will not
be ignored when the matter of selecting
Valentine's successor finally comes up for
action at the forthcoming meeting of the
board.
Directors Meet on Thursday.
Although efforts were made by the
Wells, Fargo & Co. officials to conceal
the fact, it was learned from authorita
tive sources that the directors would meet
next Thursday at which time the va
cancy on the board as well as in the
presidency will be filled. It was at first
intended to meet to-day, but circum
stances arose which rendered a postpone
ment imperative.
While many employes of the express
company concede that Evans will be the
next president, they scout the allegation
that the main offices of the company will
be removed to New York. They claim
this action would disorganize the com
pany in that its heaviest interests are
centered in the West. The argument is
advanced that the company recently went
to the expense of erecting a large office
building and that the removal of the
main offices would be bad business pol
icy. Should this action be taken the
building must inevitably prove a losing
investment, something the directors will
not permit. What effect these arguments
will have upon the Eastern influences
now at work remains to be seen. It is
certain that the contemplated removal
will meet with opposition, even though it
be advocated by the incoming president.
The election of Colonel Evans to the
presidency may prove to be of advan
tage to the company's interests, but to
those in the line of advancement, had the
honor fallen upon either Colonel Gray or
Homer S. King, it will be as a wet blan
ket on a frosty morning. The possibility
that one of the gentlemen named would
capture the prize had given birth to hopes
in the breasts of many departmental man
agers that they would be Advanced a step
with the coming of the new year. The
latest developments, however, have sent
these hopes aglimmering and the faces
cf many employes are as somber as the
sable decorations which adorn the com
pany's building. That the election of Col
onel Evans means changes in the official
staff is regarded as a certainty. What
these .changes may be is now a matter of
grave concern to all the employes con
cerned.
Officials Are Reticent.
Colonel Gray, first vice president of the
company, made the following statement
to a Call representative yesterday:
The announcement that Colonel Evans would
succeed the late John J. Valentine to the presi
dency of Wells, Fargo & Co. was quite prema
ture. I do not know how the report gained
currency. I know that the directors have not
authorized an announcement of the kind. No
call for a meeting of the board has been issued
by me. I will admit Colonel Evans Is a very
Influential man on the board of directors, and
Influence in all human affairs counts for much.
That is all 1 have to say concerning the mat
ter. .
Homer S. King, who was prominently
named as the probable successor to the
presidency of the company, declined to
discuss the matter of Evans' selection on
the ground that he knew nothing about
it. He said the directors would probably
settle the matter at their next meeting,
but he was unable to say when the meet
ing would be held. The subject of the re
ported removal of the main office of the
corporation to the East he refused to talk
of for publication.
Colonel Evans was se'een at the Palace
Hotel last night and asked to give his
views concerning his impending elevation
to the presidency. He replied that he
could not discuss the matter in advance
of any action the directors might take.
He declined either to affirm or deny the
report published by The Call. In reply
to the question as to the date of the
forthcoming meeting he said he did not
know the precise time. It might be next
Thursday and it might be some other
Thursday. With this the interview came
to a close.
The numerous friends of Colonel Evans
extended him their congratulations yes

MARY MORGHAN
GETS DIVORCE
Judge Seawell Separates
the Oyster Man and
His Wife.
Dressed in the very latest make of
tailor-made gowns, topped off by a brand
new sealskin jacket and the latest model
hat, Mrs. Mary B. Moraghan, who is su
ing James B. Moraghan for divorce on the
ground of neglect, looked everything but
a neglected, wife yesterday when she ap
peared in Judge Seawell' s court to tell her
tale of woe. She was accompanied by her
father, ei-Policeman Fay, who testified
in her behalf. Moraghan, the alleged ne
glectful husband, did- not put in an ap
pearance during the proceedings, but
poked his head in the doorway of the
court room after the trial and asked the
clerk what had been done to him. Clerk
Grimes informed him that Judge Seawell
had decreed that his wife should get a
divorce and $30 per month alimony and
that he was to have the custody of the
minor child. Mr. Moraghan, evidently
greatly pleased, said "Thank you" and
withdrew his head from the court room.
This settles the marital differences of
the oyster man and his spouse. Twice be
fore Mrs. Moraghan brought suit against
her husband, once for maintenance and
once for divorce, but on each occasion
the> settled their differences out of court.
Maud Nevill, or Maud Cheyney as she
claims she should be called, has secured
another attorney to prosecute her suit for
maintenance against Samuel W. Cheyney,
in th'e person of Henry C. McPike. When
Miss Nevill first commenced proceedings
she was represented by Attorney George
D. Collins, but the latter withdrew from
the case because his rlient accused him
of being derelict in his duties. Miss Nevill
appeared before Judge Sloss yesterday
morning with her new attorney and se
cured a continuance of the trial of her
suit until next Monday.
Miss May Blanche Goldstein is suing to
annul her marriage to Walter R. Huff, a
commercial traveler, on the ground that
Huff has another wife living. The plain
tiff claims that Huff represented to her
that he had been divorced from his first
wife six years ago.
Maggie K. Mason is suinp her husband,
F. M. Mason, a prosperous hardware mer
chant of Ukiah, for divorce oh the ground
of cruelty. The married life of the Masons
has been a stormy one. They were married
in Iowa in 1876, and have three children,
two of whom are of age. Mrs. Mason
says her husband treated her cruelly.
Mrs. Mason asks the court to award her
all the community property, which
amounts to about J5000.
Divorces were granted yesterday to El
len Burns from Frank Burns for extreme
cruelty, Helene Johnson from Peter Vic
tor Johnson for extreme cruelty, Lillie
Harrison from James Harrison for ex
treme cruelty, Katherme Frances Mahnke
from Charles S. Mahnke for extreme
cruelty and Mabel Annie Lawrence from
Willis Lawrence for desertion.
James W. Cook filed a suit for divorce
yesterday against Mary Cook for deser
tion.
Clearing-House Committee Meets.
At a meeting of the Clearing-house As
sociation held yesterday it was decided to
exchange the daily checks at 11:45 a. m.
excepting on Saturdays, when the ex
change will be made at 11 a. m. The
Clearing-house committee was given the
power to change the hour of exchange at
its- own discretion.

ABUSES TRUST
Mrs. Williams Charges
Secretary With Neg
lect of Duty.
Mrs. L.. P. Williams, president of the
board which has control of the "Oriental
House," a place of refuge for abandoned
and homeless Chinese children, filed a pe
tition yesterday for letters of guardian
ship over the person of Chan Ah Ying, a
little Chinese girl who is now the ward
of Frank J. Kane, secretary of the Pacific
Society for the Suppression of Vice, - ;^B
which she makes all sorts of charst^H
against the secretary. * Â«
The Chinese maiden is a resident at the^
Home, but Kane is desirous of taking hÂ«^ J
from there and placing her in charge ck r
Miss Seton, a teacher in the public
schools.
Kane's request for the custody of the
child was refused by Mrs. Kate B. Lake
and Miss Marguerite Lake, superin-<
tendents of the home. Kane then\
sought to obtain possession of the child
on a writ of habeas corpus. Mrs. Lake
promptly filed an objection to the. _&Â«Â£;.
render of the child and the matter was ~
heard before Judge Troutt, who continued
the hearing until Mrs. Lake's return
from her vacation.
Mrs. Williams has now taken the matter
in hand and in her petition she charges
Kane with having been derelict in the
performance of his duties as guardian.
She alleges that Kane has abused his
trust, that he has interests adverse to the
faithful performance of .his duties as a /
guardian and that he is in no position to
perform such duties. V , ,
She further alleges that^Kanes claim
that he intended placing th& child under
the care of Miss Seton is wit:!?"* founda

Mrs. Williams further says that the~?P"
ciety of which Kane Is secretary is absCX,
lutely under his control and that upon**^
his failure to secure the child a systematic
effort to injure the home was made in
Chinatown by means of placards in which
the orders of the court were grossly mis
represented.
Mrs. Williams further alleges that Kane
wrote a letter to her in which he stated
that he was being importuned by the
Chinese Consul and others to take another
ward of his from the home and place her
In another home.
Mrs. Williams also charges Kane with
requesting her to allow Chan Ah Ting to
be seen by her mother in the presence of
a Miss Flynn, whom, alleges Mrs. Wil
liams, Kane had frequently told her was
unfit to come in contact with any of the
children of the home.

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
v T N pursuance of our endeavor to present the issue
of municipal ownership fairly to the people, in
â¢* prdir that they may be under no illusions, we
nave given the history of the failure of the public
Â£as plant in Toledo, Ohio.
"Golden Rule Jones," Major of Toledo, and one of
the leading advocates of public ownership, in a com
munication to the Toledo Bee gives his version of
thar failure. He says of it: "The Toledo natural
eras plant failed as a municipal enterprise for the fol-.
lowing reasons: because it was an immoral as well
S3 an unbusiness-like proposition for the city to enter
into this business after it had granted two franchises
to two private corporations to carry it on; and be
cause of the hindrances and limitations that city offi
cials are Subjected to in the name of law, which place
those who are/charged with the management of city
property ;at a disadvantage with managers of a pri
vate corporation. This is not because plans have
oeen Â«xJai<J â¢ by corporations to get advantage of the
JJeople. hut because the people have voluntarily ham
pered themselves; because we are yet lacking in an
idcr.l that involves social success. We elect a man
to o'-\rz, and glorify him as little less than a god,
but > sooner is he elected than we begin to apply
the s aps of restraint and manifest our distrust.
Firs; 'e require him to take an oath, next we re-*
tjuirc . im to give a bond for the faithful performance
of dur Then after passing these ordeals we sur
rotnid him with every known hindrance and limita
tior. of law to contract his liberty and cripple his
usefulness as a public servant; and because of this
immature and childlike conception of government
the natural gas trustees were as helpless as babes
when they discovered that the supply was giving out;
v liiis die managers of the private corporation with
which they were competing were free men and exer
cised their best ability to so manage their property
that it â¢would become a success. This is fundamental
ly the reason why the Toledo natqral gas plant
failed, and I repeat that it in no sense proves "the
failure of municipal ownership, but it does prove the
failure of municipal government."
careful- reading of this discloses just what the
Commission on government railroads report
ed1 â that government is a political institution purely,
and cannot be adapted to the transaction of business.
Mayor Jones wants such adaptation , f He does not
mean that municipal government is a failure in con
ducting the civil, political affairs of the people, but
that it is a failure when it goes beyond its police duty
and embarks in business.
The two principles and their antagonism were
never more plainly apparent. This expert in munici
pal paternalism desires the adaptation of government
to business, by removing all the checks and balances
which are necessary to government as a political in
stitution. There must be neither oath, nor bond, nor
legal restraint on the free will and action of the pub
lic officer. He is not even to be as much controlled
as the director of a private corporation, but is seem
ingly to be entirely irresponsible. The theory is
beautiful in its iridescence, but is it not a rainbow?
There appears to be a -decided Northward migra
tion of negroes from the Southern States seeking
\ centers where there are more opportunities for labor
-and better wages. As a result there are npw more
negroes in Massachusetts than in Delaware and al
most as many in Pennsylvania as in Missouri. It is
believed that if these early experiments in migration
prove successful the negro population may eventually
be so diffused throughout the country as to cease to
be a "problem" to any section.
Less than twenty-five years ago there was not a
telephone in the world, but now, according to the "
- Electrical Review, there are no . less than 2,278,717
telephones in use and the companies owning them
have an invested capital of $470,000,000. In addition
there is a capital estimated at $150,000,000 invested in
private telephones. It will be seen that the "hello
' girl" is doing a big business. : ,
SAN FRANCISCO WATER SUPPLY.
WITHIN the last few years medical science
has demonstrated that one of the great
est causes of sickness and the dissemina
tion of germs of disease- in cities is the use of bad
water. Take for illustration the city of Portland,
Oregon, which formerly took ; its water - from the
â¢Willamette River and exhibited a large death rate
from typhoid fever. Through the energy and public
spirit of her citizens this source was abandoned for
a stream haying its rise in the snows of Mount Hood
and taken from a point above the chance of pollu
tion, thus securing an ideal supply of the softest and
purest water, than which there is not a finer in the
world. Since the introduction of this water typhoid
fever has disappeared from the city. Seattle followed
this example, abandoning Lake Washington in its
rear and. going to the mountains west of 'that city,
whence it now draws the needed quantity of the best
water which is beyond the liability of contamination.
Vancouver has a similar supply taken from a glacier
lake nestled in the mountains lying to the north of it.
This water question now confronts San Francisco
and it cannot be put aside. The last three years of
drought have demonstrated that the available re
sources immediately tributary to this city have prac
tically reached their limit. Lobos Creek has recently
been cut off by the city authorities as unsafe for use,
and it can only be a question of a short time before
the same course must be taken with Lake Merced,
which is already menaced by the growth of popula
tion in its .proximity. It is now a serious question
whether the time for such actioij has not arrived. Out
side those two places the present supply of San Fran
cisco is above the average for cities of its size, but if
the water of Lake Merced is mingled with the rest
in use, of course the whole is liable to become vitiated
at any time.
It is well known that during the last two years the
Spring Valley Company has been severely strained to
meet the usual demands upon it. The reservoirs in
San Mateo County arc now at a' very low point, the
lowest for years, and another dry winter will tax the
powers of the company to its utmost. These facts
are published because every resident of the city is
vitally interested in this water question. Every
holder of real estate is directly concerned. . It would
be a safe estimate to assert that the residence prop
erty of San Francisco and Oakland would be en
hanced io per cent in value the moment those cities
had an assured supply of water from the Sierras
similar to that of Portland and other cities â¢ men
tioned. -
Such a supply is available. The serious question is
to get the best one. Its selection and acquisition
should be accomplished at the earliest possible date;
not only that the best may be secured, but that the
contiguous property necessary to insure it against
contamination for all time may also be olAained be
fore the cost of the same has greatly increased.
This is not a matter for political or financial job
bery and the public must take care to suppress any
attempt at it. The wrangle lately exhibited between
the Board of Public Works and the Supervisors'
Committee on Public Utilities proves that the people
of the city must look to private enterprise, skill and
judgment in this contingency, and not trust such a
great enterprise to politicians or their appointees and
sen-ants. The columns of The Call will be open for
suggestions and discussion upon this subject and it
now warns its readers that delay to meet this condi
tion which confronts us may result in grave conse
quences.
This paper has no particular location to recom
mend, no individuals whose interests it seeks to ad
vance. If the rich men of this State are not ready
to invest in this enterprise, then we ask the men of
capital in the East to come forward with their money
as they have done in other instances. There can be
no question that such an investment would be a good
one and its value would increase with the growth of
population. /
Xo scheme would be adequate to meet this situation
which was not capable- of eventually meeting the needs
of two millions of people. Let no such mistakes be
made in this instance as mark the history of water
supply for Boston, New York and other Eastern
cities, but rather build broadly .and mindful of the
needs of generations to come after us. There is no
occasion for the sacrifice of any existing property
by carrying out this project. In a comparatively
few years there will be a line of suburban villages
and residences all the way from San Francisco to San
Jose. The present great need of those* now living
along that stretch of country is an adequate supply
of good water. The Spring Valley Company can
meet that demand and in so doing find use for all it
has to furnish.
A moment's reflection upon the subject tends to
make every resident of this city wonder why it has
been permitted to lie dormant so long. It can only
be explained upon the theory that the business of
everybody imposes no obligation upon any one.
There is nothing which is more conducive to the
comfort and enjoyment, aside from considerations of
health,' than an abundance of pure water such as the
mountains of this State furnish of the very best
quality, fresh from living, perpetual fields of ice and
snow. There can be no comparison between such
an article arid the catchments of rain impounded in
artificial reservoirs which are constantly being pol
luted with mud and other foreign matter and choked
with growths of weed and fungi.
The matter of a few millions of dollars should cut
no figure in a case like this. The one aim must be
to get the best supply at any cosj.' For every dollar
so spent the Value of our property would ; be en
hanced tenfold, to say nothing of the health and
pleasure resulting from its use. The Spring Valley
works have sufficed, in a way, for their day, but they
are only a patchwork creation at the best. With the
rapidly increasing growth of the city let us be mind
ful of the demands which that growth entails and
prepare in good season to meet them.

AN APPALACHIAN PARK.
FROM the well nigh universal support given by
the press of the East to the plan for establish
ing a great national park in the Appalachian
Mountains of North Carolina, it seems likely that
a bill providing for such a park ma}; 1 be enacted at
this session of Congjess. The benefit?) resulting from
the national parks in the West are recognized, and
very naturally the Eastern people desire a similar
large park on their side' of the country.
Professor Shaler of Harvard has .Recently given
strong support to the advocates of the/park by point
ing out in a scientific way the advantages that wpuld
result from it. It is proposed that the Government
condemn and purchase not less than a thousand

square miles of the: mountain* lands- â¢ The lands are
comparatively worthless for agriculture f at presenx,'.
owing, to their inaccessibility to markets, and ; conse
quently the cost would not be great. They are,.how
ever, sufficiently near the ? populous States of the
East to render them available as recreation grounds
for thousands who are unable to come West to enjoy
the wonders of Yellowstone Park and the beauties
of Yosemite. " 4 ;
* The region has an attraction for scientific students
of- forestry from the fact that it is in the very heart
of the broad leaved forests of Eastern America, and
where as Professor Shaler says: "A greater 'â  num
ber of the hundred or so important trees attain their
full growth than in any other equally extensive field."
In. fact he argues that the region was the original
birthplace of these kinds of trees, and that from that
district they spread over the world. He says: "That
in this district the varieties of- the group are more
plentiful than elsewhere may be due to the fact that '
here they were nurtured and have here attained their
characteristic qualities." -
At this juncture Jn our affairs whatever tends to
preserve American forests and to interest and edu-i
cate the American 'people in the value, and usefulness
of forests deserves the support of Congress.' An Ap
palachian ,park would undoubtedly help' to accom
plish that education. It is to be hoped therefore
that it will soon be provided.
A statistician who has been figuring out the
chances of an American boy in politics estimates that
each boy has one chance in 30,000,000 of becoming

rpHE Cuban tariff issue increases in interest and
I assumes shapes not foreseen in the beginning.
x Since General Wood discovered our obliga
tion to make the; Cubans permanently prosperous,
the arguments put forth by the junta have been en
tirely worthy of that highlyxremarkable premise.
In the symmetrical development of this country
our policy has been tc make production and manu
facture go hand in hand. When we were part of the
British colonial system the policy of the mother
country prevented the planting of manufactures here.
She wanted to do all of our manufacturing and com
pel us to be an agricultural and pastoral people. In
retrospect it is remarkable that the fighting men in a
population of three millions, with no manufactures,
no powder mills, and without the means to even make
gun flints, should have achieved independence in a
contest with a matured manufacturing country like
England. But they did and took to heart the memory
of their struggles by beginning at once to protect the
foundation of manufactures.
This policy, founded in the patriotic memories of
the Revolution, has been applied to one industry after
another, until we have a development of manufactur
ing power and skill excelling that of any other na
tion. But while this growth has been taking place
our rural industries have begun to suffer. Grain has
been our great staple crop in the North and cotton
in the -Souths The farmers need a greater variety of
crops to get the- return from their land deserved by
their labor. They have claims "upon .the policy and
the party of protection that cannot be safely ignored.
They are not deceived. They know that real pros
perity must be general, not limited, and partial. They
have seen the golden stream that flows from th'c
planting here of new manufacturing industries, by
protecting them. They have seen tin and plate
glass, buttons, silk, and other varieties of manufacture
added to our American list and made to prosper by
protection. They have seen these give work at high
wages to tens of thousands of men, and produce
wealth for the capitalists who embarked in them. They
have seen these interests highly organized and watch
ful lest Congress lift the protecting hand of the gov
ernment and expose them to foreign competition.
From all this the' farmers have learned a lesson.
If wealth come from a variety of manufactures, it
must come also from a variety of crops. If it is not
well for a country to carry all its manufacturing eggs
in one basket, the same rule must apply to its agri
culture. In order to diversify agriculture there must
be protection. The only diversification possible has
been found to be in the production of sugar, tobacco
and rice. The latter is confined to narrower borders
than the other two. Beet sugar and tobacco may
cover an extensive area and occupy millions of
acres of land now used in adding to the grain sur
plus which keeps down the price and reduces the
profits of farming. Â»
The farmers have tasted the sweets of diversified
agriculture fostered by protection, and they have felt
the benefit of the diffused prosperity that has result
ed. They are now asked to surrender this general
and increasing prosperity in order that a few score
sugar planters in Cuba may be suddenly and greatly
enriched. The many are asked to give up their gen
eral gains in order that the few may gain unduly. It
is a cold-blooded proposition of the junta and its
organs. It is accompanied by the threat that unless
we destroy three of our own important agricultural
industries Cuba will annex herself to us and as a
parasitic addition to cur body politic destroy them
in spite of us.
The people will have something to say about fu
ture annexations and this threat will not at present
alarm American farmers. That it has somewhat dis
quieted capital is seen in the proposition that instead
of admitting Cuban sugar free we pay to the planters'
a bounty out of the treasury!
The proposition is a- remarkable incident in the
whole remarkable situation. It is.so.rankly and ob
viously unconstitutional that there is no danger'of its
adoption, but that it is made at all is evidence of the
widespread and increasing anxiety caused by the
operations of the junta.
Let us shift the point of attack to another part of
our protected system and see how it looks'. Suppose
some benevolent person, anxious to insure the pros
perity of aliens, should propose that we close our
American tin, plate glass and silk mills, by giving
free admission to Welsh tin, and French plate glass
and silk! Would such a proposition find any advo
cate in Congress outside the small company of free
traders? "And suppose again that as an alternative
it should be proposed to pay the Welsh tin makers
and the French manufacturers of plate glass and
silks a bounty out of our treasury, would it be tol
erated for a moment? This country was doing verv'
well, before the Spanish war changed the status of
Cuba, and it will continue to do-well after Cuba has>
received the independence, we promised and General
Wood is recalled from the palace of a Governor Gen
eral to the quarters of a soldier. .
The American people do not take their economic
policy from' generals in the army, andwt is well that
this.be understood now, in order that the example
, mav not spread. i â 
A CUBAN irOUNTY.
JOHN BROWN'S OLD HOME BECOMES
A CLUBHOUSE FOR OHIO GOLFERS
SIMPLE HOME ONCE OCCUPIED BY JOHN BROWN. IT STANDS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF AKRON, OHIO,
AND IS NOW BEING USED AS A HEADQUARTERS BY THE PORTAGE GOLF CLUB. THE STRUCTURE'S
ORIGINAL, OUTLINES REMAIN UNCHANGED.
THE home of John Brownâ he whose "soul goes marching
on"â i3 being used by a golf club.
It stands just on the outskirts of Akron, Ohio, and the
Portage Golf Club bought it as a headquarters, where
they could have their sticks kept in order, and rest
after the day on the links.
Members of the club have ' endeavored to keep the house
just as it was when "Ossawatomie" planned for the freedom
of the blacks.
The building is a wooden frame structure, imposing be
cause of the simplicity, of its architecture. Its original out
lines remain unchanged, although it was deemed necessary
to make a few improvements and additions before' the Portage
Club niade it their permanent home.
The interior is practically the same as it was when John
Brown lived there, and his room in the front of the house
still has an old-time air about it. This apartment will be used
by the ladies of the club as a reception room. They have
furnished it very appropriately with antique pieces, and the
tiled' mantelpieces has been allowed to remain unaltered. This
is the colonial room of the house, and it is here that tribute
is paid to the memory of the first owner in the shape of a
large engraving of John Brown, which hangs over the man
telpiece.

Ohio is a favorite home of golfers, and there are many fine
clubhouses within the confines of the State, but none excel
and few equal the Portage Club in extent and beauty. Besides
which it has the additional interest of being the only golf
clubhouse in Ohio with a history.
Aside from the tinge of romance given the place by the fact
that it was once the home of one of the most remarkable
figures In the history of the United States, it i3 noted from,
the fact that it is right on the old historic portage path mailo
by the Indians many years ago in carrying their canoes from
the Cuyahoga to the Tuscarawas River. The land surround
ing the clubhouse was once used as hunting grounds by thu
Delaware Indians. No more beautiful place can be found in
the old Western Reserve than the spot where John Brown
once lived, and it will always be kept in good shape In memory
of him.

SYNDICATE CHARTERS THE ALBION
FOR USE IN INTERISLAND TRADE
Former Alaskan Vessel Is Fitted With a Refrigerating Plarrfindls-
Expected to' Prove a Useful Craft in the Archipelagoâ Australia
Docks and Reports Being Delayed by Continuous, Heavy Gale
THE DOLLAR STEAMSHIP COMPANY'S ALBION THAT HAS BEEN CHARTERED TO GO TO THE* PHILIP
PINES. SHE IS FITTED WITH A REFRIGERATING PLANT AND WILL CARRY FROZEN MEAT FROM
MANILA TO ALL THE ISLAND PORTS.
THE well known coasting steamer
Albion is going to the Philippines,
where she will go Into the trade
between Manila, Iloilo and all the
other ports of the group. She is
well fitted for the trade, as some time ago
she was fitted with a refrigerating plant
and carried frozen meat from Puget
Sound to Nome.
The Albion was formerly engaged in the
lumber trade. Then came the Klondike
rush, and she was built up and turned
Into a passenger vessel. Later, when the
Nome fever broke out, she was fitted with
cold storage and did good service for her
owners. She has now been chartered from
the Dollar Steamship Company by a Phil
ippine syndicate and will go td Manila
via Honolulu. She will call at the latter
place for coal, and may also stop at Guam
on the way. She will not take any cargo,
but her chambers will be filled with Jlrozan
meat.
The Albion is a wooden ves/el of 337
tons burden, 120 feet long, 31 feet beam
and 9 feet deep. .She was built in 1S92 by
C. G. White for John S. Kimball. She is a
handy craft and should prove very ser
viceable in the Philippines. She will be
thoroughly overhauled before leaving here
for her new station.
Australia Reaches Port.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia, which arrived from Tahiti Sunday
night, was released from quarantine and
docked at Pacific-street wharf yesterday
mornir.g. Captain Lawless says that nev
er in his. experience did he encounter any
thing like the continuous heavy weather
the ship had to contend with all the way
home. When nearing the coast it blew a
hurricane, and m consequence the mail
boat was delayed, it taking her fourteen
days to make the run.
The Australia brought up a consider
able cargo, most of which is composed of
vanilla beans, bananas, pineapples, co
coanuts, mangoes and copra. Her pas
sengers were: D. Atwater, G. L. 'Ken
nedy, R. T. Kolph, W. B. Smith, T.
Deane, Joe Heller, Fred Muffelman and
John Ottosen. Besides these the Australia
brought up nine Chinese in transit for
Hongkong.
Among those who came home in the
cabin was W. B. Smith, who has been 10
Papeete superintending the building of a
wharf for the Oceanic Plteamship Com
pany. The new structure is 250 feet long
and is most solidly built. It will be used
by the company's steamers exclusively.
. Pays Official Visit to Protet.
Rear Admiral Glass of the Goat Island
training station paid an official visit to
the French cruiser Piotet yesterday. He
was received at the gangway by Captain
Barnaud and was shown all over the ves
sel. After a social chat that lasted nearly
a half-hour Admiral Glass took his leave.
As his launch steamed away from the
cruiser a rear admiral's salute of thirteen

AUNT ABDUCTS
YOUNG NEPHEW
Police Unable to Find
Any Trace of Miss
ing Pair.
Believe That the Boy Has
â¢ Been Taken to Wisconsin
or Michigan.
CHICAGO, Dec. >30.â The Evanston po
lice, with renewed hope of success in solv
ing one of the most mysterious abductions
or disappearance cases of recent years,
to-day issued new circulars offering a,re
ward for information . concerning the
whereabouts of Miss Florence Ely and her
13-year-old nephew, Frank Ely Rogers. A
description of Miss Ely is given but Jt is
stated that the boy is in air probability
dressed in the garb of a girl. Their non
success in obtaining valuable information
concerning the pair hitherto is attributea
to the fact that the police had been asked
to look for a woman and a boy. This new
tack In the search is due to the discovery
of the clothing worn by Miss Ely and the
boy July 13, the day they disappeared. A
dog dragged from under a depot plat
form, a bundle of clothing which the par
ents of young Rogers Identified as having
belonged to their son. A search disclosed
Miss Ely's old garments. As the boy s
collar was left with the clothes, it Is,
thought certain that Miss Ely took ad
.vantage of the lad's girlish face and hair
to dress him in skirts. It is thought that
following the change of clothing the boy
and woman took the train for Wisconsin
or Michigan and it is believed she is sup
porting both by giving instructions in mu
sic and painting. .
A reward of $500 for the apprehension
of the boy or his aunt has been standing
since last July.
SERIOUS RELIGIOUS RIOTS
ON THE ISLAND OF LEWES
Islanders Refuse to Countenance Al
liance Between Free and United
Scottish Churches.
LONDON, Dec. 30.â The Island of Lewes
has been the scene of serious religious
riots, arising from the union of the Free
and the United Churches of Scotland. The
Islanders refused to countenance the alli
ance and when the Minister at Ness
Joined the United Church they locked him
out of his church. A strong force of po
lice was sent over from the mainland to
open the doors, whereupon the islanders
congregated and. throwing volleys of
stones at the constables, drove them in
side the building and bombarded them
with rocks until they capitulated and
agreed to leave the island. Every member
of the police detachment was more or less
[seriously wounded.
r It is probable that a detachment of
troops will be sent to subdue the rioters.

COMJITICCS OF THE TRADE IN THESE
AKTKXES DURING THE PAST YEAR.

To secure a complete statement of the entire
coal consumption of California. I have been
obliged to include deliveries at Port Los An
geles :md San Diego by water, which has been
added in the above sources of supply. The to
tal amount received by water at those ports
loot ux> 240,777 tons.
Fuel Oil. â This has proved a boon to Cali
fornia, so farreaching In beneficial effects that
its future advantages cannot be estimated, and
It is questionable to-day if the discover}' of
gold will prove as potent a factor in creating a
prosperous and permanent future for us all. We
produce nearlv one million tons of varied grains
.annually and use no fertilizing products; we
export thousands of tons of nearly every fruit
grown in and out of the tropics; we handle
. injxe canned fish than any other State in the
Â«_nion; we unearth immense quantities of every
ne*-al known to commerce; â¢we have the mott
equable climate on earth, and within two years
we have become (or certainly will within two
years more) the largest oil producers in the
world, and are so geographically positioned that
we have the Oriental and colonial markets un
der our control to take our surplus refined oil.
We do not want the earth, we only want what
is on 'it and what Is in it. and the r>eople at
the aforesaid earth to consume what we will
provide for them. Is it to be wondered at that
our population Is rapidly increasing, that real
OKtate is being sought for at marked up values
ta.nd that Eastern plutocrats are seeking inveGt
ments here on every side? It Is a. conundrum
hard to solve, that the producers here of oil
have been so far the least benefited, the main
advantages have gone to the consumers. Con
tracts have been made this year at 60 cents
per barrel, with the freight paid by the vendor
of over 40 cents per barrel; at the same time
it Â»a: well known, that they were substituting:
oil at equal to $2 50 per ton for coal, which was
bfing then used at over $5 per ton. Better
prices for oil now prevail.
Coke.â The total quantity received by water
foots up 34*233 tons, as against 41,741 tons last
war. Over 5o per cent of the above has come
direct t>y sail from England, 7784 tons from
Ht-lgium and Germany, Â«Â»06 tons from British
Columbia and 1S25 tons from Australia. It is
impossible to approximate the quantity received
by rail, as the major portion of this is delivered
ctirect to Interior consumers. It should aggre
gate about 9500 to lO.OOO* tons.
Pig Iron. â The arrivals of pis iron by sail
ecgregate b478 tons. Of this amount 4753 tons
are English, Hit remainder is American. There
its an Eastern gydlcate now figuring on utiliz
ing the iron ores of Shasta. County, which may
result in giving us low-priced crude Iron
later on.
The above will demonstrate the present year
to have been exceptionally prosperous, and all
tisrifi indicate an aesured continuation for 1902.
VV e have had a seasonable rainfall to date,
;nd the grain markets of the world are quoted
with an upward tendency, which promises a
profitable outlet for our products. Our canning
industries are running full .blast with mobt
promising prosepcts, and these, combined with
1 he oil refineries now in course of construction,
>-hould infcuie us bountiful returns for the com
ing year.
The annual review of I. Steuart says:
A year of unprecedented prosperity has Just
closed, leaving the State and City of San
Kranciseo in a condition of active progression,
with every promise of the city experiencing an
eta of progress and expansion unknown in its
l>ast history, while the prospects of the StÂ»tr,
owing to increased transportation facilities,
and the active efforts now bolng made to at
tract desirable immigration, promises to add
materially in the near future to the present
spars? population, and thus putting California
on a par with other States of the Union where
tsimilar methods have been bo successfully pur
fcuod for years past.
The coal trade of the yr-ar. although so ma
terially affcrted fcy the free use of oil as fuel
throughout the city and State, compares mos'
favorably with the trade of rÂ«m years when
it is borne in mind that the estimated dis
placement of coal by fuel oil amounted during
the year to nbotiÂ« 1 "*â¢ "ty tons of coa! eoiial
to 4,000,000 barrels of oil. ' q '

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 30. â To-day's market was
largely a matter of money supplies. The
symptoms were Indubitable that these were
scarce, the call loan rate running up at one
time to 12 per cent. The general rate for re
newals was 10 per cent. There were a num
ber of other depressing factors which rein
forced tfaia motive for selling stocks, and the
co^quence was a general declining tendency
of nrices during the morning. Later In the
day the money rate became easier under of
ferings by bankers, among whom J. Pierpont
Morgan & Co. were conspicuous. A very urg
ent demand developed for Reading, which
caused an advance of 4 points in that stork
aa4nc7 h & h r^Â° rd P , rice at ea^ "top o" the
ad\ance Ihe dimensions -uf â  the trading in
the stock were such as to show that only tf"
largest interests could conduct it ThÂ» in
SffiVE? 8 ken r Â»n an the wjy^from
1000 to 10,000 shares. The eeneral rnarVot
steadied under the influenced? this move
ment, but was singularly unresponsive even in
the stocks most nearly allied in interest wi n"
Heading, with the exception of New Jersey
Central, whlca made an advance of 5% on nÂ£ h * t
trading. When Reading yielded to realizing the
general market, which had been held only
steady, cave way again suddenly and dropped
to the lowest, the industrials and Paciril"
leading. The closing was active and easy
Many rumors were circulated to account for
the strength of Reading. It was said that a.
stock readjustment was at hand. Another
report was that Pennsylvania was buyine for
control. The failure of confirmation of these
rumors caused a suspicion among professional
traders that the powerful demonstration in the
stock was designed for sentimental effect on
the ceneral market to help support jjrices In
accordance with the effort supposed to be mak
ing to that end by great banking interests
The nnrent demand for money disappointed ex
pectations aroused by the unexpected Increase
shown in banking reserves by the bank state
ment on Saturday and the large gain by the
banks Indicated by to-day's return of the Sub-
Treasury's operations, resulting from the pay
ment on Saturday for the redemption of a
block of $2,500,000 of Government bonds. To
day over half a million dollars additional was
paid out for redemutlon of Government bonds
Later in the day it was explained that pay
ments were being made for the $75,000 0(X)
of Northern Pacific convertible bonds the
proceeds of which are to be used for the re
tirement of Northern Pacific preferred stock.
It was said that one check of $34,000,000 had
passed on account of the subscriDtions It
has been claimed hitherto that this operation
would be accomplished by transfer of banking
credits and without affectine the money mar
ket. The flurry in money caused some fresh
uneasiness as to possible delay In the period
of relaxation after January 1. The reduction
in the Calumet and Hecla dividend and the
closing down of the Anaconda mine depressed
Amalgamated Copper eharply. Sugar was un
der renewed pressure and showed the lack of
recent demand from a short- interest The
assembling of the conference of Northwestern
Governors to consider measures of opposition
to the Northern Securities Company made the
â¢Pacifies weak. Union Pacific seemed to be af
fected also by Rome disappointment over the
meaKerness of details in the annual report re
garding t"he methods of financiering the North
ern Pacific settlement. Proceedings begun In
Ohio under the anti-trust law resulted in sharo
declines in Ohio soft coal roads. The contro
versy between Germany, and Venezuela had
pome effect In foreign markets, but seemed to
be Ignored here.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. 30. â Wheat had a very weak
opening. Cables were lower, much more so
than was expected in consideration of the de
cline here Saturday. The quantity of wheat
on passage was increased 232,000 bushels and
the Northwestern and primary receipts were
materially larger than a year ago. The one
redeeming feature for the bulls was the small
ness of the world's shipments to Europe. May
opened lower at 81%@80%c and at once
sold to 80%@80%c. The early â¢ selling was
heavy and everything offered at the low prices
was absorbed. When the small decrease was
reported in the visible supply and the ex
port . clearanc.es appeared of considerable pro
portions shorts began to cover in such a man
ner that it seemed apparent that the market
had been oversold. There was also some rumor
that a considerable short line was being cov
ered tor V. H. Peavey, the elevator magnate,
who died here to-day. This covering, which
began only half an hour before the close, soon
sent May to Â«2Vic. Small profit-taking brought
a slight reaction and May closed strong, %c
up, at 82 %c.
Corn played a following game with wheat
most ot the day. May closed firm, 1 /4@%c
higher, at 66%c. i
Oats were strong throughout. May closed
firm. %c up. at 45 %c.
Provisions opened nrm on light receipts and
better prices at the yards. The early grain
weakness influenced some profit-taking, but on
the late strength in cereals provisions advanced
again. May pork closed 22%c up; lard, 12%c
higher, and ribs 10c higher.

had not heard the proceedings at the In
quest and proceeded to tell them about
it, and about how the mob came and took
the prisoners. He told them how the af
fair occurred and how he fired shots from
his revolver at the time.
Avers said that Brown told him that
Frank Hall fought the men who wore
trying to take him from the hotel. The
witness stated that in this conversation
Brown said that it was general talk in
Lookout that "these men ought to either
be pent to prison or hung." He had
smoked his cigar on the porch, and the
mob came in and came sooner than he
thought they would. This is considered
the strongest testimony against Brown
since the trial commenced.
The next witness examined was Charles
M. Lambeth. He stated that he was in
Lookout during the time that the in

He heard Brown say it had been general
talk in Lookout that "these men would
be hung but that the lynchc.-s came be

JUDGE DECLARES
BONDS ARE VALID
Important Decision Ren
dered by Circuit
Judge Ross.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. SO.-Judge Ross
of the Federal Circuit Court to-day ren
dered a decision in the case of William
B. Brown versus John H; Drain as Street
Superintendent of the city of Los An
geles, for an injunction, and for declar
ing void the issue of street improvement
bonds Issued under tne Vrooman act, for
the improvement of Stanley avenue. The
decision is in favor of the defendant and
the bonds are held to be valid.
The case involves several points that
are vital in every city in California. The
principal point brought out the fact that
the Councils in cities affected by the
Vrooman law have the right to modify
street assessments previous to the Issu
ance of warrants for the contractor's re
muneration, and also within thirty days
after the event.
Judge Ross decided that the Vrooman
act superseded the city charter, and that
according to the constitution of th<Â» State
of California at the time of the adoption
of the city charter no charter provision
was valid if in conflict with a Stite law
operative at the time of the ado/tlon of
such charter. This point hau been! passed
upon previously in the same wajf by the
Supreme Court of California. /
Judge Ross in his decision said/that the
Supreme Court's decision In thd case of
Norwood vs. Baker did not involve the
merits of the front-foot assessment and
that that point was not well taken. He
said also that he Vrooman act/could not
be attacked on the ground of alleged dis
proportion of â¢â  assessments, op on the
ground that the matter of benefits was
not considered in relation to /he amount
of the assessments, or that tpe property
owners had not been given sufficient op
portunity to file objections /to the pro
posed improvement or to the apportion
ment of the assessments. -
The vital point of the ' decision, that
renders it far reaching lu Ha effects is
that under the Vrooman t.ct ample op
portunity is given the property owners to
make whatever objection they feel to be
just against the assessments- and that If
such objection is not mare, to tho Coun
cil in the regular way vithin the time
LEAVES ESTATE
TO HIS FAMILY
John J. Valentine Devises
Bulk of Property to
His Widow.
Creates a Trust Designed to
Protect Interests of the
Children.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 30.
Under the terms of the will of the late
John J. Valentine, president of. Wells,
Fargo & Co., which was filed to-day for
probate, the bulk of the estate is divided
among the Immediate members of the de
ceased's family. Of the $400,000 which is
said to compose the estate $110,000 goes to
the widow and the remainder, with the
exception or some small bequests, is dis
tributed among the seven children.
The will was filed by the Union Trust
Company of San Francisco, which, besides
being named as the executor of the will,
Is also the trustee for all of the children
until the youngest of them attains his
majority. The testament was executed on
August 24 of this year, when the deceased
first realized his critical condition and
bears the signatures of Nathan fateln of
1045 Santa Clara avenue, Alameda. and
C. H. Gardner of 1379 Nineteenth street,
East Oakland. ,: ,,
The proviso of the will regarding the
widow, Alice M. B. Valentine, directs that
Bhe shall receive $65,000 and the family
home in East Oakland, known as Cedar
Croft, which, including all the personal
effects and furnishings, is valued at $45,
000. Should the deceased have died by
accident his executors were charged to
increase the bequest to the widow by $20,
000 that amount to come from the pro
ceeds of an accident insurance policy.
To Samantha J. Valentine, a sister, is
left $3000. and to a niece, Frances V. Nor
vell $3000. The deceased omits to provide
for ' his sisters, Mary Emily Campbell.
Susan Ann Thomas, Curd Matlock and
Sarah J. Morrill, not because of any over
sight or want of brotherly affection or
solicitude, he says, but because they
have been amply provided for. He omits
his brother, James Thurman Valentine,
for the same reason.
All the rest of the estate, including the
life insurance, which the testator wishes
cared for to the best of advantage, is ap
portioned among the seven children as
Â°Edwa'rd Cahlll Valentine. $25,000; Ethel
Stein Valentine, $40,000; John Joseph Val
entine Jr., $25,000; William George Valen
tine. $25,000; Elizabeth Ruth Valentine,
$40 000- Dudley Blanchard Valentine,
$"5,000, and Phillip C. Valentine, $35,000.
The residue of the estate, which will
amount to about $20,000, will be divided
proportionately among the children.
These bequests are to be held in trust
by the Union Trust Company until the
voungest child is of age. In regard to
Edward Cahlll Valentine, Ethel Stein
Valentine. John Joseph Valentine Jr. and
William George Valentine, the proceeds
of three insurance policies, made payable
to their mother, aggregating $27,000, are to
revert to them in equal shares in case of
her death and are to become a part of
the trust funds in their behalf. Should
any of them decline to accept this provfso
the amount coming to each who does de
cline is to be deducted from the amount
of his or her bequest and interest in the
trust funds.
The income from the whole trust funds
is to be paid quarterly or semi-quarterly
to each beneficiary in the proportion in

WOMEN APPLAUD MEN
AT RABBIT SLAUGHTER
Exciting Bound-Up of Thousands of
the Animals on a Sagebrush
Prairie.
PENDLETON, Or., Dec. 30.â Three
thousand five hundred jack rabbits were
killed in an immense slaughter pen in the
Butter Creek country, thirty-three miles
west of here, Sunday. It was the great
est drive in the history of this section.
Eight hundred men and boys participated
in the massacre, cheered on by many
women.
An immense corral of wire netting had
been built on the sagebrush prairie, with
arms extending a quarter of a mile on
each side. In the center was a circular
pen 100 feet in diameter and ten feet high.
Two special trains brought clubbers from
Pendleton and Heppner, while from small
er towns the drivers came on foot and in
wagons. The drivers were lined up and
In a line two miles long, brandishing
clubs, they started toward the corral, the
rabbits being driven from cover at every
step until the corral was full to over
flowing. '
Then began the slaughter. Excited by
the scene men grew reckless and struck
right and left until maimed and dead
were piled up on all sides, the wounded
moaning in misery until some more hu
mane person returned to finish the work.
Six hundred were taken alive and the
balance were piled In five great heaps.
