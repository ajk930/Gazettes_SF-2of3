New York.
Crossed Continent Leaves
r NEW YORK, July 8.â Probably the larg
est railroad tourist excursion that ever
crossed the continent started this morn-
Ing from the Jersey City terminal of tho
Pennsylvania railroad. The excursionists
consisted of men and women bound for
San Francisco to attend the annual con
vention of the Epworth League, which
Is to be held in that city. So large was
the crowd that It was necessary to run
the train in four sections. '
The sections of the train were made up
of eight cars each, Including vestibuled
sleeping cars, dining cars and observation
cars. The.four trains had comfortable ac
commodation for 4CO passengers and the
number of passengers booked showed that
there would be no vacant places in either
section by the time the western boundary
of Pennsylvania was reached.
Each train was under the charge of a
tourist agent who will personally direct
its movements and look after the comfort
of the passengers, and of a chaperon, who
will devote her time to the women of the
party. Meals will be served regularly on
the trams and stcss will be made alons
the route at the various points of e cento
or historical Interest. The return trip
will be made through the wild mountain
scenery of the Canadian Northwest,

Subscriptions Coining In Slowly\
W. de L, Kingsbury, who has charge of
the collection. of funds to defray the ex
penses of the convention, says that sub
scriptions are not ' coming in- as rapidly
as would seem necessary in view of tho
fact: that nearly half of the desired
amount must be , forthcoming within a
week, The Epworth League officials feel
that the people of the city should respond
to the call more readily-, for there proba

PITTSBURG, July S.â "That -which

Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, when the

Eventful Day for Labor.
It was at the end of one of the most
eventful days 1n the history of organized

by President Shaffer in the Wellsville
case.
The conference to-day 'asted for almost
tvro hours, but what was sa!d or done
was not given out save through the state
ment made by President Shaffer. It was j
evidently decided that the best interests j
of both sides demanded that the wage i
conference be held at as early a date as
possible, in spite of the trouble at Wells

statement of Vice President Chapell re

MANILA, July 8.â The United : States
Philippine Commission has ordered H. P.
Whitmarsh, the Governor of Henguet
province, to come to Manila and submit
to an investigation, owing to the allega
tion that he has been using his position
to his personal advantage in acquiring
land and mining rights from the natives.
He is at present charged with violation
of Instructions. The commission particu
larly instructed Governor Whitmarsh to
cultivate the , friendship and protect the
interests of the Igorrotes, who suffered
from Spanish extortions and exploitations.
Colonel Du Val of '. the Forty-eighth
Regiment, who formerly occupied the
provinces of Union and Henguet, and Dr.
Kieffer, the regimental surgeon, who was"
prominent in the civil administration/ of
the province, complained of Governor
Whitmarsh's methods of administering
his office.
The commission is inclined to attribute
the feeling existing to military opposition
to civilian authority in Henguet. Volun
tary statements made by natives to Com
missioner Worcester, while .on a visit to
Henguet, formed the basis of the investi
gation. General Bell has forwarded sim
ilar allegations to Manila. â¢
Two friars, who were invited to Cal
astao, province of ' Pangasinan, to cele
brate a holiday, were mobbed. A native
priest denounced the action of the people,
whereupon they attacked the priest.
.: The friars fled. The native papers have
since renewed their attacks upon the
friars.
Generals^ Chaff ee and Wade were' at
Batangas. The removal of the military
headquarters, in Southern Luzon from
Manila to Llpa, in Batangas province, is
contemplated.
Pardo de .Tavera, .who has been an
nounced as, a future member of the Civil
Commission;- and General Cailles, the-in
surgent leader, who recently surrendered
in ' Laguna province, are going to that
province to-morrow in order to organize

DENVER, July 8.â The action of the
President in proclaiming the opening for
settlement of the reservation lands In
Oklahoma on August 6 is causing great
uneasiness to the cattlemen. It is said
that there are 200,000 head of cattle on
ranges that have been leased by Texas
and Oklahoma stockmen. These cattle are
immature and unfit for the market at the
present time. If the order is carried out
these cattle will have to be shipped im
mediately and sold for canning in the
Eastern markets for what they will bring.
The loss under ' such conditions '< would
amount to hundreds of thousands of dol
lars.
It la said that a delay of ninety or even
sixty days would enable the owners to
put the cattle on the market in proper
condition. To secure such a delay, if
possible, the following telegram was sent
to Secretary Hitchcock Saturday night:
Hon E- A. i Hitchcock, Secretary of the In
terior Washington, D. C: Livestock Interest
In the West and Southwest will be seriously
affected unless the proclamation opening the
Kk>wa and Comanche reservations can be de
layed until the herds of immature cattle can
be shipped to the market. On behalf of the
livestock Industry, I respectfully petition for
such delay. _. JOHN W. SPRINGER,
President National Livestock" Association.
The telegram evidently arrived too late
to have any effect, but every pressure
will be brought to bear on Secretary
Hitchcock to prevent losses to the stock
men. â¢ 'Â¦ . â¢ â¢ ' '

to Delay Opening of

Wthe post of Embassador to Italy
in succession to George V. L. Mey

his strength in the White House to polit
ical influence alone, but to the warm

known for his connection with the So
ciety for Savings, of which he has been
piesident since 1894, and which has de-
posits aggregating upward of $35,000,000.
The prospective Embassador was * edu

In ISio he came to Cleveland with the in
tention of reading law, and three years
thereafter he was- admitted to the bar.
In 1S8G Mr. Herrick launched himself up

five hundred pounds sterling for the first

The suggestion that Hawaii be annexed
to California has raised quite a row here.
The idea meets with much opposition,
though the Senate refused to pass the.

There are over 250 other Chinese, who

certificates, and all will be promptly de
ported when they come here. It is stated
that the Treasury DeDartment takes the
position that the Chinese in question
should have registered before they left
here for China. \ â¢
It. is* thought that the sum of $235,000,
now in possession of the Government as
deposits made by Chinese immigrants un
der the old government, the deposits be
made as guarantees by immigrants that
they would comply with the conditions
under which they were brought here, and
return to China in due time, may be used
for the expenses of the Territory.
Attorney General Dole has rendered an
opinion to the effect that the Territory
has the right to make use of the funds

Five Chinese immigrants who arrived
recently on the British steamship Strath
gyleN^nd who had been denied a landing
by Curtoms Collector Stratton, escaped
from the vessel last Sunday night.
Customs Inspector Everett was on
â¢watch at the gangplank and does not
know how the Mongolians got away. They
did not come down the gangplank, but
slipped over the side of the vessel Into a
err.all boat. Inspector O'Reilley was walk
ing down Brannan street at 11 o'clock in
the evening, going to the dock to report
for duty. On tho way he encountered a
Chinaman coming from the dock, who
seemed anxious to avoid observation.
O'Reilley collared him at once on suspi
cion and the suspect was identified later
as one of the five who had escaped from
the Strathgyle.
In the opinion of the United States Dis
trict Attorney's office, Weong Woon Ho
is the prettiest Chinese woman that has
ever been ordered deported. She had been
leading the life of a slave and became
tired of it. Besides her owner wanted to
take her back to China, and he devised
a way whereby her passage would be paid
by the United States Government. So he
caused the woman to send a message to
Chinese Inspector Gardiner that she re
pented of her mode of living and wished
to place herself in the care of one of the
Christian missions in China. Inspector
Gardiner was prudent and had Interpre
ter Da Silva take "Weong*s statement,
which was that she had been admitted
to this country on the prejudiced testi
mony of witnesses who swore that she
was a native of California.
She was brought before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock yesterday
morning aad meekly told her story. There
was nothing left for the Commissioner
but to order her deported.

Neumann died early this morn

of paralysis (of the brain. Both
in Hawaii and on the mainland

his death was sent to Embassador White

health during the day and had attended
to matters of business of the management
of the White estate. He was alone in the

SEATTLE, July 8.â The preliminary
hearing -of John W. and Thomas Consi
dine, charged with .the murder of ex-
Chief of Police TV. L. Meredith, was be
gun to-day. From the evidence intro
duced it is evident the State will try to
prove at' the trial that some one not yet
named began the fatal affray by firing- a
pistol shot at Meredith in the street be
fore Meredith fired upon John Considine
with his double-barreled shotgun. The
sixth-shot theory is a new one. Hereto
fore it has been agreed by all the wit
nesses that but four shots were fired and
all these inside the drug store where
Meredith was killed.
None of the witnesses who testified to
day to having heard a pistol shot before
Meredith began shooting was near the
scene of the killing, and none saw any
one shoot. All were more than the width
of the street from the drug store. The
eyewitnesses of the whole affray, of
whom two testified to-day,' have so far
mentioned no shooting before Meredith
opented flre, and Meredith has heretofore
been \ regarded as indisputably the ag
gressor. The testimony of the witnesses
was conflicting, some saying the first re
port was faint, and some that it was very
loud."
The hearing will not be finished before
to-morrow night, and it Is attracting a
great deal of public interest. Justice

Morales has a bad reputation. He is a
brother of Jose Morales, the desperado
who shot and killed I>eputy Sheriff "Wil

escaped. William Morales has been mixed
in several ugly scrapes, but has always
managed to escape the clutches of the
law. Huges, the injured man, was for
merly a conductor on a railroad in Ari
zona, and was later a deputy constable
in Los Angeles. He had been out to El
Monte and. returning home, lay down by
the roadside and went to sleep. While
sleeping he was attacked by Morales and
before becoming aroused was so weak
from the injuries inflicted by the Mexi
can that he could not defend himself.

levied, and they would have done so had
they not been prevented."

been distributed to the depositors. Late
this afternoon Attorney Welch for the
depositors filed a sweeping suit in equity,
which involved 310 persons of this county
as defendants and which outlines the
present condition of the bank and prays
the court to grant a decree that will im
mediately compel the stockholders to pay
the limit of their statutory liability and
the directors of the bank to close its af
fairs within a given time. In the event
of their failure it is asked that a commis
sioner be appointed by the court to act.

While the strikers claim that it is not
a vita! matter, they admit that the situ

be waiting for occupation the
handsomest fraternity house
to be found on the campus of
ejl v "Western college. This new residence,
palatial in its appointments, will be the
home of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fra
icniity boys. Both in plan and in con
struction the uppermost idea has been to
make the house one suitable for enter
tcluing. The whole scheme of the first
f.oor suggests receptions, balls and in
formal hops. The Immense reception hall,
23 by 42 feet long, with the billiard-room
OH the right and dining-room on the left.
both 17 by 25 feet, when thrown into one,
â¢will form one grand ball room 76
feet in length and will easily accommo
date seventy-five couples. On the. sec
ond floor are twelve sleeping rooms, each
provided with Individual toilet apart
ments. In all, the house will provide a
home for twenty-four men.
The interior finish on the first floor is
all to be In the natural redwood, with
hardwood floors, f he architecture of the
house ie of the old colonial style, with
broad veranda and large pillars in front.
Newton J. Thorp of San Francisco is the
architect. The contract price of the house
is $11,000, and the furnishings will cost
52000 more.

SANTA ANA # July S.â One of the most
important real estate transactions in
Orange County since the boom days has
been closed. Colonel R. J. Northam has
sold his splendid Mesa ranch at Bolsa
Chico, consisting- of 1600 acres, to the
Western Coast Land and Water Company
for a consideration of $100,000. The prop
erty has a beach frontage of three miles,
and one of the first steps of the present
owners will be to lay out a townsite for a
pleasure resort on the Smeltzer branch of
the Southern Pacific.
.Nearly every foot of the big ranch ts
under plow, and among- its many improve
ments is a $14,000 pumping plant, which
supplies sufficient water to â¢ irrigate 300
acres, and there is an abundance of water
as yet undeveloped. ,
Under the contract a cash payment of
$10,000 is required, which has already been
made, the balance to be paid $5000 , each
year, witlvlnterest at 4 per cent. The un
usual condition is that . if Colonel Nor
tham's death should occur at any time
prior to the completion of the payment of
$100,000, the sum then paid shall be deemed
full settlement for the ranch, and a clear
deed passed accordingly. In other words,
If Colonel Northam should die within the
present year the purchasing corporation
would secure the -rUBen for $10,000; next
year, for $15,000, and so on. But as the
colonel now appears there seems little
doubt of his living the entire eighteen
years required for him to receive the full
$100,000. '
The company, is capitalized at $200,000, all
of which is subscribed.- __,Â¦

curred on May 38. i ,
Professor Dyson said last evening that
the eclipse was perfect, but he was afraid
that none of the photographic exposures
secured by his narty were good, owintr to
the cloudy weather prevailng at the time.
He * s t id a e /^rfcan professors who

STBANGLES HEESELF TO
DEATH IN HER CEXL
TO .the many good plays in her rep
ertoire Miss Florence Roberts has
now added the delightful old com
edy of manners, "The School for
Scandal," given last night at the
Alcazar Theater. That the Sheridan play
etill has ample power to charm was fully
evinced last night in. the delighted appre
ciation that greeted every quaint quip
and witty humor of the old-time comedy.
Amazingly new it all sounds, its well su
gared pill as modern a necessity as that
of the day of its compounding.
The play will go better in a few nights
than it did last night. The waits were
long, the action lagged and at twenty-five
minutes after 11 o'clock, when I left the
theater, there was still an act to come.
It speaks well indeed for the interest of
the performance that almost all of the
audience was still waiting for that last
act when I left. Like all of Miss Rob
erts' plays, "The School for Scandal" Is
staged astonishingly well, costumed fit
tingly and carefully thought out. It is
as well cast as the resources of the com
pany allow, and a very creditable per
formance is given. Miss Roberts, of
course, does the bewitching Lady Teazle,
and adds another intelligent conception to
her repertoire. She looks and acts the
part with much grace and wears two or
three "monstrous fine gowns," to speak in
the fashion of the period.
Barton Hill, In addition to the manage
ment of the comedy, assumes the* role of
Sir Peter Teazle, and gives a pleasing and
careful study of the role. White Whit
tlesey is a very efficient Charles Surface,
with an excellent foil in Lucius Hender
eon as his hypocritical brother. He does
good work throughout as the fascinating
spendthrift, and, George Webster Is a suf
ficient Oliver Surface.
Of the smaller parts, Marie Howe is ad
mirable as Mrs. Candor, Agnes Ranken
a not particularly convincing Maria and
Lillian Armsby Is sufficient as Lady
Sneerwell. Edwin Emery as Careless
needs suppressing somewhat; there is too
much of him for the size of the part.
But the play Is on the whole worthily
given and it is a privilege to see so worthy
a play thu8 given at the price.
Columbia.
Charles Frohman's great stage specta
cle, "Under Two Flags," with Blanche
Bates . as Cigarette, Is now in Its third
week at the Columbia Theater, and indi
cations point to a continuance of the
present big business. The thrilling ro
mance is superbly presented and in the
Â¦wonderful sandstorm scene a triumph of
realism is achieved. Miss Bates continues
to impress all as one of the few actresses
on the American stage capable of por
traying the passion of Ouida's fervid he
roine, anil at ' every â¢ performance she is
obliged to respond to the recalls of the
enthusiastic audience.
Grand Opera-House.
There were flowers galore for beautiful
Mary Van Burcn and- plenty of applause
for T. Daniel Frawley at the Grand
Opera-house last evening, besides an en
thusiastic audience that showed its ap
proval for Gillette's great play) "Secret
Service " Â¦ Â¦ -
"Secret Service" Is not a perfect fit for
the Frawley people, but it is a tremen
dous big play .that might survive even
bad acting. Frawley, of course, is .not
Gillette in hia interpretation of Captain
Thorne, but nevertheless, his version of
the role is an intelligent and convincing
one. Mary Van Buren made a very prutty
Edith Varney, Christine Hill as. Martha,
one of the negro servants of the Varney
home, has only one scene,' but she made
that scene tell. Pearl Landers was hard
ly equal to the requirements of her role.
First and foremost of all the cast in
point of strong acting is Morgan. As
Benton Arrelford hennas a part that fits'
his clenched-teeth style of .delivery, and
though all through the play he has the
audience against' him, he still managed to
make -his role the star one of the play
"Secret Service" is splendidly staged and
should draw well during its one week run.
Central.
Gillette's '.'Held by the Enemy," as. pre
sented this week at the. Central Theater,
is an example of a good play; mounted,
scened and costumed. as it should be. One
of the most startling of the realistic ef
fects Is the bombardment in the third act,
when a. shell bursts blazing through the
wall of the division- headquarters, Tho
wall catches fire andthe effect is so start
ling and so real that most of the audience
believe that it is a real fire In the theater.
The play is well constructed within th?
lines of probability and is alive with,ac
tion. The thunder of the cannonade is
real and the clattering of the horses'
hoofs is surprisingly well simulated.
Last night the gallery was enthusiastic.
It rose to its many noisy feetand whistled
and yelled for Juliet Crosby and James
M. Brophy at the end of each act, and
when the curtain fell on the third act
the two were called before the curtain,
where Miss-Crosby was' loaded down with
roses, and a speech from Mr. Brophy was"
insisted upon. : -
The principals had good support from
Georgie Cooper as Susan McGreery, Mar-'
garet Marshall as Euphremia, George
Hernandez as Uncle Kufus, Wil'ard
Blackmore as Lieutenant Godenhayne,
Stanley Ross as the newspaper corre
spondent and James Corrigan as the brig
adier surgeon. The picturesque drama
without a villian is played up to the han
dle and is one of the most brilliant .suc
cesses of the year.
Tivoli. :
"Tfie Babes in the Wood" has caught
on at the Tivoli Opera-house, which was
crowded last night with a delighted and
appreciative audience. The extravaganza
is full of fun and the topical songs last
night were encored again and again. Fer
ris Hartman and Harry Cashman as the
two tramps, Edward Webb and Annie
Myers as the babes, Maud Williams as the
teacher, Arthur Cunningham as the fair.
ily physician, Alf C- Wheelan and Ber
j:ice Holmes as Sir Rowland and Lady
Macasser are all admirably suited to the
humor of their parts. Cunningham's
song, "The Will-o'-the-Wisp," was
splendidly rendered. The beautiful trans
formation scene Is a fitting climax to the
successful piece. . . .
Orpheum.
Gilbert and Goldle, who are again at
the Orpheum after a year's absence, were
given a most hearty reception last even
ing and bid, fair to be. the hit of the sea
son. Emily Lytton and Charles Bowser
put on a new sketch called "Next," and
scored a genuine success in the skit. It
possesses- more' than the average of lit
erary merit for anything seen on the
vaudeville stage, and Miss Lytton makes
the most of her lines. Â¦ . Y y :
Marie Stuart and Clayton White pro
voked much hilarity "In the playette "Ger
aldine," while Irving Jones, the colored
monologlst. gave some, new gags and
songs. The holdovers are La Moyne
brothers, Blram, Bomm and Brrr;-tho

At Fischer's Concert House Pletro Buzzt

solos from Italian grand operas were v/ell
rendered. Alice- "Wren and' Charles Lun

and Charity Martin and Signor Q. S. Wan
rell in their solos and duets received en
core after encore. Al Hazard, ventrilo
quist; Black and Wllcox, banjo . duetlste,
and the.Kelcey sisters, dancing and sing
ing' soubrettes, completed- an .excellent
programme. , ; - \
Chutes.
The Chutes' has an excellent bill this
week, Richards, the cartoonist,' scored a
hit with his clever work, Flatt and Suth

Spenser Kelly, the barytone, continues a
great favorite. Other numbers are the

Herreshoff s New Boat Is a
Marvel in Speed and Â«
NEWPORT. B. I.. July Â«.â If the vic
tory of the Constitution over the Columbia
and the Independence in the first of the
three-cornered races Saturday was sig
nificant and definite, her Â¦winning- to-day
may be characterized as overwhelming,
and the defeat of the Independence as
positive and almost hopeless. The ap
proach of evening again found the com
mittee anchored far out in JCarragansett
Bay. along with the catboat which marked
the other end of the finish line, tediously
waiting for the Boston boat to cross,
while her rivals were well up the harbor
on the way to their moorings. â¢
The new Herreshoff boat had beaten the
Columbia by nearly a half-hour over the
thirty-mile course, while the record
against the Independence was more than
tin hour. The Constitution came near
traveling around the triangle while the
Crowninshield creation was covering two
legs of it. To-day's race establishes the
JCÂ«?w BrUtol sloop as a record breaker in
light airs. She has accomplished what
yachtsmen considered impossible in thus
beating the Columbia, while her perform
ance has put the Independence out of the
running in conditions like those ot to-day.
What her show would be in heavy weath
er is still a matter of conjecture, as it is
with the Independence, but the experts are
now almost ready to accept any achieve
ment of the Constitution without surprise.
Of all the contests in the history of
the renowned races for the America's cup
that of to-day is the most remarkable,
not only of the races proper, but also ot"
those incident to the selection â¢ of a cup
challenger or a cup defender. The Consti
tution has proved herself the best light
weather craft ot this generation.
The wind was light irora. the southwest
at the start, and there was a long and
greasy ground swell from the southwest
when the start was made from a point
five miles east-southeast of Brentons Reef
lightship. The first leg of the. triangular
bourse of thirty nautical miles was a dead
beat to windward of ten miles, the course
being southwest. The start of the Consti
tution was notable. She did not seem to
want to take the windward position, but
b^ing- in a hurry lo cross started from
pretty nearly the leeward end of the line
and luffed up to cross just as the gun
sounded. This would have been the cause
of a berth further to leeward.-. But a lit
tle while after the Columbia and the Inde
pendence had crossed the Constitution
showed her haughty disregard of the pair
of them by proceeding on the starboard
tack, with her topsail defiantly shaking
its luff at Â¦ everything afloat, then going
about and crossing tne bows of her op
ponents, and when satisfied with the lead
the had obtained tacking and occupying
a. commanding t^rth to the windward ana
a lead which she maintained to the end of
the race.
There was a baze and dampness and an
unprepossessing outlook generally, but the
Constitution overcame every obstacle that ,
offered in the way of flukes and doldrums,
and, sailed witli tact and skill, won out at
the first mark by 10 minutes 37 seconds
over the Columbia.
Of the next leg, a reach of ten miles, !
with only a gentle zephyr blowing on the '
s tarbeard beam, with a fine reaching jib
topsail set to whatever airs might come
her war, she sailed faster 'than the wind, i
and by rare skill and superior ability
worked herself through what seemed an Â¦
almost inextricable tangle of hu.midity '
and, haze, ground swell and dead calms to (
another extraordinary achievement. She
rounded the leeward mark tight minutes
and forty-two seconds ahead of the Co
lumbia, and then, scurrying faster than
the wind, which never during the racing
to-day exceeded the force of a six-knot
air, ehe made the crowning- record of her
history by sailing over the ten knots in
forty-nine minutes and forty-six seconds. I
In writing of the brilliant work on the I
Columbia mention should be made of the j
valiant efforts the old ship made to es
cape from the hoodoo of greater merit on
the part of the Constitution. The brave
and determined efforts of E. D. Morgan, I
the plucky amateur; Barr, the able skip- I
per, and a crew never to be surpassed,
who kept up the great fight to the finish
and in . the smart handling of the sails
never lost a point, were all recognized by
appreciative spectators. She was out
classed.
The Independence was not handicapped
by her personnel, but simply by her in
ability to sail fast under conditions that
prevailed. She made a fairly good start
and experienced no purely bad luck. In
fact, in the reax:h to the second mark she
had the greatest bit of luck in her life, as
she made faster time over the leg by two
minutes and twenty-five seconds than the
Columbia.
That is the only satisfactory episode
connected with the rare of the Indepen
dence. In two trials in light weather she
has not proved to be anywhere near her
rivals. The statistical story of the con
test follows:
Elapsed Correct
Start Finish. Time.. Time.
Constitution ..11:55:26 4:54:30 4:59:04 4:59:04
Columbia 11:56:07 5:24:36 5:28:29 5:27:11
Independence .11:56:22 6:14:40 6:18:18 6:17:55
Thus the Constitution wins, beating the
Columbia twenty-eight minutes and eight
seconds, corrected time, ar.d the Indepen
dence one hour eighteen minutes and thir
ty-one seconds, corrected time.
On the beat to the first mark the elapsed
times of the three were: Constitution
2:20:25, Columbia 2;31:02, Independence
2:5S:4S. â¢ .
The Constitution on the Â¦ first ten-mile
leg of the thirty-mile course beat the Co
lumbia ten minutes thirtv-one seconds
and the Independence thirty-nine minutes
twenty-three seconds. On the reach to the
Fecond mark the elapsed times were: Con
stitution 1:4833. Columbia 1:57:35, Inde
pendence 1:55:10.
The Constitution beat the Columbia
eight minutes and forty-two seconds and
the Independence six minutes and seven
teen seconds. The Independence beat the
Columbia on this leg two minutes and
twenty-five seconds, owing to getting- a
slant of wind while the Columbia was be
calmed seven or eight miles ahead.
On the reach home the elapsed time of
the Constitution was forty-nine minutes
lorty-six seconds, while that of the Co
lumbia was fifty-nine minutes fifty-two
seconds. The Constitution thus beat the
rival Columbia ten minutes and six sec
onds. Although there. is no official time
* ,, the r " undln^ of the lee mark by the
Independence, she was beaten nearly an
hour on the lee.
As a matter of fact. Just four minutes
end thirty seconds before the Constitution
finished the Independence was dimly dis
cerned rounding the lee mark, nine miles
estern of the winner.

Supreme Court Issues Writ
Staying Contempt Pro
ceedings.
The Supreme Court issued a writ of pro
hibition yesterday ordering a stay in the
contempt proceedings instituted by Su
perior Judge J. "W. Harrington of Modoc
County against J. E. Raker and G. F.
Harris, attorneys for the Lookout lynch
ins suspects.
Raker and Harris petitioned Judge Har
rington for a wflt of habeas corpus for A.
C. Colburn. an important witness for the
State. The petition was summarily de
nied, and on the ground that the docu
ment was disrespectful in its tone the at
torneys were adjudged guilty of contempt
and sentenced to pay a fine of JCOO or go
to Jail for a period of five days. -
Harris has already spent three days in
confinement, but Raker left town, ana al
though a bench warrant was issued for
his arrest he arrived safely in San Fran
cisco and presented hia petition to the
Supreme Court. He alleged that his peti
tion to Judge Harrington contained noth
ing disrespectful or unnecessary in a
proper presentation of the case.
The Supreme Court directed that Harris
be immediately released and that no fur
ther action be taken in the matter until
August o, when all three of the parties
concerned are ordered to appear before
the court in bank. -
Attorney Raker is confident that Judge
Harrington cannot sustain his action and
that the decision of the Supreme Court
practically amounts to a dismissal of the
case. '
A petition for a writ of habeas corpus
for A. C. Colburn will be filed with the
Supreme Court to-day. Mr. Raker states
that the three lynching suspects who are
now held without bail are men of estima
ble character and have the sympathy and
support of the community. He states that
there is little evidence against them and
that there is no question that they will be
acquitted.

MODOC LAWYERS
ARE SUCCESSFUL
The Mayor transmitted to the Board of
Supervisors yesterday a copy of the letter
received from Andrew Carnegie, offering
the city of San Francisco $750,000 for the
erection of a. central library and branch
libraries. In his letter the Mayor says:
The thanks of our city are due to our gen
erous benefactor. The Board of Supervisors
has the power to acquire land and transfer real
estate belonging to the city from one depart
ment to another >. and also to authorize tne
erection of library buildings by the Library
Trustees. The last named will probably com
municate with you on, the subject.
The letter of Mr. Carnegie was ordered
spread on the minutes and will be incor
porated, in the municipal reports. It was
also referred to the Educational Commit
tee with instructions to prepare a resolu
tion thanking the donor for his munificent
offer. The" Mayor also cabled a reply of
thanks to Carnegie.
The property owners in the neighbor
hood of the park originally known as Mis
sion Plaza and bounded by Mission, West
Mission, Twelfth and Thirteenth streets
petitioned the board to Institute condem
nation proceedings and take necessary
steps to have the property improved as a
city park. The petition was referred to the
Judiciary Committee. . Â¦
Reed's resolution that the $208,500 levied
as taxes in the last budget to meet the
principal and interest of park and other
bonds, since declared illegal, be exclusive
ly used for the building of new school
houses. Improvement of the City Hospital
and the reconstruction^ of sewers was in
definitely postponed.
The resolution favoring an increase to
$2 50 a day in the pay of city janitors was
indefinitely postponed, as provision for the
Increase ' has already- been made in the
budget. - ' ' '
The petition of San Francisco Lodge No.
68, International Association of Machin
ists, to hold a friendly boxing exhibition
at Glen Park on July 14 was granted.
The petition of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club to hold an amateur boxing ex
hition on July 18 was referred to the Po
lice Committee.
â¢ Maria Sjoholm' was granted permission
to add a fireproof room on top of her
building at Powell and Sutter streets. Wil
son objected and claimed that the ordi
nance was violated in that the building
exceeds flfty-five feet in height. Curtis
stated that the building was already fin
ished with the authority of the Board of
Public Works.
The board adjourned to meet on "Wednes

TO ARRIVE.
"There are three things we should do.
Beware of the evil of overproduction, of
too high prices, which make these Eastern
wines possible, and lastly, we must secure
this much-needed national protection. If
we do not accomplish these things we will
finally find ourselves driven to the export
trade of the Pacific for a market and then
we cannot tell how soon these Eastern
brick vineyard wines will enter the field
and run us out. Most certainly there will
be steps taken promptly toward obtaining
the legislation suggested." . â¢
"Where is the remedy? There is only
one, if any, and that is a national pure
wine law. There is no use to try to secure
the -passage of a pure food bill, for the
Eastern packers and manufacturing gro
cers would fight and defeat the measure.
The wine law is what we want, and it
must provide that the Internal Revenue
Department shall enforce it as rigidly as
those laws governing the production and
sale of whisky. Such a law would be our
salvation, but when we undertake to pass
it In the next Congress we will doubtless
find ourselves opposed by the powerful
Ohio delegation because of the fact that
the Buckeye State is the greatest pro
ducer of these awful concoctions - with
which they are poisoning the public stom
ach.
Where Is the Remedy?
"You see, we aTe handicapped by the
fact that the greater proportion of Cali
fornia wines snipped to tne East is con
sumed by Italians and the lower classes
otztrtencn, and one dealer said that these
people had stomachs that would not be
leazed by any adulteration of wine. 'All
they want,' said he, 'is wineâ red wineâ
and as long as it is red, heavy enough and
cheap they are satisfied.' This is where
our grave trouble lies, and this condition
we must successfully correct or be prac
tically driven out of the Eastern markets
for bulk wines.
"These dealers in the East are going
into the business extensively. 1 know or
one house that is putting in a million gal
lons of new cooperage on the lake shore
in Ohio in which to keep this brick vine
yard wine moving. Missouri is also in the
field and coming to the fore fast. As an
illustration, I found these wines as far
west as Denver, some places in carload
lots, and they are well distributed. Of
course they will be mixed with California
wines and sold for the wines pf thisState.
Any Wine That Is Red.
'"I found very serious conditions menac
ing our wines," said Mr. Rossi, '"and they
grow out of the fact that our products
nave reached a selling price where it pays
to start up the "brick vineyards' of New
\ork, Ohio and Missouri. Tne vintage in
these vmeyaras lasts an the year round,
and where we have to seil our wines at
bay 3b cents in order to make a margin of
profit upon the cost of grapes tne competi
tor in- ihe li^ist can sell that awiul con
coction called 'Catawba' wine tor 20 or 25
cents per gallon. 1 asKed the dealer how
such stuff: could be consumed and he told
me it was done by mixing it with some
characteristic California wine to give
flavqr. Furthermore, 1 learned that this
wine against which we have to compete
was dosed with enough salicylic acia. to
make it 'Keep on draught in any climate.'
P.'C. Rossi, president of the Italian-
Swiss Colony, who has just returned from
an extended. trip to. all the" principal East
ern-cities, brings a : surprisingly gloomy
report of Â¦ adverse â¢ conditions menacing
California wines . in the markets of the
East. Until recently it has been generally
believed .that the industry had entered
upon an era of prosperity that would con-,
tinue for many years, but Mr. Rossi finds
that this idea was ill founded, and he
backs up his conclusions with some very
stubborn facts." His journey was. largely
forÂ»the purpose of learning what new ob
stacle it .was "that had not only 'put a
check on the. demand for the winea of
California,, but in some markets reduced
it. It did not take him long to get at the
truth. .- ,

DIPHTHERIA ON' GOAT ISLAND
Strict Quarantine Enforced and Case3
Isolated.
Goat Island Is quarantined, and it may
be a month before anybody Is allowed to
visit either the naval training station or
the lighthouse quarters. Uncle Sam has
about 400 apprentice boys over there, and
diphtheria has broken out among them.
Yesterday morning 1 a lad named Creighton
died from the disease, and two or three
others are down with it. At first the cases
were not thought to be very serious, but
when Creighton died it was found to be
malignant, so the quarantine was at once
established.
Until every danger of infection' is passed
no communication will be allowed with
the mainland. All the boys who have
been open to Infection have been Isolated
and every precaution taken to prevent
the spread of the disease. The Pensacola
will become the home of all who are
known to be free from taint, and in a
short time the doctors hope that all dan
ger will be over.
A few days ago 146 boys were trans
ferred from the station to the training
ship Alert. This vessel is still in the
stream, and will not go to sea until it Is
known that there is absolutely no dan
ger. The boys have been long enough
away from Goat Island to make it almost
certain that none of them brought any
germs of diphtheria with them, but nev
ertheless no chances will be taken. From
here the Alert goes to Honolulu, thence
to the coast of Japan, returning home by
way of Puget Sound ports and the Colum
bia River. If all goes well at Goat Island
and there are no changes aboard the Alert
she may get away to-morrow.

There was some attempt at obstruction,
by members of the committee who have
been following false gods, and who, while
retaining their membership in the County
Committee, are training with the outsid
ers, at the same time using their position
in the committee to do politics for those
who under all decent circumstances
should be their enemies. ; %. .
The application for a place upon the pri
mary ballot is accompanied by the scheme
of apportionment. The scheme contem
plates a convention of 301, to be based
upon the average of the Republican votes
cast for Gage in 1S98, which was 2S.21S; for
I>avis at the same election, which was
Â£1^35, and for Samuel M. Shortridge. Elec
tor fcr McKinley, who in 1300 received
25,208 votes. The average of these votes
is 28.254, and the representation is pro
posed to fce one delegate for every ninety
four votes of the average. This will give
the following representation for the dif
ferent Assembly districts:
The Republican County Committee, the
real simon pure committee, met In the
Foresters' building last evening and de
cided upon a method of apportionment for
the coming municipal convention, the del
egates to which will be elected at the pri
maries next month.

as the "war room" at the White House.
This room was arranged during the Span

watch the movement of ships and troops
by means of inr.ps placed upon the wall3.
On these maps were recorded the location
of each regiment, company and ship, and
in the room were the telegraphic and cable
instruments.-
The new map will cover the whole west
side, of the room and will.be about thirty
feet by fifteen feet in dimensions. It shows
the location of all the cables in the world,
all the coaling stations arid all' the docks
where ships may.be repaired. Even the

the sovereignty, to "which they .are sub

United States, through their acquisition
for various purposes by American citi

' Germany, England, France and Italy have subjects
engaged in trade from the Rio Grande'to the Straits

the market, study its taste and feed, it with the.sur
plus of their respective countries. These merchants
have the same influence upon trade as the Chinese
merchants domiciled here.
It will be an excellent thing when American com
merciaj enterprise shall locate in South America.
Europe, of course, remains our best customer. The
standard of living there is, higher than in the other
grand divisions, and the wants of life are greater. The
only discouraging feature in the statistics is the low
state of our South American trade. The cause is
largely political. Public sentiment there has set
against us' since the Spanish war. ' Another more
corrigible reason is the lack of North American mer
chants in South America and of South American
merchants in North America. The trade is a hap
hazard, catch-as-catch-can affair, with but little study
of complimentary production and adaptation to the
taste of consumers.
THE statistics of American commerce for^rfie
fiscal year just closed explain the industrial
panic that has taken possession of Europe in
fear of American competition. Qur total exports
amounted to a billion and a half in round numbers.
Agriculture furnished 65 per cent and manufactures 27
per cent of that vast total. No other country exported
an equal amount, and several that call themselves
commercial nations did not equal it. The details of
the business for May and June are not yet complete,
but during the first ten months of the fiscal year we
exported to the value of $1,155,000,000 'to Europe; to
other North American countries, $195,000; to South
America, $44,000,000; Asia, $48,000,000; Oceanica, $36,
000,000; Africa, $26,000,000.
THE YEAR'S TRADE.
FROM our Eastern exchanges we learn that at the
commencement exercises of one of the higher
institutions of technical instruction there was a
frequent announcement in the distribution of diplomas
of the phrase "graduated but not present." The ex
planation of the absence, of so many students from
the exercises is that their services were so much in
demand they could not wait to complete the college
course, and the president" had given them permission
to go out and enter upon their work without forfeiting
their diplomas..
It is admitted that the case is an exceptional one.
Rarely has there been such a demand for specially
trained men as at this time when so many great in
dustrial enterprises are being reorganized and so many
new enterprises undertaken. Even under the excep
tional circumstances, however, the fact is significant
of the prestige which technical training has now ac
quired in the business world. . It proves the value
of education in industrial arts and applied sciences,
and effectually refutes the recent statement of Mr.
Schwab of the Steel Trust that college training is of
no benefit to young men in business'
The British of late, have had occasion to make an
earnest study of the causes that have enabled 'the
Germans and the Americans to become such potent
competitors for the trade of the world, and one of
them in summing up the opinions of experts on the
subject says: "With one voice they ascribe the sub
ordination of British supremacy to American and
German competition to the higher technical knowl
edge which -prevails" in the two latter countries,
whereby craft is developed under scientific direction
and initiative."
These experiences in the East should give a new
stimulus to technical education in California. '.. We
have as yet no, school of that sort equal to the higher
technical schools in the East. In this city there are
three foundations for technical instruction, and if they
could be combined so as to work together it is prob
able that ; out of them a really great technical college
might be bui^t up. â¢ Technical training of a high order
is a need of the time and we should not have to go
abroad to get it.- ,,
TECHNICAL. TRAINING WANTED.
He says the British have failed in taking the most
ordinary military precautions and in neglecting to en
trench", but their discipline is splendid, courage superb
and staying qualities beyond praise. He does not en
lighten us as to. their skill in avoiding or using pro
fanity, and apparently was not impressed by their ten
dency to read Scripture and sing the songs of Zion
in a strange land.
Captain Slocum's report of his experiences with the
British army is of less value, because from beginning
to end it betrays a toadying spirit, and is more de
voted to criticizing the Boers than to recording the
military means and methods employed by the Brit
ish. He takes occasion to say that the Boers lack
staying qualities. As they have stayed by the fight
for their independence for two years, though out
numbered ten to one in men and guns and a thousand
to one in resources, isolated and without an expres
sion of official sympathy from any part of the world,
Captain Slocum might have omitted that slur and de
voted himself to reporting British military operations,
which was his errand in South Africa.
They have been charged with violation of the rules
of war. A foreign attache to an army cannot say
much on such a subject, so when Captain Reichmann
says, "If there were any violations of the rules of
war they were not all on one side," it means much.
The sense of initiative and independence which he
found among the minor officers was astonishing.
When an order did not suit one of these he simply
disregarded it. This may have hindered concentration
and co-operative movement and prevented many a de
cisive blow. But initiative is not without value even
in a private soldier. In a stay of. seven months with
the Boers in their camps and on their marches Cap
tain Reichmann saw no drunkenness and heard no
profane word uttered. After the day's march or bat
tle these fighters read their Bibles and sang hymns.
They were more pained at the slaughter of the Brit
ish effected by their own sure aim than by the casu
alties on their own side.
THE reports of the United States military at
taches of the Boer and British armies in South
Africa are now both out and supply much inter
esting information and some less interesting opinions.
Captain Reichmann, who was with the Boers, says
they lacked discipline, though as men they are of a
very superior order. He will not be credited, how
ever, when he declares that the foreigners in the Boer
army, '"though few in number, were its aggressive
element."

TRADE DOLLAR-L. C. M., Yountvllle,
Cal. Congress by an act passed in 1873
authorized the coinage of a coin designated
as the trade dollar, to contain 420 grains
of t silver. While such coin was not in
tended for general circulation as dollars,
but for the convenience of merchants for
export to the Orient, the weight and fine
,ness being marked on the coin, it was by
the act made legal tender to the amount
of $5. The trade dollars did not get into
circulation,' and the decline in silver ren
dered the coinage of silver bullion into
trade dollars tor circulation profitable to
holders of bullion, as the actual value was
less than* that of the standard dollar? In
1S76 the clause in the act making the trade
dollar a legal tender was. repealed, the
coinage was thien restricted and in April,
1878, suspended. Congress deemed that,'
many having tcken such dollars on the*
strength of the name dollar, it was right
to indemnify the holders, so the Forty

As a result of appalling dimensions the
young giant, who is amiable enough in
appearance, has led a most peaceful life.
He declares that he has never yet found
any one willing to quarrel with him.
Nevertheless, he has his troubles. One
of them is the attention he attracts. This
unfortunate Gulliver is doomed to be on
exhibition his iife long, to be eternally
stared at by throngs of wondering Lilli
puts, never to be able to take a comfort
able casual stroll unless he finds some
desolate desert or untrodden prairie to do
it in. -
Wherever there are human beings with
eyes there Lewis Wilkins is regarded as a
free show.
Another unfortunate point about being
a giant is the expense. It is the most
costly role there is.
Mr. Wilkins sadly says a man cannot
get through life as a giant without pay
ing more than double for pretty nearly
everything except fresh a'r and soil to
walk on.
The giant's reckoning days with his
tailor ar& a serious matter.
MR. WILKINS CAN "TIP THE SCALES" AGAINST TWO 180-POUND MEN
AND CAN WITH EASE SUPPORT A MAN'S WEIGHT ON HIS OUT
STRETCHED ARM.
Twice as much material, more than
twice as much work, insists the tailor.
And the giant Is forced to pay $75 eaca
for the cheapest suits he has.
Hats boots and gloves have also to DO
made especially for him. The circumfer
ence of his hat where it fits his head 13
twenty-seven Inches. A comforting fea
ture is that it never gets mixed op with,
other people's hats.
The giant's gloves you will be able to
picture when you know that his third fin
ger is IY2 inches in diameter and 4Va inches
in circumference.
The hand It3elf measures five Inches
across the palm and twelve inches from,
the wrist to the tip of the middle finger.
When opened to its utmost his hand win
span thirteen inches. His friends declare
that Mr. Wilkins" handshake Is a formid
able affair.
The giant bar achieved considerable
prowess as an athlete, his skill in this di
rection having shown its practical value
last summer at Atlantic City, when Mr.
Â¦Wilkins saved a man and a woman from
drowning by wading- in the water up to
his neck and with all his clothes on when
he heard their crle3 for help.
Swimming and riding are his favorlto
sports, while he also improves his physi
cal condition with bag-punching and the
Sandow exerciser used indoors.
His. interests are not exclusively ath
letic. He is an excellent linguist, a
stamp and coin collector and actively In
terested In politics, his affiliations being
Republican.
It is not surprising that the people are not enthu
siastic over the success of the Mayor. as a solicitor
of charity. This city, which is rich and liberal enough
to provide for all of its wants, is set before the coun
try in the position of a beggarly town compelled to
ask aid from outsiders. Under these circumstances
it is gratifying to know that the Mayor was un
authorized to enter upon any such solicitation. The
begging was not done by San Francisco.
The form in which this solicited gift comes to us
is unfamiliar. The people of San Francisco and of
California generally have received many gifts from our
own millionaires, but none of them has been made a
matter of bargain. The noble benefactions of Lick,
Stanford, Wilmerding and others have been free gifts
to the people. In no case has the donor imposed a
tax upon the public to maintain an institution de
signed to perpetuate his memory and to benefit the
community. The full freedom of the gifts made by
the spontaneous liberality of generous men who ac
quired their wealth in California and were identified
with the community is thus in striking contrast with
the conditions imposed upon the comparatively small
sum which Mr. Carnegie has vouchsafed to bestow
in response to the begging of the Mayor. Stanford,
Lick and others gave millions, arid the public was
not ,asked to expend one cent for maintenance of any
institution they founded; but for Mr. Carnegie's $750,
000 we must give sites that will cost many thousands
of dollars, and in addition must provide $75,000 a year
so long as the city stands. /
The gift comes to us, then, not as a spontaneous
act of liberality from a friend, but as a dole conceded
in response to solicitation. Under the circumstances
it is not surprising to learn that it does not come to
us as a free gift. The giver dictates the manner in
which it shall be used and exacts from us more than 1
he give's. We, are to furnish sites for the central li
brary building and for the buildings' for the branch
libraries. We are, furthermore, to expend $75,000 a
year to maintain the. libraries, so that without count
ing the cost of the sites we are within ten years to
furnish for maintenance a sum equal to the whole of
the solicited donation. It will be seen that Mr. Car
negie drives as shrewd a bargain in philanthropy as
pver he did in business. He requires the city to fur
nish him a site on which to erect a monument to his
liberality, and then to support it forever after.
There are many objectionable features in the trans
action. In the first .place, there is something dis
pleasing to every self-respecting citizen in the fact
that the Mayor should have put the city in the atti
tude of a beggar going about begging from outsid
ers money to. supply any of the needs of the com
munity. . Mr. Carnegie is not now nor has ever been
in any way identified with San Francisco. He is a
rich man upon" whom we have no claims, either sen
timental or otherwise. In soliciting money from him
the Mayor was literally begging from strangers. It
was putting San Francisco in the position of one that
seeks chanty and is indifferent from what hand it
comes. ... â¢ -
WHEN first the announcement was made of
the gift of Andrew Carnegie of $750,000 to
San Francisco for . library purposes there
arose many expressions of delight from. the unreflect
ing. The Mayor, who had solicited the gift, showed
a disposition to pose as if he himself were the bene
factor, and. in some circles there was an evident ten
dency to do him honor. Now, however, the public
has had time to consider the gift and its meaning,
and_it is perceived' that the whole affair puts San
Francisco in a false light and goes far to discredit
her. Â¦ !
MR. CARNEGIE'S GIFT.
We are no champion of the canteen. It was better
than the system it superseded. But such talk as the
Rev. Mr. Ferguson's will raise up friends for it
rather than, enemies. The time has passed when state
ments made in such a discussion are received as facts
simply because of the cloth of the 'man who makes
them.
This reverend gentleman* also states as a. fact that
army chaplains have been ordered from Washington
to cease reporting about the canteen. Ordered by
whom? Only the President or the Secretary of War
could issue such an order. Which has done it? Army
orders are not secret. They are matters of record.
Can this ordained man produce such an order, or any
one who has seen or received it? His charge is a
serious one. against the President and Secretary.
Does any one believe that either has issued such an
order? If it has not been issued what must be said
of the veracity of Rev. Mr. Ferguson?
Mr. Ferguson has made another discovery which
will be challenged. When, where and to whom did
the deadfall keepers favor the canteen? If they said,
"The soldiers begin their sprees inside and finish them
outside," to whom did they say it?
Now there are several statements that are facts or
falsehoods, which? Did the use of the light beers and
wines furnished in the canteen sicken Shafter's army?
Did that hastily mobilized force have the canteen
along? Did the canteen destroy the most of a British
army, which once died in front of Santiago, failing to
capture it, where Shafter succeeded? What evidence
is there that taking soldiers away from the bad whisky
and worse associates of the deadfall and giving them
a reading-room, library and liquors with only 9 per
cent of alcohol was followed by "murder, suicide and
riot"? The enlisted man must be a singular person
if he is a Christian gentleman on rotten whisky and
a brute on light beer.
Chicago was the first scene of the celebration of
this great victory. Spick and span new deadfalls rose
around Fort Sheridan, and first payday that vicinity
was given over to sodden drunkenness, debauchery
and disorder. The same results have followed the
abolition of the canteen everywhere. The harm done
by the change has been observed and testified to by
thousands.. Enlisted men of the better class and of
ficers have given their testimony, but the reformer is
impervious to facts. Fanaticism has nothing to do
with facts. So that class of. people who go about
doing harm from good motives have set out to kick
the dead canteen.
The Chicago Methodist ministers were addressed
on the subject by Rev.. William P. F. Ferguson. That
reverend gentleman, among other things, said: "The
flood of beer received by Shafter's army was worse
than the scanty rations. The canteen was the cause
of the sickness that broke out in the army before San
tiago. The canteen is like all other saloons in its re
sults. Murder, suicide and riot have followed in its
wake. It has been condemned by army officers and
privates alike. The liquor dealers, however, favor its
presence. They say tbre- soldiers begin their sprees in-,
side and finish them outside. Â« Chaplains in the army
are afraid to talk against the evil. They have been
ordered from Washington to cease reporting about the
Government saloons. The men whÂ© have repeatedly
said that in the absence of the canteen drunkenness
has increased and riots have been incited have grossly
slandered the soldiers."
AT the last monthly meeting of the. Methodist
ministers of Chicago the, armjr canteen came
in for special treatment. It is a subject which
some people seem incapable of approaching in Â¦[ any
other than a fanatical attitude. Men' and women who
can reason upon other things lose their reason when
they use the vocabulary of . "reform." Enlisted men
in our regular army are not all members of the Band
of Hope nor graduates of the various thedlogical
seminaries. They are the average of all the nation
alities to which we give an asylum. The army can
teen found them the prey of the deadfalls that exist
around every army post, and it gave them light drinks,
a reading-room, books and newspapers, and was the
post club. The army officers testified to the moral
and physical improvement of the men. In the can
teen they had 'access to .the use of light wines and
beer, were excluded from whisky and other distilled
and highly alcoholic liquors, and their appetite for
something of that kind was satisfied without making
them drunk or bringing them into degrading associa
tions. The profits made on the light liquors and
lunches went into a common fund to stock the post
library. To the reasonable but perhaps unregenerate
man this seemed a great advance over the old dead
fall system, which consisted of a mixture of the worst
whisky with the worst vices that tempt men and
transform them into devils. But not so with the re
generate and exalted. To them the old way was pre
ferable, and they smote the canteen until Congress, in
great haste, kicked it out.
PACT, OR FANATICISM?
far our Government has failed in this respect. The
policy is bad. , This Government should promptly
compel respect for the rights of its citizens abroad.
We get no trade by the opposite policy and have none
to lose by letting the other Americas know that our
flag, is over the head of every 'citizen of this republic.
Some firmness arid promptness in this direction will
probably ; take some of the shame .and sting out of
future statistics of our. trade with our southern neigh
bors. ?c'W'> S :

more a matter of personal arrangement,

Encouraging reports of the
of the ironworkers' strike were received
yesterday at the headquarters of the Iron
Trades Council and at the office of Sec
ertary Wisler, of the local Machinists'
Union. These were embraced in dis
patches from the Hast, sanctioned by
President O'Connell, and which read as
follows:
. WASHINGTON, July 8.â James O'Connell:
On Friday and Saturday last we made settle
ments with the Goss Printing Press Company
of Chicago, employing 250 machinists, the com
pany granting the nine-hour day with 10 per
cent increase in wages. The Potter Printing
Prefs Company of Plalnfleld, N. J., settled on
Saturday, affecting 200 men, on the same basis.
The Buffalo Forge Company signed the regular
agreement, nine hours and 10 per cent increase,
with all other clauses added. Samuel XÂ±.
Wood & Co. of Elizabeth, N. J., made a set
tlement yesterday with the nine-hour day and
j 10 per cent Increase, establishing a 25-cent
minimum rate and affecting 150 machinists.
The Scott Printing Press Company of Plain
: field, N. J. . and the J. IÂ«. Moore '"Engineering
Company of Elizabeth, N. J., accepted the
minimum rate. The Case Engineering Com
pany of Mattoon, 111., settled on Friday, grant
ing nine hours with increase of wages, affecting
sixty men. The .National Caah Register Com
pany of Dayton, O., signed the agreement
Monday, with Increase of wages and a strict
ly union shop, affecting 1800 people, 200 machin
ists being among the number. The officials of
this company, who have been in conference
with us, for several days, made a settlement,
accepted by the men, which includes the nine
hour day, wages adjusted agreeably to our
members, and no. machinist is to receive less
for the minimum scale for nine hours than
he formerly received for ten hours. The shop
is to be a strictly union shop. This is
considered a great victory, as the National
Cash Register Company is a member of the
National Metal Trades Association, and was
also a leader of the Manufacturers' Association
of Dayton. The Gould Pump Company, Seneca
Falls. N. T.. has granted the nine-hour day
and the Increase of wages, and the reinstate
ment of all men.
"While reports received from the East
ern centers of the ironworkers' strike in
i dicate a change in the situation, the local
situation remains practically unchanged.
It is admitted at the various headquarters
that although the men have been out for
seven weeks no appreciable gain has been
made. In other words, the facts indi
cate that at least one of the leading shops
has secured a number of men,' but what
their ability to handle the work may be
is a mooted 'question. In this particular
shop work is going ahead on a small
scale, about one-quarter of the men previ
ously engaged being now employed.

The executive committee of the union has

to-day what disciplinary measures to pur
sue. At the meeting last night a strong
determination was expressed to maintain
the rates at present in force, and resist
any attempt to reduce them. The mem
bers of the union are determined to give
the people good work, and only ask, they
say, fair. pay for their work.
The Retail Grocery Clerks' Association
met at B'nai B'rith Hall and had a most
enthusiastic session. Efforts are being
made toward a>n early closing movement,
and the wish of the retail clerks in this
direction was heartily indorsed. A, large
number of applications was received and
favorably decided upon.
A proposition emanating from the Re
tail Drug Clerks' Association, circulated
among the various labor unions and or
ganizations of the city, is meeting
hearty encouragemsnt. Union after union
is indorsing the plan, and the retail drug
store proprietors are heartily in accord.
Drug clerks ask that customers make their
purchases before 9 p.m. Some other small
details as to hours, covering. the down
town stores that remain open all night,
are involved. But as there is a universal
feeling both on the part of the? proprietors
and the clerks as to shortening of hours,
an agreement may soon be reached.
Judge Angellotti issued a citation direct
ing John Biter and his wife to appear be
fore him next Monday at 2 o'clock and
show cause why the children should not
be taken from their custody. They are
further directed to bring the seventeen lit
tle ones Into court on that day.>
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott, secretary of the
Children s Protective Association, was
here to-day and said that the action taken
by Mr. White was unjustified; that many
of the children who were with the Biters
were sent by her society and were well
cared for. She seemed to believe that it
was jealousy that prompted the action of
the other society. The children range
from 1 year to 8 years of age.
The harrowing story as told In the
papers filed to-day loses nothing of its
brutality when the petition further states
that an insane brother of John Biter is
allowed to mingle with the children, and
even occupy the same hut. The petition
declares that unless some one intervene
all of the children are liable to die from
exposure and neglect.
In the petition it I* alleged that the lit
tle ones are in the custody of John Biter
and his wife Catherine, that they are the
victims of extreme neglect and that their
health and lives are in peril. It is further
alleged that the children, are compelled to
sleep in a dilapidated and decrepit shack,
the ceiling of which is only five feet high,
the shanty proper being only nine by six
teen feet in dimensions. Great cracks
and knotholes allow the night winds to
blow killing draughts over the little ones
as they try to sleep in the hovel.
SAN RAFAEL,, July 8.â Steps were
taken to-day by Secretary M. J. White of
the San Francisco Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children to rescue the
seventeen children now held by John
Biter and his wife at their baby, farm near
Sausallto. Purcell Rowe, attorney for the
society, applied to Superior Judge Ajigel
lotti for letters of guardianship for eleven
boys and six girls. The true names being
unknown, the children were given ficti
tious ones.

FARM'S HORRORS
Each of these mills has been blown up
before, and in the corning mill J. Steiner
and C. Larsen met death only a short
time ago. The mills are situated in a red
wood forest, and it was soon ablaze.
Within a short time a .forest fire was mak
ing its way up the mountain. The powder
works were closed and all of the em
ployes began fighting the conflagration.
In an hour they had it under control.
â¢William Darling, who was killed to-day,
has been employed at the works for about
forty years. After an absence of several
years he returned Â»a year ago to resume
his old position. He is survived by a
widow and family. Darling was a native
of Massachusetts and was <54 years of age.
His brother is Rev. C. H. Darling, a lead
ing Methodist minister.
The first building destroyed was the
corning milL It was here that Darling
was employed. The report was terrific,
as thirty barrels of powder exploded. The
mill was a three-sided affair, the walls of
concrete and the roof of galvanized ijÂ»n.
The roof wes lifted and scattered over the
works, and of the building hardly a stick
of wood was left. The heavy machinery
was twisted and broken and was thrown
against the concrete walls. It will take
several thousand dollars to replace this
machinery.
Darling was hurled about seventy-five
feet ana was thrown against the bank.
He was scarcely recognizable, as he was
so badly burned and mangled.
The wheel mills are within 400 feet .of
the corning mill and the explosion there
was caused by the concussion. These
mills are similarly built and are three
sided. They were completely wrecked.
Joseph Maynard is foreman of them. He
was just leaving" No. 6 and Â¦was badly
shaken, bruised and cut, but not seriously
injured. He was thrown quite a distance.
In each of these mills there were about
two ard a half barrel^ of powder. John
Geyer, George Robinson ana John Farrell
are employed in them, but luckily they
were some distance from the mills at the
time of the explosions. X
SANTA CRUZ, July 8.â "William R.
Darling lost his life and Joseph Maynard
was badly injured in a series of explosions
at the California Powder Works near this
city this morning. The first explosion.oc
curred in the corning mill, in which
Darling was employed, and the concussion,
caused the blowing up of two other mills
nearly 400 yards away. Several other efn
ployes of the works received injuries, but
escaped serious harm.
The mills that went up were the corning
mill and what are known as the number 6
and number 7 single-wheel mills, where
the black sporting powder is manufac
tured. As has been the case in every ex
plosion at these works, the cause will
never be known.

It is said that criminal proceedings will
be instituted against Vetter at an early
date, and that the father of his victim
will supply funds for the prosecution. Ac
cording to the statements of the railroad
employes, the conductor acted in self-de
fense, and as the friends of the dead man
have disappeared it is doubtful if a con
viction will ever be bad.
The comrades of Trezise had aided him
in the light, but the head brakeman and
several others of the train crew by an in
discriminate use of clubs caused them to
beat a hasty retreat. Vetter is a man
weighing about 115 pounds, while his ad
versary tipped the scales at the 290-pound
mark.
The wounded man was soon placed on.
the westbound overland and taken to Los
Angeles for medical treatment- At first
he was not believed to be seriously
wounded and the train crew proceeded on
its way to 1 uma.
SAN BERJCAREIXO, July 8.â "William
Trezise, the tramp who was shot in the
head en June 30 by Conductor Frank Vet
ter near Ogllby, a station on the Southern
Pacific between Indio and Yuma, and who
died two days later at the Sisters' Hospi
tal in Los Angeles, proves to have been
the son of a capitalist in Salt Lake City.
At the time of the shooting a comrade of
the "wounded man, in speaking of him to
a. member of the freight crew, said that
"his old man was fixed proper In Salt
Lake and had all kinds of money," but
no attention was paid to the assertion. At
the hospital an attendant gave the In
formation tiiat the dying man had once
referred to a relative in the Utah capital.
After Trezist's death an investigation was
made by the undertaker. The body of the
unfortunate man was about to be interred
at the expense of Los Angeles County

The dead tramp is said to have been a
member of one of the best known and
most influential families in Salt Lake
City. He was about 30 years of age and
apparently possessed of a good education,
though he preferred the lite of a tramp.
Young Trezise met death because of his
determination to steal a ride on an east
bound freight train. In company- with
live other tramps he boarded the train at
a poir.t east of indio in an effort to reach
Yuma. Their ultimate destination was
Kew Orleans. Conductor Vetter ordered
them to get off and they reluctantly
obeyed. When the train started up the
tramps again got aboard.
Three limes they were put cff. The last
time Vetter came upon Trezise in an
eiapty car. When ordered out of the car
Trezise drew a knife and a fight ensued.
Tlie conductor used the butt end of his
revolver on Trezise, but in so doing the
weapon was accidentally discharged. The
buliet entered Trezise's head, back of the
!eft ear.

NEW YORK. July 8.â The action of prices
In to-day* Â¦ etock market made It evident that
very large financial Interests were conducting
some notable operations. The effort was made
to have it appear that some occult maneuver
was going on. designed to inveigle the public
Into parting with their stocks at declining
prices for the benefit of the large financial
interests, who seemed to be themselves sell
ing stocks with great Industry. The final ac
tion of the market left little room to doubt
that urgent liquidation was being effected
Great caution must be exercised to Judge cor
rectly how far the liquidation was influenced
by the immediate developments of the day and
how far by a reneral sense of disquiet and
distrust which has been Graining force In the
market for several weeks past. The episode of
the Seventh National Bank failure and of the
bank failures in Buffalo have become suffi
ciently clear to indicate that they are not of
prime Importance In the immediate losses In
volved or In the Immediate collateral effects
but as a possible symptom of general condi
tions they have received serious attention. The
accumulation of doubtful securities has al
ways proved a consequence of a period of in-
Auetrlal expansion, bu&inees prosperity and the
general credit which is thereby caused. The

by the Chicago Great Western. The purpose was
said to be a desire to be bought, and because
the road is In a position to Interfere with other
deals. Atchison fell heavily and- others fol
lowed. ' Berlin then came to the front as a free
seller of stocks. A rumor was current that
another German bank, the identity of which
was not revealed, was down. German favor
ites were flat and finally at the close of busi
ness there was a vague rumor on the street
that another New York bank had suspended.
The net result was that quotations closed at
the bottom with traders frightened at shadows.

CHICAGO, July 8.â The heaviness of domes
tic receipts, the downward trend of foreign
markets, ' together with 1 weather of the most
perfect character, all combined to cause a
weak opening In wheat. The trading was
largely for local account and without any par
ticular feature. The bull influences were the
large decrease on passage and small world's
shipments, but their effect was scarcely no
ticed.' September opened %@%c lower at 64%c,
and weakness prevailed during the entire ses
sion. The low point wai reached at 64%@64i4c,
which figures marked the close, with a loss
of one cent.
Corn was fairly active early In the session
and the opening was firm. The bull factors
were the dry weather throughout the South
west'with still higher temperatures to. follow.
September closed %c higher at 48@48V6c.
Profit-taking by local longs caused the early
decline.
Oats were influenced by Â¦Imilar Influences as
operating in corn. The opening was strong and
the Ktreneth continued throughout the day
September closed %@%c higher at 30c.
Provisions were weak and did not appear to
take any advantage from the strong market
In corn and oats. September pork i closed 30c
lower, lard 5@7 1 / Â£c lower and rigs 7'/4c lower.

The circular says:
"The article continues In about the same
position a3 noted in our circular of June 27.
Our midsummer season is rarely a good period
for coffee, and the movement in prices has
been, principally for this reason, against it
where any chnage has occurred. Brazil cof
fees In New York have scarcely fluctuated. No.
7 Rio having closed yesterday %c lower than a
month ago,, and altogether the situation is a
waiting one.
"The stock movement here for the past thir
ty days, In all kinds, totals 21,586 bags â un
usually â¢ full â but of these quite a proportion
comprise deliveries on earlier contracts, ex
ports to foreign countries and permanent with
drawals of Central American and other varie
ties.
"To-day's first hand stock consists of .10.771
bags Costa Rica, 1078 Nicaragua. 20,504 Salva

Forecast Official.
Ccmmercial News Annual.
were withheld from Bale only by reason of the
support which has been accorded to prices by
big syndicates and moneyed interests. The In
dications were that a considerable part of this
support was withdrawn and large holdings
were dislodged because of the decline in prices
which was allowed to occur. The selling waa
concentrated in character, the bulk of It com
ing from a few Stock Exchange houses who
have often acted for Western capitalists, some
of whom had become prominent In the steel
trade before the formation of the United States
Steel Corporation and have been relegated to
the background since the rise of that corpora
tion. The selling attributed to this source was
enormous not only of the United States Steel
stocks themselves, but of the railroad stocks
which led the slump. The Immediate cause
of the weakness of this group was the reported
announcement by the Atchison authorities that
freight rates would be cut in the Chicago-
Missouri River territory July 15. As the rail
roads In this territory comprise the particular
properties supposed to have been brought into
community of interests, and as there has been
a large speculation in them founded on thid
supposition, the hostility manifested by a
cutting of rates made them peculiarly vulner
able. They led the decline all day with only
occasional straggling rallies on covering by
bear traders. In the final break St. Paul fell
an extreme 10%. Missouri Pacific 8, Union Pa
ciflo 7%. Atchison 6% and United States Steel,
I which had offered some resistance during the
day, suddenly dropped 4 points under very
heavy offerings. The market closed in a semi
demoralized condition.
The call loan rate was offered down from 8
per cent in the morning to 2 per cent at the
close, without relieving the weakness of the
stock market. Rumors of financial difficulties
could not be traced to any reliable source, nor
could anything be learned to justify them.
Railroad bonds were weak in sympathy with
stocks. Total sales. par value, $2,960,000.
United States refunding 2s advanced % per cent

Nezv York Metal Market.
NEW YORK, July 8.â Since last Wednesday
there was^an advance of about Â£8 In priced
for cpot tin In the London market. This was
due entirely to local causes, the available
stock on spot being controlled by one concern.
The general trend of the market abroad seems
to be Indicated by a decline of 15s in the price
for futures. 'The futures In London closed at
Â£119 and spot closed at Â£138. The advance In
spot tin abroad did not have the slightest effect
on the New York market. On the contrary
prices have fallen away about 1 cent since
Wednesday owing to light demand and quite
free offerings, with the closing tone weak.
The local closing price is $27@27 50.' The Lon
don copper market ruled steady at the close
with prices a shade firmer, spot closing at
Â£67 us and futures at Â£67 13s. The local copper
market was halting, with prices more or less,
nominal on the basis of 17c for Lake Superior
and 16%c for electrolytic and casting.
The lead markets at home and abroad were
quiet and Â¦ unchanged. Spelter was dull and
unchanged here, -while at London prices -were
5s better, closing at Â£16 15s; New York closed

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ The foreign . markets were weak
and sluggish. The world's shipments for the
week were. as follows >( .in quarters: Russian,
1C3,000; Danubian, 9000; Argentine. 30,000; In
dian, , 64,000: Australian, 47,000. Paris dealers
estimated the French crop at about 300,000,000
bushels, and said that the damage to the crop
by the recent thunderstorms was not serious, i
The American visible supply decreased 1,105.
000 bushels. Chicago was easier, owing to
lower cables and considerable liquidation.
There' was no speculative support. There was
no rain of any consequence in the West, and
warmer weather in the Southwest "was pre
dicted.
This market was weak and quiet, with a de
cline In futures.

â¢ OATSâ Reports from the East are unfavor
able. The last Government report indicated a
crop shortage of 100,000,000 bushels, and owing
to the hot and dry weather in the Oat States
it Is expected . that the next report will still
further increase the deficiency. St. Louis re
ports that the country is buying Oats and Corn
on hot and dry weather damage. .

vanced In sympathy with very strong Eastern
markets. The West Is still suffering from hot

over half a crop of Corn, and that without it
the crop will be a failure. Small round Yellow,

Peters. '
Robert Borrisch, a Paciflc-street cigar
dealer, was held up by five young fellows
on Webb street, a small thoroughfare
between Kearny and Montgomery street3,
near California, shortly after midnight.
The robbers emptied his pockets of every
thing tney contained.
Borrisch's shout3 attracted the attention
of Policeman Peters and Special Officer
Harris, who phased after the gang-. They
ran down Kearny street, and at Sacra
mento street separated. Officer Peters
pursued a lone thief, who ran up Sacra
mento street, while Harris kept after the
other four.
Peters gained on the culprit and finally
fired a shot in the air from his revolver,
which brought the thief to a halt. HÂ©
was taken to the City Prison and charged
-with robbery. He gave the name of Vin
cent Mohr and his residence at 208 Town
send street.
When arrested Mohr attempted to hide
a watch about his person, but was pre
vented. At the prison it waa identified by
Borrisch a3 his property.

Banquet Given in His Honor in
View of His Departure for
Boston.
Mrs. Craven was asked whether she was
going to continue fighting the cas>e if a
settlement was not reached. "I have al
ways been a friend to the Fair children,"
she said. "Both sides have learned by this
time that litigation is expensive, but If
they press me to go Into' court for a sec
ond trial I will spare no one. I- will intro
duce pew witnesses and evidence will be
introduced by others that will be startling
to the other side. I hope the children will
save the Senator's money by not continu
ing the litigation."
"I will neither deny nor affirm the story
that Senator Fair adopted a child. I have
already stated on the witness stand that
Senator Fair had no child by me, nor did
both of us adopt a child. When Mr. Pier
son asked me on the witness stand wheth
er the Senator nad adopted a child my at
torneys objected to the question and the
court sustained the objection. On the ad
vice of my attorneys I will have to be ex
cused from answering your question."
There was some discussion as to the
value of the North Beach water lots and
other holdings of the deceased, after
which an adjournment waa taken until
this morning.
In regard to the statement that a brand
new heir was to be produced to claim the
Fair millions, Mrs. Craven said last night:
Pence then became silent and Judge
Troutt ordered that the hearing of the
application of Theresa A. Oelrichs, Vir
ginia Vanderbllt and Charles I*. Fair for
distribution to them of the personal prop
erty of decedent's estate proceed. Charles
Neil, manager of the Fair estate, was
called to the stand to testify as to the
value of the property in question and the
amount of the income therefrom since the
death of James G. Fair. He said that the
rents bad amounted to $1,370,000 and the
sale of personal property, including
wheat, brought in J3.580.000.
Then for the evident purpose of proving
the claim of the attorneys that the estate
had increased in value till It is now worth
$17,000,000 Mr. Neil testified that stock \n
the Monongahela River Railway Com
pany, which Â¦was appraised for $240, had
been sold for $60,000, and that the Harts
horn block, which was inventoried at $17,
600, had been sold for $45,000.
As counsel representing the executors of
the deceased millionaire's will are anxious
that the court pass upon their petition for
attorney fees, thi3 statement caused them
dismay. Attorney Lafe Pence, represent
ing Mrs. Craven, stated that the last trial
occupied ninety days, and that as he had
become possessed of additional evidence
the coming hearing would take, more time
than the former. Pence asked that a day
be set for the beginning of the siege, but
the court put the matter over for reflec
tion.
Counsel representing Mrs. Kettle R.
Craven announced in Judge Troutt's court
yesterday, that they would require more
than three months to present their proofs
that Mrs. Craven Is entitled to share in
the final distribution of the estate of the
late James G. Fairâ that she Is entitled to
the widow's portion.

ARGUMENT IN MARIPOSA
WATER CASE IS OPENED
The final arguments in the action insti
tuted by John R. Hite against the Madera
Canal and Irrigation Company, an action
involving millions, were opened in this
city yesterday morning before Judge John
M. Corcoran of Mariposa, sitting- in Judge
Kerrigan's department of the Superior-
Court; The point in issue Is the right to
the use of the water of a small creek that
flows into the south fork of the Merced
River, high up in the Mariposa Moun
tains.
Behind the plaintiff, Hlte. Is the Qrock
er-Huffman Land and Water Company,
which controls a large body of arable
land, where the water is needed for irri
gation. On the other side is the Madera
Canal and Irrigation Company and the
Madera Sugar Pine Lumber Company,
operating large sawmills and distributing
water for the irrigation of thousands of
acres of land in Madera County. On be
half of the plaintiff it is claimed that
since- 1863 up to the present day Hite has
been a riparian owner.
The testimony in the case was taken in
Mariposa County and was transferred to
this city for argument on motion of coun
sel, who wanted to be In reach of the
many big law libraries in the city. James
F. Peck of Merced opened the argument
on behalf of the plaintiff and continued
up to the hour of adjournment. It is ex
pected that two weeks will be occupied in
the arguments.

PRINCIPALS IN. A PRETTY WED
DING LAST NIGHT AT THE
WINDSOR HOTEL.
Some thoughts, started by reading an article
with the above title in Nature, in 1898. by
Horace Brown, and Jotted down at that time
but laid aside, I have thought might perhaps
interest the readers of science, especially as the
subject continues to be agitated.
Heretofore in cases of dormant life, as in
seeds kept for years, perhaps centuries, or In
desiccated infusoria, etc., in which under fa
vorable conditions active iire is revived, it has
been supposed that very slow metabolic
changes still go on during the state of dor
mancyâlife is supposed to be feeble but not ex
tinct The same wa* supposed to be the case in
seeds or bacteria exposed to intense cold of
â180 degrees toâ 200 degrees, C, but Pictet or
even _250 degrees by Dewar. . >
But it Js now proved that at this tempera
ture chemical affinity is destroyed, and all
chemical changes arrested, and therefore the
chemical changes characteristic of lifeâmeta
bolismâalso must cease. But with the return
of heat, they revive. Therefore, in this case,
life seems to spring spontaneously from dead
matter. Must we then revive the old doctrine
of spontaneous generation? If not we must
change or greatly modify our conceptions of
From such experiments It Is evident that, al
though life ie, Indeed, a distinct form of energy,
yet its nearest alliance is with chemism. For
as chemism Is completely destroyed by extreme
cold and again revived by heat, so life may T>e
completely arrested by cold and" again revived
by heat â If the molecular structure character
istic of living protoplasm (whatever that may
be) remains unchanged.
What then Is the necessary condition of life â
or. to put it more clearly, what is the difference
between dead protoplasm and living protoplasm
or rather protoplasm capable of Ufe? Evidently
it is not a difference in chemical composition,
for no change in this regard takes place in the
act of death. It is, I suppose, a difference 'in
molecular arrangement â a difference- in allo
tropic condition. As the necessary condition of
chemical properties is a certain equivalent
composition, eo the necessary condition of vital
properties Is, in addition, a certain molecular
constitution. But as equivalent composition
may remain, even though chemical activity be
absent, so also the peculiar molecular constitu
tion characteristic of life may remain, - even
though lifeâ I. e., active life-be absent. Ab
the chemism may be completely destroyed by
cold and revived by heat, if the necessary con
dition, viz., a certain equivalent composition,
remains: eo life may be completely destroyed
by cold and again revived by heat if eo be the
necessary conditionâ a certain molecular con
stitution remains. _ . . ,: . . :
Again, Mr. Brown In the article referred to
savs that Spencer's definition of life, viz.: "a
continuous adjustment of internal to' external
conditions," must be, revived, since it applies
only to active life, and not to suspended life.
I think not. Life in the true sense, i. e.,
actual life, .must be activeâ the essential nature
of life, as of all energy, is activity; but there
Is a necessary underlying? condition, 1. e. a
peculiar molecular constitution, which may De
called potential life. As equivalent composition
is potential chemism, which may under certain
conditions become actual chemism,. so a pecu
liar - molecular constitution . of protoplasm Is
potential life, , which may under certain con
ditions become actual life.. Death is not merely
an extinction of life, I. e., actual life, but
also the destruction of the necessary condition
of life. i. e.. the characteristic molecular struc
ture of protoplasm. i Extinction of life. Â¦' there
fore Is not necessarily death. There are there
fore three conditions of protoplasm, viz. : (i)
living, a condition in which life Is actual 1 (2)
potentially living. In ' which the necessary
molecular constitution or vital constitution is
present; and (3) dead. In which the vital con-"
atltution Is also wanting. â¢-Â¦..-.- Â«

WHAT IS LIFE?
Strange to say Dr. Le Conte's last pub
lished article was on "What is Life?" It
appeared in "Science," a New York week
ly, in the issue of June 21, of this year.
The article was in the form of a short
communication and was as follows:
Last Published Article.
President Wheeler said to-day that so
far as he knew no attempt would be made
to refill Professor Le Conte's position in
the faculty. Of recent years his work
had been left to his own free will and he
had attended classes only when he chose.
The faculty. In his department is at pres
ent full.
Quiet prevailed at the university to
day. Over the college and college town
where Dr. Le Conte's life work had been
mostly done, a feeling of deep sorrow
holds sway in all minds. The university
flag floated at half mast and at many pri
vate residences the national 1 colors were
displayed in honor of the departed scien
tist. â¢ '
The following telegram was received to
day by President Wheeler:
The president and faculty of the Leland Stan
ford Junior University learn with deep regret
of the death of Professor Joseph Le Conte, and
beg to extend their sympathy to -his family
and to the University of Calirornia.
J. C. BRANNER, Acting President.
An unsigned telegram came also from
the Yosemite Valley as follows:
Students at Yosemite beg to suggest their
beloved friend be laid under Le Conte oak.
J. N. Le Conte, son of the deceased, who
is on his wedding trip in the Kings River
district, has not been heard from. The
messenger who has been sent in is ex
pected to reach him in time for his arri
val in Berkeley to-morrow night or at
the latest, Thursday morning. .
Son Not Yet Heard From.
Dr. Le Conte's body will be removed to
morrow from the parlors of an Oakland
undertaker, where it was placed on its
arrival from the Yosemlte Valley, and
taken to the family residence. . There it
will remain in private until Thursday.
Bishop Nichols and Rev. Mr. Swan will
conduct private services at the family
residence, 2739 Bancroft way, an hour
prior to the public ceremony. Members
of the Le Conte family and a few of their
intimate friends. only will be present. The
body will be laid to rest in Mountain View
cemetery. The. services at the grave will
be private.
According to the present plans at the
close of the public service the body will
lie In state until the assembled friends
have taken a last parting look at the well
known f orin. - â¢ Â» '
Professor C. L. Cory, a close friend of
the Le Contes, has taken charge of pri
vate arrangements- and is carrying out
the requests of Mrs. Le' Conte. The fol

Services at which the public may pay
a. last tribute to the beloved scientist will
be held Thursday at- 3 p. m... in Hearst

Flees.
HUSBAND LOOKS
FOR HIS BABY
ALAMEDA, July 8.â Having suddenly
become bereft of his wife and baby
through the machinations of the first
named, Bertram Hill of Â£707 Central ave
nue advertises that after this day he will
not be responsible for the debts contract
ed by either of them. Hill has been look
ing high and low and. in all manner of
out-of-the-way places since Saturday for
his baby, but so far he has not been able
to strike. a lead that will take him to the
lair of it and the mother, whom he
charges with spiriting it away. Hill says
he doesn't care if his wife' never comes
back, but he wants the baby.
"I don't know what's the matter with
my wife," said Hill this afternoon. "We
didn't have any quarrel at all and we were
getting along fine. So was the baby.
When my wife asked me last Saturday
for car fare to go across the bay to see
her sister I handed it out. and she went.
That's the last I've seen of her.
"When my wife hadn't come home Sun
day I got suspicious. I looked around and
noticed that some of the bric-a-brac was
missing, and I think my Â¦wife came back
Saturday while I wasn't home and packed
the articles off with her.
"Later I went to the home of my wife's
sister in San Francisco, but she had not
showed up there, so I made up-.my mind
that she had run away with the baby.
I've been looking all over creation for the
childâ walked my feet off, pretty nearlyâ
but I can't locate it. My wife can stay
away if she wants to, but I -want that
baby back, and I'm going to have it."
Friends of Mrs. Hill say that the Hills
did not get along amicably, and that the
reason she disappeared Is that she pre
ferred to live alone and in peace.
SPRING VALLEY AGREES
; . TO DISMISSAL OF SUIT
Owing to the fact that Judge Seawell
refused to iksue a preliminary injunction
restraining the city and county from en
forcing \ the new water rate the
Valley Water Company has filed a dis
missal of Its action. The dismissal was
without prejudice, however, and it is
probable that upon Judge Seawell's. re
turn to this city after vacation another
suit will be instituted by the company.
The water company's attorneys were not
certain as to what the effect would be In
the event they permitted the suit to stand
on the records and then proceeded to col
lect from consumers under the new rate.
The result was that the company decided
that it was best to dismiss the suit.
The order for dismissal bore -the signa
ture of Attorney M. B. Kellogg. Mr. Kel
logg.refused to say why the case was'dis
missed or what action the company pur
posed taking in the future, but it is a set
tled fact that the company Â¦will not. yield
to the provisions of the ordinance estab
lishing the new rate until the same has
been declared valid by. the court of. last
resort. . -. . ,

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, July 8.
James H. Bond, principal of the Sacra
mento High School, was to-night elected
principal cf the Oakland High School by
unanimous vote of the nine members pres
ent, upon the recommendation of the High
School Committee. There was a short
caucus before the open board meeting:,
during which Chairman Fred L. Button
of the High School Committee, whose
choice had been J. Fred Smith of tha
Campbell High School, made a fight for
further delay in the selection of a princi
pal to succeed J. B. McChesney. but a
majority of the board had fixed upon Mr.
Pond, and Chairman Button gave way to
the pressure and gracefully announced
that his committee would present the
name of the Sacramento educator.
Director Evans* choice had been Vice
Principal S. P. Meads of the high school,
but before the caucus was ended. Evans
evuds into line for Pond, who was given
the compliment of a unanimous selection.
Highly Recommended.
The principal-elect won because of the
h?gh recommendations which his friends
presented, and because of the success
which has attended his year's Incumbency
of tne principalshlp at Sacramento, which
has the next largest high school to Oak
land in the State.
Mr. Pond is a graduate of. the Univers
ity of California and has been in State
educational affairs ever since he graduat
ed. He is SS years of age. He is a son of

The members of the Board of Education

Robertson, who is in the Kast, and Dr.
Myra Knox, who was called out on pro
fessional duties before the caucus bad
been completed. In presenting Pond's
name to the board. Director Button made
a neat speech, extolling the new man's
ability and fitness and pointing out par
ticularly his age as a strong one jamon$
the reasons which led to bis selection.
Professor Smith who had been the choice
of a majority of'the High School Commit
tee, is 20 years the senior of the success
ful man, a fact which was argued against
him by influential members of the board.
Some Important Changes.
. The board made some important changes
to-night affecting the two high schools.
It adopted a fiat four-year course for the
Oakland High School and provided
courses of two years each in the com
mercial and in the manual training de
partment of the Central High School, the

be a popular resort, many Oakland ladies
going there for a few days .at a time, and
the association feels that the experiment
is an assured success, judging by the
number of letters /that are being daily
received asking for information in regard
to this long needed haven of rest. The
following named ladies form the Rest
Cottage committee and are taking a most
active interest in it: '"
OAKLAND. July 8.â A novel plan
by which self-supporting young
Â¦women may obtain a summer
cuting at a nominal cost has been
inaugurated by the Oakland
Tour.gr Women's Christian Association.
For several years the ladles of the as
sociation have realized and discussed the
prreat need of some place where a few
weeks' vacation could be enjoyed by â¢wo
men of limited means at a moderate cost.
As a result of these deliberations a "rest
cottage" has been established. These rest
cottapes have recently been tried in the
Kast with surprising success, but the idea
is still new to California, the Oakland Y.
W. C. A. being the first to make the ex
periment hore.
Mrs. William Kirk, first vice president
of this philanthropic organization and one
of its most active workers, was the first
lo solve the problem of ways and means
and it is mainly through her persistent
efforts that the "rest cottage" is at last
a reality.
Bituated in the midst of a charming
grove of trees on the very summit of the
hills above and beyond Piedmont, the old
I mted States silk culture station has for
several months past stood vacant and al
most abandoned. The building was erect
ed originally to aid women and children
by supplying them with work in the cul
tivation of the silkworm, but the experi
ment was a failure. Now, however, after
the lapse of many years, through the
kindness of \V. B. Ewer, president of the
Board of gilk Culture, the building is be
ing devoted to the cause for which it was
originally intendedâ that is. for the bene
iit of self-supporting women, the house
and grounds having been leased by the
Young Women's Christian Association
for a "rest cpttajre." The place has been
renovated and fitted up cozily and is now
a comfortable abode of ten large, sunny
rooms.
The view from the cottage is delightful,
Oakland, in its most picturesque aspect,

while on a clear day San Francisco is also

, Catarrh . is" a Â¦ constitutional disease â a blood disease which is frequently
inherited, and only a blood medicine, such as S. S. S., can remove the hereditary
taint, 'destroy" the poisons that have been accumulating in the system for years
perhaps, and restore the blood to a healthy and pure condition. The inflamed
Â¦ membranes and diseased glands are healed by the rich, pure blood which is carried
'to them, and the offensive discharges from the nose, and the terrible headache and
neuralgic pains cease. Chronic cases of the most desperate character and apparent-
ly hopeless, have been cured completely and permanently by the use of S. S. S. >

FIND MISSING WAGON
LOAD OF MERCHANDISE
, OAKLAND, July 8.â The police depart
ment has recovered near Rockrldge Park
a wagon" containing $300 or $400 worth of
rugs and other household goods owned
by the Chicago Clock Company. George
Darcy, residing at 811 "Union street, has
been in custody at the City Prison for
twenty-four hours because of his connec
tion with the peculiar circumstances
which attended the loss of the wagon by
David Josephs, the agent for the com
pany, who had charge of the outfit.
"Josephs, accompanied by Darcy, went
out Saturday morning for a peddling trip.
During the agent's temporary absence
Darcy drove off with the team. He got
lost In the suburbs, then started back on
horseback to find Josephs. The horse ran
away with Darcy and was picked up by
the police early yesterday morning. Last
evening Josephs and Darcy landed at the
City Jail, where the latter was detained
after the police had heard the story. This
afternoon the detectives found the horse
less wagon with its load of valuable mer
chandise half-buried in a gulch near Rock
ridge. Darcy was released from custody,
but Josephs is still puzzled about the
strange disappearance of his outfit.

CHARGES AGAINST COUNTY
HOSPITAL NOT SUSTAINED
OAKLAND, July 8.â Charges of mis
management and abuse preferred by Wil
liam Bell, a former inmate of the County
Infirmary, against the officers of that
institution are without foundation, ac
cording to the raport made on the mat
ter by SupervisorRowe at to-day's meet
ing of the board.
Bell claimed that he had been com
pelled to perform menial services and
that he had been subjected to personal
abuse until he found himself compelled
to leave the hospital.
Supervisor Rowe .examined several wit
nesses and failed to find any justifica
tion for the charges. The other inmates
of Bell's ward told Rowe that the com
plainant boasted that he had been in
eVery county infirmary in the State.

WeeMy Cal $1.00 wMsocial and business affairs. The clause
objected to by the "members' conserva
tive" party was as follows:
It shall be the duty of the board of directors
at all times promptly to carry out the wishes
and will of the society in any and all matters
pertaining to the society's social or business af
talrs. when instructed to do so by a two
thirds vote of the society at any regular or
special meeting.
According to the conservative party this
would open up the doors to the widest ex
cesses in expenditures, for with no re
strictions as to the membership present
it would be possible for a bare quorum to
vote away any sums it pleased, a condi
tion that would require every member to
be at every meeting or stand the conse
quences.
â¢ The conservatives trace the origin of
the amendment to a growing desire on
the part of many of the members to go
deeper into the Lick funds. As it is now
benefits are paid to every one who needs
them, and they are paid not in regular
amounts, but in amounts suited to the
needs of the beneficiary. No Pioneer is
ever allowed to become destitute, and even
with the strictest economy the society is
eating Into its principal at the rate of
from $8000 to $9000 a year. To Increase this
outlay in any way would be absurd, the
conservatives contended.
Would Start a Magazine.
A magazine scheme was also mixed up
in .the fight. It appears that "Willard B.
Farwell. chairman of the history commit
tee and the nominating committee and
author of the amendment, has long been
advocating the establishing of a maga-.

Pioneers held their annual
I election yesterday, and last even-
I ing around the banquet table they
Ji Installed the candidates on the
"opposition ticket," for they won
easily at the polls. And the amendment
Â¦to the constitution over which the fiercest
fight was waged was hopelessly beaten.
This peculiar situation was presented:
The regular ticket was really the opposi
tion, and the opposition was made up of
those not opposed to the policy in force
but in favor of continuing it in defiance of
the regulars, who wished to make it more
expensive and more liberal.
The successful candidates were the. fol
lowing named:
President â Walter Van Dyke; vice presidents
â James Palache and Leonard F. Rowell, San
Francisco; Timothy IÂ». Barker, Oakland;
George Hapar, Colusa; D. O. Mills, New York;
treasurerâ F. W. Tallant; Marshalâ W. L. Dun
can; Directorsâ A. R. Cotton. J. H. Jewett, H.
ft. Tilden. E. M. Root. Henry B. Russ. E. T.
Kruse. William Z. Tiffany. Allen Knight and
W. C. Glbbs.
The amendment was beaten by a vote
of 205 to 142.
Too Much -Economy.
The cry of the regulars was that there
was too much economy in the administra
tion of the affairs of the society and in
the expanditure of the hundreds of thou
sands which Lick left to the organiza
tion. It was contended that the directors
should be guided by the society in the
matter of expenditures, and the amend
ment was to compel the directors to yield
obedience to the wishes of the society in
zine, to be backed by the society and run
by himself, and it. was suspected by the
conservatives that one of the first exer
cises of power under the new amendment,
should it go through, would be to vote an
order to the directors to establish the
magazine, with Farwell at its head and a
slice of the society's funds at its back.
The fight has been a literary one, as is
shown by the numerous circulars and
pamphlets that have been sent around
among the members. Most of these have
come from the regulars, but. a few well
directed bits of paper and ink have found
the armor joints of the advocates of the
new thing. At first it was announced that
the issue was squarely on the question of
the amendment, but when the fierce oppo
sition to the amendment began to de
velop the regulars hurried to stand from
under. A scatning . circular, signed by
Judge Niles Searls and Louis Sloss,
brought forth a denial from all the regu
lar candidates cl any connection with the
amendment. It was declared that voters
might vote- on the amendment as they
pleased, as tho candidates were not
pledged on the amendment question in
any way. The denial was useless, how

The efforts of the police. to capture the

being- entered continue to be received at
police headquarters.
Yesterday morning a report was re
ceived that the office of the California
Bottling ".Company on Â¦ Kddy street, be
tween Webster . and Fillmore, had been
broken Into, between Sunday night and
yesterday morning and that the burglars
had made- themselves at home. They
drank a considerable quantity of bottled
beer and made. an unsuccessful attempt
to force open the safe. . -
Failing in their efforts on the safe, they
stole a quantity of tools and other arti
cles, besides carrying off a number of
bottles of beer. Entrance was effected by
forcing open the office door with the aid
of a "jimmy." Detectives Dlnan and

Among the Chilean products that the
Consul will give particular attention, to
are the fertilizers. Nitrates and saltpeter

introduction of a reliable fertilizer is ap

In discussing tha recent Chilean election,
in which the Llberallst party, headed by
Don Jerman Riesco, won favor in the
land, the Consul anticipates that the Lib
eralists" will do much in furthering the
industrial and social relations of Chile
with other countries, especially the United
States. He speaks in glowing terms of
the new President, Don Riesco, and char
acterizes him as a man of great ability
and capacity, leved by the people and
heartily in sympathy with all their inter

Three years ago Mr. Rei spent consid
erable time in San Francisco as a com
missioner representative of extensive
trade bodies in Chile. He succeeded in
introducing many of the South American
products in California and in building up
commercial intercourse between this State
and the southern republic to a wonderful
extent. In his efforts the Commissioner
was mainly assisted by his Government,
and the excellent results he accomplished
received- deserved recognition when he re
turned home. The Chilean fleet of steam

soon be largely increased by the addition

I Although the Federal agents who are
Investigating the theft of $30,000 in gold
coin from the cashier's vault at the Mint
are satisfied that a certain employe of
the money coining establishment is guilty
of the robbery, the absence of direct evi
dence prevents the arrest of the suspected
man.
The officials having the case In charge
yesterday employed H. J. Mag-uire, an ex
pert accountant, to go over the books of
the Mint.. While Director Roberts, Super
intendent Leach and Secret Service Agent
Hazen are positive that the missing pold
was stolen, the books are to be experted
in order to satisfy the "Washington author
ities.
For the same reason that the books are
to be experted the sold in the Mint is to
be again counted. "When the shortage of
530,000 was discovered the gold was count
ed by sacks, it being taken for granted
that each sack contained the amount of
coin called for on Its check tab. Yesterday
it was decided to open every sack of gold
in the Â¦ building and actually count the
coin by weighing.
Millions to Be Counted.
The amount of gold in the Mint vaults
is more than 547,000,000, and It will take
ten days for the counters and weighers
to tally the treasure.
In the event of any further shortage be
ing found there will be a big upheaval in
the Mint. The Secretary of the Treasury
has given strict instructions that no ef
forts be spared to secure the conviction
of therman who stole the $30,000.
The work of counting the gold In the
Mint commenced yesterday. One of the
big vaults Â¦was opened and the counting
was done in the presence of Director
Hoberts, Superintendent Leach. Coiner
Cole, Cashier Cole and other heads of
departments. Each sack was untied, the
contents was then inspected and then
placed in the gold-weighing scales. The
gold coin was then resacked and sealed.
During the day $600,000 passed through
the hands of the counters and weighers.
Chief Clerk IMmmick was at his desk
yesterday, though "William Day was in
charge of the department. "With reference
to certain accusations made against him,
Dimmick declined to make any statement.
Will Talk at th.e Proper Time.
"When the time comes and before the
proper authorities," he said, "I will an
swer all questions put to me and make all
requisite explanations. I have decided
that I Will not talk any more at the pres
ent time."
It is positively stated that Dlmmlck
opened the pay envelopes of Mint em
ployes and used the money when he was
cashier. The matter only came to light,
however, three months a?o, and then Su
perintendent Leach notified Â»Dimmick that
he must seek another position. Other al
leged questionable transactions by Dim
mick are coming to light, and he does not
attempt to explain them away.
One of the Mint employes who is known
to have played the races steadily is also
being watched by the secret service men.
The man is no: employed in the cashier's
office. Investigation shows that he has
lost three times the amount of his salary
in the past year, and the natural question
arises as to how he managed to secure
funds.
When the count of the gold in the Mint
is finished Director Roberts will call upon
Superintendent ! Leach and Cashier Cole,
through their tondsmen, to make good
the deficit. . Â¦"

Los Angeles Is ! no longer to have a

the most adroit politicians in the State
have banded together to Incorporate a
town within the bucolic confines of Mill
Valley, and their main purpose Is to ma
nipulate State politics with a view of dic
tating to future State conventions.
The coterie includes such old-time war
horses as Eddie Conroy. Senator Jack
Tyrrell, Major Harney, the general au
thority on wharf tolls, who has made a
6tudy of water front statistics and loves
to dilate on the difference between the
harbors of San Francisco and Liverpool;
Captain Bingham, the ex-Supervisor; ex-
Senator Bibb, the author of the cele
brated Marchand plural, and ex-School
Director Ed Head.
When these wise men get together to
manipulate State politics there will be
something doing. They purpose incorpor
ating a town and handling all the jobs.
Bibb wants to be Mayor, but Tyrrell ob
jects on the ground that the lumber mer
chant became a reformer atter deserting
his old constituents south of the slot. He
quotes Captain Crow of Ninth street to
the effect that Bibb "won't" stay put."
Tjrrell is for Head for Mayor and Major
Harney for Harbor Commissioner. The
embryotic town has no harbor, but Tyr
rell expects to get a bill through the next
Legislature extending a slough up to Har
ney's front porch.
Colonel A. A. Andrews Is also anxious
to become Mayor, but he is not in the
race on account of being a non-resident.
There will be no Palace Hotel erected at
Mill Valley in the near future, but a
handsome weighing scale has been placed
in the center of the town, and the poli
ticians hope in this way to woo Manager
Vining of the Market-street Railway
Company to discontinue his visits to the
Palace Hotel every day and weigh him
self in Mill Valley.
The "Banjo-eyed Kid" is going over to
Mill Valley, and it is rumored that he has
already applied for a permit to conduct
a. poolroom. Senator Tyrrell has divided
the town into districts and his efforts are
crowned with success in having one dis
trict already solid for anybody he may
designate.

from here to Cincinnati, <0., in the trunk.
He requested Sellingor to send the trunk

Bellinger why it had not been sent Sell
inger replied that he had given It to an

The matter was reported to Captain

SeUinger and others," said the captain.

Ewing is married to a daughter of the
late Senator Mahoney. For a time he fol
lowed the racetrack and then blossomed
out as a "capitalist." Chaney was for
merly a court stenographer in Chicago
and came to this city last year. Nothing
is known in this city of any of the men
whom Ewing and Chaney claimed were
associated with them in the alleged com
pany. It is expected that warrants will
be issued for the arrest of Ewing and
Chaney, as some of their dupes yesterday
declared that they would seek to- have
the two men punished.
Warrants May Be Issued.
Dozens of the dupes of Ewing and
Chaney visited the offices yesterday in
the vain hope that, they might secure
part of the money they had been swin
dled out of. Only two of the lady type
writers were in the office, and they ad
mitted that E~wing and Chaney had not
been in the place since last Friday. One
desk and one chair alone remained of all
the handsome furniture installed by Ew
ing and Chaney to dazzle investors. The
lady assistants said their salaries had
been paid until the end of this month, but
declined to give any further information.
When Ewing and Chaney realized that
their company was under suspicion they
prepared to leave the city. Last Friday
the two men disappeared and their
whereabouts is unknown. Some of their
creditors and dupes tried yesterday to at
tach the handsome furniture in the offices
used by Ewing and Chaney in the Parrott
building They learned, however, that
the furniture had been mortgaged last
week and yesterday afternoon it was re
moved from the offices.
Ewing would not be flattered if he were
cognizant of the opinion of him held by
Senator Morehouse and his legal associ
ates. Morehouse has endeavored to- collect
a bill from Ewing for a large sum, but
has failed.
Ewln- was warned that his business was
fraudulent and that unless he mended his
ways trouble would surely come to him.
He promised to raise $75,000 from the di
rectors of the company and do business
as a banking corporation. -Senator More
house -was quoted as > being the legal ad
viser of Ewing.
Promised to Baise Some Money.
Ewing claimed to would-be investors
that $2,500',000 in cash was deposited in the
First National Bank, the Germania Trust
Companv and the Western National
Bank. When asked how his company ex
pected to make money he replied that a
small commission on transactions was the
profit for his organization.
Hundreds of remittances were received
by Ewing and Chaney from all parts of
the country, most of the money coming
from bank cashiers, to whom the gaudy
circulars of the "Standard Oil Promotion
and Investment Company" had been sent
by mail.
Ewing was questioned last week as to
his methods of conducting business and
he denied that he had informed would-be
investors that he had two and half mill
ions in cash as capital. He claimed that the
officers of the company had subscribed
$12,500, but that all the money had been
expended in office expenses and advertis
ing.
As a matter of fact, Ewing and Chaney
had no capital in bank and were engaged
in "grafting." Ewing admitted some days
ago that he and his partners had secured
$15,000 from the public and that they only
had a few hundred dollars as capital to
secure investors against loss.
George B.Chaney and William B. Ew
ing, promoters of a bogus oil and invest
ment company, have suddenly left, the
city, after duplng'a large number of peo
ple out of .sums ranging from $25 to $500.
It is estimated that the two men have
succeeded in swindling the public out of
$15,000 to J20.000 by one of the neatest
bunko games ever perpetrated in this city.
The name of the alleged company pro
moted by Chaney and Ewing was "The
Standard Oil Promotion and Investment
Company." Large offices were rented in
the Parrott building and expensive fur-
; niture installed therein. Six lady type
writers were kept busy sending elaborate
ly prepared circulars all over' the coun
try, and flaring advertisements were In
serted in many country newspapers.
According to statements made by Ew
ing before he fled from the city his com
pany was incorporated with a capital
stock of $5,000,000. Of this sum one-half
was allotted as "promotion stock" among
the "officers."
When asked for the names of the of
ficers Ewing explained that the president
was "Luther J. Kobling of the United
Kruit Company, located at Boca del Toro.
republic ot Colombia." George B. Chaney
was listed as vice president of the com
pany W. B. Ewing was treasurer and
secretary; J. F. Chambers, general de
livery, Chicago, 111., and B. H. Lununis
of the Gale-Borden Condensed Milk Com
pany of New York were directors.
Claimed Capital of Millions.
The circulars "sent out by Ewing and
Chaney told how the company was en
gaged in "investment of money in oil
lands and oil stocks." No claim was
made that the company owned any oil
wells; its business was "to buy stock
when it -was cheap and sell out when it
rose on the market." The stock pur
chased 'by Ewing and Chaney consisted
mostly of "wildcat" shares of companies
promoted by men of their own caliber.
To prospective investors Ewing and
Chaney would tell a glib story of a cap
ital in bank of $2,500,000. Investors were
given contracts which stipulated that at
t-he end of ninety days their money would
be returned on a. call of thirty days.
