W., WASHIXGTOX, Aug. 22.â Secretary
of State Hay returned from Canton to-day
with the satisfaction of knowing 1 , as a re
sult of his t conference with the President,
that McKinley fully approves every step
that has been taken by the State and
Navy departments in relation to the un
settled condition of affairs In Colombia
and the surrounding: country. As a result
of this Presidential approval there will be
no change In the policy that has been pur
eued. The task of the administration is a
very difficult one. largely owing to the dis
position of the governments of South and
Central America to resent any advice
from Washington, even when tendered in
the most friendly spirit. They all want
the United States to enforce the Monroe
doctrine, but any Intervention by this Gov
ernment in their Quarrels among them
selves is likely to lead to jealousies and
misconstruction unless the matter Is han
dled with the utmost delicacy.
ETay Avoids Eesentment. "'
Hay has thus far been able to avoid ar
raying any resentment en the part of any
one of the governments Involved In the
present difficulty. His tactful policy is to
be continued. American warships are on
their way to preserve the freedom of com
munication across the Isthmus, to protect
American interests and to serve as a
standing notice to European governments
that they must keep hands off.

On the arrival of the writ of supersedeas from

When the defendants made a demand that
the receiver give a bond, of $100,000 on each
claim I consented, with the understanding that
the property pay the high premium for thÂ«
bond.' which the.y declined to do. After various
phases of litigation a writ of supersedes was
received from the Circuit Court of Appeals. I
consider that I compiled with , It absolutely.
Contention, however, has been, made that t
issued an order directing- the Marshal not to
permit the ' defendants to take possession of
the gold which had been extracted from the
claims in dispute. This Is positively without
foundation.' Kever. by word, act or deed, did

Duty of the Receiver.
Soon after my arrival at Nome the necessity
of immediately appointing receivers , of th*
Anvil Creek claims was urged and pressed upon
me. The appointment was flrst tendered to
James Matthews, but he was going to the out
side and did not care to take hold. I wm
practically unacquainted In the new region and
naturally desired a mail In whom I had con
fidence. By reason of my long acquaintance
ship with Alexander McKenzie and the re
sponsible positions which he had previously
held I requested him to take the position. R>
consented. I believed that the receivership
would be temporary. By reason of the difficul
ties to Immediately procure a large bond 1 1
fixed the sum in a small amount, with ths
idea, of enlarging later If deemed advisable,
which was done. . I directed that most of thÂ«Â»
old employes of the company that operated the
claims be retained and that the property te
worked with expedition and economy. I fur
ther made an order as soon as the defendants
requested It that all the gold extracted from
the claims be. placed in safe deposit vaults, al
lowing them to be at the "clean-ups" and tha
privilege of weighing all gold.
Â¦With thÂ« other officials I exnected to leava
Seattle about July 1 on the United States reve

thereon It transpired that McKenzie had pre
viously secured passage on the same boat. Mr.
Chippa was also a passenger. I never knew
of him beyond a passing Introduction or of hH
having any litigation In the Alaska courts. I
had known Mr. McKenzie oemonally for stx

connection with an Alaska mining company.
However. I did not know who were In Inter

Longshoremen "Will Handle the Lum-
OAKLAND, Aug. 22.-The strike . situa
tion has been eased up: greatly upon this
side of the bay. by v the decision of the
Longshoremen's Union of Alameda Coun
ty that they will handle lumber after; It
has been placed upon the dock, no matter
whether it was placed there by union;or
non-union labor. This action â¢ of one of
the strongest unions in Alameda County
was taken In order that the building
trades might not be embarrassed.
The union held a meeting this morning
and after "a very short discussion of the
situation the members decided . that they
would not inquire as to. how lumber got
upon the wharf as long as they were not
required to work with .non-union hands.
This is a great break -in the sympathetic
strike on. this side of the bay, for. it has
been. the general decision of the unions
that they would not handle any material
that had once ' passed through i non-union
hands. This will probably enable all the
shipping on the Oakland water ; front to
resume â¢ operations,.- for men can be ; had
that .will unload the vessels if the .lumber
and : cargoes can be handled after they,
are deposited upon the wharf. 'A number
of " owners of' vessels have â¢ been able to

President Casey of the Brotherhood cf
Teamsters Â¦ Wednesday evening purely by
accident, and the fact that they discussed
the strike In a friendly way furnished the
basis for the report that a settlement was
being arranged.
"There can be a settlement of this trou

Captain Hall of the South Portland said
yesterday that his ship would be ready

he had six men in the crew that would

four Japanese whom he had brought down
from Seattle and two union men that had
joined his ship here. Â¦
There Is a war on at Port Costa be
tween the stevedore firms that have con
tracts to load the vessels. The war Is
the direct, result of. the strike and is due
to the failure of some of. the contractors
to get men to load the ships. The. grain
merchants want their vessels loaded and
have not hesitated to make new contracts
with men who can get enough hand3 to
do the work. McAllister & Co. lost two
vessels because ! they failed"' to get men
to handle the cargoes. Woodslde & Co.
agreed to load the vessels and yesterday

dressed his men at . the Central
Police Station yesterday , morning. The
guardians of the peace were preparing to
go to their respective stations when Cap
tain Wittman, who had just finished read
ing the decision of Judge Cabaniss in the
case of Police Officer Knight, proceeded to
address them. Â¦ .Â¦ , ,. .
"This . department has always been
friendly with Cabanlss," he declared.' "I
know a number of officers who spent their
money* to help secure his election. As
the reward he now turns on the very men
who helped him and convicts one of. the
number for trying to do his duty.",
Captain Wittman then asked his men to
remain cool on even the most trying oc
casions, but to use their clubs when they
found It necessary. He also assured them
that the Chief, of 'Police would uphold
their acts under, such circumstances. . . :

STRIKE SYMPATHIZERS
I ATTACK RAILROAD HANDS
Discover That They Made a Mistake
'After They Have Roughly
Handled the Men! .
; 22.-An omnibus
crowded: with negroesâ forty-two In num
berâcreated - a great deal of excitement
to-night on its Journey from the Balti
more and 'Ohio station to the Buffalo.
Rochester and Pittsburg station In Alle
gheny. Shortly after the trip was begun
between the stations the report was start
ed that the men were strike breakers and
a large crowd followed them, jeering and
hooting. A stop was made on Smithfield
street for some reason or other and four
of the negroes alighted. Before they
could get- back the vehicle started and
the men .had to walk across the bridge.
A crowd of probably 200 men followed
them on to the structure and when about
midway across made an assault on the
four men. The negroes were rather
roughly handled, but none were seriously
hurt. Later it was learned that tho
negroes were being shipped to Clearfltld,
Pa., from Elkins, W. Va., to do some rail
road work and were in no way implicated
as strike breakers. They were finally put
aboard their train.
In justice to the strikers themselves It
can be said that they were not mixed up
in the affair, the attacking crowd being
composed entirely of ruffians.

Building Trades Council Denies a
Published Report.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades Council, issued a statement
last night, upon approval of the council,
in denial of the published report from
Oakland /that the lumbermen would re
fuse'to supply lumber to the mills that
acceded to the demands of the Building
Trades Council. Following is the state
ment in part: ;>Â¦ .
Â¦ For some -time past strenuous efforts have
been made by tome parties with: a view to In
volving the building/industry In the contro
versy now waging between the miscellaneous
trades and the employers of this city. In no
case, however, has it been more flagrant than
In that put forward by Mr. Kendall of Oak
land, as published In the Examiner of the
21st and 22d. The Building Trades Council
is deslrous.of repudiating any such statement.
It has had its controversy with the mill own
ers, which was settled by a board of arbitra
tion made up of some of the best men In' the
city and county, and the statement made In
the Examiner to the effect that the mill owners
were given by the Building Trades Council six
months within which to unionize is, to say
the. least, very . misleading and Is done pre
sumably with a view to bring- about a doubt
In the minds of the business men, as also the
workers themselves, to the end Â¦ that trouble
be brought about at any cost. This the Build-
Ing Trades Council will not tolerate. It Is
now and has been for some time at peace and
in harmony with those whom Mr. Kendall
would like to have us believe are negotiating
for a fight. â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢- . .Â» â Â¦ -
It muet be -remembered that the Mill Owners'
Association of Alameda meets regularly every
Tuesday night, and that being the cafia it flatly
contradicts the statements made in . the press
that it met on 'Tuesday night for the purpose
of discussing the proposed boycott and also
that a meeting was to be held in San Fran
cisco next week, at which time this question
was to be settled finally.
No such meeting was ever contemplated by
anybody, unless it be Mr. Kendall and his press
correspondent, and the best proof of that is
that no man doing business in the building or
lumber Industry knows anything about It. and
if the press agent was looking for reliable In
formation he would not have gone" to Oakland
to get it, because all the matters concerning
this controversy have been carried on in San
Francisco and all great Interests therein have
their headquarters here, hence it is apparent
that those whose names have been linked with
this latest labor scare were not sincere.
CZARINA IS DISCHARGED.
Point to the Fact That Vessels Are
Running as Usual.
Many of the steamship managers claim
that as far as they are concerned the
strike is over with. In support of their
claims they point to the fact that their
\essels are. running and that they, arrive
hefe'and leave with' full creWB.'- '
Captain Goodall of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company said In discussing
the situation yesterday: ssi >.,
"We have .ISO men! working on the wharf
and from these we can select enough sail
ors and firemen to ? keep bur vessels run
ning. We are' fully equipped, particularly
for Â»the sound steamers. The Walla
Walla, the Umatilla and the Puebla are
running steadily. The Pomona, which
runs between here and Eureka, makes her
trips and so do the vessels that we have
on the. run between this port and Santa
Cruz and the ships that go from, here to
San Diego and return are making their
regular trips.
"The men who are working for us now
will remain in our employ after this dif
ficulty is settled, no matter how it may
end.. They are giving us entire satisfaction
and we will grade them according to their
merits. We were agreeably surprised at
the ease with which we obtained flreroom
help. We were handicapped, of course,
the first few days of the strike, but are
now perfectly satisfied with the turn af
fairs have taken. Under ordinary cir
cumstances we employ 170 firemen. We
now have 140 and they are doing the
work."
WILL CHARGE DEMURRAGE.
Southern Pacific Serves Notice on the
Draymen.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
notified the members of the Draymen's
Association yesterday that commencing
to-day the company would charge demur
rage on all freight not removed from cars
within forty^eight hours after the arrival
of the train. The demurrage rate Is 15
cents per ton per day.
Secretary Renner of the association said
yesterday that he had communicated with
Scott R. Chappel, local freight agent of
the Southern . Pacific, and requested him
to rescind the order, and that he expected
that his request would be granted. Under
ordinary circumstances the draymen have
to pay the demurrage, but under the
present conditions the . charge would be
collected from the firms to which the
freight Is consigned. -
MANAGERS CLAIM: VICTORY.
THE developments In Iron trades
circles . yesterday were somewhat
Interesting. . Five of the imolders
who went back to the Union Iron
Works on Monday failed to ap
pear yesterday morning, greatly to the
satisfaction of the union pickets about
the works. Two of these . were ,. enticed
away by strikers. During the day infor
mation was received by the Union Iron
Works management that two of the men
were besieged at their homes- at an ; early
hour by strikers, who did not leave- their
posts until nearly 9 o'clock. The men
were afraid to leave their homes in. the
face of overwhelming odds, and rather
than take chances they remained within
doors.
Another man who failed to appear at
the works sent word that he was in his
bed suffering from a number of more or
less serious contusions about the face and
body. He reported that while on his way
to the works he was assaulted by sev
eral men and badly beaten. He was well
nigh beaten into a state of insensibility
and when he recovered his assailants had
fled. He thereupon returned to his home,
where he will remain for several days
under cover. He states that he will re
turn to work as soon as he is able to do
SO. - Â¦:..-
t President Henry T.. Scott of the Union
Iron Works said yesterday that ten new
men applied for and were given work at
the works during the morning. These
men were distributed throughout the var
ious departments of the works. All of
them, he said, were old employes, but he
was unwilling to vouch for their being
union men. In discussing the situation
Mr. Scott said: -
We lost five men to-day and gained
ten, making a net gain to the works of
five men. Two of the molders were un
able to appear at the works this morning,
owing to the fact that their houses were
surrounded with men whose threatening
manner filled the molders with alarm. The
besiegers guarded the premises until
nearly 9 o'clock, and then departed. In
formation of the occurrence was tele
phoned to us iater In the day. j Notwith
standing the denials of the strike leaders,
our working.force is growing every -day."
Inquiry at; the Risdon Iron Works de
veloped- the information that three ma
chinists '.went to work in that establish
ment yesterday. It is claimed these men
belong to the machinists' union, but the
union pickets deny this vehemently.
The management of the Risdon Iron
Works declares that there were numerous
applications by molders for employment
during the week, but there being no-va
cancies the applications were necessarily
denied. The men were sent to other-es
tablishments, however, and all are now at
work. !

will submit to you and. we can recommend
It to the board for adoption." Â¦
The resolution Reed referred to" was a 1
criticism of the act of the president of
the Police Commission, though he stated
that it was not Intended as such.
The secretary, read the resolution and
Tobin agreed to recommend it to the
Board of Supervisors provided certain
features, which savored too strongly of
condemnation of the police, were stricken
out Supervisor Reed agreed to obliterate
the objectionable paragraphs, and the res
olution as changed was adopted.
Criticism for Newhall.
It reads as follows:
"Whereas. The business of San Francisco Is
paralysed by an extensive BtrlHe. which threat
ens to Dennanently Impair the city's prosper
ity, and in the progress of which the president
of the Police Commission in his capacity of
president of the Chamber of Commerce has
seen fit to stigmatize the condition of the city
as riotous and has called upon the Mayor to
Issue a proclamation ordering the people to be
peaceful, and also asking him If necessary to
call upen the Governor of the State for mili
tary aid in maintaining:, law and order In the
i municipality i and whereas, the police force of
the city has been Increased by the sudden ap
pointment of special policemen; whereas, the
condition of the city Is -one of peace and quiet
and the conduct of the laboring men who are
j on a strike has been characterized in the main
by sobriety and order and reflects credit upon
their good citizenship; and whereas, the letter
of the president of the Board of Police Com
missioners containing the said statement is not
warranted by the facts and has been charac
terized by the Mayor as unwise and unneces
sary; and whereas, the appointment of the said
special police is regarded by large numbers of
our citizens as reckless and unjustified and
exasperates them to the point of believing
that the Police Department is aiding one party
to the labor conflict, the Employers' Associa
tion, at the expense of the other party, the
Â¦wag-e-earners; now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
the city and county of San Francisco condemns
the intemperate lansruage of President < New
hal! of the Police Commission and declares
that the conduct of the striking wage-earners
has been In the main highly creditable to their
citizenship; that. with, nearly 20,000 men on a
strike it is not to be expected that some dis
turbances of the peace should not occur, but
that no occasion exists for proclamation by
the Mayor or for the calling out of the mili
tary by the Governor; and be it further
I Resolved, That the character and qualifica
tions of special police officers should' be scru
pulously inquired Into before, appointment;
that they should be required to wear uniforms
and should be ; under the special and continu
ous supervision of the regular police; and be ,
It further Â¦-
Resolved. That the Police Department should
preserve absolute Impartiality between the par
ties of the present labor controversy; that the
â¢wage-earners and employes are equally en
titled to the service of the police and that the
functions of the police should be strictly con
fined to maintaining the peace and they should
not directly or indirectly give aid or assistance
to either of the parties "to the labor contro
versy.
. PITTSBURG-. Aug. 22.â Aside- from the
palatial equipment of the Star Tin-Plate
mill of the American Tln-Plate Company
and the preparation for its immediate re
sumption of business there were ' no spe
cial developments in the strike situation
in this vicinity to-day. No further trouble
occurred at the Pennsylvania Tube * Works
and at all other strike points quiet reigns.
The Amalgamated people'point with pride
to' their members' conduct In restraining
themselves from violence when they see
non-unionists being marched into the mills
to take their places. The incident at the
Star plant this morning 13 given as an ex
ample-of special significance, and, to use
an Amalgamated official's expression,
shows that the men have been educated to
the knowledge. that their strongest weap
on in such cases Is silence and submission
until it is demonstrated that the mills
cannot be operated successfully without
the aid of the skilled men now on strike.
The steel men, on the-Â»other hand, are
highly pleased with their success in man
ning the Star plant and say that If the
men they secure are not molested it will
be but a short time until. all other mills
will be in fullf operation and doing good
work.; v / .
While the strikers assert that four of the
new men at the Star plant have deserted
the company and say that others would
leave if they could get out of the mill,
Superintendent Harper maintains that he
has 100 men at work. .that none has de
serted and that the men can go and come
from the mill as they please.
The Painter mill has 250 men at work
and the management expects to ba run
ning fullhanded by next week. Two mills
are being operated . at the Lindsay &
McCutcheon plant, one of the 10-inch
mills. No sign of a break in the Carnegie
upper and lower union plants made Us
appearance to-day. McKeesport- is still
completely tied up, but an attempt may
be made to start the" Demmler tin wqrks
to-night with men secured from outside
points. The strikers are still vigilant as
pickets, but are keeping quiet and making
no threats, i ' â¢ : . â¢ -
At Irondale the tin plate company
gained another victory to-day by the suc
cessful start of one set of rolls. There
are said to be enough men in the plant
. to man one mill one turn and the com
pany officials say that, now the break has
been made, they will get the men back.
A delegation of strikers from Wellsville
went to Irondale to-night with the inten
tion of having a talk with the men at
work and persuading them to quit.
At Amalgamated headquarters In this
city the day was devoted almost entirely
to routine business and nothing of un
usual importance, occurred. President
Shaffer said to-night that no movement
has yet been made by either side looking
to arbitration or mediation. There was,
however, a tendency among many of the
labor leaders to-day to discuss the pos
sibility of arbitration and on every Bide
was heard mentioned the name of Gov
ernor W. A. Stone as an arbitrator or con
ciliator and it, is said he will be asked to
tender his good offices in this direction.
Believe That Mills Cannot
Be Operated Without
; Skilled Labor.
The police committee of the Board of Supervisors failed to agree yesterday upon Reed's pro
posed ordinance compelling special police officers, to wear uniforms, bnt resolutions condemning Police
Commissioner Kewhall for the Chamber of Commerce letter to the Mayor -were recommended .to the
Supervisors for passage. Five moldera deserted tlie Union Iron Works and ten additional mechanics
applied for and were Riven work. Tbree more machinists joined the force at the Risdon Iron Works.

SUPERVISORS' POLICE COMMITTEE
PREPARES CENSURE FOR NEWHALL
Reed's Proposed Ordinance Relating to Uniforming of Special Po-
licemen Is Not Passed UponâStrike Situation Shows Little
Change and Day's Additions to the* Working Force Are Small
Reed, at this ;uncture, pulled a document
from his pocket and turning- to Tobin
said: .
"We can at least introduce a resolution.
That is within our Jurisdiction. I have a
document here I have prepared, which I
Chairman Tobin then spoke in defense
of the police.
"Personally," he said, "I think they
have, individually, exercised gTeat dis
cretion. This is a difficult matter to deal
with and the Police Department is sup
posed to be thoroughly conversant with
the affair." -i " * .
Tobin Defends Police.
"This strike would not have lasted three
days had not the officers been placed
there. The drivers who took our places
were as a rule strangers to the city and
did not know the location of any of the
places to which they were to deliver loads.
The police, however, directed them and
in many cases have helped the drivers un
load their drays. We have presented all
these facts to the Mayor and have offered
to furnish the names of the officers whom
our pickets have seen helping the drivers,
but we have received no satisfaction. All
we want is fair play and we will guar
antee that there will be no trouble."
"No, there Is no need of the presence
of a policeman on the trucks. It only
serves to provoke the men whose places
the drivers of (.he trucks have taken. The
display of force causes the men to lose
their tempers, and though we are satis
lied that we can prevent any/ infractions
of the law, we do not feel that we want
to be ' held responsible for deeds which
intimidation provokes."
Michael Casey, president of the City
Front Federation, protested against the
presence of police officers on the trucks
driven by non-union drivers. Casey said:
"The employers seem to have the en
tire power of the Police Department at
their disposal. The bringing into the labor
controversy of the special policemen is
one of the moves that is used frequently
by employers in the event of a strike. .At
critical periods they are brought In to In
cite riot and thus make an excuse for the
calling out of the militia. This strike has
been an orderly one. in fact never before
in the history cf a strike of such propor
tions has such order been maintained. If
the Board of Supervisors will pass a reso
lution condemning the letter of Police
Commissioner JCewhall it will sooth the
minds of the people, and make known the
fact that the city is not a scene of riot
and in need of the presence of the sol
diery."
Rosenberg was followed by Walter Mac
arthur, who also spoke of the efforts
made by the leaders ofcthe labor organi
zations to preserve peace. In reply to a
question put to him by Chairman Tobin,
Macarthur said: s
Specials Cause Riots.
"We believe that the working people of
this city have been unjustly treated. We
sought redress from the Mayor and failed
to get it and we now come before the
Board of Supervisors. The entire police
force has been thrown on the side of the
employers and we appeal to the board for
an expression cf opinion on the line that
is being followed. We make the request
to help us preserve peace. There are
more than 20,000 people idle in this city
to-day and the police by injudicious acts
can easily create riot. We hold that the
police in many Instances have over-
Etepped the bounds.
Ordinance Under Discussion.
Before the matter was entirely dis
missed Reed said:
"Why should special. police officers have
greater freedom than the regular officers?
The latter is heavily fined if he appears on
duty attired in other than the uniform
prescribed by police regulations. The spe
cials, though hired by private parties, are
amenable to the same regulations, which
provide that a uniform shall be worn."
"There are a great many specials,"
Tobin responded, "who do not wear uni
forms."
In further support of his ordinance. Su
pervisor Reed said:
"Uniforms would add "greatly to the ef
ficiency of these men. These officers were
appointed in such large numbers that
Chief Sullivan, to whom the matter of
making Inquiries as to their character
was referred, had no opportunity to Judge
of their fitness. A man in private clothes
going among strikers acts as an irritant.
/To see a man with no badge of authority
Â¦wielding police power raises them to a
pitch of high indignation and acts as an
incentive to further irritation. There are
now as many specials on duty as there
are regulars."
Chairman Tobin in response to Reed's
talk said:
"I do not believe that we can pass such
an ordinance. We got into trouble once
by interfering with the Board of Educa
tion and 1 think the passage of the ordi
nance we are discussing would be inter
fering with the Police Commissioners."
Secretary Rosenberg of the Labor Coun
cil then 'addressed the members of the
committee. He said: ; â¢
SUPERVISOR REED'S ordinance
decreeing that the recently ap
pointed special policemen be com
pelled to -wear uniforms -while on
duty, which was referred to the
Health and Police Committee of the board
by the Supervisors August 19. was under
discussion at the meeting of the commit
tee yesterday. On account of the absence
of Supervisor Stafford action on the ordi
nance was deferred, though the entire aft
ernoon was spent by Supervisors Tobin
and Reed and representatives of the labor
unions in discussing its merits. Super
visor Tobin was not in favor of the ordi
nance, contending that In his opinion the
passage of such a' law by the Supervisors
would be an infringement upon the power
granted the Police Commissioners by the
charter. He said he preferred to hear
from the Police Department before ven
turing to place his approval or dlsapj
proval on the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Newhall and Chief of
Police Sullivan had been notified that
their presence was desired at the meeting,
but neither of them put in an appearance,
and as the members of the committee
were divided on the subject, Tobin sug
gested that the matter be laid over until
the presence of Supervisor Stafford couia
be secured. 2, _ ,.
J. T. Burke, for the Market Street Rail
road Company, asked that in case the or
dinance be approved an exception be made
of the forty or more special policemen in
the service of that company.
"It would humiliate these men, said
Mr. Burke, "to wear a special s uniform.
"Do you mean to say. Mr. Burke, that
the man employed by your company Is a
higher dignitary than the employe of. the
city?" asked Reed.
"I certainly do," said Burke.
"Well," answered Reed, "I do not agree
Â¦with you. I think there is nothing higher
than employment by this city, and there
is no humiliation connected with the
wearing of a uniform showing that a man
is on the payroll of the municipality."

Final Summons Comes Suddenly to
the Rev. W. M. Leftwich of
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22.â Rev. W. M.
Leftwich, who was appointed pastor ' of
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, dropped . dead yesterday at', the
parsonage. He had beer* apparently in
the best of health and his death, which
was due to a stroke of apoplexy, was a
great shock to his friends and parishion
ers.
Dr. Leftwich was transferred to this
city from the Northwest Texas confer
ence, having been stationed at El Paso.
His old home was Nashville, Tenn., and
his body will be shipped to that city. He
left three children, all of whom are
grown. - . . .

about $3000 and the insurance Is $1200.
It is not known how the flre started.
The charred body of the child was recov

There Is no' doubt as to the genuine
ness of this confession, for every detail
is entered . into, and Stone says he will
go back to Kansas and point out the
graves of the murderers. The. men never
claimed the reward offered by the Hon.
A. M. York, brother of the deceased.
Stone, who is about 70 years of age, said
he desired to clear up the mystery and
set the minds of the people at rest be
fore he died, and therefore consented to
make the confession.
A. Y. Smith, a resident of this county,
who worked with a detective agency in
Kansas at that time, corroborates the
story of Stone, He came to Oregon
about the same time Stone did.

No doubt remaining ~ as to the guilt of

clump of trees on the bank of a creek
three-qaarters of a mile from the tavern
and the entire family, â¢- consisting of
Bender and his wife, son and daughter,
Kate and John, were lynched. The
bodies were buried in sand at the bottom

small lake.
The twelve men, according to Stone,

is the first authentic account of the Wil

the older boat won by two minutes and
five seconds and on elapsed time by one
minute and thirty-nine seconds. But the
figures do .not represent' the decisiveness
of the Columbia's victory, for, as a mat
ter of fact, she beat the new boat twice.
The first time around the triangle of four
teen and three-fourths miles the Columbia
gained over five minutes. 'Then a shift of
wind on the Bhort leg across the sound
put the Constitution on even terms, when
a new race was practically started; the
breeze now coming true again. This time
the Columbia gained over a/ minute and a

ditions which have heretofore always fa
vored the Constitution. The new boat
did not seem to have any of the speed she
has shown In light airs. She was slug
gish on the starting line,- and although
the two yachts crossed almost at the same
minute with a one-gun start, the Co
lumbia romped off and took a lead of an
eighth of a mile while the Constitution
was gathering way. To be sure the Con
stitution was trying a new mainsail. and
it set very badly during the first round,
but it kept setting- better and better and
for the last fifteen miles of the course
was drawing very- well. Then, too the
club topsail was almost useless In the

this does not account., for .her defeat

May Go Over the Cup Course.
After the yacht's anchor was down Sir
Thomas told the reporters that the Sham
rock would go* out for a long trial spin
to-morrow, extending down to Sandy
Hook, and perhaps, if there was clear
weather and a good breeze, she might try
to cover the America's cup course outside
the Hook of fifteen miles to windward
and back.
Sir Thomas, with a party of guests, will
go to Oyster Bay in the Erin on Saturday
to witness the races between the Consti
tution and the Columbia on Long Island
Sound under the management of the See
wanhaka-Corlnthian Yacht Club, whose
guest he will be at dinner that night.
The Shamrock will anchor at Sandy
Hook .after her trial to-morrow and will
not>come to ' New York again until it is
time to be measured and docked for the
cup race.
The yacht is so perfectly balanced "on
the wind" that she carries neither lee nor
weather helm, her long tiller being exact
ly amidships.
During the eight or ten tacks she made
to fetch, from her anchorage to the buoy
at the junction of the swash and main
ship channel, where she turned back, the
average time from "full to full" in stays
Â¦was about seventeen seconds. It was
plain, however, that Captain Sycamore
was not putting her through her , best
paces in that direction. The crew trimmed
and handled the sails with that smartness
and precision that shows experience and
a thorough knowledge of their Ehip.
The trial was all in smooth water, ex
cept during the last mile of the windward
work, when she passed out by Coney Isl
and Point. There a slight easterly swell
made her pitch a little, but not enough to
stop headway to any extent. She makes
very little wash under her lee bow and
carries hardly any quartering wave. Her
wake is clean and smooth from observa
tions taken from directly astern while
she was close hauled, her sails trim very
flat and she is able to He within four
points of the wind with every sail full.
Many thought her "pointing"' was fuily
as close as that of the Herreshoff boats,
but that remains to be seen.
Yacht Is Perfectly Balanced.
covered the distance In fifty-seven min
utes and the reach back of six miles In
forty minutes. The wind was fresh and
fairly steady from about south by east
and of from ten to twelve knots' strength.
The yacht carried mainsail, working top
sail, "forestay sail and jib.
At times while on the wind she put her
lee rail under a trifle, but she showed her
self well able to carry her sail and she
appeared to be quite as stiff as either
the Constitution or the Columbia. Her
sails set remarkably well for the first
time out. The mainsail, a splendid piece
of duck with narrow cloths and wide
seams and of the cross-cross pattern, was
set for the first time to-day. It fitted to
perfection with the exception of a slight
looseness in the leach, â¢ which can be
remedied by inserting three batters, for
which pockets are already supplied. The
hcadsails set well, as did the jibheaded
topsail which she carried.

NEW TOEK, Aug. 22.â Sir Thomas Up
ton's new challenger, the Shamrock II,
had her first trial spin in New York
Lower Bay to-day, and although it lasted
only ninety minutes, it was a most satis
factory performance from start to finish.
Sir Thomas and Designer George L.

yacht during her trial, expressed them
selves as perfectly satisfied Â¦with the re

Some Significant Acts.
LONDON, Aug. 23.â "It is believed
ta official circles in Constanti
nople," says a dispatch from the
Turkish capital, "that the Sultan
will accord full satisfaction to M.
Constans without coercion on the part of
France and that the incident will have
ended within forty-eight hours."
PARIS, Aug. 22.â According to the For
eign Office officials this afternoon there is
no news and no change in the situation
of the Turkish Imbroglio. This, however,
Â¦was noticeable â the officials were more re-
Alcent than yesterday. While reassert
ing that no naval demonstration is con
templated, they refuse to confirm or deny
the truth of the news contained in spe
cial dispatches, Baying that three battle
ships sjnd a. cruiser, which arrived at
Toulon this morning, are taking coal and
provisions on board. They said they had
no information on the subject-
The Comptroller of the Treasury to-day
decided th.it such witnesses can be given
mileage at the- rate of 5 cents per mile
and witness fees at the rate of $1 50 per
day.
Published records of the "War and Navy
Departments indicate, however, that Rear
Admiral Sampson was advised on May 19
of the receipt of this Information, though
It does not appear that he was informed
of the source from which it came, and
could not know how reliable it was. It
developed to-day that the Navy Depart
ment is arranging to summon, witnesses
from Cuba, Including some of the insur
gents who displayed the signal at Cien
fuegos.
There is reason for believing, however,
that this dispatch is on file in the secret
archives of the Signal Service, and that
In the absence of General Greely in the
Philippines, subordinates in his office have
not been willing to give it up. During
the war with Spain General Greely re
ceived many dispatches which were not
put on the regular file and knowledge of
which was withheld from even confiden
tial clerks in the office, as General Greely
would take no risk of the sources of his
information becoming known. >
In the Secret Archives.
It is also intimated that' it has been im
possible to procure documentary evidence
in support of Rear Admiral Schley from
the War Department. His attorneys have
been unable to find the original dispatch
sent by Colonel Allen of the Signal Ser
vice to General Greely announcing the
arrival of the Spanish fleet at Santiago.
In the meantime Admiral Schley is mak
ing another effort to have the Navy De
partment call the alleged interview to'
Rear Admiral Howison's attention and
ask him whether it is correct. He wrote
a letter to Acting Secretary Hackett to
night protesting against the action of that
official and insisting that his previous let
ter was not a preliminary challenge of
Rear Admiral Howison.' He contends
that the department should grant his first
request and ask Rear Admiral Howison
about the interview. Acting Secretary
Hackett sent for Schley's attorneys to
day and had a lengt'ay conference at the
Navy Department. At Its conclusion
neither Hackett nor the lawyers would
say what had been decided. They agree
in a statement, however, that the ques
tion of Rear Admiral Howison serving as
: a member of the court- had not been \ the
subject of discussion. ' hT" "
Hints of Serious Charges. , .
Vague hints were dropped at the Navy
Department to-day that serious charges
will be made on behalf of Schley that
some one in the department has mutilated
the records; that letters have disappeared
and that pages out of letter press copy
books have also disappeared. Owing to
striirgent orders issued by the department
against discussion of the Schley case It
is impossible- to get accurate statements
on this point. " â¢
If the Boston reporter correctly quoted
Rear Admiral Howison, it may be that
that officer will recall the circumstances
and will realize that he ought not to serve
on the court and request the department
to relieve him. .
May Ask to Be Believed.
Rear Admiral Schley's attorneys will
present an affidavit sworn to by a reporter
of a, Boston paper who wrote the!inter
view against which complaint is made y If
Rear Admiral Howison stands by his
statements in the letter to the depart
ment. Admiral Dewey and . Rear Admiral
Benham will be forced to pass upon the
question of veracity between Rear Ad
miral Howison and the reporter. - Some
of the officials of the Navy Department
hope that all friction over this matter
may be avoided by Admiral Howison Re
questing the department to relieve him or
the ground that it Is evident that he
would be unsatisfactory to Rear Admiral
Schley, the officer who has asked for the
court of inquiry.

For Twentieth Century Athletic Club.
The Twentieth Century Athletic Club
has secured the Jeffries-Ruhlln fight lor
a date in November not yet set, but to
be agreed upon in the near future. By
agreement with the Twentieth Century
Club the San Francisco Athletic Club
refrained from entering a hdd, reserving
for themselves the exclusive right of bid
ding for the December fight. As compen
sation each club will give tfce other 10 per
cent of the gross receipts of its respective
fight. *-Â¦"-' :
Thus was a victory won by the fight
promoters. For their own mutual pro
tection they came together "Wednesday
evening, talked over the situation and de
cided hot to cut their own throais for the
quiet satisfaction of the fighters and their
promoters. By close figuring it was de
cided to offer Jeffries and Rohliri 6a per
cent of the gate receipts. Sanguine that
they, held the situation well In, hand, the
representatives of both cluba filed Into
Harry Corbett's yesterday at 1 o'clock
and greeted all with pleasant, self-eat
isfled smiles and extended hands. Delaney
and Madden were there. They were not
so - happy, for they had anticipated ex
travagant offers and were chagTined to
find what Ruhlin called a: "prize fight club
trust" staring them in thÂ© face.
Then the haggling began. Delaney said
he was there to look out for a cham
pion who was accustomed to stupendous
offers and no poor, miserable 60 per cent
would be entertained. Madden thought
just as much of his own man as Delaney
did of the champion, and declaxed in full
round "terms that he would stand pat on
65 per cent and no less. Much argument
followed without a seeming possible set
tlement to the difficulties. The fight was
65 against 60. Jack Gleason of: the Twen
tieth Century Club told Madden and De
laney that the only possible place for the
men to fight was San Francisco, and Mad
den and Delaney told Gleason that they
would not fight at all if they could get
no more out of it than the percentage
figure set by the club. This was mere
bluster on both sides. Two hours after
the discussion opened a compromise was
effected and 62% per cent was agreed
upon by all parties.
In accordance with this meeting of
minds articles between the club and the
representatives of the fighters were
drawn up and signed. The referee ques
tion will be taken up again and If thÂ©
club presses the matter a local man may
be substituted for George Slier. The date
of the fight will be- determined later, but
In all probability will be set for the first
week in November.
The San Francisco Club has an assur
ance from Jeffries for a December fight, i
also one from Ruhlin In the event of a
victory. One of these Â¦ men -will be
matched with a third party when the time
comes. /

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 23 V 1901
In a telegram received by Bob Bettner
this evening . the intelligence was con
veyed that one of his children is seriously
ill and he will depart for Los Angeles to
morrow. This is unfortunate, as Bettner
is a, crack polo player and the owner of
several very fast racing ponies.
At 9:30 in the morning the ladles' tour
nament ' will be continued on the links
and unless something unforeseen should
happen Miss Caro Crockett is picked as a
certain winner.
â¢ Golf and polo have nearly had their run
and to-morrow racing will be held at the
track under the auspices of the Pacific
Coast Polo and Pony Raising Association.
There is considerable disappointment in
select turf circles to-night over the fact
that Walter Hobart scratched Silver Dick
the highly touted Colorado pony, from
the four-furlong scramble. Topo, a green
one, and supposed to be very fast is
picked to win this event, although there
is a remote possibility that his entry will
be protested. SUver Dick will be started
in a quarter mile (lash on Saturday If a
special short sprint is not arranged for
to-morrow's card.
The enthusiastic lady golfers here are
declaring that to make "good" on the
Del Monte links is easy. There is not
enough of up hill and down dale to prove
their skill, they claim. Miss Ives, one of
the crack players, refers contemptuously
to the links as "baby" links.

Crockett defeated Mrs. R. Gilman
Brown this morning In the first
round of the tournament for the
ladies' golf championship- of the Pacific
Coast. Naturally there Is much rejoicing
in the Burlingame camp this evening.
It was a close game and the ' result
proved a complete reversal of form. Mrs.
.Brown was setting on to victory and
seemed a sure winner until, with the lead
of two up over her opponent and two
holes still to play, she lost by an unfor
tunate stroke two - holes in . succession.
This play placed "Mrs. Brown and Miss
Crockett still at the end on the eighteenth
hole. It was In the play-off for the final
hole that Mrs. Brown met her Waterloo.
Miss Crockett's score was one up over
nineteen holes. Miss Crockett, bears her
honors modestly and Mrs. Brown is loud
in her praise for'her vanquisher.

by stupid work on the coaching line. Hof

were scratches. Whalen also presented

has every right and title in the .world to
be sad. His chief delight is to win a base
ball grame; his deepest, most ultramarine
sorrow to lose one. And the Angels have
lost againâ this time a fourteen inning
cam? that was twice won by .Los Angeles,
at least Morley thought so. "and now he
is full of kicks and opposition to every
natural thing under the sun. -Â¦-â¢ â
The fanatics sat down to a feast at Re
creation grounds yesterday afternoon.
Besides receiving a game and a half for
one adult fare they saw three fair balls
lost over the center field fence, all of.
which meant home runs. Then there were
two-base hits until the eyesight failed
and one long vhree-bagger, sharp fielding
on. both sides and comparatively few
errors. Although the pitchers were hit
hard the game was not pyroteehnical
from the stick end, considering: Its pro
longed length.
When the uneasy visitor was about to
go home and Jay the credit of the game
to the Angels after the first out in the
last of the ninth. Eagan rolled the ball
to center for a couple of bags. Earlier in
the day he had made a home run, When
Dunleavy followed with another two
bagger and Eagan galloped home, tying
the 6core, Mr. Morley could not speak for
pure, unalloyed misery.
And then the game went on Inning after
inning, the Dudes adding up hits but
being unable to score. Â¦ Out of a dark sky
a ray of light fell upon Morley. In the
fourteenth Kelly, without evident .prepa-.
ration, let the bat swing good and hard
end the ball sailed over the center field
fence. the Angel knocker cantering
around the bags. Morley thought he had
the game won.
The Dudes did their work in bunches In
this inning. Dunleavy got four bad ones
and walked to first, advancing a bag on
Arrellanes' hit. Both runners pushed up
a station on a neat little sacrifice by Bab
bitt. Then came the chance for Dr. Mos
kiman to win his own game. By a single
to center he scored I>unJeavy and Arrel
lanes and the game was finished. Score:

"Sandy" McNaughton and ."Doc",
Hughes, two well-known members of the
Olympic Club, exchanged love taps in the
gymnasium of the Post-street athletic In
stitution yesterday afternoon and but for.
Garnet Ferguson both would have been fit
subjects for an undertaker. Neither man
was in condition and after two minutes
of boxing with sofa cushions they were
limp and weary. McNaughton scored first
blood and also the first knockdown. After
that the contestants shook hands and
called it a dayV work. _ â¢
Joe Eppinger brought on the game of
fisticuffs. He has great respect for
"Sandy" as a boxer, and likes to see him
perform. He and McNaughton were walk
ing into the club yesterday and met
1 Hughes standing : In the , entrance. In : a
jocular way Eppinger requested Hughes
to sidestep, and- VDoc," who Is very
clever at repartee, invited Mr. Epplngei
to take a vacation In a more torrid clime.
Eppinger replied in kind and asked Mc-
Naughton to shove the "Doc" oft the face
of the earth. . : s
Hughes, believing himself Insulted, In
formed Eppinger that' he could put Mc-
Naughton- out In less J than two rounds.
Bets were soon made and. the men donned
ring costumes and hied themselves .to the
gymnasium.; Garnet Ferguson acted as
timekeeper and "Kid" .Veiller was referee.
Bob Hancock was Hughes' adviser. Ep
pinger went behind "Sandy", and admin
istered champagne in small portions to the
overtained cladlator. , - >
I When, the gong sounded Hughes rushed
and McNaughton ducked. They clinched
and were with difficulty pried apart; There
was another ' rush and Hughes- hit the
floor. There. was a dent in McNaughton's
glove and blood on . the Â¦ "Doc's"' probosis.
Fearing : that .the /athletes might injure
themselves if they 5 continued their exer
tions Ferguson stopped the clock and the
referee declared' all bets off. . , -

NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The establish
ment of a publishers' clearing-house was
discussed at to-day's session of the conven
tion of the National Association of News
dealers, Bock Sellers and Stationers. A
resolution was adopted reciting that book
publishers had greatly benefited the trade
by adopting and maintaining standard
prices for books and requesting the asso
ciation to establish in this city a pub
lishers' clearing-house for the convenience
of both local and country dealers.
The convention urged the increase of the
price of the penny morning newspapers
on the ground that it was impossible for
the dealers to make a living out of morn
ing newspapers which they have to buy
at 60 cents a hundred and sell -at a cent
each The publishers of the New York
citv morning papers were asked by reso
futToHntroduced by Mr. May of Paw
tucket R I., to increase their retail price
to 2 cents and to furnish the papers to
the dealers at $1 10 a hundred. . The pub
lishers of the evening newspapers were
urged to omit publication on the Fourth
of Julv. Thanksgiving day, Christmas
and New Year's day. It was also de
cided to request, that penny newspapers
be made non-returnable and that they be
sold at 50 cents a hundred.
Professor William P. Rogers of the Indi
ana State University read a paper entitled
"Is Law a Field for Woman's .Work?"
Professor , Rogers took the position that
women should be encouraged In taking
up the study of law. although he said
her fitness for the practice of the profes
sion ls yet, to a large extent, an unsolved
problem.
The discussion of this paper was opened
by Miss Mary F. Lathrop of Denver and
was taken part in by a number of men.
All took about the same view as that
taken by Professor Rogers. .
Adolph Mose3 of ( hicago created a sen
sation by making a strong protest against
the character of Llttlefield's address.
Technically speaking, there Is no opinion of
the court -to sustain the judgment.. If the De
Lima case (known as Dooley vs. United
States) is controlled by the Downes cases, said
Littlefleld. there would seem to be no good rea
son why it should not have been decided. That
It was not raises the Inference that it would be
decided 'adversely to the Government or that
there was a greater difference of opinion than
usual with reference to it. Justice liray ls the
only ore who indicates his "position" in this
case.
Taking up the first case, known as De
Lima vs. Bldwell, and stating the opin
ion of every member of the Supreme
Court ori the same, the speaker said Jus
tice Brown did not announce the conclu
sion arid judgment of the court, affirming
the judgment Jf the court below, but
rendered one. of ini own. Referring to
the opinions of Justices White, Shiras and
McKenna in the same case, the speaker
said:
The feature of the. morning session was
the annual address, which was delivered
by Congressman Charles E. Littlefleld of
Maine. Hla subject was "The Insular
Cases." These cases. -he said, considered
in the manner in which the results were
reached, the Incongruity of such . results
and the variety of inconsistent views ex
pressed by the different members of the
court, "are without a parallel In our ju
dicial history."
DENVER, Aug. 22.â The General Coun
cil of the American Bar Association has
decided that women are not eligible for
membership In the association under the
present constitution. This decision was
rendered in the case of Mrs. Jane B. Ott
of Dyersville, Iowa, who had applied for
membership. The council was almost
evenly divided on the question/ It was
finally decided to let the matter go over
a year and then to take up the question
of. appointing a committee to draft an
amendment to the constitution which will
make women ellglcle.

The Grampus was built in 1S74 and was
rebuilt in lb86. She was the smallest .of
the steam whalers, being only 13o feet
lone 21 feet â¬ inches beam and 14 feet t>
inches de*p. Captain H. H- Soâ¢^.^
the first owner of the vessel and made a
fortune out of her. On his retirement the
Pacific Steam Whaling Company pur
chased her and has run her ever since.
Engines and hull were insured for $4o,!XK).
The equipment was not insured.
The fleet that left here last spring was
composed of the Alexander, Alice
Knowles. Andrew Hicks. Balaena. Bel
vedere, California. Charles W. Morgan.
Gavhead, Grampus. Jeanette, John and
Wihthxop, Karluk and William Baylies.
Of these the Balaena and Grampus have
v Veen lost and of the others on July 4 thÂ»!
J Charles W. Morgan had 1200 barrels of
ffPerm and 276 barrels of whale oil and
Â£400 pounds of bone. The California had
SX> barrels of sperm oil, the Gayhead 500
barrels sV>erm and the Alice Knowles 300
barrels sperm and two small right whales.
IS there a hoodoo on the whaling fleet? I
Thirteen vessels left port last season
and two of the best of them have
been lost Â«uring the last thirteen
weeks. How many more will -meet a
like fate? That is the question that Is
troubling owners just now. The Balaena
left her on April 7 for the Arctic. She
â¢was provisioned for twenty-six months
and vas to have wintered off the Macken
zie River. While on her way north she
went on an uncharted rock off St. Law
rence Island and became a total wr.eck.
. The Grampus left here March 14 and
4fv e also is a total wreck. She was fitted
out for a two years* stay in the Arctic
and had fully $50,000 worth of supplies
aboard. She passed through the first
stages of her journey without incident
and was supposed to be Eafe In the Arctic
when the news reached the Merchants
Exchange yesterday that she had gone
ashore at Cape Smythe and was a total
loss. The captain and crew were rescued
and landed at Teller by the steam whaier
Jeanette. In order to do this the latter
vcssel, which is owned by Roth Blum &
Co.. must have made a long run back to
civilization from Point Barrow.
The meager dispatches that arrived here
from the Sound simply state that the bark
Â¦was a rota! loss on Cape Smythe and that
the crew had been saved by the Jeanette
and taken back to Teller. The officers
of the Grampus were:
Myrlck, John Pearson, Mrs. C. Prezeau and son,
H. C. Schmidt. Miss A. Schneider, Frank Slcot,
Miss Steele, W. R. Tuttle, D. L. Van Dine,
Charles F. Warwick. Miss F. Williamson.
For Pago Pagoâ C. Ettling.
For Aucklandâ Miss L. Dwyer, Mrs. F. Ham
mond, James Roberts, Miss E. Torrens, Charles
AVest, Mrs. West.
For Sydneyâ Mrs. M. Beattie, B. Gaffney, R.
Gould, George Hallparn, Joseph Newman,
Charles Prince, T. W. Singleton, Edward
Walsh.
Another Ship-wreck Reported.
The following dispatch was received by v
the Merchants' Exchange from Seattle
yesterday:
"The purser of the steamship Nome
City says: 'On August 14 a four-masted
schooner with white fore topmasts was
seen on the beach off Unimak Island. At
tempted to speak her, but there was ap
parently no one aboard. . The schooner
Â¦was not damaged to any great extent and
was resting easily on her side. The name
could not be made out.' "
A number of San . Francisco owned
schooners are now in the north and their
owners are now on the anxious seat un
til further news arrives from^Unimak Isl
and.

Montana Supreme Court Will Pass
The professor, surveying International
relations from the standpoint of a politi
cal jj philosopher, observes ,that while j the
French Revolution was occasioned by the
abuses of the rrivllegred. classes,' the pres
ent situation has been caused by a revolu
tion of material conditions. The declin
ing national sentiment should ;be replaced
by a movement for the common defense
of the Central American states against
the American trusts, which are moving
to conquer the foreign- markets more
surely than they could be conquered by
battleships. The American balance of
trade has reached an unparalleled figure.
It Is a serious Question If the present po
litical units of Central Europe are strong
enough to make an effective defense, tak
ing into account the physical conditions.
The present shifting of. the. center of
gravity of the world's forces wlir. create
three great unitsâ China, Russia, .and
America. When China is equipped with
railroads the people will find that she has
the most capable merchants and the
cheapest labor. Russia will have the
largest area and be the greatest peasant
state. European capital will flow to the
United States and will be an important
increase of he/ economic prosperity. Of
the three the United States has decidedly
the lead. Its policy is commercial aggres
sion, beyond doubt, and states ! like the
American Union and Russia have gained
far more In the way of mobilization of
their powers from the construction of
railroads than such countries as Germany
and France. . '

Of all the shining platforms thus far put forward
by the Democratic party this year the most glittering
is' that, of the Democracy of Pennsylvania. That.plat-"
form virtually declares' the.;party. out of politics. It
beorins bv. savinor; "Waivincr all miÂ«tm n . :.Â«j
Such a platform could hardly be called brilliant,
but it might pass as a shiny one. Certainly it would
have all the glitter that is popularly supposed to at
tend generalities, for the Senator would hardly be
able to put any _one of his. policies into a specific
"form. How would he frame his income tax so as
to make it constitutional? How would he define the
trusts that are to be suppressed, or the means to be
used in suppressing them? Finally, what specific
method would he propose for abandoning Porto
Rico and the Philippines or for incorporating them
politically into the United States?" â¢ "
Among the seekers for new issues is Senator Vest.
That statesman- is reported to have said in a recent
interview that notwithstanding the free coinage of
silver has been consigned to the political dustheap.
Democracy will not return to what he called "the re
actionary policies of Mr. Cleveland." Neither does
he believe it. will continue to follow Bryan. He is
quoted as saying: "I have no personal feeling
against Mr. Bryan, and I admire him as a- man of
ability, courage and high character, but I do not
think he is a great leader, and do, not think he can
lead the party to victory." He then went on to de
clare that for the platform of the next national con
' test he' would favor three declarationsâ the first for
an income tax, the pecond. for the suppression of
trusts,.and the third against the acquisition or reten
tion of any territory not meant to be eventually in
corporated into the United States."
"As all is not gold that glitters, it is quite likely the
waiting leaders of Democracy may get , something
of a glittering nature to put into their next platform
without either borrowing or stealing the sterling gold
of the Republican party. They are searching for
such shiny policies now, and the country has noted
their efforts iri Ohio, in Virginia and in Pennsyl
vania. '
SHORTLY after the Virginia Democratic con
vention had adopted their platform declaring
"allegiance and unfaltering devotion to the
national Democratic party and to its leaders, from
Jefferson to Bryan, who have borne the party stan
dards in victory and in defeat," one of the delegates
is reported to have said to a Republican: "Before
the next Presidential election a, number of issues will
arise, we will be easily able to get rid of Bryan, and
you will see that in 1904 we will have a platform
just as shiny as yours."
A SHINY PLATFORM.
It is not too much toYsay that the lumber industry
as it has been carried on in this country wastes fully
as much as it converts to use. Had none but mer
chantable timber been cut or burned in the Eastern
pineries there would still be great and valuable, for
ests there, for the young timber would have grown up
to take the place of that which was cut. It behooves
the people of the Pacific Coast States to profit by
the lesson" that has been taught in Michigan and
Minnesota. .
Such being the outlook in that section of the
country, the lumbermen are preparing to move with
their axes, their saws and their mills to the Pacific
Coast. When they descend upon us they will bring
considerable capital and many workingmen. They
will make business hum for'a time, but the descent
of a swarm of locusts upon a harvest field would be
hardly more disastrous than will their work be to us
in the long run, unless so.mcthing be done to prevent
them from, destroying the forests here as they have
done in the great pine regions of the Lake States.
John E. Glover of St. Paul, who is^said to be one
of the largest lumber manufacturers iiv the country,
is reported to have stated recently that the lumbermen
are looking to the day when the lumber mills of
Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota will be idle'be
cause of a lack of timber, and are making prepara
tions accordingly. In his judgment the lumber out
put of those States will shrink upward of 60 per cent
within five years and within ten years not half a
dozen mills will be running. Â¦ â
1~~^ OR some time past scientific men and students
r~< of the general conditions of the country have
â¢Â»Â¦ taken note of the rapidity with which the timber
supply is being lessened through, our reckless
methods of dealing with it. The point has now been
reached where business men take, note of it. The
lumbermen themselves perceive that their methods
have destroyed forests which if properly cared for
would- have given a large return to their owners and
still been as valuable as when the axmen first entered
them.
OUR VANISHING TIMBER.
Ohio Democracy made a Â«good spurt for party
leadership by ignoring Bryan and his platform, but
the Democracy of Pennsylvania has done better by
ignoring the whole party. The platform adopted by
the recent convention in that State closes with the
declaration: "We make this fight/not as a political
organization seeking a partisan advantage, but in the
interests of Pennsylvanians." There will be but one
more step possible in the way 'of Democratic reform,
and that will be to disband the party and quit.
The Alabama constitutional convention one day

Finally the investigator discovered that these com
binations for the conduct of great industries arc not
opposed in Europe as in this country. In Great
Britain there has been some complaint in the press,
but the Government has done nothing further than
to provide by law for r greater publicity regarding the"
promotion and annual business of corporations .than
before. In France one or two combinations have
been brought before the courts charged with
endeavoring to create monopolies, but in. each -case
the decision of the judiciary was, that there was no
cause for action. In no other country is there any
special provision against syndicates. v The people
have come to the conclusion that they are necessary
to enable their industries to compete with foreigners
and nothing is done to hamper them in. their work':
Since the free traders of the United States have
tried to take advantage of public prejudice against
trusts by setting up a theory that such combinations
are the result of protection, it deserves special notice
that in his investigations in Europe Professor Jencks
found no reason to believe that tariffs have much
effect cither way upon such combinations. He says:
"In free-trade England .the combination movement
seems to have developed considerably further than in
protectionist France; but. on the other hand, the
movement toward combination has gone much
further in extent in Austria than in England, although
in England the form of combination is generally more
complete."
In France the tendency toward combinations is less
than in any other country under investigation. â¢ Pro
fessor Jencks attributes the lagging to two causes.
First, he says, France is less developed industrially
than either Germany, Great Britain or the United
States and is a less active competitor in the world's
markets, and second, the French code is very severe
against attempts at monopolistic control of the
market'. ,
In Austria the tendency is almost as marked as in
Germany. Of Great Britain it is said: "There were
in earlier days very many local combinations to keep
up prices and in some cases the efforts were quite suc
cessful. Within the last three years, however, a very
active movement toward the concentration of indus
try into large single corporations, after the form
which is common in the United States, has been
observed."
It is in German}' that the tendency toward indus
trial combinations has been most notable in Europe,
snd the commissioner says: "It is probable that the
movement there has been extended as far as in the
United States, and that combinations there, speaking
generally, exert a great power over prices, over wages
and in other directions. The plan of such organiza
tions in Germany is, however, quite different from
that which prevails here, as in most cases they are
made simply by contracts among independent estab
lishments instead of by forming a single large cor
poration as is the custom in the United States."
PROFESSOR J. W. JENCKS, appointed by the
United States Industrial Commission to inves
tigate industrial combinations in Europe, has
recently submitted to that body a summary of his
forthcoming report, which it is said will form a book
of about 500 pages. From the summary it' appears
that trusts have been thriving in Europe for some
time, but that they excite less comment and criticism
than in the United States owing to the fact that they
are generally regarded as being necessary to meet
modern industrial conditions.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
NH. BORGFELDT, a manufacturer of cigar making machinery and a
partner In the. early inventions of Oscar Hammersteln. i3 about to sail
for Havre with a life saving raft which he has spent thirty years In
â¢ perfecting to compete for the prize of $20,000 offered by the estate of
Anthony Pollok of Washington, who was lost In the wreck of the Bour
gogne on July 4, 1S98.
The contest was originally connected with the Paris Exposition, but the
exhibits there v/ere not satisfactory, and a new competition has been authorized
under the direction of Captain S. Dechaille, director of the salvage service of
the Chamber,, of Commerce of Havre. This is to begin on September 1.
As far ba'ck as 1S77 the device, in a less perfect form, was tested by the
United States Navy upon the. U. S. S. Tallapoosa and was highly recommended
by Lieutenant D. G. McRItchie, commander of the vessel, to the Navy Depart
ment. It was used by the Oregon Steamship and Navigation Company upon sev
eral of their vessels shortly after that time. The Pollok competition , has now
caused Mr. Borgfeldt to revive his plan. The patent upon the device has expired,
and he says he is exploiting it now solely in the interests of humanity.
'In principle, the raft Is entirely different from anything now In use. It Is
built of floats and bags of rope netting, which can be rolled into the size of an
ordinary ship's boat and slung to support in the same way. When needed. It only
requires the cutting of a' rope to cause it to unroll and float alongside the vessel.
There it Is held by a rope ladder as wide as the raft, down which fifteen
persons may scramble abreast. Those who fall merely tumble upon the raft, and
not into the sea. Instead of tossing like a boat, it merely rises and falls with the
action of the heaviest waves.
The main purpose of thedevlce is to afford a safe method of loading the boats,
which are admitted to be the best shelter for shipwrecked persons. Much of the
danger, in such disasters as that of the Bourgogne collision has been in the wreck
ing of the boats before they could leave the ship's side: By lowering the boats
empty they can be easily filled from this floating "landing stage. When the beats
are filled those who would otherwise be left behind have a chance for their lives
on the raft, which can be cast loose by the slipping of a noose.
In one test twenty-two men went over the side of a ship to the raft in one
minute. The floats are made of airtight tin boxes cased , in wood. Some of these
can be filled with water and provisions. They are fastened together by spars,
ropes and netting. The whole raft weighs about a tonâ but little more than a
ship's boat. A complete raft will be sent to Havre for the tests.
We , admit ' that there is room to respect certain
conscientious people who object to the canteen be
cause, they believe it to be official recognition of in
toxicants,^however mild.' As these frankly -.state the
reason let -them have credit. The other class, which
has defamed the President, his Cabinet and the -army
officers, and .declared the canteen worse than the
deadfall, gets no respect and deserves none.
As the line officers, chaplains, surgeons and all who
are in a position to knew what they are talking about
agree upon the superiority of the canteen over its
rival outside the posts, the press of the country may
venture to discuss the question fearless of the accusa
tion that it is paid by the "rum power." If the de
fenders of the deadfalls wish to take the position that
nearly all the regimental,. brigade and division officers
of the United States army are bribed to lie about the
matter, let them do so.
ARMY officers at the Presidio, including chap
lains) have made an official report bearing on
. the canteen issue. The conclusion favors the
system as against the outside deadfall. Temperance,
economy, conduct, morals and discipline seem all to
be arrayed against the rumhole substitute for the en
listed man's post club. Of course, those who dream
of the impossible and expect to enforce absolute pro
hibition'will oppose any method by which "the joldiers
can be ' protected against abuse of themselves, and
will be. willing to sacrifice all that must fall before
their teetotal Utopia comes. But sober-minded folks
know that that means a perpetual sacrifice of men
and the use of the' army as a place in which to rot the
morals and the bodies of recruits. â¢

ABOUT THE CANTEEN.
By way of keeping ahead of the Germans the Brit
ish are now projecting a line of steamers swift enough
to cross the Atlantic in four and a half days from
Bantry Bay to New York. In comparison with the
competition in speed of various steamship .lines it
will be seen that yacht-racing is hardly worth think
ing about. .
Our members in Congress need to know that our
people feel deeply and. bitterly in this matter. It
brings back to them all the pain of the hard years
passed, and freshens the sacrifices made to get a
chance to live by impressing the home market, which
it is now proposed to give away that metals and coal
oil may widen their market in France and be sold
cheaper there than at home, the difference being taken
out of us. Surely it is an occasion for beating the drum,
and if we don't beat the treaty there will be no drum
head to beat unless il is made out of the skin of a
dead industry.
If the conditions were reversed, does any one think
the Eastern manufacturers, would stand by and suck
their thumbs while we cut their dividends or invaded
their surplus to secure a better foreign market for the
products of our soil? They would not merely beat
the drum, for the full band would be out.
These treaties were made without consulting this
State. But it is evident that the Eastern industries,
which get all the profit but of them at our expense,
were more than consulted â they planned and dictated
them, and have been solidly, organized to secure their
ratification. Let it be plainly understood that the
profit is taken out of us, and that there is not a penny
of present or future compensation for us. The treaties
may be ratified, but The Call desires that the Senators
who do it shall realize that they have been in a fight.
Our wine business is in its critical stage. Not
many years ago its estate was so low that the vine
yards ran the risk of being torn up. By great exer
tion and great loss the industry seems to have passed
the point of peril. Just as it is in this condition ap
pears a reciprocity treaty that in its give and take
gives California away that Eastern manufacturers
may take French trade. Those manufacturers have
been the beneficiaries of protection since 1789. They
did duty as "infant industries" in" Henry Clay's time
and were mewling and puking in the country's arms
when California belonged to Spain. To nurse them
has cost vast sums. France has nothing that can
compete with them. They are infant industries no
more. We defy any one to give a good economic
reason why the fruit-growers of California should be
sacrificed for them.
By contrast, France had vineyards and made wine
long before Caesar's invasion, and has been at it ever
since. It is there an old and highly organized indus
try. The French vintners are past masters at blend
ing, fortifying, plastering and sophisticating, either
harmfully or harmlessly, their wines. If is all an
ancient art in the hands bf habitual experts, who have
steadily resented abridgment of their American mar
ket by the competition of California.
To this it may be truthfully answered that such an
amendment is exactly the same as beating the treaty,
the purpose of which is to favor Eastern manufac
tures at the expense of Western products of the soil.
Reciprocity is a give and take. France for two sea
sons now has produced an imnfense surplus of
wine, and brandy. California is her only com
petitor. With us the industry is new. It has
risen within the last thirty years. Its proper com
mercial organization is very recent. : It has , had to
conquest the American market in the first instance in
order to live at : all. The tariff has given it that op
portunity.
IT ought not to be difficult to understand why
California objects* to features in the pending
reciprocity treaties. The Oakland Enquirer accuses
The Call of again "beating, the drum" to summon the
State to stand up against ratification, and thinks "it
would be wiser to adopt a Jess antagonistic course and
try to accomplish the purpose through such an
amendment of the treaties as will prevent our vine
yardists and other producers from being especially
hit." â¢ 6&P -%$M
THOSE RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
â¢That is about the one bit of genuine shining truth
in the Senator's talk. Unless something wholly un
foreseen happen, the next election, like that of 1896
and of 1000, will be another ratification^ by the peo
ple of the policies and principles of the. Republican
It is to be noted that Senator Vest has little faith
in his own platform or in any other. Iri the inter
view from which we : have quoted he said: "If con
ditions remain as they are to-day : the Republicans
will elect anybody they choose." If -their- policy
gives us the enormous balance of trade we had last
year and opens a market for agricultural and manu

Little Clara was about the home of her
uncle by marriage a great . deal and ' he
became much attached to her. 'When she
was 2 years old ; her mother consented to
let her take ' up â¢ her . home . permanently,
with the Huntingtons.. From ;that\ time
she was taught to call her aunt and uncle
by marriage "mamma" and ."papa." Her

Clara Prentice, now the Princess von
Hatzfeldt, was born in Sacramento in
1861. Her father, Â¦ who conducted a small
grocery in that city, was drowned in the
flood of 1862. To Collis P. Huntington,
who was then in the hardware business
at Sacramento, was married Mrs. Pren
tice's sister.r><-\-- v->;i--ig3HSBSB[ SMMfS9Â£lÂ£B
That the determination to bring the con
test was arrived at very soon after Hunt
ington's* death is shown by the fact that
an agent made a secret search within a
few days after the contents of Hunting
ton's will became public of the official
records at Sacramento. No record of the
adoption; was found by the mysterious
emissary. Subsequently a search was
made by. some men high in Southern Pa
cific councils, b.ut it proved fruitless.
Mrs. Prentice said she signed a paper
given her by Collis P. Huntington In
which she relinquished all claim to Clara
in favor of him. There was subsequently
a formal adoption, she said, but she was
of the opinion that It might have taken
place in New York and that the records
were there. .
Decides at Once to Bring Contest.
. The Princess von Hatzfeldt reached this
city on Sunday, June 16,- and proceeded
directly to Sacramento to question her
mother as to her adoption, wh'lle her
titled husband remained in San Francisco,
consulting with attorneys. It was an
nounced/that the Princess had gone to
Sacramento merely on a dutiful visit to
her mother and strenuous denials were
made of the real object of her visit to
the capital city.
Collis P. Huntington had willed Princess
Hatzfeldt but $1,000,000 from his vast
estate, treating her as a foster child,
though she had always been- looked upon
as his adopted daughter. To the nephew,
H. E. Huntington, was left $15,000,000.
It is no wonder that the woman who had
always lived in the railway millionaire's
household as his daughter should feel re
sentment at being left but one-fifteenth
of what had been willed to a nephew and
that she should reach a determination to
secure what she deemed her rightful sharo
of the estate. - â¢'â¢ .

Each succeeding step in the great strug

strong efforts at secrecy has been pub

nounces the closing scene in the struggle
for millions that has been going on with
so little noise and with battle grounds on
both sides of the continent. â¢
The foregoing dispatch announcing the
compromise of what promised to be the
greatest will contest in ; the history of
America forms an interesting final chap
ter In the story of Princess Hatzfeldt'a
efforts to break Into the strong box of
the Huntington estate and secure more
than the millionaire intended to give her.
From the time The Call published exr
clusively the news of the fact that Prin
cess Hatzfeldt had come to California to
secure evidence of her adoption to be used
in a contest of the dead railway king's
last testament each piece of news con
cerning the proposed fight in the courts
has been eagerly sought, especially by
those hlsh in the social and financial
worlds.

to their wealth is finally made.

and the payment of the $6,000,000 will be

Miss Saunders Is a tall and prepossess
ing woman. - She has a number of beau
tiful gowns and is a commanding figure
on the stage. Her voice has fine timbre
and is likely to please local theater-goers.
Off the stage Miss Saunders is Mrs. Mc-
Gucken. Her husband is a brother of Al
bert McGucken, the noted tenor who vis
ited this country many years ago. Her
husband is also a singer â¢ and an ideal
accompanist. He has frequently played
for his wife when she sang, but owing
to the excellence . of the Orpheum's or
chestra his presence will be unnecessary.
Miss Saunders will sing a number of
beautiful melodies during her engage
ment. She will sing a selection from the
"Singing Girl," a slumber song and a
waltz song that will surely be popular. "
Miss Saunders studied under the direc
tion of Madame de la Grange of Paris.
Her voice is a pure contralto. It may not
be known, but it is a fact that there are
few contralto voices now before the pub
lic. Miss Saunders is an American, but
has lived abroad for many years. She
has sung before the nobility in London
drawing rooms and has appeared in light
and grand operas abroad. While In this
country she has supported Alice Neilson
and other well-known singers. She came
to America to alternate with. Miss Jessie
Bartlett Davis,' who was previous to en
tering vaudeville a member of the famous
Bostonlans.
tos on the American stage, will
open an engagement at the Orpheum. The
management of the local playhouse looks
upon the songstress as a top-liner. Miss
Saunders has a sweet and powerful voice
and since her advent into vaudeville has
Â¦won great popularity. For many seasons
she has sung in opera companies. She
was a member of Alice Neilson's organ
ization that produced the "Singing Girl"
so successfully in the East. This is her
initial visit to this coast and there is
every indication that she will score a hit.
For the last six weeks Miss Saunders
has rested and she feels that her voice
has benefited by it. She has been singing
continuously *or the last ten years in
London and "America. She has appeared
in light and grand opera and has also
sung in oratorios.
During the last season she has been at
the Metropolitan Theater, New Tork,
singing with a noted English opera com
pany. Like other noted singers, she was
tempted to enter vaudeville and her suc
cess has been so great that she is very
likely to continue in this department of
the profession.

The appointment of receivers from a practi
cal standpoint was not satisfactory In several
instances, and not being countenanced by the
Circuit Court of Appeals I have tried as far
as possible to allow the parties In possession
under the claims of title to work the property
by giving a bond to the opposite party and
complying with certain other orders of court,
an accounting being required" practically as
from a receiver. This, of course, is not a rule
capable of uniform enforcement. The desire
of the court, however, as far as possible is to
allow mines to be worked, in order that labor
may be employed and the resources of the
camp â¢ developed. . _ â¢
In regard to the removal of Mr. Borchsenlus
es clerk of the District Court I had been ad
vised that he was unfriendly to the court and
had written a letter to certain officials in the
States calculated to arouse prejudice against
me last fall.%1 should have dismissed Mr.
Borchsenlus much sooner than I did had 'I
found a catlsfactory successor. . I desire to
state most positively and emphatically that
I never asked Mr. Borchsenius to-do a dis
honorable or improper act in my life. H. G.
Steel, the Incumbent, was â¢ In Nome last
year. : He came to me with such recom
mendations as prompted me to believe that he
would be an excellent man for the position, as
I believe that .he is and will continue to be
to the satisfaction of all Instead of being a
special friend of a few who were openly or
covertly opposed to the court. Â¦ â¢ . .
My attention is called to the Fink Interview
in the Seattle Times of July 25. It is so grossly
and absolutely false as to be ridiculous In
Nome but where Mr. Fink Is not known, and
the prevailing condition of Nome not under
stood, it may receive some credence. A Grand
Jury was not even contemplated at this term
of court, the â¢ District Attorney informing me
that no occasion for it existed. This opinion
was E given prior to the term and before the
dismissal at Borchsenius. I do not think that
Mr Borchsenius himself will claim anything to
the" contrary. The utterances of Mr. Fink were
his own fabrications, without any j foundation
whatsoever, and where he Is known will only
cause- a smile. In conclusion I desire to say
that I have not knowingly or willingly done or
said an Improper thing since I- arrived In Alas
ka. On the contrary I have to the best of my
ability, and as far as possible, performed all
of the duties that devolved upon me In a con
scientious and hoqest manner.
I nave Â¦ not now nor have since I arrived
taken one single dollar Â¦ or . the promise of a
dollar outside of the legal allowance made to
me by the Government. â¢ Further, I have never
been in collusion or combination with any
man or set of men. Before coming to Alaska
I had practiced law for twenty years and my
integrity .; or honor were never questioned by
friend or foe. I have pursued the same course
in life in ' Alaska as has been my rule in life
In years gone by. I think I can safely say
that Â¦ my enemies, and I have some, will not
question my honesty of purpose and desire to
do right as far as I have been or am able to
see It. Â¦' ' ' . : .
Receivers Not Satisfactory.
Soon after navigation closed the camp so far
as the court was concerned quieted down, and
I believe that I was on good terms with prac
tically all of the inhabitants. No one could
have been more kindly" or considerately treat
ed than was Mrs. Noyes and myself by almost
all of those who had been arrayed against me.
Many" of them again took up the fight when
reports were received from the outside. The
litigants in. a great, many instances are In
tense in their feelings. Property Involved Is
valuable or believed to be valuable, consisting
mostly or mining properties where an extrac
tion of the gold is necessarily a destruction of
the property, and -applications for restraining
orders and injunctions are very numerous.
I knew before navigation closed that one
Braslan, whom I ' had understood was in ' the
employ of the Pioneer Mining Company, Wild
Goose Mining Company, or some other com
panies, had been sent out to the States. After
ward I received a clipping from a San Fran
cisco paper wherein Braslan made gross,
malicious and false accusations against me.
Among other things he -charged that AIcRen
zie had paid off the mortgage on my house,
paid my personal - debts, secured me transpor
tation, and other false and malicious intima
tions. .That I believe was the first enlistment
of the press against me. It became general
thereafter with no opportunity to me to make
denial of the unmitigated falsehoods and
wicked charges promulgated against me.
In the early mails received February last I
heard that charges had . been filed against me
and forwarded from Washington. I did not re
ceive them until July 4 and knew nothing pre
vious to that time as to the nature of the
charges. I had never heard or read a. copy, of.
the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals un
til long after several copies were in the camp.
I was then indebted to C. S. Johnson, who
kindly loaned me the copy he had. Not know-
Ing the nature of the charges that had been
made me, I thought it best to remain
silent "until I should receive copies of same.
First Hears of Charges.
When the cases at issue were before me I
refused to allow an appeal because in my
opinion the appointment or a receiver was not
an appealable order. The code especially pro
vides for an appeal of an injunctional order.
From authorities cited I did not believe the in
junctional feature incident to the appointment
of receivers made the order appealable. This
feature was made prominent for the first time
In the Circuit Court of Appeals. No conten
tion was ever made before me that the injunc

The remains of Captain E. D. Dixon of
the Yukon steamer Louise had arrived at

The Roanoke brought down $600,000 in

the North American Trading and Trans

is estimated' that the passengers had on
their persons $200,000 more.
The Roanoke brings news of another
marine disaster in the North. The four
masted schooner James Sennett, Captain
J. F. Holstrup. is high and dry on the
north end of Urimak Island, having gone
ashore August 7 during a dense fog. Cap
tain Holstrup came down on the Roanoke
and reports the Sennett resting easily on a

she can be floated. The vessel .was built

There is a pretty little story as to how
the great railroad man came to adopt
little Clara. It is said he was at her

mother again until after C. P. Hunting
ton's death. He was so jealous of her, it
is said, that he would not let her visit her
parent and would become angry at any
intimation that she was not really his
daughter or at any remark that ascribed
her parentage to another.
Meanwhile the people are wondering"
where the Government will bury its sol
dier dead when the National Cemetery is
filled.
In all . the cemetery districts there is a
strong feeling among property owners in
favor of still further legislation. Burials
have been stopped but the danger from
the burying of the past is still present,
and until the city cemeteries are not only
closed but removed bodily these property
owners and others interested in the pub
lic health will keep up the agitation.
Cremation has in a measure solved the
problem as regards the. citizen dead, the
records of the various crematories in the
city . showing that the prejudice against
that disposition of human bodies is fast
dying out. Relatives of those buried in
the city cemeteries are in many cases an
ticipating the coming general obliteration
of the abodes of the dead from the
haunts of the living by removing the re
mains to cemeteries in adjoining counties
where they will, be secure, from further"
disturbance.
Cremation a Partial Solution.
The district surrounding the Presidio is
rapidly being settled. Residences are in
course of construction on every hand and
in a comparatively short time the reser
vation Â¦ will be contiguous to a thickly
populated portion of the city.
Before that time comes, however, the
quartermaster's department will have to
face the problem .of providing, another
place for the army dead, and property
owners in the outlying districts are anx
iously awaiting, the action of the depart
ment.
The cemeteries now within the city
limits are by law closed. Their removal
is only a matter of time. "With the Na
tional Cemetery it Is different. Every cit
izen who has at any time served with
honor in the United States Army is en
titled to burial there, and once buried the
remains are at rest forever. â¢
The census of this silent city was taken
last July. Its sleeping: inhabitants num
bered 3250. During the month, of June
there were over a hundred interments.
Last month not quite forty were buried,
but stacked up In the warehouses of the
post are the remains of several hundred
more. These will be kept a little longer
awaiting -orders for their disposition from
relatives. Some of them will doubtless
be shipped out of the State, but the ma
jority will be burled at the Presidio.
As a National Cemetery the burial
ground at the Presidio will never be dis
turbed. In two years or less, as there is
room for only fÂ«.bout 3000 more bodies, the
last funeral must be held. Then will
come the selection of a new site, also
permanent, and the citizens of San Fran
cisco are determined to see that the se
lection is made in accordance with the
ideas they expressed when they voted for
the closing of all cemeteries within the
city limits. Â¦â¢ ' â¢"â¢ '
Census of the Silent City.
The present site is bounded on the north
by Fort Point road, on the south by a
stone quarry, on the east by a deep
gulch, and the stone fence on the west
ern border separates it from the already
overcrowded army post. It contains in
all fifteen and a half acres.
The present site of -the National Ceme
tery was laid out in 1885. At that time
eight and a half acres were set aside and
consecrated to the purpose of sheltering
the remains of â¢ officers and men of â the
military branch of ' the Government. In
those days, and up to the time of the
Spanish war, burials were infrequent.
Three or four, a month would be about
the average. Even at that rate, how
ever, the space set aside for this purpose
became too small and about two years
before the war with Spain seven acres
more were added to the cemetery.
Expansion of .the cemetery within the
limits of the reservation is Impossible.
The quartermaster's department, in view
of the large number of bodies being
shipped In from the Philippines, is
already on the lookout for a Bite for a
new burial ground and the public ' will
watch the efforts of the quartermaster's
department with considerable Interest.
The National Cemetery at the Pre
sidio is rapidly filling up and two more
years, at the outside, will see every foot
of the military burial ground, with the
exception of that portion set aside for the
remains of commissioned officers, packed
tightly with the bodies of Uncle Sam's
soldiers. \ ..".,â¢Â¦

HAY'S TASK IN DIPLOMACY.
A hard rain began falling. The bodies
of the wounded were removed and thÂ«Â»
crowd scattered about In front of the
stores across the street. The officers
took advantage of this lull and spirited
the negro away in charge of two special
deputies. He was put safely aboard a
freight train for Birmingham.
The crime for which Brown will hang
was committed on May 7 near Spring
field, within a quarter of a mile of thÂ°
house of the Garretts. Brown left the
vicinity at once, first going to Birming
ham, then to Anniston and Atlanta and
finally to Charleston, S. C, where he
was captured.
After some difficulty the courtroom was
cleared. Sheriff Xorth thought It unwise
to take Brown to the jail, a few blocks
away, for the crowd was rapidly Increas
ing around the front of the Courthouse.
Twenty-eight deputies armed with pistols
and shotguns were stationed in the front
hall and at the windows of the courtroom.
The first sign of the outbreak came when
one man from the outside with a pistol
In his hand started to mount the stair
way. He was followed by two or three
others. Several shots were exchanged
and the mob leaders retreated to the out
side, when two members began firing into
the windows. Arthur Blankenship was
hit first and his brother was shot while
emptying his revolver in the direction of
the windows above. '
"If you have any respect for my feel
ings, if I can have any weight In your
hearts, let me urge you as good citizens
to go home and obey the law and I will
never cease to thanK. you from the bot
tom of my heart."
The clash with the Sheriff came In half
an hour after Judge Pelham had pro
nounced the sentence. By a ruse the
courtroom was cleared of half its angry
occupants. The remaining half were surly
and bent on mischief. At the request of
Judge Pelhara, J. L. Garrett, the father
of tne girl outraged by Brown, mounted
a table and spoke, counseling peace. In
conclusion he said:
The attempt of the mob to gain pos
session of the negro followed one of
the swiftest trials ever witnessed.
The Judge and court officials were
on the defensive to suppress the
rising anger of the crowd as detail after
detail of the crime was told by witnesses
for the State, There was no evidence for
the defense. As Brown said afterward In
nis confession there was nothing the wit
nesses he had summoned could say in
his behalf. .
The Blankenshlps were brothers and it
Is said have been in town since Monday
trying to stir up trouble. Walter died
within two hours after being shot and
Arthur is in a precarious condition.
The wounded: Arthur Blankenshlp; a
small boy, son of James Hanley, slightly
wounded.

FORECAST
(VEATHEU CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, Aug. 22.â Wheat. was not handled
in sufficient quantities to remove it from the
characterization of "dull," although during the
afternoon there was a sharp up-turn in prices,
which on the surface would indicate a different
state of affairs. The market saggtd during the
forenoon on scattered liquidation, induced, by
disappointing cables and favorable crop con
ditions. At the decline an increase in seaboard
clearances and smaller receipts at the chief
receiving points steadied prices without in
creasing the demand. A report that the ex
port inquiry was sharper and a stronger at
titude on the part of cash traders came later
as a bull Influence and the market became firm
on the sudden withdrawal of offerings. Sep
tember, having opened at 7O%@70^4c and
dropped to 70%c, ran up to 71c on a very little
buying by nervous shorts and the closing tone
was firm, September %@%c over yesterday at
70%@70%c.
The corn market was a draggy, featureless
affair all through. September closed %@%c
lower at 56>4@56%c.
Oate were weak In sympathy with corn. Sep
tember closed %@Vic lower at Zi%@35c.
Provisions were quiet. The ' market opened
firm in sympathy with higher prices at the
yards, but eased later In sympathy with- corn.
January pork closed 10c lower and, lard and
ribs each 2%<g5c lower.

An interesting dispatch to Bolton, De Ruyter &
Co. says: "Argentine shipments are decreasing,
as stocks are getting exhausted. Exports from
that country-. promise to be meager during the
balance of the season, which will turn the Eu
ropean "demand to America for about 2,000,000
bushels weekly. The European demand equals,
about 3.000.COO burhels per week, of which the
Argentine has supplied about 2,00d,000. The Ar
gentine shipments to Europe will be the main
factor in the market for some little time now."

Latest mail ae vices from New York say:
"The market was featureless yesterday, trad
ing in nearly all varieties being in small lots
only. The exception was prunes, which were
mod"ratâ¬ly active, though buyers took only
rmall quantities. Prices are firm at 7c for
40-SCs, 6c for 50-60c. 5\ 2 c for 60-7Cs, 4%c for
t-0-90s and 4c for 30-100s. There are said to
bo only light supplies available, which creates
additional firmness ar.d causes holders to in
eist upon receiving full prices before they do
business.
"There is something doing- in currants, chiefly
In Email lots, which is probably the clean-up
cf dealers before the new crop comes. Prices
ere held firmly at 9c for Amalias. Recent
cables give no Indication of any change in
the situation. The market abroad is firm, as
veil as the New York market, therefore there
:s nothing to prevent holders maintaining their
quotations.
"There is little change in raisins, except
that London layers have advanced 5c to Jl 60
because of increased demand from the West.
Two-crown are held up to 6c and 3-crown can
rot be boupht. except some insignificant lots,
at less than. fi^e. Seeded are firm at 6p6%c
in bulk and 6%<57%c in cartons. There is no
news from Smyrna to indicate a change in the
situation there."

broglio and disappointment over the main
tenance of the Bank of England rate. The â¢de

the United States comes to be financed, are
still drtaded.

CLOSING.
American stocks began listless, with an ab
sence of buying until the New York opening,
which imparted a lively advance in Baltimore
and Ohio on talk thatTthe stock will be 'put
on a 5 per cent dividend basis and Erie on the
showing made by the annual report. The. rest
of the American department was comparatively
neglected, although there was an inquiry for
Southern Pacific.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was idle and fea
tureless. The failure of the Bank of England
to. reduce the minimum discount j rate caused
Eome disappointment. The bank made a very
strong return. The market's money supplies
have been increased Â£3,000,000 through the ar
rival of gold and Government disbursements.' '

; There was not much change in Vegetables,
though Tomatoes were in still better supply and
Corn weakened off under more liberal stocks.
1 Potatoes' were steady yesterday, but the feel
,lng ,was hardly as firm, as .receipts ran up to
,7303 sacks. ; The bulk of these were for ship
ment, however, and were loaded- on the cars for
,the West. Cabbage was quoted much higher.
Onions ruled firm. The Australian steamer took
out over 10.000 crates. '. .
| Cabbaga is also short, especially in the Cen
tral West,- where the price is now ?8 per 100
head, against $1 a year ago. '
The Potato crop has been badly damaged by
hot and dry weather all over the United States
except on this coast, and prices are very high
in consequence. Potatoes are quoted at' $2@2 40
per bushel In Massachusetts, against SOcigl 20
a year ago, and on Tuesday the Chicago mar
ket Jumped to $1 75@2. a rise of 40c per : hun
dred In one. day. Colorado, which has hereto
fore sent large supplies Into the Central West,
is itself short this year and has been calling on
California for large lines. It these conditions
continue therCis no knowing ' where "the I price
will go to. The crop of the whole country' in
recent years has been about 200,C0O,C00 bushels,
but this year, . according to the reports of the
Department of Agriculture. It will be about
.15O.CO0.O00 bushels at the outside. This shortage
of 50.0C0.C00 bushels must be made up somehow.

VIENNA, Aug. 22.â The directors of the
Austro-Hungarlan Bank have decided to
begin the introduction of gold currency by
a small issue of 20 , kroner gold pieces.
The governments of the dual monarchies
have collected a sufficient reserve of gold
bullion to begin to replace paper money
by gold, j The gold will be merely experi
mental in order to accustom the public
to the circulation of geld. The present
generation in Austro-Hungary have never
seen gold circulating and it ia. feared that
the gold will be hoarded by certain classes
of the popwiation. * If, however,; the issue
proves successful, a larger one will be
made.

WOODLAND, Aug. 22.â The trial of the
first of the many cases commenced by
the city against business men charged
with violating the license ordinance was
concluded yesterday. The defendant asked
that the case be dismissed on the ground
that the last Legislature amended the
general law so that licenses may be levied
only for purposes of police regulation and
not for revenue.. The plaintiff showed
â¢that the Legislature also re-enacted the
law authorizing cities of the fifth class to
levy licenses for revenue and .' that the
Supreme Court had decided that in cases
where cities of the fifth class had a spe
cial law the general law did not operate
against It. The recorder denied the mo

"WASHINGTON. Aug. 22.â The dispatch
from Santiago, Chile, announcing that
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
Chamber of Deputies has refused to grant

tration would be discussed. A sharp line
of difference has arisen between Chile and
most of the southern republics, the lat

any limitation. On the other hand. Chile
has wished to have the discussion of arbi
tration limited to future questions. Al
though the subject has been involved in
numerous complications, yet there is ex

condition of the State treasury, showing
that on August 15 he found therein by
actual counting $677,847, when the books
called for J340.46Sâ a shortage of $162,621.
Treasurer Stowers was, however, allowed
crtdit for bills, drafts, etc., amounting to
$55,000. leaving the shortage $107,621. The
Governor' then states:
I indulged the hope that the amount of said
shortage would be replaced if opportunity and
time were given before the result of said count
was made public, and that the State might thus
recover the money without further trouble, ex
planation or loss. I therefore, in the interest
of the State, enjoined the secrecy of those pres
ent in the whole proceedings and agreed with
Mr. Stowers that I would make another count
of the money on Tuesday. August 20. On the
date fixed I made the said count. It was then
found that the cash and drafts on hand bal
anced with the books, which called for $90o,914.
The Governor closes the statement by
saying:
The examination of the funds In the treasury
was made as required of me t>y section 137 of
the constitution and in my opinion the books
of the TreaBury show a correct statement of
the amounts which should have been in the.
Treasury on the said 15th and 20th days of Au
gust, 1901, respectively, and before doing or
saying anything; further in the premises I deem
it just to Mr. Stowers (the Treasurer) that he
be given full opportunity to make such ex
planation of the matter as he may see fit.
The publication of this report created
great excitement. Stowers declined to
make a statement.

BRUSSELS, Aug. 22.â The
Independence to-day prints a
dispatch from Copenhagen which
says :
Desires to Know the Exact Position
of the Burghers in Order to
Formulate a Plan
of Action.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 22.â The strag
gle in securing a suitable right of way
between the Oregon Short Line and tha
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railway has been shifted from Nevada
to San Bernardino County. It Is not im
probable that there will be another fight
for rights of way.
To-day Chief Engineer Henry Hawgood
of the Salt Lake road sent rush orders to
his corps of surveyors in Cajon Pass to
proceed immediately to a point this side
of Barstow to head off a party of engi
neers in the employ of the opposition
forces. The Clark people left hurriedly
in the afternoon with a week's provisions
The fact that the Oregon Short Line
had surveyors in Southern California was
not generally known until Tuesday morn
ing, when the information reached Salt
Lake headquarters in this city that a
well equipped party was- en route to the
vicinity of Barstow.
Special TMspatch to The Call. ' 1
Intends Receiving President
Kruger to Obtain Direct
Statement From Him.
It is common talk in political circles
that the Republicans will win out hand
somely if they put forward a good, clean,
antj-boss ticket. The sentiment of throw-
Ing overboard all the dead weight of boss
ism is daily growing stronger. Renewed
activity is noted at the headquarters of
the Republican Primary League, 930 Mar
ket street.
The arduous' work of preparing his
great speech to the convention is begin
ning to tell on Martin Kelly. Moreover,
the boss is distracted by reports of de
fections in the Twenty-ninth District del
egation. If these distractions continue
Kelly may not be able to smooth out and
polish off his oration before the conven
tion assembles. Herrin and Lynch, who
are envious of Kelly's growing prestige
in the kingdom of bosshood, would. like
to see him flounder and fail. The round
ers of the Twenty-eighth, however, are
with Kelly heart and soul and will stand
by him to the finish of the peroration.
Lucius D." Solomon is mentioned as a
probable candidate for the honor of pre
siding over the convention. His friends
say that to his general qualifications of
capability and impartiality may be added
sobriety.
There is a good crop of candidates for
Public Administrator. The field embraces
ex-Senator Thomas C. Maher, John Farn
ham, Julius Godeau and Henry Stern.
The last named has switched from Su
pervisor to Public Administrator. "Wher
ever he goes "Jake" Shaen will go with
him. It is understood that both Farn
ham and Godeau joined the forces op
posed to the Republican Primary League
and are now soliciting anti-boss support.
Colonel Thomas O'Neill of the First
California Regiment is a candidate for
the nomination for Recorder. Al Berthier
has been slated for this office by Martin
Kelly. For County, Clerk A. B. Mahoney
is Frank French's candidate.
Candidates in the Field.
The Thirty-ninth Assembly District del
egation (anti-boss) will meet at Saratoga
Hall every Tuesday night to consider top
ics concerning the convention and listen
to suggestions relating to candidates.
Dr. Charles Boxton. a member of the
present Board of Supervisors, would be
pleased to accept renomination from the
Republican convention. Many . of his
friends claim that he is entitled to a bet
ter office than that of Supervisor and in
dicate that the ofllce of Auditor or Tax
Collector should be given him. Other
names mentioned for the Board of Super
visors are: Ed Bent, Thirty-third Dis
trict; W. E. Lane, plumber, Forty-third;
Frederick Jones, bookbinder, Forty
fourth; ex-Assemblyman' George Brown,
Forty-nfth: ex-State. Senator F. W. Bur
nett, Thirty-fourth; Maxwell McNutt, M.
Brandt and- John F. Ahem.
The Forty-first Assembly District dele
gation to the Republican municipal con
vention met last evening at 1922 Broad
way and organized by the election of Col
onel J. C. Currier, chairman, and Lester
Burnett, secretary. Twenty-four dele
gates were present and four absent. The
full anti-boss strength of the delegation
was represented by those attending. The
Forty-first decided to join other anti-boss
delegations in the appointment of a con
ference committee.
Republican Activity.
Eugene E. Schmltz, whose nomination
for Mayor by the Labor party conven
tion seems probable, is president of the
Musicians' Union and a director of the
Republican Primary League. He is a
Native Son of the Golden West, belonging
to Niantic Parlor, and is a 'resident of the
Forty-first Assembly District. He is a
man of pleasing personality. His ad
herents assert that he is affable, dignified
and conservative. He is taller and more
distinguished in appearance than Super
intendent Webster. Statements conflict
regarding the authority of the committee
representing twenty-five trades unions to
offer the Labor party's nomination to Mr.
Schmitz. Mr. Less is quoted as assert
ing that no such authority was given by
the executive committee of the council.
One of the delegates who waited on Mr.
Schmitz contends that the authority was
given. The question at issue will be set
tled by the Labor party convention at
Metropolitan Temple on September 5.
Energetic but quiet work in the interest
of Reginald H. Webster for Mayor is
noted by politicians in the Republican
camp. Mr. Webster is Superintendent of
Schools. In the event of his election to
the office of Mayor he would tender his
resignation as Superintendent. The no
tion of resigning to accept the nomination
for the Mayoralty is not entertained by
Mr. Webster. â¢
It is understood that the Pennsylvania
will make no agreement to handle Gould
freight from Pittsburg to the seaboard
unless Gould will agree to abandon abso
lutely the project for a new railroad
across Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. <*
In the meantime arrangements are being
perfected for a number of feeders which
will draw together at Pittsburg over the
Wabash a heavy freight traffic. The Big
Four has agreed to let Wabash trains use
its rails between Wellington, Ohio, and
Cleveland under a ninety-nine-year agree
ment.
The control of the Norfolk and Western
will be used by George F. Gould to fur
ther the' interests of his railroad system.
If the Pennsylvania Railroad will with
draw opposition to the Wabash in Pitts
burg and agree not to thwart Gould In his
effort to get an Atlantic seaboard outlet,
the recently acquired interest in the Nor
folk and Western will be surrendered at a
price which is fair. It is believed that
President Cassatt of the Pennsylvania
Railroad will decline to make any com
promise with the Gould party which
would/be disadvantageous to the Pennsyl
vania.'
The Gould interests, it is asserted, now
hold an actual majority of the capital
stock of the. Norfolk and Western. It is
believed that the Pennsylvania interesUis
about $10,000,000 out of the $23,000,000 pre
ferred stock and $13,000,000 out of the ?66,
000,000 common stock.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 22.â The North
American . to-morrow will say: The con
trol of the Norfolk and Western Railroad
has passed out of the hands of the Penn
sylvania Railroad and is finally â¢ in the
grasp of the Gould interests.
Negotiation has been begun between the
Rocky Mountain Telephone Company and
the Northwestern Company whereby the
former will build at once from Its present
eastern terminus at Billings to Miles City,
Mont., while the Northwestern Company
will build west from its Xorth Dakota
terminus to Miles City, thus forming a
possible circuit (via New York, Chicago,
St. Paul. Helena and Portland) from Bos
ton t>* San Francisco and Los Angeles.
NEW YORK. Aug. 22.-The Telegraph
says: "Within the next few months New
Vorkers may be able to telephone their
friends In San ; Francisco without relays.
By an agreement reached at Helena,
Mont., Atlantic and Pacific Ocean towns
are to be connected by telephone as soon
as certain preliminary details have been
completed.

PLACE FOB FOULING
Quietly but energetically the Granby
Smelter people of Grand Forks, B. . C,
have commenced grading a short line
from Grand Forks direct to Republic. In
reality they are backed by the Canadian
Pacific, but their charter does not permit
the direct ownership of that road to ap
pear. The Canadian Pacific's road is so
much shorter that it is almost certain to
be finished first. Its. projectors have also
secured long-time contracts for transport
ing the ore of the largest Republic mines
, to. the Grand Forks smelters.
TACOMA, . Aug. 22.â Present indications
are that the Canadian Pacific , Railway
will beat the Great Northern with a new
line to the rich Republic district. Presi
dent Hill announced recently that thÂ«:
Great Northern would have Its line com
pleted to Republic by January 1 next. He
accepted a route located by his engineers
running from Marcus, on Spokane Falls,
and up the San Poll Valley, across the
international boundary into Canada and
thence southward , to Republic This
makes the line over twice as long as the
air-line distance between Marcus and Re
public.

remain 'â¢ to ' be > played, these being Pacific
versus Sacramento, ito-day ; â¢ Alameda ; ver
sus Pacific/ on, September. 29, and Alameda
versus Sacramento,; von- October 6." -The
Alameda team is . now so >. far in ; the lead
that it ' is sure of â¢ capturing the , Brown
pennant tor -1901, with: Santa Cruz second
and the Pacifies thir<i , -~ ' '
The second pennant match (between the
Sacramento and the Pacific cricket
will be played Sunday on the Alameda
ground. The Pacific eleven will be the
following: H. C. Casidy (captain), Harold
B. Richardson, E. T. Langdale, J. J. Theo
bald. P. Miller. W. Henderson, W. Pethe
rlck, F. Bennlon, A. W. Wilding, C. P.

team will be' made, up about as follows:
H. R. Elliott, H. G. Macartney, H. F. El

Kerr, L. W. Robitaille; F. K. Barkworth.
A. Reynolds and E. F. Ash worth. Play
will be called at 11:30. .
The Pacific Cricket Club beat the Santa
Cruz eleven decisively last Sunday at San
ta Cruz, winning by the ample margin of
107 runs. Santa Cruz went to the wickets
first, but few of : the batsmen made any
serious stand against the bowling of
Richardson and Casidy, the former of
whom took five wickets and the latter
three. Bennion and Sollem captured one
wicket apiece. H. Bowley was top scorer,
with 35, while Jenkins and Sloman com
piledlO each. John Myers did great exe
cution behind the wickets, catching two
and stumping two. Richardson's bowling
average for' the five wickets, taken by
him was five runs, | and [ Casidy's for three
wickets was five and two-thirds runs. The
Santa Cruz innings closed for 84 runs, ten
of which were extras., Myers and Casidy
opened the Inning, for the visitors, : the
former scoring 14 and the latter- hitting
about freely ; till < he : had ; compiled 87 runs.
Richardson contributed - 19, . Petherick. 21
and John .Theobald' 14. : The Pacific total
amounted : to ; 193 runs.- .-. Dickson, . Bowley,

two and Jenkins one. \. /"- , :,
With the Cricketers.
.There has been much discussion among
enthusiasts as to whether, Cornish, cen
ter oh last year's team, will appear this
year or not. Â¦ The general impression that
Cornish has played the four years allowed
to an intercollegiate athlete is wrong,
but there is no assurance that the stal
wart center ' rush will register as a post
graduate-and play the last allotted year.
His .acceptance -of a mining -position* In
Lower California destroys all -hope for
such good fortune for California. ,
Another disappointment that California
has to bear is the loss of Smith, the
crack, half back and captain of this year's
team.'. Should; Smith: enter any of the
affiliated colleges ;of the University of
California he will enter under the condi
tion that he shall not play in this year's
game. . - - - , - * â¢â¢'
This will leave a vacancy for the cap
taincy . and It Is said among the knowing
ones that "Reck"-.Womble will not accept
It. Therefore -the most likely and most
suitable man for the position will - be
"Dobe"- Clay, the crack guard of last
year's team, who was ruled out of. the
game on- Thanksgiving; day.
Another : vacancy - caused through the
graauatlon of Captain Pringle will have
to be filled. . : - Â¦ Â¦ '
iThisleaves vacancies .for the, center
position; for one of ' the tackles and for
the halfback positions. Among the most
likely men to fill the gaps are Dutlin and
Gendotti for ; the center position, Whipple
and Sherman for the halves and O'Toole
for tackle/ " Â¦-?.:Â¦"Â¦-" -
-But little is known, of the freshman ma
terial that has just' entered, -but among
the best are: Volz-and Saeltzer, backs,
and De Merrltt, end of the Berkeley High
School; Pringle. -.guard; ; Hatch and
Stroud.i tackles, . and v Coombs, . half of
Boone's; Stines and â¢ Lewitt. , ends, and
Craig, tackle of -Lowell; Graves, half of
Polytechnic; Kelsey; of Lick;
Grantson,; end ! of "San Diego High; Sav
age, l half from Vallejo:; Howard, *half of
Oakland High : School, , and Risley, half of
Fresno High. v* Geary, quarter from the
University of '.Washington," Is . among : the
babies ' and -. Payne ' of the University- of
Oregon will probably enter. .
In all.the -hopes : of: California are high
and her/ prospects seem excellent. ;: ; > :
For the first practice I of the season,
which will be on September 1, California
will put on the field a team stronger in
dividually .than - the famous one of ", '99.
Among those of last year's team that
have- returned to college are Overall.

I In the second heat- Cresceus drew away
from Lord Derby until, at the half, he
was two lengths to the good. At the
three-quarters, however, Lord Derby had
his nose at Cresceus' wheel and a little
later he was actually ahead of Cresceus,
but at that moment he broke, and it was
all over. Ketcham drove home, creating
the. new last quarter record. The mile
was in 2:06. Summary: :;
Something of the interest was removed
from the free-fcr-all trot when Charley
Herr was distanced in the first heat, thus
leaving the affair to Cresceus and Lord
Derby.'. All of the horses received a cor
dial greeting at the scoring, and when
they went off in' the first heat Charley
Herr had the pole, with Lord Derby be
side him and Cresceus on the outside. At
the quarter the pole belonged to Cres
ceus, for Charley Herr had gone up in the
air, and at the half Cresceus was- about
two lengths in front. At the three-quar
ters Lord Derby was breathing into
Ketcham's back. The Cahill horse was
far back and out of the race. Coming
home Cresceus came in ahead by half a
length. The time was 2:07^.
The accomplishment of to-day was the
fastest quarter of all kinds, for both Peter
the preat and Tommy Brltton did â¢ the
second quarter* of a heat at Lexington,
Ky., several years ago In :29VÂ£.
READVILLE, Mass.. Aug. 22.â The cel
ebrated Cresceus was the magnet to-day
that drew almost 15,000 people to 1 the
Grand Circuit Â¦ meeting here. As a sort
of recognition Â¦ of the favors shown him
in the wav of applause when he ap
peared upon the track the. chestnut horse
proceeded, in the second- heat of his race
with Lord Derby and- Charley Herr, â¢ to
lower the track record by three-quarters
of a second and to break the world's rec
ord of final quarters by trotting the dis
tance in :29%. By this latter perform
ance Cresceus lowered the record of 30
seconds which he himself made" at De

"Of course It is early yet to say what
Trill be the programme concerning the
operation of the two tracks. That is a
matter which will not be taken up for
six or seven weeks, as the season does
not open until November 2. In a general
Â¦nay I can say that the season will prob
ably be opened at Tanforan and it is also
likely we shall race either three weeks
or thirty days aJternately at the two
tracks. Before It was two weeks at each
track, which made frequent shipment of
horses necessary. We shall try to avoid
that as much as pcssible now that both
tracks are under one management.
"I met the Reiffs in England and they
said they would be here this winter. The
boys are doing great work. Little Maher,
I am afraid, cannot come out this winter,
as I understand he is afflicted with con
sumption. But, without saying anything
against New Orleans, I am sure we shall
have the best jockeys in the United States
here "this winter and the outline I have
given of the stables that will be repre
sented assures the highest class of rac
ing."
"With both tracks under control of the
New California Jockey Club we shall be
able to give better racing and better sport
this year than ever before in the history
of California. There will be about 150
days' racing next season, as against from
175 to ISO days when both tracks were
running. We shall "hang up* more money
this year In stakes and purses than ever
before, and already we have announced
556,000 in stakes. The Futurity advertised

By way of introduction to her defense
Mrs. Traver admitted that the land be
longed to Mrs. Finn, but, .she continued,
the building belonged to the Traver es
tate. She had paid out $130 on improve
ments, she said, and didn't intend to move
until she got he money back. J. J. Tra
ver, who secured a divorce from Mrs.
Traver last month because she horse
whipped him on the Mission road, took
the stand to prove that the lease had ex
pired. Mrs. Traver announced that she
liked his nerve and also referred to him
as "that man." Judge Graham took the
case under advisement.
Mrs. Annie V. Finn filed suit to eject
Mrs. Traver from the Mission street
home. Mrs.- Finn owns the ground upon
which the building is located. Years ago
she leased the land to J. C. Traver, fath
er-in-law of Mrs. Traver. The lease ex
pired some time ago and Mrs. Finn sought
to gain possession of the land. Mrs. Tra
ver refused to move and the suit re
sulted.
Mrs. Laura L. Traver, who J resides at
2627 Mission street, who has been di
vorced from three husbands and whose
life is replete with other episodes of-In

yesterday morning as her own attorney
in defense of her right to the home where
in she now resides.

They could not get a suitable vessel In
Seattle, so they decided to come to this
city and engage passage on a vessel from
here. They arrived here Wednesday and
engaged rooms at 54 Sixth street. Yester
day morning Liddel left the house and
shortly after he had gone Mrs. Bennett
discovered a letter that he had written to
her before leaving. In the letter Liddel
told her that he thought it would be im
prudent for them to go to Nome together,
so he had left her and had gone to Oak
land to engage a room there. He begged,
her not to worry, as he would advise her
as to his whereabouts. She believed that
he intended to abscond with her, money,
hence the warrant for Liddel's ' arrest.
The amount he is accused of embezzling
is $400, as she had got at various times
$100 from him to pay her expenses.
She decided to go to Nome to start a
boarding-house and took $500 in gold with
her. On the train to Seattle she met Lid
del, who is a good looking young fellow,
25 years of age. In conversation he told
her he was also going to Nome and they
became very friendly. When they reached
Seattle she had so much confidence in her
new-found friend that she gave him the
$500 to keep for her, as she thought it
would be safer in the money belt that
he wore around his waist than in her
purse.
Mrs. Bennett Is a handsome woman 2C
years of age. She has a husband and two
children in Los Angeles. She and her hus
band did not get along well together and
she decided to leave him and her children
and strike out for herself, as she felt that
she was quite competent to make a. way
for herself In the world without any man's
assistance.
Mrs. Amanda V. Bennett of Los Angeles
and at present residing at 54 Sixth street
secured a warrant from Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest of J. W. Liddel
on a charge of felony embezzlement. It
is another case of woman's confidence and
man's deceit.

The distinguished visitor returned his
thanks for the honor conferred and then
spoke for about half an hour. He com
mended the institution for the good work
it has been engaged in, and stated that
in view of the good it had hone he hoped
that a council will be instituted in every
parish in the jurisdiction and suggested
that each parish priest direct his efforts
in that direction. He expressed his satis
faction that the name had not been
changed, saying that previous to the vote
he had not expressed an opinion relative
to the matter, fearing that what he
might say might have influenced the dele
gates. He then delivered an eloquent ad
dress to Catholic young men and urged
them to do all in their power to build up
character.
The per capita tax was fixed at 90
cents for the Grand Council expenses, 35
cents for the educational bureau' and 30

There was an amendment to the consti

orary membership members of any eccle
siastical body, that honor having in the
past been limited to priests. (
At the afternoon session Supreme.Presi

The adoption of the memorial was fol
lowed by an eloquent eulogy upon the
life work of the deceased as a citizen of
California, as a member of the United
States Senate and as a member of the in

memory of one who was held In high
esteem by thousands of people who knew

Recommendations are made that there be a
rearrangement of desks where necessary to
secure a better light and seating; that a plen
tiful supply of modern maps be purchased at
a cost of about -$4000; that the course of study,
be revised In accordance with amendments to
State law and the experience of the past year,
and that such a classification of pupils be
made that first and eighth grade classes shall
not have an enrollment In excess of forty
pupils and other classes shall contain not more
than fifty pupils enrolled^
Sixty-five thousand dollars for a new build
ing for the Burnett School; $S5.000 for a new
building for the Washington School; $20,000
for a new building for the Bergerot School;
$35,000 for a new building: and lot for the Noe
Valley School; $20,0C0 for a new building and
lot for the Monroe School.
The Superintendent recommends in his
report that the Board of Education en
deavor to secure from the Board of Su
pervisors in the next annual municipal
budget appropriations as follows:
Urges Erection of New Schools.
The Sunnyside, Noe Valley. Jackson and
Bergerot schools occupy rented buildings and
premises, which are inadequate and not suited
for- the accommodation of pupils. Eighteen
rooms are rented for the accommodation of
children attending other schools, many of them
illy suited for school use. The Burnett School
is housed in a miserable wooden building. The
sanitary condition is deplorable.
The public school system of San Francisco
comprises four high schools, nineteen grammar
schools (including one cosmoDOlitan.- the
Adams), fifty-one primary (including one cos
mopolitan, the Humboldt. and one school for
Chinese children) and eight evening schools,
or a total of thirty-two schools. The Poly
technic-High School, no , less than the Lowell,
is in need of a new building. Additional
rooms should be built to the Hamilton, Haw
thorne, Hearst, Richmond. Golden Gate,
Crocker' and Dudley Stone school houses.
In the city of San Francisco the enforcement
of any compulsory educational law at this
time Is impossible. Over 19,000 children were
reported by the census marshals as having at
tended no school during the year terminating
May 1, 1900. Were 10 per cent of this number
forced to attend the public schools there would
be - no accommodations for them, unless the
Board of Education should rent buildings and
rooms and engage forty additional teachers.
This would tax the appropriation allowed by
the Board of Supervisors for the support of
schools during the fiscal year. To enforce then
a compulsory educational law in the city and
county of San Francisco would necessitate the
construction of buildings capable of contain
ing at least 6000 additional children, besides
the establishment of truant and parental
schools.
Enforcement of Compulsory Law.
The comDulsory education law should be
amended bo. as to regulate the employment of
minors and to fine those unlawfully employing
them; to. provide for the appointment of at
tendance or truant officers, and the arrest and
punishment of truants, and for the establish
ment and maintenance of truant or parental
schools. The experience of the deputy super
intendents of this city and of myself em
phatically demonstrates the necessity for truant
or parental schools.
Superintendent of Schools Webster filed
his annual report on the public schools
with the. Board of .Education yesterday.
The report contains valuable information
regarding the census, population and
school attendance. Webster again rec
ommends a lower classification, a more
rigid enforcement of the compulsory edu
cation law and the establishment of pa
rental schools. He notes the interesting
fact which was given publicity in this
paper recently that the public schools are
losing pupils. In the fiscal year just end
ed the average daily attendance has been
34,771, a loss of 233 from the year previous.
The attendance at private schools has in
creased from 9311 last year to 10,856 this
year. The attendance at high schools has
dropped from .1429 to 12SL The report
says:
Reiterates Former Request
for a Lower Class
Enrollment.
He Recommends the Re
vision of the Course
of Study.

The big white tents of the Ringling

will become a part of San Francisco early
Sunday morning. The show grounds, be

small boys will gather and gaze and chat

ures they present, the huge arenic .tent,
necessary for three circus rings, three big
stages, a racing oval one-quarter of -a

people, all of these items are of important
account in showing the evolution of the
circus under the direction of the Ring
ling brothers. . -

length and subdivided into thirty sections.
There; will be a military display, com-,
