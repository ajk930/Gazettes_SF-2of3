the risk of a popular rising be run by
treating deliberate and crime-stained
treason as a venial offense. The speaker

J
Effort Will Be Made to Have
a New Government De
partment.
BOISE. Waho. July 23.â The fourth an
nual session of the International Alining
Congress convened this morning. Tho
meeting opened with an address of wel
come by Governor Hunt. He was followed
by Mayor Alexander, who tendered the
keys of the city to the visitors.
Judge J. H. Richards welcomed the ccn
gress on behalf of the citizens and deliv
ered an address that attracted much at
tention. Responses were made by E L
Shafner of Cleveland. Ohio; Professor W*
N. Tidballa of Salt Lake and Thomas Ew
ins of Los Angeles.
President L. Bradford Prince of New
Mexico then delivered hi3 annual address.
He reviewed the previous sessions and
spoke of the work to be done. Prince
stated that the principal object of the
congress was to secure the establishment
of a department of mines. He said it was
necessary, and that the great industry
ought to have such recognition in orde*
that it3 development might go forward
at a pace that would keep it abreast of
development along other lines. There
were many problems confronting the in
dustry;, he said, that could not be solved
satisfactorily without the direct aid that
could be given through a Government de
partment of mines.
Delegate Moore of Colorado offered the
following^ which was referred to the com
mittee on resolutions:
Resolved* That tha International Mining
Congress, assemble^ at Boise. Idaho, extends to
the president and directors of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition Its fraternal greeting ar.il
promises for it an aclive and continued interest
and support. We a.^so urge upon the Legisla
tures of the several States such a generous
financial recognition of the coming- exposition
as shall contribute materially to Its already
assured success.
There is a lively rivalry between Los
Angeles andTJtctte for the next session,
j of the congress. Both are claiming they
will win, and it is as yet Impossible to
form an opinion as to the result. Joseph
N. Hutehinson, ex-LJeutenant Governor
of Idaho, is much talked of for president
I 1 of the congress.
This evening the "delegates were ten
dered a reception at the City Hall by the
Governor, Chamber of Commerce and "Wo
man's Columbian Club.

Attention, CmÂ£ens I
Admiral A^B. K. BenUam, retired;- Rear
Admiral F.- M. Raimay.i retired; Captain
B.'F.Lamberton,' judge advocate.
The court will be instructed by Secre
tary Long, in view of the purpose Â«f
Admiral Schley to ask for an. investiga
tion of all matters, to inquire especially
with- .- reference to these points-:-. Diil
Admiral Schley unnecessarily . dÂ«lay his
departure from Cienfuegos for Santiago
da Cuba, where he waa advised that the
Spanish fleet had taken refuge? Was
Admiral Schley â¢ g:uilty oÂ£ . reprehensible
conduct In issuing orders for and starting
with the squadron under his command for
Key WeBt after having* arrived south of
Santiago de Cuba? If not guilty, of repre
hensible conduct, did he. not commit a
grave error of judgment? â¢ Was Admiral
Schley justified in bombarding the harbor
of Santiago after heifinally reached that
point-at a range of more than five miles?
Was^the blockade he established before
he was superseded' in" command of the
squadron by Rear, Admiral * Sampson
effective? In the battle of Santiago de
Cuba; was the order for the celebrated
loop- made by the Brooklyn Issued - by
Admiral Schley or Captain Cook? Did
Admiral Schley actually command and
did.be give orders to other vessels of. the
squadron. * during the- battle* or 'was
Admiral Sampson actually in command?
It is evident from the list- of matters
which, the court will have- to investigate
that it will enter upon a most serioua and
lengthy inquiry.' Navy regulations ' pro
vide'that courts Qf.mjjnlry ; shall hayo
power to summon witnesses. If the court
finds Admiral Schley ginlty â¢ of reprehen
sible^ conduct,, it , may. - recommend . his
court-martial, and this may lead to his
dismissal from the- service. Â¦ Â¦â¢Â¦- â¢Â¦ Â¦ -. . â¢
If to -proposed by the- authorities ta. loso

application of Rear Admiral Schley f has

IT looked as though the early days of
the war were back aj?ain at the army
transport wharf yesterday. When an
inspection of the steamship that drew
the crowd to the front was made,
however, all thought of war vanished. In
stead of men in khaki, the decks of the
Thomas were crowded with men and
women b^ind for the Philippines to act
cs teachers In the Government schools.
Not a soldier uniform was to be seen on
the transport a.e she steamed away, and,
all told, there were not a dozen men In
uniform on the wharf to see the vessel
away.
The relatives and friends of the pas
sengers made np for the lack of military
display/They came down in droves, and
the big wharf was crowded an hour be
fore sailing time. A great'disappointment
awaited them, however. . The teachers
were put aboard as soon as their trunks
were shipped, atd besifiÂ«s them not a soul
was allowed up the gangway. Nearly all
the farewells, therefore, had to be safd at
long: distance.
Owing to the rush of Epworth Leaguers
many of the teachers did . not get their
trunks In time and had to sail without
them. They will be looked after by the
army officials and the trunks will be for
warded on the Kilpatrick next Thursday
week. There was one woman whose
trunks went away, 'and she got a much
desired trip to Manila in consequence. F.
Braucht and wife came out here from
the East with the Epworth League. He
was under contract to go to the Philip
pines for the Government, but transporta
tion was refused the wife and she was
going back home. When the trunks were
sent away from the hotel Braucht gave
instructions for hiÂ£ wife's to be taken to
the ferry depot and his to the transport
wharf. . The expressman took all the
trunks to the transport wharf and they
were put down in the hold of the Thomas.
â¢When Mrs. Eraucht inquired for her
trunks at the ferries she was told they
had not arrived. Luckily she met the ex
pressman and he told her where they
wÂ£re. When she reached the wharf the
Thomas Â¦ had pulled out Into the stream.
She explained the case to Superintendent
of Dock Scott end he sÂ£nt her out In the
launch. On tha -Thomas the freight clerk
said the trunks were aboard but could
not be got at. The matter was reported
to the quartermaster captain, but he re
fused to give the woman j, passage. Then
Mrs. Braucht explained to him that every
stitch of her rlothes. and all the money
she had to - get- back home with were In
her, trunks and valise. The captain re
lented and consented to take her along, so
owing to the lucky mistake of the ex
pressman Mrs. Braucht Is now accompa
nying her husband to Manila instead of
returning to her lonely home in Michigan.
Owing to the fact that no outsiders
were allowed rboard the Thomas for
hours before sailing -time only one stow
atray was found. * He was a well-dressed,
respectable looking man, who effered to
pay bis way as sdon as he was discov-

FORT SILL, O. T.^ July 23.â A law and
order league has been formed to suppress
the dozens of crooks who \ have Infested
the country since the Kiowa-Comanche
registration began. The organization has.
decided to print and distribute 10,000 hand
bills bearing the following:
"Notice is hereby served on all confi
dence men, pickpockets, thieves and
crooks who are caught plying their voca
tion that they will be hanged to the near

WASHINGTON, July 23.â Secretary
Hitchcock said .to-day, 'with Reference to
the effort to prevent tire opening of the
Oklahoma Indian lands to- settlement by
injnnction proceedings at El Reno, that
the preparations of the department for j
the opening would proceed as If no suit
had been begun.
"We shall not let the matter go by de
fault," he said, "but we apprehend no
obstacle from that proceeding. Any one
can bring a suit." â¢ â¢ ; Â» -
The Secretary to-day took cognizance
of reports coming from Oklahoma that
the men who are registering: at El Keno
and Fort Sill are doing so with the inten
tion of transferring their rights to others.
"The report," he said, "is to* the effect
that they can and will dispose of their
numbers at enormous profits. This Is ab
surd, because it is impossible under the
regulations for them to transfer their
rights. . I?or._ any., of them . to. attempt to
do, so would be a. jelear violation of the
law. They take an oath not to do such a
thing and to use their rights for their
own. exclusive- benefit. There can be no
speculation In these numbers."
The Secretary- also said that reports are
coming to the department for schemes of
disposing of numbers of town sites, the
promoters offering chances to the public.
( "The only town sites which have been
authorized," the Secretary said, "are
those of the three county seats. No others
have been- sanctioned* and no one knows
where others will be. Hence all except
those three are bogus and reports of their
establishment should t>e denounced as in

Disease in Human Beings
Different From That in
Animals. , :
LONDON, July 23.â A feature of to
day's session of the British Congress of
Tuberculosis was Professor Koch's paper,
which was listened to with the deepest in
terest by the big gathering In St. James
Hall. -.- â¢ '
Lord Lister Introduced the noted Ger
man professor to the assembly with a few
complimentaryâ words. During- his ad
dress Dr. Koch said his experiments had
satisfied him that human tuberculosis and
bovine tuberculosis were radically differ
ent diseases and that he had amply dem
onstrated that cattle could not be Infect
ed with human tuberculosis. The coun
ter propositioA that human beings, were
not liable to infection from bovine tuber
culosis was hard to prove, the doctor said,
owtng to the difficulty of experimenting
upon human subjects, but,,; personally he
was satisfied .such was the case, and he
recited at- length' the post-mortem evi
dence supporting this Delief. Dr. Koch
said if this point ' were j conceded it raÂ» ;
mained to determine the chief satireÂ© of
contagion. ""'Â¦- â¢'.'
Continuing, 'he said that human Im
munity to bovia* infection disposed of the
belief of infection through' dairy products
and he â¢ considered this source of . danger '
so, slight- as to be unworthy of precaur
tlonary measures. â¢ Â¦' â¢Â¦>.''
Heredity wsts also an unimportant
factor In the transmission, of tuberculosis,
. though the! contrary had Ions been be
lieved. Dr. Koch said the chief danger of
contagion lay in. the sputum of consump
tive patients, and that a remedy was to
be found In a law Â¦ preventing the con
sumptive from strewing contagion about:
him-._ Several methods to this end. were
available said the doctor, the surest j of
which la isolation in sanitariums.. This,
unfortunately, was impracticable, -but he
strongly â¢ > urged the establishment of
special consumptive hospitals and the.
obligatory notification of the authorities
of the existence of the disease, the dis
infection of their quarters whenever con
sumptives changed their residence, and the
dissemination of Information to the peo
ple- concerning the true nature of con
sumption, to aid in avoiding and combat
ing it , Â¦ . , . .-;:
Dr. Koch highly complimented Dr.
Herman M. Biggs, pathologist and' ;â¢ di
rector of th-e bacteriological laboratoriea
of the New ,-York Health Department,
upon' the repressive .measures concerning
tuberculosis taken in . New York,
where, he. said, the mortality from tuber
culosis had -.been' reduced- 35 per centslnce
18S6. and recommended the system organ
ized by Dr. Biggs in New. York to the
B.tudy and imitation of all municipalities.
Dr.- Koch closed his remarks by "express-
Ing his- belief thatithe ultimate stamping
out of tuberculosis was. possible. ' . : -

memory to the thousands who were con

It was San Francisco day at the Pavil

Association building to-day, where the
final business will be concluded.-
The organ recital given by the Epworth
League executive committee to the pub
lic attracted fully 5000 people to the Pa
vilion last night. The announcement that
the entertainment would be free proved
irresistible to the thousands who. desired
to hear the famous Stanford organ, and
the result was most gratifying to the com
mittee.
'inousands of people were In the build
ing when Organist W. B. King struck the
fjrst note of a fantasia. Within a few
minutes the galleries, the space given up
to the chorus during the convention and
the auditorium chairs began to flil with
the admiring multitude. The applause
that greeted each number Was most gen
erous. A number of grand choruses were
included in the extempore programme and
all were received with fervor. Organist
King-was at nis best, and his manipula
tion of the instrument was all that could
be desired. It was after 10 o'clock when
the final note was struck and the audience
dispersed.' .
The finance committee has addressed an
appeal to Chinese Consul General Ho Tow
for a contribulion to the entertainment
fund, which was assured the committee
some time ago.' A substantial donation
was promised.

DELEGATES.
big building .was thronged by thousands,
who listened to the music of the grand
organ as they inspected the county and
other exhibits on the gallery floor. There
was much for the careful housewife to
see, and the critical tasting of prunes,
cooked in a dozen different ways, and the
munching of seedless Fresno raisins were
pleasures freely indulged in by the fem
inine contingent of San Franciscans' who
made the Pavilion their headquarters dur
ing the day.
There was little of interest to transpire
In the rooms of the general committee.
The place was practically deserted and
few of the white-capped aids were In evi
dence. Chairman Kingsbury of the reg
istration committee finally completed his
list during the afternoon, and it showed
that 19.047 leaguers had registered during
the last week. The total Christian En
deavor registration was 28,000. but as this
embraced members of all Protestant de
nominations, and the Epworth League is
composed of Methodists only, the latter,
comparatively, was by far the more suc
cessful."
Probably Small Surplus.
The Rev. Thomas Filben, chairman of'
the â¢ general ' committee, left for Pacific
Grove yesterday to preside at the opening
session of the Chautauqua convention, of.
which he is chairman. He will return to
morrow, when a council of the sub-com
mittee chairmen will be held. The report
of the finance committee will then be of
fered. It is expected that there will be a
surplus, but It will doubtless be an insig
nificant one. Nearly $30,000 was raised by
the committee, and the expenses kept
pace with the rpceipts.
Two-thirds of the Leaguers have al
ready departedfor their homes, notwith

San Bernardino Woman Pluckily
Puts to Flight a Supposed
Incendiary.
SAX BERNARDINO. July 23.âBeliev
ing that Jesus Moreno had come to burn
her home, Mrs. Manuel Quintana dis
charged the contents of a double-barreled
shotgun at his iftreating form shortly be
fore dark last evening, and thp. fact that
Moreno was not a subject for the Coroner
to-day was noc the fault of the -plucky
woman.
There was a serious stabbing affray at
Mrs. Quintana's home two weeks ago. in
which the participants were her liege lord
and Moreno. The latter was considerably
worsted in the fight and left the place
declaring he would return and set fire to
the house. He disappeared and was seen
no more until lact evening. â¢
When he eqtered the yard Mrs. Quin
tana saw him. and his threat of two
weeks ago quickly - flashed through her
mind. Supposing that Moreno had come
back to make good his vow she did not
wait for any :ormal greeting, but seized
a shotgun and blazed away. Moreno saw
that something was doing, and by the
time the woman was behind the gun he
was beating a retreat. It is not believed
that any shot took effect.

County's lone highwayman, he who robbed
two stages neer Ukiah several days ago,
has transferred his operations to the coast
region. At least it is presumed that the
outlaw who to-day held up the coach that
runs between Mendocino and. Cazadero is
the same man who relieved about twenty
summer resorters from San Francisco and
vicinity of their wealth near the. county
seat. To-day he demonstrated that there
is something- of the "gentleman road
agent" in hiÂ« make-up, for when he
learned that the passengers of the Men
docino-Cazadero stage were workingmen
he refused to take what coin they may
have had about them.
The stage was stopped at Dark Gulch,
five miles south of here, at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. It is evident that the high
wayman is a stranger in this vicinity, else
he would have known that for several
years this line has carried no Wells-Fargo
box. When the driver had obeyed the
command to stop the highwayman ordered
him to throw out the express box. He
was told that tnere was none aboard, but
declined to take the word of the driver,
making: a personal investigation of the
coach to satisfy himself that tne reins
man was telling the truth.
There were three passengers on the
stage. These were compelled to hold up
their hands wJiile the investigation was
proceeding. When he had satisfied him
self that there was no express on the
Etape the robber asked of the passengers:
"Are you fellows workingmen?"
"Do we look like millionaires?"' retorted
one of the tri-Â». while another, fearing to
arouse the highwayman, answered that
all three were toilers.
"You mar ko. I never rob a working
man," said the outlaw, Â¦waving his hand
ahead as a command for the driver to
start his horses.
The robber was" armed with a single
barreled shotgun and masked with a
bandana handkerchief. He was of me
dium height and weighi. and the driver
pays his hair was short and curly. There
is only one detail that combats the belief
that he is the man who robbed the Ukiah
Fiage. That 5s that he appeared to be
somewhat nervous, while the Ukiah toll
- collector was the acme of good nature
and coolness, "Â»-ho seemed to regard the
levying of an enforced assessment against
well-to-do outing tourists as a matter of
course, and. something to be treated as
in the nature ct a joke.
Officers have gone to the scene of the
hold-up, but there is little likelihood that
they will effect the capture of the outlaw,
as the country fs> very wild and affords
pplendld cover, while in all probability he
is now far from the scene of his attempt
ed robbery. Stage owners are now wonder
ing where he will next appear. It is like
ly that shotgun messengers will soon be
riding on all at the coaches running in
this region.

Â¦ SACRAMENTO. July 23.â Superior Judge
E. C. Hart to-day sentenced Roy Fahey,
a footpad, to the Folsom State Prison for
life. In doing so Judge Hart served no
tice upon all criminals of Fahey's class
that they need expect no mercy at his
hands should they be brought before the
bar of his court. Fahey was convicted a
few days ago of having held up and
robbed A. L. Fortson. telegraph editor of
the Record Union, while the latter was
on his way home from his work. Enright,
a companion of Fahey In recent robberies,
has pleaded guilty, but it is expected that
small mercy v.-ill be shown him when he
comes up for sentence on Saturday.
In consigning Fahey to imprisonment
for the rest of his life Judge Hart said:'
You and Enrleht evidently were strangers
to this Jurisdiction. When you came here to
ply your unlawful vocation you were evidently
not familiar with the policy which has been
established and followed by this court, of
Inflicting the severest penalty for offenses such
as the one in which you are involved before
the court now. It has been the policy of the
court to show no leniency to. a man "who will
go out into the dark and conceal his identity,
stand in a corner with a weaponâ a slungshot
or something of that sortâ for the purpose of
striking and perhaps killing or shooting some
citizen of the community â some honest, honor
able citizen who works hard to accumulate*the
little that he has. It you had been familiar
with the policy of this court on these questions,
probably you would not nave come here.
Citizens of this community do not want your
kind of people, here. We are a civilized com
munity here in California; we have civilized
laws; we have civilized manners and civilized
ways; we want no outlaws here.. My Idea is,
and always has been, that there are no spe
cial circumstances which should appeal to a
court In a. case of highway robbery or mid
night burgrlary. and as long as I am on this
bench I do not propoee to exercise any degree
of leniency in cases of highway robbery or
midnight burglary. It has got to be stopped
In this community, if it can be done through
the instrumentality of this court.
Fahey' took his sentence without visible
emotion. lie and Enright have a hard
record in the Northwest.
It is. therefore, the Judgment of this court
that you be confined in the State prison at Fol
s=om for the term of your natural life.

In Epworth League excursion tickets In

damage to the company through the op

The "scalpers" contend that the com

of by refusing to recognize any tickets
that may have come through the hands
of the "scalpers" and may eject passen
gers riding on such tickets.' Such a rem
edy being in the hands of the railroad's

rest of a man and woman named Farenna
in Jackson, Amador County, for allowing
a five-year-old" girl who was with them
to give public exhibition of snake charm
ing. Suspicion has also been aroused that
the child is one which has been kidnaped.
The little girl is compelled to handle and
twine about herself a score of reptiles,
while the man and the woman collect con
tributions from the spectators. As a cul
minating act she takes the head of a
huge copperhead in her mouth.
It is stated that she is weak mentally
and physically and entirely unfitted to do
the work to which she is driven. She
bears not the slightest resemblance to the
people who claim to be her parents, but
she is not competent to tell anything
about herself. A strong effort will, be
made to rescue her from her position and
place her with people who will take care
of her. -

The Yacht Shows Marvelous
Speed in an Interesting
Race.
â¢ Â¦ .. *_
NEW HAVEN, Conn., July Again
to-day did the Constitution prove speedier
than the Columbia in light airs and fluky
weather. It was in the first squadron run
of the Xew York Yacht Club from Hunt
ington to Morris Cove, and the day was
remarkable for the wind, which boxed
the compass completely from east-north
east to west-southwest, from 9 o'clock in
Uro morning until 7 o'clock in the evening.
For the greater part of the run the
yachts had a etrong flood tide against
them, and at times they barely made
headway against it. The yachts started
out close-hauled. The wind grew free end
sheets were eased broad off and ballcoa
ers spread.
The Constitution crossed the starting
line first at 11:35:25. the Columbia follow
ing at 11:35:53. the Constitution having the
windward position and quickly overtaking
the large fleet which had got away
earlier. The wind was so gentle that It
barely filled the^ lower sailE of the big
f loops and they seemed to derive most of
their headway from the huge club top
sails which were full when the other
sails were flapping.
As the wind shifted canvas was trimmed
to meet it. At 1 o'clock, while the Consti
tution was becalmed, the Columbia got a
lucky streak of wind and ran past her
rival and secured a lead of a quarter of
a mile. Her advantage was short lived,
however, for at 1:35 the wind once again
lilled'the Constitution's sails and she,
glided to the front In a marvelous manner
and maintained her lead to the finish,
increasing it constantly. On elapsed time
she won by five minutes and sixteen
seconds, and by four minutes, six seconds
corrected time, the length of the course
being twenty-eight miles.
CLEVELAND, July 23.â To-day's strong
card at the .Grand Circuit races brought
out an immense crowd. The weather and
track conditions were perfect. In the first
race, the 2:14 trot, Dr. Book/ -went to' the
post a strong fayorite at even money. He
won the first heat with speed to spare. In
the second heat he fairly romped in, a
winner by three lengths, but the best he
could do in the third heat was third place.
The Judges did not like. the way Durfee
handled Dr. Book in the. third heat and
he was called before the stand, fined $100
and forced to give up the pole. In the
fourth heat Durfee was taken down and
Kenny substituted. The judges announced
that this punishment was enforced upon
Durfee foj improper driving. After the
third heat all non-winners were retired to
the barn. This left Janice, Dr. Book and
Palm Leaf to battle for the money. Palm
Leaf went out and won in straight heats.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 23.-W. G. \an
Vleck, manager of the- Southern Pacific
transportation department, who was here
to-day, said that arrangements are belns
perfected as rapidly as possible for the
use of Beaumont oil for fuel In all the
locomotives of that system. It Is proposed
to first equip the locomotives operating
on the divisions between New Orleans
and Houston with the new fuel, and when
this has been done the locomotives run
ning between Houston and San Antonio
will be likewise equipped.
The company is also preparing to burn
oil In the locomotives on all the divisions
west of El Paso. Already oil Is being
used on about 900 miles of the system in
California. Two hundred thousand bar
rels of the Beaumont oil has just been
shipped to Phoenix. Ariz., where It was
placed In storage tanks, to be used by the
company. The company is boring its own
oil wells in the Beaumont fluid. It is esti
mated that these wells will furnish more
than enough oil for all the locomotives on
the whole Southern Pacific system.
The company Is also constructing four
large oil storage tanks, each with a ca
pacity of more than 1.200,000 gallons. These
tanks are located at Houston, Beaumont,
Lafayette and Algiers. Tanks will be
erected at San Antonio, El Paso and
points west of there.
Manager Van Vleck says that there is
no scarcity of tank cars with which Co
har.dle the Beaumont oil. There are
about 1000 tank cars available for mov
ing the Beaumont product. Each of tho
principal railway companies of the State
has placed large orders with car manu
facturers for several hundred additional
oil tank cars to be used in the Beaumont
oil trade. __

The feature of thÂ» social side of the big
gathering was the first big outdoor event,
the magnificent parade of military and

the principal streets this afternoon. The
pageant was witnessed by many thou

ELKS SELECT
NEW OFFICERS
The Amalgamated men say .that the
Mayor has no authority to forbid free
speech, and if he orders men not to talk
to non-unionists on- the street the order la
not to be obeyed.
"What I did say to the men was that
members of the association must not take
hold of any man's. coat and hold him
while talking to him. I told them it was
better to go to a man's house and talk to
him than to gather a crowd on the
street."
The Mayor said neither Manager Brook
man nor any one else had put him up to
advising the men not to talk, though
Brookman had telephoned him that Rum
baugh had interfered with a man - who
was on his way to work.
According to strike leaders the officials
of the Wellsville district are apparently
seeking to bring on an open conflict in
order to invoke the aid of the Sheriff's
deputies, and if possible the militia. Earn
est and renewed warnings have been sent
to the strikers to remain cool and keep
within the law.
There was much Indignation among the
strikers to-day over a report that Mayor
A. P. Dennis had called two strikers, Pat
rick O'Connor and Daniel Rumbaugh, be
fore him and had forbidden them to talk
to men on the way to the -mill in the ef
fort to keep them from going to work.
Vice President Chappelle of the Amalga
mated Association immediately sought
the Mayor and asked him what he meant
by trying to abridge the right of free
speech. Mayor Dennis denied that he had
forbidden the strikers to talk, and said:
The application for an injunction may
be made in the United States District
Court, and at first will apply only to
Wellsville, but it is believed the plan is
to pursue similar tactics at McKeesport
and other places where necessary.
â¢ A rumor is In circulation that a carload
of men will run into Wellsville to-morrow
to supplement the force now at work.
This latter story has not been verified up
to midnight. Outside of these incidents
the actual strike status is unchanged. . . '
PITTSBURG, July 23.â The combine
forces have decided to carry the strike
into the courts. It is learned to-day that
former Judge Mills of Wellsville, Ohio,
has been retained by Percifer M. Smith,
district manager of the American Sheet
Steel Company, to prepare papers for pre
sentation within a few days to a Federal
court asking for a restraining order to
stop strikers from accosting' or molesting:
in any way non-union men on the high
ways. The move promises a crisis in the
strike, thus far one of watchfulness and
waiting.

pany, better known as the "Capitol Syn

mated to be valued at between $8,
000,000 and $10,000,000. has passed into the

In behalf of Margaret Ann Babcock and
Maurice B. Brown of Chicago, who t are
reported to be minority stockholders.
Judge Wallace to-day appointed J. V.

illegally leased to themselves the land and
cattle of the corporation, and that they
turned the ranch and cattle over to them

The further allegation is made that they
ere selling the best portion of the ranch,
which is well watered, to the detriment of
the ranch property as a whole. In addi

Republican Primary League Club No. ,
2 has been organized in the Thirty-ninth
District, with James Cosgrave. president;
Ralph IC. Falke, secretary, and Phineas
A Barker as treasurer. A general meet
ing of the club will be held Friday even
ing, July 26. at 335 McAllister street, be
tween Larkin and Polk.
Candidate for Governor.
E. B. Edson of Siskiyou, president of
the Board of Railroad Commissioners. Is
In the city, but is not taking a hand in
the municipal contest. Mr. Edson has
many friends in Northern California, who
would like to see him in the race for the
Thirty-Ninth District.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the Republican Primary League Club,
Thirty-sixth Assembly District, was held
Monday evening at the hall, corner Twen
tieth and Guerrero streets. The hall has
been secured as the permanent headquar
ters of the league club, and the roll will
be open every evening for signatures be
tween the hours of 8 and 10 o'clock. It
was resolved to have a general meeting
of the club Tuesday evening, July 30,
when good speakers will address the mem
bers and a varied entertainment will be
furnished. The following resolution was
adopted:
Resolved, That the combination of Kelly and
Crimmins with the boss and machine politicians
of the State and their interference in municipal
affairs Is detrimental to the best interests of
the Republican party. This club favors a clean
yet liberal, policy in municipal affairs, and
commends the strong- and independent stand of
the Republican Primary League for home rule
In politics.
Thirty-Sixth. District.
THE Kelly-Crimmlns-Gage alliance
is not enlisting the support of po
litical workers. It is pretty gener
ally known that Martin Kelly has
no patronage to plve out. Layer
after layer of promises have been given
for every position in sight. Hundreds if
not thousands who were promised places
during the prolonged Senatorial campaign
ore still waiting for the bosses to "make
pood." The workers will not be fooled
again by this kind of a confidence game.
Herrin can g^ve his "moral support" to
the boss alliance, but he cannot give
transportation or bestow railroad favors.
President Hays has cut off the political
supplies of the law department of the
Southern Pacific. The bosses would like
to make the party workers believe that
great rewards of patronage are to be
given to those who get in behind Kelly
nnd Crimmins, but the promises are only
hot air.
Republican. Primary League.
Ths anti-boss campaign under the aus
pices of the Republican Primary League,
headquarters 930 Market street, is gaining
favor and influence every day. The
league rooms are crowded every night
Â¦with earnest and energetic citizens, who
are determined to make a winning contest
for clean local government under Repub
lican auspices. Encouraging reports come
from all of the districts. The fact is
clearly understood that the allied bosses
by cunning and adroit tactics will en
deavor to win by giving help to independ
ent clubs where an open tight would be
hopeless. For example, in the Foriy-flrst
District overtures have been made to the
Central Republican Club, of which Horace
Davis is president. The propositions were
promptly rejected and the fight comes
down to a plain issue, with the good citi
zens on one s'de and the bosses on the
other. Burns has promised to deliver the
Forty-first delegation to the allied bosses.
Mass-meetings of anti-boss citizens of the
district will be called to rally all the
forces in favor of clean politics.
Forty-Second District.
The Republican club of the Forty-sec
ond District organized under the auspices
of the Primary League has established
permanent headquarters at 1206 Golden
Gate avenue, corner 1 of Market street.
The officers are R. B. Treat, president,
and J. E. Sllnkey, secretary. The club
will meet at Golden Gate Hall Friday
evening of this week. Eloquent speakers
will address the meeting.
Supervisor C. W. Reed, who was pres
ent, made an earnest speech foÂ» action by
the old time Democrats and urged the
needs of municipal ownership of public
utilities. The speaker paid his respects
to "the high priests of purity and the pro
fessional reformers" of the Democracy at
the last election. .
The club unanimously voted that a
ticket be prepared for the primary elec
tion and that a committee be appointed to
confer with the officers of the club in
Eelecting the delegates. President Egan
appointed as a committee the following
gentlemen: J. J. McCarthy, Thomas W.
Burke. Edward Franks, H. I. Mulcreavy
and Frank Skelly. The meeting adjourned
subject to the call of the president.
The members of the Valley DemocratU
Club of the Thirty-seventh District were
pronounced in expressing their opposition
to the Phelan political party at a meeting
held last evening at Mowry's Hall, Grove
and Laguna. streets.
President W. J. Egan called the meet
ing to order and desired to hear from
those present whether it was desirable to
place a ticket in the field for the forth
coming primary election, as opposed to
the machine Democratic ticket to be put
forward by the Phelanites.
Enthusiastic speeches were made by
Messrs. H. I. Mulcreavy, John McCann,
J. J. McCarthy, Fred Mack and George
Lacombe, all favoring Independent action
by the club and the nominating of a
ticket. T. W. Burke, for reasons not ex
plained, opposed a. ticket in opposition to
the Phelanites and called down the
wrath of the other speakers.

HER LAST NOBLEMAN.
Norway, it appears, has just lost the
only nobleman in her possession. Baron
Wedel- Jarlsberg is dead, and with him
passes away the last vestige of hereditary
institutions in that democratic country.
There is always the King, of course; but
he must be beginning to feel a bit lonely.
Baron Wedel- Jarlsbergr was born in the
year of Waterloo, and' served with the
Norwegian navy, for sixty-nine years.
In 1849, during the first Schleswig war
the Baron had an exciting experience. He
had y commission on the great battleship
Christian VIII. At the crowning moment
of the good battleship's fate yo*ing Wedel-
Jarlsberg, like the Maclean at the flood,
happened to be in a boat of his own He
was not killed, therefore, when the Chris,
tian VIII 'was blown sky hlg-h' â¢ by the
Prussians, though he ; lost his boat and
had to swim ashore and be captured^. That
incident must have lit for him many dull
years, for the history of the Norwegian
navy has not : been a very exciting one
But what a> queer people the Norwegians
are. As democrats- they an$ . certainly

The idea that a mail driver may safely violate and
defy local law, hedged about by the divinity that doth
belong to mail in transit, has no foundation in law.
Interference with the mail, to be punishable by the
Federal statute, must be for a purpose lawless per se.
The immunity of the mail is not intended to cover and
protect the violation of law. If the animals which
pull the mail wagons are in such condition that to use
them is a violation of the laws of California, those
laws may be enforced, and the contractor under his
bond cannot plead that enforcement of law as a rea
son for failure to deliver the .mail.- He can get out
and pull -the wagon himself, or take the mail on his
back.
There is no Federal statute. of cruelty _ to animals,"
but that is no reason why he should be cruel to his
beasts. The postmaster states thai the mail con
tractor took his contract at so low a figure that he
cannot afford to use wf!ole horses, as .that would ab
sorb all of his profits. * Surely it is an abnormal situ
ation' that a Fedf:r?.l contractor is justified in making
his profits out of the raw withers, shoulders and backs
of suffering horses. "*f
Suppose that this contractor while driving mail on
the streets of Oakland should proceed to murder
some one. in the mail wagon, would the police-stand
off and see the crime finished because to stop it would^
interfere with the mails?
THE Society for the Prevention^ of Cruelty to
Animals in Oakland is studying a problem that
so far has resisted solution. It is
alleged that the horses used by the contractor for
carrying mails between the trains and the postoffi.ee
are afflicted with raw shoulders and backs, and are
otherwise in a condition unfit for service, their use
constituting a legal offense. The contractor, how
ever, defies' any attempt to interfere with his use of:
these horses, because he carries the mail, and Federal
law forbids interference with the United States mail.

dergone ' a good many changes since a 'Rex A"n
glorum' was crowned at Westminster in 1066. The
first Edward was called 'Rex Angliae,. Dominus Hi
berniae.et Dux, s Aquitaniae,' leaving out 'Dux Nor

third Edward made a further change to 'Dei Gratia,
Rex Angliae et Frar.ciae ' et . . Dominus Hiberniae.'
Queen Elizabeth was the first monarch to adopt an
English description, 'Queen of England, France and
Ireland, Defender of the Faith,' and James I of course
added Scotland. The title of King of France was dis
continued by George III, just a hundred years ago,
and no further alteration was made in the royal title
until Queen Victoria added 'Empress of India/' in
1876." \ '. - .;Â¦ /

EDWARD'S NEW TITLE.
Blue Lake Advocate.
Ttie Call in several recent articles has
directed the attention of the people to the
proposed constitutional amendment to be
submitted to a vote at the next election.
The amendment provides for a commis
sion of five pultons clothed with authority
to regulate telegraph, telephone, light,
power, transportation, sleeping cars, ex
press companies aha other corporations.
The State is to be divided into five dis
tricts, each of which shall choose a mem
ber of the "commission, except that the
Governor shall appoint the first lot; of
commissioners. These are to be appointed
one to hold office for two years, one for
four years, one . for six years, one for
eight years and one for ten years." After
that each one will be elected for the full
term of ten years, with a salary of $6000
per year. The Call is strongly opposed to
the scheme and justly so for many rea
sons Which we will not /urge now. It is a
long time to the election when the people
will be required to vote on the measure.
Whatever might be said now will prob
ably be forgotten, so -the arguments pro
and con will be deferred until later. It Is
well, however, to' let the people- know that
such a proposition is pending. /

hot spell in New York, but one of the best is to the
effect that two children fell from a third story window

knocked her off her perch', and all three landed safely
and unhurt on the ground. Possibly their bones were

regarded as. a mere subordinate to Cleveland. It re
mains to be seen how big a man he will look when
he stands aloner '._ ... ...
Public attention was first directed to him by the
facfthat David Bennett Hill has of late been making
frequent visits to Lamont's country home, and the
visits' have been long as well as frequent. To the
acute eyes of New York politicians it Js 'evident that

opponents of Cleveland in New York politics, while
Lamont was always 1 Cleveland's personal as well as
political friend. The consultations now going on be
tween the two are therefore regarded as evidence that
all the old crowd are going to drop past quarrels and
unite for the purpose of getting rid of Bryan and also
of Croker. It is believed in New York that Hill
knows he cannot make a winning fight as a candidate,
and is therefore quite willing to combine with the
Cleveland crowd and support Lamont. \
Such is the latest development of midsummer poli
tics in the far East. Dan Lamont would indeed be a
Ever since the- close of the Cleveland regime at
Washington Lamont has been busy making money,
and is now reported to be a very rich man. So long
as Bryan was in the saddle he had little care to show
himself in politics, but now that Bryan has passed
like a pirate ship in the night Lamont emerges. He
comes forth this time as a possible candidate for the
Presidency," and as a consequence something of na
tional interest attaches to his reappearance. ' - ,
SINCE the Democrats of Ohio boldly made a
new departure in politics by throwing Bryan
overfeoard -there has been 'renewed activity
among Democrats all over the country. Nat
urally the new movement has been most vigorous
and, most notable in New York, and in the course of
its moving it has brought to light once, more, Daniel

We are simply asking that the Republican party, a
vast majority of whose members are dean and decent
people, shall take counsel of its cleanness and decency,
and not of the filth and political dust which may be
found in all parties. *,
The Call does not care a bean for any personal con
sideration involved. We are not asking that any men
have place on tickets because we like them person
ally, or that any be excluded because we dislike them
personally.
The Republican party is not responsible for what
is now in this city. It may be bad, in some respects
very bad, but the party cannot be charged with it.
If local control be given to bosses whose administra
tion of affairs would be so bad that it already is a
stench before it pips the shell, Republicans who value
the good name of their party will apply the remedy
by snubbing the polls, or by plumping ballots against
party disgrace.
We are not aware of any existing condition, how
ever bad, which the people are apt to run away from
in such a panic as to fetch up in the arms of Kelly
and Crimmins.
San Francisco needs a more enlightened adminis
tration than it is getting, but those are mistaken who
think it possible that the people will be willing to
exchange a bad administration for a worse one.
To turn the party over to 6 pair of bosses, with the
result of giving them the city to loot as they please,
is to be disloyal to the party, and secure its defeat.

STREET cars without tracks, cable, trolley or horses and, most of all, -without
franchises, Boon will be running regularly on the streets of Chicago, says the
Tribune of that city. The first one of the omnibus automobiles has arrived In
the city and next week will start pn.its regular route, between Jackson boule
vard and Lincoln Park. It will be the first automobile in Chicago to carry
forty or more people. 1?he fare will be*5 cents.
The passenger on the "Imperial" may take his choice between two decks. No
matter where he goes, the promoters of the omnibus line declare, he will be pro
vided with a seat. The sample omnibus Is thirty feet long. It is equipped with
four driving wheels with motor hubs, the tires being of solid rubber.
! From a beginning with one vehicle and one route the company promises to ex- -
tend its service to carry "passengers on a number of routes into the heart of the
city. From the moment every seat in an omnibus is taken the vehicle will become
ah "express car,"say the promoters, and will make no stop on the route until the
first passenger reaches his destination. --
rFares will be placed in" slots frem either deck. The guard will stand on ths
stairway leading to'the upper.- deck, where he can make change for passengers on
either level. Passengers will be allowed to talk to the motorman if they choose,
inasmuch as the motorman in his glass-inclosed space at the front of the vehicle
will be unable to hear them.
The cabs are to be lighted and heated by electricity, and electric push-buttons
are provided at every scat. The strength of The driving wheels is expected to en
able each omnibus to carry a trailer. Each wheel is a driving tmit, the two front
wheels being steering wheels as well. The storage battery system will be used .^
and the rahtales will be charged, at the end of each run, which will not average
more than tavc/oe 2w miles.
It is not worth while to go over again all the argu
ments which led up to the unanimous passage of the
ordinance closing the cemeteries more than a year
ago. The one thing now is to direct the attention
of the court to the importance of the issue. While
the suit attacking the validity of the ordinance re
mains unsettled the injunction will stand and the or
dinance be of no effect. Surely it is time to bring it
to a trial and make way for the enforcement of a law
which is designed to rid the community, of a grave
evil and materially benefit all classes of people.
The importance of the issue is- sufficient to justify
the courts in advancing the suit upon the calendar and
thus bringing it to. prompt settlement. The welfare
of the community requires the closing of burying
grounds within the city limits. The cemeteries oc
cupy some of the most picturesque parts of the pen
insula, and one of them, Laurel Hill, holds such a com
manding site that it 'overlooks the city, the bay and
the Golden Gate. Having such positions and covering
large areas, they retard the growth of the city in
some of its most important sections. Furthermore,
they constitute a menace to public health, for there is
always danger that diseases may arise from decaying
bodies deposited in sites from which the drainage
passes through thickly settled localities.
Of the beneficial nature of the ordinance there can
be.no doubt. The q-aestion of the effect of the ceme
teries upon the city was discussed among the people,
in the press and before the Supervisors for a long
time before action was taken. There is nothing in the
ordinance in the nature of hasty legislation. â¢ After
the fullest investigation of every phase of the subject
it was passed unanimously, and as it was provided that
it should not go into effect for much more than a
year after its passage, ample time was given for con
testing its validity, or for preparing for its operation.
Still the ordinance is to be held up. The cemeteries
are able even after all this time to come into court
and postpone the enforcement of the ordinance # by
getting out injunctions.
Here, then, is another illustration of that long
delay in court proceedings that scTseriously interferes
with progress and justice. A suit brought more than
a year ago, involving a matter of public concern and
importance, ought certainly to have been heard be
fore this. As it stands now the untried suit has all
the effect of a victory for the antagonists of the or
dinance. The injunction stops the effect of the. law
and nothing will be gained until the case has been
heard and adjudicated, __
The suit; in question was brought by one of the ceme
teries over a year ago. It remains to this day untried
and stands as a bar tc the enforcement of the ordi
nance, whose operation will be beneficial to the whole
community.
MORE than a year ago â or, to be exact, March
26, 19007-the Board of Supervisors passed
an ordinance closing the cemeteries within
the city limits. The ordinance was to go into effect
on August' 1 of this year, but it has been suspended
kfy an injunction granted by Judge Hebbard which
will hold good until a suit attacking the validity of
the ordinance shall have been tried and determined.
THE LAW'S LONG DELAY.
There is now talk about the organization of a trust

all 'the traffic will bear.

first-class powers in Europe arc known as Emperors.
Kings are confined to small states. There will prob
ably be something of opposition made to the change
in Parliament, but it will not amount to much, and
it is possible that with the coronation the old title
of King of Great Britain and Ireland may pass out of
history.
As a county of California Hawaii would be toler
able. As a State it would be intolerable. 'As for
Harper's Weekly, we may safely challenge it to give
reasons for intimating that to- be a county of Cali
fornia is to be in intolerable bondage. The late Fer
nando Wood, not long after having been Mayor of
New York City, advised that it secede from the
Union, becoming a free city after the fashion of the
Hanse towns. The cities ot California may have had
Mayors whose secession and absence would have
been agreeable "to the people, but so far no California
Mayor has professed to find the relation to the State
so undesirable as to suggest secession as a remedy.
Where people have to be expatriated in their in
fancy, to be reared abroad to adult age, there are not
the proper conditions for a desirable population.
Adult whites will resort to Hawaii for acquisitive or
inquisitive purposes, and when financially able to do
so I will oscillate between the islands and the conti
nent, but such people do not make a State. They
are. not the propagators of institutions and the con
scientious keepers of that faith which must be the
cementing principle of stable government.
The white population of Hawaii is about that of a
ward in San Francisco, and the whole motley mass of
her people is exceeded in number by several counties
of California. There is every prospect that the white
population of the islands will decrease, rather than
increase. White children cannot be safely reared
there, and population never v flourishes greatly where
it is composed of sojourning adults and is not built
up from the cradle.
We have no doubt that Harper's Weekly would see
policy and propriety in Porto Rico County, 'New
York, while it sees neither in Hawaii County, Cali
fornia! Yet the interest of California in Hawaii is
much greater than that of New York in Porto Rico.
We are concerned in having a rival State lying out
side of us in the Pacific, with two probably antago
nistic Senators and a Representative. Our interests
are to be first considered rather than those of a peo
ple who from selfish and*discreditable motives made
such frantic efforts to break into the United States.
As far as they are concerned California prefers them
as citizens of one of her counties rather than as her
masters in the National Government.
That paper talks about the danger of incorporating
the islands into California, and intimates that to do so
will in some way endanger the Union and our insti
tutions. It also contends that such incorporation will
disappoint the just expectations of the people .of Ha
waii that they are to be a sovereign and independent
State. We are not aware of the parsing of any prom
ise that justifies any such expectation, nor of any
obligation on the part of the United States to satisfy
such aspiration, if it exist. We do not believe that the
people of this country will ever consent to the exist
ence of non-continental States, non-contiguous and
isolated. Such States can never I be homogeneous
with the rest of the country. Their wide sep
aration, their difference in physical conditions,
production, social life and in everything which
makes up the character and motive of a peo
ple, will continually increase the interests that
are not common to them and. the rest of the Union.
In the National Government, as States, they would
be the cause of constant discord. The inequalities of
law demanded by their position and condition would
insidiously sap our system, which is intended to make
of the Federal Government the dispenser of exact
equality. In close contests we don't want the balance
of power in our politics to be held by such States, as
it easily would be. There is no point of- view from
which such States are desirable, not even from that
of their own interests. We are aware that the ques
tion will be asked, What difference between admitting
them as States, or making them parts of already exist
ing States? We admit that both are evil. Each is
part of the problem we took upon us with the other
consequences of the Spanish war. As parts of ex
isting States, such possessions as Hawaii and Porto
Rico can do less harm to themselves and to us than
as States, .-though no one need anticipate the perfec
tion of civic and social felicity from that policy.
HAWAII COUNTY, CAL.
WHILE neither the press nor the people of
this State may be regarded as in any way
committed* to the proposition to ' 'make
Hawaii a county of California, both resent such dis
cussion of that proposition as Harper's Weekly in
dulges in.

Unknown Mother Claims the Child
From People Who Intended
Edwin S. Gill, managing editor of the
Honolulu Republican, arrived here yester
day from the Hawaiian Islands and Is
staying at the Palace. He made some
very Interesting statements last evening
In reference to the present government of
the islandfi.
"The Hawaiian government is most ex
pensively conducted," said he. "The cost
of running the government. In rouni
figures, was. In 1900. $360,000. The per
capita tax was $23 26, while California,
whic"n Is one of the most expensively con
ducted States in the Union, was only
$5 06. This will give you an idea of what
work is going on in Hawaii at the present
time.
"Governor Dole at the last meeting of
the Legislature estimated the expenses of
salaries alone at $2,100,000 and $2,600,000 for
various other expenses. The treasurer
estimated that the expenses would be
54.700,000 and that the income would be
J4.100.000. No provision was made by the
Legislature for this deficiency of $600,000.
That will give you an idea how they
manage finances in the islands.
"There arÂ© only 154.000 residents In the
islands, yet a whole army of police ls> In
command. The policemen perform custom
and internal revenue duty and make their
salaries the best way they can. We have
no municipal, or state government al
thoug-h people are clamoring- for it. I will
give one illustration of misrule under
Governor Dole. The Island of Maui is
only 600 square miles and it costs for
policing alone $27,000 a year. Do you
understand family compact? No! It
simply means a man noidlng office puts
in all his relatives. Governor Dole has his
nephew in as Attorney General at a
salary of $4500 a year and his brother-in
law was until the 1st- of July assistant
superintendent of thÂ© Board of Publ?c
Works."

The officers and directors of the Bundes
fest are greatly pleased with the financial
success attending- the ten days' festival.
It is now an assured fact that the National
Bund will be enriched some $5000 through
the festival. The receipts from the gate,
the sale of tickets to contestants and the
percentage of bar receipts are more than
$25,000. The expenses will hardly reach
$20,000, thus resulting in a profit of a sum
approximated at $5000.
The crowning of King Adolph Stre*cker
wound up the shooting duties of the fes
tival. The hour for this ceremony was set
at 7 p. m. f but did not take place until
four hours later. It was simple in design
and execution. ' Led by a band, the. new
shooting king of America marched from
the ranges to the pavilion, scores of
marksmen following In line. In the pa
vilion President Kuhls pinned the na
tional king medal on Strccker's chest,
while the band played "Hail! Hall! to the
Chief." Strecker also received the State
prize, the silver and goid leaflet crown.
To the few words of introduction by Pres
ident Kuhls the holder of the new world's
record on the king target responded some
what at length. Then the ceremony was
brought to an end and the dance recom
menced. The revelry continued until -2
o'clock this morning, when the special
train left the grounds for the mole. When
the last sounds died in the pavilion the
prize committee was still distributing
medals and prizes.

As each shooter received his prize his

their cups to the curious crowd, others
walked off. eager to get away with the
spoils of shooting. The winner of the $500

contained a picture of the verein mem

Tobacco Workers to Affiliate.
close student of street railway affairs, the
general manager has not been able to
make friends. It has been easier for him
to rub the public the wrong way than to
stroke its back the way the hair lies.
Whenever his dealings have been with
men and not with facts and figures of
railway operation embarrassing compli
cations have arisen â -whether those con
cerned were dissatisfied employes, individ
uals asWng for just reparation for dam
ages Inflicted or public servants seeking
proper adjustment of the street railway's
relations as a common carrier. It has al
ways been the same story. Vining has
lacked* the address, the suavity, the di
plomacy to carry that side of his official
duty to successful issue.
The directorate has felt this deficiency
In the general manager most seriously
when Vining has had occasion to deal
Â¦with the Assessor and the Supervisors
if oDffABD P. VINING, general
__^ manager of the Market-street
**^ railway system, is to be retired.
\ lt *4 The scramble for younger men of
a high grade of ability to 'take
the positions of trust and responsibility
with the great railway systems of the
country has had its influence upon the
directorate of the local corporation and a
successor for Vining is being sought.
The date of the proposed retirement Is
still an open question, but that Vining
must go has been settled. -Â¦ In fact, it is
known that at least two men have been
approached with offers from the Market
street people. The choice of a new gen
eral manager Is the only thing that delays
the public announcement of the "resglna
tion" of the man who for so many years
has had the active management of the
affairs of the local street railway monop
oly.
Railroad men Â¦who are in close touch
with " the directors and principal stock
holders of the Market-street Railway
Company have known that for a long
time there has been much dissatisfaction
with Vining and his management. This is
shared by both the directors and the
stockholders.
VIning's personal unpopularity has had
most to do with his undoing. While a
H. E. Huntingdon has ' lately placed
Epea Randolph In charge of his Los An
geles street railway interests, and .the
next important bit of shaking _up will
probably be the retirement of Vining.
"When Huntington and his associates have
found the man who tills the bill for the
San Francisco position as well as the for
mer division superintendent from Tucson
does for the Los Angeles management the
ax will fall and Vining will be sent to jo'n
the rapidly increasing colony of railway
veterans Â¦whose services are no longer de-
Sired in the offices.
his recent appearance before the Super
visors sitting as a Board of Equalization
to show cause why the arbitrary assess-,
ment of $2000 on his own personal prop
erty should not be Increased. He made a
plea of poverty, saying that, he possessed
no personal property but the furniture of
his house, which would be Â¦well sold if it
brought $1000 under the auctioneer's ham
mer: $9 OS in the bank and $18 45 In cash
in his purse. Vining swore to his pov
erty-stricken condition with so dejected
an air that no additional burden of taxes
was placed upon him,- and the jocular re
marks made about him by the Super
visors after his departure would not have
increased the street railway directorate's
confidence In the man to whom their
great interests were Intrusted. It was an
other illustration of his lack of the per
sonal qualities that put one easily and
naturally on a proper footing with those
whose good will is desired. â¢
Judge, Conlan.
George Pierce, an employe of George
Swltzer, a horse dealer, appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday on a charge of
cruelty to animals. He was arrested by
Officer McCurrle of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
case was dismissed.
The evidence showed that Switzer and
McCurrie were not good friends, and the
other day, when a lame horse was shipped
from Stockton to Switzer, Pierce was sent
to the wharf to get the animal. Neither
Switzer nor Pierce knew anything about
the horse being lame. McCurrie arrested
Pierce and charged him with cruelty to
animals and gave out that Switzer was
arrested instead of Pierce. Judge Conlan,
in dismissing the case, criticized McCur
rie for his haste in making thÂ« arrest and
exonerated both Pierce and Switzer from
all blame.
McCurrie had also given out a statement
that Switzer was in the habit of buying
and selling sick horses to be killed and
fed to chickens, which Switzer denied ab
solutely. Â¦ .

Nine-tenths of the diseases of the scalp
and hair are caused by parasite germs.
The Importance of this discovery by Pro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg. Germany, cannot be overesti-
mated. It explains why ordinary hair
preparations. <?ven of the most expensive
character, fall to cure dandruffâ because
they do not an 3 they cannot kill the dan-
druff germ. The only hair preparation in
the world that positively destroys the
dandrufT parasites that burrow up the
scalp into scales, called scurf or dan-
druff. Is Newbro's Herplcide. In addition
to its destroying the dandruff grerm Herp-
lcide iÂ« also a delightful hair dressing,
makinr the ha'r glossy and soft as silk.

WHEATâ The foreign markets ruled firm and
futures at Paris and Liverpool ! were both
higher. ,
Chicago dropped from 72%c to 70%c on ac
count of scattering light showers in Iowa, Kan
sas and Nebraska, ' and there was a rush to
realize. Trading was Immense. The feeling
was nervous and unsettled. There was a gen
eral unloading of the coarse grains, and Wheat
sympathized. A crop expert in the Northwest
wired â¢ from Aberdeen that from . that place to
Ortonville the damage to the crop from the hot
weather was 40 per .cent, and that the de
structive â¢ hot winds 'still continued. Private
cables confirmed serious damage in France and
Russia, where . the : output will be below ex
pectations. Receipts at Kansas City and St.
Louis were 244,000 -bushels, against 418,000 last

BOSTON, July 23.â The Boston wool trade is
outside of speculative hands at the present
time, and, while the : principal' demand comes
from manufacturers who ' are in : need of raw
material to fill standing contracts, the market
shows a firmer tone.- The goods trade has im
proved and the result is that sales of. . wool
here are Increasing. . Manufacturers in most
cases are forced to pay more money for sup
plies, as was the case a week ago. The West
shows .strength , all along the . line and
the new clip in many sections is quite well
cleared up. Mill men who have not been in
the market -for some time for supplies are
surprised . at the cost â¢ of wool . compared with
thetr. last purchases. Several months ago the
manufacturer could nearly name his price and
he would get the wool, as the seller did not
dare to let him get away. Now he will pay
the price asked or will not get supplied, there
being, no soft spots to depress the market, and
If he attempts to, buy out West, . the wools
cost more than is asked at the seaport. Quo

NEW YORK. July 23.â The subservience of
the stock speculation to the varying crop 'Con
ditions and to the dally weather map was again
strikingly demonstrated to-day. But the
activity of speculation In stocks was somewhat
curtailed as an outgrowth of the confused
sentiment engendered In the grain market by
the conflicting price movements growing out
of the technical conditions in the grain specu
lation. The uneasiness of the short interest in
stocks was easily perceptible by the forced
opening bulge In,, prices. There were indica
tions that a tactful move against the shorts
was being made and the London market was
used before the opening here to influence New
York by a much higher range of prices there.
London not only had reports of copious rains
in the corn belt, but of an imminent settle
ment of the steel strike. There was a conse
quent rush to buy on the part ,of the shorts
at the opening here, but the high prices melted
away within a few minutes under the eager
offerings to realize on the part of Interests
remaining long of the market. Apparently
there was much skepticism regarding the re
ports of rain, but when the grain . market
opened with a drop in corn almost equal to
yesterday's bulge, the belief in relief for the
crops was strengthened. The reassuring ex
pressions by the Secretary of Agriculture as
to the* present Flatus of the corn crop were
also an influence. The course of affairs subse
quent to the heavy damage to last year's
spring wheat crop in tTie Northwest vras cited
rs a precedent which gave hope of mainten
ance of earnings by railroads in the Southwest.
The publication of the plan for additional
issue of American Sugar Refining stock lifted
that specialty and helped the market. The
second rise carried eome stocks higher than
the opening. But the subsequent uncertainty
of the price movement reflected the hesitation
of the traders about repeating last week's
attempt to revive a bull movement, with , the
crop situation still a factor. The market was
allowed to He fallow during the midday period*
with the exception of a momentary upward
rush In the United States Steel stocks of nearly
2 points each on an unconfirmed rumor that
the strike wa6 about to be settled. The late
advance in prices to the top level of the day
teemed to be based on the general consider
ation that the damage to the crops had been
discounted and important liquidation had been
effected. leaving the way open for an advance

CHICAGO, July 23.â In corn speculative inter
est centered as usual. Before the opening Kan
sas City reported scarcely more than a trace of
rain. Feeling, however, was at such a nervous
tension that it threw that portion of the long
Interest dealing on small margins into semi
panic at. the tap of the opening gong Septem
ber was for sale at from 59c to 55c, the latter
figure being 4%c under yesterday's close. This
slump uncovered stop-loss orders, which "pyra
mid builders" had put back of their purchases
and the decline did not stop until September
was quoted, at 54' / 4c It had taken but. a few
minutes in the runaway market to send the
price down and a recovery to 57%c followed
almost as quickly on the weather map, which
came out as dry aa heretofore, and promised no
relief. Liquidation, however, continued, as
there were not wanting reports claiming that
when the excitement was over it would- be
found that from one-third to one-half the crops
said to have been wiped out had been saved.
Even these optimists, however, were compelled
to admit that their hopes were based on im
mediate rains. September during the afternoon
declined to 55% c and closed weak, 4^c lower,
at 58^6'58%c.
Â¦ For the wheat decline there was more rea
son In a' statistical way than in corn. Cables
were disappointing, receipts heavy and a vastly
more favorable prospect from the spring wheat
country. For the Dakotas and Minnesota there
were indications of rain. Reports claimed dam
ages in some Instances running from 5 to 15
per cent, while one wire was to the effect that
the spring wheat crop might turn out to be a
"bumper." Aided to the influence of this kind
ef advice was the corn decline. September
opened %@l%c lower, at 72c to 71c, longs ex
citedly selling. The decline continued to 70%c;
where local support caused a sharp rally to 72c.
Later this support ceased and under continued
liquidation September worked down to 70V4c and
closed weak..2<Â§2Vsc under yesterday, at 70%c.
Oats were active and declined in sympathy
with corn. County buying, from which source
most of the recent support has come, was the
feature. There was, however, considerable local
support and after the opening decline prices re
acted. Later, however, the tone became easier.
September closed 2%c lower at 35%@35%c.
Provisions were dull, but fairly steady, con
sidering the declines in the grain markets. Sep
tember pork closed 10c lower, lard a shade
higher and ribs 2Hc down.

CLOSING
The markets were lower at the opening.
Americans opened hesitatingly, dealers being
alarmed by the crop report, but spurted on
news that rain had fallen in the corn belt.
Later they became stagnant, awaiting devel
opments from New York. The opening there
caused a reaction of 2 points, which was fol
lowed by feverish fluctuations and inactivity,
but the close was very near the top.

showed very little rain In the Western grain
belt and predictions were for a continued, nol
period. But this the speculative . contingent
cared little for. Every man in the' grain
crowd and a good part of the speculative public
was loaded with grain, having bought on yes
terday's big -advance and dry weather talk.
Pit brokers did their ' best to find buyers but
could only sell at big concessions. One operator
offered corn all the way down from 62 ! ,4c- to
6S^4c before he could make a trade. It was a
speculative craze to sell and lasted until, the
orders gave out, when a breathing spell and a
slight rally occurred. " It was brief, however,
for. more .rain news In the afternoon brought
on another attack and a deluge of selling
orders, which weakened September corn here
to 58c. Wheat broke from 77Â»4c to 75%c, with
the decline in . corn 1 and under reports of

The same report says that although Apricots
are dull In New. York they are being bought up
by speculators on this coast, i The dried fruit

This market is all tied up by the strike.
The canners cannot get their supplies, many
dealers cannot get their consignments up from
the" wharves, and if they do cannot deliver
them for shipment. Hence large lota of
Peaches, Plums, Pears, etc., are rotting and
have to be sold for what they will bring.
Peaches in 50-lb boxes were offered at 10c per
box to clean them up, but the buyer refused to
give over 5c, and walked off. Quotations for
fruit are largely nominal under the circum
stances, and the commission merchants are

the fruit. For the most part the can
neries and wholesale houses were the ones
that suffered the greatest loss. A great
portion of the surplus fruit, for which
there was no conveyance, was shipped to
the cities around the bay. The Caroline
carried 1400 cases to Tiburon, . whence
they will be shipped to the Santa Rosa
cannery. Another load of 500 boxes was
conveyed on the steamer San Jose to the
Garden City, while the steamer Dauntless
carried a cargo of 1000 boxes to Oakland.
By night the surplus fruit on the wharf
had been materially decreased.
During the morning hours the Overland
Transfer Company succeeded in. trans
porting from the Pacific Mail dock thi%e
loads of bonded goods. In order to do so,
however, the company was forced to em
ploy non-union men and to have them
sworn in as United States custom inspect
ors. : If the strikers should attempt to in
terfere with the Overland Transfer Com
pany's teamsters, after they, have taken
the oath as custom inspectors, the United
States would take a hand in the matter.
'Secretary McLaughlin.of the Draymen's

sters, â¢ in speaking of the : trouble last
night, stated that as yet no attempt would
be made to call out any more men and
that the merchants who were acting fair
toward- the teamsters ne^d. have no fear
He said, however, that there were some
who were acting- in a very underhanded

In reviewing the developments of the

Owing to a personal grievance ten team

Thus far r.o attempt has been made to
call upon other affiliated unions for as

were locked .out has practically tiea up
many ether branches of trade, and the
result has been far reaching. The fruit
industry of the State has been the great
est sufferer. But the teamsters have ex
pressed a willingness to handle all the
perishable freight that comes in, provided
they are not asked to handle any freight
for the Morton Drayage and Warehouse
Company. Around this firm and I'*
branch, the Morton Special Delivery Com
pany, the wbole fight centers. â¢
"We have told tne Draymen's Associa

'"that we were perfectly willing to go back
to work under the old conditions and do
straight hauling, but 'under no circum- .
stances would we haul directly or Indi
rectly for the Morton Drayage and Ware
house Company. We do not want to see
the orchardings of the State suffer, be
cause they are innocent parties to this
controversy. We have said time and
again that we were willing to haul all
perishable freight, such as fruit, either to
tne commission houses or the canneries,
or any other freight that is offered, with
the sole exception that it must in no way
be connected with the Morton companies.
About 4'X) men are still at work out of the

Bet-ween the two organizations, despite

the best of feeling prevails. The bosses

them to "take a smile." No 111 feeling is
manifested on either side, but woe betide
the non-union man that attempts to haul
a load of freight. Out of the vo
cabulary of the teamster, gathered from
years of experience in handling a balky
team, the choicest epithets are hurled,
and' the result is generally a get-off-the
box policy on the part of the driver. Lads
who have been employed in the offices of
the draymen have in many instances been,
impressed into service as draymen, but
none seemed to relish the awkward con

WASHINGTON. July 23.â With the ex
ception of scattered thunder-storms, the
most important of which, so far at least
as reports to the weather bureau show,
was that at North Platte, Nebr., where
eight one-hundredths of an inch of rain
fell, the drought and intense heat continued
all day throughout the States of the corn
belt. Temperatures to-day again aver

the thirty-sixth consecutive' day in which
the thermometer has risen to 90 degrees

Alexander was committed to Stockton
this afternoon by Judge Greene on com
plaint of Mrs. Alexander, against the pro
test of the daughter, who openly rebelled
against the effort made by her mother to
have her father confined in an insane .isy
lum. The girl was not present at the ex
amination, but shortly before her father
was to be taken away by the deputy
sheriff she arrived at the hospital. In the
absence of Warden Page Steward B.or
chert was in charge of the Insane ward.
Miss Alexander asked Borchert to get
her mother's telephone addressvand ring
her up, as she must talk to her at once.
The telephone is in the waiting room, well
removed from the wing of the â¢ building
where the insane patients are confined.
While Borchert was studying the tele
phone directory the girl closed the door
of the waiting room, stepped noiselessly
to the insane ward and' threw open the
window at the end of the corridor. Then
she opened the door of her father's cell
and helped him through the window. As
soon as he had disappeared around the
corner of the building she took his place
in the cell and shut the door. When thÂ«
unsuspecting . steward returned she was.
reading aloud from the testament left be
hind by the preacher.
- Steward Waits Outside.
Hesitating to disturb these pious minis
trations, the steward waited outside while
Miss Alexander read on in reverential
tones â and his erstwhile patient made his
way up Franklin street to the narrow
gauge station, as the officers now suppose
from the traces found later. Meanwhile
Deputy District Attorney Harris, whom
Mr. Alexander' had requested to come to
the hcspital to advise him with regard to
his legal rights, arrived and asked 10 be
admitted to the cell. It was then that
Steward Borchert found that he had been
duped. When the full extent of the
treachery of which. he had been made the
victim burst upon him he upbraided the
fair conspirator for the betrayal of his
confidence. â¢ "I trusted you, and this is the
way you pay "me back. What shall I do
with her, Mr. Harris? She ought to go
to the penitentiary for this."
Harris â¢ said he couldn't see what au
thority Borchert had to confine Miss Alex
ander in the insane ward, so she walked
"out, bidding the steward a very cordial
good-sifternoon,- while that official rushed
to the telephone to summon the Sheriff
and his deputies. In a few minutes all
the men available were detailed on- the
case. . After they had searched the
grounds about the hospital, the steward
meanwhile looking under, all the beds In
the insane ward, they discovered- that
their man had half an hour's start on
them. They then made inquiries about
the railroad stations and found that a
man answering Alexander's description
had passed up Franklin Â¦ street half an
hour before, going toward the narrow
gauge station, where there was a train
nearly due for the city.
Up to a late hour to-night no f urthar
trace of the fugitive had been found. The
Sheiiff's office has notified the officers
throughout the county to be on the'look
out fi*r him. ; \
"I- cannot comprehend this dreadful
thing yet," she : said. "I have gone

through a terrible ordeal to accomplish
the commitment and I would never have
forced it had I not been driven by the
awful peril that has haunted me these
last months. My daughter regarded his
confinement in an asylum as a disgrace
which she would do anything to avert.
Still I cannot think that she connived at
her father's escape. She was here for a
few minutes after this happened, but said
nothing to me. She knew it would nearly
kill me. She has gone away now again.
She is not afraid of her father and is sel
dom at home."
Broke Promise to Be Good.
This is the second time M/. Alexander
has been examined for commitment, hav
ing been discharged by Judge Ellsworth
a month ago, after promising never to
molest/his wife again. At that trial he
defended himself eloquently, claiming that
while he had threatened his wife's life
he did so from excess of love and because
she said she was going to get a divorce.
When he went from the hospital on that
occasion his wife refused to bid -him good
by, but Miss Lillie, who is tall and strik
ingly handsome, embraced him again and
again and left a $5 gold piece in his hand
as she shook it at parting. â¢ /
At the hearing before Judge Greerie to
day Alexander said he did. not wish to
say anything in answer to the court's
questions, as it was a law of evidence that
a man could not be compelled to testify
against himself.
"Then you admit the truth of tha
charge?" asked Judge Greene.
Alexander said he had nothing to con
ceal and spoke fluently in his own de
fense. He said that his only crime was In
loving his wife too well. His impulsive
temper, he said, was to blame for all the
rest.
Mrs. Alexander said that her husband
laid all his actions to divine direction, in
cluding hi3 threats to kill herself.' She
said he appeared at the windows at all
hours of the night, shaking his fist and
using abusive language. ' â¢ "
Miss Alexander denied having assisted
her father to escape. She says she la
glad he got away, and admits that when
she saw he had escaped, while she i and
Borchert were at the telephone, she did
what she could to conceal the fact and
allow him time to get beyond pursuit.

Gomez in the course of an* open letter sets
forth the objects of his recent trip to the
United States and asserts that he. went to
New York with a view of impressing upon
T. Estrada Palma the necessity of com
ing to Cuba to be the first President of
the republic. He says: .
"Taking Into consideration the fortuit
ous relations which the Cuban republic
will bear to the United States, Senor
Palma is the most available and is the
only candidate. As real Cubans we ought
to make him accept. I shall turn all my
energy toward this end, and when it has
been accomplished I shall keep apart from
politics." Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ -Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The fiscal of the Audiencia asserts v that
he has sufficient evidence to convict C. F.
W. Neely, charged with embezzling postal

their loads of merchandise after they -had

Mrs. Timothy Murphy of 37 West Mis
sion street, accompanied by her 14-year
old son, Leo Murphy, called . at the
Morgue yesterday afternoon and Identi
fied the body of the man who committed
suicide at the Seattle House last Satur
day night as that of her husband. Tim
othy Murphy, .a locomotive engineer.
Murphy left a note notifying the Coroner
that he had taken carbolic acid and signed
his name as "Meyers." Mrs. Murphy
said that whenever her husband went on
a spree he went by the name of Meyers.
He had been working for a firm in Ukiah
and came down to this city a few days
before the Fourth of July. Since that
time he had been drinking heavily.
Suicide Identified.
While the detectives were examining
Waiting's clothing he was observed to
throw his hat on the bed. As he did so
the two diamonds, having been removed
from the ring and wrapped in a paper,
fell to the floor. Walling had concealed
the stones up his sleeve and attempted to
discard them with his hat. The paper
used In wrapping them was a leaf from a
notebook in his possession and furnished
further evidence.
Since Walling has been In the house
Mrs. Dodge has missed other Jewelry and
valuables, but was never able to locate
the thief. On one occasion she discharged
a Japanese servant, though she had no
evidence against him. ; >'_v-
James Walling, a son of ex-Judge Wall
ing of Nevada County, and said to be a
nephew of an ex-Chief of Police of New
York City, was arrested last night by De
tectives Dinan and Wren on a charge of
having stolen a diamond ring valued at
$600 from Mrs. Annie M. Dodge of 719 Tay
lor street. The prisoner was a roomer In
the house where the theft occurred. He
has occupied prominent positions In the
city and his good reputation was never
questioned until the police found . the
stolen property in- his possession. Now it
is believed that he was responsible for
several other crimes. He lost his last po
sition with an oil and land company for
alleged discrepancies in his accounts.
Testerday morning Mrs. Dodge placed
two rings in the drawer of a. dresser In
her room and left her house to call on
friends. When she returned she discov
ered that' one of them, set with two dia
monds of high value, was missing. She
immediately reported the matter to Cap
tain Seymour, and detectives were sent
to her home. A Japanese engaged in
cleaning rooms was first questioned, but
his statements satisfied the police of his
innocence. It was than learned that Wall
ing, who rents a room in the - same fiat,
had been seen in Mrs. Dodge's apart
ment during her absence. He denied his
guilt when accused and became indignant
when he was told he would be searched.

Substitutes receive no regular salary, but
are awarded the same pay pro rata as the
men for whom they are substituted. Their
average earnings are from $25 to $30 per
month with a little added for delivering
special delivery . letters at 8 cents each.
The oldest appointed, substitute of those
promoted is Booth,' who was appointed
in January, 1899, and the most recent Is
Mr. Hemenway, who was appointed in
February, 1900. Some substitutes have
had to wait as long as five years to be
appointed on the regular force, but once
in, their position is good for life under
civil service rules, the Postmaster being
powerless to remove them except for neg
lect of duty or violation of the rules of
the department and upon being authorized
to do so by the Postmaster General.
In accordance with permission received
from the Postmaster General to add six

Butterfield also sold at auction the Wal
dorf Hotel, at 317 Powell street, and owes
more than $200 balance on this transac
tion. The missing man's relatives are not
anxious to make a settlement, and some
racy developments are to be expected.
Charles Ehn of 47 Post street also is
loser to the amount of $700 which he ad
vanced to Butterfleld. Among the other
creditors are an attache of the Railroad
saloon, who Is a victim of the "rush act"
for $40, and a poor woman on California
street, whose furniture Butterfield sold for
$200 and for which he has made no return.
Among the creditors that mourn But
terfleld's departure is R. H. Winston of
1026 Market street. Winston claims that
he has a clear case of embezzlement
against Butterfield. He claims he ad
vanced the auctioneer $500 with which to
buy the furniture for a flat, and that he
received no returns.
Butterfield, it is alleged, owes a large
amount of money. It is said by his
friends that the city became too tropical
for him. He formerly occupied offices in
the headquarters of Bovee, Toy & Sonn
tag, but when a Call reporter visited the
offices of that firm yesterday it was stated
that Butterfield had been absent for two
weeks and that it was not known where
he was.
The many creditors of Frank W. Butter

George Maxwell, former secretary of the
board, was also secretary of the benevo
lent association. When J. W. McCarthy
was appointed to succeed him he refused
to give over the books and funds of the
association. Action was brought to com
pel him to do so, and the matter has been
a source of considerable litigation. On
July 15 the Fire Commissioners petitioned
Judge Cook for a transfer on the: ground
that he was prejudiced in favor of Max
well. Three days later the petition was
denied and the case' set for trial on July
29. The board then sought the assistance
of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court yesterday granted
the petition of the Board of Fire Com
missioners that Judge Carroll Cook be en
joined from trying the case relating to
the trusteeship of property belonging to
the San Francisco Firemen's Benevolent
Association, which he had set for trial on
July. 29. The petition consists of a re

Judge Cook cannot give the fair and Im

titled. : - ' /

No other prospective change in the or
ganization of the Southern Pacific as a
part of the Harriman system could create
as much consternation and uneasiness lo
cally as the transfer of the headship of
the law department to New York. Aside
from the direct effect of the change upon
Thurston would have an eye to it him
self, and his lieutenants would probably
be some of the lesser lights of the South
ern Pacific staffâ men who are hand-in
glove with the Colonel Bradys, the Lon
Henrys and the Eddie Wolfes of politics.
GOING TO MARE
ISLAND TO-DAY
"When the change takes place "W. F.
Herrin will no doubt be given the choice
between "resignation" and relegation to
obscurity as local counsel for the South
ern Paciflc. Those who know Herrin best
say he will never submit to the humilia
tion of such reduction in rank, and they
assert that the appointment of Thurston
will mean the retirement of Herrin. How-
Senator Thurston was in San Francisco
at the time of the Presidential visit, but
the significance of his visit was not then
understood. Recent consolidations of of
fices, where possible, of the Harriman rail
roads, however, have set the "wise ones"
thinking, and the reports from New York
leave little doubt that their guess of a
shake-up coming in the Southern Paciflc
law department is correct.
Ex-Senator Thurston was a railroad at
torney long before he became a Senator.
"While he still lived at Omaha he was as
sistant attorney for the Union Pacific
Railway, which position he held from
1877 to 18S8. In 1888 he was made chief
counsel for the Union Pacific. Thurston
was elected Senator in 1S95, and his term
expired March 3 of this year. Since his
retirement from the Senate Thurston has
been preparing to devote most of his en
ergies to the Interests of the greatest of
railway syndicates, and he and Harriman
have been frequently in consultation in
New York.
Associated with Thurston will be Jeffer
son Chandler of "Washington, D. C.
Chandler and Thurston have offices to
gether in Washington and will open of
fices in New York, from which they will
take care of the legal interests of the
Harriman railway syndicate. 1
LOCAL railroad men received pri
vate information from New York
yesterday that a reorganization
of the staff of attorneys of the
Southern Pacific is to take place
in the near future. The law departments
of the Union Paciflc and the Southern
Pacific will be combined, it is said, with
former United States Seriator John M.
Thurston as chief counsel.
Wholesalers Will Pay

purpose of ascertaining the condition of

Into the reasons why ..ne navy yard does

There Is also the possibility of the two
ranking next the four successful sergeants
being promoted eoon. It Is no secret that
Captain Glllen, who got a three months'
reprieve at the last meeting of the Pen
sion Commissioners, is not improving in
health, and his retirement at the next
Quarterly meeting on a pension Is almost
a foregone conclusion. It is also reported
that Captain Eplllane will never be fit for
active duty again and he will also be re
tired on a pension. That will leave two
promotions for lieutenants within the next
three months.
Chief fjullivan called upon the Civil Ser
xice Commissioners yesterday and was as
sured that the examination would be held
soon ?Jid that all they were waiting for
was a list of the sergeants who were pre
pared to undergo the test. The list will
be furnished as soon as possible and the
date will be fixed. There are four lieu
tenants to be appointed. At* present there
are six, but the charter says unequivocal
ly that there shall be ten, or two for each
captain.
In speaking of the matter yesterday the
Chief said: "Although there is no amount
net apart for ten lieutenants in the ap
propriation, the charter is specific that
there shall be that number. I propose
that the charter shall be obeyed and there
â¢will be no difficulty, as enough money can
be saved to pay the difference between
the pay of four sergeants and four lieu
tenants. In the examinations merit and
Jong service will, of course, be a factor
In deciding upon the successful applicants
in accordance with the terms of the char
ter. It is possible that the examination
of corporals to fill the vacancies caused
by the promotion of the four sergeants
will be held at the same time."
The examination by the Civil Service
Commissioners of sergeants who aspire to
be lieutenants in the Police Department,
which has been expected for some months,
will be held in a few days, and there Js
already much speculation as to who will
be the lucky ones.

ever that may be, the change will mean
