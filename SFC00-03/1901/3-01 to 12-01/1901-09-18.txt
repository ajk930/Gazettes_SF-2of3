WASHINGTON', Sept. 17.-The last
chapter of the sad ceremonial, the
removal of the remains of the late
President to the grave at his old
home at Canton, Ohio, began at
S:20 o'clock to-night, when the fu
neral train left here over the Penn
sylvania Railroad. The great bronze doors
of the Capitol, In which the body had lain
In state, had closed while there were still
thousands of people waiting to get a last
glance at the casket. The guards at the
Capitol, who had patiently throughout
the long day held the crowd in leash,
were permitted a hurried look at the face
of the deceased, the cover of the casket
was screwed down by the undertakers;
it was lifted once more on the shoulders
of the body bearers and by them borne
to the hearse at the foot of the east steps
of the Capitol.
"Steaay, men," said General Randolph,
as they walked slowly out between the
bronze doors with their precious burden.
They scarcely needed the injunction, for
every step was guardedly ta*cen and they
consumed four minutes in descending the
broad stairway.
The lime was marked by the doleful
discharge of a minute gun stationed at
a convenient point in the Capitol grounds.
From Capitol to Train.
Thirty minutes was required for the re
moval of the body from the Capitol to the
train. The escort on this Journey con
sisted of committees from tne army and
navy and two squadrons of the Eleventh
Cavalry. The route was down Penn
sylvania avenue, which -was lined on
either side by troops of the District of
Columbia. It was a quiet, noiseless jour
ney without music. Not a drum was
heard nor a funeral note, nor was there
a sound from the crowd which lined the
broad street. Notwithstanding that the
hour was late, the air chilly and a light
mist falling hats were uniformly removed
as the cortege passed. At the Pennsyl
vania Railroad station there was a dense
throng and the remains were received by
large delegations of army and navy offi
cers. There the soldiers and seamen
carried the casket from the hearse to the
observation car, placed in the second sec
tion of the funeral train. The casket was
placed on standards draped with the na
tional colors. It was covered with floral
emblems. No less than twenty cars were
required -for the transportation of the
funeral party to Canton.
Further Departures To-Day.
To-morrow still another train will carry
to Canton a large party of Senators and
Representatives and others prominent in
national life. The three sections into
which the train was divided left at ten
minute intervals. ;
First was a train of eight cars bearing
among its passengers the following per
sons: Cuban Commissioners Tamayo,
Latosco and Quesada, Henry M. Dawes*
M. L. Ailes, Colonel John J. McCook, Gen
eral T. H. Anderson and forty newspaper
men.
The second section was the Presidential
train proper, made up of practically the
same seven cars which made the trip
from Buffalo. The car Olympia was as
signed to Mrs. McKinley. while the car
Kdgemere, which came next, was occu
pied by the President and his Cabinet.
Behind, in order, came the sleepers Na
ples and Belgravia. the dining car Wal
dorf and a combination car. Among the
passengers on this train were the follow
ing: Mrs. McKinley and maid. Mr. and
Mrs. Abner McKinley. Mr. and Mrs. A. J.

HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept.- 18.âHarris
burg was not reached until after the mid
night hour, but the crowd was enormous
and the scene impressive. The train
stopped several minutes while crews and
engines were changed and the multitude
had an excellent opportunity to see the
guarded casket, revealed as if by a flood
of day in the brilliantly lighted car.
YORK, Pa., Sept. 17.â On passing out of
the station" at' "Baltimore the track was
lined with people. Laborers and hand
somely dressed women stood side by side.
Once or twice a quick flare from a photo
grapher's flashlight exposed the whole
train to view. . .
As the train came out. of the long tun
nels leading to Baltimore, before reaching
the Union stations, thousands of silent
forms could be seen and the dismal tolling
of the bells could be heard. A clear-drawn
bugle call sounded a requiem. At the
Union station crowds packed the station.
Hundreds of people had gained access to
the train shed and they gazed sorrowfully
at the casket while the locomotives were
being shifted. The train, which had ar
rived at 9:34 p. m., pulled out for the west
a few minutes later.
Several thousand -people on the bridge
over the eastern branch of the Potomac,
straining for a last look, could be seen
by the lights strung along the bridge as
the train moved along under it. :Tbe fun

the light from the death chamber as the
train flashed by and as the little villages
between Washington and Baltimore were
passed the sound of : tolling bells came
faintly to the Â¦ heavy-hearted mourners
aboard. :
BALTIMORE, Sept. 17.â Leaving Wash
ington.the long winding train bearing the
remains of the martyred President
plunged out into the darKness and hur
ried like a black streak on its mournful
journey. The curtains of the train were
drawn as it pulled out of the station,
save only for the observation car in
which the corpse lay, guarded by a sailor
and soldier of the republic. That car
alone was flooded with light. The count
less thousands, extending from the station
far out into the suburbs of the national
capital, waiting patiently there in the
drenching rain to pay farewell, had an
opportunity to catch a- last fleeting

Ten minutes later the -third section of

ceremonies. : â¢ .â. . .
It was just before 8 o'clock when Mrs.
McKinley was . driven to the staticn.
Fearing the tiring effect of the long walk
from the carriage entrance to the car set
apart for her next to the head of the
,train, a rolling chair had been provided
for her. She declined this, however, and
walked with surprising firmness to nor
place, assisted by Abner McKinley and
Dr. Rixey. It was 8:10 o'clock when this
section steamed away in the darkness, the
first section having preceded it ten min
utes. The observation car bearing the re
mains was flooded with light. Through
its crystal sides could be seen the beau
tifully draped casket, with its mass of
rare blossoms, so arranged that even as
the train swept through the night the
people in the country it passed through
might gaze on the sight of the casket
with a soldier standing grimly at tho
head and a sailor, carrying his cutlass
upon his shoulder, at the foot. A guard
of soldiers and sailors occupied. the plat
form, and between them at the rear was a
large wreath six feet in- diameter of rare
orchids and laurels.

Prisoner, but No Attempt Is Made to Ob

"Remove the prisoner." said Judge
Emery, and Czolgosz was taken back to
Jail by the underground route, again
passing the garb of mourning.
Judge Lewis said also that he might
also like an order of the court for alien
ists to examine the prisoner, as the Dis
trict Atorney had informed him that
eminent alienists had examined the pris
oner on behalf of the people. This gave
rise to the belief that a special plea of
insanity may be entered by tho counsel
for the defense.
Not a sound was uttered by the prison
er. He stood mute before the bar ofc
justice, apparently continuing his feint of
insanity, which was noticed for the .first
time when he was taken into court yes
terday afternoon. His curly hair was dis
heveled", and, although his linen was
white and clean, his disordered clothes
and the growth of his beard gave him an
unkempt appearance. Spectators in the
courtroom commented on the fact, that if.
he were shaved, which he has not been
since the day of the shooting, he would,
be a fairly good-looking young man. Al
though his demeanor was still one of
stubbornness, he gave a little more evi
dence of concern than upon his first ap
pearance in court. When questions wera
being asked of him rapidly he moistened
Jjis lips with his tongue and seemed to
endeavor to maintain the appearance of
stolid Indifference.
In bi3 roaming glances the prisoner's
eyes met those of a reporter, who stared
him full in the face. In a moment tha
prisoner's eyelids dropped and he shifted,
uneasily. However, aside from the slight
evidence of uneasiness, Czolgosz' 3 appear
ance was that of a man shamming
Insanity.

District Attorney asked him If he under
stood what had been read, and, receiving
no answer, told him that he had been In

that he could answer "yes" or "no." For
an Instant Czolgosz glanced at Mr. Pen
ny, and it was thought that he Intended
to speak, buthe did not /^
Judge Lewis then addressed the coni^
at length, saying that he had called upon
the defendant but bad been unable to as
certain of any wish on tho defendant's
part as to the employment of counsel.
He said that his associate, Judge Titus,
was in Milwaukee, but that he had ap
peared Informally to enter a plea of not
guilty on behalf of the defendant. Ha
asked permission to reserve the right to
withdraw the plea and enter a special
plea or interpose a demurrer if, after con
sulting with Judge Titus, they decided not
to ask tho court to assign other counse'..
The Judge expressed his- regret that his
name had been mentioned in connection
with this trial, as he had been out of
practice for some considerable time and
had a very strong- repugnance . to appear,
although that was a reason which, would
apply to every lawyer.
District Attorney Penny gave noticÂ«
that he would move to have the indict
ment transferred to the Supreme Court
for trial, and would also notice the trial
for next Monday morning.
"I know of no reason why the defen
dant should not be ready next Monday,"
replied Judge Lewis. At his request,
however, the orders will not be entered
until Judge Titus returns, which. â¢wUl

murmur ran through the audience, bat
the gavel of the Judge and the tipstaff
of the crier soon restored order. As soon
as Czolgosz was before the bar and the
handcuffs were removed District Attor
ney Penny began the formal arraig\ M
ment. He read the principal charges orW
the indictment in a voice of severity and
"How do you plead â guilty or not
guilty?"
BUFFALO, Sept. 17.â Leon F. Czol
gosz, the assassin of President Mc-
Kinley, was. arraigned before Judge
Edward K. Emery in the County
Court at 3 o'clock this afternoon on
the indictment for murder in the
first degree. AgtJn the stubborn
prisoner refused to plead or even to utter
a word or sound, and Lcran L. Lewis, ex-
Supreme Court Justice, entered a plea of
not guilty. The accused will be tiled in
the Supreme Court next Monday morning.
Crowds flocked to the City Hall to-day
to see the prisoner, and the most notable
incident of the day was the hissing of the
prisoner by the crowds who surged
around him as he wasi being escorted
down the stairs, which were still draped
In mourning garb. The strong guard of
patrolmen and Deputy Sheriffs had been
dispensed with, so that the people were
able to get nearer the prisoner as he
passed to and from the courtroom. -Â¦*
Prisoner Will Wot Talk.
As a result of the urjjing of President
Adelbert L. Moot of the Erie County Bar
Association, Judge Lewis, one of the at
torneys assigned as counsel by Judge
Emery yesterday, called at the Erie
County Jail at 2 o'clock this afternoon to
see the prisoner. Czolgosz refused to talk
to Judge Lewis, and refused to answer
questions as to whether or not be wanted
any counsel. Judge Lewis said that,
nevertheless he would appear for the
prisoner, upon arraignment, even if he de
cided not to accept the assignment of the
court. â¢ â¢ ' -
Absolutely no demonstration having
been made against the prisoner yesterday
the authorities decided that the strong
guard was unnecessary to-day. Czolgosz
was" taken- from the jail' through the tun
nel under Delaware avenue to the City
Hall by Detectives Solomon and Geary,
being handcuffed to the latter. In passing
from the basement of. the City Hall to the
courtroom- on the second floor, Czolgosz
was compelled to pass close to the black
and white hunting with which the pillars,
ceiling, windows and stairways of the
City Hall were draped when the body of
the President was lying In state on Sun
day. These evidences of the city's grief
made not the siightest impression on the
prisoner and he gave no more heed to
them or to the large portraits of the
President draped with American flags
than he did to the questions of the court
or the District Attorney.
. The prisoner entered the courtroom Just
as the city clock was striking 3, and as
many of the curious, spectators as could
surged into the courtroom behind him. A.

through the rotunda stirred the j delicate
blooms which lay upon the coffin, and the
"peace that passeth all understanding'.'

countenance as he began his eulogy of the
life and' works of William McKinley. His
words were simple, but his whole heart
was in every one of them. His tribute to
the Christian fortitude of the dead Presi

of the sermon the audience, as if by pre

ward came General Gillespie, .chief . of
engineers, and General Fltzhugh Lee.
Soon the number of officers became too
great to .distinguish them and the ro

of cold lace and gilt buttons and flash
ing, sword scabbards, . scattered', through
the soberly, dressed- crowd of civilians.
Before 10 o'clock the latter had assem
bled in such numbers as to fill the greater
part of the seating space not reserved for
the persons in the funeral procession who
were to enter the rotunda,*
Just. at 10 o'clock Admiral Dewey made
his appearance, accompanied by General
Otis, General Davis and General Rug

and then took up'his station at the east

other members of the guard of honor.

Mrs. Hobart and her son and Mrs.' Rus

also entered at this time. The clergy
men and the choir, the latter from the
Metropolitan Methodist Episcopal. Church,
which Mr. McKinley attended, filed in and
were seated. at the head of the catafalque.
At 10:40 o'clock the Cabinet entered and
were seated to the south. of. the platform,
and then, to the strains of "Nearer, My
God, to Thee." by the Marine Band out

Next the diplomatic corps entered, all
in full court regalia, and were seated to
the south. Former President Cleveland,
with General Wilson, his escort, sat in the
first row. Lastly came President Roose

ceded by Mr. Cortelyou, secretary to the
late President. He was given a seat at
the end of the row occupied by the Cabi
net, just south of the casket. Mr. Roose
velt's face was set and he appeared to
be restraining his emotions with difficulty.
â¢When the noise occasioned by seating
the late comers had ceased a hush fell
upon the people and then the choir softly
sang "Lead, Kindly . Light," while every
one stood in reverence.

It was a humble home in which he was born.
It is a beautiful thing that to the e nd of his
life he bent reverently before that \ mother
whose example and teaching and prayer had bo
fashioned his mind and all his aims. The
school came but briefly and then came to him
tha church with a ministration of power. - Â¦ He
accepted the truth which it taught. He believd
in God and In Jesus Christ, through whom God
was revealed. He gladly partook with . his
brethren of the symbols of mysterious passion
and redeeming love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
He was helpful In all the beneficiaries and act
ivities, and from the church to the close of his
life he received inspiration that lifted him
above much of the trouble and weakness inci
dent to our human -nature, and blessings be to
God, may we say. In the laet and final hour
they enabled him confidently, tenderly to say,
"It Is his will, not ours; that will ba donÂ»."
Such Influences gave to us William McKinley
and what waÂ« he? A man of Incorruptible per*
Bonal and political Integrity,, I suppose no one
I think we must all concede that nature and
training andâ reverently be it saidâ the inspira
tion of Almighty conspire to conform a man ad
mirable in. his moral temper and. alms. None
of us can doubt, I think, that even by nature
he was eminently gifted. The kindly, calm and
equitable : temperament, the kindly and gener
ous heart, the love of Justice and right and the
tendency toward faith and loyalty, to unseen
powers and authoritiesâ theses things must have
been â¢ with him from his childhood, from his
infancy; but upon them supervened the train
ing for which he was always tenderly thankful
and of which even this great nation, from sea
to sea, continually has taken note.
Love of Justice and Bight.
Character abides. We bring nothing , Into
this world, we carry nothing out. We our
selveB depart ' with all the accumulations of
tendency and habit and quality ' which the
years have given to us. We ask, therefore,
even at the grave of the illustrious, not al
together of the great achievement they had
performed and how they had commended them
selves to the memory and affection and respect
of the world, but chiefly of what sort they
were; what the j interior nature of the man
was; what were his affinities. Were they with
the good, the true, the noble? What his re
lation to the 'infinite Lord of the universe and
to the compassionate Savior of mankind; what
his fitness for that great hereafter to which
he had passed. ' Â¦ . S^
And such great questions come to us with
the moment, even in the hour, when we gather
around the bier of these whom we profundly
respect and eulogize and whom we tenderly
love. In the years to come we will give full
utterance as to the high statesmanship and
great achievements - of the illustrious - man
whom we mourn to-day. We shall not touch
them to-day.- Â¦ The .nation already has broken
out In its grief and poured its tears, and is
still pouring them, over the loss of a beloved
man. It Is well. But we ask this morning
of what sort this man is, so that we may,
perhaps, knowing the moral and spiritual life
that is past, be able Â¦ to shape j the . far-with
drawing future. ' . , > â¢ -
'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord,
who of his abundant mercy hath begotten us
again unto a lively hope of the resurrection
of Christ from the dead to an inheritance in
corruptible, undented and that l'adeth not
away, reserved in heaven for use who are now,
by the power of God, through faith unto salva
tion, ready to be revealed in the last time.
The services for the dead are fitly, and al
most of necessity, services of religion and of
immortal hope. In the presence of the shroud
and the coffin and the narrow home, ques
tions concerning intellectual quality, concern
ing public station, concerning great achieve
ments, sink into comparative Insignificance,
and questions concerning character and man's
relation to the Lord and giver of life, even
the life eternal, emerge to our view and im
press themselves upon us.

choir swelled â¢ forth j and the rich, pure
soprano notes of Mrs. Thomas C Noyes

fective and touching as -the notes came

the dome overhead. I As soon as 'the
hymn ceased -Bishop Edward Andrews of
the Methodist Episcopal. Church, who
had come from Ohio to say the last
words over the remains of his life-long
friend and parishioner, arose. He stood
at the head of the- casket and spoke in
sympathetic voice and with manyi evi

Sermon of the Bishop.
And ' now, Â« O Lord, we humbly pray for thy
blessing and consolation to come to all the
people of our land and nation. Forgive our
past shortcomings; our sins of . omission as
well as our sins of commission. Help us to
make the golden rule the standard of our
lives, that we may "do unto others as we
would have them do unto us." and thus be
come indeed a people whose God is the Lord.
These tilings : we humbly ask in the name of
him who taught us when we pray to say:
"Our father art in heaven, hallowed
by thy name; thy kingdom come, thy -will
be done in earth "as it is In heaven. Give
us this day. bur -dally bread, and forgive us
our trespasses as -.we forgive them that tres
pass against us. And leadus not into tempta

the kingdom, and the power, and glory, for
ever. Amen." â¢
Hear our prayer, O Lord, for the official
family of the administration, those men who
are associated with thy servant, the Presi
dent, in ""the administration of affairs of gov
ernment. Guide them in all their deliberations
to the nation's welfare and to the glory of
God. (
And, O Lord, we sincerely pray for him
upon whom the mantle of Presidential author
ity has so suddenly and unexpectedly fallen.
Help him to walk worthy. of the high. vocation
whereunto he has been called. He needs thy
guiding hand and thine inspiring spirit con
tinually. May he always present to I the na
tion and to the world divinely, illumined Judg
ment, a brave heart and an unsullied char
acter. ' Â¦â¢.:..
But. O Lord, we deplore our loss to-day;
sincerely deplore thy sanctifying benediction.
We pray thee for that dear one who has been
walking by his side through the years, shar
ing his triumphs and partaking of his sorrows.
Give to her all needed sustenance and the
comfort her stricken heart so greatly craves.
And under the shadow of this great calamity
may she learn as never before the fatherhood
of God and the matchless character of iiU
sustaining grace. . .
O Lord God, our heavenly father, a be
reaved nation cometh to thee In its deep
sorrow. To whom can we go in such an hour
as this but unto thee? Thou only art able
to comfort and support the afflicted. Death
strikes down the tallest and. best of men and
constant changes are continually occurring
among nations and communities. But we have
been taught that thou art the same yester
day, to-day and forever; that with thee there
js no variableness, nor the least shadow of
turning. So In the midst of our grief we
turn to thee for help.
We thank thee, O Lord, that years ago
thou didst give to this nation a man
whose, loss we .mourn to-day. We thank thee
lor the pure and unselfish life he was enabled
to live In the midst of so eventful an ex
perience. We thank thee for the ' faithful
and distinguished services which he was en
abled to render to thee, to our country and
to the world. We bless thee for such a citi

about her. They speck with grayÂ© appre

They dread" the approaching days in the
quiet of her home at Canton, where her
beloved "Major"- will not be near to com
fort her in the reaction that will follow
inevitably after the present shock. It Is
believed -that -she will - be able to s go"
jthrough the services at Canton .without
too great difficulty, but subsequently a
collapse is greatly feared.
At present her condition Justifies the
hope that there will be no break down, at

As the Bishop concluded every one In
the vast rotunda rose, and while the choir
intoned the air hundreds of voices joined
In the hymn, "Nearer. My. God, to Thee."
It was an affecting moment. In the midst
of the singing Admiral Robley Evans, ad
vancing with silent tread, placed a beau
tiful blue floral cross at the foctf. of the
casket. The last notes died away softly,
and with uplifted hands benediction was
pronounced by Rev. Dr. W. H. Chapman,
acting pastor of the Metropolitan Church.
This ended the religious service.
There was a pause for a few minutes
while the ushers cleared the aisles and
the assemblage began to withdraw. First
to retire was President Roosevelt, preced
ed a short distance by Major McCauley
and Captain Gilmore, with Colonel Bing
ham and Captain Cowles almost pressing
against him. The remainder of the com

entered, the Cabinet members following
the President, and after them going the
diplomatic corps, the Supreme Court,
Senators and Representatives, officers of
the army and navy and officials of less

His qualities ever associated him in kindly
relations with those who were his political
opponents. They made.it possible for" him to
enter that land with which he as one of the
soldiers of the Union had not been in sym
pathy durinsr the war and to draw closer the
tie that was to bind all hearts into one firmer
and one indissoluble union. They commanded
the confidence of the great body of Congress,
so that they listened to his plans and ac
cepted kindly and hopefully and trustfully all
his declarations. His qualities gave him repu
tation, not in this land alone, but throughout
the world, and made it possible for him to
minister in the style he has within the last
two or three years . ministered to the welfare
and peace of humankind. Will all of such a

McKinley's Great Qualities.
Beyond that, this man had somehow wrought
in him a great and generous' love for his fellow
men. He believed in men. He had himself
oeen brought up among the common people.
He knew 'their labors, struggles, necessities.
He loved them. Shall I speak a word next to
that which I hardly advert to, the tenderness
of that democratic love which has so often
beeen commented on? I pass it with only that
word. I think no words can set forth fully the
unfaltering kindness and carefulness and up
bearing love. which belonged to this great man.
And he was a man who believed in right,
who had a profound conviction that the
courses of this world must be ordered in ac
cordance with everlasting righteousness, or
this world's highest point of good can never
be reached; that no nation can expect satis
factory life except as it conforms to the eter
nal laws of the infinite Lord and shows itself
In Individual and collective activity, according
to- that, divine will. - And now may I say
further that It seems to me that to whatever
we may attribute all the illustriousness of this
man, all the greatness of his achievements,
whatever of that we may attribute to his in
tellectual character and quality, whatever of
it we may attribute to the patient and thor
ough study that he gave to the various ques
tions thrust upon him for attention; all his
successes as a politician, as a statesman, as a
man of this great country, those successes were
largely due to the moral qualities of which I
have spoken. They drew to him the hearts
of men everywhere and particularly of those
who best knew him
ever attempted to approach him in the way of
a bribe ; and we remember, with great felicita
tion at this time tor such an example to our
selves, that when great financial difficulties and
perils encompassed him, he determined to de
liver all he possessed to his creditors; that there
should be no challenge o* his perfect honesty
In the matter. A man of immaculate purity,
shall we say? No stain was upon his escutch
eon, no syllable of suspicion that 1 ever heard
was whispered against his character. He
walked In perfect and noble self-control.

The feeling against the anarchistic Ex
aminer Is not confined to the social cluba.
In restaurants, hotels, on steamboats, in
railway trains and in barber shops the
patrons insist that the paper shall not be
seen. Former subscribers who have given
orders that tho paper shall no longer be
served to them complain- that their orders
to "stop" have received no attention.
Carriers, doubtless acting under instruc
tions from the management, serve the
paper as usual.
By common Impulse, American citizens
seem to have reached a determination to
teach a lasting lesson to the promoters
of debased journalism. In the East the
New York Journal is the object of popu

spised. ---In San Francisco the Examiner,
the oldest and worst of the Hearst publi
cations, is held :n universal contempt. The
notion that business rivalry has anything
to do with the popular crusade against
the anarchistic yellow press is the rank
est nonsense. If every club in the United
States tabooed the Hearst publications
the circulation of other papers would not
be advanced by reason of the exclusion.
In California the people have simply
made up their minds that Hearst journal
ism is a blight on the State.
Â¦ Yesterday three well known clubs of the
cityâ the Cosmos, San Francisco and Mer

the Examiner. In each club action was
officially taken by the board of directors.
At the Union League the directors dis
cussed the proposition to exclude the pa
per, and decided to ascertain fully the
sentiment of the cJub membership before
adopting a resolution to banish the paper
from the premises. In other clubs of the
city the feeing against the yellow journal
is intense. Members insist that the direc
tors shall express the club sentiment by
dropping the paper. In advocating this
line of action members assert that they
have excluded the offensive publication
from their homes and places of business
and therefore have a right to demand
that the paper shall not be brought Into
clubs to which they belong. It is
acknowledged that this demand is un
usual and extreme, but they hold that

NEW YORK, Sept. 17.â Since the la
mentable occurrence in Buffalo,
Â¦which resulted In depriving the
American nation of a beloved
and respected chief, the news
papers, from one end of the
country to the other, have been
filled -with editorials condemnatory of
the cowardly deed and censuring with
out mercy the sensational and treason
able journalism -which, working on the
minds of murderous fanatics, has at last
accomplished something eo horrible and
Infamous that the minds of men are stag
gered at Its contemplation-
All of these editorials are doing their
part toward arousing a public sentiment
â¢which will eventually result in a long-de
sired and much-deeded reform. The in
dignation which they have aroused- will
not rest until Hearst, Most, Emma Gold
man and the lesser villains of their sect
are rendered harmlcsi. All classes are
. now uniting in a common cause and the
sentiment of the entire United States is
crystallized in the following utterances of
the New York Press which were written
while the President was hovering between
life and death:
"William R. Hearst, the editor of the
New York Journal, attempts to repudiate
Czolgosz, his partner in the assassination
of the President of the United States, by
abandoning him and calling for ven
geance on him. As tokens unmistakable
and proof absolute of that partnership we
submit the subjoined articles of previous
confession by William R. Hearst in his
Evening Journal of April 30, 1901:
We learn that at Buenos Ayres, far
away, and at Patcrson, near home,
and eUewhcre on the earth's surface
â¢olemn-faced anarchists are at work

ARRANGE FOR MEMORIAL
- SERVICES AT TJNIVEItSITy
The meeting was closed with a benedic
tion by the Rev. J. T. Wills after the
audience had sung Â¦"America."
Let us say to the depraved, vicious and vio
lent who would tarnish our good government,
"No thoroughfare. None . may enter here ex
cept those who are duly qualified."
The lesson of this dark tragedy is plain. Let
us not only stamp our heels upon the vile
monster of anarchy, but look higher and decry
the action of those in high places who are as
much responsible for this cruel crime as the
wretch is that fired the shot.
And when foreign people come to our shores
if they have no desire to make this nation
their nation, let them be driven back where
they were spawned to afflict their own land,
but to let us alone. We welcome all men who
come with jjood resolve and character. In
that way the death of this great man may be
a lesson, but let us never forget as we mourn
hi3 untimely death to execrate eternally t the
causes which led to the deep damnation of his
taking off.
Superior Judge Henry A.' Melvin ' was
introduced and said:
It is time that the pessimists, who from per
sonal mallKnity or from bad partisan zeal
preach that this is a bad country, shall re
ceive less attention and less toleration than
they have been receiving. Those men shall be
driven out who attack our Government. Let
us insist that when our chief magistrate shall
be shot down by an . assassin whose aim is
nerved by American incrates and malignant
men they shall be driven out.
It is a wise and truthful saying that discon
tent is the cause of human progreEs. but there
is a noble discontent that leads a man who is
not successful to examine himself by intro
spection to see where he is weak." and if he
have the strength to make repairs he will go
forward and there is no limit to the heights
which he. will reach. Then there is the igno
ble discontent that looks to blame some one
outside, but Is blind to its own weakness. The
President of the United States has fallen the
victim to the cultivation among the American
people of that icnoble discontent. It is time
that we insist upon the truth that this land
to-day, as it always was, is the best land' on
earth for humanity that I was ever known;
where man has the best opportunity for life,
happiness and prosperity.

Much is expected from the effort of Gen

General Barnes and McKinley struck up
a deep friendship during the President's
visit to this city. It is well known that
the President held General Barnes in

Procession to Capitol.
. As the hearse moved away the mourn
ers at the White House entered carriages
and followed Uhe body on its march to
the Capitol, where the funeral services
were to be held. It was thought early in
the morning that Mrs. McKinley might
feel strong enough to attend the services,
but it was finally decided that it would
be imprudent to tax her vitality more
than was absolutely necessary, and so
she concluded-to remain in her room, un
der thelmmediate care - of Dr.'. Rixey,
Mrs. Barber, her sister, and- her 9 niece,
Miss Barber. ....
' The public had been astir early and
the streets were crowded. Wire cables
strung along the entire route of march
from the White House to the Capitol
kept it clear for the funeral procession.
; At precisely 9 o'clock a silent command
was given and the body bearers silently
and reverently raised to their stalwart
shoulders the casket containing all that
is mortal of the illustrious dead. â¢â¢
Â¦ They walked with slow-cadenced step
and as they appeared at the main door
at the White House the Marine Band,
standing on the avenue opposite the man
sion, struck up the hymn the dead Presi
dent loved; so well, "Nearer, My God, to
Thee." There was perfect silence through
out the big mansion and. as the last strain
of music died away the throng In the
building lifted their heads, but their eyes
were wet. -:â¢.-Â¦Â¦Â¦.â¢'Â¦
Among the prominent women present
were Mrs. Garrett A. Hobart, widow of
former Vice President Hobart, who was

With silent salute they greeted him and
with them he mingled his tears in sorrow
for the dead.
Greeted With Silent Salute.
Grief had usurped the place of joy. As
with solemn and cadenced tread the pro
cession moved down the avenue, the peo
ple recognized as one of the mourners
their former President, Grover Cleveland,
who had come to pay his tribute to his
successor. They â¢ recognized, too, their
new President, upon whom the responsi
bilities of chief executive had been thrust
so unexpectedly. . . ..â¢â?Â¦â¢ ...
With aching hearts all remembered that
only a ' few months ago the dead Presi
dent, then in the fullness of life and tri
umph, had passed along that same
thoroughfare to be inaugurated a. second
time President. The flags that had flut
tered greetings to him in March' were
furled and crape-bedecked in September.
The cheers of spring bcame the sobs of
autumn. .
Recently in Triumph.
ing people bared their heads despite the
rain and the many tear-stained faces be
spoke, their grief more eloquently than
words. It was a silent throng. Â»
Canton is ready for the last home
coming of William McKinley. In other
days she welcomed him with cheers, with
waving banner's and triumphal marches.
To-morrow she will receive him In silence,
with streets hung with solemn black and
with the wailing notes of dirges. All day
along hundreds of men and women have
labored in their task of arranging the
decorations on the public buildings, on the
fronts of commercial houses and over the
windows and .porches of residences. At
sunset to-night Canton was shrouded in
black and bo she will remain until the
body of her best loved son has been com
mitted to. the vault In Westlawn Ceme
tery. .
At frequent intervals during the day
there have resounded from the pavements
thÂ« sound of marching feet as a military
or civic organization made its way into
the city to be in readiness for the duties
of to-morrow and of, Thursday. They
are but the first wave of the human tide
which is to come. From early morning
until late in the evening there has been
a constant procession of visitors moving
along North Market street to the McKin
ley homeâ a house easily distinguished
from all others on the street, In that it
is the only one not draped In black. There
is to-day no sign of mourning on the
house, nor will there be until the dead
President has been borne through its door
way on Wednesday night Throughout
the day visitors have stood in knots un
der the trees that line the walks in front
or hung over the low iron fence/ talking
low and in whispers as if the illustrious
dead were already within its walls.
As far as lies within its power, the local
committees have completed their arrange
ments for the funeral. Wednesday's pro
gramme Is arranged, and Thursday's, too

visitors into Canton, but that flood will
flow to-morrow. At 10 o'clock this morn-
Ing not a room could be had in any of the
hotels, and there is much apprehension on
the part of the citizens of Canton that it
may be impossible to provide all the visit
ors with quarters. Provisions have been
made for feeding them, but if the crowds
are as large as telegrams received here
lead the people to expect, a large number
of people will be compelled to walk the
streets all of Thursday night.

Robertson this afternoon- issued a procla

of 10 a. m. and 9 p. m. on' Wednesday
night no traffic, vehicles, automobiles or
bicycles, will bo allowed on those streets
which are to be used by the funeral cor

of the Canton committee extends to-night.

whether the family 'will agree to this Is
Jiot known yet. The time allowed for the
entire exercises in the church is forty

The programme Is not entirely arranged
for the services, but they will be simpleâ
a discourse by the Rev. C. E. Manchester,
of the First Methodist Church, a prayer
by the Rev. C. H. Milligan of the Presby

some clergyman not yet selected; a quar

Ralph Brown will sing "Lead, Kindly

of Misses Hattle Levinger, Fannie Lev

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17. -President
Roosevelt, at 3 6'clock to-day,
convened his first Cabinet meet
ing held in Washington. At this
meeting the President asked the
members of Mr. McKhiley's Cab
inet to retain their respective
portfolios throughout his term and an
nounced that his administration would
follow the policy outlined by President
McKinley in hi.<3 Buffalo speech.
After the obsequies over the late Pres
ident the Cabinet, at President Roose
velt's request, assembled at the residence
of Commander Cowles, where the Presi
dent is staying until after the funeral,
principally for the purpose of informing
their -new chief of the state of affairs
in their respective departments. The
President desired to learn if there were
nny matters of moment requiring his at
tention before his departure to-night for
Canton. He was assured that there was
nothing of pressing importance.
The President then addressed his ad
visers collectively, as he had previously
clone individually, requesting them all to
retain their respective positions in his
Cabinet. Mr. Roosevelt expressed the
hope and expectation that every mem
ber would serve throughout his term,
tor he said, he tendered the appoint
ments as if he had just been elected to
the Presidency and was forming an orig
inal Cabinet. The President said, how
ever, that there; was one difference be-
and love to the memory of the dead mag
istrate.
Besides holding the Cabinet meeting
President Roosevelt saw a few callers
during the afternoon. At 7:30 o'clock he
and Commander Cowles left the latter's
residence for the Pennsylvania Railroad
station to take the train for Canton.
Mrs. Roosevelt will leave- here at 10
o clock to-morrow moraine for Oyster
Bay, LI.
The discussion turned upon the policy
of the administration and air. Roosevelt
announced that he regarded the speech
of the late President at the Buffalo Pan-
American Exposition, made previous to
the tragic shooting, as outlining the pol
icies to be followed by tho administra
tion. It cannot be learned at this time
whether or not all the members would
be willing to serve the full term.
The Cabinet members, with the excep
tion of Secretaries Hay and Long, will
accompany the remains of the dead Pres
ident to Canton and participate In the
funeral ceremonies on Thursday. Secre
taries Hay and Long remained in Wash
ington at the President's request, Mr.
Roosevelt thinking that some members
of the Cabinet should continue in Wash
ington.
tween the present tender and that of an
original offer, namely, that under the
present circumstances they were not at
liberty to decline.
Upon being asked by a member If resig
nations should be formally presented in
the usual manner the President answered
that his action at this meeting had pre
cluded the necessity of presenting resig
nations. â¢

He mixed up with the crowd surrounding
the bookmakers' stands, and, exposing his
waistcoat front unnecessarily, had a valu

some light-fingered "chooser." All the
balance of the talent made money.
It was the second day of the Golden

again large and, as Gusto and Almoner,

and Flo Culver, and Decoy. were not over

even. "\ ' Â¦â¢ "
First came the 2:12 pace, with a field of
six scoring down. The track is not the
best in the world for harness horses, and
the time may prove misleading. Edna R
was at first installed favorite, but the
mare could do nothing. John A captured
the first heat at 4 to 1 and then retired.
Doc Wilkes, another 4 to 1 chance, now
took up the play and did not quit until he
had made it three straight, insuring, the
healthy end of the purse for his owner,

finishing second. -
Ransch Wins With Flo Culver.
Although Willie Sink's Dawson had
never shown to any startling advantage,
the youngster had J: Ransch on his back
and went to the post an even money
chance for the two-year-old scramble. He
had a small quantity of early speed, but
was easily beaten at the ciose by Flo
Culver, a 3 to 1 shot, ridden by Duggan.
Show honors went to Flattered.
Even money . against Almoner, with
Ruiz up, to win the six furlong dash fol
lowing, looked good enough to go broke
on. The handicappers did wade into it
pretty deeply, and the gelding came home
by himself. Hoar landed Katie, Walcott
in the place ahead of First Shot.
In another six furlong run which fol
lowed the Schorr colors were seen for the
first time this season, Triaditza starting
with J. Woods in the saddle. The mare
.looks skeleton rigged and could finish no
better than third. Gusto, with plenty of
6 to 5 about him in the books and Ransch
taking a trick at the wheel, won all the
way. Flamero blew Into the place the
last sixteenth. Merops acted badly at the
post, finally dumping Hoar over his head.
The gelding then, started back for the
stable, describing a well-defined somer
sault in taking the fence. Appearing none
the worse for his trip, he was galloped
back to the post and went away with his
field, but pulled up with one fore leg in
need of the boiler Inspector." Only a short
time ago Frank Weir lost Ralston through
an accident, then Prestidigitator broke
down and now another of the string is
shelved. . ' Â¦ " " '.
Not even the "braves" had the temerity
to back Decoy when speculation began on
the mile and sixteenth run, allowing the
gelding to run loose at 5 to 1. -*"Chub"
Russell took him out in the lead, the soft
going suited his underpinning and Alicia
got up in time to lose out by less than a

I.OS ANGELES, Sept. 17.â James . J.
Jeffries, champion boxer of the world,
failed to stop "Hank" Griffin, a local
colonbd heavyweight, in four rounds here
to-night. He had agreed to give the
colored man $100 if he failed to put him
out. Griffin weighed ' ISO pounds and
looked like a famine sufferer. Jeffries
weighed about 220 pounds.
The bout took place in Hazard's Pavi
lion, which contained fully 5000 people.
The big champion of the world rushed the
colored man at the beginning of the Â£rst
round and had him down quickly by sim
ply pushing him over. "Hank" was up
and fighting in two seconds, however, and
succeeded in landing several times on the
champion's chest. In the second Griffin
seemed to be inclined to mix It a little,
but changed his mind when the champion
jabbed him in the ribs. He did little ex
cept try to hold the big man's arms. He
was down nine seconds on two different
occasions.
Jeffries went after the colored man at
the commencement of the third, but the
other made a running race of it, occasion
ally stopping long enough to tap Jeffries
lightly before the big man could locate
him. Jeffries went after him aggressively
in the fourth, but the colored man kept
on the run, occasionally striking back.
He stayed out the round.
There was a preliminary of fifteen
rounds between Clyde Burnman, colored,
and Kid Solomon, which was awarded to
Soloman on points. .

The price of potatoes in the East has been so high
for some time past that the newspapers have been
seriously discussing the advisability of using some
sort of substitute for them. This is certainly a curious
condition to prevail in any part of the United
States. We used to be told that the Irish came to
this country because they w could get nothing but
potatoes Â¦ at home, but now if they have to
hunt a substitute for the potato itself when they
get here they will probably come to the conclusion
that the country is a gold brick. , â¢ ..

APPRECIATES
THE ENTERPRISE
OF THE CALL
The' day's work over, Mr.- Rockefeller
times himself to catch a train from the
Grand Central station at half past 3
o'clock. There Is always a buckboard at
Mr. Rockeleller at noon patronizes a
Broad-street cafe, where he partakes of a
frugal luncheon, for which he allows him
self thirty minutes. The meal rarely costs
him more than 30 cents.
Punctual to the minute in business en
gagements, one might set a clock by Mr.
Rockefeller's daily schedule. During the
summer he makes his home at Box
wood, the country seat of John D. Rocke
feller, In Tarrytown. He i 3 up at half past
G every morning, and for the ensuing hour
may be seen about the Rockefeller sta
bles or at the woodpile chopping wood, a
form of exercise to which he long "ago be
came accustomed. Breakfast over, he
drives to the railroad station In time to
catch the train leaving Tarrytown for
New York at twenty minutes to 9 o'clock.
One hour later he is at his desk -in the
office of the Standard OH Company, in.
lower Broadway. He is never late.
Likes to Chop Wood.
since his college days, when he was a
member of the Alpha Delia Phi at Brown
University, he is one of the best-dressed
men in New York. He is partial to quiet
colors, but his clothing is always fashion
ed from the choicest fabrics.
Only once has Mr. Rockefeller been.
knoTfn to speculate. That was when he
first came from college. A lucky "turn"
in the shares of the United States Leather
Company netted him $400,000. but he Js
said to have lost his profits and a consid
erable sum In addition by a subsequent
"slump." He decided after this experience
to leave speculation to others.
It is in such an atmosphere that young
Mr. Rockefeller has been reared. Home
ties were stronger than ths blandishments
of society, and if he ever had a sweet
heart before his meeting with Miss Al
drich the fact la not generally known.
Almost primitive In its simplicity, the
home life of the Rockefellers i3 yet de
lightful. IMnner is served at 6 o'clock. In.
three coursesâ scup, a roast and dessert.
Then comes the family gathering. When
Mr. Rockefeller's daughters were at horna
piano recitals, with violin accompaniment,
preceded a service of song and family
prayers. Now father and son provide the
music, and John D. Rockefeller Jr., who
possesses a fine voice, is often heard ren
dering solo selections.
Some' Life of the Rockefellers.
Tarrytown to meet him, and he takes keen
pleasure In driving a dashing pair of baya
up the hill and on to Boxwood. The re
mainder of the day he devotes to pleas
ures of his own choosingâ reading, violin
playing or walks about the estate.

-Again, the Tribune says that only by threatening
paralysis of business could the strikers carry their
point. Over and over again the labor unions are put
as the analogue of the corporations. Suppose now

of the State, and making its "merchants and manufac
turers suffer enormous losses and the State a severe
commercial setback," and suppose they had enforced
thispoint by beating men, picking their^ pockets and
had assumed the functions of government by issuing
safe conducts to protect against the thugs - and
thieves used by them to effect their- purpose, what
remedy would the Tribune propose?
But here are the strike leaders impersonating all
the functions of government and posing as the very
lords of life and death!
That offer by the strike leaders^ is their admission
that they have made the streets of San Francisco un
safe for non-union labor. It is their gloating admis
s.ion that they can do what the Governor, Mayor and
police have not done â guarantee the safety of men in
this city. When such leaders assume one of the
highest and most delicate functions of government by
issuing safe conducts, they confess that they have
made the streets unsafe. By assuming that function
they are impersonating government. Only the ex
ecutive power of a Government can proclaim martial
law, -compel citizens to avoid the streets to evade
death, and give them safe conduct on necessary busi
ness. But these strike leaders are doing all this
and admitting it. Is it no . crime to impersonate
Government? If one man impersonate an officer
and arrest another, or do any act lawful when done
by the officer he impersonates, he is severely pun
ished by the law either as a misdemeanant or a felon.
Is the Tribune aware that furnishing. a safe con
duct to men is the function of an officer of. the Gov-.
crnment, of a commanding officer in charge of a
district that is under martial law?
That this is the policy of the union leaders has
been over and over again demonstrated. English
sailors .on a British ship were attacked and beaten,
and when their captain appealed to the British Vice
Consul and he seemed about to appeal to Federal
authority for protection, to which his sailors are en
titled in an American port, the strike leaders kindly
offered to furnish his men a guard and a safe conduct
when they desire to come ashore!
Now it is known of all men triat there could not
have been a day's tie-up of business by the strike had
it not been for the intimidation of men willing to
work by the use of personal violence. It is not neces
sary for this violence to be expressed by large mobs.
It was executed by sneaking bands of cowards, who,
outnumbering their victims five to ten to one, way
laid them in dark corners and alleys, and disabled
them by cruel beating and kicking and clubbing.
The Tribune continues: 'The industrial tie-up, as
set forth by the State Board of Trade, is in truth
the very outcome sought by the workmen and affords
the only way in which they can win. What they did
anticipate is the very condition the State Board of
Trade now admits to exist â business becoming so
paralyzed that unless relief is -quickly obtained the
merchants and manufacturers will suffer enormous
losses and the State be given a severe commercial
setback."
This reads strangely in the face of the fact that
in five weeks there have been two thousand assaults
made in this city upon American citizens who were
peacefully laboring. The maritime laws of the
United States have been violated by gangs of ruf
fians boarding anchored ships at night, driving their
crews over the side under threat with guns and pis
tols to kill them, and taking the prisoners ashore to
first beat and .then rob them. Laborers have been
caught by strikers and their arms broken with iron
bars. In these affairs nearly fifty highway robberies
have been committed by strikers, who first beat their
victims into insensibility and then stole their money.
That paper calmly remarks that: "There have been
no riots, no threatening assemblages and no seditious
speeches; in fact, outside of'the individual instances
of assault there has been no law-breaking and no dis
order on the part of the strikers."
THE Oakland Tribune deprecates,, the action of
the State Board of Trade in calling the atten
tion of the Governor of the State to the losses
already sustained and worse impending, by the coun
try producers, as a result of unlawful prevention of
the handling of grain and other perishable property
belonging to the farmers. .
POOR REASONING.

society and has never/ belonged to a club
PERSONAL MENTION.
Miss Aldrich'3 fiance is not a devotee of
society, and no club claims him as a mem
ber; he does not drink and has never used
tobacco In any form; his colors are not
registered with the Jockey Club, and It is
said he has never witnessed a horse race;
he "does not own a yacht; he rarely at
tends the theater, and then only as a
patron . of music, and for other sportive
pastimes of the young men of the day he
has no taste. Nevertheless Mr. Rocke
feller is not without healthful resources.
He is an athlete of no mean order, he is
not averse to driving behind Â«, fast. horse
and is an accomplished violinist. But
it is as the teacher of the young men's
Bible class in the Fifth Avenue Baptist
Church that Mr. Rockefeller finds his
greatest pleasure. There for three years
he has conducted Bible studies, assisted at
times by his father, who in this work, as
in everything else, is his guide and philo
sopher.
. In personal appearance Mr. Rockefeller
bears little resemblance to his father. He
is about five feet eight inches in height, of
slight but well knit frame, and his fea
tures are pale and intellectual. His eyes
are blue and are shaded by eyebrows of
black, brushy hair,- which almost meet.
When seated at his desk he wears rimless
glasses, and his aspect is that of a divin
ity student rather than of the man of af
fairs. , â¢ , . . . Â¦
A Model Young Man.
'.John D. Rockefeller Jr. was born In
Ohio and spent the first fifteen years of
his life on an estate near Cleveland. Mr.
Rockefeller, ' to . test his son's mental
trend, offered him one cent for every
picket he .found' displaced on the farm
fence. Young Rockefeller walked around
the ientire estate â a day's journey for a
lad of his ageâ and netted thirteen cents.
He was still looking for defective pickets
at nightfall, when Mr. Rockefeller came
Â¦upon him in a far corner of the estate. It
is related that the thirteen cents thus
earned judiciously invested, has grown to
$12,000.
From early boyhood Mr. Rockefeller has
been under his father's personal direction.
His education was shaped along lines of
usefulness,, and he has had constantly in
mind .' the, â¢ carser awaiting him, its re
sponsibilities and burdens, and the relief
of his father from the strain under which
he has long labored.
.Entering the office of the Standard Oil
Company three years ago, fresh f f om
Brown University, he has advanced stead
ily -from a junicr clerkship to the position
of financial director of the great corpora
tion, his principal duties being to keep in
touch with the securities market and pro
tect the investments of the company and
of . its Individual stockholders. His apti
tude has surprised and delighted John D?
Rockefeller Sr. . .'.Â¦Â¦â
: .' t. cently announced. Is destined to .be-,
come a potential factor in affairs. By
education, training and temperament he
is equipped, at the age of 28, to assume
the responsibilities involved in the direc
tion of his father's vast interests, and in
a large measure has already done so.

The News Letter, San Francisco, says: "From the idea that the police are op
pressors to the idea that the President is a tyrant is a logical step^ From the idea that
to resist the police is laudable to the idea that resistance to the chief executive of the
nation is praiseworthy is an easy step for the restless and turbulent. To the more vio
lent of them resistance means murder, and if the murder of a police officer is a good
deed the slaying of the President is a better one. The Examiner's utterances have
never been taken by the intelligent as of much worth. Within the last few months it has
proven itself the most unscrupulous of journals, and has come out brazenly as the mouth
piece of the. mob."
Commenting on the statement of the Ukiah Times that the Examiner's strikers
are driving .women; and children^ put, of^employment in the hop fields by ; taking their
places at much lower wages, The Herald, Windsor,. Cal., says: "The Times forgets that in
the estimation of theYstrikers there are no noble men -but union^ men. -They leave
enough brutal bullies in the cities to intimidate and â¢beat almbst'to death any arid all men
from the country who go to the city and attempt tc 1 work, while they, the strikers., go
out into the country and monopolize the work at greatly reduced wages, and while this
double-cross i t is being worked on the country people by the strikers who had no occa
sion for striking, the leaders of the un-American mob in * San Francisco are appealing to
the country laboring people for sympathy." â¢
Times-Index, San Bernardino: "The Examiner has a streak of repentance for the
awful consequences of its treachery, and is printing pages of prayers in place of its usual
diatribes against the President. But it^does not deceive the public. Its* repentance is a
pretense, the result of fear."
People's Cause, Red Bluff: "The greatest sinners compose "the triumvirate of
yellow journals published by William R. Hearst. They inculcate in the minds of their
'readers the ideas which create and foster the dissatisfaction which breeds anarchy." .,
Tribune, New York: "Thcfce who have portrayed the President as an oppressor and
a tool of oppressors, of the common people, let them look to it that/some of his blood be
not found upon their gloved but unclean hands." - . . ' ' Â¦â¢' ;. 'â¢ Â¦ Â¦
Times, LOS Angeles: "The Examiner has been doing- all in its power to incite an
archy. As The Call properly says in an article we reproduced yesterday, Hearst is a
coward and his papers are enemies of American institutions, of law and order."
â¢ Graphic, Oakdale, Cal.: "In Oakdale a man said the murder of the President
was all right â the country would be better off without him. .This is treason against the
country and its citizens. But men have been educated to infamous suggestions of an
archy by the San Francisco Examiner."
Gazette, Berkeley, Cal.: "From New York to San Francisco, and from Michigan
to Texas, the press of the United States is scoring those promoters of disorder and an
archy, those inflamers of public passion, those incitefs to riot, those three stinkpots of
American journalism ewned by Hearst." , v . ,
Here space compels us to rest again. â¢ r The duty that impels the publication of this
indictment .of Hearst and his papers by the people of the United States is not pleasant,
but its discharge is necessary. It was easy for his local hirelings to, say to this 'com
munity that only The Call held these views, . and would . be attended to by them at the
proper time. Therefore our readers need to know that in every State, in the Union the
press and the people. :think. as we think,. and rise as one in expression of their horror
and detestation. As far as The Call is concerned, when Mr. Hearst gets ready let him
proceed to attend to us. v r
Evening Wisconsin, Milwaukee: "There have been cartoons in daily issues from
the press which have mendaciously pictured the President as the tool of, greedy conspira
tors, bent upon wresting the last crust Jrom the starving poor. To the inflamed imag
ination of an anarchist these things would seem like support for his sulphurous creed."

of President McKinley contributed their share to his undoing, should now. portray him

The. Commoner, Colonel Bryan's paper, says: "There is no place for anarchy in
the United States; there is no room for those who commit, counsel- or condone murder,
no matter. what political excuse may be urged in its defense. The line between peace
ful agitation and violence is clear and distinct. If any one desires to criticize the methods
of government he has a perfect right to do so, but his appeal must be to the intelli
gence and patriotism of his fellow-citizens, not to force."
Review, Elmhurst, Cal.: "Sheets like the Examiner have done more to keep alive
the anarchist 11 spirit in our land than all other agencies: combined."
Herald, NileS, Cal.I "No paper has come out in detail and called down the Exami
iner and its' Eastern issues in'such magnificent style as The Call, for which it should re
ceive due credit. But all the talk will amount to nothing if those who believe papers
which breed anarchy, discontent and crime continue >to subscribe for them." ,

*â¢ opinion to read, "An Anarchist paper for Anarchists."
The News, Newark, N. J. f " says of the^ Hearst papers: "Their infamy is only made
the more manifest by the crocodile tears which they are. now shedding over the results
of their own teachings. Now that their propaganda has reached its legitimate outcome,
they slop over with sorrow and are maudlin in their nauseating sympathy. Out upon
such hypocrisy!" Â¦
Journal, Chicago: "The Journal is not alone in its opinion that William R. Hearst
and his newspapers are responsible for the crime of Czolgosz! By the most reckless
assertions, by caricature, by libelous pictures, they have tried" to bring the President into
the contempt of his fellow-citizens.-- They could not have r made- more scandalous, more
bitter or more degrading charges against the greatest scoundrel on earth. . The seed
thus sown daily has at last-found receptive soil and brought forth fruit after 'Its kind.

FINKLE-DAVIES WEDDING
The board of trustees unanimously
voted to allow the use of the Mechanics'
Pavilion free of charge for the memorial
services for the late President McKinley
to be held to-morrow afternoon.
No definite offer has been made by the
city to the institute for the acquisition of
the pavilion site other than a suggestion
from Mayor Phelan that the city would
like to have the property donated, or fail
ing: that it would desire to learn what
price it could be purchased for.
The question was informally discussed
by the trustees and it was finally decided
to call a special meeting of all the mem
bers of the institute for next Tuesday
evening and lay the matter before them.
The most important matter discussed
was the question of "the disposal of the
pavilion site to the city. In order that the
offer of three-quarters of a million dollars
from Andrew Carnegie might be accepted
by the municipality.
The board of trustees of the Mechanics'
Institute held a meeting at the Institute
rooms on Post street last evening, all the
members being present.
After he had made several vain at
tempts to secure his children himself
Hamburger applied to the charitable so
ciety. Action was taken immediately,
and during the course of the investigation
carried on by Secretary 'White another
child was found living in the vile resort,
who will also soon be removed to more
suitable surroundings.
Mr. Hamburger learned in the course of
a week or two that his children were
kept in the filthy saloon on Clara street
and were forced to mingle with men and
women of the lowest class. He went at
once to Mrs. Brewster and demanded that
she surrender them. This she refused to
do until she should be paid $8 for the
trouble to which she had been put and
until a beer bill which Hamburger had
contracted had also been settled.
Mrs. Breweter replied, and on her rep
resentations that she would bring- them
up properly they were delivered into her
charge, with the agreement that she
should be paid $16 monthly for their
board.
Franz Hamburger, the father, is a
wireworker in a factory on North Beach,
and subsequent to the death of his wife,
which occurred recently, he decided tfcat
he could not care for the children in con
nection with his other employment, and
so advertised for a home for them.
Secretary White of the California So
ciety fcr the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children rescued a little boy and a llttlo
girl from a saloon at 156 Clara street
yesterday, where they were being held by
the owner for a debt contracted by their
father. It was with great difficulty that
the officers of the society succeeded in
freeing the little ones from their tempor
ary prison, but Mrs. Ruth Brewster, who
had them in charge, was finally forced to
yield, and the children have been placed
with the Protestant Orphan Asylum offi
cials, who Tfill look out for their future
welfare.

The City Front Federation has pur
chased a restaurant at 150 East street and
placed it in the hands of the subsistence
committee. Meal tickets are; to be Issued
to strikers in lieu of cash benefits.
The Team Drivers' International Union
In Chicago appropriated $1000 Monday for
the San Francisco strikers, and the lake
seamen, with headquarters in Chicago, ap
propriated a like sum.
The executive committee of the City
Front Federation is preparing for another
mass-meeting: to be held in Metropolitan
Temple Saturday night. Father Yorke
will be the principal speaker, and Andrew
Furuseth will review the situation.
The strike leaders report contributions
from outside unions to the local strike
funds, and assert their ability to hold out
for months. The City Front Federation
lately received $500 from British Columbia
coal miners, and advices from Nanalmo
were received yesterday to the effect that
$300 more had been appropriated.
A check for $500 was received yesterday
by Secretary Rosenberg of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council from the National
Association of Brewery Workers,- now in
convention at Philadelphia. It is to be
applied to benefits for the local brewery
workers. ~ v .
longed siege. Attacks upon non
union laborers are increasing In number
and viciousness, and business men agree
that lawlessness â Is reaching a. stage
where harsh measures must be taken. A
vigilance committee even Is. talked of, to
take in hand public officials who refuse,
in spite of attacks daily in which non
union men are most brutally beaten, to
admit that disorder prevails.

PAVILION SITE
MEN KEPT
TO SECURE BILL
"A state of anarchy prevails in this city In conse
quence of the lawlessness of many of the strikers," Mr.
Renner said. "Men who are trying to earn an honest
living are waylaid, beaten almost to a jelly, and robbed
in the bargain. I know of several cases where Inoffensive
men were attacked and their arms' deliberately broken
by the assailaiits. Were It not for the leaders of the strik
ers the men would return to work within twenty-four
hours. If a teamster is found with grit enough to assert
Manager George Renner of the Draymen's Association
said yesterday that the necessity of stringent measures
was generally recognized and that a vigilance committee
was widely advocated. He stated that he was in sympa
thy with the proposition and hoped a movement to that
end would be inaugurated.
THE lawlessness prevailing in the city at the present
time, and which has created veritably a reign of
terror, was the' subject of discussion among busi
ness men yesterday, and, according to Manager
Renner of the Draymen's Association, the opinion
was freely expressed that steps ought to be taken for the
appointment of a vigilance committee of the same gen
eral scope and character as the famous organization
which struck terror to and purged the city of the lawless
element in San Francisco in 1856. The failure of Mayor
Phelan and Governor Gage to provide the relief de
manded by the citizens is regarded by many reputable
business men as being tantamount to the command to do
the next best thing, namely, to appoint such a com
mittee.
INDIFFERENCE OF AUTHORITIES TO LAWLESSNESS
CAUSES SUGGESTION OF VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
his intention to return to work, he. is notified that. If he
does so he will be murdered. I have been warned that"
men are lying in wait to attack me,' and that it has been
said among the teamsters that if I were permanently
removed from the scene the strike would soon be set
tled. In -other words, this is an indirect way of setting
a price upon my head. I do not fear the cowardly scoun
drels who lurk in the dark and spring upon their victims
unawares. Still, the situation is grave enough to. excite
alarm In the breasts of conservative citizens. It is to
bring this sort of thing to a close that the subject of or
ganizing a vigilance* committee has been broached. If
the Governor and Mayor decline to help us we must help*
ourselves. Crime is on the increase in this city and un
less we stir ourselves speedily no man's life will be safe
a single moment. The condition of affairs here Is a dis
grace to civilization and a reproach upon mankind. When
men's limbs are deliberately broken by human brutes
In order to prevent their victims working a stage has
been reached which requires summary treatment. "We are
deprived of the liberties supposed to be guaranteed to
Americans. A determined committee of honest men who
have the welfare of the community at heart will accom
plish wonders in this direction."
It is said a circular. is being: prepared outlining the
plans of the proposed committee, and that this will be
sent to alf the leading business, men of the city with .the
request that' they Identify themselves with the move
ment with the same spirit that animated the daring- spir
its who guided the destinies of the city in the fifties.

usually favorable in most sections during the
week.. The greater part of the first crop of
raisin grapes is on the trays. In some sections
the yield of crapes is said to be better than
expected and the quality is excellent in all
places. Late peaches, and apples are yielding
good crops. Citrus fruits are In excellent con

The sxaln and hay crops are being thrashed

CLOSING.
The stock market to-day was firm, but the
Idleness was accentuated by the closing of
the exchange on ( Thursday, owing . to the
funeral of President McKlnley, by the Czar
holiday In Paris on Saturday, by the Jewish
holiday on Monday and by settlement on Tues
day. The London Exchange received grateful
acknowledgment of Its sympathetic mesrages
to the New York and Philadelphia exchanges.
The American department opened firm, but
prices eased on profit-taking and some cautious
bear selling Induced the. belief that the pace
had been overdone. The quietness was marked
after yesterday's rush. Prices hesitated after
the New York opening, then hardened, closing
buoyant. There was strong buying of Erie
and less active support of Missouri, Kansas
and Texas, Pacific, Chicago, MI1
waukt* and St. Paul and Southern stocks.

NEW YORK. Sept. 17.â The occasional
rtrength In to-day's stock market was not
very convincing and as^ the day progressed
proved less and less so/ The market closed
distinctly weak, with practically all of the
early gains completely wiped out and the
average level of prices well below last night.
This was perhaps a natural reaction from the
violent rebound of prices yesterday. The arti
ficial stimulants which were applied to the
market yesterday to maintain it against the
expected pressure were withdrawn to a con-
Fiderable extent to-day, even this having dem
onstrated that they were not needed. Sup
porting orders continued in the market to-day
and there was considerable manipulation also
for the rite. This was particularly evident
after the reaction in prices which followed the
opening dealings. The recovery had the effect,
which was probably designed, of checking the
disposition to realize on the part of traders.
A number of special stocks were selected
then for a demonstrative upward movement.
The Influence on the general list
which was exercised by these tactics was
taken advantage of to take profits by the
large financial interests which bought/ to hus
tain the market yesterday and in tM slump
of Friday. The large reduction in the short
interest which was caused by the buying to
cover forced by yesterday's advance made
lteelf manifest In the much smaller competi
tive demand for stocks from elsewhere. While
yesterday's rally had served ltd purpose of
restoring confidence, Â»o far as that had been
Jacking regarding the effects of the untimely
death of the chief magistrate, the tone of
the money market and other considerations
tending to repress speculation and normal to
this period of the year reasserted themselves.
The money market continued easy, as reflected
in the lower rates for call loans under the
Influence of the disbursements by the sub
treasury, but the reller In this quarter had
the natural effect of steadying the exchange
market and the expectation that announce
ment would be made to-day of engagements
of gold for Import was disappointed. The ex
change rate, however, hovers near to the gold
Import point and foreign bankers are making
constant Calculations as to possible profits on
a gold movement. London's change of position
In our f lock market from the buying to the
selling Fide was an additional 'Influence In
steadying exchange rates. The stocks selected
for the bull demonstrations were St. Paul,
Union Pacific. .Missouri Pacific, Sugar, the
New York Tractions and Western Union.
There were various minor stocks which rose
a point or more. Amalgamated Copper was
persistently weak and encountered heavy sell
ing on the early rallies. Late In the day it
fell 3 points below last night and closed at
a net loss of 2%.
The bond market was Irregular. Total sales
$2,308,000.

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail advices from New York say: "There
Is very little activity in any line on the spot
anJ th; market continues easy. Throughout
the whole list of dried fruits there is scarcely
an article that is wanted except in the small
est way to supply immediate needs. The
greater abundance of fresh fruits, the de
moralized raisin situation on the coast and
the near approach of new goods in all lines
are the -chief causes of the existing dullness.
Currants are easier on the spot, due to the
prospective arrival of new goods by way of
England in about a week and the slow de
ms.nd. Sales of Amelias, It Is reported, have
been made at SUc spot. New currants by first
steamer, due in October, are offered at various
prices. Good quality is selling at about 6c.
â¢'Supplies of new Valencia raisins were in
creased by the arrival of 10,000 boxes on the
Perugia lrom Denia. These goods offer at
fie. Domestic raisins are practically un
chansed. The coast situation is still very bad
end buyers shew almost no interest in .offer
ing cf new crop.
"New ganta Clara prunes are offered at
W4Â©5\4c basis for 40s and smaller, with a few
featured sales reported. Apricots are easier.
Falee of three cars of choice and fancy new
trocdE. to come from the coaÂ»t, are reported
to a jobber, price not reported. Peaches are
steady and buyers show possibly a little more
interest. Choice Muirs are offered at 6^ic by
most holders, although sale of a single car
Â¦was rejx>rted made late in the week at Uc
lese.
"Evaporated apples continue very easy, but
quotations are nominally unchanged. No in
terest is taken in futures. Old waste Is dull
and chops entirely nominal. Future waste is
offered at 2',ic with no bids: future chops
at 2\c, with bids of 2VÂ»c Raspberries are
wanted, but there are v#ry few to be had."

The event of the morning session which !
caused the most lively interest was the
announcement by Dr. Beard that Dr.
Herbert F. Briggs, who so astonished the
conference yesterday by withdrawing
from the ministry, had reconsidered his
determination. Vesterday's action ! was
expunged from the minutes of the con
ference and Dr. Briggs was fully rein
stated. . ,
The following appointments to pastor

The object of this federation, which is
to unite in co-operative activity all the
churches and Christian workers of tho
State, is meeting with general approval
and it seems likely to reach the definite
point of organization. -

While it is understood, and, in fact,
never has been denied, that President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hay have held
divergent opinions regarding the trans
isthmian canal, the President feels that
it is no more than right that Mr. Hay
should carry through to a success the
treaty with which his name is intimately
connected. He desired that history shall
give to Secretary Hay credit for the work
which he has done. This was made plain
to Secretary Hay to-day.
When the ' funeral train arrived in
Washington from Buffalo last night Pres
ident Roosevelt entered a carriage with
Secretaries Hay and Gage and was driven
to the residence of his brother-in-law,
Commander Cowles of the navy. Ar
rangements were then made for a later
conference of the three. At this confer
ence Mr. Gage gave the President a defi
nite promise. He said that he would re
main in the Cabinet and that he would
do his best to carry through to a success
ful conclusion the policies originated by
President McKinley for the Treasury De
partment.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.-A slight
change has been made in President
Roosevelt's plans regarding the Cabinet.
In effect each Cabinet position has been
declared vacant and original appoint
ments have been made to the present
members. All have accepted. It is un
derstood that Mr. Hay will remain afl
Secretary of State until after the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty is concluded, when he
will leave the Cabinet, which will then
disintegrate. Mr. Root, it is understood
has already been promised that he shall
be made Secretary of State. Mr. Gage
has given a ", flat-footed ' promise ~ that
he 1 will remain at the head of the Treas
ury Department through the administra
tion, and it is probable that Attorney
General Knox will remain where he is.

Just at 1 o'clock a frightful calamity
was narrowly averted at the east front
of the Capitol. For hours the vast throng
of people had been massed in front of the
Capitol awaiting an opportunity to enter
the rotunda. When the* doors were
opened tens of thousands of people rushed
almost frantically . to the main staircase.
The police and military guards were
swept aside and almost in a twinkling
there was a tremendous crush at the foot
of. the great staircase. The Immense
throng swept backward and forward like
the surging of a mighty sea. Women and
children, a few of the latter babes , In
arms, were caught in the crowd and many
were badly hurt. Strong men held chil
dren Â¦ and even women high above the
heads of the surging crowd to protect
them from bodily injury. Despite the ef
forts of the police and military and cooler
heads in the throng approximately a hun
dred people were Injured. Some of the
more seriously hurt were carried into tho
rotunda and into various adjoining apart
ments of the Capitol, where fresh air
treatment was given them. Many were
hurried to the hospitals in ambulances,
but the majority were taken subsequently
to their homes. After tho crush had been
abated, 'upon the etaircase and on the
plaza immediately In front of it were
found tattered pieces of jnen'tt and
women'* wearing apparel of oil kinds,
crushed liatn, gloves and oven eatnhfllB,

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17.â At the con

that the immediate friends of the dead
President might be afforded the comfort
of a last glance at his features and that
the people whom he loved and who loved
him might pass the bier for the same pur
pose. At 12:30 o'clock the crowds began
to pass through" the rotunda and during
the six hours in which the body was lying
in state it is estimated that 55,000 people
viewed the remains.

Eugene E. Schmitz, president of the
Musicians' Union and leader of the
Columbia Theater orchestra, was last
night nominated for Mayor by the Union
Labor party at its convention in Metro
politan Temple. His opponent was James
de Succa, an Ironmolder .and insurance
agent. Schmitz's vote was 144 to 95 for
his opponent.
The early part of the evening was frit
tered away in consideration of credentials
from new unions and motions to adjourn
The following additional delegates and
unions were given recognition:

Union, after a series of resolutions eulo
gistic . of President McKinley had been
adopted and a copy ordered sent to hia
widow, suggested that the convention
should adjourn until next Tuesday night
at S o'clock, "out of respect to the mem
ory of the martyred President." Â¦
A storm of protest arose-, both from the
floor and gallery. An amendment to ad
journ until Friday night was offered as a
substitute. ! This and the original motion
were, finally voted down, and Chairman
Millmore called for nominations for
Mayor. George: F. Aubertine in a well
worded speech placed Schmitz in nomin
ation amid great applause. The nomin
ation was seconded by J. S. Parry and
a half dozen other delegates.
Thomas F. Eagan placed De Succa in
nomination, referring to his consistent
career as a union man. Hi3 nomination
received a number of seconds. Both men
were called', before the convention and
Schmitz's speech seemed to catch the
fancy of the audience, for he was vigor
ously applauded. He was followed by De
Succa, and each candidate was requested
by delegates to give his views upon the
Geary-street Railroad franchise proposi
tion. - : .
The roll call showed that Schmitz was
a strong favorite- all through and from
the first led his opponent. The tellers
announced the result to be v Schmitz 144

Mr. Eagan; moved that the nomination
be made unanimous and his motion was
carried by acclamation.
Mr. de Succa escorted his victorious
rival to the platform and said he hoped

Schmitz said he would, as head of their
ticket, lead them on to victory. Cheers
were given. for Mr. Schmitz and Mr. de

"T/hd In the best kind of a cause. Cut this
6tatement out. for It will not appear
A'.most every one Interested in pure food
and drink is willing to have their name
and letter appear In the papers, for such
help as it may offer to the human race.
However, a request to omit name will be
respected.
Every friend of Postum is urged to
write and each letter will be held In high
esteem by the company as an evidence
of such friendship, while the little bores
of gold and envelopes of money will reach
many modest writers whose plain and
sensible letters contain the facts desired,
although the sender may have but small
faith in winning at the time of writing.
Decision will be made between October
20 and November 10, 1901, by three Judges,
not members of the Postum Cereal Co..
and a neat little box containing a $10 gold
piece Bent to each of the five best writers,
a box containing a $5 gold piece to each
of the 20 next best writers, a $2 green-
back to each of the 100 next best and a $1
greenback to each of the 200 next best
writers, making cash prizes distributed to
225 persons.
Be honest and truthful; don't write po-

make it than to use four heaping tea-
epoonsful to the pint of water, let stand
on stove until real boiling begins, then
note the clock and allovr it to continue
easy boiling full 15 minutes from that
time, stirring down occasionally? (A piece
of butter about the size of a navy bean

over.)

Sudden Death of a Teamster.
James Leroy, a teamster, residing with
his mother at 304 Tehama street, died sud
denly yesterday morning. He was taken
ill on Saturday night with pains in the
stomach, but his mother did not think it
necessary to send for a physician. He
gradually grew worse and collapsed at 4
o'clock in the morning. He was unmar
ried and 21 years old.
Continued From Page Eight.
COMMERCIAL NEWS
The affidavit was the basis for an order
for the arrest of an actor named Thomp
son try Judge Graham and was shown to
the Judge by Collins Saturday morning,
when he asked to have the arresting order
issued. The Judge noticed at the time
it was presented that it bore no file mark
and spoke . to the attorney about it. The
attorney said he was -on his way to the
clerk's office to have that attended to and
upon these representations Judge Graham
issued an order for the arrest of Thomp
son and fixed bail at $500, half the amount
of the Judgment against Thompson, gain
ed by Mrs. Greer, his mother-in-law, some
time ago. ' .
That was the last seen of the affidavit,
though Collins asserts that he took it to
Clerk Grief for filing. Grief is equally
as positive that the paper never passed
through his hands and sc told Judge Gra
ham and Attorney Collins. The latter
then said that one of the newspaper men
had taken the document from the desk,
but when offered a chance to identify the
reporter would not accept it.
~ The disappearance of the paper is likely
to cause a great deal of trouble, as the
actor's lawyer is about to Institute an ac
tion for damages against Mrs. Greer and
her attorney, Collins.
Judge Graham, in speaking of the oc
currence yesterday, said: "I was deceived
by Collins. He did not tell me that he had
tried to get an order from Judge Sloss
and failed. I did not know that Thomp
son, the actor, was the man that was
wanted, and when I read the Btory in the
papers Sunday I went to the Hall of Jus
tice and tried every means In my power
to remedy my. error. I sent for Collins
Monday and when he came he told me
that he had laid the affidavit on Grief's
desk. When I told him that Grief said
he had not.he then said a newspaper man
had taken it. The obtaining of the war
rant in such a manner was an outrage."
The disappearance of an affidavit, said
to have been filed in the County Clerk's
office last Saturday, Is causing a deal of
discussion at the City Hall. The parties
most vitally Interested In the missing:
paper are Judge Graham, Judgment Clerk
Johnny Grief and George D, Collins, the
attorney.

Document Was Piled

The Baltimore syndicate, which was
represented by R. G. .Hanford, G. R.
Webb and J. T. Blackwell, is a corpora
tion that is amply able to carry out any
deal It considers advisable. Some time
ago it purchased the San Mateo electric
line and at that time it also attempted to
acquire the Oakland and Hay wards line
and five other lines in San Jose, intend
ing to form a company which would prac
tically, control all the suburban travel of
San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland.
The deal fell through for the same reason
that the purchase of the Market and Sut
ter street properties was not consummated
âthe price was too high.
It was shortly after the purchase of the
San Mateo line that the first steps to
ward the acquirement of the Market and
feutter street lines were taken. The Bal
timore people paid for an option on tha
Sutter-street road, including the Sutro
line, and offered $75,000 for a sixty-day op
tion on the Market-street system. This
was considered too small a sum by the
Huntlngton and Hellman people and ne
gotiations were allowed to drift along
without any coin being put up and with
out anything definite being accomplished.
Finally the Baltimore people asked that
a figure be quoted to them as the price
at which they could acquire the Market
street lines. The answer was a sum that
they considered altogether too high and
they reluctantly brought the whole mat
ter to a close.
As the purchase of the Sutter street
and the Sutro lines was contingent upon
the Baltimore capitalists being able to
swing the Market-street deal, that is also
off and, for the time at least, no Eastern
capital will be invested in San Francisco
street railways.-
The big deal for the purchase of the
Market-street railway system which has
been blowing hot and cold for. the past
two or three months is off. The Balti
more syndicate which was negotiating the
purchase of the property, and the Sutter
street road as well, has come to the con
clusion,that the price asked is too much
and has discontinued its overtures; Â¦

In the auditorium of the Young Men's
Christian Association. The lecture was
well attended and was an intellectual
treat to the highly appreciative audience
that attended. Mr. Green Is an enthusi
ast In art and much en rapport with his
subject and carried his audience along
from the Grecian art to that of the pres
ent day, enlivening what was at- times
necessarily very technical, with spirited
sallies of keen wit. The lecturer divided
the schools into the two grand divisions
of realism and idealism and illustrated his
remarks with beautiful stereoptlcon views.

EXECUTOR OF AN ESTATE
SUES FOB LARGE AMOUNT
big log raft finally made port
I yesterday. It is nearly a year
I since the construction of it began,
11 and at one time it looked as if It
would be 1902 before it reached
San Francisco. It took eight months to
build and $30,000 was paid out in wages
alone during Its construction. The chains
that bind the logs together weigh seventy
tons and are worth $600"). There are be
tween 7000 and SOOO piles in the raft, rep
resenting at least seven cargoes of 1.000,
000 feet each, and in length it is more
than an average San Francisco block. The
huge mass of lumber is 625 feet long, 60
feet broad and 32 feet deep. It draws 24
feet, and on that account came near re
maining in the Columbia River.
- The builders figured that the raft would
not draw more than twenty feet, and
when an attempt was made to get it
away from Westport last July the tow
boat companies found it was drawing too
much water. Passing out the raft struck
on the bar and for nearly a month navi
gation was stopped. Finally it was 'got
back into the harbor and the bar was
dredged.
On September 6 the raft reached Asto
ria, and just as It was passing out the
news reached the captains of the Tatoosh
and Richard Holyoke that President Mc-
Kinley had been assassinated. All on
board both vessels thought the President
dead, and the flags have been at half mast
ever since they crossed out over the Co
lumbia River bar. It was a drifting
match all the way down the coast. Some
times the tugs would be ahead, but more
often the raft was broadside on and the
tugboats were doing their best to hold
it up to the wind. A gale came up on the
evening of September 7 and it blew hard
from the northwest right up to Sunday
night. The tugs had nothing to do but
hold on and let the raft drift. In conse
quence both the Holyoke and Tatoosh
were well supplied with coal when port
was made Monday night.
During the run down the coast the raft
did not lose half a dozen piles. It was In
perfect order yesterday, and the tugs
Monarch, Sea King and Sea Prince found
no difficulty In getting it to a safe anchor
age in Mission Bay. It will be broken up
at once and the majority of the piles sent
to Oakland.
"As far as the Pacific Coast Is concern
ed, everybody who has it within his in
fluence or power is anxious to give us
what we want. As soon as Fessenden
perfects a few improvements in the orig
inal Marconi apparatus we will get the
first set and experiment at once. In fact,
Fessenden has already made these im
provements for all practical purposes.
"To show you how successful a means
of signaling wireless telegraphy has dem
onstrated itself to be I have records of
signals transmitted from Washington to
a point on the Potomac, at least fifty
miles distant. The Government has ap
propriated money for experimenting, but
in December another appropriation will
certainly be forthcoming for the installa
tion of the wireless telegraphy instru
ments for working purposes. The sound
may get them before we do on account of
the absolute necessity of some such im
proved signal system for those waters."
Besides the establishment of a Marconi
plant McAdie has secured for this city
and near-by coast points the promise of
an appropriation for signal towers at
Point Lobos, Point Reyes and the Faral
lones. This will make it far easier to sig
nal storm warnings by means of flags and
lanterns.
"I visited the stations along the lakes,"
said Mr. McAdie yesterday, "and every
thing is in readiness for the installation
of the Marconi system in that section.
When things are in better shape the Mar
coni apparatus will be put in use. It is
only a matter of a few months. I did not
go to Nantucket, where Professor Regi
nald Fessenden is in charge experiment
ing and operating the Marconi apparatus
I was busy In another direction, but 1
learned all about his work.
While in the East Mr. McAdie attended
the weather forecasters' convention at
Milwaukee and returns full of ideas for
the improvement of the local station.
Professor A, G. McAdie, weather fore
caster and chief of the coast bureau, re
turned yesterday morning after an official
Eastern trip of some weeks' duration.
Mr. McAdie brings good news, and if his
predictions In regard to the establishment
of the Marconi system of wireless teleg
raphy are realized, within three months
San Francisco will enjoy the benefits of
this means of communication between
Point Lobos and the Farallon Islands.
The General Disposition Is to Help
the Pacific Coast to
Secure a Complete
Plant.
Within Three Months Mar
coni System Will Be in
Operation Here.
