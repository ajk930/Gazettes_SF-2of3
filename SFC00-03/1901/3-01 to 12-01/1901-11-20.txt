VOLUME XC-SO. 173.
FENIAN LEADERS INSTIGATE THE PLOT
FOR YUKON'S REVOLT AGAINST CANADA
DETAILS of a conspiracy to overthrow the authority of the Dominion of Canada in the gold fields of Northwestern British Columbia and establish a Yukon republic were published exclusively in Skagway
correspondence to The Call on Sunday, November 17. It was shown that the revolutionary project had its orig-in in Dawson and its headquarters in Skagway; that arms and ammunition had been shipped in, and
that 5000 miners had pledged their support to the movement. Officers of the Northwest Mounted Police, learning the plot, had called upon United States officials in Alaska for the support of the American
Government in checking the conspirators, and United States Marshal Shoup had hastened to Seattle to telegraph the facts to Washington. From Victoria comes news fully confirming the statements contained in The Call's
Skagway correspondence. The Times of that city corroborates the details given and declares that the conspiracy originated in the Fenian centers in New York and Chicago. It says the Skagway leaders in the plot have long
been under the surveillance of the Dominion authorities.

PRESIDENT'S ORDER
FIXES THE STATUS
OF MANY OFFICIALS
Sixteen Hundred of the Civilian Positions
Are Restored to the Classified Gov
ernment Service*
DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE
WHOSE NAMES ARE NOW TO THE FORE FOR THE IMPORTANT
CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 19.â
President Roosevelt to-day issued
an order restoring to the classified
service about 1600 civilian positions
; of the quartermaster, medical, ordnance
and engineering departments of the army.
| It is alleged that these positions were
handed over to spoilsmen a few years
! ago and have been withdrawn from their
control upon the recommendation of Sec
retary Root. Numerous appointments
have been made to these positions since
May 29, 1899, when they were exempted
from the civil service, and as a result of
President Roosevelt's action the ap
pointees will be incorporated in the civil
service without even the formality of un
dergoing examination.
In an official memorandum to the Presi
dent, upon which the latter based his ac
tion, Secretary Root says:
Causes of the Complication.
In Hay, 1896, the civil sen-Ice rules, were
amended, and the rules as thus amended re
malned In force until May 29, IS9S. The amended
rules of 189fi provide for trades and other non
educational examinations In different depart
ments and the Indian service. The working of
these rule* was In the main satisfactory to the
departments concerned.
On May 29, 1899, by an executive order,
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1901.
certain civilian positions in the quartermaster,
medical, ordnance and engineering departments
were taken out from the operation of the exist
ing regulations and it was provided that ap
pointments to these designated positions should
hereafter be made on registration tests of fit
ness prescribed in regulation* to be Issued by
the Secretary of War and approved by the
President. No regulations have been Issued by
the Secretary of War in relation to these posi
tions. The result is that the legal status of all
the appointees to these designated positions is
somewhat In doubt, owing to the fact that,
as no new regulations hare been prescribed,
and as the appointments are not governed by
the provisions of previous regulations, there are
no rules or regulations governing their selec
tion. If regulations were formulated by the
Secretary of War it would result in two sys
tems' running Bide by side in the same depart
ment. Such a dual system of appointment In
the bureaus would be open to serious objection.
It is learned to-night that had Presi
dent McKinley lived he would have issued
such an order as was signed to-day by
President Roosevelt. He ordered the ex
emption of the places upon the recom
mendation of General Alger, but Secre
tary Root convinced him of the desirabil-

to the Philippines,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 19.â The Commercial
Pacific Cable Company, recently organ
ized for the purpose of constructing and
maintaining a cable across the Pacific
Ocean, and of which John W. Mackay is
president, to-day awarded the contract
for the manufacture and laying of the
first section of the great submarine strand I
to the Silvertown Cable Manufacturing
Company of Silvertown, near London.
The cost of making and laying this sec
tion Is estimated at about $3,000,000. The
section will reach from San Francisco to
some central point in the Hawaiian Isl
ands, probably at Honolulu, and it is ex
pected will be completed about the first
of January, 1903.
The Silvertown. Company will commence
the work of construction immediately and
will have the work finished about the
first of next July. The cable will tnen
be loaded on board ship and it will be 1
three months more before It reaches San
Francisco, the starting point of its jour
ney across the Pacific.
The actual work of laying the cable will
consume about seventeen days and with
the additional time for establishing the
stations and allowing for possible mis
haps, it will be ready for service in two
months after its arrival here.
George G. Ward, first vice president of
the Commercial Cable Company, said to
day:
"The company has assured us they will
complete the cable and have it here In
seven months. Just as soon as this sec
tion Is complete and out of the way we
shall commence work on another section
that will connect the Hawaiian Islands
with the Philippines. Our station tnere
will probably be on the island of Luzon,
near Manila. We have not decided on that
point yet, nor have we fixed our schedule
of rates, but we shall reduce them to a
reasonable figure. We expect to have
the work completed In about two or
three years. The estimated cost of the
undertaking is about $15,000,000, but we
have capitalized our company at only
$3,000,000 because we prefer to increase
our^ capitalization as we proceed."
Ward said it was expected that the
new cable would allow the transmission
of messages in nearly four hours less time
than required at the present.

DOMINION GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS ARE WATCHING
SKAGWAY CONSPIRATORS
Victoria Newspaper Says the Plans of the Goldfields
Revolutionists Are Directed From New-
York and Chicago*
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 19. â According to persons who have recently arrived in this city
from the north, says the Times of this city, the story of a conspiracy being hatched
at Skagway for the overthrow of Canadian rule in the Yukon territory has every sub
stance of foundation. The news was given first in the Sunday Call, being sent from Skag
way under date of November 6. According/ to reliable information that to-day reached the Times,
Inspector Corrigan did arrive at Skagway from White Horse on the evening of the sth and held
a consultation with the United States officers in Skagway. It is generally accepted asa fact that
some mischief was brewing; and it is attributed to the machinations of a Fenian center, with its
local headquarters in Skagway, but in direct affiliation with the head centers of New York and
Chicago.
The leaders of this local center are very well known to the authorities, and have been
watched for some time in connection with their workings among the local populace and their
communication with the head centers. The Times says in this regard:
"The exceedingly mean and hostile spirit which prevails in Skagway toward everything
Canadian and British is said to be largely due to the plotting of this local center. Recent instilts
to the British flag, culminating, in the actual tearing it down by the mob on one occasion, as
well as certain well carried out plots to bring Canadian officials into disgrace", are all traceable to
the same gang."
The informant of the Times avers positively that the report is thoroughly reliable, and that
Canada now and always stands in need of great alertness and preparation. The Times continues:
"In the event of any move being made by these Skagway Fenians against Dawson, or
Canadian rule in the north, a force of more than 4000 men could be landed on the scene within a
few days. In such an emergency the vessels of the fleet on this station, which carry more than
1000 men, could be immediately dispatched. These are heavily armed and could carry a plen
tiful supply of artillery with them.
"In addition to the men of the ships, there are 500 men of the royal garrison artil
lery, royal engineers, army ordnance corps and army medical corps stationed at Work Point bar
racks in this city. These could be moved at almost a moment's notice. The Fifth Regiment
C. A. (militia) of this city and the Sixth Battalion (rifles) of Vancouver, each numbering about
300 men, could be dispatched in a few days' time, swelling the expeditionary force, including the
Rocky Mountain Rangers of Nelson, Kamloops, Rossland and Revelstoke, up to nearly 40CO men,
all arrrjed with the latest and most modern rifles and armament.
"The force could be thrown into White Horse in a few days, and the march from that
point, while exacting enough, would present no insurmountable difficulties. In fact it would be
very similar to the rebellion of 1885, the last outbreak under Louis Riel in the Northwest Ter
ritory.
"The Northwest Mounted Police in the territories could also be brought over in a few days
to the coast to assist in the work.''

NEW YORK, Nov. 19.â A telegraph spe

now than she has been at any time since
she was taken sick at the Detroit Opera
house while presenting "Under Two

"The Climbers" company reached Detroit
Sunday night, Worthing sent his baggage
on to the hospital, while he entered a car
riage with a bound and to the jehu called
out sharply "To Grace Hospital."
In a few minutes he was at the bedside
of Miss Bates, where there were affection
ate greetings and the two talked just as
long as Miss Bates' physician would per
mit. Monday morning Worthing was there
again, and again in the afternoon and
twice every day since. Worthing was*
asked to-day the reason for his tender so

.Diplomatic Agent Dickinson Said to
Have Asked for Bulgaria's
Assistance.
SOFIA, Nov. 19.â 1t is reported that
Dickinson, the United States diplomatic
agent here, has informed the Government
of Bulgaria that the abductors of Miss
Ellen M. Stone and Mme. Tsilka, with
their captives, are concealed In a defile
of the Belleritza Mountains, near Smotch,
district of Dubnitza, and has requested
that troops be sent to surround the place
and liberate the captltves. Both Dickin
son and the Bulgarian Foreign Office de
cline to confirm or deny this report.
Nevertheless, it Is believed that Dickin
son, persuaded of the Impossibility of
coming to terms with the brigands and
relying upon his belief that they will not
harm their captives if troops are employ
ed against them, has, after consulting
with Washington, decided upon this move.
Only eight bandits now guard Miss
Stone, and some of these are known to
sympathize with her. About a fortnight
ago Dickinson approached the Foreign
Office and proposed this same* plan, but
its carrying out was abandoned because
of the uncertainty of the location . of the
bandits.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. I".â A. P. Wilcox,
his wife and 2-year-old son were
murdered by an unknown person in their
home, two miles from Downey and twelve
miles cast "of Los Angeles.
The tragedy took place not later iho.ii
Sunday night but news or it did not reach
the Sheriff's office ur.ti! noon to-day. Sher
iff Hammei and Coroner Holland left for
the scene immediately.
Evidently the murderer had met resist
ance on the part of his victims. All rhe
bodies were horribly mutilated. Invefcti
n showed that the criminal had UaC-J
a. revolver and then completed his work
with a knife, with which he had stabbeu
and hacked his victims to pieces.
Scene at the Wilcox Home,
William Twesberry, wiio rented the
place to Wilcox. went over to the house
this morning and found everything closed.
H* looked through the windows and saw
the bodies stretched on the floor. He noti
fied Constable Romer. who in turn tele
phoned to Sheriff Hammei in this city.
'ihe Sheriff arrived at the ranch shortly
ifier noon and proceeded to make an ex
amination of the premises. The doors cf
the four-room cottage which the Wilcoxcs
occupied were closed, but one of the
kitchen windows was open.
family had evidently been surprised
at dinner or breakfast. Mrs. Wilcox had
been shot while carrying a plate from
the stove to the table. The baby lay in
the middle of the room, while the body of
its mother was stretched out near the
door. Wilcox had been beaten upon tlit
head with a revolver, and a greai knife
I had laid open his abdomen. The
Louies had evidently been set on fire, for
the clothing was badly burned.
The child had been shot through the
head and the bullet was found imbedded
at the back of the skull. Mrs. Wilcox
Lad been shot from behind, apparently.
Fierce Attack on Husband.
The husband clearly was the object cf
the fiercest assault. The top of his head
was beaten into a pulp.
None of the Wilcox family have betn
teen s'.nct- last Thursday evening so far
as can be ascertained. The house sets
back off the main road nearly a mile an i
tried from general observation. One
of the neighbors. Mr. Stack, says he he^rd
a. noise like the breaking of" a box on
Sunday morning. He is now convinced
that this noise was the report of a pistol
The weapon used by the murderer was a
38-cal:bre revolver, as is indicated by sev
eral empty shells found on the floor.
la the back room was found a hatchet,
tut nÂ« bloodstains were to be found on it.
The room where ib.e slaughter took place
was in a frightful condition. The table,
with the meal still spread, however, re
mained undisturbed.
The theory of the Downey residents and
of the officers is that the woman and child
were killed by the first and second shots,
the murderer having entered unobserved.
The husband received the third bullet but
not until he had been beaten to insensi
bility.
:>icion at first pointed to Bert Lewis,
former husband of Mrs. Wilcox. Sheriff
Hammei notified all his deputies to look
for Lewis, who. it was alleged, had been
heard to threaten the life of his former
wife. That revenge or some similar mo
tive, and not robbery, induced the crime
16 indicated by the fact that nothing had
been taken from the bodies or from the
house.
Lewis was arrested in Downey this
evening. After a consultation between
the Sheriff and the District Attorney,
however, he was released- The District
Attorney decided that there was not suffi
cient evidence against Lewis to warrant
his detention. The authorities have no
further clew to work on.
The bodies of the three victims were
brought to Los Angeles to-night and
placed in an undertaking establishment.

the moon. We are grieved and distressed
when there are differences among them,
but even then we should never think of
trying to compose any of those differ
ences unless by the request of both par
ties to It. Not even our earnest desire
for peace among them will lead us to any
action which might offend their national
dignity or their just sense of independ
ence. We would endow them with all the
consideration we claim for ourselves.
"As to what we have tried to doâ what
we are still trying to do â in the general
field of diplomacy, there is no reason for
doubt on the one band or reticence on
the other. President McKinley, in his
messages during the last four years, has
made the subject perfectly clear. We
have striven, on the lines laid down by
Washington, to cultivate friendly rela
tions with all powers, but not to take
part in the formation of groups or com
binations among them. A position of
complete independence is not incompati
ble with relations involving not friendship
alon^. but concurrent action as well in
important emergencies. We have kept al
ways in view the fact that we are pre
eminently a peace loving people: that our
natural activities are In the direction of
trade and commerce; that the vast de
velopment of our industries imperatively
demands that we shall not only retain
and confirm our hold on our present mar
kets, but seek constantly, by all honora
ble means, to extend our commercial in
terests in every- practicable direction.
"It is for this reason we have nego
tiated the treaties of reciprocity which
now await action of the Senate;
ail of them conceived in the tra
ditional American spirit of protec
tion to our own industries and yet
mutually advantageous to ourselves and
our neighbors. In the same spirit we
have sought successfully to induce all the
great powers to unite in a recognition of
the general principle of equality or com
mercial access and opportunity in the
markets of the Orient. We believe that
a "fair field and ho favor" is all we
reo.uire; and with less than that we can
not be satisfied. If we accept the assur
ances we have received as honest and
genuine, as I certainly do, that equality
will not be denied us; and the result may
be safely left to American genius and
energ>\
Interests in the Pacific.
"We consider our interests in the Pacific
Ocean as great now as those of any other
power and destined to indefinite develop
ment. We have opened our doors to the
people of Hawaii; we have accepted th"c
responsibility of the Philippines, which
providence Imposes on us; we have put
an end to the embarrassing condition In
which we were involved in Samoa, and
while abandoning none of our commercial
rights In the entire group, we have es
tablished our flag and our authority in
Tutuila, which gives us the finest harbor
in the South Seas. Next In order wfll

canal for the use of all well-disposed peo
ples, but under exclusive American own
ership ana American control â of both of
which great enterprises President Mc-
Kinley and President Roosevelt have been
the energretic and consistent champions.
"Sure as we are of our rights in these
matters, convinced as we are of the au
thenticity of the vision which has led us
thus far and still beckons us forward, I
can yet assure you that so long as the adÂ»
ministration of your affairs remains in
hands as strong and skillful as those to

MINERS MEET
IN A BATTLE
Union Forces Close a
Shaft and Destroy
Property;
Tools Are Burned, Men Injured
and a Town Is in
Terror*
VINCENNES, Ind...Nov. 19.-Three hun
dred union miners from Washington,
Princeton, Petersburg, Linton, Sullivan
; and BickneM'came here during the night
and early to-day marched to the shaft
j of the Prospect Hill Coal Mining Com
! pany, where non-union miners are em
â¢ ployed, and closed the shaft. They de- i
' t-troyed property, assaulted a number of
! miners and are still in the vicinity of the
; mine. The entire city is excited and more
j trouble is feared.
Owing to a recent strike the mine was
! not being operated at night, and only the
! watchman, Buck Azbell, was on dut>\ He
Â¦was beaten and placed under guard,
i while fifty men went to a shack ocou
i pied by half a dozen miners, when a gen
i era! fight resulted, in which Perry Collins,
: an attorney of Washington, who was vis
iting the owner of the sha-ck, and Wil
liam Scott and Joe Devlne, non-union
miners, were badly beaten and left In a
! serious condition^
The union men then returned to the
: mine, stopped the pumps, burned all the
: tcols they could find, and after leaving
instructions that they would return in I
i case the mine was started and the scale
! r.ot paid marched back to town and dis
! banded.
which they have been and are now com
mitted, there will be no more surrender
â¢of our rights than there will be violation
of the rights of others. The President to
whom you have given your invaluable
trust and confidence, like his now immor
tal predecessor, is as incapable of bully
ing a strong power as he is of wringing a
weak one. He feels and knowsâ for has
he not tested it in the currents of heavy
fight, as well as in the toilsome work of
administration?â that the ' nation over
whose destinies he presides has a giant's
strength in the works of war, as in the
works of peace. But that consciousness
of strength brings with it no temptation
to do injury to any power on earth, the
proudest or the humblest. We frankly
confess we seek the friendship of all the
powers; we want to trade with all peoples;
we are conscious of resources that will
make our commerce a source of advan
tage to them and also profit to ourselves.
But no wantonness or strength will ever
induce us to drive a hard bargain with
another nation because it is weak, nor
will any fear of ignoble criticism tempt
us to insult or defy a great power beciuse
it is strong or even because it is friendly.
"The attitude of our diplomacy may be
indicated in a text of Scripture which
Franklinâ the first and greatest of our
diplomatsâ tells us passed through his
mind when he was presented at the court
of Versailles. It was a text his father
used to quote to him in the old candle
shop in Boston when he was a boy:
" 'Seest thou a man diligent in business,
he shall stand before kings."
"Let us be diligent in our business and
we shall standâ stand, you see, not crawl,,
nor swaggerâ stand as a friend and equal,
asking nothing, putting up with nothing
but what is right and just among our
people in the great democracy of na
tions."
Embassador Choate Speaks.
After he concluded Secretary Hay was
obliged several times to acknowledge the
applause accorded him. by the diners.
â¢Governor Odell spoke to the toast,
"The State of New York," and Mayor
elect Low replied to the toast, "The City
of New ifork."
Joseph H. Choate, Embassador to the
Court of St. James, was next introduced.
After the applause had subsided he spoke
with his usual eloquence, dwelling mostly
on the recent visit of the delegates of the
New York Chamber of Commerce to
London. He enlarged on the sympathy
which had been shown by the British
people at the time of the death of Presi
dent McKinley and said that not only had
the sympathy been manifested almost
every hour for days after that event by
royalty, but that all classes were quite aa
sorrowful. In view of these facts Choate
thought this Government justified in
u-.nking that England's .grief was an ex
pression of national sympathy.
Choate was followed by Senator Mc-
Laurin of Soutb Carolina, who spoke to
the toast of "The Monroe Doctrine of the
Twentieth Century." The Senator's ad
dress was very well received and he was
frequently applauded.
Senator McLaurin elucidated the Mc-
Kinley doctrines to be as follows:
First â That as our own manifold productions
largely exceeded home consumption, the ex
pansion of territory, trade and commerce was
the only means of securing markets for our
surplus products.
Secondâ That as a nation with a firmly es
tablished constitutional government and en
larged national obligations we could no longer
abstain from participation In the affairs of the
world, but must take our share of the re
sponsibility.
Third â That while maintaining the doctrine
that no government on the American continent
must be interfered with or controlled by any
European power, yet we must cultivate friend
ly relations with them and be prepared to
seek and control our share of the trade of
the world.
Fourthâ That we should not and could not
as a nation safely shrink full performance of
all the responsibilities caet upon us, but must
move forward to the fulfillment of our na
tional destiny.
The propositions embraced in this doctrine
will be to the twentieth century what the
Monroe doctrine was to the nineteenth. If,
as a nation, we would enjoy the commercial
fruits we need and desire, we must, like in
dividuals, make national ventures and heroic
efforts.
Governor-elect Albert B. Cummins of
lowa followed Senator McLaurin. He
said in part:
Reciprocity, In so far as It modifies or abro
gates duties upon non-competitive products
imported Into the United States, Is so plainly
for the benefit of both the American producer
and the consumers that there can be no con
troversy with respect to the wisdom of giving
the principle free scope in these fields. Let
us hold fast to these fundamental principles.
We must not surrender a home market for a
foreign market of equal extent. We must not
yield a cure market for an uncertain one.
The consumers of this country will not tolerate,
as a permanent trade policy, the selling of
goods abroad at a less price than they are sold
at home, and if they believe that tariff duties
have any influence upon the maintenance of
such conditions, the man or party that stands
for the perpetuation of such duties is destined
for bitter disappointment.

FOR HARMONY
Reciprocity Convention's
Chairman Talks of
Tariffs.
Representatives of Nation's
Industries Begin
Sessions.
WASHINGTON^ Njv. 19.â Many of the
manufacturing industries of the United
States were represented at the National
Reciprocity Convention, which began 'ts
sessions here to-day. There were 200 del
egates present in respanse to a call issued
by the National Association of Manufac
turers at a meeting in Detroit last June.
The convention is representative of all
sections, and its object is to give expres
sion to the views of manufacturers gen
erally on the subject of reciprocity;
B. A. Tompkins of Charlotte, N. C, was
chosen temporary chairman and Theo
dore C. Search of Philadelphia permanent
chairman. The organization was com
pleted by the election of the following:
Vice chairmenâ General W. F; Draper of
Massachusetts, T. *L. Hickman of Geor
gia, Charles C. Harrington of Pennsylva
nia, James Deering oÂ£ Illinois, Titus S.
Heard of New York City and Robert J.
Morgan of Ohioj secretaries, Edward H.
Sanborn of Pennsylvania and E. P. Wil
son of Cincinnati;
The convention adopted resolutions of
greeting to President Roosevelt, pledging
its support and expressing its confidence
in his administration. Search in taking
the chair outlined the work before the
convention. He said in part:
Our aim has been to forestall tariff agitation,
net to encourage It. It is the duty of this con
vention to harmonize as far as possible the
widely differing opinions represented In tms
body, and to reduce to clear and forceful ex
pression such principles as we hold In common.
We are here to harmonize our views, not to em
phasize our differences. This Is no time or
place for sentiment, for theories, or for state
ments that cannot be fully substantiated by
facts. I take it we are all agreed as to certain
general propositions, such as these:
That some of the duties embraced in our pres
ent tariff are no longer needful for the existence
of the industries for whose protection they are
imposed.
That many of our industries have reached a
stage in their development where the home
market alone cannot absorb their entire prod
uct, and consequently new outlets' are neces
sary for their continuous operation and the
steady employment of their operatives.
That the establishment of more cordial com
mercial relations with other nations by means
of an exchange of tariff concessions would en
large the foreign outlets of those industries for
which increased export trade Is necessary.
That if such applications of the principles of
commercial reciprocity could be made without
Injury to any of our industries the consequent
expansion of our foreign trade would be benefi
cial to all our commercial and Industrial inter
ests.
Coffee and tea are about the only great staple
articles of commerce which we do not produce,
and if reciprocity be limited to the use of these
two commodities as a basis for negotiations we
cannot expect to make much progress. To in
sist upon strict adherence to such a principle
In making- application of reciprocity is virtually
to oppose Its use in many practical forms.
The reciprocity that is wanted to-day is a
reciprocity that means something, and promises
something in the shape -of tangible advantages
for our commerce, not merely expressions of
kind sentiment toward all the business world,
but an actual giving and taking of concessions
that will open wider for us the markets of the
world and broaden the distribution of our prod
ucts'.

Officers*
Charges Are Made That There
Has Been Stealing of
Money.
BUFFALO, N. V., Nov. 19.â Mayor Die hi
to-day suspended City Treasurer Philip
Gerst from office. In the notice of sus
pension the Mayor charges Gerst with
misconduct in office and with having kept
Inaccurate and false accounts, and speci
fically charges that from the accounts of
the City Treasurer the amount of cash
on hand to the credit of the city is $50,000
in excess of the actual amount. The ex
amination of the Treasurer's accounts,
which has been in progress for several
days, will be continued.
Specifically, the Mayor charges that
Treasurer Gerst borrowed from banks up
ward of $40,000 with which to cover up the
shortages in his accounts at a time when
an examination was to be maSe; that in
August last he loaned the banks $8000 of
the city's money and that at various times
during the current year he appropriated
to his own use money belonging to the
city, the aggregate of such sums being
$4246. After he had been served with notice
of removal, Gerst said:
The books of my office are undergoing an
examination by an expert accountant and the
result will show that every cent of the city s
money is in the bank or In the office of the
Treasurer at this very moment. Notwithstand
ing the charges of the Mayor, the city of Buf
falo will not lose a single penny through my
administration of the office of City Treasurer.
Mayor Diehl declined to talk on the mat
ter, further than to say, in reply to a
question as to whether Gerst had at
tempted to explain the shortage or offered
to tell what use he had made of the
money he is alleged to have appropriated;
I believe he has accounted for the *50,000, but
so far as I know has made no effort to explain
his use of the small amounts. I believe his
bondsmen have arranged to make good any
shortage there may be.

LINE COMES IN AHEAD OF TIME
Dn the Run From Honolulu She Beats Her Own Record and Makes
a Splendid Showing, Both in Going and Returning.
THE SCHOONER ALEXANDER AND THE STEAMSHIP NATIONAL CITY IN HEAVY WEATHER OFF FORT
BRAGG. THE STEAMER HAD TO CAST HER TOW ADRIFT AND THE WINDJAMMER IS NOW CLASSED
AMONG THE OVERDUE*.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Alameda arrived from Honolulu
yesterday, a day ahead of time.
She made the run to the Islands
in five days and twenty hours,
end came home in a little more than five
cays and eighteen hours. There was no
k: tempt at speeding the steamship, and
Chief Engineer Horg-an is confident that
few months she will be the crack
vessel of the fleet.
The Alameda brought up among her
cargo thirty sacks ot silver dollars, val
ued at Oa.UOO. When the shipper was
asked the reason for the consignment he
said there was too much silver in Hawaii
end he was paying his debts in that coin
In order to get rid of some of it. A num
ber of silver shipments are expected on
the next steamer, and in this way the
merchants hope to get a little gold into
circulation in the islands.

THERE IS NO SUCH CONDITION AS
weakness In a man under fifty years of
ag:*. other than general debility. Premature-.
ness, loss of vitality, etc.. are but symptoms
of some damage to the reproductive system,
caused by a contracted disorder or early dis-
sipation. In looking for the location of this
damage we generally find an enlarged, swollen
and inflamed prostate gland. As this gland Is
the very center of the reproductive system it
ran readily be understood that Inflammation of
It must cause disordered function. These cases
are promptly benefited by proper treatment;
otherwise the patient goes from bad to worse.
The essential point in all of them is the neces-
sity of the cure of the focus of the trouble, in
the prostate. Many men have unsuccessfully
treated for a weakness and become discour-
aged, when If an antiphlogistic plan of treat-
ment had been adopted instead of tonics a
cure would have been the result. In our ex-
perience there is no drug In the pharmacopeia
taken into the stomach, that will even benefit
this class of cases. Our plan of treatment Is
Â«-ntirely a local one and prompt results are ob-
tained, as indicated by increased circulation
end return of natural vigor. Our colored chart,
which we mail on application, is interesting to
cry one wishing to study the anatomy of the
male.
Contracted Biood Disease
Cured by the Injection Treatment.
After ten years' use of this method we have
had no reason to change; on the contrary, our
belief increases daily from reports of patients
treated who have married and suffered no re-
lapse. It offers the following advantages, viz.:
Â£a%-es time for the physician and patient, as
Â¦well as labor, office visits being rendered in-
frequent. Besides, little change is necessary
in diet or habits of life, the disease Is readily
concealed and permanent cure Is effected in a
short time, the stomach Is not drugged and the
precise dosage Is obtainable. The expense also
Is greatly reduced

THE ALEXANDER MISSING.
Not Heard From Since Cast Adrift
Off Fort Bragg.
Shipping men and her owner are won
dering what has become of the schooner
AlexiiJider. She left here on November
12 in tow of the steam schooner National
City for Fort Bragg. Up the coast a
very heavy gaie was encountered and the
gteamer had to cast off her tow. This
was on November 14, and the people on
the schooner at once set sail and she
stood out to sea. There was only the
captain and two hands aboard, as the
crew was to be made up at Fort Bragg,
and neither was there an overabundance
of supplies. Since being cast on* by the
steamship nothine has been heard of the
vessel, and if she is still afloat the crew
must be on very short rations.
Alter losing her tow the National City
mace Fort Bragg, and after discharging
loaded for this port and came to San
Francisco, arriving yesterday morning.
The captain s-ays that he lost the Alex
ander curing a heavy gale and had no
means of putting a fresh hawser aboard.
As soon as his vessel is discharged he
will go out to look for the missing vessel.
The Alexander was built in 1877 and
flies the British ring. She was at one
time a steamship, but outlived her use
fulness in that line and was turned into
a "wind Jammer."
La Gironde May Be Saved.
The steamship Ruth arrived from the
south yesterday and brings the news that
the schooner La Gironde may be salved.
Lumber and wrecking machinery was
taken down, and when the Ruth left St.
Nicholas Island the prospects for getting
the schooner off seemed good.
The La Gironde was owned by the E.
K. Wood Lumber Company and was on
her way from San Pedro for San Fran
cisco. In a dense fog she went on to St.
Nicholas Island and the crew deserted
her. "While they were away some men
from San Diego took possession and held
the vessel in spite of a wrecking crew
sent. or. the Samoa to get her off. Then
the La Gironde was sold on the floor of
the Merchants' Exchange to H. P. Squier
for a song and he sent out men on the
Ruth to float her. The people in posses
sion, after consulting an attorney, gave
up everything they had stripped the ves
sel of and also possession. Now the cap
tain of the Ruth reports that with the

Insomnia
Nerve-racked, weary and
heavy-eyed, the head that
seeks repose finds only
ceasless tossing and fever-
ish unrest. Strange fancies
â vague forbodings â fill
the mind with harrowing
thoughts until morning
brings its rasping headache,
irritable temper, and loss of
appetite. Rest the nerves â
build them up â and
gentle, restful, refreshing
sleep will be yours.
"My greatest trouble was sleepless-
ness. I was nervous and restless, and
would toss and roll for hours. Had
no ambition and had to abandon
business. One bottle of Dr. Miles'
Nervine put me on mr feet again."

floated.
Heavy Weather on the Coast.
The steamship John S. Kimball, which
arrived from the Sound Monday night,
had a rough passage. She was caught in
the Columbia River gale and was hove
to for nineteen hours, during which time
the se-as swept her from stem to stern.
Captain Thwing says it was one of the
heaviest blows he ever encountered.
At Grays Harbor the schooners Alcalde
and A. J. West dragged their anchors
and came together. Neither was badly
damaged by the accident, but the West
lost an anchor and forty-five fathoms of
chair, while the Alcalde lost an anchor
and thirty fathoms of chain.
Twelve vessels were bar bound at
Giays Harbor while the storm raged out
side, but yesterday four of them managed
to get cut and make a start for San
Francisco.
Water Front Notes.
Two red pciled bulls for the Hawaiian
Islands are now awaiting shipment in
Morehead's stables on the front. They
came from Ohio on the overland and are

LEGAL TANGLE
AIDS OFFENDERS
Supreme Court of Ha
waii Reaffirms Its
Decision.
Question of the Constitution's
Operation Causes
Trouble.
HONOLULU, Nov. 14.â The Hawaiian
Supreme Court has reaffirmed its deci
sion, Galbraith dissenting, that after the
transfer of the sovereignty of these isl
ands to the United States persons could
be lawfully convicted of crime without
the intervention of a Grand Jury, or oy
a verdict of nine jurors. The question
turns on whether the United States con
stitution* applied in Hawaii after the pas
sage of the Newlands resolution.
Since the last Supreme Court decision
on the question. United States Judge Es
tee has rendered a decision the other way,
declaring convictions by majority verdicts
to be void; also convictions without Grand
Jury indictments. Tne Circuit courts con
tinue to hold the same way as Estee, re
fusing to follow the Supreme Court de
cision. As a result retrials are being had
of prisoners held to have been illegally
convicted, while it is admitted that the
Supreme Court will knock out decisions.
Estee and the Circuit courts refuse to
sustain the old trials, so that between
the two the prisoners appear to have a
good chance of escape.
There is much agitation going on for
an extra session of the Legislature. Most
of the Government departments are se
riously handicapped by lack of funds, and
those who want an extra session say that
the lawmakers should be given an op
portunity to pass some revenue producing
measures. Governor Dole is reported to
be firmly against such a session and the
opponents of the idea say that he will not
call a session.
The Circuit Court bailiff act, under
which all the Circuit courts of the isl
ands have been proceeding ever since the
Legislature adjourned last spring, has
been attacked in Judge Humphreys' court
by Attorney A. G. M. Robertson in be
half of a defendant indicted for perjury.
The act authorizes bailiffs of the Circuit
Courts to summon grand and trial jurors.
If it should be declared invalid the en
tire criminal proceedings throughout the
Territory for eight months past will fall
with it, and scores of prisoners will be
set free or will have to be indicted and
tried asrain. The act is attacked on the
ground that it did' not pass each house
of the Legislature three times, as re
quired by law, and also on other technical
grounds.
COLONEL OF MARINES
BEFORE COURT-MARTTAL
Witnesses Tell of Alleged In'.oxica
tion of an Officer at Brooklyn

company with William A. Boring, had
come in contact with Colonel Meade. who,

drunkenness, and that he was incapable
of performing his duties as an officer.

ed in a very erratic manner, and while
talking on business appertaining to pro
posed improvements Colonel Meade had
acted in a very strangp way. which the
witness described as having been caused
by intoxication.

Thousands of Women Have Kidney
Trouble and Never Suspect It
To Prove What the Great Kidney Remedy SWAMP-ROOT Will Do for YOU,
Every Reader of THE CALL May Have a Sample Bottle FREE.
TO READERS OF THE CALL:
"About 18 months ago I had a very severe spell of sickness. I was extremely sick
for three weeks, and when I finally was able to leave my bed I was left with excruciating
pains in my back. -My .water at times looked very like coffee. I could pass but little at
a time, and then only after suffering great pain. My physical condition was such that I
had no strength and was all run down. The doctors said my kidneys were not affected,
and while I . â¢. ; . "> -
. Did Not Know I Had Kidney Trouble,
â¢I ' somehow felt certain that my kidneys were the cause of my trouble. My sister, Mr*.
C. E. Littlefleld of Lynn, advised me to give Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial. I pro-
cured a bottle Â¦ and inside of three days commenced to get relief. I followed up that bottle
with another, and at the completion of this one found I was completely cured. My strength
.returned and to-day . I am as well as ever. My business is that of canvasser. I am on my
feet a great deal of the time, and have to use much energy in getting around. My cure
is therefore all the more remarkable, and Is exceedingly gratifying to me."

Swamp-Root So Pleasant to Take.
"You have no idea how well I feel. I am
satisfied that I do not need any more medicine,
as I am In as good health as I ever was in
my life." So says Mrs. Mary Engelhard of
2835 Madleon street, St. Louis, Mo., to a re-
porter of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
"For more than ten years I suffered with
what the doctors termed female trouble; also
heart trouble, with swelling of the feet and
limbs. Last summer I felt so badly that I
thought I had not long to live. I consulted
doctor after doctor and took their medicines,
but felt no better. A friend recommended me
to try Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, and I must
say I derived immense benefit almost from the
first week. I continued the medicine, taking
it regularly, and I am now in splendid health.
The pains and sches have all gone. I hava
recommended Swamp-Root to all my friends,
and told them what it has done for me. I
will gladly ansv.-er any one who desires to write
me regarding my case. I most heartily indorse
Swamp-Root from every standpoint. There is
such a pleasant taste to Swamp-Root, and it
goes right to the weak .spots and drives them
out of the system."
Sample Bottle of Swamp-Root Sent Free,
If you have the slightest symptoms of kidney, liver or bladder trouble, or if
there Is a" trace of it in your family history, send at once to Dr. Kilmer & Co..

November 19. 1901.
The Time Ball on the tower of the Ferry
We show here one of the most unique and useful articles on earth.
It is a Hat Rack made from a Mississippi Rifle and makes a most
durable ornament for hall or bedroom. Its four hooks will hold a great
deal, and, besides, it is something that is not seen often. A relic of Civil
War times; only, instead of keeping the gun ready for use in a rack on
the wall, you keep it for use as a rack. It's a limited and tempting offc
at $3.00 and makes a fine Christmas present.
THIS *18 XAYNART> CARBINE which we Â«>oke of In our last ad. Is
the blggejt bargain we have. The lightest and best cartrldgs gun used by the sol-
diers In the Civil War. It 1* still a very useful thing to own. For Hunting Sport-
ing, Target Shooting or Defense it Is unsurpassed by the most modern rifle \Ve
give 20 cartridges FREE with this gun, and we're celling hundred* daily for

DR. XrLMEH'S SWAMP-BOOT.
Made a New Woman of Me.
"During three years I was frequently at-
tacked with severe spells of sickness; many of
these sick spells kept me in bed, dangerously
ill, from three weeks to three months, under
the constant care of the best physicians of
Kansas rity. The doctors never told me I
had anything the matter of my kidneys, but
I did not know for sure.
"Some doctors pronounced my case gall
stones, and said I could not live without a sur-
gical operation, to which I would never con-
sent. A friend suggested I try Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root. I began to take Swamp-Roct
regularly, and when I had used only three sC-
cent bottles I felt fine and was able to do more
work than I had done in four years. It has
made a new woman of me. I have had only
one slight attack since I began to take Swamp-
Root, and that was caused by being drenched
with rain and catching cold. Stomach trouble
had bothered me for years and had become
chronic. I am now 44 years of age and feel
much younger than I did ten years ago. I
frec-ly give this testimonial for the benefit of
those who have suffered as I have."

Women as Well as Men Are Made
Miserable by Kidney aod
Bladder Troubles.
It used to be considered that only uri-
nary and bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all disease*
have their beginning In the disorder of
these most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood-
that is their work. So when your kidneys
are weak or out of order you can under-
stand how quickly your entire body is af-
fected, and how every organ seems to fail
to do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly." begin
taking the famous new discovery. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as
your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will
convince any one.
Many women suffer untold misery became
the nature of their disease >> not correctly
understood; in most cass they are Ud to
bi/ieve that womb trouble cr female weakness
of some sort is responsible for their many
ills, when in fact disordered kidneys are the
chief cause of their distressing troubles.
Neuralgia, nervousness, headache, puffy
or dark circles under the eyes, rheuma-
tism, a dragging pain or dull ache in the
back, weakness or bearing down sensa-
tion, profuse or scanty supply of urine,
with strong odor, frequent desire to pass
it night or day, with scalding or burning
sensationâ these are all unmistakable
signs of kidney and bladder trouble.
If there is any doubt in your mind as
to your condition, take from your urine
on rising about four ounces, place it in
a Rlass or bottle and let it stand twenty-
four hours. If on examination it is milky
or cloudy, if there Is a brick dust settling,
or if tmall particles float about in it, your
kidneys are in need of immediate atten-
tion.
Other symptoms showing that you need
Swamp-Root are sleeplessness, dizziness,
irregular heart, breathlessness, sallow,
unhealthy complexion, plenty of ambi-
tion, but no strength.
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to take and Is
used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by physicians in their private
practice, and is taken by doctors them-
selves, because they recognize in it the
greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-
dollar bottles at the drug stores every-
where.

TACOMA BANK
FAILS TO OPEN
Scared Depositors Begin
a "Run" on the Met
ropolitan.
George Vanderbilt Loses in
Financial Operations
on the Sound,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 19â The Metropolitan
Bank failed to open for business this
morning. The bank experienced a heavy
"run" yesterday, caused by a suit brought
for the appointment of a receiver for the
Metropolitan Savings Bank, which went
into liquidation in May, 1898. Small stock
holders confused the names of the two
banks and believed that legal trouble
threatened the Metropolitan. Some began
:.g their funds on Saturday and
Â¦ rday the "run" became general. Be
d $90,000 and $90,000 was paid out dur
ing the day to small depositors. Business
firms did not become aiarmed because
they were assured by President Caesar
that the bank had sufficient convertible
ta to provide funds for any ordinary
c xigency.
The clearing-house banks yesterday
provided the Metropolitan with $50,000 In
pold, taking in return its best securities.
The clearing-house met last night and de
cided not to supply further funds unless
the bank itself could obtain a certain
sum by this mornings
President Caesar is a nephew of William
K. and George Vanderbilt and has other
influential Eastern connections. He ap
parently expected last night to obtain
money from this source, but failed. The
bank accordingly did not open and on ap
plication of Caesar Dwight Phelps, a
money-lender, was appointed receiver by
Judge Chapman.
Cause of the Failure.
No statement of the bank's condition
lias been made. Its capital stock Is $50,000
and the deposits nearly $500,000. Part of
its assets comprise notes and real estate
âsecurity which other banks did not be
lieve could be realized upon quickly. Es
timates of the amount it will pay out
through the receivership vary from" 30 to
ter cent.
The failure of the bank is directly uue
to the liquidation of the old Metropolitan
Savings Bank by George Vanderbilt dur
):ig the summer of IS9S. He became inter
ested in this bank through a loan on the
banks building and eventually acquired
a controlling interest. Vanderbilt finally
decided to close the bank and sent Charles
McNamee of North Carolina, his confi
dential business agent here, to carry out
the liquidation plan. Vanderbilt advanced
money to pay every depositor in full. Only
four claims remained unsettled, the chief
befnc a note for $18,000 pledged as se
curity to the New Ycrk National Ex
change Bank. This bank at first declined
t<- accept settlement offered by McXamoe.
but in November of last year accepted
such settlement in the sum of $5000. ac
cording to allegations of the officers of
the defunct Metropolitan Savings Bank.
The bank was dissatisfied with this and
-iday last began suit in the Superior
Court for collection of the full amount
on a judgment obtained last August. In
ibis suit it is alleged that the debts of
Metropolitan Saving:? Bank were $30^.-
Ni in txwss of its assets and requested !
- appointment of a receiver.
Vanderbilt Loses Heavily.
Philip Caesar and T. W. Enos were
president and vice president of the Metro
politan Savings Bank. On the day the
announcement was made that the bank
would go into liquidation tiiey opened thÂ«
Metropolitan Bank, themselves being the
chief stockholders. It is understood that j
George Vanderbilt paid them $50,000 for
permitting him to liquidate the old bank, j
Y/iih this money they started the new j
bank. It cost George Vanderbilt $206,000
to liquidate the Metropolitan Savings |
Bark and close out the other Tacoma
property. Through the bank he obtained
he Tacoma Theater, which
had been mortgaged to an Eastern insur
ance company for a large sum. He gave
the insurance company a quit claim deed
to his interest, and by this transaction
lost $60. Â¦
Both Vanderbilt and McXamee were
cis-gusted with their banking experience
here. The property on which Vanderbilt's j
.<- occurred was acquired on loans j
made before Caesar became president. {
His predecessor in that office was Linus i
E. Post, who suddenly disappeared in 1&&5.

â¢ r been heard from since.
James L* Baron Johnson, who created a !

Francisco, was cashier of the Metropoli- :

LAVISH ENTERTAINMENT OF RAILROAD MEN
DURING THEIR BRIEF SOJOURN IN THE CITY
Large Party Visits Summit of Mount Tamalpais, Where Several Pleasant Hours Are
Spent, While Others of the Visitors Enioy a Ride on the Bay.
MANY of the members of the
Traveling Passenger Agents"
Association who are guests of
San Francisco were up bright
and early yesterday morning to
avail themselves of the opportunity to
visit the summit of Mount Tamalpais.
Sidney B. Cushing and Charles F. Run
yon were at the ferry landing to greet
the visitors and extend to them a hearty
welcome.
The trip on the ferry-boat Sa\isalito
was greatly enjoyed by the railroad men.
and the many points of interest on the
bay were pointed out to them by the lo
cal delegates.
On arriving at Mill Valley the guests
found cars awaiting them and they were
soon or. the way to the summit of the
mountain. Unfortunately a heavy fog
hung over the mountain and the scenery
was marred by It. General Warfield was
on the platform of the tavern to meet
the party, having left the city the nfght
before to make arrangements for the
entertainment of the visitors. After a
substantial luncheon President Clair of
the association formally thanked the
MEXIC-CHINESE
STEAMSHIP LINE
M. F. Tarpey Interested
in New Trans-Pacific
Project.
There is a project on foot to establish a
i line of steamships between China and
Mexico. A company has been organized
with that object in view. M. F. Tarpey.
representing the Hearst estate in Mexico.
; and John P. Bennett, a local attorney who
; ha 6 frequently appeared as counsel for
Ho Vow, the Chinese diplomat, are the
organizers* and prime movers of the new
enterprise. An act is now before the
Mexican Congress providing concessions
necessary for the inauguration of the new
line. In the southern republic there is no
pronounced sentiment against an ingress
of Chinese, and the Congress will in all
probability sanction the concessions.
The act provides for the establishment
of two steamship lines, one to communi
cate directly with China and the Orient,
and the other to confine itself to trading
on the Pacific Coast and in the Gulf of
Lower California- The company Is to
have the right of fishing in the Gulf of
Lower California and to import free of
all duties rice, tea, nut oil, smoked and
dried meats and salt eggs, provided that
these provisions' be employed for the ex
clusive use of Chinese in the service of
the steamship company. The company
guarantees the Mexican Government that
it will have the lines in operation two
years hence. The concessions are to hold
good for fifteen years.
May Be for Benefit of Mongolian?.
From what traffic the new company
hopes to derive support for its steamships
is not stated In the act conferring the
concessions. Nor has the company seen
fit to otherwise make known what great
profit exists in Mexican trade to warrant
the establishment of direct communica
tion between that country and China.
The facility of communication that ex
ists between Mexico and this country has
; given rise to the supposition that the
; steamship line Is to be established in order
| to enable Chinese desiring entrance into I
I the Vnited States to evade the exclusion
| act. If this Is the purpose of the new
. company, its plans are certainly lngeni- I
ously arranged, as after Chinese have
once secured admission into Mexico it
will be impossible to exclude them from
the United States.

whose area is equal almost to that of

for their unbounded hospitality. Mrs.
Turner, Colonel Hitchcock and General
Warfield made short addresses. The
party returned to tne city on tile even
ing train.
Those of the visitors who did not go to
Tamalpais were given a ride around the
bay on the steamship San Pablo as guests
ing a population of 200,000.000, certainly
have no fear of being inundated by cheap
Asiatic labor. Especially they do not fear
this as the peons, the people who do the
servile work in Mexico, labor as cheaply
and live as economically as the Chinese.
When the Chinese once land on Mexican
soil it will require a small army of patrol
men on the border to keep them out of
this country. The new company Is prlvi
liged to disembark its passengers any
where on the Mexican coast, which is
more than 1000 miles in extent.
Local Chinese Merchants Involved.
The very fact that the concessions pro
vide that the fishing stations of the new
company shall be in the Gulf of Califor
nia gives strength to the supposition that
the whole project is but a clever scheme
by which Chinese may be smuggled into
the United States. It is rumored that
the Chinese merchants of this city have
subscribed $30,000 toward the securing of
the requisite concessions from the Mexi
can Government.
Another very peculiar, not to say suspi
cious feature about the enterprise, is the
provision granting the company two years
in which to establish the new lines. It
will be remembered that the Chinese
diplomats who are fighting against the re
enactment of the exclusion act are de
manding that the act be suspended for at
least two years. If at the end of that
time, they say. the people 'of the United
States desire to revive the exclusion act,
the Chinese will not object. It would al
most seem that the Chinese hope that if
the exclusion act is allowed to lapse now
and be re-enacted two years hence they
will then have the means of evading it In
the new steamship line.
Chinese landed at the Isthmus of Pana
ma could make their way easily across
the Gulf of Mexico and gain arim'ission to

Asking for Lynch's Removal.
The San Bernardino papers quote the
unwritten law which provides that United
States Senators shall recommend all ap
pointments where the beneficiaries have
jurisdiction in more lhan a single Con
gressional district. The deduction is
reached that the recommendation of Sen
ators Bard and Perkins for the appoint
ment of Stephen Kelley to succeed John
C. Lynch will be sufficient to accomplis'i
the change. In case Perkins recommends
Kelley the Senator will not feel con
strained to request another Senator to in
form the President that the appointment
ought not to be made. Senator Perkins
defended his action in going back on hU
own recommendation on the ground that
Lynch was forced upon him by prominent
members of the Republican party. It hap
pens this time that the prominent mem
bers of the party are asking for Lynch*
removal. Lynch is counting on Senator
Hanna's prestige and Mose Gunsfs al
leged pull with the President to prevent a
change In the Collectorship of Internal
Revenue. The claim is to be advanced
that affairs of the office have been we!l
conducted since Lynch's appointment. As
Lynch has been giving most of his time
to the railroad and politics, the credit for
office management, if any be due, must
be given to some one else. If Lynch is so
fond of politics and railroading, the Sena
tors may conclude to adjust matters so
that he can give all of his time to help
Herrin. The truth is Merrin needs politi
cal help. A great deal of careful and
skillful work must be done in order t f >
make the boss machine serviceable in the
State campaign. The trainmen who are
next to Herrin hint that Burns is the
hoodoo that caused the recent wreck.

Invade a Stronghold of Police
men and Take the Con
tents of the Safe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 19.â The City Mar
shal and Tax Collector's office was rob
bed here this morning between the hours
of 3 and 6 o'clock. The amount taken was
about $1000. but the exact figures have not
yet been ascertained. It was city tax
meney which had been paid to Marshal
Charles H. Holmes.
The robbers must have entered the Mar
shal's office, which is in the City Hall,
through the front door, it being wide
open when the burglary was discovered
at 6 o'clock- They could not have vis
ited the place before 5 o'clock, for at that
hour all the policemen doing night duty
reported off, and everything about the of
fice was then in perfect order. An hour
later Mrs. Jane Samuels, janitress of the
City Hall, arrived. She not only fouml
the outer office door open, but the safe
â¢was standing unlocked. She reported her
discovery to Police Officer Mclntosh. who
lost no time In informing Marshal Holmes.
The most peculiar circumstance in con
nection with the theft is in the way in
which the safe was opened. The com
bination was used. The inner door re
quires a key, but the burglars were pre
pared for this, as they had a key to tit it.
The cash taken was in a canvas bag and
a number of checks payabje to Mr.
Holmes as Tax Collector, which were in
a box, went to keep company with tho
tax money. The safe is an old one anil
clicks when the correct combination is
reached, and this may account for it hav
ing been opened so easily. A key to some
other safe might have opened the innar
lock.
A cripple confined in a cell of the City
Prison, which is at the rear of the Mar
shal's office, said that he heard voices
and hammering about the time the rob
bery is supposed to have occurred.
Marshal Holmes said that as yester
day was the last day before city taxes
became delinquent the collections ha I
been very heavy. He had taken nearly
$4000 to the bank just before it closed.
The money taken by the robbers was
what had been paid in after that hour.
He said that he had the only key to tho
inner safe door and that when he left
his office at 10 o'clock last night every
thing was all right. As policemen were
constantly dropping in at the office dur
ing the night, he believed the money per
fectly safe.
Marshal Holmes feels this misfortune
keenly and declares that if it be within
his power he will personally replace every
cent found missing.
ABGTTMENTS ARE BEGUN
IN THE WINANS CASE
Famous Legal Controversy Over a
Crown Legacy Duty Near Its
Settlement.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â Arguments in the
appeal of Walter and J. L. Winans
against the judgment of Justices
nedy and Phillimore in November,
in awarding the crown legacy a duty on
the large estate left by their father. W.
L. Winans, was heard to-day. The sole
question at issue ia whether the deceased
was domiciled in England. Judgment will
be rendered tu-morruw.
In November last the Lord Chief Jus
tice's Court in London was oÂ«-cupi
determining whether the late William t..
Winans. formerly of Baltimore, it.!
a domiciled resident of Great Britain
when he died in 1Â«97. This question was
tested through a legacy of Â£3)00 willed to
Winans' sister-in-law, Ellen Delaru
which the crown claimed legacy duty.
The court gave judgment for the crown
and the Attorney General remarked that
the decision would affect the whole of
Winans' millions.
William Lewis Winans died in London
on June 25. 1597. in his seventy-fifth year.
He was bom in Baltimore, Md., in 188.
and when 20 years of age was sent to
Russia to arrange the contracts for fur
nishing and equipping the railroad be
tween Moscow and St. Petersburg. The
road was successfully completed and a
large fortune was secured to the Winana
family.
Chinese Bandits Slain.
PEKING. Nov. 19.â Fifty Chinese sol
diers surprised IJÂ»> bandits close to Peking 1
last night, killing twelve of them an<l
capturing sixteen. The prisoners have
been brought here for decapitation.

Green Morris' crack Watercure and Dr.
RowelTs clever plater John McGurk were
the only two winning tavoritee.
On all past records Watercure never
won any medais for traveling in muddy
going, but he can evidently run over a
slow track. He was asked to meet Favo

teenth, and at post time even money
could be had about him. O'Connor, whj
had the mount on Watercure. waited on
Favonius for about half the distance arri

out much difficulty the favorite won eas

lengths. Bullman's chances on Goldone
were ruined by having: his saddle slip for

GARDNER IS MATCHED
TO FIGHT KID CARTER
Hival - Middle-Weight Boxers Will
Meet for the Second Time Late
in December.
George Gardner and "Kid" Carter are
to meet again in the ring. They were
matched yesterday by the San Francisco
Athletic Club to fight twenty rounds on
December 20 at Mechanics' Pavilion..
Gardner defeated Carter some months
since. Walcott then defeated Gardner
and Carter defeated Walcott. It was
claimed Carter was not in form at their
first meeting. Phil Wand has already
been suggested for referee.
Billy Madden, Gus Ruhlin and Denver
Ed Martin left for the East last night.
They will stop over at Salt Lake and
Denver and will then go to Kansas City,
where Ruhlin will meet Tommy Ryan. It
is hardly intended for more than an ex
hibition bout, as Ruhlin outweighs Ryan
by nearly forty pounds. Each man may
attempt to put the other out.
The matching of Gardner and Carter
for next month effectually bars the way
of the proposed match between Jeffries
and Sharkey. In view of public sentiment
st the present time it was not deemed ad
visable to arrange what might prove a
fiasco.
No Fake Fights These.
OAKLAND. Nov. 19.â Three knockouts
pave the spectators at the West Oakland
Athletic Club's boxinj: tournament to
night their fill of sport. In the first go
r>ne Young settled Kid Booth in t^e
round with a stomach punch. The
r>out was fast from the start. George
Baker put Jimmy Little out in the third
"-urd during the second contest. The
<\ principal event ended in the third
when Toby Irwin gave a finishing
to Ed Martin. The fights attracted
rowd of ring followers.

QUTTS FOOTBAXX FIELD
Is to Be Married on Saturday ami
Then Leaves for Manitoba to
Accept a Position.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 19.â
Charles Burton Raitt, '03, star quarter
back for tHree years on the cardinal
eleven, has left college to accept a posi
tion with the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company at Winnipeg, Manitoba.
To fill this position, however, was not
the only reason the dashing quarterback
had for leaving Stanford. On Saturday
of this week his wedding to Miss Nettie
Mee. a former schoolmate, will occur at
the home of the bride's parents, San Ber
nardino. Miss Mcc graduated from the
San Bernardino High School with the
class of '98, one year previous to Raitt's
graduation. The bride-to-be has been a
student in the Los Angeles Normal School
for nearly three years and would have
graduated from that institution early next
spring. She, however, gave up her stu
dies about a month agoâ at a time that
corresponds with the date when "Stubb"
Raitt announced his intention of quit
ting the university, from which intention
he was persuaded by the united efforts
of the football coaches and his many col
lege friends. Miss Mcc is one of the most
popular and beautiful young ladies in San
Bernardino.

"SPORT VASCO" PIrAYKRS
ARRIVE FROM MEXICO
Eighteen Men Come to Introduce the
Game, Which Attracts Large
Crowds of Spectators.
The famous sport vasco, which resem
bles handball, is to be played in this city
for the first time in public on Thanks
giving day at Central Park. A court
with a picturesque entrance has been con
structed at a cost of $35,000. Eighteen
players arrived here from Mexico yes
terday to take part in the opening games
R. Prido is manager, Fermin Alonzo as
sistant manager and Fermin Yribarren
captain. The players are: Leceta, Zubi
caray, Zalacain, Tucuman, Urcelay, Ca
reaga, Zabala, Lasa, Guerrita, Amiano,
Madrileno. Vergara, Ondarres, Veraste
gul, Estudiante. Aristi and Aldabazal.
The game originated in the Pyrenees
and has reached a high state of devel
opment in the City of Mexico. The play
ers use a light wicker attachment on their
hands, which drives the ball with great
speed. The court is 208 feet long and 35
feet wide. The front wall is 45 feet high
and 4 feet thick. It is faced with Colusa
freestone, as brick would not withstand
the battering it would receive, although
the balls used are made of pure rubber
gum.
American Trainers Will Return.
IvONDON, Nov. 19.â The American
Transport liner Minneapolis, leaving Lon
don for New York next Thursday, will
have among her passengers Wishard and
Huggins, trainers for W. C. Whitney. It
is doubtful if either will return here, al
though in each case a return to Great
Britain is contingent upon arrangements
that may be made in the United States.
The Minneapolis will also carry John
Mackey, who has bought a large number
of horses in Great Britain for J. B. Hag
gin's California and Kentucky stud farms.

GREAT DEMAND
FOR "LONGEARS"
Unprecedented Boom in
California Mule
Market. *
Mules are at a premium. If you haye
a drove of these lons-eared beasts hold
on to them until the price soars to the
highest point. The English army, the
I'nited States army, planters and foreign
residents are scouring the Pacific Coast
in search of them. Agents in great num
ber are moving from place to place in
search of mules, and every farmer and
ranchman is regretting that he did not
raise them instead of produce or horses.
They are in great demand, and the prices
paid for the beasts oi burden are con
sidered fancy.
The English nation is sending thou
sands of mules to Afzica to carry neces
saries for the army in the field. This
country has troubles of its own in the
Philippines, and every-.transport carries a
number of the- long-eared brutes. South
ern planters arc buying: these animals to
work in their cotton fields, and represent
atives from the islands in the Pacific are
here for the sp.me puipose.

mule market. There is no corner on
mules, and the agent:-, representing- vari
ous interests are thankful for that. If
there is a rumor that some one in some
of the country districts has some mules
on hand tv/o or three agents fly to him
with princel/ offers. Agents are patrol
ling the entire Pacific flope in quest of the
animals. They find 15. at they are as
scarce as deer in season. An agent from
Memphis thought he would steal a march
on his rivals by going from town to town
on his wheel. The farmers did not take
kindly to him, a? they thought it was not
in good taste for a man to po mule-buy
ing on a bicycle. They thought it was
even worse than the 400 going to the horse
show in an automobile.
Frank Rooker, a local agent, secured
2000 mules for the British Government. On
Saturday last he shipped 1000 to Kansas
City via the Santa Fe Railroad. The oth
er 1000 will be shippod within a week.
Kansas City contractors are handling the
big drove for English contractors. The
Santa Fe has shipped the animals on pas
senger train time.
The buyers for the English Government
are desirous of securing small mules. Old
ones are preferred. So eager are they to
get the small animals that they are will
ing to swap fre larpo ones. As the army
wishes small ones and the plantations
large mules tho exchange is quickly made.
A plantpr fro'n the Fiji group of islands
broupht his own ship over to take the
animals home. He was here last year and
made a largo purchase. This year he has

HENEY'S WEAPON
IS VITUPERATION
Turns It Against Oppos
ing Lawyers in the
Nome Cases.
The lawyers who argued In the Nome
contempt cases riddled Attorney W. T.
Hume with elocutionary shots yesterday
morning and afternoon. Joseph K. Wood
began it in the argument in' his own be
half and Francis J. Heney ended the at
tack by shouting at the top of his voice
that there was "no word long or broad
enough in the English language nt to
characterize the infamy of this creature.'"
But Hume was not the only subject of
the denunciation by Attorney Heney. The
last named said many unpleasant things
about the defendants in the mining cases,
climaxing a burst of invective with many
vituperative adjectives-, all of which he
directed toward the men who have come
in direct conflict with Judge Noyes.
Judge Maguire finished^ his argument
for Thomas J. Geary during the flr3t
hours of the morning session. He was
followed by Joseph K. Wood, who told
of his connection with the contemners of
the law. His argument admitted the facts
depended upon to prove a contempt, but
he alleged many mitigating circum
stances. " â
Then came Attorney Heney, who talked
for more than two hours. He devoted
most of his time to a consideration of
the law points involved. He said there
were two kinds of contempt, criminal and
civil, and that the dignity of the court
was the essential thing to be upheld in a
criminal contempt. Running through
common law and equity procedures in
contempt cases, he claimed that the lib
erty of the person was the dearest right
of all. and that it was the especial duty
of courts to see . that this was secured
Technical contempt, without intent, he
felt sure, would not be considered.
When Heney got to the facts of the
case he sought to switch the charge of
conspiracy to the other side. He said:
"I propose to show that there was a
conspiracy, a conspiracy on the part of
defendants to win Â¦ those suits by foul
means or fair. That, their purpose was
not to vindicate the dignity of this court
but to vilify Judge Noyesâ him"
until he should be removed by the Presi
dent of the United States, or, failing In
this, to use every effort to have put aside
the one man who stood in the way of
their foul deeds." y
Heney's diatribe against the amicuV
curiae for the methods he used in the
taking of the testimony was delivered,
angrily.
The arguments will continue this morn
ing. iÂ»)BrtM
Olympians Will Entertain.

THE HERRIN INCUBUS.
WITH the incoming of the new management
of the Market-street railway system the out
look is propitious for the establishment of
excellent relations between the management and its
employes and also between the company and the pub
lic. There is every prospect that the arrogant and domi
neering rule of Vining will give way to a system of
control better fitted to win the respect and retain the
favor of all who are in any way affected by the policy
of the manager-
On taking possession of the San Mateo road the new
managers at once manifested their interest in the wel
fare of the employes and of the public. They have
provided for the employes a gymnasium, a library
and a recreation and club room, where they may spend
much of their leisure time with profit and with ad
vantage. It is thus evident that it is the intention of
the new managers to lighten the work of the em
ployes as much as possible, make the service attractive
as well as profitable and in short to do all in their
power to render the employes satisfied with the com
pany and loyal to its interests.
Similar improvements in the conditions of the em
ployes of the Market-street system may be expected
as soon as the new management can provide plans
for carrying them out. In place of the old domination
there is to be friendlir.ess and a frank recognition of
the rights of the workers. The old order of things is
to give way to one which will be better in every re
spect, and it can hardly be doubted that the improve
ment in the service will be felt not only by the com
pany itself but by the public, to whom the service is
Tendered.
Of course better relations with the public are
rot to be established without opposition and,
as might be expected, the opposition centers
round the person of \Y. F. Herrin. Mr. Her
rin is the attorney for the Spring Valley .Water
(Xompany. the gas company, the Southern Pacific
Railroad and the Market Street Railway Company.
By reason of the influence he has or is supposed to
have through his connection with these corporations,
he is enabled to do a very profitable law business on
his own account, as litigants who have large interests
at stake in the courts are not infrequently willing to
pay him great sums for the use of his signature to a
brief.
Mr. Herrin is useful to the Spring Valley Water
Company and to the gas company because they need
his peculiar influence in dealing with the city govern
ment. The Market-street railway, on the other hand,
has no use for Mr. Herrin at a!!. It requires no great
discernment, however, to perceive that it is to the
interest of the gas company and the water company
to keep Mr. Herrin in the position of attorney for as
many large corporations as they can. Every such
corporation that employs him adds to his power and
increases his usefulness to the two companies that
need him. That, moreover, is not all. The employ
ment of Herrin by the Market Street Railway Com
pany not only gives him more influence in serving
the water and the ga? company, but it also lightens
the payments they have to make him. In fact the
Market-street company is made use of in the service
of the water and the gas company and is made to pay
for the privilege of rendering the service.
San Francisco rightly expects good things of the
new management of her street railways. The record
of the management in other cities is highly encourag
ing to the best hopes that are felt here. It is believed
the new managers will take the company out of poli
tics and that it will be no longer a corrupting force in
municipal affairs. To realize those expectations it will
be necessr.ry for the company to dismiss Herrin. It
will not be enough to say that the company itself does
not employ him corruptly, for it is known that other
corporations will vse him in that way. There is but
one way for the Market-street company to make cer
tain of pleasant and beneficial relations with the pub
lic and that is by the dismissal from the company's
service of W. F. Herrin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1901.
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
THE railroad combination recently effected has
commanded approval in some quarters because
of its expected demonstration that the united
systems can be operated from one center and, there
fore, that their operation in concentration by the Gov
ernment under public ownership, being possible, will
be so desirable that their acquisition by the Govern
ment will follow.
As we have said heretofore, the evolution of Ameri
can roads from the link to trunk lines, and from trunk
lines to systems, was to secure convenience to their
patrons and economy in operation. This economy,
of course, reappeared in increased profit and this was
divided with the patrons in the form of cheaper rates.
Take what is now the New York Central system
as an illustration. In 1855 the links which now com
pose it charged an average passenger rate of 3.72 cents
per mile. In 1809 the average rate over the same links
consolidated into a system was 1.82 cents per mile.
The average passenger rate on the Central Pacific
in 1872 w.is 3 83 cents per mile, and by 1897 on the
Southern Pacific system, of which the Central had
become a part, the average rate was 1.964 cents per
mile.
Describing the "link" -roads as the primitive and the
"systems" as the improved method, the reduction in
freight rates resulting from the change was on the
New York Central 84 per cent. Pennsylvania Central 80
per cent, Milwaukee and St. Paul 75 per cent, Illinois
Central ~8 per cent, Southern Pacific 64 per cent. In
passenger rates the average in this country in 189S
was 1994 cents per mile, while the rate in Great Brit
ain for first-class passengers was 4.24 cents and for
third class 2.02 cents, in France first class 4.04, Ger
many 3.03. Russia 3.63, Austria 3.83, Italy 3.63, Hol
land 323, Belgium 2.42 cents per mile. This includes
the group affected by government ownership of the
roads, and in them all the rate for second-class passen
gers is higher than our first-class rate, and in most of
them the third-class rate is higher than our average.
In all of the continental countries which own and
operate government roads private corporations also
own and operate roads. Italy appointed a commission
to report on government ownership in respect to its
economy compared with corporate ownership. That
commission reported that in the six countries, Aus
tro-Hungary. Germany. Belgium, Denmark, Norway
and Sweden, the ratio of expenses to earnings on gov
ernment roads was 67.66 and on private roads 56.16
per cent. So that in that group the cost of govern
ment operation exceeded private operation by 20.7
per cent.
The same commission reported that in France the
ratio of expense to 'earnings was, on government
roads 81.5, on private roads 53.8; Germany, 54.9 to
54.2; Netherlands, 59.9 to 51.9.
The Italian commission reported that: "The state
is essentially a political institution, which has for its
object the protection of private rights and the pro
motion of public good, net the exercise of industrial
pursuit*; that railroad management could not be con
sidered a state function: that the state should not or
could not undertake that which should be left for the
citizen?, cither alone 01 associated, to do; that it re
etricted the field of individual action and enterprise,
was a social and political injury and tended to dimin
ish liberty."
Thereupon Italy divested herself of railway manage
ment by turning the state roads over to private par
ties, and in three years the wages of the employes
were increased 14 per cent and the ratio of expenses
to earnings decreased.
The Government statistician of New South Wales
reports that in Australia the Government railroads
cost $64,450 per mile, while private lines operating in
the same territory cost only $18,000 to $36,000 per
mile. The earnings of the Government roads, charg
ing three to four t*mes the rates of the United States,
were 3.02 per cent, ana the interest paid was 3.99 per
cent, leaving or. annual deficit of .97, or nearly 1 per
cent, that was levied as a general tax on the people,
amounting to, $5,607,063, which they had to pay in ad
dition to railroad rates three to four times higher
than in the United States.
These Â£re authentic statistics and they prove be
yond dispute that in the conduct of industrial en
terprises government waste is equal to corporate
profit. We have contended that if submitted to proper
accounting and actuary methods it would be demon
strated that the same rule holds good in the munici
pal ownership and operation of such public utilities as
gas, water and street railways. The same infirmity is
found to be common to strong autocratic govern
ments like Russia, bureaucratic systems like Germany
and qualified democracies like France and Australia,
and if there are any reasons for anticipating anything
different under our popular form of government they
are not yet proved.
It is said the President and Mrs. Roosevelt have
been forced to abandon their plan of holding informal
Friday afternoon receptions because of the mob of
people that attend them. Evidently Washington has
become too large a city for our Presidents to con
tinue customs that were good enough in the past. At
the present time there is a sufficient number of
sightseers in Washington at nearly all seasons to
overrun any official who would undertake to see them
all.
THE MERCHANTS' BANQUET.
THE annual banquet of the Merchants' Associa
tion has ndw become something like. an estab
lished institution of the city. It is to be hoped it
will flourish from generation to generation. It brings
together in a spirit of harmony and congeniality men
of all parties who have taken a prominent part in the
upbuilding of the city and helps to brighten and stimu
late the spirit of civic patriotism.
Public it terest in the banquet this year was some
what diminished by the absence of Mayor-elect
Schmitz, who was expected to speak on municipal
betterment. There is, of course, a good deal of curi
osity to hear from him a direct statement of the pro
gramme he will pursue in office, and it was believed the
desire would be fully gratified by his address at the
banquet. In the inevitable disappointment caused by
his absence, due to sickness in his family, there is
something of gratification in the frank letter of ac
ceptance he had written on receiving the invitation
and which was read during the evening.
In the letter Mr. Schmitz renewed the declarations
made to the public through The Call immediately af
ter the election. Among other things the letter says
'â¢ln the present circumstances it is with especial pride
that I embrace the privilege of being with you in or
der that I may present to you and your association
the views I have always expressed through my entire
campaign with my election/that through me the rec
ognition of the wage earners of San Francisco does
not mean an industrial or social revolution, that it
does not imply a destruction of vested interests or the
injury of property rights, but that it indicates that the
constantly reiterated imputation of the irresponsibility
of the honest working classes is without foundation;
that all elements of our community are entitled to fair
and equal consideration and that under my adminis
tration there is just reason to hope that the relations
between capital and labor will be so adjusted that
peace and prosperity will reign without interruption
throughout this great city of ours."
With the sentiments thus expressed there will be,
of course, no disagreement. Mr. Schmitz during the
campaign had the misfortune to appear as a class can
didate, but of course he cannot be a class Mayor. Ho
is now to be the chief magistrate of the city and conse
quently stands as the representative of all the people.
It is certainly the wish of the whole community that
his administration should be marked by peace and
prosperity, and his efforts to that end will not lack
of support from all good citizens.
For the rest, the speeches of the banquet were elo
quent in the statement of things done and in the
promise of better things to be accomplished hereafter.
The tone of every address was wholesome and san
guine, as befits a city of optimists. The evening, in
fact, was a memorable one, and the Merchants' Asso
ciation scored another brilliant success to add to its
annals.
Figures compiled by the Bureau of Statistics at
Washington show that Great Britain had in 1900 a
little over 17 per cent of the foreign trade of the
world, Germany had something more than 11 per
cent and the United States a little more than 10 per
cent. The showing is not quite what we would like,
but we have the satisfaction of knowing that our
share is increasing and in a few years will be the big
gest of the bunch.
THE CANAL TREATY.
DISPATCHES from Washington announcing
the signing of the new canal treaty by Secre
tary Hay and Lord Pauncefote state that while
the exact language of the treaty will not be made pub
lic until after its submission to the Senate,' yet there
is every assurance that the summary given to the
press some days ago is essentially correct. We have
therefore a fairly comprehensive knowledge of the
terms of the new arrangement, and there seems to be
no reason to doubt they will be satisfactory to both
nations. Thus the long wrangle over the subject
seems to be ended at last and one of the greatest ob
stacles in the way of the construction of the canal
is about to be removed.
The virtual effect of the new treaty is to eliminate
Great Britain from the problem. The old f joint guar
antee arrangement devised in the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty is set aside. There is to be no longer any
thing in the way of a partnership between ourselves
and Great Britain in the control of the canal. We
are to have a free hand in arranging for the construc
tion of the canal, for its maintenance and defense and
for its neutrality.
The terms are not enly satisfactory to us, but they
can hardly be less so to Great Britain. One of the
objections made by British diplomatists to the forti
fication of the can v ul by the United States was that
as Great Britain was a partner to the guarantee of
neutrality, her Government might be held responsible
by other powers for what the United States might
do in the matter. Under the old treaty no one could
question the validity of that objection. The new
treaty sets it aside altogether. Great Britain is to
have no more to do with the canal than Germany or
France, and her diplomatists need have no more anx
iety on the subject.
The British press generally appears to approve the
treaty, h is true the London Chronicle complains
that the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne,
"has surrendered everything without compensation,"
but the Chronicle is naturally inclined to make a
point against the Ministry whenever it can, and, more
over, it seems to have a special spite against Lans
downe. Something must be allowed for the play of
partisan politics. The other leading papers in Lon
don have heartily commended the terms of the treaty
that have been made public. The Pall Mall Gazette
says: "We are surrendering a right we would never
think seriously of exercising but which might be in
fringed at any moment to the grave detriment of
British dignity." That seems to be the prevailing
opinion in London and it is unquestionably well
founded. Whatever rights Great Britain may have
had in the proposed waterway have long since been
rendered obsolete by the changed conditions of the
world, and it is wisdom on the part of her statesmen
to recognize the fact iAd act upon it instead of waiting
until the recognition is forced upon them, and what
now passes as concessions would appear as surrender.
The London Times says: "It is premature to as
sume that all difficulties have been overcome and that
the Senate will ratify the treaty." The warning may
be taken here as well as in London. The opponents
of the canal defeated the undertaking of the enter
prise last year by attacking the treaty which was then
submitted. They are men of ingenuity and it is not
impossible that they will find some pretense upon
which to make an attack upon the new one. Over
and over again prospects as bright as those which now
appear before the great enterprise have been blighted.
We may sure the fight is- not yh abandoned by the
great forces which have so long baffled the will of
the people. Even now nothing but a resolute expres
sion of public sentiment can make sure of the begin
ning of the work of construction during the coming
year.
The newly adopted constitution of Alabama not
only excludes negroes from the exercise of the fran
chise, but it also provides that the Legislature shall
meet but once in four years and State elections are to
be held at the same intervals, so that practically the
black man will be about as good as the white in State
affairs f^r three years out of every four.
Baltimore has a young woman who went out on the
street about midnight with a bottle of laudanum in
one hand and a pistol in the other and tearfully im
plored evtrv man she met to keep her from commit
ting suicide, so now we may as well be on thÂ« look
out for a new aspirant for the honor of elevating the
stage.
It is stated that a single exhibitor at the New York
automobile show made sales during the exposition
amounting to something like $1,000,000, which is only
another proof that a society fad sometimes develops
big business for those who know how to appeal to it.

TREMENDOUS CROWD FILLS THE OPERA HOUSE
TO ENJOY THE ART OF EAMES AND SEMBRICH
"Le Nozze di Figaro"
the Hit of the
Season.
Biggest Triumph
Achieved in
Years.
Blanche Partington
A GLORIOUS cast, a splendid per
formance and the largest house
of the season is the tale of last
night's grand opera, with "Le
Nozze di Figaro" for the bill.
This is opera in its lusty youth, writ
when the day was young and the lark
sang high in the air. There is the dew
and freshness of the morning about it,
brave sunshine an^ bubbling laughter.
No smell of the lamp is here, but the
clean fragrance of the young spring. The
whole opera breathes immortal youth,
strength, gayety, freedom. It blends grave
and gay with magic art, and lifts the lis
teners to a hilarious joy in mere living as
it was interpreted last night. It is music
at its simplest, purest, happiest, and its
grace will continue to gladden as long as.
there are singers like last night's to in
terpret its thousand and one delights.
Last night's house was enthusiastic to
a degree, with every reason for its being
so. The cast, that included Eames, Sem
brich. Fritzi Scheff., De Reszke and Cam
par.ari. was without a flaw, down to its
least important members, and the or
chestra, under Mr. Seppilli's leadership,
was at its very most.
The conjunction of Eames and Sembrich
in the cast naturally was the chief inter
est of the evening and each essayed a
part admirably suited to her powers,
Eames as the Contessa and Sembrich as
Susanna. Sembrich has a little the purer
Mozartean flavor in her work, but Eames
was adorable as the Contessa. The concert
ed efforts of the two divas were a mar
vel. The rich warmth of Sembrich's voice
and the cool purity of Eames' made deli
cious harmony, and the famous "letter
duet," in which now one, now the other,
Â¦he combined sweetness of both
voices is heard, was a superbly beautiful
effort. Sembrich leans naturally to com
edy, and the shrewd coquettish wailing
maid was as splendidly played as sung
by this incomparable artist. She was in
lovely voice and was tumultuously wel
comed by the house. Eames, as usual,
was a beautiful picture as the Contessa
and Bang in the friendly rivalry of the
evening at her beautiful best. Her "Dovt
Sono" was given with all the fine and fin
ished grace of which Mme. Eames is so
richly possessed and was awarded an im
mense encore. This is Mme. Eames' first
appearance here out of German opera and
though that would seem to be her moro
familiar atmosphere, she was admiraoly
at home in Mozart's masterpiece.
Fritzi Scheff and Miss Bauermeistor
were the Cherubino and Marcellina of tha
< as: and Miss Baucrmeister was mora
than usually sufficient as Marcellina.
Fritzi Scheff scored a triumph in h<?r
usual piquant fashion as Cherubino. She
hit ihe boyish impertinenfs air to a nice
ty was awkward, impudent and amorous
by turns in a way that fulfilled all neces
sary requirements. She fell over ncr
sk'rt as if she had never seen one at her
heels before, and stuck out her elbovs
a well as she sung "Voi che Sapete. '
which was quite admirably indeed. The
house thought s=o. and Miss Fritzi wu.s
bound to repeat the dainty aria.

CONSUMPTION
Their Cause and How Contracted.
Catarrh and consumption are germ dis-
eases in every sense of the word, local in
nature and not hereditary or blood dis-
eases. The germs of both diseases may
be taken in the stomach or injected into
the blood without endangering a person's
health in the least. But let these germ.-
become dry and inhaled in the air we
breathe, then if there Is any irritated or
sore spots, such as are caused by coughs
and colds, on the membrane lining the
air passage, these germs attach them-
selves to these spots, receive nourishment
from them and multiply with astonish-
ing rapidity.
The old theory that germs of these dis-
eases are carried by the blood to the dif-
ferent parts of the body has long since
been exploded. The germs themselves re-
main in the head and lungs and it is the
product of their digestion (a poison called
toxine) that finds its way into the circu-
lation, causing coughs, emaciation, fever
and weakness, these being symptoms of
and not the disease itself.
Up to the present time there is only
one permanent cure # for these diseases
i known, and according to Government sta-
tistics this treatment has reduced the
death rate from catarrh and consump-
tion 33 per cent yearly since its discov-
ery. Such authority as this cannot be
disputed and no person affected with
these diseases has any right or excuse to
jeopardize their lives by using other rem-
edies.
Hyomei, the new Australian dry air
germicide, cures coughs, catarrh and
conEumution because it is the only one
which can be inhaled in the air we
breathe and this the only way by which
the germs causing these diseases can be
reached and destroyed. "â¢

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1901.
De Reszke, master of every style, last
night was the Count Almaviva, which is
equivalent to saying ..hat it was done in
a fashion that would have gladdened Mo
zart's heart had he been there to see. Da
Reszke is never in anything but good
voice. He always looks everything he un
dertakes. He' sings his parts always as
they should be sung, and last night's was
simply another in the tale of his achieve
ments. Mr. Campanari was the Figaro,
and though it is not 'juite so forceful a.
creation as his Marcel in "La Boheme" â
where I think him at his best â it was s-;i;
isfying and effective work. In Mr. Tavec
chia, new, if I mistake not, here, there
was a good Bartolo, with the appropriate
buffo air, and Mr. Reiss was a vocally
agreeable Basilic The minor parts w?re
all well cared :"or, the chorus effective ancl
the modest SeppHli was at last drawn to
tho stage to bow acknowledgments for his
excellent work at the conductor's desk.
One's mind keeps returning now to one
now to another Diece of exquisitenessâ
Cherubino's and Susarna's little whisper
ing duet; the marvelous bit of concerted
work at the end of act one. with the sev Â¦
en voices; the fresh, gossipy orchestra
tionâbut there's no end to it. Calve to
night can hardly be a greater triumph;
but we wait.
TELLS WITNESS
HE "SQUEALS"
Robert Ammon Enlivens
the Franklin Syndi
cate Case.
NEW YORK, Nov. 19.â There was a fur
ther hearing before Referee John A. Stra
ley to-day in connection with the failure
of Seymour, Johnson & Co., into which it
is alleged went some of the money earned
by the "520 per cent" Franklin syndicate,
and it developed some bitterly sarcastic
encounters between principals and wit
nesses.
Robert Ammon, counsel for the Frank
lin syndicate, was the first witness heard,
but he declined to answer many ques
tions on the ground that he was under
arrest for his connection with the syndi
cate. He swore that he had placed $140,
00 of the syndicate's money with Sey
mour, Johnson & Co., but that he had
withdrawn $10,000 and that Alfred R. Gos
lin had drawn $30,000 of the sum. He also
testified that Goslin had drawn $73,000
from the defunct firm of Seymour, John
son & Co.
Goslin followed Ammon on the stand
and said that Ammon's testimony about
the money he had withdrawn from Sey
mour, Johnson & Co. was false. Goslin
then said that a number of financial trans
actions of the defunct firm had been dis
honest and Ammon interrupted to accuse
him of "squealing."

LICENSES TO WED
Mistake of a Portland
Judge Causes Con
sternation.
PORTLAND, Nov. 19.â Six Portland
honeymoon parties have been called back
| to be remarried. This strange predicament
; has caused a local sensation, as many of
the persons concerned are among the
most prominent in local society.
Since the death of County Clerk Holmes
last Thursday the marriage mill has boon
grinding as fast as usual and the would
be benedicts desiring licenses have been
accommodated by County Judge Cake.
To-day his attention "was called to an
opinion expressed by a leading attorney
that the licenses issued by him were ille
gal. He looked up authorities and, to his
consternation found that he had issued
illegal licenses to a half dozen coupies,
whose marriages were solemnized with
due ceremony, after which the honeymoon
parties went" speeding to various parts of
the country.
When Judge Cake announced to-day in
the court room that the licenses issued
since the death of County Clerk Holmes
were illegal, as he had no authority under
the Oregon code to issue them, there was
consternation in the families whose
daughters, traveling on honeymoon trips,
were not in lawful wedlock.
Telegrams were sent in all directions,
and many of the newly wedded husbands
and wives were advised to get married
"for keeps'' as soon as they could. In
the meantime the cupids of the County
Clerk's office were advised to shut down
the marriage factory. This was immedi
ately done. Eeverai couples whose wed
dings had been arranged were in a great
predicament and appealed to the Circuit
judges to marry tnem, but to no avail.
Several marriages were consummated in
Vancouver, Wash., which is the Gretna
Green for this neighborhood.
The persons affected by Judge Cakes
announcement are: Edwin E. Cox and
Nelli* Victor Tozier, J. H. Wigle and
Mrs. Mary Nelmo, A. F. Butelspacher
and Sophia C. Nattestad, John M. Hutter
and Belle Taylor, St. Clair F. Stenner
and Anna Gundlach, Charles E. Proud
foot and Edith Bourgdahl.
This morning a license was issued for
Guy E. Reynolds and Annie J. Wright,
but before Reynolds left the office the or
der not to make out any more licenses
was received. The license was revoked
and his money was returned to him. The
I young man was greatly agitated and
rushed into Judge Cake's chambers to
ascertain the cause of the difficulty.
Some one had told him that a nunc pro
tune order would fix it, and he asked the
Judge to help him out in that way, but
the Judge informed him that "nunc pro
tune" did not go in marriage license
cases. If he procured a license and got
married it could not be "nunc pro tunct
ed."
Reynolds went upstairs and sought the
advice of Judge George, with the same re
sult. Judge George opined that only the
County Clerk could issue marriage li
censes, and he was dead. The young man
next tackled Commissioner Mack, and In
quired what could be done about it, and
Mack to!d him the only thing he could do
was to go to Vancouver, "Washington, and
I get a license.

FOREIGN EYES
ON NEW TREATY
A French Journal Says

PARIS, Nov. 19.â The Journal dcs De
bats says to-day it regards the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty as a signal victory for
Washington, and adds:
"The submission of England is as com
plete as the American Senate could wish.
It is interesting to again note that Eng
land cannot live at peace with the United
States except at the cost of perpetual
concessions and sacrifices."
The Temps sees in the treaty a striking
demonstration of mutual good will of two
powers who have long been animated by
unfriendly sentiments toward one an
other, and, above all, of the value Great
Britain sets on securing even by sacri
ficing certain interests the good graces of
American public opinion.
The treaty itself, the Temps also says,

trary to the
Law.
Women Scream and
Faint in the
Crush.
THE Fire Commissioners and Chief
of the Fire Department Sullivan
are not likely to allow a repetition
of the flagrant violation of the or
dinances governing theaters that
was witnessed last night at the Grand
Opera House, when an enormous audience
gathered to hear the great cast of Grau
singers in "Le Nozze di Figaro."
Although every seat in the theater was
sold out, the management allowed the sale
of general admission tickets, well know
ing that the purchasers could not be ac
commodated in the building without en
dangering the lives and limbs of the
throng-.
The scene in front of the Grand Opera
House and in the lobby of the building for
an hour previous to the opening of the
doors was a tribute to the Grau singers,
but it was not in keeping with the doings
of society.
Two police officers were powerless to
keep order in the lobby and in front of the
building, while at the entrance to the gal
lery a wild scene was enacted. Hundreds
of men and women struggled to make
their way to the ticket sellers, and when
they secured the coveted pieces of pasteÂ«
board the management would not allc*
them to enter the theater, the reason be
ing given that the reserved seat holders
must be first allowed to take their seats.
Women screamed and dresses were torn
to ribbons in the lobby of the opera house
until finally the word was given to allow
the holders of general admission tickets
to enter the theater.
In a few minutes every inch of the aisles
was blocked and when the holders of tick
ets for boxes, the orchestra and dress cir
cle sought to take their seats it required
the courage of a football player to try and
get through the mass of humanity.
Ladies garbed in gorgeous array were
forced to struggle after their escorts who
sought to make a passage way through
the densely packed aisles. Valuable dresses
were torn and, in some cases, jewels were
wrenched away. When the overture" be
gan the seats were not half filled, owing
to the inability of ticket holders to gain
their places.
DoEens of timid women shrank from,
running the gauntlet of the crowd in the
aisles and waited until the first >act was
over, when those who had been sitting ia
the aisles sought the lobby for fresh air.
There was little promenading by the hold
ers of reserved and box seats last night,
as the crowded aisles rendered ingress and
egress impossible. The performance was
an enjoyable one but was marred by the
inconvenience and danger to which every
member of the big audience was subjected
in order that the box office receipts migat
be swelled by a few hundred dollars. The
ordinances of the Fire Department posi
tively prohibit the blocking of aisles cr
doorways in theaters.
SYBIL SANDERSON WTXIi
ATTEND MINSTREL SHOW
r-istinguished Prima Donna to Oc
cupy Box at the California
To-Morrow Evening. â¢
Sybil Sanderson, the distinguished Cali
fornia prima donna now appealing in
grand opera at the Grand Opera-house,
will attend to-morrow night's perform
ance of Haverly's Minstrels at the Cali
fornia Theater, a box having been ten
dered for her use by Managers Elling
house and Oppenheimer.
Mme. Sanderson accepted the courtesy
with apparent delight. She states that
she was always very fond of minstrels,
and that it was her sincere desire to wit
ness a performance of that kind. When
her statement to that effect appeared in
The Call, the managers of the California
decided to give her the opportunity of en
joying the show with the result stated.
CALVE APPEARS THIS EVENING.
Famous Diva to Be Heard in Favo
rite Role of Carmen.
To-night Mme. Calve will make her first
appearance in this city and will be heard
in her famous role of "Carmen" in Bizet's
grand opera of that name.
The indisposition of the diva last week
was a matter of deep regret to her and It
was only the positive injunction of her
physicians that prevented her appearance
on the second night of the season.
Mmc Calve has in the past few days
enjoyed the air of the park and the ocean
beach and last evening she.' declared that
she was in as good voice as at any time
in her career. . â¢ .-
The management of the Grand Opera
house announces that every seat has been
sold for this evening and society will un
doubtedly make a brave display. Calve
will be the last star to be presented by
Manager Grau, and in fashion's circles,
as well as among music lovers, there is
the keenest interest to hear the prima
donna who Is bo closely associated with
the role of the wayward cigarette girl.
is an excellent solution of the difficulty,
and from an economic point of view ought
to awaken general congratulations.
LONDON, Nov. 19.â The Globe this aft
ernoon discusses the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty in its usual ultra-jingo tone. It
ba 'MLJnless Lord Pauncefote and Secretary-
Hay have strictly observed the principle
of quid pro quo the treaty is far more
likely to impair than to strengthen friend
liness. If British rights on the isthmus
have been abandoned without a tangible
equivalent it will not be long before Great
Britain is invited to surrender the West
Indies and even Canada as peace offerings
to American Chauvinism."
TappÂ«d the Till.
Mrs. Fredell, who keeps a store at 1272
Folsom street, reported to the police last
night that the till in her store had been
tapped by two men. How much they se
cured she could not tell. She claims that
one of the men enticed her into a corner
while the other extracted the money. She
is of the opinion that she could recognize
the robbers.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 19.â The stock market to
day was under the continued Influences and
factors which depressed values yesterday and
discouraged speculation for an advance. Prob
ably the outward movement of gold was the
most effectual of these factors, but the ex
pressed determination of the Executives of
Northwestern States to use their influence to
contest the operation of the Northern Securi
ties Company was also an obvious influence,
especially on the stocks of the transcontinental
group. Union Pacific and St. Paul were espe
cially affected. The argument that such op
position to the company was expected owing to
the statutes of the Northwestern States In
tended to prevent consolidation, and that emi
nent legal counsel had co-operated to evade
these prohibitions was not very convincing in
quieting apprehension based on the assumption
that the residents of these States are earnest
ly opposed to the spirit and purpose of the
new company, leaving only the question open
as to their ability to prevent by law its opera
tion. The bears sold the market actively on
the announcement of the engagement of $1,000,
00 additional gpld for export on Thursday, but
there was a large demand to cover later in the
day when half of this engagement was can
celed, and when the money market was seen
to be unaffected. A jump of 2 centimes in the
sterling exchange rate at Paris, a decline in
the private discount rate there and a slight
reaction here in exchange rates both on London
and the Continent, reflected the relaxations re
sulting from yesterday's enormous outgo of gold
and aroused the hope that the largest part
of the requirements are satisfied. There is
still confidence expressed that the offerings of
Government bonds tor redemption will main
tain the ease of the money market, even if
more gold goes out It is not Improbable that
the selling of Government bonds comes â¢ indi
rectly in part from the Interests who have
to remit in payment of foreign obligations. It
Is evident that the 'exchange market is con
cerned to a. certain extent, and even the bills
against outgoing cotton and grain which come
upon the market are contracted for in advance
leaving the bankers who are short of exchange
still under the necessity of shipping gold to
c.over maturities. One feature of the Govern
ment bond redemptions that has not attracted
attention is that the national banks apparently
consider the present price sufficiently attrac
tive to prompt them to withdraw bonds on de
posit with the treasury to secure their circula
tion, and offer them for redemption. This
process involves the release of cash from the
treasury to the amount of the market value of
the bonds, but it also involves the retirement
01 circulation to the amount of the par value
of the bonds, offsetting that far the supply of
money to the market. Such withdrawals of
bonds have already reached the legal limit of
53. 'â¢00,000 per month for the present month.
There was some special strength shown to-day
by Individual stocks, notably American Car and
International Power, on the urgent demand for
railroad equipment. of all kinds, and the ex
press company stocks on account of the general
business activity of the country. There were
strong spots among the coalers and the local
tractions. The market closed steady at a sub
stantial rally from the lowest

at slight recessions. Total sales, $2,630 000

a strong and firmer market. The stock of wool
offered on the market is necessarily consider
ably reduced by the- trading of the past three
weeks, and some lines are narrowed down
pretty closely. The outlook for the market

WHEATâ Was weak again all over the world,
with lower Paris and Liverpool futures. Brad
street's gave the status of the world's stocks
as follows: East of the Rockies, an increase of
7,370,000 bushels; Europe and afloat, an in
crease of 2,500,000; total increase, 10,170,000 bush
els, which is an .enormous gain. Broomhall re
ported the weather in the Argentine more fa
vorable, but did not change his previous esti
mate of a surplus of 16,000,000 bushels In that
country.
Chicago fell off. but partially recovered.
There was less activity and the bulls seemed to
have lost their advantage. Conditions were
against them. Wires to Bolton, De Ruyter &
Co. said that on account of the large Increase
In the visible supply the weakness in coarse
grains and the big receipts in the Northwest
the selling movement became general. There
was a little foreign buying, but it was soon
satisfied by liberal offerings. At the same time
the weather was too dry In the West and
Southwest and there were a good many coun
try buying orders. St. Louis reported heavy
export buying and a large demand for Southern
and Southwestern mills. New Orleans was
firm, but buyers refused to pay an advance.
This market was dull and unchanged.

with a good demand for the West and South
west, and light stocks in California.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
What with warm and moist -weather and
rapidly growing feed, and heavy supplies of
fresh and cold storage goods the Butter mar
ket continues weak, with holders making con
cessions to sell. Prices are not quotably lower,
however.
Cheese remains steady at previous prices.
Ranch Eggs continue firm, and sellers are
able to make an occasional further advance in
prices. Stocks are liÃht. The medium and
Eastern grades are being helped by the firra
ne.-ia in ranch and the market Is in very fair
condition all around.
Receipts were 25,500 pounds of Butter,
pounds of Eastern Butter, 467 cases of Eggs,

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
The market, though quiet. Is reported In
rather better shape for sellers. Most of the
fruit has passed out of growers' Into dealers'
hands, and the latter are not disposed to give
It away, and are holding it steady. Raisins
are in fair movement, and a few new orders
are coming In. Nuts are moving off well, with
moderate stocks. The finer grades of comb
and extracted Honey are. also meeting with
more demand, but the lower grades are still
slow. Prices for everything remain unchanged.

Provisions,
The local market seems to be working around
into better shape aga'n. Dealers report more
staadlness, though prices show no improve
ment.
Chicago was higher again yesterday, but the
demand was purely speculative, as the cash
and European inquiry continued poor. Receipts
of Hogs at Chicago continue heavy and are
expected to accumulate, and this acts as a
damper on the market.

Hides, T allow, Wool and Hops.
There is no further change In Wool worthy
of note. The best grades are moving off fairly,
but the defective grades are still slow.
Hops stand the sam?. If growers would come
down to the views o? buyers a livelier mar

IS HIS BRIDE
Hotelman Potter of Los
Angeles Surprises
Friends.
Weds His Employe Quietly
and Tells No Person
About It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 19.â Milo M. Pot
ter, proprietor of the Van Nuys Hotel,
to-day recorded a notable and memora
ble event in his career. He was united In
marriage to the popular and efficient
housekeeper at the Van Nuys, Mrs. Nellie
Jones. Â¦
~y rotter's achievement was the more no
fjceable in this respectâ he accomplished
his wedding and left town with his bride
without scarcely a soul being the wiser.
At a late hour to-night no one around
the hotel knew anything definite about
tht? event.
The long retinue of clerks, waitr.
bellboys and chambermaids simply knew
that Potter and Mrs. Jones nad been
married and that they had gone north
on the "o*i" train, Vhe employes were
dazed and knew nothing further. Said
.Sight Clerk Strombach:
"One of the bellboys saw Mr. Potter
and his bride and the latter's daughter.
Miss Nina Jones, come from the rear ele
vator at a o'ciock. They all proceeded at
once to ' lie south entrance, where their
baggage was waiting. They got into a
carriage ana were driven away. Nobody
knew about it until they were gone. If
my life were in the balance 1 could not
say who married them or where they
have gone. "
Mrs. Jones has been the Van Nuy-.
housekeeper since tne opening of the
house, several years ago. This is Pot
ter's first venture into matrimony. Some
time ago he contributed an article pub
lished in a local newspaper entitled "Why
I Am a Bachelor." Late to-night a re
porter rapped at the room 01 Potter's
r.ald.
"What do you want?" called the maid.
"Tell me what you know about the wed
ding." shouted the reporter.
"I'm in bed with a cold in my head."
was the gloom,y word that came back.
"Besides. 1 don't know anything about it."

Jr?.':t and the reporter felt justified in
Withdrawing.
RAILWAY DETECTIVE
KILLS SAFE-CRACKER,
Criminal Comes to Grief in Attempt
to Rob a Seattle Ticket
Office.
SEATTLE. Nov. 19.â T. D. Rush, a
burglar, was killed this morning while
attempting to break into the safe of the
Northtrn Pacific ticket office. He was
killed by Detective Hunt, who had been
watching lor him for several day- Sinco
last Thursday night Rush had been slow
ly boring his way into the ticket office.
About 6:30 o'clock Thursday evening
Tick Seller | velsey heard the worK go
ing on., but at first believed the noise was
made by rats. His suspicions were later
aroused, however, and he notified the
police department that some one was try
ing to bore through the floor in the vicin
ity of the safe. The police set a watc"h,
&nd during Friday and Saturday nights
the work went on.
This morning the police made an inves
tigation. A ticket case standing close to
the safe was removed and two large holes
were uncovered. The would-be burglar
/was evidently using an Inch bit augur,
"^ arid there were aheady fifteen holes Â«ji
i the floor. These holes were within two
inches of the -i|re of the safe. Just un
der the right ena of the money box was
a big drawer of about the same dimen
sions as the aperture under the cash
drawer. This drawer was fastened by
hinges to a trap door. Finishing touches
on the job were completed on Sunday
night.
Last night two policemen and Private
Detective Hunt of the Northern Pacific
Railway ambushed the cracksman. Rush
opened the trap door and started work
on the bottom of the safe at about 1
o'clock. The officers in some way
alarmed him and he dodged through the
hole, closed the trap and stopped to bolt
It. Detective Hunt fired two shots
through the floor, one of which broke
Rush's arm and the other penetrated the
base of his brain. He fell from, the plat
form on which he was standing to the
ground a nd was shortly afterward re
moved in a dying condition from under
the building. He died at the hospital at
5 o'clock this morning.
Rush was identified by a bank book
found in' his shoe. It is not known
whether he had a confederate.

POSTTJM CEREAL.
COFFEE COMPLEXION.
Many Ladies Have Poor Complexions
From Coffee.
"Coffee caused dark colored blotches on
my face and body. I had been drinking it
for a long: while and these blotches grad-
ually appeared, until finally they became
permanent and were about as dark as cof-
iK itself.
*i formerly had as fine a complexion as
one could ask for.
When I became convinced that coffee
Â¦was the cause of my trouble, I changed
and took to using Postum Cereal Food
Coffee, and as I made it well, according
to directions, I liked it very much,, and
have since that time used it entirely in
p'.ace of coffee.
I am thankful to say I am not nervous
any more, as I was when I was drinking
coffee, and my complexion is now as fair
and good as it was years ago. It is very
plain that the coffee caused the trouble.
Please omit my name from public print."
Mre. , 2051 Ogden aye.. Chicago, 111.
The name of this lady can be given by the
Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle Creek,
Mich.
Most bad complexions are caused by
some disturbance of the stomach, and cof-
fee is the greatest disturber of digestion
known. Almost any woman can have a
fair complexion if ste will leave off cof-
fee and use Postum Food Coffee and nu-
tritious, healthy food in proper quantity.
The food coffee furnishes certain parts of
th* natural grains from the field that na-
4P* uses to rebuild the nervous system
aiid when that is in good condition one
can depend upon a good complexion as
well as a general healthy condition of the
body.
TRIP TO ORIENT
REVIVES RUMORS
Great Secrecy Veils Mis
sion of a Steamship
Manager.
Belief Is Expressed That He
Negotiated for New
China Line.
Among the passengers on the steam
ship China, which arrived from the Ori
ent on Saturday, was H. Heidenreich.
general manager of the Hamburg-Amerl-
BM Steamship Company at New York.
The coming of Heidenreich was made the
occasion for the spreading of numerous
reports to the effect that he was here
for the purpose of establishing a steam
ship line between San Francisco and the
Orient, the same to connect with the
Santa Fe Railroad. Efforts were made
by members of the local press to see
Heidenreich with reference to the rumor,
but to all cards stnt to his apartments
at the Palace the answer "not in" was
returned.
Hoidenreich left for Chicago without
warning yesterday morning. Inquiry
j-rnong officials of the Santa Fe Railway
during the day disclosed the fact that
Heldenrtich was unknown to them. The
it: formation was vouchsafed by the high
er officials that there was absolutely no
truth in the rumor that any steamship
line with Santa Fe connections was to
itablished at an early date. One of
the reports was that three fine liners
would be placed in commission before
May 1 next. If this was founded on fact,
the Harbor Commissioners knew nothing
ol the matter, and as they would have
to be consulted with reference to harbor
fac-lities. and as thty had not the pleas
ure of meeting: Heidenreich during his
brief stay in the city, it is likely that the
rumor lacks foundation.
Telegraphic reports from the East two
months ago announced that the steam
ship line mentioned was under considera
tion by the Hamburg-American Company.
That corporation denied the story abso
lutely. It is now claimed that Manager
Heidenroich's trip to the Orient was one
of pleas-ure only, and that it had no con
nection with the project alluded to.
While on a visit to the Custom-house
Monday Managei Heidenreich informed a
wel! known customs official that his com
pany would positively place three fine
siej.mers in commission between this
port and the Orient before May 1 next.
The statement has given rise to consid
erable speculation among customs offi
cials, who declare their belief that the
project will surely be carried through.
NOT GUILTY
IS HER PLEA
Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine's
Trial for Murder Is
Begun.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 19.-The trial of
Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine.on indictment for the
murder of the young census clerk, James
Seymour Ayres Jr.. in the latter's room at
the Kenmore Hotel in this city last May.
began to-day before Justice Anderson in
Criminal Court No. 1.
At 10:10 o'clock Mrs. Bonine appeared in
the court room, accompanied by the vet
eran guard. James W. Springman. She
walked in so quietly that the entrance was
scarcely noted and took a seat beside her
husband, just back of her counsel and in
front of her sister. Mrs. Wocham. She
smiled as she greeted her sister and the
latter placed her arms gently about her
as she sank into her seat.
Mrs. Bonine listened calmly to the read
ing- of the indictment and pleaded "not
guilty " in low but distinct tones. After
a brief statement of the case by Judge
Anderson, the examination of jurors was
begun and when the court adjourned for
the day the panel was exhausted. There
were twenty-six members of the panel and
of these fourteen were excused, leaving
twelve in the box.
The first contention between opposing
counsel arose in connection with the
calling of a juror named Smith, a col
ored man and an undertaker. He stated
that he had formed an opinion in the case
but that it was not bo firmly fixed that it
could not be modified by new testimony.
Doug-lass, of Mrs. Bonlne's. counsel, chal
lenged "for cause." District Attorney
Gould antagonized the challenge and
Douglass addressed the court, pleading for
liberal construction of the law, because
of the importance of the case. The chal
lenge, however, was overruled. Douglass
noted an exception, the first of the trial,
and then peremptorily challenged the ju
ror, who was excused. It is expected there
will be other challenges when the court
convenes to-morrow.
Mrs. Bonine was apparently as calm as
any of the spectators during the proceed
ings. She spoke frequently with her hus
band and sister and only once or twice
with her attorneys. During a part of the
day her two boys, respectively 15 and ]3
years of age. were in the court room. Af
ter adjournment she took dinner with her
friends in the prison dining room, being
closely attended all the time by her guard.
She was then returned to jail. The trial
will be resumed at 10 a. m. to-morrow.
DISCOVERS THE PROOF
OF THE NEBULAR THEORY
Professor Ritchey Makes an Astro
nomical Observation That Will
Bender Him Famous.
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â Professor G. V>\
Ritchey of Yerkes Observatory is reported
to have made a discovery in astronomy
which will make himself and the observa
tory famous. The discovery, in brief, is
the proof of what Is known as the nebular
theory, and Professor Ritchey appears to
have reduced to a matter of certainty
what has heretofore been merely a bril
liant hypothesis. It its claimed" that lie

evidence of evolution among the plane
tary bodies.
The Yerkes Observatory is part of the
University of Chicago, though located at
Williams Bay, Lake Geneva, Wis. It was
endowed by Charles T. Yerkes of this

With Handcuffs On in Jail

"While Thomas O'Brien, charged with
petty larceny, was being removed with
other prisoners in the patrol wagon from
the City Hall Station to the Hall of Jus
tice last night he attempted to escape at
the corner of Market and Kearny streets.
The prisoners were in charge of Officers
Birdsall and Hurley, while Officer Sullivan
was on the seat.
O'Brien succeeded in getting out of the
wagon and ran a short distance, when he
was captured by Birdsall. O'Brien shewed
fight and Hurley ran to help Birdsall. The
policemen found it necessary to use tOeir
clubs to subdue their captive.
After the irons were placed on O'Brien
he proceeded peacefully enough until he
got into the elevator to go to the prison'
The cage had only stalled when he raised
his hands over his head and attempted to
strike Birdsall with the handcuffs. A
warning cry from the other prisoners put
the officers on their guard and they went
after O'Brien. He fought desperately and
it was not until he was badly beaten that
he could be overcome. He was landel
bleeding and insensible in the City Prison.

Nearly all the details are now completed
for the great gift sale which will be held
at the Palace on Thursday for the benefit
of the San Francisco Nursery for Home
less Children.
The wonderful doll table, necktie table
and apron table will be stocked with a
most tempting collection of neckwear,
aprons and sawdust and bisque ladies.
For the past few days fairy fingers have
been fashioning 1 the ties and the aprons
and dressing the dolls. The result of all
this labor is one of marvelous and en
trancing beauty. The other tables arc
not being neglected, either, and will boast
of beautiful and useful articles, all of
which will be placed on sale at most rea
sonable prices.
The doll table, which will be presidei
over by Mrs. W. S. Leake, promises to be
a feature of the bazaar. Miss Georgle
Spieker and Miss Ruby Sessions, two
charming belles, will assist her in dispos
ing of the dolls on exhibition.
A special feature of the candy boolli
will be delicious home-made candy.
The outlook for the sale is a most prem
ising one and without doubt the nursery
will be much the richer for the efforts of
the charitable ladies who are interested
in the charity and who have charge of
the sales.

negotiations for their purchase were con

President Roosevelt's action in adorning
the hats of his coachman and footmen
with cocl*ades has created a good deal of
discussion in society. The origin of
the cockade dates back to the days when
soldiers used to "cock" their hats, that is
to say, hold the brim in position by means
of a bunch or rosette of ribbons, usually
consisting of the regimental colors. Long
after the three-cornered hat was aban
doned in the army it was retained as a
headgear for footmen and coachmen, and
indeed still to this day forms part and
parcel of the state liveries of great nobles,
high official dignitaries and of royal per
sonages in Europe, the nobles using a
cockade of the colors of their escutcheons,
while Embassadors, as a rule, make use
of the colors of their country for the
purpose.
When ordinary high silk hats came into
use for the wear of liveried servants the
cockade was transferred to the hat, and
worn no longer on the brim, but fastened
to the crown on the right side, and it is
this form of cockade that has been adopt
ed by President Roosevelt for his men in
livery.
Strictly speaking, the cockade should be
used by none but the servants of those
holding commissions in the army and
navy, and it is to be presumed that the
President has caused his domestics to
adopt it in his capacity as commander-in
chief of the naval and military forces of
the United States. In England, however,
the cockade is worn not only by the ser
vants^of officers of the army and navy,
but likewise by the domestics of all those
holding any kind of high office under the
crown, and on the Continent much the
same rule prevails, there being, indeed,
laws almost obsolete and rarely enforced
against the unwarranted use of the cock
ade.
The cockade forms part and parcel of
the liveries of all Old World rulers, those
of the President of the French republic
being red. white and blue, that is to say,
the colors of the republic.

Other soldiers" anti-Chamberlain meet
ings are to be held at Cologne, Mul
heim, Brunswick and Bonnvetie, and stu
dents' meetings of like character will be
held at Bonn, Wurzburg, Leipsic, Halle
and Munich, while popular meetings are
announced in Bochum, Brunswick and
other places.
Referring to these matters, the Post,
speaking semi-offlcially, says the Govern
ment sees no reason to identify itself
with the vehement utterances at irre
sponsible meetings, or to take action
against Chamberlain's accusations con
cerning the German soldiers, since the
latter's words at Edinburgh were noth
ing more than the private utterance of
the British statesman. But if the matter
is broached in the Reichstag affairs will
assume an entirely different course. In,
this event the Government would find
occasion to express itself befittingly.

PLOT TO BREAK
JAIL MISCARRIES
Murderer Suesser Fails
in Attempt to Free
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 19.â A plot to break
jail, with George Suesser, the murderer
of Sheriff Farley of Monterey County, at
its head, has been unearthed by Jailer
Dreischmeyer in the County Jail. Im
plicated with Suesser, who is under sen
tence of death, were Frank Johnson, an
ex-convict, who was taken to San Quentin
on Monday to serve a burglary sentence;
Jan John, a Chinese convicted of perjury,
and a prisoner named Curtis.
Owing to the overcrowded condition of
the jail the men were removed from the
little to the big tank. They occupied cells
adjoining one another. Some time ago a
man named Bowman was committed to
the jail. He was a cripple and on the side
of his shoe was a steel rod to support the
ankle. Suesser and the others took this
shoe from Bowman and out of the piece
of steel made a saw. The cripple was
threatened with vengeance if he reported
the loss of his shoe. This steel was con.
verted into an excellent saw and blankets
were torn and woven into a rope.
In the rear of the cells occupied by the
men were small windows covered by bars,
and above the bars another grating. It
was proposed to cut these with the saw.
The men could then climb to the ceiling,
and after cutting the bars over the sky
light reach the top of the building. Then
they could lower themselves to the ground
with the blanket rope.
Before the plans could be carried out
Johnson was taken to San Quentin and a
search of the cells revealed the hidden
articles by means of which the men hoped
to escape. Suesser and the two others are
now doing a itunt in solitary confinement.
COAL WAGON WRECKED
BY POST-STREET CAR
Brakes Did Not Hold and Valuable
Horse Will Die of Its
Injuries.
A coal wagon belonging to C. A. War
ren was wrecked on Post street. Just be
low Taylor, at noon yesterday by aji
electric car of the Pest street line, and a
valuable horse was so badly injured that
it will probably die. The driver, Walter
Stanton, was thrown violently from the
wagon and severely bruised. All of the
four horses of the team were more or less
bruised or battered nnd one side of the
car was wrecked, but, fortunately, none
of the passengers were hurt.
The car was coming at a high rate of
speed down the hill and the wagon was
going in the same dliection. As the car
approached the motorman applied the
brakes, but the rails were wet and the
brakes would not hold. The car plunged
ahead with its momentum scarcely dimin
ished and struck the wagon Just after
crossing Taylor street. The wagon was
lifted into the air and it and the horses
were carried more t^ian a hundred feet
down the street before the car stopped.
One of the horses, a fine bay animal val
ued at $175, was got free from the wreck
age of car and wagon only after much
effort, and then almost bled to death from
cuts in the groin befoic it could be taken
to a veterinary surgeon on Howard street.
Two women were on the front outside
seats of the car. but succeeded In jump
ing off without being injured. The pas
sengers inside were showered with coal
and broken glass, but no one was hurt,
and though one side of the front of the
car was ground into kindling wood the
motor man escaped injury.

URGE WARFARE
ON SALOONS
Christian Temperance
Women Define Their
Purposes.
New Officers Are Elected at
the Fort Worth Con
vention.
FORT WORTH. Tex.. New ID.â Three
prominent features marked the proceed
ings of the national convention of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
the last but one of the sessions, viz.: The
election of officers, the final deliverance
of a platform of principles and a decision
in respect to political action.
The last was not accomplished without
considerable debate, the extremists con
tending that as the convention had de
clared in its resolutions for Christian cit
izenship, a constitutional enactment con
cerning polygamy and monogamy sue
marriage and the necessity for prohibit
ing the manufacture, sale and distribu
tion of alcoholic liquors by law. it would
only be consistent to cast its fortunes
with the political party pledged to all of
these reforms.
The conservative portion of the converf
tion, however, held that as the cause of
opposition to the liquor traffic has so far
prospered through non-partisan action,
"let well enough alone" should continue
to be the motto. The latter view pre
vailed.
The national banner of the local Tem
perance Legion was won by Arkansas.
Resolutions were adopted as follows:
Advocating: total abstinence as the only safe
rule for each man and woman habit of life:
upholding the principle of prohibition a.-< the
only righteous protection against the most un
scrupulous and demoralizing: traffic on earth:
reaffirming the statement that "the American
army is far better off without intoxicants of any
kind." and Indorsing the anti-canteen law:
believing in a revival nt Christian citizenship
founded on divine Ideals of righteousness; de
ploring the death of the late President Me-
Kinley; favoring the peaceful solution of labor
troubles by arbitration and calling upon work
men to join in the battle against the saloon:
calling for perfect equality of men and women
before the law; demanding an amendment to
the constitution defining marriage as monoga
mous and punishing plural marriages by dis
qualification to vote or hold office, in addition
to severe penalties.
The election of officers resulted in the
selection of the following: President.
Mrs. Lillian M. Stevens; corresponding
secretary, Suzanna M. D. Frye: record-
Ing secretary. Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman;
treasurer. . Mrs. Helen Morton Barker;
vice president at large, Miss Anna V.
Gordon.
FALL FROM HIS HORSE
CAUSES FATAL SHOOTING
Shotgun Carried by a Bells Station
Youth Is Discharged and He
Is Killed.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 19.- Willie Hooper, the
U-year-old son of W. Hooper, a rancher
near Bells station, southeast of Gilroy,
was accidentally killed yesterday after
noon. The boy was riding to Gilroy on
horseback, carrying a loaded shotgun over
the horn of his saddle. In some way the
girth of the saddle became loosened and
the saddle slipped, throwing young
Hooper to the ground. The discharge of
the gun followed, the heavy load of shot
entering the boy's breast. Flesh and bonÂ©
were torn away, the heart being exposed.

CHIEF OF POLICE
NOT APPOINTED
Commissioners Make No
Reference to the
Subject.
Contrary to general expectation, the Po
lice Commissioners did not appoint a suc
cessor to the late Chief of Police Sulli
van at their meeting last night, and the
department still remains without other
than an acting head. The Commissioners
are non-committal on the subject and
would make no statement last night of
the probable time when the selection
would be made.
The subject was not touched upon in
any way at last night's meeting, and
when the routine business was finished
at H o'clock an adjournment was prompt
ly taken. President Xewhall said after
ward that the choice was not made at this
meeting, probably because the Commis
sioners did not feel it incumbent upon
them to act in the matter at this time.
He said the question of appointment
might be taken up at the next regular
meeting or a special meeting might be
called. It is quite probable that the Com
missioner? desired to consider so import
ant a question as the selection of a Chief
of Police in a special meeting, unham
pered by a mass of routine business.
The usual routine occupied the atten
tion of thf Commissioner? until 11 o'clock.
There wrre charges against officers to
hear, applications for appointments a>?
special policemen, for permits to carry
weapons and for liquor licenses t* con
sider, and charges of Illegal selling of
liquor by saloon-keepers to try.
The charge against Patrolman John J.
Hundreds of millions of tins
of Royal Baking Powder have
been used in making biscuit,
cake and hot breads, and every
spoonful of every tin has turned
out even, perfect work, always
making the bread, cake and
biscuit light, delicious and
wholesome.
b Was there ever another
such record for any article of
food in the world?

duty November 4, was dismissed. Mori
arty admitted the charge, but pleaded ill
ness, and Captain rfpillane said he be
lieved Moriarity was ill. but had preferred
the charge as a matter of formality.
The appointment of John Doyle, a
watchman on the Panama Railroad's
wharf, as a special policeman, was re
voked on evidence of his having been in
toxicated and threatening sober and
peaceable men with arrest.
Though the previous meeting had been
adjourned out of respect to the memory
of the late Chief of Police, formal reso
lutions were not adopted at that time.
The following were accordingly read and
adopted last night:
"Whereas, The Police Department of the City
and County of San Francisco has lost by the
untimely death of William P. Sullivan Jr., our
late Chief of Police, a true and honorable man,
who labored earnestly for the welfare of the
people and in the interest of the Police Depart
ment, and who was. an upright, patriotic and
Christian citizen; and
Whereas. We believe that his devotion to the
arduous duties of his office, in the face of
overwhelming difficulties met by him with
characteristic energy, caused the close of a life*
whose full promise had not been revealed; and
Whereas. We desire to declare our admiration
of his stainless character and faithful execu
tion of his^ trust: now be it therefore
Resolved," That this, the regular meeting, of
the Board of Police Commissioners, stand ad
journed as a mark of respect to his memory;
and be it further
Resolved, That we deeply sympathize with
the bereaved widow and the family of our de
ceased chief, and tender them our most sin
cere and heartfelt condolence in this, their
prrat affliction: and be it further
Resolved, That thf-sÂ»> ropolutionn be spread
upon the minutes of this meeting and that cn
prosse.i copies hr- presented to the widow and
the family of Chief Sullivan.

CARD SHARPERS
ROB MINING MAN
Robert W. Dunsmulr, a well known
mining man of British Columbia, had an
experience last Monday night that he will
not soon forget. H,e was the victim of
two of the cleverest' card sharpers known
to the police. Dunsmuir was mulcted out
of $9000, and only recovered the amount
with the assistance of Captain Seymour
and his detectives.
Dunsmuir is a guest at the Palace Ho
tel. He has been staying there far the
past week "With his wife and daughter.
On Monday night Dunsmuir went out
alone after dinner, and in the course of
his ramblings dropped into the Cafe Roy
al, on the corner of Market and Fourth
streets. Dunsmuir was aware of the rep
utation of the place, but had a natural
curiosity to see the victims engaged in
their efforts to lure fortune to their s\d<>.
He became interested in the game and
when invited to take a hand was not loth
to do- so.
Two wily bunko men were given the
"Up" that a rich stranger was in their
midst and a plan was made to deprive
him of hit money. Dunsmuir was piled
with liquor that was "doped" and was
soon playing with a recklessness that
could only end in loss. "Pat" hands were
dealt to him and he won. When ths
stakes were large enough the schemers
would deal themselves high hands and
gather in his money.
The bunko men did not allow him to
leave the place until he was completely
shorn. He returned to his hotel in a
dream. The fact that he had been "shak
en down" did not dawn upon him until
yesterday morning. He remembered that
he had left the Palace with $1000 in gold
and $8000 in checks. A search of his pocx
ets failed to reyeal the small sized for
tune. Dunsmuir immediately stopped
payment of the checks at the bank and
then notified the police. Detectives were
detailed to find tile two men, and within
a few hours they were taken to the Hall
of Justice. They were forced to return
their ill-gotten wealth. Dunsmuir gained
possession of his checks and most of his
gold. He was glad to get his money back
and declined to prosecute the men. The
two card sharpers were allowed to de
part, but were ordered to leave town
within twenty-four hours.

UNHAPPY WIVES
SEEK DIVORCES
John Donnigan, Known
as Lee Johnson, Song
Writer, Is Sued.
John Donnigan, musician, better known
as Lee Johnson, song writer, was made
defendant in a suit for divorce yesterday
by Nellie A. Donnigan, to whem. he was
married In February, 1892. His wife alleges
that since the marriage her husband has
treated her in a cruel and inhuman man
ner.
Mrs. Donnigan alleges that the month
following the marriage her husband
slapped her violently on the face, and
that in the month of April, 1892, he fre
quently came home under the influence of
liquor, and on numerous occasions while
in that state applied vile and abusive lan
guage to her, and struck her. Once, she
alleges, when her husband was about to
leave for Santa Cruz, he removed all the
food from the house and the oil from the
lamps. On another occasion at 1136 Oak
street he pursued her about the house
with a razor, threatening to kill her, she
avers.
The Donnigans have one child. Mrs.
Donnigan is at present living with her
mother, with whom she has been stay
ing since August last.
Mrs. Cross Wishes to Be Single.
The angel of peace, supposed to be hov
ering over the home of George H. and Lo
retta Cross, whose marriage last July
caused quite a stir, owing to the fact that
the groom was an unwilling party, has
evidently taken flight, for Mrs. Cross is
suing her husband for divorce for cruelty..
The complaint was tiled yesterday and
contains a recital of many mean things
alleged to have been done by Cross.
Cross applied to the Superior Court for
an annullment of the bonds of matricony
about two months ago. He claimed he
was forced into the marriage by his wife'a
brothers and sisters and a policeman,
who, he claimed, threatened to do him
bodily harm unless ho made the girl lvs
wife.
The ties wers ngt severed, however. Th*
young couple met ags-n and reconciliation
followed. Cross shed copious teara ancl
promised to be good, and Mrs. Cross
tainted in his arms.
Mrs. Cross alleges that her husband on
the night of the marriage left her to the
care of her sister and went to keep an en
gagement with some women to whom he
telephoned In her presence. She further
alleges that whon her baby was born he
refused to take any interest in the child
and advised her to "give it away."
