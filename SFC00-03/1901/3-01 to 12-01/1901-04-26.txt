The entire programme as at present
formulated is >as follows:'..-. ....... â¢- -
The President and' party' will arrive at
the Hotel del Monte at, 2. a: m. . on Satur
day, May 11, and will remain in their
special train until after. breakfast. At 10
o'clock the party will -be. driven around
the famous seventeen-mile drive in six
in-hand tally-ho coaches and will be re
ceived on the way in Monterey and Pa
cific Grove by the reception committee of
citizens of the two < towns. '\ About 1000
school children will throw flowers in, the
streets over which, the Presidential party
passes. Returning to Del Monte tfhe party
will have luncheon about 2 p. m. , At 3
o'clock Troop C, N. G. C, a committee
of grand officers of 'the G. A. R., the
Supervisors of Monterey County and the
Mayors and Common- Councils of Monte
rey and Pacific Grove Will wait upon the
President to escort him to Pacific Grove,
where he will meet the veterans of the
G. A. R. in closed session. At 4 p. m. the
session will adjourn and tjie President
will ascend the platform of the floral pa
vilion and speak very briefly to the as
sembled multitude, after which he re
turn to the Hotel del Monte. Â¦
If the President attends church on Sun-
WHEN President McKinley visits
the Union Ironworks to witness
the launching of the battleship
which Is destined to bear the
name of liU native State he will
receive from the hands of the
workingmeh a magnificent ftsti
rnonial of their esteem". It will be a gold
plate of Invitation to the launching. of
the Ohio. So quietly did the. employes of
the institution whicJi sent forth the Ore-
Kon arrange their plans for presenting to
the head of the nation a memorial worthy
of preservation that not even their em
ployer was aware of their intentions.
When the President reaches the Iron
works* wharf, on . the morning of the
launching he will be met by a deputation
of the workingmen and escorted , through
a column of men standing four deep 1000
feet in length to a platform erected for
the occasion, where., the presentation
speech will be delivered' and the token
presented. The iron workers will have
entire charge of the ceremony and the
orator who will make the presentation
will be chosen from their number.
The plate, which is being made; at
Shreve's from plans drawn by a commit
tee from the workers ' themselves, will
when completed be a truly magnificent
affair. It will cost eldse ; to $500 and
will be composed almost entirely of Cali
fornia gold. It was at first Intended to
have it set with diamonds, -but as dia
monds are not a production of the Golden
West they were excluded from the design.
The plate is surmounted by a golden
eagle, flanked by the national. emblem and
the bear flag of California. In one cor
ner is the shield of this State and in the
other that of Ohio. Occupying the central
position is a representation of the battle
ship Ohio guarding the Golden Gate. Sh3
is lying between LJme Point and Fort
Point, both of which are shown in the en
graving.
His Majesty's ship Condor Is now on
her way up the coast from Valparaiso
and she will be in the harbor here during
the week of the President's stay in San
Francisco. It is probable that her ofllcers
will be given a place in some of the pub-
He functions of that week. The Condor
was Lord' Charles Beresford'sship at the
bombardment of Alexandria, and in that
engagement she earned the praise of the
admiral in command by the splendid work
which she did.
It has been decided definitely that the
citizens' banquet will be held in the ladies'
grillroom in the Palace Hotel. A. A. "Wat
kins, chairman of the banquet committee,
called a meeting of the committee yester
day afternoon and the result was the de
i-fsion mentioned.
The question has been hanging fire for
eo long that it was blocking the progress
of the other arrangements and it was
found necessary to arrive at some conclu
sion without further delay. The grill
room will seat four hundred and fifty
and the question to be considered was
whether that number would be sufficient
to include all who would wish to come at
$20 a plate. Acceptances came In with
such rapidity at first that it was thought
four hundred and fifty would soon be
reached, but the committee finally decid
ed that number would be large enough tor
any banquet and so chose the Palace la
dies' grillroom as the place.
The other arrangements of the banquet
will progress rapidly now that the place
has been decided upon.
Through the general plan of welcome
and entertainment for the President and
his party is being woven a series of lesser
entertainments to Individuals of the party,
to members of the Ohio delegation and
to distinguished visitors, from other States
who will be present during the time of
festivity. Twenty-two Congressmen from
Ohio are expected to come "West with
Governor Nash, and these will be enter
tained by the Union League With Gover
nor Nash and his staff and the Governors
of Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah
and Colorado, who will be here. In fact
the Union League vrill keep open house
for the whole week of the President's
visit and every night some distinguished
cuest will be enteitained. The League
has issued the following announcement
of its banquet;
Dear Sir: The Union Leasrue Club will en

LONDON, April 25.â Jack Roberts, who
was pitted against Billy Smith in the fight
before the National Sporting Club Mon
day that resulted in Smith's death, and
Bethusen, manager of the ; club, together
with the referee, timekeeper and four sec
onds, were arraigned in the Bow-street
Police Court to-day on the charge of man
slaughter. The magistrate remanded the
accused on their own recognizances in
Â£100 each.
Nat Smith, brother of Billy Smith, said
to a representative of the Associated
Press to-night:
"The National Sporting Club Is deter
mined, if possible, to secure an autopsy,
for we are sure that apoplexy was not the
cause of death. It is certain that my
brother was given something to drink at
the end of the seventh round, and after
that he was utterly useless. He had the
fight won when he began to stagger about
the ring and fell unconscious. He never
got up again. It is a. difficult matter to
prove, as everybody has been interested
in hushing up the scandal, but I shall
have my say at the inquest, if ft. is pos
fcibie."

MANILA, April 25.â It is reported that
the rebel general Cailles ordered eight
American soldiers to \ be shot April 21,
the same day on which he condemned to
death Colonel Sanchio, one of his staff
officers, and Senor de la Rosa, a weal
thy native who had refused to contri
bute to the Insurgent fund.- Sanchio es
caped. The others were tortured and
then butchered.
Cailles, who is now lurking In the
mountains of Tayabas province, Luzon,
proclaims himself dictator and successor,
of Aguinaldo, and announces his inten
tion to continue a war of extermination.
It Is said Cailles was born In Pondi
cherry, India, his father being a French
man and his mother a Hindoo. It Is also
asserted that he formerly registered asÂ«
a French subject in Manila, He is a typi
cal guerrilla leader, cruel, able, reckless
and unrelenting. v ' . ':.; Â¦
Aguinaldo denources him, disclaiming
responsibility for the previous atrocities
of Cailles, and declares that he never
issued orders contrary to the rules of
war..
Captain James H. McRae, with Com
panies G and P of the Third Infantry

desired through them to extend his kind
est wishes to the people of the Island.
He said that his interest in Cuba always
had been great and he made reference to
messages sent to Congress concerning the
island. Its welfare always would be the
subject of his most earnest consideration
He congratulated the members of the del
egation upon being members of the Cu
ban constitutional convention. He said it
was a high honor, and it fell to the lot
of but few men to have the opportunity to
frame a government for a republic Con
cerning the object of the delegates' visit
the President said he would confer with
the Secretary, of War and the Secretary
having an intimate knowledge of the sit
uation, would confer with the delegation.
"WASHINGTON. April 25.â The Cuban
delegation from the convention framing
a constitution for the new island repub
lic saw President McKinley twice to-day,
once in the early part of the day, when
there were expressions of friendship, and
again at night, when the members of the
delegation were the guests of honor at a
state dinner at the White House. The
real business which brought the delega
tion here was not transacted, the Presi
dent in the forenoon interview at the
White House ' saying to the delegates
that he would confer with the Secretary
of War who would act as his representa
tive In conferences over the Cuban situa
tion. The delegation and -Secretary Root
were closeted for some hours in the after
noon in a discussion of the relations of
the islands to the United States.' Secrecy
was observed as to the conference, the
statement being made that after results
were reached some news as to the con
clusions might be made public >
Matters of importance were not touched
upon in the interview between the Presi
dent and the delegates, the convention be
ing almost wholly informal. Senor Ca
pote, in his address to the President,
Epoke of the desire of the Cubans to have
the closest possible relations with the
United States. He said that the United
States soldiers and Cubans had fought
side by side and driven Spain from the
island, and the ties between the two
countries were bound in blood. The re
lationship, therefore, between the coun
tries always should be most amicable, and
closer than that which usually exists be
tween nations. He also spoke of the grat
itude which Cuba felt for the United
States for the assistance rendered in her
liberation. "

THE PRESIDENT
Not Subject to Selection.
The act of 1S97 describes land which may be
selected under its provisions as "vacant land
open to settlement." To be vacant land must
be unoccupied. To be open for settlement land
must, among other things, not to' be known to
crntaiin valuable mineral deposits. Land which
Is occupied by another or . which is known to
contain valuable mineral deposits is therefore
not subject to selection under said act. It is
the general rule that applicants for public land
must show that the land applied for Is of the
character contemplated by the law under which
it is sought. There is no reason why this rule
should not obtain in proceedings under the act
of 1S97. and there is nothing in that act itself
relieving the applicant thereunder from making
such showing. As has been said in various
decisions of the department this law consti
tutes a standing offer on the part of the Gov
ernment for the exchange of lands. In this
offer the lands to be exchanged are described.
Those to be relinquished by a individual must
be within a forest reservation, and those *to
be taken by him must be vacant and open to
settlement. It is incumbent upon one who
wishes to take advantage of this standing oiler
to bring himself within the terms thereof, not
only as to the land he proposes to relinquish,
but also as to that which he proposes to take
in exchange. It is. his duty to Inform himself
as to the character and condition of the land
he proposes to select and to honestly . disclose
the facts thus ascertained. Â¦ â¢
In bo far as existing conditions appear from
Land Orfice records, that is, whether a se
lected tract Is of lands to which settlement
laws have been extended and whether the same
is free from record appropriation, claim or
reservation, no showing by the selector in re
spect thereto need be made, for the reason that
officers of the Government can and must take
notice of public records. But as to conditions
In existence, or the non-existence of which
cannot be determined by anything appearing
upon the public records and as to which officers
of the Government must depend entirely upon
outside evidence, that is. whether a selected
tract Is occupied by others and known to be
valuable for minerals, it is manifestly neces
sary that required evidence should be furnished
by the selector. Officers of the Government
cannot be expected to know -whether the land
selected under the act Is vacant and not known
to be valuable for minerals, and in these re
spects subject to selection.
Must Submit Proof With Filing.
Such expectation would be impossible of
realization. For instance, the Visalia land
district, in which the lands in controversy are
situated, comprises the greater portion of the
mining counties of California and embraces i
an area of over 7,000,000 acres. Of this area j
over 500,000 acres of unreserved surveyed public I
mined by conditions existing at the time when
all requirements necessary to obtaining title
have been compiled with by the selector, and
no change in such conditions, subsequently oc
curring, can affect his rights. That the ad
ministration of the act in question falls within
the jurisdiction of the Land Department there
can be no doubt. (Bishop of Nesqually vs.
Gibbon, 158 U. S-, 155, 167.) Selections under
the act are therefore subject to examination
by officers of the Land Department at any
time up to the issue of the patent. This ex
amination is had for the purpose of ascertain
ing: and declaring- whether or not the selector,
by compliance with all necessary requisites,
has entitled himself to a patent, and not for
the purpose of determining whether or not
these officers will consent to the selection. If
examination, whether had at the instance of
third parties claiming against the selections of
ex-parte proceedings, discloses that the selector
has fully compiled with all the necessary re
quisites and has honestly and correctly dis
closed, title to the land relinquished and th-i
condition and character of land selected, and
that the records of the Land Department dis
close no obstacle to relinquish or selection,
trie duty of the land officers is clearâ they must
patent the land to the selector and they have
no discretion to do otherwise. The rights of
the selector, however, attach and take effect
at the point of time when he has done all that
is incumbent upon him to do in the premises
and are not postponed tdthe time when that
fact is ascertained and declared by the land
officers.

ALLIED TROOPS
ARE CALLED IN
Clarke appealed to the Secretary of the
Interior in each case and it is upon these
appeals that decisions are now rendered.
Jn oral arguments recently made and in
papers which have been recently filed it
is, admitted by opposing claimants in each
case that mining developments upon the
lands in controversy have now been car
ried to the extent which has developed
beyond question that the lands are of
Rreat value for their ell deposits and that
tlie mineral claimants are in actual pos-'
session of them and daily extracting- large
quantities of oil. Many similar cases are
pending In the General Land Office, and
by common consent among the various
claimants the two cases 'decided to-day
were made test cases. In the decision, it
is held:
Points of the Decision.
Firstâ That where a person making: a selec
tion under the act of June 4, 1S97, has com
piled with all the terms and conditions neces
Â«ut to entitle him to a patent to selected lands
h<Â« acquires vested interest therein and is to be
regarded as the equitable owner thereof.
Second â That the right to patent under the
â¢ct, one* vested, is. for most purposes, equiva
lent of a patent issued, and when in fact Is
sued the patent dates back to the time when
â¢the right to it became fixed and takes effect
as of that date.
Thirdâ That questions respecting- class and
character of selected lands are to be deter-
In the other case a forest reserve selec
tion was made by Clarke December 14,
3FS9, and was accompanied by proof that
the land selected was then non-mineral
in character, but was not accompanied by
any proof of its non-occupancy. No sub
sequent proofs were made by Clarke re
specting- the condition or character of the
land in either case. The oil companies
respectively filed a protest against
Clarke's selections, alleging that at the
time of selection land was occupted
and known to be valuable for its deposits
of mineral oil. The Commissioner of the
General Land Office a few months since
took up these selections and protests and
directed that a hearing be had thereon to
determine the condition and character of
the land selected, and In the course of his
decision held that in determining- the
character of the land discoveries of oil
made subsequent to the date of selections
could be considered.
The Secretary's decision holds that
Clarke had no title to the lands first re
linquished and that ins rights, if any, in
thatt-case are -wholly dependent upon the
second selection. With the first selection
Clarke filed proof to the effect that the
lands selected were unoccupied, non
mlnerai and otherwise subject to settle
ment. Ko proof showing non-occupancy
and the non-mineral character of the land
was filed with the second selection.
Bights of the Claimants.
C. W. Clarke is a forest lieu land se
lector in each case, and the Kern Oil Com
pany Is a mineral claimant in one case
and the Gray Eagle Oil Company In ths
other. In one case Clarke made a lieu
land selection December 8, 1899, basins the
selection upon the rtlinqulshment of land.s
to which he claimed to have obtained
title from the State of California. 'Janu
ary 13, 1900, he again selected the same
iands. basing the selection Upon the re
linquishment of otht,r lands.
-âALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET,
/[* N- TV., WASHINGTON, April 23.
(I The two oil land cases from the
V^Â»7 Kern River oil district, which
have attracted great attention in
California, were deciJed to-day by Secre
tary of the Interior- Hitchcock. Under
â¢public land laws oil as found in the earth
is a mineral and oil lands are subject to
location and acquisition under the mining
laws. This contest has been between
mineral claimants, who assert a right to
the lands under the placer mining law,
and forest reserve lieu land claimants,
who claimed title under forest reserve
Uen selections made under the act of Con-
BreES of June 4. 18y4. This act provides
t hat owners of titled land within a forest
reserve may surrender such lands to the
United States and select in its place an
â¢ qual quantity of "vacant public land
Â«-5w?n to settlement." The purpose of this
provision Js twofold: First, to enable
those whose lands are placed in a state
of isolation by reason of their being en
tirely surrounded by a forest reservation,
to better their situation by taking lands
in some other part of the public domain,
where they will have advantages conse
quent upon increasing settlement and de
velopment of the country. Second, to en
able the Government to acquire exclusive
ownership and control of all lands within
reservations so as to more effectively pre
serve timber against injury by fire and
depredation and to better protect and
maintain sources of water supply, which
are essential to the utilization of lands
in arid and semi-arid regions.
It is thus made evident that these lands
are not now subject to selection in lieu
of lands In the forest reservation and that
further delay in the disposition of these
selections to afford an opportunity' to file
an affidavit showing- that they are vacant
and open to settlement would be of no
benefit to the \ selector, i Each decision
holds, therefore, that the forest reserve
lieu land selector has never perfected his
selection and that the lands now being
admitted to be of great mineral value he
cannot be permitted to perfect selections
because to do so would be to permit the
selection of mineral lands. The selections
are accordingly rejected. " ,
Ordinarily, as between the Government and
selector there would seem to be no good
ground for refusing to permit him to submit
the necessary .proof at a time subsequent to
the date of the attempted selection, but since
this proof is essential to complete selection
so as to constitute a contract fully executed
on the selector's part his rights would have
to be determined as of date when the selection
is thus completed. . No attempt or offer to
cure the defect and complete selections In ques
tion has been made, and it Is now asserted by
mineral claimants and fully admitted by the
relector that, the land in question has been
demonstrated to contain valuable deposits of
petroleum.
Not Properly Lieu Lands.
The necessity for requiring the selector to
make proof of the condition and character- of
the land at the time of selection is forcibly
Illustrated In this case. Prior to that time
mineral oil had been discovered In the near vi
cinity of this land, and lands in that neigh
borhood were generally prospected and explor
ed in an effort to find mineral oil therein in
paying quantity. To that end wells were be
ing drilled or bored hundreds of feet into the
earth at great cost, and in this manner the
area or extent of the oil deposit was being
ascertained and the mineral character of spe
cific tracts made known. The known character
of the land in that vicinity was therefore un
dergoing a change and tracts not known to
contain mineral deposits at any given time
were liable within thirty days thereafter to
become known to be valuable for such depos
its. The right to patent Is not acquired In
any case until the proofs are such that a
patent could be Issued upon them if nothing
were shown to the contrary. As, long as any
thing remains undone which- it is essential
should be done by the selector in order to en
title him to a patent right thereto, the title
does not vest. That a non-mineral' affidavit
should accompany the selection Is -not serious
ly questioned by the applicant. It is just as
essential that it should be accompanied by a
vacancy or non-occupied affidavit. Appellants'
contention that the word "vacant' ' as used
in the statute means public lands which are
not shown by the records of the local office or
General Land Office to be claimed, appropri
ated orÂ«reserved, can not be accepted. .Por
tions of public lands may be occupied, and
for that reason be not subject to selection,
and yet there be no mention of their occu
pancy In 'the records of the land department
It frequently occurs that persons desiring to
secure title to lands under the homestead law
settle upon and ocupy the same for months
and even years before placing their claims on
record. The proof presented by the selector
did not show that the < land was subject to
selection and would not justify the issuance
of a patent even If no protests had been filed.
land, scattered throughout the district, were
undisposed of at the end of the fiscal year
during which the selections In question were
filed. In these respects the Visalia district
does not greatly differ from many other land
districts wherein selections under the act of
1897 have been, or are likely to be made. Ob
viously, therefore. It could not have been
contemplated that the local officers of the
various land districts should or could, from
personal knowledge', determine the physical
conditions pertaining to the lands selected
under the said act. The argument Is Intensi
fied when applied to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office and the Secretary of the
Interior. In this case the lands were sur
veyed In 1854. Whether since that date they
have been continuously or at any. time vacant,
or occupied and whether at any time known
to be valuable for minerals, and if so, whether
stripped of their minerals and worked out,
are matters not shown by land office records.
Every consideration based upon the wise ad
ministration of this law supports the wisdom
of the regulation requiring the selector to
submit proof showing the land selected to be
subject to such selection. The form of ap
plication prepared by the Commissioner's of
fice for selections of lands In . lieu of tracts
covered by patent in forest '-, reserve and spe
cifically adopted as form 4-643 in the regulations
of May 9. 1S99, and Decemberil8. 1899, requires
the selector to accompany his application with
"affidavit showing land selected . to be non
mineral in character and unoccupied." It la
thus clearly made Incumbent- upon one seeking
to take advantage of the offer made by tills
law to establish the fact that the land he se
lects is of the character contemplated by law
Until this fact is established his proffer of
exchange Is not completed. Until then he has
not made out a case which shows upon the
face of the papers that he ha* so far com
piled with the conditions of the act of 1837
as to convert the offer of exchange contained
in said act into a contract fully executed upon
his part. To lodge in an applicant for ex
change of lands under this law vested right
as against the ownership of a third party, it
must be made to appear that the land sought
to be acquired by him is of the character con
templated by that law. ,

Crazed Machinist .At
tempts to Murder
- -Â¦ His "Wife.'- /, ,
George Tandy, a machinist, was booked
at the City Prison yesterday on a warrant
charging him with threats to kill. The
complaining witness is his wife, Annie
Tandy, who lives at 112 Taylor street. The
warrant was sworn to before Judge Mo
gan, who fixed Tandy's. bonds at $3000.
Tandy is 47 years of age and he and his
wife have been living apart for the last
eighteen years. Shortly after they were
married the wife discovered that her hus
band was a victim to the opium habit rrnd
she did everything in her power to cure
him,', but failed, and finally she decided
that the. best thing they could do was to
separate. Â¦
Tandy during all these years strove
hard to cure himself of the habit and
about a month ago he called upon his
wife in her room at 112 Tajjlor street and
gladdened her heart by telling her that
he had effected a permanent cure. They
agreed to live together again and until
Tuesday night they were very happy.
That night Tandy- came home and Mrs.
Tandy saw at once that something was
wrong. Without the slightest provocation
her husband grasped her by the throat
and threw her down. â¢ He commenced
choking her and she ; managed. to utter a
piercing spream, which brought assistance
and Tandy was dragged away just as she
was getting black in the face.
The crazed machinist seemed to recover
himself and with tears in his eyes begged
his wife's forgiveness. He said he had
been induced to use the drug, but prom
ised, faithfully not to do so again. She
forgave him. Wednesday night he again
seized her by the throat and said he was
going to murder her. After a desperate
struggle "she managed to break' away
from him and rushed out of the house.
She met Policeman Coleman, who placed
Tandy under arrest and yesterday Mrs.
Tandy swore to the warrant.
Â¦ Tandy presented a sorry spectacle in the
prison. He shows the effects of the drug,
which has "made him almost a physical
wreck. .

OSCAR GARDNER AS HE APPEARS WHILE BOXING IN HIS TRAINING
QUARTERS AT CROLL'S GARDENS, ALAMEDA. HE IS CONFIDENT
THAT McGO.VERN.WILL HAVE NO EASY TIME TUESDAY NIGHT.
TERRY McGOVERN has done with
the heavy part of his training.
When he finished yesterday after
noon his bout with â¢ Dougherty,
whom he took on after he went
three fast rounds with Jimmy Britt, the
133-pound amateur champion of the co'asL
Mt-Govern announced that a tapering- pr<*
cess of training -would thenceforth be
adopted until he stepped into the ring
next Tuesday night; ' â¢
Crowds of eag-er onlookers gather at
the . Terminal these afternoons. They
swarm in the, hallways and congest the
approaches to the small gymnasium at
tachment of the resort. Only the favored
can pass the door which screens the little
champion from the view of the outsiders,
but the favored yesterday were more
than ten men could count on their fingers.
It was noised about that Jimmy Britt
was to be tried out by the champion.
That was enough for the . curious, who
flocked to the end of Haigrht street in
great numbers.
Some souvenir collector had purloined
McCJovern's regrular sparring- gloves, and
as there were none other in the quarters
hut a set of five-ounce liphtinpr mitts the
Terrible and the Pride of Eighth and Mar
ket streets had their three rounds out
with these small list coverings. Britt
was willing:. He came prepared for a ten
seconds' sojourn in enforced forg-etful
ness. so he did not cavil over the size of
the gloves.

Indoor Tennis Finals.
LONDON, April 25â In the final round
of the lawn tennis, covered court, amateur
championship games to-day H. I. Doherr.y
beat G. Simond by 3 to 0. . . ' . . *
he boxed three rounds with the unbeaten,
human flstic whirlwind. The amateur
came away with somethingâ something of
which he is proud and' which he wishes
he could retain as a memento, if it were
possible to divorce it from his face. Un
der the right eye is a patch of color, black
and yellow. . , '
"Oh, that's nothing," said Jimmy;
"think who srave it to me."
Britt boxed, exceedingly well with Mc-
Govern, who did not let himself out, al
though he was earnest and working all
the time. The two were at it from the
start and at the call of time when each
round ended were pummeling each other
with more than playful punches. Britt's
earnestness forced the same attitude on
the part of Terry and the two boxed the
best bout so far seen at the McGovern
training quarters.
Terry's work yesterday consisted of the
usual morning spin through the park and
the afternoon spell in the gymnasium.
He is Â¦ In perfect trim; weighing 123%
pounds.
At Croll's Gardens, Alameda, Oscar
Oaklands 7, San Franciscos 1.
In the ninth inning of the game yester
day the stalwart stickers "of Hanxville
made a run. This was the only blot on
an otherwise clean and tallyless sheet.
Babbitt, who occupied the slab for the
Dudes, was an intricate and involved
puzzle for the Wasps, who neither
bunched or scattered hits with any pre
cision or success.
Whalen on the other hand was touched
for many long hits, especially in the sev
enth inning-, when five special pieces of
fireworks were exploded for the occasion.
In the fourth inning, with all the sacks
occupied, Whalen did a walk-giving atunt
irom which two runs resulted.. â¢
_ The wind and dust had things their own
blowy, dirty way and ruined what gave
promise of being a very fast game. It was
nke the Sahara let loose in a wind storm.

Senators Give Doyle a Very Poor
SACRAMENTO, April . 25.â Aided by a
basketful of errors on the part of the
Senators, a few scattered hits and almost
errorless play on thefr part, the Los An
geles Giants defeated the Sacramento ag
gregation this afternoon by a score of
7 to 4. Doyle, for the home team,
pitched well enough to win any game of
ball, but hi$ support was bad, and .'n

EMPTY FEELING AMONG BETTORS
Dr. Cave Drops In Unexpectedly Again at
20 to i âScotch Plaid Easily Subdues
Gotobedâ Well-Played Outsiders Land
BY F. E. MTJLHOLLA2TD.
R, CAVE, the bay horse owned by
Martin & Patton. treated his
patients to a genuine surprise at
Tanforan yesterday by making
an unexpected call with the
books laying 20 to 1 about him. The
previous time the Doctor appeared in pub
lic he was not feeling at all well, but this
indisposition can be excused from the
fact that he was asked to debate with
some very learned ones in the science of
speed. With Bassinger at the. throttle,
he made no stops, winning the fifth selec
tion, over , six furlongs, all the way. At
his head was Prejudice, and then a neck
further off came -the 2 to 5 favorite The
Pride. * When Starter Jake Holtman re
leased the bÂ£$rier Turner must have
thought there! would be a recall, for he
started to take up," getting a poor start.
It was a severe blow to the "wall-paper"
speculators, who backed the. favorite as
if it were, stealing something. .
This was not the only smash up the talent
got mixed up in during the afternoon s
exercises. â¢â¢ At stated intervals Mission
dropped in, quoted at 6; Louwelsea was
given a nose decision over Divina, with 10
to 1 listed all about the. ring, and Foul
Play made a successful parachute leap
with 8 to 1 going begging. Illilouon and
Scotch Plaid saved the favorite followers.
Certainly not on his recent races, the
Elmwood Farm's Illilouon, with Ransch
up, .was made favorite for the opening
sprint and came home by himself. Some
few of the books laid 7 to 1 before they
grew wise to the fact that the gelding
was the hot one. Matilda O, a 50 to 1 shot,
beat George Dewey a head for the place.
It was whispered around in select so
ciety circles that Mission was "the goods"
for the six and one- half furlong number
following, and considerable coin went into
the books at odds of 5 and 6 to 1. Never
worse than second during the running, he
took the lead from Glissando below the
paddock, winning handily. A sixteenth
from the stand Jack Martin rushed The
Singer through a knothole, and nearly
putting Ransch on Glissando over the
fence, secured . place honors from Mc-
Albert in a drive.
Jockey John Sullivan, whose name was
on the suspended list for a long period,
had the mount on Louwelsea in the two
year-old event at four and a half furlongs,
and in a hard drive got the verdict over
Divina by a nose. The winner went into
the starter's hands at odds of 10 to 1, and
though tiring perceptibly, Sullivan out
rode Hafley. Ogle went to pieces after
leading into the stretch. Turner on Hain
ault met with some interference just
after the barrier was released, which
seemed to knock all run out of the
youngster.
Scotch Plaid, from the Burns & Water
housf stable, added another to his string
of wjns by taking the mile and a quarter
run very handily from Gotobed. A 9 to 20
chance. Plaid led from the start, while
Fauntleroy moved late with Gotobed, los
ing out; by two .lengths in 2:10. Sunello
nosed out The Bobby for third position.
Â¦ A day dream indulged in by "Chub"
Russell cost Montallade the last purse.
The latter horse had the race won after
racing Wallenstein to a standstill and his
backers started to get in line. Russell
then began slowing down, when E.
Matthews skimmed along irom far back
with F"oul PMay, an 8 to 1 shot, winning
by a head. Bogus Bill apparently found
the track too hard, finishing back in the
bunch. . .
Track Notes.
To-Day's Entries.
Advices from Phoenix, Ariz., say the
condition of Jockey Dick Clawson is about
the same as J. McDonald, another Cali
fornia rider, suffering from tuberculosis.
When McDonald left here a fortnight or
so back he seemed to be in*no immediate
danger and both boys may eventually
recover good health.
Jqckey Ben Gouin was given ten days
on the ground by Starter Holtman last
Tuesday. Gouln has concluded that he
does not stand, well here and will leave for
Chicago Saturday.
Mission, winner of the second race and
trained by "Doc" Robbins. -was bid up
$300 over his entered price of J200 by Billy
Ma^rrane. The. last named horseman's
gelding. The Singer, finished second.
The stable of Sam Hildreth will be
shipped Bast to-morrow.
Jack Martin on The Singer tried a flying
wedge in the second event and was again
cautioned for rough riding by the Judges.
Mike Hennessy in his palmy days could
not hold a candle for Jack to read by.
Manager Ed Laurence of the Montana
Jockey Club left for home last evening,
well satisfied with his California pilgrim
age. He predicts a great seasons sport
in the Copper State.
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber departs
for St. Louis to-morrow. He may sell
Corrigan before leaving, but if not, Felix
Carr will take the brown colt East. Felix
has met with such marked success hand
ling the Sphrelber horse3 that Barney now
thinks hts ex-Jockey will become a star
trainer.

to death. I therefore gave one horse
to the American Minister, another
to the secretary of the American L;
gation, and a horse, a mule and a
cart to Sir Robert Hart, head of th?
Chinese customs. Subsequently Sir
Robert returned the cart and mule,
the horse having died. I gave a horse
to Dr. Morrison, correspondent of the
London Times, one horse to Dr.
Velde of the German Legation and
two horses to Professor von Broyn of
the Imperial University. They were
glad to accept the animals and we
were glad to get rid of them."
"The only food in the Prince's place was
a little rice. We decided to sell the
clothing and curios found upon the prem
ises and realized $2500 in gold. They were
bought by British and American officers
at a private sale of two weeks' duration.
' "Native Christians brought us furs
and sables which they had purchased
at a low price' from wealthy Chinese,
who feared they ; might be looked by
the military, people ;and who were
willing 1 to dispose of them for a little
money.' These articles were sold at
our place to British and other officers.
I considered that that was a fair,
honest speculation, which injured no
body and that benefited many people.
I asked Mr. Conger on the way over
here if he, deep down in his hear?,
had anything to criticize the mission
aries for, and he said: 'I have noth
ing to say, but if I had anything t^
criticize it would be as to allowing
the natives to bring in this stuff an-I
sell it.'
"There may have been some looted
goods taken, but it was without my
knowledge. The Russians and Sikh
soldiers were selling off truck very
cheap, but my people did not do ths
looting.
; "The help which the sale of the?3
purchased articles rendered was to
put half- a 'dozen men of the church
upon their feet." Â¦
"We did not sell any provisions. I jrot
flour from a Chinese shop without payins
for it at the time, for we did not have a
dollar, but I afterward recouped tin*
owner for it, and he is to-day one of our
best friends. The one-third indemnity
proposition was never enforced. We
considered it aa an act of friendliness on
the part of the people who paid it. The
thing was initiated by Chang Yen Mao. a
commissioner appointed by LI Hunsr
Chang, to see to the settlement of claim*
of native Christiana and to settle the
claims of foreism missionaries as well.
As the Romaji Catholic claims were so
large, he limited himself to the claims r>f
native Christians only, and suggested
that the people who injured the Christians
should make reparation; that the house
of the Christian burned or otherwise de
stroyed should be rebuilt and that the
furniture, grain and the animals should
be restored. . We added one-third for the
support of the women and children and
poor people, who had no property and had
no indemnity coming to them and whose
bread-winners had been killed. The aver
age sum whjch we secured would be about
300 taels, or $200 gold, as a permanent
fund for the support of a family.*.*

GREAT RECEPTION
AT'DES'MOiNES
Regarding the reported outrages com
mitted by- the allied troops on the march
from the coast of China- to Peking, Min
ister Conger said: . â¢ ._
"There is no foundation for such reports.
It is not- true that men, women and chil
dren, were ma/isacred by the foreign sol
diers on the inarch: to. Peking. I do not
doubt that ''there were individual acts
of Â¦brutality committed, but it was impos
sible for the officers of the various nations
to prevent them. A few soldiers may have
been sent foraging in various directions,
and some of the men may have committed
crimes. To- hold the officers or nations
responsible for these acts Is unfair.
"War is terrible-Â»in all its details, and
history shows that the Innocent often
must suffer with the guilty. It was im
possible to discover whether every Chi
nese had a rifle In his possession or had
taken part in the Boxer outrages, or if a
village, destroyed by order, may have
contained innocent people.' The presence
of Boxers warranted the destruction of
the villages. One must remember that the
soldiers knew that 40.000 Chinese Chris
tians had been slaughtered by the Boxers
and more than 100 white missionaries had
met terrible deaths at their hands. Is it
to be wondered at that individual acts of
reprisal were,' made? The stories of
slaughter- are" grossly ' exaggerated, and
nothing of the kind was ordered or
planned by commanding officers." â¢
Minister - Conger stated that the resl
dents'of Peking seemefl to be -resigned to
the occupation of- the' city by the allied
troops, and he ridiculed the reports of an
other Boxer uprising being Imminent.
Regarding the Indemnity to be paid by
China, Minister Conger - stated that the
country would be able to 'pay $300,000,000
without being crippled. ' . . â¢ '

the Minister's reception. Special trains
will be run to Council Bluffs and hun
dreds of people will go. " Among them
will be Governor Shaw and other State
officers, as well as prominent men from
all over the State. For the first time in
the history of the State the Capitol has
been secured for the public reception. It
will be given under the auspices of the
Conger reception committee, which has
been at work for several .weeks.
It is practically certain that Minister
Conger will be a candidate for Governor.
He will undoubtedly be nominated if he
is a candidate, though there may be some
slight opposition.

Notice Is hereby given that a email capsized

up tr.d down San Francitco Bay, between Mis-
Army Transport Grant Is Hurrying to Manila , in Order to
Bring Home the Last Contingent of the Volunteers
Before June 30 â The Doric Sails for Japan and China
Irish, United States Naval Officer, Dep
uty Custom Surveyor St. John and a rep
resentative of The'Call.'K "
"What's the news Irom China?" asked
Mr. Conger as he leaned over the rail.
"1 have Deen away a long while and do
not know 'what has happened."
Mr. Conger' was the picture of healtii.-
His face .was bronzed irom exposure to
the wind and sun, and as he stood on the
deck of the steamer; his strong figure en
veloped in a heavy overcoat ana a cap
on his head, -he looked more like a sturdy
sea captain of the olden time than the
cool, clear-headed diplomat that he has
shown himself to be.
"At the time I left China," Mr. Conger
said, "there was fear of serious trouble
between Russia and Japan, and things
were looking very black indeed. I left
six weeks ago, and at that time no.defin
ito demand had been made upon China
by America or the other powers as to
/the payment of air indemnity for war.ex
penses. The first thing that the repre
sentatives of the . powers agreed upon
was as to the largest amount that China
would be able to pay;, it was then pro
posed to scala down the total amount
of demands, in- excess of that, but I
could not get them to agree on that up
to the~time I.carne away. The represen
tatives of some of the powers were talk
ing of demanding the last cent. Sir Rob
ert U-art, the head of the Chinese Cus
toms, the Japanese Minister and the Eng
lish Minister proposed to the Chinese a
scheme to meet these demands, but noth
ing had been agreed upon up to the 'time
I came away. Â¦ Â¦..,'.
"Another matter was spoken of in
the event of China's refusal to meet
the demands. .It was proposed that
the powers taks possession of suffi
cient territory to offset their claims.
It has been predicted that if such a
course should be pursued ths empire
v/illgb' to pieces. In such event v the
missionary work will come to an end,
J revolutions will spring up in the va
'rious provinces against the powers
that taka possession and even against
the Chinese themselves, and that will
mean disturbance of , trade all over
the empire.'.'
Mark Twain's Criticism Unjust.
Mr. Conger was asked with reference to
the articles recently published by Mark
Twain.-.in which the missionaries- were
held responsible in a large measure for
the war and in which they were accused
of looting and'of aiding and abetting the
same. Mr. Conger replied that the mis
sionary question was one of the proposi
tions connected with the outbreak, but it
was not the immediate one. He said:
. "I have read Mark Twain's second arti
cle on the missionaries In -the- North
American Review. They have been griev
ously misrepresented from first to last.
The Americans have a larger number of
missionaries out there than any other na
tion, and I am frank to say that under
the circumstances there are very few
things which the missionaries have done,'
if any, for which there need be any apol
ogy .whatever. I do not mean to say that
the missionaries have done nothing which
upon review might have been better done
differently, but there is scarcely anything
which hag been done by them for which
they need apologize. The stories of their
looting are false, . to my â¢ knowledge.
"I would have no business or
power to authorize a missionary to
make any claim whatever, but it was
my 'business as chief officer of this
country to advise with them. Believ
ing, that our Government would not
demand a monetary indemnity Â¦ for
the murder and pillaging of native
Christians, I advised them that wher
ever they could make a settlement
themselves with the villages where
those murders or destruction of prop
erty had taken place, to make them."
"Li Hung Chang and Chang Yen Mao
suggested that settlements, might be
made in. this :.. way, .â¢ with the; least
possible friction. I said, 'If these people
are willing and ready to reimburse the
missionaries and the native Christians for
the loss of life and property, accept their,,
offer. Do it upon your own responsibility;
I take no part In it and the legation
takes no part In it.' There was no going
out and compelling the people to pay any
thing. It was altogether Voluntary on
their part. ' .
Did Not Gather Booty to Sell.
"The missionaries have been criticized
very severely for- going. Immediately after
the siege was raised, Into abandoned
houses for shelter for themselves and the
native Christians who had been expelled
from their homes. I said, 'If there' is a
Boxer's habitation' abandoned, take pos
session of it so you can have a place in
which to shelter and take care of the na
tive Christians.' The property that they
found..in those houses was sold for the
benefit of the Chinese converts. They
found immediately after the siege that the
military people were scouring the town for
every bushel of rice and everything upon
which they could sustain their armies.
They Â£ound\ their own houses burned and
their property Bone. I said, 'You should
bestir yourselves in making provision for
these people and not wait until the armies
plant themselves here and take possession
of everything.'
"On the part, of the missionaries there
was no going out to gather booty or loot
to sell, but the missionaries took posses
sion of two large places, where they
stored .what food and clothing they could
collect. Only two of .those places were
entered and those houses were abandoned
by their occupants. Â¦ It was simply a ques
tion of taking those provisions or letting
starvation stare them In the face. It was
a question of- it being looted by Chinese
or by soldiers 5n the armies. As it turned
out. however, , there was not the danger
of famine that everybody had expected at
first, because we supposed that^the arrnies
coming in would take everything in sight
to live on, and we did not realize that
there were probably 250,000 wealthy Chi
nese who had left the city who used to
buy this garden stuff and provisions and
that only 50,000 troops came in, so that
there was no scarcity of supplies. This
occupation that I speak of was immedi
ately after those people got out of the
siege. Â¦ They went to the places which had
been the headquarters of Boxers, where
the Boxers had been supported and where
they had been drilling." -
Native Christians' Good Service.
Mr. Conger spoke of the good services
which the Christian natives rendered the
besieged. He said: . . Â¦ . _ :
"It took every white man -we had to
stand by the guns. Without the mission
aries the legation would not have been
saved, and without the native Christians
none of us would have been saved. The
Christian Chinese had to come in there
and help us or die. There were a great
many. of them killed inside of our line of
defenseâ from 50 to 100 of them. Any one
of these Chinese Christians found outside
of our defenses' would have â¢ been killed
immediately by the Boxers, so that the
efforts of all the defenders were for mu
tual protection. 1 The missionaries were
not the, prime cause of the trouble; they
were only one of the causes. The mis
sionaries were not responsible for the
building of the railroads, or for any of
the other foreign Innovations against
which the hatred Of the Boxers seemed to
be directed." . ....
On beinK asked concerning the relations
between Russia â¢ and \the United States,
Mr. ; Conger replied that they were very
friendly at the time he came away'.' He
suggested that one of the issues that the
United States must provide for might be
that of the Russian occupation of Man
churia. Â¦'.<â¢. ' * â¢ .'Â¦.' .Â¦ .
"When I left Peking," added Mr.
Conger," "the powers were just then
filing their protsst against that oc
cupation. ' The -probability, is that
Russia, with. ' her large naval force
on the south and her great railroad
system going down there, will see
that her interests are, protected. Yet
she cannot make , a special arrangs
njent.with China while-China is ne
gotiating with other nations with
out in spirit violating the agreement
Â¦which she made with those other na
tions at. the commencement.. The
policy of . the United States . was fully
outlined' in the President's proclama
tion of July 3, and that policy has
been followed as closely, as "it could

PERSONAL MENTION.
WHEN Arthur Xhamb'erlairi,.. brother of the
British Colonial Secretary, obtained a verdict
in- his libel suit Against certain newspaper in
London that had charged the Secretary with sharing
'with his-brothei- in) Government contracts it was gen
erally believed the. verdict carried with' it. an acquittal
of the Secretary from* the charges, and a-condemna-'
tion of the papers. Fuller reports .from .-London,
however, put a different complexion on the verdict.
The relation of Joseph Chambeflain.-to the contracts
under .consideration, was not brought into the case.
: Arthur Chamberlain obtained >a judgment' with honri
tiai damages solely, because of misstatementf that had
been made with respect tchimsclf. r .;. ; : : .1 ' -
The Lord Chief Justice, before whom the; case, was
tried, virtually supported the claim of the defendants
on the larger issue involved; He is reported as having
said from the bench: "I do not agree with Sir Ed
.\vard Clarke's view that these .articles could not be
'iair comment,' for they were traced to Mr. Chamber
bin's declaration in the House of, Commons that he
had no" interest, 'direct or r indirect.' , I consider that
the connection of members of . the; Government with
firms which might be 'manufacturing articles for the
Government is a matter which any public writer has
a light to comment; upon. I go -quite as. far as Mr
Isaacs (attorney for the- newspapers) in regard to our
public life, and would not be limited by any company
'law or any point about being : only, a /shareholder.

The hitherto unbrave-i terrors and unbroken mys
teiy of that terrible valley are duly Munchausened and
magnified. Its deadly fumes, miasmas, malaria,
mirage and misery are dwelt upon at terrifying length.
The shrinking of large numbers of brave men from the
task of entering that region of horrors, and the de
populating effect upon fhe country around of its repu
tation for being^ the home of monslers, of poison
emitting crevasses in the' red-hot.' earth, of simoons,
cyclones, typhoons and all the terrors of the air, work
upon the taste for the terrible. Its sand storms, dust
storms, dirt storms, its showers of salt, borax, brim
tone and all that chokes, constricts, suffocates and
kills, are told about in a fashion to make the reader
sr.eeze and throw up the sash for fresh air.
â¢ Having cist up this blood-curdling and hair-raising
scene, they introduce Funston in the foreground,
back to the audience and face to the Valley 6f Death.
He gives himself the word of command, and, mark
ing time to get himself in step, marches into the
sandy mist and mystery. His figure lessens as the
perspective increases, and is finally merged in the
rrirage and is seen no more. Morgue and mournful
thoughts occupy the beholders, who reflect upon the
highly polished condition of the hero's bones when
they shall be found. The pious among them pray that
at least his soul will find transportation from the blear
bosom of the desert to n place of living waters. After
long suspense he reappears. He has bisected, cir
cumnavigated and meandered the Valley of Death,
set his heel on the neck of its monsters, cut down its'
upas trees to make a fire to boil his coffee, spit to
bacco juice down its crevasses, breathed its sands and
coughed them up, sniffed its sulphur and grown fat
on it â in fine, has taken* the sting of Death Valley
and brought it back in his hatband! .
FUNSTON flND DEATH VALLEY.
IT may be an effort to paint the lily, but when the
new school of adulators of General Funston pub
lish fairy tales -about his -exploration of Death
Valley "it is to laugh." Several chapters of this stuff
is out. In 1890 he was with one of the summer
junkets of Major Powell's geological survey, botan
izing in Death Valley and the near-by mountains. Re
membering this episode in his career Eastern papers
ire filled with his achievements in that service.
It must be admitted such statements jfom-.the Chan

,It has been the hope of the jingoes in the Cabinet
and in the country that some way could be found for
providing for the war expenditures without heavily
increasing taxation. Chamberlain and others hoped
to v be able to raise a considerable portion" of the.rev
enue from taxes on the mines and the lands of South
Africa. That hope was shattered by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. He informed Parliament that
South' Africa has been brought to the verge of ruin
and could yield no revenues for years to come. Then
he added: "I aim at no transient popularity; I ask
for no cheers, arid I expect nbhe.M come to tell the
nation the truth and the whble truth. It is necessary
for. the salvation of the nation that T should do so.

The latest story of dissensions in the Ministry is to
the effect that Chamberlain is dissatisfied with the tax
bill proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
thsc in the Cabinet he pressed his objection's, so far
the Chancellor'threatened to Vesigri? iThe' story may
be exaggerated, but there is riothingWprqbable in it.
In fact, in his speech presenting the budget to, Par
liament the Chancellor hardly concealed his disgust
with the war into which Chamberlain's policy has
plunged the empire, and from a man who talks that
way in public it is not unreasonable to suppose there
domes in private discussion a good many strictures

Acres* the early years of the nineteenth
century, when wild plum srreves made
oases on tho prairies and wild deer bedded
by the equally <Â«iiml vo eeni ltlve flower,
ond forestg belted the itreams, a typical
pfoneer village' strung itself along a sin
gle itreet which had been a trail. Town
began at th& brldgo and ended at the tav
ern. The unpaved sidewalks in wet
weather were gratefully bridged by the
drug store 'and general store porchea.
c All the houses were low and small, with
plenty, 'of space around them. An ugly
two-story . brick structure, built by the
rnanVwho founded .the. place, was a man
sion. , Some log fronts. abutted upon the
footpath. The . ta-vern was painted red.

The tour as a whole will be the most extensive ever
undertaken Jby a President of the United States. It is
to occur, at a season of the year at which the coun-'
trv is most beautiful and travel most pleasant.. With
the exception of that portion of his journey which
lies across the desert the President will find the whole
land bright and beautiful from the time he > leaves
â¢Washington until he gets back. In all that wonderful
variety of landscape through which he passes Cali
fornia will stand out' distinct from the rest, for it is
unlike any other portion of the Union. It will be
easy for the President and his Cabinet to perceive it
is the pleasant land for tourists and for holiday seek
ers, but they should be brought to see much more
than that. Our. efforts should be directed to impress
upon them California's greatness as well as her
beauty.

When comparisons of cost, are being made it is
habitual with the advocates of ownership
to consider only the .rate'paid^tp^thfi'water collectors,
and not take : into the, accountTat all the items of cost
which the ratepayer must meet as a taxpayer. As
Mr. Reed very plainly demonstrates, a private supply
is charged for on the basis of cost, interest, adminis
tration- and taxes, so that in 1 the rate paid by, the
consumer every item entering into the cost of the
supply_ appears. We have no other purpose than to
encourage interest in -the facts involved in this inter
esting issue. The strongest argument for municipal
ownership is that of cheapness. A' fair 'examination
of that argument requires that the Ttwo methods* of
supply shall be' put on a financial' and" physical equal
ity, and that municipal water. should not be credited
with the abatement in a death rate, in which its only
agency is its unfitness for use.'
Of course Mr. Reed. ;wijl say, and rightly, lhatall
these emergencies and the cost of meeting them are
not arguments against municipal" ownership of water
supply, and* they, are not. The point is that in Chicago
the cost of the drainage canal and the filters which
must supplement its failure, and of the proposed filter
beds in other cities, must be added to the cost of the
water supply. f
What is true of New York is true also of Philadel
phia, Boston and Chicago. 'In "the" latter" city '.the
papers daily warn the people not to drink' the water
in certain districts, and at frequent periods it is turned
off in the public schoolhous'es. It seems, therefore,
that Mr. Reed^s defense .of the municipal water of
those cities on sanitaty. grounds amounts to this, that
; it- israt times" so filthy that the people save, their
lives by not. usmg it, just as 'table .forks save the eye
sight by people not falling down and sticking them
in their,eyes. Â¦..-:â¢:.
Recurring to the question of cost, it should be plain
that to the cost of a municipal supply^ must.be added
the cost of the substitutes used- while the water is too
filthy to drink, and also the cosf of devices "to correct*
the unsanitary condition of the water. Chicago has at
tempted this by tipping up the river so that it drains
the lake into the Illinois River. 'It was estimated by
the sanitary engineers that a discharge of lake water
through this, drainage, canal of, four hundred million
gallons, per minute would purify the water supply of
sewage. Within a few weeks it has developed that
such a discharge is shoaling the ..lake shore and'
making entry of the harbor impossible to ships of the
deep draft required to cairy on commerce. The Gov
ernment engineers have ordered a reduction of one
half in the discharge, which.! throws Chicago back
where she was before the river was tipped up ai\d the
canal dug. There is no recourse left but filtering the
water. ..Â¦â¢- Â¦,-.â¢â¢ v_ â¢-:'...;..-' >\'.'.' .' . .
The New York Commercial Advertiser says that all
over the" city the ruling price per family for : pure
spring water is ten cents per day, and that the flats and
apartment houses and thousands of private residences
are supplied at that rate. ;'
But no figures are an absolute basis for a conclu
sion until it can be known to what extent a water sup
ply is so filthy that the ratepayers refrain from {its
ust; 'Â¦Â¦''Â¦-. : y: :: : J : . ( . ; . W$
The New York Journal of March 14 last, under vthe
caption, "Clear Water Sells for Ten Cents a 'Quart;
City Supply Filled With' Germs and Unfit to Drink;
Typhoid Fever Threatened," says that the New -York
City water is bad, for "physicians who have examined
it state that it is unfit to drink in its present state, and
the sellers of spring water, carbonated water and fil
tered water are reaping a rich harvest in consequence.
On the West Side plain filtered water sells at ten cents
a quart,' and the supply" o'fibottled spring water does
not half equal the demand. The city water as' it runs
from the faucet is not only disagreeable in appear
ance but gives a most unpleasant odor, and there
lurks in it the danger cf typhoid fever. A Journal re
porter asked for a glass of water in a restaurant.
When it was brought the reporter cut a slice of it off
as a curiosity and ordered' something else to drink."
This puts San Francisco appreciably below : the
average rate of the five cities that own theiry own
water works, and seemj to impair the conclusions
which Mr. Reed draws-from its figures.
We find in McCarty'r, "Statistician and Economist/'
issue of iooo, regarded as entirely reliable, the follow
ing city death rates: '

We gave information as to the condition of the
water supply in the chiet cities where it . is under
municipal-ownership, saying that the people of those
cities as far as possible avoid its potable use when it
is at its worst in border to escape typhoid fever and
other zymotic diseases. Mr. Reed thereupon quotes
death rates, as follows, the deaths being per thousand

Over the Lyceum production of "Corio
lanus" some talk has arisen in literary
circles as to the proper pronunciation or
the .words Corlolanus. Corloli and the>
like. Sir Henry Irving: has decided for
th9 English, or rather ultra-English, vow
els. The Lyceum players boldly adopt the
false quantity In Corioli, making the "i"
long. In fact. Shakespeare's line suggests
that both "i's" should be made long. To
many It sounds strange to hear the line
in which the difficulty chiefly occurs thua
pronounced: -
* Thy stolen name.
Coriolanus, in Corloli.
Another thing which is puzzling Eng
lish readers of certain books Is the Amer
ican spelling of many words. They won
der what it means. It may not be gen
erally known either in the United States
or this country that when books are pub
lished simultaneously In both countries It
is becoming common to have them set up
in America. Thus the mystery la easily
solved, though one cannot help thinking
it would be a curious result of the copy
right act if the English gradually adopt
the American style of spelling such words :
as "theater," "center" and the like.
The creator of "Mr. Dooley" is again
In London. I met F. P. Dunne at the.
Carlton the other day. where he had just
arrived from the Continent. He was not
looking over well, and still bear3 traces
of the Illness which his own paper, the
Chicago Journal, had pronounced fatal
some months ago. He said to me that he
had been over Europe, and incidentally
paid a visit to the Pope, to whom he had
letters of Introduction from his friends
In America. His uncle, be it remembered,
is Archbishop Riordan of San Francisco.
He did not do any v'ork in Italy. "No
body." he said, "does work in Italy."
"Did the Pope read 'Mr. Dooley'?" I ask
ed. "I am afraid not. Indeed," he whis
pered, "I imagine he 13 on the index."
He further told me he intended to re
turn to America in about a week and
remain in New York, where he will work
through the Goddard syndicate.
In his next production he may possibly
bid good-by to the philosopher of Archey
road. "You can't bring him to New
York, you know," he said; "besides, he
wouldn't come!" . , .
As far as the publication fit the forth
coming works Is concerned, the publish
ing world is almost silent this week".
There is also very little interesting gossip
to chronicle. One curious feature about
the literature of the day is becoming
more and more prominent. That is the
popularity of mysteries, or, however the
word may be understood, their success.
So far anonymous love letters have borna
good fruit. Now a novel is announced by
Mr. Lane under the titre of "The Aristo
crats," said to be by "the most beautiful
woman in London." Hard as was the
mystery of the authorship of the "Let
ters" to solve, this should prove an evea
more difficult one to tackle.
Another neeret strictly guarded is thÂ«
GOSSIP FROM

AMUSEMENTS.PERU, Ind., April 23.â Henry Huffman,
an animal trainer, met a horrible death
to-day, being killed by "Big: Charley," a
monster elephant, while the animal was
bathing in the river near here. "Big Char
ley" wound his trunk about Keeper Huff
man and hurled him far into the stream.
The man returned to the shore unin
jured. The next instant Huffman was
grabbed by the big elephant, thrown to
the bottom of the river and held there by
the forefoot of "Big Charley."
Then with a roar the elephant stamped
ed. He broke down fences and roamed
about in a big field, keeping everybody
away from him. Some apples loaded with
strychnine were thrown near him and
he ate one. An hour later he lay down
and F^ 3 in terrible agony. A rifle shot
ended his existence.
"Big Charley" weighed more than three
tpns, was valued at 110.000 and in his life
time had killed four men. Keeper Huff

CINCINNATI. Apiil 25.â The end of the
flood is in sight here to-night. At 6 o'clock
the stage was 59.1 feet and rising one
half inch an hour. The rise from C a. m.
to 6 p. m. was only 7 Inches and at short
intervals during the day it was stationary.
The river at 6 o'clock to-night was rising
slowly for fifty miles above Cincinnati.
It was stationary for one hundred miles
beyond that point and falling for 330 miles
below Plttsburg. It will become station
ary, therefore, before midnight and over
below Cincinnati before morning. The
stage is not expected to exceed 59.3 feet
here to-night and that is considerably be
low the record of seven different years
previously.
With the water a'most ten feet above
the danger line there is endless incon
venience and loss on both sides of the
river here and there is some distress to
night. Mayor Fleischmann secured relief
funds to-day and had committees ap
pointed as hundreds of houses will not
be fit for habitation for some time after
the warer recedes. Similar action was
taken in Newport and Dayton, Ky., to
day, where the conditions are still worse
in inundated districts. The Newport
track is submerged from one to three feet
and greater crowds are attracted than
usual owing to the sight of the horses
running in water. The National League
baseball park, where a game was played
yesterday by the Chicago and Cincinnati
teams, is completely flooded to-night.
All the railroads are in trouble to-day In
handling freight, and some abandoned
that part of their business. None of them
has abandoned any passenger trains, but
the Cincinnati. Georgetown and Ports
mouth Railway was compelled to employ
ferry-boats and towboats to take | their
passengers out as far as the eastern sub
urb of Columbia, east of Cincinnati.
Street railways were compelled v to make
four different transfers in the east end
of Cincinnati to-day.
At Ironton it was reported that 1500 men
had been thrown out of employment.
Similar conditions exist at Cattlettsburg,
Portsmouth and Huntingdon. An estimate
has been made at Huntington that over
3000 families are homeless in" the southern
part of West Virginia and G000 men idle,
and that the loss by flood in that part of
the State will exceed a million dollars.
At'Kipley and New Richmond, up- the
river from Cincinnati, and other towns
in those districts the conditions are re
ported to-night to be very serious, as the
smaller places* are sill underwater and
have not- the means of relief of larger
cities. Â¦ Â¦" , Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦; ' -

RECEDE SLOWLY
Probate â¢ Judge Coffey spent several
hours on the witness stand .in Judge Mu
rasky's court yesterday contradicting and
disproving various statements made by
Horace W. Phllbrook in his action to re
cover $100,000 damages from Van R. Pat
erson for alleged slander. When t Phil
brook opened his case he started out on
the theory that the alleged slander uttered
by Judge Paterson was in furtherance of
a conspiracy In which the Justices of the
Supreme Court, Judge Coffey, Judge Wal
lace and most of the prominent members
of the bar were the "malicious princi
pals." Though Judge Muraskyhas elim
inated the conspiracy charge, certain
statements against Judge Coffey remained
uncontradlcted and he was called In con
sequence.-
. In a certain case Fhilbrook asserted that
Judge Coffey had acted corruptly in per
forming the ministerial, not judicial, act
of authorizing the payment of $240 to one
Daniel O'Connell for services performed
and which sum had already been advanced
by James W. Goodwin, executor, of the es
tate in Question, and allowed by a Judge
of the court other than Judge Coffey. On
the stand yesterday Judge . Coffey ex
plained that his act In this* case was only
ministerial and . furthermore that it was
authorized by law. He denied, as Phil
brook stated, that he had treated Phil
brook with harshnes.s or that he had
treated him as an outlaw. . .
"I treated Philbrook as I treated every
one who had business in my court," said
Judge Coftey. "I did not treat him as an
outlaw, and I can see no reason why: he
should accuse. me of treating him as an
outlaw If he was not one.!'--
Judge Coffey continued on this line, all
of his testimony being in favor of the de
fendant, until far along In the afternoon.
William P. Humphries was next called to .
the stand and stated that he had Been

lating and muttering. Barclay Henley tes
tified that he first came to distrust Phil
brook when he learned that he had exact- '
ed Â¦, a contract from the Levinson heirs. '
whom he represented, for $110,000. vvhich.
in event the ' suit he instituted in their
behalf had been successful, would have
,left them but $7000 of the ' estate they
claimed. Â¦ Judge Slack, John Garber and

the defendant, after which an adjourn
ment was taken until this morning.

LONDON, April 2S.â The Vienna corre-
spondent of the Morning. Leader asserts
that a man named Petroff attempted to
enter the royal carriage at Bucharest, the
Roumanian capital, with a view of mur
dering King Charles, but was prevented
by the sentries after a severe struggle.
The correspondent adds that Petroff Is
believed to be an emissary of the Macedo
nian committee.
-The conference adjourned after it was
decided that both bodies .should agree on
some line of policy in formulating a new
course of study. . /
Superintendent Webster said that he
was willing to act with the board, al
though the course of study prepared by
his office last year had not received the
attention it deserved. After hia office had
spent-months of energy and time in its
preparation and after consulting -with
principals and teachers in relation thereto,
the board had sidetracked the course and
accepted one formulated by Professor El
wood Cubberley Upon being invited by
! Mrs. Â¦ Kincaid to express their views. Su
perintendent Webster and his deputies
outlined what they - thought would be
proper modifications of the present course
of study.
"I would suggest,"* said Mr. Webster
"that the course be modified so as to
make it practicable and effective. The
course now in force , lacks definiteness.
The work in history and geography should
be made more definite in it3 limitations.
For example, in the seventh gTade on the
subject of colonization, the course men
tions several authorities which are to be
studied, but it does not state what par
ticular matters are to be followed. -As a
natural consequence, if the pupils of the
seventh grades. were subjected to a test
it would involve points that one cass is
perfectly familiar with, while other classes
had only touched on them very lightly 1
"I would make it uniform and definite
and supplement It with topical analysis
of the subjects .presented. 'Again I be
lieve the work of science should be les
sened in the intermediate grades and
strengthened in the others, and the sam~
is true of arithmetic. In the preparation
of the course of study we should general
ize before we ,3Decialize."
As the result of an Important conference
held Tuesday between the Board of Edu
cation, the Superintendent of Schools and
his four deputies the course of study at
present, in use in the public schools will
be considerably modified for- the next fis
cal year: The conference was held at the
request" of President JCincald, and there
were present Directors Denman, Casserly
and Mark, Superintendent Webster and
his deputies, Jordan, Kingsbury, Howard
and Sullivan. Mrs. : Kincald stated that
the board, of which she is president, de
sired the co-operation of the Superinten
dent's ofHce In improving the course of
study,^ which has hot been the success it
was expected. '.,.

Â¦LONDON, April 25.â The Chancery Court
has decided that Count Reinholt Moore
von Rosen, residing at Stockholm, as the
eldest son of Count von Rosen, formerly
Chamberlain of the King of Sweden and
Norway, and his American wife, who was
a Miss "Moore, is the real Count and right

From a statement of counsel it appeared
that pome one in America represented
himself to be Count Reinholt, asserting
that the Stockholm claimant had been
s-ubstituted for him by the Von Rosens.
Justice Joyce found that the American
claimant's representations were fraudu

downstairs, where they remained about
half an hour. At the end of that time
the light man came upstairs and told the
prisoner they were going to take him
home. Edward told of the trip home and
of his being set down by his captors on
Ihlrty-slxth street, about a block north
of the pesthouse. He said that while they
were driving in the dark man whispered
to the light man and asked:, "Is this
Sarpy Mills," and the latter replied
"Yes."
The boy admitted that he had gone over
the case with Genera' Corwin with refer
ence to what his testimony would be. He
again detailed the route traversed, as
nearly as he could toll. He admitted that
the only direct view he had of the dark
man's face was when he first approached
him, and admitted that at that time he
was pretty badly scared. The boy said
Young' Cudahy Is Positive.
Attorney Haller for the defense began
tho cross-examination â¢ of young Cudahy.
Callahan betrayed no emotion when the
kidnaped boy declared he wa* one of the
abductors, but a cynical smile played
faintly over his features.
The boy testified that Callahan's mus
tache was stubbier than it is now at the
time of the kidnaping", and that It was
stubbier when first arrested than it is
now.
"Yes, sir."
From this point on Callahan was re
ferred to by name and no longer as the
"dark man.
"You may state whether the dark man,
â¢who put a pistol to your head and made
you a prisoner, and who guarded, you
most of the time in the house and who
walked down the street with you, and
bade you goodby when you were released,
was' one and the. same- person," -asked
General Corwin.
"It was the same man."
"Who was that man?"
"Jim Callahan."
"The defendant here in this case?"
Callahan Is Identified.
Sunday afternoon following Callahan's
arrest. He said Callahan and the Chief
were talking and that Callahan was roll
ing and smoking cigarettes. Then camei
the boy's identification of Callahan, and
it was positive and absolute.
The pony which the kidnaper, rode to
telephone Information to the Cudahy resi
dence -played its part this afternoon In
connecting the name Callahan with the
crime. Daniel Buniss of North Omaha
recognized the little pony now in- evidence
as one which he had sold to the strangers
last October. ', The nitn had called at hia
house/In a buggy, and In one of them he
recognized James Ca'lahan. The other he
said resembled the photograph of Pat
Crowe. The same incriminating pony was
shod by Charles Lee; a South Omaha
blacksmith, shortly afterward. The man
who brought the animal. Lee eald, was
Pat Crowe. The pony had a star on his
forehead and two white feet, which En
abled the blacksmith to be positive of its
identity.
A further complicity of interest between
Callahan and Crowe was disclosed by
Mrs. Anna- Wreuth, living across the
street from Callahan's boarding-house.
She says she frequently saw him in com
pany with a man called Johnson. She
was positive in her identification of. Pat
Crowe's picture as that of Callahan's un
known guest. .
Another piece of evidence which occu
pied the court's attention was the red
lantern by which Mr. Cudahy was guided
to ' the rendezvous with the -gold. An
effort was made to trace its ownership to
the accused.

Callahan when John Rabbe, a young car
penter, living about a block from" CaHa
han's sister. Mrs. Kelly, at 540 Handpop
pleton avenue, was called to the witnes
stand. He testified to knowing Pat Crow'
and that Crowe called at Mrs. Kelly's
where Callahan was living.' about twent;
times between October 23, wnen the Kelly
moved there, and the time of the kid
naping.- He said Crowe always came,th'

Callahan as he was of the identity o
his father or mother. He thought' 1
hardly possible for there to be anothe
voice like Callahan's. He said CaTlaha:
had a sort of a brogue and gave a peculia
turn to some words and sort of talke*
through his teeth. The boy admitted tha
he was not positive as to Callahan's iden
tity at the close of the first interview il
the chief's office, but after a. second sit
ting was positive in his identity.

MEN ONLY
IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF GENERAL
debility, and convalescence following certain
diseases, such is the lowered standard of the
vital processes that the runction of no organ Is
perfectly performed, and with the resulting de-.
pression the patient has a REAL weakness.'
The physician's first thought, under these con-
ditions, Is nerve and other tonics.
Not Weakness ; Symptoms
By far the greater number of patients, how-
ever, seeking relief for so-called "Weakness"
is furnished by healthy and robust men. On
examination, we find a Prostate Gland which
has been damaged .by either a contracted dis-
order or early dissipation. Thesa, patients
have no weakness at all. Prematureneas, Loss
of Vitality, etc., are the symptoms, or disor-
dered function, of the chronically inflamed
prostate gland. We find by curing this Inflam-
mation that full vigor at once returns. It
* should be understood that tonics, electricity,
< etc., might cure a real weakness, but 'would da
. harm Â¦ in Inflammation. The main object is ta

Four hundred men and a lot of teams
are "making- dirt fly" down at Hobart,
doing the first work on the new Salt Lake
road. This means something besides a
siding. It is an army of track-layers. So
far all that the officials have been .will
ing to make public has been that a half
mile of grading and track-laying would
be done there to furnish room for unload
ing the ties and rails which are coming
in to lay on the first seventy miles of the
road. This bis? force of men and teams
looks as If- more work than that- is to be
done. Indeed one of the officers Intimated
to-day that this is the fact. Clark's
forces have put on their working clothes.
Practically a long- sjtretch of right * of
way is secured. The road .might' leo on,
grade and iron to the river, at Monte
bello and build the big bridge at that
point. Then work which would take a
erood many weeks might be done up to
the east bank of the river to where the
Puente hills are met, if it is to go that
way. It Is stated by Mr. Clark and oth
ers of the company that the desire is to
press the *p*Â»rV on ris f^stas possible.
"We will hold the fort," said Gibbon,
"and keep our men at work until we are
ordered to vacate by a court of competent
jurisdiction. The decision of the commis
sioner is not final and we still hope to win
out- If we do not, there are other ways
of getting our road through to Los An
geles and a defeat will in nowise cause us
to halt."
"The Harriman forces have scored a
point," admitted Clark, "but the matter
has yet to be passed upon by the Secre
tary of the Interior and meanwhile we
will relinquish none of our rights."

SAN BERNARDINO. April 23.-A few
days ago the American Beet Sugar Com
pany, whose extensive plant and holdings
at Chino. in this county, representing
nearly $1,000,030, announced that it was ar
ranging to take a hundred Japanese there
to work in the beet lields this coming sea
son. I'pon hearing of its plan several hun
dred beet growers became thoroughly
aroused and at a largely attended indig
nation meeting, held Tuesday night, de
nounced thÂ«Â» proposition and threats were
openly made that if the little brown men
were brought there they would surely be
severely dealt with.
The representatives of the sugar com
pany Â¦were present and made an effort to
allay the bitter feeling that prevailed
amoV.g the farmers, but they were unsuc
cessful. One official of the company stat
ed that it was necessary to import Japan
ese to thin their beets, owing: to the
scarcity of white labor. The erowers in
sisted that such was not a fact and en
deavored to persuade the sugar company's
representative to that effect. The latter
further stated that they had already
pign^d contracts with the Japanese and
could not Â£o back on them. The foreign
help is expected to arrive there in a few
days to commence work and fears are en
tertained that serious trouble will result.

While this fire was raging the Granite
Livery Stable on Second street was dis
covered in flames and before the firemen
arrived it was burning at every point. The
building and contents are a complete loss,
which amounts to $10,000, and is partially
covered by insurance. The fire spread to
the C. Lucas building on the west and laid
it in ashes. The loss on this is $5000.
Sheriff R. E. Bevan's building was dam
aged $6000 and Joseph Fisher's cabinet
shop 51500. The P. George . building was
damaged $3000. The Evening Democrat
office was flooded by water and the stock
and machinery badly damaged. No paper
was issued this evening. The total dam
age will reach over $30,000.
A horse, and many vehicles were burned
in the Granite Stable, where the fire
originated in the hay loft. The firemen
did good work in checking the flames, as
a strong south breeze prevailed and access
to the fire was difficult. The origin of the
blaze is unknown, but there seems to be
reason to suspect that an incendiary
started it.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are pre-
pared by the F. A. Stuart Co. of Mar-
shall, Mich., and sold by druggists every-
where at 50 cents per package. No diet-
ing nor change of habits is required; they
digest the food.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are not
claimed to cur6 everything or anything
except Dyspepsia and stomach troubles,
and for that it stands alone among pat-
ent medicines. Any one suffering from
any trouble with their digestion will find
these tablets will give Immediate relief
and a permanent cure.
This is the reason why Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are superior to all other
spring medicines and blood purifiers.
They give perfect digestion; the food does
not lie In the stomach for hours. They
give a vigorous appetite, sound sleep,
strong nerves, and wholesome food well
digested makes pure blood, and in no
other way can the blood be purified. The
idea that a medicine, in itself, will purify
the blood when the stomach! and diges-
tive organs are out, of order is nonsense.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are used by
thousands in preference to "bitters,"
"after dinner pills" and "blood purifiers"
because they remove the cause of the im-
pure blood, and you do not have to take
them forever to get results. Dyspepsia
is an obstinate disease to cure and a
remedy must be designed especially for
It "and nothing else. - Cure-alls will not
cure dyspepsia.
As a matter of fact, there is but one
possible way in which to purify the blood
and that is . through {he stomach and
bowels.
â¢ Pure blood results from wholesome food
thoroughly digested. Impure blood results
from poor digestion and assimilation.
When the stomach refuses to work prop-
erly the food remains too long a time,
fermenting-, forming gases, shown by
sour, bitter taste in the mouth, bloating
and belching of gas, and- distress and dis-
comfort generally. Poor blood, weak
nerves, sleeplessness and a general don't
care feeling can always be traced to im-
perfect digestion.
' The spring of the year is the time for
blood purifiers. It is the season when we
think we must dose ourselves with sarsa-
parillas, bitters and the endless list of so-
called blood purifiers and nerve tonics. â¢

markable Cures.

Food Experts Say
Malt Breakfast Food
Is the Most Healthful of
Foods.
It Is -well known to analytical food ex-
perts that but few grain foods are really
wholesome and nutritious. The majority
of breakfast foods contain too much In-
soluble starch and other agents that tax
digestion, injure the stomach and heat the
blood.
Malt Breakfast Foodâ a partially predl-
gested foodâ is the greatest triumph of
dietetics. This popular breakfast grain
f oo/l with Its delicious flavor, its perfect
freedom from insoluble starch and other
objectionable features, is the only true
I health food in the world.-
Malt Breakfast Food is the ldeaJ food
to commence the day with. It furnishes
, energy, vitality and strength for. the day
I that no other grain food can supply. It
t agrees with the weakest digestion and
gives tone to the most delicate stomachs.,
1 The best medical authorities recommend
I Malt Breakfast Food for its wonderful
1 food value. At all srocers.

The Civil Service Commission held an
examination yesterday for deputyships in
the Board of Public "Works. Eleven appli
cants took the test, which comprised
questions on the proper administration of
the Bureau of Streets.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the military officials, and as it is
a serious offense they were ordered un
der arrest. Their mysterious spiriting
away followed, and then came, the rum
ors. The two young men were given a.
chance to explain and their release fol
lowed quickly. Their explanation showed
that their terrible crime was due to an
ignorance of the laws governing the man
ner in which a a army officer can draw hla
salary. - .
The officers in question were Lieuten
ants Vernon and Heyman of the Twenty
seventh Infantry, and their arrest was
due to an over-zealous commanding offi
cer. The lieutenants had Just returned
from Manila nnd were possessed with a
burning desire to view the gay sights of
this city. To do this properly required
some cash, and the young officers had
none. They remedied the difficulty by go
ing to a warrant shaver and turning over
to him a voucher for a month's salary for
a sufficient number of dollars to enable
them to see the sights.
It Is a mystery no longer, and now those
who spent many days and nights conjur
ing up all sorts of crimes as those charged
against the unfortunate officers have dis
covered that the time spent on Alcatraz
Island by the supposed terrible offenders
was but two hours, and the offense which
caused their arrest was the hypothecat
ing 1 of a pay voucher for one month's
salary. r
The mysterious arrest and (jnick trans
fer to Alcatraz Island of two volunteer
army officers has been under discussion
in army circles since the mustering out of
the regiment to which the two men were
supposed to be attached. While many ru
mors were afloat, the cause for the arrest
and the manner in- which It was made re
mained a mystery.

Little Adsle Steinman Recognizes
Him as the Burglar Who
Scared Her.
Edward Gallagher, alias Yarrow, the
youthful burglar who broke into the resi
dence of Mrs. Simon Donau at 1452
Franklin street and stole several hun
dred dollars' worth of jewelry, was posi
tively-identified in the City Prison yester
day by little Adele Steinman, who was in
the house at the time, and whom, the
burglar threatened to kill If she made an
outcry.
Gallagher and four other, prisoners
were taken from their cells and made to
stand in a line. The child, who is un
usually bright for her age, was then
asked to Identify the man who had
robbed the house. "Without a moment's
hesitation she pointed to Gallagher, who
vainly endeavored to hide his face. As
the child was positive that Gallagher was
the right man a charge of burglary was
recorded against him.
Detectives Wren and Dinan are
satisfied that Gallagher Is the burglar
who entered the residence of Dr. Bowes
at 2629 Pacific avenue Sunday night and
at the point of a pistol commanded the
servant girl to show him where her mis
tress kept her jewelry and valuables.
To-day an effort will be made to have

estate were about to turn over the Cliff
House or $150,000 to her in settlement was
ridiculed yesterday by the attorneys for

that no such offer has been made and

that all. sorts of propositions have been
made by Mrs. Kluge's attorneys, but
that nothing definite had been ' agreed
upon. Mr. McKinstry and . Reuben H

WOODLAND, April 25.â Donald Fru

of Yole County for forty-seven years. He
was a prominent Mason and will be buried

Under the plan thus outlined it is ex
pected that production will be controlled
and that there will be a reasonable price
obtained for oil which will afford a -fair
margin . of profit to the producers, and
will set aside the bad practices of brokers
who have been pitting one company
against another in the market for the
purpose of knocking- down the price. '
The committee appointed for that pur
pose has. devised a plan to insure unity
of action on the part of the fuel oil pro
ducing companies of the. State. This plan
will be submitted to the companies within
a day or two. The committee, consisting
of five oil men, was named by a general
committee that was appointed at the'gen
eral conference held recently In the maple
room of the Palace Hotel. Since their
appointment the members of the com
mittee have met several times and have
studied the problems before them atten
tively. They have decided that, the gen
eral plan shall, if sanctioned by the pro
ducing Oil companies. Include the forma
i-^/vST?" central company capitalized at
$o00,000, in 5000 shares at $100 per share.
Each producing company shall on the
payment of $1000 for ten shares of stock
be a member of the central company.
Twenty-six hundred shares of stock will
be retained In the treasury, in escrow
and deposited with a trust company by
trustees. There will be a board of direc
tors, who will be elected by the produ6
ing companies, voting in proportion to
their respective production of oil.
Each company will hold its original ten
shares of, stock through the first year.
That will mean an issue. to the companies
of something like 700 shares, it is antici
pated, for it is estimated that' between
seventy-five and eighty companies will
come into the association at the start:
Eleven directors will be elected, who will
serve for. one year. At the end of the
year the stock will be reapoortioned ac
cording to production. An executive
board of three is also provided for in the
plan, who will be salaried men and who
will be Intrusted with the very impor
tant duty of fixing the market price and
apportioning the production among the
several companies. The producing^cOm
panles will enter into a contract with the
cSntral , company to deliver to it all the
oil they produce above that already con
tracted for. the period being for five
years. The central company Is to sell the
oil and apportion the sales among the
companies. The basis of apportionment
will be changed every three months, ac
cording to the respective amounts of busi
ness of the several companies.

snake fastened its fangs In one of her
bare feet. Both the girls started on the
run for the house, but the injured one
sank exhausted on the way, while
the other quickly brought out her father.
The latter put a tourniquet on the child's
leg and applied his mouth to the Wound
sucking out much of the blood and poison,
but too much time had elapsed ofter the

After suffering intense agony for twenty

SAN RAFAEL, April 25.â The prelim

is accused of attempting to murder James
S. McCue at Corte Madera about a week
ago, took place before Judge Bellrude at
Sausallto to-day. Wilson fired three rifle
shots through the house of Benjamin
Scouler. and McCue, who lives In a neigh
boring house, had him arrested on the
ground that Wilson's bullets were in
tended for him.
To-day Mrs. Scouler testified how nar
rowly, she escaped death from a rifle bul
let as she crossed her porch on the night
in question and how two other bullets tore
through her home. Her husband told the
same facts. Constable Creed was next
called and detailed how he secured Wil

will be finished next Tuesday, to which
date it was postponed.

REDWOOD CITY, April 25.â The action
of Jarboe, Crooks, Hearfield & Bannister
against Prince PonlatowskI and T. S.
Bullock to recover $5000 rent due under a
lease of a marble quarry In Tuolumne
County,- was called for trial this morning
before Judge Buck of the Superior Court
of San Mateo County, but on a motion
of the defendants the trial was continued
until next Tuesday morniDg, the 30th.
On last Thursday the same case was
before the court. At that time the de
fendants admitted that they owed the
money, but that William Grant, who at
one time was interested In the quarry,
notified them not to pay it to plaintiffs,
and the defendants then asked the court
to make Grant a party to the proceedings
They also asked leave to deposit the
money with the court and be dismissed,
leaving Grant and plaintiffs to fight for
the money.
The court denied the motion to make
Grant a party, and the latter then filed a
complaint in intervention setting forth his
claims to the money. : It was then under
stood that an order should be prepared
and signed by the Judge permitting the
defendants to pay the money to the clerk
of the court and that they should be dis
missed. This order was, however, not
made, and since last Thursday the de
fendants have been garnisheed under an
execution held by Grant against Jarboe
and Crooks. Now the defendants do not
feel that they can safely pay the money
into court as was their intention, and as
the garnishment was only served yester
day they asked lor a continuance in order
that they might consider what they shall
do.

At ' one time Charles A. Snook was
looked upon as one of the most prominent
merchants in this city. He established a
plumbing business here in 1849 and
enjoyed the greatest prosperity. His firm
was noted for its integrity and had the
confidence . of the business people. Sev
eral months ago, because of sickness and
depression caused by the loss of his wife,
he was forced to retire from active work.
Subsequent to his retirement he showed
signs of mental falling. Arrangements
for the funeral have not yet' been com
pleted.
The deceased disappeared from his home
at 1&41 Broadway on April 12, and his
whereabouts up to the discovery of the
body yesterday remained a profound mys
tery- The first that his daughter, 'with
whom he was living, knew of his absence
was when he failed to come to the break
fast table. A search was Instituted, and
It was found that he had quitted his bed
at the break of day. The last seen, of
him was on a Fillmore-street car, on
which it Is supposed that he went to the
bay. Since his disappearance the family,
assisted by the police, have maintained
a dilierent search.
The mystery which surrounded the dis
appearance of Charles A. Snook, the re
tired pioneer plumber, was solved yes
terday morning when his body was found
floating in the waters of the bay off Fill
more street. The remains were identified
by Deputy Coroner Charles Meehan, who,
with Deputy Donohoe, was detailed to
bring the body to the Morgue. The dis
covery of the body was made by Tony
Deserillo, an employe of the gas works
in the vicinity. The inquest will be held
to-day.

Daroux in his statement throws down
the gauntlet, declaring that if he has
sworn falsely against Mayor Clark the
latter knows his redress. Thus the battle
rages.
Clark is a candidate for re-election for
Mayor next fall, and since Cavanaugh
ana Darour* together with Wright, are
ment in to-night's Bee, in which he ex
plains what he meant by saying that
Clark Â¦was a partner â¢with him in .the pool
room business and in which he denies ab
solutely that he told Clark that Colonel
Wright was interested in "the poolrooms.
B. W. Cavanaugh, DarOux's partner, is
to the front with a similar denial In Col
onel Wright's behalf.
Added interest to the general row which
Daroux' s sensational testimony has pro
duced is : imparted by a statement from
President John C. Ing of the City Board
of Trustees, in which the charge is made
that several months after Mayor Clark
was leading the church crusade against
the poolrooms he held a conference with
the poolroom men at Cavanaugh' resi
dence looking to the passage of an ordi
nance that would compel him as Mayor
to issue licenses to poolrooms complying
with certain conditions.
A well-known theatrical man said yes

B. W. Cavanaugh was a witness In the
oil land case this afternoon. He testified
that Clark had told him that he had had
a row with Colonel Wright and J. L.. Gil
lis and was glad to get out of the com
pany. The witness was asked if Clark
was in earnest at the time, and replied
that Mayor Clark "joshed a good deal and
passed considerable hot air.'.' Pressed by
counsel to define what he meant by "hot
air," Cavanaugh said it was "a sort of
fluid that comes from, a man's body when
he thinks he is going to be elected and
then forgets all about it afterward."

As indicating the interest which- Mayor
Clark's interview in The Call has awak
ened, F. A. Daroux, B. W. Cavanaugh
and M. P. Rowland issued a written state
ment to-night addressed to the editor jit
The Call, in which they assert that tn*y
never, at any time or place, intimated

ment made by Mayor Clark in The Call as
unqualifiedly false.

and Booth* oil land suit appears
to be dealing with pretty nearly
everything except oil, but it is
contributing a rich fund of enter
tainment to the people of this city famil
iar with local political conditions. The
interview with Mayor Clark in this morn
ing's Call, in which he spoke In bitter
terms of Colonel J. B. Wright, division
superintendent of the Southern Pacific at
this point, charging him indirectly with
part ownership In the poolrooms and sub
ornation of perjury, created almost as pro
found a sensation as the declaration of
Frank .Daroux at the trial yesterday aft
ernoon, that Mayor Clark was an owner
with him in the poolroom and had com
mitted the cardinal sin . of inflicting upon
him the double cross. Â¦ â¢
Frank Daroux is out with a long state-
"China has wonderful mining possibili
ties. The coal fields are the richest in
the world, the only drawback being the
laclr of transportation; I will return to
China next December, as by that time
the country will be quieted down and it
will be safe to travel."
"The stories about the brutality of the
allied troops is untrue. The Russians and
possibly a few of the Indian troops might
have committed a few crimes, . but when
you- come to consider the horrible acts
of the Boxers you can hardly believe hu
man being's capable of them.
"We arrived at Nanyaiigfu one after
noon about 5 o'clock, and I decided to
enter the city. Only two of the mission
aries would go In with me, the others re
fusing on account of it beingr a walled
city. I left a bodyguard with them. Ini
the morning runners entered the city and
ir formed me that Boxers were attacking 1
the caravan outside. I came to the scene
as soon as possible and found that five
of my native servants had been killed
by the Boxers, and that the missionaries
had also received a.feood pummeling, but
that the women and children had not been
harmed. -
"On May 22 of last year," he saJd, "I
was about 300 miles from Tientsin with
my caravan prospecting for coal. Run
ners were dispatched to me from high
Chinese officials warning me to push out
further west, as it would not be safe for
me to -return. In Northern Honan 1 ran
into a crowd of missionaries who were
very much in fear of being killed. I had
plenty of money with me, and as they
had none I thought it was the best plan
for them to join my caravan, which they
did. They and their families traveled;
with me for several days.

"There are now outstanding three Judg
ments against Alice Edith Dickason
Blythe in favor of Mrs. Moore, and Un
ruh claims title- from Mrs. Dickason
Blythe, obtained after the rendition of
those judgments. He has no earthly
chance of obtaining interest in the prop
erty situated In California or that located
in other States by virtue of this suit.
"Of course Mrs. Moore will set up these
judgments in her favor, and Seny the
plaintiff's title. It will be impossible for
the plaintiff to prove "his case as he has
stated it or otherwise, 'and hence it must
fail."
Former Attorney General William H. H.
Hart of .counsel for Florence Blythe
Hinckley Moore was most emphatic in his
construction of the suit instituted by Un
ruh. "The complaint now filed," said Mr.
Hart, "alleges that Unruh is the owner of
title to all the property Involved situate
in the State of California. On February
25, 1901, the Supreme Court of the United
States held that Judge Coffey's decision
In. favor of Mrs. Moore finally settled her
title to the estate of Thomas Blythe aa
against the whole world, and that the
case could not be reopened.
General Hart's Statement.
W. F. Baggett of counsel for Unruh
talked freely of his client's claim toe title
on the assignment of interest from Mrs.
Alice Edith Dickason Blythe. "It is an
ordinary suit to acquire title by Unruh as
successor in interest of Alice Edith Dlck
ason Blythe," said Mr. Baggett. "Unfuh
holds deeds representing her claims to in
terest in the whole of Thomas Blythe's
estate, assigned to him by E. J. 'Baldwin,
who originally obtained them from Mrs.
Blythe. We maintain the claim that Alice
Edith Dickason Blythe is the lawful wid
ow of Thomas Blythe and that Florence
Blythe Hinckley Moore is not his daugh
ter.
"The whole case will ultimately hinge on
the interpretation of Judge Coffey's orig
inal decision in the Probate Court, award
ing title to Mrs. Blythe Moore as the sole
heir to Thomas Blyth*. The main con
tention that will be set up by Unruh is
that the proceedings in the Probate Court,
a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, do not
estop him from asserting the rights as
signed to him fcy the widow.
"Unless Mrs. Blythe Moore can success
fully plead the decision rendered by the
Probate Court, which she will undoubt
edly set up in defense as a bar to the
pending suit, the complaint will be all
threshed out r.gain and carried to the
court of last resort."

side were in court yesterday when Judge

complaint.
Attorneys Not in Court.
Several months ago Unruh filed a suit
attacking the title to all the property for
merly owned by Blythe, some of which is
situated in Arizona and some in Oregon.
On Mrs. Moore's demurrer Judge Hunt
held that the courts of this State lacked
jurisdiction- over all property located out
side of California, and tnerefore sustained
the demurrer of the defendant. Unruh
was granted leave to file an amended com
plaint, the demurrer to which was over
ruled yesterday, which action practically
reopens the question of '.title to the gore
block and to property at San Dieeo, de
clared by the highest State and Federal
courts to be vested In Florence Blythe
Hinckley Moore.
Unruh Is the agent and manager of E. J.
Baldwin's Santa Anita ranch, and bases
his suit on an assignment of interests
from Alice Edith Dickason Blythe to
Baldwin, who in turn transferred to Un

deeds thus obtained.
By a decision' of - Superior Judge Hunt
yesterday overruling the demurrer of
Florence Blythe Hinckley Moore to the
complaint of Hiram A. LTnruh, who sued
for title to all the property sltuatedÂ«ln

REOPENS BLYTHE
ESTATE BATTLE
A complete turndown of all the nomi
nations sent to the Legislature by Gov
ernor Dole is threatened. The Independ
ents have been holding caucuses on the
subject and they would like to turn down
all the men the Governor named, and
who are now holders of the offices for
which the executive renomlnates them.
The Home Rulers have a list of their own
of men whom they would like to see in
office. R. N. Boyd, J. M. Poepoe and J.
K. Kaulia, Home Rule men who have
been prominent leaders of the party, are
the party caucus selections for Superin
tendent of Public Works, Attorney Gen
eral and High Sheriff respectively. It Is
thought that some at least â¢ of the Gov
ernor's nominations will be rejected and
the clean sweep of all may carry. Under
the organic act the Governor may leave
the offices unfilled till the Legislature ad
journs and then appoint his own choices.
Wilcox told the natives that they would
have better standing in the United States
if they joined one of the American par
ties, and advised them to turn to the Re
publicans, but the bitter feeling among
natives against the "missionarv" wing of
the Republican party makes fusion doubt
ful. In the step they have taken so far
the natives have refused to drop their
name of Independent Home Rulers,- 'and
have only added Republican to that name.
The efforts to bring about more complete
amalgamation are watched with much in
terest here, and there may be mass meet-
Ings of both sides to discuss the matter.
The result of the proposal and its in
dorsement by a majority of the native
party leaders is that both the parties af
fected are- more or less split over it. The
Republican party has for some time been
divided into the elements known as mls
slor.arj>end anti-missionary, and it is
with the latter, or anti-administration
Republicans, that the Home Rulers may
combine locally. At present they have
taken action which they think unites
thorn with the national Republican party,
but not with the party organization in
Hawaii. The opposition ot the former
Queen to any plan looking to a reconcilia
tion between the natives and the old Re
publican leaders, whom she regards as
her enemies and who were annexation
leaders, is said to have had a powerful
effect in causing- the Home Rulers to care
fully turn Republican in such a way that
they would not be committed to the sup
port of the present Republican organiza
tion in Hawaii.
HONOLULU, April 19.â The proposals
vhich Delegate Wilcox brought back
from Washington that the native Home
Rule party becoma Republican has
aroused great political activity and is be
ing very much discussed in political cir
cles. It is stated that the plan was pro
posed to Wilcox by Senator Cullom, and
that the President showed interest in the
conversion of the natives of Hawaii to
Republicanism.

shown by the yellow cereal during to-day's

least 2,000,000 bushels of May corn, and in doing
so showed how firm was his hold on the mar

close found May at 4Sc, the price at which
the bull leader had admitted his willingness
to sell. Meanwhile he bought as much July
as he had sold of the nearer future. The
market for May opened Me lower to *4c higher

its representative, offered Phillips 48c for 80y,

Weather Report.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Thf buoyant movement continues and there
seems to be no limit in sight to the extremes
to which epeculative tendencies may carry
prices. The market has passed beyond the
control of cold, ca';ulatlng reason and seems
to be careering along at an intoxicating gait
Â¦which promises to last until accident or sheer
exhaustion brings the public to its senses.
Conditions are certainly favorable to a period
of excessive speculation and this fact must
be admitted irrespective of the of
ordinary prudence. With prosperity general;
with money plentiful at reasonable rates; with
the Epeculative temper ct high pitch, and with
larger aggregations of capital than ever be
fore known working with all the irresistible
power of a tremendous force, it is not sur
prising that values are made to soar upward.
Nothing is more contagious, once it is fairly
developed, than the fever of speculation; and,
like fevers of other sorts, it must run Its
rourse. At the present cime much of the buy-
Ing is based upon the belief that the big cap
italists and syndicates are obliged to support
the market rather than allow the various deals
Â¦which they have in contemplation to collapse.
Let one or two weak spots of Importance de
velop; let one or two important deals fall
through, and the whole bull movement would
be checked, and the results of a stiff reaction
Just now would be disastrous. Fortunately no
weak spots of consequence are at present to
be detected. There are no signs yet that specu
lation has been carried to a dangerous excess,
or that financial resources have yet been weak
ened. If speculation has- surpassed the record
it must be remembered that it is simply keep
ing step with record-breaking times and that
in the large majority of instances the ad
vamces in stocks have been Justified by their
increased earning powers and the abundance
of money."

"n practically the whole market the firmness
â¢t the stock at the highest level In Us history
ivas surprising. One of the favorite maxims
with Wall street traders is to sell on good
news. Burlington's quiet firmness on the con
firmation of Its cood news argued small hold
ings of a purely speculative character await
ing realization. The sentimental effect was
very marked, owing -to the warnings which
have been coming from Influential commission
houses for some time past that over speculation
threatened the stability of the position In the
Etock. market- For che first time, this week
the bears refrained from their final attack on
the market and there was not the flood of
realizing orders which have been a feature
of the last hour of each previous day this
week. The fact that the buying demand was
considerably relaxed did not seem to encourage
the bears to any aggressive efforts, although
there was -a distinct ebb of prices in the final
hour on profit-taking for the day and final
prices were considerably below the best ex
cept in a few cases. The most conspicuous
movements of the day were distinctly the out
growth of the current conviction that the per
fecting of the Burlington deal will be followed
by similar arrangements on the part of other
railroad systems as an offset. The grangers,
Pacifies and Southwesterns therefore played a
prominent part in the trading. The marked
strength of some of the Eastern trunk lines !
was supposed to be associated with the move
ment of the Western lines. Thus the stock
market gossip attributes the large buying of
Atchison to a design on the part of the Penn
sylvania to control a Pacific outlet. Baltimore
and Ohio, as a subsidiary company, was even
more acutely affected than Pennsylvania. The
rise in Atchison extended to 4%, in the pre
ferred to 3, in Baltimore and Ohio 5% and- in
Pennsylvania to 2%. The advance in Northern
Pacific was resumed after a lengthy period of
comparative quiet, apparently on the theory
that it was entitled to rise with Union Pa
cific. Union Pacific itself was at one time 2%
over last night and twice receded below last
night, closing with a net gain of only a
fraction. The strength of Southern Pacific
was due to the supposition that it will share
In any advantages which accrue to Union Pa
cific. The official denials which were given
out of many rumors of yesterday and to-day
were without the slightest effect on the mar
ket. Special strength was shown by the Chi
cago Terminal Transfer and Colorado Fuel
stocks at advances of 3% to 5% without news
to explain it. Smelting broke 4% on the an
nouncement of another injunction against the
stock issue proposed to take up the Guggen
heim interests. The stock rallied 2%. The
ease of call money precluded any anxiety over
the money market.
The large buying of Union Pacific convertible
bonds continued and the market generally was
strong. Total sales, oar value, $7,050,000.
United States refunding 2s declined % and
the 3s (registered) V*. per cent on the last call.

CLOSING.
The stock market here was active and cheer
ful to-day. The chief feature was the amazing
continuance of the strength and . activity of
American shares'. Union Pacifies were bought
from the start. London is beginning, to calcu
late that the Increased earnings on this road
mean a nine per cent dividend distributable on
the common stock. Calls for the end of June
at 110 are being bought at $10. The'Atchisons
also are buoyant and were helped by a tip that
those who have manipulated the rise In Union
Pacifies were taking up the Atchlsons with a
view to advancing them next. ' London was
doing pretty well by Itself when the New York
opening prices were sent over, showing a big
hoist of Union and Southern Pacifies and of
the Baltimore and Ohio shares. Baltimore and
Ohio common bounding up $4 a share In four
minutes. Except for the specialties, the mar
ket was fairly quiet, inclining to ease in the
street after the close. Men prominent in tha
market are shaking their heads over these spe
cial -spurts.
Money was tight on the amount locked up
fur. the new issue of consols.

The base price of Â¦ Prunes has been put back
to 3c for' the four sizes. What effect this will
have is .a question which is causing some
conjecture on the street. It Is feared In some
quarters l that those outsiders who bought at
the cut rate of 2c will turn round and sell at
2>4c or 2>Â£c,;thus leaving the association high
and dry, with no buyers. A few days will
tell whether this' apprehension' is well .found
ed. The result of the cut,- however, was the
disposal of about 36,000,000 pounds, according to
public advices from Â¦ San Jose. Â¦

In years. From this the general market de
rived, much of its bullishness. July corn sold
between 44%c ' and 45^c and closed U@%c
higher at 45%c. Â¦.â¢;.-. -;Â¦Â¦'
The market for wheat was active, strong and
the broadest : in weeks. - May opened %Â©><ic
lower in sympathy with an easy tone at Liv
erpool and because the weather was highly
satisfactory to farmers. Liberal sales wero
made at ' the. start, but there was a demand
of such breadth that an attempt was
made to get the stuff back. The market In
consequence rallied to 72%c and . later, influ
enced by damage reports from Kansas, where,
It was said, fly ravages were beginning to be
apparent, crowded up to 72%c. Realizing sales
caused a reaction" to 72%c during the after
noon, but the close was strong, Yzc higher at
72%c.
Oats were fairly active and firm in sympathy
with wheat and. corn. May oats closed un
changed. - . *
Provisions were quiet but firm in sympathy
with an advance in prices at the yards. Fluc
tuations were narrow. Pork closed 5c higher,
lard 2%@5c up and ribs 7%e up*
The leading futures ranged _as follows: . '.
the pit for a time, and this gave rise to ' a
rumor that he had made a private settlement
with shorts. Fearing that the market was
about Â¦ to collapse, scattered longs hastened to
unload, and May broke, to 4714 c Phillips at
this point re-entered the pit and a sharp rally
to 48Â»ic followed. Later the market got back
to 47#c. but again recovered and the close
was at 4Sc, %c under yesterday. It Is esti
mated that the Phillips line of May at. the
close was about 3,000,000. It is figured Â¦ that
there will be this amount In store here May
1 and that It will be delivered to him. It is
regarded as highly probable that the last
remnant of the short Interest took Its medicine
to-day. â¢ _ . Â¦ . Â¦

NEW WHATCOM, Wash., April 25.â
Under an order of the court, Receiver
Muir of the Scandinavian-American
Bank this afternoon filed a report of its
affairs which lays bare a system of
reckless banking operations. According
to the reports the bank's president, St.
John Dix, borrowed its entire deposits
and $8000 of its capital on his unsecured
notes. Other officers are the bank's
debtors to the extent of $1200. The cap
ital stock of the Scandinavian-American
Bank â¢ was $25,000. Of the 250 shares
President St. John held 207, and Cashier
Oleson. 15; Â¦ The bank's . nominal assets
are $31,776. Of this over $24,000 are unse
cured notes of its - president. In. giving
the total deposits at $16,442, the report
says: - . â¢
, "This does not include deposits issued
to St. John apparently without . value,
and "which the bank was in the practice
of issuing to him without consideration,
to enable him to raise money on them
by arrangements with other banks. In
addition the bank owes other ; banks
about $4000." . Â¦Â¦ - Â¦Â«..-.
Among other things, the receiver'claims
that the bank's books were falsified $24
000 being carried as cash in the vault
which was X never there. President St.-
John of the bank Is at present in London.
The bank president's proper name is H..
St. John Dlx. He went under the name

Entered*
CINCINNATI, April f 25.â David D.
Thompson was, to-day. elected editor of
the -Northwestern' Christian Advocate of
Chicago by the book committee of the
Methodist jGpsicopa^ church, to succeed
Rev. Dr. Arthur Edwards* deceased. The
action is decidedly progressive and was
not accomplished without .'a struggle.'
Precedent was entirely against the suc
cessful candidate, for. he Is a layman, and
hitherto only reverends and doctors of
divinity have been selected to sit in the
editorial chairs of tne Methodist papers,
as well as to, fill almost all the other
places of trust and honor. He had against
him as rival candidates such distin
guished men as Rev. Dr. Jesse Bowman
Young of Cincinnati, an editor of years'
experience; Rev. S. J. Hertenk, assistant
editor of the New York Advocate; Rev.
Dr. R. J. Coke, of the Methodist Advocate
Journal; Rev. P. M. Swift of Chicago,
Rev. D. W. Clark of Cincinnati, Rev. S.
H. Whitlock, Mattoon, 111. ; Rev. j William
N. Mickler, Springfield, 111.; Rev. C. M.
Cobern, Denver; Professor 'C. M. Stuart,
Northwestern University, and G. H.
Potts, editor of the Michigan Christian
Advocate.
Twenty-five or thlrtv years ago Thomp
son began his connection with" the Metho
dist journals by becoming a proof-reader
In the office of the. Western Christian Ad
vocate in this city. Subsequently he was
made news editor and finally assistant
editor, and after a brier season of edi
torial work in a secular paper at Spring
field, Ohio, he became connected with the
Northwestern Christian Advocate in Chi
cago.

JAPANESE AND THEIR ART
SUBJECT OF A LECTURE
One of the most brilliant and thought-
ful lectures that a San Francisco audi
ence has. ever had the pleasure of hear
ing was given Wednesday night in the
art gallery of W. K. Vlckery, on Post
street, by Professor Fenollosa, on "The
Japanese and Their Art." The lecturer
Is eminently well equipped for discussing
his subject by a patient and Intimately
pympathetic study of the Japanese and
their methods during his professorship in
the University of Toklo, covering a per
iod of twenty-three years. He said in
part:
"A sympathetic knowledge of the peo
plea of the Orient, their history, ideals,
ethice. art and language, is particularly
essential to the American, becoming even
vitally Important to the dweller , on the
Pacific Coast, which is physically face to
face with these peoples. The step re
cently taken in the Berkeley university
in the founding of a chair of Oriental
languages, in the teaching of Spanish,
also with the latest innovation, the Slav
ic tongue, was evidence of the wisdom
Â«nd breadth of the man at the helm, Pro
fessor Benjamin Ide Wheeler."
The lecturer then discussed the history
of the art of Japan, its derivation from
the Chinese, its own five periods, the
spiritual and physical conditions upon
which it is based and Its universal and
distinguishing characteristics,- and, with
a plea for the better understanding of the
little brown man and his ideals, ended
his lucid and suggestive talk. A vote of
thanks to Professor Fenollosa proposed
by Professor W. D. Armes of the Univer
sity of California and seconded by Pro
fessor Fryer was unanimously adopted.
A VESTS A PANIC IN
CINCINNATI THEATER
Camille D'Arville's Presence of Mind
Prevents Possible Loss of
Many Lives.
Camille d'Arville to her distinction as
actress and singer has added the reputa
tion of a heroine. The scene of the latest
act to bring her fame was the Columbia
Theater. Cincinnati, where she appeared
last week.
By her presence of mind the singer pre
vented a panic, with the probable attend
ant less of life. Miss d'Arville had fin
ished her turn, and was dressing for the
street, when her. attention was attracted
by loud shouts from the audience, and
cries of "Fire:" The Dumont trio were
on the stage doing their turn, when a
man In the parquet rose to go out, a.
whole line of spectators rising to allow
him to pass to the aisle. At the same
time a smell of burning rubber made it
self evident to the fire cranks in the
house and in a few seconds all the sfens
*<i a lively panic were in evidence. The
ir.u?ic was? drowned in the noise, and two
of tho Dumcnt trio took to their heels
amid the excitement.
At this moment Miss d'Arville. armed
with a towel, rushed on the stage from
h< r. dressing-room, and with much wav
ing of her peaceful weapon succeeded at
Isii-t In quieting the frightened crowd
j Pn as!=l!red them that there was
Do danger and the performance proceed
ed. It was learned that the trouble was
enured by an imperfectly insulated elec
tric wire.

â¢ IN A GREAT TRUST
After a frantic search of the hole Adams
summoned his neighbors and by noon a
considerable crowd had gathered in the
barnyard. Every nook in the vicinity
was 'peered Into "and the search had all
but been abandoned, when Anton Sadi
lek came upon the missing treasure in
the crutch of a sawbuck near the scene
of the excavation. It then occurred to
Adams that he had intrusted the money
to the cranny while engaged in digging
the hole. He had then carefully inserted
the empty can and proceeded with pains
to remove all evidence of It3 presence.
So Adams determined to bury the treas
ure in the barnyard until it could be
safely housed in the bank vault Secur
ing a tomato can he dug a hole in a quiet
spot and deposited It therein,- carefully
removing all evidence of the cache. Adams
slept peacefully all night and in the
morning found the secluded corner of the
barnyard apparently Just as he had left
it. He unearthed the can and was horri
fied to discover that it was utterly void
of contents.

COMMITTEES ANNOUNCED
TOR ST. PETER'S PICNIC
"Because he failed to Â» provide for me
and our child." said Mrs. Gardiner to
day, "I was compelled to get this money
to keep us from starvation. It was used
to buy food for ray baby and myself. Mr.
Speck turned me out of doors and I was
left to shift for myself."
The young woman was arraigned to
day in the Police Court, her ball belns
fixed at $500. The case was continued un
til Saturday to be set for hearing.
The mortgage was signed by "Mrs.
Helen Speck." It bore Interest at the
rate of 3 per cent a month. When Gar
rett started to foreclose upon the mort
gage he discovered, he alleges, that thern
was no Mrs. Helen Speck in law and that
the maker of the obligation and security
had no title to the goods she had pledged.
So the money lender laid his case before
the prosecuting attorney and a warrant
was Issued for the young^ woman's ar
rest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

Helen Gardiner. 22 years old. is regis
tered at the Oakland City Prison under
the najne of Helen Speck, accused by Jo
siah Garrett of having fraudulently ob
tained $60 from him by mortgaging house
hold furniture which was not her prop
erty. A. M. Speck, a San Francisco real
estate dealer, asserts claim to the goods,
which have been a part of the furnish
ings at 1247 Pearl street. Alameda, Speck's
residence. The prisoner declares that for
four years she has borne Speck's ' name,
although not legally entitled to it.
Her story is that last May,, shortly be
fore she, with her child, separated from
Speck, she was compelled to raise some
money. To Garrett, through James
Nairne, a broker, she made the applica
tion and secured the money, giving the
mortgage upon the - furniture, to which
she believed she had a moral claim.

ST. LOUIS, April 23.â Because an em
ploye remains In the employ of the com
pany when he knows that a risk is as
sumed by so doing does not relieve the
employer of the responsibility if acci
dents occur. This is the gist of an opin
ion handed down by the United States
Court of Appeals in the case of the South
ern Pacific Company, plaintiff In error,
against Katie "Xeargin, as administratrix
of the estate of T. J. Yeargin, deceased.
; The suit was originally filed in the Fed
: eral court of Utah by Katie Yeargin.
who sought to recover damages for the
, death \ of her husband, who was an en-
I gineer on the Southern Pacific Railroad
until killed In 1899 in collision with a
"helper" engine.
Judgment in the lower cotfrt was given
for Mrs. Yeargin, and from this the com
pany appealed on a writ of error. One of
the instructions which the defendant
asked the .Judge to give the jury was
that Schriver, engineer of the
, was a fellow servant, and It it was prov
en that his fault caused the injury, the
plaintiff could not recover. The lower
court refused. â¢
\ Judge Amos Thayer, who wrote the
opinion of the appellate, court, held that
the lower court was correct. in this, and
said that if the "helper" engine had had
a headlight, which could have been seen
two miles and a half, instead of one that
could be seen only 250 yards, Yeargin
might have seen it in time to have stopped
his train and avoided the accident. The
trial court had refused to instruct the
jury that if Yeargin knew that it was the
practice of the defendant company to use
Â°? T an ordin ary lantern on the rear of
the helper" ; engine, when It was. run
ning backward; he- with this knowledge
.assumed ;the 'risk Incident Uo it. : Judge
Thayer said jthat, if. such was'upheld it
would enable employers to avoid the per
formance of the duty they owe to iheir
employes to exercise reasonable care In
providing them with tools, machinery and
appliances ordinarily safe and adapted to
tho uses to which they are to be applied.
_ The opinion stated that, .as the record
alEclosed.no error, the decision of the
lower,' court would be affirmed:
Justice Sanborn, dissenting, held that
the railroad company was not guilty of
negligence. that the accident was
ca^ se 3, h . y the act of a fellow servant,
and that, accordingly, the case should
have been reversed. .. .. y '

The National Homes for the Care of
Disabled Soldiers and Sailors Â¦ are
governed by a board of managers, of
which the President of the United States,
the Chief Justice of the United States Su-
I preme Court and the Secretary of War are
j ex-officio members. The president of the
board Is General M.T. McMahon of New
York. Accompanied by General Charles
M. Anderson of Ohio and Colonel George
W. Steele of Indiana, also of the board of
managers, the president visited the home
at Santa Monica last week and was grati
fied to note a marked Improvement in the
appearance and management of the In
stitution. The governor of the Santa
Monica home. General O. H. La Grange,
was spoken of as an able officer.
Last Wednesday General McMahon,
Colonel Steele and General Anderson
visited the Veterans' Home, Napa County,
an institution-jointly sustained by the
United States and the State of California,
Eight hundred veterans are cared for at
this home. The visiting managers made
a thorough tour of the premises. 1 They
inspected the quarters, the dam, the reser
voir, ice plant, engines and electric plant,
laundry, farm, hospital, 4ining-room, ba
kery, canteen, water pipe system, library,
social hall, cottages, barracks. barn,
dairy, poultry and livestock. When the
tour of duty was ended they said without
hesitancy that the institution was the
best State home In the United States. In
point of natural scenery and advantages
the home at Bath, Me., was the only one
comparable to it. It was found that the
home at Napa was conducted on the lines
established tor the government of national
institutions. General McMahon remarked
that not a word of fault could be xound.
Instead of giving suggestions, he thought
the national board might gain points in
sonw of the features of hospital manage
ment at the California home. He highly
commended the officers. Colonel George
W. Walts, commandant; Major C. E.
Graham, adjutant; Major Thomas A.
Keables. medical director; Captain W. F.
McAllister, assistant medical director, and
Captain J. J. Lyon, quartermaster and
commissary.
The visiting managers recommend
ed a site for the new hospital. The
I/eglslature recently appropriated $25,000
1 for the extension of the hospital accom
' modations and the Governor approved the
allowance.
General McMahon and his associates
were escorted to the Presidio yesterday by
General Shafter. They started for New
York last evening in their private car.
On their way to the Atlantic they will
visit Leavenworth. Kans., Marion, Ind.,
and Milwaukee, Wis. /â¢

At a preliminary meeting held last even

Club in the Palace Hotel steps were taken
to form a permanent organization among
the Republicans of this city. The meet
ing was addressed by Attorney General
Tirey L. Ford. He called attention to the
lack of permanent organization. The
I nion League left plenty of room for a
similar organization, especially among
the younger men, he said. The trend of
national development is westwardâal

"I regard Governor Hill as the ablest
Of Democratic leaders. His popularity is
on the increase rather than on the decline.
Political questions have seldom come up
for discussion on my trip across the con
tinent, but 1 have heard many expres
sions of opinion regarding I>a\id B. Hill's
special fitness for leadership in the re
organization of the Democratic party. In
my judgment the party will return to the
advocacy of sound money principles, and
1 believe Governor Hill is in position to
exert a vast influence In the direction of
effective reorganization. It is early to
speak of campaign issues three years
ahead, but Democrats throughout the
country perceive that steps must be taken
to readjust affairs within the party. I
know that Governor Hill has been criti
cised for lending his support to Mr. Bryan
in the late campaign, but he was bound
in honor to follow the course which he
pursued. The questions involved were
submitted to the judgment of the people
and we all know the result. Democrats
pronounced against the departure of the
party from its true principles. ... -a
"Mr. Bryan has still a following, but it
is fragmentary, and I fancy that he will
not encourage his followers to resist par
ty reorganization on true lines. Governor
Hill ifc a wise and patient leader. He can
.afford to wait. He Is not ambitious, but
he li> ready to serve his country and the
party to which he belongs. He was not
ambitious to become United States Sena
tor. I happened to be in the Legislature
when he was chosen and knew then that
his personal inclinations were not consid
ered. In New Tork he is stronger than
ever. Thoughtful Democrats throughout,
the country' are looking ahead for a gTeat
leader and their thoughts turn to Gov
ernor Hill."
General Martin T. McMahon. Judge of
ihc Court of General Sessions, New York,
nr.d president of the National Board of
Managers for Soldiers' Homes, arrived In
i he city last Tuesday and left for Leav
enworth. Kans., last evening. General
McMahon In the New York Legislature
earnestly and successfully supported I>a
vid B. Hill for United States Senator. His
admiration for the ex-Governor of the
Empire State has not been diminished by
rtcent political events. At the Palace
Hotel yesterday he was asked if Mr. Hill
retained his prestige in New York as a
popular leader and Democratic organizer.
General McMahon replied:
Popularity of Ex -Governor

jsIARBIED.LITTLE Eugene Bonnell. now
slightly past his fifth year and
whose cradle originally was : a
cigar box. has been for the second
time taken from the custody of
his grandmother, Mrs. Eliza M. Tolman. by
Secretary "White of the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
White acted under virtue of an applica
tion made yesterday before Judge Coffey
for letters of guardianship. ; The child
has been temporarily placed in the
Youth's Directory and the grandmother
<-.ocupted a cell last night in the detention
*-jrd for the insane at the City HalL
It is a Ions story that led up to the
final taking away of the lad, who, desp'ite
his unfortunate surroundings, is bright
for his years. Dr. George B. Tolman, the
l:ut-band of the woman arrested, was for
merly a surgeon in the United States ar
my, serving with distinction all. through
the evil war. He was Â¦ stationed at many
important posts, but- his wife's tendency
lÂ«i drink led him In the same direction,
ar.d he was finally discharged. "
Soir.c time after the physician's dismis
sal, the Tolmans settled in San Francisco,
buijoir.g a large house on the side of a
hill at 249 Bright street in Ocean View,
i?r from the nearest car line. The house
v.sk sumptuously furnished, and Tolman
r-risaged in the drug business, his last
More being at 909 Stockton street seme
seventeen years ago. - '
FROM FILTHY ABODE MRS.
TOLMAN AND GRANDSON
ARE FORCIBLY TAKEN.
. Frequent complaints have been made to
the society about the. condition of the
child. When the officers called there yes
terday. Mrs. Tolman received them in
what might have once been a parlor. In
one corner stood a grand rosewood piano;
immediately opposite a cook; stove, with
lidsYemved and dirty pots and pans scat
tered over it. .In another corner was the
family larder, consisting- " of an' old tin
bucket, half. filled. with flour, a fermented
bottle of tomato catsup, remnants of
OnÂ© of Tolman's daughters was married
to a cook named R. H. Bonnell, and two
children were the. fruit of- the marriage.
One of these is jiow in. an asylum, and
Eugene, who weighed but two and one
half pounds at-, his- birth, -will probably be
sent" to join him. The, married life of the
Bonnells was unhappy and some - years
ago Mrs. Bonnell took poison. Her moth
er administered emetics, but Mrs. Bon
neil-died two -weeks later. . '

that. the. Bureati of Streets is expending

gregated only ?i22C58, of which $429 58 was
for. basalt' blocks' and gravel, and $797. for

In October, salaries consumed $9702 OS of
the .taxpayers' money and the results for

blocks .cost $796 09, horse, and buggy hire
$65, repairs to 1 Point I^obos road: $300, and
teaming and hauling- $1144 25. . . .-. . ..
"In November salaries ate up $9037 12 and

All through the house the same chaotic
conditions existed. Decay was eating. the
once fine furniture: windows were brok
en, .panels of doors were knocked,. out,
stairs were boarded over and plastering
cracked from ceiling to floor threatened to
fall at every gust of wind. ... :
Reigning all over this was Mrs. Tol
man, who, in response to queries, entered
into a long rambling discussion Of her
desertion by her husband. She made. all
sorts of claims regarding his affection
for other women, although he is past 70
and she but live years his junior. Her
long. blonde locks are scarcely tinged with
grÂ£Â»y. She wore ragged apparel.
Eugene was no better garbed. His coat
was many sizes too large for him. His
shoes would fit a boy ten years his senior,
and his shirt and vest, which were his
pride, were made to fit another.
"I got this new shirt on my birthday,"
he . proudly exclaimed. "I wore it ever
since." -,. . { . â¢:... "._. . â¢

Mrs. Tolmah's devotion- to .-', the child
was intense. "While . Secretary .White was

White left her,takingEugene with him,
leaving. McMurray : and Corporal 'Shana
han/,to serve the papers^ separating her
from, the child. It. was 'some - moments
before she realized ' what had -happened.
She rushed frantically to the street, still
calling. for the child. =Â¦ So violent did she
become that it was thought better to take
her to a place> of. safety. ; She was accom
panied by the two officers and allowed to
put on her coat, and throwing a shawl
over her head, she was first taken to the
Ocean View police station, where she was
searched. ' v . . -
In a pocket in the woman's dress were
found two purses. One contained $8 in
silver, and. the other $155 in gold and 20
cents in small change, a total of $163 20.
.This was a portion of a remittance of
$200 she received from a brother's estate
in the East, through the instrumentality*
of United States Attorney Banning, only
a few weeks ago.
For more than a year past Mrs. Tol
man *ind. Eugene have been cared for by
Mrs. Patrick Breen and her daughters,
who occupy the adjoining house. They
gave them three meals a day. carrying
the dishes from the Tolman house to their
own to wash, as long ago the Spring-
Valley Water Company stopped Mrs. Tol
man's water supply for non-payment of
bills. - Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦-.-.
One of the daughters, Sirs. Carrie Gad
jen, who lives in San Jose, came to the
city about the .time her -mother received
the money, but the latter" would not give
her a cent. Attorney Banning giving her
$5 to pay her expenses. Mrs. Gad jen has
a. son about 19 years of age, employed in
a restaurant in this city, who occupied,
one of the filthy bedrooms in the house.
,,'Mrs. Tolman has been a constant source
of trouble to the police and her neighbors.
Some time ago ,.she ,'was '-arrested for
throwing a cleaver and severely injuring
a child. She claimed that she threw it at
a chicken, and that- It .glanced off and
did the damage. She was released on ac
count of her age. Again she drove a po
lice officer away at the point. of a. large
carving knife. She was known to be pos
sessed of a pistol, and a search was made
of the premises before the papers were
served' on her, but : the .weapon, was not

.What might have been a disastrous fire
was averted yesterday" morning , by the
prompt work oli the local lire department.
, An alarm from box. 159 shortly before noon
summoned the department to Sixth and
Howard ' streets. , Smoke was issuing
from the Orlando House, a. three-story
-frame- building:, in dense volumes and for
a short (.time it looked as if -the entire
building was: <ioomed;to: destruction. A
second alarm was turned in and more en
gmes and apparatus reached, the scene.
After an hour's hard work the firemen
extinguished the flames.'
- The crowds that gathered round the
building- were treated to some exciting,
scenes. â¢ Men and women clambered down
the fire escapes and one old man- was so
stifled -by the smoke that he had to be
helped -down the ladder. Another excit
able" individual was about to jump to the
street below, but the shouts of spectators
dissuaded him from his rash intention. A
Mrs. Dean,: who' occupied rooms on the
second- floor, was startled . out of 'her
senses by the cracking of. the glass in her
transom.. She did not delay her departure
an instant. With a shriek of horror she
rushed out into the smoked-lilled hallway
and was nearly suffocated by the fumes.
She had presence of mind ..however, to drop
to her knees and managed to reach the
stairway - by creeping. The shock un- !
nerved her completely and for fully .an
hour she was flustered. -
Mrs. Mary. Carroll, the owner of the
lodging-house, was thrown into. hysterics
by the fire. The first knowledge she had
that the building, was ablaze was when.
John E. Cahill. a painter, rushed to her
room and told her .that the house was full
of smoke. â¢ They both went to investigate,
but were driven back by the flames. When
ihe fire was subdued Mrs. Carroll informed
RTire Marshal Towe that she believed that i
a'bedmaker whom she discharged fifteen
minutes before, the fire was discovered
had kept his promise. to get even by set
ting fire to the house. She stated that
he had been in her-employ but ten days.
She had discharged him because he had
become intoxicated.
Marshal Towe scouted the idea rafter
an investigation. He was of the opinion
that the fire was caused by some' one
smoking cigarettes in a lavatory which
adjointed a closet in which Mrs. Carroll
stored' her lamps and a five-gallon can of
coal oil. ' Â¦ â¢ _ . -. .
The building was damaged to the extent
of-&00 and was fully insured by its owner,
Orlando Bozio. Mrs. Carroll's loss was
nominal and .was fully covered by insur-
ance. ' / . ' . " . Â¦ .'Â¦â¢'" â¢ - . ..
. Box . 62 was i for a smoldering fire .on
the roof of a vacant house on the corner
of Stevenson and Fourth streets. -At 3:44
p. m. an alarm was rung in from box 261
for a small blaze in a house on Mission
and First streets. There were one or two
other, alarms for minor blazes.
