who felt happy. As the President passed
from his carriage, followed by his friends,
he had a kindly. nod for the.pollce and de
tective guards. . It was not the acknowl
edgment of respect to the President of the
United States; it was the thanks of a lov
ing husband to the men Â¦who were watch
ing over the safety and comfort of his
wife. -v
As soon â¢ as - the President . entered
the . Scott â¢ residence he went to , his
wife's room. As he entered the
the trained nurse in; attendance softly,
whispered to him that Mrs. McKinley had
slept uninterruptedly since his departure.
At that instant Mrs. McKinley awoke,
and the nurse left the room, leaving the
President alone with his wife.
Mrs. McKinley's Health.
Private Secretary Cortelyou received a
representative of The Call shortly after
the return from San Jose.
"Mrs. McKlnley, is much better," said
Secretary Cortelyou, "and she is improv
ing as rapidly as the doctors expect. "The
rest -is "doing her considerable good and
her hand is healing in good shape. Re
garding the programme for to-morrow,
th<? v - President will go to Palo Alto and
Burlingame in the morning and arrive in
San Francisco in the afternoon, unless
there is a change In Mrs/ McKinley's con
dition or a request is made by Mrs. Mc-
Kinley that the President remain with
her. The President; is much relieved by
the improvement in Mrs. â¢ McKinley's
health. He will not decide as to the trip
for to-morrow until the last^moment, but
will take the same steps as he did to-day.
The President is deeply touched by Â¦ the
sympathy of the people of San , Francisco,
and he hopes to ta^ce part in the original
programme of events commencing to-mor
row afternoon.*,'.
With the return of the President to San
Francisco to-day his .flag will be raised
from - the flagstaff in front ;of the Scott
residence. -All , over the city yesterday
the' Stars and .Stripes were flying from
house-tops. In the parkr facing the Scott
residence, Old Glory floated from the flag
pole, .and the/Jiouses in the vicinity dis
played'the nationalemblem. Â¦- At the Scott
residence,, however, no flag was \ raised
from, the 'flag-pole In front of the house,
the ! President .Â¦ requesting that this step
should oe deferred on account of Mrs. Mc-
President to San Jose, while Mrs. Morse
remained at the Scott residence.
Cranks Turned Back by Guards.
From early morn till late at night a
crowd of sightseers loitered In Tront of
the temporary home of the nation's select
ed head. The police and detective guards
had a few cranks to deal with, some of
whom had 1 all kinds of quack nostrums to
offer to Mrs. McKinley. Needless to say
that the intruders werd not allowed to ap
proach the house.
A tiny little girl, with long blonde tress
es, asked to be allowed to pass the police
lines and her request was gratified. She
carried in her hand a bunch of exquisite
roses and said that she wanted to give
them to the President and Mrs. McKinley.
The little one was kindly received at the
house, and came away with sparkling
eyes and proud face.
At 1 p. m. President McKinley left the
Scott residence for his trip to San Jose.
He walked to his carriage with George*
E. Morse and was followed by Henry T.
Scott and Private Secretary Cortelyou.
The President checked the cheering of
the crowd in the vicinity of his carriage
by waving his hand.' With a clatter of
hoofs the mounted police escort formed
on each side of the President's carriage
and the start was made for the depot.
Chief of Police Sullivan and Captain
"Wittman drove ahead of the carriage, and
behind came carriages bearing Secret Ser
vice Agent Foster, the President's per
sonal bodyguard, lqcal detectives and po
lice officers.
President Cheered En Boute.
The sight of the closely guarded car
riage attracted attention all along the
route to the depot. Electric and cable
cars ' stopped, while their occupants
cheered the President Windows were
flung up and residents on the streets trav
ersed tendered welcome to San Francis
co's distinguished visitor.
The depot at Valencia street was
reached at 1:25. A force of police officers
kept the crowds at a respectful 'distance
from the platform, where the President's
train was waiting. A loud .burst of cheer
ing greeted President" McKinley as he
stepped from his : carriage and mounted
the steps of his car, "Olympia." Louder
and louder grew the cheers, and the Pres
ident, with beaming, happy countenance,
â¢waved his hat in acknowledgment of the
reception. Two minutes after the Presi
dent had stepped from . his carriage J the
train was on its ; way to San Jose,' thun-

SAN JOSE, ilay 13.â Although It â¢
was for but a few minutes the
President's visit to San Jose waa
an event in the history of the .
city and one that will live long.
The President at 2:40; at
3:30 he was on his way back to the city:
but in the Intervening time there had
been a riotous, heartfelt, demonstration
which left the town in an uproar that
has not yet subsided., V-
In her reception dress the city i3
like some stolen arc of a rainbow.
It is not that the bunting flares in
the wind with hues unusually bril
liant and In quantity overstepping
previous display, nor is it In any
profusion or originality of decoration, but
It is in the combination of the carnival
red and gold mingling with the national
colors and the whole framed in a setting
of greensward, roofed with a sky as blue
as the sea and warmed in the light of. a
never failing sun. It is no trouble to dec
orate the city, for It needs but a palm
branch, flowers, a yard or so of bunting
and then all the summer dresses on tha
street. ' . .
Brilliant Night Spectacle.
It was at night, however, that the town
looked Its- best, for when the lights in tha
streets began to flash and the Chinese lan
terns to shine like glow worms among the
trees; when the air was filled with the
fragrance of flowers and soft music; when
the houses were alight at every window
and the streets were filled with a gay and
careless crowd, then the city caught the
carnival spirit and, filled with the excite
ment of the afternoon, began a festival
that promises to be the best of all.
The President came down from the city
after half-past 2, and as his car rolled in
from the north the remainder of the train
that contains the* other 1 members of his
party drew in from the south, and the en
gines met in the depot. The President and
the Cabinet officers alighted and the Sec
retaries at once paid their compliments to
the President and joined him on his way
to his carriage. The depot was crowded,
the streets outside were crowded and far
up the slant were more crowds on side
walk and roads, on steps and porches. In
windows and doors, all catching the cheer
that started at the station when the Presi
dent entered his carriage, it running up
the street ahead of him like a grass flra
before the wind. ' n
Tiny Flags Wave Welcome.
Up First street from the depot 2000
school children, each with a flag to wave,
were drawn up in line and they did wave
the little flags until the small arms ached
and they cheered and cheered until tha
small Voices cracked and the small
throats were dry. Then they Joined the
people, who broke into the street and fol
lowed the 'last carriage up to the grand
Btand.

PRESIDENT McKINLE Y will
make his official entry into San
Francisco this afternoon, ac
companied by the members of
his Cabinet. The metropolis of
the Golden State will tender a
Â¦welcome to the chief of 'the nation that
Â¦will live long in the memory of all -who
take part in it.
In the event of the President deciding
this morning that he -will not visit Palo
Alto and Burlingame to-day, he will this
afternoon proceed a few miles beyond
the city limits, in his private car, and
join the special train carrying the mem
bers of the Cabinet. From that time on
the official programme will be carried
out as announced.
At a late hour last evening Private Sec
retary Cortelyou stated that the Presi
dent would decide this morning as to
i visiting Palo Alto and Burlingame. The
President considers that San Francisco
Is the most important point in his trip
on the Pacific Coast and is most anxious
that nothing should delay the details of
the programme as arranged.
Regarding Mrs. McKlnley's condition
Secretary Cortelyou at midnight gave out
the following bulletin:
"Mrs. McKinley's physicians reported
to-night that their patient has passed a
more comfortable day than she has had
for several days past."
The marked improvement in the health
of Mrs. McKinley enabled the President
to make a flying trip to San Jose yester
day afternoon. In the space of four hours
and a half. President McKinley traveled
to San Jose, took part in the festivities
there and returned to the side of his wife.
Early yesterday morning it was report
ed at the Scott residence that Mrs. Mc-
Kinley had passed a comfortable night,
and the reassuring statements made by
Doctors Rixey and HIrschfelder on Sun
day night gave the President an opportu
nity to enjoy a well-earned repose. , ;
At 9 a. m. Mrs. McKinley awoke, and
her own words to the President were such
as to encourage the carrying out of the
programme of a visit to San Jose. The
President, however, decided to await the
coming of Dr. Hirschfelder and hear the
result of the consultation with Dr. Rixey.
Shortly before noon, the consulting phys
ician arrived at the house, and remained
.about a Quarter of an hour. As soon as
the doctors had informed the President of
the favorable condition of Mrs. McKinley
the President informed his private secre
tary that he would depart for San Jcse
at 1 p. m.
Word was sent to the railroad company,
and the President's special train was
placed in readiness at the Valencia street

A profusion of flowers was sent to the
Scott residence for Mrs. MeKlnley yes

ers decorated the porch of the house with
splendid specimens of rhododendrons, and
cut flowers galore were received.

Time â¢was pressing so the party was
driven to the station, where a special train
was waiting: to take the visitors to the
redwood eroves near Felton. The news
paper men of the party were put into car
riages and were driven to the grove over
the beautiful mountain road that leads
thither.
At the grove the young ladies of the
high school had laid a table with sand
wiches and cake and wine and lemonade â
a rustic luncheon in a most romantic spot
â and after the trees had been seen and
wondered at they were thoroughly en
joved and quickly disposed of.
For most of the party it was a first ex
perience in the redwoods, and for all the
prove and the ride thither were new bits
of scenery. The visitors walked around the
grizzly old giants, patted their rough and
rugged trunks, stuck knives into the bark
and, craning their necks, looked far up to
the sparse an3 dull green foliage, that,
like a shock of hoary hair, hid their
crests.
Pictures wer<Â» taken and souvenirs were

I suppose the telegraph has anticipated
me and that you have already learned that
the President was not able to come here to
meet you this morning. Mrs. McKinley's
health, which is not at any time what her
friends would desire, was so bad yesterday
that the President thought it best to pro
ceed directly to San Francisco, where she
might have the care she required.
Our own inclination would have been
to have the President with us eo that you
should not be disappointed. It was the
President who desired that we should come
to you and express his regret at being; un
able to meet you and to thank you for
the greeting you have prepared for him.
Bver since the President left Washing

SAXTA CRUZ. May 13.â It was a
bitter disappointment to the Sea
side City to-day when the people
learned that the President would
not be with them. It was
said at flr*t that he would
be here; then this was contradicted
and then changed back again, until no
one knew just what to expect. It was
not until every one had alighted from
the President's train and It was
found that Mr. McKinley was not among
them that the people gave up hope.
There were carriages "galore" at the
station, and a band and the Santa Cruz
division of the Naval Militia.
The sailors kept the line at the sta
tion, escorted the party up Pacific avenue
to the courthouse, again stood guard
around the carriages, and, whea that duty
was done, boarded the special train that
took the party to and from the grove of
redwood giants, and did sentry duty
whenever necessary â and they did it well.
The division was under command of Lieu
tenant Gradie Doyle.
The school children had been gathered
from all parts of the county, and, looking
their prfjfiest. they lined up along the
street anr threw flowers at the members
of the party and waved flags in their
faces as they passed on.
Hay Speaks for His Chief.
Secretary Hay and Mrs. Hay and Major
J. P. Parker rode in the leading carriage.
The parade went along Pacific avenue to
Cooper, where the courthouse stands, and
there it halted while Mayor Parker made
a short address of welcome. At the con
clusion of Mayor Parker's words Secre
tary Hay arose In his carriage and replied
briefly. Said he:

Mr. McKinley's Happy Speech.
Mayor Martin delivered the address of
welcome. The cheers broke forth again
when the President stepped forward to re
ply. Said he:
Mr. McKinley for some time marveled
at the wealth of flowers, for there was a
tremendous pile of ihem, reaching twen
ty-five feet up Into the trees and showing
all the colors that paint the gardens and
the hillsides. There were roses, sweet
peas, lilies wild and cultivated, carna
tions of every shade, geraniums of gor
geous red and pure white and a hundred
other blossoms lending their luster and
sweetness to the great heap of prettiness.
The President was then escorted to the
grand stand, end as he stepped to the
front rail and stood among. his secretaries
and the members of his party a mighty
cheer arose and shook the buildings, for
at last the people could look upon the
face of the nation's chief.
The grand stand was decorated in the
national colors and the red and gold of
the carnival. It stood on the side of First
street and at the edge of St. James Park,
and from where he spoke the President
looked over to the courthouse, where the
steps were covered with people and .the
great pillars standing before the entrance
were festooned with garlands of green,
dotted with brilliant blossoms. And in
front of the Hall of Records, j adjoining,
was as great a concourse.

and were driven throuRh the city. The
President did Â¦ not go far, ' however,' for
after riding with the party for a few

line and he was driven to : the station.
His -car "was ready, and without further
demonstration he entered it and was

San Jose expected more of a visit from,
the President, but, in view of circum

given a tally-ho ride about the suburbs
this morning and then taken to Quito
farm. They expressed great surprise at
the mile after mile of well kept orchards,
and said they had "seen nothing to com

Italian breakfast was partaken of at
Quito Farm, and the party returned to
Campbell and took a special train to the
big trees.
The Congressional party was taken In

orchards of thaÂ£ district to Campbell the
party was driven. A short stop was made
at Campbell, and here the Ohioans of
that place welcomed the visitors. Quito
Olive Farm was the next stop and under
the direction of : B. E. Goodrich, the pro
prietor, an Italian breakfast was served
the Ohioans. This feast was purely of
California products and the outing, which
was in the nature of a picnic, was great
ly enjoyed. Each guest was presented
with souviners in the shape of a small
basket containing a package of prune3
and a bottle of olive oil, grown on the
farm. The party then returned to Camp

the Santa Cruz big trees. The rest of the
party returned to this city about noon.

SAN JOSE, May 13.â This was a day for
Ohioans, and Governor Nash and party
and the Congressional delegation were
given the grandest reception they have
received on the coast. It was really the
uniting of the Governor Nash party and
the Congressmen In California, and it
was made an- event The San Jose Ohio
Society proved admirable hosts. This
evening the headquarters of the society
in the Courthouse' was crowded with
Ohioans, an informal reception being
held. .*jf8S
The decorations of the place were mag
nificent. A miniature of the battleship
Ohio, the body of which was composed of
3000 white La Marque roses, with masts
and fighting tops of red, was a feature.
Below it were banked calla lilies and the
walls of the rooms were ornamented with
trailing vines and roses. ' Light refresh
ments were served.
Governor Nash and party and the Con
gressmen were present F. C. Ensign,
president of the San Jose Ohio Society,
delivered a brief address. J. S. McGin
nls then welcomed the Ohioans and Gov
ernor Nash responded.
Governor Nash and party, who are
Carriages were in waiting for the party
and they were driven, through the grand
San Lorenzo canyon, over the world's
famous Big Tree drive, to Santa Cruz.
Arriving at Santa Cruz, the Ohioans were
taken for a drive around the city. At <he
depot was the special train to convey
them to San Francisco. The engine had
been decorated profusely with bunting
and flowers, while the Native Daughters
had attended to the artistic arrangement
of the interior of the cars. Every car
was festooned with ropes of roses and
other flowers, and huge bunches of the
choicest of blooms were massed every
where. To each lady of the party was
given by the Native Daughters a bouquet
of exauislte carnations. It was after 3
o'clock when the train left.
Under the giants of the forest an elab
orate luncheon prepared by the people of
Santa Cruz had been spread. The Ben
Lomond Winery had opened its cellars
and provided the best vlntaee. Fair
young misses from the high schools were
there and waited upon the guests. Gov
ernor Nash addressed the people and of
fered a few felicitous remarks to the
young ladies. An hour was spent in view
ing the monarchs of the forest and Gov
ernor Nash and party had the honor of
witnessing and taking part in the dedica
tion and christening of one of the largest
trees, which was given the name -"'Gov
ernor Nash."
SANTA CRUZ, May 13.â Santa Cruz first
entertained the Presidential party to-day
and then had the honor of offering its
hospitality to Governor Nash and his par
ty of Ohioans. The Presidential party had
just left the Big Tree grove when the
Buckeyes took possession, running over
the mountains on the regular narrow
gauge, train. At the grove the Presiden
tial reception committee from Santa Cruz
was in waiting to give them a reception.

A light supper was served during the

The guests of honor were: Secretary of

The ball was in charge of the following
entertainment committee: Hon. O. A.
Hale, chairman: Hon. Alfred Holman.
Hon. George P. Snell, Hon. David Hender
son. Hon. J. D. Miner, Dr. H. C. Brown,
Mayor C. J. Martin and Director General
Greenmyer.
In the ballroom carnival colors were
entwined with the national colors on
every hand. The red and gold were
looped over the front of the music
stand, lighting the green of the waving
branches which gave distance and ro
mance to the music that came from
among them; afjnve, the flag lent its
touch of patriotism as well as or beauty,
and along the walls the gold and red and
the red, white and blue mingled in sig
nilicance of the dual sentiment of the
hour and the man of the occasion.
Around the chandeliers were twined smi
lax and red roses and sweet peas, hid
ing the metal and giving them the ap
pearance of hanging gardens. There were
more garlands and flowers and ferns and
palms down the hall and in the lobbies,
and the hotel never looked fairer than
when ready to meet the nation's chief.
The carnival ball to-night was perhaps
the biggest affair of its kind that San
Jose has ever given or ever seen. It was
intended the President should be there
and to prevent more than a comfortable
attendance the invitations were limited
and very hard to get. It was to have
been as much of a reception as a ball and
the most complete arrangements had
been made to avoid embarrassment to
hosts or honored guests, and to have the
entertainment which his presence would
give to the people there. In his place,
however, were the Cabinet officers attend
ed by their wives, and with Secretary
Hay as the principal figure, the affair
progressed as If the President had been
there.
Beauty of Decorations.
The greatest taste was shown in the
decorations that beautified the halls, the
lobby, the broad stairway and its pil
lars, the reception-room and the ball
room. In the reception-room rich red
roses clung to the curtains and hangings
over door and window, ropes of smilax
were festooned over walls and corners,
branches of pink hawthorn blossoms
broke the plainness of the arches, and
flowers of every hue and fragrance made
of the room a bower of beauty.
lanterns that shone like will o'
the wisps under the trees in the park
outside to-night. On the grass before
the hotel colored fires burned fiercely,
throwing their glare into the skies and
fhlning wierdly against the tree trunks.
And the road before the hotel was filled
Â¦with hurrying carriages, the canopied
Fieps of the perch and the porch itself
were crowded by peering, criticizing peo
ple, watching the guests as they entered,
while inside the halls rang with the light
laughter of people whose only care for
the moment was their own enjoyment.
SAN JOSE, May 13.â It is hard to
say which was the prettier, the
green and flowers, the garlands,
the tufts of ferns, and waving
palms that almost hid the walls
of the Vendome, or the twinkling

TACOMA, May 13.â The Taklma Indians
will see President McKiniey and the mem
bers of his party on May 23. Word comes
from Fort Simcoe that at least 1800 gaily
attired men, women and children from the
reservation will visit North Yakima on
that day and do honor to the Great
Father. It is proposed that a war dance
be given for the amusement of the visi
tors. Plans have been made for a drive
through the â¢city, but many are asking
fcr the Indian dance. The Indians have
signified their desire to amuse the big
chief and his family with a war dance,
and this probably will be given.
The Yakimas have a grievance which
they wish to present. to the President. In
former surveys a large tract of land com
prising nearly 400,000 acres was taken
from their reservation, and thrown open
for settlement. Colonists located on the
lands and made homes. A large tract re
mains in timber and is one of the finest
bodies of . pine in the Northwest. When
a recent survey was made the lines were
properly located and the lands reverted
to the Indians. A commission sent out
from Washington, D. C, to make treaties
with the red men. offered them 25 cents
an acre for. the lands. As the lands are
very valuable the Indians desire to sell
their claims, and one of their number was
recently sent to Washington to see the
President. Â¦Â¦ Rev. Thomas Pearne, a native
Yakima, made the trip to the White
House and was greeted by Mr. McKiniey,
who. promised to send a new commission
to investigate the proposition.
The eonynissiqn has not arrived and the
Indians are getting uneasy about the mat
ter. They will call on the Great Father
as a tribe and show him their ponies and
fine feathers. They believe their lands
are as valuable as similar tracts would be
if owned by a white man, and have
spurned the offer of 25 cents an acre.

They were shipped to San Francisco
immediately and sent to the Palace Ho

It is believed that the President will
leave the city at about 8:30 on Thursday
morning. The trip will be made on the
new ferry steamer Tamalpais. At Sausa

school children of the county, the military
and the committee. According: to pro
gramme he will have an hour and a half
at the top of the mountain and will return
to San Francisco at 2:30 o'clock.
The committee will also have the ser
vices of Sheriff "W. P. Taylor, who will
have charge of the policing of the line of
travel. Sheriff Taylor will have a large
force of deputies under him for the occa
sion. The enthusiastic citizen who be
lieves that he can get close to the distin
guished party on Mount Tamalpais will
have a sad awakening if he tries it.
SAN RAFAEL, May 13.â The Marln
County McKiniey reception committee met
this evening and perfected arrangements
for the trip of the President to Sausalito
and Mount Tamalpaia on Thursday. The
principal point decided by the committee
was that absolute rest and seclusion will
be given the Presidential party on the
trip. The Mount Tamalpais Railroad will
be closed to the public on that day, as
will be the tavern on the summit of the
mountain. No trespassers will be permit

ACCOMPANYING the Presidential train- to arrive this afternoon are a number of representative "Washington corre
spondents, whose photographs are above presented. They may properly be termed the "historians" of this notable
Journey. ( *
, ' There are nearly 150 newspaper correspondents In "Washington City, representing all the important dailies of
this country, as well as some of the foreign newspapers. The President is extremely popular with the "Washing
ton press men and would have been glad if he could have extended an invitation to more of them, but the capacity of
the train was, of course, limited to a very few, so it was decided to bring only the representatives of the three routine pres3
associations furnishing news to all the dailies of the country, and the representatives of the three Washington papers. â¢
Howard N. Thompson of the Associated Press has for several years reported the proceedings of the House of Repre
sentatives for that association and he is well known to every member of Congress. . He is a graceful- writer and. some of
his biographical and obituary notices have attracted attention for their literary style. ' For several years he was Washing
ton correspondent for the Cleveland' Plain Dealer. ?
Henry LJtchfield West of the Washington Post is one of the best known and most accomplished newspaper men at
the national capital and one of the best informed. He is not only a most conscientious and energetic newsgatherer,
but is considered one of the most accurate and at the same time entertaining newspaper . writers - in Washington. He has
been president of the Gridiron Club, whose famous dinners are frequently attended by the President, Cabinet, Ministers,
Justices of the Supreme Court, Senators and the most talented and famous public men of the country. Mr.. West i3 uni
versally popular among his associates of the press. - . Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦
Walter E. Clark, one of the younger men, but one of the brightest, has not been so long In Washington, but Is-al
ready well known among public men. He represents the New York Sun's news-gathering bureau.
W. W. Price of the Washington Star is the representative of that paper at.tho White House. He has the confidence
of the official household and has contributed to his paper many exclusive stories. The columns of the Evening Star are
eagerly scanned by the corps of Washington correspondents every evening, and to the industry and ability 'of Mr. Price
they are indebted for many good White House "specials" which they have forwarded to their, respective papers.
R. H. Hazzard represents the Scripps-McRae Newsgatherlng Association. He is an entertaining writer and an es
pecially capable newspaper man in every sense of the word. He is comparatively a new man In Washington. Â¦ : Â¦ .
Another of the younger men is T. B. Lord of the Washington Times, whose work is rapidly making him well known to
the public men of Washington. He represents the Times in the press gallery.
Accompanying the party are also several photographers representing the various -weekly illustrated journals of New
York City. R. L. Dunn is connected with Frank Leslie's, J. C. Hemment with Harper's Weekly, J. H. Hare with Collier's
Weekly, and H. H. Strohmeyer with a photo-stereoptlcon company. These men stand high In their profession and their
names are, well known to readers of Eastern periodicals. . â¢
Morrell Marean is manager of the Western Union telegraph office in Washington and accompanies the party to see that
adequate wire facilities are enjoyed 'not only by the President and his official family, but also by the newspaper corre
spondents.
In the illustration above there are included three Stanford University, students and a Palo Alto committeeman who will
participate in the reception to the President at Stanford University.

SANTA ANA. May 13.â Perry Taylor of
Santa Ana has the unique distinction of
being one of seven men, so it la said,
who in the history of medical practice
has lived after undergoing an operation
for the removal of an entire lung.
Taylor is 26 yeurs old. About four years
ago he came to the conclusion that he had
consumption and consulted a local doc
tor, who treated him in the regular way
for a time for* tuberculosis of the lungs.
Later the physician became convinced
that Taylor's lung was affected with hy
dated cysts, and changed the treatment
accordingly.
An operation for the removal of the
cysts was then performed on Taylor, and
no less than 210 of them, ranging in size
from a small pea to that of a hen's egg,
were taken out through an aperture in
the patient's side. But more of them
grew, and although the operation ' of re
moving them was from time to time re
peated, it was at length decided to at
tempt a more heroic course of treatment
and remove the affected lung in its en
tirety.
The operation was successful so far as
removing the lung and the cysts was con
cerned, but a yawning void was left in
the man's anatomy.
Taylor Is getting used to doing with
only cne lung, and has devieed
a novel method of cleansing the pleural
cavity while the process of healing is go
ing on. His apparatus is a rubber tube
with a six or seven-inch long curved sil
ver nozzle, attached to an ordinary four
quart water bag. Just above Taylor's
waist on the right side is a vulcanized
rubber tube, which marks the center of a
large scar. Through this tube he Inserts
the silver nozzle and then turns on the
water, which contains a disinfectant.
After turning the nozzle around several
times so as to thoroughly irrigate his In
ternal economy it is withdrawn. Then
Taylor gathers himself up like a bucking
bronco, coughs, and there issues from his
side a column of water like 1 a miniature
geyser, which ceases at intervals only
when by a twist of Taylor's body the
stream is shut off from his side and finds
vent through his mouth with equal force
Taylor's general health is about normal
or as it was for a long time before he ever
dreamed of parting: with a lung, and he
feels confident that when his pleural
cavity is entirely healed he will be as
nearly all right as a one-lunger may ex
pect to be. Â¦ \j~

REDWOOD CITY, May 13.-The trial of
the action in which Messrs. Jarboe,
Crooks. Hearfield and Bannister are plain
tiffs, Poniatowski and Bullock defend
ants, and William Grant intervenor, was
commenced in the Superior Court at this
place to-day. The litigation is over the
rent due from defendants for a marble
quarry in Tuolumne county for the year
1899. The defendants admit the indebted
ness, but do not know to whom to pay
the money, as a claim has been put In by
the Intervenor, Grant, who lias served
them with notice that he, as a member
of the Columbia Marble Company Is in
terested in $2500 of the amount '"lue, this
being one-half of the entire sum. The case
promises to be bitterly fought between
Grant and the plaintiffs.
When court opened this morning, Attor
ney Countryman moved to dismiss the
complaint of Grant, upon several grounds,
the principal one relied upon osing the
refusal of Grant to attend before a notary
public and have his deposition taken.
When served with the notary's subpena,
Grant declared that he had already made
arrangement to be away on the day set
for the examination, which was a Mon
day, but that he would go before the
notary on the Saturday preceding the day
fixed and would waive the legal notice.
This was not agreed to, and when Mon
day arrived Grant was in Stockton. Upon
the showing made, Judge Buck denied the
motion to dismiss.
David Hearfield, one of the plaintiffs,
was called to the stand and had not finish
ed his testimony when the court adjourn
ed. Considerable time was occupied, in
introducing documentary evidence in con
nection with the testimony of wit
ness.
Hearfield said that on September ID.
1898, he. Grant and Bannister leased the
marble quarry to Prince Poniatowski and
T. S. Bullock; that for the first year the
rent was to be $4000, which was paid at
the time the lease was made: that the
rent for the second year was to bo $b000.
which had not been paid. Evidence was
offered to show that in January, 18H9.
Grant sold his interest in the property to
Jarboe and Crooks for $50,000.
The lease referred to was' executed 1 , by
the Columbia Marble Company, through
the three members, Hearfield, Grant and
Bannister. Hearfield swore that it was
executed by these three, and that the
words, "Columbia Marble Company,"
were inserted after the execution of the
paper, and without his knowledge.
Grant claims an interest in the rent on
the ground that the lease was made by
the partnership, whose affairs were never
settled. This Hearfield denied, and swore
that on January 6, 1899, the partnership
business was settled, Grant at that time
paying $2523.06 as the amount aue from
him upon the settlement.
The case will go on to-morrow, and it is
expected that testimony of a highly sen
sational nature will be submitted.

SEARCHERS FIND THE HULK
OF ABANDONED SHIP COLUSA
Wreck Recently Reported by Indians on One
of the Queen Charlotte Islands .Proves
to Be That of the Long Missing Vessel
NANAIMO, B. Cm May 13.â News of the
discovery of the American ship Colusa.
Â¦which was abandoned more than a year
ago, was brought to Xanalmo to-nipht by
Captain Walbran of the Dominion Govern
ment steamer Quadra. Acting upon in
structions from the Department of Ma
rine and Fisheries, a party headed by
Mr. Dempster, manager of the Hudson
Bay tradins post at Skidegate: the Rev.
William S. Murray, a Presbyterian mis

search the west coast of the islands for
The wreck recently reported by Indians.
Guided by the stories of a wandering band
of Hydahs they struck over toward Reu
nell Sound, the wildest and most desolate
part of the Island group. Only after a
careful search in the nooks along the
coast did they come upon the battered
hulk of the Colusa. It was completely
hidden from seaward by a tall cliff,
around the corner of which was a rocky
pocket sheltering the missing ship.
The discovery that the wreck is that of
the Colusa has but added to the mystery
of the derelict, for the Indians declare
that when it went ashore there were sea
men aboard, while the Colusa is known to
have been abandoned by her crew eight
een months ago.
The Colusa is piled high up forward on
the rocks and is split into three sections.
The mainyard hangs from the mainmast
in shreds of bleached canvas. The fore
mast and mizzenmast are gone close by
the board. The bottom is battered out and
ballast and cargo have slipped through.
Anchors, chain cables and windlass lie by
the starboard quarter in four feet of
water. Xot a vestige of stores, provisions,
furniture or gear is to be found aboard.
The furniture in the cabin is smashed to
atoms, except the principal table. The
crew appears to have stripped her thor
oughly before abandoning her.
Dempster and Murray searched all
around that side of Reunell Sound for
traces of any encampments, but found
nothing to indicate any human beings had
ever trod those sodden heaths. Dempster
says the ship looks as If she had been
there about a year, the timbers and cord

The reports of the two leaders of the
party being so circumstantial and the
other members having signed the reports
as correct, the Quadra did not proceed to
Reunell Sound, which is unsurveyed and
full of exceedingly strong currents. Cap
tain Walbran will make a full report of
the circumstances to the Department of
Marine.
The Indians who first reported the
wreck on the west coast said that two
bodies had been washed up and that there
were traces of a camp that had been in
habited by members of the crew.
CREW OF THE COLUSA SAVED
Ship Was Abandoned at Sea a Year
and a Half Ago.
The Colusa, whose dismantled hulk has
just been discovered, was well known in
San Francisco trade, having been owned
here for almost a generation. In 1SS9 she
was considered one of the most efficient
barks on the coast. At that time she was
under the command of Captain Backus,
who was one cf the principal losers when
she was abandoned in Alaskan waters. A.
H. Paul also was a heavy loser.
The Colusa sailed from this port on Sep
tember 6, 1S99, for the Hawaiian Islands.
During a storm she went ashore and was
got off with considerable difficulty. She
was taken to Kahului, where an exam
ination showed that her forefoot and part
of her shoe had been lost. It was decided
to send her to the Sound for repairs, and
accordingly, on September 21, she set sail
In ballast for Esquimau on what was to
prove her last voyage.
When the doomed bark neared Vancou
ver Island a storm arose and she was car
ried north before a hurricane. After float
ing about in a helples condition, at one
time in sight of Sitka's port, she was
finally abandoned by her captain and crew
on December 1L Four days later Captain
Evart, his wife and the entire crew of
thirteen men were picked up by the
steamer Sitka.
The bark Colura was built in Bath, Me.,
in 1873, was 1111 tons net burden, 197 fet 9
inches long, 3S fet 8 inches beam and 24
feet 2 inches deep.

As against the contention of the South

claims that notwithstanding 1 the deeds
from Phillips It is entitled to possession
of the street in question by *ight of pre
scription and that the company has long
recognized by aqquiescence the right of
the public to use the street. The records
of the County Supervisors were intro
duced to show that in 1375 First street,
together with other land, was declared
public property and a highway was es
tablished over it. Defendant maintains
that since that time streets have been laid

LOS ANGELES, May 13.â The trial of
th9 suit of the Southern Pacific Company
against the city of Pomona to determine
the right of possession of certain streets
in that city began before Judge York in
the Superior Court this morning. The
Issue which Is the foundation of the action
was made when on April 13 the Southern
Pacific- Company began the construction
of a side-track upon- property to which it
claimed title. This property was then and
had been for years used as a public street
and the residents and civic authorities by
force resisted what was considered to bo
an encroachment by the railroad. In order
to settle the property rights in question
the entire -- matter was referred to the
courts. â¢-- . *-,*Â¦'Â¦-Â¦

The plaintiff introduced its evidence to
day and endeavored to show that it had

dated September 9, 1S73, and another con

CHANCE TO SMILE.
Some of these reports may be exaggerations. We
shall have to wait until complete statistics collected
by the census officials have been published to ' deter
mine how far the evil tendencies have gone. It ap
pears a foregone conclusion, however, that the census
will not be encouraging to British optimism.
' Another evil has been noted. It appears that as the
natives of the kingdom emigrate to find better lands
and employment aliens come in from abroad and take
tHeir places. A recent report ,says: "The country is
being filled up 'with impoverished peddlers, money
lenders, and hordes from Western Russia, Germany
and Austria."' It is added: "Mr. Balfour and Mr.
Chamberlain and others have at different times spoken
on the subject, but the movement goes on unchecked:
Whitechapel is no longer an English settlement, and
whole streets are now found in London and other
large cities where not an Englishman resides." *
- The emigration of men has seriously affected the
social conditions of the country by leaving within it
a large excess of women, who, having no opportunity
to marry, are crowding the avenues of labor. For the
purpose of remedying the evil a society has been
formed to promote the emigration of women to the
colonies, and the Government is expected" to assist
in the work, ".Â¦â¢''i *Â¦Â¦
; Another evil revealed by the census is the decrease
in the birth rate. It is reported that the returns show
that despite the increase of population as a whole,
the birth rate has so fallen off that there are now
500 less births daily than there were twenty years ago.
It is added that in England and Wales the loss in
what is called the "birth force" since 1874 has been
17 per cent, while in France, whose declining birth
rate has been the subject of so much speculation, the
loss during the same period has been only 14 per cent.
That' such a movement has taken place* was not un
expected, for it has" been' noted 'in every civilized
country.; Even in the United States, where there is
an abundance of cheap land and where almost all
kinds of rural industries are prospering, the growth, of
cities has of late been very much larger than the
growth of rural population. In no other country,
however, has the shifting been carried to such an ex
tent as in Great Britain, and nowhere else is there
any evidence of such a diminution of the farming
population as to seriously threaten the general wel
fare. Â¦ '
WHILE full returns from the British census
have not yet been made public, enough has
been given out to add a new source of
anxiety to the country. It is known the census will
show that while the large cities have increased in popu-.
lation, there has been a more than corresponding
decrease in the rural districts. Agriculture is no longer
a profitable occupation in the kingdom, and as a con
sequence the families who have tilled the farms are
either moving to the cities or are emigrating to the
colonies or to the United States.
THE BRITISH CENSUS.
JOIN IN THE WELCOME.
AS was announced yesterday by Grand Marshal
Warn" eld, it is arranged that signal be given
by The Call from the dome of the Claus
Spreckels building the instant the column escorting
the President starts from Third and Townsend streets.
Bombs will be exploded, day rockets sent up and the
flag unfurled from the flagstaff.
At that moment the President of the United States
becomes the guest of San Francisco. It is desirable
that the whole city join in the welcome. Therefore
the owners of mills, factories and steamships should
immediately take up the signal and repeat it by
whistles and flags, so that the whole peninsula may be
made to reverberate the glad welcome. Every
â¢whistle and every flag should be made to unite in sig
naling the moment of the reception.
Let everybody be prepared. Let the people give
voice to their delight to honor the chief magistrate
of the republic. Let every whistle sound forth the
summons to patriotic throngs to wait along the streets
to greet the President with acclamations. Let not
one be silent. The universal joy should find expres
sion by the universal voice.
A NEW POSTAL RULING.
CONSIDERABLE attention has been given in
the East to a new ruling of the Postoffice
Department concerning writing contained in
any package or parcel intended for fourth class mails.
As samples of merchandise are included in that class
of mail, the ruling affects the business of a large num
ber of merchants and manufacturers, it having been
the custom for tlje past ten or twelve years for the
shipper to mark the samples sent through the mails
with the price and a few words of description. In
1894 a notice was sent out from the Postoffice Depart
ment to the effect that written or printed marks indi
cating the price were admissible on samples of mer
chandise sent as fourth class matter, but the' new
ruling puts an end to the practice.
A report from Washington says: "The assistant at
torney general for the Postoffice Department has ad
vised the postal authorities of his construction upon
the old law of 1888, and it is to the effect that such
marks must not be made upon the matter itself, or
upon anything inside the wrapper. He says that the
sender may write upon the wrapper or cover of fourth
class matter, or upon a tag or label accompanying it,
the marks of description and the price. His interpre
tation has been adopted by the department as law,
and any fourth class. matter prepared for mailing in
conflict with this ruling will be subject to first class
postage. Though it is nowhere specified, the word
'from' and possibly other words which may be neces
sary to indicate precisely the origin and nature of the
merchandise will be admissible when they are in the
proper place."
Commenting upon the new rule the Boston Tran
script says: "A fine distinction is made, it appears,
in the postal laws between samples of merchandise
and fourth class mail matter, but in the application of
the law it is difficult to observe this distinction, as
samples are included in the list of fourth class matter.
At the Boston postoffice the letter from the Third
Assistant Postmaster General in 1894? authorizing
the price to be written or printed upon the sample
itself will be looked upon as no longer in force, and
all marks must be written on the outside 'of the wrap
per or upon the accompanying tag."
The cause for the change in the ruling- is not ap
parent, but it is probable the privilege of putting
printed or written words on samples of merchandise
has been abused by .unscrupulous parties, Â«and the
Government has found it necessary to deny the privi
lege hereafter. The change is not . of any great im
portance, but all concerned .will do well to take note
of it in order to avoid having to pay .higher postage
than is necessary in sending samples properly, pre
pared for mailing. '
THIS WAS A HERO.
ALL the heroes are not in uniform, their action
quickened by war drums and influenced by all
mankind as an audience, and history as a re
corder.
The negro in Indianapolis who was caught by steam
carelessly let into a boiler where he and a companion
were working was of real heroic fiber. As the de
stroying scald poured upon them they ran for the lad
der to the manhole in their chamber of torture and
death. Phelps reached it first, but drew back and
cried to his mate, "You first, Jim; you are married,"
and Jim went first and was saved, while the deadly
steam cooked Phelps' flesh as he followed, and he
was drawn out of the hole to die. With his la^t
breath he said, quietly, "It was Jim's right to go first;
he is married." The man who in such peril, could re
member the wife of his mate and her mourning, and
die willingly rather than bring widowhood and sor
row into a humble home, was a greater hero than all

to rear another less lofty shaft over the dust of this
dusky hero, and carve upon its base: "It was right

DIVORCES AND MARIIIAGES-C. W.
, F., Oakland, Cal. There are no lato com
pilations that will give "the percentage
of divorces to marriages In California and
in every State In the union at this time."
To obtain such statistics would take a
great deal of time and Involve much la
bor. Take California, for Instance; It
would be necessary to communicate with
each of the nfty-four County Clerks and
Recorders to ascertain how many mar
riage licenses were recorded and how
many divorces were granted, and the
same process would have to ba followed
in every State and Territory. Then to
obtain "the rate of increase In divorces
per year" would necessitate a search of
the records for a number of years.
PATENT LEATHERâ R. E. T., City.
The first coats for the Japan for patent
leather are made with Unseed oil and
Prussian blue, boiled together for some
hours; the last coat or varnish, with Un
seed oil similarly boiled. Each coat Is
separately dried at a temperature of from
170 |to 180 deg. Fahrenheit and rubbed in
the leather by hand, the skin being nailed
to the surface of a board. The process
Is a very delicate one, requiring special
knowledge in each part of the operation.
To preserve the gloss and prevent crack
ing of such leather, melt wax with a lit
tle oil of turpentine, Olive oil and lard,
mix thoroughly, and when cold It should
be a thick paste. Vaseline Is excellent.
Allow it to remain on for one-half hour,
then rub dry with a piece of canton flan

freight, and our producers must get their exchange. Time, tide and trade 'wait not even for
the President, who, most of all who have held the great office, has given his attention to
the economic conditions which generate trade and has done so much to make us too busy
to tarry long, even in saluting him.
He gets here the sincerest flattery we can offer, in the energy and enterprise, the time
and talents given up to the operation of the prosperous conditions he has promoted. His
praises are not merely sounded by the trumpeters, but are uttered in the packing sheds
and the rattle of trade on the crowded docks. They are written in the passbooks of the
savings banks, where labor has accumulated millions since he became President, and in the
diapason of steam whistles on land and water, which summon men to labor, release them
to refreshment and utter "au revoir" as the Pacific liners steam through the Golden Gate
to the Orient.
r s O-JDAY San Francisco salutes the President and Cabinet, and srives the freedom of
the city to the Government of the United States. In. a certain very, definite sense
this city will become, for severaldays, the capital of the United States, for the
President and his constitutional advisers will here consider and dispose of such Fed
eral business as presses for attention. During that time the executive mansion is planted
on* one of our sightliest hills, overlooking bay and ocean and the enclosing 1 mountains.
The tour of the President has been wisely planned. After traversing the picturesque
American Sahara, where the misty distance and-inviting mirage pictured the actual scenes
that were ahead, he entered the American Riviera in Southern. California, where the re
sources of nature are ample for the production of all that exhibits the floral charms of cli
mate, and where the sunshine tempts to outdoor adornment and the enjoyment of life's
leisure. It is a scene that cannot be duplicated on the planet.
Emerging from it, to-day the President enters San Francisco, the busy, noisy, push
ing, progressive, industrial, commercial and financial center of the State's productive. zone,
and the New York of the Pacific Coast, destined to remain always , the metropolis of this
side of the continent, and the greatest city and center of Western civilization on the Pa-
Its development is due, primarily, to the productive part of the State, which is wholly
tributary to it. That production at first was gold. The placers were, generous yielders,
and the dust came here to pay for everything, from pleasure to provisions. Then the ledges
were unlocked and their treasure flowed to San Francisco. Here came the tens of millions
dug from .the depths of the Comstock, and the deep mines of the mother lode send their
monthly yield to us. As the nobler uses of the soil were discovered, and field, orchard and
vineyard took the place of the. flocks and herds that had grazed our valleys, the real gold
mine of the State was discovered. The productive soil of Northern California is a ledge
that never pinches, a placer that is never washed out, a source of wealth permanently po
tential, that will be in action after the gold-bearing rock has been followed so far into the
earth that the miner can go no deeper and live. . Then the grapes will still purple on the
vine, and the fruit will blush in the orchard, and the grain will billow like a golden ocean in
the breeze. The extension of irrigation will render the producer more and more indepen
dent of one season's drought, and the wide distribution of electric power, generated by our
mountain streams, will harness a new force to the processes that will continue to take
wealth from this exhaustless store. :
These causes make us a busy j preoccupied, commercial people. We are working, and
may lend ourselves shyly to holiday uses. But what we lack in grace and form we make
up in heartiness and sincerity. Our position, the great things that are with us daily as the
factors of a vast production, our study of markets, of competitors, of consumers and cus
tomers, .make us a very practical people, and our garlands may not be on straight; but we
can pay for them. As-becomes the metropolis of the greatest ocean and of the edges of
two continents, our population is cosmopolitan. The President can here see every order
of mankind, every kindred and tribe and tongue, from a Parsee to a State of Maine Yankee.
All are here from the torrid, temperate and frozen zones and the islands of the sea. Men are
here who were born under every flag that flies, and some who were born under no flag ex
cept the milky baldric of the skies and the stars that twinkle.. Yet all are living in obedi
ence to our laws and in loyalty to our standard.
If the President find the sidewalks more given up to packages of merchandise than
to decoration, it is because the great steamers that come and go between our docks and
the ports of Asia, Australasia, the three Americas and the far islands must get. their

Xm,- GOVERNMENT OF BRITISH COLONIESâ A PROFIT AND LOSS
ACCOUNT.
.The British empire comprises one-fifth
of the known land surface of the globe.
The number of people who live under her
flag is represented by the enormous total,
in round figures, of 400,000,000.
The possessions of Great Britain acros3
the seas are of three kindsâ one, colonies;
two, dependencies; three, protectorates.
The colonies .are of three classesâ one,
crown colonies; two, colonies with repre
sentative Institutions; three, self-govern
ing colonies.
Kinds of British Colonies.
1. Crown colonies â The crown has entire
control . of legislation and appoints the
Governor. The administration is carried
on by public officers under the direction
of the principal Secretary of State for the
Colonies.
Such are, in Asia, Straits Settlements,
Hongkong and British New Guinea; In
America, British Guiana, British- Hondu-i
ras, Falkland Islands, Fiji, the Pacific isl-/
ands and Trinidad and Tobago; in Africa,
the Seychelles Islands, Sierra Leone, La
gos, Gambia, Gold Coast and St. Helena.
2. Colonies with representative institu
tionsâThe crown appoints the Governor
and has a veto on legislation. They have
representative institutions suited to their
several characteristics and circumstances;
but the Secretary of State for the Colo
nies has control over the public officers.
Such are, in Asia, Ceylon and Borneo;
In America, the West Indian Islands of
Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Jamaica,
Leeward and Windward Islands; in Afri
ca, Mauritius; '.n Europe, Malta. (The last
two are also quasi-crown colonies.)
3. Self-governing coloniesâ The crown
appoints the Governor and has a veto on
legislation. They possess representative
Institutions and responsible government.
The Secretary of State has no control
over the administration nor the public of
ficers. !
Such are the dominion of Canada and
its twelve component provinces, the com
monwealth of Australia and its six com
ponent provinces, Newfoundland, New
Zealand, Cape of Good Hope and Natal.
. Dependencies.
â¢ These are of two kindsâ first, the empire
of India; second, "sphere of influence."
1. The empire of India is in no sense a
colony; it Is a splendid possession of the
British crown and an integral part of the
British empire. It consisis of thirteen
provinces and a number of scattered naval
and military stations. These are Aden,
with the Arabian and Somali coasts pro
tectorates, and Wei-Hai-Wei in China.
The native states' o' India are more or Ies3
dependent upon the imperial Indian Gov
ernment. These number C50.
2. "Spheres of influence," so called, are
Afghanistan, Beluchistan. Bhutan and
Nepal in Asia, and Egypt with the British
Soudan in Africa.
Protectorates.
These are all situated in Africa and are
a3 follows: Ashanti, Barotseland, Basu
tbland, British East Africa, British South.
Africa. British Central Africa. Bechuana
land, Nigeria (North and South), Khode
sia (North and South), Somaliland, Ugan
da, Witu and Zanzibar. - Each of these
forms a separate administration under
British officersâ some military, some com
mercialâbut subject to the neighboring
colony and under the control of the colo
nial or foreign officersâ tho latter when
questions relating to the frontiers of the
colonies and dependencies or protectorates
of foreign staiSB are concerned.
Other British Possessions.
The status of the Transvaal and Orange
Kiver Colony is at the present moment
unsettled. They will ultimately be gov
erned as are the Cape of Good Hope and
Natal.
Gibraltar Is a fortress rather, than a
colony. Ascension is ordered as a battle
ship of the British navy. Cyprus, though
nominally a port of the Ottoman empire,
and paying an annual tribute to the Sul
tan, is administered by British officers,
and, for all intents and purposes, it is
treated as a British colony. There are
also very many otWer islands and stations
which belong to the British empire and
are scattered everywhere. These are
places of call for merchant vessels, coal
ing stations, telegraph stations, observa
tion stations and tho likeâ useful in times
of peaco and tnvaluablo in time of war.
Such are Tristan da Gunha and Walfish
Bay. These arc administered, or visited
regularly, by British officials. .
Hongkong, Â£47,000; Mauritius. Â£21,500.
There are also smaller contributions from
a few other colonies.
Financial Position of the Colonies.
In far the greater number of the Brit
ish colonies the revenue is in excess of
the expenditure. The Dominion of Can
ada heads the list by a volume of above
Â£5,000,000. In- Western Australia the reve
nue and expenditure balance each other.
In the other Australian provinces the rev
enue is in excess of the expenditure. At
the Cape of Good Hope and in Natal,
owing 1 to the Boer war, there are no exact
figures to hand. Among colonies where
the expenditure Is in excess of the reve
nue are the Gold Coast, Jamaica and
Newfoundland. In India -there was in
1S98-99 an excess of revenue over expendi
ture of about Â£2,000,000. All the colonies
and dependencies are in the enjoyment of
public debts, small or great, and all have
had to resort to the mother, country for
loans, also great or small. These, how
ever, in nearly every instance are under
going a course of reduction.
The Gold Coast Colony.
The Gold Coast. Colony comprises the
coast of the Gulf of Guinea to the west
of the Niger. It has been in the undis
turbed possession of ; Great .Britain for
three centuries. Although the best gov
erned, and, until recently, the most pros
perous of the "West African colonies,, it
has been going through times of trouble
which have retarded its development. To
gether with the northern territories and
the two Nigerias, it sustained the last
'Ashanti war. This native state is at
length subdued, but the civil service esti
mate bears witness to the depression
caused by that enterprise. \ - <&
In a few years, doubtless, the Gold
Coast Colony will cease to be a weak link
financially in the mighty chain of British
Condition of Jamaica.
The history of Jamaica is checkered and
for the most part sad. It has been a Brit
ish possession since 1670. The population
numbers nearly 1,000,000, the majority be
ing black or colored. The period of 1856
1865 was one of anarchy. The blacks rose
against their masters, who -were hope
lessly beaten. The land, which rapidly
went out of cultivation, changed hands,
and the colored races ruled the Island.
During the period of 1S65-1888 a fresh start
was made. A new fiscal system came
into operation; the adjustment of taxa
tion, amelioration of the law of property,
in education and in internal communica
tions led to revived prosperity. But the
present day finds the blight not yet quite
removed. The revenue is greately affected
by the low price of sugar. In 1881 the
price was 29 shillings a hundred weight,
and" now It is only 10 shillings. Beet-root
sugar, produced in Europe under govern
mental aid-, floods the world's markets
and against this bounty-fed antagonist
cane sugar has no chance.
The year 1898 was marked by growing
prosperity. There was a considerable rise
in the price of cane sugar through the
imposition by the United States of coun
tervailing duties upon bounty-fed sugar.
Jamaica is splendidly placed for the ex
pansion of trade in spite of hurricanes and
other destructive visitants. The soil is
fertile and the climate salubrious. Social
condition and civic efficiency are alike ex
cellent. The people are sturdy workers
and are becoming . well educated. The
time cannot be far distant when Jamaica
will take her place among the prosperous
colonies of the British empire.
The Newfoundland Fisheries.
Newfoundland is quite the oldest child
of Great Britain's vast colonial family.
Discovered in 1497 by John Cabot, it has
ever since belonged to the British crown
and empire. In 1500 French, fishermen
made a settlement on the northwest shore.
By the peace of Utrecht in 1713 the sov
ereignty of Great Britain was recognized,
but the French were allowed to retain
the right to land and to dry fish on the
north and west shores. This right has
very greatly retarded the development of
the island. The expenditure of the colony
exceeds the revenue by Â£150,000 a year
and the public debt is considerable. Pros
perity can only be secured by the Impe
rial Government coming to terms with
France. / *

"The Bowery After Dark" Plays to a Packed House and the
Situations Call for Much Shouting and Applauseâ Terrible Terry
Is Ever Present Demonstrating His Clever Fistic Ability
NEW YORK, May 13.â Under reassuring
news from London to the effect that a
basis of settlement with Northern Pacific
shorts had been agreed upon and that J.
P. Morgan was lending the stock "flat"
for delivery in that market, the Stock Ex
change began the day strong.
The first trading was well distributed
throughout the list at prices generally
higher than on the close Friday. Union
Pacific sold at 116 a few minutes after 10
o'clock, showing a gain of $40 a share as
compared with Thursday's low point.
Developments In Northern Pacific are
awaited with the keenest interest, but It
was the general opinion In Wall street to
day that It would be some time before tha
question of control would be definitely set
tled. It Is believed that one party to tha
controversy holds control through the pre
ferred stock and that several Intricate le
gal points are Involved concerning the
right of the directors of the company to
retire the preferred stock at par and thus
deprive it of its voting power.
The rise In Union Pacific was accompa
nied by a similar but not so extensive
movement in Amalgamated Copper, which,
opening at 116%, sold up to 120%, an ad
vance of 5*i as compared with Friday's
clone. It subsequently declined to US 1 *.
There were selling orders In Union Pa
cific above 120, and the stock fell back to
H6V2. but an immediate rally followed. To
ward noon the market became quieter and
weaker and generally declined on small
transactions. There was no sale of North
ern Pacific common until 11:30, when a
sale of 10O shares was made at 160, an ad
vance of ten points from Friday's last
Â¦ale.
LONDON, May 13.â The Stock Exchange
committee and J. P. Morgan have come
to the rescue of the situation, and the dif
ficulty in which operators and brokers
who have given calls for Northern Pacific
for the end of May and July found them
selves is satisfactorily settled.
The committee decided that the "buying
In" of Northern Pacific common and pre
ferred be suspended for the present. This
means that the stock need not be deliv
ered Immediately. The committee also
fixed the maklng-up price of Northern
Pacific common at 140. Morgan la lending
Northern Pacific at "evens" â that is, for
nothing.
Decided satisfaction has been expressed
on the Stock Exchange here over the ten
tative settlement of tne Northern Pacific
crisis. /The representatives here of Kuhn.
Locb & Co., Powell, Jackson & Georger,
paid to a representative of the Associated
Press:
There Ia much nervousness In view of thÂ«
fact that the relief may be only temporary and
that another crisis may be precipitated by the
action of either Morgan or Harrlman. The sus
pension of the settlement' announced by> the
committee this morntr.s Is of indefinite dura
tion, but each day gained nelpa the liquidation
of accounts. The brokers who are th<j worst
affected generally hold options on Northern Pa
cific and they can realize In June and July. In
the meantime salvation depends on the leniency
of Mr. Morsran and Kuhn. Loeb & Co.
PROTECTING [WESTERN ROAUS
"Worked Out.
Flan Relating to Burlington Is Being
NEW YORK. May 13.-The Evening
Post says: It Is believed that some ar
rangement will be worked out by which
Burlington will be held so that It cannot
possibly be operated to Injure any of tho
western railroads. That is, the Union
Pacific will not only get an interest In the
property, but the St. Paul, which next to
the Union Pacific was most cerlously
jeopardized by the passing of Burlington's
control to the Northern transcontinental
lines, will share in the Burlincton con
tract, so that it will be removed absolute
ly as a disturbing- factor In the railroad
situation. It Is not believed that J. P.
Morgan & Co. will be displaced as the
Interest responsible before the public for
the management of the property, but
there was some suggestion to-day that
the alliance between Hill and Morgan,
which ha3 been of only about six months*
duration, will be ended. There is good
grounds for saying that while Hill has
probably retained the large interest In
Northern Pacific which he acauired last
summer, when the stock declined below 50
on the reduction of the dividend, the most
influential of Hill's friends in the direc
torate have liquidated their holdings.
They were, with Hill, who ia not a North
ern Pacific director, the most enthusias
tic advocates of the Burlington deal. This
was long opposed by the older Northern
Pacific people.

Seattle Machinists Strike.
IN "Barbara Frietchie" Mr. Clyde Fitch
has written a play which can with
stand the attacks of learned histori
ans and purist critics. As we look at
Barbara, especially when so grace
fully personified as she was by Miss
Chapman last night, we don't care to re
member â and we don't rememberâ that
during the Civil War she was not a beau
tiful young girl but a bed-ridden old wo
man. When we see the striking tableau
that closes the play, we don't care to re
number that it is utterly unhistorical.
\VhÂ«n we hear Stonewall Jackson's fa
mous utterance atout not pulling down
the American Hag, we find it impossible to
r< .memberâ at the timeâ that it never was
uttered as Mr. FJlch makes it to be ut
tt-ird. In short, the treatment is so dra
jnatically interesting that for the time we
emrc&y forget the unreality of the sup
l>csed facts upon which this treatment is
bfised.
J5o much of praise, and well deserved
ionise, for the play in general. In detail,
there are some defect* *Â°.o 'glaring as to
make on" blink. Most conspicuous of
lheÂ»Q is the awkward and entirely un
4ifcch?ary division of the laÂ«t act into
two bo<?no.s. the first of which, barely
ttitce minutes Ions, is much too short to
produce any serious emotional effect and
is followed by an interval so tedious as to
:r;r.kf; om- think seriously of coing homo
wfthcut w.'iitine for the Hecund scene.
There ure half a dozen wayti in which the
Jirwt HCcneâ evidently introduced merely to
U:,(\ up to the ihiK-ralHitii; incident- could

As to the rendition, Ml?s Chnpman, In
addition tci looking graceful und pretty,
jilayed with an emotional power aulte as
r'-nourcfful as the part calls for. Mr.
Nflll had little to do but to look manfully
handsome, and make love in that tcndcrly
deep deeply-tender volte of his: this he
can do without apparent effort. Miss An
rtrews made a capital darky nurse and
the three young ladiesâ Miss Forbes, Miss
Dean and Miss Blair, looked so bewitch
ing in curls and crinoline that one is loth
to remind them that the scene of this
play being laid in Maryland, young
ladies who are supposed to live there
should not Epeak with accent of Indiana
nor of New Hampshire, nor yet of Okla
homa. It Is feurelv not too much to ex
pect of an actress that she shall acquire
the dialect and accent proper for a play
which, like this, depends so much upnn
atmosphere. / .j. u
The third act contains two exhibitions
of physical suffering that were last nieht
given "at undue and painful length. These,
in my opinion, should be much curtailed
in the presentation: they certainly stamp
on the minds of the audience an lmjM-es-
Fion of nothing but horrorâ and that is not
what people go to the theater for. Gen

Columbia.
The second week of "Saff Harbor" at
the Columbia bids fair to be a conspicuous
success. Last evening the attendance was
pood. The drama went along smoothly
and the story was told so well that It had
tho effect of realism, with a peculiar fla
vor that commended Itself to those fa
miliar with the sort of surroundings that
make up the characteristic framework for
the pretty love story. Forrest Robinson
e.s Ben Turner, J. Wooster Dean as Frank
Turner, and Fanchon Campbell as Martha
all added to the favorable Impression that
they had earlier made. Messrs. Hodge as
Freeman Whltmarsh and GÂ«orge Wood
ward as Captain Dan furnished the com
edy element. The general verdict on the
play le that it Is excellently presented, al
though the story is illogical In its final
dt\elopment. but with enough pathos and
pleasing- variety to keep it In favor for
Jnore than one season. "Sag Harbor' will
run through the week.
Alcazar.
Milton Royle's Interesting comedy drama
"Friends" was again presented at the Al
cazar Theater last night to a crowded
house. It was produced â¢ the previous
Monday night on the occasion of the bene
fit of -St. Brigld's Church and the cast
last night was the same. The play Itself
is so admirably constructed, blending high
class comedy with tragedy so effectively
that the feelings of the audience are kept
alternating from grave to gay throughout
the four acts. Howard Scott as Hans
Otto, the drunken father, again scored a
great success and was honored with a
special call before the curtain after the
close of the third act with Its intensely
dramatic situation. It is an exceedingly
clever piece of character work. Joseph
Kilgour in the comedy part of John.
I-eden Jr. and Barton Hill as John Paden
Sr. were admirable and their dialogue was
refreshing. Charles Bryant as Adrian
Karje and Richard Scott as Harold HXnt
iiiff were well suited to the parts. Miss
Lila Convere was Marguerite Otto, and
her art was forcibly demonstrated in the
lights and shades of the part which she
&o elegantly portrayed. Miss Agnes Ran
k^n made a charming "little mother" and
Miss Georgie Cooper and Miss Gufba Dau
det. although they had little to do, helped
to make the piece successful.
Tivoli.
A large audience saw "The Toy Maker"
at the Tivoli last night and from tho
recognition it received thq opera is as
sured a successful run. From the time
tho curtain went up until the opera ended
tho catchy music and general snap of the
performance were delightful. Every mem
ber of the cast was cordially received nnd
it in not too much to say that Ferris Hart

the most pronounced hit of his career In.

thÂ« audience, and Is ono of the prettiest of

Arthur Cunningham, lending 1 a chorus
of rrenks, sunsr as he always does, su
perbly, and was enthusiastically encored
several times during the evening.
Edward Webb not only contributed to
the ludicrous features of the ocera by
clever and refined acting but sang rarely
well. Harry Cashman as Schwartzenbach
came into his own as one of the most pop
ular members of tho Tivoli company, af
ter an absence of more than a year from
its ctatre.
The decided features of the piece were
the two songs of Ferris IjTartman. With
six of his prodigies in the way of doll
making he was encored repeatedly in tho
first act for his clever rendition of the
popular ditty "When Ruben Comes to
Town." Again in the last act, when he
sang "Things I Never Did Before," he was
bi ought before the curtain more than a
dozen times.
"Of the many pleasing operas seen on the
Tivoli's stage during the reason none has
(riven greater satisfaction or is entitled
to greater praise than "The Toy Maker."
Grand Opera-House.
If ever there existed a tolerably good
play, hampered with an intolerably bad
title, that play is "Government Accept
ance." There Is nothing in the name to
suggest the humor that bubbles from the
lips of that realistic liar, N.' Tecumseh
Sheridan, or that purrounds with a halo of
merriment the wabbling figure of Cap
tain Paul Rainerd. These are the funny
characters that atone for the bad name
of the play and they are well handled by
Eromett Shackelford as the soldier and T.
J. McGrane as the jovial sea captain. The
serious roles are those of Robert Gordon,
the electrlciaH, who has a boat to sell
to the Government, and Richard Bund
age, his rival, and the execrated villain of
the comedy drama. Gordon, in the hands
of Jack Webster; is a hero -in plain life,
who carries with him from start to finish
the sympathy of the audience and Brund
age, as portrayed by Asa Lee Willard,
won not a few hisses for his clever imper
sonation. Florence Stone has the oart of
a vain but good hearted woman and Ma
thilde Choate does the widow Kingsley
most sympathetically.

ENGLISH SPIRIT
BRIGHTLY BURNS
fis-jy^HE heat was terrific at the Cen-
I tral Theater, last night. Belasco
Â§ & Thall's stock company, aug
11 mented by Terry McGovern, Danny
Dougherty and Joe Humphreys, in
the rare, perfervid, lurid melodrama, "The
Bowery After Dark," produced the excess
of thermal extrayagance. Four thermom
eters on' tho other side of the street
coughed their last and all the atmospheric
registers in the neighborhood showed the
ghost in a futile endeavor to keep pace
with the fearful, torrid drama that ran
four acts within the inclosure.
McGovern is well worth the seeing as a
fighter and doubly so as an actor. Inside
the "roped arena" in a single night but
one man falls to his vicious, earth-lower
ing swings and jolts. On the stage the
pugilistic vandal gives free morpheal
transportation to armies of villainous bel
ligerents. Big men with heavy, basso
rrofundo voices, Chinese conspirators and
all the rabble of the real, palpitating melo
drama fall before his mighty, forceful left
and right. There never was such a drama
as the post-sunlighted Bowery. It teems
with action, incident and situation and
must be seen to be appreciated. The 121
pound "Terrible" is in snd of it.
First of all the scenic effects is a saloon
on the bowery in which the plot is
hatched. The bad man. and he is the
perfection of black-striped villainy, wants
to sell his wife into slavery. On the pro
gramme he goes as a "refined villain."
Any old thing goes with himâ murder,
pills or strangulation. His wife is a
piece of monumental patience waiting for
his demise, naturally or violently secured.
It comes in the last act, when the Chin
ese accomplice perforates a dorsal artery
and then the entire company grows gay
over the prospective funeral, and the
rougti rider, Joseph Howe, holds Flora
Morris, the bad man's wife, in his arms,
whispering: "At last, at last, I have
you." All this happens at the ringside
after the "Terrible Terry" puts the re
doubtable lightweight champion, "Frankie
Kerne," out of business. Then comes the
denouement. Terry takes his wife unto
himself. The good man kisses the good
woman and the spectatorsâ composed of
steam-beer drinkers from the south side â
shout "long live the champion!"
There is not a poor one in the part.
They all shine with a light that possesses
sucli heat penetrating powers that much
fog and iced drinks are necessary to cool
the head after taking.
Opium joints, street scenes and the
ringside with sports and others congre
gated outside the ropes make up the
spectacular element of the play. Terry,

cry shoulder-swinger, to a Tuxedo-clad

dent Gompers of the American Federation
of, Labor and officials of several smaller
working trades other than the machinists,
considering the moral and financial sup
port to be given the proposed strike of
machinists.
' President O'Connell said the outlook was
very encourag'ng for a successful strike
in many localities. A number of firms
not now complying with the arrangement
entered into between the machinists and
the association of employers as to a nine
hour day signed to-day, and O'Connell
predicts that a large number of these will
have signed by Hay 20. He says the
Btrlko will affect at least 100,000 men di
rectly and moiv than that number of al
lied mechanics indirectly.
It is stated that the machinists will be
supported in lliclr struggle by the Ameri
can Federation of Labor.
NEW YUKK. May 13.â Secretary Wilson
of district 13 or the National Association
of Machinists was interviewed to-day con
cerning tlio order sent out Saturday by
National PreaMmt .Tamon O'Connell fit
Washington railing a strike of all ma
chinists throughout the country on Mon
day next unless Â»;mployers algned the
agreement for a working day of nine
hours and an Increase of 12V2 per cent in
wnges.
"There is HttU- doubt in my mind," said
Wilson, "that the strike will actually take
place, but the employers have until Satur
day next to come to our terms. That is the
last working dixy before the date set for
the order to go into effect. The figures
given in the Washington dispatches are
wrong. They fay the strike, if it takes
place,. will affect only 150,000 men. On the
contrary, it will affect close to G0O.OO0 men.
"The machinists alone who will be
called out will bo 150,000, but all trades de
pending on the machinists for their tools
will be brought to a standstill. An erro
neous opinion ptevails that this strike will
mean the practical stoppage of all work
on public buildings and great contracts,
like the rapid transit subway. It will do
nothing of the kind. In this district about
10,000 of pur men will be affected."

Samuel Daniels, assistant cashier of the
Bank of California, testified that on
March 29 the defendants' son deposited
$S723 40 in the bank and on April 13 drew
out $8400. Thomas H. Reynolds of the
Western Union Telegraph Company iden
tified a telegram sent by the male de
fendant on February 16 to William Bur
bank, Los Angeles, purporting to be
signed by the old man, as follows: "Don t
tell any of my business to my sister. She
is meddling."
Mrs. Gowdey, the complaining witness,
took the stand for further cross-examina
tion by Attorney Knight. She admitted
that on 1 April 18. the day she swore to
the complaint, she got a telegram from
her brother-in-law in Minneapolis stating
that the old man had arrived there.
Miss Tillie Rodgers, niece of the old
man, testified to arriving here. on April
7 with her mother from Minneapolis 'n
accordance with arrangements made with
Mrs. Jacaues. Mrs. Jacques told them
that Joseph owned eleven houses, but
nothing was ever said as to the old man
having any money.. Mrs. Jacques told
them that Joseph wanted to make a deed
in their favor to all his property, and if
they had not come young Jacques Intend
ed taking Joseph to Japan, to be out of
Mrs. Gowdey's way. April 11 Jacques sug
gested they should return home to Min
neapolis; and he gave her $500, getting
her to sign a receipt for $5000 and telling
her that the balance of $4500 would be
kept in the Safe "Deposit vaults for her.
The $500 was for their traveling expenses.
When they arrived In Minneapolis they
were surprised to get a telegram stating
that Joseph had left this city and asking
her to meet him and young Jacques- at
Cheyenne. She did so and took Joseph to
her home. Joseph had only $3 50 in his
pocket and she had to pay for his trans
portation from Cheyenne to Minneapolis.
In cross-examination the witness .ad
mitted that she had intended calling upon
her aunt. Mrs. Gowdey, here, but the
Jacques family would not let her.
admitted writing a letter on March 19 to
Mrs. Jacques, in which she wrote that
she and her mother were indignant at
Mrs. Gowdey for wanting to be Joseph s
guardian. She also admitted that on April
21, after her return to Minneapolis, she
wrote young Jacques that Joseph had
been airaid all the time, that Mrs. Gowdey
would catch him before he got to Minne
apolis. Miss Rodgers' cross-examination
was not concluded when the court ad
journed. The case will be resumed to
morrow afternoon.
The preliminary examination of Thomas
G. Jacques and his wife, Caroline E. Jac
ques, on the charge of kidnaping old Jo
seph O'Hare was resumed before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday afternoon. Nothing of
an exciting nature was developed.

The New Rochelle handicap will be de

Commencing at 10 a. m. to-day at Oc
cidental Horse Exchange, 150 head of
sound, fine looking horses will pass un
der the hammer. They were selected by
agents of the German Government for
service in ChJna nnd will be knocked
down to the highest bidder.
"Tim" Flynn of Trenton. X. J., formerly
a well-known starter on the Eastern
tracks, was a visitor at Oakland yester
day. Mr. Flynn is a prominent member
of 'the Order of Eagks and is here on a
pleasure trip.
Headwater and tbtf other horses owned
by Hughey Jones >vfii be shipped to Chi
cago to-day in charge of Charley Sanders.
The fast sprinter nas always been sent
to the post fit and I.s a tribute to the abii
fjv of Chprlfv as a trainer.
The deciding of the first three events
was marked by a bombardment of long
shots, Lou Clievden. Dandy and Flatterer
registering in their respective races at
odds varying from 10 to 15 to 1. Later on
in the exercises two favorites managed to
come through, partially restoring confi
dence in the market. "Pi" Ruiz upheld
his reputation by piloting three winners
over the bar, his excellent saddle work
being a feature of l.'ie sport.
Searchlight did not prove strong enough
to take the introductory sprint, although
a well-backed second choice. Saul of
Tarsus, the favoriti. was also detained,
potting along in time to finish third
After Searchlight, with Bassinger up had
led to the paddock he was challenged and
beaten a head by the 15 to 1 outsider, Lou
Clir-veden. nicely n Men by Stuart, fol
lowing his set custom King's Pal showed
speed to the stretch and quit.
Dandy, a chestnut colt by imp. Inver
ness and 15 to 1 in the betting, jumped
away in the lead at the start of the three
and a half furlong two-year-old spin and
was never headed. Remele, another lus
cious priced one, downed Autumn Time a
head for the place. Burns & Waterhouse
pent Cathello, an AUamax-Sweet Fayer
dale filly, to the post for the first time.
She was green and unused to the tricks
of the trade, though installed favorite.
Frank Weir didn't think Flatterer, one
of eisrht starters in the six furlong run
next decided, worth a bet and had the
pleasure of seeing the colt win easily at
odds of 10 to 1. Hoar rated him to good
advantage, skimmed over the border at
leisure, two lengths before the well played
Wardman. Alexander, on Princess Tit
ams. the favorite, early got caught in
the undertow, flashing distress signals the
entire way. Maresa was also bothered
considerably.
Ruiz on Rathos earned the decision
from Alicia and O c tler Joe in a three
heac! finish at the conclusion of the mile
selling run. He was fortunate in getting
away we!! and went the shortest route.
Z\"o doubt Alicia was best, but Russell
erred in not making his move sooner. He
then only beat Joe for the place by carry
ing the latter out.
Things came easier for Horton in th?
'â¢losing mile and a. hixleenth selling affair.
Matthews kept him closer up and catching
Gauntlet below the paddock finished half
a ler.pt h before the Randall entry at the
wire. The winner was a 6 to 5 favorite.
â¢j4- -ry I'GHEY JONES' crack sprinter,
II II Headwater, made hÂ«s farewell
if \ >ppeÂ»nÂ»nÂ«e fÂ° r * he season yes
il 11 terday at Oakland. He again
demonstrate that he holds the
fcppt in the sel!ing-plai.e division perfectly
j=afe. Because It va? thought he might
ho seized with one of his Furly tantrums
at the post the rin? posted 6 to 5 about
him. He did cause cne recall by wheeling
around as. the barrier was released, but
then relented and behaved like a gentle
man. Ruiz had thÂ« leg up and when a
start was effected indulged the 25 to 1
shot Byron Rose â¢with the lead to the
stretch. Headwater was then given his
head -and won laughing in 1:13% for the.
fix furlongs. Sly ran like a shadow of
her former self and injudiciously handled
by "Chub" Russell lost the show to Yel
lowtail by four lengths. Byron Rose,
which finished second, was backed from
25 down to 15 and is a speedy green 'un.

THE CULL'S RACING FORM CHART
Challenger Crosses. Line Five
Minutes. After Old
Yacht.
WEYMOUTH, May 13.*-The Shamrock I
to-day teat Sir Thomas Upton's. new boat
by five minutes and live seconds over a
triangular course ol' about twenty.- miles.
The only possible disadvantage to the
challenger was in the fact that she used
her old mainsail, which sits worse since
its salt water bath of Thursday. There
was no discoverable holding back of the
challenger, although once or twice she
pointed such a course as left the suspi
cion that the steersman was not taking
advantage of every chance. There is no
doubt the result of to-day's trial was dis
tinctly disappointing to those who had
pinned their faith to the new challenger,
especially as the Shamrock I on the pre
vious spins had not showed even equality
with the new racer on any point of sail
;jjg, with the exception of running.
\ he first leg ot tne course was from the
Portland breakwater lo the Shambles
lighship, the second to White Nose Point,
and thence to tne point of starting. The
old Shamrock 1/ad a length the best of the
start and held her advantage so well that
the challenger was unable to head her
and the Shambles lightship was rounded
by the Shamrock 1 forty-five seconds
ahead of the Shamrock 11. The run to
White Nose Point was dead to windward.
Captain Wringe was able to keep the
Shamrock I on the weather bow on the
new boat and held all his advantage at
the rounding of the second mark. As the
yachts squared â¢ away for the home run
the Shamrock I led by about a minute.
Down the wind the two yachts sailed with
jib topsails set, the old boat adding to
her lead throughout the six miles and
crossing the finish line five minutes be
fGre the 1901 challenger.
Amateurs on board the challenger were
inclined to be despondent over the result
of to-day's races. One who holds out
against this feeling, however, argues that
the conditions of the race were such that
the Shambrock I did nothing surprising
in winning.
"As is proved in the case of Valkyrie ,
III," he said, "those tremendous booms
and gaffs carried by cup-racers over
burden them in any press of wind or sea.
One day on the Clyde, in conditions very
similar, the Britannia beat the Valkyrie
III, although the latter afterward made
the closest fight ever made for the cup.
"The alterations made in Shamrock I
since her return are just such as would
relieve her of the worst part of this bur
den. I argue that had the challenger's
spars been changed iTi the same manner
for to-day she would have beaten the old
boat easily, while had Shamrock I been in
her American form she would not have
been anywhere in the neighborhood of the
line when the challenger finished. In
running and reaching the shortening of
spars was all in favor of Shamrock I, and
in going to windward the new yacht's
sack of mainsail left her no chance."
Mr. Watson considers to-day's results so
unsatisfactory that he had decided off
hand to take the new boat back to South
ampton and to have her docked In order
to ascertain whether any of the plates
were displaced by the grounding on Dean
Bank last week.
Opportunity will be taken to have her
new gaff and mainsail fitted. The work
will proceed night and day until it is
finished and the trials will then be re
sumed at Weymouth.

Some time in a departed and almost for
gotten century a Jacksonville railroad
came under the ban of a Georgia preach
er's disapprovalâ but continued business,
Now, the Georgia preacher was the
owner of a valise, a pasteboard thing,
painted and otherwise decorated to look
like a tourist's bag, and he went about
the world and south Georgia with this
bag, preaching , and riding on half-rate
tickets.. Moreover, the lovely valise ho
checked. .,. *
One dayâ It , was of a Sunday âthe
preacher descended from a passenger car
at a city of two hundred and eleven in
habitants somewhere, anywhere, quite in
time to observe, so he claimed, his cher
ished valise, fat with lean sermon3,
pitched from a baggage car. Following the
valise came a trunk, a drummer'i ele
phantine trunk, and it dropped full six
feet kerflummux on the valise. The valise
suffered cruel injury; indeed, it was de
stroyed, and the preacher's heart was
broken; so he put in a claim for $25 for the
valise, the sermons having withstood the
shock of tho catapulted trunk. :
The. railroad people at Jacksonville fili
bustered, and debated the matter, by
means of the malls, with the claimant. It
was suggested that the baggagemaster
might be . discharged, hoping thus, to '.ap
pease the clerical gentleman's wrath. < A
reply came that the railroad might, if it
chose,' discharge its president, its board
of directors, its passenger and freisht

Over Two Hundred Men Quit Work
on Four Steamships.
The ship painters went out on strike
yesterday and the work of overhauling
the steamships St. -Paul, Portland, Roan
oke and Zealandia was stopped as far as
that branch of labor was concerned. The
painters assert that they formerly were
paid $3 for a nine-hour day, but that sev
eral months ago there was a cut of 50
cents a day made. At the time tiere was
a promise made to put the "Wages back at
the old figure as soon as business picked
up, and on the first of the month the
men notified the employers that It was
time the old rate was restored. The men
say the increase was agreed to and every
painter expected to receive $18 for his
week's work last Saturday night. Instead
they were paid the old sum of $15. There
was much grumbling over the state of
affairs and at a meeting held Sunday it
was decided not to go back to work un
less $3 a day was guaranteed. The bosses
refused to grant the BO-cent advance and
the men to the number of over 200 walked
out.
On all the transport fleet the painters
get $2 50 a day for eight hours' work and
with that they are satisfied, but on out
side vessels- they insist on $3 for a nine
hour day. Outside men will be got to
paint the Zealandia, but the chances are
that the Roanoke, St. Paul and Portland
will be painted on Puget Sound.

Insurance on Bio's Cargo Paid.
All insurance matters in connection with
the wreck of the Rio de Janeiro have
been settled. The underwriters have paid
$900,000 to the owners of cargo, but the
loss on the vessel is known only to the
officers of the Pacific Mall Steamship
Company. There was $35,000 in treasure,
on which insurance has been paid, and
there was $30,000 more shipped by the Col
lector of Customs at Hawaii, on which
there was no insurance, besides a con
siderable sum belonging to the Mail Com
pany. It can now be set down pretty
accurately that the total loss was $1,500,000.
Raw silk was the article in the Rio's car
go that cost the underwriters most money.
Sudden Death of W. Cleland.
W. T. W. Cleland, chief clerk of the
shipping house of Hind, Kolph & Co.. died
rather suddenly at his home yesterday
morning. He was taken sick about four
davs ago and had to go home. His phy
sician found him suffering from typhoid
fever and nothing could bo done to retard
the progress of the disease. â¢ â¢ .
Mr. Cleland came here several, years
ago on the British ship Langdale, with
Ct' plain McAllister. He left the ship and
fcr a time was with Henry Bingham & Co.
SHIP PAINTERS ON STRIKE.
THE warships now In port are all
in readiness for the grand display
to-night. The Farragut came over
from Sausalito yesterday and dur
ing the afternoon her captain went
aboard the flagship. The captains of the
Wisconsin and Philadelphia also went
aboard the Iowa and all three received
their final instructions from Admiral
Casey. The Farragut did not remain in
the stream, but went back to her anchor
age at Sausalito. She will be on hand
to-night, however, and will help in the
display to be made by the big vessels.
Everything for the Illuminating of the
Iowa, Wisconsin and Philadelphia is ready
and a few hours' work will see all in
place. Each vessel will have her name
spelled ouf in lights along her side, while
the fighting masts and superstructures
will be one mass of fiery designs. Dur
ing the afternoon every man that can be
spared will be landed at the foot of Fol
som street. Both marines and bluejack
ets will then march to Fourth and Town
send streets, where they will take part
in the parade in honor of the President.
On their return to their respective ships
they will proceed to get ready for the
illumination of the evening.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
The sailing of the Pacific Steam Navi
gation Company's Guatemala has been
postponed until Friday next.
J. G. Donn, second officer of the Sher
man, went out as second of the Warren
and J. W. Maloney .third officer of tho
Warren is now second officer of the Sher
man.
The army transport Warren sailed for
Puget Sound yesterday. Lieutenant Ralph
P. Brown and forty recruits for the Sound
statiens were among the passengers.
Second Officer A. F. Dahlsted of the
Warren Is now chief officer of the Samoa'.
He is a careful and oainstaking navigator
and has earned his promotion.
M. A, Newell, the marine insurance
agent, will start for England In a few
days. One of the objects of his journey
will be to try to have the underwriters
agree to pay on any overdue ship that
arrives, no matter whether it is at her
destination or any other port. The Otto
Gildemeister arrived at San Diego
and later was towed to this port and con
demned here. Her destination was Port
lend and on the ground that she had not
completed her voyage but was condemned
on the way, the gamblers lost their
meney. This state of affairs Mr. Newell
will try to have changed while in Eng
land.
Water Front Notes.
The Tropic Bird brought up as passen
gers J. F. Schaar and wife, who had been
on a pleasure trip to the southern seas.
Two vessels arrived from Tahiti after
long runs yesterday. The barkentine
Geoige C. Perkins was thirty-one and a
half days and the Tropic Bird thirty-three
days, making the trip. The captains of
both vessels report light winds and calms.
Captain Jackson of the Tropic Bird re
ports that the schooner Defender put into
Papeete on April 9 short of provisions.
The Defender left Puget Sound on De
cember 2 last for Suva, Fiji, and arrived
there February 2. Three weeks later she
sailed the Hawaiian Islands and was
forty-five days out when she had to put
into the Tahitian port. Captain Darsters
told Captain Jackson that* he had had
nothing but light and baffling winds from
the time he left Fiji.
Barkentines From Tahiti.
Seven vessels from Hawaii and one
from Iqulque made port in a bunch yester
day afternoon. Of the sugar fleet the
bark Diamond Head made the best run,
coming from Honolulu in thirteen days.
The next best voyage was that of the
fcsrk Amy Turner, seventeen days from
Hllo, and then came the bark Santiago,
twenty-two days from Hilo; ship Charm
er, twenty-two days from Kahului; bark
Andrew Welch, twenty-six days from
Honolulu; barkentine Archer, thirty-one
days from Honolulu, and bark Alden Bes

and then with Herrlman & Mills. "When
the firm of Hind, Rolph & Co. was formed
he went to that concern and had been
with it ever since, Mr. Cleland was
highly esteemed by his employers and his
sudden death is much felt by every mem
ber of the firm. He was an upright, hon
orable pentleman and his death is a loss
to the shipping community. Mr. Cle

death was due to natural causes. In his
pockets were found three watches, one an
old-fashioned bullseye timepiece, a sil
ver watch and a gold one. One of the
watches had the name of H. W. Schultz

vln, J. Wentworth. William Patterson, D.
McK. Small and William Butler was filed,
in which the board is requested not to
make any appropriation for St. Mary's
square nor for what is termed "the so
called improvement clubs, as they ara
'fakers' of the worst kind; they do not
improve, but want the taxpayers to do It
for them."
The ordinance declaring the carpet beat
ing works of John McQueen on Albion
avenue a public nuisance was finally
passed.
A petition of taxpayers for the appro
priation of a sufficient sum in the budget

1% requested to render an account to this Board
of Supervisors on or before Tuesday, the Â£st
day of May. 1901, of the manner in which tha
funds heretofore set aside for the use of tho
board have been expended, for the purpose
of enabling this board to determine whether
or not said charges are true an 1 whether or
not the peoples' money has been wasted by
an expenditure for salaries out of. all propor
tion to the work performed.
A resolution was presented by Reed at
yesterday's meeting of the Board cf Su
pervisors, directing the Board of Public
Works to answer published charges that
the Bureau of Streets is expending much
moro money for salaries than for improve
ments and repairs to streets. The resolu
tion, which was referred to the finance
committee, follows:
"Whereas, The Boanl of Superrlsors Is about
to fix the budget fnr the coming fiscal year,
wherein will be allowed funds for the ex

WORKS BOARD
MUST EXPLAIN
1 he ordinance limiting the height of
buildings used for hotel or lodging pur
poses to fifty-five feet when built of non
lire-proof material was passed to print
after it had been amended to go into effect
thirtj- days after its passage. The bill
limiting the height of buildings used for
hospital purposes to sixty feet and pro
viding that they shall be built of fire
proof material was finally passed.
The ordinance fixing the amounts of the
bonds of the employes of the Board of
Public Works was finally passed.
The Star Press was awarded the con
tract to print the delinquent tax roll of
the present fiscal year.
The ordinance limiting the height of fire
proof buildings to 145 feet on streets 100
feet in width or more, and to 120 feet on
streets less than 100 feet, and of non-flre
proor buildings to 110 feet high, was re
ferred to the joint committee on fire, ju
diciary and buildings. D'Ancona's amend
ment to reduce the limit to 135 feet re
ceived no second.
Stafford said the Bay Coast line ran
through an uninhabited district, and Mc-
Carthy said he would oppose the grant
ing- of the franchise because It did not
provide that the company must change
its motive power to electricity within the
corporate limits should the board at any
time so decide. Hotaling suggested that
the amendments be drawn up in a private
compact, which Baggett' agreed to do on
the part of the company.
The ordinance granting the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
Company permission to lay a series of
twelve cross tracks and switches over
Bryant street from the company's yards
to the ferry slips was finally passed.
The judiciary committee was directed
to investigate the brakes and fenders used
on the street cars, in order to determine
their efficiency. Brandenstein stated It
was imperative that an investigation be
held to ascertain if the various street rail
way companies are complying with the
law in regard to safety appliances on their
cars.
"How do we know," said Reed, "that
this is not a scheme to sell out the road
to another company? We have declared
that the tracks of the Southern Pacific
Company axe a nuisance, and yet we pro
pose to give permission to maintain more
tracks."
W. T. Baggett, attorney for the com
pany, objected to Incorporating any
amendments in the ordinance, as it would
delay the work and prevent the expendi
ture of $25,000 between now and June 27.
Reed said he was of the opinion that any
corporation that would not tell who its
stockholders are was entitled to no con
sideration from the board.
The ordinance providing for a grant of
a rfgbt of way to the TZ-ny and Coast Rail
way Company to maintain tracks on cer
;uin streets, and to enter the city at
AWtnty-iourth and Illinois streets, was
Anally passed by the Board of Supervisors
yesterday. Reed's amendments that the
Â«-ost of keeping: the roadway in good repair
be made a lien on 'the company's prop
â¢erty; also that the company shall not pre
vent any other company from crossing its
tracks, in conformity with the city ordi
nances; also that the franchise -shall be
forfeited if the road Is not completed in
two years, and six other conditions al
ready regulated by the charter, were all
defeated.

WASHINGTON. May 13.â In the cases

United States Supreme Court to-day
passed upon the rights of the California
Mission Indians to hold land upon which
they have lived wh^n their claims are in
conflict with those of persons claiming un
der confirmed Mexican land grants. Har
vey, as an administrator, claimed title
under a grant in San Diego County, con
firmed in 18S0, and brought the suit to es
tablish the status of Barker, Quevas and
other Indians, who claimed to have been
on the land long prior to the making of
the grants in 1S40. The California Su
preme Court decided that the Indians had
no standing in view ol the recognition by
the Government of the validity of tha
Mexican grant and that decision was con
firmed by to-day's opinion.

Shows Appreciation of Sympathy Re

Lawmakers.
TOPEKA. Ivans., May 13.â Governor
Stanley to-day received a letter written
by Foreign Minister Lansdowne, at the
request of King Elv.ard VII. thanking
the Kansas legislators for their resolution
of sympathy over the death of Queen
Victoria. This is the third communica
tion the legislators have received from
King Edward since they passed their
resolution of sympathy. In the first they
were thanked for their "sympathy and
loyalty." They objected to this phrase
ology, which placed them in the attitude
of being loyal to the British throne, and
the King's letter was expunged from the
record. The King heard of this action and
expressed his regrets to Embassador
Choate, explaining that a subordinate had
sent out the wrong letter of thanks to
the Kansas Legislature. The letter re
ceived to-day is in proper form.

Board of Federation Will Be Appoint

Act.
MILWAUKEE, AVis., May 13. â The
Brotherhood of Trainmen to-day finished
its work on amendments to the constitu
tion. Under the new order of things the
grand master will be allowed an assistant
to be located at headquarters. The assist
ant will be one of the four vice grand
masters and will assist In executive mat
ters, including the settlement of all griev
ances. This will leave three vice grand
masters for financial work. Frank P. Sar
gent grand chief of the Brotherhood of
locomotive Firemen,, addressed the con
vention this afternoon.
The convention decided to readopt the
old plan of a system of federation of the
live railroad organizations for the settle
ment of grievances. Under the plan the
various organizatrons are to appoint cojn
mitiees of two of every railroad, the com
bined committees to be known as a fed
erated board. Should one organization
fail in the settlement of a grievance, the
federated board is authorized to bring
about an adjustment. Similar action is
expected to be taken at the Conductors'
convention at St. Paul, which meets to
morrow. Another important action calls
for the appointment of a committee on
legislation for each state.
TRAINMEN DECIDE ON PLAN
FOR SETTLING GRIEVANCES
At a conference recently between Briga
dier General Funston and General Lacu
na, in the province of Xueva Ecija, La
cuna promised to collect his forces and
arms and surrender as soon as possible.
The trial of CommJesary Sergeant Henry
Wilson on the charg-e of stealing supplies
Â¦was begun to-day.
A civilian, Sylvester C. Fletcher, an
employe of the depot quartermaster, has
been sentenced to live years' imprison
ment .in Bilibid Prison (Manilo) for selling
Government bacon and coffee.
It is considered certain that Colonel
Charles A. 'Woodruff, the chief commis
sary officer, had no connivance with the
contractors' frauds. The appearance of
his name is explained by the fact that
the contractors paid the renting agents a
portion of the rent for Colonel Woodruff's
house above the price which was named
to Colonel Woodruff. This Woodruff of
fered to refund when he discovered it,
having in the meanwhile left the house,
but the agents declined to accept it.
There have been several minor captures
end surrenders in Cavite, Batangas and
Tayabas provinces. A number of camps
and quantities . of supplies have been de
stroyed.
The treasury at "Washington has be
Â£run the payment of sundry army ex
penses, Including rents and rewards for
surrendered arms, formerly borne by the
insular treasury.
The United States Philippine Commis
sion finds that the Internal revenue col
lections in most of the provinces are not
sufficient tor support the provincial gov
ernments 'until the beginning of the col
lection of land taxes a year hence, and
appropriations of from $200 to $3000 will
be made from the insular treasury in
favor of several of the provinces. These
appropriations will be considered as loans.
In addition the provincial laws will be
amended so as to require a sedula of one
peso from all males over 18, half of which
Â¦R-ill go to the province and half to the
municipality.
MANILA. May 13.â The military offi
cials generally are seconding the civil set
tlements of affairs in the provinces, with
the notable exception of the province of
Bataan, where Major William P. Vose,
commanding the Sixth Artillery, has
sought to collect taxes and has not au
thorized civil government General Mac-

his unauthorized assumptions of author

Senors Tamayo, Llorente and Betancourt
said they thought that Secretary RooCs
statements were sincere and that Con
gress would not change the Platt amend
ment. The general tone of the discussion
favored the amendment, though Senor
Portuondo opposed It.
At to-day's meeting Senor Sangullly
criticized the "Washington Commission f<?r
not having made recommendations, in
their report instead of merely stating the
facts without making deductions.
HAVANA, May 13. â At a private session
of the constitutional convention to-day it
was decided to hand the report of the
Washington Commission to the Commit
tee on Relations to draw up a reply to
the Platt amendment. This committee
consists of .Senors VlHuendas, Tamayo,
Gualberto Gomez, Quesada and Silva. Of
these Senors Tamayo and Villuendas al
ready favor the amendment. Senor
Quesada. has been noted throughout for
his vacillation, he being an opportunist.
Th's commission previously drew up a
report against the Platt amendment,
which report was signed only by Gual
berto Gomez and Senors Silva and Vil
luendas, but the latter has accepted the
amendment and Gualberto Gomez says
that in view of the statements in the re
port of the "Washington Commission he
wishes to change his former report.

COLOGNE, May 13.â The Gazette this
morning prints a long article on -the com

Russo-German alliance in order to make
a strong front against the United States.
"This is a matter of .life and death," the
paper says. "The exceptional commercial
position enjoyed by the United States
should not be allowed to continue. The
United States is a most dangerous rival
for German products, especially in raw
and finished iron, and this should never
be forgotten in- directing the commercial
policy of this country. An entente with
Russia would provide the ways and
means to compel . America to conform to

voted to a discussion of the division of
work between public and private charity.
Controller Coler of New York delivered
an interesting address on the subsidy
problem in New York City. He said that
the system has been greatly improved by
intrusting its treatment exclusively to the
local authorities.
"A section meeting was held In the after
noon at Columbian University, the topic
being "Alcohol As a Cause- of Degener
acy." To-night at the general session at
Foundry Church, the conference consid

Their Homes." Professor John Graham
Brooks of Cambridge, Mass.," paid some
attention to the forms of charity which
require investigation and friendly visit
ing. "The poor," he said, "will never
take kindly to 'investigation.' No duty
of the visitor," he added, "requires more
delicacy and tact than that of learning
what has happened to bring the family
to want."

ALASKANS DEPIiORE
THE SMALLPOX SCARE
Steamer Captain Says No Whites Are
Afflicted by the
Disease.
SEATTLE, May 13.â The steamer Dirigo,
Captain Hunter, from Skaguay and way
ports, with smallpox' news, but no small
pox arrived here this morning. The peo
ple of Southeastern Alaska are much ex
ercised over the smallpox scare and are
makirg strong efforts to counteract the
effect of It on travel to Lynn Canal and
wav ports.
"The fact is." said Captain Hunter,
"that there is not a single case of small
pox among the whiles at Skaguay, Haines
or Juneau. There is some smallpox at
Hocnah, Killisnoo and Sitka, but these
cases are among the Indians."
LONDON, May 13.â War Secretary Brod
rick, in the House of Commons to-day,
moved his army scheme, providing for six
corps, with 5000 militia as a reserve and
increasing the yeomanry from 12,000 to
35,000 men. â¢ ...â¢ 'Â¦Â¦
The Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, moved as an amendment that
while desiring to improve the efficiency of
the army, the proposals largely increased
the existing burdens without adding sub
stantially to the military strength of
Great Britain. The galleries of the House
were crowded, many peers being present,
including Earl Roberts, the Duke of Marl
borough and the Marauis of "Lansdowne,
as well as many peeresses and wives of
the members of the House.
â¢ The discussion was regarded as disap
pointing, and Brodrick's -proposals ap
parently failed to excite enthusiasm.
The only really interesting speech was
made by Winston Churchill, who, follow
ing in his father's footseps, entered a
strong protest in behalf of economy and
against "ever-growing military extrava
gance."
Mr. Churchill created a deep impression
by reading Lord Randolph Churchill's let
ter to the Marquis of Salisbury on his
(Lord Randolph's) resignation, fifteen
years ago, emphasizing the need of public
"I am proud to raise the tattered flag
of economy again," he said, "and procesd
ing to point out that the expenditure lor
defenses had doubled since the date of his
father's letter, he asked whether the pop
ulation had doubled or whether the offen
sive forces of other nations had doubled.
He argued that the navy was England's
real defense, and that the reauest of the
present policy would be a weak navy and
a useless strong army. He declared him
self unable to support either Mr. Brod
rick's resolution or the amendment of
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. .
The House listened in impressive silence
to Mr. Churchill's, eloauent appeal. His
style of speaking is still unequal, but he
has the power to dominate Parliament.

ENGLAND'S ARMY
PLAN ATTACKED
City of Paducah sank In twentj'rfive feet
of water at five minutes before 10 o'clock
last nicht. in less than five minutes after
striking a snag: : while â¢ backing out from
Brunkhorst landing. The bodies of two
passengers who were drowned have been
recovered and twenty-two members- of the
crew, most of them negroes, are missing.
All of the officers were saved.
First Mate Tobias Royal of St. Louis
says only about twelve passengers were
on board, and ail were saved except two.
The body of Dr. J. W. Bell of Bell's Land
ing, Tenn., was taken out of his state
room. The remains of a young woman, on
which was a visiting card reading 1 "Mrs.
Harry L. Allen, 3430 Eads avenue. St.
Louis," was recovered from her state
room. Two 'friends traveling with- the
drowned woman, who started back to St.
Louis on the steamer City of Clifton, said
that the young Â¦woman was engaged to
xnaiTy Dr. C. A. Meridith of St. Louis.
Several hundred dollars' worth of jewelry
was found on her body.
The passenger list has not been recov
ered. A diver Is searching for it. Only
the texas and the hurricane decks are
above water, which reaches to the sky
lights of the cabins. All the staterooms
are completely filled with water. The
steamboat drifted a third of a mile below
the landing before she sank. The first
mate says tha boat went down within
three Jhinutes after striking the snag. He
was on the cabin deck and escaped by
climbing through the skylight.
It is supposed that most of the missing
deckhands, who were on the lower deck,
were washed down the river. The boat
lies -down about 100 feet from the Illi
nois shore, the fore part of the hurricane
aeck being under water. She appears to
be a total wreck.
The Coroner of Murphysboro, 111., is now
holding: an inauest while the diver is
searchins for more bodies.
Thomas Johnston, watchman of the
boat, who is said to be among the lost,
was So years of age and had been a steam
ooatman for sixty years. He lived in
St. Louis.
Relief Steamer Stranded.
ST. LOUIS, May 13.-The City of Clifton,
which took on board the remainder of the
crew and passengers of the City of Pa
ducah, had not put in an appearance at
her wharf here up to midnight. Captain
Massengale, the agent of the company,
said she was undoubtedly stalled at St.
Genevieve. 111., sixty miles below St.
Louis, owing to the low stage of water on
the bar there, in which event she would
have to wait until daylight before trying
to proceed. No additional news regarding
the loss cf life beyond that contained in
these dispatches iiad been received at the
office of the company up to midnight. A
message from the captain of the City of
Clifton stated that the bodies of Miss
Gardner and Dr. Bell had been sent to
Murpheysboro, III., for embalming, and
that the remains of the former would ar
rive in this city on an early morning
train.
All night long a crowd of anxious rela
tives and friends thronged the office of
the company awaiting the arrival of the
City of Clifton. Efforts were made to get
additional tidings of the wreck from that
vessel by telephoning to points along the
river, but they were unavailing. Divers
left here to-night for the scene of the
wreck.
MEET ON BOARD
GREEK WARSHIP
"I don't know how many there were
aboard, but think there were about
twenty-five drowned. Among them were
two engineers, one white woman, and
about fifteen negroes. There was great
confusion, and it may be more were
drowned. It is likely others of the
party 6aved will tell different stories of
the catastrophe. I 'was glad to get but
alive, and did not tarry at the scene. The
boat sank about 10 o'clock Sundas T night."
Two Bodies Recovered.*
GRAND TOWER, 111., May 13.â The
"I got on the boat at Landing' 76 to po
to Cairo. The boat stopped at Lake Ditch
Landing-, and again at Brunkhorst, which
Is only a few miles below Lake Ditch, and
took on corn. At both places about seven
teen sacks were loaded. After the corn
at Brunkhorst had been placed on board
the boat started down stream, and Just
as she put off struck a snag, tearing a big
hole in her.
"The crew then tried to place the stern
of the boat toward the river, and while
turning her around she sank. She Is about
thirty feet from, shore, and her cabin and
pilot house are above water. I Jumped
Into a skiff and got ashore. A Jewish
rabbi, his wife and daughter, got into a
ekiff and went to Grand Tower.
Story of a Survivor.
Prank White, whose home is in Kansas
City, grot aboard the boat at Landing T6,
north of Brunkhorst. He told the follow
ing story of tlie disaster:
Rev. Mr. Block, wifo and daughter,
passed through Carbondale this morning
on their way to Evansville, where they
will reside.
CARBONDALE, 111., May 13.â The City
of Paducah, a Mississippi packet, was
sunk near Brunkhorst' s Landing, about
four miles north of Grand Tower, at
;o o'clock Sunday night. Between twenty
five and fifty people were drowned, only
seven of xhose on board escaolng. The
City of Paducah. left St. Louis Sunday
morning on a downward trip, stopping at
several landings and taking on freight,
most of 'which was corn, until the boat
was -heavily' loaded.
About 10 xj'clock Miss Fannie Block,
who, in company with her parents. Rev.
and Mrs., Block, was going from St. Louis
to Evansville, Ind., was roused from sleep
by a sudden jar. She asked her mother
if her berth had broken, and no sooner
had the words passed her lips than water
rushed into the apartments and they were
compelled, to act quickly to .save their
lives. With four others they escaped to
the Illinois shore by holding on to drift
wood and swimming. The seven saved
are Hebrews. Rer. Mr. Block is a Jewish
rabbi. The seven survivors of the catas
trophe made their way down the river
bank to Grand Tower and aroused Mrs.
Baronowsky at the Tremont Hotel, where
they were given lodging until this morn
ing. They lost all their clothes and valu
ables, and had nothing but their under
wear and blankets, about them. Among
the drowned were about twenty-flve negro
roustabouts. The upper structure of the
boat can be seen above the water.

STRIKES SNAG AND SINKS
NEW YORK, May 13.â Schedules of the
assets and liabilities of John E. Searles,
who made an assignment to Edward F.
Dwight on March 5 last and against 'whom
bankruptcy proceedings â¢ wereV instituted
four days later, have been filed with the
clerk of the United States District Court
in Brooklyn. The schedules show on their
face that Searles' assets greatly exceed
his liabilities, being $3,616,545. He owes,
all told, $2,135,785. His principal liabilities
follow: â¢ -
Due the Southern Pacific Company, $100,
000; the Travelers' . Insurance Company,
$100,000; American Deposit and Loan Com
pany, $120,000; National Bank of North
America, $175,000; International Trust
Company of Baltimore, $327,500; Seaboard
National Bank, $100,000; Marellus Hartley,
$50,000; American Loan and Trust Com
pany of Boston, $50,000; Pueblo National
Bank, $41,617; West-urn National Bank of
New York, $90,000; Franklin Trust Com
pany, Broadway, $55,000; Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company (secured by mort
gage), $180,230. â¢ â¢ .
All of the foregoing amounts are se
cured either by collateral or by' mort
gage on real estate. The Southern Pacific
holds as security for its $100,000 claim 7
per cent preferred shares of the American
Fisheries Company, of the face value of
$75,000, and bonds of the Ironton Struc
tural Steel Company of Duluth, Minn.
The fisheries company collapsed last
year,. and it is not possible to say what
real value its stock represents. . Â¦ . v
The Travelers' Insurance Company,
holds 1400 shares of the International
Trust Company- of Baltimore, represent
ing a face value of $140,000. The American
Loan and Deposit Company holds various
securities, including American Cotton
Company shares and Sprague Electric
stock. The National Bank of North
America's loan of $175,000 is s'ftcured hf
stocks of the same general character, as
are the amounts due the International
Trust Company of Baltimore.*
The debt to the Seaboard National Bank
is guaranteed by H. H. Rogers of the
Standard Oil Company, who is himself se
cured by deeds . to real estate at Great
Hill and Cornuconia mine.
PEKING, May 13.â On May 10 the Chi
nese Plenipotentiaries sent to the Min
isters their answer to the demand- for
450,000,000 taels ($327,000,000), which was
made on May 8. The \ Chinese reply is
long, and it may be said on first reading
proves more satisfactory to a majority of
the Ministers than they had* expected.
The first paragraph states, that China
has not the slightest intention of trying to
escape the payment of her. just obliga
tions, that she is pledged to pay all legit
imate expenses of the allies and all dam
ages actually incurred by the foreigners
during the recent troubles, and will do so. 1 *
The third paragraph sets forth that the
resources of China are diminishing. The
Government in recent years was only able
to raise 88,000,000 taels ($61,000,000) a year,
of which 24,000,000 taels ($17,000,000) go tp
pay the war loan, and 16,000,000 taels ($11,
000,000) more to foreign obligations.
After dwelling at length upon the di
minishing revenue of the country and the
great number of outstanding obliga
tions of China the Plenipotentiaries pro
pose to set aside 15,000,000 taels ($10,000,000)
annually out of the 70,000,000 taels $(50,000,
000), to be paid to the powers in monthly
installments until the sum agreed upon is
made up.
Neither in demand nor reply do I see
any mention of interest. Those best ac
quainted with the conditions of the Chi
nese treasury are impressed with the fact
that the country can do no more.
Li Hung Chang is very desirous to have
the bills of the powers examined before
The Hague tribunal, but he has been
given to understand that should he make
this request foreign occupation will be
continued at a cost of several million
taels per day until the examination is con
cluded. ,

MINNEAPOLIS, May 13.â Vice Presi
dent Roosevelt has accepted an invitation

Heavy Increase of German Troops Is

BERLIN, May 13.â The Berlin papers
assert that readjustment of the military
forces of Germany on the Russian fron
tier is in contemplation, involving a
heavy i increase. The forces between Al
lenstein and Lick, now eleven battalions,
will be raised to nineteen.
LONDON, May 14.â "It is asserted here,"
says the St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph, "that at ,the request
of Admiral Aliex'eff the Russian Govern
ment is sending two more battleships and
four cruisers to reinforce the Russian fleet
in Chinese waters in anticipation of se
rious trouble."

upon and will further Increase the indebt
edness of the celestial Government. , In
view of the fact the necessity for expe
dition in determination of the Indemnity
question strongly appeals . to the officials
and diplomats In Washington. Tet China
is - expected to object to the payment ot
an indemnity of $327,000,000, and the United
States will aid her in her efforts to secure
a reduction. From all that can be learned
there is practical unanimity of Â¦ opinion
among: the powers that the loan which
China must make shall be guaranteed by
them and shall, be so distributed that no
one power shall have an advantage over
the others. Aside from the monetary fea
ture of the loan great political benefit
would be conferred upon any power se
curing the largest share. The proposal of
the Chinese officials, therefore, that the
loan be distributed among the powers ac
cording to the amount of indemnity each
will demand will probably not be adopt
ed. Well informed officials here estimate
that an increase of 5 per cent in customs
will produce $19,000,000, which will about
cover the interest of the proposed loan.
The loan will run for sixty or sixty-five
years. It is believed here that a settle
ment of the indemnity question will mean
the solution of the hardest problem of the
whole Chinese trouble, and the authori
ties are extremely anxious that there
shall be no delay in its determination.

tif I % l&jHggaffly W. D. Sanbons, General Agent. [lNEW TORK. May 13.â The stock market
roaile appreciable progress to-day toward that
condition of passitude which usually follows
such a violent convulsion as that of last week.
This was roost notably shown in the volume
of the dealings. The feverishness of the mar
ket and the wide extent of the fluctuations
showed that sentiment was still much unset
tied, but in t|iis respect also there was not
fo wide a sweep of the pendulum. There was
a pretty general upward movement at thc
opt-tiing, which might be sufficiently accounted
lor by the feeling of great relief o\-er thÂ«;
tidingever of the Stock Exchange settlement
In LonSr.n. As there was known to exist a large
short interest in Northern Pacific in that mar
ket in addition to large declines on other
Americans since the *aÂ£t settlement, there wa3
muco uneasiness lest heavy losses and failures
tfcould result. The news that a settlement
with the shorts in Northern Pacific had been
arranged which would allow them to cover at
14't was therefore an immense relief to senti
n.er.t in New York, which was in dread of a
reflex action of renewed disorder in the Lon
don market. After only a short time Union
Pacific began to absorb pretty much all the
buving demand and its buoyant flight of 11%
prom* began to arouse obvious uneasiness
among stock operators. After last week's ex
l*eripncÂ« the first thought aroused by any such
movement is that another corner is in process
of formation. The most conspicuous sharers
of Union Pacific strength were St. Paul and
Amnlfe-amated Copper. The former rose C
lioints and the latter 7. Meantime some points
of ".eakness. which had been moderately de
veloped early in the day, began to grow an<i
eprcad. When Union Pacific touched 123% the
buying demand for other stocks showed a not
eble decrease and was not sensibly revived
for the rest of the day. The selling pressure
was not severe as to volume when the reaction
pot in, but very wide concessions had to bv
made in order to direct sales of even small
amounts of stocks. In Rock Island, which
had advanced quite eagerly to 1% over Fri
day, there was a drop of 2% on "the sale of
only 300 shares.

"The dried fruit market generally shows
rather more activity and consumptive demand
is Â£ocd. Three-crown raisins are firm ami in
demand in a small way at 5%c. Two-crown

fered at that price yesterday. A little more
interest is taken In seeded also, stocks of
which are becoming light on the spot. There
it a la:r jobbing trade in these goods at 6%c
for C-crown to 6%c for 3-crovn. Prunes are
steady and selling fairly well. Oregon 40-50s
are becoming scarce and are wanted. There
Is very little demand for 5'J-6Cs.
"Choice Royal apricots in bags are still
wanu-d. but there is virtually none offering.
Considerable iworly graded dock is offering at

but buyers are not interested. Peaches con->
tinue in some demand. Some low grade goods
of merchantable quality can be had as low

kets yesterday reported higher prices on cur
rants and caused considerable excitement here.
Just what the actual advance on the other
tide xvas could not be definitely ascertained,
the cables being received by only a few houses,
but It was stated that 29s was the quotation

in the day was done at Monday's market, but
a considerable pert of the transactions, which
were about exclusively in Amelias, was at an
advance of about Uc. The market at tha close

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, May 13.â Weakness at the open
ing in wheat, which was at 70%@70%c for de
livery, was caused by heavy world's ship
ments, an increase in the quantity on passage,
liberal receipts and lower cables. When sell
ers, influenced by these matters had disposed
of their wheat, it was found there were buyers
in the market for more and under light offer
ings and profit-taking by shorts, the decline of
a shade to %Â©%c was recovered. The reac
tion caused shorts to apprehend some under
lying force in favor of values and this to
gether with reports of damage in the South
west, particularly in Kansas, gave a sharp
rally to a market that had ruled steadily up
ward. Under this acute reaction of sentiment
the price rose rapidly to T2c. The close was
lV4c higher at 71%@71%c.
Corn exhibited marked weakness at the open
ing, owing to lower cables and good receipts.
A strong demand suddenly developed among
the shorts, however, and a bull market was
the result . July closed strong, %c higher at
44V4@44%c. May was neglected, closing Uc
higher at 51%c.
Oats opened weak with corn, but rallied
quickly. The crop situation and the corn
strength were bull factors. July closed- Â»4c
higher at 27%c.
Provisions were dull, ruling easy for the
most part and closing firm In sympathy with
grain and hogs. July pork closed 12VJc higher,
lard 2V4c higher and ribs a shade lower.

WHEATâ The feature of yesterday's market
at Chicago was the news from Kansas City,
which wired that that market had advanced
on reports of dry weather, bugs and general
complaints by letter from many sections In
Kansas, Oklahoma and Indian Territory. A
member of the Kansas City board, just re
turned from a trip of the Commercial Club
through the three . sections just mentioned,
says that he did not see one good field of
Wheat, that Oats were abouf gone and that
Corn was being planted in fields where Wheat
and Oats had been plowed up. The dispatch
further said that everyone was badly scared,
and that there would be a howl it there were
several days more of dry weather. On the
strength of this bull news traders covered
their shorts and St. Louis and the Northwest
bought freely. The Southwest also bought.
The generally favorable crop prospects, how
ever, prevented speculative confidence.
The American visible supply decreased 907,
000 bushels. The world's shipments for the
week were: Australian, 95.000 quarters; Rus
sian, 257,000; Danubian, 83.000; Argentine, 127,
000; Indian, 400. This market stood about the
same.

ther notice, and fixing the making-up price at

Business in general was restricted to a re
markable degree. The tone, however, was
hopeful.
The American department was practically
Idle. Prices were wide In such dealings as
there were, but there were hardly any.

Tho mule, says Cosmos, partakes of the
qualities of the ass and the horse. The
zebra having now been domesticated. It
has been asked whether we can obtain
from it an analogous half-breed. Baron
de Parana has obtained one, and call3
it the "zebroid." The young animal la
now six months old; it Is a male of a bay
color with stripes similar to thoee of the
zebra. These stripes are well marked on
the neck, the head and the legs; those of
the body are not visible because of the
thick winter coat. The mane is black and
resembles that of the zebra. The tail
looks like a mule's but has longer hair.
The ears are small, with rounded points
like the zebra's. The haunch Is well
formed, rounded and quite large. The
chest Is long and high, which makes the
animal hold its head high and conse
quently gives it a good carriage. The
eves are large and full of feeling; the nos
trils large; the lips small and much like
those of Arab horses (the mare, the
mrther of this zebroid, was one-quarter
Arab); the head is small; the legs muscu
lar but delicate, showing that. he will be
very agile; the hoofs are small, black and
very hard. He is very lively but very
gentle and loves to be caressed. He eats
very well, not only in the stall but in pas
ture. These facts, we are told, are from
a communication made by the breeder to
the National Acclimation Society, which
is shortly to be presented with a set of
photographs of the new creature. â Minne

disposed of buds at the rate of $3 per

At this -season of the year, when tho

of course upon the dally breakfast table,
it is worth while recalling that its intro
duction into the United" States was due
entirely to the efforts of the Department
of Agriculture, whose attention was called
to it by a very observant and intelligent
American woman. This woman, while
traveling In the province of Bahia. Brazil,
In 1S68, observed that the oranges of that
province were much superior to thosa
roised in the United States, and mentioned
thl3 fact in a letter to the then Commis
sioner of Agriculture, a personal friend.
Further correspondence resulted in an
order for twelve young plants, which ar
rived in Washington safely packed in wet
moss and clay. All the plants thrived

of but sixteen oranges, but the fruit was
considered phenomenal in character, and

Mrs. Margaret Bannon, 41S Cherry
street, Philadelphia, decided not long ago
to have her 8-year-old son entered in Gi
rard College, If she could. Arrangements
were proceeding smoothly until the col
lege authorities in the usual way exam
ined the public birth registration for evi
dence that the lad was born in Philadel-
Mr's. Bannon had given the date as July,
1893 But the Girard College investigator
startled her by informing her that her
boy was a girl. That, at least, is how the
record made it out. The birth certificate
Identified the child born to Mrs. Bannon
as "Mary Bannon." Mrs. Bannon prompt
ly made affidavit that the child to which
the certificate referred was a boy.
Dr. Joseph Price attended her. He is a
very well-known physician and a very
busy doctor he has been for many years.
He must have been very busy on the
night when, with a scratch of his pen,
he wrote "Mary Bannon" and discredited
the sex of the little boy who would enter
Girard College. .
Colonel J. Lewis Good wrote to Dr.
Price asking him to correct his error.
But the colonel got no answer. So
the Board of Health passed a reso
lution asking Dr. Price in an official way
to make the correction, which If not made
will hamper the future of a little boy. â

The result of the inquiry has made the
whole thing clear. The solution was mate
rially aided by the clipping from tho
Paris paper already referred to, which
was inclosed in one of the letters. Acting
on the suggestion of the, Paris editor, a.
large number of French youths, not to
mention numerous widowers, had written
to the President announcing their entire
willingness to marry these Indian maidens
â ii-cluding their landsâ and bespeaking
the kind offices of Mr. McKinley to secure
them eligible wives. â Denver News.
The item went the rounds of the French
press, and an immediate increase in Pres
ident McKinley's mail was noticeable,
and it all bore French postage stamps
and was in the French language. Then
the French mail became burdensome, and
the President's private secretary, not be
ing a master of modern languages, and a
good deal puzzled at the extraordinary
interest that residents of the French re
public were displaying in Â¦ his superior,
sent a half-bushel, more or less, of the
epistles to a translator. When they cams
back in plain American the secretary was
still more mystified, but, observing that
the letters had some reference to Indian
lands tnd girls, sent letters and transla
tions over to the Interior Department,
where they were dumped on Secretary
Hitchcock's desk. That official was some
what alarmed at tirst. imagining that
complications had set hi between Franca
and the Indian nations, and ordered an
Immediate investigation by the most ex
pert talent that the department could
command.
An Item appeared in a Paris paper sev
eral weeks ago to the effect that there
were several hundred marriageable maid
ens in the Indian Territory whose Indian,
blood made each of them the possessor
of several hundred acres of land in her
own right, and that the hands ofthesa
daughters of the Territoryâ hearts and
lands includedâ could be had for the ask

NAMES FOR MONEY.
Coins Have Varied Designations in
Different Sections of the
Country.
Referring to the word "picayune," it
may not be uninteresting to give a sketch
of subsidiary coinage and currency as
used In the past, and the various names
under which it was known. In Ohio in
1S44 and previously there was a good deal
of foreign coin in circulation, mostly
Spanish, with some of the old State coin
age of different States occasionally mak
ing its appearance. One of the most plen
tiful of- these foreign coins was a piece
which passed for 6% cents. In Ohio this
was known as a flpenny bit, a contraction,
probably of flvepenny bit. The half dimes
of American coinage were also becoming
frequent at that time, and as a distinc
tion between the half dime and the flpen
ny bit the former was contracted to the
word "ftp." The dime went under its law
ful name, while the old Spanish double
of the fipenny bit was known as the "bit,"
and the Spanish . and Mexican quarters
dollars were nearly always referred to as
"two bits." The latter term, we .think,
still obtains in reference to quarter dollar
American pieces in some sections.
There was also a New York State "two
bit" coin, as we'll as a "bit" of the same
coinage, which was sometimes called the
"York shilling." The Pine Tree State
shilling, coming from Maine, was some
times seen, but not much used. Its value
was supposed to be 16 2-3 cents. The old
fashioned big copper cent . . of American
coinage was plentiful, while occasionally
an English halfpenny of copper was found
floating around, generally passing on the
same basis as the American copper cent.
Queen Victoria's .head was shown on the
English halfpenny.
Later when, as a boy, I removed with
mother to Illinois, I met my first
stumbling blocks in money names. There
the flpenny bit was the picayune, while
the flp had its proper name of a half
dime,- or five cents. Bu the larger coins
retained the old names, as did the copper
coins. As near as I can learn, the term
picayune originated with the French, who
had settled St. Louis and had settlements
all the way from New Orleans to Sc.
Louis and the further Northwest, and
their names for money predominated in
that region.
Still later, when I had strayed away to
New York State, I again encountered new
names for money. There everything was
based on the "shilling," which represent
ed 12 cents. A quarter of a dollar was al
ways "2 shillings," and all sums under
$10 were calculated on the same basis.
When I asked the price of board I was
told it ranged from 16 to 30 shillings a
week. The price of a suit of clothes was
gent-rally stated in shillings. That was
all right for the natives, but I confess I
had frequently to brush up my arithme
tic to get at what 33 shillings, 22 shillings,
17 shillings, or some other higher number
amounted to. It was all clear enough
when it was 2, 4 or 6 shillings, but when
it got above the dollar it required some
ciphering on the part of the stranger to
get correct results. Â¦ â¢
The three-cent piece, originally coined
in silver, came into general circulation In
the North about 1850, and was later made
in nickel, being coined in that metal
about the same time as the nickel five
cent piece.'
Some time bfore the Civil War the old
fashioned copper cent was replaced at
the mint with the. present small copper
cents and two-cent pieces. Later the first
nickels were made, but almost went out
of circulation during the war, and were
succeeded by the fractional currency of
that, day, issued in 5, 10, 20 and 25. cent
bills. These were never very popular with
the masses, and were looked upon by the
Government as a temporary expedient.
The most popular designation of them
was "shinplasters," thousrh in Memphis
and some other parts of the country they
were referred to as "chicken feed."âGal
veston News.
Royal Faces on British Coins.
When the coinage of her late Majesty
Queen Victoria ia superseded by the coin
age of King Kdward the design for the
reverse will be governed by the personal
taste of his Majesty, who also decides as

must be in profile, because it must look
to the right and left in alternate reigns.

Robert P. Flemmlng; . "captain" by
courtesy, hail fellow well met about town
and superintendent of the Sunset Tele
phone Company by occupation, is not go
ing to have his Insolvency petition grant
ed without opposition. The captain sur
prised his frlerfds a few weeks ago by fil
ing a petition in insolvency In which he
declared that he owed $1,209 60, while he
possessed but $350 worth of property
which was exempt from execution. As
Captain Flemming baa been the superin
tendent of the telephone company for
a great many years, and during a portion
of this time was the manager as well,
and during all of the time has been in
receipt of the largest salary paid on this
side of the bay by the people he repre
sented, some of his creditors have decided
tnat it might be well for the captain to
make some explanations In detail as to
why he \*ants to become Insolvent in the
eyes of the law.
The hearing of the captain's petition
was set for to-day before A. P. Holland,
United States Commissioner in Bank
ruptcy, and George W. Reed, represent
ing Hiram A. Tubbs, the largest creditor,
made an appearance in the case. Mr.
Reed wanted a continuance and a trus
tee appointed and intimated- very strongly,
tnat an order of examination would be
adked for. Mr. Tubbs is the holder of
a note made by . Captain Flemming for
$518 and he wants to know something
about his chances of getting the money.
B. H. Griffiths was appointed trustee
for the property of the insolvent until
the hearing could be had at some future
date.
The list of Captain Flemming's debts
runs through laundry bills, gas, coal,
bread, doctors' accounts, clothing bills
and all kinds of family and household
expenses. The list is as follows:

The Builders' Exchange will contribute
an arch on Broadway near Tenth street,

quarters. It will be covered with patri

the President In the center, both sides to

efforts to get houses and streets dressed,
and the regularly ordained street decora
tion committeemen lie awake nights
thinking what they will do the next day.
Oakland will make a creditable show
ing, considering the President gives it
only a very little bit of his time. The
President will not be astonished at what
he sees, but he will be pleased.
The street decoration committee has, of
course, devoted all its energy to the down
town streets. Broadway from Fourteenth
street to the estuary, and Fourteenth
street from Broadway to the High School,
have been canopied with flags running
across the street from building to build
ing:. The already striking effect will bo
strengthened by the addition of streamers
of red, white and blue bunting stretched
at an angle from the trolley guard-wires
in the center of the streets to the poles
on either side of them. At intervals clus
ters of American flags will adorn the tops
of the trolley poles. Altogether, the effect
is going to be quite pleasing.
United States Senator George C. Per
kins, Congressman Victor H. Metcalf and
Edson F. Adams, chairman of the execu
tive committee, went to San Francisco to
day to see what could be done. A con

BERKELEY'S BECEPTTON
TO PRESIDENT McKINLEY
But seats are being spld and the prices
are going up and some who secured
bunches under false names and by similar
schemes are making a nice little harvest
from the President's visit to Berkeley
* â . J
such that It became almost a question of
first come, first served. The applications
so outnumbered the seats to be disposed
Â°r that the task became a hopeless one.
This committee Is very much disturbed
by the fact that seats secured without cost
from the university are being sold in reg
ular ticket brokerage style. The commit
tee is unable to prevent this, and if some
secured tickets under false names with the
object of selling them, or disposed of the
seats given them individually for a cash
return, the committee of the faculty can
not prevent it.
BERKELEY, May 13.â The tickets for
the commencement day exercises of the
State University have all been given out
Jay the authorities and are now being
hawked about Berkeley and sold for
money to those who have been disappoint
ed. Tickets that were given out by the
university authorities are now being sold
for as high as $5 a seat, and a neat little
speculation is now going- on by those who

City Attorney Johnson has submitted a
stipulation covering the proposed compro
mise on water bills to the counsel for the
water company. The stipulation will not
be made public until the attorneys have
satisfied themselves upon Its terms. The
City Attorney said he expected the docu
ment would be returned to him to-mor
row.
The Council tÂ«-night, in committee of
the whole, recommended that plans be
adopted for a storm water sewer to be
constructed on Adeline street from Sixty
first street to Temescal Creek. The San
Pablo avenue storm water sewer scheme,
from Fifty-sixth street to Temescal Creek,
was eliminated. A committee composed
of City Attorney Johnson, City Engineer
Turner, Councilmen Bon anoVRuch was
appointed to handle the main sewer pro
ject through Emeryville.
Resolved, That this Council does adjourn to
night with the sincere hope for the speedy re
covery of Mrs. McKinley, the dear and be
loved wife of the President of the United States.
OAKLAND, May 13.â The City Council
to-night, upon motion of Councilman C.
A. Bon, adopted the following resolution:
COUNCIL ADJOURNS WITH
TRIBUTE TO MRS. McKINLEY
From Mrs. Smith also the committee
have accepted the offer of a landau anS
four-in-hand to be used by PresldentMc-
Kinley while in Oakland.
The national colors will be followed as
far as possible in the selection of the
flowers to be used in decorating the pillars
and in constructing the festoons and
canopy. . v ..
"I wanted to do it for the President,"
said Mrs. Smith. "I have been afraid that
the mechanical details were going to
baffle ub; I can plan an outline and color
scheme, but must ask to be excused from
the practical part of its execution. It
seems to be all satisfactorily arranged
now."
Mrs. Smith has thrown open the treas
ures of the Arbor Villa gardens for the
materials to be used in the canopy.
Hurried consultations resulted in a com
promise. A tall pole will be raised in the
middle of the open space. At its top will
be a great globe of ferns and blossoms,
like a floral balloon held captive by great
festoons of flowers and evergreens,
stretched from the trolley poles at the
four street corners, the whole piece thus
being kept clear of the electric wires. At
the intersection of ihe festoons, beneath
the globe, will be wreathed the canopy of
flowers and greenery. -â¢*
The supporting poles will be twined with
floral ropes and banked with palms.
This floral piece, the principal feature
of the decorations or. McKinley day, has
been the subject of much planning. Mrs.
Smith wanted to show her patriotism in
some suitable way on the occasion of the
President's visit and the idea that some
thing distinctive in tne scheme of decora
tions should be entrusted to a woman ap
pealed to the committee. It suggested an
arch. Mrs. Smith at once acquiesced and
sent her gardener to consult with the
committee as to delails. The committee
wanted the arch placed at Fourteenth
and Broadway, to serve as a gateway to
the downtown portion of the city as the
Presidential party came from the Perkins
reception. When the man of floral orna
mentation viewed the proposed location
he at once pointed out the fact that to
place an arch there would block the city's
electric railway traJRc for two days at
least as the trolley wires would have to
be taken down.
When the Presidential procession swings
into the city's principal thoroughfare it
will pass under a floral canopy spanning
th^ wide snace at Fourteenth and Broad
way, the offering of Mrs. F. M. Smith of
Arbor Villa.
Under a Floral Canopy.
."If everybody would decorate," said A.
S.' Macdonald, chairman of the street dec
orating committee, "we would have a gay
city. I think everybody will fall in line,

Gulling the "Foreign Devils."
When .Chinese affairs,, became interest
ing the editor of ah enterprising American
journal decided to j employ a Chinese for
the benefit of his countrymen in the
United States. The yellow. -vviter was a
rather Costly addition to the staff, but his
contributions were looked forward to with
much interest 'in all parts where Celec
tlals congregate. . Â¦
The Chinese. were delighted with what
they- read, and it was some ' time before
the "foreign devils," who also looked,
upon the strange . characters with curios
ity, were! able to learn "the meaning of
them. The first article began:
' "If these lines meet the eyes of one of
our brother Chinese let him accept the
salutation of the author and let him re
ceive "the blessings of the ninety-seven,
gods. . If a dog of a Christian asks him
about the present article he should reply
that it refers to great battles, -Â¦ ruinous
and bldody, between Â¦ the Japanese and
Chinese. This .journal belongs to a
cursed Christian and. is not even worthy
to be spat upon by. a self-respecting Chi
nese." < - -â¢* -.' Â¦*,â¢"-.?Â«â¢-. - Â¦ * * Â¦ -

CONVICTS' STRIPES â¢
ARE VERY NECESSARY
Prisoners' Aid Association Condemns
. New Jersey Movement to Take â¢
Them Off.
The 'movement in New Jersey to abol
ish:, the striped clothing of. .the convicts
In the penitentiary has aroused much in
terest among those in this State who are
concerned with prison affairs. Such a
movement finds no favor here, and one
of. the most earnest in his deprecation of
the idea is Mr. Goldsborough S. Griffith,
president of the Maryland Prisoners' Aid
Association. In speaking of* the matter
Mr. Griffith saiu:
.. "Ignorance and idleness are the most
prolific sources of crime, and that this is
so is evidenced by the fact that, while
the colored population of the State is
20 per cent of the total population, 62 per
cent of the prisoners in the penitentiary
are colored, and that; race is the most
idle and ignorant in our population. This
being so, I believe that everything should
be done to educate the criminal, both
mentally and morally; but I have no mor
bid: or sentimental sympathy with the
prisoners. When wrong has been done,
punishment must follow, and there have
been a number of cased where pardons
have been granted by the Governor
against which I would have advised
strongly. â¢ ...
"To take the stripes off the convicts
would be ruinous. It would mean that
where there Is one attempt at escape
now, there would be twenty were the pris
oners not clothed In a distinguishing garb.
It would, therefore,, mean that more
guards would have to be employed. It
would be bad, not only for the community
but for the prisoner aa well. ! He would
be ; constantly thinking of making his
escape, and that would take his mind
from his work and' conduce to idleness.
I cannot understand any Judge's advo
cacy of such a plan, and any one in favor
of It must have viewed the matter very
superficially. In this I can speak not only
for myself, but also for the other man
agers of the Maryland Prisoners' Aid As
sociation,, for I know that they hold views
similar to mine."â Baltimore American.

GLASS DAY AT HOITT'S SCHOOL.
After listening to a dozen protestants,
who called attention to the fact that the

assessing any but the property owners

thur H. Noyes said, in the presence of said

order appointing McKenzie receiver was an
appealable order, but that assuming it was

Lindblom Makes Affidavit.
The affidavit of Erik O. Lindblom re
cites the appointment by United States
District Judge Arthur H. Koyes of Alex
ander McKenzie <jn July 23, 1900, as re
ceiver of the property in the suit of
Chipps vs. Lindeberg et al.. and the issu
ance of the writs of supersedeas by
fnited States Circuit Judge Morrow, act
ing in his capacity as Â«. member of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals,
commanding Noyes to desist from any
further proceedings on account of s.ald
orders, and also commanding McKenzie
to restore to the defendants in the several
suits all property which McKenzie held
as receiver. The allegation is made that
McKenzie refused to obey the writ and to
surrender $200,000 worth of gold dust, or
.any part thereof, to the defendants, and
that Judge Noyes declined to make an or
der directing the enforcement of the writ
of supersedeas, and declared that the or
der appointing the receiver was not ap
pealable and that the defendants were
not entitled to an appeal.
The further allegation is made that on
September 15, 1900, Judge Noyes gave in
structions to C. L. Vawter, United States
Marshal for thai district, to place a guard
over the vaults containing the gold dust
mentioned and to prevent access to the
vaults, especially by McKenzie, and that
Judge Noyes on that occasion said to
Vawter in the presence of Thomas J.
Geary, "Go ahead and keep possession of
the gold dust, and do not let McKenzie
or any of the parties go near it." Â¦
It is further alleged that on the' suc
ceeding day Judge Noyes said to Thomas
J. Geary that McKenzle should turn over
the mines and surrender them, but should
retain the gold dust.
The most -important document was the
testimony of Alfred Musgrave, one of the
registrars of the principal Probate Regis
try of the High Court of Justice, London,
taken before Sir F. Lushlngton, Chief
Magistrate of the Police Courts of Lon
don. It was in effect that the form of
grant uÂ«ed by Cooper was totally different
to any grant of probate or administration
made in that country, and there was no
jurisdiction to issue probate or adminis
tration except from the Principal and Dis
trict Probate Registers. In all cases seals
were attached to the grants: they were
large seals of impressions on wax. There
was no Probate Judge named "James E.
Bowman," and the judges did not sit at
Somerset. The Chancery Division of the
High Court had no jurisdiction to grant
probate or administration. All grants
were made on parchment paper. The
stamps and seals used by Cooper were not
of any Btamps or seals used in the Pro
bate Division of the High Court of Jus
tice. .'>-Â¦:"Â¦ ' ;.Â¦â¢â¢Â¦-. :Â¦- Â¦â¢Â¦â¢Â¦'>:

That on said 15th day of September, 1900, the
said Arthur H. Noyes gave instructions. to one
C. L. Vawter, who was then United States
Marshal for said district, to place a guard
over the vaults containing said gold dust which
had been so taken by said McKenzle from said
mines described in the complaints In . said ac
tions, and to prevent access thereto by. any
person. That the object of said order, as com
plainant is Informed and believes, was to de
feat the execution of said writ of supersedeas.
That in and by an affidavit made by said
That on the 14th day of September, 1900,
certified copies of said order allowing said
appeal In eome of said cases, with other
papers and the said writs of 6upersedeas In
all of said cases, were filed in the office of
the clerk of the said District Court, and a
certified copy of said writ of supersedeas was
served upon the said ,Arthur H. Noyes and
also upon the eaid Alexander McKenzie in the
cases hereinbefore mentioned, and at the same
time demand was made upon said Alexander
McKenzie that he return to the defendants in
said actions the gold and gold dust which he
had taken from the claims described In the
complaints in said actions, which said gold
dust so taken by said McKenzie from said
claims and then in his possession was of the
value of about $200,000. That said McKenzie
refused to deliver said gold dust, or any part
thereof, to the defendants in said actions, or
either of them, and refused to comply with
said- writ of supersedeas; whereupon applica
tion was made by the defendants, ' through
their counsel, to the said Arthur H. Noyets
for an order directing the enforcement of the
writ of supersedeas issued by this court. That
said Arthur H. Noyes then and there declined
to make said order, saying that the matter
was out of his hands. That on the 15th day
of September, 1900, the defendants in said ac
tions, through their counsel, again requested
said Arthur H. ,Noyes to make an order direct
ing the enforcement of said writ of super
sedeas, but the said Noyes then . and there
stated and declared that the order appointing
the receiver was not appealable, and that the
defendants were net entitled to an. appeal. -
Held the Gold Dust.
In the affidavit of Lindblom the follow
ing constitutes an interesting part of the
text:
That immediately after said orders had been
made by Judge Noyes, said McKenzle dis
possessed defendants respectively of the placer
claims described In the complaints In said ac
tions, and taking possession of 6ald mines,
worked the same, extracting gold <Joat tirere
from of the value of more than one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000). That after said
orders were made the defendants In each of
the cases presented to said Arthur H. Noyes,
Judge of said court, and to the said court,- a
petition for the allowance of an appeal from
said order, together with an undertaking on
appeal and an assignment of errors; but the
said Arthur H. Noyes refused to grant 6ald
petition or to allow an appeal from any of
said orders.
That thereafter, on the 23th day of August.
1900, the Honorable W. W. Morrow, one of
the Judges of this court, made orders allow
ing appeals in the said cases, and directing
that writs of supersedeas should issue therein
out of this court, directed to the said Alex
ander McKenzle and the said Arthur H. Noyes,
commanding said Noyes to desist from any
further proceedings on account of said orders,
and commanding said McKenzie to restore to
the defendants in said actions all ' property
which the said McKenzle had taken or re
ceived as receiver.

Mr. Pierce is not an organizer; he is a dis
turber, interloper and meddler. He has tried
hard to disrupt and ruin some of the best
â¢labor organizations in existence; he has prom
ised to put the Building Trades Council out of
business; he has attacked the United Brother
hood of Railway Employes and most shame
fully abused Its officers; and he it was who
urged the machinists of the Union Iron Worka
to "cinch the Scotts" by striking some three
weeks ago and preventirg- the launching of the
Ohio If the demands were not acceded to; and
it was this man Pierce who, on the â¢ same
occasion so ardently expressed the hope that
President McKinley and Irving M. Scott would
be the only persons present at the launching
of the battleship Ohio. But such expressions
and actions. do not represent the sentiment of
the organized workingmen of San Francisco.
It Is a strange and foreign voice that repre
sents nobody and which has absolutely nothing
to lose. The organized mechanics of this city
are 'Â¦ as loyal and patriotic as the best Ameri
can citizen In any community. True trades
unionism marching behind the stars and stripes
should not be confused with the Plercean
product that wabbles behind the red flag and
keeps timp to the funeral march.
No action was taken yesterday by the
executive! committee of the San Francisco
Labor Council in the matter of a, general
boycott placed in their hands â¢ at : the
meeting \|held on Friday' night: in fact,
the conditions, legal and otherwise, that
confront I them, are such that they are
compelled to make haste slowly.
Most of the blame for this unwise labor dis
turbance when traced, down to Its original
source falls on the head of Jefferson, p. Pierce,
who througrh Irony of fate holds a commission
from Samuel Gompers, president of the Ameri
can Federation of -tabor, as "general organ
izer." Mr. -Pierce came to San Francisco in
January last, ; and as he had drawn down a
stipend from the Federation of $410 for hia
organizing: expenses In Los Angeles during the
month of December, "he just took a ; little
much-needed rest," and then proceeded to recite
his stereotyped speeches for the benefit Â¦ of the
workingmen of the city at a rate of $10 per
charter. It was. easy. Restaurant employes
and other miscellaneous trades all sent for
charters â that magical Instrument which ac
cording to Pierce can in less than twenty-four
hours radically change economic conditions
that have existed for several decades. . Higher
wages, shorter hours, stringent regulations,
immediately when the charter arrives â all
these Plereean promises for $10 only; It was
cheap',' and the roll of the embryo thing, which
was so erringly called a union, swelled Into
thousands, and the head' of the man of many
promises swelled also. His first attempt to
deliver the goods took place on the first of
May, and, of course, resulted in a failure.
The effect of this failure Is what may prove
disastrous to both the unions and the indus
tries of San Francisco.
Two bodies of organized labor unions
covering different fields of action, practi
cally control the labor mart. One is the
Building Trades Council and the other
the San Francisco Labor Council. Be
tween the j two there is no harmony of
action. Louis Chester, chairman of the
executive committee of the Building
Trades Council, makes the following
statement:
Strike matters are practically at a
standstill. Every union meeting, held lasj;
night ' declared In favor of the slogan,
"More pay and leas hours." No definite
action, however, has . been taken . by tho
Cooks' and Walters' Alliance. Secretary
Rosenberg said. last night that the San
Francisco Labor Council had so far done
nothing: to change . conditions. .â The ad
vice of Its Headers, Â¦ though sought by
workingmen, has resulted in a temporiz
ing policy.
