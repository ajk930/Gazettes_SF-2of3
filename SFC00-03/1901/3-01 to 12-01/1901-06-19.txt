Joseph |D. Redding Has Complaints Pre
pared; to Be Filed When Evidence of
Adoption Is Sufficiently Well in Hand
THE Intention of Princess Hatz
feldt to contest the will of Coi
ns P. Huntington, published ex
clusively In The Call, was a
topic of much discussion -yes
terday, particularly among law
yers, railroad men and finan
ciers. Interest in the news was general,
and wherever men gathered In conversa
tional groups the proposed contest and
The Call's exclusive announcement of it
became Invariably the subject of conver
sation.
The principals In the colossal legal
strugrsie that the Hatzfeldts are prepar-
ing. to inaugurate are keeping discreetly
silent. The Princess Is still In Sacra
mento with her mother. Mrs. Clara Pren
tice, who is one of the strongest cham
pions of her daughter's claim to. a larger
share In the Huntington millions. She as
serts that she signed a document by
which she relinquished her authority,
over her daughter, and that Huntington
legally adopted the child, the papers be
ing duly recorded. The procedure \ In
cluded even the' formal changing of â¢â¢her
name from Clara Louisa .Prentice to
Clara Blizabeth Huntington. Mrs. Pren
tice and the witnesses sha will ba aMe
to produce will doubtless* be the main
stay of the plaintiff's case in, the. event
of failure to find record of legal adoption.
Prince j Paul Hatzfeldt and Joseph D.
Redding, the attorney who has been
chosen to lead the assault upon the Hunt
ington moneybags, keep their own counsel
well. â¢ '

The attorney and the Prince â¢ were in

"But the question of the consider

water between San Francisco and
Mare Island â twenty-two feet deep
â has been brought to the attention
of the committee on Rivers and Har
bors before.
"Some years ago we recommended
that a survey be made and that the
cost of deepening the channel to the
depth of thirty feet be estimated.
This . recommendation was adopted ;
by". Congress and became - a r law. â¢-
Congressmen Kahn and- "Woods, â¢who had
also seen the telegram, did not attach any
importance to it as to a possible re
moval of the business from Mare. Island.
Chairman Burton shared their views, but
alluding to another statement in the tele
gram â¢concerning the lack of deep water
bet-ween San Francisco and Mare Island
made the following interesting statement:
"The Committee on Rivers and Harbors
has nothing to do with recommending or
making any examination for a site for a
navy yard. That work would have to be
done by a board of naval officers and the
report of such board would be referred to
the Committee on Xaval Affairs. We
would have to deal with that only as in

YESTERDAY morning The Call

what was deemed by men well
qualified to speak to be essen
tial to the improvement of the
rivers and harbors of certain sections of
the State. This morning-interviews with
Congressmen appear In print, which give
the views of the people's representative* " ~
In regard to localities other than those

development, and commerce will lead tLÂ«
way. The Call is accordingly willln? to
surrender a great deal of space In this Â¦
connection for the public good and does so
gladly. Below will be found what Con
gressmen "Woods and Coombs say In
reference to .th* present topic of para
mount importance.
'.The first named calls attention to the
fact. that 1 while he speaks at some length
about the San Joaquln Valley, the peo
ple -of Sacramento have prepared a
memorial in which they set forth their
desires and a general statement of value
to themselves. He therefore leaves the
presentation of their case to them, being
confident that they will do the subject
Justice. The statements that - Congress
man "Woods makes will be considered, for
his figures and facts are striking. ! They
show how Important are the interests of
the interior.
WOODS SPEAKS OF
NEEDS OF VALLEYS
Congressman S. D. "Woods says that the
most urgent requirement for the Improve
ment of waterways in the San Joaquln
Valley Is the proposed diverting canal to
carry the waters of Mormon Slough to
the Calaveras River.
"This is a project recommended by
Lieutenant Colonel Heuer' and Is in
dorsed by the "War Department." said
Congressman "Woods. "The purpose Is to
prevent the deposit of detritus and con
sequent shoaling of Mormon and Stockton
Channels and the San Joaquin River. The
improvement calls for an appropriation ot
$255,016, a part of which Is for the dredg
ing of the two channels named. This ap
propriation has not* been authorized by
Congress, although there Is little doubt
of favorable action after the Committee,
on Rivers and Harbors has visited the
locality and becomes acquainted with Its
needs. The dam proposed by Colonel
Heuer, to be placed In Mormon Slough,
three miles east of Stockton, and the ex
cavation of a canal from that point four
and one-half miles northwesterly to thÂ»
Calaveras River, and' the alteration of the
mouth of the Stockton Channel will save
the Government annually $7113, which haÂ£
been the average expenditure for dredg
ing the detritus from Stockton and Mor
mon channels during the past thirteen
years. The plan will also be a great sav
ing to the shipping Interests of Stockton.
"The city of Stockton and its business
men have repeatedly expended vast sums
that every one would be considered care
fully. The committee had considered that'
only by visiting the rivers and harbors, of
the Pacific Coast'could jit. gain the knowl r
edge necessary for- considering any. river
i and harbor bill as a whole. Mr.. Burton
t has personally .visited and inspected every
: navigable river and harbor, for which Im
. provements have been askedâ that Is,- on
;the,Atlantic or on the Gulf. Other mem-
bers of the committee have taken pains to
similarly" equip themselves with -â¢'Â»*Â¦ full
knowledge of the facts.
Â¦:- Chairman â¢ Burton, in speaking about
river .and -harbor . improvements, Is en
thusiastic and evidently is greatly inter
ested, in" the work. >;Indeed,. when he' as
chairman of the committee presented the
fiver and harbor bill to ;the" Fifty-sixth
Congress he"; said: ?The Committee on
Rivers and Harbors . presents this bill
with the confidence that no measure be
fore * Congress confers greater benefit
upon the. country." â¢ .-- â¢' â¢Â¦ -Â¦
DESIRES THAT ALL
RIVERS BE VISITED
Congressman Frank Li. Coombs said:
"The visit of the House Committee on
Rivers and Harbors to California should
be of supreme Importance to the State.
Heretofore our appropriations for our
rivers and harbors have depended upon
the energies of our representatives, to
gether with the reports of the United
States engineers as to the advisability and
necessity of the same. The greatness of
a State cannot be studied solely by maps
and through scientific reports. . The
breadth, length and resources of a river
can be ascertained accurately by sailing
down it. Observation is and always will
be the true lesson. California Is so far
removed from the nation's/ capital that
visits of this kind have heretofore been
deemed impossible.
"The committee should visit every river
In California, and te made acquainted
Â¦with the great resources of the valleys
which they drain. Facts gained from
scientific knowledge -will be more easily
understood. Necessities' based upon ob
servation appeal to the fairness, the Judg
ment and the wisdom In a two-fold light.
It Is to be hoped that the commtitee will
be given an opportunity to visit the coun
try and learn the value of the improve
ments contemplated for the rivers which
pay - their annual ' tribute to San Fran
cisco. It Is necessary to learn, not only
the needs of a river, but It Is Important
to learn of the . resources of the great
valleys through which they flow and
which must depend for all time to come
upon their improvement and protection.
"It is to be hoped, therefore, that the
people of San Francisco, having the en
tertainment of this committee in charge,
Â¦will look to the advantages to be gained
In a knowledge of the great- valleys
which, year j by year, are paying their
tribute to San Francisco." Â¦- . â¢

PROMISE OF AID
Wii FOR REDWOOD CITY
;.. REDWOOD CITY, . JunelS.â The Con
gressional Committee on Rivers andflar
bors : spent an hour to-day at this place
Concerning the improvement of the Sac
ramento River Congressman Woods said
that he considered^it wise to refrain from
making suggestions until he could receive
a memorial which' the Chamber of Com
merce of Sacramento has prepared with
great care to present to the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors. . The - Government
engineers estimate that a specific annual
appropriation of; $25,000 is necessary to
keep the Sacramento River navigable un
der present conditions above Sacramento.
"The Rivers and Harbors Committee
stands ready to appropriate $150,000 In the
next bill. for the debris dams on the Yuba
River, near Marysville. The value of this
work is illustrated by the fact that from
the territory constituting the watershed
of the Yuba River, and its tributaries
there has already been taken $212,000,000.
the greater part"; coming from the
hydraulic mines once worked there.
"Hundreds of .square miles of rich
hydraulic ground lies idle to-day which
will yield uncounted' millions when the
owners are free to work them as in for
mer years. While the dams and accessory
reservoirs are in a way as yet along ex
perimental lines, still the consensus of
opinion of the engineers is that they will
hold back the mining debris and enable
the hydraulic miners to resume opera
tion* . .
"To the miners of this section the Fed
eral Government owes a moral duty, and
if hydraulic mining can be made possible
by the exoenditure of millions . on the
Yuba River they should be expended. I
am familiar with.thft theory upon which
the Government expends money in river
improvement. No violation of that theory
will- be had in work done on the Yuba
River along projected lines, for the neces
sity of â such work already exists to pro
tect the intake rivers from the inflow of
the vast quantities: of debris which .will
surely destroy them unless held back;. ~ "
"If collaterally hydraulic mining' should
be made possible by* the expenditure of
millions in Â» the protection of the rivers
the expenditure will be poured back by
increased millions into our treasury from
the great gravel beds that hold these mil
lions In present suspension.- The Rivers
and Harbors Committee will examine no
more important work than this, and it
could well afford to cross a continent to
make that examination alone."
Congressman Woods spoke of the popu
lation of 183.295. the area of 21.3W.40O acres,
the assessed wealth amounting to.$150,
000,000. the $25,000,000 annual worth of. farm
products. -the increase of "nearly 30 per
cent In the population in ten years and of
the manufactures of the valley, stimulat
ed by the development of coal, petroleum
and electric power. With these facts he
favored such a policy in the improvement
of the San Joaquin River as will ultimate
ly provide a ship canal from Stockton to
the sea, with ample harbor accommoda
tions at the head of navigation and offi
cial recognition as a port of entry. In all
improvements of the San Joaquin River,
he says, this ultimate purpose of a deep
water ship channel should be kept clearly
In view. .
TO KEEP NAVIGABLE'
THE SACRAMENTO
/ "The channels of; the San Joaquin
Biver are freighted with a traffic, un
known on any similar channels in the
United States. | But when we look be
yond the reclaimed' lands traversed
by the navigable San Joaquin to the
great basin drained by its waters we
begin to comprehend the extent of
the empire that provided San Joaquin
River a traffic that exceeds that, of
any. other river on the Pacific Coast
and ; ranks - fourth among the navi
gable rivers of the country. When
we consider that Stockton is the gate-'
â¢way .to a plain ' whose inhabitants
Lave paid the Federal Government
820,000,000 for real estate it is not
surprising - that railroads iave. cen
tered here from all directions and
that sixteen steamers are required to
accommodate 'the traffic at its busy
wharves."
Congressman Woods also said that be
yond-the urgent need of Federal appro
priation for the "diverting canal is the
great question of safe-guarding the in
terests of the San Jcaquin Valley by per
manent improvements of the tortuous San
Joaquin River. The ultimate aim should
be to make the river a direct, unobstruct
ed highway of traffic, traversable by any
craft, accessible at any point. The lands
adjacent to the San . Joaquin River be
tween Stockton and San Francisco are
more productive than any like area in the
inhabitable world. In this connection

from those established by Marconi. In

SAN JOSE. June 18.â The Del Monte
flyer, which leaves this city at 9:29 o'clock
for San Francisco, narrowly avoided a
bad â¢ wreck this morning near the round
house in the railroad yards. The train
was late and as it started to leave the
yards an engine was backed out of the
roundhouse by an engine hostler named
Stagg, who thought the flyer had passed.
JUst ! as the engine reached the main
line the passenger train came up and
crashed into it. The hostler reversed his
engine, as did Engineer Stewart of the
flyer, and both men Jumped. Both
engines were badly wrecked in front. The
cowcatchers were torn away and the
trucks twisted. Beyond a heavy Jarring
and fright none of the' passengers were
injured.
Engineer Stewart had his right hip
broken in jumping-and received slight in
juries. Flrkman John Dugan jumped
into a pile of cinders and was uninjured.
Had the train been running at a higher
rate of speed the accident would have
been a bad one. The train was delayed
about an hour while men cleared the
track of the disabled engines.
General Superintendent Frazier was on
board. He denounced the accident as
gross carelessness and dismissed the
hostler. â¢ Â¦--'Â¦ '; - â¢

Makes Direct Attack Upon
the Policy cf the
Prosecution.
BUFFALO, N. Y., June IS.â The final
direct verbal 'plea for another chance be
fore a jury for Roland B. Mollneux. the
alleged â¢ poisoner of Mrs. Katherlne J-
Adams and Henry C. Barnett. and the
first half of the arraignment of the plea
in resistance were heard by the Court of
Appeals to-day. John G. Milburn. rep
resenting Uolineux, spoke nearly two
hours and was succeeded by ex-Senator
D*vid B. Hill, whose argument In oppo
sition lasted until court arose at 2
o'clock. Hill will close by noon to-mor
row. . -
Attorney Milburn began with a direct
attack upon the policy of Recorder Goff
tnroughout the trial. He charged Goff
with favoring Assistant District Attor
ney Osborne, whose methods he also
questioned, and also charged him with
prejudice against Attorney Barlow S.
Weeks. Senator Hill was equally vigor
ous.
After â¢ explaining his connection with
the appeal, he reviewed the case and ar
gued the guilt of the defendant. He
strongly defended the course of Recorder
Goff and Assistant District- Attorney Os
bcrne and the theory and policy of "the
prosecution. , Â¦ -
Starting with the theories of the peo
ple as to the killing of Mrs. Adams and
Barnett, he followed them through their
lines of reasoning and contended for
their stability and acceptance. He in
sisted that the people had the right to
show how Barnett died and insisted that
a complete reconciliation of the two cases
was possible. He avowed that the prose
cution was within its rights in showing
the relations of Molineux and his wife
prior to their marriage, and asserted that
it was the people who had suffered when
the Recorder ordered the evidence strick
en out. He said Mrs. Molineux had called
her marriage a romance; he called it a
tragedy.
Senator Hill took up successively the
various mysterious letters written under
the names of Cornish and Barnett and
forcefully adjusted them in their places
in the theory of the prosecution.' dramat
ically proclaimed the alleged guilt of the
prisoner and Insisted that the State had
conclusively proved its charge. He de
fended Harry Cornish against suspicion
or insinuation and asserted the reliability
of the . mass of handwriting testimony
offered by. the State. Reviewing the
trouble at the â¢ Knickerbocker Club, and
connecting with it Cornish's denuncia
tion of Molineux and the Harpster Inci
dent, Hill proclaimed revenge as the mo
tive of the plot to kill Cornish, and then
pictured Jealousy as the motive in the
Barnett case. He pronounced the weight
of evidence against the accused as over
whelming and said that no defense had
been made, because none was possible.
Senator Hill did not touch the disputed
law points and will go into them to
morrow.

FIGHTING HARD
FOR M0LINEUX
Continued from First Page.
Keller was the witness for the State. He
showed the jury his scarred face and
blinded and injured eyes. He insisted in
a mild way under cross-examination that
the shot which entered his head was fired
from behind. He said he had spoken to
no one and, inferentially, there had been
no quarrel.
PRESENT NEED OF THE VALLEYS
The story of Barker, may never be told
on' the witness stand; -.The court held that
Barker could not testify: to his own state
â¢of mind on , the morning of the shooting.
The object of the defense from the mo
ment' Barker was called was to Introduce
the alleged conversation' between Barker
and his wife, whjch, it is claimed, led up
to the shooting, but at every turn coun
sel met with defeat. -Then they went
straight at the question and sought to
bring in the whole story, but failed. Bar
ker was withdrawn from the stand with
out testifying to anything material.
The story: of. Mrs. Barker, may not be
told now- unless Counsel finds some way
which has not yet suggested Itself to in
troduce, it. The ruling' of the court in
every instance was- pronounced quickly
and the lawyers were generally of the
opinion that the exceptions Attorney Van
Winkle filed were not such as would up
set the result, if there was a conviction.
Dr. Strasser, one of the doctors 'who
attended Keller, told of the wounds and
gave expert testimony that Keller was
shot from behind.
NEW YORK, June 18.â The second day

Widow of Guatemala Millionaire
Causes Arrest of a Man in
San Diego.
SAN DIEGO, June 18.â The- arrest of
J. E. Thomas, who claims to be a con-
noisseur of paintings, followed this even
ing after an all-day search for two
paintings, claimed to be genuine Van
Dykes, and asserted to be worth $30,000.
One of the paintings is an oil portrait
of Van Dyke, said to have been painted
by himself, and the other a painting of
Michael Angelo. It is claimed that they
were presented by King Victor Emanuel
to Delambert. a millionaire of Guate
mala, whose widow now resides here. It
was she who instituted the search . this
morning, and it was she who finally
swore to the complaint charging Thomas
with embezzling the pictures.
Mrs. Delambert says that Thomas after
becoming well acquainted with the owner
of the pictures borrowed them to make
copies of them. "When the time came to
return them they were not produced.
Thomas says that he sent them, to New-
York and Intends to keep them until he
is paid $1000. which amo"nt he claims
Mrs.: Delambert owes him. Mrs. Delam
bert denies the. debt and declares that
Thomas owes her for board. Thomas la

lonely I have been since I left my Benha. I

until 7. The signal detachment was short
and Signal Captain Lawrence was very
anxious that more men should be detailed
to go with him, but Colonel Evans, the
chief signal officer, could give him no
more than the detail assigned, so Captain
Lawrence evolved a plan. He marched
with the column down the road. to where
Lieutenant Martin of the signal detach
ment, detailed to accompany the Third
Brigade on its practice march, had estab
lished a signal station at the mouth of
the first canyon and then leaving the
road he: attacked, the station and cap
tured four men, five horses and the tele
graphic outfit. The fifth horse belonged
to Lieutenant Martin, who was up the
line a little distance at the time of the
attack. When he returned he found^hls
station despoiled and his horses and men
gone. He walked Back. to camp. â¢
Will the Prisoners Work.
Captain Lawrence repeated the per
formance more than once further along
and he now has a good serviceable'de
tachment under him. The question is,
however, can he make - the prisoners
work. Colonel Evans warned his offi
cers against leaving stations unprotect
ed, and the capture was due to their own
neglect.

artillery, for-the guns of the naval',mili

MADRID, June 18.â The Diarlo de la

half past 1 o'clock they came upon a sig
nal outpost, where they were halted,, and
then upon the rear guard of the main
column. Here they were again halted, but
they managed to pass the sentry and en
tered the camp, where the men lay sleep
ing on the hillside. They, were halted by
one sentry, a cavalryman from Troop B of
Sacramento, who let them pass, but when
Colonel Hosmer announced, himself as the
division inspector and asked to see the
sentry's arms, the man refused point
blank and ordered the party on.
The brigrade was safely camped and
contemplated no night attack and tho
mystery of its silence was explained only
when the command returned to camp.
Two cavalrymen had seen the wire laid
by the signal corps along the ground and
not understanding what it meant they
proceeded to cut it. They were captured
and are now awaiting dire penalties in
the guardhouse.. They had heard of the
suspected attack on the camp and be
lieving that the Third Brigade had become
"the enemy" they proceeded to damage
"the enemy" as much as possible. It was
not until General Muller returned to the
camp that he learned he had been visited
during the nipht by the division officers.
They returned to the camp at 4 o'clock
this, morning. J_ .
The First Brigade was to have started
at 4 o'clock, but as the morning: promised
to be a cool - one the departure was not
hurried and the command did not start

The %hree officers searched the hills over
in the blackest of darkness and about
coming in, telling of the advance of the
brigade, but suddenly they ceased and the
brigade was heard from no more. There
was a great deal of speculation over the
long silence and word went around that
General Muller was*returning to make a
night attack on the camp. Signals for
the pruard were agreed upon, blank am
munition was issued to the brigades In
camp and every outpost was thrown out
up and down the roads so far that it took
the officer of the day three hours to make
his rounds. But nothing was heard. from
the brigade and at 11 o'clock â¢ General
Dickinson decided he would find out what

where it was. He .detailed Lieutenant

There has been a strike of the bus men

(( 7, 18.â The call to arms from a

their belts and rifles marked the
return this morning of the Third Brigade.
They were tired and dirty and they walk
ed as if there was work in the carrying
of forty-pound equipment, but they were
Jubilant and only the presence of the re
viewing general kept them from cheer
ing.
The First Brigade left camp this morn
ing at 7 o'clock and the two commands
passed close to each other, but did not
meet. However, it cost the Third Brigade
some of its . outposts of signal men. and
they are now helping out with" the dots

Third Brigade has also a story of a mid
night visit and a party that passed the
sentry "line and reached the heart of the
camp.
The Third Brigade camped by battalion
in a canyon on both sides of a stream. It
left the camp by the main road and soon
after struck off into the hills, leaving a
6ignal telegraph station at the mouth of
the canyon and trailing the wires for the
station along after it. The home station
had been established on a water tank in
the camp and messages sent to the tele

from the advancing column were sent to
the home station by heliograph, flags or

SACRAMENTO, June 18.â The report
of the legislative committee on the re
ception to President McKinley has been
filed with State Controller Colgan. It
Â¦will bÂ« recalled that the last Legislature
appropriated $2000 for the purpose of giv
ing the President a formal welcome on
behalf of the State and a numerous
committee was appointed from the mem;
berehip of both houses to do the honors,
Â¦with Lieutenant Governor J. H- MTeff as
chairman.
It appears that this legislative commit
tee has held several meetings, and it like
wise appears from an examination of the
linanciaJ statement Just filed with the
State Controller that If it had been nec
etpary to hold one or two more meetings
there would not have been enough of
lilt) $2000 left to have purchased the
Presidential party a good-sized Jug of
circus lemonade. The statement shows
that for stationery, stamps, printing, en-
Kraving invitations and the expenses of
the secretary there was expended $142 {*>;
for work done toward lighting the CapJ
tol, printing, decorating, etc., 5166 50 J for
expenses incurred by Lieutenant Govern
or Neff, $25; for expenses incured by Sen
ator T. H. Selvage of Eureka, $160; for
expepees incurred by Senator S. C. Smith
of Baicerstield, $100; for expenses In
curred by Speaker of the Assembly C.
W. Pendleton of Los Angeles, $250; for
expenses incurred by Assemblyman E.
L. Webber of JN'apa, $50; for expenses in
curred by Assemblyman J. McD. Kelley
of Oakland, $50; for the hire of S. Luke
Howe of Sacramento as clerk, $50, ~ and
of L A. Hilborn of San Francisco as
clerk, Â£150, making a grand total of ex
penses of 51209.
It appears that $25 each was also award
ed to Senator R. T. Devlin and Assembly
man Grove L. Johnson, both of Sacra
mento, but they declined to accept it, say
ing they had no expenses for which they
desired reimbursement. Â¦
The statement filed with the Controller
Is beautifully brief and affords no indica
tion of how the committee managed to ex
pend on Itself more than half the money
it was expected to apply to the formal
welcoming of the President. Just what
the committee proposed to do with Presi
dent McKinley when it got him here has
never been disclosed. It was Â¦ suggested
that he occupy the May queen's throne
and there, with the committee ranged
about him in impressive array, listen to an
address by Governor Gage, but this pros
pect was not deemed altogether attractive
and was abandoned.
One member of the committee suggested
that the President be escorted to the As
sembly chamber and that all be barred
out of the reception except. those holding
credentials granted by the committee. The
committeeman Â¦was all but mobbed by in
dignant Sacramentans for his implied ex
clusiveness. What kind of a welcome the
oommittee would have been able to give
the President with this money left is a
matter of conjecture, but the general im
pression hereabouts appears to be that the
President showed rare tact in ) passing
through. Had he actually stopped over
there is no telling- how much, more than
the remaining $S00 would have been
charged against the State to provide for
his entertainment and that of his legis
lative entertainers.

When Murphy met Miss Smalley his rel
atives became estrangec, and when he was
dying in the Lamolle House Miss Smalley
was his sole companion. As soon as Mur
phy was dead his wife and daughter and
other relatives took charge of things and
Miss Smalley was ordered away. At that
time Miss Smalley' was accused of taking
all of Murphy's personal belongings.
Murphy left an estate of nearly half a
million dollars. When the will was opened
it was found this estate "was distributed
among his daughter and a score of neph
ews and nieces, and Miss Smalley had
been cut off without a cent. She at once
announced her intention of suing the es
tate. An action was begun for $24,000 for
services rendered the capitalist from'Feb
ruary, 1895, to November 16. 189S, the time
of Murphy's death. This was alleged to
be for caring for Murphy, who during this
time required great attention. For the
past two years the matter has dragged
through the court on motions and cross
complaints. The Union Trust Company is
made defendant because it is the executor
of Murphy's estate. Henry I. Kowalsky
of San Francisco and E. M. Rosenthal
represent Miss Smallev and D. M. Delmas
and S. F. Leib the Union Trust Company
and the heirs of the estate.
The forenoon to-day, was devoted to se

Smalley, a brother of the plaintiff, was
read. It related how his? sister had waited
on Murphy for the three years In question
and taken care of, him. He understood
they were to be married. A number of

SAN JOSE, June 18.â The love "affairs of
the late capitalist, James T. Murphy, are

Bertha Smalley "for ,'$24,000 for services
against the deceased's estate, which began
in. Judge Hyland's court to-day. For, a
number of years Miss Smalley was Mur
phy's companion and made her home with
him at the Lamolle House In this city.
The young woman always claimed that
Murphy intended to marry her and had
also promised to settle a large part of his
estate on her. Murphy was divorced from
his first wife, Mrs. Wilhelmina Murphy,
and had made a property settlement with
her. By that marriage he had a daughter,
now Mrs. Daniel Chapman.

It corrects inability to hold urine and scald-

they saw it. The result naturally was a

LOS ANGELES, June IS.â Two thousand
people saw Joe Bernstein and Solly Smith
fight a twenty-round draw at Hazard's
Pavilion to-night. The fight was unex
pectedly slow and neither man bail any
decided advantage except in the tenth
round, when Bernstein landed two left,
swings on Smith's jaw and had him
sligrhtly grdggy at the end of the round.
Smith recovered quickly and continued on
the aggressive until the end of the fight.
In the eighth round Solly forced Bern
stein through the ropes and both men
narrowly escaped falling' from the plat
form. -"
In the fifteenth round Bernstein jitruck
Smith while the latter was kneeling, but
the referee refused to allow a foul. Bern
stein was on the defensive most of the
time and did not exhibit any of the fast
work which he generally shows. Smith
led steadily, but his terrific right arid left
swings went wild always. Harry Stuart
was the referee.
In a seven-round preliminary between
"Kid" Solomon of Los Angeles and "Kid'*
Dalton of San Francisco the former got
the decision. Aurelio Herrera refereed
this bout.
A Jim" Jeffries was present at the fight

about 10" a. m. from Panama and way
ports. Her cabin passengers were the fol
io wins named: . ' >
George Haitt, Luis T. Satres, Henry T. Dur
ant and wife, Luis Lopez, Albert F. Brown,
Frank Myler, Louis Hirsch, wife and two chil
dren; Mary McBride, Jeanie Newboon, An
gelina: Pinot, Julia Flores, Mrs. Bessie Mar
tin and child, Adolph Habjorentinger, â¢ F. san
chez Labour, Joseflna Mero, Hanks Zacher and
wife. M. Bretgartner, Eda Luria, F. Pearce,
Ricardo ' CareagV wife and child; Carmen
Solio and Cenobla Guiterrez.
Besides these the San Juan brought up
eight Chinese in transit for Hongkong.
On the trip down the coast the San Juan
lost one of her crew- and a lifeboat. On
May 6 last she was lying in the roadsted
off Acajutla, in company with the Salva
dorean gunboat Ivy. Colonel John Stew
art, the Mail Company's agent in San
Salvador, was on board the San Juan and
wanted to get ashore. A lifeboat was
lowered and manned with four sailors,
while Colonel Stewart took the tiller.
About the Fame time a boat was lowered
from the Ivy and both started for the
wharf. '"' When a few yards. from the land
ing a huge roller came along and carried
the San Juah's.boat past the wharf and
threw her up on the beach.- Colonel
Stewart was. stunned and would have been
carried out by the undertow had not- a
sailor named Salomi' pushed :hlm further
up the beach. Before the sailor could
himself gain a footing he was carried out
by the receding water and drowned. He
undoubtedly sacrificed his own life to save
that of Colonel Stewart. , â¢- Â¦
â¢ As it was, the colonel was nearly dead
when carried into a small house on the
wharf, and it was two hours before ho
became conscious. Then he was sent
home to Sononati in a special train.
: The wave that wrecked the San Juan's
boat threw the one' from the Ivy against
the pier and smashed . it Into kindling
wood. The crew -escaped. All the men
in both boats were laid up for nearly a
week, and Colonel Stewart was only re
covering from the effects of his accident
When the San Juan called at Acajutla -on
her way home. :

There is a. difference of only five games
between the leaders and the tail-enders' In
the California League. The four teams are
evenly matched and are playing high
class ball. Oakland has sprung up as a
candidate for first place. Although last
in the league, the four victories over Sac
ramento has given the club a new lease
of life and the team intends 'striving hard
to overtake the leaders. . Los Angeles
seems to be imbued with the same feeling,
and judging by the ; three games the
southern team took from the men from
"over the Rhein" they bid fair to suc
ceed. . : - Â¦- â¢ ' :
All the managers are looking for new
material to strengthen thejr teams. While
the San Francisco team is fielding fairly
well, it is weak at bat, and' Manager Har
ris recognizes the fact that good pitchers
have kept his aggregation in first place.
Harris is now on the 'lookout for two or
three players who are good stickers, and
is willing to sacrifice rieiding- for good bat
ting, tiacramento and Los Angeies are in
search of the same material. , "
Oakland has as good a team as there is
in the league and should go right to the
front.
Jimmy Whalen, the Dutch team's clever
twirler, who sprained hia ankle some
weeks ago, has reported for duty and will
make his reappearance in Thursday's,
game. Jimmy will be given a cordial re
ception by the "fans."
Keitz, the crack second-base man, now
playing with Los Angeles, is doing great
work m his territory. He has won the
hearts of the southern baseball cranks
and is playing in National League style.
He has not yet struck his batting streak,
but is gradually trimming his "lamps"
and should be hitting over .300 per cent.
Spies captained the Los Angeles nine
last Thursday, and as they lost the game
he resigned the post. Reilly was elected
captain, and as the team won the next
three games the Los Angeles "fans" be
lieve he will pull the team to the front.
In the four games played in the south
land against Los Angeles the local nine
only secured twenty-one hits, and of this
number Captain Pabst secured seven.
Krugand Schwartz failed to get a hit in
any of the games, and the former's work
at second was very poor.
Croll is fielding well, but his stickwork
is very light. Graham's throwing to
bases was perfect in the last series. Only
one man stole a sack in four games.
The Los Angeles team adopted bunting:
very successfully and this resulted in
many. runs. Every member of the team
seems, to be expert at this game and gives
evidence of much study and practice.-
Bowman was about to be released from
the Los Angeles nine because of his poor
batting, but in the late series he did bet
ter than any member of his team. His
showing has given him a new lease o*
life. -
Kelly's â¢ hitting, bunting ; and fielding
were a feature of all the^games down
south.
Los Angeles is a great baseball town.
The national game is the topic, of con
versation; and the crowds at- the \games
show- the deep interest taken in the pas-'
time. , . : ,r. r , .,':Â¦Â¦:. . â¢ Â¦';
Graves' 'umpiring in the Los Angeles-
San Francisco series gave general satis
faction. At times, however, his decisions
on balls and strikes were- faulty. â¢'
Matt Stanley is recovering from his
spell of illness and is again behind the
bat' for the Legislators, j
Sacramento was in a badly disabled
condition last week. Stanley was unable
to catch early in the series, Thomas is
still sick at Sacramento and Doyle's arm
is In a bad. way,. It is very doubtful
whether Doyle will ever be able to pitch
again, as he strained his arm.
The Oakland team intends to play Held
on the initial bag. when he recovers from
his illness -and "Truck" Eagan will be
se^it over to the third bag.
Dunleavy, Streib and Drennan compose
the best outfield ever got together on this
coast. They combine all the requisites
of the -game,- being good . hitters, fielders
and base-runners.
"Buck" i Francks, Oakland's shortstop,
is a good ball player, but seems to make
costly errors. His mistakes have gener
ally been made at critical moments, and
he has lost his team many a game.
The slump in Sacramento's batting has
created no end of discussion. Heretofore
the Senators have been noted for their
heavy stick work.
Harris has been trying to get "Bill"
Lange to play with Jils team, but received
a final answer yesterday from the great
outfielder. Lange will not play again, as
his business needs all his attention," ,
San Franciscp and Los Angeles have a
postponed garme which they will play on
the morning of July 4 at ' Recreation
Park.
San Francisco is a game ahead of Sac
ramento: the latter team Is one ahead of
Los Angeles and the. southern team is
three ahead of Oakland.
Van Haltren's work with the . i New

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N
W., WASHINGTON. June 18.â Rear Ad
miral Robley D. Evans has replied to
complaints officially made against him by
former Secretary of the Navy Chandler in
a way the latter will not like. !
In his book, "A Sailor's Log," Rear Ad
miral Evans states that while he was in
spector of the Fifth Lighthouse District,
with headquarters In . Baltimore, he re
fused to pass a disreputable politician ex
amined for appointment as light keeper,
and because of this was punished by Mr.
Chandler, then Secretary of the Navy, by
being relieved and placed on reduced pay.
'.'The navv had in some ways degener
ated into a job lotâ at least in the eyes of
those. who used it for their own purposes,"
the admiral said, "and was sometimes let
to a very low bidder."
Admiral Evans also referred to the revo
cation by the Secretary of a year's leave
of absence granted him by the Acting
Secretary.
Former Secretary Chandler takes excep
tion to these comments and explanation
and in a letter to Secretary Long, which
shows a desire for retraction, has I sug
gested that Admiral Evans would prob
ably be glad to see a copy of the original
order. \
The officer has replied that he has no
wish to examine the official record, and
there the matter stands. It Is now for
Mr. Chandler to take the next step. Sec
retary Long is disgusted with this latest
"tempest in a teapot," and will do noth
ing.
Mr. Chandler asserts that Admiral Ev
ans was detached because Mr. Folger
then Secretary of the Treasury, verbally
requested it, profanity being one of the
charges made against the naval "officer
An examination of the records of the de
partment shows that two ' sets of orders
were Issued to Admiral Evans, the -first
having been h,eld by Secretary Folger and
never delivered and the second having
been sent direct to Admiral Evans after
the adjournment of Congress. â¢ Friends of
Admiral Evans point out that had - Mr
Folger considered him objectionable he
would have promptly transmitted the first
set of orders, relieving him from light
house duty, instead of holding, them sev
eral months in his office.
â¢Admiral Evans declines to discuss Mr
Chandler's 1 complaint.

"Nothing is clearer in the history of dem

not climates, which were at one time fa

the spot. That is, consumption, though
at first exotic, later becomes indigenous."
Fifthâ The committee would Urge that plans
to prevent the further spread of this disease,
based on the bacillary theory of Its origin, be

possible moment.
, In his paper Dr. Sewall said: V"j ;
Fourth â In the opinion of the committee, con
sumption was not formerly indigenous to Colo
rado, but has become eo through infection from
imported cases.
Thirdâ Though the larger centers of popula
tion Ehow the greater number of indigenous
cases, no part of the State Is exempt from the
actual potential development of the disease.
Secondâ The disease, when developed here, is
probably less' yielding to remedial measures
than when Imported. , . .
Firstâ Deaths from tuberculosis contracted
in Colorado form at present about 13 per cent
of the whole number of deaths from tuberculo
sis and about 2 Der cent of the general mor
tality. The disease may therefore be said to
be Indigenous to the State.
DENVER, Colo., June 18.â The discus
sion of consumption and the declaration
that it is indigenous to Colorado were

first annual convention, which met here
this morning. Dr. Henry Sewall, presi
dent of the State Board of Health, report
ed for the committee on the subject,
"Tuberculosis ln Colorado." He said it
was increasing rapidly here. Drs. Van
Sandt and Whitney and many other
prominent physicians , protested against
giving out any such statement and claim

been numerous enough nor extending over
a long enough period to warrant such
conclusions. Dr. Sewall presented on be

WASHINGTON. June IS.â The Russian
Embassador. Count Cassini. has com
*n.unlcated to the State Department that
in. consequence of the action of the Amer
ican Government through a treasury or
der of March 9 last, applying tariff re
strictions against Russian petroleum im
ported Into this country, the Russian Min
ister of Finance, M. de Witte, has issued
an order, dated June 7, imposing the hlgTi
tariff rate of the Russian schedule upon
American resins under article 82 of the
Russian tariff law and increasing the rate
on American bicycles under article 173 of
the Russian law.
This action is entirely apart from that
taken in connection with Russian sugar
and Is a new development ln the discrim
inatory duties Imposed by this Govern
ment and the retaliatory duties Imposed
by Russia. The order of the Russian
Minister is to take effect next Friday,
or two weeks from the date of its Issu
ance.
At the Treasury Department it is stated
that the Imposition of a duty on petroleum
â¢was not a matter within the discretion of
the Secretary of the Treasury, but was
made mandatory by the Dingley tariff
act, which directs the Secretary, in case
any foreign country imposes a duty on
petroleum Imported from the United
States, to take corresponding action. This
Government, in compliance with the law,
imposed a. duty on Kusslan petroleum. In
no sense, it is stated, can this duty be re
garded as an unjust discrimination
against Russian petroleum, as that coun
try took the initiative against the Ameri
can article. Had Russia not taken this
Btep her petroleum would have been ad
milted to ths country free of duty under
the terms of the tariff act.
It Is said the American trade in bicycles
and the resins specified is quite large ln
Russia, so that the increase-i duties would
bear heavily upon these branches of the
American trade. As a result representa
tions are being made in behalf of these
manufacturers to the State Department
to intercede with Russia for an abate
ment of the high rates.
The text of the Russian Embassador*s
letter, as delivered to the Treasury De
partment, follows:
â¢W-ASHTN-GTOIC. D. C. May 26, lSOLâSec
retary of State: The Federal Government
having by circular dated March 9, 1901, ap
plied article 626 of the American tariff to
Russian petroleum.^ the Imperial Government
has Just Informed me that the Minister of
Finance of Russia has taken the requisite
eteps for the application of the advanced rates
of duty to the following: American products
entered Into Russia:
<1) White resin, or colophon, galipol, brew
ers' pitch, article t2 and (2) bicycles, article
173 paragraph 3.
This measure will go Into effect two weeks
from the date of its promulgation.
CASSINI.
The present duty on articles under the
first head of the resin family is 30.8 cents
per pood, or 36.112 pounds. Bicycles are
now taxable at the rate of $9 26 each. The
imposition of the maximum rate adopted
advances these figures by just 30 per cent.
This latest retaliation on the part of
Russia emphasizes the issue which had
arisen previously over Russian sugar. Ow
ing to the tariff war growing out of the
sugar decision pressure has been brought
to bear upon the Government through
commercial and industrial channels to se
cure an adjustment with Russia. The sit
uation, however, is such that the Govern
ment does not feel Itself able to move ln
'the direction desired, at any rate at this
moment.

Harriman also expressed himself re
cently in regard to the abolition of poll
tics. He firmly supports Hays ln his
stand, and has reiterated that the South
ern Pacific Is no longer in the political
arena. Herrin must therefore drop all af
filiations with politicians and devote his
energies to legal matters. Â¦, . â¢ â¢'.
"With the new policy the Union Pacific
and the Southern Pacific will work in
harmony. The Union Pacific will push
with vim the new extension it is
building between Salt Lake and Los An
geles, and when this is completed the
roads will be in closer relations than
ever.
The inside facts of the removal of Su
perintendent Wright of the Sacramento
division are becoming known. "Wright and
Kruttschnitt for a number of years were
the best of friends. A difference arose
regarding politics and Wright, with the
Influence he had at that time, made every
effort to subordinate Kruttschnitt' s' judg
ment to that of Herrin. He failed, and
Kruttschnitt acted up to- the old ad
age of "he laughs best who laughs
last." Kruttschnitt simply bided his time
and when his opportunity came he
brushed "Wright aside with a . word. He
waited till he found that Hays' was his
friend, that he would be supported by the
President in any order that he made, and
then he called for Wright's resignation.
A howl -went up, both at Sacramento and
from the political henchmen of the rail
road. Influence was brought to bear in
behalf of Wright, but it was of no avail.
The division superintendent Jiad to go.
and it was directly through Kruttschnitt's
orders. * . _
Stubbs Win Arrive Here To-Bay.
J. C. Stubbs '.will arrive this evening
from New <York. He returns to this city
to settle up his affairs .before assuming
command as traffic manager adviser of
the entire Harriman syndicate of rail
roads. His headquarters will be in New
York in the Equitable building. He will
still act as traffic manager of the South
ern Pacific. The Oregon Short Line and
the O. R. & N. have not at present a traf
fic manager, but these positions will be
filled by Stubbs. ,- â¢
The executive offices of the Southern
Pacific will be given up in the Mills build
ing in New York and the entire executive
headquarters of the company will be re
moved to the Equitable building. A mer
chant of this city who recently arrived
here from New York states that the exec
utive offices of -the Southern Pacific have
a deserted appearance. The signs on the
doors remain unchanged, even to the one
with "Collis P. Huntington, President,"
on it. ..
Harriman looks up<m Hays as a great
railroad manand feels assured that if he
leaves him alone and allows him to build
up the Southern Pacific on his own lines
it will be the Rreatest road in the world
in a few years. Hays in ' the â¢ same way
looks. upon Kruttschnitt as a most capa
ble man, and the general manager will In
the future be*the chief executive officer
of .the Southern Pacific whpnever Hays is
absent from the city. - Numerous 1 an
nouncements have been made by Krutt
schnitt's enemies that he woum be re
moved, but the reports are erroneous. 3
The Call this morning is. in a position
to outline the policy that will be pursued
by the Southern Pacific In the Immediate
future under direct orders of E. H. Harri
man. The most important feature Is that
Hays, as president of the. road," is.
in command and that hia' power is su
preme. Any new rule that he may make
is, ln the mind of Harriman, for the good
of the road. Harriman wants all the of
ficials to know that he does not wish
them to come and bother him -with their
woes, as their complaints will be : re
ferred back to President Hays." This "has
special reference -to Herrin and his Inti
mation that the company will still remain
ln politics.
A personal friend of E. H. Harriman
has just returned from New York. While
there he held several conferences with
Harriman and was told plainly by the
great railroad magnate what his views
are in reference to running the Southern

statement that the so-called Weakness of Men
Is not a weakness but symptoms of Inflam-

â¢ There is still a good deal of -talk going on about
Edison's ; new storage â¢ battery, but as there i has been
asyel-^no public test'the chances are the inventor has
put it in cold storage to await further developments.

Some surprise has been expressed by New York
papers that a recent picnic held by the anarchists of
that city was one of the most orderly affairs of the
kind on record, but they seem to have overlooked
the probability that the anarchists arranged the pic

We want.no commercial, fiscal nor political incor
poration of;the islands- and their people with us, and
it is the duty of the -American people to resist the
first step toward that end, which is "the free trade
proposed.
Governor Allen of Porto Rico has discovered this
in that island, where the bar to progress is the tropi
cal inertia of Jhe people. The sooner these physical
facts are known and admitted by,Americans the better.
' Physical, facts- are stubborn things. They do. not
yield to statutes and resist decrees. Every nation that
owns tropical possessions has found 'it, necessary to
work them for profit by some form of forced or ser
vile* labor.] ' .We ,- know .of nothing in the nature of
things that will >ever make our,: tropical possessions
an /exception/ ~ . ;. 'Â¦Â¦'...Â¦ , '.'' â¢ '. v-
0'UR contemporary, the Chronicle, is convinced:
Â¦ that law s can raise tropical wages to the level;
of wages in the temperate zone and equalize
the conditions of production. There is no instance
on record to. prove the case. True, the Chronicle
professes 'to have discovered that free .trade with Ha
waii has raised plantation wages higher than the
wages of agricultural production in California, 5 but we
are inclined to think' that this discovery is~ the fruit of â¢
zeal rather- than the statement of a fact.' If a fact, it Â¦
disproves that which it is, intended to, establish, since,
if Hawaiian wages are -higher, there is inequality in
stead of equality as a res'ult of common fiscal ar- â¢Â¦
rangements. , - â¢;. Â¦-"' Â»'."'.Â¦ . _-Â¦'Â¦_
Last fall there was widely published the joint con- .
elusions of an enterprising Chinese business man and
an American in Luzon,, that. the industrial .develop
ment of the Philippines must be wrought by Chinese
coolie labor. Both agreed as to the worthlessness of
the native labor. "They proposed to introduce a large
coolie population,; which the Chinese gentleman de
clared would, by its labor, make the islands the richest
part of the world. .-They agreed that if dependent on
native labor the islands would never be. of commer
cial importance. v . Â¦ ! .
FISCAL AND WAGES.
It is indeed a sad situation when men; some of
whom have held the highest office -in the gift of the
people of their State, others of whom, have served
valiantly in war, and all of whom are men of ability
and patriotism, admit they- are without leadership or
means to 7 contest against a scheme fraught with Â¦ so
much injustice to one-half the population and carry
ing a menace to: all. That is the evil that has be
fallen "the South from the unchecked dominance of a
The two former Governors do not stand alone in
the fight. One of the most prominent Confederate
veterans in the State has recently, written a letter to
a member of the convention, saying: "The whole
scheme is of partisan politics, and in my judgment,
can be defeated. . But this defeat cannot be" accom
plished by Republican opposition. Tt^ must be done
by Alabamans acting independently of either.' party,,
on the platform of justice and obedience, to the su-.
preme law of the land. * * * The politicians have
organized this movement. . Our opposition is without
leadership -or means to contest. The negroes are ex
cited, anxious, but fearful to contend. It is a sad
situation. In my last talk with General Gordon he
said it would be the wildest folly for us* to attempt
to disfranchise the negroes." Â¦
Ex-Governor Johnson of Alabama has declared his
opposition to any unfair treatment of the negro, and'
proposes a poll tax and educational qualification which
shall apply equally to both races. Ex-Governor Jones
takes a similar position on the question, and in a re
cent letter said: "It is true that under the qualifica
tions proposed a good many negroes can vote; but
there will probably be not enough, even if badly dis
posed, to exercise evil control. The plan seems to
be the only feasible and practical one, if the restric
tions of the constitution and our pledges are-sub
stantially complied with. -Besides, I do not believe
that it is for the good of either race that the negr8
race should be shut out from all hope, and that every
individual of the race, no matter what his good char
acter, intelligence and interest in the community, shall

THE SOUTH AND THE NEGRO.
FROM a number of Southern men of prominence
and influence in their various localities there
have come earnest protests against tlie schemes
of the Bourbon politicians to virtually disfranchise the
negroes by the establishment of constitutional qualifi
cations so cunningly drawn as to shut out black men
from the polls while admitting white men of every
grade and degree.

The movement of Chicago University to establish
affiliated colleges in Europe is a very good adver
tising scheme, but for educational purposes it would
have been better to establish them in the South, where
colleges are needed. . â¢ : .
In this connection credit must be given to the pub
lic-spirited citizen who has taken the trouble to swear
out warrants for the arresl-of the schemers. Cashier
Smith of the Columbian Banking Company has not
suffered more than others from the frauds practiced
by the conspirators, but he has taken upon himself
the task of a prosecution which is to be for the bene
fit of a!L For that he deserves the thanks of the com
munity.
It is safe to say it will be a long time before any
such scheme will be again tried in San Francisco.
The eyes of the public have been opened. Hereafter,
when a deserving charity asks for support from our
people, there will be no fear that it is a scheme worked
for private interest. Our homes, hospitals and asy
lums will stand upon their own merits and will appeal
directly to the liberal and benevolent people of the
city. The result will be that* every dollar intended
for charity will go to charity, and not one of the
many noble institutions of the kind in San Francisco
will' have to content itself with a scant percentage of
that which the people are willing to bestow.
Bj' the exposure oi the gang who were so cun- .
ningly operating for private gain under the forms of
sen-ing public charities The Call has not only saved
the community from being defrauded, but it has pre
served the charitable associations and institutions!
themselves from a menace which threatened them.
Under the schemes of the entertainment promoters the I
charity that consented to lend its name to their pur
poses obtained only :Â» small percentage of the money
actually raised. Thus a wrong was done to the charity
itself as well as to the person who patronized the en
tertainment under a belief that all money raised was
to go to charity.
Since the matter is before the courts The Call has
no desire to prejudice the case of any one of the ac
cused. The story of the various schemes has been
published with the names of many, if not all, of the
persons engaged in them, and facts clearly stated
showing the deceptive character of the means resorted
to for the purpose of obtaining money. It is now for
the law authorities to gather that information and
present it in due form to the courts. The issue is
in fact with the law officers, and to them the public
will look for 7.eal and efficiency in prosecuting every
one of the guilty parlies against whom a citizen can
be found to make complaint
IN THE HANDS OF THE LAW.
BY reason of complaints sworn out against them
as parties to a conspiracy to obtain money
by false pretenses, a number of the men and
women who have been engaged in working up so
called charity entertainments in this city have~been
arrested and are now in the hands of the officers of
the law. That is one of the results of the exposure
made by The Call of the schemes of the effenders and
of their methods of working. It means that not only
has any further wrong at the hands of thesej?arties
been prevented in this or any other city on the Pacific
Coast, but that there is a fair prospect that some at
least of the conspirators will be punished.
POSTMASTER IN POLITICSâ F. H., I
Dos. Angeles, Cal. There is no Federal
law or postal regulatfo'n that prevents a
Postmaster from 1 exercising his rights as
an American .citizen, as to political % mat
ters but is he should neglect his business
as Postmaster for the purpose of engag
ing in active politics, he would soon hear
from the postal , authorities.- The depart
ment is governed by the' circular letter
sent by v President CWfjland . July. . 14,
1886 to the heads of departments in the
service of the general government warn
ing them and' their subordinates 'against
"using their ifRcial positions in attempts
to control political movements in tnelr
localit ies." That letter contains ' the I fol
lowing sentence: "Office-holders are nei
ther disfranchised nor forbidden the ex

privileges"' ar,e not; enlarged nor 'is their
duty to party. increased to pernicious ac

PRESERVATION OF . SKINS-W. H.,
Occidental, Cal. To preserve skins with

rlmove wash, clean and carefully scrape
off all flesh. To one gallon of hot water
add one pound of alum and one-quarter
pound of salt. When dissolved and. cool
enough to admit the entrance of the hand
in the solution, immerse the skins for
twenty-four hours; then dryand rub the
skins after which immerse for twenty
four hours in oatmeal and hot water and
finally rub until entirely dry. This leaves
the skin like white leather and fit for im

PERSONAL MENTION. â¢
In a certain way the assembling>of so large a num
ber of persons in the city appeals tb our business in
stincts as well as to our hospitality. With, the ever
improving transportation facilities between us and
the East, San Francisco becomes more and more ac
cessible as a convention city. It will be our own fault
if we do not make it the most popular city, in^ the
Union for summer gatherings of all kinds. The way
to accomplish that is to take good care of every con
vention that conies. The question of properly enter
taining the Epworth League is the issue before us
just now. Money is needed. San Francisco is rich
and liberal. Let the money be^protnptly contributed.
It is gratifying that arrangements have been made
to supply the v visitors with information concerning
California as a land Jor home-seekers as well as a
holiday. land for conventions and tourists. The Ep
worth League is made up almost, wholly of young
people of the best classes. The members represent
all kinds of business and professional life. They come
from the shops, the fields, the offices and the schools
of the country; they' are well trained 'mentally and
morally; are industrious, earnest and high-minded.
Such men with their youth and energy would be most,
excellent additions to our citizenship. It is safe to
say that among them will be many who have not yet
permanently settled in life, and consequently.' the.
chances for, California to wirumany of them to make
their homes within her borders are good.
It is estimated that the number of visitors who will
attend the convention will be upward of 30,000. The
time- when they will arrive is less than a month away.
At a meeting of the finance committee on Monday
evening it was reported- that the contributions up to
that time amounted in round numbers to $10,000. In
the judgment of the committee the arrangements for
the convention cannot be properly carried out for less
than $25,000. â¢ There remains, therefore, something
like $15,000 to be raised. The sum is large enough
to show the need of liberality, but . it is a moderate
amount for a work of hospitality undertaken upon a
scale sufficient to meet the needs of such a host of
visitors. , â¢
OUR EPWORTH VISITORS.
AS the date of the arrival of the delegates to
the Epworth League convention draws nearer
the various committees in charge of the local
arrangements feel more and more the need of money.
The right preparation for so large a convention can
not be. made with scant funds, nor can the,commit
tees well afford to wait long for the collection of
money. Hence it follows there should be liberal con
tributions, and that they should be promptly made.

The water by which Mare Island navy-yard is ap
proached needs attention. That yard and its facilities
should be made approachable by our heaviest war
ships in order that repairs and construction may go'
on there. We desire to impress this deeply upon the
committee. There is a yard in which the - Govern
ment can most economically do a large part of its
own work upon its own ships, and public interests of
the first order require that this should be made
possible.
The rivers of the great valley of California require
attention. The committee should understand that 75
per cent of all the tonnage of California is affected
by water transportation. The San Joaquin, . Sacra
mento and Feather rivers share the haul with the rail
ways and one is a check upon the other. The rivers
are under Federal jurisdiction and require constant
and scientific attention. The navigation of the Sac
ramento from Red Bluff to Suisun Bay. and of the
San Joaquin to the same waters is of great im
portance to the people and should not be neglected
by Congress. If those natural . waterways were not
there the producers would be longing for canals to
carry their traffic. But nature has furnished water
ways, and all that man need do is to improve and
keep them open.'
Other work is required in the main bay, in the
removal of obstructions and the deepening of shoal
places in the ship channel.. . . Â¦ Â¦
What is needed now is just what Senator Perkins
and Congressman Metcalf have agreed shall be done.
The channel, from the. westerly end of the training
walls, is to be widened to 500 feet to Chestnut street,
thence 300 feet wide to Fallon street, with a depth of
25 feet the entire distance. Around the basin
the channel is to be 300 feet wide and 12 feet deep.
This will open a long water front to deep-water ships,
but will do no more than the growing commerce
requires.
The people of that town have stubbornly and suc
cessfully defended their position, and the tidal canal
is under contract for completion. Oakland's inter
ests and, secondarily, those of San Francisco, are far
away from a drainage proposition, and run entirely
to the completion of the harbor for commercial pur
poses. While sewage and the. mud carried by the
canal will require more expense in keeping the basin
and channel free, the pump dredge can do it. '
If the plans for that work were to "be. made origin
ally now they would perhaps be different from those
made in the beginning. The pump dredge would
make entirely unnecessary the tidal canal by which
San Leandro Bay is to be used as a flushing basin to
increase the tidal prism for the purpose of scouring
out the channel. If made now it would-be seen that
the whole Oakland basin and channel present extra
ordinary facilities for a harbor protected against the
inflow of mud, and that the tidal canal removes such
protection and opens the basin to receive the mud
that has shoaled San Leandro Bay. But' meantime
the sewer system of Alameda has been planned to use
the harbor_ basin and channel as an outlet to deep
water for the drainage of that city, and so the tidal
canal is considered necessary in order to make a
sufficient current to carry off the sewage of Alameda.
OUR RIVERS AND HARBORS,
THE visit to this coast of Chairman Burton, and
members of the Rivers' and Harbors Committee
is for public business and purposes of the high
est interest to California. '.They have already ex
amined the matters. with which they have to do. in
Southern California, along the midway coast and the
southern part of the bay of San Francisco. They will
now address themselves to those which concern the
larger commerce that enters by the Golden Gate.
The chief of these is Oakland harbor. The plans
for tjÂ»at improvement-were drawn long ago by the
Government engineers, and , : the work has proceeded
fitfullj'. The expanding uses of that harbor have long
been treading upon. the heels of the work, until now
its completion has come to be a matter affecting San
Francisco and Oakland alike. Unless a certain and
valuable part of our commerce can find facilities there
it must soon 'leave the bay altogether and seek else
where the room denied to it on these waters.
It will be seen from these statements that while the
Bourbons dominate Southern politics at present, their
power is by no means secure. There is a growing
spirit of revolt against them all along the line, and
it may prove in the end that the very steps they are
taking to fasten their domination upon the' people
will lead to their overthrow.- : â¢ " '
| It is to be rioted, moreover, that some Southern
men are of the opinion that to impose an educational
qualification upon the negro, while exempting the
white man" from it, will in the'end lead to negro supre
macy^ inasmuch it will set a premium upon education
among the negroes,! while no such premium will ex
ist among the whites. In expounding that view of the
question the Atlanta Constitution says: "The nation
building up its material resources must-eclipse the
one content with, the achievement of past ages. The
same is true as between races individuals. Ap
plied to the States of the South, while some short
sighted people-regard only the political aspect and
would legislate for white dominance thrdligh black
exclusion, the question must be. regarded in its larger
light. A partial victory gained, the rear contest still
remains, for the colored man going to college will be
better armed than the white man remaining in "the
field, notwithstanding the possession of the franchise
by the latter. Of what use>Â±o the white man is the
franchise if the negro possesses the key to every other
avenue of life which education, opens up to him?
While this white man may become a county Sheriff or
a Tax Collector, -the educated negro in possession of
the secrets of nature and skill can afford to pass him
by with somewhat of an air of
single party. In the whole ' commonwealth of Ala
bama there is no organized machinery to defeat the
schemes of political bosses. , The intelligence and vir
tue of the State seem' to.be about as powerless in
this emergency, as the negroes themselves. . : ,

According to the statements made yes
terday by the leaders in the strike of the
Ironworkers, matters remained In a pas
sive state/labor's ranks losing no men.

executive men In the; controversy, both
declared that neither side had gained nor
lost a point. :
Regarding: the calling out of. the militia

the Moran Bros, shipyards, they claimed"
to have received no advices. On behalf
of the local machinists they desire it
stated that no member of any union af
filiated with the iron trades was con
cerned In an alleged assault made on
some men working in, the Golden State
and Miners' Iron Works on Monday night
at the corner of First and Market streets.
It was laid on the shoulders of some ir
responsible persons whom the union dis
claims^ Â¦ !
Since May 20. Ironmolders' Union x No.
164 has received seventy-five new mem
bers. Despite the strained conditions ex
isting, the members of the union are go-
Ing to forget their troubles next" Sunday
and picnic at Fernbrcok Park. A big
list of gate prizes will be distributea,
many of these being contributed by the
firms and corporations for which the men

The Upholsterers' Union is also prepar
ing for a picnic at Sunset Park on June
80, at which $500 worth of furniture will
be distributed to the guests.
The Journeymen Butchers' Union had a
long meeting at the Turk-street Temple
and was addressed by National Organizer
Jeff D. Pierce, who advised" the seventy
or eighty members present who have as
yet not been able to return to their em
ployment to "stand with their union." He
said: "If your bosses ask you if you be

ferred to a strike on the New 'York Cen
tral Railroad in Buffalo a few years ago.
in which he said he took an active part,
and told how In the face of defeat Hfe had
brought the men around to a realization
of their rights. He strongly urged upon
the members of the union not to give up
the charter, but remain true to the cause.
. Sanderson, Ma^es Statement.
F. W. Sandersoi^ business agent of the
Journeymen Butchers' Workmen's Pro
tective Union No. 115, replying to the
statement made regarding him by Presi
dent H. C. Flageollet of the Retail Boss
Butchers' Association, says:
I wish to, disabuse the mind of that gentle
man of some errors that he haa fallen into,
and also to set myself right before the public.
It Is true that I was elected business agent
of the Journeymen Butchers' W. P. Union
No. 115, also that I distributed the most of
the union cards. It Is also true that I told
those who accepted ' the card that they could
display them or not, , Just as they chose â which
I was instructed to do by the executive com
mittee. Mr. Flageollet, with many others, was
very glad to "carry water upon both should
ers." He Informed me that he had some cus
tomers who would not trade with him if 'he
displayed the card, and " others who would not
trade with him if he did riot -have It, and that
he was going to plav the game of "now you
see It and now yoa don't. 1 '. "
As business agent I reported some of the
shops not keeping to their agreements by try
ing to beat the clock at both ends; some of
them would open shop at- 5 a. m. and keep
open. long after 6 p. m., but I asked the union
for a little leniency p.nd for further time before
official action should be taken In their cases,
as the agreements were new. It was net be
cause they did not display the union card.
Finally, it was not the union that struck,
but the slaughterers and some of the jobbers
utruck, and then the . union had to meet the
issue. "
I am not apologizing for the part I took In
the strike and whatever opproprium. If any,
thÂ© citizens of San Francisco wish to cast upon
me, I am willing to bear, but as I am a mourn
er at that funeral, I should like the truth to
prevail. Respectfully submitted,
F. W. SANDERSON,

Deputy Tax Collector McCabe yesterday
sold four pieces of property for the State
to private parties for non-payment of
taxes The sum derived from the sales
amounted to $870, of which more than $400
will revert to the city as its portion of the
delinquent taxes. The Property Is sit
uated in this city and was deeded to the
State in 1900. Application was made to
the State Controller, who authorized Tax
Collector Scott to sell the property.
Ex-Supervisor Aigeltinger was the pur
chaser for $510 of the undivided half of
an "irregular shaped lot on Point Lobos

amounted to $10 23, together with costs in

ALL of the prominent leaders of
the Epworth League have prom
ised to attend the convention to be
held here next month, and per
haps the best known of these are
Bishop Joyce and Dr. Berry. Bishop
Joyce Is a native of Indiana, and has been
a pastor of the Methodist church since
early manhood. He has held charges in
several of our largest cities, and ks con
ceded to be one of the leading lights In
the religious world. He has traveled ex
tensively abroad, and is the author of
numerous publications. He holds the
presidency of the national organization
of the Epworth League. His presence is
one of the chief attractions of the con
vention.
Dr. Berry is a native of Michigan. He
Is the secretary of the Epworth League
and the editor of the Epworth League
Herald, which has the largest circulation
of any publication for young people. At
the last general conference he would
have undoubtedly been elected to the
bishopric had he not withdrawn. He dis
charged pastoral duties in Detroit and
in other cities of Michigan for thir
teen vears. He then became editor of the
Christian Advocate, and from that he
went to establish the Herald, which has
been wonderfully successful. He is, very
energetic, and his work has accomplished
great good for his denomination and for
other religious people.

LETTER CAE.RIEHS WELL
HOLD DELIGHTFUL PICNIC
Committees Are Working Diligently
Rolla V. Watt, chairman of the finance
committee, says that he regards the re
quest for funds rather as a business prop
osition than as a solicitation for charity,
on account of the financial benefits which
will accrue to all commercial men from
It was the original intention of the con
vention financiers to start subscriptions
during the month of May, but owing to
the need of raising funds for the recep
tion to be tendered President McKinley
It was decided not to interfere with the
.success of that movement, In spite of the
disadvantage of delay.
It is calculated that the efpense of the
affair will be approximately the same as
for the Christian Endeavor convention in
1S97. The cost of that was in the neigh
borhood of $30,000. Five thousand dollars
has already been raised by various means,
and the public will be asked to contribute
but $25,000. The Christian Endeavorers
spent more than $1,000,000 In California,
and as there will probably be a larger at
tendance at this convention it is reason
able to suppose that a still greater sum
of money will be spent this time.
* Merely a Business Proposition.
* Â¦ . *
now but little more than a month distant,
met at the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation building Monday night to consider
measures in rega/d to raising funds to
defray the expenses of the affair. Some
apprehension is being felt in regard to
raising the necessary amount with the
convention so near at hand, but the plans
of the committee are fully arranged and
some canvassing has already "vteen done.
Last evening Captain Seymour received
Information that Helen Barnrs had se
cured various sums of money from the
various breweries in this city.
The woman reprÂ«>pentÂ»d herself as one
ff the directors of "the San Francisco
Boys' Home." wh!ch is a concern run by
a man nam"d Hutchinson. Some of the
brewers will be seen to-day by the de
tectives, and it is honed that complaints
Â¦n-ill be sworn to which will prove that
H^Ipti Barnes and Donesrhy are fully en
titled to a terra in the County Jail.
In the event of a failure to convict all
the parries of a conspiracy to obtain
money by fraud, special charges of
obtaining money by fraud will possibly be
lodged against Doneghy and Helen
Earnes.
The expose cf the charity fakers by The
Call had the effect yesterday of bringing
forward persons who swore to felony com
plaints against Mamlock, the associate of
Doneghy and Helen Barnes.
In addition to that of H. A- Moss, who
was swindled by Mamlock out of $100, two
more complaints were lodgred-apainst the
missins: man. Mamlock. C. H. Morrell. of
room â¬3, Hearst building, charged Mam
lock with having swindled him out of $63
by means of a bogus life insurance policy.
Ex-Senator Lcavitt also charged Mamlock
with having collected sums of money for
him and having stolen the same. With
the charjros of felony against Mamlock. he
b wanted more than ever by Chief of De
tpctivos Captain Seymour. A general
slam was ispiifd for Mamlock, who is
supposed to be hiding in this and his
description was telegraphed to Los An
geles and Portland, in case he escaped
fr-irn the city on Monday.
Captain of Detectives Seymour Is most
r<os'.roT!s of convicting Doneghy, Helen
Barnes and Mamlock. The women arrest
<-d on Monday are rimply regarded as will-
Iric dupes, and while there Is no doubt of
their complicity in the swindles perpe
trated, the desire of the police is to punish
the leaders of the charitable frauds
As a result of the investigation Judge
Fritz decided to allow some of the women
to be released on their own recognizances.
Julie Howie. Belle Smith and Mrs. C. E.
Â¦\Vilcoac, who accompanied Mamlock to
this city from Los Angeles, pledged them
selves to report to Judge Fritz this morn
ing and to appear for trial to-morrow
afternoon. The women evidently were
frank in their statements that they had
joined Mamlock in Los Angeles in answer
to an advertisement and had come to this
â¢city to work for a salary, which, they as
serted, had never been paid to them. The
three women were absolutely -without
means, and Detective Dinan gave them a
few dollars, while other parties furnished
them with a breakfast, as they had not
eaten a meal since Monday night.
Ieabelle McDonald was released on $5
bail. She was hired by Mamlock a week
ago to sell his bogus- tickets, and thV wo
man evidently knew nothing of the fraud
Fhp was participating- in.
Judge Fritz was induced by Doneghy's
attorney to reduce the bail for the accused
man and also to allow Helen Barnes and
Mae Deiweiller to secure their liberty for
a. less sum than originally fixed. Doneghy
was set at liberty by putting up $100 cash
bail, and his chief aid, Helen Barnes, was
released when $50 in gold coin was deposit
ed. A like sum was demanded by Judge
Fritz in the case of Mae Deiweiller.
JuJge Fritz went to the City Prison in
the afternoon and questioned the various
women in custody. He was accompanied
by Assistant District Attorney Hanley,
and the accused women were interrogated
closely.
An application for a reduction of bail
for the defendants was taken under ad
visement by Judge Fritz until the after
noon session of court.
Judge Cabaniss, who released Doneghy
on $liw bail, learned later in the day that
he had been deceived by certain friends of
the accused man and requested Judge Fritz
to increase the bail to the original amount
of Sim bond or $500 cash. Judge Fritz
tiid so. and once again Doneghv was ar
rested by Detectives Wren and Dinan and
jiiaced in custody.
judge Kritz, however, turned a deaf ear
to the appeals of the Police Court lawyers
acd put the cases over until to-morrow
afternoon.
Assistant District Attorney Hanley
asked that the case go over until to-mor
row at 2 p. m,, to which request the attor
neys for the defendants entered vigorous
objection.
Although Doneghy secured his release on
$100 bail in the early hours of the morning,
he came into court with a worried aspect,
ilelea Barnes, who has traveled witn
uoxieeny lor six years and is considered
a. dangerous operator by tne police, looked
paie and haggard after a nignt in prison.
lhree Ponce Court attorneys appeared
lor the accustsd persons, and when the
case was called by Judge .Kritz the attor
neys all tried to talk at the same time.
One of tne attorneys wanted Doneghy
instantly dismissed on the ground thai he
vaa as Innocent as a Jumu; another de
clared that Helen Barnes was an Injured
woman and was a true philanthropist,
while the third lawyer assured the court
that his clients had simply worked as em
ployes of Mamlock and were Ignorant oÂ£
ins doings.
Considerable interest was displayed yes
terday mornins when the leaders of the
band, W. W. Doneghy and Helen Barnes,
were arraigned before Police Judge A. J.
Kritz on a charge of obtaining- money Y-y
false pretenses. With the two arch con
spirators the police lined up a number of
v.'omen who had also been caught In the
drag net. but of whose gruilt there is some
doubt. Julie Howie, Belle Smith. Mrs. C.
E. Wilcox and Isabelle McDonald are the
four women who sold tickets for the
EWiadler, Harry Mamlock. who Is badly
wanted by the police. The women spent
the night in jail and presented an un
happy appearance when brought into the
Police Court. Another of the accused
parties was Mae Deiwelller. who came to
this city with Doneghy, having Joined his
band in Denver.
"With the arrest of the leaders of the
ban<l of "charity workers" who have in
fested this city for the past few weeks
an effectual stop has been put to their
nefarious calling.

; This can be done by the regular use after,
meals of some safe.\'pleasant and effective di-
gestive preparation, like Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets; which may ' be v found at most {drug
stores.'- and which contains valuable, 1 - harmless
digestive elements in a pleasant,- convenient
form.
. ;It is safe to say 'that the .regular ' persistent
use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at meal time
will cure any form | of stomach trouble except
eancer of. the stomach. ' â¢ .
The most Â¦ sensible treatment for heart trou-
ble is , to improve the digestion and to insure
the prompt assimilation of food.
Poor. digestion also poisons the blood, making
it thin and watery, which irritates and weakens
the heart. ,-
In another way, also the heart Is affected by
the ' form of poor : digestion, which causes gas
and fermentation from' half :Â¦,; digested food.
There is a feeling of oppression and heaviness
in the chest caused by pressure of the distended
stomach on the heart ' and lungs,' '; Interfering
with their action; hence arises; palpitation and
short breaUi v
The close relation between heart trouble and
poor, digestion is because both organs are con-
trolled by the same great nervesâ the Sympa-
thetic and Pneumogastrlc.
Heart trouble, at least among the Americans,
Is certainly increasing.- and while this may be
largely due to _ the excitement ana worry of
American business life. It is more often the re-
sult of weak stomachs, of poor, digestion.
Real organic disease Is Incurable; but not one

NEW YORK, June IS.â The pressure to sell
stocks was effectual in breaking through re
sistance in the market to-day and carrying the
general level of prices to a materially lower
basis. There were a few spots of strength per
sisting and there were occasional successful ef.
forts to check the decline, which resulted in
rallies, by driving the room shorts to cover.
The bull element in the market by no means
abandoned It to the bears, and at recurring
periods, when the selling had spent its force,
there was alert readiness to bid up prices. Not
withstanding all devices, however, the sefling
was renewed in force in the final dealings and
carried prices to the lowest of the day, ex
cept for those stocks which had manifested
some strength. The closing was quite' active
and weak. The most potent influence in the
market was the condition engendered as to the
real status of the most discussed St. Paul deal
Investigation by independent authorities elicited
the opinion that negotiations, as was candidly
admitted for bringing St. Paul within the scope
of the community of interest working out in
the Western railroad world, but many of the
specific assertions which have been set afloat
by the very large speculative contingent which
is making the St Paul project the medium
for their operations were stripped to pieces.
The most important, of these was yesterday's
assertions .that 4 per cent bonds were to be
offered for St. Paul at the equivalent of "00
To-day's version of the project carried it no
further than an effort to secure the co-opera
tion of the Morgan-Hill holdings in St. Paul
with the Harriman-Kuhn-Loeb holdings in ex
change for co-operation of the holdings
of the latter interest with those of the
former In Northern' Pacific The holdings
of the Morgan-Hill syndicate In St. Paul
dating back to the efforts to secure
control previous to the purchase of Burlington
are known to be large. Another well defined
rumor had it that a hitch had occurred In th<Â»
contract alleged to have been made to sell a
large. block of St. Paul stock to Union Pacific.
St: Paul declined - nearly five points . as a re
sult of these rumors and Union Pacific three
and closed within a . small fraction of the low
est. Missouri Pacific suffered from realizing on
the ground that all the good news regarding
the stock was out and the independent steel
companies were sufferers from the same cause
the decline in Colorado Fuel reaching 10 and lii
Tennessee Coal 6%. Amalgamated Copper, re
acted 3Â»i from yesterday's upward spurt but
rallied strongly on the hopes of a Judicial de
cision to-day in favor of the company's merger
project The rally was mostly lost in the re
action of the market. The active exchange
market was explained by the selling of b'Us
against further Intended gold shipments, which
will po out on Thursday to Germany. It is
expected that the shipment will reach* $2,000 000
at leasi. The reduction tn the German bank
rate to-day Is explained by the unusually strong
position of that Institution and was taken In Its
quasi-public character as a Government insti
tution to ease the condition of distrust of finan
cial circles In Berlin, The call loan ratÂ» here
stiffened to S p*r cent again to-day. The stocks
which showed strength were Influenced entirely
by Individual cause*. The firmness of United
State* Stee; was based, on the declaration of
dividends by subsidiary companies. The newly
listed Distilling Company of America stocks
tÂ»-Â»r* advanced two and three points respective
ly for the common and preferred to slKnallae

in Southern California- Grapes are in good
condition, and prospects are excellent for a
large yield. Citrus fruits and walnuts are
looking well.
Sacramento Valley â The weather was cool
during the first of the week, becoming warmer
toward the close. With, the exception of north
erly winds, which caused slight damage to
grain in some sections, conditions have been
favorable for all crops, and grain and fruit
have matured rapidly. Haying is progressing
and a large crop, excellent In quality, is be
ing harvested. Grain harvest has commenced
in some localities; the yield is reported better
than anticipated, and wheat and barley are
*aid to be of superior quality. Corn, bops and

in all sections, and in some localities much
progress has been made. The cool weather
during the past two weeks was very beneficial
in allowing the heads to fill nicely, and the
yield, so far as the harvesting has progressed,
is very sa.tisfaetory. Some shipments of grain
have been made and the quality is reported
good. Peaches and apricots are being market

Grain harvest is progressing in nearly all
sections of the State. Wheat and barley are
reported as yielding fully an average crop in
most places north of the Tehachapl. and the

bles continue thrifty, and good crops are ex
pected. There is an unusually large acreage
of tomatoes in Sonoma County, and the vines

Â¦will be canned. Pasturage is becoming scarce
in some sections, but cattle are in good condi
tion.

GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
The -Weather and Crops..
"Brazil nuts are very strong, and It would be
hard, if not impossible, to buy a round lQt at
quotations. Holders probably will sell small
quantities more readily than lots of any size.
Jordan shelled almonds are firmer, holders ask
ing from 40c to 42c. Sicily filberts are easier
here and in Sicily."
"About 2.10O boxes of Oregon 30-40s prunes
were received in the market yesterday, all
coming to a prominent commision house. Sales
of several round lots cf these prunes were
made at 6Â»4C, at which price goods are still
offering, with a fair demand in a small way.
California prunes, raisins, apricots and peaches
are dull en the spot. There are reported offer
ings of future choice Itoral apricots at 8c, f. o.
b., in bars.
'"Currants continue very firm. The Alsatla
arrived yesterday with 2300 boxes and 1400
cases, but these goods arc closely controlled
and offered only in a small way at 9%c. About
500 barrels of the Alsatia's cargo were sold to
arrive. The vessel brought a large amount of
fresh fruits, which are now being unloaded.
It will be several days before the currants will
be taken off and distributed.
"Trade on the spot continues very dull, the
hot weather and the Increased supplies of green
fruits now coming into the markets having cut
down the consumptive demand for all dried
fruits to very small proportions.

An' active and eager demand for lard gave
the provision market a strong tone, carrying
up prices of pork and ribs to a strong close.
Buying- of lard was on such a scale that shorts
took alarm and helped by their purchases to

to the growing crop. Covering by shorts caused
an advance to 70%c. . the high point of the day.
Bradstreet's statement of the world's visible
supply was a disappointment to bulls, showing
133,000 bushels increase, instead of a large de
crease, and under free offerings the market de-,
clined to 69%c. Good shipping demand to

Apples continue firm, owing to the poor crop
outlook In the East, and the temporary weak
ness in the New York . market seems to have
passed away. Prunes are also in rather better
tone than they have been, owing to the short
crop here and the poorer crop prospects in
France. A deal Is said to be pending in Raisins
whereby a large- line will soon be sold. Nuts
and Honey continue dull and unchanged.

DECIDUOUS FRUITS
The canners say that they will rot take manv
Apricots this year, as the new English .tariff
on canned Apricots will shut California fruit
out of that important market. The market is
sufficiently supplied with this fruit, though
most of it is small and inferior.
Berries are offering freely and prices are
lower and weak. Currants keep up well.
Figs are coming in quite freely now and
prices are declining. Cherries, are on their
last legs. Peachfs. Apples, Pears and Plums
are plentiful, though no further decline is
noted.
I Bananas are quoted lower under heavy sup
plies. | Lemons and Limes are also plentiful
and weak. The demand for Oranges has fallen
off considerably, owing to the liberal supplies
of summer fruits, and this description is like
wise weak. Four cars are announced for to
day's auction.

Butter is dull. A good many people are out
of town, and were It not for the free cold stor
ing going on stocks would be excessive. Prices

ILLEN BEACH YAW
SCORES GREAT HIT
! Eleven years ago Adams' wife died and
after that he began to seek comfort in
the cup. The habit became so strong that
at last he succumbed and ' the climax
came the day he was read out officially
from . the ministry of ' the Episcopal
Church. This formal deposing occurred
a year ago last January. Bishop William
Ford Nichols performed the distressing
duty In San Francisco. Then Adams had
been rector of St. Andrew's church at
West Oakland. After he had been offi
cially ousted from the ministry he fell
rapidly. Brutality to his children became
so common that many times did Dr. Jes
sup. their Intimate friend, and others in
Berkeley interfere.
Miss Adams is at the residence of Mrs.
Arnold Steubenrach at 1741 Walnut street,
where she Is under Dr. Rowell's care. It
Sought Bottle When "Wife Died.
Deputy Coroner Streightiff took charge
of the case and removed the body to the
Morgue at Berkeley, where an. inquest
will be held. A charge of murder will
be registered against Adams at once.
The man who is now a murderer was in
a state bordering upon delirium tremens
at the County Jail to-day, and he was,'
like his victim, under 'medical attention.
His whisky-saturated brain was incap
able of -clear thought, but the former
clergyman managed to express his fervid
thanks that he had not' killed the man
who had for months stood between the
besotted parent and the daughter, who
is now critically ill from the effects of
last night's tragic affair, added to the
months of abuse to which her drink-rid
den father had subjected her. -Â¦:Â¦â¢Â¦.'
Pitiable as is the story of the downfall
of the once brilliant and scholarly, cleric,
the chapter that ended with the murder
of Dr. Jessup is the saddest. .
Murder Charge Against Adams.
BERKELEY, June 18.â Dr. John G. Jes
sup is dead. He passed away at 11:15
o'clock to-night at his residence, 2101
Hearst avenue, where he was taken after
he was shot by Charles G. Adams. The
attending surgeons gave up hope of re
covery several hours before the end came.
Although the wounded man rallied con
siderably after the first shock of the
shooting, giving the doctors much hope,
the continued severe internal hemorrhage
that could not be checked was deemed to
be a grave and alarming symptom.
During the earlier hours of, the even
ing the patient had to be kept under
opiates to ease the pain he was suffering
from the wound. At 10 o'clock this even
ing the change became so. marked for the
worse that the attending physicians gave
up all hope and saw the patient was sink
ing rapidly and would not -survive
through the night. The end came more
quickly than they expected. Death was
due to the shock and to extreme hemorr
hage. . ; .-
%V. J. Adams, brother of the arrested
man, came to Berkeley this morning and
called on his rtlece, Miss Agnes Adams,
and visited Dr. Jessup. He expressed no
desire to see his brother at the Oakland
jail. ' ..
This morning Adams' first query was
concerning the victim of his drunken
anger. v . .
â¢ "Thank God, Jessup Is not dead," he ex
claimed. '"It is all because of drink. I
shot my best friend .when I fired at Jesr
sup."
Dr. Jessup's -wife, from whom he is sep
arated, is living in Marln County with
their daughter. She sent word she would
like to see her husband, but the surgeons
refused to permit the visit to be made.
Adams Has Wealthy Sister. '
Shortly before the shooting took place
Dr. Jessup had been in conference with
Dr. Rowell, planning to remove Adams
to a private sanitarium, where he could
be watched and kept from drink and
eventually cured of his fearful vice. Dr.
Rowell was consulting -with District At
torney Allen concerning the case at the
very time Dr. Jessup was shot.
Adams has a wealthy sister in the East
who is said to have been assisting materi
ally in the support of the family. Twice
s*he has taken him out of homes for in
ebriates, where his friends had placed
him. Recently she sent him $800, which
has been consumed in his last prolonged
debauch.
is planned to take her to some sanitarium,
where absolute rest will be prescribed for
her.

PENDLETON, Or., June 18.â Buck
Horn, a Umatilla Indian, has been found,
wounded to death, with- a bullet in his
right side and another in his thigh. Buck
Horn and a Yakima Indian named John,
Something made a murderous attack on
the chief of the Indian police, Bristow.
when he attempted to arrest them. Joe
Par and Jack, Indian policemen, fired on,
the offending Indians, but it was thought
that none of the shots took effect, both
Indians getting away into the mountains.
Partisans of Buck Horn and Something
now claim that the shooting was due to
the indiscretion of Chief Bristow In en
raging the Indians by insults. If Buck
Horn dies a question of murder will bo
raised. A party of Indians to-day in

ONE of the leading social events
of the season in local Italian so
ciety will take place to-day at
St. Francis Church, when Miss
Ida Dal Valle will be married to
J. N. Sresovich.
Miss Dal Valle Is the daughter of Luigi
Dal Valle and one of the most accom
plished and popular young ladies in the
Italian colony. She has achieved con
siderable prominence in the local musi
cal world through her exceptional vocal
abilities, and for several years she has
been a leader in church charitable work.
Mr. Sresovich has long been a promi
nent member of various fraternities! In
the Native Sons and Druids he has held
the highest offices in the gift of the
lodges to which he belongs.. He is en
gaged in the fruit business with the well
known Sresovich firm, and has lately
been promoted to, the responsible .office
of secretary of the corporation.
Both of the young people have a host
of friends In exclusive Italian society,
and they start forth in married life with
enviable prospects. It is learned that
Miss Dal Valle will not relinquish her
leadership in philanthropic work.
The young couple are planning to enter
tain extensively " upon their return from
their bridal tour.
At the close of the ceremony to-day a
reception will be held in honor of the
event, to which a very large number of
friends have been invited. Miss Dal Valle
has already received many beautiful and
costly presents.
The couple will take a short bridal
tour to Southern California, after which
they will take up their residence in this
city.
The Commissioners adopted a resolution
requiring police officers on the sick list to
show cause why they should not be dis
missed from the force. This action was
taken in Â¦ order to determine whether or
not they should be retired ona pension
or dismissed. The latter procedure is a.
necessity in the cases of the officers who
have been unable to perform" duty for a
great length of time, . unless they., make
application for retirement.
Permits. to carry weapons were granted
twenty-one applicants, mainly/s employes
of various iron works. . . ' '.*Â¦Â¦ .Â¦

The Police Commissioners, at their
meeting last night, unanimously adapted
the plan suggested by Chief Sullivan,
whereby the police officers shall on and
after July 1 serve nine-hour watches.
Under the new plan the officers' watches
wlU be from 1 to 10 p. m." and from 10
p.m. to 7 a. m. From 1 a. m. to 1 p. m.
will be known as the "short watch," and
will be kept by , men selected from the
1 to 10 p. m. watch. By this. means each
officer will perform duty nine hours daily
with the exception of one day Jn forty,
when he will remain on duty fifteen
hours.
Officer Cleveland Peters was fined $10
for reporting for. duty forty minutes late.
The case of Officer Greenan, charged with,
neglect of duty, was laid over for a week
on account of a defect in the complaint.

SEATTLE, Wash.. June 18.-The steamer
T>.ome City, the first of the Nome fleet,
arrived this evening direct from Cape
*.ome. having sailed for Puget Sound on
June 8.
The Nome City managed to find an open
channel in the ice a considerable distance
west of the usual course taken by vessels
sailing for that place and succeeded in
reaching within a few miles of Nome. She
discharged her passengers and cargo on
the Ice. Just as everything was safely
taken to the mainland the ice broke and
the steamer had a hard time in working
her way back to the open sea. Before the
Ice broke, however, ten passengers â six
women and four menâ succeeded in board-
Ins her.
The steam schooner Jeauie was the first
vessel to reach Nome this year. She had
landed her freight and passengers befofe
the Nome City arrived, and started on her
return voyage three days ahead of the
r\ome City, but has not arrived. The cap
tain of the Nome City expressed the opin
ion that no other vessel will reach Nome
before the latter part of this month, as
the lee had broken in many -places and
was rapidly closing in the open channel.
The passengers report that Nome dur
ing- the winter was well provided with pro
visions, there v.as but little sickness and
the weather was good with the exception
of one or two severe storms.
On May 25 Nome was subjected to a
most disastrous fire. The blaze started
in a building at the corner of Stedman
avenue and First street and soon leaped
across to the old Court building. Later
the Washington Trading Company's
building and the Smille-Campbell building
caught. The lire department encountered
the greatest difficulty in fighting the
flames, owing to the hose being filled with
ice. Judge T. P. Ryan and his wife bare
ly escaped with their lives, losing all their
possessions in the way of furniture and
clothing. The total losses are placed at
S12fi,â¬50. Business has been resumed and
the effects of the fire are not expected to
result in more than a temporary blow to
the prosperity of the town.
The winter proved without a doubt that
Nome is a winter camp. Within a radius
of eight miles from the city, dumps have
been taken out which will wash up in the
neighborhood cf $500,000. These dumps
are on Dexter, Bourbon, Newton, Grouse,
"Wonder. Dry. Otter, Anvil. Glacier and
Snow and represent the work of but a
limited number of men, in many instances
it being little more than an experiment.
The fuel proposition is the one thing
that militated against the taking out of
more dumps in this district during the
winter. With coal so high and wood im
possible to get, the owner of ordinary
ground was barred upon opening up his
claim* because of the expense. With coal
at $25 a ton the year round, many claim
owners will be enabled to haul fuel in to
their ground and take out winter dumps,
which will materially swell the output of
the camp. In the first rush to the camp
during the early winter and spring of 1899
a large proportion of -this ground that is
now producing heavily was overlooked or
passed by as useless by men who were
looking for a second Anvil Creek. Espe
cially true Is this of Newton. Wonder,
Saturday, Otter, Grouse and Nugget,
which lie at Nome's very door. They
were passed over by inexperienced men
and it remained for a Dawsonite to come
along- and find what was hidden beneath
the streams.
In nearly every instance the streak is
deep, and it may be that this discouraged
the prospector who had seen gold taken
out of Anvil from the grass roots down.
The Dawson "sour dough" is used to deep
digging, and the deeper it gets the more
he is at home, so it is not surprising that
he has found the pay on these -blind
streams and is reaping the benefit. Prob
ably the largest dump to be washed up in
the vicinity of Nome is on Grouse Gulch,
the property of the Bowery Mining Com
pany, composed of Vallaire, Thompson &
Hastings. It is estimated that these men
have taken out during the winter $100,000,
which will be washed up as soon as the
thaw finally sets in.
Reports from Council City and Topkuk
Btate that a great deal of work has been
done in those districts and that the clean
up this spring will approximate a half
million dollars. On Ophir Creek in the
Council district are several very large
dumps, the properties of the Wild Goose
and other large companies. Large dumps
have also been taken out on Crooked and
Sweet Cake creeks in this same district
ar.d good money has been rocked on the
Topkuk beach. From prospecting already
done in the Bluestone and Kouerarok dis
tricts there will be numerous gold bearing
creeks uncovered during the coming sum
mer.
Miners we!! able to judge venture the
opinion that the richest ground yet found
in Alaska will be opened ud in the Koug
arok district th!s year. Eight or ten
creeks are known to be rich, among them
bein? Quartz, Dahl. Garfield. Harris. Cof
fee. Marklin. Boulder and Goose. In the
Hluestone district. Gold Run and Alder
are known to be very rich, and many
nther creeks are well spoken of. Litiga
tion will retard the growth of this dis
trict, there being scarcely a claim on
fither creek that is not tied up in some
way. The calendar of the LTnited States
District Court is filled with cases from
this district, till it is now as much as a
man's life is worth to even walk over one
of the claims. Several shooting scrapes
Viave occurred. Both Oold Run and Alder
have been staked and restaked so often
that the ground thereabouts presents the
appearance of en Indian burying ground.

Later in the day the Board of Public
Works consented to be' a party to the
charter violation ' by allowing the Board
of Education to award the contract and
go on with the work under the supervision
of Superintendent Barnett. In order to be
relieved of the work of preparing plans
and Inviting proposals the first named
board is compounding a manifestly illegal
proceeding. : . .
Another feature of the charter violation
was the visit made to the Auditor by
members of the Board to inquire whether
he would audit the demands for the work
ordered by < it. Auditor Wells, v who was
primed with the information secured from
one of the irregular bidders, peremptorily
informed the Directors that he would only
sign the demands if the bids were invited
by the Board" of Public Works in the reg
ular way. .
"It is quite likely," said Hansen, "that
Directors Denman or Casserly, who have
charge of repairs to school buildings,
asked some people to submit bids for the
work. This was only done to get some
idea of the cost."
I Proceeding Is Irregular.
When asked if this was a regular pro
ceeding Hansen acknowledged that it was
not and said if he had been asked for his
advice on the question he would have
ruled that it was illegal and that under
the charter the Board of Public Works
alone could have the work done after
requisition had been made upon it by the
Board of Education. The last named
board was preparing to award the con
tract when the Auditor called a halt.
When Hansen was asked why bids for
the work had not been advertised for in
the regular way he said he did not know.
"This is a bid for the painting of the
interior of Washington Grammar School,"
said Schnee. V . - . .
"I know nothing about any bids having
been invited for the work," replied Han
sen. ,r . I
"Well," said Schnee,' "I was told to put
in a, bid for the work and here it is."
"Two other persons must have been told
the same thing," said Hansen, "as I have
received two bids for' the same work. . I
will take your bid, however, and present
it to the Board with the.two others."
The discovery that the Board of Educa- I
tion was ignoring the plain provisions of |
the charter was made quite accidentally !
by Auditor Wells yesterday.' One of the j
contractors who said he had filed the low- |
est bid with the Board of Education to
do the painting called on the Auditor to )
ascertain if, the "proceedings were regular I
and he was informed . that unless the
charter provisions placing the responsibil- ! .
ity of the improvement in the hands of j
the Board of- Public Works was complied j
with, he would not. be paid, if he was
awarded the contract.
Board Neglects to Advertise.
It further developed that the Board of
Education, even if it had the power to Â¦
Invite bids, had disregarded the law./
which requires that they shall be invited
by notices placed for five days in the-ad
vertising columns of the official newspa
per. Only two other bids were submitted
besides that of Schnee's and the three
bidders evidently received some; ins'de
information that the interior of the build
ing named was to be painted. This of it
self defeats the plain purpose of public
notice "for work to be done In order to
Insure plenty of competitive bids.
Schnee visited the Board of Education's
rooms last Monday and handed the enve
lope containing his bid to Secretary Han
sen.
The Board of Education has been de
tected in another violation o& the char
ter in the irregular invitation of , ' bids
for the painting and whitening of the
interior of the Washington Grammar
School building at a cost of several hun
dred dollars. -This action was taken not
withstanding that the organic law' of the
city specifically prqvides that the clean
ing, repairs and improvement of all pub
lic buildings shall be under the supervi
sion of the Board of Public Works, which
shall advertise for bids if the cost Is in
excess of $250. . \

Edward Wilson Writes
Vulgar Epistles on.
Linen/
Postal Authorities Will UsÂ©
His Effusions as Evi
dence.
Because Anna Crane, a young woman
who resides at 1705 Eddy street, resented
his attentions, Edward R. Wilson.- a
waiter living: at 1113 Treat avenue, wrote
obscene and scurrilous letters to her. The
young woman stood the epistolary fire as
long as she could, and then notified the
United States Postal Department. Wil
son was arrested last night by United
States Marshal Shine and lodged befflnd
the bars of the County Jail.
Miss Crane complained to the postal
authorities that Wilson had persistently
annoyed her without cause. She tried to
keep away from him, but he made it a
point to meet her at unexpected places.
When she avoided him he commenced to
write filthy letters. Frequently, 4 instead
of using writing paper, he inscribed his
vulgar thoughts on cuffs or portions of
shirt bosoms and sent them through tho
mail. At first the young lady^paid little
attention to his affronts, except to return
a few of his letters. But when they com
menced to come faster than she could
send them back she invoked the aid of the
Postal Department to have them stopped.
Before notifying the authorities, how
ever, she warned Wilson to desist, but ho
only laughed at her warning.
Most of Wilson's literary efforts are
now in the hands of the postal authorities
and they will be used as evidence against
him. This with the testimony of Miss
Crane, the authorities claim, makes a
very strong case against the accused.

A man in Mtlford. Ind., says he did not
quit drinking coffee because he thought
it hurt him, but because he found a morn-
Ing beverage he liked better in Postum
Food Coffee, but to his wonder and sur-
prise he found in a few weeks all of the
old symptoms of sickness had left him.
He r-ad been greatly troubled with his
etomach and heart, also with what is
called "water, brash," and dull head-
aches, "which made me very irritable and
q u ick-tem pered ."
All of these symptoms disappeared and
he discovered, in spite of all his previous
theories, that coffee was really the cause
of his troubles, and .the leaving off of
coffee and taking on Postum Food Coffee
brought about a perfect care.
He speaks also of Mrs. Josephiene
Kelly. lU'ine at Elkhart. Ind. Says she
was afflicted much as he. was. but had be-
come more emaciated than he. So she
quit drinking ceffee and took on Postum

that Postum Food Coffee saved her.
The gentleman from Mllford speaks also
of Thomas McDonald as having recovered
by using Postum. It can be had at all

â¢ VIETVS OF PASSION PLATâ Mrs. L. A.
Calhoun will present her famous views of the
passion play of Oberammergau at Golden
Gate Hall to-morrow night. "
â¢ The talk about Senator Bard's Inclina
tion to recommend Albert Gerberding for
Postmaster of this city Is thought to be
mere conjecture. Colonel George Stone Is
not a candidate for the office. Mr. Kahn
understands that Senator Perkins Is ready
to recognize the right of Representatives
to name the Postmasters, but contends
that all the rest of the Federal patronage
belongs to the Senators.
Representative Eugene F. Loud's Fifth
District embraces, however, a consider
able area of San Francisco, but Mr. Kahn
figures that his colleague In the House haA
twenty or more good postofflce appoint
ments in Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties. Mr. Kahn does not apprehend
any objection from the Fifth District to
the recommendation in Mr. Montague's
favor.
Representative Julius Kahn of the
Fourth Congressional District has recom
â¢mended to the President the reappolnt
ment of W. "W. Montague, Postmaster of
San Francisco. Mr. Kahn maintains that
the office Is in his district and according
to established custom the patronage be
longs to the Representative in Congress
of the district, or in other words the Con
gressman has the right to name the Post
master. Of course if the Senator happens
to dwell in the city his wishes, according
to custom, must be considered. Senator
Perkins lives ln Oakland and Senator
Bard dwells in Ventura County. Hence
Julius Kahn is alone in his district glory.

The Republican Primary League was formed
for these purposes and expects thereby to re
establish the prestige of the Republican party
in this city. The originators of the movement
have pledsreil themselves bo to extend and de
velop it that all who are members of ! the
party, and who so desire, may connect
themselves with it. It is in no way ex
clusive, and is subject to the absolute control
of its members. Every movement requires in
dividuals to initiate it, and all possible ob
jections to its form may be answered by the
statement tha: its membership is open to any
citizen who Is a member of the Republican
party, and th-a majority of Its members will
rule. . . .-' ; . â¢ .
The Republican Primary League welcomes

TRIAL AGAIN : CONTINUED
By order of Captain Seymour, Â¦ H. C.
Crosby and A. H. Barton, two of the
Eastern sharpers who tried to swindle lo
cal stock* brokers by means of .worthless
mining stock, were released from custody
yesterday, as the District Attorney decid
ed that no charge could 'be ." sustained
against them. Charles Gordon, alias C. S.
Stickney., alias Rodgers, alias Fegenbush,
the leader of the gang, had a charge of
obtaining money by false /pretenses
booked against him for getting from Paul
R. Lewis, stock broker, $10 on the repre
sentation that he was his cousin from
Denver. Captain Seymour has received
no reply from Chicago as to Fegenbush,
who "jumped" his bonds there.
Stock Bunko Men Discharged.
out of the volunteer .service yesterday at
the Presidio. The men were a saving lot,
many of them receiving as much as $400
as discharge money.
The usual number of ' "grafters" sought
admission to the reservation, hoping to
get a chance at the soldiers' pay before
they had a chance to send It away. They
were prevented, however, from doing any
illegal .traffic by Provost Sergeant Davis
and a mounted patrol. Several arrests
were made by Sergeant Davis and his
men early In the day. This had the ef
fect of scaring the fakers and resulted in
the saving of many dollars to the blue
coats.
A' civilian dressed in soldiers' uniform
was caught soliciting for Pension Agent
Howe by Sergeant Davis. He will be,
turned over to . the police by Colonel
Rawles and prosecuted.
The Fortieth Infastry, which arrived on
the Pennsylvania, was landed, at the
Presidio wharf from the steamers Mc-
Dowell and Resolute yesterday forenoon.
The regiment was assigned ' quarters in
Model Camp, where it will remain until
Colonel' Jocelyn and his force of clerks
prepare its finals.

sixty newspaper men will be in the party.
The Press Club has not yet been official

editors and .the, directors have taken no
formal action in regard to entertainment
of the visitors. However, the members
of the Alabama association will be given
the freedom of the Press Club quarters,
and in addition some form of special en
tertainment will be arranged for them. A
jinks will probably be given in honor of
the visitors, and I trip to Mount Tamal

In view of the possibilities of good accru
ing to San Francisco from the good will
and free, advertising which the Southern
editors are likely to give the city and the
State, it has been suggested that the com

matter in hand and assist in extending
hospitality to the visitors, so that they
may return to Alabama feeling they were
in reality San Francisco'^ guests.
The Call has extended an invitation to
the editors to be Its- guests for an outing
on the bay on one day of their visit in

accepted on behalf of the association by
its secretary, J. Asa Rountree, editor of
the Dixie Manufacturer, of Birmingham.

In shaping and directing the affairs of
the organization the .directors -of the
league will be guided largely by the in
telligent Judgment of the men comprising
the advisory committee. Several letters
were received from well-known - citizens
who could not serve, aa advisors, but the
letters of declination commended the pur
poses of the league and pledged active
support in the good, work. Â¦
The Â¦ main purpose of the organization
is to awaken in the minds of the citizens
of San Francisco a sense, of the import
ance of the primary election. This is re
garded as the first step to the end of at
taining: Â«ood local government. The law
governing the primary election gives, the
voter assurance that his vote will be
counted in favor of the delegates voted
for. If the workingmen, business men
and taxpayers generally will go to* the
polls and vote delegates representing their
sentiments will be elected to the munici
pal nominating convention. If good citi
zens remain indifferent and apathetic the
political bosses will combine and seize
the conventions. The directors of the
Primary League reiterate the declaration
contained in the original articles that the
organization has no candidates to favor.
At a meeting of the league last evening
the following statement was indorsed: Â¦
Sets Forth. Its Objects.
' The Republican Primary League presents to
the members of the Republican party and- to
the - citizens of San Francisco generally, the
objects and necessity of Its organization.
Disunion has for some time existed in the
Republican party. here, the first and primary
cause of' which has been that the local ma
chinery of the party has at times been under
the control of selfish and corrupt men who
are Republicans only in name, who foeter every
political vice, are ignorant of every civic vlr
ture. and glory in political evil doing, using
their followers with either party as may best
subserve their selfish and corrupt ends.
Real Republicans have time and again revolt
ed against these vicious tricksters, but after a
brief interval the same men, making a busi
ness of politics, having no legitimate occu
pation and handling the venial and plastic ma
terial at their hands, have again seized control.
Tired of the struggle, many of the leaders of
the better elements of the party have joined
independent political movements as a remedy.
The vital weakness of all prior movements
for a better administration of political affairs
resulted from the fact that there was no
permanent bond of union between the reform
leaders. The corrupt and tricky bosses were
thus able to place their followers within the
lines of the reform movements, disintegrating
them, or by united effort on their own part and
apathy on the part of their opponent were able
to steal away results and party organization.
The Â» Republican Primary League has been
formed to prevent this old device of the bosses,
and to unite all Republicans in one harmonious
body. This organization is to be developed so
that all citizens desirous of promoting a move
ment of local party affairs and a good munici
pal government shall have a voice in Its con
trol. Its plan of organization is similar to
that adopted by the best social and fraternal
organizations of our city. A second reason and
necessity for the existence of the Republican
Primary League is that the enactment of the
new primary law by the last Legislature of
the State involves the development of a new
system of party machinery in which every
member may participate under every safeguard
and sanction of the law.
Many of the inauguratora of this movement
were instrumental In securing the enactment
of this important a%d beneficial legislation, â¢ as
a means to secure free and independent political
action, and the organization is pledged to it%
maintenance. ...
Old System of Control Is Dead.
Â¦ The old system of control of "the party
through the county committees system, always
under "boss control;" is now ' fortunately dead,
and the power of such committees is practical
ly destroyed. Through the agency of the pri
mary law this new organization hopes . to de
velop a system of politics which will enable a
party member to interest himself- ln 'local Â¦ af
fairs with personal security and decency and
with the knowledge that his vote will be
honestly counted. '
This movement was not inaugurated to fur
ther the interest of any man. It has no can
didates, nor will it oppose the political am
bitions of any fit man. Whatever influences
it may exert will be fairly, honestly and openly
used for the best interests of the party, our
city and its citizens.. It has no intention to
extend its sphere of action beyond the limit
of the municipality, and will not seek to in
terfere with the regular State or national or
ganizations, of the party, nor to defeat or de
stroy the political action of any individuals ln
their district organizations/but It will en
deavor to use' Its influence for the purpose of
strengthening all district organizations which
have in view the purposes and objects for
which this league is instituted. If possible,
it will adjust and end much of the strife here
tofore considered necessary in political affairs,
and its success depends, of course, largely upon
the good faith I of the originators of move
ment, and they pledge themselves openly to
further !n every honorable way the best in
terests of the party and of our municipal gov
ernment, and to secure and maintain a cleanly
party administration and a strong,' clean and
honest municipal government. Â¦
It may not be generally recalled that it was
at a Republican municipal convention that the
"dollar limit" plan of taxation originated,
which for over twenty years has been the
safeguard of municipal finance. ' In those days
gentlemen of standing did: not hesitate to con
nect themselves with the party in -municipal
affairs, and a Board of Supervisors nominated
by a Republican convention was elected which
actually conducted the local government hon
estly and . went out of office Â¦ having a surplus
of half a million dollars unexpended and carry-
Ins with it the good will and esteem of all its
fellow citizens.;
V Aims to Advance Party.
This organization frankly, states that its ob
jects are to advance the political interests of
the Republican party, and ..to assist in obtain
ing a sound and safe and honest ' municipal
administration, and that it proposes to secure
these results by the most honorable, open and
free : methods. , i ' Â¦ f
It-will belts <ttjeec.vor to enlist all Republi
cans ln a united and harmonious political or
ganization and to secure the i eympathetlc in

order, when twenty members of the Grand
Grove were initiated.. ...
The appeals of A. Aranzino against
Alpini Grove and A. Cardoza against Hes
perian Grove in relation to sick benefits
that were denied were decided in favor of

that to obtain such benefits members
must Â¦comply with the law.

The thirty-seventh annual session of
the Grand Grove, United Ancient Order
of Druids,- of California, was opened in
the Sutter-street Druids' Temple yester
day morning by Noble Grand Arch Henry
Lange of St. Helena.
There were present .fifteen grand offi
cers, ten past noble grand arches and rep
resentatives, from sixty-one groves. The
Grand Grove degree was conferred upon
more than "100 past arches who were en
titled to receive the same.
The reports of the grand officers were
presented and referred to appropriate
committees. . ' Â¦
That of the noble grand arch gives a
full and detailed account of the official
work to be performed during his term.
He reports having visited a large number
of groves in all parts of the State and
some in Oregon. He returns special thanks
to the San Francisco Call for publishing
reports of the proceedings of the Druids,
pays a compliment to the Druids' Maga
zine and thanks the press generally tor
its work in behalf of the order. He rec
ommends the establishment of past
arches' associations, similar to the one or
ganized in this city, in all parts of the
State, wherever practicable; the payment
of $10 a quarter for a nurse for Mrs. Seig.

district deputies,- Grand Secretary Graves
and Deputy Grand Arch Jules S. Godeau,
for their assistance.
The report of the grand secretary shows
eighty-six vgroves, with a total member
ship of 5931, the order having made a net
gain of 870 during the term. Eight new
groves were instituted and one suspended
during that period.
The Grand Grove granted charters to

DRUIDS MEET
FOR BUSINESS
ECONOMY should be practiced at
all times possible," said School
Director Denman to Director
Kincald, while the two were on
a visit to a Bernal Heights school
building a few days ago, their object be
ing to inspect the work of the janitor in
cleaning stovepipes in accordance with
the newly adopted rules of the Board of
Education.
Director Denman made the remark upon
spying a crayon at the foot of one of the
blackboards. He put it into his pocket
and later, with a whole boxful of various
sizes gathered in different schools visited
during the day, turned it over to the
storekeeper at the City Hall.
"Some child might find these," he re
marked as he laid down his =burden, "and
we cannot afford to waste our surplus in
this way. Chalk costs the city nearly 7
cents a box."
Every female janitor is up in arms
against the new rules. Imagine a woman
climbing the dizzy heights of a steplad
der, pulling out a section of stovepipe and
dumping the soot accidentally into the
water with which the paint is to be wash
ed. It is against this stovepipe proposi
tion that the janitresses most rebel. Some
of those who have had troubles in the
schools under their charge have seriously
thought of organizing the Janitress'
Anti-Stovepipe Cleaning Union.
Now there is another proposition in the
rules that the janitors do not clearly un
derstand. It is an order to "turn off the
water during vacation, to thoroughly
scrub and wash all the floors of the halls
and schoolrooms, to wash the painted
woodwork throughout the building and to
water lawns and flowers."
How to perform all these functions
without water, especially as the first In
junction is "to turn off the water," is one
of the most potent problems the janitors
have to solve. The matter will probably
be referred to the executive committee of
Other grievances that the janitors have
against the new rules are so numerous
that a volume might be written about
them. The interior condition of the school
buildings is sufficient to prove that as an
economical measure the amateur cleans
ing of stovepipes, walls and floors and the
sprinkling of lawns with the water turned
off is not what the projectors expected.
Every school janitor rises in loud ac
claim against the new rules, for not alone
are they deprived of their vacations but
they have to pay tinsmiths out of their
pockets to replace the stovepipes and men
to put up the wires that support the
pipes. Several janitors have been sus
pended for leaving their schools during
the hours appointed. In one case, the
j&nitress of the Bernal Heights School
left the building to attend to a sick child.
She was absent fifteen minutes and when
she returned found a portion of the board
present. She was suspended, but will
probably be restored to duty at the next
meeting. of the Directors.
Director Casserly is taking an active in
terest in the investigations. Some one has
said that he was the instigator of the
clause regarding the dusting of ceilings
and walls on account of his height and
ability for long reaching, but. this he de
nies. Nevertheless he is greatly interest
ed in the success of th& "diluted acid"
furnished by the storeroom for the re
moval of ink stains.
"I would like to know," said the female
Janitor of one of the large schools, as she
attempted to gracefully descend from a
high ladder, daubing the wall with one
hand, sooty from the section of stovepipe
she had just removed, and holding her
skirts ln the other, "how we women are
going to put these things together again?"
Then a tinsmith was called and the jan
itress paid him out of her own pocket.
An ingenious janitor at > one of the large
â¢schools which boasts a lawn thought he
had solved the problem of "turning off
fthe water" and "watering the lawns and
flowers." He purchased a new : green
sprinkling pot and, being a "good boy"
with the groceryman on the opposite cor
ner, filled the can from, the grocer's horse
trough. But when the grocer's water bill
came in the janitor was assessed nearly
half of his June salary. He takes water
no longer.
Mrs. Flora M. Holfien obtained a divorce
and a fortune from Edward S. Holden
yesterday in Judge Troutt's court. In 1897
Holflen accumulated a few hundred dol
lars and ln company with a woman other
than his wife went to Dawson City. A
few months ago Mrs. Holden filed suit
for divorce, charging Holden with infi
delity and desertion. Virgil Moore, Hol
den's partner In the Klondike venture, ar
rived in the city a few weeks aeo. He
was subpenaed as a witness on behalf of
the plaintiff.
Moore testified that Holden was living
openly and notoriously with a woman in
the Klondike. He was possessed of prop
erty valued at $200,000. He stated further
the yield from the property last year was
$104,000. Mrs. Holden corroborated Moore's
statement and Judge Troutt granted a de
cree as prayed. Under the terms of the
decree Mrs. Holden Is given judfement for
alimony in the sum of $100 a month and
one-half of the community property. Mrs.
Holden will forthwith take steps to en
force the decree and gain possession of
one-half of her former husband's interest
in the Dawson mines.
Mr. and Mrs. Holden were married Au
gust 26, 1S90, They formerly lived in Santa
Rosa. â¢
The action for divorce instituted by Jud
eon J. Traver against Laura Traver was
on hearing before Judge Troutt yester
day. Traver testified that his wife horse
whipped him on various occasions and
otherwise destroyed his happiness. The
case will be concluded to-day.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Grace H. Powell from Clay H.
Powell for desertion, James H. Kendall
from Margaret V. Kendall for cruelty,
Edward C. Beebe from Alice J. Beebe for
desertion, Agnes Binney from- Frank A.
Binney for failure to provide and Clara S.
Short from W. Short for desertion.
Suits for divorce on the ground of de
sertion were filed yesterday by Henry S.
Bojanowski against Felecia Bojanowski,
Hattie Downs against George C. Downs,
John Watrin against Helen Watrin and
Emily M. Egry against Paul Egry.
