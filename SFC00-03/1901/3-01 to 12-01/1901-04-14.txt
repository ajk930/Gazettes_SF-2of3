One of the sword's earliest escapades
was at Foit Necessity, when it made its
owner so big a name that he was com
missioned commander-in-chief of all the
Virginia forces. In Braddock's cam
paign he ranged a field on horseback
and made his sword do duty against a
fire of Indian bullets. Later the sword
retreated through the Jerseys, then
turned and neatly prodded pursuing red
coats at Trenton and Princeton. It held
Valley Forge through the terrible win
ter of '77 and '78, while the men under
Washington were suffering "and people
behind them were clamoring that he
give up. The sword crossed the Dela
ware. When it had won peace for its
country it hung, during its owner's life
time, over the fireplace in the Mouct
Vernon heme. - I
Mrs. Grace Lee Lewis Mann, niece of
Miss Lewis and mother of Betty, set out
a little while ago for Baltimore to sell
the sword. Miss Lewis has already ne
gotiated with the Metropolitan Museum
of New York, but the museum disagrees
with her in a matter of $50,060. She
Â¦wants her $100,000 for the heirloom and
their offer has not as yet gone above the
half of that price.
It certainly has accomplished about
enough for one sword already. It attend
ed to the settling of some Frenchmen
and some Indians in a very neat manner
and later on it showed the British a trick
or two. It might have earned a rest by
this time, one would think,' but no. ' It
is to bring a neat price that Baby Mann
may have what hermother calls more
"nice things" when she grows up.
At the time that she refused $50,000,
however, she would have refused $50,
000,000 just as quickly. She did not in
tend to sell it at all, for she felt that it
was one of the family and not to be
parted with for mere money. But now
there is a little Mann, the daughter of
her niece Grace â Baby Betty Washing
ton Mann she is called â and she is go
ing to grow up one of these days, and
for her the aunt is going to put her great
great-many-many-times-great uncle's
sword into service again.

When you consider, what George
Washington was to us and what his
sword was to him, it becomes apparent
that of all the heirlooms preserved in
America this is the most important. No

for it and chooses to hold out for

therefore enabled the Government to
come out many thousands of dollars
ahead. It is satd that he first got his

Some time ago in Pueblo a surgeon

NEW USES FOR SAWDUST WILL MAKE
IT A VALUABLE COMMODITY.
SCIENTIFIC men h*ve long been on-
gaged In the stuly cf methods of y
utilizing waste products, such as
sewage, garbage. and many other
things, formerly thrown away as worth-
less. After It Is ascertained just what
these materials contain that can be utll-
lzed. Ingenious men set their wits to work
to Invent machinery and devise processes
by which the valuable commodities may
be extracted. In this way many million
dollars' worth of oils, fertilizers and other
useful substances are now saved and the
world is so much the richer.
A great deal of sawdust has. always
gone to Â¦waste, though many mills have used
It to supplement their tuel supply. Chemi-
cal analysts have oeen at work on the
rawdust problem and It has been shown
clearly that it coctairB very useful ele-
ments that are worth saving and now ma-
chlnery has been Invented to extract these
materials.
The experiments navÂ«Â» proven that 1000
pounds of sawdust will yield about 160
pounds of char, which Is practically
the same as charcoal trtl equally service-
able; ISO pounds of acids. 160 pounds of tar
and a quantity of gases that have been
tested for beating an3 Illuminating and
found to be excellent for both purposes
"While the acids, tar and char are the pro
ducts particularly desired ltis^Raid the
gases are of commercial value.''
A machine has been invented In Montre
al for the purpose of distilling sawdust
and obtaining the desired products. Con
sul General Blttinger writes that the ma
chine treats about 2000 pounds of wet saw
dust an hour. As Canada manufactures
enormous quantities o*- lumber It is; ex^
pecied that the utlllzat.'on of sawdust in
that country Â¦will be an Important source
of valuable commodities.
There are twenty places In .Europe
where oxalic acid Is extracted from saw
dust. In Scotland sawdust Is used to
make floor-cloth, coarse wrapping paper,
and mill-board, which la a kind of past v
board used by book makers in the covers
of books. Thus sawdust, once thought to
be a good deal of a nuisance. Is beginning
to be considered quite a useful article.â

Another feature of no small Importance
from a rifleman's standpoint Is that this
meeting will give the. Eastern and West
ern marksmen an opportunity to compete
; f or honors and records on an equal f Got- '

Numerous committees were also formed
to attend to the details of arrangements.
After organizing, the old officers In the
East were notified and they forwarded to
the local body. all of the archives, prizes
left over, records, money, etc. The local
organization set to work with a will and
soon the roll showed nearly all of the
prominent rifle shooting clubs of Califor
nia ' as members of the bund. Take ' the
whole bund together, there are in It about
eighty rifle clubs, representing about 5500
expert marksmen. Outside of the national
organization there are several - hundred
rifle shooting clubs, the members of which
watch with the keenest interest the com
petitions at the triannual tournaments.
The Kastern: membership of the national
body is sixty-three clubs, representing 4360
marksmen. In California the bund has
about twenty clubs, representing over 1000
members.'. Â¦Â¦ In the: East: and "West these
clubs have on their membership rolls some
of the wealthiest and most influential men
of America. Over a dozen millionaires
belong to this fraternity. .
After considerable, discussion Shell
Mound range, near Berkeley, was selected
as the' place for holding the big rifle tour
nament, which will take place op July 14
to July 23 next. As soon as the contract
was signed Captain * Siebe. proprietor of
the range and park, began to tear down
*"^v IFLBMEJC from rrerr P*rt of tha
fj United States, and all kinds of rlfle
j"\ menâ those who belong to Schuetzen
\ eesellschafts, and those who belong
to mere rifle clubs, and those who
belong all the way In betweenâ all are
coming to the coast, and the goose hangs
high. For California has secured the next
national tournament of marksmen, and
it will be held at Shell Mound Range from
the 14th to the 23d of July.
Then we shall 6ee shooting. Any one
who thinks that the National Schuetzen
Bund is coming together to loaf is very
much mistaken. The loafing won't be in
dulged In until the popping Is over and
the trophies won.
It all came about in this way: In 1S93
the bund was formed In New Tork for
the purpose of promoting target rifle
shooting Success followed, and within
two years the organization had as mem
bers nearly all the first class rifle clubs
of the East and a few in the West. The
first national tournament was held In
Glendale Park. Long Island, in the sum
mer of 1895, and at that competition the
California marksmen acquitted them
selves with credit, bringing back a goodly
number of trophies.
It was like the taste pf blood to a tiger.
The trophies were what did it. Califor
nia went hot-handed into' the bund busi
ness.
She did not wait long before playing her
trump card. In 1893. only a year later, the
meet was again held in Glendale. with still
bigger success. Several thousand marks
men participated in the competitions, and
a number from Europe were present. At
the conclusion California bid for the tour
nament of 1931.
She promised the use of a good range
near San Francisco Bay. She promised
a sufficient sum cf money to provide
ample prizes and pay all expenses. She
won.
In accordance with the rules of the. or

His attitude toward militarism and all
the hydra of evils which the.'new democ
racy combats Is set' forth; at 'Its best by
a speech of Rossi in the House of Deou
tles:-- - â¢' , '. â¢ -\
'"The proposal to increase the army,"
he said, "in a time of tranquillity abroad
.but of discord at home, is the gravest^im
peachment'that 1 could be made to the gov
ernment of a country. 'Under. a right or
der of things. Parliament, would be 'tho
servant of that^'conscience. -and "rebellion
would be impossible. Â¦ But this government
is the master of the; country and is keep
ing the. people down. by violence and' op
pression: - Parliament iiÂ«i dead. For GoU'3
sake let us bury it!'. V
"Loud shouts followed this outburst,
and some of the Deoutivs rose from their
seats, and crowding around. the speaker in
the open space In front, . yelled, arid
screamed at him like' r. pack of hounds.
He stood calm,- playing with his watch
chain, while the Pres'drnt rang his bell
and called for Ellence. The interruptions
died down at last, and the speaker weat
on: ,
: ." 'It you ask me what is the reason' of
the discontent which rroduces the crimes
of anarchism. I say, first the domination
of a government which : is absolute, .' and
the want of liberty of speech and meeting.
In other countries tho discontented are
permitted to manifest their woes, and are
not punished unless they commit deeds
of violence; but in Italy alone, except Rus
sia, a man may be placed outside {Â¦ the
law, torn from his'iiome. from his wife

to Domicilio Ccatto - (compulsory |3 domi

I may ; conclude with one,..last.'quota
tion, .which, is the most" representative of
'all: "'What is democracy?' asks David
Rossi, the hero of the stcry.t 'Democracy
"Is the breaking down of the barriers thf;t

rate, John Habberton is a very clever
juvenile writer and his latest book de-,

He calls it "Poor Boys' Chances" and in

generation should not be discouraged be
cause there may not seem to be the same

way in . the world as there was in the
years when his forbears had their careers
before them. He shows that "it, is true
that a fewâ a very f ev.% of the old-time
chances are gone, but ft is also true that
for every one that has disappeared there
are a hundred new ones.".

' * r . fornla.
' A book that undoubtedly deserves , a
place in the library of every lawyer in
California is a publication from a Los
Angeles : publishing-house,' "History of
the Bench and Bar of California." The
work was originally the idea of Hon. M.
M. Miller of the/ San Francisco bar: but
Mr. Miller; after, gathering much mate
rial, ,was obliged to abandon' the project
owing to alluring inducements held -out
to him to settle inHonolulu and take part
in the transformation of the Hawaiian
Islands into a portion of the American
Union. - Thereupon the task was taken up
by Mr. Oscar T. Shuck, the author of
many -meritorious-..: works on similar
lines
The volume, as it is now offered to the
public, is a large one of over 1000 pages,
and covers fully the Judicial history, of
the State. In brief, it sets forth in j de
tail accounts of important legislation and
extraordinary, cases,' and. also offers the
reader , a store of humorous : and pathetic
recollections from the pens of . eminent
men, who write from their own personal
recollections. In addition' are .given- the
biographies of many remarkable men. : â¢
The articles, which, taken, as a whole,
give the complete history of ,the bench
and bar, , are written . by men who have
made special studies of the topics where
on they write. For example: '; The open

Political Economy of Humanism. ;
"The ; Political Economy of. Humanism,"
by. Henry. Wood,' is a practical and Inter
esting work. ; It is made up to a great ex
tent from matter revl3ed' to date; which
has 'passed -through four editions:, under
the .'title of Â¦: "The - Political ; Economy .of

new chapters, upon "vital topics have 'bet- n
added. The new title also more , properly
bo. Although the ecere Is set In Rome, j
and the chief characters are Romans, the
motive of the story is neither peculiarly
Roman nor Italian. Its interest is wider
than that being concerned with a motive
of universal" application. Kit -"Is a world
theme wrought out in Rome.' â¢ , :
It will naturally be asked, why, then,
is Rome chosen as the central scene? The
answer is, because Rome Is to the author
in some respects the capital of the world;
: this by reason of its historical and ' re
ligious interest, the mystery of eternal
life that, clings to it, the charm of its ar
tistic associations, and above all, the
value, of Its "geographical position in rela
tion : to the great line of commercial ac
tivity in the world.
Rome stands . to . the author as it stood
to Mazzlnl, as the future Pantheon of Hu
manity, .the court ami the congress- o"
man. In his dream of the future he seeu
Rome as the center to which all the na
tions will come for lae . settlement of in
ternational disputes, as well, perhaps, as
tellectual order and Justice Jn the social
_order, - had joined Â¦ company with . it."
"(On Byron.)
The new, robust and almost full-blooded
democracy of this age has discarded truth
and even freedom as Insufficient Ideals
without that of bread In abundance, and
Mr. Hall Calne has uttered Its word In a
piquant story, which Is embodied In "The
Eternal City." . ,
" 'Yet you thought you had got the
mlllenlum when you got the'. statute,' sale 1
a voice from the crowd.
"'So we did. sonny, but *we were liko
the Dutchman's dog: 'Schneider/ said the
Dutchman, 'you are free,' 'But where
can I go?" said Schneider. 'You are free,'
said the Dutchman. 'But what can I
eatr 'You are free, I tell you.' Next day
Schneider was found dead In n ditch. 'He
can't blame me. I gave him his liberty,
didn't I r said the Dutchman '
" Tou ought to be ashamed of yourself
talking like that of your King and coun
try!' said another choking voice in tne
crowd. "
Mr. Hall Caine is evidently with the
people.
This' is how the condition of the poor
in the Roman Campagna Is -described:
"Housed In huts of straw, sleeping on
mattresses of leaves, clothed In rags or
nearly nude, fed on maize and chestnuts
and acorns, worked eighteen hours a day
and sweated by the tyranny, of the over
seers to whom landlords leave their lands
while they idle their days in the salons cf
Rome and Paris, men and women and
children are treated worse than slaves
and beaten more than dogs."
. And "You take these statements light
lyâyou that don't know what it is to be
hungry, you that have food enough to
eat, and only want sleep to digest it. But
1 know these things by bitter knowledgeâ
by experience. Don't talk to me, you who
had your fathers and mothers to care for
you and your comfortable homes. to llvo
In. I had none of these things. I was
nursed in a workhouse and brought up in
a hut in the Campagna. Because of the
miserable laws of your predecessors my
mother drowned herself In the Tiber and
I knew what it was to starve. And I am
only one of many. At the very door of
Rome, under a Christian Government, tho
poor are living lives of moral anaemia and
physical atrophy more terrible -by far
than those which made the pagan poet
say two thousand years ago, 'Bands vivlt
humanum genus (the human race exists
for the benefit of the few).* "
And Mr. Hall Caine is not less sincerely
than evidently with the people, for when
he describe* his hero, whose utterance I
have Just quoted, he seerns almost to im
personate him, and the utterances of the
one In character are often informal ut
terances of the other.
It is dlrBcult to enumerate the bearings
of this pocial and political evangel.
Among the salient features of a story
with such a motive is, of course, its atti
tude toward the great facts of the modern
world. One of these great facts , is th>>
militarism of the present time. The story
It intended to be strongly opposed to the
spirit of militarism. It regards warfare
as a barbarous and brutal method of set
tling national disputes, and strongly In
dicates, a belief that the lawr of nature
are fast rendering it impracticable and
impossible, this both on its economic and
Its scientific sides, not to speak of its
moral and spiiitual aspects.
Another feature of the atory. deals' with
the soil of the x earth. The teaching 'of the
story is that trie land belongs to the whole
human family and that it is wrong aud
wicked of any class to take possession of
it to the exclusion of the rest. Here again
the laws of nature arc made the ground
for the. belief that the land will- return
into the possession of humanity.
Once more the attitude of the story, to
ward capital may be characterized in an
identical manner. The trend of the teach
ing manifestly is that great trusts and
syndicates are Injurious to the interests
of the human family and that the laws
of nature are once more operating to put
an end to them by submerging them into
the possession of the natiQn, and finally
of the race.
Lastly, and above all, it will be asked
whac is the relation of the story to re
ligion? Here the Intention is to take
Christianity as a basis of faith, and par
ticularly the teaching of the words of
Christ as the foundation of belief, ths
Lord's prayer being more especially used
as the basis of a political charter, the
idea of the author being that Christ Is
law-giver for the nation as well as for
the individual.
The attitude toward the "churches, or*
rather to-o-ard the churfch, is perhaps
more difficult to state, though it is clear
and decisive. The author shows the deep
est respect for the Catholic church as a,
divine institution, fiut it must be at once \
said that he is an unyielding opponent to
the t emporal claims of the papacy. His Â¦
attitude in this regard is very emphatical
ly stated in several placesâ the view being
that a Pope can be a temporal sovereign
only on the basis of absolutism, and that
any divided political authority would be
contrary to the fundamental idea of the
papacy. As' this temporal absolutism
comes into collision with tne political doc
trines on which the story is founded, the
author is at war with it... Of course, it
may be said, as he would say, that he is
an adversary of the body of the church
rather than to its soul.
In a word, the fundamental religious
and political idea at the root of the story
Is the sovereignty, of the people. . This
rinds very strong- expression . again and
again, and it is even accompanied by the
necessary deduction that if the people are
the true sovereigns in every country of
the world, there can be no rebellion ex
cepi rebellion -against the people; there
fore, that all ruling classes that are not
the servants of the people are reuEis to
the people, whatever uniform thejr wear.
"It is." says one of the speakers In the
story-^'because the votes of the peo

The theories are indeed there, but ' they

by mere reflect, as in the story of the dog

Roman life. This, however, is really not

Indeed, Mr. Hall Calne Is, In this novel,
the mirror of his as* as Well as its high

Let me illustrate this difference by com
paring the democratic movement which
proceeded. Kay from 1800 to 1870. as â¢de
scribed by Mr. .Morley. with the demo
cratic movement which is now in pro
gress. The former was largely Ideal, the
latter is not to be contented with formu
las without bread. "Of what manner is
this spirit?" asks the first-named writer
about the revolution of a generation ago.
"Is it not a masterful and Impatient
yearning after many good things, unsub
dued and uninformed either by a Just
knowledge of the time, and the times
which are needed to bring to men the
fruits cf their hope, or by a fit apprecia
tion of orderly and tranquil activity for
the puhMc service, as the normal type of
the individual life? â¢ â¢ â¢ (a) colossal
figure, which has haunted Europe these
four-sccre years and more, with Its new
born passion, its )-Â»lf -controlled will, its
constant cry for multitude of unknown
blessings under the single name of Free

word of blessing. If only truth, which
aione cf words is essentially divine and
sacrosanct, had been the chief talisma.i
of the revolution the movement would
have been very different from that which
we know. But to claim this or that in the
name of trutrf would have been to borrow

â¢with hateful associations. Freedom, after

The great poet of to-day would be a
world poet. The great novelist is a world
novelist The word of Hall Caine with re
gard to his present story sets the neces
sary proof upon this; in It he speaks of
the world, and not of Italy aryi of Rome
as the world's lieartâ not as the capital of
a respectable kingdom." In order to Justify
and explain the title of my story I would
eay that it seems to me almost certain
that in the great future, which' Is to wit
ness the breakdown of so many barriers
dividing man from man and man from
God. and In the new methods of settling
Internal end international disputes, which
will take the place of the brutal and bar
barous conflicts of war, as well as the
cruel and fratricidal struggles of trade,
the old mother city of the pagan and the
Christian worlds will have her rightful
rank. Her geographical position, her re
ligious and historical Interest, her artistic
charm and, above all. the mystery of eter
nal life which attaches to her, seem to me
to point to Rcme as the seat of the great
court of appeal in the congress of human
ity which >Cae surely as the sun will rise
to-morrow) the future Â¦will see estab
lished."
In truth, the novelist of the day sup
plants the poer. Just as the poet of old
supplanted the prophet and the seer.
Not to delay the reader with apologies
for the length of the ' quotation, I may
point out some of the strains of sugges
tiveness running through these passages
vriien read In connection with Hall Caine's
current story, "The Eternal City." This I
wish to study here while it is running in
Collier's Weekly in the UiJted States and
In the Lady's Magazine in England. Just
as at least one Italian critic has dohe In
regard to the "Piccolo Mondo Moderno"
of Fogazzaro, which Is running In La
Nuova Anlologia. but in doing so I wish
to dissociate the author In the most posi
tive and In the most complete way from
any of the many responsibilities which
may directly or indirectly spring up or
which may be engrafted upon what is
â¢written or quoted. This writer has al
ready said to the American public that
"so far as it concerns the primary sugges
tions on which I have begun to work.
â¢ â¢ â¢ I find myself once more indebted
to the book of books for the foundation
of my theme. The story -of 'The Eternal
City* Is, both on its human side and on
the side of its intellectual intention, the
stcry of Samson and his lifelong struggle
with the lords of the Philistines." This,
to one who remembers the "Samson Ago
niEtes." is merely a proof case among
others creating an identity of interpreta
tion between the two English poets in the
aspects Just described and the modern
â¢writer, and setting the stamp of the same
English positivism of social and political
treatment upon the works of the latter
and those of the former. And the marks
of identity are deepened into characteris
tics v.-hen they apply In the double case
of biblical themes ct classic themes, and
of a social and political handling of these
EUbJects.
"In Shakespeare the dramatic form helps
partly to make this more prominent,
though the poet's spirit shines forth thus
independently of the mold which imposes
itself. Of Milton we may gay, too, that In
ppite of the supernatural machinery of his
greatest poem. It bears strongly Impressed
on it the political mark, and that in those
minor pieces, where he is avowedly In the
political sphere, he etill rises to the full
height of his majestic harmony and no
blest dignity." (Miscellanies, L pp. 210
213.)
"To this band of sacred bards few are
called, while perhaps not more than four
high names would fill the list of the
chosenâ Dante, the poet of Catholicism;
Shakespeare, of feudalism; Milton, of Pro
testantism; Goethe, of that new faith
which Is as yet without any universally
recognized labeL The far-ehlnlng pre-em
inence of Shakespeare, apart from the In
comparable fertility and depth of his nat
ural gifts, arises secondarily from, the
larger extent to which he transcended the
special forming Influences, and refreshed
his fancy and widened his range of sym
pathy by recourse to what was then the
nearest possible approach to a historic or
political method. â¢ â¢ â¢ While in Dante the
Inspiring lorce was spiritual and In Goethe
It was Intellectual, we may say that both
in Shakespeare and Milton It was political
and social. In other words, the drama of
the one and the epic of the other were
each of them connected with Ideas of gov
ernment and the other external move
ments of men In society, and with the
play of the sentiments which spring from
them. We assuredly do not mean that in
either of them, least of all in Shakes
peare, there is an- absence of the spiritual
element. This would be at once to thrust
them down Into a lower place, for the
spiritual is th<? very essence of poetry.
But with the spiritual there mixes in our
Englishmen' a most abundant leaven of
recognition of the impressions and Im
pulses of the outer forms of life, as well
as of active sympathy with the every
day debate of the world.
"They are neither of them Inferior to the
highest In the sense of the wide and un
alterable things of the spirit, yet with
both of them, more than with other
poets of the same rank, the man with
Â¦whose soul and circumstance they have to
deal is the Politicon zoon, no high ab
straction cf the race, but the creature
with concrete relations and a full objec
tive life.

of the non-professional. He designs to.
give "something about the beginnings
and the course of development of chorua

choirs, their constitution and the nature
of their activity, at different periods;
something about the history of the most
Important choral forms, Â¦ particularly tin
Mystery and the Oratorio, â¢ about their
essential characteristics and about thj

Mr. Mees devotes an interesting chapter
to a review of the conditions which led up
to the organization of singing societies in
this country, and of the circumstances
under which the choral institutions that
were conspicuously instrumental in elo
vating the standard of chorus singing
were established.
. In the last chapter he dwell on the qual

elastic step In that direction. She moved
with a peculiar grace of action ; she . was
tall and her frame, though Blight, was
firmly knit and instinct with vitality and
health. Her hair was of a deep bronze
color, very uncommon, that could look al
most black in shadow and light up to a
ruddy gold when the sun shone upon it.
It was full of Irrepressible waves anl
tendrils and, however she dressed it, it
always formed a sort of halo round her
face, a halo of little tender curls that re
sisted damp and heat alike and softened,
the countenance they encircled In a char
acteristic and bewitching way. The face
itself was rather ; square in outline, tho
brow being full and wide, the eyes' set
rather far apart, a dark penciled gray in
color, and the molding of the chin and
Jaw being very firm. But the mouth was
full and gracious in its curves, and- the
nose was short and straight, and, like all
the other features, delicately cut. It was
a strong face, but a very charming one
withal, and the damask rose color that
mantled the cheek was like the bloom of
a ripe peach. Daphne was dressed all in
white this hot summer's evening; indeed,
white was her favorite wtÂ«.r for manv
months of the year. A tall," slim deer-,
hound waited on her steps ad she moved
through the woodland track, and at a
word from his mistress he sped on ahead
and soon gave utterance to a short, sharp
bark, which instantly apprised Daphno
that he had had a find of some sort wr
another.
The next minute, guided by the sound,
â¢the was standing beneath one of the tot
tering walls of the old ruin, bending with
a look of deep concern over a prostrate
figureâ the figure of a man, gray-headed
and ghastly, with a drawn, colorless face
and half open eyes; who lay helpless ani
motionless upon his back, his foot held
as In a. vise beneath a mass of great
stone3 which looked as though they mig;-.l
have crushed it past recovery. "
He was almost, if not quite, unconscious,
and Daphne almost feared he might â¢ be
"No. but Sybil shall come soon If you
want her." answered Daphne In full, clear
tones. "Now, drink a little more; and
then I must leave you for a few minutes.
But I will soon come back, and then we
shall get help and can get you carried to
my pony phaeton, for you must not stay
here any longer." \
It was rather a terrible hour which fol
lowed, for when the men came and lifted
off the stones the foot beneath was seen
to be terribly crushed, and the suffering
was very" great In spite of all that could
be done to relieve and mitigate it. And
long before Daphne reached homo fi the
stranger lay In a dead faint upon the
cushions and rugs and . pillows that had
been collected to make a sort of ambu
lance for him. A rumor of disaster seemed
to have gone before her, for as the young
chatelaine drove up to the door of her
beautiful and stately home there were
servants j of both sexes standing about,
and an old lady with silver hair % and a
pale, anxious . face came fluttering down
the steps to meet her.
"Oh, my dearest Daphne, what has hap
pened?" " .,
."Nothing to me, auntie, dear, do not'be
so frightened; but tf gentleman who came
to the ruins to collect specimens of some
of the rare saxifrages that grow on ; the

himâ he looks terrible. ' "We must get him
to bed as quickly as possible. Oh, here
comes Mr. Margerison driving up! % How
glad I am that somebody had the sense. to
sehd to him. Indeed, he cannot be taken
farther. I was terribly ' afraid he might
die before I got him here."--

of the situation. . It was very plain' that

so this must be the man." -
"Dear me, what a singular coincidence;
well, poor. man, if he has to stay here'
awhile, it is pleasant to know something
about him. But how very, much older hs
must be than Sybil. She was a mere child
last year.".
; ."She is older than she looks. She told
me "she was three and twenty then; but
had been kept out of the way till her sis
ters had married off.- I am afraid Mrs.
Plunkett is Just, a regular matchmaker.
I did not like her; and I was sorry for
poor little Sybil; but I think she has done
well for herself. Poor Sir Oliver has a
Bice face, I think, and no doubt he will
look younger when he is not in such ter
rible pain as he was when I found him."
.VPoor man. 7 Mr. Margerison says the

But I suppose he will be able later on to
move into some hotel : or house of 'his

\'Oh, no doubt; but he must remain here
for awhile, till things are in good trim;
and I mean to make great friends with
him. It is bo comfortable his 'being a
middle-aged man, and engaged, to a girt
one knows. I shall talk to him about
Sybil, and ask if he would like, her asked

bo I must wait even, to tell her till I can
talk to him; but perhaps it will be better
to wait till he' Is rather better before

It was, however, several days : before
Daphne could have any kind of talk with
Sir Oliver. ; For } he ;,was : In , a high I fever

His fact did not light up as she had

"You think she would be shocked? But
Indeed I feel as though she would so much

"I scarcely think so," he' answered very
quietly. "Sybil is not fond of sickness and

the kindest thing would be to say nothing

bold a pen; but I think I shall not say a
word about my accident. I would not
spoil her pleasure for the world, and she
does enjoy her London season very
much." .1 .
"He Is a very unselfish man," said
Daphne later on to her aunt. "I hope Sybil
appreciates him.' Perhaps with her vola
tile nature a man of! that caliber would
exercise a greater hold . and fascination
over her than any one more like herself.
I hope it may -be so." ;,
-; Sir Oliver had a fine constitution, and In
spite cf~ the, serious nature of the Injury
sustained,' and the I subsequent attack of
fever,; he regained his strength; quickly
and was able after a short time to be
lifted carefully upon a wheeled couch
and taken through the open ; windows to
a fine â¢ s paved terrace, .where , peacocks
flaunted their Jeweled tails and' quaintly
cut yew trees threw patches ; of shadow
and the ' scents and sounds ' of the gar
den floated up to him as he lay, and the
summer, seemed charged with messages of
hope and promises of happiness.
-.-Daphne came and went like the fairy
princess of the place. She was the queen
of this wide domain and at once Sir Oliver
fell beneath the sway of her scepter. She
quickly discovered his tastes: every day
she had some fresh treasure from orchard
or. greenhouse, from Alpine garden or bog
garden to ' bring â¢ him ; the wonderful lib
rary was i at Â¦ his disposal, with 1 Its , treas
ures of ancient. tomes; on plants and ani
mal ? life,' as jWell as { many ' of .the ; most
modern' works on the ' subject." i There was
a' collection of f ossils," too, which Daphne
Â¦ v :.:. Â¦Â¦':".Â¦ '" >. .:Â¦' : .-Sw^V
sorts of specimens to ask his opinion
, upon, for . she was an Immense observer
and lover of ' nattfre though she had no
great stores of learning to draw upon.
His mind was like a mine of information
to her, though he -sometimes pulled him
self . ud short in the midst of some in
tricate demonstration, to make sure he
was not wearying her.
"I am afraid I shall grow Into a fearful
old bore," he would say laughingly, "but
If people take a man on his weak side how
is he to defend himself?"
And once, with a humorous twinkle in
his eye, he told her: "My dear old father
was as keen as I am over these mines. I
suppose I have inherited the taste with
his collections. A young fellow came to
L.m once, wanting a little superficial in
formationâJust for some short, ephemeral
article he was 'writingâ and my father,
.who sever understood skimming of super
ficial matter, gave him a dissertation last
ing hours and kept him examining speci
mens and taking notes for a whole long
evening. I i heard from a mutual friend
that he said afterward: 'Old Mowbray
may know his subject, but he is a caution
of a fellow to tackle. You ask him for an
inch, and he gives you aâ hell!' "
: "What . a very naughty ! young man I"
said Daphne, laughing.
"Yes, but there's a grain of truth in it,
you know," was Sir Oliver's , smiling re
ply. "I often catch myself up, remember
ing that trenchant saying: 'When one
mounts one's hobby horse it has a knack
of; bolting with one before one Is
aware.' ".'â¢.-.
,' "I think I like a bolting horse," an
swered Daphne. "I know that I do like
enthusiasm. . Life would be nothing with
out it!" 'Â¦"Â¦"'
His interest In her life and its varied
occupations was as . keen as hers in his
hobby. As the mistress of a large prop
erty, and a not very large Income, Daphne
had many perplexities to face and dlfil
cultles to overcome. She was anxious to
be both Just and liberal; to be kindly,
wise and prudent; and it was not always
.easy to know how to comnine all these
â¢qualities. She found that Sir Oliver had
been very similar â¢ experiences
and could give her excellent advice. She
came to have a. great faith in his opin
ion, and every day she found herself con
fiding In 'him more arid more,* and some
times caught herself wondering what she
should do when he left, 'though, to be
"James, did you hear a call just then?"
"Please, ma'am, I don't think It were

trepidation. "It might have been an owl;
and they do say as folks hears and sees
queer things in the ruins at night, and I
think we'd better be getting on. It's rath

Daphne smiled and pulled up the ponies
"Jump down, James, to their heads. I
am going to see; but I won't be long gone.
Perhaps it was only an owL"
The boy, thankful not to be sent him

with,alacrity, while Daphne sprang out of
Daphne Rutherford was driving home
ward along this rather unfrequented road
because she had been paying a visit to a
eick woman who lived right in the heart
of the wood. The track, which was soft
and sandy and could not be quickly
traversed, led past the beautiful old ruins
of the ancient priory, and Daphne, who
knew and loved every stock and stone of
the ancient pile, turned her face smilingly
toward it and wondered whether she had
time Just to run across and prowl about
there for ten minutes.
Suddenly something like a muffled cry
seemed to break the stillness of the wood.
It was faint and uncertain, but It sounded
like a human voice, and Daphne turned
her head quickly toward the little groom
boy who was perched up In the small seat
behind.
"After all, I am getting to be a regular
old fogy myself. Well, well, I will go
away for this fortnight and make my col
lection of specimens. Perhaps Sybil will
find that she misses me a littls after all
and will have a welcome for me when I
get back. But I will not trouble her with
letters, since she seemed not to care about
hearing from me. I ehall take my young
madam at her word for once. I don't
want to be hard upon this child, but there
is such a thing as making things too easy.
Perhaps when I come back again she will
be In a better frame of mind."
Sir Oliver was not a very young man-
Indeed, he was approaching fortyâ an'"
though still very handsome and finely sÂ«.i
up he did not look any younger Than his
years, for his hair had turned very gray,
though eyebrows and mustache were as
dark as ever, and his face was rather
deeply tanned with tropic suns and ex
posure to weather in many extremes of
climate. As he looked at his face through
his mirror that night he heaved a little
â¢1th. - Â¦Â¦^,-.
Sir Oliver was very patient, but "he left
the house at last with a grave face and a
tense of disappointment- Sybil had beer
distinctly cross and unreasonable and
had spoken words which Jarred upon his
finer sensibilities and did much to brush
the bloom off his lover-like tenderness of
mood. For the first time, in spite of sun
dry previous misgivings, he began seri
ously to ask himself whether this engage
ment had not been a mistake. It was a
rather terrible doubt, for. as a man of
honor and of very chivalrous sentiments,
he would never break the chain himself:
and he knew very well that a baronet,
even of only moderate means, was a big
ger fish than was likely to come In Sybil's
way again, and that her family would
never let her entertain any real misgiv
ings even If such suggested themselves to
her.
"That was before you were engaged,'
pouted Svbil. "Of course, I thought yot
Â¦would change your tastes and habits
after that."

Sybil shrugged up her shoulders and
pouted, looking like a preUy spoilt child
the while; but her lover. Quietly regard
ing her. began to feel that he would llkÂ«
to see more womanliness and less child
lshncss in the girl he had wooed for his
wife.
"But, Sybil, I always told you I was not
a society man; and you answered that
you hated society men, and loved me the
better for It."
"Oh, that was all very well In "Wales,
â¢where there was nothing else to do; but
In London It's different:. I like to go
everywhere, and you ought to show up
and meet me; but you are always bur
rowing in Bluffy museums, or gettini;
among a lot of dull old fogies. I call it
too bad!"
"You used to tell me that you hated id!o
men, and that it was so delightful to find
one who had Interests and hobbies. Don't
you remember how vou would come

Sir Oliver smiled paiicntly and Indiil
gently, trying hard to etifle ths half
formed thought that perhaps there waÂ«
some grain of truth in this accusation.
She had seemed such a. delightful, dainty,
charming child when he met her first, and
he had fancied her not happy In her sur
roundings, while she had seemed to be so
bright and Â«.Â»ntent with him. Everything
had been cou!eur da rose in those delight
ful spring days in Wales; but somehow,
now that they were In London, and
his visits were more formal in character
and less frequent and Ireo. a shadow
eeemed to have drifted uetween them. HÂ«
could not say exactly what it was, nor
even that she had changed toward him,
but the charm which iiad aurrounded nor
at the first seemed b!t by bit to be slip

finding her little petulant and willful
moods attractive and fascinating they
rather irked him and displeased him; and

had pounced upon it and emptied it. Then,
hurrying to the old priory well, which was
always full of clear, sweet water, she
hastily washed out all the earth and sand
and filling it with water hastened back.
After dashing tome over his face she lift
ed his head upon her arm and tried to
pour some between his parched and pallid
lips. A few minutes later she was reward
ed by seeing his eyes open and fix them
selves dizzily upon her.
"Is that you, Sybil?" he asked, speaking
very faintly. . <

In after years there came days some
times when Daphne â young Lady . Mow
brayâwould look with a kind of comical
des~~'r round her hall, littered up with
the spoil of a morning's . ramble, and
would shake a finger at her husband and
stalwart little sons, declaring with a sigh
of much despair.
There was deep silence between them
for a moment, and then Daphne stretched
out her hand and placed it between both
of bis.
I am free. I am free to sek the love
of the one woman whom I love. Daphne.
I do not ask anything of you yet; but I
cannot remain longer here without tell
ing you that I love youâ I love you!"
"I was then' in a great strait, but help
came as It so often does, thank God. â¢
when the burden seems too much to bear.
News came of Sybil's approaching mar
riage. It was like tho breaking of the
captive's chain. Now she Is married, and
Daphne's face was downbent, tho blood
was rushing into it in great pulsating
waves; her heart beat almost to suffoca
tion; she neither spoke nor moved.
Daphne subsided into her accustomed
Beat beneath the great lime treÂ« where his
couch was generally placed at this hour.
She felt herself quivering through and
through.
"May I tell you a little about it?" hÂ«
asked very gently. "I should like you to
know how it happened. I mit her in a
big hotel. I was staying there to botanize*
and she liked to come and watch me.
She was an excellent climber, and I
thought she was Interested in my pur
suits. She seemed to be almost a little
girl at first; but afterward I found she
was older than she looked. She told ma
a great deal about herself. I saw she was
not happy. I thought she was misunder
stood and was leading a cramped and
uncongenial . society life, doomed Just to
make a grand marriage to satisfy the
ambition of her | mother. I don't fhtTitt;
she meant to deceive me; but she is a
creature of moods, and the mood changes.
X thought It would be a sweet thing to
make her happy; and there was only ono
way of doing It. She accepted me at once,
and I am sure â¢ she liked me. No doubt
we both mistook, liking for love. But
when we reached London things chanced,
and like a chameleon, she changed with,
her surroundings. I do not blame her.
I was not very happy; but I never
dreamed that I might be doing her any
wrong in going through with It. . That
fear only came upon me later, when I
began to realize not only that I did not
love Sybil with that love which a man
should give to hi3 wife, but my heart
had goneâ I knew not howâ out of my
own keeping; and that I lovedâ some ona
else.".
Daphne suddenly dropped the paper and
faced him; she was pale and her voice
shook a little In spite of all her efforts.
"Are you acting a part, or can you
really feel like that about It? Oh, do tell
me that it has not spoiled your life!"
He looked her full In the face as he
answered very gravely: â¢
! "I can say with truth that I am deeply
thankful that Syhll saw our mistake for
herself and cut the knot In her own way.
I had begun to find it out even before I
left her last. It is not for me to cast a
stone at her. We may both be thankful
that we learned the truth in time."
"And I have not given her a wedding
present yet," he added. "I must ask you
to help me In the choice. I see from the
papers that they spend a fortnight In the
Isle Of Wight at a friend's house before
going to America. And Sybil must for
give mÂ© for being behind times. I won
der if she Is too rich now to care for the
things she used to love. I hope she will
not get blase too soon, with all the luxury
In which she will live."
"ComÂ» and see Sybil in her wedding
finery I" he ttclalmed as he held up one
of the society papers which gave full
length portraits of various elegant brides.
"It is not very much like her, but no
doubt does full Justice to her very exten
sive toilette. I have no doubt the little
girl was immensely delighted. I hope and
trust her married life will be as happy."
He spoke without the faintest touch of
bitterness or self repression, much in such
a tone as a brother might speak of a fair
young sister. Daphne took the paper and
looked, but It shook in her hands. She
bent over it that he might not see her
face. , ;
"Perhaps, dear Daphne, those very
-words enow how little she has ever known
him. But nothing can excuse such. haste
and bad faith." ' H : i?.\
"And somebody' must tell him,- said
Daphne distressfully, "or he will see It
himself in the papers in the course of a.
few days." â¢"Â¦>""'.'"'â¢.Â¦'
The elder Miss Rutherford took that
task upon her own shoulders, and Daphne
kept out of the way of her guest for a
few days. She had a long promised visit
in the neighborhood to pay and she took
this opportunity of going, and was three
nights absent.
When she came back It was to find Sir
Oliver promoted to Join their party at
xr.eals, and though he could not yet put
his foot to the ground, he was suffering
very little with it and was able to enjoy be
ing wheeled about the grounds in a donkey
chair. Daphne'a first thought on seeing
him was that he looked much younger
than she had thought him at first. There.
was a brightness in his eye and a. buoy
ancy about his whole aspect that struck
her with surprise and pleasure. He met
her with all the frank pleasure of an old
friend, and beneath there was something
in his manner which she felt to be new
to it, and which sent quick thrills through
all her pulses, yet she^knew not why.
Sybil's marriage was duly announced
two days later, and there was a packet of
papers for Sir Oliver the next morning,
and when she Joined him in the garden
later on, she found him surrounded -by
them all, reading them, with a. smile of
amused interest.
Daphne, however, never lost sight of her
Intention to invite Sybil, though she post
poned doing so more than once on ac
"count of the tediousness of the Injured
ankle to recover. Sir Oliver had much
to suffer from his crushed foot, and was
sometimes prostrated for several days
with pain and exhaustion: and Daphne
had an instinct that it would be no kind
ness to the lovers to bring them together
till the outlook was brighter in .this re
spect.
But a dar came at last, when the Im
provement, fairly begun, had been main
tained so steadily that she was no longer
afraid of a retaose. and sent off her let
ter written with loving care and pains,
and the answer was eagerly waited for.
Sir Oliver was told nothing, that it might
come upon him as a surprise.
Daphne opened the reply rather eagerly
when it arrived and ran her eyes quickly .
down the page. As she did so her face
changed and she grew very pale, uttering
an exclamation of dismay.
"Oh. auntie, what do you think? That
dreadful little flirt is going to be married
next week to an American with an im
mense fortune: and she has never taken
the trouble to break It off with Sir Oliver,
because she says she did not know his
address. She coolly suggests that I shall
tell him the news, and this is the way she
ends up: 'If you could find him a new
foesil or specimen, that will Quite con
sole him. He does not really care for any
thing or anybody but his stupid hobbles.
Would you believe that anybody really
knowing Sir , Oliver would writ* such
words?"
Bure, she could write to him. for they
were now real established friends, and
such they would remain. Â¦ *;\
brought him one by one, and often ho
spent a perfectly happy morning examin
ing one stone or one plant and reading all
he could from the accompanying books.
- "A man with a hobby is a perfect treas
ure!" Daphne exclaimed laughingly to
her aunt one day. , "Did you ever know
any one more absolutely easy to enter-
tain, more perfectly content under trying
circumstances? I have never heard so
much a3 a sigh or a grumble, though Mr.
Margerison says he must suffer a great
deal of pain from that abscess In the
joint. He Is only afraid of trespassing on
cur hospitality, and now he really knows
that we like to have him, he has not an
other, trouble in the -world."
"He Is a very cultivated man, and I like
him very much," said the elder Miss
Rutherford 'gently. "I do not know
whether he is right in keeping Sybil in
Ignorance of his condition, but I suppose
lovers must settle their own affairs with
out .interference. I am sure ha Only
wants to spare her pain."
"Yes, and I begin to think I understand
what he means about Sybil. She is a
sweet little butterfly; but she Is a butter
fly, and she likes it always to be sun
shine about her. Still, when Sir Oliver la
a little better, I am not sure that I shall
not plan a surprise, and ask her down to
'meet him. I believe he' would really be
delighted, though he is so afraid of spoil
ing her London season."
The ladies of the Manor became very In
timate with their guest as the summer
days flew by. Daphne brought him all
ready In the west wing, and on the ground
floor,' to save' the transit of the stairs,
and thither the stranger was transported
still in an unconscious condition.

SIR OLIVER'S HOBBY"THE "ALLEN'S CAREER TOLD IN BRIEF.
So Says Captain Chapman, Commanding the
Tenderloin Police Precinct of New Yorlz.
THE title "wickedest man in America," has been applied to
"The" Allen for a quarter of a century. Sis defiant and out
spoken attitude against, the. police originally won him the so
briquet. For fifty years at every step in his career hs-has fought
- the police bitterly and thus centered attention on himself.
He has been arrested some asventy times, but I understand
has never been convicted. I have raided the alleged poolroom at
80. Sixth avenue, .which, it is said he operates, tea or twelve times
Â¦ â oftener, X suppose, than any- police captain In JTtsvr York â but on
each occasion the charge against him has not held.
I have had men stationed in the West End dub house for
' weeks at a time to secure evidence, but so cleverly -was business
conducted that conviction was i mpossible. So far as the law is
concerned no man has yet been able, to say that "The" Allen ever
operated a poolroom. Ha has taken the advice of clever attorneys,
- ; has followed it absolutely and has won all his legal battles. In the
West End Club, referred to always" as "The" Allen's poolroom,
.only actual members are permitted, and this is another safeguard
against prosecution. Legal technicalities have always saved him.
"The" Allen is a remarkable man. He is absolutely fearless.
1 If he knew that a squad of police, were about to descend on him,
and if lie could easily avoid them,' he would stand his ground and
: make a fight. In a mix-up he's a whirlwind. He weighs about
130 pounds, but tVe common remark in his precinct is that 4 *The"
Allen is worth ten men. n . * '

The Longest Steps
on Earth.
height of the holy mountain
(Taischan, In China Is about 6000
II feet above Talnpanfu, 1 and the dls
tance is something over sixteen
miles. The road is probably the best in
fill China. About a. milÂ© north of the
city walls a large pate stands amid thÂ»
ruins of once j flourishing suburbs, and
after passing this gate I found myself
In an avenue several miles In length, and
lined with temples, convents and holy
shrines, where pilgrims stop and pray If
they succeed in shaking off the thousands
of "besgars who occupy this only road
leading to the summit. They are not or
dinarily modest beggars, but' the real
lords cf the Taischan, who levy a sort ot
entrance fee. which every traveler Is com
pelled to pay. They are not content with
crouching modestly by the roadside, for
that would enable pilgrims to make their
escape. In order to prevent this each
beggar builds a sort of wall of loosa
stones about three feet high across the
avenue, with an opening of only a yard
In the center, and in this opening he sits
or kneels, knocking his head on the
ground, and shouts, screams and howls
at the approaching pilgrim. _
They make room for nobody. Each
traveler has to step over them, and na
turally enough a few cash coins are
thrown to them In order to avoid betnj?
touched or pulled by the clothes with
their sore and filthy hands. They are most
numerous ln'the lower portion of the road,
but they assail the pilgrims also a few
thousand feet higher up on the moun
tain. The real ascent begins at a stone
portal at which, according to its Inscrip
tion, the great Confucius himself halted
and turned back 2600 years ago, not hav
ing had the strength to climb the 6000
stone steps leading to the top. Imagine
a staircase leading to the top of Mount
Washington. These Taischan Btalrs are
by far the highest in the wide world, for
takinsr the number of steps In one story
of an ordinary house to be twenty, the
number of Taischan steps equals 300
stories. Still. I had to climb up, for these
steps are in " places so narrow that I
dared not trust my bones to the care of
my two chair coolies; moreover, they
were exhausted by the fatigue and beat!
and apparently unable to carry even the
empty chair. Their tariff for carrying
one person up and down the Taischan,
a distance, of twice sixteen miles, is 600
cash or 80 centsâ 15 cents for each coolie!
After six hours of tedious climbing I
passed through the gate of heaven and
Btood on the large plateau at the summit,
which Is covered with numerous temples
and stone monuments. The main tempiÂ©
Is that of the holy mother, consisting of
a number of buildings surrounded by a
high wall. Magnificent bronze statues
and bronze monuments adorn the several
courta, in the last of which rise* the prin
cipal temple, with a huge statue of the
holy mother on an altar. The doors of.
this temple are opened only once every
year for an Imperial commissioner, who
comes to collect the money offerings of
the pilgrims. But thanks to & substan
tial bakshish, or, as it is called In China,
"kumshah," a priest pushed a loose bar
of the main gate aside, enough to let me
have a glimpse of the Interior. The floors
of this large temple were filled with a
heap of coins three feet high â coins oC
every description, size and value, ancient
and modern, mostly brass cash, but many
millions of them, representing probably
110,000 United States currency. The money
is divided among the convents and beg
gars of the holy mountain, but the lion's
'ihare goes into the pockets of that enter
prising lady, the Dowager Empress.
Still higher up stands a temple dedi
cated to the "sleeping holy mother," and
entering I found an elegantly furnished;
bedroom, with a full lifesize doll lylnjr
under silk coverings on the bed. ThÂ» ac
companying- priest whispered to me not
to speak too loud, lest I should disturb
the young lady's slumber.â Century Mag

"Well, Mr. Schwab.'M said, ."this Is the
first time In the history of the world that
there has. ever been a company of such

He is a man of great hospitality. He
has a beautiful home in Plttsburg and ob

in Braddock; of keeping, open house. All

Schwab did not apply, and was surprised
to receive a letter from, the officers of the
Carnegie works- appointing him superin
tendent, an almost overwhelming honor
fw a man so ycung.. ,t > " â¢Â¦ *.
During the -Homestead strike, after the
strikers had ' been out two months and
there was no prospect of ( an early settle
ment, he went to the Homestead works,
and on account of the great fondness of
the men for him, in three weeks, through
his .individual efforts. "the strike was* de
clared off. At that, time he directed both
the " Edgar Thomson works and the
Homestead works from Homestead. His
most remarkable feat was the construc
tion of the armor plate department..
..Every Saturday In the Carnegie build-

heads of the departments attend. Noth

gest improvements and to discuss the
business In general. A record is kept of
all suggestions, and If they are good they
are acted upon. Mr. Schwab i said this
proved to be a very good plan, as no man
would make Idle suggestions before a con
gregation of skilled mechanics and finan
ciers, while he,mig^t If he" were, talking

to make . valuable suggestions, < and j It Â¦ is
on account of these and Inventions that
one '_ acquires , a standing. A, man .who
thus proved . himself . to be invaluable,un
der the old regime was given outright by
Mr. Carnegie : some stock, which was in
creased according to his further worth.' \
â¢ It .was at one -of ; these j banquets that
Mr. Schwab .was requested to leave â¢ the
room, and behind closed doors the j re
maining gentlemen elected him : vice
president of the company, which he de
clined, saying he preferred the position

"Well," rejoined Mr. Schwab, "that Â¦ is
easy to do if you have plenty to spend."
Mr. Carnegie -laughed. " "Tell your son
when you see him," he" said,- "that if he'll
stick to us we'll make a man of him."
Once" Mr. Carnegie was 'approached by
a conductor 'In a railroad train, who seated
himself beside him. 5 . " â¢ Â¦
."Mr'.j Carnegie," he said, "I see you have
a boy -from our mountain town in the'
Thomson works." . ."..-.' : Â¦ ;
"You mean young Schwab?" asked Mr.
Carnegie. '.:Â¦ . .:."Â¦-. "^
"Yes," replied the conductor. "I knew
him when he drove a' stage."
"Well, that didn't, hurt him," said -Mr.
Carnegie, dryly.
â¢Many.: years back ./'Charlie" Schwab
drove the great iron" master in his hack
over the mountains. .- But that did not lead
to a friendship between Mr.- Carnegie and
the boy, as some biographers delight in
Baying. The memory of that chance meet
ing remained In the mind of the boy mere
ly, and did not lead to his entering the
Bteel works. .
As general superintendent of the Edgar
Thomson works young Schwab received
$35,000 ; a year. While under W. R,
Jones, that gentleman showed his appre
ciation of the young man's value by see
ing that he received on Christmas day an
additional sum, of $250 in gold from the
company, and each succeeding year this
little gift was Increased. ;
Once' W. H. Jones remarked to Mr.
SpJgelmlre, his, brother-in-law, that if he
had the knowledge of mathematics that
Charlie had he would not be filling a posi
tion worth but $35,000 a year. Prior : to
the effort to make armor plate a success,
Charles â¢ M.' Schwab - began 'the study
of ; chemistry, and set apart : an . upper
room in his house for a laboratory, which
he fitted with the necessary appliances for
analysis of Iron, steel and ores. His wife,
who was Miss Emma Dinkey, his land
lord's 'daughter, whom he married when
he was 21 years old, encouraged him In his
work in the laboratory," and, unknown j to
him, often compounded certain elements
for him to solve. So it was that step by
step he learned chemistry, which he early
realized would. be Â¦ necessary^ for his suc
cessful advancement.
When the Carnegie officials were wor
ried about f the Â¦â¢Â¦ armor test, Mr. Schwab
told Henry: Phipps that . if he had a
laboratory properly fitted up he was sura
he could, be of great service." Â¦ â¢ ..
"How much would you need?" asked
Mr. â¢ Phipps. ;Â¦-Â¦Â¦.*â¢".-Â¦
Â¦ "One â¢;Â¦: thousand dollars," said ' Mr.
Schwab, and Mr. Phipps gave him 'that
sura. Â¦ - Â¦ r 'Â¦â¢'. Â¦ . â¢â¢ Â¦ . : -.
Some years. before- Mr. Schwab's ad
vancement became a matter of course Mr.
Jones once* answered 'the query as to: who
* ould succeed Â¦ him at the head 'of the
Is no place for you. - You can make better
useof your knowledge in our works." His
first job was driving iÂ»cakes at $6 a week.-
This was an Increase of $3 50, over the sal
ary he received in the store. He proved
himself â¢ so .valuable ' that , within six
months he ' became ; a bsistant engineer.
When the chief engineer was called awav
to attend to some work in the mines youn?
Schwab was promoted 'to his position.
Some other shops of the Carnegie Steel
Works were constructing : a steel bridge
for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the
charge of the construction for the rail
first bridge of the kind ever built in
America. Captain "Bob" Evans was In
road. It was an engineering feat. of some
magnitude, and the gentlemen of the Car
negie works who were in charge met with
difficulties which they were unable to sur
mount. - '-.--.; ':'â¢';. -
Then was a signal compliment * paid : to
the young engineer, although In different
works his skill was called into use, and he
successfully ; met Â¦;Â¦ all obstructions. This
was one of the feats which brought Mr.
Schwab at an early 1 age into prominence,
and : another was the metal . mixture pro-,
cess. By ~ the metal mixture â¢ process
molten Iron, Instead of cold pig iron,
is used In steel making. The
molten metal Is run into large mixing
reservoirs and quickly carried by , rail to
its destination.' Formerly It was run Into
Band beds and made into pigs, which* of
course required r em el ting before It could
be mixed. This was a great saving of
labor and of money, and | the- railway
which Mr. Schwab constructed ' for - the
quick carrying or the hot: metal from a
: difficult elevation to its proper destination
was a feat of engineering.
Just seven years after he entered the
Carnegie concern he was sent as chief en
gineer to rebuild the great Homestead
steel plant. , Previously he drew more at
tention, to himself by his construction, . as
an engineer, of eight of the nine mammoth
blast furnaces of the- Edgar Thomson
works, which were the largest In this
country. . , .
In 1887. he became superintendent of the
Homestead works. Five \ years . later, In
consequence of the tragic death of his
fast 'friend, W. R. Jones, he was made
general superintendent .of the â¢'. Edgar
Thomson works. 1 It was he who built the
great Bteel rail mill. He practically ' re-^
built the works, and Mr. Carnegie's 'ap
preciation of his services may best be told
by a little story. One day. he and three
of his partners drove from the Mountain
House, Cresson, where they were' stop
ping, to Loretto. "He pulled up his horses

r^f MAZEMENT has been expressed In
f\ Europe at the gigantic proportions
f~H of the most recent of our commer-
I dal ventures, "the bllllon-dollar
Bteel combine." Foreign commen
tators have likewise been astonished at
the youth of the man selected to preside
over Its destinies. Charles M. Schwab Is
only 39 years old, yet he has been selected
as tfie head of the biggest commercial
concern In the world. Indeed, he had no
competitors for the place. As soon as the
first announcements of the combine were
made Mr. Schwab was expected to become
its executive officer. He draws the big
gest salary on earth, unless some of the
crowned heads fce excepted.
As a gentleman closely allied with these
great Interests recently said.. "Mr. Schwab
la the only one by genius and tempera
ment fitted for the office." Another man
prominent in the steel business said that
Mr. Schwab Is greatly admired abroad,
that the greatest Iron master on the Con
tinent told him that he knew no ten men
who, combined, had the knowledge of the
steel industry that Mr. Schwab possesses.
As president of the Carnegie Steel Com
pany, Limited, he had under him 60,000
men; as president of the United States
Steel Corporation be will be In control of
500,000 men.
Twenty-one years ago Charles M.
Schwab, a stalwart lad of 18 years, left
his adopted town. Loretto, Pa,â he was
bora "in Wllllamsburg, Pa., February IS,
ISOâ to eeek fame and fortune in the more
prosperous town of Braddock. His father
was a weaver by trade and was engaged
for a time In the woolen manufacturing
business in Wllllamsburg, Pa. When
Charles M. Schwab -was 5 years old his
father sold out the woolen manufacturing
business and opened a hotel In Willlams
burg. Of course, the boy had been too
young to learn weaving, but he made the
factory h!s playground. At about this
time he showed great aptitude for music.
In which his brother Instructed him. and
when he "was so small that his feet could
barely touch the treadles he played the
organ In the little church.
John A. Schwab, his father, 'was not a
man of erudition, although he was excep
tionally clever at mathematics, for which
his son early showed a great taste. That
his children might receive a thorough ed
ucation he removed to Loretto, a little
town founded by a Russian Prince, Deme
trius Augustine Galitzin, Â¦whose father
was PuEsian Embassador to France. He
came to this country with letters of in
troduction to John Adams, a frfend of his
father. But. meeting Bishop Carroll of
Baltimore, he decided to enter the priest- ,
hood rather than be heir to estates rfnd
honors conferred on his family by the
Czar.
He became a rccltise and practically an
exile. He was the first missionary to es
tablish a mission on the far frontier. In
17S9 he struck an Indian trail that led to
Loretto, and being of a poetical nature
was impressed by the beauty of the prim
eval forest on the summit of a ridge of
the Alleehenies. and there established a
little mission. Now. 100 years after, there
ere but 200 inhabitants there, who, almost
â¢without exception, are Catholics. The
town to-day has no Jail and but one tav
ern, which is so seldom patronized that
the landlord barely makes a living.
It was over this place that this Russian
Prince lorded In a priestly manner for
many years, receiving a competency from
his father's estates, but having severed
his connection with the orthodox Greek
church In the later years of his life by
eome unexplained manipulation this comÂ»
petency was withheld, and he was com
pelled to ask aid from his devoted flock.
Forty-eight years after the founding of
Loretto a small band of monks, brothers
of the Regular Third Order of St. Francis,
erected with their own hands a monastery
a mile away from the village, which in a
few years afforded an education that
could not be excelled In the Eastern
States.
John A. Schwab In 1S72 moved from Wll
llamsburg. to Loretto and established a
livery business there, which was support
ed principally by traveling salesmen,
whom he met at Cresson station, five
miles distant, and drove to the outlying
towns and hamlets, then unconnected by
railroads. He had eighteen horses, which
assured him a comfortable living-. He had
the contract for carrying the malls from
Cresson station to Loretto, and nine miles
farther to St. Augustine. _
When he moved to Loretto the now head
of the bllllon-dollar combine was a chub
by faced boy of 10 years. It was his duty
to drive the stage for the mail twice a
day, and to carry students from the mon
astery to the station. The town was well
patronized during the summer months by
sojourners, and his father told me that
Charlie had such a winning way that he
could go to the summer resort, Mountain
House, Cresson, and persuade the guests
to take drives. He was a "money win
ner," he said, and many a day he made
u much as $25.
The â¢urronndlng hills of Loretto are
wooded with hemlock, beach, pine and
maple, and the road leading to Cresson
station winds over hill and down dale,
through a thick forest where the wood
man's ax Is often heard. Once, late at
Trfgttt, on hi* return with the mail he was
held up by two oxen, who, thinking the
boy was unarmed, led his frightened
horses into the woods. But young- Schwab,
equal to any 'emergency, gave show of
tot of each small caliber that It waa al
most a toy, and the men retreated.
H* attended a country school, at Loretto
for three months Curing winter, where he
â¢arty displayed a great love of mathema
tics. Els affahfTIty and earnestness were
two of his snat traits. Although perfect*
ly able to take care of himself, he never
SÂ«t Into a fight. The nearest be came to
being disorderly was on a. St. Patrick's
day, when the master, although an Irish
man, declared }t would not be a holiday
and required the pupils to report for
study. The whole school rebelled, tbo
boys talcing the Initiative. They secured
a ladder and climbed to a loft above the
room of learning, and from the trap door
Irritated the master by occasionally well
aimed paper balls. He ordered them down,
but they displayed no desire to obey, so
he told Mr. Schwab, who was In the liv
ery stable, of his predicament, and that
gentleman, seizing a stout whip, hastened
to tha scene of conflict sad ordered them
down.
Without any hesitation the present head
of the billion dollar combine obeyed
by lowering' the ladder, which, when he
reached the floor, was quickly pulled up.
And then the father gave his boy probably
his first thrashing, which he now delights
In telling.
When two rears had passed he went
to St. Francis' College, and for four years
regularly attended that place of learning.
He was always at the head of his class,
and In mathematics he surprised the
monks. He seemed to have an Innate

mind Is continually on his work.
' One winter Mr. Carnegie and he werÂ«
spending a few days In Florida, and as a
lark went to a colored church. After the
sermon the minister asked for a collection
for rewhltewashing the church. When
the basket was passed to Mr. Carnegie
and Mr. Schwab they dropped in a coup'.a
of crisp bills of large denomination.
When the basket was placed on the desk
in front of the colored divine, that worthy
put on hia spectables and with astonish
ment stamped on his face closely exam-
Ined the bills, and then addressing tha
congregation, said:
"De whitewashing of dls church will
begin to-morrow, provldln' that the**
here notes dat de gen'lemen In do rear ob
de church dropped In de basket are not
counterfeits." . :' ;: : ,.;
In Loretto, his schoolboy home, he Is
known simply . as Charlie.' He addresses
his friends by their first name and shakes
hands with them. all. His manner, an oM
resident said, is Just the same as when he
was a boy and drove the hack. He never
visits Loretto without going to sea
Michael Malloy, the wheelwright. When
he was a schoolboy he assisted Malloy' a
son, who had cut his foot badly, all tha
way home. When young Malloy j grew
older and young Schwab was working his
way up In the Carnegie works, the Malloy
boy said he would like to leave Loretto
and study medicine, which wish Mr.
Schwab facilitated by bearing all the ex
penses.
Recently' he showed his kindness of
heart toward a girl of that mountain vil
lage, who waa on her sick bed for ten
months with blood poisoning, by sending
her. to a hospital in Pittsbursr and defray
ing all the expenses. And although
pressed by duties of his office he found
time to frequently call on the daughter
of his home town till she passed beyond.
The people In the community of Loretto
are comparatively poor and when the pas
tor found it necessary to tear down the
old church Mr. Schwab came forward anÂ«l
offered to build another at a cost of $250,
000. It U now In course of erection anÂ«l
is of great beauty. In front of the church
he erected a monument of Prince Galltzen.
Some time ago he built a church for a
community In Braddock.
Probably no man has acquired such vast
wealth at such an- early age and in such
a short space of time as Mr. Schwab.
When asked to explain his success he sim
ply replied: "A man should always stand
on his own feet, take advantage of op

There was a half-witted eccentric char

that Charlie Schwab, even at that early
age, showed the consideration for others
that he still retains, and always called
Michael Molloy by his baptismal name.
He waa never known to be impudent or to

Ob the summit of a hill In Loretto,
where now stands bis eummer home, there
was a clump of pine trees. Often of an
afternoon, when returning from St. Fran
cis College with. his books under his arm,
he squatted on the nine needles and
studied. Once his mother, a gentlewoman,
- who always encouraged him, . found him
there on a Sunday afternoon diligently
reading. Turning to her he said: "Moth
er, when I become a man and become rich
I'm going to build a house on this spot."
"When the house -was completed, .two
years ago, his mother' reminded him of
Ilia remark, which he bad forgotten as
having made publicly.
While he was In. the grocery store In
Braddock he made a fast friend of a Mr.
Rlnard, a department superintendent of
the Edsrax Thomson Steel Works, belong

gentleman often took him about with him
at night through the works. One day,
after he. was about two months In Mr.
Splgelmlre's grocery btore, "W. R.' Jones,
who was â¢ superintendent of the Ed

One might imagine that one acquainted
with such success would be changed to a
degree in manner, but to-day he is as un
assuming as when he was a ruddy
cheeked schoolboy in Loretto. He has a
; great respect for his workmen. It was
only lately that he remarked to me that
"the 'greatest satisfaction I have is that
all my men seem to bear a great love for
me."
"You cannot fool a workman." he con
tinued. "You cannot make believe to be
his friend and at the same time browbeat
him. He's a man above being fooled. In
my opinion workmen are more honest as
a class than capitalists." ,
In his office he Is like a great dynamo.
â¢Indeed, he is the generator of all the
great movements of the Carnegie people.
Although his manner over his desk is
one of strict and exacting- application, he
Is still affable. The workmen know that
at any moment he may appear rapidly
walking through the works and . noting
things as he passes. He Is a man of gen

believes In the active encouragement of
every man in his employ. While superin

In this latter regard Dr. R. "W. Shuf eldt
of this city has demonstrated the won
derful possibilities' of photography under I

as a scientist arid writer, has , co-operated
with the Fish Commission in his labors,
and has reached, as intimated,"most.as
tonishing and encouraging results. ... !, .
Dr. Shufeldt's subjects were taken in thÂ©
aquaria of the Fish Commission's build-'
ing while floating idly in' the .water, or
swimming about for exercise or in search
of. food, so that the pictures represent the
fishes as they . habitually live instead of
under such extraordinary; conditions as
leaping into the , air after a | fly or, pro-,,
jecting themselves from the. water to-es
cape ' a . pursuing enemy. The . flsh '.with
which Dr. ShufeJdt seems to have the best
luck is the common fresh waterVsunfish;
known to many outside of the scientific
world as "pumpkin seed." 'The'Intricate
markings and mottllngs of ; the , species,
together with their grouping; are , beauti-^

photographs.' *ITor fully two hours on an.
intensely sultry afternoon," writes Dr. '
Shuf eldt, "I was obliged to wait j before
one of these specimens came Into the
proper' place to be photographed." .
The result, : however,' has repaid the
trouble, as the pictures are as perfect as
If taken through. the medium of air in

of the large-mouthed black bass is among
the finest examples. Other photographs
made include those of the .naked star

Literary Ethics in Humor.
"Although my book 'Squirrel Inn' was
dramatized, I can claim no greater dis
tinction in that achievement than hav
ing written the book," he said, and he
folded his hands modestly on his lap and
tried to look the lesser half of that event,
as becomes the author of most dramatized
stories, according- to modern tenets.
There Is a suggestion In this view of
the matter whether the gaping wounds
that the stabbing process of dramatlzers
Is dealing to literature are not separating
the literary men from thÂ© theater en
tirely.
The literary humorist would never cay
of his books, as the comedians ray of
themselves and their plays, "It is to
laugh," and I have e^-en found that thÂ©
men who have written representative
American humor nearly all have the same
grievance against the broad grin and the

professional humorist he looked at me
suspiciously and was doubtful whether
the imputation was complimentary or
not. . -

FRANK R. STOCKTON DISCLOSES SOME OF THE METHODS OF A LITERARY HUMORISTTh2 PTS-frtesded M^n an d ifie S^^^tca^ PsssgnS^S-
HE looked Just as pig-headed as he
turned out to be. There was no
doubt about his being a stranger
in a strange land, for while his
clothes were not rustic appearance
there was an unfamiliar cut about them.
And then he carried a traveling bag and
wore spats. m
When the conductor of the Fourth-ave
nue car called for his fare the stranger
dug down Into his pocket and drew out
a. bill. The man In blue, who bore on his
right sleeve three gold service stripes as
proof of wonderful forbearance with all
kinds and conditions of people, squinted
at the bill and shook his head.
"That ain't no good In this country."
he said.
"Of course It's good," said the Btranger,
still sticking it forth. "It's a Canadian
five-dollar bill."
"Can't take It," repeated the conductor.
'They won't take it off me at the office."
"Well, you've got to take it," said the
stranger, "or stop the car and put . me
off. It's money and good money."
The conductor acted like a human be
ing. He took tlft bill and looked It all
over again. Then he referred it to a
passenger.
" j. never saw a bill like that bef ore/'
he said. "What do you think ' of it."
The passenger told him he was right
in not accepting it because it was not
legal tender in this country and because
he could not get rid of it except at a
discount even at a bank. So the con
ductor passed it over to its owner' once
more.
"Tou* re In America now," he said, good
r-aturedl-. "You'll have to pay American
money. If I took that I'd be stuck with
It myself."
Still the "passenger was pig-headed.
"WeK," he said, "you'll have to stop the
car and put me off. That's all." Â»
Then he settled back doggedly and
scowled. - Th<Â» controversy â¢' had . attracted,
great attention in the car. . Every one
was looking at the stranger, and a man
who sat across from him, thinking ' that
the five-dollar bill was all the stranger
had, gave the conductor a nickel for | the
fare and the "other passengers took it for
granted that the controversy was all set
tled.
But not so. : The pig-headed young man
arose with a grun.t and again dug Into
his trousers pocket. This time he pulled
out' several American ., one-dollar- . bills.
One of these he offered to the conductor.
\ "I got your fare," said the conductor.
"No. you haven't." insisted the strang
er. "I haven't paid." .
"But this man paid for . you."
"He's not me. Change the bill."
"I ain't got . the change," insisted the
conductor. . .
The man with the spats was getting red
In the face. He offered the one-dollar bill
to the man who had paid his fare. The
man- would ; not Â¦ take . it. . * -
"I can l pay my ' way," exclaimed the
stranger. "Give me the change." ;

The very modest young lady who likes
low shoes to tramp the hot, dusty byways

funny little figures, either in white or
pink, and always with a drop stitch. They
are cool, and no one, even a erank, could
possibly accuse one of wearing- anything

to be in Washington by April 20 to await
the convenience of the President.
The first car set apart for the President's
personal use has been sidetracked for tha
very good reason that lt bears the name
"Imperial" In bright gold letters on its
sides. When those in charge of the train
arrangements caught sig-ht of this name
it did not take long to decide that another
-ir with a less significant name would ba
more acceptable and the "Olympia" was
ordered here 1 from the Pacific Coast. The
"Imperial" and "Olympia" are two of tho
most Bumptuous and' luxurious cars built
by the Pullman Company and there 13 no
choice between them. ;
The" Olympia. is seventy feet longr and
has five private rooms, a spacious obser
vation room and accommodations for
cuisine and servants' quarters. The din
ing and observation room is seventeen feet
long and is furnished in vermilion. The

to Helena, where dinner will be had. The
party will reach the park on. the. morning
of May 29 and spend three days traveling
through it. . In , this ~ brief time all the,
features of. the reservation' cannot be
visited and several of the famous geysers
will necessarily be missed. But the plan
is to havÂ»'the party see the best of the
scenery and. the- most -picturesque, of. the
great natural wonders. Upon leaving the
park on the evening of May 31 the party
will double back to Anaconda and thence
southward for Salt Lake City. The Kan
sas itinerary will include stops at Topeka,
Emporia, Ottawa, Baldwin; Lawrence and

/ a Bond Surety.
HELENA. Mont., April 13.âCounsel for
United States Senator W. A. Clark and
his son, Charles W. Clark, late this after
noon filed a petition In the Supreme Court
praying for an order releasing them from
further responsibility as sureties on the
bond of P. Augustus Heinze in the famous
Pennsylvania case. Their aggregate lia
bility on the bond, which was given to se
cure the Boston and Montana Company,
is $375,000.
The Clarks say that Heinze by false
representations as to the value of his as
sets induced them to go on his bond. They
will make a similar application on the
same ground in the Federal court on Mon
day for an order releasing them from lia
bility as sureties on other of Heinze's
bonds. The liability of Senator Clark and
his son on Heinze's bonds aggregates
about $1,000,000.

FRENCH HATRED
FOR GERMANS
HAS VANISHED
This Is ; Shown by the
Big Demonstrations
at Toulon, .
Editor Cofnely of the Figaro
Tells of 'the Wonderful
- Change in Ten Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April 13.â J. Comely, editor of
the Figaro, says: "If any one ten years
ago had predicted to the French that the
day would come ' when Italian sailors
would be acclaimed at Toulon, when the
uncle of the King at the head of a squad
ron would pay a visit to the President of
the republic and would be received with
enthusiasm, that person would have pass
ed for a lunatic. At that moment the
Italians had not recognized their error in
believing that France had the slightest
intention of restoring the temporal power
of . the Pone and that the French would
never pardon their alliance with Ger
many. They were making a commercial
war behind the scenes and the two na
tions detested one another. . '
"Those unhappy days have passed, and
Italy has no longer any fear of our in
tervention, and we, on our own side,, no
longer wish harm to the ally of Germany,
for, at bottom, -we no longer hate Ger
many. Our soldiers are fighting side by
side with- theirs and our capitalists are
disputing who will lend Germany money.
"The Franco-Italian demonstration la
therefore a happy event, received sympa
thetically by the press of two worlds. It
is another great success for M. Loubet
and for his Government."

er Â£t. Louis, after a visit to Norway,
where he 'inspected the steamer Magda

Wellman said the Magdalena will sail for
the Arctic regions this year or next,
"but," he added, "1 do not know whether
I shall command her or not." .
Wellman says there is no truth in the
report that Dr. Nansen and the Duke of

on hand, while the EKike of Abruzzi Is at
present confining his ambition to the

NEW ORLEANS, April 13.â Judge Par
lapge in the United States District Court
to-day handed down a decision dismissing
the suit brought by the Boer representa
tives here to prevent the shipment of
mules and horses out of New Orleans to
the British army in South Africa.
Judge Parlange holds that the transac
tions between citizens of - the -.United
States and the British Government "were
conducted under the order of private citi
zenship, and that the courts had abso
lutely no jurisdiction to interfere. -' The
horses and mules, the court said, were
bought in a neutral territory. Judge Par
lange continues: "If the complainants
could be heard to assert here rights "per
sonal to themselves in the treaty invaded,
and if the mules and horses involved in
this cause are munitions of war, all of
which is disputed by the defendants, it
would become necessary to- determine
whether the United States .intended by
the declaration of the treaty (of Washing
ton of May, 1S71) to subvert the well es
tablished principle of international law
that the private citizens of a neutral na
tion can lawfully sell supplies to bellig
erents. The principle that neutral citi
zens may lawfully sell to belligerents has
lonsr since been settled in this country by
the highest judicial authority."

gram to-day rully confirming a report
from Bremen of the recovery of the gold
stolen from the specie room of the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grossc. The cablegram
Elves no details beyond the fact' that the
g-oM was discovered c-u the ship by a.
eteward and had been turned over to the
figents of the company. Herman Winter
of Oelricha & Co. said:
"Yes. we have found the sold, and now
to get the thief or thieves. We will make
& most searching investigation. It seems
dear that whoever took the gold either 1
lacked the opportunity to get it ashore or
fulled in courage. My advices give no in
formation as to the circumstances of the
discovery and do not Indicate that any
one is euspected."
The National City Rank, consignor of
the gold, was also notined of Its lecovery.
The finding of the gold on the ship cre
ates the impression that some member of
the crew was the thief, but the absence
of detail* leaves the matter- open.

PAYMENT IS REFUSED
FOE, ATTACHES' LIQUORS
Comptroller of the Treasury Will Not
Allow Claim, for Money Spent
in Cuba,*
"WASHINGTON, April 13. â The Comp
troller of the Treasury has reaffirmed a
Â¦decision of hie office disallowing a claim
for JC28 from Lieutenant Colonel J. W.
Jacobs, deputy quartermaster general.
The original decision of the Comptroller
-of June 30, 1S99, disallowed the amount
lor the reason that It was "expended with
out authority of law for subsistence,
Â¦wines and liquors furnished foreign mili
tary attaches accompanying the army into
the field." A rehearing was sought some
â¢time afterward, but denied. The "case is
now reopened, but the claim is again dis
-ailowed.
On June 30, 1898, General Shafter, who
Â¦was then at Tampa, telegraphed the Sec
retary of War that representatives of the
foreign governments had come to him
with proper credentials permitting them
to accompany the army of the United
States.
General Shafter said that he desired to
entertain these officers in the manner due
their position and for this purpose he re
quested that $2000 of the contingent fund
of the army be placed to the credit of his
aid de camp Lieutenant J. P. Miley. The
Secretary of War arÂ»i>roved the request
and a warrant for $2000 was sent to Coio
3iel Jacobs, as chief quartermaster, for
disbursement, the money being expended
tinder the verbal direction of General
61iaf ter. The Comptroller decided that the
expenditure was entirely illegal and in the
Teamrmation of his decision ears:
"There is no provision of law in any of
the specific or general appropriations for
the army which au^.onzes tho military
authorities to Invite foreign attaches to
be the guests of the Government in time
of war and hence their fare and mainte
nance do not appear to be necessary,
usual or appropriate to the objects for
â¢which the appropriation was made."

AND OPERATIVES IDLE
Dull Cotton Market Causes Several
Corporations to Suspend Opera

LOWELL,. Mass.. April 13.âThe 2300
operatives of the Massachusetts Cotton
Milla were notified to-day not to return to

BRITISH FIRMS HAVE
NO CATTSE TO COMPLAIN

LONDON, April 13.â The London man
ager of the American company which has
received the contract to Install -new tele
phone apparatus for the British Govern
ment in an Interview with a correspond
ent to-day regarding the press allegations
that the company is receiving half of the
Â£2,000,000 appropriated by Parliament
Without fair, competition or giving a
chance to the British firms said:
"Our contract does not reach anything
like Â£1,000,000. The cables we are install
ing were made by British labor at our
works at Woolwich. Only materials which
are absolutely unsecurable here are being
imported from America. The British post
office authorities and all persons connect
ed with telephonic construction in Great
Britain and on the Continent admit that
these are far ahead of any made on this
side. The greater part of the appropria
tion of Â£2,000,000 will be spent in breaking
up roads and similar work. The British
firms had a fair show and it was only
when it was found they were unable to
provide the materials that the postoffice
here dealt with an American firm."
MORGAN WTLh NOT DO
BUSINESS IN ETTROPE
New York Financier Says He Has
No Commercial Flans on the
Continent. '
LONDON. April 13.âJ. P. Morgan reit
erated to-day that his visit to Europe is
not 'connected with the United States
Steel Corporation or any new enterprise.
"I have no special business here," said
Morgan, "but came here, as I come every
year, for rest. The report that I am here
to place eteel stock in England and on
the Continent is almost too ridiculous to
contradict. The report contradicts itself
to any one who will take the trouble to
think. The stock which the United States
Steel Corporation issues in exchange for
the various companies it has taken over Is
in the hands of the original holders of the
stock of those companies. These various
companies and neither the steel corpora
tion nor J. P. Morgan & Co., have any
stock to sell."
In regard to the Continent and the anx
iety with which Berlin is said to be wait-
Ing his arrival, Morgan said:
"I am going to AIx before returning.
But this is the present extent of my plans
for the Continent. I may go to Berlin,
but certainly not on business so far as I
know at present."

Out of 78 recruits from various parts of

of Germany. Twenty-two of the recruits
questioned designated the Emperor as a
great general; 9 called him a renowned
field marshal: 6 thought him to be the
Minister of War, while 14 of the replies
were approximately correct. Several
thought the late Prince Bismarck was
Emperor, a great poet, a translator of
the Bible, etc.
From statistics It is learned that crime
among adults in Prussia is decreasing,
while juvenile crime is increasing. One
fourth of the criminals sentenced In Prus

highbinders, members of the Hip Sing

each charged with perjury. This Is the
first offensive move of the Stockton citi
zens who have Interested themselves in
the case of How Wai, the wife of Wong
Gam. There is the promise of a vigorous
prosecution, and it is likely that four
members of Heinlenvllle's most murder
ous tong will spend the next few years in
prison.
How Wai is proprietress of a cigar store
on Main street, in Stockton. Her husband,
Wong Gam, Is the steward of the Com
mercial Hotel, where he has worked for
the past eighteen years. Jon Jan, a Hip
Sir.g highbinder, decided to make the

San Joee and sought the aid of the local
organization of the Hip Sing. warrant
was sworn charging the woman with hav
ing stolen $290 from Jon Jan at Heinlen
viile on the 10th of last December.
At the preliminary examination, held In
Justice Wallace's ycourt, a number of per
sons from Stockton were in attendance
with an attorney, and it was conclusively
proved that How Wai had never before
been in San Jose and â¢was sick in Stockton
on the day the crirke was alleged to have
been committed. She was discharged, and
to-day Jon Jan and three of the witnesses
at the examination were arrested for per

pursuing the work of securing
the requisite number of flowers
for the decoration of St. James Park for

result will be a sufficient quantity of
flowers for the purposes required.
The big bouquet for Mrs. McKinley, It

feet in circumference and will require
about two tons of blossoms. These will
all be contributed,, and special commit

VICTORIA, B. C.. April liâ News of
more rich discoveries In the Klondike and
adjacent mining districts was received by
the steamer Amur, which returned from
Ska&uay this afternoon. Controller J. T.
Llthgow of th-e Northwest Mounted
Police, who has returned to Dawson from
Selkirk and the Pelly, brought a report
of rich strikes made on the Upper Pelly
River. He said that miners who had
come down had caused much excitement
at Selkirk and at the madhouses on the
Yukon by accounts they gave of the finds
on this river, which branches off the
Yukon to the east, above Selkirk. The
exact location of the find was not learned,
the report being an indefinite one. The
mounted police officer reported that there
Â¦was much placer rnining activity on the
creeks between Daweon and Selkirk.
The Dawson news tells of a rich silver
find in the Klondike. F. M. Brown, an old
miner, formerly employed in the Com-
Etock silver mines of Nevada, reports to
that paper the discovery of a great .silver
quartz lead, within eight days' travel of
Dawson City. He says that to get sup
plies and machinery there now would be a
difficulty, but if the country were within
easy access the question of the develop
ment of the strike would be a simple one.
In his opinion a. fortune awaits those Â¦who
find the opportunity to develop the dis
covery.
News was received in dispatches from
Dawson that the clean-up on the creeks
had commenced with the beginning of
April. Reports from Hunker were to the
effect that miners began work there on
April 2 with a full sluice head of water.
At Grand Forks sluicing had not com
menced, but It was expected to begin
Â¦washing the big dumps In a few days. An
earlier report given by a correspondent
writing from Dawson on March 26 said
that mine-owners were then most active
and looking forward to beginning opera
tions with the first available water.
Lumber was being sawn for the sluices
and freight hurried to the creeks. Saw
mills were being started and everything
â¢vvae busy in the mining' camp.

SUPERIOR JUDGE RUXES
AGAINST SUPREME COTJBT
Declares Its Interpretation of Certain
Law ' to Be Opposed to Public
â¢Policy.
REDDING, April 13.â In the Superior
Court this morning Judge Edward Swee
ney ruled against the Supreme Court of
the State. The unusual ruling came up In
a case brought against the Board of Su
pervisors by a taxpayer. The county
fathers recently awarded a contract to the
Parcells Greenwood Company, of San
Francisco for the construction of a fence
around the courthouse grounds, and the
contract was let without competitive bids.
Frank M. Swasey, a local newspaper man
and Federal, officeholder, brought suit to
enjoin fulfillment of the contract, alleging
the proceedings to have been irregular
and the fence unnecessary.
District Attorney Dozier for the Super
visors interposed a demurrer, which wa3
overruled this morning. In announcing
his judgment on the demurrer Judge
Sweeney remarked that while the State
law of to-day, as Interpreted by the Su
preme Court, upheld the action of the Su
pervisors in letting the contract without
advertising for bids, he did not consider
it good law and declared it to be against
public policy. - Â¦ â¢-'Â¦Â¦**

Alleged Wreckage May Have Been
Set Adrift by Reinsurance
' Speculators.
VANCOUVER, B.C., April 13.â The ar
rival of the British ship Ardnamurchan,
supposed for a long time to have been lost
off the Oregon coast, has given rise to
much excitement in marine and Insur
ance companies in this city. It is charged
in the Vancouver dally papers that "a
scheme may have been arranged to make
the possibility of reinsurance speculations.
The shiD left here Â¦ on November 28 last
and was 141 days out on her trip at the
time she was sighted. The extraordinary
feature Is the finding along the Oregon
coast of seven different brands of salmon
known to have been shipped, three ex
clusively, on the Ardnamurchan. This
seemed to establish the fact that the ves-"
sel was lost. It was ascertained that the
salmon cases found were among the first
put into the vessel and if any part of the
cargo was Jettisoned it would be the top
layers, so It was considered- absolutely
certain that the vessel had gone to pieces
and that this cargo had been washed
ashore. _ â¢ ' '
Just as soon as the news of the picking
up of part of the cargo had reached Van
couver reinsurance rates began to go up
and climbed wildly, as high as 80 per cent,
but no part of the vessel was found and
local pilots ridiculed the idea of the loss
of so fine a new ship. Two firms here
realized largely In reinsurance, one clean
ing up* $14,000 In all/
The suggestion Is that the picking up of
the salmon cases may in some way have
been previously arranged In order to
benefit the speculators.
VALLE.JO, April 13.â The naval trans

LOS ANGELES^ April 13.â The rela
tives of Senator W. A. Clark character
lz^ the report that the Senator Is engaged
to marry Hattie Rose Laube as without
foundation. J. Ross Clark, brother of the
Senator, said to-night:
"You may say as broadly as you care
to that the rumored engagement of my
brother is a fake of the rankest kind."
While in this city Miss Laube made sev
eral calls at the home of the Senator's
mother and on one occasion she left her
photograph. The Senator's sister says
that her visits were wholly unsolicited and
that her picture was thrown into the
waste basket.
"We view her," said Miss Clark, "in
the light of an adventuress, who is try
ing to obtain advertising cheaply. Before
leaving Los Angeles for San Diego a week
ago two local newspapers investigated
Miss Laube' s veiled assertions concerning
an engagement between Clark and her
self. She furnished ' one paper with .a
ready-made interview, in which, in an
swer to a self-inflicted question, she said:
'You must excuse me from talking about
my rumored engagement to Senator Clark.
I am not ready either to affirm or deny
the report you have heard. However, I
will admit that I consider the Senator a
grand man. whom I will probably marry
if I ever marry anybody.' "
Senator Clark's brother says the ac
quaintance between the Senator and Miss
Laube is very slight. He met her in a
purely Informal manner during his Sena
torial contest, when she was making po
litical speeches. "While here Miss Laube
lectured on "Human Magnets." Her fath
er accompanied her in the capacity of
press agent.
BAN DIEGO, April 13.â Miss Hattie Rose
Laube, who, in rumors alleged to have
been started in Los Angeles, has been
credited with being the afflancee of Sena
tor W. A. Clark of Montana, Is at the
present a guest at the St. James Hotel in
this city. When seen by The Call corre
spondent this evening she acknowledged
having avoided newspaper men on account
of this report. When asked for a con
firmation of the rumor she said that it
was not her place to make public any
thing of the kind, nor should sne be asked
to deny it.
"I have noted the fact that it Is quite
customary for people to deny engage
ments when they are reported about them,
but In this case I believe that It will be
better to neither affirm nor deny the re
port and you may quote me as saying that
and nothing more," she said.
"But," she was told, "the rumor has
been denied by the relatives of Senator
Clark."
"That may be," Miss Laube replied, "but
you may have noted that relatives do not
always know what they are talking about
and possibly It may have occurred to you
that everybody does not run to his rela
tives with confidences of that sort. Would
it not be well for you to inquire regarding
these matters of Senator Clark himself.
He Is In the best position to speak of
rumors which concern himself. Certainly
his relatives are not commissioned to talk
and if such a thing were true, which I am
careful to neither affirm nor deny, I am
the one to be questioned about It.
Miss Laube Is here with her father and
said this evening that she did not know
how long: they would remain, as she had
not consulted with her father on that
point. - .Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦

BRAIN FOOD
gested.
Is of Little Benefit "Unless It Is Di-
Nearly every one will admit that as
a nation we eat too much. meat and too
little of vegetables and the grains. â¢
For business men, office men and clerks,
and in fact every one engaged in. seden-
tary or indoor occupations, grains, milk
and vegetables are much more healthful.
Only men engaged in a severe outdoor
manual labor can live on a heavy meat
diet and continue In health. ' . ,
Â¦ As a general rule, meat once a day Is
sufficient for all classes of men, women
and children, and grains, fruit and vege-
tables should constitute the bulk of food
But" many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult of digestion and it is of jio
use to advise brain workers to eat large-
ly of grains and vegetables where the
digestion is too weak to assimilate them
properly.
. It â¢ is always best to get the best re-
sults from our food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meals to' assist the relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years', experience have
proven Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets to be
a very 'safe, pleasant, and effective di-
gestive and a remedy which may be taken
daily with 'the best results. â¢
. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hardly
be called a patent medicine, as they do
not act on the bowels nor any particular
organ, but only on the food eaten. They
supply what' weak - stomachs lack, pep-
sin diastase, and- by stimulating the gas-
tric glands increase. the natural secretion
of hydrochloric acid. .
. People who make a a dally practice 'of
taking-one ortwo of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal are sure to have
perfect digestion, -Â¦ which means perfect
health, .-v,- â¢ Â¦. Â¦ _ Â¦
There Is ' no , danger of forming an in-
jurious habit, as the tablets contain ab-
solutely -nothing but natural digestives;
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
no place ' in a ;;Â¦ stomach - medicine " , and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are certainly
the . best > known and . most popular of ; all
stomach remedies. " ' . Â» . v
'Ask your druggist ; for a BO-cent pack-
age 1 of - Stuart's Â¦ Dyspepsia \ Tablets. - and
after a week's use note the Improvement
in health, appetite and nervous energy.

pany in that capacity for about a year.
The road, which was owned by the North

LOS ANGELES, April 13.â If the conten
tion of the attorneys for the Los Angeles
Water Company are correct, the bond is
sue,voted by a. majority of nearly five to
one, for the purchase and acquirement of
the water plant now In . dispute between
the corporation and the people has be
come absolutely null and void, the recent
Legislature having at an opportune time
come to the water company's assistance. '
The act which is expected by the watÂ°
company's legal department to thus still
further retaru municipal ownership of me
water, plant is entitled Senate bill 124, in
troduced by Senator E. K. Taylor of Ala- j
meda to meet a local situation in the
northern end of the State. So far as" the
record shows Its passage was . not op
posed by any *of the members of the Los
Angeles delegation.
â¢ The act in question Is said to supersede ,
all other laws governing the. issuance of;
bonds for water purposes or, for the ac- '
qulrement of other public utilities, and j
provides for the authorization of .the in
curring of indebtedness by cities, : towns I
and municipal corporations for municipal :
improvements, regulating their acquisi- !
tlon, construction and completion. ~
It is contended that under a recent de
cision of the Superior Court all bond sales
are validated where the details have not 1
been completed, if In the meantime the 1
statute bearing upon the subject has been
changed in any important particular. The :
bond issue . voted by Â¦ the people of Los I

EXCITING MEETING HELD
BY 'I'H K FBUIT GROWERS
Many Speakers Denounce tb.Â© Recent
Cut in the Price of
â¢ ' Prunes.
SAN JOSE, April 13.â The fruit growers
of the State held an excited meeting In
Hale's Hall this afternoon, a number of
the speakers hotly denouncing the Cured
Fruit Association for having reduced the
price of prunes from 3 to 2 cents per
pound. Some were in favor of putting the
.association into liquidation, while others
, advocated a continuation of the combine
at least . until the present surplus stock
shall have been disposed of. .
' Judge Bond, president of the associa
tion,, talked for nearly an hour, reviewing
the Work of the organization from the
date of its formation.
He "said .that not only was the prune
market overstocked, but -there was the
same- surplus In. thÂ© East and abroad In
pears, apricots and apples. The Eastern
jobbers absolutely refused to handle any
Considerable quantity of prunes at a rate
exceeding a 2-cent basis. ! " Â¦
. Judge Bond announced that the associa
tion had decided to do no more advertis
ing. Already $20,000 has been expended
and this sum hardly covers the total re
ceipts for the extra sales in consequence
of the advertising. Proposed changes to
the laws regulating the election of officers
f were approved.
Horse Thief Captured.
SAN RAFAEL, April 13.â A bold thief at
Sausalito this morning stole a horse and
cart belonging to Dr. Mays. Word was
sent to Tiburon, and .Constable McNeil
arrested a man who gave the name of
Paul Rainey as he was trying to drive the
stolen property on the Tiburon boat.
Rainey Is almost unknown here. To-night
he was turned over to Sheriff Taylor.
SACRAMENTO, April 13.â The Interest-
Ing, feature of, the meetine of the 'State
Board of Education this afternoon was
the adoption of a resolution suspending
the teacher's diploma of S. C. Phipps, as-'
sistant Instructor at the State University,"
for the term - of two years. Phippa was
recently appointed to his present position
in the university. His offense consisted
in having: paid 5250 to JJ'M. Chretien, the
San Francisco attorney, whose exposure
by The Call landed him in the San Quen
tin Penitentiary, for which sum Chretien
agreed to obtain for him the position of
Deputy Superintendent of Schools in San
Francisco. â¢ â¢
Phipps sent a letter to the State Board
of Education, saying that he had known
Chretien a long time and supposed he
was doing no wrong in paying him money
for his assistance in obtaining a position.
He pleaded for leniency.
Several of the members were In favor
of suspending Phipps for. a period of flve
years, but a majority, believed this would
be too severe, and it was finally decided
to make the suspension two years. One
member said he believed Phipps had been
led through ignorance of public matters
to make the mistake. .
In speaking of the plan to buy school
book plates, President . Benjamin Ide
Wheeler said that the Jaws of the power
ful publishers had been .pried open and
there was a chance now for open compe
tition. The big book concerns had en
deavored to get the textbook business In
their- grasp, but failed. He offered tha
form of a letter to be sent to publishers
asking for bids on plates of elementary
and grammar school histories. The form
as suggested was adopted.
Before adjournment late this afternoon
the board issued the following diplomas:

When Using Catarrh Medicines.
â¢Catarrh la the short route to consump-
tion and the importance of early and judi-
cious treatment of catarrh, whether locat-
ed in the head, throat or bronchial tubes,
cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The list of catarrh cures is as long: as
the moral law and the forms in which
they are administered, numerous and cou-
fufeing, from sprays, inhalers, washes,
ointments, and salvas to powders, liquid?
and, tablets. ,..-..Â¦ .-._..
Â» The tablet form is undoubtedly the most
convenient and most effective, . but with
nearly all advertised catarrh remedies it
is almost entirely aVmatter of .< euesswork-
as to whal you are taking iritoyvour sys-
tem, as the proprietors, while making- all
sorts of claims as to what their medicines
will do, always keep it a close secret as to
what they are. â¢ ',_.*;,.
The -success and popularity of the neiy
catarrh cure, atuart's Catarrh Tablets.- is
largely because it not only cures catarrh
but 1 because 'catarrh sufferers who i use
these tablets know what they are taking
into their systems. Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets ; betng .composed of- Eucaiyptol, Hy-
drastln, Gualcol and similar valuable and
antiseptic ingredients; and are pleasant to
the taste and being dissolved in the mouth
they take immediate pffect upon the mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passaees
and whole respiratory tract.
â¢ The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished. in old chronic cases of
Catarrh are little phort of remarkable,
and .the advantage of knowing: what you
are putting Into your stomach Is of para-
mount importance when it is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using secret catarrh remedies.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval from physicians, because
their antiseptic character renders them
perfectly safe for the general public to
use and their composition makes tbem a
common-sense cure for all forms of ca-
tarrhal troubles.
All druggists sell tbem at 50 cents for
full sized packages. .
To Know. What You Are. Taking
IT IS IMPORTANT.

saw Ripley in the adjutant general's of
fice a few days preceding the assassina
tion. General Collier told Ripley, he had
no guns with which to equip the company
that Ripley had organized. Ripley said
he would buy Winchesters if he could not
get others. He saw Youtsey get the key
to the Secretary of State's office on Janu
ary 29. The prosecution then rested. Â¦ .
A motion for peremptory instructions for
acquittal on the evidence presented by
the commonwealth was overruled, and At
torney O'Neal then made the opening
statement for the defense. He said . that
he was convinced his client was innocent;
that he did not even know Caleb Powers,
Finley or Youtsey. He barely knew. Tay
lor and had only met him on two occa
sions just- prior to the assassination,. and
the proof showed no link connecting him
FRANKFORT, Ky., April 13.â In the

fied that he talked with Caleb Powers and
Charles Finley frequently In regard to the

so and that he would not be surprised if
Goebel should be killed.

O'Neal said both Governor Bradley and
Judge Yost were asked as to the point
Ripley was endeavoring to make when he
told of the conversation with Taylor in
which he used the words, "Goebel will be
killed." " Ripley saw â¢ Youtsey passing
about that time . and recognized him as
the man he' had seen coming out of Tay
lor's office on January 29. Ripley related
the whole conversation, but attached no
importance to. Taylor's statement. The
court then adjourned until Monday.
Ripley. told him he thought these things
could be avoided, and inquired when he
should get his company ready. To this
Taylor said: . â¢
"My God, haven't* you got them ready*
yet?" ,
"This was all there was to this," said
Attorney O'Neal, "and no such construc
tion could rightfully be put on it as has
been done in this trial."
"Oh, my God, Ripley, these are terrible
times. Goebel will be killed. I wlll.be
killed and there will be a riot here. '
In explanation of the testimony of ex-
Governor Bradley and Judge Yost, O'Neal
said a mountain had been made of a mole

found the latler nervous and wringing

PERSONAL MENTION.
There is no room for sentiment in the. case. This, attempts ,upbn the courts and
the due administration of the law presents no extenuating circumstances.' These proceeding-s for
contempt ought not to stop with McKenzie, but should include "Judge" Noyes and the coterie of
lawyers who aided and abetted his outrageous conduct. It would seem to be highly proper for
these doctors of the law to take the consequences of the same medicine which they claim to have
administered to McKenzie. v. . - ;^ -^ : â¢ : V
There is no disposition on the.part of this community to treat any one with unnecessary
harshness, but there is. something extremely suspicious about the way in which this plea of sick
ness has been put in;, it looks like the last dodge of a shyster lawyer. There is no occasion to ap
peal to public opinion. The court, haying this matter in charge may te depended on to act justly.
It should not be forgotten that when McKenzie thought he was master of the situation at Nome
he was tyrannical and merciless toward those who stood in his way. Some of the most respon
sible and worthy citizens of this State were then threatened with the : loss of their property and
financial ruin; it was hinted that their '> attorneys : might be locked up in Nome where the wind
would blow upon them; an attempt- was made. in one instance -to put. this threat in force. â¢
AS a part of the unwritten history of the career of Alexander McKenzie at Nome it is
related that after he had made himself receiver of nearly all the valuable mines -in that
locality and had adjusted ; his plans to compel the owners to compromise and. surrender upon
his own terms, a good;- deal of consternation was created in his' camp by the action of the
Judges of the United States Circuit Court in granting appeals from the decisions of Judge Noyes
made in furtherance of this, scheme of McKenzie; that a meeting of the. gang took place at
which some of its members exhibited a lack of courage to fly in the face of the Circuit Court of
Appeals, whereupon McKenzie, after the manner of Satan when addressing his fallen archangels,
proceeded to exhort his followers to stand by their guns, telling them of: his past, experience \\ith
courts, conventions, Legislatures and the like, in which he had never met defeat; what influences
he had commanded; how railroad trains had been delayed' to further his purposes; through what
means the appointments for Alaska had been procured;- the political power which was behind
him, and his ability, through all these means, to carry them t 0 final success;, that the band was in
spired by this harangue' to continue the fight, Judge Noyes even going so far as to attempt, to
thwart the process of the higher court by making orders in, his own court after he had lost juris
diction on account of the appeals. '. (
As soon as McKenzie was arrested his attorneys rushed to the, Supreme Court of the tJnited
States for relief, only to meet defeat: ; Then an effort was made through the press to defame the
attorneys and their clients who were engaged in bringing him to justice. Perhaps the most' de
testable feature of his* defense was the attempt of one of his attorneys to clear' him by testifying
that McKenzie acted under legal advice when he disobeyed the orders of the court. At length the
hand of justice was laid upon this offender and he was ' relegated to the jail of Alameda
County. As the last act in this drama, an .effort is now being made to procure a pardon of this
culprit by the President of the United States, and as a preliminary, step to. this move his, organ in
this city has put out a pathetic article upon his physical condition. The health of McKenzie has
become deplorable, his friends say, from the confinement of a few weeks. . ; ;

In response to a reauest made through^
these columns for organ recital pro
grammes I have recerved a varied and
curious collection, but none of the
organ recital proper. It is not the
usual church programme that is desired â
that finding place in other department*
than this â but programmes in which the
musical rather than tne rellsrious interest
predominates. This, cf course, does not
preclude the announcement of a new or
gan classic â a Widor symphony or Gull -
mant sonata, for example, even in con
nection with the regular church pro
gramme, but it 13 the affair of Interest
to the org-an-lover In particular of which
Information Is desired.
Those programmes that I have received
contain, on the whole, a brilliantly unin
teresting repertoire. From banal arrange
ments of . "Cavallerla Rustlcana" anil
"Robin Hood" to the cheap religious fer
vors of Leybach, Bachman. Durand and
company, together with a sorry list of
cheerful experiments v.Don the instrument
by a host of incompetent unknowns, tho
said programmes form but sad reading.
This condition of things accords entire
ly too well with a declaration made lha
other day by one of the most prominent
organists here that "the best literature
of the instrument remains practically a
dead letter to the average organist In San
Francisco."
I find no Bach on the programmes;
neither Handel, Wldar, Best. Salome,
Franck, Gigout, Gullmant, Salnt-Saens.
Harwood, Stainer and all the rare list
that is available. Mendelssohn, Mozart,
Dubois and Capocci are scattered sparsely
over the programmes and altogether they
are distinctly discouraging reading.
. Of course the Western nations have the po\yer to do as they please. They can substitute
cruelty for kindness, inhumanity for humanity, dishonor for honor, if they choose,. and make any
thing stick by pinning it with bayonets.' But if they do, let them cast off the mask' of Christianity
and justice and stand forth as naked barbarians, with no better rule than the old law of an eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth. . .
Even small governments like Holland and Belgium are marching in the wake of the larger,
and though their losses were hardly: appreciable, are demanding enormous sums" to replenish their
little exchequers and enrich their individual subjects.
China is on fire and the mob rushes in to get drunk on stolen wine and to carry off all that
it can steal.
Â¦; .- ' Those who are the true custodians of the Christian idea should be warned by the spec
tacle, that if the policy of military murder, outrage and lust shall. extend into the solemn official
settlement with China, it is the death knell of all the Western pretensions to Christianity.
' As the. white settlement extended westward' in this country the pioneers found the name
of William Penn known. and revered. among the wild Indian tribes who had never- seen a -white
man. Perm's exhibition of justice and humanity in dealing with the Indians in his province had
long survived him and had become familiar to the, Indians everywhere. The Sacs, . Winnebagoes,
Pottawattamies, Sioux, Crows and Blackfeet, all knew of Penn. His example was the still small
voice which in all ages has appealed -to the heart 'of man, no matter under what colored skin
it beat. : - \' ':â¢ .';, v?,:";;''';/ .V-t'v 'Â¦:.,/ .','.Â¦.;';' ; . â¢.Â¦Â¦'/. Â¦:'Â¦"-'/",';.'Â¦
Is it not plain that cniel mastery* of China now, on top of the horrifying blood. atonement
that has been exacted of the innocent, will negative all : Christian professions ". in the lands we still
call heathen? '" . . . ' , .:
Is it not also plain that at the same time there is danger that the enlightened conscience' of
the Christian nations will more and more reject the professions that pretend an origin in the
simple, beautiful and humane precepts of Christianity?
On top of all this to demand an enormous indemnity> will enslave a. poverty smitten
people for generations to come, is to pile up an exhibition of revenge and oppression of which his
tory has heretofore; happily, bten barren.
_The reasonable people of the United States are in cordial sympathy with every move of our
administration to infuse the Chinese settlement with the principles of humanity and justice. It
does not require a merely Christian sentiment to demand a reasonable and equitable settlement
with China.
The ethical sense of the people sees as plainly the necessity for it. The only way to deal
with China is precisely the way in which a Christian nation would 4 expect to be dealt, with
under the same circumstances. In one riot' in this country, that in the coal mines of Wyoming,
the Chinese murdered numbered more than half of the whites killed in China by the Boxers.
Those Chinese were burned to death in their cabins." It requires only the most rudimentary sense
of justice to see that, if China is to pay the Christian nations three hundred millions, she should
have exacted half that sum for the murder of her people on American soil.' But she did not. She
did not exact anything and took just what this Government chose to offer, which was not as
many hundred thousands as the Christian nations want in millions from her. â¢."....''
Our State Department has received from China an official statement of what the allied
armies have inflicted upon China that is so horrifying that it will not be made public. It is not
from Chinese sources, but it more than justifies the statements of Sir Robert Hart and Dr. Dillon
and of the Japanese press. * . ...*./
WITH the cooling of passion and better information as to the facts, the public sen
timent of the Western nations is changing on* the subject of the Chinese in
demnity. .
It is now known positively .that in the Boxer revolution the lives of 242 'Europeans and
Americans were sacrificed. It is known, too, that the lives of more than ten times that number of
innocent Chinese have been taken by the Christian troops, and that to this must be added the ap
palling and unspeakable" crimes against Chinese, which throw into, the shade^the cruelties of all the
barbarous armies that ever marched. . -. -
Then, too, the theft of Chinese property runs far into the millions, and the most fruitful
provinces of the empire have been laid waste and their people are by thousands perishing
oi iaminc . - . .
Tet with .all Its depth and range the
Shakespearean tragedy lacks one concep
tion, which gives an added and a poignant
Interest to modern tragedy â the concep
tion that society, as we find it to-day, is
an organism of Inconceivably slow
growth. In the evolution of which fate,
force, nature, the unknownâ whatever you
choose to call Itâ pays little or no atten
tion to the salvation of the unit, but ruth
lessly sacrifices him wherever necessary
to the preservation of the whole.
Are God and Nature then at Rtrif*
That Nature sends euch evil dreams;
Bo careful of the type Â»he seems.
Bo careless of the single life.
Sings Tennysonâ but not Shakespeare,
Â¦whose tragedy, like Carlyle's, Is the trag
edy of Individuals.
This thought may serve as the connect
ing link between the treatment of tragedy
by the Elizabethans and by modern writ
ers. Among the ancients Euripides, ac-
But destiny lies not only in the political
or social environment; destiny is also
character, and character Is destiny be
cause the greater part of it is inherited
and Is therefore Inevitable. Hence the
tragedy of weak will ("Hamlet"), of vault
ing ambition ("Macbetn"), of overweening
self -confidence ("Coriolanus"), of wild and
passionate love ("Romeo and Juliet").
"With this intensely practical gaze
Shakespeare looked out upon the life of
his day and saw some of its bravest and
brightest spirits â Marlowe, Greene, Kyd,
PeelÂ© â dashing themselves to death
against the stone wall of that environ
ment whose composition he understood so
well. Here are all the subjects for trag
edy; in his portraits of the English Kings,
then, he shows you how the weak crim
inal or the strong criminal or the weak
good man or the merely sentimental man
falls, and falls tragically, to adjust him
iself to his surroundings, to the facts and
laws of life as they press upon him, to
destiny.
The Shakespearian tragedy we find sur
charged with two distinct elementsâ the
Gothic Â£i>irit and the spirit of positive
realism. The first phrase almost defines
Itselfâ or. If It need Illustration, it may be
dismissed by Baying that Shakespeare is
to Sophocles as the Cologne Cathedral is
to the Parthenon. The "spirit of positive
realism"? That means that Shakespeare,
being a child of the Renaissance, rejected
the authority, the tradition of medieval
ismâ"swallowed all formulas," as Carlyle
would sayâ and based his plays upon the
facts of life as he saw them for himself,
not as they were seen for him by some
learned doctor of the thirteenth century
or by some Patristic theologian of the
third. To this he was compelled â and for
this let us give thanks â by the prac
ticality of his intelligence; a prac
ticality that restrained his Idealism from
running riot as did the idealism of Shel
ley; a practicality so positive â that while,
with Othello, he 'was hurtling to ship
wreck magnificent on the rocks of
jealousy, while with Lear Jie was troub
ling vain heaven with bootless lamenta
tions o'er benefits forgot, he was at the
same time bringing suit in the Justice's
Court of the town of Stratford to recover
from one Philip Rodgers the sum of 1
pound 15 shillings and 10 pence.
The author's treatment of the first topic
contains nothing unfamiliar to those 'who
Jiave even a moderate acquaintance with
the literature of the subject. His Eum
mary of the elements that enter Into the
tragic Idea Is, however, neatly turned and
may serve to correct some popular errors
on the subject: "(Tragedy) Is born of
popular pessimism and melancholy. In
the next place. It finds artistic voice when
the peovla become conscious of them
selves and of an exalted, natural task.
In the third place, If we analyze it, trag
edy is always the clash of two powersâ
necessity without and freedom within;
outside, at great, rigid, arbitrary law of
fate; Inside, the undefeated individual
â¢will, which can win its spiritual triumph
even when all its material surroundings
auad environment have crumbled into hope-
Jess' rain." â¢ â¢ â¢ In Interpreting the

freshing contrast to the arid pedantry of
â¢many who have tried to read into Aris
totle tSie results of their own cut-and
driefi theories of esthetics. The "pur
gation of such passions" (as pity and ter
ror) Burely means, as Dr. Johnson, with
â¢wholesome directness, pointed out, that
these passions were, considered by
Aristotle to be sources of weakness and
Impurity In the body ethical, which must
be expelled If that body Is to remain
he*2tiiy. That this view of tragedy is nar
jTCW and Incomplete proves nothing
agulnst the explanation; it proves only
that Aristotle made as bad a blunder in
this esthetic diagnosis as he did in that
anatomical diagnosis wherein he declared
that 'women have less teeth than men and
that every man has an empty space in the
back of his head. (He should have said
some men.)
WL COURTNEY has collected
come lectures recently deliv
ered by him at the Royal In
stitution and has pub
â¢ llshed them (Brentano) under
the title of "The Ideal of Tragedy In An
cient and Modern Drama." The first lec
ture deals with tragedy among the
Greeks; the second with tragedy in
Shakespeare; the third (and most valu
able) with tragedy In 6uch modern writ
ers as Ibsen and Plnero.
Mr. Courtney, I believe, is the editor of
a prominent English review. I wonder if
he would allow a contributor to point such
a vulgarism as this (page 9), "In Maeter
linck's dramas YOU HAVE GOT this
strain," or such an absurd locution as
"Feminine Frailty" (page 71), or such a
solecism* as "quite other characters and
dramas FROM THOSE with which we are
at present conversant"? Such things
might be excused to a poor re
porter, writing on space and in a hurry
while the make-up man waits, but to an,
editor! And In a deliberately printed
book! Noblesse oblige! For the honor of
our craft. Mr. Courtney, I pray you get
some onÂ© to revise you before you print
again, lest a less kind reviewer fall upon
you and rend you' tooth and nalL
Mr. Courtney has high hopes for the
future of English tragedy, for he seems
to think that his countrymen are "living
at present under a wave of indignant emo
tion, which is sweeping away class dis
tinctions, destroying the false notion that
wealth is a form of nobility," etc. There
is nothing in the recent actions of the
English people to Justify this hope to a
foreign observer; moreover, the late la
mented Grant Allen, a better trained soci
ologist than Mr. Courtney, and, I fear, a
better writer, too, holds a very different
opinion. In an article published in this
month's Cosmopolitan (page 662) he says:
"The average British middle class- is the
most debased, materialized and soulless
bourgeoisie In the entire world. Of art,
of literature, of poetry, of thought, of
philosophy, of movement, it knows and
cares nothing. A baronet is more to it
than Herbert Spencer or George Mere
dith. â¢ â¢ â¢ Of the real betterness of life
they are as innocent as a Central African
negro." â¢ â¢ â¢ That doesn't look as if
the "wave of indignant emotion" will
sweep very fax up the beach of Stupidity
during this century, does it?
Were such a pessimism universal there
could be little or no art work produced in
this age. But there isâ to use a paradoxâ
a better pessimism than this; a pessimism
â¢which recognizes, indeed, that the strug
gle for existence, the survival of the'fit
test and development by unlimited com
petition are laws harsh, cruel and. repug
nant to the moral sense; which recognizes
that majorities generally prove their di
vine rlght t to govern by governing wrong,
and that â¢ this -world is and always has
been alike the paradise of commonplaces
and the purgatory of ideals; which recog
nizes all this, yet upon, the very back
ground furnished by this dark misery
paints the figures of human beings strug
gling toward better things, "transfigured
and ennobled by contrast." This, is the
idea of modern tragedy; the artist who
puts this conflict upon the mimic stage is
but condensing and idealizing the noblest
doings in the history of our race in its
slow and painful efforts to better dull and
cruel nature. He finds his reward In the
Joy and eympathy with which we con
template his workâ for we do get a sur
plus of pleasure from witnessing a trag
edy, as Hume has admirably demon-
Mr. Courtney closes his third lecture
with some timely and sensible criticism
of Ibsen, thereby filling in a distressing
gap in the dramatic philosophy of our ac
complished friends, Archer and Shaw,
who eeem to lose their heads and become
incapable of anything but indiscriminate
eulogy Â¦whenever the Norwegian Skald is
mentioned. Now, Ibsen's treatment of the
woman question is novel only to those
personsâ apparently including himselfâ
who are not well read in the French
drama; there is hardly a topic of this kind
treated by him which has not been treat
ed and better treated by Dumas pere or
Dumas flls or Angier. As to construction
and technical knowledge of stage effects,
these French writers have nothing to
learn from Ibsen, while, on the contrary,
he has much to learn from them. "Fran
cillon" is a better play in every way than
"A Doll's House," "Diane de Lys" than
"Hedder Gabbler" and "Le Gendre de
M. Foirier" than the "Master Builder."
His Incoherence, his confusion of thought
and his provincialism have already been
pointed out by Nordau and are indeed
patent to any one who does not, like Ib
sen himself, mistake his own awakening
to the large facts of life for a first dis
covery of the facts themselves.
cording to Mr. Courtney, is the nearest
akin to the moderns. Like them, he lived
in an age when the human Intelligence,
actively applying itself to the inspection
of antique dogmas in politics, in religion.
In ethics, and finding that convention and
not reason supports many of these dog
mas, knocks away the tottering supports
with sharp blows of the rationalistic ham
mer; down-tumbling comes the super
structure of the temple of Glgism, and the
iconoclast finds himself sitting, a little be
wildered, gazirg through its broken
arches at dreary vistas of- pessimism.
Adown the darkest of these vistas he de
scries the stooping figure of Schopen
hauei; by his side walks Thomas Hardy
reading to the master from "Jude, the
Obscure" â a perfect specimen of an art
work produced on the theory, that de
spairs of human virtue and declares the
will to live to be the great primal cause
of humanity. Such a" work, as Mr. Court
ney justly^ points out, depresses vitality;
it therefore Bins against humanity and is,
in the only true sense of the word, thor
oughly immoral.
The current number of the . Musical
Courier contains some admirable photo
graphs ef the "state" funeral of Verdi.
at Milan, February 27. It was the desire
of the great Italian maestro that his body
should be burled with utmost simplicity
of ceremony, according to his will: "In
the early j morning or at evening after
sunset, accompanied only by a priest and
two candle-bearerst" The first funeral
was thus carried out, but the people of
Italy claimed the privilege of showing
their love for the honored dead, and a
month after the first ceremony the body
of Verdi was conveyed with almost royal
pomp to the common cemetery at the
Home for Aged Musicians, given by the
master himself to his poor brethren.
The body of his wife, Guiseppina Strep-
Having a rudimentary sense of Justice,
and a consciousness of handwriting of my
own, it is not my usual fashion to rail at
the ingenious typesetter for" sins of ex
pression occasionally, committed in my
name. But, as in last Sunday's Call, when
I am made to evolve a "quadrangular"
encore; to outrage all precedent in drag
ging to light a "sleepless" organ-blower;
and to attribute to an apocryphal
"Thorne" the authorship of Thome's
"Simple Aveu" I must plead "not guilty."
And, by the 1 way, a very amusing typo
graphical error has gone the .rounds of
the papers this week, its starting point
one of the programmes of the industrial
and allied arts exhibition. In this the
clever Italian who composed "La Giocon
da" is" billed as "Punchinelli!" "Pon
chielli" having evidently appealed to the
god who ordains our etymology as a cor
rupt and vicious form of the classic Jest
er's honorable name.
I sincerely regret to announce that thj
Ffrangcon-Davies engagement at the
California Theater is off. Mr. Davies will
not . now come to the coast during h*3
present American tour, which means' that
it will be many years before we shall have
an opportunity to hear the famous Welsh
man, as he will not visit America again
for a considerable period. It is a matter
of financial guarantee. The singer would
not consent to take the risk of the long
journey from the East to this city with
out a substantial guarantee. The fund
required was in actual existenceâ on paper
âat the time Mr. Ffrangcon-Davles' visit
to; the coast was announced as a certain
ty, but the guarantors, with a laissez
faire peculiar to the climate, neglected to
make good their promises of subscription,
and the fortunate moment was gone.
The singer could not await the* careless
pleasure of the laggard subscriber and is
W delighting the less indolent music
lover of the East with a genius for song
that has aroused an admiration that is
almost . worship.' It is to be hoped that
like our old friend Hans, we shall "do
better next time."

The foregoing very good programme
will be played by Mrs. Madeleine Peck
Taylor, at a recital to be given in Hearst
Hall, Berkeley, next. Thursday afternoon.
The affair is in the hands of Mrs. Benja
min Ide Wheeler, who has invited the
students and faculty of the university to
attend the recital. Admission may also
be obtained by cards, that may be had
at the co-operative store to-morrow morn
ing from 10 to 12:30, and from 2 to 4 in the
afternoon.
Mrs, Taylor Is the wife of Dr. A. E.
Taylor, professor of pathology at the uni
versity, and is a Barth and Moszkowski
student, and also a graduate of the Royal
Conservatory of Dresden.
The programme was varied and worthy,
and in particular the admirable singiig
of the Bruch aria from "Achilleus." by
Mrs. Gustavus Arnold, may be com
mended. She has a voice of excellent
quality, a sympathetic method and an ad
mirable school. Mrs. J. -B.' Casserly's
harp solos were also - much enjoyed, as
were Miss Ames' solos on the 'cello. Don
ald de V. Graham was well heard and
L. Van Linghem's serviceable basa was
enjoyed in the Brahms and D'Hardelot
numbers. In the â¢Lehmann song cycle.
Mrs. B. G. Lathrop showed a very pure
and pleasing high soprano voice, and
Miss Burgin a powerful contralto. Miss
Hulda Anderson at the piano, B.. G. Lath
rop with hiÂ« violin, B. G. Somera (viola)
and Miss Ames were pleasantly heard in
a Schumann quartet, and Vail Bakewell
substituted for Edgar Mills.
THE affairs of the week musical
have been mostly of the charity
kind, and criticism Is therefore de
barred Its usual privileges. There
was little but good, however, to
report' of the charity concert held at thu
Hopkins Institute on Tuesday evening,
save of the newly discovered acoustic
sins of the Mary Searles gallery. "Wheth
er by reason of the absorbent draperies of
the dressing-rooms on either side of the
platform, or because of the lowness of
the roof of the gallery, the music had a
dulled unsonorous sound, that could cer
tainly not be laid at the artists* door.
But it is a charming hall otherwise for
such affairs, the gracious proportions anil
pictured walls adding: largely to the plead
ing effect.

WIN THE FIGHT
FOR MORE WAGES
New Jersey Central Railroad
Grants the Demands
of Employes.
Threatened Strike Will Not Be Or
dered, but the Telegraphers !
Will Have to Await a
Settlement.'
NEW YORK. Aoril .13.â It' was an
nounced by officials of the Central Rail
road of New Jersey to-night that the com
pany had come to an agreement with its
engineers and firemen. â¢
The conference which brought about this
result was held between representatives
of employes of the road and General Su
perintendent Olhauson and Division Su
perintendent Wentz. The wages of the
engineers and firemen were increased, but
the telegraphers and train hands did not
fare so well. The telegraphers were told
that they will be treated cs liberally as
their fellow-workers in the employ of
other roads and the train hands are to
have another conference.
After the conference llmothy Shea, rep
resentative of the firemen In Jersey Citv,
announced that there would be no strike
on the JerseyN Central road. He said that
had been definitely decided UDon. The
company had made concessions to the men
and had granted to the engineers and fire
men the 100 miles a day limit which they
had demanded. Shea said that the de
mands of tho telegraphers had been
dropped for the present.
Â¦The telegraphers were to continue at
work at the same rate as before until they
could bring evidence to convince the com
pany that they were not paid as much as
the telegraphers on other roads. This they
have so far been unable to do. The de
mands of the trainmen; it was further
stated, would also remain in abeyance
for three months. At that time the ques
tion of their wages mlfiht again be con
sidered by the railroad officials.
SCANDAL OVER
CAPITOL WORK
Montana's State Building
Said to Be Poorly Con
' structed.
Architect Donohoe Inspects the Costly
Structure at Helena and Makes
Charges Against the Con
tractors.
BUTTE, Mont. April 13.â P. J. Donohoe,
the architect who constructed thÂ© Carson
City prizefight arena and was broueht
prominently before the California public
about four years ago by his expose of the
new ferry depot scandal at San Francisco,
has turned his hand to iconoclastic work
in Montana after a fashion which Is likely
to cause a pronounced flurry In official
circles.
Last January certain State officials sent
a communication to the architect at Bill
ings, where he resides, and asked him to
investigate tho work on the new Capitol
building at Helena, which has been in
process of construction since September,
1898. For more than two months Dono
hoe has watched proceedings, making his
last trip to Helena in connection with thÂ©
affair last Thursday evening. He returned
to Butte this morning and immediately
prepared a report, embodying in general
terms the result of his investigations,
which was mailed to thÂ© Acting- Gov
ernor, Frank G. Higgins, this evening.
Many irregularities are pointed out, which
will probably call for prompt action on the
part of tha proper authorities.
Donohoe draws attention to thÂ© fact
that while thÂ© original plans and speci
fications should have been filed on Sep
tember 14, 1898, the date the contract was
drawn up, no original plans have been
filed at all, and even the blue prints in
possession of the Montana Capitol Com
mission were not filed until he requested
the secretary of the commission to rem
edy what Is termed an oversight. It is
stated that even as it Is. thÂ© building is
not being 1 constructed according to the
blue prints.
The building is declared to be weak in
its construction and to deviate, from the
plans and specifications so much that
hardly a provision of the contract is in
force at the present time. It is asserted
that the architects, Bell & Kent, have
been extravagant in making estimates for
contractors and attention is drawn to the
fact that while tho contract price of the
Capitol is $289,891, there Is due to the con
tractors on completion only $70,425 24,
though 40 per cent of the work is yet to
be finished.
In testing the flreprooflng for floors,
Donohoe encountered only sand and
cement. This work cannot now be rem
edied. Specifications for mixing are rep
resented as not having been compiled
with, the method being In favor of the
contractor to. the detriment of the con
tract, while the material, he says, has not
been spread and tamped, but distributed
In a very careless manner. The sewers
and soil pipes in the basement were found
to b^ out of place and to lessen the height
of thÂ© story, as called for In the plans, by
reason of the fact that the excavations do
not extend below the grade line.
In conclusion Architect Donohoe gives
it as his opinion that the matter calls for
a domplete and untrammeled Investigation
at an early date. Governor Toole Is at
present in the East and it is unlikely that
any action in the matter will be taken un
til he returns.

. HAVANA, April IS.â At the opening of
to-day's secret session of the constitu
tional convention Senor Nunez asked that
the convention either reject or accept. the
Platt amendment, as the resolution adopt
ed yesterday was not a formal declaration
and was misleading. The conservatives
considered that the resolution practically
rejected the amendment, while the rad
icals and the radical press maintained
that It did not, and Senor Nunez there
fore asked that a yea and nay vote be
taken. This was opposed by the radicals,
who have always avoided taking a de
cided stand. The conservatives were
pleased at the point and as a split was
threatened among the radicals a com
promise was offered and agreed to, by the
terms of which a resolution was adopted
that the convention should not express
itself either for or against the amend
ment and that a commission be sent to
Washington to secure the best possible
agreement with the President. This com
mission will not be authorized to settle
definitely the question of the relations be
tween tne United States and Cuba, but
will report back to the convention.
WRECKING OF CHURCH
DONE BY . A FACTION
Arrests May Be Made as Result of
the Explosion of Dynamite
in Ingalls.
STILL WATER, O. T., April 13.â Arrests
are expected to follow an Investigation
now being made into the wrecking by
dynamite of the new Christian church at
Ingalls. It is alleged that the explosive
was placed under the structure by mem
bers of a warring faction in the church.
No one was injured in the explosion.
The church membership has been split
for two years over the Introduction of
an organ and sectarian literature into the
Sunday-school. The older members be
lieved that organ ' music was not proper
for a house of God and fought still
stronger the idea of going outside the
Bible to teach the children, both of which
propositions were favored by the younger
members. The younger -faction of the
church finally built a church of their own
and they lay the destruction of the struct
ure to some of the older members.

" The Williams OH Company has been in
corporated by the following: J. W. Brim,
K. H. Herron, G. A. Wiiie, A. Schaad, G.
C. Comstock, J. W. Stovall and J. ,F.
Fouch. i All live in Wiliovrs with the ex

At the present time they have orders at the
Er-op to build 100 steel tank cars, fifty of which
will have a carrying; capacity of 8500 gallons
and the other fifty will be of 13,000 gallons
capacity, but as the manufacture of these
will take a year's steady work . they are
obliged., to build, the wooden tanks to meet
present demands. The wooden tanks will have
a carrying capacity of 7000 gallons and can be
pot ready rapidly.
Concerting the additional facilities that
the Southern Pacific Company is provid
ing for the transportation of oil the Sac
ramento Record-Union says:
The Hollister Bee gives the following in
formation: The Hollister Petroleum De
velopment Company is down 170 feet. The
San Juan- Company, near San Juan, has
begun the construction of a derrick. Non
pareil rig No. 3 has drilled over 300 feet;
the drill of the San Benito Company has
reached a depth of 1050 feet. Two oil com
panies are organized to work on territory
leased from the American Mutual Oil Min

Tho Mining Review of Salt L<ako says it
is firmly believed that oil and gas. exist
in paying quantities In the vicinity of
Green River, Utah. Indications have been
found four miles south from the Green
River station on the Rio Grande Western
Railway. Oil comes to the surface over
ah area fifteen miles long. Oil shows at
the junction of the Grand and Green
rivers. A Pennsylvania expert has ex
pressed the opinion that oil can be found
at a depth not exceeding 1500 feet. Pros
pectors have encountered a strong flow of
gas when drilling shallow wells only fifty
feet deep. Seepages of oil are found on
the surface in several places.
There Is much activity in petroleum
claims in Shasta County, according to the
Redding Searchlight. It says:
Activity in Shasta County.
J. H. Conway writes from Santa Maria
that the prospects of the northern end. of
Santa Barbara County In the matter, of
oil have brightened very much and cap
italists are looking over the ground, hav
ine investment in view. The fact that
there is oil ha3 been demonstrated by the
Western Union Company. Although the
earthquake of two weeks ago caused the
lower part of this company's well to col
lapse, that did not stop the oil from ris
ing over 800 feet In a 5%-lnch casing. Two
more rigs are being placed. The Cas
malia Oil and Development Company has
just set up a heavy standard rig on Its
first well that had to be stopped at 850
feet on account. of the boiler giving out.
The Elizabeth Oil Company is down about
900 feet and is in a small seepage. The
Santa Maria Oil and Gas Company Is put
ting in a water plant. The drill is in blue
clay. The Commercial Union Company,
In the Foxen Canyon, is' in a bitumdnized
Bhale and small seepages. Tne Pnrnavera
Company, on the Underhiil ranch, after
passing through a 40-foot stratum of oil
sand, nas concluded to move its rig one
hundred yards east from the lirst location.
The Graciosa Oil Company, owned by
Crocker, Treadwell, Hartness and others,
is just moving its lirst rig in on the Har
ris ranch. , The Jerome Oil Company of
Arizcna Is erecting a rig In the Shuman
Canyon. John A. H. Bunting has com
pleted his boarding and lodging houses on
the Moretti ranch and will have a rig in
operation soon. Two additional rigs will
be put up In Koxen Canyon. "This sec
tion," writes Mr. Conway, "is Independent
of railway rates, for there are half a
dozen landings on the west end of the
field upon the Pacific Ocean. The first
Bale of oil was made this week by the
\\ estern Union Company, which is com
posed of Hell man and others of Los An
geles. It la hoped there will be two ad
ditional producing wells by the end of the
month. Out of ten companies in the dis
trict, eight have no stock for sale. The
people of the section are looking for an
other Bakersfield rush without wildcat
advertising, that has done so much injus
tice to many prospective oil fields in thÂ©
State."

that the volume of business will steadily
grow. There have been several notewor

feature of the present month has been
the discovery by the Southern Pacific

line that greater accommodations are im
peratively demanded to move the large
passenger business offered. At the same
time the hotels are filled and flats and
lodging-houses are proving to be profit

affair, was held in the marble room of the
Palace Hotel, and fully a -hundred guests
met around the festal board. Â¦
President James P. Booth presided and
was flanked by Mayor Phelan and D. M.
Delmas. Other notables of the Demo
cratic ' party occupied seats at the main
table, which was located at the eastern
end of the room. Flags and evergreens,
with pots of flowers on the tables, com
prised the decorations.
An excellent menu was provided and

After the solids had been disposed of, Miss

the effects of his policy upon present po
litical conditions. . ' - 1

FOR SEATTLE
Society turned out In full <â¢ force last
evening to attend "A Night in Munich,"
given in the Mechanics'- Pavilion Annex
by the board of managers of the Colum
bia Park Boys' Club Association in aid
of the institution.
The much/ discussed subject of younÂ»;
ladies dispensing liquid refreshments had
the effect of crowding the building to the
doors and it is safe to say that the con
cert halls of- the City â¢ of - Munich or of
any other continental city never saw
such a gathering as was present last
night at the improvised "bier halle" In
the Pavilion. '
The annex was tastefully decorated ir
ferns, flags and bunting and tables were
scattered around the hall. A stage was
erected along one side of the building, on
which the artists .appeared. Legends in
German stood forth from the walls, ex
horting all to remember that "he who
drinks not beer must drink lemonade," or
"he who drinks one beer will feel happy,
the second glass will make him call for
a third,'" and other well-known German
quotations.
Society matrons and their daughters, in
the good cause of helping the settleme.it
work of the bays' club, acted as hosts of
the evening. Ladies who figure promi
nently in the Blue Book were to be found
presiding at the lunch buffet or playini?
the roles of dainty waiting maids for the
thirsty guests. â¢ ~ *
Peasant Girls make a Hit.
The young ladies were dressed as peas
ant girls and caused a veritable sensation
as they flitted from table to table, carry-
Ing trays with "bocks," "steins" and
other liquid commodities. Prominent so
ciety men were dressed in the regulation
costume of German students and' the illu
sion was complete even to the "country
man" in blouse and wooden shoes.
Ope long table was occupied by the
"students" and they enacted their rol ;s
with remarkable effect. All the "stu
dents" Â¦wore white caps with red, white
and blue colors and sashes to correspond.
Foils, books, bocks and steins were on
the long table and the society waiting
maids were kept busy in catering to the
thirsty crowd. College songs were sung
with vim and the ladies who took part In
the "concert" were escorted to the Ion?
table, where the "students" drank their
health in appropriate manner. . .
Among the young ladies who wero
"waiting maids" at "The White Horja
Tavern" (Zum Weissen Roesslein) were:
Misses Elsie Frank, Louise Sussman, Olga
Epstein. Elsie Lilienthal, Alice Behlow,
Julia Eppingrer, Blanche Lewis, Alice
Greenbaum, B. Lilienthal, Jessica Peix
otto, I. Son, Florence Benjamin, Edith
Esberg, Mabel C. Schrler.
To Whom Success "Was Due.
Mrs. I. N. Walter, president of the boanl
of managers, was assisted by Mrs. John
F. Merrill, Mrs. Louise Greenwald," Mrs.
Albert Frank. Mrs. Dr. Julius Rosenstirn,

Mrs. J. Greenebaum, . Mrs. Will Green

Pyramid File Core Cozes Them So
33iey Stay Cured. v ~" .* "'
At least one-fourth of all mankind are
Afflicted to a greater or less degree with
stiles. -'- - : -
Very often the disease Is of Irregular
recurrence. Maybe the trouble comes only
once or twice a year. Even so. it unfits
a man for business while it lasts. Seema
like a little thing, but it produces more
bad feelings- than even serious sickness
-would. In severe cases tbeÂ£-e Is no com-
fort attainable. Various salves and oint-
ments afford temporary relief, but in a
few minutes the pain returns. Each at-
tack is a little bit worse than the last one.
Itching Is followed by bleeding and pro-
trusion. Fistula followsâ surgical treat-
mentâdeath possibly. And all this can be
avoided.
The discovery of Pyramid Pile Cure has
made suffering 1 unnecessary, even foolish.
By its use relief is instantaneous. It
eoothes the inflamed parts, heals the
broken membranes, reduces the swelling
and brings comfort at once.
The cure Is permanent and the trouble
Â¦will not return unless new conditions
arise, which produce an entirely new case.
This, of course, cannot be helped, but if
you will use Pyramid Cure immediately
on the appearance of the first symptom
the trouble will vanish. Â».
Entggists 6ell and recommend Pyramid
Pile Cure. There may be some who do not
have it, in which case you can get it your-
self from the makers, the Pyramid "Drug !

Attorney H. H. Lowenthal was arrested
on a warrant sworn to before Judge Fritz
yesterday, by . Mrs. Clara Knauer, charg
ing him with felony embezzlement. He is
accused of embezzling $180, which he re
ceived fer furniture sold by him on behalf
of Mrs. Knauer. Lowenthal alleges
that it is a case of blackmail. He repre
sented Mrs. Knauer in five or nix differ
ent suits in the civil and criminal courts
and says* his fees amounted to consider
ably more than the $480. He intended to
leave for Europe . yesterday to be treated
at-a famous sanitarium and that was why
the woman had him arrested. He was re

by the foreign Ministers In Peking, and In
case of their failure to agree, by thÂ»
Hague court. This plan has not been
definitely acted on or rejected. It Is not
believed, however, that It will be adopted
in its entirety. Great Britain and Japan
have indicated that they will support the
American proposal for a reduction of the
indemnity. â¢ .
There is reason to believe that the ker
nel of the American proposition, touching
the distribution of indemnity funds be
tween the powers, is found in a sugges
tion that the allotment be made upon the
basis of the number of troops actually
emplpyed by each power In the relief of
the legations. By this scheme the forces
brought Into China since the occupation
.of Peking are disregarded, as being en
tirely unnecessary to secure any lawful
and unanimously desired end. On this

CALL BUREAU, 1408 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. April 13.â Rockhill,
States Special Commissioner to
China, has sent the State Department a
revised statement of the claims thus far
filed by the powers against the Chinese
Government.' The aggregate of the claims
is lower than at first reported, being un
der $400,000,000, but the authorities regard
this as exorbitant and will endeavor to
cut it: In half. RockhlU's information
shows that the claims of I he powers to
date are about the figures given below:
Russia, $90,000,000; Germany. $70,000,000;
France, $40,000,000; Japan, $30,000,000; United
States. $25,000,000; Great Britain, $24,000,000;
Belgium, $5,790,000; Italy. Austria and
Spain, $30,000.0%: grand total, $314,790,000.
Some of the powers have not Itemized
their claims, and Â¦ Rockhill's figuies are
Rockhill has cabled to the department
that the Ministers will consider next week
the question of reducing indemnities.l They
were expected to pass to-day upon the
plan of the United tSates that the powers
determine upon a lump sum as the in
demnity to be demanded, which shall be
distributed equitably among the powers
only in the nature of rough estimates. It
would no,t be surprising, therefore, should
the claims amount to more than the total
stated. The Russian claim is as large as
given because of the Invasion of Russian
territory by Chinese 'roops and the de
struction of Russian homes and the mur
der of Russian subjects, the destruction
of railroad property in Manchuria and the
dispatch of so many troops into China.
France's claim is large because under the
treatv with China her protection of na
tive Christians is established. There are
30.000 Catholics who suffered death as a
result of the operations of the Boxers.

Dr. Gibbs summoned the police and they
were refused admission until Judge
Ernest Gary, a cousin of Evans, arrived
and demanded admission and submission
to the officers. Evans struck Judge Gary
and was taken to* jail in a state of
hysteria, having declared that Captain
Griffln had taken his own life. In the
room were evidences that one or both of
the men had been~ drinking. Aside from
this there is no known reason why Griffin
should have killed himself or that Evans
should have shot him. The dead man's
face was bruised on both eides and there
was an abrasion on the bridge of the nose.
His cane, clotted with blood, was several
feet from where blood marks indicated
that the fatal shot had taken effect. The
right forearm of the dead man showed
powder burns, but none was noticeable In
the neighborhood of the wounds.
Major Evans Is a son of Brigadier Gen
eral Evans of the Confederate army, and
Is a brother of former Governor John G.

COLUMBIA, S. C- April 13.â Captain
John J. Griffin, commercial agent of the
Norfolk and Western Railroad, was shot
to' death this afternoon in the rooms of
Major Barnard B. Evans in this city.: The
arrest of Major Evans subsequently cre
ated a pronounced sensation.
Â¦ The two were alone and .the occupants
of the adjoining apartments were at din
ner.- Major Evans summoned a physi
cian, saying 1 that a man was hurt In his
room. Dr. Gibbs found Captain Griffln in
a dying condition and speechless on Ma
jor Bvans 1 bed. A 44-caliber revolver bul
let had entered just above the left nipple.
When Dr. Gibbs announced Griffin was
dying he declares that Evan's, who had
been drinking heavily, became excited
and exclaimed that Dr. Gibbs lied; that
Dr. Gibbs and not he himself had killed
Griffln. The physician, under pretext of
replacing a broken instrument, managed,
to get out of tho room, although it is al
leged Evans declared that he should not
do so.

A cutting affray that resulted in the se
rious wounding of Dr. Craig and John
Driscoll, or Bristle, occurred last night
about midnight in front of the Eagle
Rcost saloon at 00 Third street. The doc
tor received a gash across the nose and
cheek and Driecoll had i.;s ear almost
severed from his head.
The row that led to the slashing started
In the lodging-house over the saloon, and
was caused by one of the trio arrested of
fering an insult to a woman residing in
the house.
The men left the place and were fol
lowed downstairs a few moments later by
Eh*. Crai?r. DriPcoll and another lodger.
Both crowds met in the saloon and blows
were exchanged. The men then went out
on the sidewalk and as Craig and his com
panion attempted to re-enter the lodging
house they were stabbed.
The men who did the cutting re-entered
the saloon to wash their hands and were
arrested there. A wicked-looking pair of
brass knuckles and a small penknife cov
ered with blood were found in the lava
tory used by the men. The names, of the
men arrested are Philip Hein, James

Maks a Reduction in Philippine

; . The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation, acting in conjunction with" the
Chamber of Commerce and other commer
cial bodies on the Pacific Coast, has draft
ed a resolution which is to be forwarded
to the Secretary of War, asking for a re
duction of the customs tariffs between, this
country and the Philippines. . :
- Under, the, existing schedule flour Is
taxed about 30 tier cent, and the mer
chants ask to have this materially, re
duced, as American flour is in great de
mand in the Philippines. Prepared cereals
for table use under the present tariff are
taxed almost 100 per cent, which renders
it almost impossible to ship them with
any profit to the islands.
A reduction in the rates on prunes and
crude petroleum. is also requested. In re
gard to the. former article, the resolution
states that prune raising is one of the
most important industries of this State
and that a considerable portion of last
year's crop remains unsold and that the
crop this year is expected to be very large,
and that therefore a market in the Orient
is very desirable. '

at 1&41 Broadway since Friday morning
and His relatives, who have been anxious

has happened. Whether the old gentle
man has wandered away or has been foul

Early on. Friday morning Snook evident
ly left his home before his family awoke.
When his son went to call him
he was gone from his room. For a year
past he has been alhnff and It. 1Â» feared
that with his advancing years his mind
has given way. The police have been no

Immediately after his arrival in this city
in 1S49 Mr. Snook started the firm or G.

business established In San Francisco.
From this early start grew a laree*busi
ness with several branches. With the
weight of advancing years and innrmitles
gathering upon him Mr. Snook withdrew
from active participation in business
pursuits turning his interests over to
those of the younger veneration.
Mr. Snook is now 76 vtars of age. He
wears a heavy gTay beard and aressÂ«s in

the governments of the United States and
Great Britain respecting quid pro quo U
Â¦be demanded by Great Britain in consid
eration of the release of the United States
from the restrictions imposed by the Clay

"It is not even possiMe to predict now
because the results obtained are so in
clusive that the -State Department will
not be able to acquaint Lord Pauncefoto
with the basis upon which it is willing
to negotiate for a treaty before the Em
bassador sails for London next June. It
is even possible that Lord Pauncefote may
feel it incumbent upon him to delay hU
departure for a time or even to omit his
leave altogether if by so doing he can
better ascertain the Senate's conditions

"Secretary Hay is devoting himself now
to the ascertainment of the feelings and
desires of the Senators and consequently
not having completed this ' work he has
not begun negotiations with Great Britain
for a new treaty. It is not an easy under
taking to test the Senate in this fashion
not only because of the number of Sen
ators who must be sounded, but also be
cause of the indccisioii of some of the moi
who rank as leader^!
"After the adjournment of the Senate
and the lapse of the pending Hay-Faunce
fote treaty Secretary Hay decided to pur
sue the subject further. But to avoid the
possibility of another failure for the same
reason as brought about the loss of the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty the. Secretary de
termined to reverse the usual method of
procedure in framing treaties. He there
fore concluded to flm consult the ratify
ing power, the United States Senate, to
ascertain if it was possible for the Sen
ators to agree upon the basis of a treaty
which should be at the same time accept
able to the executive branch of the Gov
ernment and to Great Britain. It was
realized that unless two-thirds at least,
of the Senate could be brought Into agree
ment in advance upon the basis of tho
treaty it would be perfectly useless for
the executive to embark in negotiations
with Great Britain for the formation of
another convention.

ment of the condition of -the bank bears
date of February 5. According to this
statement the deposits then amounted to
an aggregate of about $466,000. The re

$16,000. It Is believed the statement was
Inaccurate In several items. The capital
of the bank i& $60,000 and Its surplus $6000.
Bank Examiner Frank I* Fish, during

it is impossible to state what loss, If any,

KEIXY SUPEBINTENDENT .
OF THE CITY ALMSHOUSE
Health' Board Appoints Him to Suc-
The Board of Health yesterday . ap
pointed W. J. Kelly to succeed the late
Captain Reddy as superintendent of the
City and County Almshouse. The" ap
pointment was made under' civil service
regulations for the rest of this month, as
Captain Reddy's last commission was for
a period of thirty days. It is certain that
Kelly will be continued in the position at
the end of that period. â¢ Â¦ .,
In . foretelling Kelly's appointment in
Saturday's Call it was Inadvertently
stated that he was a cousin of Mayor
Phelan. Neither Phelan nor Kelly, how
ever, acknowledge any relationship. Kelly
was Phelan's choice for the position and
the board gracefully acquiesced in his.
Honor's desire. .
Kelly was formerly clerk to Health Of
ficer O'Brien, In which position he made
many friends by his gentlemanly bearing
and strict attention to his duties. He has
just returned from a trip to Europe, hav
ing acted as Miss Phelan's business agent
while she was attempting to better her
impaired health. "While In Europe Kelly
made a particular study of almhouses and
their method of conduct and he is thor
oughly eqiupped to discharge the functions
of the head of such an Important Institu
tion. - â¢ ' . â¢
President : "Williamson of the : board ap
pointed- Drs. Baum and Buckley a com
mittee to draft resolutions of regret over
the death of Captain Reddy, who so ably
filled the duties of superintendent for
many years, past. ' . ; .
Emlle T. Drier, who Is said to be well
connected in Honolulu, Is wanted by the
police ' on a charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. Yesterday â¢ Harry Bren
nan of- the firm of Brennan & Kelly, pro
prietors of the Zinkand buffet, appeared
in Judge Cabaniss' court and swore to a
complaint charging Drier with defrauding
him out of $170 by bogus checks. Drier la
at present. in San Jose, and an officer will
be sent to that, city to-day to arrest him.
Several months ago Drier arrived In this
city from Honolulu and soon became &
familiar figure on the "cocktail route."
Glib of tongue and liberal with his money,
he made many friends, among whom were
several saloon-keepers. In a short time
Drier found, himself without funds, and to
replenish his purse he proceeded to give
worthless checks for various amounts,
ranging from $5 to $100. The checks were
drawn on the Crocker-Woolworth Bank,
â¢where Drier claimed he ' had a large
amount on deposit. Brennan cashed some
of these checks, but when he presented
them at the bank he learned that Drier
had no funds there. Drier was asked for
an explanation. He pretended that he did
not know that he had overdrawn his ac
count with the bank, and promised to
make, good the amounts as soon as he
could communicate with his father In
Honolulu, r - - " - .
Subsequently, .finding himself besieged
by the men whom he had duped. Drier,
evidently becoming alarmed, quietly re
turned to Honolulu. He came back about
ten days ago and at once boarded a train
for San Â«Jose.
Learning that Drier had returned his
victims waited patiently for him to ap
pear . and redeem his worthless checks.
They are still waiting. .Becoming exas
perated at Drier's failure to make good
the amount he had obtained from him,
Brennan yesterday swore out a warrant
for his arrest. Additional charges prob
ably will be placed against him.

\X salmon packers and the codflshers
are all going in for the latest im
provements, and as dispatch is a great
desideratum in the business steam is go
ing to replace muscle. In the old days' the
dories were rowed to the canneries with
the fish that had been taken. This meant
the loss of valuable time and many a load
of king: salmon was lost. while the fisher
men were away landing their catch. Now,
however, the tugs and launches will dance
attendance on the dories and as fast as
the lish are taken they Â¦ will be rushed
ashcre.
The fleet of small boats will consist of
about fifteen nine-knotters, some of wbich
will go up on the decks of sailing vessels,
some will be towed up and a few will go
up under their own steam. Those that
will be towed north and also those that
will go under their own steam will be
housed over from the bow to the pilot

Commission Claims It Has Lost Jur
. isdiction Over Deputies Only,
but Recorder Has a Con
trary Opinion.
t. . -''..'Â» ' ', " J
In accordance with his announcament
made last week, Recorder Godchaux yes
terday appointed four of his old copyists
who were displaced about a year ago by
civil. service ellgibles. They are Eli Lan
dry, William H. Garnett, Lawrence Bran
nan and Thomas J. Kelly, and it is prob
able that the Civil Service Commission
will take the matter to the courts to deter
mine whether the Supreme Court decision
exempts deputies only from the civil ser
vice provisions of the charter. ,
Recorder Godchaux is not paying much
attention' to the contention of the commis
sion that it has not lost control of his
copyists, but claims . that, under the Su
preme Court decision he has, the power to
appoint his own- copyists without asking:
permission from the commission. God
chaux says that he was shown no favors
when the commission forced twenty-one
civil service eligibles upon him last year,
and that he certainly intends to show no
favors to the commission. He was at that
time threatened with , removal by Mayor
Phelan, and rather than lose" his own po
sition was obliged- to sacrifice competent
copyists of his own selection. Godchaux
is now fortified by the fact that Auditor
Wells informed him that he would sign
the salary demands of the four new copy
ists after he had been officially notified of
their appointment. â¢ Â¦ â¢ -;
Commission Still Undecided.
The Civil Service Commission has as yet
not decided upon a plan of procedure to
determine the disputed point. Commis
sioner Quinn said yesterday that he did
not know what would be done. It appears
that the commission is waiting until God
chaux proceeds to remove one of the civil
service copyists employed- by him. Quinn
says that then the courts will be Invoked
to settle the jurisdiction Â¦Â¦ of the commis
sion over employes other than deputies in
county offices.* Â¦ '\* " ' ' \
The commission is supported in its con
tention that it still has â¢ Jursidlction over
all subordinates but deputies by- Mayor
Phelan, who holds that section 8% of the
constitution,, as ' interpreted by. the Su
preme Court recently, provides that a
charter may fix the ;number and compen
sation of the. Recorder's -â¢â¢ deputies, but
cannot fix their qualifications; that is to
say, they are exempted from civil service ,
examinations. , . â¢ : v Â¦ .-- !
"There Is no;mention, of, copyists in sec
tion &-A," says the Mayor, "and. by "no
construction can > copyists | bo considered
deputies. Now, where does the Recorder
get his authority to appoint copyists? The !
charter, which must be- ': regarded as a
law as well as the. general' law, provides
that the Recorder may appoint as many,
copyists as he may deem -necessary, who
shall receive S cents a- folio. It seems
clear, therefore/that the Recorder must
look to the charter for authority to em
ploy copyists, and as copyists are not dep
uties within the meaning of section 8% it
is competent for the charter to fix their
qualifications by. requiring them to be on
the civil service eligible list, and also their
compensation." j : Â¦ .Â¦%;Â¦.- . â¢
Mayor Doesn't See Necessity.
The Mayor cannot see why Godchaux is
increasing his force of copyists now that
he has introduced the book typewriting
machines, which reduce the labor by one
half. In answer to, this Godchaux states
that Â¦' the business of his office, has in
creased 40 per cent over that of last year,
which was the heaviest in the, history of
the office.' His copyists have all along en
tered from 1500 to 1800 folios per month,
and at 8 cents a folio would be entitled to
$120 to $144 per month. But the charter
prohibits the payr. ent of over $100 to each
copyist, so in justice to his copyists he
has increased their number by four.
Of the four -men appointed Eli Landry
was chief copyist when: displaced by a
civil service eligible. Landry' s penman
ship failed to satisfy the fastidious taste
of the commission and its board of exam
iners. Godchaux points to the fact that
of -the other three appointed Garnett Is
number 177 on the eligible list. Brannan.
number 117 and Kelly number 147, and this
he regards as a proof that he is not en
tirely Inimical to civil service. The men
are too far down on the list, however, to
be certified for appointment should requi
sition be made on the commission. .

Birth of Reynold.
"Our little boy Reynold was' born in Sep
tember, 1898, and it was due to his pres
ence in the household that I did not sepa
rate from my wife. She continued.
In her devious ways, however, and
time and acain I decided to leave
her. Owing to her failing health we came
to Denver in January last. We set up
housekeeping and I spent a great deal of
money fitting up our dwelling. Her con
duct with a prominent business man of
Denver, became so bad. that I decided to
leave her for all time. A week ago I pre
pared for a hurried trip. She was under
the impression that I was going" to New
York to* testify in a damage case and in
my farewell letter I told her that I was
go'ing there. Instead, I took my son and
came directly to San Francisco. Read
ing an advertisement in one of the papers
that a Mrs. Lage at 10S>4 Fell street would
care for a child, I took the. boy there. I
gave the name of "Wall." which was my
mother's maiden name. I took* this course
to prevent my wife following me and se
curing possession of the boy." ' ' \
Rivierre claims that i he did not tele
graph East to his wife's relatives for
money. . He said the money used by him
to come West was paid to him with the
understanding that he would use it in*go
ing to ICew York to testify in an accident
case. He says he , did not Inform his
wife's relatives that she was dead. . He
simply meant that she :. was dead in his
affections.- g - _Â¦â¢.-â¢â¢ '-;â¢Â¦Â¦-Â¦
"In 1886 I was in charge of a big station
ery store in Montclaire. While on a visit
to Brooklyn, N. Y., I met my wife and
after a short courtship we were married.
The ceremony was performed on March 9,
1896. When I married her I believed her
to be a good and pure woman. Imagine
my consternation when she came to me a
week after the ceremony and told me that
two years before she had been the victim
of an infamous plot, in which a drug was
used, and showed me a sixteen-months
old child, which.- she said, was hers. Be
lieving her story, I overlooked- the mat
ter and we took the child under our care.
The same year of our marriage I went on
a visit to France to see my parents and
while there was impressed Into military
service. After serving three months I
hurried to -America and upon my arrival
was given to understand ihat my wife's
parents believed I had deserted their
daughter. I disproved this assertion by
hunting her up. I found my wife living,
as she said, in a private family, and as I
was out of work, she remained there at
her own suggestion. Whenever I called
at the placer at which she was staying she
told me, the mistress of the house was out.
It then dawned upon me that my wife
was unfaithful and was leading a double
life. I discovered that she " had been
living with an architect named A.- L. For
rest and was not, as she claimed, living in
a private family. I decided to secure a
divorce,- but through bigness of heart. I
forgave here and we again lived together.

When taken before Captain Seymour
Rivierre told a straip-ht story. He un
bosomed himself and in his own defense
gave reasons why ne carried his boy
away. He thought he had done no wronjj
and was surprised when informed that it
would be necessary to hold him until word
was received from Denver. Captain Sey
mour showed him the telegram sent by
Chief of Police Hamilton Armstrong' of
Denver and Rivierre accepted his fato
with fairly good grace. . .
"I have been a victim of an unfortunate
alliance," said Rivierre. "My wife led a
double life and time and again I forcrave
her her shortcomings. Patience ceased to
be a \irtue and I could stand it no longer.

it my duty as a father to look after his

in a startled tone asked:
"Well! what's all the trouble?
Rivierre was given.a joyful greeting by
his little boy, who hugged and caressed

mour yesterday ordered his men to bxing

T.'hose presence in this city was made
kr.own to them through the columns of
The Call. Detectives Tom Gibson and
Coleman patiently waited for Rivierre to
ccme to the home of Mrs. Lage, 108*4 Fell
street, and when he arrived they took
him to police headquarters. Rivierre was
not formally charged, but will be kept in
custody until further information is ob
tained from Denver's Chief of Police.
The unwilling prisoner was greatly sur
prised when informed that he was
wanted by the police. Unfortunately
for him. he had not seen a, copy of
The Call and believed that he was safe.
When informed that lie was accused of
having kidnaped his child from its mother
and of committine other acts that were
illegal he consented to talk. He was
earnest in his defense. He told a Iopz
story to the arresting officers and to th9
Chief of Detectives and if credence can be
placed in what he savs he is innocent of
the charges made asrainst him.
Rivierre told a plausible story to his
detainers. He claims that his wife was
â¢unfit to care for his bov and knowing this
he had deliberately taken the little fellow
from beneath her roof and traveled to this
city. His expose was brought about oy
the innocent prattle of the boy. The chill
told Mrs. Lape, the motherly woman who
is caring for him. that his name was Rej
nold Rivierre. This statement, coupled
with the peculiar actions of the father,
aroused suspicion in her mind. Visions of
the Cudahy kidnaping case were recalled
to her and, believing tnat the child placed
tinder her roof was stolen, she hurried to
police headquarters and reported her sus
picions. The police procrastinated and It
devolved upon The Call to investigate the
case. The investigation was so completa

that the disorders had not resulted In loss

for the use of the street by the Salt Lake

CHESCEiUS IS HATCHED
TO RACE THE ABBOTT
THE Great Trial stakes, the richest
plum of the entire California rac
ing season, with a gross valuation
of $5375 attached, was captured by
Barney Schrelber's brown colt
Corrigan at Tanforan track yesterday. It
was a meritorious performance, for he
shouldered 125 pounds, and in the face of
an amateur gale came home before his
field, tripping off : the five furlongs In
1:00%'. Dominick again wore the Schreiber
colors, riding with his accustomed skill
and good Judgment.
"â¢'Â¦'. Corrigan'8 Win of tho Stake. '
It was a prize worth trying for, and
fourteen baby racers faced the barrier.
The betting favored the Jennings entries.
Sister Jeanie and Prestano, .which closed
at 5 to 2. Next came Corrigan and Bruns
wick, each quoted at 5 to 1. Long prices
were laid against the others. Brunswick,
with a sore mouth, acted crotchety and
cranky over at the post, and finally by
his demoniacal behavior â¢ practically
spoiled an otherwise nice start. Just sfter
Holtman had released the barrier Bruns
wick reared up in the air on his hind legs,
and in falling alighted, on Phyllis, throw
ing that fllly and interfering with two or
three of the others. Henry Shields then
pulled up the apparently crazed young
ster. For a time Nash Turner on Sister
Jeanie led the way, her reign lasting to
the stretch. Then Dominick, astride Cor
rigan, forged ahead, and with the others
all whipping looked to have an easy thing
of It. Nearing the wire, Flora Pomona
under Mounce's hard urging closed
strong and Dominick on â¢Corrigan was
brought to a drive, winning, all out, by a
scant half length. Pat Dunne's J. V.
Kirby fought it out gamely, finishing
third, while Sister Jeanie saved her en
trance.
Kenilworth All Out Again.
Almost as .much, if not more, interest
was displayed by the bip crowd present
over "the special," at six furlongs, with
Kenilworth and Articulate the only two
contenders. Each carried 117 pounds, and
the exceedingly liberal price of 7 to 10
could be had about Stover's "bird," with
13 to 10 against Articuiate. Dominick on
the latter out juggled Turner, getting
away two lengths in front. Kenilworth
simply blew along with the wind, and
passing the St. Andrew colt when a quar
ter had j b^en covered it looked over.
There, as! in his, previous races, Kenil
worth seemed to hang, and in a hard
drive, -apparently, got the verdict by a
short head only in 1:13%.
' Four other events were run off, all be
ing below mediocrity. Favorite players
had another squally session of It, as Satin
Coat and Kenilworth were the. only two
paying any returns.
:No pronounced choice was chalked up
in the betting en the opening five-furlong
scramble. After.Vantine, Glissando and
Tizona had raced themselves almost to a
standstill Gisborn brought Saintly up with
a rush, downing Tizona a head. Nullah
ran unplaced.
Almost to a man the smart onea banked
on Spike to annex the mile and a six
teenth purse, and Precursor rolled in
first. I Dominick rode the winner and had
the race in hand from the jump. Maydine,
a. 15 to 1 shot, led out Spike for the place.
.An upset marked the steeplechase event.
Hueston on the 15 to 1 shot Charles Le
Bel took the first event in front arid was
, never headed. Viking, a well backed one,
came in second, five lengths in advance of
Lord Chesterfield, which, with Periwig,
enjoyed the honors of favoritism."
; fHughes & Elliott, the Texas owners,
'captured the closing mile selling affnlr
.with Satin-Coat. The brown colt ruled art
even money chance and won easily trozn
Thornwild and Fondo.
Track Notes.
The judges decided to refuse the entry
of Brunswick in future.
Steeplechase Rider3 McMahon and Me-
Kenna were told by the officials to accept
no more mounts at Tanforan.
Gisborn formerly rode, for "Father
Bill' Daly on the Eastern tracks.
Since entering the pony class Nullah
seems to have lost her tpeed.
Spike was.one of the hottest things tho
talent ever tried to drive. ' . "
.Ransch is a trifle timid when mixed In
with a big bunch of two-year-olds. Do
reen showed to be a filly of some class by
her performance after getting away so
poorly.-
No doubt Kenilworth would have beat
en Articulate a head had the race been
at four miles. â¢â¢ ,
James T..Finlen, vice president of tha
Montana Jockey Club, was an interested
spectator of the racing. Mr. Finlen grows
enthusiastic when speaking of the com
ing Montana racing season, saying It will
be the greatest in* the history of that

Hcaley of the Petaluma High School ran
a good, heady race in the half-mile and
won easily in 2:0S.
Mile Hun a Pretty Hace.
The mile run was the prettiest race of
the day. Westdahl and Clough of Oakland
High and Weller of Ukiah came down the
stretch together on very equal terms.
Clough led, with Weller second and West
dahl third. "Midget" Westdaiil had more
sprint left in him. however, and he forged
ahead in the last five yards and breasted
the tape first. The Oakland' boys yelled
themselves hoarse and when "Rex"
Womble, who manipulated the mega
phone, announced . the record-breaking
time, they redoubled their demonstration.
The relay race was as usual Intensely
exciting. Berkeley High had a good
chance to win, as on the last relay Nel
pon. Its best runner, was close behind the
leader, . Whitman of Oakland High. On
the back stretch he stumbled and fell,
and, when he recovered, second place was
the best he could get. Hughes, Clough,
Norton, Sheehan, â¢ Howard and Whitman
composed Oakland's winning team in that
event.
ITkiah High School was crippled by the
loss of Thomson and Patton, both of
whom were taken ill Friday and were un
able to compete.
The contests were" witnessed by 1500 peo
ple. Including large delegations from, the
schools represented. The St. Matthew's

The handsome trophy for victory In th<j

home match ended yesterday in a victory
for the San Francisco team. 10 up, the city

down yesterday. Of the six representa

against their opponents and one tied, but
the three last men In the San Francisco
team lost fifteen holes, the Oaklanders be

SAN FRANCISCO.
This is how Jburg did not distinguish
himself. Brockhoff, Hutchlnson and
Householder were decorating the three
bags when Spies came to the plate. Some
one in the stand who wasn't wise said
that here was the place where Iburg
would settle, and woe to Spies. Spies saun
tered on four bad ones and Brockhoff
strolled home. Then Reilly hit to left,
Hutchinson and Householder crossing the
rubber, only to be followed by some poor
infleld work of Iburg, which placed Kelly
safe on first. A hit by Swindells' scored
Spies and Reilly, and the same kind of
stick work by Bowman scored Kelly anÂ«
Swindells. After that the local team
played something that was like baseball
and <the Angels were put to rest.
The damage had been done, and all the
redemption ever, measured was insufficient
to make up for what was lost. Iburg al
lowed but three other hits outside the
eventful and disastrous inning. With Mr.
Pabst he shared the signal mistakes ot
the day. Pabst seems to be suffering from
torsal rigidity. If a ball is not placed in
his hands he falls to stop it. and his bat
ting,'his erstwhile strong point, fell 100
points in the game yesterday.
The local team had an opportunity or
piling up a few runs in the second. and
the fifth, and it rested with Pabst to do
the trick. He failed in the early inning,
but partially redeemed himself later by a
timely hit to right which brought in two
runs. In the second Inning, with two men
cremated and the bags filled, Mr. Pabst
did this much for his countryâ he struck
out. The fifth gave the Wasps $t fair
showing on the blackboard. Hildebrand,
Schwartz and Holland were on the bags.
Then the Brewer hit, scoring Hildebrand
and Schwartz. Holland scored later on
Graham's out.
The sixth was of a strong local coloring.
Krug found his eye for a good double,
Schwartz was there for a single and Hol
land for the same. Two runs was the re
sult. In the eighth the Wasps had a
chance to tie the score, but did not. Krug,
Holland and Pabst were on the bases. and
Graham was at the bat. Two men 'had
come and gone. Graham did likewise, cut
ting the air three separate times. Â¦Â¦Â¦
Krug and Graham performed In a base
throwing act that caught the crowd, and
Holland did some good work in the field
and at the bat. Oscar Jones relieved
"Youngey" Johnson in the seventh. The
score: !
San Francisco 6, Los Angeles 8.
, Iburg hit the blue sky in the third in
ning yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Grounds, and when the â¢ . Orangemen
dragged him to earth he had the extreme
pleasure of hearing the bell ring seven
times. Six hits off the arch curver of the
league and ragged local support were re
sponsible for the seven runs..-'

teenth century mistakes of the republ'c.
He said it was wrong to give the negro
a vote immediately after emancipation be
cause it resulted in a "solid South" with
out any stimulating political rivalry and
developed a feeling of racial antipathy in
the new generations that never existed
between ex-slave and mastÂ°r.

BOO cubic feet, costing *C6.622 69; 1900,-13,753,800
cubic feet, costlns $20,797 69.
Amount of gas saved In 1900, 3.965,700 cube
feet, at tl 40. $3551 98.
Cost of lighting: public streetsâ 1S97. J299.332 36:
1S98, J2S7.23S 64; 1899, $254,518 60; 1900, $189,909 06.
In the year 1900, for four months, the
street lights were extinguished ! at mid
night, saving $40,000 to the city. If this is
added the cost would be $229,909 06. or $24.-
C09 54 less than the year before. Owing to
the insistent protest by the Board of Pub

for street lights the new Welsbach burn

the same price as the old burners.

BOY INSTANTLY KILLED
BY A SWITCH ENGINE
OAKIjAND, April 13.â William Flnck, a
17-year-old employe of the Judson Iron
Works, was killed by the cars near tfte
works this afternoon. Young Finck
was riding on the foot board of a switch
engine, drawing several cars, when he
slipped and fell across the track. The
engine passed over his body, killing him
instantly.
The boy was an orphan and had been
adopted a few years ago by a Mrs. Boyle,
living in Emeryville. He was employed
on the night shift at the iron works. The
remains were taken charge of by Coroner
Mehrmann, who will hold an Inquest.
The members of the present Health Board
will request the City Trustees to make the
appointment. Action will be taken next
Monday , night, when the new Board of
City Trustees will meet for the first time.
Miss Krickau was a natlvÂ» of Pennsyl
vania. Peter Krickau, her father. Is a
machinist by occupation. She leaves two
sisters, Mrs. John Becker and Miss
Louise Krickau, and a brother, Albert
Krickau of Pennsylvania.
Paralysis is thought to have caused the
sudden death of the young woman, but to
determine it beyond question an autopsy
will be held. The exact cause of the
blindness will also be revealed, and the
case is expected to be of vaiue to medical
science.
Without much difficulty the fire was ex
tinguished, and, though she was not
harmed, Miss Krickau never recovered
from the fright. Not long after the acci
dent her eyesight began to fail. She grad
ually grew worse, until finally total blind
ness-resulted.
I The best physicians in the world were
unable to give Miss Krickau any relief.
She was treated by the noted Dr. Barcan
of San Francisco and Dr. Howe of Buf
falo. It was their opinion that she was
suffering from consumption of the optic
nerve, for which there is no cure.
Miss Krickau's story is pathetic. One
night eight years ago she sought some
thing in the pantry of her home. It was
dark and she lighted a match. When it
had burned low she threw it beind her.
It caught on the folds of her dress, soon
causing the flimsy cloth to burn.

LONDON. April 13.â The friends of the
American jockeys now in England are bo
far badly disappointed at the season's
work. Not a single American appeared at
Leicester yesterday. Lester Reiff has lost
fifteen out of twenty races, Johnny Reiff
thirty-one out of thirty-six and Maher
sixteen out of twenty. Those failures are
variously attributed to the fact that most
of the English jockeys have adopted the
American style or to the immature condi
tion of the American mounts.
One of the interesting results of the
American Invasion is the appearance on
the turf of a new racing saddle, with slid
ing Ftirrups. which is warranted to give
a jockey an American seat without effort
on his part. The stirrup straps work on
much the eame principle as the V-shaped
American suspended fasteners, and the in
ventor of the new saddle claims it auto
matically changes the rider's weight from
front to rear, and vice versa, giving all
the advantage of the American style of
riding.

hull. Her spars are completed and the
builders promise to have her mainfnast
Etepped within an hour after the boat's

at Dawson. commencing July 1 (Dominion
day), and continuing for a week or more.
A half-mile race track will be built, a site
for which had already been selected.
Charley Meadows, one of those interested,
was to" have left shortly for the outside
to arranpe tor the booking of horses and
jockeys for a race meeting to be held in
connection with the carnival. Suitable
purses will be put up to induce some of
the leading horsemen of "the outside" to
enter. Shooting clubs are to be formed
and electric traps imported for a bluerock
tournament.
Thr biggest feature of the carnival
probably will be a fight between Tom
Sharkey and Prank Slavin. Arrangements
will be made to have the fight, which will
take place In the open, reproduced on the

EPOBT CAKNTVAX TO
BE HELD IN DAWSON
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, April 13.
Attorney W. A. Dow has invoked a tech
nicality in the Ruch-McMenomy contest
which late developments prove disastrous
to his own client should the court adhere
to his original ruling In Â¦ Dow's favor.
Eeeinp that he was "hoist by his own
petard," Ruch's attorney appealed to
Judge Ellsworth to reverse his decision
In order that his client might be saveJ.
The point in question arose over a Mc-
Menomy ballot, on which a voter ha.l
marked a cross opposite a space on the
Muncinal League ticket in which was
printed, "No Nomination." The omission
of a candidate's name from this space
was due to the fact that Dr. Myra Knox,
nominee for School Director on the
league ticket, was also nominted by the
Republicans. As the Republicans filed
their certificates of nomination with th-
City Clerk before the Muncipial Leaguers,
Dr. Knox's name was printed with the
Republican i candidates on the ballot. It
thus occurred, apparently, that, mar.y
electors, wishing to vote the Municipal
League ticket straight and knowing that
four nominations for School Directors
were made, marked a cross after each of
the four spaces reserved on the Municipal
League ticket for School Directors, In
cluding that marked "No Nomination "
Ruch, running on the Municipal League
ticket, was the greater sufferer from this
error.
It happened that the first ballot on
which the mistake in question was made
was for McMenomy.
Attorney Dow, representing Ruch, im
mediately challenged the vote on the
ground that the mark might serve as an
identification. Judge Ellsworth sustained
Dow's objection and the ballot was
thrown out.
At to-day's hearing a bunch of Ruch
ballots marked with crosses after the "no
nomination" space was encountered, and
it fairly took the respondent's breath
away. Twenty of the ballots were found
in the vote from the Second Precinct.
At the start Ruch had an advantage of
five votes. According to the previously
accepted procedure the vote of the Second
Precinct wipes out this plurality and
places McMenomy fifteen votes ahead.
Dow demurred.
"I hope," he said, "that your Honor will
reconsider your decision on this point.
Otherwise this error of the voters be
comes a trap whereby the people are
thwarted of their choice.
"Any intelligent voter might make such
a mistake. DeMring to vote the straight
league ticket and knowing that four
School Directors at large were to be elect
ed, he might stamp opposite the space
"no nomination" without noticing the ex
act words, e6pecialjy as they were print
ed in the same type as the names of the
candidates.
"If all these ballots are to be thrown out
on this account the will of the people con
cerning almost any office in the city could
undoubtedly be defeated."
Attorney Frick. on behalf of the con
testant, twitted Dow with being the first
to raise the objection, Â¦which, now that it
went against him, he desired to repudiate.
He argued that each ballot should be
scrutinized on its own merits without re
gard to the net result. He cited authori
ties In support cf the view that a mark of
the kind under discussion was to be con
sidered an Identification.
Judge Ellsworth decided to suspend the
recount and look up the law on the ques
tion in dispute. He adjourned court until
Monday for that purpose.

whole matter came to the knowledg-e of
the .'Prince of Wales, and of Earl Gran

at once took diplomatic steps. He inti
mated that if the pretensions of the Duke
of Modena should even be permitted to
be mentioned to his Royal Highness the
latter and the English Embassador would
leave Vienna without opening the British
department of the exhibition and without
even troubling themselves about a fare
well audience. Of course among the dis
tinguished personages not present at the
opening of the exhibition was the Duke of
Modena. That gentleman died two years
later, in 1875. This was probably the only
occasion Â¦ during the reign of Queen Vic

Stuarts succeeded in coming into diplo

matic episode which happened in 1S73,
when King Edward VII, as- Prince of
Wales, went to Vienna to assist at the
opening of the World's Fair.
At that time. Duke Franz V of Modena
lived in'-Vienna and, on "hearing that the
Prince of Wales was to represent Great
Britain, this quizzical old gentleman, who
as a descendant of the Stuarts claimed to
be legal King of Great Britain and Ire

he alone was entitled to represent the

From two sources come accounts of
rich strikes of gold. One of these Is re
ported to have been made at Yankee Hill,
above Columbia, where an old-time pit
at the depth of thirty-five feet developed
a gravel deposit which' was eighteen,
inches deep and ten feet wide. The local
papers say that 512,000 was taken out in
a short time and that the deposit is un
doubtedly large. Many ' years ago the
former owners of the claim sank a shaft
to within four feet of where the channel
was and then quit. The other strike is
reported to have been made near the Cal
ifornia line in Josephine County, ' Oregon,
near Kirbysvllle. In this instance a man
was fishing- and saw what seemed to be.
shining gold in. the bed of the stream
near the bank. He returned home and
procured a : pick and shovel to prospect
and discovered an eight-foot ledge, which
has yielded $10,000. .The find is In the
Siskiyou Mountain foothills.
The Jenny Lind mine in Nevada Coun
ty, which was once well known as a gravel
proposition until it was shut down by rea
son of the North Bloomfleld decision, will
now be worked for quartz. Millwrights
and laborers are getting ready to place a
ten-stamp mill, which was recently pur
chased from the Gold Point Company.
Two tunnels have been driven into the
hill, one being In 1250 feet and tapping the
quartz ledge at a depth of 200 feet from
the surface and the other 250 feet, cutting
the ledge at a depth of 400 feet.

Threw Bread at the Cook.
Looey Gon, a cook In the Hotel Grenada.
Sutter street, appeared before Judge Fritz
yesterday on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. He was accused by Wil
liam Holzhauser, bakrr at the hotel, with
trying to cut him with a butcher knife.
The defense was that Holzhauser always
threw the bread an.l buns at the cook
Instead of delivering them In the proper
manner, and they had some words about
it. The baker assaulted the cook and the
latter seized the knife to defend himself.
The Judze took the case under advise

Larsen. a saloon-keeper on Stevenson

some nights ago. when Larsen missed a
diamond pin valued at $100. Maggie O'Dea,

The ordinance recently adopted by the
Board of Supervisors, imposing a fee for
trenching work * done by light and fresh
water corporations, has been found to bo
insufficient to carry out Its purposes. Tna
ordinance provides for a scale of fees
which would bring an Income from tha
several corporations of about $600 per
month.
At present there are two Inspectors em
ployed to attend to this work, whose
salaries are paid by the city. A new ordi
nance has been prepared, which will be
submitted to the Supervisors to-morrow,
providing that no trench shall be opened
by any corporation without first obtaining
a permit from the Board of Public Works.
The corporations contend that under the
State constitution the city can only en
force the filing with the Board of Super
visors of a good and sufficient bond, guar
anteeing the condition of the streets after
work has been done upon them, and also
that notice of their intention Â¦ to do any
work be given t,o the proper authorities.
The courts will immediately bo asked to
pass upon these questions.

"He could have had the whole store,**
remarked the second-hand dealer, when
telling his troubles to the police yester
day, " as I was convinced that the tele
gram was genuine. How Ficklesteln knew
that my brother lived In New York is a
mystery to me. He called him by his first
name, and claimed that he was Intimately
acquainted with him. As I thought he
was telling the truth I readily gave him
the articles he desired."
Ficklesteln promised to return the fol
lowing day and settle for the goods, but
he failed to keep his word. Since then be
has not been seen and Eckstein Is satis
fled that he has left the city.
M. Eckstein, who conducts a second
hand store at 910 Kearny street, has asked
the police to arrest an ex-soldier named
Fickelstein for swindling him out of $70
worth of clothing, jewelry and a brace of
revolvers. Several days ago, according to
Eckstein's story, the ex-soldier visited
Eckstein's place of business and showed
him a telegram purporting to have been
sent by the second-hand dealer's brother,
who Hve3 in New York, telling him to
give Fickelstein all the goods he wanted
on credit, as he was good for any amount.
Thinking that the'telesram was genuine
Eckstein allowed him to select the most
costly garments in the store.

t'opper. General Electric and some others. It
has long been evident that the upward prlc*
movement is not at all governed by news.
Neither last week nor this week has there been
any news bearing upon the stocks most affected
beyond the constant reiteration of already dls
rountefl and thrashed out rumors. Th* -Bur
lington "deal." the Southwestern railroad
merger, the consolidation of Copper Interests
end othfr unconfirmed, and In some cases con
tradicted, EFwrtiocs have formed the stock In
trade of the bulls, as they have for some time
PÂ«*t. The gooÂ«I news seems to be all out for
the present and lt is a maxim with the
trader in stocks that this means reaction.
There are besides several unpropitious features
In the pronpect. Chief of these Is the money
outlook- With the resources of New York
banks loaned almcst up to the limit or their re
perves, there are several forces of depletion at
Â¦work on the reÂ«y>rvcs themselves. The Interior
center* are rnnklng their seasonable demands
upon New York for cash. The taking up oi the
Government's large surplus revenues Is draw-
Ing money constantly out of New York banks
Â¦Ad Into the Euclreaeury. The outgo of gold
The rtock market has been feverish and ner
vous at times during the past week and the
selling pressure has overborne the demand sev
eral times, resulting in sharp reaction?. On
Monday, when trading was resumed after the
three days' holiday, the market took on an
appearance resembling demoralization and
price* crumbled in a way to alarm the long
vaisted bulls and in fact cost them large profits
by wiping out margins and forcing them to
liquidate to Etx>i> losses. The powerful specu
lative pools, which have long " ruled with a
Ftrong hand, seemed to have lost control com
pletely. But the later events of the week
gave ground for the suspicion that the flurry
on Monday had been In the nature of a. shak
ing out of weak: holding, which constitute an
overhanging threat to an advance. These weak
holders were the buyers of last week, to whom
the professional pools sold stocks in the period
of excited speculation and were thus In a con
dition to see a reaction In prices with complac
ency. That they were willing to buy stocks at
a lower level, that their resources for sup
porting the market and manipulating prices
were not exhausted and that these manipu
lated advances had lost none of their
power to attract. waa abundantly demon

CHICAGO, April 13. â A decline at Liverpool
was influential at the opening of the wheat
market, May selling %@%c lower at 70%c to
70Hc. The majority of traders who bought on
recent Hessian fly complaints sold out at the
start. A demand for July raised that option
to %c premium over May and helped the
nearer future. At the decline the bull contin
gent put up a stiff fight and during the first
half hour succeeded In ' forcing a recovery to
70%c for May. The remainder of the curtailed
Saturday session was chiefly occupied in chang
ing May to July, business being on a moderate
scale. The prospect of a bearish set pf . statis
tics Monday, however, gave ri3e to an easier
tone and May gradually worked : off to 70%Â®
70 l 4c and closed easy, %c lower, at 70%c.
The trade in corn was small and most pro
fessional. May closed %c lower at 43%c.
Oats were dull. May closed He .lower at 25c.
Provisions were dull and easy on selling by
packers. May pork and lard closed 5c down
and ribs a shade depressed. â¢ . Â¦

The Improvement In sliver early In the week
was due . to speculative purchase of options.
The advance was maintained temporarily by
Government purchases, presumably for mint
purposes. -Later the price relapsed on-Ameri
can Eelling. There is no likelihood of a near
revival of the . Indian demand.
NEW YORK, April 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Trading on the etock market here was brisk
to-day and the tone Â¦ was cheerful.- The-Amer
ican department especially was active. Amer
ican Stocks were being readily absorbed par
ticularly to-day the Erie, Northern Pacific and
Louisvllles. The Continent, however, contin
ues to realize. Money waÂ« very. easy.
â¢ The Statist regards the condition of Great
Britain's foreign trade as of great importance
to the money market, adding: "It means that
in view of the enormous purchases of foreign
produce we are Indebted to foreign countries,
especially the United â¢ States. Should any
thing arise to. induce the , United States or
France to ask for payment In gold Instead of
securities a very tight condition would ensue.
Our, indebtedness to New York and Paris Is
rot likely to have an adverse effect on the
pesition of London. While money in New York
and Paris is cheap and the rate Is 3H per
cent in London there would be sufficient In
ducement for American and French bankers
to- leave their money here. But the position
may be considerably modified In the autumn,
when money- In the>United States and France
will probably be much more wanted, .' and lt
Till'-' be -essential for bankers there to call In
a .portion of "the money they are employing
here. - It Is very desirable, therefore, to main
tain the money value during the summer and
strengthen the gold . resources to meet the de
mands of the autumn." ..
In spite of the easier condition of short loans
discounts hardened, owing to the large outflow
tc- the provinces during .the past fortnlgnt re
tiuclng the bank's reserve to under Â£22,000,000
ard the adverse movement of New York ex
change. Probably, however, ; this will not be
maintained.' Money is likely to be somewhat
scarce until the budget is introduced April 18,
as clearances of dutiable goods in the mean
time will doubtless be very heavy, causing an
inflow of cash into the Bank of England.
Thereafter clearances will probably be meager.
As the disbursements are considerably ex
ceeding the income the treasury will be obliged
to raise money. Otherwise the Government
Instead of the market will be a borrower 'from
the bank, resulting in easier discounts. The
treasury during the past week had recourse
to bank borrowing In order to meet payments.
The usual April and May movements of cash
toward the country are likely to further re
duce the reserve of the Bank of England,- not
Blowing a reduction for the bank rate, unless
lit the event of extensive Continental and
American applications for the loan causing large
gold imports, though the prospect of an In
flow is not hopeful, owing to the condition of
money and exchange in New York and the fact
that I/or.don has been a large buyer of Ameri
can securities. Half a million in gold left
ltdia to-day and is due in London on . May
S. It will tand to strengthen the bank when
its resources will be considerably taxed by the
finance market in Its applications for the loan.
Consequent upon the plenitude of money the
indebtedness , of five millions tp the Bank of
England was fully redeemed by the middle of
the week, but fresh borrowings since of two
millions at 4Va. per cent at various dates have
been necessary to meet the requirement?.
LONDON. April 11.â Further borrowings from
the banks have relieved the stringency, some
what. ' Discounts were steady.

WASHINGTON, April 13.â To-day's state
ment of the Treasury balances in the "general
fund, exclusive of the $150,000,000 gold reserve,
shows: Available cash balance, .$152,649,735;
gold, $100,3C8.439.
Condition of the Treasury.
The Financier says: In the face of. a. state
ment like that of April 6 it was manifestly
impossible for the New York banks to further
expand their liabilities, and the exhibit of May
13 shows that they have been contracting their
loans and taking other steps to build up their
reserve percentages. The effect of this policy;
as expressed In a decrease of $13,489,600 in the
loan Item and of $1C,492,1OO In deposits, was
to reduce the amount which has to be- carried
against deposits by over $4,000,000, so, that
despite the loss of $2,000,000 in cash to the
Sub-Treasury and the interior, the excess 1
above the legal reserve was Increased $2,120,225,
making a total surplus of $7,938,200. This, jt
Is needless to remark, does not .mean, easier
money as the operation was one of banking
prudence and necessity, originating with the
clearing house Institutions themselves and not
reflecting a replenishment of the money sup
ply. The statement, however, will be regarded
as a favorable tone from the fact that the sur
plus Is larger, and really is to be regarded as
a reassuring one in its revelation of the power
of the banks to maintain absolute control of
the situation. The average percentage of .re
serve of the associated banks at the close of
the previous week was only 25.6 per cent, and
for the six days ending Saturday 25.8 per cent.
Money. did not average 5 per cent on call dur
ing the week, but even slight rises in quota
tions brought outside banks Into the market
as heavy lenders. The statement this week
includes bond payments and other receipts not
counted In the previous exhibit, thus rectifÂ»
Ing the obviously misleading totals of April
6. In the same manner payments by the
Treasury for bonds bought at the end of the
current week will not show until next week.
The operations of syndicates which have con
summated plans may have the effect soon of
releasing funds, but for the moment the out
look favors .some firmness in rates, although
no stringency is feared. As a matter of fact,
it does not seem possible that money can go
to anything- like an extreme point here with
out bringing the usual relief from abroad, but
this is mentioned as a mere possibility rather
than a probability.

ment of averages of the Associated Banks

from the country has been suspended this week,
owing conjointly to the tighter money market
In New York and the easing of the London
market by the disbursement there of Govern
ment dividends, but it remains to be seen
whether the preparations for the taking up of
the new issue of consols, which is expected in
the latter part of the month, will not renew
the pressure upon New York fcr gold. Then
the season of crop uncertainties is approaching
and the effect of the first Government report of
the condition of the new crop calls attention
to the speculative dangers inherent In this im
portant subject. Wheat advanced and the
grangers declined on the report, notwithstand
ing the high average of condition reported, the
speculators showing nervousness over the evi
; dence of insect dair.are. But Wall street has
a sapient saying that "the way to bull a stock
is to buy lt." The action of the market seems
to bear out the faith of the speculative leaders
; that so long as they can command resources
to bid a stock up to a sharply higher price,
the country will furnish buyers to take lt off
their hands at a profit. The Impression pre
vails in Wall street, how Juatly there is no
way of course of finding out, that the specula
tive coterie which has led the recent advance
has the countenance and support or the bank-'
ing and financial Interests, which have been
prominent in the great financial projects re
cently consummated. The purchase of con
trolling Interests In other" properties has been
often supplemented by an issue of collateral
trust bonds to supply the purchase money. It
Is In the course of business that the bankers
of the syndicates who subscribed for these se
curities should market them. Their price is
effected by the market price of the stock which
forms their collateral security, which gives the
bankers and syndicates an Interest in the mir
ket price of the stocks. The profits of the
underwriting syndicate of the United States
Steel Corporation accrue first in the form of the
shares remaining after the various exchanges
under the plan are affected. This Is the' ground
for the suspicion in Wall street that elaborate
provision has been made for the support of
these stocks in the market, backed by the re
sources of the syndicates. It must be re
membered that a large amount of . the loans
outstanding of the New York banks are to the
various railroad and industrial syndicates,
made up of bankers and capitalists, who are
intimately acquainted with the affairs of the
money market and prospective movements in it.
The possible effect upon interest rates of the
manner and time of liquidating, these large
loans Is obvious. The speculators' make much
of the proposed plans and determination of
large capitalists to guard the slock specula
tion from serious harm from money stringency
and this belief, widely and rather vaguely held.
Is an Important influence In fostering the spec
ulation in face of some of the unpropltlous
features known to exist in the prospect.
Less attention has been paid to bonds than
to stocks and their movement have been Irregu

The Butter and Egg market Is In a.' badly
demoralized condition, owing to the different
prices quoted by the ' various Interests. For
some tlmÂ» the Dairy Exchange has been quot
ing one Ket of prices, while sales on the street
and ' In the country have been made at an en
tirely different set. All this Is confusing and
a' source of great disturbance to the trade.
Much of the trouble originated In the practice
of 1 contracting In the - country on newspaper
quotations, to which The Call baa repeatedly
called attention for a number, of years. The
result of thlB la the two : seta of quotations
mentioned above. 'With a view to rectifying
this disorder and enabling every dealer and
producer to see at a glance the exact state of
the market -The Call will hereafter quote thÂ«
prices ruling " In the open market" as well as
those ruling on the exchange. The difference.
It will be seen, ; la marked, especially In the
case of Butter and Eggs. , . . . -- Â¦ . Â¦
.Stocks of Butter -are liberal and the market
Is rather slow. Spot stocks of Eggs are still
kept down by the demand for ; storage.
Receipts were 37,600 pounds and 74 tub* of

LAUNDRY RATES
ARE ADVANCED
Shorter Hours and More Pay
for Employes Gives
the Excuse.
Â»
Increase in Bills Causes Worry, but
Problem May Be Met by Or
ganization of Washing
Circles.
Cleanliness mty be a near relation to
godliness ln some localities, but in San
Francisco just at present the two are
estranged. Laundry rates have gone
bounding upward, and those who would
be cleanly are giving vent to many un-
godly expressions.
John Chinaman is "it" at this writing,
because he hasn't advanced far enough in
the ways of American civilization to know
the value of organization, but should he
become enlightened and form a "Chinese
Washermen's Union" clean collars and
cuffs will be a luxury, pajamas a dream
and 6heets and pillow cases will have to
do duty for more than the ordinary num
ber of days allotted.
Wages Go Up 5 Per Cent, Bates 50.
Heretofore it was cheaper to send out
the "washing" than to have it done at
home. This has been changed by the ad
vance of washing and Ironing prices by
the principal aeam laundries of the city
p in order to meet the demands granted
their employes. Now somebody has to
pay for the advance, and the customer
has been selected to bear the burden of
the man who needs a clean shirt.
The laundry workers claimed that the
Increased wages mean an advance of less
than 6 per cent. In order to keep things
even the proprietors of the laundries have
advanced prices anywhere from 25 to 50
per cent. The greatest increase is made
on work that requires the least skill, but
the largest amount of manual labor.
A sliding scale of prices has been adopt
ed. To launder negligee shirts, which
Â¦were usually regarded as soft snaps, costs
now from 10 to IS cents. The picnic and
the negligee shirt usually flourish at the
same time. It does not matter whether
these shirts are with or without cuffsâ all
go into the wash together and come out
with the same bills.
From those who wear the curious robe
de nuit combination, known as pajamas,
a slightly less proportionate and heavier
impost of washing duties has been ex
acted. Twenty cents was formerlly the
price demanded for the cleansing of this
garment. Now It costs a quarter.
Barbers Suffer as They Advance.
A peculiar distinction is made about
utirbers' coats. If you are a plain, or
dinaryi every-day barber your jacket can
be laundered lor a dime. But if you pro
gress ln the profession and attain to the
dignity of a tonsorial artist, with frogs
and other furbelows upon vour lather
stained jacket, you will be compelled to
give up a long bit The barber commis
tioners will in all probability be called
upon to arbitrate as to who shall pay the
"short" and who the "lone" bit.
When it comes down to family washing
the greatest pinch is felt. Sheets per
dozen were formerly scheduled at 23 cents*
now they cost 40 cents. Slips and rollers
Â¦ have been advanced from 25 cents to 30
cents, and napkins and towels from 10
cents to 25 cents.
Now there is a howl all along the wash
line. The laundry proprietors seem to
have the best of the price list so far and
the laborers have got their shorter hours
tnd mot ? < pay - The Proprietors with one
accord claimed that the advance is neces
sary to meet the demands of their heln
and that if the tariff was not increased

hour and ten minutes yesterday morning

John Bond, a Klondike miner, reported
to Captain Seymour yesterday afternoon
that he had been robbed in a tenderloin
saloon of about 104 ounces of gold dust,
valued at between $1400 and $1500, which
he carried In a canvas bag. " .
Bond said that he arrived from Seattla
Friday morning and engaged a room at 12
Turk street. He had some loose coin with
him and the gold dust, which he kept in
a canvas bag attached to his waist belt.
He started out that n.ight to see the
sights. He remembered going Into the
saloon kept by "Spider" Kelly at the cor
ner of Eddy and Mason streets, where he
had several drinks. Ho got friendly with
th'e barkeeper and showed him the bag
of gold dust. The barkeeper advised him
to leave the gold dust with him for safe
keeping, offering to give him a receipt for
It, so. that he could call and get it when
he was sober. ..
"I wanted to be foxy," said Bond, "and
told the barkeeper, that I was from the
Klondike and thought 1 was old enough
to take care of . myself and the canva3
bag.- I had some more drinks in the saloon
and -treated*, some of the men who w*re
standing at the bar, who, I think, over
heard my conversation with the bar
keeper. I must confess that I was very
drunk, but after I srot nome I missed the
gold dust. . I immediately Trent out and
told the first policeman ,-I met that I had
been robbed and he advised me to report
the fact to police headQuarters." - ;
â¢ Bond did not. attach any blame to the
barkeeper, who' wanted to be his friend,
but. he was sure that one of the men with
whom he drank at the bar .robbed him
while pretending to be nis friend. Captain
Seymour detailed Detectives McMahon
and Riordan on the casa.
John Bond Claims He Was
Robbed While Taking ;
in the Sights.

-'â¢.'â¢ "(r ? Â¦ . '
The body of Jacob F. Scherer was found
by Officer Greggains yesterday
morning in the brush on the ocean beach
about 100 yards south of the Olympic Club

a suicide.
On the body of the dead man was found
the following letter, very neatly, written
.with pen and ink on a letterhead of the
Central Hotel:

KILLS HIMSELF
WITH A PISTOL
Â¦ .Seme progress was made yesterday to
ward forming an. organization in -which
all producing oil companies in the State
will be invited to become members. A
committee appointed at a conference held
Frldav evening at the Palace Hotel met
in the offices of the Monte Cristo Oil Com
pany and proceeded to consider what
could be done. This committee consisted
of the following named representatives of
oil companies: B. F. Brooks, : represent
ing the Senator, Aztec, Chicago Crude,
Central Point, Consolidated and Toltec
companies: Leon Guggenhime, Imperial
Oil Company; Messrs. Jenks and Mauseau,
the Four Oil Company; J. H.- Blood *of the
Sterlin; TV. M. Noxon of the Globe and Eu
clid companies, Messrs.'' Jacobs and Mason
of the Alma. Black 'Jack and "Wolverine:
J. J. Scrivener of the San Joaquin Valley
Oil Company, J. L. .Mitchell of. the Clare
mont and Linda Vista companies,' Isaac
Strassburger of the Kern River, John Ear
ly of the Revenue Oil Company and Henry
Ach of the Monte Cristo Company.' .There
were also present representatives of other,
companies, but not as members of the
committee.
A sub-committee, was appointed to pre
pare details of the plan . of orgaffization
to be submitted. to the general committee
and also contracts ajid agreements ;to be
signed by -all producing companies that
become members of the organization; The
general committee will meet within- a
week. The principal object of the. new.
organization, as explained by -Henry, Ach
and others, is to make it the selling agent
for all the fuel oil producing companies
of the State north and south of Tehachapi.
The association will appoint an executive
committee to fix the price of oinfrom time
to time and to sell the toil, and also to
apportion the sales among the members
of the association.
Henry Ach says that the association will
be in a position to sell oil to all comers.
The reports concerning production have
been exaggerated. In his view of the sit
uation there is inot,any more than. enough
oil now produced to meet the present de
mand, which is rapidly '. increasing and'
will keep pace with - the production, for
oil is now beinsr ' sold largely outside of
the State In Alaska,- Washington, Oregon
and the Hawaiian Islands. .
