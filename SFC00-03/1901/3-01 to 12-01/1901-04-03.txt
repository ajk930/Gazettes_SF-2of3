It has jbeen suggested that under the
terms of the notice of amnesty Aguinaldo
should be set at liberty at once, but there
is a provision In the amnesty proclama
tion which cays that those who have vio
lated the laws of war are excepted from
its terms.' Whether or : not General Mac-
Arthur has satisfied himself that Aguin
aldo has not violated the law cannot be
stated, as tbe prisoner would be permitted
to take the oath pending an Investigation
of his past conduct. : Aguinaldo, having
been . the head of . the insurrection; un
doubtedly can be held until further inves
tigratlon is made or -until "the circum
stances which, surround- the situation In
the ' Philippines make it advisable to re
lease him outright" or otherwise dispose of
h*n. These conditions and the general
situation .and Aguinaldo's relation to
them' were the subject ; of General Mac-
Arthur's dispatch," and are being consid
ered by the- authorities here, who will
have the final disposition of the matter. .
#The news of Aguinaldo's action was re
cel\'ed ;wlth' : evident- satisfaction by the
"War Department,- and the opinion was ex
pressed that " good results would . follow
among those who are still holding out
against the United States. â¢
Â» The taking of the oath In itself Â¦ Is : re
garded as giving Aguinaldo ' a status ' of
loyalty to the United States quite different
from Â¦ those still in ; arms. The depart
ment's Instruction for the government of
armies in the field recites as follows:
Thn ; commander will Â¦ throw ' the . burden of
war, as much as lies within bis power, on
the disloyal citizens of the revolted portion
or province, and if 'he deems " it appropriate,
or if his government' demands of him that ev
ery citizen shall, by an oath of allegiance de
clare hjs fidelity to the legitimate government,
he may expel, transfer,' imprison or fine the
revolting . citizens who ; refuse to take the
oath, etc' >~-2K$aQQ<Â«BgpnC|HQp Â¦' .
. "Whether It Is expedient to do so, and wheth
er reliance I can be placed upon euch. oath, the
commander or his government ; has â¢Â¦ the . right
to decide. ;Â»Â¦ , ;. ;V
- in the present case General MacArthur"
has considered it expedient to have Agui
naldo Â¦ take . this oath and apparently . has
held that reliance can be placed upon -the
oath. .The army regulations . make no dis
'tlnct provision that tho taking of the oath
shall give complete liberty^ to. a-person,
although the- provision quoted' shows that
those manifesting loyalty by subscribing'
to an oath of allegiance are to be spared
from the hardships of war. and that i only
those remaining disloyal . ire .to be visited
with; the harsh treatment 'of- war. " '
Did Not yibla^Arttcles."
The War Department" 'authorities . say
that -off enses against ' the articles of war
excepted' in -the proclamation; of amnesty
refer, tof murders and like, depredations.'
Only recently five Filipino' offlcers were
executed ' for . such "offenses. ; . It'' is "not
known here whether 'Aguinaldo ; was re
sponsible in any case for : such ' offenses, (
a great deal may be accomplished through
Aguinaldo. During the time he has. been
a prisoner he has made quite a favorable
impression upon General MacArthur.
"Aguinaldo's taking the oath of alle
giance," said one member of the Cabinet
to-day, "emphasizes the importance of his
capture. It makes more clear that the
insurrection has about reached" its end
and foreshadows the early complete gen
eral acceptance of United States sover
eignty and authority. Only a compara
tively small number of Filipinos are still
in arms, and the effect of Aguinaldo's ac
tion on them is obvious. From now on we
will press organizing the best government
we can suited to the needs of the Philip
pines. Aguinaldo's submission will have
a considerable bearing in his favor in the
determination of the matter of what to do
with him, which will not be decided for
some time."

he was a failure. It is only since he came
to America that hia voice. has regained
Its former brilliancy. '

DENVER, Colo., April 2.â The city elec
tion to-day has gone heavily Republican,
the only part which is at all in doubt be
ins: the Mayoralty and some of the mem
bers of the Council. - Henry V. Johnson,
present Mayor, ran independently on a tic-
HICAGO. April 2.-Carter H. Har
/f. rison has been re-elected Mayt.r
Wof Chicago for the second time
and will next week commence his
third term as the chief executive
of the city. His total plurality over Judge
Elbridge Kanecy (R.) is 28,257 votes. Tha
total vote of the city is: Harrison, 156,932;
Hanecy, 128,695.
In the last Mayoralty election the vote
â¢was: Harrison (D.), 14S.49C; Carter (R.),
107.437; Harrison's plurality. 41,053.
In the Presidential campaign last fall
the city vote for President -was: McKin
ley, 154,786; Bryan. 177.165; McKlnleys
plurality, 7621.
â¢Of the thirty-five wards of the city,
Harrison to-day carried twenty-six and
Hanecy nine. The vote was badly split,
some of the strongest Republican pre
cincts of the city giving only a small
plurality for the ticket and some going to
Harrison, who suffered in some of tho
Democratic strongholds. The city ward3
were redlstricted after the Presidential
election and the majorities In some of th-;
wards were turned squarely around from
what they have always been.
Some Redistricted Out.
The redistrictins will make some differ
ence In the complexion of the next Mu
nicipal Council, as several of the Alder
men, who in ordinary circumstances would
have held over, were redistricted out of
their wards. There were two holdovers
in the Second and two in the Twenty-first
wards and no holdovers in the Seventh
and the Thirty-first. Where there were
two holdovers the new Council Â¦will de
cide which men are entitled to the seat,
and where there were none, and two men
were elected at the present election, the
courts will be called upon to decide tho
question of the legality of an aldermanic
election in which two men were elected
at one time instead of one, as provided
by the statutes governing the case. : For
these reasons It is impossible at this time
to predict the exact formation of the new
Council, but the indications are at pres
ent that the Republicans will have a
working majority. The present body con
sists of thirty-nine Republicans, twenty
seven Democrats and four Independents.
Of the holdovers sixteen were Repub
licans, fifteen Democrats and three Inde
pendents. *;",*-â¢Â¦
Issues in the Campaign.
The chief issue in tne campaign has been
the granting of franchises to the street
car companies of the city. These will all
expire soon by limitation and the terms
of extension are to be settled during the
next two years. Harrison has in former
years made a record against the granting
of long franchises, and he and all of his
followers claimed throughout the cam
paign that the Republican nominee was
inclined to grant lonff time privileges.
This the Republicans denied with great
energy, making their campaign on the
flaws "they picked in the recorti of Mayor
.Harrison, and sayinar that Hanecy was
no more disposed to favor the street car
coir, panics than is Harrison.
Haueoy was the nominee ot the Repub
lican machine, which is dominated by ex
< "ongressman William Lorimer, and this
fact cost him many votes in his party,
u there are many of tne rank and file
of the party who are stoutly opposed to
i heir party machine and all of its works.
The Democratic following of ex-Governor
Altscld was azainst Harrison.

Prohibitionists Seem to THave Lost
St. Louis is normally a Republican city
by about 15,000 plurality. This has been
reversed and a Democratic plurality of
10,000 rolled up. Some of the Republicans
claim that the Nebit law. has enabled the
Democrats-to make such a strong show
ing at the polls. They claim fraud and
threaten to contest the election. T.is
Democrats, on the other hand, say that
their candidate was elected honestly and
they do not fear the result of a contest.
This election Is of more than local sig
nificance, and ' William J. Bryan, in his
paper, the Commoner, and ex-Governor
John P. Altgeld of Illinois, from the
stump in this city, have fought the elec
tion of Wells because he was a gold
Democrat for two campaigns. They both
indorsed Merriwether, the candidate of
the public ownership party. S3
Two men were slightly -wounded during
the day in difficulties at the polls, but
the day was comparatively â¢ quiet, con
sidering the fierceness . of the contest.
Numerous arrests on the charge of ille
gal voting and the carrying . of concealed
weapons were made during- the day. -
ST. LOUIS, April 2.-Rolla Wells, the

"I met him there." Jones continued.
"Patrick gave me the bottle of chloro
form. He told me to saturate a towel in
chloroform and leave it over his face for
about thirty minutes. . He said that Rice
would probably laugh, but that I should
not be scared. I did as Patrick told me.
I returned home, took a napkin and satu
rated it with chloroform. I put It to . my
own face first, and then put it over ; the
face of Mr. Rice and left the room. I
walked up and down in the halls. The
bell rang several times. I , did Â« not open
the door.- Finally, in about-- a half -hour,
I went into Mr. Rice's room. I raised the
window, took the napkin and towel away
from his face and placed them both In the
range ,- where I burned: them. I sent a
hall-boy for Dr. | Curry, telling him that
Mr. Rice was very bad. Â¦.,-,..
"I went to thÂ« telephone to tell Patrick
that Rice was pretty near gone. When Dr.
Curry came Patrick was with him. I told
them Rice was dead. 'Dead! Oh, my God,
doctor, that is the worst thing that could
have happened to me,' said Patrick." â¢
Jones testified at length about the post
mortem incidents. -He said Patrick on the
day following took charge of the apart
ments. On that day, Jones testified, at
the request of Patrick he made out the
checks for $25,000 and $135,000, respectively,
on Swenson & Sons and the Fifth-avenue
Trust Company. Jones said Patrick also
took charge of about $450,000 In bills and
$3 or ?9 in silver from a drawer in the
millionaire's writing-desk. Jones sail
Patrick also took away two gold watches
and all the private papers of Mr. Rice.
Court then adjourned until to-morrow. .
How Bice Was Killed.
Rice got better-and about noon he want
ed to -get up. '-'He ' talked cheerfully about
going downtown: 1 and seemed much lm
prcved. Jones said he could not get Rice
to take the acid. 'He telephoned Patrick
to meet him at luncheon at a restaurant
on Sixth avenue, near Fiftieth street.
"About the end of August." witness re
plied. "Patrick asked me Â¦whether I had
got the laudanum from the drug store at
Coney Island. I said I had not, but that
I had made some other arrangements to
get the poison.
"Patrick then told : me to give Rice sa
pollo. as that would break him down. I
told Patrick I could not do it, but I told
him I had some mercurial pills which Dr.
'Curry gave me. ' Patrick said I ought to
give them to Rice. I told Patrick 1 could
not do so 'without taking them myself in
his presence. 'Then do so,' Patrick said;
'it won't do you any. harm.' "
"Would Rice take anything you took?"
I "Yes. and- he- would never Â¦ take " medi
cine unless I first took some in his pres
ence. All medicine that was sent him I
had to taste when he saw it." â¢ . .;.;.Â¦
Jones then related what took place on
the day of the death of Mr. Rice.
"I saw Patrick at his house," said he.
"He told me to let him know if Rice grew
better. He would then get from his office
a bottle of oxalic acid, he said, to quicken
Rice's nerve."- :- - -Â¦.'Â¦-'. i ;'
Gave Master Mercury.
"Jones, will you state all the conversa
tion that took place between you and
Patrick in regard to getting Rice out of
the way?" said Mr. Osborne. -*â¢**
Â¦ '"Witness then went on to say that he
secured the poison, chloroform and lauda
num from his brother in Texas./ Jones
testified that he delivered the poison to
Patrick about three weeks before the
death of . Mr. Rice. Jones then went on
to testify that Patrick â¢ had Â¦ never . been
introduced to Rice up to the time of the
latter's death. ,
"Patrick asked me," witness continued,
"whether I did not , think old Rice was
living a little- too Jong for our purposes.
I said. I thought so. Patrick suggested
we put him out of the way. I suggested
Dr. Curry, but Patrick said Dr. Curry
would not do. any tiling 'of the kind."
Charles F. Jones, Rice's valet, was then
called. His testimony was practically a
repetition of his confession. Â¦ He â¢ told of
Patrick's first â¢ meeting with * Rice : and of
Patrick's promise that he would see him
(the witness) "all right" after Rice s
death. He repeated the story of his con
versation with Patrick relative to getting
Rice's signature to a typewritten will
when his mind was not quite clear. -
How He Met. Patrick.
At the conclusion of Mrs. Francis* tes
timony, the Assistant District t Attorney
obtained a subpena for Patrick's medi
cine chest, 'â which Mrs. Francis said was
at her house.' : i. Â¦
Mrs. Anna Francis was recalled to th-3
witness stands She testified that she had
never written any letters for Patrick. She
had written one letter concerning the Rice
will matter to J.M. Coleman of Housten,
Tex., but it was not at Patrick's request.
Patrick had never told her he was Rice's
confidential friend and attorney. Assist
ant District Attorney Osborne asked what
medicines Patrick- had taken last^year
and the witness replied that she knew he
had â¢ taken iron and calomel pills and
medicine for malaria.
NEW YORK, April. 2.â When Albert T.
Patrick was taken - into . Justice Jerome's
cdurt to-day for a continuation of the pre

the straits at this place. Two are already
In place and by the end of the week all
will have been stretched. The cables are
hauled taut by steam cower. Those not
yet raised He at "the bottom of the straits.
These cables were on reels oa the Port
Costa dock. One end ""of each cable was
taken over the lower ai-d secured to the
anchor, on the Port Costa side. The reel
was then put on a scow, which was towed
across the straits to the Benicia side by
a launch. The cable was taken from the
reel and laid on the bottom'of the straits
at high tide. On the Benicia side the cable
was fastened to another temporary cable,
which was secured to the anchor, and an
engine employed to haul the cable over
the tower to the anchor..
The cables are made of plow steel . and
are seven-eighths" of an inch in diameter.
They are the largest cables in the world
carrying power and no others have such
high electric pressure. The distance from
tower to tower on a straight line is 44W
feet, so that the cables are also thÂ»
longest in the world. They are insulated
at both the towers and the anchors by
special Insulators requiring original de
sign and work in electrical engineering.
The current was turned on one day.
February 17. to Vallejo for the purpose of
testing the lines. The success of the test
has already been described In The Call.

VANCOUVER, B. C. April 2.â Two im
portant finds of -great scientific interest
have been mado here recently, j Stewart
Henderson, a barrister of A'shcroft, a few
days ago found scattered in the face of a
landslide the bones of a mammoth of pre
historic days. He Jater found where the
scattered bones had come from,. and dug
out a large part of the complete skeleton,
fossilized, of a mammal which measured
neatly seven feet high at the shoulders.
The bones are being shipped to the mu
seum at Vancouver. .
Another interesting find has also been
made by the crew of the halibut steamer
New England. On the last trip, while in
Virago Sound, Queen .Charlotte Island,
several laige beds of petrified clams were
found. The clams are most peculiar, and
there are now no live shellfish in the vi
cinity. The petrifaction seems to have oc
curred suddenly, for the clams are in va
rious and lifelike positions. Many have
their necks out of the shells. .

ENCOUNTER HARDSHIPS
IN ALASKAN WASTES
Members of. the Norman Mining Ex
pedition Claim They Have Found
an El 'Dorado.
SEATTLE, April 2.â A story of adven
tur^, .tragedy and hardship, having as a
scene of action the' Bering' Sea and the
Kuskokwim country in Alaska, is told by
' Captain E. Erickson and J. B. Rawlings,
recorder of the Norman mining district.
They declare that the 'Kuskokwim coun
try is the coming gold producing section
of Alaska.
â¢ The Norman mining expedition was or
ganized by tnesei two men and Â¦ fourteen
others. They purchased the twelve-ton
schooner Bear and left Nome on July 17
for the Kuskokwim River. At Nunivak
they found I the barkentine Leslie D
wrecked on a lock. None of the miners
would take possession of the wreck, and
Captain Erickson was compelled to . sail
away, although he knew that the provi
sions on board the barkentine would soon
be badly needed by the ; party. They
reached the Kuskokwim at the end of
July, where half the party was left, the
others >Â¦ going with the -Bear back to the
wreck for Â¦ supplies. Another party was
found In Â¦ possession of the Leslie . D," and
for a time it seemed as If there would, be
a conflict between the rival captains. A
search for food was then made at Togiak
River, and to the Joy of all it was suc
cessful.
In the meantime those of the expedition
who had remained at Kuskokwim found
coarse gold in paying quantities forty
miles up -the river. 'When the schooner re
turned after a long absence with a small
supply of provisions the miners; who had
been suffering from lack of food, orga
nized the Norman district and elected
Rawlings recorder. <â¢>

under tne Circumstances, In order, not to
parade too publicly at this stage his am-
Ditions. Mr. Shorirldge, however, to-day
formally announced publicly .his cand<
dacy for X'nited States Senator.
"1 confess that'euch an honor would be
appreciated by me," said he, "and I in
tend to do my utpjost at the next regular
session of- tne Legislature to' carry ot
the prize. I 'have In the past been of some
service to the Kepublican party and have
never asked ior any reward. '
"So tar as this section of the State is
concerned," added Mr. Shortridge, Â¦ "1
wquld, were i a member of the United
States Senate, do -what I could toward
securing an appropriation for a large ar
tillery post at San Pedro. Such a post
will have to be maintained there shortly
to protectthe breakwater now being con
structed by the- Government and the cli
matic conditions "down here are such that
the proposed site would be an ideal one
for the purpose. Ultimately, i expect to
eee San Pedro obtain a big part of the
Government, transport service, and its
share of the trans-Pacific trade, whic 1 !
now goes elsewhere. 1 believe in the im
provement of â¢ the rivers and harbors of
the country and would, if elected a Sena
tor, do what I could to have - Calif Ornia
obtain all the funds necessary tor this
purpose." Â¦ ' â¢
Mr. Shortridge said that while th3
knowledge had not come to him at firu
hand, he had every" reason, for believing
that Senator Perkins expected to be a
candidate for re-election.' and he believed
that San Francisco should by right have
one of the' two Senators, being inclined to
concede, Mr. Shortridge intimated, the
governorship next year to this end of the
State. The speaker had no hesitancy '"
saying that the Republican members ol
the Legislature from : San Francisco
would, two yearF hence, be for him for
Senator to a man.
..Questioned as to whether he is a can

ceed James D. Phelan in November, Mr.

SACRAMENTO, April . 2.â Grove L.
Johnson, a member of the legislative com
mittee on the Sacramento reception to
President' McKinley, has asked for the co
operation of the Municipal Board of Trus
tees in a plan which provides for the hold
ing of an exclusive reception in the As
sembly Chamber. According to the sug
gestion of Assemblyman - Johnson, â¢ the
State Capitol is to be locked throughout
and admission is to be had through only
one entrance upon the presentation of in
vitatlops issued by the committee. 'Â¦ -
The suggestion to invest .the reception
to the President with the appearance 1 of
exclusiveness has -given 'rise to a,tremen
dous protest on the part of the public, and
it is even threatened that the Ohio So
ciety â¢ formed for the express purpose of
aiding In the entertainment of the Presi
dent at the Capitol will take action with
respect to it. Sacramentans recall the
visits of Presidents Grant, Hayes and
Harrison, when they were freely permit
ted to extend the "glad hand" direct, and
they rebel at i the suggestion * that they
may be denied the same privilege with
respect to President McKinley unless able
to secure favorable recognition at the
hands of the legislative committee. The
board of trustees, it is believed,. will de
cline to sanction the arrangement and all
hands^will be given an equal show at the
President If local sentiment is to prevail. â¢

GRASS VALLEY, April 2.â Tneoilor*
Schwartz, a pioneer rancher of Pleasant
Valley Nevada County, has a double who
not only goes about the State in the pre
tended garb of Mr. Schwartz, but carries
the logic of the situation so far as to con
tract bills in Mr. Schwartz's name and
make the arrangements for their payment
at thÂ« Pleasant Valley abode of the real
Mr. Schwartz. This double has thus im
personated the Pleasant Valley farmer
for years. Bill after bill has comÂ© to the
Schwartz home and his neighbors say
that they have come to be such a featura
of his dally life that the Schwartz house
hold would be lost without them.
Rev Wesley Peck of .Los Gatos former
ly lived In Grass Valley. Recently he re
ceived a visit from a man he believed to
be fanner Schwartz. The caller told his
host that he was a little short of cash
and he was promptly accommodated with,
$12 to pay his railroad fare to Grass Val
ley : He also represented to the minister
tha't he had been robbed of his clochinff
and spectacles in Watsonvllle. He needed
a pair of eyeglasses so that he could sea
to sign a^recelpt for the money. Mr. Peclc
took compassion upon him and lent tnÂ«
visitor his own eyeglasses. v_
Some days having elapsed without thÂ«
malls bringing him a $12 check or the re
turn of his glasses, the good pastor wrota
to Mr. Schwartz calling his attention to>
the oversight. The Pleasant Valley farm
er has added this little reminder to other
souvenirs contributed by Mr. Schwarta
No. 2. â¢ . .,
Mr Schwartz has never seen his doubla
nor been able to catch him, but evidently
the fellow intends to make the most oC
his resemblance to the Nevada County
farmer. â¢..

BRUNSWICK DEFEATS
THE GRACK CORRIGAN
Long Shots -Get, Everything in Sight at
Tanforanâ Marty Bergen First on
Silvertjarterâ Olinthus Has a Fall
BY F. E. MULHOLIAND.
/=V AM HILDRETH stepped up to the
il-, bargain counter at Tanfo ran Park
' â 5^k yesterday and made a very proflt-
able purchase.' Just before the
two-year-old event was called,
Sam purchased Brunswick from trainer
William Murry for $3000, and. then , went
in the ring and bet enough on the young
ster at .odds of 6 to 1 to nearly,, wtn him
out. Barney Schreiber's black colt Corri
gan was' a wafm favorite for the scram-,
ble, with Domlnick on his back. Away
eighth, he took none too friendly to the
sloppy goi^g, and in. a hustling finish
Henry got Brunswick over the line first
by half a length in forty-nine seconds.
The winner,, a chestnut gelding by St.
Carle- Sloe, has shown some very fast
trials, and if he can handle weight and
go on, may cause trouble' down the line.
Not a tavorite escaped the slaughter,
which was something terrific. First came
Nilgar at 7 to 1, followed In succession by
Silver Garter, Brunswick, Granger,
Twinkler and Ada N, all at ripe, mellow
odds: Nilgar and Brunswick were the
only ones backed to any extent. ,
With the^ bulk of the coin played on
Midian, William F and Dare II, Nilgar
at odds of 7 spreadeagled his field in the
opening mile and a sixteenth selling run.
The winner was ridden by Hafley, a clever
exercise boy, who is occasionally seen in
the saddle. Estro. a 30 to 1 shot, finished
in front of Dare for the place. Midian,
the favorite, bled and was pulled up.
Marty Bergen, with the leg up on Silver
Garter, a 15 to 1 shot, turned up an easy
winner of the six furlong run following.
Bergen got his mount away, raced Un
Cadeau to a standstill, and with plenty in
reserve led out Sugden, another outsider,
more than two lengths. Salvado, ridden
by Henry, ran into the show. Montallade
was installed favorite, although not fond
of moist going. He was away poorly, and
made no showing. .
The fifth jump proved fatal to Olinthus,
the 9 to 10 favorite for the mile and three
quarter hurdle number. While moving
along smoothly in third position, he over
jumped the obstacle and horse and rider
went sprawling in the mud. At the start
"Stew" Peters, astride the 12 to 1 chance,
Granger, went out in the lead, and was
never caught. J O C finished a close
second; while May Boy came home a dis
tant third.
Jockey Wedderstrand piloted his first
winner for some time in Twinkler, which
horse captured the mile and an eighth
affair decided under selling conditions, at
odds of- 10 and 12 to 1. 'Passing Don Luis
.before" .the -stretch s was reached, the
Brutus gelding fairly reveled in the
slushy footing, beating Lizella four
lengths at the wire. Merops Â¦ seems to
be of no account, for, again installed . a
favorite, he finished back in the ruck,
Pat Dunne's Bonnie- Lissak â¢ fell' easy
prey to Ada N in the closing seven furlong,
outing for fillies, with- but four facing the
Issue. The last time Ada N was out she
made a disgraceful showing 1 , but yester
day with Dominick up was touted as "oil
from the can." She experienced no diffi
culty' in heading Maresa, and won from
Ponnie in a common country jog. Sinn
apDeared outclassed.
Track Notes.
Lenhart, who rode Gilberto, had one leg
badly crushed when the horse fell taking
the last jump. The boy was removed to
a hospital. "

and is now ready to sail for Cape Town
with a load of lumber.
The McDonald may have been partly
dismasted In a sale, and if so she may
yet come into port. Again contrary winds
may have caused Captain Watts to come
via Cape of Good Hope, and in that event
sho is only about due. If, however, tho
coal cargo caught fire the chances for the
captain and crew showing up are not very

THE arrival of several of the over

pan and South America does not
tend to lessen the anxiety over the
failure of the American ship John
McDonald to put In an appearance at this
port. She is now out 202 days from Balti
more vrith a cargo of coal, and while the
p mount of insurance involved is not very
great, the underwriters are willing: to pay
a premium of 65 per cent to get rid of the
risk.
The John McDonald Is one of. the ves
sels purchased from Flint & Co. of New
York last year by the California Shipping
Company. This concern is now the larg
est owner of "wind Jammers" in the world
and carries its own insurance on the hulls.
Â¦When the May Flint was rammed by the
Iowa and sunk in the harbor the share

aging Owner Mighell remarking that the
money paid to Insure Its entire fleet for
a year would buy two new ships. The
cargo and freight money of the John Mc-
Donald is covered, however, and that sum
is what reinsurance is being paid on.
The bark Pactolus is also owned by the
California Shipping: Company and is com
manded by Captain Watts, a brother of
the master of the John McDonald. The
two had not met for years until Decem

found their vessels within a mile of each
other. For once 'the cape of storms was
in a kindly mood and there was no wind
and a smooth sea. Captain Watts of the
John McDonald signaled his brother to
come aboard, and the latter was not long
in Â»omplying. After an hour's chat a
breeze sprang up. so the brothers separ
ated. The John McDonald was under way
and several miles ahead before the cap

make a start. During the night the two
versels lost each other and the Pactolus

1 announced- that Â¦ Professor Shaler of Yale had"
in a '-.lecture '..declared, that science and inven
tion together '.-have so . improved the methods
snd the machinery used in gold Â¦ mining that
within a comparatively short time, the out
put of the precious metal will be so 'large
as to materially lower its value and consequently its
purchasing power as money. The statement coming
from a man of recognized authority on the subject
naturally gave ' rise to. a good deal of comment, but it
row appears the report was unauthorized arid inaccu
rate. Â¦ , ' **' 'Â¦ ' "'- ''Â¦ 'Â¦:Â¦'Â¦
. In a letter addressed to the Engineering News Pro
ifcEEorShaier in denying tne story. says: "In a regu
lar lecture to a class in geology; a lecture not intended
to, be made" public, I. made certain statements'con
cerning the future of gold production,. particularly in-,
dirated by the working of placer gravels. From this
lecture some student- has taken certain statements,,
which; presented without the context, give a very in
adequate idea of what I said. This unauthorized and
foolish statement was,' I believe, sold. r * .* * - .The
lecture was not a public lecture; the publication of the
matter was not only unauthorized but contrary to the
rules, which goven decent ' students, and, given with
out the . text, the statements give ; an essentially
roneous idea as to my views concerning the matter." :
As the report "was published throughout the coun
try generally, we give the correction in justice to Pro-'
fctsor Shaler and to the public. It-is to be'regretted,
however, that in his", explanation Professor Shaler did
nc t state exactly /what he did say, . so that an opinion Â¦
could be formed as ; to^ the degree -to which he was :
misrepresented. ' â¢ His statement ""that } he : believes' the Â¦
siory was^sold to the press .by; some student who : had .
n^ respect for : rules i which. govern ."decent. students''
implies ja. certain : irritability, of/temper that is not to ;
Hs credit, 'and it'may^be that; his. temper has led him
ty think himself much more' wronged than he has"
been. At any rate untiljie chooses "to inform the pub-;
lie' exactly. what his views are on the subject we shall
have to be content with his general denial and. wait for
further, information j until his lectures are published io
book form,.'- -
SHALER MAKES DENIAL.

The Russian plan of sending turbulent students to
join the army may have a good effect in quicting.the
universities, but it would seem to put a good deal of
unsafe material into the array.
Wu Ting Fang says that for 4000 years the Chinese
empire has never waged a war for the propagation of
religion or the enslavement of the people; and.it

Cities and towns in various parts of California
along the route of the President's tour have, under
taken to plant the vacant lots within their borders
with flowers to serve to grace the welcome of the
honored visitor; and when they see the good result it
will be in order for them to consider whether it would
not be worth while hereafter to make some such good
ure of their vacant lots every year. Why do every
thing for infrequent visitors? Why not make the home
town beautiful for the sake of home folks?
WH EN-,' discussing a few days ago the , proposed
amendment- of .the corporation laws" "of Â¦ Ne\v
Jertey The Call referred to a report that the
amendment was brought before the Legislature at the
dictation of the steel trust, and stated that there was
at that time no evidence to sustain the charge. It now
appears there must have been some truth in it, for the
amendment was adopted, and now the .trust, after
hanging in the air for weeks, has filed with the New
Jersey Secretary of State articles amending its char
ts and increasing its capital stock to $1,100,000,000.
The object of the amendment is to give the directors
greater power in handling the affairs of the enormous
combination. Originally the corporation couid not
mortgage or pledge any of its real property or any
"of the stock of another company controlled by it ex
cept by, the affirmative vote of the owners of two
thirds of the capital stock. Under the' new law it will
be necessary to. have the affirmative vote of only two
thirds of the stock represented at any meeting of the
corporation: Thus we have the big trust fully
launched with all its powers under easy control of its
When the country was first confronted by a Con-Â»
gress whose appropriations for governmental expendi
tures exceeded a billion dollars Speaker Reed com
forted the taxpayers by reminding them that this is a
billion dollar country. In the face of the new aggre
gation of capital in'the hands' of a comparatively small
number of enterprising men we may perhaps find con
solation in remembering iReed's statement.
The corporation which is now about to enter upon
active operations' that may powerfully affect the trade
and commerce of the whole country, if not the entire
globe, has been generally spoken of as "The Steel
Trust." That title was given to it by the press be
cause it began by. combining the great steel manufac
turing plants of the country and because a short title
was, necessary for convenience in speaking of it. It is
to be borne in mind,: however, that it is really much
more than a corporation formed to carry on the manu
facture of steel. The scope of its. charter comes very
rear being universal. It ha^ authority to engage in
almost any kind of business. , 1
The Chautauquan recently published 'what it termed
"a condensed statement of the grants made" -to tht
corporation, to this effect: "This corporation miy
manufacture ir^on, steel; manganese, coke, .copper,
lumber and other materials, and all articles consisting
or partly consisting of iron, steel, copper, wood, or
ether materials, and all products thereof. It has the
right to acquire and develop any lands yielding these
materials, and to extract coal, ores, stone, oil, etc..
from any lands' which it may own or acquire. It may
buy and sell these materials and/any of their products,
and it may construct bridges, buildings, machinery,
si-ips, boats, engines, cars and other equipment; rail
roads, docks; slips, elevators, water works, gas works
and electric works ; viaducts, . aqueducts, canals â¢ and
other waterways, and other means of- transportation"
These agencies may be bought or sold, maintained or
operated, but the corporation may not maintain a rail
road.or canal in New Jersey. This corporation may.
engage in any other manufacturing,' mining, construc
tion or "transportation business of any kind or char
acter whatsoever, but it may" not engage in any busi
ness which shall require the exercise of the, right of
."eminent domain within the State of New: Jersey. It
inay conduct its business, in other States and*Terri
tories and An foreign countries." 1 â¢
Such being the comprehensive. nature of the grant,
it i a not surprising to learn that the directors are try
ing to effect further combinations and are even nego
tiating forcontrol of the Panama canal route with
the intention of- constructing, an isthmian waterway
THE BULLION-DOLLAR TRUST.
THE HORRORS Op WflR.
IT is customary to put great stress upon the.carnage
of war. It is in its aspect as a destroyer of life that
war presents its abhorrent feature.
We have had a large army fighting in the Philip
pines for more than two years.' The deaths in that
sriny in the islands number 6000. It is a large list and
serves properly to give point to^ many an argument
against war. Each of those lives has a fixed eco
romic value to the country. That value is so much
lost energy, so much capital destroyed, so much force
gone out of the body politic never to return.
But, going to the criminal records at home for "the
same two years, it appears that in the United States
there were committed 10,000 murders. Ten thousand
lives wereÂ«ended by knife, pistol and poison! Close
to twice as many lives lost by crime at home as by
w<.r abroad. If the death penalty had followed in each
case of course nearly 10,000 murderers would have
l-een hanged, bringing the total casualty list up to a
still larger excess over the casualties of war. "â¢ "
Among the victims was one Governor of a State, a
State Attorney General, and a large number of minor
crficers of the law. ' .
In numerous lynchings twenty men have been
burred at the stake, and several ' women have been
shct to death.
In no other country in the world is there as much
murder, as much taking of human life in the commis
tion of other crimes, and for other. causes, many the
most trivial. Soon the question may be asked, "What
is the matter with the United States?"
We have been unsparing critics of other countries
ana have sent missionaries among the heathen. May
it :<ot well be that others may object on good ground?
against receiving a S3 r stem that makes no better show
ing at home?
It is the habit of a people to look to the social
state from which propagandists emerge in search 01
proselytes. If that state is found infirm, if life is dis
regarded, bloodshed is common, the law is displaced
by savage mob violence, it is but natural to reject the
missionary it sends forth.
We have Â«hown great zeal and have encountered
great troubles in carrying Christianity into .China.
The Chinese, looking upon our domestic record, have
the right to say that the missionaries must have ear
ned Christianity away from this country. In that view
o\ it we. should recall the missionaries and refuse to
permit further export of the stock until it has accu
muiated enough for home consumption.

THE COAST ROA pj BANQUET.
SAN JOSE has celebrated the opening of. the
through line along, the Coast road by a;ban
quet,?at which her. citizens and their guests
congratulated themselves and one another upon the
change which the new route has made in the commer
cial situation of the city. Beforethe road'was opened
San. Jose was in' a pocket, and all the rich territory
along the coast from San. Francisco. to Los Angeles
wps- commercially sidetracked. To-day . that region
is traversed by a' road which* will doubtless be' the
nuin line for transcontinental \ travel' between ; j San
Francisco "arid- the East, and\ San Jose finds herself
holding an important rind advantageous position upon
the route. Under such circumstances it is natural
there. should be much felicitation among the people,
.and with her customary hospitality San Jose invited
outsiders to come and share the joy of the occasion
with her.'
"While all the speeches that followed the banquet
were excellent, that of J.C.Stubbs, third vice presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company, was the most
interesting because he was expected to declare tho
policy of the company with respect' to the manage
ir;ent of the hew'route.. That he would not make
definite promises of any particular, policy was' of course
to beexpected, but it is "gratifying, that what he did
s;y gives encouragement. to the hopes of those who
have believed the new - road will be of immediate
frciiefit'.to San Jose and to the State. : i
After regretting the absence of '/â¢â¢ President Hays
from the banquet; paying^a tribute to the memory 'of--
Huntingdon and emphasizing "that fact that San Jose
iv now: "on the through route between the Occident,
and the Orient," he went on to' say: ; "Mr. Chairman,
I believe\the future for: this community,. and for- this'
valley; look's brighter > than i everj Â¦Â¦before',, and though
nc* in whole nor in greater part.due to the. completion
of this .road, yet the enterpri/e ; which .we -are ;cele
brating is .auspicious. :â¢ It will i measurably con
tribute to the peace and prosperity of this, the fairest
of : California"*^ fair lands. ' \ I ? believe ; that out* of the
experience and 'tribulations ofthis season a' remedy
will be found for the discouragements and ills of the â¢
prune-growers. . I believe it is the -purpose of Presi
dent Hays to address himself to the inquiry as to what
e> tent his : administration of the-affairs 'of the Sbuth r
err. Pacific Company 'can* promot* the interests ami
better the' conditions of the fruit-growers.; I am per
svoded that neither you nor the railroad people will
c* er have occasion to"- regret the : completion - of ' the
coast line, even as we are who are your guests to
night will not forget your hospitality, will never cease
to desire and work for your prosperity and go-od will."
A statement of that kind from a high official : qf the;
Southern Pacific Company, ought to mean something
more than .an . . after-dinner jubilation; It ought to ;
mean in all sincerity- that .President Hays as the hew\
manager of the road is -'-'to address ., himself to the in
quiry as to what ."extent his administration of the af
fairs of. the .Southern Pacific Company.xan , promote;
tllt^iriterestsland -.better the Â¦conditions,"! .-not of ' : ttie"r
fi uit-growers ,only, specified by Mir. Stubbs doubtless'
out of deference to the audience he was addressing,
bVt of the. whole people of California. , Should. tHat
hejthe case hot only will the counties along' the coast
toad be benefited by the closing of the gap, but
the whole commonwealth will have reason to rejoice
in the new order of things.
In his tribute to Huntington Mr. Stubbs overlooked
the fact that the quarrel of the people against his
management was not becaitse they did not appreciate
his greatness in constructing the road, but because
after constructing it he used it not for California but,
against California? -Under the new management
there is a promise and a prospect that the road will
be used to promote Californian- industries, and it is
because of the trust the people have'in those promises
that they have so jubilantly celebrated the opening
cri the new route. "Â¦ . ' ' â¢
Bejween the State and the railroads that connect it
with the East there is a natural mutuality of interest,

stances:. In October, 1900, prizes to the
value of $100 were distributed at the close
of a "flower and vegetable contest,'* to
which all the pupils of the public schools
of Carthage, Mo., were eligible, except the
children of professional florists or garden
ers. Prizes were offered for boys' vegetable
gardens, for general vine planting, for the
greatest . "improvement in the appearance
of homes by artistic use of vines,"
for aster growing and for aster bouquets.
Also during tho last. summer the South
Park^ Improvement Club of Dayton, Ohio,
offered a series of prizes for front and
side yards, back yards, vine planting,
window and porch- boxes, boys' vegetable
gardens, vacant lots, best planted prem
ises along steam railroads, best floral di
vision between yards and, best general ap-

Good Taste Is; a Requisite.
Ihec.hief objection brought to bear by
the ordinary householder when his wife
ond daughter want to plant something is
the. Increased difficulty of manipulating
'Â¦, the lawn mowerâ the favorite suburban
household god, which prefers a straight to
a devious path. To spangle his grounds
with bushes to be dodged, after the pres
ent-accepted manner of distributing trees'
.ajid shrubbery, would furnish him with a
legitimate grievance. There are -enough
fraful examples ready made to last for a
generation. To construct another would
*be a bitter irony that any self-respecting
club may well wish to escape.
Â¦ Once change the regulation polka-dotted
dooryard to an open lawn outlined and
framed by massed shrubbery and the de
lighted man of the house will never allow
the speckled effect to be repeated on hi*
premises. If it is so" great an advantage
from the purely . utilitarian viewpoint of
the manipulator of the lawn mower,' how
much greater from tne higher point of
view, of esthetic beautv, from the actual
pleasure of something charming to look
at every day in the year from one's own
windows? Is not a smr.ll expanse of fresh
green turf across which the shadows come
and go better than the hit-and-miss style?
. Try it. Shrubs and Dlants gathered to
gether in a border of irregular width arc
not only more beautiful in themselves and
well out of the way of the lawn mower,
but they are far more easily cared for
than when scattered about. They should
all be hardy plants and they should all b<j
planted in a carefullv prepared bed,
straight on Its outer boundary , next to
street or division fence and irregular on
Its Inner boundary against the lawn. In
such a big bed, so unliKe the ordinary
flower bed, may be gathered many flower-
Ing shrubs that should be chosÂ«n to give
bloom at different seasons, some small
trees at the back of vhe border, where
there is room without too greatly crowd
ing or shading plants ri smaller size, and
enough herbaceous peiennials, such us
irises, oriental popples, peonies, delphin
iums, phloxes, Japanese anemones and
dozens of others just as lovely but less
well known, to give a succession of flow
ers from June tl'l frost cuts the last lin

so to speak, by using early flowering
bulbs, such as scillas, snowdrops, crocuses
and narcissus. Nor should summer flow
ering bulbs be omitted.. Some of the best
lilies are also the hardiest and they thrive
better and look better 'In such a border
than anywhere else.
Following Nature's Plan.
I Just you try this plan. Big or little, any
garden so arranged !s far and away ahead
of the crammed and disorderly array of
individual shrub3 usually found scattered
about what should be an open lawn. Now,
when the border is made and the shrubs
set out, do give the poor things a chance
for their lives. That Is do not try to im
prove on nature's plan of making each
species and often each variety unlike all
other species: do not try to carve them
all into the same form. Let them alone
till they have an opportunity to show their
characteristicsâ show what they were in
tended to be like. .By the time they havo
accomplished this their own style will be
found so much better than anything that
can be imparted with pruning shears that
their future will be secure. Every two
or three years the oldest wood can be cu;
out entirely and the new allowed to tako
its place; such pruning as that Is legiti
mate and so Is the removal of dead woid
or . of branches that make the bush too
close and dense. But cutting off the end
of every twig or branch id a vain attempt
to create a growing baseball or some other
equally interesting curiosityâ bah! That Is
not pruning. Don't think it for a minute.
No such shrubs are to be found in the
paintings by Corot, of Tyron, of any land
scape painter worthy the name. What Is
beautiful on canvas is also beautiful in
itself. The painters get their inspiration
from things that grow in the wilds.
In the Interests of Privacy.
.The massing of shrubs In bordering beds
or plantations may also serve the useful
purpose of shield and buckler against the
too inquiring windows of one's next door
neighbor, especially if, as is the pleasant
fashion of the day, they immediately over
look one's bit of lawn. A screen of this
sort is grateful to both parties to the suit,
shielding those inside the windows and
those on the adjoining lawn, as well as
making an agreeable outlook from either
situation. It Is not a disagreeable expe
rience to open a window -to the delicious
fragrance of blossoming honeysuckles or
the exquisite color of sheets of clematis
blooms; andlt is, on the other hand, pure
delight to sit on one's own veranda and
watch the swaying wands of a gracefully
drooping, snowy white syringa (not "trim
med up") In full flower. In short, there
are undreamed of possibilities In pur door
yards, both front and back, and neither
club nor individual can find a more legiti
mate field of action than . in their artistic
development. Such work will cheer more
hearts, brighten more lives and improve
more morals than any other line of club
work. Its basis is improved sanitary con
ditions, yet, like kindergarten work, the
participants in the labor and in the" re
sults are under the impression that they
are merely seeking and finding pleasant
recreation. '
I That women's clubs have already â¢ taken
up this sort of work is one of the encour
aging signs that they are wisely endeav
oring to benefit humanity. This work
reaches the foundation of the matter, for
it begins In the homes of the people and
results in a betterment of the dally sur
roundings of the masses. In the suburb*
of. cities,- in towns, in villages and in the
country such- work 'Is Important.' Every
where a. -pleasant, wholesome dally. life is
desirable, and nowhere are the common
decencies, the simple, pleasures, the quiet
beauty easily attainable and the birth
right of all more ' neglected, overlooked
and too frequently deliberately spoiled for
an entire community than in small places.
;.â¢;â¢.-. The Beauty of Running Water. I
That this is true may be. noted in one
class of neglect, or worse than neglect, In
innumerable .places j that " the Â¦ reader I wtll
readily call to mindâ the abuse of natural
streams. In~ the country, .far .j from, the
abodes of men, they are invariably beau
tiful, pure and Â» in Â» every way desirable;
they approach . the town, village or habi
tation only ' to lose all that made their
presence charming.' No one thinks of pro
tecting their beauty or their purity; on
the contrary, every one feels at liberty to
mar the one and '.pollute the other. Any
thing may be thrown into the stream and
everything is dumped upon its erstwhile
pleasant. banks, what m!ght and should
be retained and protected as - the chief
beauty and . advantage ; of? the town â¢ or
home . thus speedily â¢ becomes â¢ an ' eyesore
and a detriment. The pretty shrubs and
plants and \ greensward 'that 'loved the
stream, was refreshed by it and meant to
keep ' it continual ' company : are cut away

abundance of dumped debris of the most
unsightly and often .unsanitary character,
,VII.â BEAUTIFYING* HOME STJBBOU2EDINGS.
(COPYRIGHT. 1901.)
: While . public-spirited men and women
are undertaking to Improve the^ general
appearance of large- cities by banding
themselves Into 'civic leagues, municipal
art -y associations and similar bodies, It
cannot be too strongly asserted that there
is equal '.'. necessity.; for developing, latent
possibilities along similar lines in city
suburbs,' towns, villages and country
neighborhoods. "" ... '
Â¦ The simple beauty : of trees and grass
claim Instant attention from city people
of all; stations, but the more meager or
squalid their home surroundings the more
marked is this recognition. Oftentimes
those who are accustomed .to these two
fundamental elements of natural beauty,
pro wing neglectful, allow their imme
diate environment to lapse into barren
squalor. It may be that such- examples
should be credited to a too great familiar
ity with, nature, but it seems more prob
able that it is the result of individual de
terioration. It would appear, both safer
andpleasanter to encourage the most fa
miliar acquaintance with the wholesome
freshness of growing greenery and bloom
than to suffer increasing contempt by the
too close approach of tin cans and ash
heaps. ' '. '.. ' -
-There are already many improvement
societies, clubs and associations scattered
throughout the United States; there are
also a' still greater number of women's
clubs; The latter in some instances have
been inSDlred to forsake literature,, art
and the sciences to. devote their efforts to
the betterment of the daily surroundings
j in their own communities. ., .
' Taking Up This: Important Work.
; "Women's clubs can do practical work in
the line of suburban, village, town or
neighborhood improvement either By aid
ing as organizations in the plans of estab
lished ' improvement societies, by making
improvement' work a branch of their own
plans, or by boldly adopting it as the end
and aim. of club existence for a year or
longer, as requirements may dictate. In
most localities, however, the amelioration
of existing conditions of dally life is so
clearly, the one important question that
doubtless most clubs that give the matter
consideration will determine it the better
part to devote. their entire energy * to it.
Probably after one or two years of such
faithful effort subsequent work may safe
ly be delegated to a capable committee.
â¢ In undertaking- Improvement work
women's clubs can hardiy do better than
follow in a general way the lead of prom
inent and successful" improvement organi
zations such as the Laurel Hill Society of
Stockbridge, Mass., the Beverly (Mass.)
Improvement Society, the Town Improve
ment Association of Montclair, N. J., and
others, while fitting the details of such
effort to local necessiiies and opportuni
ties. ; Indeed; such organizations are tho
natural outgrowth of local conditions.
Among those \ cited a typhoid I epidemic,
due to impure milk disseminated from a
dairy situated amid fcul surroundings,
aroused the mothers of the town to the
necessity for sanitation and a greater
knowledge .of the sources of family sup
plies, as well as to a realization of tho
fact that the four walls of a home fail
to encompass the factors that make for
the health and happmeps of a household,
and that their responsibilities extended
beyond such clearly defined limits. In. on
other instance one woman's longing for
something beautiful within reach, of her
own home; for sweetness, neatness and
order In the streets that formed her dally
environment, was the .eaven from which
rose what is claimed to be the first, and Is
still among the foremost, among improve
ment associations in this country.
- .Watchword of .These Societies. Â¦
/"To make our town (or village ;or sub
urb) a better, more wholesome and more
attractive â¢ place - of ' residence" is In one
form or another the watchword of every
efficient band of improvement workers,
and no club of women needs a better
slogan. â¢ *
"As has been intimated, conditions in
every case must govern the choice of the
first work to be : done. * Good roads or
streets and sanitation and cleanliness and
order "from : the middle of the street to
the middle of the alley" is the basis of
satisfactory results. It-were folly to spend
time, labor and money on purely decor
ative features before considering and con
quering the question of . the disposal of
garbage. If anything must wait let it be
the front yards. A back yard crusade is
an essential preliminary. Properly'devel
oped the back yards would transform the
lives of thousands from a dreary grind of
drudgery to countless summers of sweet
ness and light. If women possessed of the
brains,, time and money to accomplish
such an end can find better scope for ef
fort, where is it? â¢ v â¢ Â¦-
On the hygienic foundation ,of cleanli
ness and order- suggested: may 'lie 'built a
fair. superstructure consisting of number
less factors blended into a more or' less
harmonious picture, according to the ar
tistic excellence of the design used. It is
to be composed of pleasantly shaded
streets, charmingly planted home grounds,
properly located and well arranged - pubÂ»
lie parks end playgrounis, correctly treat
ed spaces around - public buildings,
churches, schoolhouses. mills and facto
ries; neatly kopt vacant property, a-gen
eral absence 'of flying-papers and rubbish'
and svreet relief from screaming bill
boards. All this may be further embel
lished by fountains, memorial tablets -3nd
carefully considered statuary, by hand
some boulevards, correctly designed cem
eteries, .attractively planted : ' station
grounds, railway rights of way redeemed
from unsightl.hieRS and made to stand as
pemotual advertisements* to. the constant
ly; passing public of th<Â» character of the
place and by lo\ely approaches over good,
hard roads that wind among shade trees
and flowery . banks all planted ' with the
native trees, shrubs and vines thai thrive
in each vicinity. This : does not, exhaust
the opportunities j offered by the ordinary
â¢village: or suburb,. but serves to suggest
that there is no lack of good things to be
done by the clubs that choose to â¢ try this
sort of thing â and may their name be le
gion.
Women's Clubs Fitted for the Task.
: No .women's club n^etl falter or fear' to
take such work-in hand. ' Such "clubs are
splendidly equipped for it. They have the
ability ' to direct, the energy to accom
plish, the tact, discretion and determina
tion to succeed. 1 They can secure land for
parks and playgrounds, or see that street
tree planting is done in accordance -with
the best modern knowledge of the sub
ject; they can raise money and pass or
dinances, - or see that they are -passed;
they can disarm objections Â¦ and : make
squalid dooryards unfashionable; they can
banish all . unslghtllness and make the
waste places charming; they may, if they
will, even go the length of securing artis
tic landscape gardening .plans ' for . the
beautifying of a -block, -a street or an en
tire'town, so that when such plans are
correctly . developed their own " Â¦ several
home s grounds shall each be a picture of
comfort as well as a factor In a large gen
eral' scheme â¢ that shall make their town
famous. - All this â¢ and > much more can be
accomplished , by any club, the members
of which look about them' and see that it
is a good thing to make the world. more
beautiful i for â¢ themselves "and for < others
who . , are perhaps . Ies3 : , fortunate. In
short, -the scope- and possible results of
such work should satisfy the most ambi
tious club, i. * .":./"'Â¦". â¢'Â¦.â¢.'Â¦<Â¦Â¦.Â¦ â¢ ' .

'Â¦Â¦I .: H E Consuls ' of . the United States ; make regular
I reports of; the progress abroad of the: policy of
*Â¦ municipal ownership Â¦ of ' public service indus
tries.. , "-.:â¢
As we have already said, all the quoted . cases must
be examined individually and judged by. the local con
ditions, physical l and other, which prevail at the scene
of each experiment. The last case reported relates to
street railways. The- /city of, Liege, Belgium,- has^
bought the street railway. The system has "seven
miles* of track, runs about forty cars and employs 250
men; The city leases it for a term' of years' to accom
pany, for a graduated rental on a sliding scale, to in
crease with, the business and receipts. . The. city, also
puts down all sidings and extensions and does all new
wprk, and furnishes the rolling stock. The lessee
keeps the property in repair. The fare charged by. the
corporation which the city succeeds was affected by
distance,' being about one penny minimum arid four,
cents maximum. The city enforces a uniform fare of
two cents. Â¦ The data , furnished do not enable any!
calculation, to' show whether the new rate is an aver
age increase or'an average decrease in the fare. 1 That
will depend upon'whether a majority of the fares are
paid for the short or the long haul. If the latter the
xÂ«ew rate is an average reduction. If the former it is
an avefage increase. The new rate doubles after 11
o'clock at night, which brings all fares after that hour
up to, the former maximum . for all hours. The re
sults of this must be- determined by the nocturnal
habits of the people.
In another respect the change has not as pleasant
an aspect as is presented by a possible reduction in
rates. Under the corporation control the maximum
pay of the men employed was $i 06 for a day of nine
hours. Considering the price of living, and measured
by wages on the Continent, that was a. fair average
compensation. But now the city controls the rate of
wages as well as the rate of fare, and has put the maxi
mum pay of the employes at 72 cents for a day of nine
hours. We think this reduction, measured again by^
Continental wages, is excessive. The city of Glasgow
reduced fares and wages upon becoming owner of the
street, railways, but the new wage scale there was
hardly down to the Liege level. ?
In discussing this subject in the United States it
is customary to dwell upon the, reduction in price to
the user of public service industries, and in that way
American expectation is somewhat unduly aroused
as to contemplated benefits.
But as in Europe every instance ; of municipal
ownership and reduction in rates has been accom
panied by a larger reduction in wages, it is entirely
proper to inquire whether in this country there will be
any exception. Before experiments on a large scale
r.re undertaken it is well to know -whether public
ownership, to realize the expectation of the.econo
mists, must result in lower wages for the labor.em
ployed. : : '.^...i, ...'/] -' : : '-.: '/ "....''
failure.
It is a very important phase of the question with us.
The whole wage scale will be unfavorably affected by
reduction in the pay of several hundred thousand em
ployes on street railroads. It is an economic question
thai is far-reaching. People are drawn to the support
of public 'ownership by the belief that ', it will reduce
the earnings of capital. ' But if it /reduce also the

and her two sons objected to Maxwell's
attentions and he was forced to leave the
house and seek a room elsewhere. He
and the girl met occasionally surrepti
tiously, but when the brothers discovered
it the girl was kept under surveillance.

The Judge questioned Baker and got him
to admit that all he wanted was to have
Maxwell arrested bo that he could "have
the law on him." The Judge continued
the case till May.l and allowed Maxwell
to go on his own recognizance.

TACOMA, April 2.â Sta^e Pure Food
Commissioner McDonald Is preparing a
list of his rulings preparatory to a strict
enforcement of the pure food law passed
by the last Legislature. A similar law
passed two years ago was a dead letter
because its provisions were conflicting.
The new measure is very explicit and un
der it California and Eastern wholesalers
shipping goods to this State must use con
siderable care if they would avoid prose
cution.
The new law clearly, defines the manner
in which compounds shall be marked with
a stamp of their ingredients, and there is
no possibility under its provisions of sell
ing adulterated food products without be
ing liable for punishment. Any person is
permitted to purchase a portion of a
manufactured product for analysis and if
the product is found to contain impuri
ties and not to be properly marked prose
cution may follow.
Protection for the, retailer is provided.
He may demand /a guarantee of the
wholesaler that the article meet the re
quirements of the State law. In case he
is .provided with such guarantee and a
chemical .analysis shows the goods are
impure the wholesaler will be prosecuted.
If the retailer sells impure goods without
a guarantee of their purity he himself be
comes* liable. . Â¦ - Â¦

Local Hide dealers are quoting a very un
satisfactory market, with weak prices and ac

change worthy, of note. Tallow Is steady and
unchanged.
Wool continues dull. Fall clips are cleaned

identical. The situation- Is , not very encour
aging.
Hops are - quoted very strong, with buyers
bidding 15c for new crop in Oregon, and offer-"
ing advances of 10@12c on contracts. They are
getting" very few, however. The old stock is
well cleaned up, and there are few lots left in

POSTAL CXERK CTTNANE â¢
SWEACRS TO HIS STORY
Denies That he Stole Five Dollars Out
1 of a Letter in Sta-
, tion D.
The case of the United States against
Postal Clerk Frank Peter Joseph Cunane
will be submitted to the jury this morning
In the United States District Court., Cu
nane was arrested between 11:30 and mid
night on November 9 last by Postofflce
Inspector L. H. Bricker in Station D. A
marked five-dollar, gold piece that had
been placed in a dummy letter was found
in his possession, and he was indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury for stealing
money from the mails. ' i , A tU
Postofflce Inspector Bricker â¢ told the
jury that several complaints ' had been
made that letters containing money had
failed to reach their destination. After
considerable detective work Mr. Bricker
traced the leakage, to Station D, at the
ferry, and a watch was set upon young
Cunane. Â¦ Â¦ . i Tl i.'^r- v 'l
' When the watchers were convinced that
the time was propitious Bricker Bprang
from his place. of concealment and de
manded the five-dollar piece. As soon as
the demand was made Cunane placed his
hand in his vest and attempted to throw
something away. He was immediately
seized by Bricker and others and thrown
to the floor, and the gold piece and some
loose sliver fell to the ground and were
recovered by Bricker. Cunane attempted
to escape by running, but was overtaken
and caught. â¢ . , , ,,
Cunane took the stand yesterday after
noon and swore that while he was sorting
letters he saw the marked, coin on the
floor. He pipked it up and put It into his
pocket, the foreman being absent, intend
ing to notify the foreman on his return.
Then Bricker caught hold of him and was
about to search him and Cunane resisted.
He ran because he was confused. The
witness denied positively that he took the
money out of the letter. . -. . : ;

OLD-TIME MERCHANT
. .;. . r : DIES, IN ALAMEDA
Passing, of Dean B. Avery, Who Wa*s
Long* Identified With Business
in This City.
Dean R. Avery, who has been.- actively
identified with the" business life of San
Francisco for, a period of about - forty
years, died at his. residence, 2021 San An
tonio avenue, Alameda, yesterday, after a
long illness. Â¦'â¢-Â¦'.
Mr. Avery came to San Francisco in th->
early fifties and began business' in this
city. Many years ago he conducted a
business in the old Center Market on Sut
ter street and Grant avenue and he con
tlned there until the market was closed
He thÂ«n was one of a number to Join Jn
leasing - the premises now known as trie
Union Square Market, on O'Farrell and
Powell streets. He was active until about
a year ago, when he was taken with what
-was not at first considered to be a serious
illness. He went to his home In Alameda
for rest and to recuperate. He had spelT*
of seeming improvement, but he grew
steadily weaker until he died.
Mr. Avery was a native of Groton, Con
necticut, where he has four sisters. Mm.
Avery and five children survive him,
Dean, William, Julia, Lillian and El
dridge.. The rare amiability of disposition
which characterized Mr. Avery, together
Â¦with his -well-known generosity and abso
lute fairness in all the transactions of
life, gave him a legion of friends. There
are few men in the city who would be
more widely missed. ...
The funeral services at â¢ the Alameda
home will take place to-morrow ' after
noon at 12:30. Rev. Dr. Cherington of thy
Plymouth Congregational Church of this
city will conduct them. Brief services,
conducted by Apollo Lodge of Odd Fel
lows, of which Mr. Avery was a member,
w~i be held at the Odd Fellows' Ceme
tery.
Alameda Bookkeeper Injured.
A- Stenditz, a bookkeeper, residing In
Alarseda, was knocked down by a Mar
ket-street car near the ferry last night
and severely injured. Stenditz alighted
from one car and was struck by another
on the opposite track. H*. was taken to
the harbor hospital.
Kimball Sent to Oakland.
The story told by Frank KImball,. who
went to the Receiving Hospital yesterday
to have a bullet wound in his right arm
dressed, was not believed by Captain Spil
lane and he sent Kimball to report to Cap
tain Seymour and the latter sent him to
report to the Oakland police- Kimball
said the wound was inflicted accidentally
by an Oakland doctor. He stated at first
that he shot himself accidentally and.it
was this contradictory ". statement that
caused Spillane to become suspicious.-. \
SOLDIERS PROFIT BY
HOTEL CTiERK'S ERROR
Deposited Moray Orders Returned
and With Them Their. Face
Value in Cash. â¢
The management of. the Winchester
Hotel, at the corner of Third and Steven
son streets. Is bemoaning the loss of $215,
which was obtained by i two discharged
soldiers through the mistake of a clerk.
Detective Ross Whitaker has been set on
the trail ' of the men by Chief Sullivan,
but it is believed that they have already
made their escape. _
Monday night Joseph W. Peterman and
J. L. Greenfield, who were discharged
from the Twenty-seventh -Infantry during
the day, went to the hotel and rented
rooms. The first of the two deposited a
money orders for $125 and the latter one
for $90. The clerk made a record of the
deposits In such a manner that the day
clerk believed the men had placed both
coin and money orders, and in addition to
the papers gave them $215. Neither at
tempted to rectify the error, and it was
not discovered until the bookkeeper made
up his cash account later In the day. ,
Laundry Employes Reply.
The employes of the .aundries object to
the statement of laundrv proprietors to
the effect that the increase in charges
for laundry Â¦work, which went into effect
Monday, is due entirely to the recent in
crease of wages upon demand of the
Steam Laundry Workers' -Union. They
contend that the profits of the business
are enormous and that the increase In
wages has not made necessary an increase
in charges. Thomas Bersford, secretary
of the union, points to tho fact that East
em laundries pay better wages and their
scale of charges ranges lower.
Waitresses Organize.
A Waitresses' Union was organized last
night at 827 Mission street with sixty
three names. This branch will affiliate
with the male Waiters' Union. The lat
ter closed its charter last night with 1721
members. Another meeting of this union
will be held to-night at 102 O'Farrell
street, when a schedule of wages and
hours of labor will be prepared and pre
sented to the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil for its approval.
Boycott of Breweries.
The executive committee of the Building
Trades Council at its meeting last night
declared a boycott on the Gambrlnus and
Wenhard breweries of Portland and the
Star brewery of Vancouver, all of which
employ non-union labor.
The Architectural Iron Workers' Union
applied for admission to the council and
was accepted. . â¢ .
Metal-Workers' Strike.
The strike of the Metal Polishers. Buf

UNDERTAKERS OBJECT TO
BOTJXEVABD* ORDINANCE
Driver of a Wagon With Corpse in It
Arrested on Van Ness
Â¦ Avenue.
The Assistant Undertakers" Protective
Society will at to-night's meeting take
Fteps looking to the repeal or revision of
the boulevard ordinance for Van Ness
avenue. The movement originated from
an incident that occurred yesterday morn
ing.
An inquest was to be held at the Morgue
yesterday morning on the body of Frank
Drouth, which was in the undertaking
parlors of Carew & English, Van Ness
avenue. Timothy Brennan, a driver for
the lirm. placed the body in a wagon to
convey it to the Morgue. As he was driv
ing: along the avenue to Market street
Mounted Policeman Berry placed him un
der arrest and compelled him to drive to
the North End police station, where after
oonsMdprable delay Brennan was released
on $5 cash bail. . â¢ . -
The undertakers think that In their case
an exception should be made, and If. not
a tes=t oa?e will probably be taken to the
highest court.
FHILBBOOK MAKES HIS 1
OPENING STATEMENT
The Attorney Questions the "Regular
ity of the Drawing of the
Jury. . ."
Horace W. Philbrook .occupied a large
portion of the afternoon session in Judge
Murasky's court yesterday making his
opening statement In his action against
ex-Supreme Court Justice Van R. Pater
son, in which he prays judgment for $100,
000 damages for alleged slander. Philbrook
avers that Judge Paterson "said of and
concerning him, 'that man Philbrook is
insane.' "
During the morning session the work of
completing -the Jury was taken up. Phil
brook expressed the suspicion that an ef
fort was being made to tamper with the
jury. He called upon George W. Mon
teith, who is caring fop Philbrook' s inter
ests on the outside, to step inside the bar
and watch the drawing cf the jury.
"For " said Philbrook, "I am especially
anxious that these last few names should
be fairly drawn." .
Monteith stepped inside the bar, but
Mr Plllsbury objected to his action on the
ground that It was an insult to the court.
William S. Wood, who is associated with
the defense, also asked that if Monteith
was in court on behalf of Philbrook he be
instructed. to take his place at the plain
tiff's s'de. Judge Murasky forthwith or
dered Monteith outside the bar, where he
sat during the remainder of the session.
Early in the afternoon twelve jurors
were sworn -to try the case and Philbrook
made his statement. Through the wind
ings of his statement, whereby he endeav
ored to show the jury how he was injured
in the sum sued for by the alleged state
ment made by. Paterson, the. plaintiff,
Philbrook, took' occasion to attack the
majority of the -Justices on the Supreme
Court bench and reiterated the charges he
has been making for years against Judge
Ralph C. Harrison; questioned the integ
rity of E. S. Pillsbury, who appears for
Judge Â¦ Paterson, and asserted that Su
preme Court Decision Compiler Pomeroy
had lent himself to a conspiracy to mu
tilate a Supreme Court decision that the
Oakland Water . Front . Company might
come into possession of Â¦ tide lands, "al
though the Supreme Court in the mu
tilated decision had held that the State
had no power to deed away its lands be
tween the lines of high and Jow. tide."
The opening statement bristled with
charges of fraud and corruption. Superior
Court Judge Coffey came in for a share of
the charges and the railroad companies
for more. When Philbrook finished his
statement Judge Murasky ordered a con
tinuance until this morning, at which
time the plaintiff will call his first wit
ness. â¢ ..
KNOCKED TJNCONSCIOUS
BY WITH BOTTXE
fÂ°-iiuel Kelso Wanted on a Charge of
Assault With a Deadly
"Weapon.
A. H. Freund. a conductor for the Mar
ket-street Railway, living at 1171 Shotwell
street, secured a warrant from Judge
Fritz yesterday afternoon for the arrest
of Samuel Kelso, ! a sign painter, on the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Frcund's right eye was badly swollen and
discolored and the right side of his head
was bandaged.
Freund said lie and Kelso and two oth
ers were playing a game of euchre Satur
day night in a saloon at Twenty-ninth and
Mission streets, and he had some words
with Kelso about a misplay. About an
hour later Freund was standing at the
bar having" a drink with a friend when
Kelso approached them. The friend spoke
to Kelso and suggested he should shake
hands with Freund, but Kelso suddenly
pulled a heavy bottle from under his coat,
and threw it at Freund, who dropped to
the floor unconscious from the blow.
Freund was taken to St. Luke's Hos
pital, where an ugly wound on his right
temple was stitched and dressed. He was
not able until vesterday to be out, and he
went at once to the Hall of Justice Â¦ to
secure the warrant.
BEES held a baggage car against
all comers yesterday on the nar
row gauge road to San Rafael.
Their aggressiveness came near
tying up traffic for the day.
A resident of Corte Madera had two
hives presented to him by a Mr. Noren
son of Baker street, who had no further
use for them. The Corte Maderan hired
an innocent party, who did not know ,
bees, to transport them from the city,
where they had been licking a living off
the syrup barrel at the corner grocery, to .
the country, where the orange and man
zanita bloom.
The two hives arrived at' the ferry in Â¦
good condition but with an ominous hum
ning inside, which showed that the bees
were putting themselves on a war foot-
A freight clerk, who had experience
with live stock, refused to take them unt I
the hives had been surrounded with a
bee-proof net. By the time this was ob
tained and the bees secured within it, the
man had lost his boat and the bees their (
temper.
Arrived at Sausalito, one of the honey
hunters got out and immediately had a
rear-end collision with a trainman, who
thereupon refused to take the . hives on
the cars unless still further safeguards
The part taken by P. H. McCarthy of
the Building Trades Council in the boy
cott of the California Baseball League
was denounced at the â¢ v eRUlar meeting of
the Journeymen Barbers' Union Monday
night by W. B. Currier, secretary of the
union.
Currier asserted thai, the boycott was
not aimed at Harris, but at Theodore F.
Bonnet,' against whom McCarthy, so It 13
said, cherishes malice on account of politi
cal differences. Currier objected strenu
ously to the use of organized labor to
serve personal ends.
In an interview yestciday Currier said
that Harris' cigar store and not the base
ball league should have been the object cf
the boycott. He pointed out that Harr'.s
has stock in the Market-street Railway
and the Spring Valley Water Works and
that it would be just as logical to boycott
those corporations as the baseball league.
The members of the Barbers' Union are
in sympathy with Currier, and may not
respect the boycott ordered by the Build
ing Trades Council.
Council on the Boycott.
The Building Trades Council is still dis
cussing the California Baseball League.
At the meeting of the executive commit
tee last night a communication to the
newspapers was approved, of which the
following Is a part:
The Building Trades Council has, after due
and careful deliberation, declared Henry Har
ris unfair in every channel through which he
may conduct any business, and reserves the
right to say which of these interests mar first
l-e taken up. The council controls the build
ing Industry and Is therefore the only central
body that can first decide what shall be done
vlth matters such as Harris' scab store fit
ting.
Up to this time the Building: Trades Council
has not called upon the Labor Council, and
anything that Mr. IlarKs has or his ' agents
or his scab hirelings have said to, the contrary
is false, and they said it because they knew
it was false and for the sole purpose of show
ing the people. If possible, that labor was di
vided.
This is not true, and Mr. Harris knows it.
When the Building Trades Council passes up.
If. it does, to the Labor Council this unfair
notice or boycott there will be Just as many
Rood union men found In that council as in
eny other central body in existence.
The Building Trades Council has expended in
the mlllmen's strike many thousands of dol
lars and it new remains to be seen whether or
not the 12,000 men engaged In the building in
dustry are to be ruled by the thirty-five or
forty scabs employed by E. and 1*. Emanuel,
Incorporated. This is what Harris and his
scab agents and hirelings would like to have,
but the union men of San Francisco, the
fi,0C0 or 24,000 of them in the Building Trades
Council and Labor Council will teach Harris
and his scab agents and hirelings a lesson they
will never forget. And again the council,
through its executive committee, desires to
say that Harris can only become fair by cut
ting himself loose from Emanuel. If he pre
fers to hold with Emanuel then he must not,
by reason of patriotism, friendship or other
wise, look to the laboring men of California
to patronize his baseball games or anything
else in which he is interested or anybody who
nay patronize him, because the worklngmen
have for some time past ceased giving up their
money to those who are at the same time en
g&ged in cutting the ground from under them.
This is the position occupied by Harris until
he changes it.

Cheap Labor Bugaboo.
The following communication relative to
the metal-workers' strike has been re
ceived:
Editor of San Francisco Call: Labor or
ganizations, when they ask for a shorter work
day or a general increase of wages, seem to
arouse the employers to the fact that they
can secure their work cheaper from the East
than they can make it here.
Just see the large amount of money the
firms that have been in our line of business
have lost in the last fifteen years by not se
curing their work from the East, and It seems
rather strange to me that they have only real
ized the fact when the polishers, buffers and
platers ask for a shorter work day.
We held a meeting on Monday evening, and
the spirit that prevailed . was the . spirit of
men *-ho understand . the conditions they have
to work under. Let the public visit any of
the shops when they are running and' see If
they can blame us for asking for a shorter
work day. The only capital that a working
man has is his health, and he must use means
whereby he can preserve It, as the firms and
trusts preserve their capital, so we have asked
for eight hours' work. The condition of the
flfcht at the present time Is favorable to us, as
all of the shops are without men. Let me cor
rect a mistake made by one of the papers.
We are not asking for a 20 per cent Increase
Ir. our wages besides our demand for eight
hours. All we ask is eight hours' work and
no reduction in wages, and let me correct the
name of one of the firms. It 6hould be Schaez
leln & Burridgrft in place of L. Burge.
Hoping you will insert this in your valuable
paper I remain, yours respectfully, .Â¦Â¦ i. .

CRITICISM FOR
LEAGUE BOYCOTT
OAKLAND, April 2.â Clad in the quaint
costumes of their ancestors, two-score
flaxen haired, blue eyed boys and girls
tripped the dances of Denmark. The
scene was at the crowded opera-house In
Haywards, where were assembled this
evening the citizens of the thrifty su
burban town to give welcome to the dele
gates and friends of the Society Danla
at its twenty-first annual convention, the
sessions of which began to-day.
There was a hearty greeting for tlie
visitors, who had come there from all sec
tion:; of the State. The order is strong
with the Danes in California, who orga
nized it to perpetuate loyalty to their
adopted country and to keep green the
memories of the Fatherland.
When the large audience had been
called to order by N. P. Nielsen, the
president of the evening, the programme
was opened with a song of welcome, in
Danish, rendered by Mrs. H. P. Nielsen.
Mayor Charles Heyer presented a mas
sive golden key to Grand President J. J.
fciandholdt in token of the citizens' offer
of the freedom of Haywards to the visit
ors, at the same time reading a proclama
tion which encouraged every one to seek
enjoyment. -\
A response in behalf of the Grand Lodge
was made by H. V. Jacobsen.
Then trooped upon the etage. the bon
neted and quaintly garbed youngsters,
who delighted the spectators with their
clever and dainty dancing. The costumes
v.-ere perfect and not a few had been
taker, from some oiu chest filled with
keepsakes from across the sea. It was
ell pretty and unique, to the native-born
and those from the old country enjoyed
the memories the dance revived. The
children who took part were: Laura Niel
f-en. Mina Sorensen. Helga Nielsen, Al
bert^ne Nielsen, Laura Christensen, Gene
vteve Nielsen, Anna Christensen, Andrew

of Watching. .'/ â¢â¢- Â¦
' A clever capture was effected last night
in Chinatown by Lieutenant â¢Â¦' Price and

the hands of dfflcer Connors from the
roof of the buildingr- "When opposite the
window of the room in which the g-amb

of several minutes watched the Chinese
at play. He then sigmaled to the rest of
the posse, which was â¢- stationed near by,
and they broke in the doors and arrested

companies of this regiment were at Model

WEEPS WHEN
HE LOSES STAR
Policeman John Colen Cries
Like a Child v on Being
Â¦â¢;Â¦ Dismissed.
Police Commissioners Decide That
the Patrolman Is Guilty of Com
plicity With Bunko
Men.
The case of Police Officer John H. Colen,
who was charged with neglect of duty in
not reporting a bunko-steering case In
which J. A. Robertson, a recent arrival in
the city, lost $100, came up before the Po
lice Commission last night, and after
hearing all testimony the board found the
defendant guilty and dismissed him from
the e force.
Robertson said the officer refused to ar
rest the man vho robbed him, but went
out to find his pals. Colen then, accord
ing to his statement, told him he would
get back half the money he lost if he
would return within an hour. He re
turned as directed, and the policeman was
present when the money was paid.
Captain "Wlttman produced the bunko
steerers' outfit, gave the officer on trial
an excellent previous reputation and said
he was surprised to hear of the present
affair.
Colen denied that he had anything to do
with any money transaction, and said
that he failed to make any arrests because
Robertson told him the difficulty had been
settled and he destred that no one should
be locked up. The officer explained his
failure to make a report by saying that
he forgot.
Harry Walters was the next witness,
and he was followed by Attorney Mack.
The testimony of both was in the officer's
favor.
When the verdict of dismissal was ren
dered Colen wept like a child and had to
be led from the room.
The case against Officer F. Callahan for
shooting a dog that attacked him was
dismissed. . .
The, resignation of John Marshall was
accepted. Police Officer Barry was fined
$10 for reporting late for duty, and the
charges against Police Officer Aiken were
withdrawn. Officer James Kelly, who was
disrated from p. sergeantship on Septem
ber 3, 1890, applied to be reinstated, and
the matter was laid over for* one week.

afternoon on' Mason street by Policeman

Traffic on the Narrow-Gauge Road to San Rafael Tempo
rarily Deranged by the Aggressive Insects Until a Smoke
Brigade Made Up of Crew and Passengers Routs Them
were put about them. The result was
the loss of another train "by the man and
the remainder of their temper by the beea
When . the train arrived at the station
and the door of- the car was opened the
bystanders felt like ' robbers when the
trusty shotgun messenger gets to work.
The bees had the car and no one couM
get near it. They swarmed and buzzed
and stung everything in sight.
The dispatcher finally ordered the train
ahead and- the bees rolled out in their
private car. It was useless for train pur
poses and the conductor wanted to leave
it at San Rafael, but again ths dispatcher,
who' had a .ten-mile. Teach of telegraph
wire between him and the bee stings, or
" dered the car ahead with the train.
Conductor Brown la fertile in expedients
Â¦ and advice was . plenty. He organized a
band of smokers ; Â¦ borrowed gloves and
handkerchiefs with which to equip them
as defensive armor, and then every man
with pipe or cigar alight, hands inglove3
and face â¢ masked with handkerchief,
' went gayly to the. fray..
The smoke of battle and the roar of the
angry bees were terrific Conductor
Brown, backed up by the smoke-blowing
brigade, won the day and the bees were
put to rout and their hives bundled-ouc
after them.
The consignee is now laying low to
avoid the wrath to come, the trainmen get
mad . when anybody imitates a man
swatting bees and the railroad has a new
rule: "Bees will not be accepted for
. transportation." .

ANSWERS A QUESTION.
Urs. Rorer's Reply in Ladies' Home
Journal.
"I .consider coffee as It Is usually made
In the American family â strong and from
the. pure beanâ an injurious drink, espe-
cially for nervous people.
No doubt the student to whom you re-
fer can study better after taking- a cup
of coffee, but the new energy Is caused
by a stimulant, the effects of which will
foon v rar off, leaving him lower in nerv-
ous force.
That Is the reason he has headache
and/ feels so miserable when he is with-
out coffee. If it Is only the hot drink he
requires why not- take a cup of dear hot
water or a cup of Cereal Coffee."
Mrs. Rorer is one of the most eminent
authorities on food In America. She
knows that Americans go on day by day
using food and drink that Bap their vital-
ity instead of building It up, and it re-
quires argument oft repeated to wake
them up. Broken wrecks of humanity
stumbling: along, unable to carry out their
cherished plans, are all about us and their
physical weakness is nearly always due to
improper food and drink. Coffee Is a
skilled destroyer of nervous strength.
Postum Food Coffee is a delicious food
drink made from selected parts of cereals
that yield the elements Nature demands
for rebuilding the nerve tit sue all over'
the human body.
It Jt has ever been served to you In a
weak, unpalatable drink, have It made
over again and use two spoons to" each
cup -and know that the actual boiling
continues full 13 minutes. Our word for
it, the PoÂ«um Coffee is delicious when
properly made.

_â¢ tlnaj, eight of the latter oceur-
Y lne. in one day. Â¦ Dc. Won*

sician, was called, and with one dose of h!Â«
tea stopped the flow of blood, thereby savin*
my life, as I had been given up by my whit*
physician, as well as by all my friends. Wu
unconscious four weeks, but by Dr. Won? "Woo'a
wonderful skill he saved my life from this moat
fatal of all fevers. Although I was confined to
my bed three months, was able to resume ray
vocation In six months from the time I went to
bed. and now I wslgh 202 pounds, more than I

â¢ The ; City iBoard :Â¦ of - Education; com
posed ' of Superintendent " f'ot * Schools
Webster and his four "deputies, Messrs.
Jordan, Kingsbury, Sullivan and Howard,
held, an important meeting yesterday, for
the purpose of revising the : rules -relatln?
to .the j issuance, of teachers'^ certificates.
This action was made necessary by recent
legislation affecting the- granting of cer
tflcates to applicants. \
. The most important amendments to the
,rules as 'decided upon by the; board pre
iscribe, that no -more High School certifi
cates shall be granted upon examinations,
ibut. they., may be procured only on cre
jdentials. There, credentials comprise
I diplomas" of graauatidn from j the Dniver
â¢sity of. California or from such- institu
; tlons jas the State Board Â¦ of Â¦ Education
deem, to -be of equal rank, with fhe- State
University. Such diplomas must be ac
companied by '.the recommendation of the
faculty and the department of "pedagogics.
This rule will compel all holders of certifi
cates who did not take the course of peda
gogy to return to the, university and take ;
'such course. --'-'; - v . .. ' Â¦ . i
\- > Another rule provides that ho certificate '
of the primary grade v/ill be granted in :
the'future. Â¦ No special certificate of the \
: High -School ,'srade' shall be ..issued en
i titling parties toteachany language oth
er than English/- Again,- county'Boards of
JEducatiori'shaU" issue - to j holders of cer
tificates who have had five years' success- :
;ful experience in teaching permanent "cer
tificates ' of the grade corresponding to the'
grade of the Â¦ certificate' possessed .by the
applicant. This will obviate the necessity
of applications for renewals and the pay
ment of > fees therefor, and will eliminate
much of the work of local Boards of Ex
amination. - : "-â¢: -Â» ..'.,. . s .. .
; The board further decided' that when an
applicant' shall Â¦. have been â¢ under pay in
the San Francisco School Department for
sixty months he . shall be considered as
having had .the five years', experience for.
a permanent certificate. : No examination

Assessor ; Dodge Is of : the; opinion that
the total assessment roll of this. city and
cc imtÂ£ will hot reach thesum "of $400,000, -
OOC. He so informed "Auditor Wells - yes
terday and ' advised that 1 official to base
his estimates | for the Requirements'- of ; the
various. branches": of the city government
forUhe next ; fiscal year, on' a much lower
valuation. Dodge t would not state ! defi
nitely Â§ how .'. much 5 the) assessment - roll
would be," but Â¦' he intimates" that it : will
fall below, $390,000,000. . : A ; '. : v
: Notwithstanding"' Dodge's contention,
; Auditor|Wells has fully made up his mind
to figure the tax budget on a basis of $400,
000,000,;,'unless,'. subsequent developments
justify the other course. ,â¢ Wells draws his
conclusion from the fact that the roll' last
year -'.amounted'-, to Â¦ --J $410,000,000,7 - though
Dodge . then ;' contended â¢"; that . it ? would
amount to = only ; $375,000,000,' and on. this
basis the last tax levy was figured, which
resulted: in an . increased - revenue Â¦ of . some â¢
$260,000, -which the Supervisors now desire
to expend in several different ways. - .
1 Dodge bases ) his estimate for a reduced
valuation on; the- fact ..that : 5 per. cent- is
usually Â¦ allowed! for .taxes delinquent and
uncollected. r.'Thls would ; amount toi$20,
000,000, thus. reducing the roll, as compared
with last year, 1 to $390,000,000. Again Dodge
notified > the that - a < considerable
reduction -would be effected by lower val
uations â¢ on i old ; dwellings, â¢ upon 1 which no
reduction has been made in twenty/years.
Dodge figures that these .improvements
have deteriorated; and, she'^has - already
done much work in 'lowering Uhe:assess
ments '.thereon. , :% Last Â¦< year Dodge . asked
the Supervisors to allow. him ten- clerks to
revise^ the- figures, -buti without â¢ success."
He\wentahead with the force at. his com
mand and' he ) figures ; that , the reductions
on that ? class of < property will amount to
between- $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. i >lyy^- -
â¢' Again,: the sum of $1,500,000 will be miss
ing.'this year; owing to the; exemption' of

the ! assessment of $5,000, 000,- which I is now
In litigation and the validity of which will
not Â¦> be 'Â¦ decided Â¦ for * at ' least Â¦: two : r years,"
Dodge feels justified in predicting that the
total assessed valuation:, of Â¦ this ; city Â¦ and
county should .not be estimated at -a
greater figure than $390,000,000 and he fears
that it may drop to $380,000,000. r '

Some Chinese Bail ' Money.
Experts, both amateur and professional,
have been going over the books : in '.the
Police Courts and the offices of the War
rant and Bond, Clerk and the City:Treas
urer and have found many; discrepancies.
But Whether further. Investigation will
result in showing criminal intent or cleri
cal carelessness is the question.
One of these, peculiar, propositions "was
found in Judge Conlan's court in the cases
of Ah Fook and Wong Jim. Both were
arrested in the .latter part of January and
charged with visiting a lottery place.- On
the records of Clerk. Rice : appears : the en
try that Bock Guy deposited $40 cash bail
in each case to ; insure/their appearance.
Ah Fook was fined $20 and (Wong Jim $40.
Clerk Rice's record : reads "that ., the fines
were paid in court,' which 'would 'mean
that instead- of the usual procedure, be
ing observed, .these -men - paid the 1 cash
to Rice, which , he claims he turned -over
to the County ' Clerk L and the same was
deposited. Â¦ by the Â¦ latter with the City
Treasurer. On the record - book : and
receipt book is an indorsement in . Sulli
van's handwriting- that 'on February.! he
collected from Quang. Bo and' BOckGuy, 1
whose names he signed, the $80 represent
ed in the. two - orders.'. â¢ After Â¦-, signing
the names of the Chinese, he, initialed 1 the
receipt as follows: ./"D. J. S. for C. S.-P."
The money* represented by. these borders
was drawn out 'of ;the City Treasury' on
warrants signed â¢ by- Sullivan,': who claims
that ' he probably â¢ paid the money . back 1 to
the Chinese, although he had- no definite
recollection of the circumstance. Clerk
Rice was also somewhat, hazy in his ex
planation of - the transaction, but claims
it was "perfectly straight." . .â¢â,..<
A meeting I of - the Â¦ Police Judges was
held yesterday morning, at which District
Attorney Byington ' was present. The
question as to the ' best method : of - pro
cedute to follow . In the ' prosecution
of Sullivan was _â¢ discussed. { : It was
finally determined;; that ; it . would \ be
inconvenient " for ; one J Police ys Judge
to g-o before/ another, ; and swear, â¢ to

gery of. th^ signature of the complaining
Judge. -This would necessitate the calling

Judges Mosan ' arid vFritz also have a
small -matter, 'about which" they I would

Both of them claim that there is no pro

to pay therefrom .moneys -deposited as

hands and of which the District At

titude, if -maintained,' will, only add. to the

"After, deliberating I seven hours the . jury
in the* case of Peter. McGlade 'declared that
it .was. impossible for, them to reach, a ver
dict and Judge.- Melvin - reluctantly, dis
missed the jurors from further service.
: ; After a trial lasting eight days the case
went* to the ~juryr yesterday afternoon. at

the : testimony of ex-Chief, of "Police Lees
and; the defendant, together; with* the ar
guments i of, counsel i and \ the charge of
Judge Melvin' to the jury, r McGlade when
on the ;, witness stand made a general de -
nlal of the ' charges filed against him.
The rumor,, which gained currency last
week that two of the jurors would disa
gree v seemed- to; have' some .foundation
when at 6 p. m. the jury, after being
brought into court, announced* that" it 'was
impossible to reach a verdict. Judge MeÂ»

and- announced that â¢ he .would return at

â¢a-At.9pi' m. Judge Melvin. came. into com t
and'sent for, the jury.-. When the foreman
announced that â¢ no verdict had Â¦ been
reached the court ordered the jury* back
tp-.the jury room until* 11. . â¢'. -.Â«>:; - - â¢
! It - was half | an hour before â¢ midnight
when the jury came again into : the pres
ence of the. court. Once again the jurors
were'- asked -if ".they 'had reached a verdict
and again a negative answer was given.
Then Judge Melvin questioned each juror
and each said a verdict was impossible.
The . court had : no , alternative .but to dis
miss the jury and at the request of the
District Attorney the case aeainst Mc-
Glade was setfor next Saturday.-
After the jury left the Hall of Justice
the members declined to tell how the bal
lots ; stood. -Â¦ Some of : them adjourned to a
saloon; for refreshments, however," an-1
there a heated argument took place. '. Al
though; the jury had agreed to. maintain
silence as $to how the ballots had been
cast some'of the jurors finally talked. .
It was learned that â¢ eleven ballots wee
taken" and" that from the first two of the
jurors had .stood- for a'-verdict of . "not
guilty." "The Jurors who . voted-- for "not
guilty"; were E.: J. Fleiger and George

After the details 'of- the -balloting leaked
out, some of the jurors were -not averse
to talking of the result of the trial and

Why "Peery delegatedthis" responsibility
to a subordinate, whom he admits he
knew to be of unsavory character, he ex
plains in the following statement: .
My . position In this matter is pimply this:
I have received bail money and deposited it In
the treasury. -Mr. Sullivan, as to me. has
been honest as far as I know. I have kept
such watch over him that he could not have
btren otherwise., ;I do not know wh&t he has
done on the outside. People have hinted to
me that he had' a, bad record, buf upon inquiry
I could not get from them any speciflc charge,
and' it was not. ontil â¢ this matter arose that
anybody has purported to state facts. On ac
count of the insinuations ag&lnst him' I have
been more particular than I otherwise would to
Kept Watch Over Him.
"Every order that I presented was 3 a
genuine one, signed by the Jodge him
self," he says. "This ihing has ; been run
on a very- loose system. I do, 'not. deny
that I " received money | for cashing these
orders. I 'do. not care vjhether Kytka de
clares - the i - ignati:res genuine or -not.
When the warrant and bond clerk's office
was flrst opeixd up we did not; have any
blanks. Soraeiimes we would ' take one
at the orders on the treasury, scratch out
the words 'paj' to tho order of and write
in there "recerred of.' This would be the
receipt for the bail (money. In Peery*s
office there is xÂ»ot a. book of records to
show the receipt of money. from any one.
When one of these receipt books is filled
out they chuck the stubs into a closet
and let it go at that."
Clerk Peery. in explaining his apparent
delinquency in not .making daily returns
to the city treasury, claims that his force
is overworked. The routine details iof, his
office. are such that the force of men at
his command, if Â¦ not engaged in outside
avocations, should be sufficient to meet
all requirements in a : clerical way. Â¦ One
clerk is detailed to attend the office at
night, while the remainder ; of the force
is on duty throughout the' day. Peery
himself is seldom about the office, except
ing during the busy hours of the morn
ing. He admits tha.t Sullivan was prac
tically- allowed by him to handle the
moneys entrusted to him as a temporary
custodian prkw to their" transmission to
the city treasury.
Sullivan T:lls of Loose Methods.
The Hall of Justice is all agog over the
exposure of the Dan Sullivan transactions.
Sullivan spent the night in jail and is
apparently, satisfied to remain there, al
though not charged with any offense. He
might invoke the aid of a writ of habeas
corpus, but says he dees not qare to do so.
It begins to look as If District Attorney
Byington- would have .to â¢ appear . on : the
defensive 'beiore the jGrand 'Jury; In "order
to protect his ' subordinates In the war
rant and ibond' clerk's 'office of ;tbe City
Hall.-. Instead of his appearing: as the peo
ple's 'prosecutor,- he will likely have to
act as counsel for the defense of' his own
office, when .the Grand Jury to-nigfct be
gins an lnvtestlgatlon Into the .crooked
transactions of Dan Sullivan, late ,book
keepimr assistant to. Warrant and- Bond
CierkCharles S. Peery. ' â¢ 'â¢ .'
Some tnonths agro A;D. Dardis,' an el
derly horse doctor, was arrested on .a
charge of' grand, larceny arising -out of
a business-difference with a young woman
named CWiVodbrldffe. ; He "was a friend of
William j B. Lutz, | and the bail money for
li!s release was furnished by the last
named. Some slsty days after the case
had gone ' through all the various stages
of 'Police 'Court continuances and was
finally dkenissed, 'LÂ»utz went after his
money.' \
Naturally the first place he sought was
the city treisury. , . ': :
."No; niones* here to your credit," an
swered Deputy Treasurer Reis, who pays
all warrants. \ . . ."â¢
"That's f unaiy," ' said Lutz. He : then
went back to > the warrant and bond
clerk's office arid asked for his coin. Noth
ing was known there about it, so he was
informed, and lie was told to call again.
Lutz.went back four or five times, with
the same result.. Finally, getting Â¦ tired,
he went, to see E^yington about noon or 1
o'clock in the afternoon. He explained
the matter to hir.i, and was requested to
call acrain about 4 or 5.
Says By ing ton Beturned Money.
* "I went back," sa:id Lutz, "and Byington
handed out the. money, $250, . apologizing
for the delay. | I did" not have my receipt,
nor did I sign any \ papers or books. I
was glad enough to ;pet the money."
Lutz a few days ivfter this transaction
was selected as a member of the Grand
Jury, .atod is. therefÂ«Â»re, in a position to
accuraiiely gauge what manner of things
are bei:ig done in thi? warrant and bond
clerk's office, out of ->rhich Dan Sullivan,
Clerk Perry's assistant, with $800 of some
body's bail money, l.etyanted to Colfax
and fi.na.llv landed in jail.
This in.<ormation vras conveyed last
night to Oaptain of Uetectives Seymour
by Police Officer John Fleming, who is
attached to the court of Police Judge Ca
baniss. The inaccessltiflity at that hour
of the recoids prevented further inquiry
into the matter. The line of inquiry
which this iransucticn opens .up will be
followed up lo-day and the evidence will
be presented by Lratz to the Grand Jury
lo-nlght.
