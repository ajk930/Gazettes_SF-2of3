United States to Wait Until Colombia
Asks for Interference.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18,-Captain Perry
of the battleship Iowa, now at San Fran
cisco, has telegraphed to the Navy De
partment an acknowledgment of his In
structions to proceed to the west coast of
Panama in connection with the revolu
tionary troubles, but reports that the boil
ers a'nd some other parts of the vessel
need Immediate attention. It is hoped by
the department, however, that she. will be
able to sail some time to-morrow.
Scnor Bllva, Colombian Minister .to the
United States, is satisfied that the reports
that have been received indicating that
Dr. Sanclemente. former President of Co
lombia, is supporting the insurrection are
not correct. While he does" not under-
Etand that Dr. Sanclemente is in entire
accord with the administration of Presi
dent Marroquin, he does not believe that
he has gone over to^the insurgents.
Minister Silva's dispatches mention
nothing of the kind. He does not believe
the reports that Venezuela has been in
vaded from Colombia in the sense ' that
any Colombians participated in the Inva
elon, though he regards it as possible the
Venezuelans who are' participating in the
Insurrection in that country against Presi
dent Castro may have organized on the
natives. Of Aguinaldo personally General
MacArthur has a high opinion, and de
clares him to be very much more of a'
man Â¦Â¦ than Americans who hava, not been
in actual contact with him give him credit
for being.
On the subject of himself and his admin
istration the general is modestly silent.
He speaks In glowing, terms, however,- of â¢
the work of the medical department both
in 'improving the hygienic conditions in
Colombian side of the frontier. In. the
same way he discredits the reports ' that
guerrilla bands which have been operating
on the Isthmus of Panama are . composed
of Nicaraguans. He regards it as possible
that some disaffected. Colombian refugees
In Nicaragua may have led a few Indi
vidual Nicaraguans to Join them in an at
tempt to make trouble on the isthmus,
but he does not believe that the Nicara
guan Government has connived at their
action. I '.
Minister Silva believes It will not '.be
necessary for the United States to land
men on the isthmus to maintain, freedom
of communication. There is :no ! intention
on the part of the United States- to -land
Â» General MacArthur was one of the 'last
of the general . of the arrays or

to the islands in June, 1S98,- and was here
but a few weeks when he took his de

since entering. the army service at the
commencement of the Civil, War is* one
of which to be proud. During the four
years of the war he received a number of

but transferred it to the American side.
Aguinaldo, the general says, has lent the
administration much assistance in
straightening out . affairs and bringing
about a proper understanding with the
Manila, and they look to-day as if they
had been on the training table."
General MacArthur speaks in glowing
terms of Japan. The people, he said,
were healthy, happy and apparently pros
perous. They treated him most hospita
bly, and his visit to the land of the cherry
blossom will Â¦ always remain in his mem
ory, he says,' as one of the most delight
fuJ experiences in his life.

"By this time the ship's boats were
loaded and had got away, and while tha
officers were getting out the last life raft.
Captain Foote called to all hands to clear
the ship as she was about to go down.

very clearly given. He was awakened by
the shock and could not get out of his

"The description of the disaster by tha
survivors Is heartrending, and those who
live to tell the story are each and every
one heroes and worthy of being called
men and women. The Islander struck an
Iceberg, and so severe was the shock that

TACOMA. Wash., Aug. 18.â To-day's
Oriental advices give further details of
terrible floods in the I'angtse Kiang Val
ley during July. It is estimated that not
less than 20,000 people were drowned In
the provinces of Kiangsi, Hupeh, Hunan
and Anhui, while tens cf thousands have
been rendered homeless. The provinces of
Kiangsi and Hunan have suffered most
severely and boatmen estimate that not
less than 15.000 people lost their lives in
Kiangsi alone.
During June and July rain, fell inces
santly forty days through the Yangtse
Valley, causing the heaviest precipitation
known in centuries according to Chinese
records. Suddenly in July the Yangtse
River broke through its banks in numer
ous places and great floods began sweep
ing down the valley, carrying with them
numerous corpses of men and animals.
At Kiuklng the river attained a height of
forty-five feet above low water and at
Hankow of forty-eight feet.
The greater part of Hankow was inun
dated and all Its environments. Kiuking
Is flooded completely, there being two feet
of water in" the streets of the foreign set
tlement, which is built on the highest
ground. At Anking and as. far down the
river as Wuhusame a terrible state of
affairs prevails. The Viceroys of four
provinces named are powerless to deal
with the catastrophe which has befallen
their subjects. Funds are being slowly
raised and some effort will be made to
provide food and shelter as, soon as the
waters subside. . .
Dispatches received at Yokohama and
Toklo from places throughout Japan say
that not since the imperial meteorological
bureau was established thirty years ago
has there been such a. heavy rainfall as
during July. In the province of Kinshiu
rain fell unceasingly July 13, 14 and 15.
The resulting floods caused considerable
loss of life In > Japan. The- greatest
casualty was at the Iwasaki coal mines in
Fukuoka, where sixty-five men were
drowned, water having invaded the mine
in the middle of the night and cutting off
all. chance of escape.
Dispatches received at Hongkong from
Canton state that north. and west rivers
in Southern China are overflowing. Rice
fields "and mulberry plantations are an
destroyed. The property loss here will
amount to several mlllon dollars. -

Whitehead brought into play a principle

birds. He shifted his weight to one side:
the ship careened and sailed . safely
around the trees. He had now soared
through the air for fully a half-mile, and
as the field ended a. short distance ahead
the aeronaut stopped the power and pre
pared to alight. The ship settled from a
height of about fifty feet in two minutes
and alighted on the ground on her four
wooden wheels so lightly that Whitehead
was not Jarred in the least.
They did so and the machine darted up
through the air like a bird.
"I'm going: to start the wings I" he
yelled. "Hold her now!" The two assist
ants held on the' best they could, but tht*
ship shot up into the air.
"We can't hold her!" shouted one of tha

"Let go, then!" shouted Whitehead.
NEW YORK. Aug. 18.â A machine that

The* experimental trip was made "at mid
night. The machine rolls along the ground
on wooden wheels, and on a clear stretch
of good macadam road the flying automo
bile was sent . spinning along at twenty
miles an hour. For short distances tho
speed was close to thirty miles.
Whitehead started the engine that pro
pels the machine along the ground, whila
his two assistants clung to the safety
ropes. The machine started slowly at
first to run over the ground, but within
100 varda the men who had hold of the
ropes and Inventor Whitehead were run
ning as fast as they could.
Then Whitehead pulled open the throt
tle that starts the air propellers, or wings,
and shut off the ground propelling en
gine. Almost 'instantly the bow of tho
machine lifted and it rose at an angle oi
about 6 degrees from the ground. The
machine looked like a great white goose.

It was decided to circulate a petition
signed by the retail merchants requesting
the co-operation of the wholesalers in the
work of settling the strike.
An address was made by ex-Senator. H.
V. Morehouse, In which he said it
high time to .bring the Employers' Asso
ciation to a full realization of their duties
in the premises. "When he closed, a unan

Nathan Blbo, the grocer, said the tlmo
had arrived for a third party to atcp
between the two contending factions, and
who were better qualified to serve in th<U
capacity than the retail merchants of
San Francisco. Mr. Bibo counseled wise
and concerted action in order to secure
best results. - . â¢
"If this strike is not settled by "Wed
nesday," said Mr. Bairy, "-we" will take
such action as will raise the hair of the
hea'ds of the members of the # Employers'

The question of a mass meeting waa
then discussed.. Mr. Barry suggested that
it be held next Wednesday evening, and
this was ultimately agreed to.
John F. Sullivan moved that a committee
be appointed by the chair, composed of
three representatives from each retail
trade, whose duty it should be to intÂ«Â»r-.
view wholesalers in their respective lines,
and secure from them a promise to do all
In their power to put an end to the strike.
After some discussion the motion pre
vailed, with an amendment making the
number five instead of three.
J. A. Jones, a real estate dealer, held
that there was a combined effort of
banded capital to â¢ crush unionism, and
that the next conflict would be between
republicanism and socialism. In closing
he said the eyes of the capitalists of the
world were upon San Francisco as the
chief battleground upon which the war

waged. .

Mr. Barrington later took the floor
again with the statement that the Em

man, Attorney Michael, absolutely re
fused to consider mediation of any sort.

opinion, he offered the following resolu
tion, which was adopted amid loud'ap
plause:
Employers Must Agree to Confer.
John F. Sullivan, secretary of the Re
tail Grocers' Association, when called
upon for remarks said his association was
in consultation with the wholesale gro
cers, and that at their next meeting de
cisive action would be taken. Pending
such action, he had nothing to say, except
that there was hope of settling the-trou
ble very soon.
C. L. Barrington. a druggist, stated
that the strike was doing Incalculable
damage to the local drug trade. He spoke
of drug associations in Eastern cities,
and of the successful work accomplished
by them. He believed that the organiza
tion of business people was necessary in
order to insure the success of individual
members. In this way their Influence must
be felt in the settlement of strikes.
J. S. Barry of the Cigar' Dealers' Asso
ciation precipitated a warm debate by de
manding the exclusion of all persons not
identified with the retail business in this
city. â¢ Several speakers were opposed to
this course as being against sound policy;
and an amendment that all persons be
allowed to remain but none save retail
ers be granted the privilege of the lloor
was carried.
Chairman W. J. Kenney in calling the
assemblage to order explained the purpose
of the meeting. He said business talks
by business men were wanted. It was
the hope of all retail merchants that the
strike would be ended soon.
yesterday afternoon to discuss
ways and means for bringing the strike
to a speedy settlement. The interest man

meeting.

" TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 18.â A peculiar
'accident happened t yesterday at Prosser
and one that almost seems unreal: James
Ross was at the bottom of a well, focty
five feet below the surface of the ground.
He was engaged In making some repairs.
He was assisted by a man Â¦who stood u.t
the top of the weir and who worked a
windlass, used for hauling up dirt.
Suddenly and without warning the earth
above Ross began to Rive way, and before
his helper could grasp the situation the
unfortunate man waa buried from sight.
Eleven hours elapsed from the time of the
accident until Ross was liberated, which
occurred at 5 o'clock this morning. All
hopes for the man had been given up snC
therefore every one was startled upon
reaching the entombed man to find him
alive, and aside from a few bruises, aj
well physically as he had been prior to
the accident. Â¦ ...
It seems that in falling the earth had
carried a piece of board with.it, and this
board had in some manner lodged above
Ross, thus giving him space to breathe
and saving his life. He was not in his

sessed an idea that . he .. had been im

The boy tells a story of extreme cruelty.
He has a scar on his nose which he
claims is the result of a blow given him
by Angel with a wine bottle several years
ago and says Angel has whipped him on
sundry occasions. He also says -that An
gel threatened to take him off his horse
and thrash him. The dead man bore a
good reputation.
Immediately after the shooting the boy
tried to escape and ran for the brush,
but had only gone about fifty feet when
he was caught by one of the bystanders.
His hands were tied behind his back and
his feet tied together. His wrists were
tied so tight that his hands were swollen
v to nearly twice their natural thickness
when he was released by Constable Ben
Cummings.
Angel was sitting in a chair with his
arms folded, when the boy. without warn
ing, pulled out a revolver and shot him.'
The bullet entered his upper lip to the
left of the nose and ranged upward," but
did not pass through his head. The boy
had been drinking, but those present
claim that the victim had not.

California not only has the products
to make an interesting show, but it
seems to have artists or men who
have the art of showing their goods
to the best advantage. And yet,
as though an artistic show of their su
perior products were not attractive
enough, the Californians give away from
one to two thousand pounds of delicious
seeded raisins in quarter pound sample
packages each day to the passing multi
tude, and they maintain a booth pre
sided over by handsome young ladies in
uniform in which they prepare California
prunes in all the hundred and one
edible ways and give them, along with a
neat and costly receipt book telling how
they are prepared, to all the visiting
dames who care to partake. I have been
deeply impressed with the skill and en
ergy put into this work by the Cali
fornians in the effort to emphasize the
the appetite of the visitor. The Installa
tion of California's exhibit is strikingly
beautiful and the great variety of prod
ucts displayed, as well as their size and
quality, combine to make the show of this
State very popular.
â¢ Flowers and flowering plants are a very
attractive feature of the Horticultural
building. Early in the season the ro
tunda-was made radiant with a beautiful
display of carnations. These in turn were
supplanted by tender roses, these by pan
sies, these by hardy roses, these by sweet
peas, and these just now by ' gladioli.
The Horticultural building at the Pan-
American is, in short, all that it ought to
be. It is radiant with fruits and flowers,
rich in color and aroma, and to the lover
of these elevating products It is interest
ing and highly instructive.
OBSERVER.
Mexico has an attractive display oi
wines and waxed fruits, the latter includ
ing the tropic and semi-tropic varieties
peculiar to that republic. Florida has a
characteristic display, showing everything
from a pomelo to an alligator skin. It is
interesting from its uniqueness and in
structive as showing the varied products
of th peninsular State. Idaho, in a small
space, shows some fine fruits, and Ne
braska and Wisconsin have come in lately
with a very creditable showing of now
apples, new plums and other fresh fruits.
Colorado, Delaware, Connecticut, Michi
gan, Minnesota. Arizona, Virginia, Wash
ington and Maine are each represented
in a modest way by samples of their hor
ticulture, while Oregon has a display
which for variety and quality shows
plainly the wide range of horticultural
possibilities in that far away State.
The Chautauqua grape section of the
State makes an attractive displav in the
New York space, with fruits and grape
juice and other vineyard products. Illin
ois has a space almost equal to New York
and has surprised the Easterners by her
splendid showing of apples and other
fruits. Over the exhibit of this State
hangs a sign which reads, "500,000 acres in
Illinois devoted to apple orchards." In
the neatness of its installation and the
variety as well as the excellence of its
products, the Province of Ontario, in
Canada, has an exhibit in this building
that is as attractive as it is surprising.
Missouri shows apples that in size and
quality are hard to excel. This StatÂ«
also makes a strong exhibit of wine, and
has lately been replenishing by a full va
riety of other seasonable fruits. The Mis
souri exhibit is easily the second best in
the building.
largest space in the Horticultural build
ing, and has a fine display of more than
100 varieties of apples, supplemented by
a liberal and attractive showing of fresh
fruits as they mature.
UFFALO. Aug. 13.â The horticul
tural feature of the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition has been made
quite strong; also the building in
which this department is in
stalled seems to attract more than
its proportion of Pan-American vis
itors. Horticulture is a rapidly growing
industry in America and the interest in
it evidently increases with its expansion.
The horticultural feature even at Paris?
last year was not so strong' an attraction
as itis at this fair, and at no time in the
history of America, not excepting at the
Chicago Exposition in 1893. has there been
a better or more interesting display of
tliit Industry than is now aggregated at
Buffalo.
The apple feature is particularly strong
and very interesting:, as showing the pos
sibilities of this fruit by means of re
fr'geration in a perfectly fresh and sound
condition during practically the entire
year. On the opening of the exposition
in May apples were about the only variety
of fruit displayed by a number of the
Eastern and Middle West States, and
even now in the exhibits of most of these
States apples are a dominating feature,
and large round and perfect fruit of the
crop of last year lie on plates side by side
â¢with attractive specimens of the earlier
varieites of this year's crop. As the sea
pon advances, however, the apples of the
crop of 1900 gradually give way in their
turn to the strawberries, gooseberries,
cherries, currants and now the earlier
plums and peaches of 190L By this pro
cess all the fruits will be shown in their
season until the close of the fair, when
apples again, it is expected, will be the
dominant feature.
As usual in the department of horticul
ture California takes the. lead. The ex
hibits from the Golden State occupy about
one-third of the floor space of the entire
building and in size, quality and variety
the fruits are simply indescribable- They
have pears that weigh four pounds,
dusters of grapes that weigh seven
pounds, oranges and peaches that weigh
a. pound each and other things in pro
portion. They have a most beautiful and
elaborate display of dried fruit and an ex
hibit of canned fruit, erected in the form
of a building and called the canned fruit
palace, which contains 9000 cans of
peaches, pears, apricots and plums. In
the California exhibit wine, raisins,
pickled olives and olive oil form promi
nent features, and nuts in variety as well
as .marmalades and fruit preserves tempt

The strike among the steel workers in
Wellsville took on a new life to-day, and
to-night excitement among the men was
up to fever heat. A tight between union
and non-union men on the streets last
night, coupled with the action of the steel
company in obtaining lodgings for the
new men throughout the town, has great
ly incensed the strikers. Sheriff Noragen
and Deputy Chris Breck arrived from
Lisbon at 7 o'clock to assist the local po
lice in maintaining order throughout the
night.
"The idea that because we are not strik
ing for more wages, but for the sympathy
of the people, is a mistaken one. The
workingmen of America realize the full
meaning of our struggle for a principle
for which the forefathers of this country
fought. It is the right guaranteed by the
constitution of the country. It is equal
rights with the trust to organize and
maintain prices. They say they do not
object to our organization, but in the
same breath tell men in non-union mills
that if they belong to our organization
they will lose their places. It is this
fundamental principle that has brought
out the thousands of workingmen in Mc-
Keesport. It is this principle that is
bringing to our support every true Amer
ican workingman in the country. It Is
one of the greatest battles for organiza
tion that has ever been fought. There is
but one end to such a battle with the men
so determined as our men are."
Ben I. Davis, member of the advisory
board of the Amalgamated Association,
discussed the situation freely to-day. He
said:
j . . ... Other Trades jMay. Join.' ;
'There was talk to-night"of .thepossibil
ity of the extension of the strike to other
trades. The structural ironworkers and
bricklayers are becoming directly inter
ested through the question of handling
material made by the United States Steel
Corporation. The strike leaders say that
they have the absolute promise of support
from those two trades, and that they will
refuse to handle non-union made mate
rial. They cite a number of instances
where the structural men and brickma
sons have shown their sympathy and
spirit.
He is a man of large physique and or
dinarily very strong, but has lost In
wfight and color during the last two
months. : - :
The strain of the strike is telling upon'
the physical strength of President Shaffer.
He was ill to-day and kept to his bed
most of the time. He declined to sÂ«e any
of the many callers who sought him, and
his wife, who met them in his stead, ex
plained that he was worn out and sick
and must have rest in order to carry on
bis work. It is expected that he will be
at the strike headciuarters as usual to
morrow, but his friends are afraid that if
the strike should be prolonged he will
break down. Ever since the strike began
he has given his personal attention to
every detail of it and although he has had
assistance and the counsel of his assist
ants, the real responsibility has rested
upon him. He was not well on Saturday
an>! in discussing his health said:
"I simply must not get sick. I, have
not time to spare at this stage."
The steel managers may succeed in get
ting another mill on to-morrow at the
Painter plants. Two mills were operated
there last week with non-union men and
part of another crew was got together.
Jusc as soon as enough men are available
the third mill will be started.
. The mills are guarded and the men will
be kept upon the premises until all danger
of trouble ceases. Bunks for about fifty
have been erected and large quantities of
feed have been purchased. A fence has
been built around the property and guards
posted .to keep out all intruders. The
strikers will undoubtedly make an effort
to induce the strike breakers to quit work
and the fear, is expressed that if any
demonstration be made against the men
or property i there will be trouble. The
situation there is regarded as very deli
celo.
Situation Is Critical.
It was expected there would be trouble
when the non-union men reached Mones
sen, for the strikers ; were watching the
ra.'lroads and river arid had expressed a
determination to prevent the entrance of
strike breakers. The men who were
handling the movement for the steel cor
poration successfully veiled their actions,
however, and had their charges safely
within the plants hours before It was
known definitely by any one on the out
side that the men had arrived. They
were brought to Monessen by* 1 special
train and were landed at 4 o'clock in the
morning. 4 It is not known how many men
were in the party or where they were ob
tained.

In the steel mill at 'Monessen early this
morning and the United States Steel Cor
poration expects to add that plant to the
number running . partly or in full with
non-union men within the next twenty
four hours. The Carnegie properties also
resumed to-night. without a break in the
forces operating them, and that fact,
joined with a promise of an early start
at Monessen, leads the steel officials here
to take a very hopeful view of the situ
ation. The strikers claim that men
enough to start the Monessen mills can
not be obtained and that they have not
yet shown their hand at Duquesne and
other Carnegie plants. They promise that
developments will indicate their . strength
to better advantage. . Â¦â. . â¢
It was here that Seaver ! began to ex
perience that strange phenomenon of the
mind which frequently lays its hold upon
those who stand on dizzy precipices, im
pelling them to fling themselves Into the
depths beneath. Pursued by this terrible
desire, reeling with dizziness at the depths
which opened at his side and trembling
in every limb, Seaver clutched his saddle
bows. With face averted from the chasms
lie clung .with might and main to his
burro and was carried the two remaining
miles into camp by the surefooted beast,
suffering the while all the mental torture
and agonies of which an imaginative
mind is capable.
Even on the pleasant plateau, with its
white tents and their cheerful occupants,
Seaver's composure failed to return.

On Saturday, August 10, Seaver started
up the trail astride a ourro. For the first
five or six miles gf the ascent Seaver's
love of the picturesque and the scientific
was abundantly requited. Climbing high
er there came upon his senses that pecu
liar giddiness that the ratified air of
greater altitudes produces on some deli
cately organized temperaments. The trail
began to narrow and wind its tortuous
way about the sheer, wall of mountain,
and beneath yawned canyons gaping out
like pits of death.

After a brief talk with Seaver, Dr:
Lockwood administered to him a suffi
cient dose of ether to render him partially
unconscious. He was taken by the arm
and quickly led out of camp. But by the
time he had reached the litter the drug
had taken effect and he collapsed. His
limp form was placed upon the stretcher
and with a strong man holding the han
dles at either end he was carried down
the first two miles of the trail. The way
was steep and the burden heavy, but the
third man alternated with his fellows at
the handles and good speed was made.
It was while confronted with these con

Inevitable sooner or later, that Seaver hit
upon the most novel of recorded plans for
escaping the dreaded' danger while in
transit. Word was sent to the foot of the
trail, and a telephone message forwarded
to Pasadena summoning Dr. Charles Lock
wood to the mountain top and requesting
him to bring the necessary help to carry
a man down to its base. It was late in the
evening when the doctor received the call
and it was impossible to go up the trail
before the following morning. Other men
were - communicated with and requested
to supply, the men and a stretcher.
Early 'Thursday morning Dr. Lock

Wilson trail on burros, packing upon one
beast a litter such as la used by the Red
Cross ambulance corps. At the top of tho
trail, and before entering the camp, the
litter was. left out of sight so as to avoid
causing any sensation among the people.
Every view tended to Intensify the strain
upon his overwrought nerves. By Sun

so serious that he knew that it would be
physically impossible for him to under

were available at the camp, but he could
not bring himself to endure the mental
torture of looking once more upon the

,. Language of that. kind cannot come without true
feeling. /It is fortunate for. the people of the Â¦Missis
sippi Valley, however, that they' do not have such feel:
It will be admitted that those sentences form a very'
good prelude' to an item announcing "the 'rains, were
general all over the Mississippi Valley yesterday."
However, the writer felt that it was not sufficient for
Hie occasion. He took another drink 1 of rain water
and resumed: "Soon the. driving lines became. taut
like .wires and came on truing to the earth like volleys
of heaven-sent arrows, shooting the air with ringing
fancies and beating. the tender grasses with rebound
ing artillery. The little pools leaped to the union and
met the gray veil that softly brooded upon the moist
face of all. Fiercer and fiercer stormed the pelting,
smashing rain, battering at the portals of earth as if
to penetrate and be .hid therein, dashing violently
and. with furious rage against the barriers, high wall,
on pave and street as though to beat into one monot
onous flat all that opposedâ and ' then it slackened,
hesitated, and With infinite 'tenderness 'bathed .with
slow-falling pathos*, the low-lying earth, all refreshed
and purified now' and upshining through its "radiant
tears like the dark eyes of love up*climbing to an all
adoring'forgiveness." , Â¦Â¦Â¦:'". ,\
One of these writers begins an account of the com
ing of the showersby saying: "And the rain: came
silently in the night to the leafy caves of the tall corn
znl with misty eyes looked from mountain to moun
tain, bc.wing down over the parched ground that with,
eager lips- athirst lay prone and still. Pushing the
leafy bcughs aside with swift dew-gemmed fingers,
the drcps came sparkling and insistent, and soon the
whole yearning bosom of the earth grew dusky .with
the hun id kisses and grew sonorous with the patter
ing feet of the busy shower. Tall trees'stood motion
less in an ecstasy of rain and the joyous flowers tossed
the glinting beads from their bending and bediamond
ed heads, shining up in a tremor of sheer delight like
aspen stars." \ -
. Rarely have we ever had a better. illustration of the
truth that sorrow is silent but joy is jubilant than in
this case. The voices of the East did scant justice to
the vigor with which the "sizzard," as they call it, did
its work, but they pour out a full dithyrambic pean
over the rain. We have already noted the. rejoicing
in some of the towns of Kansas where, at the coming
of the rain, bells were rung, the shops stopped work
and the churches held thanksgiving services, but even
that did not tell, the whole tale. It is not until now
that the full, value and beauty of rain in the East has
been- made known by the facile pens of ready writers
whose task in life it is to . give expression to the
thoughts of the people and make articulate the emo
tions of the multitude. . -
WHEN the sweltering heat of the long
drought had well-nigh blighted in the East
everything from Kansas' corn to New York
politics there came from that section of the country
day after day a tale of woe that was almost as har
rowing as the heat itself. From the very exaggera
tions of those stories we were : able to learn much of
the terrific nature of the hot spell. Still we did not
learn it all. In fact, a truer estimate of the effect
of the heat upon the minds of the people can be
drawn f 10m the outburst of gladness which followed
the coming of the rain than from the lamentations
that arose during its absence.
HOW IT RAINS IN THE EAST.
Conditions in California, barring the disturbance
due to the strike, could hardly be more flattering.
Our crops are- just about large enough to be easily
manageable and profitable without being actually
short, if several kinds of fruit, such as prunes and
pears, which are too short, be excepted. Prices of
grapes for wine are unusually high and the demand
for them is keen. As for potatoes, we cannot get
enough of them to satisfy the demand for Texas and
Missouri points. The cannersreport a firm and active
market for their output and the wool-growers are in
good spirits over a demand which keeps the! market
well cleaned up. Prices for beef, mutton and pork
are still much above the normal and the stockmen
are making money. In fact,. the market reports of
the newspapers bristle : with allusions to firm and
active markets for almost everything, raised in the
State. Under these conditions money is plentiful,
credits arc easy, failures few and small and the tone
of trade sanguine. '
Â¦"-â¢-'. Â¦ .Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢'-/'.
The only two negative elements of the situation, as
reported by the different commercial agencies, are
the strike at San Francisco and the recent heavy
storm along the Gulf of Mexico, which has done
more or less damage to crops and property, though
the loss to the former is not alarming. 1 The steel
strike is not as severe in its effects as anticipated, but
talk of a textile strike has unsettled and weakened
cotton goods, though the raw product is unchanged.
Wool continues in good shape, the raw product being
firm with an upward tendency, while manufactured
goods are in good demand. Boots and shoes are still
in active demand and jobbers are complaining of
slow deliveriesâ a good sign, as showing active opera
tions at the factories. Leather rules firm, but hides
have lately shown some weakness, as the recent hot
and dry weather in the Southwest led cattlemen to
rush large droves of cattle into market, which' gave
a temporarily large increase to stocks of hides. Since
the weather has improved, however, the retail trade
of the West and Southwest has exhibited a corre
sponding improvement, while the distribution ' of
merchandise throughout the East is reported satis
factory. These conditions are affirmed by the coun
try's bank clearings, which showed a gain last week
of 32.3 per cent over 1900, every city of importance
reporting an increase, though the individual gains
v-ivere not as heavy as has been the rule for several
months. The failures for the week were 178, against
168 last year, and were generally small and unim
fortant. % v
IT is seldom, even in the most prosperous times,
that trade reports are so uniformly cheerful and
promising as they were last week. From all
parts of. the country carae flattering advicesTaccom
panied by sanguine expectations for the future. The
damage to the corn crop of the West and Southwest,
which hung like a cloud over the railroad interests
of those section's for six weeks and gave many a
qualm to Wall street, has been definitely ascertained
and arranged for and as the Government report gives
the condition of the crop at 54, or a little over half a
crop, there is a better tone to railroad shares and less
demoralization among business men over the four or
five corn States. While, with the exception of wheat,
the cropsâ cereal and fruitâ of the United States will
be smaller this year, the <3emand for- produce is so
brisk that it is expected that the increased prices will
fully offset the diminished yield. In fact, cereals and
hog products are already higher and all show more
or less firmness, while the demand for fresh and dried
fruits, canned fruits, vegetables, etc., throughout the
East and West is the heaviest ever known. As already
mentioned in this column. California is an immense
gainer by this demand and is receiving more orders
for the above products than she can fill. This is
evidently the California farmers' year.. Â¦ . â¢
The latest development in the Kansas and Ne :
braska region is the holding in the rural districts of
a series of meetings known as "fathers' conferences:"
The object seems to be'. the inculcation of 'a paternal
philosophy relating to the training of children,"- the'
management of wives and other abstruse problems
that perplex the head of the family.
FLATTERING COMMERCIAL CON
DITIONS.
with our debt it is worth noting that
the Treasury Department recently issued an interest
ing statement of the comparative ; revenues of the
country in 1856 and 1901. The expenditures for the
last fiscal year were $505,967,353, while in 1856 they
were but $69,571,025. Thus the per' capita expendi
ture was in the former year only $2 48, while last year
it was $7 97- The wealth of the people, however,
has so increased during the 'interim that we
now carry the larger burden much more easily than
the men of the former generation carried the lighter
one. , Â¦ 'â¢ Â¦ . :Â¦* ' 'Â¦ .Â¦ ' ... ', " , v , . â¢'. r
When the amount of the debt is compared with
population the heaviest burden is found in Aus
tralia' where the per capita debt amounts to $263 00.
It is to be borne, in mind, however, that the Austra
lian people have a" valuable offset to their debts in
the. form of state railroads, for the construction of
which most of the debt was contracted. In the
United Kingdom the per capita debt is about $75,
in Canada it is $50 60, while'in the United States it is
only. $14 50. - Â¦ "
- When all deductions for public improvements have
been made, however, ' there : remains an enormous
sum that has been expended either upon war or upon
the preparation for it. France carries the heaviest
burden, her debt in 1800 being $5,800,691,814. Russia
stands second, her debt being $3,167,320,000, having
grown from $608,312,500 since. 185%. Great Britain .is
third, though her debt shows a decrease from the
figures of 1850, which were $4,082,596,603, while now
they are $3,060,926,304. Italy conies fourth witl} a
debt of $2,583,983,780, a net increase of $2,389,328,780
in forty years. Austria stands fifth with $1,697.255,
140, a net increase for the forty years of $1,093,942,
640. The United States is sixth, the figures for 1890
being $1,107,711,257, a net- gain in forty years â¢ of
$1,044,259,483.
It must not be supposed" that the whole of this
debt represents waste. A considerable' portion of it
among European nations^ has been caused by the 1
construction of canals, railways, and other publje im
provements. Students. Jof the subject have noted
that the increase in the debt has not always been
greatest during years of war. Thus from 1872 to
1882, a period of comparative peace, there was an
increase of national debts amounting to the vast sum
of $4,000,000,000. . -.Â¦;.
According to the latest of these estimates the na
tional debt of the civilized world in 1793 was but
$2,433,250,000. In 1820 it had grown to $7,299,750,006".
Forty-two years later, in 1862, lhe amount was $13,
382.875,000, and twenty years later, .in 1882, it had
practically doubled, amounti|g to $26,249,93 i,of>o.
The estimates for" last "yeai% 'looo/'shdwed'a still fuf*^
ther increase of $5,000,000,000, the figures being $31,
201,759,000.
STATISTICIANS of. late have been engaged in
estimating the extent; to which the debts of the
world were increased during the nineteenth
century, and have found reason to believe that not
withstanding the advantages of improved machinery,
civilization has not increased in wealth more rapidly
than in debt. In other words, the nations 'have ex
pended during the century about as much as their
poeple have earned, and if all the debts could be
called in and a settlement forced they would not be
much, if any, richer now than they were a century
ago.

such a conversion is that the ship lacks accommodations for

which took place July 22, was Interrupted through the alleged
incapacity of the engine-room force. Six of the thirty water
tube boilers were utterly destroyed owing to an insufficiency of
water in the tubes and the vessel waa towed back to port to
receive new boilers. A subsequent attempt to run the ship with
twenty-four boilers demonstrated the fact that In this one case

A wave of reform has struck the. Spanish navy; Beside*
striking off. the list over one-half of the ships as useless for
active service, and selling such as are unfit for anything, it is
contemplated^to farm out the arsenals; that is to say, turn the
latter over to private firms which will undertake to build and
repair ships for the Government.
The alleged success of the submarine boats in France has
led a large number of naval experts to advocate building such
craft as a means of coast and harbor defense in preference to
costly armored ships of doubtful utility. Thus far six sub
marine boats have been tested, two more are nearly ready for
trial, twenty-six are building and not yet launched and there
will be a recommendation that twenty-four more be built. This
will make a fleet of fifty-eight submarine boats within twelva
months, the aggregate cost of which will be about J9.28O.0OO,
equal to the cost of the new armored cruiser Jeanne d'Arc and
the cruiser Chateaurenault, the recent trials of which proved
to be dismal failures.

Loud complaints are made in the British press over the
cheeseparing policy of the Admiralty. The case of the wrecked
cruiser Sybllle Is given as an instance. The ship waa lost: on
the coast of Africa last February and everybody on board lost
all their kits. The officers were told to make out their claims
for losses so far as uniforms were concerned, but no allowance
would be made for plain clothes and other property- The
claims were made out and approved by naval officers at tha
Cape and sent to the Admiralty, where they were cut down 25
per cent and partial payment made in a couple of months.
The four officers court-martialed for the loss of the vessel got
absolutely nothing. The sailors fared but little. better and for
every shilling claimed by the latter the Admiralty allowed only
nine pence. "And yet," says the London Chronicle, "there ara
people who cannot understand how it is that there is a difficulty
in keeping men in the service."
records. The Columbia was built in 1892 and was calculated to
make a speed "of 21 knots with 21,000 horsepower, and to have
a coal capacity of . 2000 . tons, sufficient for 22.000 miles at 10
knots.' At a four-hours* trial she developed a speed of 22.3
knots, but under service conditions she averaged only 13.41
knots during a seven-days' race across the Atlantic in July,
1S97. The coal capacity' Is only 160O tons and the cruising en
durance at 10 knots is only 7200 miles. The two "Pirates'* can
no longer be classed as commerce destroyers, as steamships
have attained a speed of 22 knots and upward, and the enorm
ous coal consumption of the "Pirates" make them too expen
sive to maintain in active sea service for ordinary cruising
work.
THE old ilne-of-battleship Vermont, which has served for
more than thirty-five years as a receiving ship and which
has been, ordered destroyed or sold, owing to its un
sanitary condition, has a rather Inglorious record. She
was begun at the Charlestown navy yard in 1818 and
launched September 11, 1S4S. It was riot until February 24, 1862,
thatthe ship was fitted out and departed for Port Royal, towed
toy two tugs and accompanied by a steamer; Off Cape Cod the
-\ermont fared badly in a gale, losing her sails and rudder and
was in imminent danger for more than a month of being lost.
Â¦ Several ships were sent out to search for the unlucky ship and
she was finally found, by the Sablne and escorted to Port Royal
where, her brief cruising service terminated April 12. She
served for some years as'a hospital and supply ship and was

The recent Investigation â¢ of the vessel by a board of "sur

for a receiving ship, as the old craft is waterBoaked and teem

Germany is building; up its' navy in a consistent ftnd em

for which Congress alone is responsible. In the German navy
the number of officers are increased each year to keep up with
the requirements for the new ships added, while practically no
such provision is made in the United States. During the past
eight years the Secretary of the Navy, the bureau officials and
a !i Jt other naval officers have pointed out the fallacy of
adding ships without providing: for an adequate number of

of the South is felt by the negro to be much farther
beyond his reach than is the white woman of the
North, .which in truth she is."
It is painful to have to quote an utterance" as
sheerly brutal and a libel as cruel. A man must be
as beastly as the guilty negroes themselves to make
such a charge agairut the women of any section of
the country. It is partisanship gone mad to indict
part of the community in which he lives in order to
justify the conditions in the^- South which are the
odium of that section. .'...'.
We only stated our belief that the lasting remedy,
will be found in the moral elevation of the Southern
negro, and his advancement, approximately, to the
position of the Northern negro. This belief in
volves no attack upon tire habit of lynching by fire
in the South or anywhere else, but is the expression
of a hope that such barbarous occurrences may cease
by abolishing their cause. To answer this by such
a charge as the Mail makes against Northern women
is to deserve outlawry and isolation.
It is unfair to the beasts that perish to call the man
who makes it a beast. â¢ ~

When President Shaffer decided to call out the
steel men in the Western mills he spoke of them as
"working in slave . pens." It appears that they are
earning $300 per month in those slave pens and don't
want to: come out. It is probable that a great many
business men would like to break into .slave; pens
where the pay is that good. " " '
The issue does not need argument in* California,
where the treaty has been fully discussed and is un
derstood by all interested in it, but there is need for
watchfulness on b'.tr part lest the advocates of the
treaty get an advantage at Washington this winter.
We may be sure that there will be a strong lobby
quite willing to sacrifice California' for the sake of
the increased trade with France and we must be ready
to guard our interests at every point.
The French treaty is unfair to many of the in
dustries of this country and is particularly so to the
industries of California. The' ratification of it would
be to deny to this ,_ Slate much of the benefits that
protection gives. Even if the people of ho other
State were affected" we would have a right to call for
a rejection of the treaty on the ground that our in
dustries should not be sacrificed to promote the
trade of Eastern manufacturers. Fortunately, how
ever, we do not stand alone. In several other sec
lions of the Union opposition to the treaty is just as
pronounced as in this State and it. is gratifying to
note that the opposition has come largely from man
ufacturers. Â¦ In fact, the wiser men engaged in that
great branch of industry are not so stupid as to
suppose that the Dingley tariff was made for them
alone. They are aware that if Congress once departs
from the true principle of a thoroughly compre
hensive system of protection they will have a hard
time in maintaining aty protection at all.
Not one of those declarations is exactly true, but
were they all true they would not constitute a suffi
cient justification for the ratification of the treaty.
The protective system advocated by the Republican
party, supported by a majority of the American
people and embodied in the Dingley tariff, is # not
confined to the protection of manufacturers. The
scope of its protection includes all American indus
tries that are in need of protection. The farmer and
the herdsman have rights and interests that must be
respected as well as those of the manufacturer, and
no schema, of protection can rightly be called an
American system unless it comprehends the welfare
of every class in the community.
In a series of resolutions on. the subject adopted
by the executive committee of the league it is de
clared, that the schedules of the Dingley tariff are
more than sufficiently high for ample protection, to
American manufactures, that the adoption of, the
treaty will open to the United States opportunities
for greater foreign markets for its 'surplus of manu
factured products and increase the trade of this coun
try with France at least $25,000,000 annually, and that
a failure to adopt the treaty may result in a general
tariff war.
FROM the general offices in' Chicago of the
National Business League there has been cir
culated a pamphlet containing the constitution
and official directory of the league, together with a
statement of the more important work in which it
is .. now - engaged. In the programme Californians
will note with interest that the league urges the adop
tion of the French reciprocity treaty as it stands,
under the plea that it is for the general interests of
the country.

near Roubaix in which women acted as
matadors drew spectators from Northern
France. Belgium and Germany. The
arena was midway between Roubaix and
Lille, and there were accommodations for
12,000 persons. About 8000 were present.
The heroine of the day was the matadora
Lollta, whose reputation for coolness and
agility is known throughout France and
South Africa. She killed three small two
year-old Andalusian bulls with wide sharp
horns. The matadora Herrelda killed
two bulls. She was nervous but the spec
tators were very little excited. The bulls
were too young to make much resistance.
Some of the spectators were angry be
cause Lollta's horse was not disembow
elled, they not being content with the sight
of the bulls' blood. The Mayor was pres
ent and the gendarmes kept order.

Captain Newton disclaims any special
credit for Agulnaldo's capture and says
that the honor belongs entirely to Gen
eral Kunston, Â¦who planned the, coup. New
ton put some of -the. machinery in opera
tion, however, by discovering some of
Aguinaldo's correspondence in one of the
insurgent leader's private postofflces. in
Manila. Newton was connected with the
police department at the time and the
correspondence served as a clew toward
locating Aguinaldo's whereabouts.
Nowton was one of the five American
officers who' were palmed off as prisoners
captured by a party , of seventy-eight
Macabebes and five Tagalos under the
command of Captain Hilario. The latter
represented .themselves as reinforcements
to Aguinaldo in answer to his request
made to General Lacuna for 400 troops.
A letter with the forged signature of Gen
eral Lacuna; was delivered to Aguinaldo.
After the latter was made prisoner he
confided to Newton that he could not
believe that Lacuna's signature had been
forged and was greatly amused 'Â¦ when he
was Informed that one of the â¢soldiers had
practiced a week before he succeeded in
making a perfect reproduction of the (gen

the Jesuit Order August 9, 1843. At the
time of the revolution in 1848, during Gari

S 1 AN JOSE, Aug. 18.â To-day marked
the fiftieth anniversary of the
priesthood of the Rev. Father Tra
verso of St. Joseph's Church in
this city. The event was celebrat
ed by the Jesuit Fathers and the members
of the parish in a befitting manner. The
religious celebration was held in the
church at 10:30 o'clock this morning, when
the sacrifice of the mass was offered by
Father Traverso himself.
A programme of special music carefully
prepared for the occasion was rendered.
The Right Reverend James D. Murray,
Bishop of Queensland. Australia, the
guest of the Jesuit Fathers, assisted at
the mass in the sanctuary and imparted
at the end of the ceremony his episcopal
blessing to the congregation. Two ser
mons appropriate to the occasion were de
livered, the first at the morning mass by
the Rev. Father Gleason, the pastor cf
the church, and the other in the evening
after vespers by the Rev. Father B. Cal
zla, former pastor of St. Joseph's.
"Hayden had authority as treasurer to
sign all checks that wore drawn in the
name of the firm. He drew checks upon
the various banks here in which. the cor
poration had deposits, and then took these
checks and deposited them in his own
bank to his own account. When he want
ed money he drew against the checks
which he had deposited to his own ac
count. He 'was receiving a large salary.
Hayden was under bond and the company
will not lose a dollar."
"The amount of the embezzlement is
between $15,000 and $20,000. It will not ex
ceed the latter figure, although we have
not completed our investigations. It will
probably take all of this week to get
tilings straightened out. The thefts have
been going on since the 1st of August.
"We have no clew as to the where
abouts of Hayden. How he came to take
the money I don't know, though i have
heard since coming here last week that he
was in the habit of betting on the
races. I can't say, however, that this is
true.
NEW TORK, Aug. 18.â The whereabouts
of John T. Hayden, the missing secre
tary-treasurer of the New York branch of
Swift & Co.: remained a mystery to-day
and to-night. Hayden disappeared last
Tuesday, after he had turned his books
over to John Chaplin, an auditor In the
Chicago offices of Swift & Co., who had
come East to make one of his periodical
inspections of the firm's accounts. Mr.
Chaplin had gone but a little way in his
work when he discovered that the ac
counts'were short several thousand dol
lars. 'Vi;
A warrant has been sworn out for Hay
den and detectives are looking for him.
The warrant was Issued on a complaint
framed on the accusation that Hayden
had appropriated 510,000. which he ob

pany's account.

goo-goo eyes Â¦ at Adam Brehm's chickens
until the fowl sought the safety of their
bulldog-guarded henhouse. Joe Burson
was coaxed into the old men's race and
when near the finish line a fence corner
bunted Into him. His friends dragged him
through the dust and across the line a
good second. Warren King appointed him
self a committee of one to secure entries
for the fat ladles' race. He sought to en
ter himself 'but was barred. H. Caveuy,
"our delegate," ; won distinction in the
merry-go-round, his Wild West exhibition
being one of the finest ever seen in this
county. George Asmussen left his "sack"
behind but he had a score of pretty girls
to console him. "Lord" Hatton covered
himself with dust and glory In the games.
r>. H. Burson sang "Oh! Where Is My
Little Red Vest?" and H. M. Martin dis
pensed large packages of philosophy.

that they saw him being paced by a motor
car. Miller has also lodged a protest
Â£gain?t Frederick.
Rivier arrived second at 10:59:46 much
fresher than Garin. In accordance with
his custom, he had followed a time table
he had prepared beforehand and he arriv
ed fourteen seconds ahead of this
schedule. Frederick and Aucouturier ar
rived together at 11:40. The former, by a
spurt, pained the lead from the final lap
at the Velodrome, but he lost it through
mistaking the ringing of a bell for Â«iie
ending ofÂ» the race. Aucouturier kept on
and pot third place.

Chlarlnl Bros.' speedy greyhound. Dew
drop, won the first prize in the open stake
yesterday at Union Park, beating F. A.
McCombs* Sir Pasha for final honors.
Followers of the game were not surprised
at the result, for on no less than four oc
casions has Dewdrop figured In the finals
eince coming into possession of the new
coursing firm. Dewdrop's victory v/as
clean cut and decisive, and his chance to
compete In the final came only after the
defeat of hard opponents.
In the second round White Hat beat
Talk to Me, a 5 to 3 favorite, and
Santonin sot the flag from Lit
tle Sister after an undecided. The effects
of Santonin's good traning were shown
in this course to the sorrow of the know
ing ones. Because of the undecided It was
figured that Santonin could not come
back and he was forced to the short end
of a 2 to 1 price. It surprised the talent
to see him lead Little Sister and outwork
her. too, for wise money in bunches had
been placed on McCombs' clever courser.
Rector, a 4 to 1 choice, went out to
Homer Boy in the third round. While the
Curtis youngster haa the speed, any clever
dog- is likely to snatch a victory from
him, and his work on the hare can be im
proved upon.
Flying Fox, contrary to former show-
Ings, got weak as the stake progressed,
and in the fifth round went out to Tyrone
Prince. Fox led a short distance but the
Prince drew out for the turn and denied
him a point. Flying Fox was a 3 to 1 fa
vorite.
Fine Fire made his best showing and

Four crack players of the California
Tennis Club visited San Rafael yesterday
and played a fast doubles match on tha
hotel courts. The contestants were W.
B. Ccllier and Harold Crowell and Frank
Mitchell and Ogden Hoffman. After a
close struggle the former team finally won
out, the score being 6-8, 6-1, 6-0, 6-4. Col-
Ikr and Crowell have been practicing con
stantly and are expected to give a good
account of themselves in the coming
championship doubles.
The Suttons, Miss May and Miss VJolet.
of Southern California, will arrive early
this week and commence training for the
championship contests to be played In
September.
Few* of the crack tennl3 players put In
an appearance at the California courts
yesterday, but the lower class men were
out In force. Probably the best match at
the local courts was between Chet ami
Grant Smith. The former surprised the
on-lookers by breaking even with his
brother. The score was 6-2, 3-6.
Al Rosenberg has taken up the game
again and is fast regaining hia former
skill. In a match with Dr. A. E. Taylor
yesterday he won in straight sets, the
score being 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. * Jack Gibson, one
of the youngest of the new men, is show- )
ing great improvement and gives promi3^
of developing into a good man. He beat
A. "Worthington 7-5.
The annual regatta of the San Francisco
Tacht Club sailed yesterday over the new
channel course seletied by the regatta
con-mlttee brought out only eight boats,
none of the large cralt, much to the dis
appointment of lovers of yacht racing,
coming to the starting line. In class 1
the sloop Mischief, sailed by George T.
S. White, was the only starter. In class
2 four sloops and the yawl Royal crossed
tlic starting line,, the fastest actual and
corrected time being made by "Westerfelcl
ai.d Morrow's sloop AeolU3, which, beat
the sloop Siren 3 minutes 15 seconds cor
rected time. In class 3 the sloops Anita,
and Dewey were the only entries, but the
little twenty-footers found it so hard to
get to windward of the starting line
ayainst the Jlood tide that it was 12:56 p.
m. before the Anita crossed It, and then
she went over the stake boat, knocking
the flag down and swamping the boat.
As the last boat finished at 2:45 p. ra
the whole race was on the flood tide, high
water being at 2:27 p. m. at Fort Potnt.
The wind was light and the sea smooth
during the earlier paxt of the race, but
towards the end the breeze freshened
somewhat. The course was across a line
between Powell-street wharf and a stake
beat anchored about 400 yards to the
northwest, leaving stakeboat on the port
hand; thence to and round, a leeward
stakeboat, leaving It on the port hand,
thence to and round Presidio Shoal Buoy,
leaving it on the port band: thence to the
starting line, finishing between the stake
boat and Powell-street wharf. The of
ficjals In charge of the race were as fol
lows: Starter, referee, judge and time
keeper, Arthur Inkersley: assistant
starter and timer, B. B. Learning; man
behind the gun. T. J. Kavanaugh.
A preliminary gun was fired at noon,
the starting gun for class 1 at 12:05 p. m.,
the starting gun for class 2 was delayed
till 12:12 owing to the failure of a car
tridge to explode, and that for class 3
was -put at 12:17 in order to allow the
proper interval of five minutes.
After the race was over Dr. T. L. Hill
had considerably difficulty In picking up
his small boat, which had been used as
the Powell-street wharf stakeboat and
had tilled. After a time, however, he
succeeded in making her fast to the yacht
and towing her home.
The regatta committee in charge of the
event consisted of Dr. T. L, Hill. W. G.
Mtrrow and J. R. Savoy. The details axe

pÂ«rf- rfHE American ship John A. Briggs
I from Tacoma yesterday
1 with, a cargo of 3147 tons of coal.
[I This is the 'vessel to which the
union would not give a crew for
less than $60 for the run. Captain Balch
refused to pay any such sum and then
the union men offered to ship for $50 for
the run and their fare back to the Sound.
This offer -vms also refused and then r an
other reduction of $10 was made, but de
clined. Just as the owners had decided to
tew the ship to San Francisco a number
of retired ship captains and owners
offered to assist in working the ship down
the' coast. Four young fellows anxious to
reach San Francisco were picked up on
the beach, and with a crew thus made up
Captain Balch put, to sea. Everything
favored the John A. Briggs at first and
when five days out she was 120 miles from
San Francisco. Captain and assistant
captains all expected to make a record
run, but the wind ; fell light and then
turned contrary, the fog came down and
after two days of gloom' the captain still
found his vessel sixty, miles from port.
Luckily a good breeze came along yester
day and the John A. Briggs made port
after a good run of eight days. - All hand3
say they had a splendid time and the trip
was like a yachting cruise. : ,
Only four of the crew, slept in the fore
castle. All the other hands bunked in the
cabin and : ate at the captain's . table.
Captain Bewail, who poses as an A.-B. on
the ship's articles, says he enjoyed every
hour of the run and, was glad to find that
he could go aloft as quickly as he did
twenty years ago. His ship is now on her
way to the Sound from Shanghai and he
will hurry back to Tacoma to Join her.
The Briggs gave the pilots a surprise off
the Heads when the pilot , flag was seen
flying, t. Captain Miller was quickly put
aboard ami he brought the ship to an
anchor in the bay. * It is rarely or ever

Hartwell was in the box for the Angels,
Iburg for the locals. In the sixth inning
Hartwell was benched and big, good-na
tured Atherton was put upon the slat. In
the eighth Iburg was retired, not because
he was being hit but because the game
was well in hand and he needed the rest.
Hart-well opened the series ! on Thursday
with more, than ordinary success and he
was saved for a graceful ending yesterday
afternoon. The ending came, but without
grace. The "Wasps put their stingers into
his curves and at the very outset riddled
him with shot. Nordyke opened with a
hit, Brockhoff following with a double,
which scored Nordyke. Before the inning
Â¦was over four men had scored on as many
hits and a couple of errors. It seemed
easy for the Hanksmen.
The crowd which packed the grounds
was ever noisy, full of voice and feet
movement. When the first inning was
over and the man at the bell. finished with
his labors it broke loose and throughout
the rest of the game furnished the excite
ment the game lacked. In the fifth Hart
well had the bunches sprung on him
again. When this session adjourned two
more runs were added to the local score.
Then Atherton was tried and found not
wanting, except in the eighth, when a
couple of good hits and an Angel error or
two gave the locals three runs. . Iburg,
Brockhoff and Schwartz were on the bags
when Park Wilson rolled out a three
bagger to right. Wilson's work is of the
star order, both with stick and behind
the cage. The score:

MORNING GAME.
Los Angeles 1, San Francisco 3.
The game at Oakland yesterday mornine
was a pitchers' battle between Jones and
Whalen.
In a full nine Innings neither team
could. add up more than four hits apiece,
and that with great difficulty.
In the first Hutchinson got his base on
four bad ones,, went out at second, leav
ing Householder safe at first. Second was
purloined and the. run made on Atherton's
hit. The score was tied the' very next
inning by Schwartz, who made first on
Kelly's error, second on Wilson's hit. third
on a steal and the return trip on Krug's
out. In the fourth the locals hit Jones for
a bunch of three hits. Hildehrand reach
inp third on one of them and scoring on
Schwartz's out.
A disagreeable feature of the fcame was
the needless and useless kicking- of the
two Relllys. Both wore tcnguesiout in
idiotic disputes with the umpire. The
score:

Graves was so raw in -his work to-day that
the infield of both teams became rattled
and made errors galore, three being cred
ited against Courtney alone. Graves quar
reled with the players and eventually be
gan fining them, but ii was too late to do
any good, and a mngnificent . exhibition
of the national pastime was spoiled. Mos
klman and Stricklett were in the box for
their respective teams and gave a mag
nificent exhibition of speed and control,
but owing to Graves' inability to judge
their work both men were charged with
bases on balls that they were not respon

baseball players. .
The young men from 1 Los
Angeles, who sometimes do diamond
stunts In nice gray suits, have been sorely
punished. Last Thursday they walloped
the San Francisco team ! on the local
grounds. Then they became boisterous,

PUEBLO. Colo., Aug. 18.â The first of
six new and enormous blast furnaces at
the Pueblo Steel Works, which take the
place of the three old ones, has just been
completed and is being "blown in." The
work of construction has been going 'on
day and night for a year and a half. The
furnace cost $750,000. It consists in the
main of a vast cylinder of boiler iron 100
feet high and lined six feet thick all
around with firebrick. The skipway, or
steel hoisting frame, on one side weighs
eighty tons. Four boiler plate sleeves for
the hot air blrist are each 100 feet high
and twenty-two feet in diameter, and are
filled with firebrick flues. These, with two
immense engines of the finest pattern,
bring the cost of the furnace up to over
31.000,000. The vork of construction of the
â¢ other five is Â¦well started.
Built by the Pueblo Steel Works at a
Cost of More Than a Million
Dollars.

The body found to-day was covered with
about two feet of earth in Ward's po
tato patch near the cabin. It Is sup
posed to be that of Kirk Shepherd, one
of the missing boys. The body was de
composed beyond recognition. A heavy
reward will be offered immediately for
Ward's capture.
Ward once asked one of the searchers
what would be done to* him if the bodies
of the missing boys were found on his
premises. When told that J he would be
strung up he acted strangely. He went
with one of the searching parties to the
creek near his house and helped hunt for
the boys, but soon made the excuse that
he must return to the house, and he has
not been seen since that day.
All three boys suddenly disappeared,
and when questioned Ward pretended to
be heart broken over the matter. Harley
returned afterward, but there were no
signs of the other two brothers. A search
ing party went through the old man's
house and all over his premises, searching
tunnels, shafts and wells, but failed to
lind the boys.

soon as he reached his majority.

buildings also have Interior fire plugs.
During the day when the campus. Is
crowded and the rooms are full of stu
dents the chances of a serious fire are not
now considered great, but at night time,
with only one .watchman to patrol the
grounds, the possibility of fire is a con
tinual terror to university men. In la
boratories where chemicals are kept and
where careless students are apt to leave
a burner or a jet lighted, fires areiiable
to occur, and do more often than the
general public is aware. Fortunately,
heretofore there has generally been a
watchman or some one else on hand to
extinguish the blaze or to summon" help
before great damage was done, and the
fact of a fire is not made known until it
leaks out weeks afterward.
This good fortune .is not always the
case, however, for in 1S97 a morning fire,
with plenty of tire-fighters on the ground,
burned the agricultural building to the
ground floor. Many of Its valuable collec
tions and books were lost. About two
years ago one rcom in the civil engineer
ing building was gutted before the fire
was stopped, and more recently the botan
ical building was damaged by a daytime,
blaze.
In West Berkeley new manufactories
are going up without fire protection, and
in Cast Berkeley there are blocks and
blocks of $10,000 residences depending on a
Contra Costa water pressure for safety
from fire. Few towns have had a faster
steady growth than this city, and there is
perhaps no place in California wherte more
and better homes are being built at the
present time. It is this rapid and healthy
growth that has made Berkeley spring
from a suburban town Into a city with
all a city's, needs and requirements.
LABOR PAET"! LAUNCHED
BY OAKLAND WORZINGMEN
Intend to Put a Complete Ticket in
the Field at the Coming
. - Election. ' â¢ . '
OAKLAND. Aug. lS.-The United Labor
party of the State of California wa3
formed in Oakland this afternoon. It was
launched with a declaration of principles,
a central organization and about 100 mem
bers who signed the declaration of princi
ples,that announced a 1 determination to
form a new party that would put a com
plete State ticket in the field.
The movement has been on foot for sev
eral weeks, but It did not take definite
shape until to-day, when a call was cir
culated for a meeting to be held in Koh
ler & Chase Hall. The call was circulated
among the laboring men, particularly the
union men, though the public was in
vited. The result was between fifty and
seventy-five men, nearly all members of
unions, who were present when C. D.
Rogers called the meeting to order. Mr.
Rogers is the State president of the
American Federation of Labor and lives
in Oakland. Mr. Rogers and all of those
who were present say that they were
there in their capacity as citizens and not
as members of the unions.
There were a number of addresses by J.
E. Holmes. P. B. Preble. J. Reboli, D. A.
Shannon and others, at the end of which
it was decided by the meeting to form a
political party that should embrace the
entire State and should have for Its ob
ject the nomination of a complete State
ticket next year. A committee composed
of P. B. Preble. C. I. Jacobs and C. A.
Sinclair was "appointed to embody that
idea in the form of a declaration of prin
ciples, and the following was the result:
Recognizing that the legislative functions of
our municipal. State and national Governments
are being usurped by organized capital, and
that monopoly and privileges control the indus
trial destinies of the* commonwealth through
existing laws and political organizations; and
believing that there is no hope of securing leg
islation favorable to the laboring people from
said political organizations, the undersigned
electors of Alarncda County, California, hereby
signify their intention of forming a new party,
to be known as the United Labor party of the
State of California, for the purpose of nominat
ing a full State ticket to be voted for at the
next general election, upon a platform pledg
ing all nominees' primarily to work and vote
for a law providing for direct legislation and
proportional representation, with such other de
mands as may be deemed expedient at the time
when the convention is held for the purpose of
nominating said ticket.
It was then decided to have a central
organization, that would take the form of
a club rather than a political central com
mittee. This club is expected to be the
nucleus of the political party, and will ex
tend the organization to San Francisco
and other places. To this end a special
organizing committee was appointed,
every member of which comes from a dif
ferent union. The regular officers and
committees are as follows:
President. J. E. Holmes: vice president, D. A.
Shannon: secretary. J. Reboli: treasurer. F. W.
Downing: organizing committeeâ C. A. Two
mey, J. Ward. C. D. Rogers, Fred Murdock, J.

HAVANA, Aug. Â¦ 18.â Chief Surgeon Ha
vard . announced to-day that the experi
ments of the division on the propagation
of yellow fever, so far as these involved the
mosquito test, will be discontinued. This
decision Â¦was taken because one of the
non-immunes who was recently bitten by
an infected mosquito died of yellow fever
to-day. The man, who was a Spaniard,
desired to become an immune and there
fore allowed himself to be bitten by an
infected mosquito. Another man who was
bitten is also .suffering from a very bad
case. Both were bitten by insects which
had been set apart for the experiments of
Dr. Caldaz, the Brazilian expert, who is
arranging to demonstrate the alleged ef
ficiency of a serum as a preventive
against yellow fever.
According to Major Havard the cases
due to mosquito infection prior to the
latest two were light, out the matter has
assumed a more dangerous form than, the
first experiments led the yellow fever
commission .to expect. The experiments
of Dr. Caldaz have not begun.

The University of California, with all its
Â¦ invaluable collections, the results of ages
or research, and its millions of dollars in
property, must depend largely, in spite
of a private water system, upon Berke
ley's fire-fighting apparatus and water
pressure for protection from fires. "Al
though the town may not in a legal sense
be required to send, its department to uni
versity fires, yet morally it is. The univer
sity has a reservoir in a canyon west of
the grounds the water in which is for flre
.fighting purposes only. The reservoir is
generally kept full and holds 300,000 gal
lons. An eight-inch main carries the water
into the grounds and past the Chemistry
building, where the pipe is reduced to six
inches, and near the gymnasium to four
inches. At least two hydrants are avail
able for each building and two and a half
inch hose sufficient to reach wherever re

all through the residence district sur
rounding the university a four-inch main
is the largest. The pipes vary in diameter
in different parts of the town from three
quarters of an inch to twelve inches. West
Berkeley is supplied with water through a
four-inch main down : Unl\-ersity avenue.
It has been the custom of the water com
pany to shut off the heavy pressure on
this pipe at night. This custom is declared
to be the 'reason why the fire in the Xie
haus mill was not extinguished shortly
after it originated.

The department does not possess a
steam fire engine and the only water pres
sure is a direct one from the hydrants. At
the Xiehaus fire a twelve-foot stream was
all that could be secured. Before the Ala

the Contra Costa Water Company the
largest main in town was a six-inch pipe

and each company is independent. The
firemen receive no pay for their services.
The apparatus consists of hose wagons,
hook and ladder trucks and one chemical
engine. This summary includes one new
and first-class hose wagon and a consider
able quantity of substantial hose. The
remainder of the fire fighting appliances,
the town offlciajs acknowledge, vary from
the moderately serviceable to the prac
tically useless. Some of the companies
pull their apparatus by hand, some
have horses and others borrow teams
when they can get them. The volunteer
firemen receive both praise and con
demnation for the work they do, but their
ability or lack of ability is not material,
considering the difficult conditions under
which they work.

In gold was brought in from the Rand
during July has done but little to offset
the feelings of tax-payers, who have spent
over Â£5.000,000 on the war during the same
period, with the prospect of continuing the
same indefinitely. Barring unforeseen de
velopments of an unfavorable nature, it
is probable that a healthy upward move
ment is rot far off: but the likelihood is
that several false starts will be made be
fore this movement is fairly inaugurated.
Stocks were generally higher and busi
ness took a wider range. The attendance
upon the exchange is still meager, owing
to the holiday, but there are indications
of legitimate buying for Investment in the
case of gilt-edged securities, Including
American railroad shares. This movement
is accepted by many as indicating: that the
tide had finally turned and that better
times ar,c ahead after a long period of
stagnation.
Signs are not wanting, however, that the
professionals are making a preconcerted
effort to work up a boom in all sections
of the Stock Exchange, leading off with
Kaffirs on the strength of a few gold ship
ments already received; but conditions do
not favor such a movement. The steel
strike is still a dark cloud over the Amer
ican section.
LONDON, Aug. IS.â The Stock Exchange
settlement last week passed easily. Money
was quite plentiful, so much so as to In
duce talk of a reduction of the bank rate
to 2Vs. But conservatives argue against
this disappointing outlook that there Is
certain to be a gold drain toward the
United States In mid-September, when the
twenty-six and a half millions reserve will
not be too large to meet demands.
Steel Strike Has Depressing
Effect on American
' Securities.

Money Plentiful in

It needs more than the simple "say so"
to skip gracefully from the legitimate to
the vaudeville stage, easy as the step
seems to be. Vaudeville has its geniuses
as particular and imperative as any re
quired on the legitimate stage, and r.oi
by^any means to be regarded with the
condescension usually bestowed upon its
every feature (save the financial) by the
legitimists. Last night Louise Thorndyke
Bouclcault. she of the v.-:ilowy form and
blonde frowze, who couldn't and who
wouldn't ever, ever, ever enter vaude
ville, made her debut therein at the Or
pheum. neither to the particular advan
tage of the bill or her own reputation.
Mrs. Bouclcault is concerned in the pro
duction of a little comedy by Augustus
Thomas, "A Proper Impropriety," that is
bad or good according to its handling. It
fell pretty fiat last night, though Her
bert Pattee, Mrs. Boucicault's support,
worked overtime in his desire to liven
things up. The star herself, is out of ber
element. There is no'time in a twenty
minute turn for serpentine posings, whore
the American Bernhardt is at her best,
and snap, vim, salt, 'go, are all lacking
in., her performance. She has not the
patois, accent, pitch of the variety stage,
andjis even wanting in voice to filPthe
large hall.
But the Orpheum bill -was extra fine,
even despite the comparative failure of
one turn, and also In spite of the fact
that the other debut of the evening did
not come off. Miss Katherine Germaine,

Many have doubtless been curious about

however, proved a very popular substi

success, and among other newcomers the
clever Cragg family of acrobats proved a
very enjoyable addition. Lefebre and his

The next month or so will see many
changes la the personnel of the Southern
Pacific Company's executive staff. Pres
ident Hays had just about surrounded
himself with men of his own selection and
everything looked lovely for a continu
ous run of five years at $65,000 a year
with never a thought of politics.. 'Now
comes a change in the land. The execu
tive positions of the future will without
doubt be held by men friendly to H. E.
Huntingdon,- and every incumbent who
fails to meet with favor in the nephew's
eves must hunt a job elsewhere. These
changes will take place and until they are
made there will be considerable nervous
tension in local railroad circles.
When the rumor of Hays' resignation,
by its refusal to be silenced, began to re
ceive the consideration of officials whose
right to the yellow jacket ctapends on
presidential sunshine, there" was consid
erable uneasiness all down the line. It
was the uneasiness of suspense, a sort of
hanging in the air which would have to
continue until the suspended one had dis
covered a safe alighting place. The Call
has shown them how the land lies, and
some of them started yesterday on the

Samuel Morse Felton; though not known
personally to the local railroad family,
is well known by reputation. His per
sonality has been felt wherever he has

Although rumors of the resignation of
President Hays from the Southern Pa
cific Railroad have . been freely circu
lated during the last two months the an
nouncement of the name of his successor
made exclusively yesterday in The Call,
caused a big stir in railroad circles.-
