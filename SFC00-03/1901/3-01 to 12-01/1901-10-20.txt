young man filled the position with, great
honor to himself and to the delight of

nobleman a world of fine qualities to ad

In a moment the door evened and (he

my youth I studied at fialamanca, at
Rome and In JJnzlanfl. t know something
of the European tongues and trust that
as a teacher of la.r.jjtjrur*-* I may not be
found altogether wanting."
The good Bishop was at on^ Intr-reÂ«tcÂ£|
He soon discovered that his gucut was a. *
that he professed and even moreâ a ir.aa
ter of seven of the principal languages,
all of wh'ch he spoke with Â«jual fluency:
and his knowledge of the various litera
tures was something remarkableâsome
thing rarely met with outside cloistered
balls. Then, too, the man wan in all
I seeming the most devout of Christians and
this further established him in th<- good
will of the generous-hearted Bishop.
Bishop AverardI was cnptlva;* d with tho
young gentleman. "You are welcome,"
said be, "My home and my services are
at your command. Remain v/ltb me fur
the present and trust me that a suitable,
position >hall be pnn'ided."
It Is not surprising that the Bishop was
captivated with his gueet, for had not
this gentleman's great learning and abil
ity been demonstrated to him 7 Then did
he not look the nobleman to the very life?
He was simply magnincent to look at; 23
years of age, tall, graceful and accom
plished In every conceivable manner. He
was one of the falreat types of blonde,
with great blue eyem that gave him the
look of a calnt or a' martyr, as the change
of expression played over a countenance
that was radiant.
In a few days the Count was Installed ss
private secretary to a gentleman of great
waltb who owned an immense hacienda
x/'ar the City of Mexico. This gentleman
|-5enor Garcia Bisnerosâ received the
Jtraug* Count into his castle on recom-
Biendatloas from Dlthop Avtmrdl, and 0 {
Of course there were surmises and sus
picions of some fair divinity somewhere,
whose soul held In thrall even the elusive
love of a man far off among strange and
beautiful women. But these whisperings
were not tangible and the mystery re
mained unsolved, as the Count was 'well
able to keep his own counsel.
Things stood just so one lovely evening
when the military baud was filling thÂ«
sir with such music as might have drawn
wild beasts from their lairs, so great was
Its charm. It did draw all the wealth and
beauty of that music loving city within
Its enchanting sounds. All but the Count
Dlvizza. .whose carriage .was nowhere to
be seen.. A- psychic, quiver seemed to
shake. the still, warm air, as if with some
suggestion of calamity. The question was
en many lips: "Where. Is the Count Dlvlx
sii?" for this T most interesting of gentle
men had endeared himself to- all with
whom he came In. contact, and on occa
sions such aa this he was never absent.
Very early In the evening Senor Sis
neros was 'seen to leave the circle and
drive toward home. Soon after others fol
lowed. As . they drove through the city
mounted' police were dashing in ail direc
tions and before the nearest carriage
could reach Its destination It was told all
over the city that the Count Divizza had
robbed Senor Slsneros and escaped sv'th
H0.00O worth of old family [ jewels and
J2S.OCO in cash.. Consternation -held the
friends and admirers of the young Count
dumb. For every one In that multitude
belonged to either the one class or the
other. Because of his coolness to the la
dle* he had not earned the jealousy of tha
men: and for the same reason he had not
made enemies of the ladles.' as he treated
all with equal courtesy. â¢''
Mexico City slept little that nlgfct-the
police and detectives not at all. The city
and country was searched as If by a cy
clone, and the train, that left a few mo
ments after the Count was' last seen, was
.boarded at every station by local detec
tives. ' All In vain: not a trace of tha
man nor of the valuable plunder was
anywhere to be found.
Many there were who believed that tas
Count In some mysterious manner was
spirited away by the real robbers, and
this. If true, would have been a relief to
the gentleman who trusted â¢ him so lm-
FIFTEEN mcnths ago when the Es
perarza reached the port of Vera
Crux a tall and aristocratic-looking
young gentleman, carrying a small
hand-crip, stepped up to the ticket
offlce and purchased a ticket to Mexico
City-
A close observer would have seen, with
out doubt, that it took apparently his last
money, as it looked for a time as If ho
would never really f.nd the small sum re
quired. A carevrcrr. look did not leave his
**Â«â¢ during the short but tiresome Jour
ney: not even when the capital was
reached.
On alighting from the train he walked
to a fashionable hotel and registered as
Count DIvisza cf Florence, Italy.
"I expect my trunks later." he Vaid to
the clerk, simply. "Give me a good room.^
His splendid sppar-rance did more than
the urcsence or absence cf luggage.* and

The Tempting of

DO yoa know what a manchu Is?
N*o? \Tell. they are Just the
rwcllest of the swell these days.
The Chinese Imperial family used
to be terribly exclusive In every
thlTjp. particularly their clothes. It was
and Is a crime for an ordinary Chinese to
wear the color, make and style of the
royal family. But It Is far from being an
offense for the American girl to wear
them.

vr<r?e still. Fhe could appear outside of
her own room in a pretty, snug fitting tea
eown. but the manchu looks very queiÂ»r
and out of place with stays on. Anyhow it
is more comfortable to get the stiff things
. !T. and so it happens that the newest and
prettiest lounstnK grown has been bor
rowed frcm th* Chinese nation.
They look something like a Japanese ki
mono. In fact, at first glance one might
tay. "what a handsome kimono that It."
Eut there are two prominent differences.
All of them are made high necked. A

about the threat is not as comfortable a*
the cool V-shaped Japanese costume, ami
It js no< as picturesque, but thttt part of
it is Chinesey.

the front. As a rule they can be folJed
cither one way or the other. Just as the
wearer pleases, but the manchus button
down one side and under the arm. It is
not a question of pleasure, but one of ne
cessity.
They look awfully Oriental: just the
fcrig-hest and the greatest quantity of col
ors that can be conceived; a lavender
lined with pink, royal blue with green,
and all such combinations.
One cf the swellest is a cross between a
preen and a yellow. It is neither cr.*
thing nor the other, but a happy outcome
e>? the two. All thrcugh the silk are lxrÂ£4
round brocaded pieces with Chinese char
acters embroidered In them. Tha border
ts composed cf seven different colors
strapped on one over the other.
First a tiny band cf silver, then a nar
row strip of pink embroidered with (low
Â«t* and the silver apain. To give a little
tone, a narrow piece of black satinâ Just
6 tuÂ«iÂ»lcionâ divide* the silver from an
â¢)th*r pink piece, and then comes the
band of black heavily embroidered
la butterflies and flowers. All colors of
\u25a0;.n* rainbow and several others added be
- --- make it beautiful and fancy.
Tha band runs all about the neck, down
â¢ - front of the skirt and about the bot

gay and are particularly barbaric; . red
green, purple and all sorts of heathenish
combinations. . The colors . are strapped
with blue. .gold, silver and red. while the
silk Itself" is covered with flowers. Most off
the designs 'are made In a circular plan
and the flowers would make a garden
blush for shame.
The regular Chinese trousers are worn
when the costume Is complete, but few
girls wear them, as they are decidedly too
much trouble. It is far easier to slip them
on over skirts than to take the time and
bother to make the manchu look entirely
at home. Again, the trousers call for Chi
nese shoes, for nothing looks so absurd
as tiny American shoes or" slippers peep
ing out from under the Oriental dress.
One that ts stiff enough to stand alone Is
made of a royal blue. There is no necessity
for a lining and so for a wonder the one
color Is on both sides. The trimmings are
light blue and pink brocaded In silver;
Just dainty, but not such a mixture as tha
majority of them. The silk Is handsonw
enough to dispense with much of the glit
ter. But because it sounds simple do not
&t the idea Into your head that It IÂ»
cheaper than the others. Most people
know the full value of sweet simplicity.
The most gorgeous one of the entire six
Is made of a lavender. A heavy satin,
brocaded, with birds and trees, forms tha
body of the garment. The trimming,
which Is about a foot wide ordinarily,
doubles Itself on the sides and makes a
yoke effect In the tack. The greatest
part of the band Is black satin, the only
other color being a broad sold braid. Tha
flowers and butterflies are of the sold,
but they are In raised work and so show
oft to the best advantage. The buttons
are small sold ones and the straps are of
black; so the entire manchu Is made of
contrasting colors and the effect 13 strik
ingly swell.
Some of them are In very light colors.
A light blue satin makes a most bewitch
ing negligee, tut it takes awfully swell
petticoats to go-with It. The border fa of
pink, embroidered with flowers In natural
colors, then a tiny ptece of silver and a
blue band covered with butterflies in gold.
A low yoke effect In both back and front
Is carried out with the numerous bands,
heedless tc say. the trimming Is the most
striking part of It. unless It U the peculiar
I Ehade of pink that makes a swell llnins.
When the skirt opens on either side and
a suspicion of the pink shows at the bot
tom and at the sleeves th* entire manchtt
presents a gay front.
Ths most serviceable of all Is a red and
preen changeable silk. Running all
through the silk are palms and flowers.
The decoration Is a little out of the or
dinary. The silk is the dark part and the
embroidery the light. The seven bands
are there, and the colors are" exactly as
gay/ but the design is a little different,
too. The dragon shines In all his horrible
eplendor and Is kept within bounds by
black satin straps. This one Is very light
In weight, and there is not very much,
warmth In It, as it Is tmiineiJ. but pride
usually goes a long way toward keeping
people warm when there 13 something
beautiful to shew.
Â«So If you have anywhere from $50 to $1Â»
that you don't know" tiow to spend, get a
royal gown and tcke consolation In tha
fact that they are three things â swasser.
becoming and imperial.

you stand upon a genuine Oriental rug it
is made perhaps of wool from a sheep
which was nourished by grass that grew
on the site of Babylon or Troy. Per
haps the goat whose gray hair made Its
warp had chewed up roses that grew 'on
Omar's grave, near Nlshapur, or ' wan
dered through the grove that now stands
on the site of the Garden of Eden. Of
course, mementoes are not so much ex
cept In themselves; however,' the pos
sessor of such a rug, which' has in addi
tion been prayed upon by a genuine
Mohammedan, may display It with more
pride than did the returned tourist In
the story, his basket full of noses which
he had knocked from marble statues as
souvenirs of their beauty." \u25a0
Here is the way that the rug weavers
get their wonderful eolers: (

would be dearer than If they had come
Into the family with what may accurate

"In any event it in best to recognize
first as well as last that you cannot now
secure desirable Oriental rugs for a sons;.
Even though they should be sold In the
Orient at what- we consider most reason
able prices It must not be forgotten that
the duty upon them Is in per cent ad
valorem and 10 cÂ«nts per square foot
direct. When transportation and ordi
nary business profits of Jobbers are
counted, the foreign fabric - necessarily
calls for a substantial price. Who sells
an Oriental rug very cheap is selling a
very cheap Oriental rug as well.

rugs have, and that Is as mementoes or

introduction of Western methods, dyes

sign used from the Bosphorus to Belu

for "cheap" rugs. They no more deceive
the careful observer, even if he be with

American be deceived by a flag of his

ford says:
"Out of the years spent In the work
little time has been devoted tb the fanci

Its poesy and romance have in a measure
been accepted as corollaries, assumed as
among the reasons for the book's exist

the presentation. To those who have al

lack. , ...
"What of, color has been distributed

to those who are still groping In the dark
belief that rugs are merelyâ rugs. If too
little of tlnsent has been employed It Is
because the fabrics themselves, properly

than can any vocabulary or any thesaurus

Speaking of the Tcherkess (Circassian)

He says:
"The Tcherkess rujrs are few In Ameri

reason la found In tho fact that the Tciier
ktsb people as a race, are routed, dissolved,
destroyed. This sturdy, comely and un
principled race, whose women filled the
seraglios, nnd whose men the guards, of
the Turkish Sultans, and* whose long,
fierce struggle against Russian supremacy
amazed Europe, is to-day as a race ex
tlncl. Finding it Impossible to withstand

shores of the Black Sea; is to-day unpeo
pled save for a tribe or two of mixed Cir
cassian blood, and a handful. of Russian or
German immigrants huddled here and
there. When In 1S64-5-6 these eJclles ca # me

gared, bereft of everything In the way ut
earthly goods, and lived in preiatory fash;
Ion, stealing where chance offered. "With

there* was small and rude pretense at de

tious of their fabrics, white areas were
frequent, and the few. tints usod were of
the moet elementary kind. Hues of this

It is owing to the fact that Russia.
Germany and Kngland. all have predatory
railroads running. Into the rug countries,'
that rugs are now so plentiful and 'cheap.

saw w:iÂ» of finer weave than their own

gain. Tho coatwas worth one dollar and:
a half. The blanket would now easily
bring one hundred and fifty dollars. Tho

this he presents a~ series of short essays

THE INVITATION EXTENDED. <
They were called by the porter early the
next morning. The train was pulling into
Washington, five hours late. ' Grenfall
wondered, as he dressed, whether, fortune
would permit him to see much of her dur
ing her brief day in the capital. He
dreamed of a drive over tha avenues, a
trip to the monument, a visit to tha halls
of Congress, an Inspection of public build-
Ings, a dinner at his mother's home,
luncheon at the Ebbitt and other atten
tions which might give to htm every mo
ment of her day in Washington. , But even
as he dreamed he - was . certain that his
hopes could not be gratified.
After the train had coma to a standstill
he could hear, the rustle of, her garments
in' tbe nest, 'compartment. * Then he
heard her sweep . Into the - passage,
greet her uncle and aunt, utter a -few
commands to the maid, and. while- he was
adjusting his collar and necktie, puss from
the car. - No man ever made quicker time
In dressing than - did Lorry. She could
hardly have believed \u25a0 him Ideal had she
seen his scowling face or heard the words
that hissed through his impatient teeth.
"She'll get away.' and that'll be the end
of- it," he growled, selling his traps ur.il
rushing from the train two minutes after
her departure. Tbe porter attempted to
relieve him of his bags on the platform,
but he brushed hip aside and was off to
ward the station. ' V
"Nice time. for you to call a man, Vou.
Idiot,"' was his parting shot for. tha por
ter, forgetting, of . course, that tha for
eigners had been called at the same time.
With eyes intent on the crowd ahead; ha
plunged along, seeing nobody In his disap
pointed flight. "1*11 never forgive myself
if I, miss her." he was walling to himself.
She was not- to be seen In the waiting
rooms, SO he rushed to the sidewalk.

It. was then that I told him to start his
train If he dared. That man will never
know how close he was to death. One
minute passed, and he coolly announced
that - hut one minute was left.* I had
made up my mind to give him one of my
pIstnlH when the tlmo wus up and to tell
him to defend himself. It was not to be a
duel, for there was nothing regular about
It. It was only a question as to whether
the train should move. Then came the
â¢Hound: of currluge wheels and galloping
horses. "Almost before we. knew -It you
wore with \it. " I am' so happy that you
wcie not a minute later."
There wan something no cool and grim
in the quiet. voice, something so deter
mined in those brilliant eyes, that Gren
fall f,elt like looking up the conductor to
congratulate him. Tho dinner wtA
served, and- while It was belns discussed
his fair companion of the drive graphi
cally described the experience of twenty
ctrange minutes In a shackle-down moun
tain coach. He was surprised to V 4 that
\u25a0he omitted no' part, not even .", hand
clasp or the manner in which i\w clung
to him. Ills cars burned as he listened
to this i frank. confesuion. \u25a0 for he expected
to hoar words of disapproval; from

"Here Is the waiter," the girl observed,
to his relief, i "I am famished after my

not Mr. Grcrifall Lorry?"
"Give me a mountain ride always as an

ended the jest about a name.

"I'll confess there were times when I
thought we were rolling down the moun

of the head.'
"Sjmotlmcs T thought we were soaring

claimed Uncle Caspar, his eyebrows ele

"Why, Uncle Caspar has fought more

proudly.

Her blue cjes are full of gentleness and dignity. Her well
â¢ JL poised head is set above shapely shoulders. The ulenderness whlchy
still characterized her when she was taken. to England, In. 1387 has. gone,
but she'ls tall and of excellent carriage (and does not seem to.be stout.
She 13 always well and appropriately dressed In quiet taste, nnd she has a
liking for the real In everything from lace to life Itself. She Is a woman
much beloved by her motheMn-law. There are volumes in that. \u25a0\u25a0â¢ A'n
Mrs. Piper Is of good-New England stock, gently bred In n household
of Puritan aspiration, appreciation of education and firm prnnl tie convic
tion that Truth was pretty well nettled and defined 'for all time at the date
of the arrival of the Pilgrim Fathers, who brought it over with them U:
the Mayflower to Plymouth Bay. There are plenty of people in Boston,
Salem and (In summer and autumn) all along the stern and rockhounii
exclusive and fashionable shore of Massachusetts Bay who cherish a no
tion that Truth really came over with the finer and leas: homespun folk
who arrived a little later with Governor Wlnthrop In the Arbella at MAn
cbcster by the sea. Just beyond what Oliver Wendell Holmes called Bev

But In Mrs. Piper's democratic, eager young mind neither superstition
prevailed. She w "wanted to know," not in the usualYunkee ncceptntlon
of the rural phrase, but with whflt Hawthorne hinted Is the passion or
the New England i temperament, beneath' Its seeming coldness, th* nrc
of love for knowledge and for wisdom, the restless eagernces for more and
more of the. good thing* of understanding. Whftn she married, young, and
went to live. In Boston shÂ« had not read or studied a fraction of what she
wished. She found herself In an environment v/hcre books were admired,

Mrs. Piper's Extraordinary Statement.
The tlase havir.s presented itself when It seems pos#IMÂ« for me to b*.
liberated from the Society for Psychical Kesearch, I desire to state a few'
facts.
I trill beein by saying that publicity has* always been distasteful to me..
3iy hctne duties have bren and are the chief course of my greatÂ»mt picas-,
vre. Kut as my r.am* has bÂ«Â«>n before the public for fourteen years. whllÂ»;
ray case has Lecil stÂ«j"liÂ«*d. arÂ»<l as the subject of psychic phenomena ha*,
especially of late arcÂ»:scd public attention, I believe it \n rifjht for me. In
res!im!rg frcm the Mrvtce of the Psychical Research Society, to speak
frankly to the public in my own individuality, in response to :hs rfcqusftt
cf the New York licrald.
In the ctrvice of th<e society I "have acted simply as an autpmaton.
rolr.tr into what is Â«.alÂ»od a trance condition to ho. studied fdr purposes of
fcdentiSe lavesUgsUctt. and also for the comfort and help of many suffering
souls who have accepted the spiritistic explanation of the words which 1
unconedouEiy *=po!:e while In this dreamy staf*.
It Is undeniably true that many bereave*! people have been at least
temporarily comforted in -sorrow. This is in itself a compensation for lor*
devotion to this v/ork. Apart from this. I do not feel that the world at
large has derived a Â«ufficient i-encflt from the many years' Investigation
of rny case to warrant my continuing In it. Besides, personal circitn
ttances are ruch that it -would be Impofslble for me to dn so.
After having (riven so many years of my life to this work. I now desire
to become a freÂ«j agent, and devote myself and my time to ether and more
ccrjjr*-nial pursuits. . â¢
The world to-day knows that among scientific mtn the opinions on
pyychic phenomena are many and varied. I have always mAlntnlned lhat
thefy* phenomena conld be explained in other ways than by the interven
tion of disembodied tDlrit forces.
The theory cf teJenathy utronply appeals to me ss the roost plauslbl*
end genuinely gcientlSc solution of the problcmi Tc strengthen tills opin
ion are many authentic experiences which have all been satisfactorily'
explained by means of tee telepathic hypothesis.
Telepathy, Not Spiritualism.
I an inclined to accept the telepathic explanation of all of the no
called psychic phenomena, but beyond this I remain a student with thÂ«
rest of ih* Trorld.

In leaving the service cf the Psychical Research Society I wish to state
cls clearly and definitely as possible mr true position In regard to my re
lations with the Bodety and my own views on the subject, which has
eroijs*d eo ranch public attention during the ls*t few yearn, r
Only by the tnereEt chance did I discover that I possessed a power
wholly unczplalnabie to ray self and mystifying to ray family and frienda.
Jt was on account of my desire to understand the phenomenon and prove

placed myself In the hand* of honored scientific men, who cxpreeae^. the

A Scientific Explanation of It All.

â¢jf \"The Law of Psychic Phenomena," etc., has this to say of Mrs.
HlXfPlper'e remarkable- powers: \. '. . ,
1 - Before proceeding to . estimate the evidential valve of Mrs.
JL Piper's so-called "spirit phenomena.** it Is but fair to concede that
she Is honest, and that the Information which constitutes tho basis of her
"communications". to her sitters Is obtained by supernormal means. It
must also be concededâ nay. Insisted uponâ that her. phenomena belong- to
the only class from which proofs can possibly be derived of the. trust origin,
of her communications." Physical phenomena, such as table tipping, etc..
possess in themselves no evidential value whatever, for It Is only by sn
analysis of the content of \u25a0'messages" that their source can be determined.
-'. ; In short, all- things considered, she Is probably the best Vpsycbiof* now
before* the public for the scientific investigation of spiritism; and It must
be admitted that if her -alleged 'communications from discaxnata spirits
cannot be traced to any' other source, the claims of spiritism have beÂ«n
confirmed. â¢ â¢â¢ â¢<-;â¢:. ';\u25a0Â« .-..''-_. ' . â-." â¢ 'â¢ -

In Mrs. -Piper's flr*t trances she was taken possession of by the spirit
claiming to be Dr. liilmilt. his full name John Phlnult Schlevelle, a

world of spirits wan to communicate with those living on earth and prove
to them- the existence of spirits. It was: noted that this Frenchman of
French. birth spoke In English, with a French accent; that his use of that
language wns limited to a few phrases and not always correct. ...
In explanation of tbls.it waa said that, aa Mrs. Piper was English,
only that language could be used. >At first Dr. Phinult confined his efforts
to interpreting between-Mrs. Piper and the'splrlts, but later he talked with
her about himself nnd life In the snlrlt world. . ' . ",\u25a0
A remarkable thing wns that Mrs. Plpcr'8 voice changed according to
the nationality of theisplrlt speaking. If )t were a man* she spoke with a
man'n volc*i; if a child,' with a child's vo'ce; if an Irishman, with the flavor
and nccent of the Irish tongue'. It wrs' observed that the Piper spirits,

a higher order of spirit, not of mortals; but of a godlike power. To this

Story of a Boston Physician.
Once when an old Boston physician had a sitting with me It .Â«errnÂ«
that I talked most about a pencil nhioh was put Into my hands. It h.ivlnp
twen the property of a deceased friend. When I came out of the' condition
fc* drew himself t:p in. his chair and said, with excusable grtjfTnoss:
"What made you talk about nothing but the top of an old pencil "
Why didn't you talk about God and tho anpols?"
"What do you know about fJod nnd the angels?" I could not help
retorting. He was good enough to smile, for of course the pencil was part
of the sclentlflc test and the other talk would not have been.
OneÂ© when another and still more famous Boston doctor cair.e to sÂ«- v
me, he eaid afterward that he. "found Mrs. Piper huffy, but got on the
good tide of her by caressing her children."

A European Hallucination.
When I was taken to England the wife of one of 'the celebrated English
men of edenc*- met me with the exclamation to her husband:
"Is this lire. Piper? You don't mean to tell me that this In Mm.
Piper!" Then to me: "I thought you would be Euro to be very fat and like
magenta color and wear frlselettes!"
TbesÂ« words In her rich English voice made us both exnilÂ«. but we aft
erward became good friends.
I have been to fortunate as to make rood friends and pleasant ac
quaintances through my work. 8ome of them do and some do not b*llev*
that spirits have rpoken through me. I do not think that even those who
do have liked to see nvs mentioned in print, as I have been, as "the human
telephone to the next world."

What Scientists Have Said of Mrs. Piper.
y N view of Mrs. Piper's extraordinary confessionâ calm, dignified, pro
1 foundâ it will be Interesting to read what scientists of England and
I America eafcJ of her; what experts thought of her psychic manifests-
Jl tloni and her personality, together with the description of "how she
did it."
The strongest c!Â»lm made for Mrs. Piper has always bÂ«en that "she Is
hcnÂ«iU" Professor Nathaniel S. Bhalcr said he believed that "she herself
is honert. but that whatever the medium Is, I am convinced that this In

Professor Janvs. professor of psychology at Harvard, said: "Taklns
everything that I know of Mrs. Piper into account. thÂ« result Is to make
me fec;| absolutely certain that she knows things In her trances that she
cannot pofflbly have had knowledge of In a waking state, and that the
definite philosophy of her trances Is yet to be found."
Professor Charlee Eliot Norton, proreseor of art and literature at Har
vard, raid: "J nw things at these sittings which appeared marvelous and
Incomprehensible to me. I do not attempt to explain them. I believe,
however, that hers Is a field for the fullest ockntiflo Investigation."

satisfactorily to explain to himself or
any one else the origin' and destination of

ii bunted with powder and shot. This Is
a brllllant'hued creature, highly valued
by collectors. It Is very shy and hovers
about vvx*t branch** of th* trees, seldom
approaching within twenty feet of the

raens In collodions were frayed and be
draggled Individuals, which, because of
Injuries to their wings, had dropped be

American naturalist went to Australia, de
termined to get some perfect itpecimens of
this rare insect. For several days he
strove with long nets and short nets to
entrap some of tbe beautiful creatures of
the upper air. He raised ladders and
climbed trees at the peril of life and limb,
but tbe wary butterflies kept beyond the
range of his swooping net. Yankee In
genuity was not to Ire beaten bo easily,
however. The entomologist hit upon the
brilliant idea of a decoy.

the patient collector was able to cap

Somewhat similar' was the capture of
*om* rare South American butterflies sev
pral years ago. An entomologist traveling
on the Orinoco failed, after many at
tempts, to take a single specimen of a
swallow-tall butterfly, which haunted the
uppei foliage of the forest. One day his
party came across a band of half-savage
native armed with biowguns, bows and
spÂ«arÂ«, one of whom offered to supply the
collector with a number of the desired In
sects at a price. An offer of 25 cents a
specimen represented opulence to the naA
tlve, who returned on the following even
ing with six of the butterflies, all perfect
or nearly bo. How the Indian could catch
the shy and delicate Insects which he him
self with all the implements of the chase
could not capture was a problem to .'the
traveler. Not until he was about to leave
would the native explain. His method
was very tslmple. he said, and pointed to
his blowgun, a weapon with which these
people are marvelously accurate and
deadly marksmen, even killing big game
with darts blown from them. He had
"marked down" his butterfly, waited for
It to alight and then nhot a pellet to the

pulls a wire which sets fire to the fuse,

The harpoon-gun is a ponderous piece
of apparatus placed on a raised platform
on the prow of the whaler and consists
of a short, stout cannon, mounted on a
pedestal, on which it can rotate
horizontally. The gun has also a vertical
motion, and can be turned quickly in
whatever direction the prow 'of ' the ship
dominates. On the top. of the 'gun are
"sights" for aiming, just as in a rifle. 'Be
hind is the stock, which is grasped in u.e
hand when . firing the gun, and beneath
it the trigger.' The breech is a box-like ar

Is fastened. to the gun proper. The gun is
loaded in the ordinary way from the muz

into it. " To discharge the j gun a, small
cartridge with a wire attached Is first put
into, the. breech. on the trigger
causes a pull on the wire, which ignites
the cartridge and discharges the gun .si

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 19.
âThe weather has been decidedly
cooler this week than last, con
sequently progress in the. building
up of . the big eleven has been quite
satisfactory. The . result of the game
with the Olympics on the 12th inst. led
many people to suppose thai- the cardinal
eleven had taken a "slump." Trainer
"Dud" Moulton says the men were In
good condition and that was evidenced
tunlty to apply the hackamore while herd
ing cattle on the rodeos. As th!3 work
necessitates ..much zigzag riding young
horses soon become extremely handy In
.^hanging from one course to another. A
horse, well broken to the hackamore will
check himself from full speed to a stand
still with less jar to his rider and himself
than when broken by any other method.
. If duty calls the vaquero to' town and
the distance to be traveled be a few
miles, he still continues sending the horse
a zigzag course, adding probably a third
to the distance, just for the practice It af-.
ford's the horse.- j .
Some of the Burllngame Country Club
polo players have from time to' time se
cured ponies educated with tha hacka
, more after cattle and have been able to
put them in the game at once. The great
amount of practice they had received on
the. range fitted them for the polo field.
.They were merely following a v different
kind of object. , Once It moved it was
second nature for them to follow it wher
ever It was driven.
Practical horsemen affirm that any sad*
die horse will be Improved by being brok
en originally to the hackamore. A man
of wide experience In the Irish himtlng
field says his experience with, the backa
more in California has shown him tt
would be a marked acquisition as a part
of the saddlery of any banting establish
ment. It would be particularly desirable
to use on a horse the day after he has
bad severe work in the hunting: field. The
mouth Is then more or less tender from
the severe use made of It en the hunting
day. Sportsmen are not always bleosd
with exercise boys with. light bands and
the hackamore would afford the monthi
the opportunity to regain Its normal coa
dltlon. â¢
There Is an article tzsed chiefly fa Eng
land inA Ireland called thÂ» cauvescn, which,
closely v resembles the nackamore. It is
used only for leading purposes and Is es
pecially useful in training young horses, ta
Jump.
The foundation la a steel band wttft
three hinges, one on the nose and one en
each cheek. The band, carefully padded.
Is attached to a headstall, two straps fas
tening it firmly at the jaw. The leading
rein Is buckled at the part resting on the
nose: This brings all the pressure on thÂ«
horse's nose and renders him much more
easily handled than would be possible
with a plain halter on which the horse
can exert all the power of his neck, and
shoulders.

riety of designs. '
The Mexicans soon found that hacka
raoref made of hair were more effective
In breaking young horses than were those
of rawhide. The rough hair irritated' the
sensitive spot on the nose just above the
nostrils and below the bone, and made the
horse, more tractable. â¢ .
'When a horse at four years of age is
given* into the bands of a vaquero to
break for saddle purposes he at once rides
him a few times, umlvs a plain bit and not
the popular 8pa.nish bit. The hackamore
Is then put on In addition to the bit.' It
is fastened tightly above the nostrils so
it 'will not slip about when pressure is
placed on the rein. It is always used
with" a fixed martingale, which is short
i and prevents the horse throwing his head
in the air. thus relieving the pressure on
his nose, when the effect is lost.
At this stage, of the horse's education
i the bridle rein Is fastened to the pommel
> of the caddie "and no pressure Is brought
to bear on the bit for probably, a- month
or more. This Is permitted to form grad
ually the proper snaffle brtdle mouth,
which makes it a pleasure to ride the
horse, as It gives him a sensitive mouth.
This is so highly developed that the prop
erly broken horse anticipates every move
ment ef his rider's hands, requiring no
pressure on .the reins to turn either to
the right or the left or to stop quickly
without any perceptible jar.
The vaquero is afforded an ideal oppor-

Abrasions .and' cuts should be treated
carefully to prevent blood poisoning. The
wounds must ' not come in contact with
the clothing and they must be carefully
cleansed and disinfected.
Neglect of these precautions is criminal.
It may lead to long illness, .loss, of a
limb or even to death. * - - . .
Wash the cut or abrasion with a solu
tion; of lysol. If not too deep use col
lodlum to heal the wound. In deep cuts
that have to be washed out from day to
day I use' arhstol~a powder-and a cov-
erlnf of sterlHzea 1 gause and the usual
bandage. If the wound becomes inflamed
and swelling sets 'in, go to a physician
atonce. That is [ for him, not for the
trainer or the player j himself, to 'treat.'

A player may go stale In one night by

The only safeguard Is for you to watch

sprinter, the hope of his college, an athlete
who was performing wonders. One day ho
foolishly gave way to his enormous appe
tite and ate a ridiculously large amount of
beefsteak. Jt made him sick, he w*.Â»t
stale, his trainer failed to g*-t him back In
condition, and he lost all IiIh events nrvl
his college the annual field day.
Don't indulge In the luxury of a hot
bath. When you com*? in from practice
go over the body with a rough towel. 'then
take a lukewarm shower to git the dirt
off, graduating It to cold. Finally, rub
alcohol and water, half and half, on the
chest and back to prevent catching cold.
Hoys ran h<-lp each other' out in this rub
bing, as usually two or more of them are
taking their showers at the same place.
A cold batb in the morning Is very fine.
Leave the water as cold as It corned
from the pipe, fill the tub. rub down with
a rough towel, jump In and then out at
one* and dry the body with a rough towel.
Dun't expose yourself to colda. Great
care must be taken both on the field and
while in the bath or the rubbing room.
I.'ixk out for drafti.
Don't stand around unclothed after the
bath until you are chilled.
During practice don't lie down to rest In
your damp clothes.
This l.< very Important.

In a practice or game the boys should not
be allowed to fling themselves down on
lhÂ« ground. These Indiscretions lead to
cold* and pneumonia and sometime* to
P'-rmamuit lung trouble and early death.
A strong, hucky boy Is likely to* look
with Indifference upon advice of this sort,
but he 1m an likely to be a victim ns any
one. Both In athletics and In soldiering
it it a matter of statistics that the big
fellows are the ones that succumb to

â¢'Training season"â that Is bad. My
f.rst "don't" Ehall be: Don't expect to
r*coire an athlete in one short training
f-a-'an. Go into It as part of your educa
tion, and be content with gradual results.
Take care of yourself all the year. In
vacation don't loll in a hammock and
Hack* cigarettes. Do a little hard work
cr climb a mountain, or row a boatâany
thing to broaden your shoulders, set your
muscles and give you endurance. You'll
tlnd more pleasure In It than In growing
fiabjjy from laziness.
Now then for training season prohibi
tions:
There must be no smoking nor drinking.
EZQjoking is the most dangerous thing that
any athlete In training can do. It cuts
Tola wind, and no man who smokes can
(T*t In proper condition. This means all
use of tobacco â chewing as well as srook
ing. Cigarette* are worse than cigars,
became the smoke Is usually "inhaled." I
\u25a0would rather a football player should
smoke fire good cigars than one misera
ble llttie cigarette. But cut the cigars
out. too.
All drinking of alcoholic beverages u
tabooed. The high school boy is not train
ing hard enough to require an occasional
etimuiar.t in the form of alÂ«Â«, sometime*
given to college players. Its use by the
echool boy Is never necessary and Is gen
erally an abuse.
Don't *.at pastry, cak^s, candies,
tweets, strong spices or sauces or salads
with vinegar or mayonnaise dressing.
These thing* give a tendency to indiges
tion. They "sour the stomach" and run
down the system. The stomach is weak

The lynx kitten j la a lesson in natural
history to -most^people, ,for it is eiafo to
sajf that : verylfow of us know what | a
lynx kitten looks like. It Is softly hunched
their eyes. He learned i their moods, too,
and those moods are many. Then, with
all the phases of them indelibly impressed
upon his mind, he went back to his work
shop and proceeded to make mountain
lions.
He has a menagerie of them now In his
studio. There are angry ones and calm
ones, but In every one can be felt tha sav
ago power lurking behind even a sleeping
exterior. There is a hidden alertness un- '
d>r the calm. There is quite as much to
fear In the one lying romfortably on the
ground, apparently ready to settle down
for a hap, as in the fiercely growling one
with teeth displayed.
The coyotes are acquaintances of his,
too. He hns seen them skulk away and
he has reproduced that skulk. \u25a0 There Is
a little fellow sneaking off with his tail
between his legs In typical wolf fashion.
The backward glance, the nervous hurry
of the whole ng-urÂ», show a close knowl
edge of the ways of this animal that is as
cunning as the fox, as cowardly, as only
himself. Tho leanness of him 1 shows the

Jound a new friend-
He is Arthur Putnam, a young
sculptor, who has been studying
tbe wild cr.'.n.a'.b of California,

He hsÂ« set up a studio here in the mWn

coyote* and bears Jn clay and bronze peer
at you from c?v*Â»ry shelf. Mr. Putnam
made his headquarters on a ranch near
San TtU-s.it while he was setting: acquaint
ed with the originals of thesÂ« figures.
From the ranch he made frequent excur
sions I, ark into the mountains. He camped
and hunted, and above all he watched.
He watched tho mountain lions tvtry
one of the rare* times that he could set a
' elrht of one. He studied their poses,
Fi-a^ful and powerful and catlike. JIo
learned how strong their great paws aro,
bow splendid their muscles, how piercing
up r catlike; its' body is soft and plump,
for It has not grown' lean' with the' re
sponsibility of foraging for itself, and its
tall is "'wind and short and curled; * .
1 â¢ Putnam'V love lor horses^ shows In his
studies of bronchos. He lived long enough
on tho southern ranch ' to become pretty
thoroughly acquainted with them, \ and
with the men who rifle them as well. He
has. made studies of thenVIn colors, but
the art 'of tho sculptor Is the one he al
ways returns to as % his favorite means of
execution. A lively colt in' clay, a young
broncho, snows great action, its head
tossing and a wild scamper, evidently in
prospect." ,j
Another broncho, with a cowboy on his
back, is loafing during a lazy Interval in
the ' cow-punching profession.' In fact,
both of them are loafingâ the cowboy*
with his leg thrown over the pommel of
the raddle, and the horse brushing files
from bis forelegs, with head down. The
whole is the picture of a warm, lasy aft
ernoon. ; ;\u25a0':\u25a0â¢ .'.\u25a0 . ' ,
Arthur Putnam has not always been at
work : with" clav. He could not afford to
give" up his time to modeling until two
years' ago. Bet had his own way to make,
and art in its early phases is not a bread
and butter Disposition, "so he tried , a' lit
tle of everything that was "prosaic and
.money-making" and* uninteresting. . Now
he has set himself up In a San Francisco
studio, and he is making up with a will
for all the lost' time of those years when
be was not-boiling.

"There's a good deal about people that is

And a good deal of the human In beasts.
judging from the character studies he has
to show. The cowardice of the coyote, s
the cruelty of the lion, the playfulness
a^nd mother-love of the bearâ they are all
human enough.
Putnam Is trylns.his hand at other an!-,.*.

CONSTANTINOPLE. Oct. 13.â Neither
W. V. r . Peet, treasurer of the American
Bible House, nor Spencer Eddy, secretary
of the United States legation, had re
ceived any news up to noon to-day from
the missionaries who are searching for
the brigands who kidnaped Ml?s Ellen M.
Stone and her <xmpan!on, Madame Tsilka.
Peet and Eddy had a long conference
to-day as to the advisability of reinforc
ing the searchers, but decided that the
present arrangements sufficed.
Consul General Dickinson remains at
Sofia and will operate from there until
the liberation of Mies Stone is accom
plished.
The difficult nature of the country
handicaps the searchers, and heavy rains
ha\-e increased the difficulty in tra\-Â«rÂ«!ng
the paths which are th* only moans of
a^ccus to the hiding places of the; bandits
In the rugged mountain range.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. IS.âCharle
magne Tower, United States Embassador
to Russia, has returned here from Berlin
and is continuing- his exertions In behalf
of Miss Stone. The Russian Foreign Of
ncs Is showing sympathy and will assist
Tower. He has seen Dr. Standoff, the
Bulgarian representative here. and
through him has informed the Bulgarian
Government of the Interest taken in the
case in the United States. Tower learned
through Dr. Standoff that the Bulgarians
have cleared the frontier region where
the brigands are supposed to be hiding of
Â«he entire population, in order to sur
round the brigands more effecti\-ely.
According to the latest reports received
\u25a0t the embassy the brigands are Inclined
*o surrender to Bulgaria, and it is still
hoped, in view of Consul General Dickin
son's negotiations, that the life of Mis?
Stone will be saved.
No News From Abductors.
Russia Showing Sympathy.
Tie authorities have been considerably
astonished by the nrmness displayed by
the brigands in the negotiations. Ordin
arily a. demand for ransom Is made with
the expectation that a smaller sum will
be offered, which will be acceptable. The
declination of the brigands who kidnaped
Miss Stor.e to consider a smaller ransom
then that originally demanded is an'In-"'
dicatior. of the strength of thelr'bellef
that they will not be attacked, at least
\u25a0while they have Miss Stone in their pos
session, and it has led to the suspicion
that they have a?er.ts who are keeping
them well informed, as wt'.l as to the sug
gestion that one of the governments con
cerned is sympathetically interested in
their adventure.

IV., WASHINGTON. Oct. IS.-The refusal
of the brigands who abducted Miss Stone
to accept a smaller ransom than they
original!y fixed has led the administration
to suspect that they have a representative
in New York who Is advising them by ca

demanded. Confident, as a result of the
representations of the United States, that
they will not be attacked by either the
Turkish cr Bulgarian troops, the brigands
can quietly wait until the ransom has
been cc'.!ected and is in the hands of Mr.
Eddy, secretary of the American legation

The San Francisco Call.LOWELL. Mass.. Oct. 19.â The Mer
chants' National -Bank opened and closed
its doors at the usual hours to-day and
nothing out of the ordinary occurred to
interfere with its business despite the aur-
S rising absence of the teller: Albert C
mlth.. and the bookkeeper. Louis K.
Swift. A slight depression in business
was noticed and Inquiries respecting bal
ances were more numerous, but tho
"run." for which the directors had been
prepared, did not materialize. The bank
had money enough to square accounts
with all depositors.
The most interesting development of
the day was the engagement of counsel to
represent the interests of the missing
men. This information leads to the con
clusion that terms In the direction of a
settlement are soon to be submitted to
the directors. - - . .
The only Information of the probable
loss was given this morning by one of the
directors. Charles J. LJller, who. when,
asked as to whether or not the report that
the loss was $90,000 was likely to be an
exaggeration, replied that he believed it
would turn out to be an exaggeration,
To-night the loss Is thought to be even
greater than that amount, however the
continued allÂ«nce of the directors being
construed as an unfavorable indication.
The whereabouts of Smith and Swift
may be known to their wives, their law
yers and the directors of the bank,- but
all efforts upon the part of others to trace
them have proved unavailing. The cities
of Boston and Montreal are the places
most mentioned in this connection, but
nothing of a definite character has been
found. The houses of the . two men In
Lowell are under constant surveillance by
the police. At a meeting of the bank di
rectors to-night the affair was fully dis
cussed, but at the doee of the meeting
the directors were unwilling to make any
statement.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 19.â The report of
the Merchants' National Bank of Lowell
\u25a0Mass.. made September SO, shows that at
that time the bank declared its condition
In part as follows: Surplus 1200.000. undi
vided profits $104,106. loans and discounts 1
S1.S11.S37. Individual deposits S658.7R0. From
this statement it appears that the bank
could lose $300,000 without impairing it3
capital of $400,000. - * . - "

the best automobile ever offered to the

vehicles in the run â one in Cla^s A and
three in Class B. These machines made a
better combined record than that of any
other make of either steam or gasoline
vehicles. At many of tbe controls tfcÂ«
"White" wagons would follow Bishop'*
powerful 40 H. P. Panhard la one, two.

performance of the machines was the talk
of the run.
"The flash steam' generator used in this
vehicle has shown Itself to be highly effi
cient and trustworthy. Not a single mis
hap of any' kind happened to the genera
tor or engine on any of these carnages
The good work of the "White' carriage
was especially noticeable. During tne
rainy days, when the roads were la the
worst condition, they used less than a
gallon of water per mile. Every one of
the four made the complete Journey
through to Buffalo, and could have turned
around and made the trip back again to
New York over the same schedule."

In 1900. when I found the conitltlor.s In na
tional affair* much the same. I fran>d the ef
fect snÂ«l result of .hrtns; overconftdeat. The
duty you owe to your families as well an to
the State should be a command to <1 â¢ every
thing. My farmer frtenda. trave the corn un

that work tn the ahops nnd nn the rnarinide.
I pay your time cannot be t>-'ter n.Â«nt fcr
your own lntrrÂ»Â»ts than to aivÂ« the neceiuuiry
time to the poIU and cast your vote* for "Let
well enourh a!on#."
What do we w.ir.t with men to represent
us at the capltnl at Washington? Proper
qualiacatlonx. Has the State of Ohio ever
had an abler, more efficient Senator than Kor
aker? I Â»ay no, -with you: and I have a
tight to nay It. because I know htm. We. ara
all agreed nn that proposition.
U Ohio goes as she aught to go. 10A.M*) plur
ality for Governor Nash, you will be creating
a rendition of things In th* public mind among
financial circles, among the great commercial
and Industrial Interents. that will add strength
to the foundation* of our prosperity which will
make It lasting, not one year, nor two years,
but fifty years.
I say. without fear of contradiction, that
on all the great economic questions of to-day
the. Republican party Is right and has proved
Itself light. Every promise mode at the St.
Louis convention has been kept and prophecy
has been fulfilled to the letter.

offer Itself than Robert again -took a
horse and buggy from a barn and tried to

only to cover a period of twelvemonths

The rate of Insurance Is 10 guineas for

high, but then It Is remembered that

In these Insuranvcs It Is age of person

The premium for the Insurance of the late
Queen Victoria, at the time of, the dia

No Insurance has ever been taken at
Lloyds on the lives of the Czar or Kaiser,

doctors, and who
were perfectly and

by the use of Dr.

Medical Discovery.
Nothing is more

Since it appears, that the Turkish authorities object to the bandits who abducted Miss Stone
receiving the ransom money on Turkish soil because that would make Turkey responsible for
the crime, and the Bulgarians on similar grounds object to the ransom" being paid on Bul

BRITISH correspondents who witnessed the military maneuvers with which the French
entertained the Czar on his recent visit, and also the annual maneuvers of the Ger
man army, report that the military authorities of neither nation appear to have learned
anything from the lessons taught by the experience of the British in the Transvaal. It
is said that both the French and the Germans continue to make attacks on fortified positions in
close formation, and send their artillery' so near to the enemy's line that the, gunners could be shot
down by sharpshooters as fast as they could take their places at the guns.
It is, of course, probable that some allowance must be made for the fact that the German
and the French generals conducted the maneuvers largely" for the purpose of spectacular effect.
Such was certainly the case in the sham battle prepared for the Czar. If those same generals were
charged with the responsibility of ordering. an attack in real war it is not likely they would mass
their troops as they did in the maneuvers. Still the incidents serve to show how difficult it is for
disciplined men to learn new tricks. The armies of Germany and France have been taught and
trained to rely upon certain tactics, and it would seem they are not going to find it easy to adopt
the new style of fighting which the Boers have forced upon the British.
The London Mail in commenting upon the exhibition made at the maneuvers savs: "No
doubt France and Germany have millions of men to sacrifice, and can throw away thousands where
we should shrink from losing hundreds. But what sort of effect will Magersfonteins on a stupend
ous scale have upon the shuddering rank and file? -When the bullets come in literal streaks of
hissing lead, what power of man can win through them? The Highlanders were superb
troops, bravely led, confessed by even the Boers to be the bravest of the brave. Yet they re
coiled. Will the short-service levies of , Europe be steadier when they see whole companies fall
ing in swaths before the scythe of death?"
The subject is an interesting one. It has been the theory that' fortified positions could
not be taken by widely scattered attack; that something in the way of a mighty mass is neces
sary to carry entrenched lines. The military authorities of the Continent 'evidently continue
to hold to that theory, and nothing but the experience of real war will convince them of the folly
of such attacks under the present, conditions. The lesson, therefore, for which Great Britain is
paying so great a price may be of no value to any but herself.

THE debut of a young girl on the
operatic stage Is always a more or
less painful and nervous affair.
That of Miss Barnetta Mueller,
who made her first appearance at the
Tlvoll on Wednesday night last as Kedda
In "I Pagllaccl," was no exception to the
rule. The singer Is n graceful and pretty
girl, modest and unassuming. Her voice,
though light. Is sweet and pleasing, but
If she were to be Judged by her work on
Wednesday evening It would militate
against her. That, however, cannot fair
ly be done, for Miss Mueller was in a
state of nervous collapse that all but pre
vented her from singing her part and al
most wholly disguised whatever powers
she may be possessed of. The part of
Netlda, with Its strong dramatic impulse,
seems to me hardly to have been well
cbceen for Miss Mueller's debut, either
from a vocal or dramatic standpoint. Her
voice Is of the lyric order to begin with.
She was completely overweighted vocally,
losing much in her Inexperience by sins
ing Into the wings. She looks the part
quite prettily and Is tactful In gesture
and movement, but her debut in such a
role at the present stage of her attain
mentâas it could be surmised the other
evening-seems Ill-advised and aan be pro
ductive of nothing but discouragement for
the singer.'
'The Tlvoll is to the fore with a good
deal of news this week,, what with the
story of Its new hqme of the future, which
l:Â« still very much In the air. and operatic
r,Â«ws generally. This week - Is I the last
but one of the year's grand opera season
and will be signalized by an elaborate
production of "La Boheme," given. here
for the first time by the Tlvoli people.
There will be settings and. costumes mod
eled after those of the La'Scala produc
tion in Milan -and the best cast the Tlvoll
can give to the opera, including Agostlnt
as Rudolph; Montanarl as Mlml and Dado
as Colllne. The alternate bill will be
"Norma," In which, Barbareschl and Pol
lettlni are so well heard, and Signor Ave
dsno will also make his -first appearance
of the season this- week. On the 28 th a
testimonial performance to Mr. Stelndorff,
who has done such excellent work with the
operas, will be given and will doubtless
call out a large crowd. The last week
will see a revival of "Carmen," and then
it Is to take leave for a year of these
good people who have served our pleasure
and profit so faithfully for twelve lone
weeks. Some of them we shall not see
again, but all will be remembered grate
fully as worthy artists and as partners in
the best season the Tlvoll has so far given
us. ' .The company will go down south, un

Under the title of "Unfair Tactics
Against Mrs. Flske" the Chicago Tribune
of October 8 has the following significant
paragraph:
It is apparent that *vÂ«Â»ry effort In being made
by the New York foÂ»Â» of Mm. Flake to In
jure her. A few day* ago trlearaphlc dis
patches were rent over tbÂ«? country from New
York saying that "Mm. Fl*k* would make no
fight against the unanimous %'erdlct of failure."
but would withdraw "Miranda of the Balcony"
at once.
The verdict In the first place was not one
of failure except In thÂ» cases of one or two'
envenomed reviewers, and In thÂ» second place
emphatic denial of any Intention of withdraw
ing the play Â«aÂ« made lnriantly by Harrison
Grey Fl*ke. who declared that the piece waa
doing a Â«Â»tlf factory bunlnes* and wr.uM run
for weeks, to come. Before Mm. Flike'a Â»Â»aaon
opened nhe announced that she would present
at leant two play* bÂ»fore she left New York,
and It la evident that some hint of the Identity
of the aÂ»eon<1 play was the excuse which a#rvej
for the purposely misleading statement given
to th* cubllc by the unfair opponents of the
actress.
This la the wamlag which cornea privately
i from a reliable and unprejudiced source In
New York: ;
"Don't believe what you hear of Mrs. Flske's
failure. They are trying to down her. It's
the most artlftlc play of the f - 9f0 n. though It
probably will not be a great money-maker.

Signor Creatore, director of the Royal
Italian band. Is a new thing In conductors
here. Our own Sousa has hitherto held
first place in point of plcturesqueness in
the affections of band lovers, but a
greater than he has arisen and the Amer
ican conductor must now take a back
seat. Creatore has it In hair to begin
with, and the wise well know the power

where , the rest of him will be. It will,
however, be found where it will be o*

dramatic of conductors, la not In the

has done excellent work with the. band In
the one short year of his leadership. Nat
urally It has not yet attained quite the
marvelous precision of Sousa' a organiza
tion. Its magic certainty of rhythm, its
wonderful swing and balance, but it comes
so near that It may prove in the not dis
tant.future a formidable rival to the older
band.
The peculiar composition of the Royal
Italian band, .with Its large wood wind
force; enables it to get effects that are
not possible to the ordinary brass band,
and in their repertoire this fact has been
taken fullest advantage of. Whole acts
of the standard operas are given with con
siderable beauty of effect for the most
part, and such arrangements as the
â¢Tannhauser" overture are brilliantly
successful, the wood wind telling' with
splendid effect. Creatore has done much
of the arranging and his work shows
strong musical feeling and an ingenuity
and originality that amount to true
genius. There Is sometimes * slight ten
dency* to the unduly sentimental in his
Interpretation, an occasional crudity to be
observed, but on the whole bia methods
" are thoroughly healthful, -brilliantly en
thusiastic and highly conscientious. The
fifty musicians in Creatore's band are all
picked men. and it is easy to prophesy
for such man and such a leader a lasting
and worthy success. To-night will be

Grace Dudley â not seldom, for I an
of the devoutâ the consciousness of
her likeness to some forgotten
charmer has possessed me to my
considerable distraction. This week the
subliminal xnJndâ that Mrs. Piper tells
elsewhere in these columns all she does
not know aboutâ has supplied the defi
ciency, and the dainty little lady is placed
where she belongs.' There Is a Grimm
Jairy story, as every one knows, about a
good little girl who was rewarded for her
many virtues by having her vocabulary
coined into gold pieces as it fell from her
rosy lips, while for her sins her wicked
etep-sister talked toads whenever she had
a mind to open her mouth. Naturally,
Miss Dudley does not remind one of the
latter small eicner. nor entirely of the
girl, but her clipped, hard, in
cisive enunciation does pussest that If her
words took tangible shape she would soon
be up to her knees Inâ say diamonds.
Certainly every word Miss Dudley sings
or speaks can be heard by every one in
the house. Ud fortunately, her voice Is
bad. badly produced that Is, and she
easps 'or breath in a painful fashion, but
by her clear enunciation. Quick wit and
lively Intelligence Miss Dudley makes her
work amply acceptable to her audiences.
60 grateful are they for Bimply hearing j
what is said or sung effectively, without
any reference to the beauty of the voice.

the little, minister, would be heard, and
pleasantly, for his voice is a very good
one and he ie. luckily, not expected to
Scottlsise bis lines. Miss Hall, the wln-

voice, sympathetic, clear and penetrating,
but she frequently speaks too fast and
then becomes unintelligible. I happened
to hear her again In th*s name thing at i

company lacks sadly on this side. I am
persuaded that my blind man, without
eyes to help out the sense, got very little

It is therefore in the interest of the whole community that' we have warned the city that the
man who is elected Mayor must represent the whole community, and. not a fraction of it. The
future of San Francisco is so involved in the result that labor, which expects to rise in independ
ence in that future cannot afford to spoil its opportunity, and business that looks forward to
permanent prosperity has exactly the same interest.
We are aware that the helpful hope that inspires all American affairs can accomplish much
under a handicap of political and governmental conditions, but how much greater its achieve
ments when not handicapped at all!
We want San Francisco to be in the race for primacy without handicap upon her back or
hurdle in her way. The present duty is to secure an executive head of the city who will justly
consider and protect all rights, and not stand for a class against the whole community. .To this
end we have advised that citizens pool their votes for the head of one of the regular tickets, and
as a result of that advice the disposition, to do so has deepened into a conviction that it offers the
only means of preserving the city from confusion, loss and distress.
Unmindful of his duty 10 the whole city, the head of the so-called Republican ticket has per
sistently put himself in a position that is repulsive to the independent voter. He has forgotten that
the great principles of the party are not inMssuc in a municipal election. When 'those princi
ples are involved in a general election the city votes one way. and when only local administration
is at stake it votes independently and without regard to party names. It will so vote at the
coming election and it is our present conviction, reached after a careful study of public sentiment
and of the public needs, that it will not cast its majority, nor its. plurality, for the head of the so
called Republican ticket. For this he and his convention are to blame; the fault is at their door,
not ours. ...
In the present condition*.- the election of the head of the Democratic ticket appears to the
greatest number of independent men as a necessity, required by the public interests. This," not
because of his party affiliations, but because circumstances have caused him to become the best
assurance and safeguard of public order and progress. He has seemed to clearly realize this
himself, and has risen out of mere partisanship into the higher air of the public welfare.
As far as Republican party interests are concerned, they have already been sacrificed. The
party was laid on the operating table by the convention that bore its name, and was made the
subject of vivisection, and its morals and its brains were taken oift and thrown into the slop
bucket. When its consciousness was restored it was a walking cadaver with the name "Re
publican" pasted on a forehead behind which was an empty skull. Men who are Republicans on
principle were repulsed by the exhibition, and have no other desire than to prove that their alle
giance does not belong to this effigy.
Had another course been pursued 'and a ticket nominated that commanded the respect of the
people, party allegiance would have sat as lightly upon intelligent Democrats, and they would
have sought the city's safety and prosperity through independent action at the polls.
Republicans arc now convinced that the party will suffer less by the defeat than by the
victory of the so-called Republican ticket, as far as regards its head and its candidates for Super
visors, and the whole city will vote so discriminatingly as" to teach* the traders in artifice and
chicane that the day is gone by when unfit men can hope to be carried into office upon the
shoulders of a few good and proper candidates. The latter class will feel themselves relieved of
serving as beasts of burden to carry such an offensive load, and the people will purify city politics
of the future in proportion as they 'pick a successful ticket from all the nominations regardless
of the party name.
No such crisis has been presented in recent years and we have confidence that its impressive
importance will be felt by all voters, and* that a majority of them will vindicate the honor of San
Francisco. " 1
Â» . \u25a0 ' .-.\u25a0-\u25a0*.\u25a0
WE have sufficiently warned the people of this city of the danger that lies in the
of a class ticket. That danger threatens aÂ«l, and not one portion.of our people
pnly. The mistaken men who enlarge the benefit to them of such a result will suffer
the first and the longest. The social state is like water through which a solid body can
be moved gently with little resistance. But slap it flat upon the surface and it ' is unyielding as
brass. The class aspiration is the slap direct, and the instrument used will suffer/from the
impact. .'<â¢. "'â¢Â».-' - " '" \ -

The work of rescue was quickly accom
plished. McNeil and Owens were picked
up by nnn beat and Frost and Johnson by
'he other. The men, dr^nrhed and aj
most suffocBtod. were drngged on' deck.
Thty were toKtn to Bansallto.
Yesterday afternoon Captain McNeil,
who owns the launch. left tbls city to
take a party from Sausalito to Tiburon.
Accompanying the captain was Andy
Frost, an employe. About 9 o'clock Sam
Owens and Charles Johnson were taken
aboard at Sausullto and the four started
In the direction of Tiburon. A heavy fog
hung over the bay when the start was
made. As the vessel progressed on Its
way the mist became so dense tlm ob
jects could be seen but a few feet uhead.
The captain depended solely on his com
pass, lie mad? his way cautiously and
no incident occurred until the boat had
been out about twenty minutes. The puf
fing of the gasoline engine prevented
those aboard ,'ium hearing the approach
of the ferry-boat. "Without warning a
faint light loomed up In the fog. It trav
eled swiftly, nnd soon the Indistinct form
of the Sausalito came Into view. The
launch was then but a few boat lengths
away from the big vessel's course.
Captain McNeil saw that a collision
could not be prevented. lie immcdlately
reversed his engines and threw his wheel
to the left. Frost. Owens and Johnson
were In the cabin of the launch and knew
nothing of the danger until they were
warned by the shouting of the captain.
The trio had Just time to scramble to
the deck when the crash came. The ferry
boat struck the launch near the bow and
overturned her in an instant. McNeil,
his helper and the two passengers were
tossed into the water, tut fortunately
were not injured.
The captain of the Sausalito saw tho
launch only a moment before the bow of
his vessel struck her. He immediately
stopped and sounded the alarm for "man
overboard." Two boats were lowered
quickly. The ferry-boat had advanced
some distance before Its boats could be
ret in the water and the llfesavers, find
ing themselves enveloped in fog. were
guided only by the cries of the men In
the water.
While steamlur along In a heavy fog
the ferry-boat Sausalito ran into and cap
sized a launch containing four people near
Angol Island List nisht. The launch Is
supposed to have been sunk. Its passen
gers *erc rescued afttr several minutes
of hard work ou the part of the ferry
boat's crew.
Last Thursday You received an anony
mous letter, containing the information
that his ltfe had been declared forfeited
for betraying the slave *lrl to the Federal
officers and apprising him that his store
\u25a0would be blown up at midnight Friday.
Thinking that the letter was a Joke, the
Chinaman tore it up and allowed the mat
ter to pass from his memory.
True to their threat, three highbinders
a few minutes before 12 o'clock Friday
night placed a can of giant powder, to
which was attached a fuse, against the
sidÂ«- of the store and then applied a match
to it. In an Instant there was a loud ex
plosion, followed by the screams of the
rr .en who were In the store at the time.
You was In the roar of the place, drink
ing a cup of tea. With a cry of terror he
ran screaming from the place. He is sat
isfied that the men who sent him the
threatening letter were paid to do the Job.
Detective Ed Gibson, after a thorough
Investigation, is satisfied that the attempt
to blow up the merchandise store of
Wong Tou on Dupont street Friday night
*-as the work of highbinders who had
beer, hired to put him out of the way. A
short time ago You. who is considered a
power in the Chinese quarter, incurred
the enmity of several slave owners by In
forming the Federal authorities* of the
whereabouts of a girl who was being hell
in bondage by her owner. Acting on his
information, the. authorities traced the
Kirl to Sacramento, where she was ar
refted and subsequently brought to this
city. After a short trial she was ordered

The natives for a time in their efforts
to parry suspicion spread the report that
the American had been the victim of a
cannibal feast, but there was no evidence
to support this rumor.
Wright at one time resided In the vicini
ty of Chicago. He appeared before the
United tSates Consul at Papeete. Tahiti,
in December, 1900, and declared under
oath that he was a citizen of the United
States. He requested a statement of his
declaration signed by the Vice Consul in
the absence of the Consul. He claimed
that the certificate of citizenship would
be of great value to him in dealing with
the French authorities In the Marquesas
Inlands.
The story which at present is being cir
culated among the natives is that Wright
was waylaid. The assault was carefully
planned and one of the natives, according
to the agreement, asked Wright for some
tobacco. While he was attempting to
draw it from his pocket he was struck on
the head with a heavy war club. After
he had been murdered his body was
weighted with stones and cast into the
sea.
Details of the Murder.
In securing the Chinese, the Consul did
not rest in his efforts. It Is not believed
that one man could have done the deed
alone, and it is supposed that the Chinese
had the assistance of several, and it is
even conjectured that a preconcerted plot
for the assassination of Wright was
hatched by the natives. As to the assist
ants of the Chinese, suspicion points
strongly to a chief and his two sons. It
appears that Wright once purloined a pig
to which the chief laid claim.
The report was started that Wright be
fore he started on his journey was Intox
icated. His road lay along a steep cliff,
and an attempt was made to arouse the
belief that he had fallen over the cliff
to his death. The United States Consul
refused to give credence to the story and
undertook an Investigation, which has
thus far furnished almost Incontrovert
ible evidence that the American was mur
dered. A Chinese who was a rival trader
ol Wright was found bearing suspicious
cuts and bruises and bloodstains upon his
blouse. The Chinese resided in the valley
through which Wright's pathway leu.
He has been arrested and taken to Pa
peete, where under an examination he
told various conflicting stories. His ex
planations of the stains tended to fasten
the suspicion of thu murder upon himself.
Did Not Fall Oft Cliff.
W. F. Doty, brother of^ tha United
States Consul In the Society Islands,
who arrived from the South Sea yester
day, tells a story' which seems to Indi
cate than an American named Wright has
been murdered by the natives on one of
the Marquesas Islands. An Investigation
has beenNinstituted by the United atates
Consul in conjunction with the French
Governor, Monsieur Petit. The evidence
thus far obtained Btrongly supports the
suspicion that Wright haa met with foul
play.
Wright was a trader In the Marquesas
Islanus. He had been there since De
cember, 19oo. He represented In his trad
ing 'ventures an American merchant
named Varney, who has his- headquar
ters at Attuwand on the Island of Hlvoa.
On the night on which the murder Is sup
pojed to nave been perpetrated Wrlgnt
started from one of the back valleys for
Attuwand. He carried with him a consid
erable sum of money, which unfortunately
he displayed to the natives. Wright
never reached his destination. Since tnat
night he has not been seen. His horse,
bridled and saddled, was subsequently
found grazing In the valley of Tehuco, a
considerable distance from Attuwand.
. J. Brass<\ the aged Italian murderer
who escaped from Watsonville last
Thursday, has been located in this city.
l,ast night he was seen in the Latin
quarter, looking for a friend. He was
recognized by an old acquaintance, who
lost no time in notifying the police. Sev
eral detectives were immediately sent to
arrest him, but after a lengthy search
they returned empty handed, Brasso hav
ing been warned. .Another effort will be
made to-day to arrest the much wanted
murderer.
Hrasso is wanted In Modesto for the
wanton killing of a fellow countryman.
After commuting the crime he went to
Watsonville. where he was arrested. At
the request of several frlonds he was not
locked up in prison but allowed to occupy
a room In a notrl. Two officers were de
tailed to watch him, but in some manner,
pretumably through the carelessness of
nls guards, he managed to escape by
dunning through an open window.
Ah Boon as his escape was (Uncovered a
search was made for him, but without
avail. Suspect Ing that Brusso would at
tempt to reach this city word vu sent
to Chief of Police Sullivan to be on the
lookout for him. Despite the fact that

watched, Brnsna managed to elude the

vealed a side of the Chinese character
which has hitherto not been touched upon
to any great extent by American speak

pieces of the ancient Chinese masters.
The Illustrations showed the Intense love
for wild scenery and wild nature which
once animated the now seemingly stoical
Chinese. The speaker pointed out how
the Chinese artists had .Interwoven into
their work representations of the forces
of nature.

nedy filed suit to-day In the County
Olerk's office to recover S2.00o.000 from
Walter Everett. The complaint alleges
that two years ago he and Everett en
tered into a bargain by which all rail
road, banking and other concessions ob
tained by them from the Mexican Gov
ernment should be divided half and half.
This agreement was reached by virtue of
the plaintiff's infruenct- with J. M. Ncel
and a wealthy capitalist of Nebraska,
who were to aid them in their enter
prises. Now Kennedy charges Everett
with having secretly organized corpora
tions In Chicago and Mexico and started
a railroad and a bank In the State of
Chiapas, as well an having secured a num.
her of other valuable concessions. He
asks the court to compel Everett to ex
hibit all such concessions and all Inven
tories of property in hla possession ob
tained by Mexican franchises.

"I was a charter member of the first

While Mr. Llenlns Is entitled to th-Â»
credit of having been "elected a delegate
to help form the first Grand Lodge." tha
iact that he "was on a prospecting tour

structed Minister Conger to obtain from
China a new grant, which will definitely
fix the boundaries of the concession.
The United States will be the last of the
great nations to acquire a concession at
Tientsin. During: the preliminary peace
negotiations at Peking. Russia seized
territory at Tientsin, and her claim to it
was recognized by Li Hung Chang as
Viceroy of Tientsin. At the same time
France and Japan extended the limits of
their concessions, and Austria and Bel

will attempt to oppose the request of the

NO ARGUMENT HEEDED.
Erery Eufferer from Catarrh Knows that
Salves, Lotions. Washes, 'prays and
Doaches Do Not Cure.
Powders, lotions, salves, sprays and In-
halcru cannot really cure Catarrh, because
this disease is a blood disease, and local
applications, if they accomplish anything
at all. simply give transient relief.
Tha catarrnal poison Is in the blood and
the mucous membrane of the nose, threat
and trachea tries to relieve the system by
secreting; large quantities of mucus, the
discharge sometimes closing: up the nos-
trils,- dropping into the throat, causing
deafness by closing: the Eustachlan tubes,
and after a time causing catarrh of stom-
ach or serious throat and lung troubles.
A remedy to really cure catarrh must be
an Internal remedy. which will cleanse the
blood from catarrhal poison and remove
the fever and congestion from the mucous
membrane. k / , . > â¢
The best and most modern remedies for
this purposÂ« are antiseptics scientifically
known as Eucalyptol, . Gualacol, San -
gulnaria and Hydrustln, and while each
of these has been successfully used sep-
arately, yet it has *been difficult to set
them all combined In one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form. -
The manufacturers of the new catarrh
cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have suc-
ceeded admirably in accomplishing; this
result. They are large", pleasant tasting
lozenges, to be dissolved in the mouth
thus reaching every part of the mucous
membrane of the throat and finally the
stomach. \u25a0 - . .
Unlike many catarrh remedies, Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate
or any lnJurJous i drug whatever arid are
equally beneficial for little children and
adults. . Â¥ .
Mr. C. IL Rembrandt of Rochester, N.
T., says: "I know of few people who have
suffered as much as I from Catarrh of
the head, throat and stomach. I used
sprays, Inhalers and powders for months
at a time with only slight relief, and had
no hope of cure. I had not the means to
make a change of climate, which seemed
my only chance of cure. '
â¢â¢Last BDTlnt I read an account of some
remarkable cures made by Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and promptly bought a
fifty-cent box from my druggist â¢ and ob-
tained such positive benefit from that one
package that I continued to use them
dally until I now consider myself entirely
free from the disgusting annoyance of ca-
tarrh; my head Is clear, my digestion all I
could ask and my hearing, which had be-
gun to. fall as a result of : the^catarrh, has
greatly Improved until I feel I can hear as
well as ever. They are a household neces-
sity in my family." . ?â¢ .
\u25a0 Stuart's.' Catarrh Tablets ' arc - sold by
druggists at 60 cents for complete treat-
ment, and for convenience, safety and
prompt' results they .'are undoubtedly the
long-looked-for. catarrh curei :-

Your stomach is sour, your skin yellow, your breach offensive, and you hate
yourself and all mankind* Winter or summer it's all the same, when you

"I think that with the United States

portance from a naval standpoint. The

I suppose that this step will be made In
the very near future."

rollowlng Is a list of tho members In
trusted \u25a0with the task of photographing
San Francisco:
Those Who Did the Work.
The Interiors of the llbruries and mu
seums will bo taken to-day, as well as a
number of pictures of the water front
from the bay. The Harbor Commissioners
have placed tho tire tug Governor Irwin
at the club's disposal, and at S o'clock this
morning n corps of photographers under
the supervision of President Krwln will
board her and spend the day making neg
atives of the whljiplrmof the port. -vt
: Another party ofcJub members went
through Chinatown last night and took
flashlight pictures of the most Interesting
Interiors.
When the work Is completed nearly
three thousand pictures' will have been
taken and developed. These pictures will
be publicly exhibited at a later date.
Meanwhile the photographs will be print
ed on stereopticon slides and will subse
quently be used to Illustrate a lecture on
San Francisco.
The foundries, the water front, the mar
kets, the ferry depot, the depot ut Fourth
and Townsend streets, all Â«the prlnclpnl
street car lines, the theaters, the park,
beach and football gume were all taken
yesterday by tho Camera Club emissaries.
Chinatown by Flashlight.
The fog did not interfere materially,
however, with securing good impressions,
and in most cases had the effect of im
proving the photographs from an artistic
standpoint and adding to them the merit
of local atmosphere.

AJXTOTTRIIIEENT TAKEN IN
NOME CONTEMPT CASES
THE Camera Club, equipped with a
battery of 15) well-loaded cameras
and reinforced by a detachment
of rays from the sun, yesterday
captured nearly every foot of San
Francisco scenery that lies out of doors.
The members took The Call building in
its rnomir.g majesty; they snapped the
â¢ US House seals before the rock dwellers
were thoroughly awake; they found Chi
aiown doing Us marketing, and caught
The fruit-stand merchant laying in his
Saturday stock of perishable merchan
dise. Nob Hill mansions were transferred
to the Caisera Club scenery collection
while their owners were still asleep, and a
Camera Club camera was doing sentry
duty when the workers of steÂ«?l poured
lr.to the Union Iron Works. They escort
ed the matinee girls to the doors of all
the Theaters.
The po?s*ssion of a complete photo
grapiflc record-cf San Francisco has for
â¢ !oni? time been one of the Camera Club's
â¢ herisfced ambitions. By sundown to-day
tbfs ambition will have be**n realized and
the- evidences of the achievement, record
ed on multitudinous five by six inch pieces
of paper, will be stacked, on the desk of
the club secretary.
Fog Makes No Difference.
The work of photographing everything
worth while in a city the size of San
Francisco Is a task neither to be entered
upon lightly nor to be executed success
fully without the most careful planning.
The Camera Club has be*>n arranging for
Its accomplishment of yesterday for many
weeks. The citv was mapped out into
districts. The cleverest photographers in
the club were selected tor the work and
\u2666o each was allotted his share. This task

will be completed this afternoon.

Decide to Have an Organizer.
At the mornUig session it was decided
to obtain necessary money to put an en
ergetic organizer In the field. The work
will be toward the securing of sufficient
revenue to renew the light for suffrage
made in 1S96. 1'ledges for $:00 per nit \u25a0 nth
to cover the expenses of the organization
were asked for.
A vol.; of thanks was. tendered Mrs.
Reuben Mastick and Xl'.ts Carrie YVhelan
for. their helpful work during the year.
Durlnfj the afternoon session Dr. Sarah
Elliot *pnkÂ»Â» of polygamy, ln the course
of her address she read a letter from
Senator Wmunds which urged the aboli
tion of polygamy. Mi*. Klllot had peti
tions to Â«-i iut to Congress for an amend
ment to the constitution abolishing po
lygamy, ln the corrse of her address she
Fuld:
The teachings of polygamy have brought
about surh degradation that a woman who Is
the clxth wife of a man feels no Â»hanu be
\u25a0\u25a0auÂ«e of her condition. Ttwy seem absolutely
indifferent to their condition.
' Mrs. Solomons was the next speaker.
In sarcastic phrasÂ«Â«- she ridiculed man's
attempt to keep woman from the Lallot.

Austin I-owIs was nc-xt on tho pro
gramme. He raid:
In regard to woman's suffrac? Grrat Britain
and the Tntted States axe mil ln the lead,
but the mom hÂ«rolc flfbt U In Germany. Why.
It Is hard to say. There In Junt a probability
that ihf woman's sufTrn** will be a dominant
Issue In all count rlrn. Never has there been
such an organizing aa amons women. The
people who do tho work get tha power and
tbe women are getting more power Into thetr
hands and making themselves a necessity In
organization.
There are no places where families are bet
ter cared for than In those where women are
on an equalltr with men. We had a great
strike In San Francisco. It Inflicted much
suffering and the 'non-combatants â the chil
dren â were forced to th* greatest misery.
These men will take five years to reach their
old positions.
Mrs. J. "W. Orr spoke on organization.
Organization had n value closely related
to suffrage. sh<? natd. and followed cut this
Idea to the en<l. .She suggested organisa
tion and combination ol women for their
ov.-rv protection, politically and economic
ally.
Albert Klllott took It upon himself to
pl*Klge President Roosevelt to the cause.

I never caw a prettier weddingâpret
tiest on account of its extreme simplicity
ami beautiful surroundings â than that of
! Miss Eleanor Briggs and Edward Put
nam, solemnized yesterday afternoon at
the picturesque little Swedenborgian
church out on Broderlck street, between
Jackson and Washington.
I do not believe I have ever Been a
prtttler, more artistic room than the one
that Is really the church proper. There
is a great fireplace in the rear; the eeU-
I ing- is low and beamed, and instead of
pews there are rows of most picturesque
cane bottomed colonial chairs.
The wedding service was perfectly
"dear." There was no music ana no bri
dal party. The happy couple walked side
by side down the center aisle to the plat
form, where the bride's father, the Rov.
Mr. BriBKs. met them and pronounced the
solemn words that made them one. There
was not a dry eye in the church when
i the father pronounced them huaband an<l
; wife and the groom took his bride in a
! fond, tender embrace and. calling her
I "wife," pressed a lingering kiss upon her

I never attested a more pleasant affair t J
than tbe tea plven yesterday aftÂ«lTioon
by Mae Colburn ln honor of pretty Polly ! j
Dcnr- Miss Colburn proved to be a most j :
<5eUpbtfnl hostess, and I tell you there i â¢
\u25a0were no dull moments at the Colburn j :
hoi^e betweea the hours of 4 and 7.
Sevoa girls helped Miss Colburn pour .
tea, and each one of the girl? was a I
beauty. They Trere Miss Bernle Bruce. :
Mrs. Henry E. Dutton, Miss Marie Voor
bies. Miss Elizabeth Cole. Miss Maud
Mulllns. Miss Jessie Fillmore and Miss
Tfce men showed up beautifully, and
really the amount of attention they re- ;
ceived ought to encourage all members
cf the ftemer eex to appear more Ire- |
<lÂ«eatlj- at afternoon functions. Dr. Col- ;
lins, the handsome young surgeon from
rhe Presidio, was the beau of the after
noon. If I would I could a tale unfold I
that would tell of fair maids stealing pre- ;
oious hours from their downy couches to .
cuddle together and discuss the doctor. ;
I saw some mighty pretty gowns at the
tea. I consider that Polly Dunn never
looked prettier than she did yesterday in
her light blue crape gown covered with
exquisite -white applique.
Mae Colburn looked etunning Jn a white
crepe de chine gown. Her duchesse lace
collar was worth a small fortune.
Marie Voorhies' gown, a most becoming- I
one, by the way. was a pale blue crepe
\u25a0with a* joke of applique.
Jessie Fitlniore looked very lovely In a
dainty gown of white point d'esprit.
Pearl Landers was perfectly charming
ln a pale blue cloth calling gown and a I
fetching blue hat. i
Mila Laily was a picture in her bright
red gown ar.d red hat-
Delia Mills' gown wag of silk, with a ,
Persian rffect, and was very chic and <
modish.
I thought Mirle "U'ells wa." a picture ln
her dark b'.ue, perfect fitting tailor euit I
*nd a stunning pale blue hat with a pale |
b'ue plume.
Mrs. George Carr's go,wn was a very ef- '
lecuve cne â a black spangled net with a '
dash of pink at the neck. Her hat, a ;
p!nk one vtbf a beauty.
Mrs Hcr.ry Dctton wore a mas:mn>ent
Imported sown of pale pink crepe, with a
yoke of lace-
I consider that Mrs. Linda Bryan was
*he most stunning woman at the tea. She
was a Glbfon picture ln her gown of old
bluet brocade, trimmed with velvet. Her
hat wmm till gray, a b!sr picture affair,
covered -with nodding plumes. A large
gray muff lent the finishing touch to her
attlrt.

TACOMA'S GUEST
A gentleman said to me to-day: "After all
there Is no Issue In tbls campaign," and I
ugree with him. There iÂ« no issue in the or
dinary political sense. There Ik no Usue such
as that which confronted uÂ» In "the last Presi
dential campaign, and In every Presidential
campaign that has preceded it. There Is no
issue. 1 swy. In the ordinary sense, but there
lb an lamie In a spe<51Be. distinct sense at this
time. There lÂ» an Issue, and what is the
issue? As 1 have (aid before, on every night
that It has been my good fortune to address
the gentlemen whom 1 meet In these meet
ing*. I re|KuU it. tti.-ro is tin iÂ£eue. and that
tts-ue Is the fajne old itsue of common hun
esty. It Is the Imuj<> of a government, decent
and honest, conceived and executed solely for
the benefit of the people. It In the issue of
common honesty. It 1Â« the l*Â»ue of good cltl
zenahlp a^Â»lnÂ«t bad citizenship. There Is no
grand national Ittsue Involved. It la simply
the lwue, â¢1H> you want Rvod men In office"â
that and nothing more. (Applause.)
We contend that wo present to you the only
sound solution of that question. We do not
ruy. that there are not good men on the other
ticket. We tin not say thut we are the only
honest mm who have been nominated for of
fice., but we do ray that the Kojiubllcan con
vention was dominated and controlled by the
Southern I'aclMc Railroad. unA thnt its ticket
was dictated In the law department of the
.Southern Pacific and that It was thrown on
the streets from Ute window of that depart
ment, picked up In the streets, brought Into
the Kepubltcan convention and approved by the
flfrurr heads Â« ho ut In the sr-ats of that con
vention. lAi'i'luuw >
This la not mere Idle rumor, gentlemen. I do
not ask you to believe me or to believe the dis
tinguished gentlemen who will follow me on
this point. All 1 ask of you I* to read the Re
publican newspaper*. Read there what they
Â»n.y of the Kej-unllcan ticket ami of the con
vention that nominated that ticket. Kead there
what they say of every man upon that ticket.
Issue Is Honest Government
p>Â«r<HE Twenty-ninth District Demo
| crats assembled last night at
II Pioneer Hall to listen to a<5-
UL dresses by the municipal candi
dates. Enthusiastic demonstra
tions marked the meeting from beginning
to end. Of the many fpeeches made, that
of Joseph S. Tobin elicited the greatest
applause. . .
J. J. Sweeny acted aa chairman. 'After
short speeches by Supervisors Booth and
Dwyer Tobln "was' introduced. Several
times three cheers were lustily given, anil
it was some little time before he could be
gin his apeeeeh. He said:
"When a man huÂ» been toescd for many
days In thick weather and upun an unknown
sea, he naturally avails Itimsi-lf of the drat
pause In the etorm, the firm ruy of sunHhine,
to take his bearings nnd uncertain how far
tbe elements . have drlvuti him from hit. true
comae. Let u.s Imitate this . prudence, unJ
before we flout further upon the waves of
this debate glance ut the pmnt frum which we
have departed that we may at least be able
to" conjecture where we now arc"
Th^se, gentWmcn. are the' words of the lin
murtai Daniel Webster on opening his reply
to Hayne in the United States Senate.
ThesKj soothing and eminently proper words
are of use to u.s now. Let us turn to the
point from which we have deiiarted and oscui
taln where wo are now. l^et uh look back to
the time when San Franclwo was a vlllHtfc,
\u25a0when the water lappi-d the spot whÂ«re Mont
gomery street m<w stretches, when the cikjI
where we stand was a fjiiu hill; when
the Paluce Hotel site was but a waste of
sand, covered with willow ireeH. Let us look
4t that and remember thnt we have grown
to be a great city,- and us a great city we
demand care, we demand attention, w<a demand
good streets, we demand good parks, we de
mand, ubove all, honest officials . in public
life. (Appluuse.) â¢ .
Gentlemen, that Is tho Issue. It cannot be
avoided. It confronts you and It confronts me
and It confronts all. of us. The men upon the
other Â«>ide are controlled by corporations, nom
inated for their own particular, specific pur
imiscs. Upon this side I shall only aay
in concluolun that you know the men that
have beÂ«-n nominated. They have' given you a
guarantee- of their honor, their honesty and
their ability. It is for you to say whether you
will play ihÂ«> fool nnd elect the men who have
ltÂ»-u punlwÂ»d forward by the Southern Pacific
Railroad and- thÂ» other corporations, or wheth
er you will elect the men whom you have al
ready had In office anil found honest, compe
tent and faithful official*. ! (Applause.)
That is the Issue, gentlemen. It Is a. simple
one. You are the people to answer It. Think
nliout It. and before you decide and cast your
vote, remember where your property Interests
lie: where your patriotic Interests He, and
wherw your Interests as good, patriotic, lov
ing ritlzens of San F r rancisco lie. (Applause.)
After Tobin's speech nevera! prolonged
cheers and a tiger were freely given. Then

rick lioland, George Dahlbender, Frank
lin K. I>nne. Judge Fritz. Justus 3. War

nnd District Attorney Bylngton. The
meeting: ended with music by the band.
The Question uf corporate control ia an old
queatlon In Ban Fraiiclncti. It has been
tlucKtii-.d out, campaign after campaign, until
we are all tired of It. But this Is an unusual
presentation of the BUbject, because this is the
Hi'Ht time that the Southern Pacific Railroad
nnd the allied cortK>ratlonH have thrown off th*
iimsk and them(=rlvi!B stepped into 'the arena.
Heretofore they have offered some poor unfor
tunate uh a tiacrl!lce. " Then, If defeated, they
have retired and wald, "We are not In politics."
But this time, gentlemen, there they stand In
the arena themselves. There Is no dispute.
There thty stand. If licked thin time they nay
In future say they are nut In politics, but If
they do say ho it will be because you had tbe
good fcenee tu take a good sound lick at them
this time, now that they have exposed theni
t>elves In the open view. I toy that It' is un-
UMual: It la more tban unusual; It lit tbe- only
time that It nan ever happened:
Tlw other oay a man who practically con
trols thlÂ«- ticket, who nominated this ticket,
was asked by a man who is in sympathy with
him to a great extentâ who contends that the
lowering of water rates, the assessing of fran
chises and the other screws that we .have put
on corporations Justlyâ I Bay Â«uch a man who
evnetnrit! that this fort of action drives them
Into politics, said: "What have you made this
awful mistake- for? Why have you nominated
such a nauseating, such a horrfblc, such a re
volting' ticket? Don't you know that every
body says you have deceived yourself and not
the public; that they say, and say Justly, 'We
know who is behind that mask, that race that
U presented to uÂ»; we know it Is the allied
corporations and their allies, .the bosses.* Why
have you done thin? Could you not put up
somÂ« men and deceive the dear old public in
the same old way?" And this man who nom
inated the ticket eaid he thought then at that
time that he had a cinch, and it did not make
any difference whom he nominated, and he
said: "I am tired of getting 'the' double cross.
This thne I put up mon that -when I press. the
button I know where they&tand."- (Applause.)
' Vote for Honest Hen.
We are fortunate, gentlemen. In being able
to take our ammunition frotn the camp of the
enemy. We do not. have to manufacture any of
our own. We do not have to curry our heavy
urtlllery in the. rear. That id all tound tn the
lump uf th* enemy. Al\ we nave to do Is to
Slve the command "Cbarxe" and - the enemy
lump urnuiui and lick their own allies.
RÂ«nd them what they Bay of every man upon
that ticket from the bead or tuc ticket to thb
foot of the ticket. They Bay that no honest
man. no honeat manâ and that Is the icsue here
distinctlyâ that no honest mun could have ac
ct.t'ted a nomination at the hand* of that con
vention. (Applauue.)' \u25a0 \u25a0

to ignore that document and its assur

of the platform are fully lived uo to.

who aspires to the Mayoraity, would de
liver an aJdress in which lie would discuss
the jpsut-s V>f the campaign, as well us
certain editorial Btateajents eritlclzinp his
candidacy, served to attract a curious,
though not lurjrc crowd. That the audi
Â«aice was mixed as to politics was qu!to
evident and a iamcntable lack of spou
tanloty wenr.Igh rendered the affair one
of the oi^ra boufl'e kind.
It was sÂ«:AÂ» o'clock when Mr. Wells, pre
ceiling the various candidates for munic
ipal office*, numbers of the County Com
mittee. Republican workers and others,
walked Bpaa the stage. ThÂ«? ba:nl playoa
"Marchtr.p Through Georgia." and whex:
the Mayoralty nominee seated himself
some one in the cailcry shouted â¢â¢Three
cheers for Mr. Wells." One feeble cheer
followed and then came st-veral hisses.
which effectually checked the attempt to
arouse enthusiasm. Mr. Wei's bowed his
tlia.nks with a sickly smile and Maurict;
1Â». At-her, the chairman of the evening.
signaled to the band to play. The incident
cast a damper upon t'r.e assemblage, the
chilling: e3eci of which was distinctly fell
throuciiout the evening.
Chairman Asber cauied the meetirs to
order and without oratorical effort Intro
duced Dennis E. McKlnlay a.< the lirst
epeaker. Mr. McKlnlay s^iid the present
cairsr^Jcn was an Important one and that
the people at Sar. Francisco were taking
a deej> interest ia the outcome. He re
sumed :
THE Republican municipal camll
dates opj>earoil in forco at tho
xcass-mooiing hild in Metropoli
tan TÂ»ciir)le la^i night. The an-
eulogy of Mr. Wells. In which his name
was made to rhyme with "bells" and
"tells" and "sells." Aftei an encore. In
which Mr. Tobln was ridiculed to the
tune of "Dolly Gray." the chairman in
troduced Mr. Wells In the briefest pos
sible way. Then followed the weakest
display of onthusiasm ever witnessed. . A
Military voice demanded three cheers anil
u continuous uproar followed, In which
hisses were too plainly apparent. Some
of the candidates on the platform sought
to liven the flagging enthusiasm of the
audience by setting on their chairs and
wildly wavlnp their hats. The attempt
was abortive, howeverâ the audience re
tusÂ»a to enthuse. A second attempt was
made -with like result, a_nd when the out
burst died away line a -sigh, Mr. Wells
began his speech.
The address was -ungrammatlcnl, illogi
cal, in no sense argumentative, but in
eve: y way pitifully devoid of those quali
ties which should mark the expression of
sentiments by a "man whose talents
should qualify him to till bo Important :i
post as the mayoralty of a city like Sun
Krunciseo. In his remarkable oratorical
(cat Mr. Wells stultified himself an.l his
party nominees for Supervisors by declar
es that there were some good men In
the present Hoard of Supervisors and
that the charter was responsible for it.
His allusion to the old "solid nine" ami
his declaration that there were some pood
men even among that body made his*
most ardent admirer wlnco with pain.
When finally he talked of the surplus as
belrp an excellent campaign document,
forgetful of the fact that the surplus was
the result of the work of a Democratic
Board of Supervisors, a howl of derision
arose. Mr. Wells coughed, stammered
once or twice and then took his seat.
Mr. Wells* address, tuken down by an

Democratic Board Praised.
X~adles and Gentlemen.^ My Friends: This
greeting Is indeed pleasing. liven though I
should be defeated for the affU-e for which 1
have btcfl nominated tills tecrinion Is an oasU
In the campaign that will be looked back to
with pleasure in all of my days.
I appear before you this evening as your can
Â«1UaiÂ© Â«oi* tv> say a, few wortis- -not to
raabe a speech. Speechmaktng will follow m>
remarks.
I have served time in the City Hall (Laugh
ter.) I think that I know much about the
needs, the requirements that axe necessary to
properly conduct tbe affair* of our city eov
trmuent. I Know that the Mayor U clotheO
with extraordinary lowers and that most peo
ple are art to think that he It tbe whole
ihlnp. iLaughtÂ»r.) That Is notao. Without
the aid or a harmonious Board of Supervisor*
the Mayor Is comparatively liurrnNs*. and he
has a hot place. Therefore I ray It Is Im
portant, very Important, that he should be
Mirti.>u:sÂ«!Â«-<1 liy a Hoard of Supervisors of the
Â»ame political faith a> himself. You Mv.- thÂ«Â»
Mayor a BoarJ of ciuperv iÂ»ors of one-half Dem
ocrats and ontr-hajf Kei>ubllca.ns and It Is hard
to My what will come of It. l>ut you give him
a Heard Â«>r Supervisor* of the same political
faith as himself, and If the administration Is
not what It should bÂ»- the party ltcWf la re-
FiHMtsible. I know that much has 1*.ti sal>>
bbout our present Uoard of Supervisors as t>e
inr a very good tonrd. It la tiald that a .ka'l
Indian is a pood Indian. Perhaps our rhaitor
has something to do with our present hoard's
belnjr a tcnod board. They are the first Board
of Supervisors that has served undÂ«*r our new
â¢"iiart.-r, and you know that the Hoard of Su
rÂ«rv1sÂ»ors has no patronage. The lioard of
Supervt^re cannot fcrm a rin*. unless It
has In its number at least fourteen. In the
Â©!<1 famous board of the â¢â¢jJjIld Nine" lhÂ«-re
were rozne very good men. but they wcrs not
wilder the control of the charter. I know that
there were able men In that board, and If they
had been In the present Board of Supervisors
they rolrht alÂ«o have been good Supervisors.
There Is another point which I wl?b to touch
ujwr sod that is that eAmpalrn cry of â¢ lar
rluÂ«." I know jonirthl.ni: al-,ul that surplus,
myself. I know that there wns a tax levy to
raise a fund for a linking fund for th* bonds..
There vÂ«t al*o an appropriation for Interest
to i ay the Interest en those bonds. Well,
there were no bonds. i-onsequenUy there ,wÂ«s
no sinking fund required and there was no In
terest required, and ytt thrre was jmOPg ai
propriated for that purpose. Now, you take
naurht from IS3.CC0 and thete. is a surplun of
KS.noO. A surplus Is a very nice thlr.st. I
remember that once In my life I workeO for
$!<> a month for four y^ars and at the end
or that four years I had a surplus. I appre
ciate a surplus, and I know that when you
talk o? a surplus as l-'lrc saved by an ad
ministration of the city fcovernment It I* a
very Fircns factor.' I Ao not know of any bet
ter campaign argument unless It should be
Ji^.ttO surplu*-
But. my friends. I do not Intend to enter
Into an arirument here this evenlnr and on
'his occasion. These thought* come to me and
I think: they are pertinent to the lsiue. I
believe that If you will irtve me a harmonious
Hoard of Supervisors that we two can make
a pretty Â»ood ehowlnjr. And In this connec
tion I would ask you If you are entirely satis
fied with the J1S/Â«)O.C*0 that has been expended
by this present "trood" Uoard of Supervisors?
\u25a0What can be said about the promises that If
they were put In offlre they would run this
city government for I4.000.caj a year. What
have we sot to show for all of those promises
and with this lance expenditure of money? I
think that even an ordinary administration
could do about as well. At all events I am
wllltnic to to* it myself If you give me a
chance.
Indies and g*ntlÂ»:nen. I thank you for this
reception.
The Press Is IHscussed.
P. A. Bergcrot. chairman of the Repub
lican County Committee, waa next Intro
duced. He provoked laughter In the be-
Kinnlnt; by referring to "nandlotlsm nearly
a. century ai?o," but what was meant by
the. statement was not explained. He then
alluded to the pre?s aÂ» n factor of modern
civilization when lt.Â« opinion.* are honestly
advanced, but "when it wallows in the
mlro of blackmail and llbÂ«*l the people will
repudiate it and Us principle*."
Tbe speaker was eloquent and forceful
on thla point, but probably through inad
\'Â«Â»rtenec neglected to admonish his Jiear
*rs that the people will alno repudiate thfs
principles advocated by a nÂ»*W5paper
vhose opinions have been purchased for
$7500.
The speaker praised" an cventnflr â¢ news
paper for Its advocacy of Mr.. Wel'n.and
alluded to the course of The " Call i as fol
lows: _, \u25a0 _
It must be rzM that the Morning. Call Is Juat
corarnenclni? to *e<. the folly of Its wnya and 'Is
awakcolni: to a realization of the, fact- that a
Ki-'at and Imminent danger is ttireatenlnc tkc
I<eople of Pan Francisco, and Indirectly the
l-x'ple of the whole State of California. â¢
Twice this wÂ»ek already It has uttered a
timely cry cf warning to the- pr-ople of this
city. It Is to i,*. hoped, my fellow dtlzrns,
that the well known public spirit of lta vro
prietor will outwÂ«ilt;h and rart aside the puny
r<:-s*:ntmÂ»-nt li* may ferl from hla recent d<?
.'< at. which Is a thing of the past and 'should
be forgotten. Â«nd we may exj^ct within the
next ftw Â«]Â«ys 10 see tbe Morning Call follow
In the wnrthy footsteps of the Bulletin by
manfully and enthuMextlcally advocating the
election of Mr. Wells for Mayor.
And why should It not do so? â¢ The Mornlna;
Call cannot but concede that Mr. Welts la now,
aÂ« he has always been In the past, a plain
man of thÂ»r people and In rUrnp sympathetic
touch with the, people and with all the people.
His Is not In any f>ense a partisan candidacy.
He represents all conditions and situations ttnS
classes of the population, hla ftaccexsfut and
Interesting carrer leading- up from the hum
ble carpenter's bench, where he brgan. to the
hitch political office which he now so worthily
fills.
Victory Is Predicted.
Myron E. Wolf on being Introduced said
that tho Republican party was tho last
to make Its bow to the public, but that
affr November 5 it would be the first to
acclaim It* victory to thÂ« world. The
Democratic meeting of Wednesday even
ing was referred to as a ,"Phelan-Tobln
pink t*a." Resuming .he said:.
Th* question ban been aÂ«kÂ«1 how rrp*ldent
It'.'*Â»-v<-it would vote if hf wen; here. I will
tÂ»ll you. He would Investigate the character
of the randidatrp for Mayor and make the illx
covÂ«ry that Mr. Wells began life as a carj><Â»n
tÂ«r arid row. from the rnnk of employe to that
Â»>f employer. He. would discover that- Mr.
v.'riiB was an honest .man. It ' is true Mr.*
Welle In not absolutely iÂ«Â»rfect. He docs not

Mr. Wolf jiui.l his respects to the local
Democracy, which, be .said, \u25a0was.con
trolled by Mayor Phelan. * Tho Democrat
ic nominee for Mayor was Phelan'a crea
ture, and that meant his repudiation by
the voters on election day. In. closing the

PERSONAL
MAGNETISM
A College, Chartered Understate
LawÂ£,Wlth a Capital of $10O t -
000, forÂ» the Purpose xrf
: Teaching Personal Mag-
netism and Hypno-
tism by Corre-
spondence.
EVERYBODY MAY NOW LEARN
Ten Thousand Copies of a Valu-
able Work on These Sciences
to Be Given Away to Ad-
v vertise the College.
The American College of Sciences, of
Philadelphia. Pa., Is a novel Institution.
It Is chartered under State laws, with a
capital of (100,000, for the purpose of
teaching Personal Magnetism, Hypnotism,
Magnetic Healing, etc., by correspond-
ence.
At an expense of over $3000 the college*
has issued a remarkable work on these
sciences, ten thousand; copies of which
will be given away absolutely free. The
book Is elegantly illustrated with the most
expensive engravings, and It is decidedly
the finest and most comprehensive work
of Its kind ever published. It is the pro-
duct of the combined talent of thirty dis-
tinguished hypnotic specialists and sci-
entists. It thoroughly explains all the
hidden secrets of Personal Magnetism,
Hypnotism, Magnetic Healing, etc. It is
full of surprising 1 experiences, and makes
many startling disclosures in regard to
the use and possibilities of this secret
power.
The college absolutely guarantees that
any one can learn these sciences In a tevr
days at home, and use the power without
the knowledge of his most intimate
friends.
The reporter asked for the names and
addresses of some of the pupils so that
he might communicate with them person-
ally. Several hundred were offered, from
which the reporter selected eighty-four.
The replies received were more than suf-
ficient to convince the most skeptical in
regard to the wonderful benefits to be de-
rived from this mighty power. There were
absolutely no failures. AH had learned to
moke practical use of the sciences^ The
following extracts are taken at random
from the letters, for the benefit of read-
ers:
J. H. Schneller, 1412 Avon street, 1* Croese,
Wls., writes: ''Hypnotism truly reveals the
â¢ecrets of life and the mysteries of nature. Mr
own father could not have convinced me of lta
wonderful power U I had not actually tested
It tor myself. I consider a knowledge of It
Invaluable to those who wish to get the most
out of life; to those who wish to achieve suc-
cess and live up to the fall measure of their
possibilities."
\u25a0 Mrs. Efne M. Watson, MartlnsvUle. Ind..
write*: "Hypnotism opens tbe road to health,
ha&plaess and prosperity. It should be studied
by every one. 1 would not part with my knowl-
edce of it for any amount. The instructions
have developed within me a. forcÂ« of character.
and ability to influence and control people that
I did not dream I could acquire."
J. W. Cling cr. M. D.. Springfield, Ohio,
writes: "I have tucd the methods of hyp-
notism taught by tbe American Cotlesjv of
Sciences In two cases of difficult surgical, oper-
ations with perfect success. It Is a complete
anaesthetic and preferable to chloroform or
ether. I acquired a practical knowledge of
hypnotism in less than three days. The book
Is grand."
Rev. T. W. Butler. Ph.D., Idaho City. Idaho,
writes: "I have cured a number of chronic
eases of rheumatism, dyspepsia and paralysis
of Ions; standing: I bare not had a single fail-
ure; I consider a knowledge of Personal Mag-
netism invaluable. The book has greatly la-
creased my own powers."
Dr. W. P. Kennleutt 5Â» State street. Blng-
hamton. X. T.. 'Writes: "I had long suffered
from nervous prostration and dyspepsia. My
case baffled all medical skill. I studied hyp-
notism from the American College of Sciences,
and tried it upon myself with surprising re-
sults. In one week my stomach was better
than It had been in thirty years. I could eat
anything without the alightest distress. I can
hypnotize myself in five minutes and sleep all
night, have hypnotized a number of others."
The first ten thousand persons who
write to the American College of Sciences
will receive, absolutely free, the marvel-
ous book that brought success to the
above persons. It Is Intensely Interesting
from start to finish. It should be in every
home.- If you' want a copy write to-day
to the American College of Sciences. Dept.
1ST, 416-420 Walnut street, Philadelphia,
Pa., and you will receive the book by re.
turn mall.

HALIFAX. N.iS.. Oct. 19.-Th* prosper
ous and thriving town of Sydney. Cape
Breton, was almost swept out of exist
ence to-cay by a conflagration, which
started about 2 o'clock. The flames, which
were fanned by a forty-flve-mlle gale,
swept through the principal business por
tion of the town. Four blocks of the
finest business buildings are In ashes.
The only thins; that saved the city from
total destruction was a heavy rainstorm,
which set In after dark. The wind de
creased In fury and the firemen and hun
dreds of miners succeeded in getting the
fire under conttol. Over sixty buildings
are In ashes i.rul many more are badiy
scorched. The buildings were nearly all
large wooden structure?, and they burned
so fiercely that It was Imposslbk to save
any of their contents.
Tho flre started In a three-Btory fram<)
building on Charlotte street, occupied by
A. D. Ullles and Gordon & Keith. When
the firemen arrived on the scene the
building was burning and the wind wan
blowing the flames Over the tops of ad-
Joining buildings. Half an hour after the
flre started one-quarter of the tui.-lr.c**
portion of the town was In flames. The
water supply gave out, and the engines
had to be sent to the harbor, to pump
water.
Zt Is only, a few weeks since a number
of white Democrats co-operated with

caacyon the Federal bench in Alabama,
and Washington spoke fpr these white
Democrats when he came to the capital
and assured Roosevelt that Jones would
Â«coept the appointment and that It would
be satisfactory to all classes.
Washington had seen the President and
had acted as his agent in Interviewing
GoTwnor Jones and others as to the ap
pointment. The Southern Democrats ap
plaofled the appointment of Jones and
they praleed %\ ashington for using his ln
floeac* at the White House to secure such
ea appointment for a Democrat. Then
they all spoke of Washington as a gentle
man of culture and a refined sense to cut
loose frora the Republican leaders of the
negro party In the South and work in har
mony with the best class of the whites.

Th* name mentioned In the teletrram is
that of Miss McDanalti'8 brother, who wad
captain of the steamer. No particulars
tat given as to the manner in which the
rraf t met her doom, and thÂ© names of tho
others who were lost are omitted. A tel
egram addressed to tbe local officer of the
company, however, states that the God
tfard was lost on Sunday last and that

able that the three who were drowned
comprised all who were aboard her.
The steamer Goddard was a sister boat
to tbe Kllbourne, which, with another
email ftteamer, has been employed by the
company In towing logs and scows for
the mills. Tbe Kllbourne waa operated
on the Upper Yukon, towing logs and

Thousands Saw the Game.
California was not without Its hero,
though he was discovered so late In the
game that he almost misled the laurci
wreath. Graves, the slender, swarthy
end-running substitute half-back, put into
the game by the coaches as a gambler
makes his last desyerate throw of the
dice, ran the Stanford end like a thor
oughbred on the homestretch time after
time, and once when the Stanford Cap
tain Tarpey's pJaying too clone up gave
him his opportunity he circled the end
and Pkirteri down the nlde line, on and on
and on. with the Stanford backs straining
in pursuit, till he had footed - the 67
yards between his Btfrrtlng-polnt and the
goal line and had placed the -ball nquarely
back of the goalposts, making the only
point scored by his team. It was a great
run. splendidly made, and what with his
many other Â«laÂ«h-s around and smashing
Into the line and fighting for every foot
poHKlble. to gain. Graves made a name for
hlmsHf that will last beyond his four
years in college. w
Paul Tarpey. the stocky little Stanford
captain, couldn't keep out of the glory.
First he kicked the yrettiest field goal
ever made on a California . gridiron.
Then he picked up a blocked ball after
another try at a field goal, ran 30 yards
with it and made a touchdown, and Imme
diately afterward kicked** the goal. Those
eleven points were Stanford's winning
total. Between times Captain Tarpey
played his team with excellent Judgment,
did all the puntingâ an.l creditable punt
ing it wasâ and .smashed the line repeat
edly for many yards' gain, the longest
being twenty-live yards after hurdling
over tackle.
baby classes of the two universities first
began meeting in annual contestâ the best
exposition of football, the most replete In
spectacular plays and in thrills and heart
breaks for the audience. Against a team
of Indomitable courage and with many re
markable first year players in Us line
up, the Stanford eleven played a snappy,
consistent and at times meteoric game
that achieved complete and unquestioned
victory.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Oct. 19.â The Tala
football eleven met its strongest advers
ary of the season thus far in the gama
with the Pennsylvania State College on
Yale field this afternoon. Yale won by
the score of a to 0, but the figures of
the score do not represent the quality of
offensive and strensth of defensive which
the Pennsylvania State team put cp. A
number of times they pushed their backs
through the Yale line, though inability
to sustain the attack as Yale did prevent
ed" their scoring. Yale's players were al
most used up before the second half ended
and two of the Pennsylvania State team
were taken out or shifted.
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 19.â Princeton
defeated Brown here to-day by a score
of 33 to 0. Twenty-three points were mads
In the first half and twelve In the second.
Brown was unable to stop Princeton's
backs, who repeatedly went through her
line, for big gains. Princeton showed up
stronger than in any previous game in
her general work. Her backs fumbled
frequently and followed their interference
well.

BUFFALO, N. T.. Oct. 19.â Fully 15,000
people thronged the Pan-American sta
dium this afternoon to see the football
game between the Carlisle Indians and
the Cornell . University. Cornell wonâ 17

the resources of the crimson and white,
for the' Indian ends got over the ground
fast and showed the Itbacana a few
things In the way of playing. The Cor
nell team was the heavier. Hunt made &
touchdown in the first half and Coffin
kicked the goal. Hunt made a ninety
yard run for a touchdown in the second
half and Coffin again kicked goal. There
was an exchange 'of 'punts and then Cof
fin stole around Carlisle's right end and
made a run of seventy yards for the third

If thÂ»Â» money was withheld It was not
his fault.
Great Iptercst in the Flight.
M. -Deutsch said he would give 25.000
francs to the poor, notwithstanding the
decision of the committee, but Santos-
Dumont declined to accept the offer as
u solution of the. difficulty.
There wu.s a large assemblage of people,
at the EinVI Tower and considerable In
terest waÂ» manlfrstpd In tho experiment
in othrr parts of Paris, groups of people
gntl.erlng '.i the streetn to watch the
piogrraa o! thÂ«Â« elongated yellow balloon
with long guide rope hanjilnjf and white
canvas propellers whirling around, while
those below distinctly distinguished , the
loud buzzing of the motor.
Santos-Dumont rounded the Eiffel Tow
er between the second and topmost plat
forms nt about seventy-flvo yards away
from the tower. The balloon pitched
scmowhat when going against the wind
and BnntoH-Dtitnont, when he descended.
Â«old the motor suddenly stopped while
the balloon wan a little distance from the
tower. 11 f. thouKht he rnlKlit have to-de
scend, but luckily he succeeded In getting
the machine started ngaln. From that
time on tho motor worked satisfactorily.
"My friend, you have lost the prize by
forty KÂ»Â»cnnd5."
Numbers of the onlookers protested
ap?Inst this announcement in lively
term*, but the Count fir Dion Â«ald:
"This is the -1'K-ii'ion of the commlttpp.
In accordance with the rules of thf con
test."
Tho rro7 # d. however, refused to accept
this view an-i a warm discussion ensued,
the majority of thf spectators taking tho
ground that Santos-Dumont was entitled
to the prlxe became he had reached the
grounds within the thirty minutes, al
though he had not descended Imme
diately.
Th>Â» aeronaut, after proteatlnjr against
the decision of the committee, finally
Fhrusged his shoulders and remarked:
"Anyway I do not care personally for
the l'JW.OOO francs. I intendÂ«-d to give it
to the poor.""
The crowd persisted Jn declaring that
Ssr.tos-Dumont had won. A number of
laiJirs who . were present threw flowers
over the aeronaut. Others offered him
bouquets, and one admirer, to the amuse
ment nf thfÂ» onlooker*, even presented
M;n with a little whlto rabbit. ., ,

At this moment M. Deutsch himself ar

"3 HE first round of the John Grace Challenge! Cup stake
II was run down yesterday at Union Courshis Park be
ll fore one of thu largest Saturday crowds that has been
JJL aecn at the grounds in many months.
In the morning two rounds of a special stake were
run. Tho talent found it hard to pick the right dogs in this
â¢vent, and at its close had contributed'. <xÂ«itÂ» freely to the
pikers.
Not a bit daunted, however, the wfc*e onÂ« continued to se
lect thrtr favorites and offer tempting odds. T3Â» first course
in tljÂ«,b!s: stake went wrong for them. Sir Pasha, at 5 to 3.
beating Ireland pointJcn3. Further along Firm Fellow spoiled
their short run of luc* by takrnff a\ ;w*TT" deserve*! victory
from'Dowdrop, a 1 to 5 choice. This upset was the only Impor
tant one. though LUtlf Slitter beatln? 'Game Boy and Fonte
noy; outpointing Aeolus dliptsed of two good outside chances.
Of the champions o* the past Palo Alto's work was the most
assuring it tho overnight' prices are Va'critePlon: '"â¢ ThÂ«T: great
stake winner was undoubtedly possessed of the splendid burst
of KXMd t hit has made him a wonder, but he went in pur
suit of a hare that, nhovred a t!i.Â«r>osHian to prolong the chase.
Geary** champion; 1 fell in thu latter >part of the course, evi
dently from weakness, bat at that he won a good trlaL
Beacon. tÂ«io. put up a strong go.' but not of the* kind that
made him a reputation rn last year's event.
Sisquuc ran a great doc and wll! have Palo Alto for his
next opponent. The course will be well played.
Rector is stake favorite and deservedly, too. At one time
Flni Ftri ha-1 him outpointed 7 to 6. but the youngster came
in for a strong flnlsa as<t won hanUllx. .
Narcissus is a good* outside chance, and the sapltngr A. J.
Martin Is fast enough to keep company.
George Malcolm's nomination, Charta, though not at the
head of the price list. Is spoken of on the "way down" as the;
surprise of the stake. Malcolm carried off the rich prize with
Sacramento Boy last year, and many will play him to repeat.
The coursing throughout was satisfactory and without
flukes.
The prices posted at the close of yesterday's trials were:
Rector, at 2; Palo Alto and Beacon. 3: Sir Pasha. 5; Luxor,
Sisquoc and Vandal, 6; Charta. S.

HANDSOME VOUNO LADIES OF BERKELEY WHO WILL ACT AS USH
ERS AT THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE GIVEN BY THE UNITA
RIAN WOMEN'S AUXILIARY AT SHATTUCK HALL.
BERKELEY. Oct. 19.-Lleutenat Colonel
Marlon 1*. Mbus. inspector general of the
Department of California. In h!s report on
the last annual Inspection of the military
department of the University of Califor
nia, held during the latter part of the
spring term of this year, has recommend
ed several Important and Interesting
changes to the United States' army
authorities concerning the cadet corps.
His report, mude public to-day at the
university, highly commends t.ie general
work of the department.
Colonel Maus recommends that there be
held an nnnunl mdet encampment of one
wrck. He atutos that the general iÂ»oytÂ«rn
ment would uromote military etliciency
by providing for the oneumpment in the
way of UK-rul appropriations for teiKUKe.
mmp and gurnson equipage for tigulur
field service. Target practice, he sayB.
should be held during the encampment.
Colonel Maus n.lleves tlwt the Govern
ment would advance the Interests* of Its
l)pÂ«;irtmcnt of War by seeing that such
Institutions as 'he. University of Califor
nia are not lacking In iupds to instruct
their studentÂ»-in military science.
He makes another Important recom
mendation from the student stanopoint,
and that is tint ull college men who. are
working their way through the university
receive free uniforms from the Govern
ment ' He al*<Â» recommends that suoh
military clothing as can be \u25a0pawd by the
ueneril Government be Â»old to the cadets
upon the approval of the proper. college
und military authorities.
Colonel Maus In his report says:
"1 found the clothing, arms and eqfilp
m<'iU of the cadets complete and In very
good condition, and the step, military ap
nearancc and bearing good, there being u
riecldtffl improvement since the last Inspec
tion. The instruction In the school of the
company was found to be generally sat-
Isfrtctory. Care and attention had been
\u25a0 Riven to this work. Judging from the man
: ner In which the ceremonies of inspection
1 nnd review were carried out. It was also
i evident thai very satisfactory Instruction
had been given In battalion drill."
Colonel Maus makes special mention. of
Armorer John C. Mitchell in his report.
"This soldier has received" a Congres-
Klonnl mcdnl of honor and Is held In high
PKteem. The arms and other property !n
the care of Ordnance Sergeant Mitchell
are kept In Rood, sesvlceable condition.*'
! Colonel Mnuw' comments on the effl
1 clency of the cadet corps are much more
â¢favorable tlmn those he made a year aso.
At that tlmo he reported the bearing of
i the (ttt'dcnts unsoldierly and decried long
I hnlr nnd â¢muhnven faces.
Leslie Stuart, the composer of the mn
aic of "Florodora." Is here from London
with Ms wife and Is staying at the Pal
ace. He is a typically well groomed young;
Englishman, very modest and unassum
ing, who takes his honors In a blushing
manner. He Is out here on pleasure, and.
leaves to-night for Southern California.
Mr. Stuart made his first hit In compos
ing the coon song "Louisiana Lou.". This
was followed by the song "By the Sad
Sea Waves." His songs are now eagerly
sought after by music hall singers "across
the pond."
The composer says there are at pres
ent three "Florodora" companies in
America â one in NÂ«w York and two tour
ing the country. There are five com
panies touring England with the same
comic opera, one in Australia and one in
South Africa.
His latest work. -"The Silver Slipper,**
is being produced at an immense business
In London. A company will shortly be
brought from London and produce it In
this country. â¢ â¢ . . â¢ \u25a0 .

AI.AMEDA. Oct. 19.-For ten days
two savase. bow-legged bulldog?.
with the assistance of a gang of
smaller but none the less vicious
monsrcl canines, have prevented
Constable George EL Clarke from serving
a warrant of arrest upon their aged mis
tress. Mrs. Dorothea Olsen of 623 Santa
Clara avenue.
Every time the officer has visited the 01
Â«en premises with the official document in
hi* Inside pocket he has been confronted
at the gate with the fighting squad of
d<jgs, every one of which is longing for a
chip of the limb of the law or a souvenir
patch of his pantaloons. .
Constable Clarke Is not a man who la
short on moral or physical courage. He
Eeived through the Civil War with honor.
Ho, has been upon the firing line many
tin.es, but says the sensation is not to
be compared' to that of a man who has
been up against a biting line of carnlver
ous curs.
Constable. Clarke has tried every mili
tary sortie /known in his efforts to rout
the canine' forces guarding the besieged
Mrs. Olsen. but thus far he has made no
headway. He has proffered kind words and
fresh steaks, has whistled appealingly
and made friendly gestures at the cohort
of canines, but all to no purpose. The
dogs have refused to greet him with the
glad tall and will not masticate his meat.
Aged Mrs. Olsen directs the movements
It Is very probable that Constable
Clarke will call In Poundmzster Alfred
Ewing to help biro raise the siege at Ol
sen's and clear the way for the operation
of the law. Tacticians who have recon
noitered the situation say that an allied
force of this kind would score a victory
In short order.
The warrant for Mrs. Olson's arrest was
issued on complaint of a neighbor who
alleged that the old lady disturbed the
peace.
Mrs. Olsen Is 82 years of age. Some time
ago she surprised her friends by marry

BERKELEY, Oct. 19.â A recital of the
facts surrounding the abduction of Miss
Ellen M." Stone in Turkey, the people who
have dono it and their motives, is given
by Veltcho Nickoloff Madoh-ff, a N Mace
donian at present in this city, and who
claims to be a member of the Macedonian
Society and in direct communication with
the celebrated Macedonian committee.
He claims a personal acquaintance with
Mies Stone, his native village, Beletesa.
being but three miles from where she wia
captured. With his knowledge of the
people and affairs there he believes that
ho Is able to give correct reasons for her
capture.
According to Madolcff Miss Stone was
taken Into captivity by brigands from his
own people and possibly members of the
Macedonian Society. He declares em
phatically, however, that the act was
without the knowledge or connivance of
either the Macedonian committee or the
Bulgarian Government. The brigands
who took Miss Stone have one purypse
only for thctr act. and that is to- secure
money with which /to pufehase arms to
revenge themselves against the Turks for
outrages committed on tne Maceuoiuuitd.
The brigands, according to Madoleff, are
a comparatively ignorant people, who
recognized in Miss Stone an opportunity
for bountiful ransom. In speaking of
them MtuloKft said:

The subject matter Is of general Interest
to all concerned In San Francisco realty.
F. D. Marsh of the Burnham & Marsh
Co., who has just returned from the Bast,
has been looking: Into the New York law
concerning the selling of property. This
law, he says, should greatly Interest prop
erty owners in San Francisco. . Under its
provisions it is made a misdemeanor to
offer for sale any realty without the con
sent of the owner. This puts a stop to
the hawking of property, and the buyer.
In dealing with the broker, knows that the
broker has a legal right to sell and that
he will have no trouble in procuring his
deed in case of purchase." The practice
of some who have offered a property for
a smaller price than the owner -would ac
cept, thus confusing buyers and retarding
sales, would also be remedied by the New
York law.
The jury In the matter of competition
for the proposed German Hospital build
ing selected by the building committee of

and Schnaittacher & Boese. All the plans
will remain on exhibition in the east gal
lery of the ferry building until Saturday,
October 28. The public Is respectfully In
vited to Inspect the same.
The banquet of. the First Regiment of
the American British rifles held last night
at the California Hotel proved to be a
most successful affair. Theentlre mem
bership of the regiment, together with a
host of. invited guests,- gathered around
the festal board. The officers and the pri
vates of the. regiment were attired in nat
ty khaki uniforms, ,< which presented a
novel .yet picturesque scene in contrast
with '.the dainty decorations of the tables.
Although the feasting began at 8, it was
near the midnight hour before the sol
diers and their guests reluctantly drew
buck their chairs. .
Major P. W. D'Evelyn acted as toast
master. Among the speakers were a
number of British officers who had as
sisted in building up the great British
empire. â¢ They. told of the achievements
which, won England her -magnificent 'do
main in Asia and Africa and paid a high
tribute to the valor of her soldiers. Gen
eral R;-H. Warfield, in hts toast to the
King, dwelt uÂ»on the amicable relations
existing between'the two great branches
of the English speaking -people. He
pointed o'Jt the manner in which the in
terests of England and America coincide.
Words of Friendship.
Remarks testifying to' the friendship of
the United States and -England were re
ceived with applause.. -But the talks were
not all of this serious nature, as many
were devoted to^SBbJects which afforded
occasion for the sparkle of wit and mlrtli.
The affair was from beginning -to end an
unprecedented . success and It will long

News From the Mines.
"The code itself states that the actual
engagement of counsel in another suit
pending Is a sufficient ground for the con
tinuance, and the violation of Mrs. Green
an's rights In this regard is alone suffi
cient to overthrow the order of dismissal
mada by the board. There were also
many other 'irregularities in the conduct
of the board's proceedings."
"Attorney Eugene N. Deuprey appeared
at the trial for Mrs. Greenan. On the
morning of the trial he went before the
Board of Education and stated that he
had an Imperative professional engage
ment In court as an Assistant District
Attorney, and moved for a continuance
of the trial on that ground. This request
was denied by the board and Mrs. Green
an was forced to trial without ihc pres
ence and assistance of counsel. She was
without an attorney during all of the tlrst
day. when the testimony for the prosecu
tion was being Introduced, and Â»he was
thus deprived of the Invaluable right of
the cross-examination of adverse wit
nesses.
"The trial of Mrs. Grecnan was want
ing In every essential element of fair
ness, and no court on earth will sustain
the procedure adopted by the Board of
Education.
Mrs. Rebecca Qrecnan through her nt
torney, Stephen V. Coatello, Hied a suit
yesterday to compel the Board of Educa
tion to restore her to her position as
principal of the John \V. Taylor School,
from which she wan removed Februury 3,
1900. She also sues for $3100, the amount
she would havo received as salary If she
had not been dismissed. Mrs. Greenan
Is a holder of a life diploma, and taught
here from March, 1S77, up to the time of
her dismissal. Charges were preferred
against her by School Director Uergerot
In January, 1900. She was Vied and dis
missed, and the circumstances surround
ing the trial she now claims were of much
a nature that her dismissal was unwar
ranted. Attorney Costello In speaking of
Mrs. Grecnan's claim for restoration said
yesterday:

the duration of an acute contracted disorder.
If It proceeded beyond six weeks It was con-

FVom statistics compiled from our oractlce tn
the past five years, covering over 6800 cases.
we can show that M per cent of our patients
hare recovered In fourteen days or less. It Is
therefore, equally proper to hold that a/oase

irn\Â» all the imi rumors which tea UM specu
lative luru;- Â«i uift spring seemed to awaken
uneasiness In the mtuus of some ot the great
nnancial powers, with the Sail rreseure upon
the money market still unrelieved Â«nJ the
eai.rt to awaKen an active uuli speculation
Â»Â»Â» dUcoumcea. ..iuch Interebt has b-'Vi
leit all through the week in the North

tome denree "â¢*' excitement, although oc .1 *u,
prissea \u25a0 narncter. uwing to ewerecy maintained
us to the actuaj developments There haÂ»*
been many inuicatiuns that me situation in
that nVld is developing and changing, the most
lmi>rejÂ»ivÂ« ot whtca was the sudden activity
of Northern 1'a.cittc preferred In the stock mar
ket alter a period o( almoM absolute stagna
tion ever since the Northern faclnc contro
versy and thÂ« resulting panic ot May 9. 1 h
public is quite umnifrnit-d as to wnat steps
have been taken toward a solution of lite
tangle which resulted irom the conflict for
control of Northern t'acinc, beyond the ap
pointment of the conciliation members of the
txmrd as recommended by J. P. MurÂ«ar> Tbe
task ot a. sÂ«-ttlement. remained tor t-ii- con
ciliation beam to work out. Meantime the
situation, su tar as the public was Informed,
continued to be one of armed neutrality, with
each interest jeÂ«luusly guarding Its holdlnits
of securities to Insure tnelr advantage. The
liberal supply of Northern Pacific preferred
ctock which found Us way Into the market
on Thursday point**! unmistakably to a re
laxation of the solffltude with whlcto every
available share has been held after scouring
every security market In the world to secure
It. The prices to which the securities were
pushed by that wild scramble and the enormous
accumulation reflected In the volume of the.
transactions In them left no doubt that vÂ«Â»i
amounts of capital has been locked up In the
struggle. Where the capital came from the
financial world has never known definitely.
No subsequent capital Issue by any of the rail
road companies concerned bw reveatled any
provision lor the money expended In the whole
sale purchafe of Northern Pacific stocks In the
open market st that time. ThÂ« heavy bur
rowing* Irom foreigners since revealed by thÂ«
sustained demand for foreign exchange with
which to repay them point to the conclusion
that much of tt has been carried by bank
loar.s here and abroad. The embarrassment o(
this condition Is obvious and was the basis
cJ the color given to last week's rumor of the
formation of a securit}* boldlns; corporation to
hold the eecutitPes of the ruads concerned ami
"release large amounts of capital." It Is not
dlRlcult to deduce that' this phrase deals with
the fact that a cort>oratlon which owned a
minority of th- stocks of trieÂ«e roads would be
able tn offer a minority of Its own ktock to '
the public without losing that control, which
would be a multiplication of th* process used
In the control of the Rurlington by the North
ern Pacific. This Important problem and its
bearings on the money and exchange markets
have bÂ»en the dominant Influence on the re
pressed speculation of the week. In the money \u25a0
market the renewed movement of currency j
to Southern iÂ»>lnts has marked the belated
movement of cotton to market In lanre volume. ,
With the completion of the payments for re- I
denptlon of Government bonds under the '
Treasury iJepartment's late offer the re
quirements of the sub-treasury at New York
â¢ have r*mn to maJce inroads upon the money I
market at/aln. The probable extent of theÂ»e |
requirements is awaited to make clear the tu.
ton of the money market, which r-eemed to
l>* reassured list week, a number of special !
transactions also have to be considered. In- â¢
eluding the purchase of Â»20.0OO.fliÂ» of IÂ»enn- !
sylvanla Company bonds and a H0.CKO.0f>) pay
ment on account of th* landing soft coal com- I
blnatlon. Some uncertainty over the future of i
railroad earnings has been Indicated. The I

In Paris there has been null* an acute dis

and the seaboard bought for export. Late In
the session profit taking eased the market and

WILL YOU MAKE SOME! MONEY IN THIS?
A big new laundry Is coming to town, and
it s going to make some money. The com-
pany has decided to make it even bigger than
originally intended. To speedily effect the
proposed enlargement the company, at first
. a close corporation, has decided to sell a
small block of its stock by popular subscrip-
tion. It is the bargain of the day In in-
dustrial lines, and Is being subscribed for by
our clients in all sections of the State in re-
ply to an advance circular mailed to them
a few days ago. It has been subscribed In
amounts running from $5 to $800. Dividends
will, so shareholders believe, equal the
amount of the Investment in about three
years. Call or write for circulars, or better
yet, talk the matter over with us. You may
like it well enough to buy. while we recognize
your privilege to "turn It down." Subscrip-
tion books are open at our office. THE

PAYING QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.
Thousands of readers of these advertisements
have cause to regret their apathy as regards
pharos of the Montezuma Mining Company of
Washington when they wert offered a few
months ago at 4c and Be. .The price of shares
Is now Siic cash or 2Sc on Installments, yet are
only one-quarter the price they will be In less
than a year; for Montezuma shares are cer-
tainly going to par value of $1 per share. The
reason for It Is obvious. While no copper ore
has been marketed, many tons of it are being
piled up on the dump at the "Tacoma" mine,
where a second entry Is being driven. Active
work In tunneling 'was suspended for two
months while the machinery for operating the
air drills was being Installed. That work Is
completed and a largely Increased operating
force is now busily engaged In taking out ore.
Before this ore can be marketed It Is necessary
to build an electric line of about 18 miles to
connect the mines with the Northcfti Pacific
Railway, which has Just been completed from
Fairfax to the new town of Montezuma, where
a postoffice has been established.
DIVIDENDS PAID FROM COAL.
While work at the copper mines is, as stated,
being vigorously prosecuted, operations at the
coat mines are even more active. Mora than
100 men are at work at the mines and In the
building of a 50,000 ton bunker at Montezuma.
The coal taken out Is of a superior quality for
steaming: and coking, while the product of our
groat blacksmlthlng vein, varying from Â« to 8
feet |n width. Is being sold on the Tacoma and
Seattle markets at *10 per ton. Montezuma
shareholders are absolutely certain of handsome
dividends from this coal alone, there being 52
feet of it In eight veins, all above water level.
As to quality, we cannot do better than quote
the following report of the test of Montezuma
coal made by the Quartermaster General's De-
partment Washington. D. C, and addressed to
Major Ruhlen. Quartermaster, Seattle, Wash-
ington, as follows: \u25a0
GOOD COAL, SATS THE GOVERNMENT.
"I am directed by the Quartermaster General
to advise you that the said sample (Montezuma
I Ccal) has been carefully tested by this office
and was found to have an equivalence of eight-
een hundred and fifty-nine (1859) pounds to the
cord of standard oak wood.
"This coal was tried also In a blacksmith's
forge, and was found to yield a heavy weidlng
heat."
â¢ Accompanying this report Is a tabular state-
ment of testa of various coals In use on the
Pacific Coast.
Franklin Coal. Washington.. 2222 lbs
Nanalmo, British Columbia 2212 lbs
Scranton Anthracite. Pennsylvania IMS lbs
Welsh Anthracite. Wales 2<Â«3 lbs
j Wellington Coal. British Columbia.. 20*3 lbs
South Prairie. Washington 1973 lbs
MONTEZUMA IJ59 |bs
It will be seen from the above that our Men-
j tezuma Coal has nearly eight and one-half (S.4)
\u25a0 per cent greater hfiUJng^power.than the celo-
; brated Nanalmo Coal and Welsh Anthracite,
and falls very little short of Pennsylvania An-
thracite Itself. In this respect. Considering that
the Montezuma Coal was taken directly from
the mines unwashed, this Ik Indeed a remark-
able showing.
WHAT PRACTICAL MEN SAY
ABOUT MONTEZUMA COAL.
Recently quantities of coal from our new
celebrated " Blacksmith" vein (7 feel wide)
were submitted to certain manufacturing firma
In Tacoma for thorough testing In a practical
way. The following 'is one of several letters
showing juji how these coals behave on the
forge:
' Colonel C. W. Thompson.
i President Montexuma Mining Co.,
- Tacoma, Waih.
TACOMA. Wash., Oct. 1. 1901.
Dear Sir: We gave the coal you tent us a
thorough trial, and find the following result:
First we used your coal for Hve hours doing
heavy, solid work, lamely In welding, and
found It gave the vrry best satisfaction, mnklng
a good strong heat, free from sulphur, and
quite free from clinkers. In fact, during the en-
tire five hours' work It made but 2 lbs 6 oz of
clinker, and a part of that was welding sand.
Ynur roal Is not quite as heavy as the Penn-
sylvania (Cumberland blacksmith coal, but tak-
Ing It altogether. It ranks with that coal for
general blacksmith purposes, and the Pacific
Coast Is to be congratulated on having auch a
blacksmith roal as yours to supply the large
and growing demand.
I understand the price of your coal Is S10 per
ton delivered. If so. please send us as soon as
convenient a carload. Youra truly.

When It la remembered that the company has
practically unlimited quantities of this coal
which. It li estimated, can be mined and placed
on the cars for $1.15 per ton, the values behind
Montezuma shares can be understood. The
Montezuma Mining Company's shares with the
coal and copper back of them are at present
price* unquestionably, the best Investment now
offered to the public. , â¢
ANNUAL MEETING.
The annual meeting of the stockholders was
held In Tacoma, Sept. 10. The California
Branch Advisory Board was represented by Mr:
J. 8. C. Thompson. Mr.' W. A. C. Smith, ex-
pert accountant ot^San Francisco, wholaudlted
the books of the company, presented his re-
port, of which the report of the Secretary and
Treasusrer Is a condensed statement. Expert
Accountant Smith, In concluding his 4 report,
said: "I feel quite satisfied with the general
accuracy, and especially with the cash book.
The office Is entitled to credit for method and
accuracy." : . ' \u25a0 . â¢ ' .
The profits are dividends. It must be remem-
bered that the policy of the Montezuma Mining
Company malces It Imperative that every sur-
plus dollar derived from the sale of coal must
be paid In dividends to shareholders. That the
development of - the copper properties may be
continued without interruption it la necessary
that additional t shares be sold. These shore*
are absolutely free from the element of specu-
lation, since regular dividends will be paid on
them. from the products of the coal mines. â¢
