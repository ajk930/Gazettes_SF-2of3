Sampson to Schley.
Tells ; of Carrying ; Dispatches From
HOOD OF. THE HAWK TTRA-Rp.
: "I will make an announcement while wn are
waiting. There has been Introduced before the
court a question of the correctness of the Iden
tity of. a, certain very Important dispatch sent
by the Harvard May 27 from Santiago, by the
commanding officer of the flying squadron. It
appears that In the process of translation from
.the commander in chief to the department aome
changes In the language of that dispatch oc
curred. I do not desire at this moment to In
terrupt - the proceedings by any discussion of
that point, but I shall merely make the an
nouncement here that we do Intend to enter
into that' matter very fully and completely:
that is to say, as fully and as completely as
the court may desire before we leave It."
Lieutenant Wood was then dismissed, and as
he' was leaving the courtroom Hanna took oc
casion, to say: . ' Â¦â¢
The witness replied that he knew of Â°none.
He' said, "in replying to another question by
Raynor; that vessels In the inside harbor could
not have been discerned from the outside.
. Hanna asked if steps had been taken while
the flying squadron was off Cienfuegos to as
certain If the Spanish fleet was inside the
harbor there. '
"Not that I know of," was the response.
"Was there any effort to destroy the shore
batteries there?"
Hanna objected to Raynor's methods of ques
tioning, especially to his â¢ characterization of
Captain Harber's testimony as wronjr, when
Captain Harber had said distinctly that he only
spoke from his best recollection. â¢ "This,"' he
said, "is an Indirect impeachment of the wit
ness."
Raynor again Insisted that he. had only In
tended" to bring out the facts.
"No, sir."
The Court â Could you see the Texas from the
Dupont during, the nights of May 22 and May
2X?. .
"I was inside the llhe, .Inside the Castlne-"
"You "are perfectly right about that, but you
are not asked in reference to any criticism you
may have upon the repori. of the commander tn
chief. The question is this: ; Captajn Harber
has definitely stated that there was no picket
boat Inside j the line at Cienf uego3. Tou say
there was and that the Dupont was one of
those boats."- .â¢ . â¢
. "I wish to bring Jt out that the Dupont was
inside the line and that la the report I mada
to the department. I. still stand dn the point
that he is not bringing out where the torpedo
boat was."
"I" call your "attention to the report of the
commander In- chief In which . he states 'the
line of blockade." 'â¢ Â¦ -
â¢ "He did not mention any. and I have a letter
on file In the department calling attention to
the omission in-that report."
/'Do you 'recollect any statement made by the
commander In chief when he had a picket boat
within- the picket line that he had arranged a
signal from the picket boat to the flagship?"
" "You'afe Vfy'lrik to Justify Captain Har
taer's want of recollectton by statins that the
commander In chief wrote a letter that there
were no iMcWet boats there."
"He' did not mention their presence and I cor
rected it."

the commnnder In chief also Â¦ reported that the
Dupont was not there. I have written" the De
partment that I was there. Other people forgot

. Several Â¦ points In to-day's testimony
were distinctly favorable to Rear 'Admiral
Schley. It, was again brought out' from
Captain Wise, In reply to a question from
the .court,' that he did not command Cap
tain Bigsbee \ to give to Rear Admiral
Schley upon the arrival of the flying
squadron off Santiago the information
contained in the department dispatch as
to ' the whereabouts of the Spanish fleet.
Lieutenant Spencer S. Wood testified that
the two nights that he waa with, the
'flying; squadron off Cienfuegos a picket
'was maintained inside -the line of tho
Favorable to Schley.
Rear Admiral Schley and others Inter*
fered before' the controversy could go any
further and. quiet was restored before the
court reconvened.
* "I'may be .suspicious," replied Captain
Parker, "but I. am always a gentleman!"
Much bad feeling h'as i been engendered
between Judge Advocate -Lemly and
Hanna on one side and Raynor and Cap
tain Parker, Rear Admiral Schley's coun
sel, on the other. During the noon recess
of the court to-day they had a verbal en
counter In which both Captain -Parker
and Judge Advocate Lemly lost their
tempers. Some one had told Raynor and
Captain Parker that Judge Advocate
Lemly - had charged them with having
given to the Herald and The Call the dls,-'
patch which Commodore Schley proposed
to send on July 3, 1898, announcing the re
buK of the battle with ' Cervera's fleet.
The judge advocate was asked whether
ho' had made* any such charge and he
flatly denied It. There was then some hot
talk between the opposing counsel as to
which, side waa responsible for the publi
cation of the. dispatch, which finally cul
minated In Captain Parker â¢ saying In a
significant manner, "I have my sus
picions."
"Yes, you; are always suspicious," re
torted the judge advocate. â¢

patch as received in the Navy .Depart
ment, and is found to agree exactly. â¢
Hanna, Judge Advocate Lemly's as
sistant, in a lull In the proceedings to-day
referred to the Intimations of the other
side that this dispatch . had been changed
by the Navy Department, and announced
that it was proposed to take .the matter
up later and show that such was not the
case. It is understood that the evidence
which the judge Advocate has. in his pos
session Is a letter press book of the auxil
iary cruiser Harvard. This dispatch .in
question was delivered by Rear Admiral
Schley to Captain Cotton, commanding
the Harvard, to be' taken to Kingston
and cabled to the department It was 'put
Into cipher by Lieutenant* Beale of Â¦ the
Harvard, oh the way from Santiago to
Kingston. The cipher copy was press
copied in the Harvard letter press book.'
This copy. It Is understood, has been com-

It Is not known whether the judge ad
vocate has evidence In his possession
showing that Rear Admiral Schley per
sonally made the changes in the dispatch
after it had been copied into his letter
press book and before it was, translated
Into cipher, but. if It can be shown that
changes were made before it was trans
mitted by cable, the department will be
relieved of the imputation of having
changed it, ani the duty will devolve
upon Rear Admiral Schley's attorneys of
explaining why they permitted this false
imputation to tho court

expects to be able to convert Raynor's
Intimations that . the . Navy Department
had changed thÂ« much-talked of dispatch,
in which Rear Admiral Schley had in
formed the department that he could not
obey the orders Â¦ to remain off Santiago,
Into a boomerang. He expects to show
that the changes in this dispatch except
such ' changes '. In the arrangement of
words as would result from putting It Into

into English were not made after the dis
patch was received in the Navy Depart

Lieutenant JohnHood, who commanded
the Hawk and who carried to Rear Ad-'
miral Schley. the final, urgent" orders for
him to leave Cienfuegos and. go to San
tiago, told of the delivery of thede orders
and of his telling "Rear "Admiral Schley'
that Rear Admiral' Sampson"*expected him
to go at once. , ..<,.. . , '...
Captain McCalla said there was no rea

Lieutenant Wood knew of no steps

squadron to. carry out -the instructions
which he carried for Rear Admiral Schley
to attack the shore batteries at
f uegos. Â¦'...â¢
.The testimony was not. all favorable to
.Schley.' The judge advocate succeeded in
bringing out some strong points against
him. On the ever-occurring question "of
the. coal supply ' and the possibility , of
coaling ships at sea. on the south side of
Cuba Captain McCalla's -testimony was
specially damaging. He had no , uneasi
nessabout the' coal account "of the j Mar

pedo-boat Dupont,- of. which he, was In
command. This was important in; view
of the previous testimony by Commander
.Harber that he could, not, recall having
seen any~plcket boat. Lieutenant Wood
explained 'that Commander Harber 'could
not have seen the Dupont from where
the Texas was lying. It was also- mor^.
clearly established than before. that the
commander of the flying squadron 'could
not have known of "the code; of. signals
which Captain. McCalla had arranged
with the insurgents, at Cienfuegos. I ".'
â¢WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.â As usual Admiral
Dewey lost .no time to-day'^ln bringing the
Schley court of inquiry to order, and as usual
the counsel on both sides of" the case were In
their seats' and prepared to' proceed promptly
t with -the > business - before the â¢ court. Captain
Lemly estimates that he '.will be able to con
clude the presentation of the Government side
'of- the case by the close of next week. He sayu
he. will' have about fifteen or twenty more wit
nesses to Introduce.
. One of the "most regular attendants upon the
court. is. William. H. Stayton,- the attorney, who
is understood to be prepared to represent other
..naval fi of fleers than Admiral Schley. He sits
outside the r rail and does not in any way par
ticipate' In 'the proceedings. He said yesterday ]
that so long as Admiral Sampson was kept out
of the case' His. would have nothing to say.
I , To-day's '. session, began with the recall j of
Captain Wise to make, verbal changes in the
.â¢official : copy } '' of, his testimony. He altered his
'previous statement concerning the order of the
' Navy of May 20, 1S98, in which he
was directed to "inform every vessel off San
tiago that . the ' flying squadron .Is off Cienfue
gos," .saying, that, he desired, to correct his re
sponse to the_ court's inquiry, as to why this
order was not carried out, by stating that It
had been^ carried out.' "The flying squadrdn
was ordered 'to proceed with 'all 'possible dis
patch,"'he said; and added:' '
"I did , not , desire 1 to inform the commodore
of the flying, squadron of "his own movements.

"All I desire is a snappy breeze tc -mor
row," said E. D. Morgan, mar. aging
owner of the Columbia. "Don't intjrpred
this to mean that In a strong wlcd the
Columbia can win. for, as to that, only
the test can ;tell, but I want a race, a
good bona-fide contest, where the mettle
of both' the marine steeds will be tested.
"Yesteday's trial was not only no race,
but It was no contest. Because the Am
erican- boat was In the lead when ws had
flukes in the wind is no reason why we
should declare that the Columbia han out
classed the Shamrock. Time alonii can
solve the problem. We hope for victory,
but that Is all we can do at present."
"Say ten or twelve or fifteen knotsâ
anything,. In fact, over eight knols an
hour. We do not mind a sea If only we
have the wind to drive us. The sea will
not bother us unless, Indeed, Men last
time, there is a sea and no wind. IVe do
not want a regular easterly gale, for that
would make thing3 unpleasant for all
concerned. But we hope for a nice breeze,
and a good 'race to-morrow. Whj / had
even one of the boats been able to finish
within the time limit In Thursday'!! race
the test would have been thoroughly un
satisfactory, regardless of the winning
boat."
Confident of Shamrock.
"I am just as confident as ever, and
everybody aboard, Captain Sycamore, Mr.
Ratsey-and Mr. Jameson, share my con
fidence. We have seen the Shamrock
sail, and know what she is capable of.
We have also seen the. Columbia, sail,
and we know what she can do. . We are
more confident than ever. But give the
Shamrock a fair breeze."
""What do you call a fair breeze?"
"Oh, a nice breeze." " * .

"Why, none here has seen that boat

W... WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.-Presldent
Roosevelt now intends to ! make an ex
tended visit to the Pacific Coast next
year. According to a statement made* to
day by John Barrett, former Minister to
Slam and a friend of tho President, there
is every -reason to believe that the Presi
dent has made up his mind on this sub
ject. Mr. Barrett, who has had several
talks with the. President recently, said
to-day: '* .
"While I am not authorized to make
any outline of the President's formal In
tentions or plans, I can say that ho has
told his friends he would visit the Pacific
Coast States next year. H. .W. Scott, pro
prietor of the Portland Oregonlan, and
8. A. Perkins of the Tacoma (Wash.)
Ledger, who have also discussed this mat
ter with the President, left for the coast
to-day with a confident belief that this
trip would be undertaken.
"The Itinerary would probably take the
President through the northern tier of
States to Washington and Oregon first,
thence south to California, and ne would
return through â¢ the Central Western or
Southern States. It is Interesting to note
that, though the President has often vis
ited the Rocky Mountain States, he has
never been to the Paciilc Slope, and he
naturally desires to become personally, ac
quainted with that important section.
"It can be said that he had originally
planned this trip aa Vice President, and
now as President he will simply be carry
ing out his former intentions." . *

When the court began Its afternoon session
Reynor continued his cross-examination of
Lieutenant Hood. The latter said his recollec
tion was that he had delivered his dispatches
to Commodore Schley in his (Schiey's) cabin,
but it might be that he had handed them to
Lieutenant Wells and had walked down to
the cafcin with him. He thought there was
no one In the cabin when the conversation
between himself and the commodore had taken
place.
Raynoi* was proceeding to question the wit
ness concerning his conversation with Admiral
Sampson, when Admiral Scnley leaned over
ftnd warned him tiiÂ»t this conversation had
been, ruled out.
Raynor then chanced his line of questioning.
He said:
"I went to ask you Â¦whether In this conver
sation with Commodore Schley upon this oc
casion he did not tell you that Admiral Samp-
Fon had instructed him before he left for San
tiago to satisfy himsflf that the Spanish fleet
was not at Clenfuegoe?"
"I told Commodore Schley that the admiral
certainly expected the squadron to leave the
instant I arrived. Commodore Schley then
eaid. In nearly these words: 'I am not at all
catlsfied that the Spaniards are not here at
Cienfuegos.* "
The court here took a recess for lunch.
Admiral Schley Calls Attention to
QUZSTIONEB BY EAYNOR.
the Court's Ruling.
The witness then testified that the steamer
Adula in passing had reported to the Brooklyn
that a cable report had been received at Kings
ton May 19 saying that the Spanish squad
ron was In the harbor at Santiago. Admiral
Schiey's report of this occurrence was also
read, as was his statement discrediting the In
formation because he then believed the squad
ron to be In Cienfuegos harbor. All these re
ports have heretofore been published.
"There was not."
"He said his ships all wanted coal: that the
Massachusetts, Texas and Brooklyn wanted so
many tons of coal and that the day before Cap
tain Sampson had sent him down the Iowa
v.ith only half her coal supply, eo that she
could not go anywhere; that It was useless to
eend ships down, there only half filled with
coal. I told Commodore Sehley that I had
parsed a collier convoyed by a gunboat only
a little before daylight that morning and it
â¢would certainly be there with at least 4000 or
6f-00 tons of coal within two or three hours.
He referred again to his belief of the Spaniards
being in Cienfuegos and stated that he had
heard some firing about forty miles from port,
which he took to be a welcome to the Spanish
r quadron. He had also seen some smoke which
he conceived to be the Spanish squadron and
he believed they were there. I said to Commo
dore Schley then that the information which
the admiral had he considered as definite; he
bad r.o doubt that the Spanish squadron was at
Santiago. Commodore Schley then said to me:
â¢Captain Sampson does not understand: he is
not on the spot and cannot Judge.' I also ln
lormed Commodore Schley that the admiral
certainly expected the squadron to leave im
mediately, which did not appear in my writ
ten orders, to remain with the Hawk alone at
Cienfuegos after the squadron had left and
conduct a blockade for a day or two or as
king as my coal supply lasted."
"Describe the commodore's manner on this
occasion," said Captain Lemly.
â¢The commodore was eltting In his chair all
the time I vs-as talking to him. very quietly.
He seemed to be very much perplexed at what
to do."
"Do you remember whether there was any
thing said about communication with the in-
Eurgents?"
"There was something said by me.
"In the commodore's presence?"
"No: to the chief of staff on deck. The
commodore was in the cabin."
â¢â¢Can you etate whether or not during the
time you were at Cienfuegos with the Hawk
any effort was made to communicate with the
insurgents?" â¢
â¢'Commodore Schlcy read the dispatches and
then, turning to me, said: 'Captain. Admiral
6ampÂ»>n wis-hes me to gu to Santiago. I can
not do It."
Itaynor responded briefly: - ' â¢
"1 only desire to state that while this Is our
Investigation, these are your specifications un
der the precept. We asked for this Investiga
tion and Instead of letting us give the precept
under which we would like to have the inquiry
tal-.e place you form a precept of your own.
Here is an applicant who aeks for a court of
Inquiry under specifications framed by him
self." . r
The rourt retired to consider the objection,
remaining out longer than on any previous oc
'caslon. Admiral Dewey read the court s de
cision as follows: \
"The court sustains the objection of counsel
po far an it relates to -conversations that took
j>laee on board the New York, but this ruling
does not apply to any verbal orders which the
commander In chief directed witnesses to con
vey to Commodore Schley."
Heplylng- to a question put in connection with
this decision, the witness said his instructions
were contained in the memorandum handed him
to be delivered to Admiral Schley, which was
r*sd to him.
The witness then r<Â»ad dispatch No. 8 from
Fampson to Srhley of May 21, telling the latter
that the Spanish squadron was probably at
Santiago. He also read the Brooklyn receipt
memorandum, showing that the dlypatch as
well as the accompanying memorandum had
bf^n received at 8:05 a. m.. May 23. The wit
ness Identified thÂ«e as the orders he had car
ried. He also raid that he had carried two
ether envelopes, one containing orders from
the deiiartment and the other a memorandum
which had not been read to him.
He eald he had arrived off Olonfuegos at 7
e. m.. May 23. and had gone aboard the Brook
lyn for the purpose of delivering the dispatches.
In re*poni<e to a request from the Judge advo
cate Lieutenant Hood related the conversation
be Jiad had with Admiral Bchley after deliver
ing the orders, sayfng that he (the witness)
V.ad told the admiral that It was Admiral
Sampson's wish that the flying squadron vhould
j-rocPed Immediately to Santiago, as his In
:ormatlcn was very positive. His statement
wan as follows:
He eaid that on May 23 he had delivered dls
]iaichcÂ» irom Admiral Sampson to Admiral
kchley, when the latter waa off Clentuesoa.
lie related that ho bad been called aboard the
>tw Yorkâ Admiral Sampson's flagshipâ on
May 21. ween thÂ» officers on board were pre
pariag dispatches. He spoke of the presence
of Aamiral Saiup&on.
itaynor objected to the introduction of con
verbttion or of verbal orders, saying that thÂ»
orders would speak lor themselves and mutt
necessarily supersede any verbal Instructions.
The question was argued at some lensth by
Itaynor and Captain L*mly. In closing his re
t;ioiise. the Judge advocate said:
"An objection of this character is almost
equivalent to withdrawing the request for an
Investigation. He has asked to have the Judg
ment of his brother officers in this matter. L,et
us have It and don't put technical obstructions
in the way of havfcig the investigation."
â¢ "We found." he added, "that Cervera was
not Inside the harbor and that, in fact, the sit
uation in Clenfueg-os was exactly as it- was
when I left it on tha 16th Â«' the same month."
"Captain McCalla sent the Information ob

found that the handsomest boy baby was
Leroy Ford, the "14-month-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Ford of Petaluma. Alta
Amanda Leggett, a nine-month-old maid,
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry B.
Leggett of Santa Rosa, was awarded the

Rice's skull was fractured, both arms
were broken and his face and breast had
been eaten away by the bear. One foot
was almost completely severed and his
coat and cartridge case were in tatters..
Two men remained behind, armed with
rifles, intending If possible to shoot the
bear, while the others came to the city
with the remains.
Rice was away for seven or eight hours,
v/lien Adams became anxious about him.
All night he kept up a big fire in the hope
of attracting his companion's attention
should he have been lost, but in the morn
ing there was no sign of Rice.
Adams then went to a logging camp
near by to obtain assistance and, -with a
half dozen men, started up a ravine where
Rice had taken his course the previous
day. They found Rice's body less than
two miles from the shore of the lake. He
was lying alongside a fallen tree, on
which were the marks of his boots where
he had be'en walking. It appeared as
though he had passed a bear farther up
the log and had not seen It and that the
bear silently followed and leaped upon
him. The man had fallen over the log In
such a way as to break his back, or else
he was killed by a stroke from the bear.
His body and the surrounding brush were
covered with blood.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 27.â Daniel
Rice, a mining man and hunter of Kaslo,
in the Kootenay country, was killed and
eaten by a grizzly bear early this week
while hunting near Alnsworth. Rice and
George Adams -started on Sunday on a
shooting tour down Kootenay Lake, and
the same night the men landed on the
shore and camped. The next day, at noon,
Rice started across the divide to kill a
bear, several haying been seen in that
vicinity. The grizzly bears usually stay
high up the mountains, out at this time
of the year they come farther down in
search of deer and smaller animals that
live below the snow line.

Lewis Garrison, who visited the claim,
recently, vouches for the truth of the
foregoing statements. He says the extent
of the gravel is simply marvelous. He
panned for himself and brought the pan
nings to Nome. Other well-known citi
zens who have examined into the stater
ments made as to the wealth of the claim
aver their belief in them.
At the bottom of the 100- foot shaft a
sort of false bedrock was found. Above
this was six feet of pay gravel, which
averaged from 20 cents to 30 cents to the
pan. The owners resolved to keep on
sinking, and a short distance from the
first shaft they began 'a- second. At a
depth of 175 feet they struck the true ted
rock, with seventy-nve feet of pay gra.vel
above it. It has been systematically and
thoroughly panned and the smallest pan
recorded was worth 25 cents. Two hun
dred'feet .of tunneling has- been done and
the pay runs the same... . â¢ Â¦'
The amount of gold bearing dirt simply
passes belief, but there'it ls\to show for
Heelf and convince the most skeptical. Its
value must be enormous, and its owners
say it is not for sale at any t price. It was
bonded for $50,000, and its 'owners were
"shivering in their boots," fearing that
the price asked would be paid for It; but
the bond lapsed and they breathed a sigh
of relief and went to work with a will.
They have taken out and washed a good
deal of dirt, and the result-was even more
satisfactory than they had expected. They
gave out no information as to what they
were getting and none but themselves
knew of the bonanza that lay beneath
their claim. Now they say they do not
care who knows of the great nnd.
This claim was located in 1899, and the
owners have been developing it ever since.
Two shafts ' have been sunk to bedrock,
one 100 feet deep and the second, which
also serves as an air shaft, 175 feet.
SEATTLE, Sept. 27.â A dispatch from
Dawson says: A pay streak seventy-flve

Czolgosz was in normal condition this
afternoon and eemed to have fully recov
ered from his collapse. There are live
cells for condemned men in the prison,
and Czolgosz was placed in the only cell
vacant, so all are now occupied. Two
keepers are constantly on guard in â the
room, which is separated from the main
prison, but to guard against an attempt
os Czolgosz's part to commit suicide two
more guards have been added and one will
constantly sit in front of Czolgosz's cell
and will have a key so that any attempt
at self-destruction may be easily frus
trated.
The collapse of the murderer was a sur
prise to every one. On the route from
Buffalo he showed no indication of break
ing down. He ate heartily of sandwiches
and smoked ciears when not eating. He
talked some and expressed regret for his
crime. He said:
"I am especially sorry for Mrs. McKin
ley."
He reiterated his former statement that
he had had no accomplices, and declared
that he never heard of the man under ar
rest in St. Louis who claimed to have ded
the handkerchief over his hand, conceal
ing the pistol with which the President
was shot. He says the handkerchief was
not tied. He went behind the Temple of
Music, arranged the handkerchief so as
to hide the weapon, and then took his
place in the crowd. Through Jailer
Mitchel he sent this message to his
father:
"Tell him I am sorry I left him such a
bad name."
As soon as the handcuffs were unlocked
the man was dragged into the principal
jailer's office. As in the case of all pris
oners, the officers immediately proceeded
to strip him and put on a new suit of
clothes. During the operation Czolgosz
cried and yelled, making the prison cor
ridors echo with evidence of- his terror.
The prison physician. Dr. John:Gherin,
examined the man and ordered his re
moval to the cell in the condemned row,
which he will occupy until he is taken
to the electric chair. The doctor declared
that the man was suffering from, fright
and terror, but said he was shamming to
some extent.
Either for fear of the crowd, which was
not very demonstrative, or from the sight
of the prison, Czolgosz's legs gave out
and two Deputy Sheriffs were compelled
to practically carry the man into the
prison. Inside the gate his condition be
came worse and he was dragged up the
stairs and into the main hall. He was
placed in a sitting posture on the bench
while the handcuffs were being removed,
but he fell over and moaned and groaned,
evincing the most abject terror.

Since England sees fit to deny this continual
violation by her of the laws of warfixe. the
states represented by the undersigned con
sider that they also, in regard to this differ*
ence. seek a decision of the permanent court of
arbitration. The undersigned and their gov
ernments are aware that in order to obtain
such a decision the consent of England is re
quired. They, therefore, take the liberty of
soliciting your council to apply for Â»u(h con
sent or to endeavor to obtain the same by
your mediation or by the governments repre
sented by you. Should the English Government
give an unfavorable reply It will thereby be
manifest that they dare not submit theioselve9
to the Judgment of a conscientious. lean ed and
impartial tribune. They will then, mcreover,
continue to bear the responsibility for tie- pro
longation of a 'war as terrible as it Is unnec
essary and they will have tacitly acknowledged
that the manner In which they have carried
on the war is in conflict with the dems.nda of
humanity and civilization as confirmed by
themselves.

The undersigned, moreover, allege that Eng

an opportunity thereto shall be afforded them,
to substantiate the allegation herein made by
setting forth and proving the particular facta

Â¦ The states represented by the undersigned,
therefore, consider that they should repeat the
proposal made by them before the wir. but
rejected by England, to submit to arbitration
the differences which gave rise to the -v-ar. In
this they particularly have in view ths ques
tion whether England is right in alleging that
any action was taken by the republics which
had for its object the suppression of the .English
element or its expulsion from South Africa, and
generally whether the republics have mads
themselves guilty of any act which, aciordlngr
to internationally recognized principles, would
give. England the right to deprive them of
their Independence.

SENSATION IN SCHLEY INQUiRY
SANTA ROSA, Sept. 27.â All the
schools in Santa Rosa and most
of those in the surrounding coun
try were given a holiday to-day
to enable the children to attend
the agricultural street fair. Large num
bers of visitors from Kenwood, Glen El
len, Sonoma and other places in the val
ley were in attendance. This was Santa
Rosa and Sonoma Valley day, and the at
tendance was the largest of the week.
The stock parade came off this' morning
as scheduled, and a tine showing of ani

rade was the Juvenile division. It was

ARE SHOWN IN ARTISTIC EXHIBITS.
Two naval officers, one representing the Gov
ernment, the other Admiral Schley, In the court
of inquiry, were at the signal office in the War
Department to-day, searching: for copies of dis
patches that were exchanged between the fleet
and the signal station at Aguedores between
July 1 and July 3, 1898, inclusive. Nothing
could be found and It is supposed that If the
messages were wigwag-god and communicated
to General Shatter at headquarters by telephone
the signal officer In charge made nc^record of
them. The officer. M. F. Green, has been tel
egraphed as to whether or not any records were
kept of the messages. The messages sought
were those between the flagship New York and
the shore.
' j After the court adjourned Stayton said that
to-morrow he would i again renew his request
to be allowed to appear In Admiral Sampson's
behalf. He added that the continued refer
ences to Admiral Sampson were offensive and
should be properly met. He further stated that
he did not regard favorably efforts on the part
of the judge advocate to prevent exploitation
of Admiral Sampson's part In the war. He
thought It better to bring: the matter in and
meet the question squarely.

THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY ROUNDS
FAMILIAR FACES AT THE RINGSIDE
DURING THE FIGHT BETWEEN PU
GILISTS WALCOTT AND GARDNER.
The fifth was a busy round. Gardner
fought cautiously, not leaving a single
opening for Walcott to take advantage of.
Both men were fresh In the sixth. This
round ended in fierce fighting. Walcott
landed a right swing on the back of Gard
ner's head in the seventh that made the
latter unsteady on his legs. Toward the
end of the eighth Gardner staggered Wal
cott with a right to the head.
The men adopted â¢ rough tactics In the
Gardner Staggers ; Walcott.
Deceptive Fighting Face.
Gardner's "fighting- face" is deceptive.
From first to last it was "sad and care
worn, but this is said to be its natural
expression. He seemed slight when com
pared with Walcott and gave One the im
pression that he was stale from over
training and fighting. Â¦ He has engaged
In five important battles during the past
live months. Gardner said he felt in per
fect condition and his faultless blocking
Indicated that he was. His marvelous
cleverness and his hard hitting did not
avail him much when the target at which
he was aiming was so elusive and so un
certain as Walcott proved to bo.
Gardner went after Walcott at the first
tap of the gong. He did not have far to
go. as Walcott was bent on the same
mission, having Gardner as the objective
point. .Walcott was the first to lead and
reached Gardner's face at once. Gardner
tried several rights and lefts, but found
Walcott an awkward mark. Toward the
middle of the round Walcott landed a
rl^ht and left on the 'head that brought
Gardner to his knees. Gardner was not
much damaged, but he took the full nine
second allowed under the rules. For a
time the spectators thought this was the
beginning of the end, as Gardner seemed
distressed when he went to his corner.'
Gardner wrestled Walcott down in the
second. He kept playing for the colored
man's head, but not effectively. Wal
cott's favorite blow was a left rip to the
stomach, which he landed twice. Gard
ner missed a right swing that would have
felled an" ox.
In the third there was an exciting mix
up, out of which Walcott came in better
condition than his opponent. Walcott
showed some clever foot work in side
stepping, but it did not rattle Gardner.
Walcott seemed like a will o' the wisp
In the fourth. Gardner seemed unable to
find him at first, but improved toward the
end of the round.
cott's head. The colored man thus got
under a lot of swift rights and lefts
which, if they landed, would have done
terrible execution. Walcott, on the other
hand, could reach Gardner's body and did
so repeatedly. If Gardner was not one of
the cleverest and coolest of defensive
fighters he would have gone only a short
distance along the route last night. His
body seemed covered : with gloves, and
many, of "the resounding blows landed by
Walcott thus failed to reach a vulner
able spot Many of the blows sounded
like the noise made by the mainsail of a
yacht flapping In a strong wind. Â¦
' Walcott was in trouble but once dur
ing the fight. This was in the fifteenth
round, when Gardner accidentally butted
him on the head. For a time Joe's sense
of location" deserted him and he hardly
knew where he was. During the minute's
rest he was revived with salts of am
monia: He appealed to .the: referee to
protect him from further assaults from
that quarter. Barlier in the fight Gard
ner cut the top of his head, but was un
able to explain how it happened. â¢

to-day. Flood, while protesting a decision
of: the umpire, landed a right swing on
Levy's jaw, and was put out of the game
for so doing. Flood says that Levy called
him a vile name and Levy denies doing so.
Later in the game Levy , and Stricklett
collided. "Levy struck Â¦ at r Stricklett and
the latter tore the umpire's shirt collar
off. Courtney was badly spiked, â¢ acci

' The game was won by the Senators by
a score of 14 to 7. Schmidt, who pitched
for Oakland, was hit hard, the Senators
getting sixteen hits, including doubles by
Devereaux, Stricklett, Hoffer and a home
run by Doyle. Stricklett "was found for
seven hits up ,to the ninth inning; then,
as the game was won. he. lobbed the
sphere over and allowed four more hits.
At the end of the game Lohman protested
on the ground the umpire ordered
Stricklett out of the game and then al
lowed him to continue playing. Umpire
Levy denies having ordered Stricklett out

Atherton made a great catch of Nordyke's
long fly In the eighth. It looked like a three

Householder secured two out of the four hits
made- -by 'the Redlegs yesterday. Eddie Is still
the leading batsman of his team.
Pabst made a great run to thÂ« first base
bleachers and caught a foul. He was loudly
applauded, as It was one of the hardest foul
catches made this season. :
McPartlln has a great slow ball and he can
put some puzzling curves Into it. Ills control
is good and he is hard to rattle.

ron the college gridiron this after
noon at 3 o'clock. The game will
be the first in which the teams
shall have played this season.
California has considerable advantage
over its opponent in the matter of prac
tice. The college men have been at work
longer and ought to be in better physical
condition, and again they have had many
more practice line-ups against an oppos
ine team, than their rivals. Each even
ing for some days past they have played
against the second eleven. Reliance
should have better team work, as the
Berkeley men have spent much of the'lr
time trying out for positions during past
practice. Weight Is also on the side of
the club men and they have some sure,
swift players. A hard s fought game is ex
pected. If the weather continues warm
the halves will be shortened.

CINCINNATI, Sept. 27.â Oakley Park grand
circuit summary:
Considering the comparatively few
weeks of practice the cardinal team ia
making a remarkably good showing.
Slaker, at full, hits the lino like a steam
engine and is good for his distance on
every ' buck. Raltt, at quarter, runs
through a scattered field in the same way-
Captain Fisher, when seen this after
noon, said that the Stanford team should
win easily, owing to the present unorgan
ized condition of the club team. Several
second eleven men, he says, will be put
into the game in the second half so as
to give as many of the men as possible
a chance. Fisher expects to line up in his
position at left half for the first time to
morrow, provided a shoulder protector
which he has sent for arrives. He has
not been in the scrimmage work up to
date for fear of again injuring his shoul
der, which was badly hurt last season.
The line-up at the beginning: of the first
half will be: Boren, left enfi; Traeger, left
tackle; Thompson, left guard; Hauver
man, center; BarnheiseK right guard; Mc-
Fadden, right tackle; Cooper, right end;
Raltt, quarter; Fisher, left half; Slaker,
full; Smith or Hill, right half. In the sec
ond half Parker and Allen, backs, Kuhn,
end, and several others will be substi
tuted. ...
Club on the campus gridiron to-morrow
afternoon. Not much is' known of the
Olympic' line -up, bo the comparative
strength of the two elevens is purely a
matter of conjecture. The game should,
however, be taken by the cardinal, as It
has the advantage of longer practice and
practically the same in personnel as the
1900 varsity, with the substitution of a
few of the best second eleven men of last
year. The clubmen have had too little
practice to have acquired anything like
good form or perfect team work. Tne in
dividuals composing the team are, never
theless, former college stars for the most
part, and men who know the game.
Raltt recovered at on:e, but Nourse has
been confined to his bed under the care
of Dr. Stlllman of Lane Hospital and
Dr. Wilbur, the resident physician. The
physicians say that everything seems fa
vorable for an early recovery. Nourse is
a brother of ex-Treasurer John T. Nourse
of the Associated Students, and extremely
popular among his college associates.

SUMMARY. â¢
SAN FRANCISCO.
The Germans' side of the score was
blank until the last half of the. ninth
round, when Pabst-scored on' hits by him
self and Krug. It began to look like an
old-time Baltimore finish, as Shay fol
lowed with a hit, -..but a great double play
by Reitz and Kihni put Shay and Brockoff
out. Then-Nordyke fouled to Spies and it
was all over but the shouting. The
score: . s r r''-'Â«-Y-': â¢ : â¢ Â¦ â¢ .
Atherton and Householder made the cir
cuit for the Angels during the eighth.
The big fielder led off with a clean sin
gle, went to third on Householder's dou
ble and trotted home 'on Krug's wild
pitch, Householder ,. going to. third and
scoring on Kelly's out to second.

Morley's reorganized Angels triumphed
over Uncle Henry's Germans yesterday
at Recreation grounds. The fun began in
tne ''initial' round, when "Chimmie der
Whale" displayed his bad taste fbjj doubt
ing "Pop" Hardie's word and was put out
of the game in addition to being- fined a
five spot. The trouble continued during
the ensuing eight innings of slow ball.
The locals hit harder, but, made so many
errors they threw the game away. .
The Redlegs sent two of their members
across the plate in the fifth. Kelly got
four bad ones, took the middle sack on
Spies' sacrifice, and came home on Reitz's
drive, which caught Dougherty at second.
In this play Schwartz made a wild throw
over Paost's head and allowed McPartlln,
who had previously been walked, and ad
vanced like Kelly, to score. During all
this mix-up not a hit was made off Krug,
bases. on balls a.nd errors being responsi
ble for all the damage. ...

The men had hardly shaped in the ring
when it became evident why Walcott
likes to fight big men â the bigger the bet
ter. Gardner's arms, if driven out at a
natural angle, would be far above Wal-
The decision .of Referee Jack Welsh
was a Just one. Walcott was the aggres
sor throughout and what clean blows
were delivered came from his battery.
He scored the only clean knockdown, al
though Gardner wrestled him to the floor
several times. The fight was not a scien
tific one, there being too much wrestling
and rough tactics prevailing throughout.
The disparity in size alsa precluded the
possibility of displaying science. The
men clinched continually and during their
bear-like embraces Gardner punched Wal
cott's body and slapped him over the kid
neys. 'Â¦ ':Â¦' i â¢â¢Â¦: â¢Â¦
A Fair Decision.
JOE WALCOTT, the marvelous hu
man fighting mabtaine, gained the
decision over George Gardner last
night in Mechanics' Pavllon after
twenty rounds of desperate fight-
Ing. There seemed never a moment from
the first tap of the gong to the last when
the men were not In action. Walcott was
in superb physical condition and the
fhower of blows rained on him by his
opponent seemed to carry no sting with
them. The colored boxer is not to be
measured by any rules such as other men
are gauged by. He conceded Gardner,
pronounced the most promising . middle
weight In the world, about fifteen pounds
in weight, seven years In age and eleven
Inches in height, and then sailed into him
as though the odds were the other way.
When the principals and seconds held
their usual discussion in. midrlng. the
spectators could not repress a laugh at
the snectacle Walcott made. He wad the
shortest man in the ring and the jolllest.
Â¦ For a time it seemed likely there would
be a hftch in the proceedings. Walcott
â¢knew his opponent's right hand was not
' in the best condition, and he made a per
sonal examination of the method by
which it was bandaged. Gardner had his
gloves on. but removed them so the band
ages could be inspected. Walcott at once
made a determined objection to the band
aging, claiming it was too heavily rein
forced, making it almost as hard as a
plaster cast. â¢ . â¢ :
O'RourkÂ© tried to quiet him, saying ho
would ask the referee to pass Judgment
on It. This was done, and it was decided
that some of the bandage be removed.
Gardner retired to his dressing-room, the
spectators the while jeering at Walcott.
The latter's cherubic countenance was, if
anything, more expansive, and he Bmllcd
back broadly at the remarks hurled â¢ at
him from the gallery. '

"Water Front Notes.
. Another vessel was added to the overdue
fleet last night. The British ship Crad
anlr is now out 170 days fr6m New Cale
donia for Philadelphia, and the under
writers are afraid or the risk. When the
vessel left the French penal colony they
were glad to take chances on , her at 1
per cent. Now they are willing to pay
60 per cent to reinsure their risks. All
the other overdues are at the same quo
tations.
, At Beale-street wharf there was a slight
mishap on the British ship Dunfermline.
She Is loading canned goods for Europe
and yesterday a sling load of salmon
went overboard. There were fifteen cases
in all that went over the side and divers
are now seeking- their recovery.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha- Nippon Maru
got away for the Orient on time yester
day. She did not carry a great number
of cabin passengers, but was crowded
with freight and had over 300 Chinese in
the steerage. Among those who went
away on her were Prince Theodore Ypsl
lanti and Baron Poellnitz, who are mak
ing a tour of the world. The Prince is
from Greece. He said on the Mail Dock
yesterday that he was glad to have seen
America. Among other cabin passengers
were quite a number of missionaries re
turning to their posts in the Orient. Some
of them came near being massacred -by
the Boxers, but, nevertheless, are - going
back to their posts. The full list of cabin
passengers on the Nippon Maru is:

NIPPON MAETT DEPARTS.
The first reliable news from the whal
ing fleet reached here yesterday on the
schooner Bonanza. According to Captain
Smith's report, when he left Point Barrow
over a month ago, the Belvedere had nine
whales, the Beluga seven. and a half, the
Karluk one, the Bowhcad. five and the
Narwhal five. The Fearless and Penelope
were bare. Â¦
It Is known, however, that the Fearless
has already sent down "the bone of one
whale and- the" Karluk that of two. In
the case of the Beluga the men had se-Â«
cured an enormous right whale, but when
hall out a stoim came up and they had
to cut away, losing the head, the most
valuable part of the mammal.
On the Bowhead.a boat's crew had a
very narrow escape. They had made fast
to a leviathan and when ready for the kill
a mistake of. the boat steerer brought
them too close to the whale and the sweep
of the tail threw harpoons, lines, boat
and men into the air. The men were
rescued by one of the other boats but two
or three of them were still on the sick
list when the Bonanza left Point Barrow.
On the Belvedere all hands were . in
great spirits -and every one in the fore
castle was figuring on his percentage qi
the catch. As whalebone and oil are way
down the chances are that they will not
receive anything like the amount they ex
pect.

yacht race 'do the people show anything like 'the
interest taken in former years, but all the same they
will be exciting enough when they get started.
A Boston millionaire has left to that city a fortune
of several millions to found and maintain a home for
incurables, and noi\ for the first time the public
learns that an incurable Bostonian ever felt the need
of any other home than he has. . / v
The city officials in New York have given a coat
of white paint to -the figure of Justice on the City
Hall, and the incident is regarded as an evidence that
Tammany, will try to get everything whitewashed be
lox% the Selection takes place. ' V, â¢
The New York man who has involved himself in
all sorts of trouble for having driven his wife frantic
by ringing alarm clocks by the 'wholesale at mid
night was. probably trying to play even with his bet
ter half for. ringing one when he came home after
midnight. :>Â¦'{Â¦; Â¦'Â¦
The Examiner, which was expelled from the Bo
hemian Club on Wednesday, reached the conclusion
on Thursday that the members of the ..Bohemian
Club are dissolute. This probably means thaV some
members of the yellow outfit have not yet in decency
retired from the club.
The anarchists are enemies of the United States,
inasmuch as they are enemies of all government and
this is a government. Those who give them aid
and comfort. by such means as Hearst has used are
aiding and comforting, therefore, the enemies of the
United States, and the law can reach them and him
and hit like without nny abridgment of the constitu
tional rights of the people. This is distinctly an issue
in American politics, and will disappear only when
settled in favor of the right of the Government to
srotcct it* own existence^. '* Â«: .
Anarchy teaches not the betterment nor the preser
vation of government, but its destruction, its total
extinction. The law can forbid and can punish the
teaching of destruction of government. Since such
destruction can only be secured by . violence, the
teaching is of the quality of treason. Treason is de
fined by the constitution as jevying war against the
United States or giving aid and comfort to its ene
mies.
Wisdom and safety require that something be done.
The mere exclusion of anarchist immigrants will not
suffice. Foreign immigration has already filled the
couÂ»}|ry with abundant material for their purpose.
Exclusion is well, but it is not enough. It must be
supplemented by expulsion or suppression of the reds
who are here. Of course they are an inappreciable
fraction of our population, but they are potential as
sassins, and the assassin is an intolerable member of
any community. Soon we will have the rancorous
voice of the American demagogue raised for that free
dom of speech and of the press which these murder
ers and their teachers abuse. But freedom of speech
and of the press applies only to advocacy of such
changes and reforms as may better government in
the opinion, of their advocates, and may obviously
preserve and not destroy it.
In Colorado many nests of anarchists have ap
- peared, and it is known that they have headquarters
.in this cijr and in Oakland- They insidiously teach
the worthlessncss of this Government, its failure to
secure justice to the people, its oppression of the
masses, and it is easy to see how directly in line with
their methods the reiterated utterances of Hearst's
papers have been.
In Chicago the police repdrt two thousand an
archists. In the small coal towpi of Spring Valley,
111., there is an anarchist newspaper, L'Aurore, which
broke out in expressions of joy at the murder of
President McKinley, and when the citizens threat
ened to suppress it nearly 500, anarchists among the
coal miners sprang to arms to- defend it .
In New York the followers of Herr Most run into
the thousands, and he is an object of constant solici
tude to the local government. He is now under ar
rest for articles published in his newspaper, though
the truth must be told that 'these articles are mild
compared to scores of editorials and cartoons which
have appeared in Hearst's New York Journal. If the
laws of that State take cognizance of what Most has
published it will seem like a miscarriage of justice if
they do not also cognize the incendiary and murder-
Inciting publications cf Hearst '
It is now known that the Paterson anarchists are
about five times as numerous as they were supposed
to be, and are regarded as so peculiarly venomous
that nearly every European Government maintains
secret service men among them to watch and warn
against their plots.
THE blaze of an assassin's pistol has lit up an
unexpected spectacle. Heretofore it has been
thought that the anarchist cult in this country
.was limited to a few who professed it in Paterson,
to a small ring led by Herr Most in New York, by
Isaak in Chicago and less than two hundred reds in
San Francisco. A popular error has been the iden
tification ofsocialists and anarchists as the same. The
people who have listened to the exposition of social
ism as a doctrine of peace and good order, propa
gating itself by opposition to war and bloodshed,
were led thereby to conceive a less horrible impres
sion of anarchy. This identification of the two
schools is entirely wrong. It is true that the hot
spirits in socialism may be moved by its often de
spairing conception of existing conditions to go on
into anarchy, but in justice to socialists it must be ad
mitted that they do not run a murderers' kindergar
ten. Out of all these mistakes and this feeling of
confidence the American people are suddenly awak
ened as by a fire bell in the night to discover that
anarchy has abused our liberal laws to propagate its
bloody doctrine until it has actually become a force
that must be reckoned with. Another feature in this
disclosure is that it hates a mild and liberal popular
Government like ours worse than it hates an autoc
racy like Russia, because our form tends to make
people contented with governmental institutions, and
all government is marked by anarchists for destruc
tion.
ANARCHY AN ISSUE.
Of course public sentiment in. any large commun
ity cannot be expected. to change suddenly. Time
is required for new ideas to. make their way into the
minds of large masses, of men and become suffi
ciently strong to dominate old ideas and cast them
out. This is- particularly true of an . agricultural
country like the South, where there is no great city
to form the center of new thoughts, and where the
people are widely scattered. We must therefore be
"satisfied with slow progress. In fact, when all things
are taken into consideration the progress is not slow.
In 'comparison with the tone of public sentiment a
few years ago the utterances of leading men now.-_on
the subject of lynching show something in the na
ture of a revolution in the popular mind.
A still more significant sign of the change 'that is
coming over the South is to be found in the reports
from Louisiana that a considerable number of the
better elements .of the white people in that 'State
would not feel disappointed should the Supreme
Court of the United States declare the so-called
'â¢grandfather clause" in the State constitution to be
null and' void. It is argued that should that clause
be set aside the law v.ould then apply to whites and
blacks alike and the electorate of the State would
be very much bettered
The Times does not stand alone â¢ in making the
.fight in Virginia, nor is it in that State only that the
opposition is strong. In fact, the revolt against the
exclusion plan adopted by the constitutional conven
tion in Alabama is about as strong in that State as is
the similar revolt in Virginia, â¢ The opponents of the
scheme are no longer "keeping quiet." They feel
themselves sufficiently numerous and influential to
make a fight, and while it is not likely they will be
successful, they will at least lay the foundation of a
party from which something in the way of redress
may be expected later on.
In Virginia, for example, the franchise plan de
vised for the exclusion of negroes has met with a
formidable opposition. The Richmond Times has
taken up the war against it and denounces it vigor
ously. In a recent issue it said: "We are utterly and
uncompromisingly opposed to any measure which
will create in this State a privileged class. â¢ We will
never consent to the proposition that a man has a
right to vote simply, arid solely on the score of his an
cestry.. That is the doctrine of aristocracy; and is as .
far from the doctrine of democracy as the North
is from the South. * * ? We are equally, -op
posed to the device known as the 'under
standing clause' of some of the Southern con
stitutions, for we believe that it is a device which, :if
adopted, will be used by tricky politicians to serve
their own purposes. We are unwilling to put it into
the power of a few election officers to determine who
shall be permitted to vote and who shall not be per
mitted to vote in the State of Virginia.. * * *
We have heard a great deal lately about anarchy.
But what is anarchy, after all, but defiance of the,
law? It may be contended that this law or ..that law
is a bad law, but so leng as it is the law of the land,
it must be respected. The fifteenth amendment of
the constitution of the United States, be it good or
bad, is a part of the organic law of this country, and
God grant that the people of Virginia may never defy
it or even evade it!"
The Call . has had occasion of late to repeatedly
direct attention to some forcible utterance on the
part of a man of influence in the South denouncing
lynch law and rousing public sentiment .against it.
We have now to note that there has also arisen in
the South a strong protest- against the exclusion of
negroes from the polls, and while it may not success
fully combat the schemes that have been devisedto
that end, it gives promise of eventually 'bringing
about some means- of alleviating the wrong, if not of
remedying' it altogether.
WHILE 'the conditions of- the Southern
States are still far short of what they should
be, and the tone of public sentiment is not
as much averse to the infliction of wrong upon the
negroes as is desirable, it is none the less evident
that a steady improvement is going on among the
Southern people both morally and materially, and it
is probable we have seen the climax of those lynch
ing outrages and unjust election laws which have so
stirred the indignation of the country. 1
THE IMPROVING SOUTH.
OUR COLONIAL TRADE.
REPORTS from the Treasury Bureau of Stat
istics show that our trade with Porto" Rico
and the Philippines is doing well There is a
continuing increase in our exports to those coun
tries that promises the realization of the most san
guine hopes of reasonable men concerning the fu
ture of our commerce with them. . From Hawaii the
Treasury no longer obtains official statistics of trade
with this country, so that the exact condition of trade
with those islands is not known. With .the Cubans
our export trade has diminished, while our imports
have increased.
A summary of. the Treasury' bulletin on the subject
says: Our domestic exports- to Porto Rico in the
seven months ending with July, 1901; were $4,399,326,
against $3,107,248 in. the corresponding months of
last year, an increase of 40 per cent.'. To the Philip
pines our domestic export's in -the seven months-end
ing with July, 1901, were $2,023,137, against $1,592,
030 in the corresponding months of 1900, -an increase
of over 25 per cent. To Cuba our domestic exports
in the: seven months ending with July, I9oi v .were
$13,821,751, against $i4,8;o;94o in the same months of
1900, a decrease of 7 per cent. Our imports from
Cuba .in the same period of 1.901. were $36,829,630,
against $24,767,654 in the corresponding months of
last year, an increase in imports of about 50 per cent.
From Portb Rico our imports in the seven months
ending with July, 1901,. were $5,111,903, against
$3,084,018 in the corresponding period of 1900, an in
crease of 65 per cent.
Concerning the Hawaiian trade the report says:
"No definite statistics from our own reports can be
had, owing to the fact that the shippers refuse to give
information regarding their commerce with the Ha
waiian Islands, which are now" a customs district of
the United States, and therefore not subject to the
law which requires statements of exports, to and im
ports from foreign countries to be furnished to the
Bureau of Statistics. The Collector at Hawaii, how
ever, reports the exports from the Hawaiian Islands
to the United States in the seven months ending with
July, ioor, at $19,526,447, indicating that the imports
into the United States from the Hawaiian Islands for
the calendar year will be materially in excess />f .for
mer years; while the Collector also estimated that
the exports from the United States received into the
Hawaiian Islands in the fiscal year just ended amount
to about $20,000,000, an increase of about 50 per cent
over the preceding year." . â¢ , x
It will be seen that the development of commerce
with the various islands is going briskly on. Some
of our export trade to the Philippines and to Porto
Rico is of course due to the presence of the army,
which constitutes a demand for American goods.
That demand, however, will serve to introduce our
products to the natives, and in the end. the trade will
be materially increased with the whole population.
The fad for advertisements among American cities
appears to be at its height. The veracious citizens of
Denver ask us to believe that seven -mountains sur
rounding a mining camp fifty miles from the tpwn are.
all ablaze and that a volunteer army has started out
to subdue the flames. The next we may expect to
hear from Denver is that the blazing hills are the
seven modern wonders of the world.
A Massachusetts mob that went to' the residence
of Richard Olney. for the purpose of attacking his
coachman cheered themselves on the way by singing
"Nearer, My God, to Thee." It is only in Massa
chusetts that they know how to violate law in the
name of religion, but they can do.it there so well
that' the* casual observer can hardly tell a lynching,
party from a prayer, meeting. â¢
. A clique of ambitious young men of New York
have organized a political society which is to.O be
known as the Order of Acorns, whose professed"pur
pose is to protest against the influence or interfer
ence of policemen in the affairs of the public gener
ally. This society might find no difficulty in secur
ing recruits among certain classes of people not very
far from this city. .
A New York woman is said to . have been driven
insane from riding on the Coney Island "loop -the
loop.!' Perhaps if the examining physicians were
more critical in their investigation they might have
decided that the unfortunate lady was insane before
she went on the machine. _ :^
Senator Wellington df Maryland ha3 made the
poorest use of his opportunities in office of any man
in American history. Even Pettigrew made a better
record for himself, and the only. decent thing that
Wellington can v do now is to resign and let people

The Nationalists of Spain have sent a message of
congratulation to President Roosetfelt and assured
him as the defender of oppressed , people of their
kindest regards. This probably may be accepted as
the latest example of the retort courteous:
It is announced that the control of the foreign af
fairs of China has been taken out of the hands', of the
Tsung-li-Yamen and placed in those of the Wai-Wu-

The declarations of the commercial organizations were in line and in sympathy,
with other declarations made by business organizations, .fraternal societies, social clubs,
churches, libraries, literary societies and universities: From all parts of the Union come
reports of bodies of that kind formally condemning, Hearst for his responsibility in pro
moting anarchy in vhis country and excluding his papers from their rooms. Individuals
of course have been even more prompt and emphatic than associations and organized
bodies. From home after home the . Examiner has been excluded in this city. Thus
business men denounce it, the clubs scorn it, the family rejects it, the church condemns
it, libraries repudiate it, universities expel it and the public puts it beyond the pale of tol
eration. It has become the object of a well-nigh universal detestation, and the Journal
has suffered the same fate in New York and the American in Chicago.
ACTION taken, by the various commercial oi cranizations of the city with reference
to the Examiner gives a further refutation to the whining charge of Hearst that
his papers are being assailed by business rivals and by incapable journalists. It
is a further attestation of the truth that the denunciation of v his papers arises
from a widespread and deeply rooted indignation on the part of the public; that it is the
stern judgment of American intelligence and American patriotism,' stirred by the: Ameri
can conscience to condemn, to denounce and to crush. out. utterly a" viperous journalism
that should never have been tolerated at any time. â¢ . â¢ ./

TWO PROMINENT EPISCOPA
LIANS WHO WILL ATTEND
THE CONVENT! DN.
THE advance guard of the delegates
to thd forthcoming Episcopal
Church Convention arrived in the
city last night shortly before mld-r
night, the overland train being five
hours late.
The work of receiving the delegates to
the convention will begin In earnest ' to
day. According to advices received by
the officials of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company more than 1000 delegates
passed through Ogden yesterday and are
due to reach San Francisco to-day.
In addition to the clerical and lay dele
gates it is expected that a number of their
friends will also Journey to this city, and/
the .gathering of the members of the
Episcopal church will undoubtedly be a
memorablt one in every respect.
The bishops of the Episcopal Church are!
expected to arrive, here in the course of
the next few 'days, >Â«i special train being
used, to carry the distinguished prelates.
Among the lay delegates appointed from
New York City is J. Pierpont Morgan,
the millionaire, who will probably reach
this city In his private car.
The delegates . who arrived last night
wece met at the ferry depot by Samuel
C. Barclay, a member of the Brotherhood
of St. Andrew, who was selected to wel
come the belated travelers.
Conflict Over Ritualism.
The great conflict at 'the coming Epis
copal convention, the result of which is
likely to convulse the church from one
end of the United States to the other, will
be over the question of ritualism.
There is a large element in the church
that objects to anything that is "new" or
the revival of certain ornate ceremonials
which -were common to the English
church in the time of Edward VI, but are
not, in the opinion of worshipers in tho
"low" church, to be sanctioned for the
reason of their close resemblance to those
of the Roman Catholic ritual. The ritual
ists in the. Episcopal church are a grow
ing and aggressive element, and Bishop
Grafton of the Fond du Lac diocese is
their representative and exponent.
Around him the great .battle of ritual
ism in tho church will be fought.
At the recent consecration of a coad
jutor to his diocese the ceremonial was
elaborated' to a degree that amazed tho
whole church and remonstrances flowed
in from every direction. The metropoli
tan of the American church. Dr. Clark of
Rhode Island, thundered his 'displeasure,
and the Bishops who assisted at the con
secration were denounced as disloyal and
as introducers of strange doctrines. Upon
this . foundation the conflict to be waged
is based and a great forensic debate is as
sured. ' â¢ â¢ .
Well equipped with oratorical ability to
defend the advanced side of the question,
the Right Rev. .Charles Chapman Grafton
will . concentrate the attention of the
church as long as the debate may last.
He' is a graduate of; Harvard and before
taking orders was a lawyer. Though his
own Massachusetts diocese is the "low
est" of the "low," Bishop Grafton es
poused the ritualistic idea and in his time
was regarded as the exponent of the very
"highest" element In his. church. In 1865
he joined the "Cowley Fathers," an order
of English monks, and returned to Bos-

the Pacific system, loft Wednesday for
New York. It Is claimed ho is going
East v in an attempt to secure rein
statement In- the Southern Pacific.
It was rumort'd when Flllmore was
retired that ' ho would receive a
pension.' This is not generally con
reded, however, as . Harrlman was
never known to throw any money away
on pensions. In New York Flllmore has
a strong friend in John Mackay and on
his arrival he is sure to receive, a warm
welcome from this millionaire. Amontr
the old railroad officials It Is said that
Fillmore will return with elthor a com
mission for his old post or a position
equal to it. ' : ' ' ;
It. H. Ingram will -continue in the ser
vice of Xho Southern Pacific Company un
til a new president is appointed. He will
wait to seo if his services will bo re
quired.
Secretary In cram also' said that Mr.
Hays would not stnte whether H. E.
Fltshugh .would continue In tho service
of the company. Mr. .FlUhugh will be
hero in a few days and It is expected 'ho
will tender his resignation upon his ar
rival.
In answer to the Query whether there
was any truth in the report that Mr.
Hays will accept the , position of presi
dent of the Boston and Maine system
Becretary Ingram said that Mr. Haya
would not either deny or affirm tho ru
mor.
On top of President Hays' resignation
comes the information that H. E. Hunt
ington will arrive from New York in this
city next Monday. Old railroad officials
claim that it Is more than possible that
H. E. Huntington will be the next presi
dent. Mrs. H. E. Huntington sails on
October 8 from Europe for New York.
On her arrival at the Gotham, city she
will journey direct to this city and make
this her permanent home.
I have no definite plans as yet, but expect to
remain some weeks enjoying the country with
my family at Menlb Park, and will probably
go East some time early in December.
The chance In policy and organizational. the
company, consequent upon the change In own
ership of the control of the Southern Pacific
shortly after my taking service with, the com
pany, hss made a place originally attractive to
mo so much less so that I several weeks ago
voluntarily placed my resignation and surren
der of my contract with the company at the
disposal of the executive committee, effective

. Dunphy was then placed In a cell, and
after â¢ Stanton died waa booked on a
charge cf murder.
Though .Stanton was unconscious, the
object of the police In bringing: his slayer
to him was attained. As soon as he saw
the dying man-Dunphy exclaimed with an
air of bravado. "Yes, that's the â¢ I
wanted to shoot, and I'm, glad I got
him." Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
While. Stanton was dying the police
brought Dunphy into the hospital that his
victim might identify him. .;,
The dying man was taken to the- Emer
gency Hospital, where he expired in a
few minutes after arrival. T%o of his
wounds were necessarily fatal. Ope hav
ing entered above the right lip, passed
through the upper jaw and ranged back
ward and downward toward the base of
the skull. Another bullet entered the
left side of the head above the ear and
also found lodgment at the base of the
skull. The remaining bullets were fired
into Stanton's breast.
Stanton was on his way home when, ac
cording to the statements of eyo wit
nesses, he was met by Duijphy and delib
erately shot down without the slightest
warning. The affair created intense ex
citement, and in a few moments the street
was packed. Officers Sylvester, Murphy
anjl Connor soon appeared on the scene
and succeeded in tracing Dunphy to his
hiding place in the rear of a saloon. He
was armed, and Officer Sylvester, fearing
trouble," flred a shot in close proximity
to Dunphy's head. Dunphy held his.revol
ver v handle outward and . shouted that he
would surrender. He was soon deprived
of his weapons and handcuffed. He was
very voluble and expressed satisfaction at
his deed. . - ; < ijf

On tho prisoner's person was found a
memorandum book in which tho follow
ing was written:
Dunphy Makes His Will.
in ono part of his statement to- the po
lice, Dunphy says ho shot Stanton because
the latter betrayed his Bister and. In an
other, becauBQ no bolleved his life to be
In danger.
Dunphy Is -a- well-appearing man of
about twenty-five years and son of Rich
ard Dunphy, a well-known armless pen-
Bloncr living at Vallejo. He was cm
ployed for years In tho navy and recently
returned from a voyage. On his arrival,
ho claims, hltr sister told him of Stanton's
porlldy. Her story rendered 'him furious
'and he determined that Stanton should
do her justice or suffer tho consequences.
J lo came to thin city a week ago and had
several conversations with Stanton, but
the hitter only treated him with scorn.
Night heforo last Dunphy confronted
Htunton on Natoma street and had trouble
with him. Dunphy Bays Stanton was theii
in the company of Beverai men and that
all wtro armed. Dunphy had no weapon
with him and was obliged to leave with
out effecting an understanding.
I-iast night, Dunphy claims, ho was play
hiK cards In Fay Bros.' saloon at Minna
and Mary streets, when Stanton entered.
The last named called Dunphy outside
and made a remark about "taking his
roof off," at tliu samo.tlmo reaching his
hand toward his hip pocket. Dunphy says
he then pulled two pistols with which ho
had armed lilmw-lf and lired seven shots.
Bunphy's Story of the Trouble.
Stanton came from Vallejo with his
young wife two weeks ago and the couplo
engaged housekeeping rooms at the num
ber given. The pair were married some
four weeks ago, the bride being Miss Eva
liryant, daugnter of a flreman in the navy
yard at Mare Island. Stanton was a mem
ber of Company 1*, First Culifornla Reg
iment, and for tho greater part of the
time since his return from tho Philippines
lived at Vallejo, \vhÂ«ru ho was very popu
lar. He sang in tho church choir and
was a member of a local dramatic club.
That he was friendly with Miss Dunphy
was well known, but that ho was respon
sible for her downfall his relatives here
deny. On arriving in this city Stanton
accepted a position with Joseph Bishop*
a chlmney-swoep.at 340 Minna street.
. Not content with Bhooting his victim
twice in the head Dunphy stood over the
prostrate form of the then dying man
and in quick succession sent live more
bullets into his body. The murderer then
made a break for liberty, dashed into the
door of Fay Brothers' saloon and out
into the rear yard, where ho was captured
llftecn minutes later in an outhouse by
the police.
Dunphy charges that Stanton was in
timate with his 6ister and that he refused
to marry her. Dunphy came to this city
from Vallejo a few days ago to talk the
matter over with Stanton. lie claims that
Stanton threatened him with violence and
that friends informed him that Stanton
meant to do him an injury. He there
upon armed himself and when ho met
Stanton, Just before the tragedy, Dun
nhy claims Stanton made a motion for
his pocket, as though to draw a weapon,
whereupon Dunphy lired and Stanton fell
dead. . <
Edward D. Stanton, who lived with his
bride of one month at 123% Sixth street,
was shot and killed by James W. Dunphy
on tho sidewalk in front .of 426 Minna
streot at 6 o'clock lost night. The mur
der was an unusually ferocious one and
was admittodly premeditated by the as
eassln, * because, he suys, Stanton be
truyed his sixteen-year-old sister.

Democratic Convention.
' Onco tho Governor changed his hotel
programmo and went to the Occidental,
a caravansary conducted by a major. If
General Wartleld had cared for hotel pat
ronnge, he could have made tho platform
no eulogistic of the Stato administration
that tho Governor, in a common spirit of
reciprocity, would have been impelled to
mifwiBt a ntaff banquet at the California,
but tho general wnn not actuated by sor
did motives. Ho elthor forgot the.exist
ence of Governor Gago, or else made up
hlH mind that tho Governor should apply
for indorsement of the State administra
tion to Colonel Klrkpatrick of tho Palaco,
or Major Hooper of tho Occidental. Speak
ing of hoti-lH In connection with political
nffalrs. tho Incident in recalled that Colo
nel Klrkpatrick declined tho Republican
nomination for Mayor, and Major Hooper
was constrained to decline a Democratlo
Indorsement for the same office. General
Warfleld has not yet -declined nomination
â¢for Muyor, but it may appear in tho rec
ords that ho declined to* mention Gage In
the platform.

publican fold that an indorsement of the
(lag* administration will add strength to
tho ticket and promote harmony In the
party, a resolution of indorsement should
be vubmitted. The Call does not ask a
vote of. thanks for reminding the conven
tnn that the State administration Is sup
posed to be Rcoubllcan.
Hotels Flay Fart 'in Folitics.
Politicians in and out of the convention
are wondering why the committee on
resolutions gave Governor Gage the over
look. The Republican national adminis
tration was highly commended 'in the
resolutions reported by General R. H.
"Warfleld's committee, but not a Word was
said In reference to the administration of
State affairs. Thomas D. Rlordan, chair
man of the convention, says the neglect
to mention Governor Gage was not in
tentional, but was really an oversight. la
It possible that every one of the eighteen
members of the committee on platform
forgot that the State administration is
Republican? Was there no one to think
or Gagre in all the eighteen? When the
truth is revealed the Ignoring of the Gov
ernor may be accounted for. General
Warfleld, who is chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, Is also brigadier
general In the National Guard and the
proprietor of the California Hotel, yet
when Governor Gage comes to town he
goes to a hotel conducted by a Harbor
Commissioner, who holds no higher rank
than colonel.
Governor Gage Was Overlooked.
Delegates representing the Forty-third
District are encouraged to press the can
didacy of C. A. Murdock: Assurances of
support from other delegations were given
yesterday. Representative men 01 the
city, who are not members of : the con
vention, have strongly indorsed Mr. Mur
dock. Â» "? . â¢
It Is Btlll an open question whether
Burns and Herrln will force the nomina
tion of Asa R. Wells for Mayor or bring
forward some other aspirant. The rail
road forces and the independents who
are willing to combine with the strongest
faction are able to control the conven
tion, but the managers of the combine are
not Quito convinced of Wells' ability to
win out at the. general election. There is
some indication of a change In the pro
gramme. Colonel Gcorgo Stone and
Thomas V. Cator are spoken of as avail
ablcs.

preparation that kills tho germ that
makes dandruff or icurf by digging Intb
the scalp to get at tho root of the hair,

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Sept, S7.-The Boston Commercial
Bulletin will, say in to-morrow's report on the
wool trade of the United States: â¢. Â¦
Wool dealers report a quiet market, with the
demand for small lots. All 'these sell at full
previous prices, but there- has been no advance.
American 'markets had discounted the London
advance. The situation, however, . is strength
ened by hardening tendency abroad, which
indicates that the repression both on the Con
tinent and in 'the United Kingdom has c6me
to an end.. There is no pressure from manu
facturers for the passage of 'Â¦ a 'reciprocity
treaty reducing wool duties, ami- it is not be
lieved that one will be passed.
. The receipts of wool in Doston since ! Janu
ary 1 have been 216,S25,008 pounds, against 140 -
138.715 pounds for the same period in 1900. 1 The
Boston shipments to date are 190,636,492 pounds
against sales of 105,296,000 pounds for the same
period in 1900. The stock on hand in Boston
January 1, J1901, , was 76,309,500 pounds. â¢ The
total stock to-day is 102,525,063 pounds. Â¦ ' Â¦ .

NEW TORK; Sept. . 27.â While tin in London

that metal met with the reverse. --Neither was
of significant . importance, however, ' as the

NEW TTOniC STOCK LIST.
JJEW TORK, Sept. 27.â Professional opera
tors la stocks had the market pretty much
to themselves to-day, but they found various
matters of encouragement- . The discourage
ment of the bears, with all the bad news in
eight disposed of, was correspondingly great,
and their buying to cover their shorts was an
Important influence. The uncertain fluctua
tions of the copper stocks In the early deal-
Ings kept the market unsettled, but the pres
sure of liquidation ia them, as elsewhere in the
market, was materially lightened ,and they
shared in the late general Improvement of the
market. A Bharp rally in the price of spot
copper in London had an Important bearjng,
not .only on the status of these stocks in the
Speculative market, but on the copper trade
outlook. It was reported that the Amalga
mated Copper Company was supporting the
epot copper market in London. Whatever the
cause of the rally, yesterday's contention that
'copper could be imported at a profit was dis
posed of, and the ftar that the Amalgamated
Company would h&ve to cut the price' of ltÂ»
product was lew acute. The utock nold tx
dividend and more than recovered It. and
cloned with a. net s*ln of only 114. ThÂ« recent
iiotflbie buying ot the Vanderbllu was re

NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â Eradstreet's to-mpr-i
row will say: The current of trade is still run
ning full ,ln nearly all lines and in some the
tide is still rising, as shown by a- firmer tone
or actual advances in the level of prices, ex
cept for those staples,' such as cereals, hogs
products and cotton, which are dealt in on the
exchanges. In distributive trade the features
are the continued good tone of advices from the
jobbing, trade West, â¢ Northwest and South
we&t. and on the Pacific Coast, and the better
retail trade reported at the East, due to the
advanced season. The talk of the widespread
corn damage, due to late frosts, seems to have
fallen flat, viewed from tho standpoint of corn
prices and of trade reports from affected sec
tions.

Itlishaps of the Thomas.
The California Ship Company's J. B.
Thomas is In trouble again. This vessel,
when purchased by the San Francisco
concern, was on her way to Australia.
She made her port of destination without
accident and then went to Newcastle, N.
S. W.. to load a carge of coal for her new
owners. She was destined for Acapulco
and Central America, but was caught
in a terrific storm rear the equator and
was compelled to run to Honolulu in dis
tress. During the hurricane all the yards
on the main and the fore ami the r--â Â»'
mizzen masts were carried away. ThÂ«
captain was washed ovcrouurd Â¦ aÂ».a
drowned and the two mates. were so badly
injured that they could not leave their
rooms. The oargo shifted. Everything
movable on deck went by the. board and
part of the port bulwarks went along
with it. The boatswain had to take
charge of the ship and when he found
that there was three feet of -water in the
hold he decided to run for Honolulu. He
reached the island of Oahu without fur
ther mishap, but had barely tied up at
the wharf before he discovered that the
ship's cargo of coal was heated. An ex
amination showed that the vessel would
have to be discharged. This was done.
After the J. B. Thomas had been repaired
she started for Puget Sound. Arriving
there without iurther accident 6he loaded
at Tacoma for San Francisco and .was
apparently seven days out for this port
when news came last night that she had
put back Into Ncah Bay in distress.

The property owners on Pacific avenue,

had been riding along the main drive of
Golden Gate Park, near the ocean beach,
and was in the shadowy part of the road,
when Charles Oscar of 1806 McAllister
street, who was riding in an oposite di
rection, crashed into him. Both men fell
heavily and were badly bruised. Oscar's
Injuries consisted mainly of lacerations of
the face, but Bolger's were more severe,
particularly about the head. It was
deemed advisable to keep Bolger at the
Central Emergency Hospital for the night
that the full extent of his injuries might
be ascertained.

The Rev. Thomas J. Shahan, the learned
and eloquent professor of history of the
Catholic University of America at Wash
ington, D. C'., delivered the last of his
series of instructive lectures at Metro
politan Temple last night. The lecture,
which was given under the auspices of
the Catholic Truth Society, was well at
tended, seats in the main body of the, hall
being at a premium. Father Shahan s
subject was "The Renaissance, Christian
and Pagan." The discourse lasted several
hours, much to the delight of the listen
ers." It was mainly a historical discussion
showing that the Catholic church encour
aged art, literature and educational prog
ress in general during the period of the
Renaissance; and that it did not. as is
contended by many historians, oppose the
advancement of the human race during
this period. t - ,
Father Shahan will be tendered a recep
tion at the Temple to-night. Archbishop
Riordan will preside and make a short ad
dress before leaving for the East.
A ball and banquet will be idven this
evening at Native Sons' Hall, 414 Mason
etreet. In honor of A. K. Coney, Consul
General of Mexico at this port, and also
In honor of the birthday of President
Diaz of Mexico.

Occidental's Anniversary.
OMAHA, Sept. 27.â President Charles
S. Mellen of the Northern Pacinc, accom
panied by W. G. Pearce, assistant to the
president, and A. Lovell, superintendent of
motive power, was at Union Pacinc head
quarters to-day conferring with President
Hurt. Judge W. D. Cornish of New York,
vice president <>f the Union Pacific, Ore
gon Short Line and the Chicago and Al
ton was also a party to the conference.
It Is understood that the matter under
consideration is the use of the Northern
Pacific tracks from Portland to Seattle by
the Union Pacific. For several years the
Union Pacific has run trains through to
Portland over the proprietary lines, the
Oregon Short Line and the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company and the
present conference has to do with a new
traffic arrangement for the Union Pa
cific's Portland business, that road hav
ing abandoned, it is said, the project of
building its own Seattle-Portland line.
; Dr. A- K. Happersberger does not want
to leave his muscular wife after all. He
secured a dismissal yesterday of the pro
ceedings he instituted apainst her. When
the complaint was filed it alleeed that
Mrs. Happersberger was in the habit of
hurling all sorts of household furniture
at her husband to his great physical in
jury. It also alleged that the lady was
guilty of numerous other intemperate
acts. The doctor even went so far as
to ask for an order restraining his wife
from viEitog his office at 41 Third street.
The sudden ending of the suit came in
the nature of a surprise to Judge Seawell,
who consented to the dismissal.

Then the defendant was placed on the
stand. He denied point blank that he
had forced the name of Colonel Coxe to
the certificate of deposit and said that
after Cranson had given him the $460 to
deposit for him he had given it to the
lirst sergeant to deposit with the pay
master. He explained that he had over
looked making an entry of the transac
tion in his report by saying that he had
a great many different and important
things to look after at the time and that
it had slipped his memory.

Miss Chamberlain showed a sufficient

Thomas H. Rush created a disturbance
at O'Farrell and Larkin streets last night
and threatened to kill everybody in sight.
He had been drinking heavily during the
night and demanded more . liquor at
Gentz's saloon at the corner. When he
was refused he drew a knife and drove
everybody, out of the place. .
Police Officer George Brown passed the
place and, hearing the disturbance, went
in and placed Rush, who had put his
weapon away, under arrest. Brown took
his prisoner to the patrol box on the cor
ner and was about to ring in for the
wagon when Rush again drew his knife
and made a pass at Brown. The latter
grabbed him, but Rush cut Brown s left
hand before he could subdue his assailant.
Rush was taken to the City Prison,
where he was charged with assault to
commit murder. Officer Brown had his
hand dressed at the Central Emergency
Hospital. Last Monday Rush was re
leased from the County Jail, where he had
served. a sentence of three months for
threats against life.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
| NEW YORK, Sept. 27.â One of the most
luxurious private trains that has ever
been sent across the continent left the
Grand Central station at thirty-five min
utes after 8 o'clock this morning bearing"
J. Pierpont Morgan and a party of his
guests, composed of clerical and lay dele
gates and their wives to the Con
vention of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, which opens In San Francisco
next Wednesday.
. Morgan is himself a delegate to the
convention. The train was run as the
second section of the Empire State ex
press and left five minutes later than that
train. It was due to arrive in Buffalo
at 5:50 to-night. From there it will go
by the Lake Shore to Chicago. The train
was made up of six cars. . Everything
that could add to the comfort of tile
guests who were on board was supplied,
not omitting three chefs, who served on
the train which carried President Mc-
Kinley and his party on their western
tour in summer. These cooks were bor
rowed from the Pennsylvania railroad
for the occasion.
Precedlng the dining car as the train
waa made up were the baggage and
library car, the Atlanta and the
Petruchio, and a regular sleeping car.
Morgan's own private car, the Columbia,
was next after the dining car. It con
tains both bed and sitting-room compart
ments furnished in green and upholstered
in leather and plush. The fifth car is the
Genesta, . containing sleeping compart
ments and a small sitting-room, and the
sixth,. the AJroy, is the drawing-room car.
This car is furnished in green plush and
opens in the rear on a broad observation
platform encased in glass and furnished
with comfortable chairs and couches.
Among those in the party were the Rev.
Dr. Greer, the Rev. Dr. Parks and the
Rev. Dr. Eugene A. Hoffman. There
were about thirty persons in all on the
train. Bishop Potter and the Rev. X>r.
Huntington were not on board, as they
had preceded the train to San Francisco.
It is said that both of them will be
guests of Mr. Morgan in San Franc'.sco.
where he will entertain a large party at
the Crocker house, which he has taken
for his residence during the convention.
To this house, which is a famous man
sion on Nob Hill, Morgan sent last week
a retinue of cooks, butlers and other em
ployes to make preparations for his hos
pitality. _

LATE SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
ITew Wluitcoin Officers Are Search-
ing for the Body of Louis
CORPSE STOLEN FROM
UNDERTAKING BOOM
Satterthwaite.
NEW WHATCOM, Wash., Sept. 27.â
The body of Louis Satterthwaite was this
afternoon stolen from the undertaking
room where it had been prepared for
burial. Two weeks ago Satterthwaite was
crushed by a falling tree. He was placed
under the care of "Divine Healer" Suther
land. Just before his death last Wednes
day a. regular practitioner was summoned,
but death preceded his arrival. The Cor
oner notified * the undertaker having
charge of the body to hold it until an
examination could be made.
This afternoon 'the "divine healer" and
Mra. Satterthwaite called with -their at
torney and demanded the body. The un
dertaker refused to deliver it and went
out to consult his attorney. During his
absence the body was taken away by the
"divine healer" and Satterthwaite's wife.
Officers have bo far been unable to locate
the stolen corpse.
Let a woman have her will and she'll
give herself away.
Within the next two weeks the Pacific
Coast Oil Company will begin laying a
pipe line between the Kern River oil fields
and Point Richmond. This gigantic un
dertaking has been under consideration
for the past year and now that the plan
is perfected steps will be taken immedi
ately to complete the work. Nearly
54,000,000 will be expended on the work and
many thousand men will be employed.
The Pacific Oil Company is allied with
the Standard Oil Company. The proposed
line will be laid from Bakersfleld to Point
Richmond. Ten or eleven pumping sta
tions will be built along the route.
H. C. Breeden, treasurer of the Pacific
Coast Oil Company, and general manager
of the Standard Oil Company, stated last
evening that the pipe line was a certainty.
He was disinclined to discuss the matter,
but admitted that a great deal of the ma
terial to be used in building the line had
been secured and that work would begin
at once. He said that the oil producers
and consumers would be materially bene
fited by the line as it would bring them
closer together.
"I really cannot tell you when the work
will be completed," he said, "but It will
be rapidly pushed to completion. The line
will extend from the oil belt to tidewater.
At present I arn unable to say that Point
Richmond will be the terminus. The
building of the line is not due to high
freight rates, but is simply intended to
develop the oil Industry in this State.
LONDON, Sept. 27.â The Pall Mall Ga
zette this afternoon confirms the rumor :
published by the Dally News to-day of
differences between Lord Kitchener anÂ«l
War Secretary Brodrlck, and adds that as
a result Brodrick has had a long inter
view with the King. The Pall Mall Ga
zette declares it is in a position to say
that Lord Kitchener is dissatisfied with
the partial enforcement of martial law in
South Africa, wanting it proclaimed nt
Cape Town and elsewhere. He also de
slres more serious penalties for rebellion
and better reinforcements. Lord Kitch
ener took over the command with the ex
plicit understanding that his hands were
not to be tied, but as this condition was
not carried out, "he is seriously reconsid
ering his position."
A long list of honors and promotions
conferred for service in South Africa wsre
printed by the Gazette to-night. Major
Burnham, the American scout, who was
on the staff of Lord Roberts, gets a cham
pionship of the Distinguished Service Ol
der; Lady Sarah Wilson is decorated with
the Royal Red Cross, Colonel Cartwright
of the -Canadian Corps becomes a com
panion of the Order ef St. Michael and St..
George and half a dozen other Canadians
receive the championship of the Distin
guished Service Order, including Molloy,
the blind trooper.
The train was running about thirty
miles an hour when the accident hap
pened. All the cars were badly damaged,
and there were several narrow escapes.
When Mr. Addy was taken out it was
from under a large car truck which had
been Jammed in beside him, just missing'
his head. The little daughter of A. H.
"Wilson was sleeping in a coat rack and
was thrown across the car. The wreck is
thought to have been due to spreading of
the rails.
A ecore of others were more or less in
jured, some having gashes made by glass
and broken seats. Most of the injured
â¢were taken to farmhouses until relief
could arrive and later removed to hospi
tals here and at Council Bluffs.
Mrs. Addy received .a scalp wound which re
quired several etltche* and had a narrow es
cap* from death.

There is a point between twelve and fif-

much resembles the milder and more ex-
pensive grades of Java coffee is produced.
A lady in Salem, Or. % says: "When-

passed a restless, wakeful night. Extreme
nervousness and ! a weak stomach have
followed me ever since I have been using

that my dyspepsia took the form of
epafms and heart weakness.
"I suffered intensely, and when a physi-
cian was called he Inquired, among other
things. 5f I drank coffee, and insisted that
I leave it off. I did so and took up tea.

Joseph Schaack. aged seven years, re

street side of Telegraph Hill last Thurs
day afternoon and received Injuries. which
caused his death a few hours later.
At the time the accident occurred the
boy's father was' visiting friends ln the
vicinity and young Schaack went oh the
hill with several other boys to chase
grasshoppers. He was missed by his com
panions about 4 o'clock, but they thought
nothing of it. When Joseph's father waa
ready to return home and -could not find
the child he organized a search. At half
past 8 o'clock at nightâ four hours after
the boy was missedâ the distracted fath
er's attention was drawn to a plaee at the
foot of a bluff forty feet high by the
sound of moans. Here he found his son
bleeding and almost unconscious.
The boy was removed to the Paclrtc
Hospital, where he died. An autopsy

by the fall and that the right lung had
been punctured by one end of a broken

was npproacned from behind by a num

A. S. Cronk, a member of the Brother
hood of Teamsters, was assaulted shortly
after 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon by a
gang of strikers near the corner of Fourth
and Brannan streets. Cronk went on
strike when called out by the Brotherhood
of Teamsters In July. He remained loyal
to Its cause, but perceiving that day by
day the positions which previous to the
strike had been filled by members of the
Brotherhood of Teamsters were being
taken by strangers and foreseeing that if
the strike was continued much longer
there would be no places for the strikers
to return to he considered it his duty to
warn his fellow members of the brother
hood.
STRIKERS BEAT UNION MAN.
When Mrs. Gustafson was finally al
lowed to regain her feet she procured a
revolver from an adjoining room and at
tempted to frighten her assailants away
The strikers forcibly wrested the weapon
from her grasp, and in so doing twisted
her-fingers to such an extent that they
were almost broken. After securing the
revolver they twisted the woman's wrist
and squeezed her fingers together until
she screamed with pain. Her screams
brought several men to her assistance
and the two assaulters fled. Later In thu
day Mrs. Gustafson swore to warrants
for the arrest of both men, charging them
with battery. â¢
Mrs. Gustafson bravely refused, where
upon the strikers threw her to the floor
and proceeded to sit upon her chest, slap
her face and otherwise insult and injure
her.
Mrs. Gustafson claims that Fred Crelgh
ton, who resides at 62 Tehama street, and
an unknown man visited her home and
accused her of harboring non-union men
in her house. She denied the assertion
and the two men then demanded that two
laborers in her house who are employed
at the Dundon Iron Works be turned out
to be dealt with by a gang of strikers
who were outside the door.
, Mrs. Lena Gustafson, who is the pro
prietor, of a small grocery store at 316

claims that he was not one of the at
tacking party, but that ' he was going
quietly to* his work. Ills wound, though
painful, Is superficial, the bullet having
entered the right thigh and ranging
downward lodged near the knee.
The attack was made on Special Officer
Castleton, but the shooting wan done by
Special Officer lienry Jlusscy, who Is em
â¢ ployed In guarding the SujtBon-Renner
idravug-e Company's nun-union teamsters.
At the time of the assault, Coatleton.-who
!Â¦ employed at the Overland ' Freight
Transfer Company's stables, was escort
ing a non-union teamster to work. When
the officer and his charge reached the cor
.ner of Fourth and Folsom streets' they
were Intercepted by a gang of about nine
strikers. They were told that If they did
not Immediately consent to desert their
positions they would suffer for it. While
attempting to escape from the strikers.
Castleton was struck to the ground.
The officer's assailants commenced to
beat him .brutally about the head. At
this stage of the proceeding a dray from
the Btetson-Renner Company's" stables in
charge of Special Offlcer Hussey arrived
on the scene. Hussey, who bears a repu
tation for bravery and fearlessness in the
discharge of his duty, immediately on ob
serving Castleton's plight demanded that
the strikers desist from their assault. In-
Btead of complying:, a number of the
strikers dropped Castleton and ran
toward the truck on which Hussey was
seated and began to clamber up to attack
him. â¢ 'â¢ .
ATC assault made by a gane of
strikers on Special Offlcer Wal
ter E. Castleton early yesterday
morning at the corner of Fourth
and Folsom streets resulted in a
shooting affray which may possibly prove
fatal for Herman Kamalade, one 'of the
awsaultlns strikers. The bullet entered
hlÂ» body at the point of the right shoul
der and lodged near the spinal column In
euch a position that the doctors at the
Receiving Hoepltal deem It hazardous to
attempt a removal.
Bullet Strikes Herman Kamalade Near the Spinal Column and His Injury^ May Prove Fatal.
