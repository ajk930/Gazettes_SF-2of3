The amateur captain put the boat In
â¢winirr qvartcrs and went to studying
books on navigation, and reminiscencing
about the time, to be counted by hours,
that he had srent on the water when a
lad. Then when the summer rolled
around again the sturdy little sea-tosssr
âa boat of S3 tons and 73 feet in length
âsailed for the Klcmath River on July
22. 1901, to dredge for gold, and, as It
turned out, to have four months of wind
and sea, of storm and calm, and to re
turn to the Golden Gate without having
entered the Klamath and with two men
to whom the sea has been kind In send
ing them back alive. For the Cordelia
Keald had her way. drifted when she
pleased, and sailed when the wind was
so that, she could not help it. Now she
is kicking up her heels over in Oakland
Creek and wondering If next spring,
when she again will combat the change

will have a master who is sÂ«3 reminiscent
of his farmer life as to tell her to "lay
to" when he means for her to "go
ahead."
It is bad enough to be a captain, but it
is worse to be the first and second mate,
the pilot, the cook and the crew; all
hands rolled into one man, and a rather
small man, too. A. A. Platt, formerly a
fruit grower near Los Angeles, has filled
all these berths at once on the Cordelia

craft Is the finest sea boat afloat, except
that "she can't sail and she won't steer."
He had to work sixteen hours a day,
and It was a "heave ho" sort of time â with
him at first, for the eea acted as If it

only thing he did not have to wash was
his clothes, and those he never got time
to change. He had about as much Idea of
making bread as he did of sailing a boat,
but how:t^ould any one make even hard
tack when they had nothing but sea
water to mix it with? So it happened that
the first loaf made by the jolly tar was
consigned to the ocean at once, and he

The next worst Jpb, after playing sailor,
of course, was washing dishes. For that

a ruinous amount of soap in order to
make It efficacious.

was after gold when he started on the
trip. .He knows a few things now that
he didn't know then, and when the Cor-
della sails again next summer for the sold
fields she will go without him. She Is too
rapid and hard to control, he says. If
they would give him ;5000 ho would prefer
after this to make the journey by land.
He remembers the trip as a vast expanse
of -work, with a little sleep thrown In. But
It Is over now, and he is the sort of a man
to remember the pleasant things, and
when he takes another tack be all the bet
ter for his varied experiences.
There was not all comedy, however, in
this search for the sands of gold, and

to hear the song of the birds and see thÂ«

Tobacco-Smoker Who Gets Most Oat of a Good Pipe.
THERE are many pipe smokers who
do not know how to get the best
there is out of their indulgence. The
great point in pipe smoking Is to
inroke slowly. Nervous smokers smoke
too rapidly and burn their tongues with
tot emcke, besides falling entirely to get
the fullest and best flavor out of the to
bacco. It Is all a matter of habit, but
ilow smoking is a habit which it is hard
Tor some smokers to acquire. In some
rases p.pe smokers have tried for years
:o check their smoking epeed without
success. They begin too late, and the
habit of rapid smoking is shaken off with
Sifficulty when It Is once acquired.
Rapid smoking is as bad as rapid eat-
Jng, or worse. It is also "bad form,"
whether it Is cigar, pipe or cigarette.
The smoking- should be deliberate in or
der to get the fullest enjoyment. It Is
sspeciaUy so ivith a pipe. Many persons
have smoked all their lives and yet do
not know how to smoke. It Is as painful
Jo watch some people smoke as it is to
Â«!t at the table with a man who "gob-
Dies" and "gorges" his food on the "flf
teen-minutes-for-refreshments" plan.
The deliberate pipe smoker gets out of
his pipe an enjoyment of which the rapid
smoker has no inkling. A cigar which
!ias once gone out has its flavor ruined
forever, for nothing Is more obnoxious to
!hc se::se of smell than a newly extin
guished "butt." The beastly persons who
lake their beastly "butts," half lighted
sr newly extinguished. Into the elevated
ind surface cars should have some pun
ishment <*Â«vised for themâ "something hu
morous with boiling oil."
But it makes no difference to the flavor
sf a pipe how many times it goes out.
Fastidious pipe smokers always have at
least two pipes at hand and. never refill
Due until it is entirely cooled off. This
:s a help toward good smoking and a
reasonable life in a pipe. A good way to

"When these lace novelties are black they
are adorned with jet paillettes or dull sil
ver ones.
The popularity of wreaths doesn't seem
to have diminished, though instead of the
glittering ones of bright red, green and
silver paillettes, so much worn last sea
son, there seems to be a preference for
those in natural looking grecrs or of soft
velvet, generally in white. There is noth
ing to brighten them, and, as a conse
quence, they are rather trying to any ex
cept persons with soft, wavy hair of light
coloring.
Roses of velvetâ In fact, all flowers
molded in this soft materialâ are very
smart, but the colors must not be too

Suddenly the Cordelia gave an awful lurch
to leeward, there was a rumbling, rackety
sound, and something shot down the
hatchway.
"It was Moseley, and he never moved
from the floor where he struck. He was
conscious, poor J lad, but he sailed no
farther with the crew of the Cordelia.
Platt was as tender as a woman with
him, but he only lived a few minutes. I
rushed up to the de,ck 'to man the wheel'
and I found that the main boom had
swung around and struck the poor boy
and knocked him down the stairway. The
awful blow fractured his skull. He died
doing his duty as a soldier should, for he
had served In the United States army in
the Philippines and had a good record.
That was a solemn thing when we gave
the poor boy's body to 'the sea and all
that therein is.'
"Platt sewed him up in a spare sail and
brought him aft to the wheel, where I
was on duty. It; was a stormy time and
it was a strange scene on the deck of the
.little craft, tossing on a foggy sea. I
said a prayer and then we both turned
our heads away as Platt let the canvas

hours a day. Sometimes In the open sea
I was so fatigued that I would come near
dropping at the wheel. Sometimes we
would just lash the wheel and let the
Cordelia go before' the wind and take care
of herself while we slept.' And when wÂ«
did sleep we slept without Inquiring what
became of the Cordelia, or how many beUa
had just struck. /And ; we always came
out right, though we had some pretty
close shaves. After the death of Moseley
we decided to go on any try to reach our
destination and see whether landsmen
could run a boat or not. After a long
time, in which we saw neither land nor
lights, we arrived off the mouth of the
Klamath River on October 19. And that
was the hardest pill of all our long and
eventful trip.
"We had neither steam nor a propeller
and we had to have three conditions fa
vorable or we would bump on the outside
bar. We had to have a smooth sea, with
tide and wind up the river. These three
things we could not get. After making
several attempts to enter the river there
seemed to be nothing left to do but to
tack, ship and float for San Francisco,
which we accordingly did. By this time

, "1 grew to' know a good deal about the
relations, of a sextant to the sun, and the
funny thing about it Is that though I had
no chronometer I managed to keep my
bearings on the whole ' tour. We came
down the coast in less time than it took
lis to get in the Golden Gate after we got
here, and when we were off "Point Reyes
.wo saw a school of whales. One of them,
about forty feet long, I should say, began
to spout about thirty feet from the Cor
delia. .That was near. enough to suit my
taste, for, you know, I built, my craft
with' a flat bottom. But he came nearer
and nearer, and Platt and I were almost
paralyzed when the huge " fish plunged
downward in a dive right under the cabin
of our vessel. We held our breath, and in
a moment he came out on the other side,
and we ccuid see that his whaleshtp was
covered with barnacles. Once he came up
within tph feet of the 'side and turned
over, like a big sea kitten. I think he
must have thought )ie â¢ could have a
chance to get those uarnacles off, but if
he had ever, humped up his back under
the Cordelia there would have been two
more farmers in Davy Jones' locker. The
sailors have told us since that if we had

an arduous one. In the rendering
of its multitudinous services Â»t
calls for the business qualifications
of a methodical and systematic
slight noise by pounding on the sides of
the ship his lordship would have de

that, and we sat there frightened to death
while he repeated the" diving process,
coming up on the other side of the boat,
I think about twenty times.
"The next thing that worried us was
the running low of our food supply. The
supply, of oil for.the lanterns was nearly
exhausted, and things began to look se
rious. Then stormy weather began and
lasted until November 6. "We had two
tight spots to get out of on the voyage
back. Once we came near going ashore
at' Fort Ross. The waves were high, and
the wind blew to west and then to north.
We could see the land only a mile or two
away, 'and the Cordelia's nose heading
straight for it. In some way I managed
to tack' ship, and my luck did not desert
me. We had fourteen tons of coal as bal
last when we started, but that . didn't
amount to much. The fact of the matter
is the Cordelia can't steer, and I think I
shall use steam on .her next voyage. We
arrived off the Golden Gate on November
10, and then came what was not the least
trying part of the long sail. We had to
do as much watching and steering as if
we were starting for a. foreign port in
stead of waiting to pass into a home port.
Thick. weather and rolling seas kept the
rule, and it was not until December 6 that
wind and tide were fair, and taking my
old stand at the wheel I guided the Cor

EDEN WAS AT THE
NORTH POLE.
MTORWALD KOEHL. a Scandi
navian scientist, now comes
o forward and says the Garden
of Eden was located at the
north pole. Koehl la an astronomer, and
It 13 astronomical reasons which convince
him that he has at last. arrived at the
truth on this, point. He simply claim*
that when Adam and Eve were llvlns the
stars, did not ascend into the sky at twi
light nor descend at the first approach
of dawn, but that they moved eternally
In a circle above the horizon. There ar'rf
numerous traditions, he says, which prove* "
that the fane of the heavens was at that
time as he describes It. and he adds that
after many months of c i oao investigation
he has been unable to find anything which
is opposed to this view of the case.
In the entire world, however, there an
only two points where such a phenome
non occurs, namely, at the north pole
and at the south pole, and the next ques
tion to be answered was. at which if
these two poles was the Garden of Eden
located? The learned Scandinavian solves
this problem easily. Ancient traditions,
he says, tell us that our first parents,
when they departed from Eden, emigrat
ed toward the south, and as it would
have been impossible for them to go very
far in that direction if the Garden of
Eden had been located at the south poia
the only logical conclusion Is tlvat It was
situated at the north pole.
This novel theory Is attracting much at
tention among scientists and Biblical stu-vi
dents. Some are inclined to accept it un
reservedly, but others hesitate and hint
that they would like to know something
more about the "ancient traditions" to
which Koehl refers so frequently.â¢-jpsKC process by which the ore from

A glittering coin Is long and tedious.
The ore as it comes from the ground

Ecrae idea of the enormous amounts
that have been handled by the various
mints and assay offices is shown by the
â tatexaeat that $2,936,732,252 27 represents
the total amount of coinage of the va
rious mints of the United States from the
establishment of the Philadelphia Mint to
the end of June, 1900. Of this amount the
total gold coinage was 52.167.088,113, the
total silver $796,171,159 65, and the total mi
nor coinage amounted to 533,503,969 72. The

Â«JÂ« carefully assayed, either at the mint
or at one of the assay offices in New Tork
City, Helena, Mont., or Denver. Colo., and
from these the coins are made. The first
etep consists in preparing an alloy for
coinage of the refined gold or silver which
Is nearly pure, with copper, or silver and
copper, which are then melted together In
a large black-lead crucible; and after the
Whiten metals are thoroughly mixed they
t .-e poured into castlron mold* to produce
rectar.gxlar bars called "ingots," which
vary In size according to the denomina
tion of the coin for which they are intend
ed. Thus, the Ingot for the "double
eagle" in 12% inches long, % inch thick
end 1^. inches wide, and weighs 80 ounces,
â while the ingot for the silver dollar is
12T~t inches long. % Inch thick and 154
inches wide.
The insot is then passed between heavy
rolls, frcm which It issues in long narrow
etrips. This operation is called "breaking
down," and makes the metal bard and
springy, and if continued would cause it
to crack and epllt. In order to prevent
this the strips are annealed by being
heated in a furnace of about 1500 degrees
Fahrenheit where they remain for about
an hour and a half, according to the heat
of the furnace and the elze of the strips.

THROWING OLD SHOES
THE custom of throwing one or more
old shoes after the bride and groom
when they go to church or when
they start on their wedding tour is
so old that the memory of man stretches
not back to the beginning. Some believe
It is a lingering trace of the custom
among savage nations of carrying away
the bride by violence. Others think it is a
relic of the ancient law oj: exchange or
purchase and that It formerly Implied the
surrender by the parents of all dominion
or authority over the daughter. It was a
Jewish custom. In Deuteronomy, xxv:5-10,
it is found that the widow refused by the
surviving brother asserted her independ
ence by "loosing his shoes," and in- the
story of Ruth it Is told that it was the
custom in ancient times to place the hus
band's shoe at the head of the nuptial
couch in assertion of his domination, and
that he assumed Um government of the
household.

Intention of the authorities to gradually
work back Into the designing and build

The advantage of the milling process is
that it protects the surface of the coin
from abrasion. The milled pieces must
be again cleaned and softened, which is
accomplished by annealing them at a
cherry-red heat, after which they aro
dipped into a solution of sulphuric acid
and water sufficiently strong to clean and
brighten them. They are then rinsed in
boiling water and shaken In sawdust to
dry them, after which they are ready for
the stamping press. Before stamping a
brief description of the die is negessary.
The design being selected, a drawing Is
made the exact size of the coin required,
and from this drawing a tracing is taken
for the purpose of transferring the design
to the die.
This Is accomplished by covering the
surface of the die, which has previously

"Compression of the waist, too, is bad;
the worst example of it Is found In the
woman's corset, however, and not In the

familiar with the crumpling of the float

next step Is to remove the steel In the
die by means of chisels and gravers, so
that a relief may be bad on the coin.
From time to time, as the work pro
gresses, proof impressions are taken until
the desired result la obtained. The die
is then hardened, after which It Is ready
for use in the press. These dies are then
adjusted in the stamping presses and the
blanks fed to the press through a vertical
tube, and as each piece reaches the bottom
of the tube steel feeders carry It over be
tween 'the dies and place It in a steel
collar, so that when the dies close upon
the planchets it will make the obverse and
reverse impressions on the coin. Accord-
Ing to a description of the process in the
Philadelphia Mint It is said that "double
eagles" and "eagles" may be struck at an
average rate of eighty a minute, while
supplying nutriment to the hair this
blood supply is cut off and baldness Is one
of the results.
"Mo u tiian working at a desk a high
collar Is one of the most murderous of all
men's apparel. Our grandmothers knew
something when they knitted the yarn
â¢writers' of fifty years ago. A pair of
them was worth more than an overcoat
pulled on over starched cuffs. The wrist
Is the most susceptible part of the body to
cold and the flaring cuff invites every
blast of winter, chilling all the blood in
the body in a few minutes. The cuff is a
good thing In hot weather but a menace
to health in winter.
"The glove In cold weather, too. Is a
vicious lnterferer In the circulatory sys
tem. A man's fingers will freeze in a
glove twice as quick as they will uncov
ered, all because the pressure prevents
circulation. For warmth a kid mitten,
fleece lined, Is the only sensible hand
covering.

can 'be recommended?" he repeated. "I
really don't knowâ the collar button, per
haps!"
for the "hair* and "quarter eagles" thÂ«
average rate la 20 per cent greater. The
pressure required In the stamping press
to produce a sharp, clear Impression of
the "double eagle" Is said to be 175 tons,
while only 120 are required for the "eagle."
75 tons for the "half eagle" and 40 tons
for the "quarter eagle." The sliver dol
lar, half-dollar and quarter-dollar are
struck at the same average rate as the
"double eagle" and "eagle," while the
â peed for the dimes is equivalent to that
of the smaller gold coins. The pressure
used In stamping the silver coins is 130
tons for the dollar, 110 tons for the half
dollar. 80 tons for the quarter-dollar and
40 tons for the dime.
From the stamping press the coins pass
to the counting room, where they are put
up In proper quantities for distribution.
All coins but cents are counted in the
usual way, but the latter, however, are
counted by means of a. kind of screen.
There are 1000 depressions in It the exact
size of a cent. The coins are brought
from the machines in pails and a quantity
are thrown upon the counting screen,
which Is shaken until each of the depres
sions Is filled. Tho cents are then tied up
In coin sacks. In this very brief summary
of the process by which the coin passes
from the bullion to the finished money
many of the important* details have neces
sarily been omitted; but If there is any
one thing more than another that is of
conspicuous Interest in the mints and as
say offices of the Government it Is tho
fact that nothing Is lest. Every bit of
metal Is carefully accounted for, and de
fective blanks are promptly returned to
the melter. Every kind of a waste mate
rial that Is likely to contain gold is pre
served. The floor of the melting room is
â wept each day, and the gatherings ara
mixed with a suitable flux and thrown
Into a crucible. "Sweeps" consisting of
broken crucibles and dipping cups, all
ashes from the fires, burned gloves,
aprons, sawdust and packages In which
bullion has been sent to the mint, settlings
and catch wells and roof gutters are care
fully preserved. It Is reported that sales
of such "sweeps" at the Philadelphia
Mint have yielded a return as high as
from $18,000 to $29,000 a year from the melt-
Ing department alone.
A BOOK OF
DRAWINGS
BY
UNDERWOOD.
THIS pen and Ink of "March" Is ons
of those clever creations of the hu
man form divine for which the hand
of C F. Underwood has become so
noted. Miss Underwood catches mo
tion with to sure a stroke that her pict
ures seem endowed with the breath of
life. She gets real strength In her draw-
Ings, not by the number of lines, but
rather by effective, . broad strokes with,
Just the right dash to emphasize her com
position and to tell a story. It needs no
other caption than "March" to explain
this picture; the drawing Itself is the per
sonification of the windy old month "com
ing In like a lion."
There is not a line too much nor a line
too littleâ just enough to catch and pleasÂ»
the eye by the graceful execution and to
hold and fix the attention to the, meaning
of the composition.
This drawing is but one of three dozen
equally good that go to make up the con
tents of a portfolio of Miss Underwood's
work recently published by Quail & War
ner of New Tork under the general title
of "Some Pretty Girls." Each drawing
has been printed on a loose sheet of
heavy paper suitable for such work, and
all of them have been placed in an orna
mental cover similar to those in vogue
among the artists as sketch-holders, mak
ing a most attractive addition to a center
table. The cover is ornamented by one of
Miss Underwood's sketches of a swim
ming girl, with Just her fair head bobbing
up above the waves.
The selections are charmingly varied
with glimpses afield and in town, at homo
and abroad. There Is "On the Road to
Schevenlngen," with a fashionable equip
age in the foreground driven by the swell
girl and her mamma, and with three lltt>
Dutch peasants for color Just hurrying off
the page at the right.
Of other foreign views there are
sketches of "On a London 'Bus." "In Rot
ten Row, London," "Punting on the
Thames" and "Off to the Pyramids."
There are two types in the collection
that are especially goodâ "A Girl of the
Latin Quarter. Paris," ts really worth a
frame and glass, and "A Petticoat Lane
Flower Girl" is also Just as well dnne.
though possibly not so pleasing throu;h
the necessarily dilapidated state of tho
model.
In outing subjects Miss Ur.derwcod
shows the "â¢master hand. Her drawings
not only please for their art. but they ara
equally delightful for the story that they
have to tell. There are the two charming
and shapely maids in wading, who stand
with their dresses'to their knees and with
eyes to the shore wonder "What are they
looking at?" and another' of "Beauty and
the Beast," of two girls who have driven
a little cart and donkey into the middle
of the stream, only to find that he refuses
either to go on or to go back.
Then there are plenty of jolly onesâ of
fun on the old farm, of lovers awheel, of
lovers yachting, and a few with some of
the younger Americans drawn In to help
out their older sisters and brotherâ

WHATEVER the first tov may
have been, the second was un
doubtedly a doll. As play
things dolls have been In use
from the earliest times of
which vre have any record, among all
peoples, Bavage or civilized.
Children In ancient times -were generally
buried with their dolls of burnt clay and
wood. In every nation to-day they still
hold an Important place. The dolls of
Japan are handed down from one genera
tion to another, and In some families
there are hundreds of them- But they are
very different from anything in America.
They are dressed to represent Mikados
and Mikados' wives, nobles of the court,
minstrels and other historical person
ages. Every year a' feast is held in their
honor on March C.
In many houses In India dolls have a
room to themselves. They are made of
wood and painted in gay colors.
Eskimo dolls are made of ivory or wood,
carefully carved as nearly like the human
figure as possible. The eyes are made of
bits of peaxly shell and are inlaid. Some
of them are twelve or eighteen inches
tajil, but most of them are six or eight
inches only.
"Wooden dolls are still made by the na
tive African tribes and so. also, are rag
dolls. Among our Indian tribes dolls made
from earthenware, tree bark and rags are
found. The rag babies have hideous
painted faces, daubed with streaks of red.
Dolls of the Europeans.
Among 1 modern European nations dolls
are first mentioned in the records of the
fifteen, century, during the reign of the
mad King. Charles VI, of France. The
story goes that an Italian named Pusello
Gravaldl gave an exhibition at Paris of
wax figures, among which were fac
similes of several Roman Empresses.
These marionettes became the fashion of
the day. Hardly a week passed In which
the King did not purchase one of the ng
â ures. The entire court followed his ex- ;
ample. When the King died a change
came. The numerous wax figures were
turned over to the children.
Modern dolls were common here In
America, elg-hty years ag-o. The body and
the bead were carved from one piece and
the Itobs wÂ«re made from kid. The fea
tures of the face were painted. The hair
was reaL Dolls with wax heads were then
the elite of the doll world, but they were
not nearly so pretty as the ones we have
now. Their bodies were stiff and long
and without joints. Their shoes and
clothes were sewed on them and they had
no accomplishments, such as turning their
>Â»^n^M on a spring- and saying "Mamma!"
and "Papa!" when a machine was wound
inside,
However, little girls In those days played
mostly with home-made dolls, called rag
babies. Many were imported from Eng
land and sold here, especially in the
Booth. OnÂ© of the dolls wbjch came from
England so long ago is pictured above.
Her name Is Araminta. She has a paint
ed face. Time has not dimmed the bright
ness of her black eyes nor stolen the
roses from her cheeks.
The London doll special to-day Is the
rag baby, and a very pretty thing It is.
Here In New York, too. the rag doll has
developed Into a very fine affair, costing
from $5 to $12 apiece.
There are some 9G0 varieties of the mod
ern doll, ranging: In price from 5 cents to
USD. The cost depends principally upon
the expensive Quality of the doll's ward
robe.
Aristocratic German Puppets.
The finest dolls now come from Ger
many, which excels France in this Indus
try. Nuremberg has been the home of
loll making for many centuries. Now
5rjy the cheaper grades are made there.
The finest grades come from Sonneberg,
â¢chere schools of design have been estab
ished since 1SC1.
In these schools models of all the best
mtlQue and modern sculpture are to be
found, and collections of good prints. To
:hese schools all the young children are
lent to model, and the most exquisite
work is the result, both In the expression

No less than forty different persons are

half falling low on the skirt, down to the
very hem.
There Is nothing simpler to make than
these lace sets and the woman of time,
taste and patience can try them.
Miss Randolph, the stepdaughter of Wil
liam C. Whitney, wore at a young peo
ple's afternoon affair a skirt that was
really typical of one of the styles that
will soon be seen upon the gowns de-
Signed for grown folk.
This skirt was made In little puffs with
bands of insertion between the puffs. It
was only Just to the young woman's an
kles, but it flared very prettily and looked
not so very unlike the short dancing skirts
that were the voguo a few years ago.
The bands of Insertion were finger wide
and were put on very plainly around the
skirt to sort of strap It to the figure. The
material was sheer and made, over a foun
dation.
The Eose for 1902.
The extent to which the rose will be
used the coming year can scarcely be
gauged. Not only will It continue to form
a feature of embroidery, tut It will be
Eeen In silk and In velvet and in every
fabric that bears any semblance to the
rose petal. It will be used boldy as the
artificial rose. A great rose of chiffon,
like a chou, can trim the bodice of an
evening gown.
The prettiest evening effects are ob
tained by the artificial rose. Mrs. Alfred
Vanderbilt Is wearing a bunch In deep
pink against a gown of silver gray. The
gown is In cloth of satin luster, called
panne cloth. It is very thin and displays
the lining, which is pink. The bodice is
cut upon the new blouse lines, with broad
blouse front Instead of the pointed front,
and the roses are fastened at one side of
the bust ; ; "
Another gown, an evening one, worn by
this same fortunate matron, shows a
bunch of roses disposed so that they trail
over the shoulder and down the back. A
bunch also finishes the belt.
For the, street the styles are changing
as well as for the blouse. Positively an
tique will last year's gown look this year,
unless the gifted fingers of a modiste are
allowed full play upon It
The princess style Is still the thing and
the skirt and waist seem to grow to
gether. It may be done by a way of trim
ming, but the princess look must be there.
For the street there is to be a tendency
toward the long, stralgnt lines that have
been noticed upon house gowns. These
cannot always be secured, yet they are
possible in many cases.
Lace ends, stolellke, are not always good
on a street gown, but Just at this season
and feet ar^'.iade In toe same way.
The best heads now are of bisque, whlcil
is a kind of porcelain. They have taken
the place of the wax heads, in the last
twenty-fife years. The body and limbs
are made of papier mache and have uni-

fichus which, give height and slimness.
Furs for 1903.
The very long, all-fur boa Is something
that should be In the wardrobe of every
woman who can afford one. The larger
and longer the boa the better. An Immense
round fur boa of sable is really a good in
vestment, and can be worn year after
year. It should be of good color and of
the best sable that one can command.
There are black furs that will take the
place of sable nicely. They are long
haired and rather aggressive, In that they
are stiff and unmanageable in kind, but
they are just what is needed in the boa
line. In buying furs It should be remem
bered that, accident aside, they will never
wear out, but will keep as a family heir
loom forever, if enough is paid for them.
The long lines can be obtained by the
flat boas of broadtail, of chinchilla, of
mink, of seal and of stone marten. They
are made up 6O as to stand erect around
the neck and lie flat upon the front of the
gown, coming down in two wide pieces all
the way to the hem of the skirt. Those
who prefer can wear shorter ones, Just be
low the belt line, but every attempt must
be"made to preserve the length. The boa
thrown over the shoulder is not so mucE
seen now, for it is not the mode to toss
the boa over the shoulder and wind it
around and around the neck.
The satin cloths are to come In this
spring, though for a time they have been
crowded out a little by the rough goods.
They will be more satiny than before, and
higher in quality, in price and in tone.
They will be worn in the best grades to

Ed. Borein. Mr. Borein spent years

he dared do what few of his brother

entirely the life of the studio and ac
tually took up the existence of a

can bo placed in any position. \
Most Beautiful Yet. . i
Such a doll is the Christmas doll of .1901,
and she is the most beautiful seen yet.
Her greatest beauty lies in her expression.
Of course, she has moving eyes. They are
absolutely necessary. She must go to
sleep or no little girl would want her.
The best variety of moving eyes are
called "flirtation" eyes. Then, she has
actual lids and lashes, 1 and behind her
glass teeth you can catch a glimpse of
her little red tongue. These teeth are
put in in sets of four.
Here in New York and in the North
generally the favorite dolls arc those hav
ing dark eyes and fair hair or blue eyes
and dark hair. In the Southern States
dark hair and dark eyes are preferred.
The Nanking dollâ that is, the old-fash
ioned doll with china head and hands and
feet and having a body of coarse muslin
stuffed-with sawdust or excelsiorâ is still
very high class functions and they will be
accepted for calling and for nice occasions
everywhere.
The mother of an Easter brideâ and
Easter cornea early this yearâ is getting
ready for her own important part of the
ceremony. She is to dress in white, this
mother-lnMaw that will bo, and will wear
a gown of white satin cloth.
To take off the almost kittenish appear
ance she will have it. trimmed with black
lace put on over a" lining of lavender.
There wlll.be a deep lace- hip yoke, a
long lace collar, all lavender lined, and a
lace flounce.
Street Styles for 1902.
â¢. In street style3 the satin cloths play a
still more surprising part. â¢< They . are
made. up on the most extraordinarily ex
travagant lines, and are worn as though
they were tweeds.
A gown that will be worn for calling
the second day of- January, . which Is
"ladies' day," will be of a shade of cloth
that is now called automobile red. It is
very red and you might have once styled
it brick. It is not the invisible red that
one might imagine.
'ihe gown Is a princess with great
slashes In the skirt. The silts are almost
as deep as the waist. There is no trim
ming of any description upon the skirt,
which is cut rather scant. But through
the deep slits you can get glimpses of a
black silk drop skirt, abundantly trimmed
with knife plaitlngs of chiffon and taffeta.
The drop skirt Is very long and has
the dexnitraln over which " the ' automobile
red . princess falls. The waist Is a prln
cess, with a V cut in the front to show
a vest of black.

dreds of sketches that breathe the
life of the plains as it really is and
not as it seems to soft-fingered artist3
who work in comfortable studios and
depend for their inspiration on the
drawings of such men as Borein. His
pictures are filled with the tang of
the soil. They please because they
are natural, because they are the per
sonification of a certain phase of life
âa life full of action, of the sweat
and toil of man and beast. The draw
ings in this series will show the high
est type of animal vigor and physical
manhood skillfully interpreted with
ln great demand. Country stores sell a
great many of them. Many are sent
West, also to the West Indies and to
South America.
Curiously, enough, the doll most In de
mand in the hot countries of South Amer
ica is the wax doll. The heat there melts
the wax and easily changes the expres
sion of the face.
There is nothing very new in the me
chanical devices for dollsâ In winking,
walking,, speaking and singing. The adap
tation of the phonograph to the anatomy
of the talking doll to increase her vocabu
lary-was a failure.
The Dutch Invented the crying doll. Th?
pattern originally came from Japan, and
has long been lying in the museum at The
Hague. Germany now makes them on the
same model.
The very newest on the market ia tha

legs. It will not breakâ a great advantage
for little people, who can hurl them
The hat that Is coming is the fur hat.
The vogue for it Is on the increase and
It will be the hat to wear all January
and February. It is heavy, and, though
always becoming, cannot be tolerated by
sensitive women. There are flat-topped
hats, with tops of fur. and these are very
pretty. A hat with top of ermine had a
little silk brim and was worn with a coat
of Persian lamb with ermine lapels and
cuffs.
New Hats for 1902.
The student hat, perfectly flat on top, Is
copied in, the fur hats, and the "straw
berry shortcake hat" of last summer's
memory Is seen with the top layer of fur,
then a. silk crown, then one of felt.
Snow proof materials are advertised and
goeds that will "stand the weather."
Those who are In the "know" regarding
materials say' that winter is much less
trying upon hats than summer; for, while
tho flying snow and chance bath of sleet
may spot the stuff, it Is apt to dry out
again and leave the shape and original
color there. The sun, on the other hand,
and the winds of spring fade out and ut
terly deprive all material of life and tex
ture. In purchasing one should remember
this fact and buy for becomingness rather
than for durability.
It can not be predicted that the foot
flare will go out, for It is seen not only
upon the domestic models but upon the
Imported ones: and this means that it will
prevail all the spring at least.
With the foot flare there must bÂ« noted
the prominence which braiding will take.
Braids of all colors and In every width

a dash and fervor that can only come
from the trained hand supplemented
by actual experience. This is only
possible to one who has lived among
his models and has himself been one

about at will. Then, too, they float In
water and can be given a plunge bath,
a thing which doll mothers always like
to do.
The finest grades are made of celluloid.
They are not large, varying In size from
four to sixteen inches. They cost from
15 cents to $3 75. Their baby faces have
not the fine expression of the bisque ba
bies, but they are made to look attractive
In the shops by putting on them worsted
baby Jackets.
What Is Considered Cheap.
A doll is considered cheap when it costs
anything under 9S cents. Such dolls are
made of a composition of sand, clay and
glue, and are natives of this country. Tha
bodies are stuffed with cotton or excel
sior. The better grades have bodies of
papier mache.
The price of wax dolls ranges from 10
cents to $3 apiece. The finer grades have
paper bodies and cost from 49 cents to
$12 or $15. The cheaper grades, with com-
braids are In two and three colors and in
four and more. They come with the tin
seling set In and with very thin stripes,
giving them something of the appearance
of lace.
The manner In which braid will be used
makes a little chapter by Itself. It will be
applied to gowns, not in those Intricate
windings that usually, characterize braid,
but in great and broadly defined figures.
Braid crossed upon the front of the
bodice is a feature of a gown Just worn
by Mrs. Nellie Grant Sartoris, prettiest of
Washington widows. The braid Is wide
and beautiful in luster. It Is crossed upon
â¢ the front of the waist to make a big hol
low square.
.Trimmings for 1902.
Stitching becomes bolder. It Is now the
thing to arrange it In rows placed so
closely together that It looks like one
broad band of stitching. But It is ruinous
to the goods for any other use, and for
that reason the stitched bands are applied
whenever their use Is possible.
Stitched bands of cloth, stitched bands
of taffeta, stitched bands of velvet and
stitched bands of chiffon upon a silk
foundation are used for trimming pur
poses.
Linings will run toward white as being
daintier, and It must be recorded that
they will soil. True, a white satin lining
wears longer, in point of keeping clean,
than one would suppose. And brushings
will renew its life and applications of
chalk will .hide the dirt. But there comes
a time when the lining must be cleaned,
and one Is treated to the spectacle of a
handsome cloak of black cloth on the way
to the cleanerâto have its lining done.
White will be the color of spring. Ban
ished will the other colors be for a day,
while the scene will be brilliant with Its
gowns of white and Its gowns of all
black. White cloth Is always charming,
and those who will Invest in the luxury
of a white cloth gown will scarcely regret
It. for so many are its uses.
Tho skirt that has been carried so high
this year will now be lowered. It ia even
predicted that it will hang and that silks
and laces will trail their costly lengths
upon the pavements. That this Is prob
ably correct prophecy can be gathered by
the fact that the French pictures show
the women of next spring walking
through streets with skirts dragging.
For the present we have the mouse lift
which elevates the skirts very nicelv anrl
the side lift, which brings them we'll ud
to the knees. The drop skirt fulfills *Â£
self appointed mission of dropping and re
sembling a dress skirt.
The sheath skirt requires the back lift

to reveal them.

Baby bisque dolls always sell well. They
are no longer Insignificant creatures,
dressed in long clothes. The expression
of their faces has been mads beautiful.
Usually girls choose dolls which are sup
posed to be from 3 to 7 or 8 years old.
Dolls to represent women are-only pur
chased when a child makes a collection
of dolls. Not even boy dolls are a favor
ite purchase.
Costume dolls, representing different
nationalities, are merely curiosities, and
are never mothered.
Each year a doll's wardrobe grows mori
and more elaborate. Boxes and small
trunks come ready packed with completa
outfits for all occasions.
The cheaper grade of stocking* Is now
made in the United States. All the finer
grades of cotton, lisle thread and silk arÂ«

Formerly when Santa Claus brought a
doll undressed nobody thought of buying
clothes for it. Its fine dress was made out
of a piece of the little maiden's old frock,
and she herself made all its lingerie. Now.
home-made clothes are out of style, and
the dolls' dressmaker Is an established
fact. These Jenny Wrens use patterns
in some cases, but dear me. dolls are so
unlike and differ so In shape and slza
that patterns are not always a success.
The best dressmakers look to Paris for
new wrinkles, and so study and Imitate
the fashions for the big folk.
China dolls are the easiest to dress.

give one, an idea of the position of Im
portance which the doll occupies In the
economy of the world.
The corners are stacked"wlth doll pa
tients who have seen hard times. Some of
the shelves are filled with those which
have already passed through the doc
tor's hands. On others are heads of all
kinds and sizes, and hanging from tha
shelves are hands and feet, arms and
legs.
Little girls love the old dolls best It
Is very common. to find a family spend
ing $3 In repairs on a poor little doll which
cost only 23 cents originally.
New hands and feet, also upper arms
and forearms; can be bought for any
price, from 10 cents to $1. A good sized
paper body will cost from 60 cents to S2.
Moving. eyes of all sizes may be found
here and exchanged for an old doll's sta
tionary eyes. Great skill is required In
this operation. Very few can do it.
One tooth may be replaced, and all
kinds of wigs may be found, if dolly has
lost her first crop of hair. These wigs
are made of mohair, angora, lamb's wool
and real hair.
The very newest thing In wiga Is made
with a pompadour. Such a one for %
good sized doll would cost $10. They axÂ«

sxowa old. â¢
Not with slow steps does Dame Fasrii
ion advance, but with positive strides.
She comes on. more than apace, bringing
novelties with her.
lAflea with new ideas is she, this ever
fertile genius, tempting the dollars from
fat purses and luring the very last penny
out of the woman cf modest means who
likes pretty thlngs-
Dame Fashion, while she makes many
changes, does not make sweeping ones,
and for that she must be thanked. She
la Insistent but not radical, arbitrary but
not extreme. A bit whimsical, you might
say. but withal delightfully original; and
those of us who admire her hasten to
Jcia her train of followers. .
Novelties for 1902.
In Â£he little things Dame Fashion says
tiat:
Skirts Trill be enaped like an Inverted
Ul7. *
Evening deeves consist of a side plait-
Ing of xnonssellne de sole, reaching' from
tee ehoulder to the elbow.
In dinner gowns there must be more
length of sleeve, even to the very wrist,
though the neck be cut low.
A single flower will be embroidered or
appliqued upon the front of a gown, its
petals pointing upward, its leaves spread
ing.
The eingle Cower Idea will be continued
cpon the ekirt. one life-size flower upon
each side
The rose will come in as a deooration
and be used from hat to stocking tip.
The round skirt with plaited hips will
be worn for dancing.
The single Jewel will be placed In a wire
petting, as though It were a solitaire of
priceless worth. Upon the back will be a
shank and this will be sewed into the mid
dle cf f.ne laces.
These and many other things will be
soon noticed.
For those who are getting new dancing
gowns for the coming year there can be
ad\-ised the three-skirted sown. This Is to
be worn all the spring In New York, from
now until Easter and after Easter. It was
eeen upon Hiss Evelyn Burden, one of
New York's fairest belles, and upon Mi<*s
Hay Handy, the Southern beauty, whose
engagement fcas been frequently an
nounced and always to an eligible.
The triple skirt consists, as its name
ci^-ests. of three skirts. They can be
iiade of gauze, of mousseline de sole, of
chiffon, or of tulle, of illusion or net. any
thing that is very light will do.
All are sexved upon one bani,
though all are differently hurr*;
The first oneâ or under oneâ may
be in a color, say pistache green: the next
one must be In a lighter shade of green
and the top one in white. All three have
narrow plaltings upon the foot to make
that adorable fullness that is the pride of
the evenlns skirt.
Skirts for 1902. â¢
Under the triple skirt there Is worn -a ;
taffeta petticoat of perfectly plain mate- - '
rial, -with a knife plaiting set under the
foot.
The Watteau skirts are made three In
number and of three colors. Pink, blue
and very light green make a favorite set
of skirts. The result Is a pretty green that
has a little rose tint in it. One skirt drops
over the other, three deep.
The lily petal skirt is cut upon different
lines. It is tight at the hips and flaring
around the foot. There is sometimes no
overdress, but just a single skirt of satin,
or of taffeta, or of peau de sole, or of
corded silk, made snug, with the flare be
ginning at the knees. Little fans of chif
fon are set In this skirt and chiffon ruffles
are beneath it.
From fashion'-s indications it would
seem as though the woman of 1902 would
do naught but wear her best gowns.
Street dresses there are, to be sure, but
they are kept well in the background in
the display of the corning modes, and the
evening gowns are the only ones that are
brought out. The chiffons and the em
broideries, the appliques and the fancy
trimmings, crowd out the utilitarian
styles. â¢
It has been suggested that fashion Is
going back -to the time when all women
were elegantly gowned all the day and
when the cloth tailor-made would have
been considered a sadly unfeminlne viola
tion of every canon of pretty art.
The long Bhoulder effect is something
that will be noted at once. This is se
cured in the house gown by the lace col
lar, which is very deep and falls almost
to the waist, front and back.' This gives
the desired slope, as it can be obtained in
no other way.
Shoulders for 1902.
The low shoulder seam has begun to
appear, though â  happily it has not come
on rapidly. * There are a few gowns cut
with the shoulder seam below the should
er rather than on top of it, fairly hug
ging the arm. and the sloping shoulder Is
the result. -But' this style hampers the
movement of trie arni so in the new gowns
the slope is obtained by trimming the
sleeve in. such a way that it looks as
though the seam were low.
The embroideries of 1S02 will be the most
remarkable of the things to be observed
In the fancies of the year. They will bo
very heavy. f and, no 'â¢ matter what the
weight, will; adorn the chiffons.
An embroidery, so thick and so be
sprinkled with gems that it would have
been appropriate upon the weightiest kind
cf a brocade -was the feature of a chiffon
evening dress. The color of the chiffon
was rose: the embroidery In Rose du
Barry colored silk. . Green leaves, pale
buds, Jong stems and pearl drops stood
out against the rose background. So
heavy was the embroidery that the skirt
fairly clung and sagged and onÂ« could
predict that Its durability would be short.
For all wear, street and house, day and
n!ght, the princess will lead in approval.
It is a shape that Is becoming to all,
without exception, and can be worn by
women of every age and clime.
That the princess is universally becom
ing may be doubted, but really such Is
the case, as was demonstrated by a
modiste of great fashion pretensions.
Taking a stout- woman, she dressed her
a rrincess' with very slim effect, 'and 'then
taking a slender girl, she clothed her in a
princess shape, also with very food re
sults.
The Princess for 1902.
In the making of the new princess
gowns there Is a wide latitude allowed.
It must be a tight-fitting dress, without
division between waist and skirt, but it
need not be the waxenlike mold which
characterized the old princess shape.
One form of princess has a waist laid
In little side plaits. At the belt line, or
where the belt would ordinarily come, the
plaits begin to flare and the skirt la
formed by releasing all the plaits com
pletely.
"A^ r perfectly and severely plain princess
Is i relieved of Its trying â  features by I the
application of , long lines, of;, trimming.
These are, put on from. the neck down
ward to the very hem, and afford a beau
tiful sweep. ,
Miss Hay wears a' black and white' even-
Ing gown cut In princess sb'ape. It 'has a

-foundation of dull white peau de sole, over
â¢ which Is draped the dullest â  of . chiffon,
with: no trace of the liberty finish. There
is not a partidw of glisten in the gown,
making It ideal ' for evening . wear .' during
mourning.
Miss Alice Roosevelt la wearing some
very pretty evening dresses. She la a
young woman with money In her own
right and can dress as elegantly as may
please her, Irrespective of her mother's
$300 edict. Her gowns, while not extrava
gant, are certainly very good examples of
the . up-to-date modes.
A gown for evening' Is In light blue. Its
neck is rounding, with a band of lace fin
ishing; it. From this; band of insertion
there falls a, deep -ruffle almost to the
waist. This gives a very Juvenile finish .
to any waist and is a style, that might be
adopted by many women who would like
to follow the small Juvenilities of dress. |
It is" 1 to' be a 'ytar of Vets. A set that
-
attracted some attention at a December
"evening" given by one of the literary set
to which William Dean Howells and his
daughter Mildred belong was worn upon
a gown 1 of old-fashioned black silk.
The set consisted of a skirt flounce at
tached to a band of lace insertion. Around
the hips there was a yoke of lace. The
neck bad its band of lace Insertion, and
falling/from It there was a deep ruffle of
lace. This reached almost to the waist.
A set , displayed In one of, the shop win
dows was made of, Venetian lace. There
were lace bands: for the elbow sleeves,
with a. deep ruffle of lace falling from the
bands. There was a band of lace around
the'yoke. ' with a ruffle failing .from it.",
The hip yoke was very deep and the lace
flounce was attached to it. ; This flounce
was detached at one side to allow of one-.

missin' that a-way I comes within' a ace
of flubs of goin' plumb off my hoss an'
onto my head. An' still that exasperalin'
Yank goes rackin' along if anything some
i'aster than previous. I begins to lo&c my
tamper ag'in.
" 'I reorganizesâ for at the time I nearly
makes that dive outen the stirrups I pulls
up my hoss to a stopâ an' once more takes
up the pUrsoot of this locoed party. He's
my prey fair enough, only he's too obsti
nate to admit it. As I closes on him
sig'in I starts for the second time to drill
him. but I can't make the landin'. I'm
too younjr; my heart ain't hard enough.
So I rides along by him for a bit, an' for
the second time Bu'gests that he surren
der. This Tank ignores me; lie keeps or.
runnin*.
" 'Which sech conduct baffles me. It'3
nbsolootely ag'ln military law. By every
roole of the game that Yank's my captif;
but defyln' all restraint ho goes caperm'
ca like he's dumb free. \
" '.\s I gallops along about four foot to
his r'ar 1 begins to feel a heap he'pless
about him. As I says,~I'm too tender to
shoot, an' thai* I be.
" 'While 1 m keepin' him company on
this yore retreat that a-way I reflects that
even if I downs him that war would go
on jest the same; it wouldn't stop that re
bellion u<>nc nor gain the South her Inde
pendence. The more I considers, too, the
more the war looks bigger an' the life of
this flyin' Yank looks smaller. Likewise
it occurs to me all at once that he's heart
ed no'th. If he keeps up his lick an'
don't turn or twist none he'll have quit
ted Southern territory by the end of thu
week.
â ' " 'After makin" a complete round-up ot
the sityooation that a-way I begins to
lose interest in this 'Yank, an' at last I
pulls up an' leaves him racih' along alone.
Jest by the v.ay of stim-lant, as 1 pauses,
I cracks off a couple of -loads outen my
six-shooter into the air. They has a ex
cellent'effect. From the jump that Yank
made at the sound I can see them two
shots put ten miles more- run into him
ehore. He keeps up -that gallop ontil he'a
out of sight, an' I never after feasts my
eyes on him. I goes on with" them-or
ders, an' that's the end.'
" 'Which I regyards your conduct, ma
jor, as plumb hooraanc,' says Dan Boggs,
raisin' his glass p'litely. 'I approves of it,
parti^'lar.' â¢ -
"The major meets Dan's attentions In
the sperit they're proposed. After a mo
ment Enright speaks of them cannons.
"'But you all got a battery final, ma
jor?' says Knright.
" 'Six brass cuns,' says the major, an*
his gray eye beams with the recollection,
an' he speaks of 'em like they was six
beautiful women. 'Six bras3 guns, they
be,' lie says. 'We captured 'em from the
enemy, an' I'm put in command. Gents,
I've witnessed some' successes, personal,
but I never sees the day when I'm as sat
isfled an' as contentedly proud as when I
iinds myse'f in charge of them six brass
guns. I'm like a lover to every one of .'em.
" 'I'm that headlong- to get actionâ we're
in Middle Loosiana at the time â that I
hauls a couple of 'cm over by the Missis
sippi an' goes prowltn' 'round ontil \ pulls
on a riot with a little Yankee gimboat. It
lusts two hours an' f shore sink? that na
val outfit an' piles the old Mississippi on
top of 'em. I'm so puffed up with this
yere exploit, a pigeon looks all sunk in an'
plumb consumptif compared to me. .
" '.Thar's one feacher of this dooel with
that old gunboat which displeases me,
however. Old Butler's got Noo Orleans
at the time, an' among' other things he's
editin' them Noo Orleans'papers a lot. I
reads in one of 'em a month later about
me sinkin' that scow. It says that I'm a
barb'rous villain an' shoots up that boat
after it surrenders an' old Butler allows
he'll hang me some the moment ever he
gets them remarkable eyes of his onto me.
I don't care none at the time much, only
I resents this yere charge. I shore never
fires a shot-at that gunboat after it gives
up: I ain't so opulent of amm'nltlon as all
that. - j\s time goes on, 'however, thar's a
day comin' when I'm goin* to take them
determinations of old Butler to hang me
more to heart.
" 'Followin' the gunboat episode I'm
more locoed than ever to get that six
gun battery into a flght. Final I has my

hopes in them behalfa entirely fulfilled;
It's about 4 o'clock one evenin' when wo
caroms on about three brigades of Yanks.
Thar'3 mebby twelve thousand of us rebs
an' all of fourteen thousand of them Lin
coln people. My Lattery is all the big
Kims we-all has, while said Tanks ia
plenty strong an' over with six full bat
teries. The battle opens up; we're on a
old sugar plantation, an' after manoo
v'erin' about a while wo settles down to
work. It's that day I has them dreams
of mine realized in full. I turns loose my
six guns with that verve an' fervor it
ain't time for. a second drink before T at
tracts the warmest attention from every
one of. them half-dozen Yankee batteries.
Which she's shore a scandal the way them
gents In bloo does snoot me up. / jest to
give you-all a idee: The Yankees slams
away at me for twenty minutes; they dis
mounts two of my guns; they kills or
creases forty of my sixty-six men; an'
when they gets through you-all could
plant cotton where my battery stands, it's
that plowed up. .
" 'It's in the midst of the balle an' I'm
standin* near my number one gun. Thar's
a man comes up with a cartridge. A piece
of a shell t'ars him open an' he falls onto
the gun, limp as a towel, an' then onto
the ground. I orders a party named Wil
liams to the place. Something conies
flyin' down outen the heavens above like,
smites Williams on top of the head, an'
he's gone. I orders up another. He as
aoomes the responsibilities of this p'sition
jest In time to get a rifle- bullet through
the jaw. He lives, though; I sees him
after the war.
" 'As thar's no more men for this place,
I cteps for'ard myse'f. I'm not thar a
minute when all at once I sort o' crip-
pies do-wn- to the ground. I don't feel
nothin' an' can't make It out.
"'While I'm reevolvln' this yere phe
nomenon of me wiltin' that aÂ«way in my
mind: an' tryln' to form 'some opinions
about It, thar'a a explosion like forty
battles all In one. For a instant I reck
ons that somehow we-all has opened up
a volcano Inadvertent, an' that from now
on Loosiaua can boast a Hecla of her
own. But It ain't no volcano. It's my
ammunition wagons, -which with two
thousand rounds is standin' about one
hundred yards to my r'ar. Them enthoo
siastic Yanks done blows up the whole
outfit with one. of them shells.
â " 'It's strictly the thin;?, however, which
lets my- battery out. The thick smoke of
them two thousand cartridges drifts flown
an' blankets what's left of me an' my
battery like a fog. Them Yanks quits
us; they allows most likely they're lifted
me an' them six brass guns plump off tho
earth. /Which thar's some roodirnenfs of
trooth in tho theory.

MARY MANNERING
TALKS OF HER NEW PLAY
"GRAUSTARK"
&y Sarah Ccms'.ock.
V "STRESS MARY, as her inti
/ \/j ~ates know her. received me
"f | charmingly.
A Heaven knows there waÂ«.
every reason why she should not. She
had the right to be sarvane. bear-like. She
had reached here five hours late from Salt
Lake. She was grimy from travel. She
had a headache, the dickens of a head
ache. Her trunks were not here. She had
to play that night. And even so she was
charming.
I always credit a large margin of pro
fes'ional charmingness to the advertising
account qt the press, but this was too
much for my skepticism. If she had
clapped ire with one hand and sworn at
her maid with the other I might have un
believed. Eut she didn't. She smiled at
the maid with a smile that was not in
tended for publication, and was well
worth publishing. If she wasted the
same kind en the Johnnie, happy day for
him.
Xot that the Johnnie is awaitinz it!
Mistress Mary has been so shockingly
public about being: happily married that
everybody knows her reputation and she
doesn't care. The Johnnie gave up all
hojpe cf her long ago. The matinee girl
has let Hackett slide of late, too.
"I have come to hear you talk about
Graustark," I said.
"Eless you for that," she cried, clasp
ing my hand. "About Graustark. Camille,
Shakespeareâ anything, anybody, except
Janice arc fcer curl."
"Tor den't love Janice, then?" It was
very urerpected. They usually live Par
thenla, breathe Juliet, dream Carmen.
"Oh, I shouldn't have said that, I know
5t im't business," she continued, "but ir
you had played that simpering girl for
two seasons you would know how I feel.
I am sick cf her adventures. No wonder
she had plenty of them. Any girl could

man that came alons."
"What sort cf a woman do you want to

"I w-nt to play a woman. Janice war.
r.ct that. That Is why I look forward so
happily -to Graustark. It is cne of the
most beautiful stories that I have ever
rrad. It is full of romance, cf true feel
ing, and what counts to me Is that the
heroine is a woman who doesn't simper."
"Str erg-minded 7"
"As opposed to weak-minded, yes. She
Is strcng and sweet both, as the ideal
woman must be. She is brave, ch, so
brave; and she knows how to love so well.
I do hope that I may play her soon."
"Arc ycu studying fcr her?"
"All the time. I read the book over and
over cni.Il I feel that I know her and all
her feelings. It is the only way that I
can study, fcr lbs play hasn't been writ
ten yet. end I can't study the local h!s
tcry of a mythical province."
"Who is gc!rs to do the dramatiza

trouble conies in. There was one dramati

Clyde Fitch could dramatize her for meâ
he understands. But Clyde has reached
that very comfortable place where he
doesn't have to dramatize ether people's
becis. He ccn aflcrd to bs original."
"What was wrong with the play be
sides the conception cf the Princess?"
"Everything. The author made all the
delightful people so cheap, so common
place. When the delightful thing about
them was that â¢ they â¢were uncommon

deserves to be shown up in the very best

"I wish I cci2ia \rrH2," she went on. "I

the chamber, in that wonderful sÂ»^>Â«
where Lorry rescues the Princess from
her abductors. "We have skipped across
the pond to the mythical land of Grau
stark now; Lorry has gone there and
found that his Miss Guggenslocker Is ro
less a person than the Princess of the
little realm. The plot to abduct her has
been formed by some of her unworthy
subjects and Lorry is beginning to estab
lish himself as her protector. He finds
out the scheme of the abductionâ the men
are going to make the attempt while she
is sleeping.
â¢Tha scene is laid in her chamber and
both women are In nlgbtrobes. There
fore it is extremely risky."
Take note well that Miss Mannering did
not add an "e" accented to our good
word "risk," but gave us the square En
glish of it.
"But in spite of its being risky it need
not be -vulgar. It is all in the dark and
It can be written so that It glides safely
over the paper-thin Ice. Oh, if I could
only write!"
I thought of the scene and wished tf
she could.
""Well, I don't dare hope that we will
find an author who can attempt this. At
any rate. Lorry rescues Yetive and then
we pass on to the throne room.
"Here comes In the most charming com
edy scene- In the play. The Princess
shows Lorry the throne room and then
tells him how, when she was oniy a wee
mite, she used to have to climb to tha
throne and dangle her wee feet and listen
to those long-winded diplomats in their
everlasting talk which she didn't under
stand at all and it was so hard to pre
tend. She shows him how she struggled
to tha throne and played at being grown
up and dignified, and her business is all
daintily ingenuous and humorous. It Is a
good prelude to the serious and strenuous
work that follows.
"That is what I like so much about the
Princessâ she is everything," Mistress
Mary broke off In a new rapture. "Sr|/
has her girlish moments, although she is
so thoroughly a woman. She Is for the
most part serious, but she Is humorous
too at times. That is so necessary- A
part to be entirely lovable must show a
dickering of all the lights and shades of
human feeling. Oh, she Is so adorably,
splendidly, wonderfully human!"
Mistress Mary, having forgotten for the
moment that I was not the Princess
Yetive, looked at me with those large
and not too large, soft and not too soft
brown eyes in the way that I presume
she looked at Mr. Hackett when he de
cided he didn't care a continental whether
he renounced all matinee idolhood or not.
She came back after a minute.
"The act closes with the prettiest love
scene that ever was written. Here you
see what the Princess isâ she leaves off
the Princess for a little while and is all
the woman. Here the softest light of all
is thrown on her beautiful character.
"And then in the fourth act comes the
great climax, the great throne room
scene. Yetive in her royal robesâ ob^
such robes as they shall be! They shall
not be the most costly; no one will be able
to advertise them as if they were articles
of commerce on display. That thing 13
all overdone nowadaysâ we are becoming
clothes-horses to show gowns. The Prin
cess shall wear a robe that will show
her, that will mean her. This is art The
gown shall be all white and pure like her,
and the robe shall be long and purple to
betoken her royalty.
"And the scene shall be framed for its
iction, for its acting, for its character
studies. It shall not be called the most
spectacular* or 'the most extravagant.' I
won't be a supernumerary to scenery. 1
want a chance to try myself, to work
for my art. Oh, this catering: to the cheap
demand of the public is slavery."
For an instant the sneaking flicker of a
skepticism, passed before my eyes and I
dared wonder how often this had been re
hearsed. But on the instant I glanced at
the maid. She had dropped her needle on
the floor and was not looking for it.
She was gulping down her mistress' en
thuslasm with wide, delighted eyes. .Mr?:.*
skepticism sneaked o**t as it had come in.
"In the great scene at the end where tha
Princess says, 'I love him'â there is her
chance for art. Then perhaps I can make
the public like it so that I won't be kept
ladling out simpers to their voracious ap
petites.
"Or maybe we are wrong. TVe blame
the public for not wanting what is fine
and strong and great. Perhaps if wa
could give it to them they would want It.
Perhaps it is because we succeed only in
the trivial that they keep us at that."

ry*f VOLUME of admirably written
f I etories represents the latest work
fâ I of A. T. Quiller-Couch. These
V. I tales, entitled "The Laird's Luck,
JL and 1 Other Fireside Tales." vary
in subject from war with its attendan.
horrors to the supernatural and Its m>s
t erics. In all of them there is the fine
adjustment of style to subject which
makes the work of Quiller-Couch that of
a master of the art of story telling.
Whether the scene is laid in the present
time or in past centuries there is the
same admirable representation ot tne
characteristics displayed by people of a
particular period.
"The Two Scouts" is a story of the
Peninsular campaign, when the forces of
Wellington were pitted against those of
Marmont. In the s-rvlce of the Euglisn
are two scouts, distant kinsmen and been
named McNelll. One is a Scotchman born
and bred, while the other, though of
Scotch descent, is a Spaniard by birtji and
training. The methods employed by the
two McNeills in gaining information of
the movements of the French army areas
diverse as their training has been. The
Scotch McXeill, although working in the
heart of the enemy's country, disdains to
uÂ«e more of a disguise than is afforded
him by throwing a dark riding cloak over
his uniform. The Spanish McNelll, on the
other hand, assumes any disguise which
will enable him to penetrate the lines of
the enemy. Both men are famous among
the French for their success in carrying
to Wellington information of the plans of
the other side. The scouts do not work
together. As a consequence of this and
of the secret nature of their work the
French confuse the Identity of the two
men and endeavor to punish one for the
acts of the other. The contempt felt by
each McNeill for the methods of the oth
er which reveals an irreconcilable differ
ence In disposition, and education, has
been described in a manner which lends
a great deal of humor to a story of what
is in reality a very serious businessâ the
work of a spy.
"The Poisoned Ice" is a weird tale of a
plague-Infected city, which encounters ad
ditional horrors in the depredations which
are Inflicted upon it by pirates. Some of
these outlaws are at last brought to a
well merited end by a priest, who leads
them en to drink a delicious cordial cooled
by poisoned ice, which he has manufac
tured. It is the sort of story which only
a fine skill In the telling can reconcile one
to hearing.
"Captain Dick and Captain Jack" are
two rival English sea captains who have
an encounter with French frigates during
the war of a century ago. The way In
which these men bring their ships safe
out of the meeting and the amusing in
cidents to which this gives rise make up
a story to lighten the somberness of those
which precede and follow.
The opening story. "The Laird's Luck,"
is on a theme outside the experience of
prosaic lives. The laird, David Mackensle.
is a young Scotchman who is attended by
a familiar spirit. This being turns all the
good luck of the laird to ill luck. Mac
kensie enters the army, where he bids
fair to earn honor. But the .officious at
tentions of his ethereal companion, who
has no sense of either right or wrong,
bring into his life troubles, whose happy
solution is impossible because of the un
usual nature of their occasion.
"Three Men of Badajos" Is another
Ftory of the Peninsular campaign. This
time the subject is the effect which the
actual experience of battle had upon a re
cruit from a village in England. This
man after entering the army begins to
feel sure that he Is a coward and to fear
that he will lose his self-control when he
goes into battle. As it turns out, this Is
just what he does do. When the time for
lighting arrives he is driven into the thick
of a ttr-ible fight, where the noise and
the horrible sights send him into a frenzy,
whose effects last until the day of his
death.
Perhaps the story which shows the
best workmanship is "Phoebus on Halza
phron," a charming recitation of what is
supposed to be an old legend of the coast
of Cornwall. Graul, the King of the land
of Lyonnesse, is in dire trouble on ac
count of the sorrows of his people. Not
knowing where to turn for help, he prays
to some unknown god of goodness of
whose existence he is instinctively aware.
After a little Phoebus appears In all the
glory of his eternal youth. For several
years the divinity helps the people by the
brightness of his presence and by the
prosperity which he brings upon the land.
To woo the people from their sorrows
the sun god sings to them the heavenly
strains which once delighted immortal
ears and tells to them the old myths of
the classic land where he has ruled. The
story of Biton and Cleobis reappears here,
related with such . delightful qualntness
that in spite of its familiarity it will bear
quotation:
"In Hellas, In the kingdom of Argos,
there lived two brothersâ Cleobis and
Bitonâ young men, well to do and of
jrreat strength of body, so that each had
â won a crown in the public pmes. JCow,
once when the Argives were keeping a
festival of the Goddess Hera their mother
had need to be driven to the temple in
her chariot, but the oxen did not return
from the field in time. The young men,
therefore, seeing that the hour was late,
put the yoke on their own necks and
drew the car in which their mother sat
and brought her to the temple, which was
forty-five stades away. This they did. in
?ight of the multitude assembled, and the
men commended their strength, while the
women called her blessed to be the moth
er of such sons. But she, overjoyed at
the deed and its renown, entered the
temple, and standing before the image
of Hera prayed the goddess to grant her
two sens, Cleobis and Biton, the greatest
boon which could fall to man. After she
had prayed and they had sacrificed and,
eaten of the feast the young men sat
down in the temple and fell asleep and
never woke again, but so made an end
with life. In this wise the blessing of
Hera came to them; and the men of
Argos caused statues to be made of them
and set up at Delphi for a memorial of
their piety and Its reward."
"Midsummer Fires," "D'Arfet's Venge
ance" and "Margery of Lawhibbet" make
up the remainder of the book. The first
, is a story of a husband's trust in his
wife and the reward it brought to him.
The' hero of the second tale is an Eng
lishman of the fifteenth century, who
spends years of time and toil to brin^
about the punishment of a man and
woman whom he hates, but who, at the
last, foregoes the accomplishment of this
Hfe work because of a scruple of con
science.
Margery of Lawhibbet is a noble Eng
lish girl of the time of the Civil War. At
the cost of her own suffering she saves
the honor of her brother when he is
about to play traitor to the cause of the
King. (Published by Charles Scrlbner's

In the latest book of Mr. H. G. Wella

wish that the story were longer than it
BOOK REVIEWS
AND LITERARY CHAT
is. Mr. Wells Is so expert In combining
scientific facts and possibilities with fic
tion into an interesting romance that it
is sometimes difficult for the average
reader to detect the point where one
leaves off and the other begins. In the
present story, "The First lien In the
Moon," the moon is the scene of the prin
cipal events.
So much speculation has gone on about
present and past conditions of that pre
sumedly dead orb, that when we hear
that human life exists beneath its sur
face^ and vegetable life above ground at
certain seasons, we are naturally pre
pared to hear some such tale of wonder
as that which Mr. Wells has prepared
for our delectation. An Interesting tale
it is. in spite of the fact that here, as in
most of Mr. Wells' stories of improbable
events, there is a strong element of the
weird and the grotesque which causes a
shudder as well as a smile.
The first men to go to the moon, ac
cording to our historian, are two Eng
lishmen, who travel from the earth to
the moon in a steel sphere Invented by
one of them, Mr. Cavor. Cavor is a sci
entist who discovers a substance which
he calls "cavorlte." This substance is
found to possess the power of overcoming
the attraction of gravitation. Conse
quently, when it is placed between any
particular object and the eaTth. this ob
ject, as it has then no specific gravity,
has a tendency to rise In the air.
Cavor, assisted by a friend, Mr. Bed
ford, constructs a steel sphere which has
on the outer surface an enameling â¢ of
cavorite. The sphere is furnished with a
suply of solidified air, food and every
thing else necessary to support in comfort
Cavor and Bedford when they go on a
journey they plan. When all is in readi
ness the sphere is set loose from earth
and goes floating off rapidly into space.
By opening windows placed in different
"parts of the sphere it can be made sub
ject to the law of gravitation and be at
tracted toward a particular object. Cavor
decides to visit the moon and sails In its
direction. The description of the land
ing on the moon just before the breaking
of the lunar day, the approach of light
and the transformation it effects in turn
ing a dead world into one quickened by
life is one of the best things in the book.
Cavor and Bedford alight from the
sphere and begin their investigations of
the new world. They soon lose sight of
the sphere, and before they can recover
it they are captured by the Selenltes, as
they dub the inhabitants of the moon.
These creatures are in form closely al
lied to insects, but in power of mind they
have advanced to a point beyond that
attained by man.
Bedford and Cavor are carried by these
creatures to the underground world
where they live. The Englishmen have a
glimpse of the wonders of the Selenite
civilization before they make their es
cape to the surface of the moon. When
they are once again there they separate
and start upon a search for the sphere.
Bedford is lucky enough to find it. He
sets out again to see if he can discover
Cavor. This he fails to do, but he finds
a note from Cavor saying that he has
again been captured by the Selenites. As
the lunar night is almost at hand Bed
ford is compelled to go back alone to the
sphere. He intends to revisit the earth
and there find the resources necessary to
effect the rescue of Cavor. Bedford docs
make his way to the earth, but soon after
reaching It he loses the sphere beyond
hope of recovery. So Cavor Is left to his
fate alone in the moon. Something Is
heard ot Cavor again, however, as he
finds means to telegraph to the earth
something more of his discoveries there.
His reports are fragmentary, but they
glve in clear outline the salient features
of the peculiar life of the moon people.
Cavor's disappearance from sight, or
rather from hearing, comes all too soon
to satisfy the curiosity of the reader as
to the peculiar race of Selenites, with
their intellect and their ugliness. (Pub

Annie Deane.
"Annie Deane," by A. F. Slade, is a
novel out of the common. The story told
is of the struggles toward a re
pentance for sin committed In youth by
a poor, embittered, girl. Annie Deane
leads the thoughtless life of a child until
rhe finds that sin committed even in ig
norance brings in its train consequences
â which cannot be escaped. When she is
little more than a child she is made to
eee that the world considers her life a
ruined one. Relying on the promptings
of what is really a noble nature, she re
fuses to accept the harsh verdict of the
world. Deploring her sin, and yet seek
ing to hide it, she bravely takes up a
struggle for a material independence
which will allow her to atone for her
past by making it productive not of the
evil it promises, but of good to herself
and others. After years of work in a
menial capacity she lives to see herself
respected, and to know that the very
wrong which she committed she has
made work for ultimate good.'
The book Is a plea for a wider working
of the principles of Christianity in the
judgment of the world upon women who
err. In the character of Annie the author
has put forth a strong case In support of
the right of women, to demand of the
world permission to win by right living
reversal of a judgment once passed upon
them. (Published by Brentano's, New
York.)
3ecau.se of Conscience.
One of the latest of the historical nov
els is "Because of Conscience," by Amy
E. Blanchard. It is called "a novel relat
ing to the adventures of certain Hugue
nots in old New York." It follows in the
main the adventures of a conventionally
charming heroine who turns Huguenot
while a very young girl in France and
flees to America in the dress of a boy, ac
companied by Michelle, * her old nurse.
They are in search of the little heroine's
father, who had previously escaped from
his native France, being likewise a
Huguenot.
The book is full of hairbreadth escapes
and fairly well sustained interest. It Is
stereotyped in plot and style. The heroine
has numerous persistent lovers, one of
whom resorts to ingenious measures to
kidnap her. He Is the bold, bad villain of
the plot, a Catholic Frenchman. The
lover whom Alaine loves in return Is the
stolid young Dutchman who rescues her
upon one occasion from the black-browed
and black-hearted DuponC
Poetic justice is generously distributed
when the young Dutchman rescues the
father of Alaine, making it highly ap
propriate that she marry the rescuer. The
villain dies conveniently and those that
deserve it live happy ever after.
However, although the book is In no
wise original, it is brisk in narrative and
quick in dialogue. It runs very little to
description, but there are here and there
touches of picturing that give an attract
ive coloring to the whole. The scene
where Francois, the villain, and Ver
planck, the favorite lover, fight in the
woods Is a fair example of the frequent
thrills of the narrative. Verplanck is try
ing to make off, with Alaine, is stopped by
Francois, and finally succeeds in lassoing
him with a slender leathern rope. .
"Francois bowed himself and fiercely
tore at the slender deerskin thongs, and
at last, running backward, was able to
slacken the cord and to wriggle himself
out of its hold. A moment more and his
pistol was ready in his hand. Alaine fore
saw his intention, and before he could
fire she sprang before her deliverer, who
had sunk upon his knees and was lean
ing heavily against a tree, all his strength
gone from this, last effort. 'Monsieur,'
cried the girl, 'it is an American custom,
you say, to use a woman as a shield.
Monsieur Verplanck has proved that it is
false, and that it is but the makeshift of
a coward. Yet, because you have shown
me how powerful a shield a woman can be
I stand here.' She gave a quick glance
at the fainting figure before which she
stood; then she lifted her head high and
faced Francois. 'I defy you, Monsieur,'
she said.
"He rushed at her, blind with rage. 'I
â will kill you before you shall escape me,'
he cried."

Propert7 and Trusts.
Under" the titles, "Democracy and
Trusts" and "People and Property," there
have been published two addresses of
Edwin B. Jennings, who has achieved
considerable repute as a writer on eco
nomic topics, and wno was a delegate
from New York to the National Anti-
Trust Conference held at Chicago in 1900.
Neither of the volumes undertakes any
thing like a careful study of the subject
discussed. Mr. Jennings has decided
views on the trust issue and expresses

EUGENE FIELD AS A
FRIEND KNEW HIM.
THERE has just been published by
Charles Scribner's Sons a life of Eu
gene Field In two volumes by Slason
Thompson, > (Price $3.00.) Mr.
Thompson was a warm personal friend of
Field and therefore well fitted to become
his biographer. These two volumes are
especially interesting on account of the
great number of letters by Field to inti
mate friends and the unique and original
illustrations reproduced which Field so
enjoyed making a part of his correspon
dence. The numerous and little known
portraits of Field and the great wealth of
anecdote form a feature of the books. The
following extracts will serve to give an
idea of the contents of the work:
There -were two Fields â the author and
the manâ and it is the purpose of this
study to reproduce the latter as he ap
peared to those who knew and loved him
for what he was personally, for the
benefit of those who have only known him
through the medium of his writings.
In doing this it is far from my inten
tion and farther from my friendship to
disturb any of the preconceptions that
have been formed from the perusal of his
works. These are the creations of some
thing entirely apart from the man whose
genius produced them. His fame as an
author rests on his printed books and will
endure as surely as the basis of his art
was true, his methods severely simple
and his spirit gentle and pure. In his
daily work the dominant note was that of
fun and conviviality.
It is more than probable that Eugene
Field chose Chicago for the place of his
permanent abode after deliberately
weighing the advantages and limitations
of Its situation with reference to his
literary career. He felt that it was as
far East as he could make his home with
out coming within the Influence of those
social and literary conventions that have
squeezed so much of genuine American
flavor out of our literature.
He had received many tempting offers
them In a way that will be more pleas
ing to those who agree with him that
trusts are forms of robbery than to those
who are as yet but students of the prob
lem and wish for argument rather than
denunciation. His style and method may
be estimated from two quotations; the
lirst taken from "Democracy and Trusts" :
"It might v be well for the old king to
consider a few facts calmly and without
passion. Let him not lose his head. The
last king to do that was Charles I. His
main protection has been his secrecy and
his infernal hypocrisy. Let the people
once awaken to the full knowledge of
his crimes and he will be shattered as by
a stroke of lightning." The second .is
from "People and Property": "If any
citizen should catch a sneak thief in his
house making off with his coat he would
take him to the nearest police station
and there make his charge. He must
look to the law for the rest. This general
remark applies 'to the Standard Oil trus
tees. It would seem that any honest citi
zen would be justified in knocking one
down and dragging him to the nearest
police station. To begin with, the presi
dent would have a salutary effect upon
the others."
It will be seen that Mr. Jennings has
more of the stump speaker than the phil
osopher In his niake-up. His addresses
do not lack what is called "snap," and
will doubtless prove popular, but they
are of little value, to earnest students of
the trust problem. (Published by The
Abbey Press, New York. Price 50 cents
each.) .
The Children's Health.
A third volume has just appeared in
that excellent series, "The Parent's Li
brary." "written by Florence Hull Win
terburn. Mrs. Wlnterburn, in her books
"Nursery Ethics" and "From the Child's
Standpoint," gave so much that savored
of good common sense and years of ex-
â 
THE SUNDAY -CAM,.
perience that her last work, "The Chil
dren's Health," cannot fail to receive a
warm welcome. In the present volume
she does not pretend to give a treatise on
health and hygiene from the st&ndpoint
of disease treatment, but rather the pre
vention of disease by the proper regula
tion of life. She has succeeded admirably
and very closely approximated her Idea
announced in the preface of writing "a
simple little manual containing the laws
of health as based upon evolution, and
giving broad outlines instead of pet the
ories." Her book begins with a general
discussion on "The Health Demanded by
Modern Life." She then considers: "The
Child and His Atmosphere," "Educating
the Nerves," "Nature's Sweet Restorer,"
"Nutriment and Growth," "The Relation
of Grace to Health," "Vocal Expression,"
"Culture of the Emotions," "Defective
Children," and at the end gives a chap
ter on "Recreation and Social Life."
"The Children's Health" is published by
The Baker and Taylor Company, New
York. Price, $1 25.
Caleb Wright.
"Caleb Wright," by John Habberton,
the author of "Helen's Babies," is a story
of a small town in the West. It differs
much from the typical stories of Western
life, with their accounts of the doings of
desperadoes. The little town where Ca
leb Wright and his friends live is a peace
ful, law-abiding community, whose main
disadvantage lies in being shut off from
the wider life of the great world. To this
town there comes from New York a man
and his wife, whose energy revolutionizes
its fortune and helps develop its re
sources until It has a bright future be
fore it. These people find in Caleb Wright
from New York newspapers before com
ing to Chicago and after our acquaintance
I do not believe a year went by that
Field did not decline an engagement; per
sonally tendered by Mr. Dana, to go to
the New York Sun at a salary nearly
double that he was receiving here.
But, as he told Julian Ralph on one
occasion, Y\e would not live in or write for
the East. For, as he put it, there was
more liberty and fewer literary "fellers"
out West, and a man had more chance to
be judged on his merits and "grow up
with the country."
Practically all Field's scholarship and
mental equipment, so far as they were
obtained from books, were acquired after
he came to Chicago and he was never
lifted above the ragged edge of impecuni
osity until he began to receive royalties
from the popular edition of "A Little
Book of Western Verse" , and "A Little
Book of Profitable Tales."
His domestic life -was spent in flats or
rented houses until less than five months
before his death. The photographs taken
a few months before his death of Eugene
Field's home and the beautiful library in
which he wrote are ghastly travesties on
the nomadic character of his domestic ar-
a strong ally in their efforts toward bet
tering the condition of the town. Caleb
is a simple, kind soul, with a fund of na
tive humor and wisdom. He works for
years to giv$ happiness to others, and at
last ho finds his reward In prosperity and
in the love of a woman who is good
enough herself to appreciate the nobility
of Caleb.
"Caleb Wright" Is a simple tale of a
quiet life. It does not arouse deep emo
tions, but it pleases, as must do any well
"drawn picture of life, even if this portray
only the simple events of lives which fate
has placed amid unromantlc surroundings.

iliirVo Young Ranchmen.
"Three Younp Ranchmen," by Captain
Ralph Bonehill, relates the adventures of
three brothers, Allen, Chetwood and Paul
Winthrop. These boys have been left to
support themselves as best they can on
a lonely ranch In Idaho. They have a
hard time and meet with many thrilling
adventurtrf, but at last prosperity smiles
upon them and they are able to leave
their ranch and go away to school and
college. (Published by the Saalfleld Com
pany. Price $1.)
Jingleman Jack.
"Jingleman Jack" is a book to delight
the heart of the small boy. The rhymes,
by James O'Dea, cover many of the call
ings, trades and crafts of the day, and
the illustrations by Harry Kennedy and
designs by Charles Costello form no small
part ; in making. the book a most attrac
tive | holiday .. volume. First we have a
jingle to- the sailorman,. followed by one
to the artist, and then come in succes
sion the lumberman, bricklayer, farmer,
teamster, tailor, cobbler, miner, cowboy,
blacksmith, fireman, miller, engraver,
iron-molder, lawyer, glasa-blower, baker,
cook, brldge-bullder. printerâ and so on
for some twenty-nine more. Each rhyme
has its own full page picture in colors,
which brightens the book and will allure
the youth into spending a few of his busy
minutes in the quiet occupation of read
ing and picture seeing instead of mischief
making. (Price $125.)
Merry Time Songs for Children.
Although this charming collection of
songs is designed for children, the moth
ers will enjoy them quite as much as the
little ones. Laura E. Richards, who
writes such pretty verses for St. Nicholas,
contributed to the number; also Anna M.
Pratt,' who knows so well the tastes of
the small child. The pages are reduced
from, originals, several of which were dis
played at the late exhibition at the Hop
kins Institute. The illustrations arc, of
course, delightful, for Albertine Randall
Whelan did them, and all of the little ones
who enjoyed her "Moon Babies" last year
will wish to have a copy of these songs
which she has illustrated. The music is
by Charles H. McCurrie, and 13 very, tune
ful. The melodies show great variety and
suit admirably the words for which they
are written. It is a local production and
deserves the popularity it will certainly
attain. (Published by Sherman, Clay &
Co., San Francisco.)
Exercise Book.
"Practical Exercises on the Latin
Verb,"/ by Katherine Campbell Reiley,
teacher of Latin, Brooklyn Heights Semi
nary, is a copy book of blanks for exer
cises on the Latin verb, prepared to econo
mize the time of both teacher and pupil
and to present the verb in such a way
that its acquisition will be both easy and
permanent. It has grown out of the prac-
rangements for many years before June,
1895 â dreams for which he longed, but only
lived to realize for four brief months.
AH the best Field wrote previous to 1S9O
âand it includes the best he ever wrote
except "The Love Affairs of a Biblio
maniac,"âwas written In a room to which
many a box stall Is palatial, and his sole
library was a dilapidated edition of Bart
lett's "Familiar Quotations," Cruden's
VConcordance of the Bible" and a well
thumbed copy of the King James version
of the Bible. He .detested the revised
version. The genius of this man at this
time did not depend on scholarship or
surroundings, but on the companionship
of his fellows and the unconventlonallty
of his home life. '
Field never believed that he was sent
into the world to reform It. His aim was
to amuse himself and if in so doing he
entertained or gratified . others, so much
the better. "Reform away," he was once
reported as saying, "reform away, but as
for me, the world is good enough for me
as It is. I am a thorough optimist. In
temperament I'm a little like old Horaceâ
I want to get all the happiness out of the
world that's possible."
And he got it, not intermittently and in
chunks,, but day by day and every hour
of the day.

experience, and may be used in connec
tion with any beginner's manual or les

laying rapidly and well the .foundations
of a knowledge of Latin grammarâ that
of giving the pupil thorough and effective
drill on the verb. (Published by the

The Old Northwest.
"Baldwin's Conquest of the Old North
west," by James Baldwin, is supplement
ary to tho same author's "Discovery of
the Old Northwest," yet is complete in
itself. Commencing with the completion
of the French colonization about 1735 it
covers a period of a hundred years end
ing with the last struggle, in this region
between the forces of barbarism and civ
ilization (1832), and the completion of the
American conquest. This Is an attempt
to present for younger readers the little
known but varied, interesting and im
portant history of this magnificent sec
tion of our country, the romantic side of
which is being exploited in such works
of fiction as the late Maurice Thompson's
* Alice of Old Vlncennes." (Published by
the American Book Company, New York.
The Golden Tooth.
"The Golden Tooth," by J. Maclaren
Cobban, is a novel containing a mystery
A murder is committed in England, and
an amateur detective sets out to find the
unknown murderer. As is usually the
case in detective stories, the professional
detectives accuse of crime an innocent
man, and it is left for the amateur to un
ravel mysteries and to bring the real cul
prit to justice. It is the strange thing
about stories of this class that in them
men who spend their lives unraveling the
mysteries of crime always follow up a
false clew, while a man who is supposed
to give his time and attention to other
pursuits suddenly develops a genius for
the detection of crime which i3 as sur
prising as it is sudden. Those who care
for any sort of a detective story will like
"The Golden Tooth"; the more fastidious
would better avoid it, as there is really
nothing commendable in It. (Published

Literary Notes.
Little, Brown & Co. have just complet
ed the publication of their Valois edition
of the romances of Alexandre Dumas, In
forty volumes. There are two styl â¢
cloth and half morocco. It is uniform
with the Centenary Balzac.
Maxfield Parrish, who has made some of
the most striking colored pictures in the
December magazines, has gone to the
Southwest for The Century to illustrate
the series of articles on that country writ
ten by Ray Stannard Baker, which The
Century is about to print. This is Mr.
Parrish's first visit to the West.
Doubleday, Page & Co. published last
week the second and concluding volume
of "The Furniture of Our Forefathers,"
"The Latin Quarter" in their "French
Novels of the Nineteenth Century" series.
"The True Story of Captain John Smith,"
a biography compiled from unusual
sources by Katharine Pearson Woods,
and "Photography as a Fine Art." by
Charles H. Caffln, with over a hundred
examples of the best work.
It is announced that "Eben Holden" is
soon to appear in an Illustrated edition.
Scenes from the play now running at
the Savoy Theater, New York City, will
be reproduced, together with Mr. Bachel
ler's portrait as a frontispiece, and a
very attractive gift book for the holidays
is promised. The success of the play hai
been frequently commented upon. E. M.
Holland, in the title role, looks for all the
world like the picture of Uncle Eb used
by the publishers to advertise the book.
Outing is edited to interest almost every
man and woman who is not an ascetic.
It has a spirit of buoyant life which car
ries its readers from cover to cover. Its
articles of out-of-door fact are instruc
tive; its stories of out-of-door fiction are
interesting. Here are the titles of ten of
the twenty-eight features of the Decem
ber number: Colored frontispiece, Fred
eric Remington; "The Wilderness Hun
ter," Owen Wister (illustrated by Fred
eric Remington); "The Newfoundlanders
of the Outports," Norman Duncan (pho
tographs by the author); "The Way of
the Indian Cross," Edwyn Sandys; "Vlc-3
in Horses and Its Correction," Frank M.
Ware (practical and Illustrated); "Fal
conry in France," Vance Thompson
(drawings by Hy. S. Watson); "The Dog
Poisoner," J. P. Mowbray; "Theories Re
garding Scent," John T. Bailey; "Physi
cal Training for Women," J. V. Gillman;
"The Adventures of Mr. William Mart
ner," Edward S. Holden.
The January Delineator has a rich and
inviting table of contents, and attractive
features are added to all the existing- de
partments. Ira D. Sankey, the famous
evangelist, vividly describes his journey
through Egypt and * Palestine, and tne
personality of the author gives to these
papers an interest that Is truly remark
able. They are illustrated by photographs
made by I, Allen Sankey, who accom
panied his father. Recent mournful
events and the intense public sympathy
with Mrs. McKinley make very timely an
article on "Notable Pensioners of the Na
tion," In which the annuities paid to cer
tain illustrious ladies are made public for
perhaps the first time. Dr. S. R. Elliott
begins his series of recollections of a
group of women noteworthy for personal
character and attainments, and Clara E.
Laughlln tells with great charm the story
of Poe's love and marriage. Some ex
cellent fiction is offered in this number;
the children are especially considered and
the various miscellaneous articlesâ the
fancy-work, cookery, the holiday display,
house-furnishing, etc.â have a distinctly
seasonable flavor.
In the elaborate and authoritative work,
"The Furniture of Our Forefathers," now
published complete by Doubleday, Page
& Co., is given an extract from a letter by
Governor Winthrqp of Massachusetts
written in 1630, which shows what a se
rious matter the love of pretty things was
In those days. WInthrop says: "A good
ly woman of the church of Boston, dwell
ing some time in London, brought with
her a parcel of very fine linen of great
value, which she set her heart too much
upon, and had ueen at charge to have it
all newly washed and curiously folded anÂ«l
pressed, and so left it in the press In her
parlor over night. She had a negro maid,
who went Into her room very late, and
let fall some snuff of the candle upon the
linen, so as by morning all the linen was
burned to tinder and the boards under
neath and some, stools and a part of tho
wainscoat burned, and never perceived by
any in the house, though some lodged In
the chamber overhead and no ceiling be
tween. But it pleased God that the loss
of this linen did her much good, both in
taking off her heart from worldly com
forts and In preparing her for a far great
er affliction by the untimely death of her
husband, who was slain not long after at
Isle of Providence."
A significant illustration of the large
and growing Interest in stories of Ameri
can life which deal with men and women
more or less familiar to the reader is of
fered in the success of "J. Devlinâ Boss,"
Issued by the Lothrop Publishing Com
pany. The novel, which was published a
little over three . months ago, has sola
heavily from the first. It has been on the
list of the six best selling books In many
cities the country over during that time,
and Is in greater demand to-day than at
any time since Its appearance. It is a
love story with a political setting, and it
has had as many women readers as men.
Two propositions have already been made
for its dramatization; and among those
who have written to the author. Francis
Churchill Williams, and the publishers, of
their personal interest In the story' are
Rear Admiral Evans, Secretary of State
Hay; D. B. Henderson, Speaker of the
House of Representatives; Senator Haw
ley, Irving Scott, Cyrus Townsend Brady,
Governors Van Sant and Yates, Senator
Daniel of Virginia, Marion Harland. Mary
E. Wllklns, Gertrude Atherton, Jacob
Riis. Leo Rassieur, commander of the G
A. R.. and Thomas E. Watson. The story
is a stirring one, brings Into relief per
haps the most typical figure in American
life, and not a few dramatic Incidents in
national history have a place in the book.
The International Monthly for Decem
ber contains a.number of essays that com
bine a sufficient lightness of touch with
genuine interest and power. "The Middle
West," by Professor Frederick J. Turner
of the University of Wisconsin, Is a com
prehensive study of the main features in
the development of the vast area under
discussion: The Incidents of settlement,
the two currents of emigration, Northern
and Southern, especially In their relation
to the civil war, and, finally, the enormous
industrla 1 expansion of comparatively re-
t cent years. Sereno E. Payne of Auburn,
N. Y., contributes an essay on "Tariff and
the- Trusts." Another valuable essay in
this number is "Gustave Flaubert." by
M. Edouard Rod, a master In the art of
literary portraiture, and one of the most
eminent critics in the France of to-day.
Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary," In
spite of its cynical realism, is in stv^ and
composition perhaps the mostf per
fect novel that has ever been writ
ten, and M. Rod does full jus
tice to the great esthetic creation
as well as to the remarkable personality
of Flaubert himself. Professor Dana C.
Munro of the University of Pennsylvania
concludes hte historical sketch, "Christian
and Infidel in the Holy Land": Professor
William A. Dunninsr of Columbia Univer
sity contributes an important study, from
the sources of "The Political Theory of
Machiavelli," the famous and enigmatical
Florentine; Air. Montgomery Schuyler of
New York in "An American Dictionary of
Architecture" offers a worthy tribute to
the work of Russell Sturgis. and Poultney
Bigelow writes with all of his accustomed
verve on the patriot Johann Karl Bert
ram Stuve, who did and suffered so much
for the cause of pblitical freedom in Ger
many.
The December Issue of "Successful

There seems to be much that is appro
priate to the season In the December num
ber of The Critic. The cover, which in
lithographed in colors, shows a blue della
Robbia medallion of the Virgin, child and
ange.ls on a white ground, the lettering
being In gold. The feature of the number
is, however, Ralph Fletcher Seymour's
decorations for Milton's Ode. "On tha
Morning of Christ's Nativity,'* the entire
poem being illustrated and rubricated in a
manner which la essentially rich and ef
fective. Mr. Seymour is responsible for
all the designs, both pictorial and typo
graphical, and the poem, with a frontis
piece portrait of Milton at the age of
twenty-one, forma one of the most elab
orate of The Critic's Christmas features. <
Following the Milton ode are reproduc
tions of a series of portraits by the cele
brated German portrait painter, Franz
von Lenbach, with Introductory letter
press by Christian Brinton. The articla
includes portraits of Von Lenbach him
self. Prince Bismarck, Arnold Bocklln.
Paul Heyse, Signora Duse. Bjornstjerne
Bjornson and others of international in
terest.
One of the most important contributions
to the December Critic is an article 0W?
William Armstrong entitled "Mr. Swin
burne and Mr. Watts-Dunton at 'The
Pines." " Mr. Armstrong enjoyed excep
tional opportunities for making the ac
quaintance of the poet and his host and
studying their milieu, and has written a
paper full of details regarding one of the
most Interesting literary friendships of
the present day. The paper is fully illus
trated after photographs, drawings and
paintings of the occupant3 of "The Pines"
and their surroundings, both Interior anrt
exterior. Another article which includes
a happy combination of text and pictorial
material is Prof esso â¢ Harlow Gale' 3 studr
of "Johannes Brahms." Professor Gala
touches upon the main points in Brahms'
life, both biographical and technical, and
his paper Is enlivened by numerous pho
tographs, silhouette;? and drawings cover-
Ing almost every phase of the musician's
career. A further pictorial feature of tha
current number of the Christmas Critic

Q' rTHE
BEAUTY
QUEST
â¢Copyright. 1901. by F. Smith.)
THE erect, svelte form with it? ex-
OU5?:te curves of lithe and shandy
limbs has a charm to which a
beautiful complexion, limpid eyes
ond iresses of molten gold cannot
lay claim.
It is the "sweet, attractive kind of
prace," of Which the i>oets sang, and she
â who i)ossosses ir. "wherever she stands
or moves, or loaves a shadow on the wall,
confers a favor on th<Â» world." Many
women, although beautiful of feature, aro
not creatures of curve and grace, and
they fail to charm, while a comparatively
plain woman, with an erect, supple fisj
v.re, hos a prreat power of attractiveness.
The first move in the direction of acquir
ing a lithe form, melodious movements
and poetry of pe^ture is to gain physical
buoyatcy. To a;i this one must learn
how to poise the body, which can only b*>
done correctly when or.e has t given up the
notion that the center of gravity of the
human bodv is over t!;p heels: it is over
the bulls of the feet. \Yh?n the experi
ment of balancing Jn the correct way is
tirst tried the sensation is very nuch that
of tumbling over, hut after a few days
one exclaims. "Oh. 1 feel so much lighter
and younger than when my weight rested
on my heels." It is indeed the easiest
position possible and worth taking some
trouble to acquire. The preliminary stop
in learning the art of true balancing is to
raise thÂ«Â» heels quickly from the ground
an.3 stand as high on tip-toe as possible,
then lower the heels with moderate speed,
without tiypir.jr the weight of the body
backward. Again, keep the heels on the
ground and lift alternately the balls of
the feet and put them down with a slight
pressure.
Having learned how to balance the body.
to stand' correctly is an easy matter.
Have the weight evenly balanced upon
the feet, though it is not necessary to
ptand with the heels together. Draw the
knees in firmly, but do not hold them
tensely, draw the hips well back and con
tract the abdominal mureles. â¢ The chest
must be thrown out and then the shoul
ders will drop down and back as they
should.
"When told to throw your <hest out."*
says cne who speaks with authority,
â 'imagine a handle is there and that you
are being pulled forward by it." The
next step is to raise the head slightly,
and after that draw the chin in. If the
body can now sway easily back and
forth from the feet up the posture is cor
rect. Swaying back and forth does not
mean bending at the waist, but to main
tain the standing position and imagine
that one is a lily swayed back and forth
by the wind. The weight of the body Is
well off the heels, and cne is really stand
ing on the balls of the feet.
Tipping the shoulders from side to side
â¢when walking is very ungraceful. To
correct this habit walk about on tip-toe
occasionally, keeping the shoulders level.
In this way poise of head as well as
shoulders is gained. To toss a toy bal
loon about with the tips of the fingers
will also aid in bringing about this result,
and is not altogether such childish sport
as might be imagined; indeed, there is
method in this mode of developing ex
quisite curves. The balloon is tossed
about in a score of different poses, and
eo expert may a person become that she
can keep three balloons in motion at once.
Every muscle of head, neck, shoulder.
arm and waist is brought into plav.
Throwing the balloon aside, the next
movement is to stoop suddenly and sweep
the floor with one hand while the other is
waved triumphantly aloft. The woman
who can do this need have no fears of

Pose and Repose.
Having learned how to balance the
body, to stand properly and to acquire
poise of head and shoulders, the next ef
fort is pose and repose, that marks the
daughter of a hundred Earls. "I visit
museums and art galleries," says one
devotee, "and study effects. I practice
them, too." This is following the example
of the great Rachel, who believed that by
studying beings that were beautiful it
was possible in time to resemble thorn.
As a child she was not blessed with any
great personal charms, bui. becoming en
amored of some of the classic statues shs
tells in her memoirs how any beauty sin
possessed she owed entirely to her own e'
forts and determination. To work and
strive faithfully for perfection in a rvinÂ«
human body is a. nobler purpose, it has
been said, than to carve a perfect stain*
out of cold, lifeless marbleâ yes. the am
bition is as much nobler as the living,
breathing, warm body is more beautiful
thaii the cold, dead statue.
To learn to sit gracefully is an art and
not an instinct. The woman who under
stands the artâ for art it isâ gives no evi
dence of a dominance of one part of her
physique over another. Nor does she
lounge: she sits erect, because when in a
perfectly upright position one may actu
ally gain an inch or two In height, and it
is a principle of physical culturista that
the hljrher an organism is held the better
it will fulfill its functions. F.reetness of
the trunk, a good poso of the head and
graceful disposition of the lower limbs
are necessary if one would s't we!!, li is
gc-cd practice to hold the body perfectly
ercct for a fev.- moments daily without
touching the chair back: Pit well toward
tile edge of the seat, with the right foot
slifc'jtly in advance of the left, ready to
rise quickly without help from the hand*
at an emergency. After a time prolong
the few moments to a half-hour, and.
finally, elastic, sinewy and independent
will those lazy muscles become. It is in
dolence. Indeed, that makes a woman
awkward. She rises from a pitting pos
ture by placing her hands upon the arms
of her chair or upon a table; she stands
â with the weight of her body thrown on
one foot; she stumbles over rugs because
she will not lift her feet, and she does the
half-hundred other stupid things that
cause her to suffer so by comparison with
the alert, erect, well-poised woman, who
never loosens her hold on the reins of her
mu?t ular personality. This she learns to
do without any mental effort after u. time,
though it requires constant thought and
eternal vigilance at first. The first and
greatest impediment to grace is indolenje.
To Reduce the Girth of the Hips.
No figure can be lithe and graceful if
there is an excess of circumference below
the waist. This is a pronlem over which
many a woman with an otherwise shapely
figure has worried herself. Inordinately
largo hips will spoil the effect of an oth
erwise good figure, to say nothing- of dis
astrous effects to smart gowns, for no
perfection of cut will hide the presence
of overmuch flesh. To reduce the girth of
thÂ«Â» hips one exercise, is suggested which
can be taken without any appliances. It i.-
to stand erect on a slight elevation from
the ground with the weight on one leg.
Relax the other leg, and with the power
from the thigh first swing the relaxed leg
forward and backward; then swing it in
a circle around the strong leg. During
these swinging leg movements keep a
steady poise; the body from the hips up
ward must be quite motionless. The quite
interesting s-tatement is made that a wom
an has reduced the size of her hips no
less than four inches by this and similar
exercises. Another way may be men-
V.'iiat she calls her hobby at present fs
the relation that she considers coeduca

IT is significant that as a rule tho^e
persons who do not believe In co
education do not believe in equal
suffrage, and vice versa. In ether
words, coeducation will be subject to
constant attacks from various quarters
eo long as women have no political rights.
We hear it paid that the family Is the
unit of the .state. This is, politically and
legally speaking, not true. The unit of

balls of the feet lapidly a half-dozen
times or more. Do not stra!n or push
with the body; it must be easily main
tained erect and free from tension. Do
not work the arms. These exercises can
not be practiced too often if reduction of
the size of <!ie hips is desired. Too large
a .waist is al^o another lion In the path,
but rather too large a waist than one too

Venus than a wasplike vision. If it is de

Gossip of the Studios at Home and Abroad
â¢"yiNCE the opening of the Bohemian
l^>. Club exhibition on the 19th many
YJ of the artist members are being
kÂ«/ heartily congratulated, not only
for taking part in the most suc
cessful exhibition ever held in this city,
but for the number of their canvases
that were sold.
Henry Breuer was especially lucky, in
fact he broke the record in the number
of sales made, for out of nine canvases
sent only three remained. The large Cali
fornia landscape which held the place of
honor on the north wall was one of the
first to change ownership. Of his others
sold during the two weeks' exhibition
were "Sand Dunes Near Golden Gate
Park." "Near Fruitvalc. California." "A
Monterey Landscape," "A Gray Day,"
"Near Alameda" and "The Oaks." Those
who have secured landscapes from the
brush of Mr. Breuer may consider them
selves lucky, for the opportunity will not
be presented again for several years. He
has stored his studio furnishings and will
on January 1 leave San Francisco for an
indefinite time, going first perhaps to the
mountains where he will take a much
needed rest, thence to various parts of
California, and probably East. Mr.
Breuer does not expect to exhibit here
again for a period of three years.
J. H. Gamble sold a canvas entitled "A
Showery Day," one of his largest and
best.
C. Chapell Judson sold his much ad
mired picture. "The Wind-Swept Pines."
Two by J. Frank McComas. "The La
goon Sketch" and "An Oak Tree Study,"
both Monterey scenes, were sold.
Also the large canvas. "The House of
John Howard Payne." by Rollo Peters,
one of his characteristic moonlights. It
represents a house half shrouded py trees,
through the branches of which the glim
mer of a lamp's light shines dimly. It
varsity as of right but of privilege. Un
til this is remedied, the "expediency" of
coeducation will continue to be brought
into question.
You may contend that we should have
to change our State constitution before
we could "turn the rascals out," but
are there any women among our legis
tdrs, and have they any say in the mat
ter? No. they arc powerless, and have
no rights in the case.
No doubt improvement awaits upon the
system of education and of, coeducntion
a? at present administered, as well as
upon our political system, but whatever
the arrangement of details, the human
being must have perfect liberty of self
development along legitimate lines. This
liberty involves both coeducation and po
litical equality, which latter is merely a
further carrying out of the same princi
ple,
woman's duty to share equally In the
government not only of her own family
but c;f all the families of her community

is a very strong piece of work and one
of the most admired in his collection. Mr.
fetera, whose display was one of the
sensations of the club this year, has made
arrangements for an exhibtion of his
work to be held in Boston at the Doll &
Richards gallery in January. Later he
will exhibit at Goupll's in New York,
and in 1903 intends to show England what
American artists can do by exhibiting in
the Doudwell galleries. New Bond street,
London.
J. A. Stanton sold two. "At Low Tide"
and "A Village on the Cliff." "A Juvenile
Raid" from the brush of- M. Strauss and
om> of "Cathedral Rocks" from Thaddeus
"Welch completes the list.
Now that tho holidays are over affairs
in the world of art are righting them
selves. The artists are beginning to
think of the annual spring exhibition to
.be held in the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art. commencing March 13 and to be con
tinued one month. After that there will
be a general breaking up of winter
studios, for most of the artists are de
sirous of making a special study of spring
landscapes in the country.
Theodore Wores, whose work was
missed this year in the club exhibi
tion, has been scoring quite a success on
the islands, for his contribution to the
recent exhibition given by the Kilohana
Art League of Honolulu has received
much commendation from both public and
press. His most recent work is a portrait
of the late Paul Neumann of Honolulu, the
commission being issued from tho PaciTic
Club of that place.
Rupert Schmld. a familiar figure in the
art circles of San Francisco, has been re
ceiving many congratulatory notes upon,
the acceptance by the San Jose McKlnley
monument committee of his design for
the monument to the late President. Mr.
Schmid's work is well known on the coast,
for he has executed sculpture portraits of
many of California's best-known people,
involves her right to coeducation, using
the term in its broadest sense.
In no other country are men and wo
men such good comrades as in America,
where there is a nearer approach than
there is elsewhere to an equality of so
cial, civil and political rights.
Professor Joseph Le Conte, about a
year before his death, publicly confessed
Ills conversion to the principle of coedu
cation. Others agree with him. But
some Eastern professors who are opposed
to coeducation accept positions in our
fotate University. This is like finding wo
men serving on school boards and hold
ing different public positions who "do not
believe in woman suffrage." They are
only too willing to accept and benefit by
the rights and privileges conceded
through long and persistent agitation on
the part of other women, and yet ihey
would withhold further opportunities in
the same direction from their fellow
vvomen.
Tho national president of the American
"Woman Suffrage Association closes her
woman's century calendar with an ex
planation of the slow progress in political
rights, which she says is because "the
rame types of ignorance, bigotry, conserv
atism; prejudice and fear which have op
posed every other aten In the progress of
women's rights, but which were powerless
to say yea or nay. are endowed with full
power In grant or refuse political liberty.
Tho selfsame types of men and women
who opposed higher education, public
speaking, self-support, property owner
ship, the privilege of working in ihe re
forms and in the professions/now oppose
political rights for women: arxi the self
same types of men who have contested
each step of the onward inarch now hold
absolute authority over further advances.
Political rights for women cannot bÂ»
gained, therefore, till popular opinion is
ready to grant them."
Tn- the- case of educational liberties and
opportunities, as well as in that of other
rights, there was at first ouite as bitter
condemnation and opposition as there
now is in the case of politico! liberty, hut
it was not necessary to wait for a ma
jority vote on any of these questions: if
It had been, we should have now aÂ« fev/
college curriculums for women as wo
have equal suffrage States.
That the duties of citizenship nnd the
value of the franchise are not sufflcientlv
taught in tho universities Is shown by the
question so often asked both bv the "male
and the female graduate. "What good
would the vote do women?" Tf It ig re
plied, "It will do women the same good
that it has dono men," they ask again
"Do you think It does men any good?"
Keeping up a suffrage club in any local
ity serves mainly the purposes of agita
tion and advertisement of the subject
Senator Watson has just offered a bill
providing for an amendment to the con
stitution of the United States which shall
grant suffrage to â¢ women, but this just
and righteous measure will probably not
be effected until a majority of the States
have adopted It in their own constitutions.
President Roosevelt is a firm believer in
woman suffrage and boasts that he rec
ommer.'ded it in his message when Gov
ernor of New York State. That he did
not see fit to do so in his Presidential
message has caused universal regret
amonj the friends of eoual suffrage
throughout the country. Let us hope
that It will be otherwise in the next
Presidential message.

Governor Stanford and Professor Le
Conte. After the completion of the Mc-
Kinley monument Mr. Schmid will go to
St. Louis, where he has been selected to
execute some important sculpture for the
coming exhibition to be held at that place
in the year 1903.
Douglas Tilden has removed his studio
to Oakland, where he is at present occu
pied with several important pieces of
work. Mr. Tilden. who has had charge of
the modeling class, at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art since Its foundation, ha
resigned his professorship, feeling that
his work at present in the studio demands
more than a divided attention. â¢
The annual Bohemian Christmas jink.-?
was held In the Mark Hopkins Institute
Derember 20 by the students of that Insti
tution. The only evidence of work dis
played was the poster exhibition, which
attracted much favorable comment and
no little amount of fun for the grotesque
designs and originality shown. The large
artroom was crowded with the students
and their friends. An entertainment was
given in the evening and the affair was
thoroughly enjoyed by all present.
Some good work, both in water colors
Â»nrt black and white, was shown in the
studio exhibition at 131 Post street by Ho
ren and Haig Patigan. These two young
artists, whoso work in illustration is well
known in this city, surprised their friends
by the display of many cleverly painted
water colors. "A Monterey Scene" " \
Rocky Coast at Bakers Beach" and a
"Chinatown" by Haig Patigan were all
good, both in tone and feeling. One side

THE STORY OF A LOVE BEHIND
THE THRONE
CHAPTER XXIIIâ Continued.
THE VISITOR AT MIDNIGHT.
WE passed people, but no one knew
me. I will go if you are distressed
over my being here."
"It is not thatâ not that. Some
J=P5' may have seen you. I have a strange
fear that they suspect me and that I am
being- watched. Where is Captain Quin
xjoxr*
"He s?aid he would return for me in an
hour. The time is almost gone. How it
has flown! Yet, Yetive, I will not give
you up!" he cried, sinking to his knees
before her.
"You mustâ you shall! You must g'J
back to the monastery to-night. Oh. how
I pray that you may roach it in safety!
And you must leave this wretched coun
try at o:ice. Will you sec if Quinnox is
outside tlie door? Bo quick! I am mad
with fenr that you may be found here â
that you may be taken before you can
return to St. Valentine's."
He arose and stood looking down at the
intense face, all ;iquivcr with ths battle
between temptation and solicitude.
"I am not going back to St. Valen
tine's." he said, slowly.
"But it is all arranged for you to start
from there to-morrow. You cannot escape
the city guard except through St. Valen
tine's."
"Yetive. has it not occurred to you that
1 nay not wish to escape the city guard?"
"iljy r.ot wish to {scan? theâ what do
â¢Â»ot'. mean?" the cried, bewildered.
', "I am not going to leave Edelweiss,
dearest. It is my intention to surrender
myself to the authorities."
She sazed at him In horror for a mo
mf-at and then fell back with a low moan.
"For God's sake, do not fay that," she
Trailed. "I forbid you to think of it. You
cannot do this after all I have done to
save you. Ach, you arc jesting; I should
have Known."
He Fat down and drew her to his sld;.
Some moments passed before he could
speak.
"I cannot and will not permit you to
m.ike such a sacrifice for me. The prop-
GSStton of Bolaroz is known to me. If
you produce me for trial you aro to have
a ten y-ears' extension. My duty is plain.
I em 20 cowardly criminal and I am not
afraid to face my accusers. At the worst,
1 can die but once."
"Die but once," she repeated, as if in a
dream.
'"I came here to toll you of my decision,
to ask you to save your lands, protect
your rcople, and to remember that I
would die a thousand times to serve you
and yours."
"After all I have doneâ after all I heve
-"'(â one," she murmured, piteously. "No,
no! You shall not! You are more to me
than all my kingdom, than all the people
in the world. You have made me love
you; rou have caused me to detest the
throne which separates us; you have made
me pray that I might be a pauper, but
you f=hall not force me to destroy the mite
cf hr-pe that lingers in my heart. You
shall not crush the hope that there may
be a â a â some day!"
"A some day? Some day when vou will
be mine?" hÂ« cried.
"I will not say that, but for my sake â
for my sake â go away from this place.
Save yourself: You are all I have to live
for." Her arms were about his neck an'l
her imploring words went to his heart
like great thrusts of pain.
"You forget the thousands who love
and trust you. Do they deserve to be
wronged?"
1 "No, noâ ach. God. how I have suffered
because of them! I have betrayed them,
have stolen their rights and made them
a nation of beggar*-. But I would not,
for all this nation, have an innocent man
condemnedâ nor could my people ask
that of me. You cannot dissuade me. It
must be as I wish. Oh, why does not
Quinncx come for you!" She arose and
paced the floor distractedly.
He was revolving a selfish, cowardly
capitulation to love and injustice when a
tharp tap was heard at the door. Leap
ing to his feet he whispered:
"Quinnox! lie has come for me. Now
to get put of your room without being
spen!"
The Princess Yetive ran to him, and.
placing her hands on his shoulders, cried
with the fierceness of despair:
"You will go back to the monastery?
You will leave Graustark? For my sake â
for rny sake!"'
He hesitated and then surrendered, his
honor falling weak and faint by the path
way of oatsion.
"Yes!" he cried, hoarsely.
Tap." lap! tap! at the door. Lorry took
one lock at the rapturous face and re
icascd her.
"Come!" called.
P"'he door flew open, an attendant sa
ed and in steppedâ Gabriel!
XXIV-OFF TO THE DUNGEON:
The tableau lasted but a moment. Ga
briel advanced a few steps, his eyes
gleaming with jealousy and triumph. Be
fore him stood the petrified lovers, caught
red-har.ded. Through her dazed brain
struggled the conviction that ho could
never escape: through his ran the miser
able realization that he had ruined her
forever. Gabriel, of all men!
"I arrive inopportunely," he â  eald,
harshly, the veins standing out on his
neck and temples. "Do I intrude? I was
not aware that you expected two, your
Highness:' There was no mistaking his
meaning. He viciously sought to convey
the imDresslon that hs was there by ap
pointment,- a clandestine visitor in her
apartments at midnight.
"What do you mean by coming to my
apartment at this hour?" she stammered,
trying to rescue dignity from the chaos
cf Â«- motions. Lorry was standing slightly
to the right and several feet behind her.
He understood the Prince, and quickly
eought to interpose with the hope that he
might shi< Id her from the nting.
Gabriel's wit saved him from death. He
saw that he could not pursue the course
be had begun, for there was murder in the
Americans eye. Like a fox he swerved
and, with a servile promise of submission
in bis glance, saici:
"I thought you were here, my fine fel
low, and I came to satisfy myself. Now,
f=ir. may I ask why you are here?" Hi3
Singers twitched and his oyes were glassy
with the malevolence he was subduing.
"I am here as a prisoner," said Lorry,
boldly. Gabriel laughed derisively.
"And how often have you come here In
this manner as a prisoner? Midnight and
alone in the apartments of the Princess!
TlÂ»e guard dismissed! A prisoner, eh? Ha,
what a priFon!"
"Stop!" cried Lorry, v.hitc to the lips.
The Princess was beginning to under-
Hcr eyes grew wide with horror, her fig
ure straightened imperiously and the
white in her cheeks gave way to the red
of insulted virtue.
"I ste it all! You have not been outside
. this castle .since you left the prison. A
pretty scheme! You could not marry him,
could you, eh? He is not a Prince! But
â¢ you could bring him here and hide him
whore no one would dare to think of look
ing- for himâ in your apartments "
With a snarl of rage Lorry sprang upon
h!m, cutting short the sentence that
would heve gone through her like the
keenest knife-b!ade.
"Liar! Dog! X : U kill you for that!" he
cried, but before he could clutch the
Prince's throat Yetive had frantically
seized his arm.
"Not that!" she shrieked. "Do not kill
him! There must be no murder here!"
He reluctantly hurled Gabriel from him,
the Prince tottering to his knees in th<j
effort to keep from falling. She had saved
her mallgner's life, but courage deserted
her with the act. Helplessly she, looked
Into the blazing eyes of her lover and
faltered: * : .
"Iâ I do not know what to say or do.
My brain Is bursting!"
"Courage, courage!" he whispered gen
tly. . :
"You shall pay for this!" shrieked Ga
briel. "If you are not a prisoner you shall
be. There'll be scandal enough in Grau
stark to-morrow to start a volcano of
wrath from the royal tombs where He her
fathers. I'll see that you are a prisoner!"
He started for the door, but Lorry's pis
tol was leveled at his head.
"If j-ou move I'll kill you!"
"The world will understand how and
why I fell by your hand and in this room.
Shoot!" he cried, triumphantly.
Lorry's hand trembled and his eyes
tilled with the tears of impotent rage. The
Prince held the higher card.
A face suddenly appeared at the door,
which had been stealthily opened from
without. .Captain Quinnox glided into the
room behind the Prinze and gently closed
the door, unnoticed by the gloater.
"A prisoner?" sneered Gabriel. "Where
is your captor, pray?"
"Here!" answered a voice at his back.
The Prince wheeled and found himself
looking at the stalwart form of the cap
tain of the guard. "I am surely privileged
to .speak now, your Highness," he went
on. addressing the Princess significantly.
"How came you here?" gasped Gabriel.
"I brought my prisoner here. Where
should I be if not here to guard him?"
"Whenâ when did you enter this
room?"
"An hour ago."
"You were not here when I came!"
"I have been standing on this spot for
an hour. You have been very much ex
cited, I'll agree, but it is strange you did
i;ot see me." lied Quinnox.
Gabriel looked about helplessly, non
plused.
"You were here when I came in?" he
asked, wonderingly.
"Ask her Majesty." commanded the
captain, smiling.
"Captain Quinnox brought the prisoner
to me an hour ago," she said, mechanic
ally.
"It is a lie!" cried Gabriel. "He was
not here when I entered!"
The captain of the. guard laid a heavy
hand on the shoulder of the Prince and
said, threateningly:
"I was here and I am here. Have a
rare how you speak. "Were I to do right
I should ?hoot you like a dog. You came
like a thief, you insult the ruler of my
land. I have borne it all because you are
a Prince, but have a care â have a care.
I may forget myself and tear out your
black heart with these hands. One word
from her Highness will be your death
warrant!"
He looked inquiringly at- the Princess
as if anxious to put the dangerous wit
ness where he could tell no tales. She
shook her head, but did not speak. Lorry
realized that the time had come for him
to assert himself. Assuming a distressed
air he bowed his head and said, deject
edly:
"My pleading has been in vain, then,
my Highness. I have sworn to you that
I am Innocent of this murder, and you
Rave said I shall have a fair trial. That
ib all you can offer?"
"That is all." she said, shrilly, her mind
gradually grasping his meaning.
"You will not punish the poor people
who secreted me in their house for weeks,
for they are convinced of my innocence.
Your captain here, who found me in their
house to-night, can also speak well of
them. I have only this request to make
in return for what little sen-ice I may
have given you: Forgive the old people
who befriended me. I am ready to go to
the tower at once, captain."
Gabriel heard this speech with a skep
tical smile on his face.
"I am no fool," he said, simply. "Cap
tain." shrewdly turning to Quinnox, "if
he is your prisoner, why do you permit
him to retain his revolver?"
The conspirators were taken by sur
prise, but Lorry had found his wits.
"It is folly, your Highness, to allow
this gentleman and conquering Prince to
cross-examine you. I am a prisoner, and
that is the end of it. What odds is it to
the Prince of Dawsbergen how and where
I was caught or why your officer brought
me to you?"
"You were ordered from my house once
to-day, yet you come again likeya con
queror. I should not spare you. A'ou de
serve to lose your life for the actions of
to-night. Captain Quinnox, will you kill
him if I ask you to end his wretched
life." Yetive's eyes were blazing with
wrath, beneath which gleamed a hope
that he could be frightened into silence.
"Willinglyâ willingly!" cried Quinnox.
"Now, your Highness? 'Twere better in
the hall:"
"For God's sake, do not murder me!

Let me;go!" cringed the Prince. â¢â .
'."I do not mean' that you > should > t l kill
him now, Quinnox, but I instruct you to
do so if- he puts- foot: inside these 'walls
, again. -Do you understand?" â  â¢'â -*.:
"Yes, your Highness." : ..;.' >-.'i /.'..':/'
"Then you will place this prisoner in the
castle dungeon until to-morrow morning,
when he is to be taken to the' tower.
Prince Gabriel may accompany you to
the dungeon cell, if he likes, after which
you will escort him to the gates. If he
enters them again you are to kill him.
Take them both away!"
"Your Highness, I must ask you to
write a pardon for the good people in
whose house the prisoner was found,"
suggested Quinnox, shrewdly seeing a
chance for communication unsuspected
by the Prince.
"A moment, your Highness," said the
Prince, who had recovered himself clever
ly. "I appreciate your, position. I have
made a serious charge, and I now have a
fair proposition to suggest to you. If this
man is not produced to-morrow morning
1 take it for granted that I am at liberty
.to lell all that has hapuened in this room
(to-night. If iie is produced, I shall kneel
and beg your pardon."
The Princess turned paler than ever and
knew not how she kept from falling to
the floor. There was a long silence fol
lowing Gabriel's unexpected but fair sug
gestion.
"That is very fair, your Highness," said
Lorry. "There is no reason why I should
not be a prisoner to-morrow. I don't see
how I can hope to escape the inevitable.
Your dungeon is strong and I have given
my word of honor that I shall make no
further effort to evade the law."
"I agree," murmured the Princess,
ready to faint under the strain.
"I 'must see him delivered to Prince
Bolaroz," added Gabriel, mercilessly.
"To Bolaroz!" she repeated.
"Your Highness, the pardon for the
poor old people." reminded Quinnox. She
glided to the desk, stunned, bewildered.
It seemed as though death were upon her.
Quinnox followed and bent near her ear.
"Do not be alarmed," he whispered. "No
one knows of Mr. Lorry's presence here
save the Prince, and if he dares to ac
cuse you before Bolaroz our people will
tear him to pieces. No one will believe
him."
"You â you can save him, then?" she
gasped, joyously.
"If he will permit me to do so. Write
to him what you will, your Highness, and
he shall have the message. Be brave and
all will go well. Write quickly! This is
supposed to be the pardon."
She wrote feverishly, a thousand
thoughts arising for every one that she
was able to transfer to the paper. When
she had finished the hope Inspired scrawl
she arose and, with a gracious smile,
handed to the waiting captain the par
don for those who had secreted the fugi
tive.
"I grant forgiveness to them gladly,"
she said.
"I thank you," said Lorry, bowing low.
"Mr. Lorry, I regret the difficulty in
which you find yourself. It â was on my
account, too, I am" told. Be you guilty
or Innocent, you are my friend, my pro
tector. May God be good to you." She
gave him her hand calmly, steadily, as
if she were bestowing favor upon a sub
ject. He kissed the hand gravely.
"Forgive me for trespassing on your
good nature to-night, your Highness."
"The 5000 gravvos shall be yours to
morrow. Captain Quinnox," she said, gra
ciously. "You have done your duty well."
The faithful captain bowed deep and low
and a weight was lifted from his con
science.
"Gentlemen, the door," he said, arid
without a word the trio left the room.
She closed the door and stood like a
statue until their footsteps died away In
the distance. As one in a daze she sat
at the desk till the dawn, Grenfall Lorry's
revolver lying before her.
Through the halls, down the stairs and
into the clammy dungeon strode the silent
trio. But before Lorry stepped inside the
cell â¢ Gabriel asked a question that had
been troubling him for many minutes.
"I am afraid I haveâ ahâ misjudged
her â ". muttered Gabriel, now convinced
that he had committed himself irretriev
ably.
- "You will find she has not misjudged
you," said the prisoner, grimly, "Can't
1 have a candle in here, captain?"
"You may keep this lantern," said
Quinnox, stepping inside the narrow ceil.
As he placed the lantern on the floor he
whispered: "I will return in an hour.
.Read this!" Lorry's hand closed over
the bit of perfumed paper.
The Prince was now inside the cell,
peering about curiously, even timorously.
"By the way, your Highness, how would
you enjoy living in a hole like this all
your life?"
"Horrible!" said Gabriel, shuddering
like a leaf.
"Then take my advice; don't commit

Ho emiled, sadly as he burned the "par
don." The concluding sentences swept
away the last thought he might have had
of leaving her to bear the consequences.
"Do not think of me, but save yourself.
I would lose everything to save you."
He leaned against the stone wall and
shook his head slowly, the smile still on
his lips.
XXV-"BECAUSE I "LOVE HIM."
The next morning Edelweiss v/as astir
early. Great throngs of people flocked the
streets long before the hour set for the
signing of the decree, that was to divide
the north from the south. There were
men and women from the mountains,
from the southern ' valleys, from the
plains to the north and east. Sullen were
the mutterings, threatening the faces, re
sentful the hearts of those who crowded
the shops, the public places and the
streets. Before 9 oclock the great con
course of people began to push toward
the castle. Castle Avenue was packed
with the moving masses. Thousands upon
thousands of. this humbled race gathered
outside the walls, waiting for the news
from, the castle with the spark of hope
that does not die until the very end, nurs
ing the possibility that something might
intervene at the last moment to save the
country from disgrace and ruin^
A strong guard was required _ to keep
the mob back from the gates, and the
force of men on the wall had been quad
rupled. Business in the city was suspend
ed. The whole nation, it seemed, stood
before the -walls, awaiting, with bated
breath and dismal faces, the announce
ment that Yetive had deeded to Bolaroz
the lands and lives of half of her sub
jects. The northern plainsmen, who were
so soon to acknowledge Axphain sover
eignty, wept and wailed over their un
happy lot. Brothers and sisters from the
south cursed and moaned in sympathy.
. Shortly before 9 o'clock, Harry Anguish,
with his guard of six. rode up to the cas
tle. Captain Dangloss was beside him on
his' gray charger. They had scarcely
passed inside the gates when a cavalcade
of mounted men came riding up the ave
nue from the Hotel Regengetz. Then the
howling, the hissing, the hooting began.
Maledictions were hurled at the heads of
Axphain noblemen as they rode between
the maddened lines of people. They
smiled sardonically in reply to the im
potent signs of hatred, but they were glad
when the castle . gates closed be
tween them and the vast^ despairing
crowd, in which the tempest of revolt was
brewing with unmistakable energy.
Prince Bolaroz, the Duke of Mz
rox and the ministers were already
in the castle and had been there
since the previous afternoon. In the
royal palace the excitement was intense,
but it was of the subdued kind that
strains the nerves to the point where con
trol is martyrdom.
When the attendants went to the bed
chamber of the Princess at 7 o'clock, as
was their wont, they found, to their sur
prise, no one standing guard.
The Princess was not in her chamber,
nor had she been there during the night.
The bed was undisturbed. In some alarm
the two women ran to her parlor, then to
the boudoir. Here they found her asleep
on the divan, attired in the gown she had
worn since the evening before, now crum
pled and creased, the proof positive of a
restless, miserable night.
Her first act after awakening and un
tangling the meshes in her throbbing, un
comprehending brain, was to send for
Quinnox. She could scarcely wait for his
appearance and the assurance that Lorry
was safely out of danger. The footman
who had been sent to fetch the captain
was a long time in returning. She was
dressed in her breakfast gown long before
he came In with the report that the cap
tain was nowhere to be found. Her heart
gave a great throb of joy. She alone
could explain his absence. To her it
meant but one thing: Lorry's flight from
the castle. Where else could Quinnox be
except with the fugitive, perhaps once
more>inslde St. "< Valentine's? ' With- .the
great-load of suspense off her. mind she
cared; not for the trial that still confront
ed "her on /that -dreaded' morning. She
had" saved him and I she was . willing to
pay the price. â .. v .. , . ;
Preparations began at once , for., the
eventful . transaction | in the . throne room.
The splendor of two courts was to shine
in rivalry. Ten o'clock was 'the hour set
for the' meeting of the two rulers, the
victor and -the victim. Her nobles . and
her ladies, 'her ministers, her guards and
her. lackeys moved' about In the halls,
dreading the hour, brushing against the
hated Axphalh- guests. In one of the
small" waiting-rooms sat' the Count â¢ and
Countess " Halfont, the latter in ' tears.
The young Countess Dagmar stood atja
window with Harry Anguish.' The latter
was flushed and nervous and acted like
a- man' who 'expects that which is unex
pected . by others. .With a- strange con
fidence in his voice he sought to cheer
Iris depressed friends, .but i the cheerful
ness was, y not contagious. .,. The somberness
of a burial hung over the castle:
Half an hour before the â¢ time set i for
the meeting in the throne room Yetive
sent for her uncle, her aunt and Dagmar.
As Anguish and the latter followed the
girl turned her sad. puzzled eyes up to the
face of the tall American and asked:
"Are you rejoicing over our misfortune?
You do not show a particle of regret. Do
you forget that we are sacrificing a great
deal to save the life of your friend? I do
not understand how you can be so heart
less."
"If you knew what I know you'd jump
so high you could crack those pretty heels
of yours together ten times before you
touched the floor again," said he, warmly.
"Please tell me," s^he cried. "I knew
there was something."
"But I am afraid so high a jump would
upset you for the day. You must wait
awhile, Dagmar." It was the first time
he had called her Dagmar, and she looked
startled.
"I am not used to waiting,'" she said,
confusedly.
"I think. I can explain satisfactorily
when I have more time," he said, softly,
in her ear, and although she tried she
could find no words to continue.
He left her at the head of the stairs and
did not see her again until she passed him
in the throne room. Then she was pale
and brave and trembling.
Prince Bolaroz and his nobles stood to
the right of the throne, the Graustark
men and women of degree to the left,
while near the door on both sides were to
be seen the leading military men of both
principalities. Near the Duke of Mizrox
was stationed the figure of Gabriel,
Prince of Dawsbergen. He had come with
a half-dozen followers among a crowd of
unsuspecting Axphainians. and had taken
his position near the throne. Anguish en
tered with Baron Dangloss and they
stood together near the doorway, the lat
ter whiter than he had ever been in his
life.
Then came the hush of expectancy. The
doors swung open, the curtains parted
and the Princess entered.
She was supported by the arm of her
tall uncle, Caspar of Halfont. Pages car
ried the train of her dress, a jeweled gown
of black. As she-advanced to the throne,
calm and stately, those assembled bent
knee to the fairest woman the eye ever
had looked upon.
The calm, proud exterior hid the most
unhappy of hearts. The resolute courage
with which her spirit had been braced
for the occasion was remarkable in more
ways than one. Among other inspira
tions behind the valiant show was the
bravery of a guilty conscience. Her
composure .sustained a shock when she
passed Allode at the door. That faithful,
heart-broken servitor looked at her face
with pleading, horror-struck eyes as much
as to say: "Good God, are you going to
destroy Graustark for the sake of that
murderer? Have pity on usâ have pity!"
Before taking her seat on the throne,
â she swept the thrilled assemblage with
her wide blue eyes. There were shadows
beneath them and there were wells of
tears behind them. As she looked upon
the little knot of white-faced northern
barons, her knees trembled and her heart
gave a great throb of pity. Still the face
was resolute. Then she saw Anguish and
the suffering Dangloss; then the accus
ing, merciless eyes of Gabriel. At sight
of him she started violently and an icy
fear crept into her soul. Instinctively
she searched the gorgeous company for
the captain of the guard. Her'staunchest
ally was not there. Was she to hear the
condemning words alone? W r ould the peo
ple do as Quinnox had prophesied, or
would they believe Gabriel and curse her?
She sank into the great chair and sat
with staring, helpless eyes, deserted and
feeble.
At last the whirling brain ended Its
flight and settled down to the issue at
handâ the transaction with Bolaroz. Sum
moning all her self-control, she said:
"You are come, most noble Bolaroz, to
draw from us the price of our defeat. We
are loyal to our compact, as you are to
yours, sire. Yet, in the presence of my
people and in 'the name of mercy and
â¢justice, I ask you to grant us respite.
You are rich and powerful, we despoiled
and struggling beneath a weight we can
lift and displace if given a few short
years \ In , which to grow and gather
strength.' At this last hour in the fifteen
years of , omvindebtedness. I sue in sup
plication for the leniency that you can so
well accord. It is on the advice of my
counselors that^1 put away personal pride
and national dignity to. make this request,
trusting to your goodness of heart. If
you will-; not hearken to our petition for
a' renewal of. negotiations, there is but
one course ' opeiv; to Graustark. We can
and will pay ourÂ«debt of honor."
Bolaroz stood before her, dark and un
compromising. , She saw the futility of
her plea. .
, "I have ,'hot" forgotten, most noble peti
tioner, that you are ruler here, not I.
Therefore I am in no way responsible for
the conditions which confront you, except
that I am an honest creditor, come for his
honest dues. This is the twentieth of
November. You have had fifteen years
to accumulate enough to meet
the requirements of this day. Should I
suffer for your faults? There is in the
tieaty a provision which applies to an
emergency of this kind. Your inability to
liquidate In gold does not prevent the pay
ment of this honest debt in land, as pro
vided for in the sixth clause of the agree
ment. 'All that part of Graustark north
of a line drawn directly from east to
v.(st between the provinces of Ganlook
and Doswan, a tract comprising Doswan,
Shellotz, Varagan, Oeswald, Sesmai and
Gattabatton. You have two alternatives,
your Majesty. Produce the gold or sign
the decree ceding to AxphaJn the lands
stipulated in the treaty. I can grant no
respite.!'
"You'' knew when that treaty was
â¢ framed that we could raise no such funds
in fifteen years," said Halfont, forgetting
himself in his indignation. Gaspon and
other men present approved his hasty
declaration.
"Am I dealing- with the Princess of
Graustark or with you, sir?" asked Bo
â¢laroz, roughly.
"You are dealing with the people of
Graustark. and among the poorest. I. I
â¢will sign the decree. There is nothing to
be gained by appealing to you. The pa
pers, Gaspon, quick! I would have this
transaction finished speedily." cried the
Princess, her cheeks flushing and her
eyes glov /ing from the flames of a burn
ing conscience. The groan that went up
from the northern nobles cut her like the
slash of a knife.
"There was one other condition." said
Bolaroz. hastily, unable to gloat as he
had expected. "The* recapture of the as
sassin who slew my son would have meant
much to Graustark. It is unfortunate
that your police department is so ineffi
cient." Dangloss -writhed beneath this
thrust. Yetive's eyes went to him, for
an instant, sorrowfully. Then they
dropped to the fatal document which
Gaspon has placed on the table before her.
The lines ran together and were the color
of blood. Unconsciously she took up the
pen in her nerveless fingers. A deep sob
came from the breast of her gray old
uncle, and Gaspon's hand shook life a leaf
as he placed the seal of Graustark on the
table, ready for use.
"The assassin's life could have saved
you," went on Bolaroz, a vengeful glare
coming to his eyes.
She looked up and her lips moved as If
she would have spoken. No words came,
no breath, it seemed to her. Casting a
piteous, hunted glance over the
faces before her, she bent ftsr
ward and blindly touched the pen to
the paper. The silence was that of death.
Before she could make the first stroke
a harsh voice, in which there was com
bined triumph and amazement, broke the
stillness like the clanging of a bell.
"Have you no honor?"
The pen dropped from her fingers as
the expected condemnation came. Every
eye in the house was turned toward the
white, twitching face of Gabriel of Daws
bergen. He stood a little apart from his
friends, his finger pointed throneward.
The Princess stared at the nemesislikc
figure for an Instant, as if petrified. Then
the pent-up fear crowded everything out
of its path. In sheer desperation, her
eyes flashing with the Intensity of defiant
guilt, bitter rage welling up against h:r
persecutor, she half arose and cried:
"Who uttered those words? Speak!"
"I Gabriel. of Dawsbergen! Where is
the prisoner, madam?" rang out the
voice. ,
"The man Is mad!" cried she, sinking
back with a shudder.
"Mad eh? Because I do as I did prom
ise? Behold the queen of perfidy!
Madam, I will be heard. Lorry la In th!i
castle!"
"Ha is mad!" gasped Bolaroz, the first
of the stunned spectators to flild his
tongue.
There was a commotion near the door.
VoiC33 were heard outside.
"Yaw heve been duped!" Insisted Ga
briel, taking several steps toward the
throne: "Your idol ia a traitress, a de
ceiver! I say he is here! She has seen
him. Let her sign that decree if she
dares! I command you, Yctive of Grau
stark, to produce this criminal!"
The impulse to crush the defiler was
checked by the sudden appearance of two
men irside the curtains.
"He is here!" cried a strong voice, and
Lorry, breathless and haggard, pushed
through the astonished crowd, followed
by Captain Quinnox. upon whose ghastly
face there were bloodstains.
A shcut went up from those assembled,
a shout of joy. The faces of Danglosa
and Allode were pictures of astonish
ment andâ it must be saidâ relief. Harry
Anguish staggered, but recovered him
self instantly, and turned hia eye3 to
ward Gabriel. That worthy's legg trem
bled and his jaw dropped.
"I have the prisoner, your Majesty."
said Quinnox, in hoarse, discordant tones.
He stood before the throne with his cap
tive, but dared not look his mia
.tress in the face. As they stood
there the story of the night just
passed was told by the condition of the
two men. There had been a struggle for
supremacy in the dungeon and the pris
oner had won. The one had tried to hold
the other to the dungeon's safety, after
his refusal to leave the castle, and ths
other had fought his way to the halls
above. It was then that Quinnox had wit
enough to change front and drag his
prisoner to the place which, most of all.
he had wished to avoid.
"The prisoner!" shouted ths northern
nobles, and in an Instant the solemn
throne room was wild with excitement.
"Do not sign that decree!" cried some
one from a far corner.
"Here is your man, Prince Bolaroz!" 1
cried a Baron.
"Quinnox has saved us!" shouted an
other.
The Princess, white as death and as
motionless, sat bolt upright in her royal
seat.
"Oh!" she moaned piteously, and.
clenching her hands, she carried them
to her eyes as if to shut out the sight.
The Countess Halfont and Dagmar ran
to her side, the latter frantic with alarm.
She knew more than the others.
"Are you the fugitive?" cried Bolaroz.
"I am Grenfall Lorry. Are you Bo
laroz?"
"The father of the man you murdered.
Ah. this is rapture!"
"I have only to say to you. Prince, 1
did not kill your son. I swear it, so help
me Gcd!"
"Your Highness," cried Bolaroz, step
ping to the throne, "destroy that decree.
This brave soldier has saved Graustark.
In an hour your Ministers and mine will
have drawn up a ten years' extension of
time, in proper form, to which my sig
nature shall be gladly attached. I have
not forgotten my promise."
Yetive straightened suddenly, se'.zecl the
pen and fiercely began to si?n the decree,
in spite of all and before those about her
fairly realised her Intention. Lorry un
derstood, and was the first to snatch the
document from her hands. A half-writ
ten Yetive, a blot and a long 1 , spluttering
.scratch of the pen told how near she had
come to signing away the lands of Grau

be of no benefit to the prisoner she loved.
"Yetive!" gasped her uncle, in horror.
"She would have signed !" cried Gaspon.
in wonder and alarm.
"Yes. I would have signed!" she ex
claimed, starting to her feet, strong
and defiant. "I could not have saved
his life, perhaps, but I might have
saved him from the cruel injustice
that that man's vengeance would have in
vented. He is innocent, and I would give
my kingdom to stay the wrong that will
be done."
"What! You defend the dog!" cried
Bolaroz. "Seize him. men! I will see that
justice is done. It is no girl he has to deal
with now."
"Stop!" cried the Princess, the command
checking the men. Quinnox leaped in front
of his charge. "He is my prisoner, and he
shall have justice. Keep back your sol
tHery, Prince Bolaroz. It is a girl you hav<s
to deal with. I will -say to you all, ray
people and yours, that I believe him to
be Innocent and that I sincerely regret his
capture, fortunate as it may be for us. He
shall have a fair and a just trial, and I
shall do all in my power. Prince BoIejo*.
to secure his acquittal."
"Why do you take this stand. Yetive?
Why have j^>u tried to shield him?" cried
the heart-broken Halfont.
She drew herself to her full height, and.
sweeping the threatening crowd with a
challenge in her eyes, cried, the tones
ringing strong and clear above the grow
ing tumult:
"Because I love him!"
As if by magic the room became sud
denly still.
"Behold an honest man. I would have
saved him at the cost of my honor. Scorn
me if you will, but listen to this. The man
who stands here accused came voluntarily
to this castle, surrendering himself to
Captain Quinnox, that he might, though
innocent, stand between us and disaster.
He was safe from our pursuit, yet re
turned, perhaps to his death. For me. for
you and for Graustark he has done this,
la there a man among you who would
have done as much for h:s own country?
Yet he does this for a country to which
he is a stranger. I must commit him to
prison once more. But," she cried in sud
den fierceness, "I promise him now, before
the trial, a royal pardon. Do I make my
meaning clear to you, Prince Bolaroz?"
The white lips of the old Prince could
frame no reply to this daring speech.
"Be careful what you say. your High
ness," cried the prisoner, hastily. "I must
refuse to accept a pardon at the cost of
your honor. It is because I love you bet
ter than my life that I stand here. I can
not allow you and your people to suffer
when it is in my power to prevent ft. All
that I can ask is fairness and justice. I
am not guilty, and God wiil protect me.
Prince Bolaroz, I call upon you to keep
your promise. I am -not the slayer of
your son, but I am the man you would
send to the block, guilty or Innocent."
As he spoke the Princess dropped back
in the chair, her rash courage gone. A
stir near the doorway followed this con
cluding sentence, and the other American
stepped forward, his lace showing his ex
citement.
"Your Highness," he said, "I should
have spoken sooner. My lips were parted
and ready to cry out when Prince Gabriel
interposed and prevented the signing of
the decree. Grenfall Lorry did not kill
the young Prince. I can produce the
XXVI-THE GUESSING OF ANGUISH. -
The startling assertion created a fresh
sensation. Sensations had come so thick
and so fast, however, that they seemed
component parts of one grand bewildering:
climax. The new actor in the drama held
the center of the stage undisputed.
"Harry!" cried Lorn'.
"Prince Gabriel, who do you shake like
a leaf? Is it because you know what I
am , going to say?" exclaimed Anguish,
pointing his finger accusingly at the as
tonished Prince of Dawsbergen.
(Concluded Next Week.)IT was the first night of the China
New Year. Chung Goy ran as fast at
his Eandals would permit up the nar
row eight of stairs which led to tht
Chinese restaurant, and out on thÂ«
balcony, where the crowd of Celestlali
were watching for tb,e great procession ol
the dragon. His little legs, encased
in pale green trousers, were tied ai
the Â£_r.kles, and his lavender ehoir
(blouse) gleamed In the light of the mans
drag-on lanterns swaying In thÂ© nighf
breeze. His hair â¢was in a long Queue and
*^his head he â wore a little round black
J inese cap with a button on top. Chung
Goy was bo afraid he would miss seeing
the dragon. He had never seen it yet,
for be was not very old, and now that the
loos expected moment had come he fairly
trembled with excitement.
Ills Ho Chun (father) was on the bal
ccny and he hurried to nestle up to him.
as It was cold and the wind was always
blowing in San Francisco. It seemed as
if the procession would never come. He
grew tired watching so many people pass,
and perhaps the fumes of the opium Ho
Chun was smoking got into his brain, but
at any rate the first thing he knew he saw
a great, squirmy thing approaching him.
It was spitting fire from its eyes
and mouth and at first he felt afraid. Oh,
what a dreadful monster! It would eui-ely
devour him. He heard himself saying:
"Velly bad snakeâ I no likee. Go 'way.
I "fiaid."
And *hen he heard a voice like the mut
tering of thunder, and the voice came
out of the dragon's mouth, and it was
saying in the Chinese language: "Samen
k'ai (little boy), I have come to take you
U> Dragon Land. Slip away from Ho
Chun and fly with me."
â¢'Oh, no," gasped the trembling boy.
â¢"I velly much 'flaid the big dlagon eat
Tr.e up." And then the dragon spoke
again, but this time the voice was as soft
and sweet as music, and the fire no longer
came from his eyes and mouth.
He had such a. kind look on his face,
too, and spoke in such a persuasive tone
that the samen jai ceased to be afraid,
and slipping down from nls father he ran
down the narrow steps again and out into
the street and climbed upon the big
dragon's back, and then he Baw lots of
other Chinese boys doing the same thing.
He held on tightly, for the dragon went
in such a squirming way that he was
afraid he would fall off. And he held on
to his little silk cap as the dragon's speed
increased, for it was his best one, and
he did not wish to lose it.
Oh, this was Jolly! He had certainly
never thought that he would ever ride on
the dragon's back. And what a lot he
would have to tell Mo Chun (mother)
when he reached home. It was a good
thing Mo Chun did not know it now, he
to himself, or she would be "velly
fendi 'flaid." After squirming through
all sorts of queer countries the big dragon
stopped so suddenly that they all fell off
his back and down his slippery sides.
Chung Goy rubbed his eyes and looked
e round him, and oh, how funny! There
were just thousands of dragons of aJl
sizes, and this beautiful place was their
home. They all had such kind faces and
spoke in such a gentle way that no one
could feel afraid. There were great groves
of orange trees, all full of the mandarin,
the tiny flat Chinese orange. Chung Goy
just loved those "ollanges," but he had
never before picked them from a tree.
Ho Chun had always bought them from
the street stands In Chinatown. Then
there were trees of 11 chee (nuts) and
long tables just filled with Chinese candy,
delicious preserved ginger, watermelon
and all those good things so dear to the
heart of a Chinese child.
It was night, but the trees were bo' full
of the great dragon lanterns that it made
tt almost as light as day, and there were
::o dark corners anywhere. There was a
dragon orchestra under one of the trees
and they were playing the loveliest Chi
nese music, and the shrill piping of the
fageolets and the beating of the tom-
Cfis were Indeed beautiful to the cars
or Chung Goy and his friends. And it
'ooked too funny for anything to see dra
gons holding the different instruments
with their claws. The Chinese children
;:1! marched In a row to the music, hold
ing each other by the queue. Chung Goy
ii&d never had eo much fun In his little
UJe as he was having now. But just as he
v.^s beginning to feel huVigry there ap-
P'-ared before his gaze a very long table,
just filled with everything that a child
< oulfl possibly want, and all served by
the ounningest little dragons.
There were such dainty little china
oups without handles, and in them the
most delicious chah (tea). Everybody
higgled all the time, in that funny little
Chinese way, and no one told them to
stop. While they were Bitting at the
i&ble the dragons brought them each a
big basket of fireworks. Now. a Chinese
< hUd is even more fond of fireworks than
an American child, and so they kicked
â¢op their little sandals with delight, and
afler each one had been given a lighted
Ofinese punk, they began to pop the
crackers, and oh. what fun It was! There
was such a delightful noise, with so many
popping, and the odor of the .punks was
most pleasant- It eeemed like the more
they popped the more they had left in
.their baskets. Finally, the big king of
the dragons said he must take them
home now, or he would not be back ir
time for the New lear procession, and
it would never do to disappoint the people.
So each one was allowed to keep his
basket, as a New Year's gift, and squirm
ing away again, they at last entered the
narrow streets of Chinatown, with its
rows of dragon lanterns and its odor of
Incense everywhere. Once more hâ¬
climbed the narrow steps, and crept intc
the arms of Ho Chun. It seemed he had
not noticed his ab&ence, and he arrived
just in time, for just then there was a
great noise of tom-toms and crowds
shouting. The streets were aglare with
a strange red light, and looking down he
saw the familiar form of the King Drag
on. Now he was Epitting fire from his
eyes and mouth, but this time little
Chung Goy was not afraid, for he knewâ
he knew. JESSIE JULIET KNOX.

a-way. but thar' 6 folks who sort o makes
sadness a speshulty, women folks, lots of
'em, who allows that what I'm about to
recount to you all possesses them ele
ments of sorrow a whole lot. It's like
this:
" 'Thar's a young captainâ he ain't
more'n a boyâ who's brought a troop of
lancers along with us. This boy captain
hails from some'ers up 'round Waco, an*
thar ain't a handsomer or braver than
what he is in all Pres'dent Davis' army.
This captainâ whose name is Edsonâ an'
me bein' we-all is both young, works
ourse'fs into a clost friendship for each
other; which I feels about him Jike he's

him an* me done talks of that mother an'
sweetheart of his a hundred times.
"â¢It falls out that whar we fords the

the "Plaza Chico," they-all calls it-an'
we camps thar by the river a week, giv
in' our cattle a chance to roll an' recoop

with Edson an' them gallant lancers. ,
" 'Our old war chief who has charge of

poet observes, whoever buckles on a set

" 'The Old man makes him loose an'

" '. "Joe," he says to me as we rides
along, or mebby after we're in camp at
night, "I'll never go back to Texas. I've
been disgraced at the head of my troop an'
I'll take no sech record home."
" ' "You oughter not talk that a-way,
Ed," I'd say, tryin' to, get his sensibilities
soothed an' bedded down. "If you don'{
care none for yourse'f or your footure,
you-all should remember thar's somethin
comin' to them loved ones at home. More
over, it's plumb weak about sayln' you
all ain't goin' back to Texas no more.
How be you goin' to he'p it, onless you
pi.es up shore enough disgrace by desert-

" â¢ "Which If we has the luck," says
this Captain Edson, shakin" his head pien
ty downcast, \'to cut the trail of any
Yanks who's capable of aimin' low, an'
shootin' halfway troo,. I'll find a way to
dodge that goin' back without desertin'."
" 'No, I don't make no argyments with
him; it's hopeless talkin' to a gent who's
melancholy an' who's pride's been jarred;
thar's nothin' but time can fix things up
for him. An' I allers allows that thi3
boy captain would have emerged, from
them clouds eventooal, only it happens
he don't get time enough. .His chance
comes too soon; : an' he shorely plays it
plumb desperate;
" 'Our- first . offlshal act after reachln';

of 'em, I reckons. We rides up on these

They're about a mile away, an' at sijrlr

as they-all fights like infantry, an' is

an' a heap disgusted to think -we've got
to flght for our night's camp, an* I'm

to set profane examples to my men, at
the idee that these yere Yanks is so pree

their war jig. But I can't he'p myse'f.
That proverb about it takln' two to make

make a flght. As far as we-all rebs is
concerned that time, we ain't honin' none
for trouble, leastwise, not until mornin',
but them inordinate Yanks will have it,
an' thar you be. That flght can't be .post

" 'Thar's no tumblin' hurry about how
any of us goes to work. Both sides has
got some old at the game, an' war ain't
the novelty she is once. Them Yanks is
takin' their p'sition, an'we're locatin' our

excitement than if it's dress p'rade. The
Yanks is from. Colorado. My sergeant
speaks of 'em to me the next day an'
gives his opinions touchin' their merits.
" ' "Where did you say them Yankees

my sergeant, "when

PERFECT IMITATION
OF AURORA BOREALIS
JX? FOREIGN scientist has recently

the positive wire Into contact with the
surface of the water or slightly belcm It
he has succeeded in creating the perfect
aurora bbrealls or northern lights we
have seen In the sky with such wonder
and admiration.
The flickering streamers, now faint, now
brillliant; the dark arc or half circle
from which they flowâ all the varied phe
nomena that have puzzled the mind of
the observer are accurately repeated on
a small scale.
M. Plante thinks that the aurora of our
northern skies is produced by a flow of
positive electricity- through the upper re
gions of the air into 1'anetary space, the
fact that lightning and other similar phe

regions showing that the discharge la not

He believes that all the planets aro
charged with positive electricity and that
this flows out from the neighborhood of
their magnetic polea. "When it meets no
resistance it goes off in obscure rays, but
â when it encounters masses of vapor then
it becomes the glorious aurora.
These mysterious lights, waving and
dancing In the northern sky, have always
been a marvel and a puzzle to mankind
and any information that we can gain

LONDON. Dec. 28.â The War Office
this afternoon issued a list of the
British casualties at Zeefontein
on December Â£4, when Colonel
Firman's camp, consisting of
three companies of yeomanry and two
guns, was successfully rushed by a Boer
commando under General Dewet. The list

British.
Simultaneously with the foregoing news
the War Office gave out a. dispatch from
Lord Kitchener noting a minor success of
the South African constabulary, who raid

Boors.
Boers Surprise the Camp.
In a subsequent message Lord Kitch

their tents the Boers swooped through
the camp, shooting the soldiers as they
came out. Most of the British officers
were shot while trying to stem the rush.
Lieutenant Harwich himself opened fire
with the "pompoms" and was shot
through the heart while fighting. Lieu
tenant Watney was killed while leading
a charge.
There was no panic and all engaged did
their best; but once the picket was over

had all the advantage.

Including the killed and wounded, about
half the column is now at Elands River

Lieutenant Scarlett, who was wounded,
was overlooked by the Boers and left be

VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 28.â Twenty
Japanese were drowned or burled inex
tricably under a mass of debris, one man
was killed in the logging woods up the
coast, while a Lulu Island farmer died
from exposure.
These are additional fatalities recorded
to-day as the result of one of the great
est storms In the history of the coast. A
reckoning of the Japanese residents of
Steveston was taken to-day to estimate
the number who must have perished in
the wreck of a large boarding-house at
the mouth of the Fraser River near the
Cleeve Company's fishing station. It is
certain that there were at least twenty
men In the building and- perhaps more
and not one escaped. â 
The boarding-houÂ§Â£ In which the men
were was built on high piles a mile and
a half from shore. One by one the sup
ports were knocked .from under It and
at S o'clock Thursday morning the build

The waves were'~runnlng very , high over

when It dropped, was engulfed. . .
Japanese Surely Lost. - '
The falling of the house .was observed
from Point .Roberts,* to which place tel
ephonic communication, was established
to-day. Nothing but kindling wood Is left
of the main building and there Is not a
possible chance of one of the' score or
more of inmates reaching shore.
The only fatality up the coast was the
killing of George Clark, a logger. He
was In a small cabin in the woods with
two men named Crockford and Cooper.
The fury of the gale at 2 o'clock In the
morning caused Cooper to leave the shack
for higher ground, out of the reach of
the trees, but the others stayed behind.
After he had gone Clark arose and com
menced to lay a flre In the stove. At the
time Crockford still remained in bed.
While Clark was on his knees before the
fire there was a tremendous crash and
without a moment's warning the roof of
the cabin fell in.
Others In the camp heard the noise, and
when they reached the scene they found
the cabin smashed to kindling wood and
Clark dead, while Crockford was pinned
down in his bed by a limb of a tree which
had fallen on the hut. The tree was a
monster and it had two forks. One- of
these had crushed Glark to death and
the other had pinned Crockford down,
but, luckily for him, he was uninjured. It
took some time to extricate Crackford,
and those who rescued him state that it
is a miracle that he, too, was not killed.
Had the fork of the tree gone another
three inches lower his body would have
been crushed to a pulp.
Caught by the Tide.
This morning the body of a farmer
named Theodore Hewitt of Lulu Island
was found in a pool of water half a mile
away from the river. He had evidently
been going home when he found that tho
Incoming tide which broke over the dykes
had surrounded \ him â  with water. He
probably laid down, and becoming be
numbed went to sleep an<J died either
from exposure or from drowning by the

the steamship Tees. The island is a mile
In extent and was formerly covered with
a growth of fir trees clinging to the rocky
sides. There is not now even a tree re
maining and everything above the face
of the rock was stripped clean. Fifty
natives who lived in a little village all
camped under the lee side of the island
and ' saw their tepees carried away and
some of them blown bodily a . hundred
yards from the shore. The quarry build
ings were . on j the exposed side and they
were demolished. The whole vicinity is
strewn . with lumber and uncut logs and
navigation Is difficult for that reason.
The Tees put into Alert Bay, a short
distance away, and there found the

compelled to start away for Seattle.

BATTLESHIP MISSOURI SLIDES FROM WAYS
AT NEWPORT NEWS SHIPYARD WHILE CHEERS
OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND SPECTATORS RESOUND
Miss Marion Cockrell Breaks the Traditional Bottle of Cham
page and at the Post-Launching Banquet Secretary Long
Urges the Need of Increasing the Navy of the United States
NEWPORT NEWS, Va,, Dec. 2S.-4
The battleship Missouri was
launched at the shipyard here
to-day at 11:12 o'clock. Fifteen
thousand persons, it is estimat-.
ed, saw the defender go into the water.
The launching passed off without a hitch
and none prettier or more successful was
ever accomplished, here. Miss Marion
Cockrell, daughter of Senator F. M. Cock
rell of Missouri, was sponsor for the ship
and she performed the duty assigned her
with the traditional bottle of champagne,
using a bottle of Missouri product' for
the purpose.
The number of distinguished guests
gathered around the sponsor on ." the
christening platform was larger than
ever seen here before. Among them were
Secretary of the Navy Long, Secretary of
the Interior Hitchcock; Rear Admiral
Melville," U. S. N., chief of the Bureau of
Steam Engineering; Rear Admiral O'Neill,
U.S. N., chief of ordnance: Judge Ad
vocate Lemly, U. S. N. ; Lieutenant Gov
ernor J. A. Lee of Missouri, acting for
Governor Dockery; Governor Tyler of
Virginia; Corwin H. Spencer of St. Louis,
representing the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position Company; Congressman Rixey,
representing the House Committee on
Naval Affairs; Senator Cockrell, and a
number of army and navy officers.
Mrs. Roosevelt, wife of President
Roosevelt, came up from Old Point Com
fort on the United States dispatch boat
Dolphin, with her guests, and viewed the
launching from the steamer's deck.
Cheers for Battleship's Sponsor.
When the big ship had glided off the
ways into the water the crowd on the
guests' platform gave three cheers for
Miss Cockrell, three for the army and
navy, three for Secretary Long and three
for the shipyard.
After inspecting the various depart
ments of the plant the guests repaired to
the shipyard â wharf, where they boarded
the steamer Washington, going to Old
Point Comfort. At the Chamberlain
Hotel this afternoon the customary post
launching banquet was given, the guest*
heretofore mentioned being on the pro
gramme â  as the principal speakers. Hon.
John D. Long spoke In part as follows:
"I have been interested in the circular
signed by many eminent citizens, my be
loved friend E. E. Hale at the head, in
which they regret the estimate of $100,
000,000 for the increase of the navy. The
size of the navy, if there is to be a navy
at all, Is a question, like the tariff, of ad
justment rather than of principle. Of
course, it is rather a taking thing to say
as a matter of theory, as this circular
says, that $100,000,000 for the navy means
a tax of $6 on every family in the United
States. And yet, on the other hand, as
a -matter, of fact. If that sum is spent
there Is probably, â  not * a family in the
United States ..'whose future Income could
be shown to bo $.6 less,. and there are a
good many families whose Income would
be $6 more, and still more families whose
income would be : many, times $6 less if it
were not spent.. It is also rather a. taking
thing to say that $100,000,000 could be bet
ter spent for education or 'charity. I And
yet, on the other hand,', $100,000,000 spent
in the employnient of ' labor is the very
best use to which it could be put.
Returns to the People.
"The great question of the day as to
wealth is its distribution. "While few
would say that the community should be
taxed for the sole purpose of distributing
the proceeds of taxation, yet it is some
comfort to know of a tax which,^when it
is laid on the community, all returns
again to it. If $100,000,000 should be appro
priated for the navy by the present Con
gress a small part I will .â  go f or ';' the pur
chase of raw material and something for
salaries, but the great bulk, of it for labor
in every part of the Union. : .
"Somehow it : just now., happens that
with larger revenues than we have ever
had before in time of peace,-, and there
fore with more direct and indirect taxa
tion, there is more prosperity . and more
money in the' pocket of the citizen than
ever before. Students may speculate over
the economic causes, but this' is the
'demnitlon total.'
.- "Undoubtedly. yUncle Sam ought to re
duce taxation' wherever he can. On- the
other hand, it is shrewd and wise in him
to run things so as to keep business good,
and if as a result his income is large he
confers much more benefit by. spending
it than he would by hiding â  it. . Whenever
the interests of the country require he
should reduce his receipts, but as they
are now excessive, .the. great Question
seems to be how he shall get the proceeds
back among the people. 'But if this year,
having a surplus, he spends $100,000,000 for
the navy, let us remember that, while it
is spent under that name . it is .really
spent,; as I" said before, in the employ
ment of the people's labor and in the-pur
chase of the material they have : to. sell,
and the people get rather. more out of it
than the navy does, for they get it all
back attain. ' ..â â _-
"Nor is it true, as suggested in the cir
cular, that a great navy necessarily in
flames the fighting spirit and leads to
war. If . my recollection' serves me right,
while Great Britain has had troubles in
Egypt and Africa and elsewhere, she has
had no conflict on sea for many years,
and yet her navy' has been twice as large
as that of any other power. .The recent
increase in our navy did not induce the
war with Spain, which seems to have
been inevitable. On the other hand, it Is
more than- likely that if in the begin
ning of 189S we had even as large a navy
as we have how, certainly as large a one
as now proposed, there would have been
no war with Spain and that country would
have come to terms, as she was very near
; coming without battle. At that time, no w-

ever, it was the general impression among
foreign powers, and probably in Spain,
that her navy would blow us out of the
water. â /'. â¢ ':<
"In determining the question what shall
be the size of our navy there are a great
many things to be considered, some of
which I have referred to.
"For instance, our world relations have
expanded vastly in the last three years in
territorial extent, and vastly more in in
ternational extent It has not been an
expansion upon the continent, but upon
the ocean Itself and the Islands of the sea
in both hemispheres. Our commerce has
greatly increased in volume and area and
our American marine is likely to follow
suit. As on land, so on ocean, as you ex
tend your commerce so you must expand
your police force. If there is to be a navy
at all it should be commensurate with all
these extended relations and demands.
"We are the richest nation in the world,
with a larger Income than any other. If,
then, the size of our navy should corres
pond to our national and International
size, and we have the cash on hand, it
would seem the simolest good business
sense, the simplest good business care of
our own interests, to increase our navy,
and whether this shall cost $20,000,000 or
$75,000,000 or 5100,000.000, It is not an extrav
agance to cut our garment according; to
our cloth, especially as last year there
was no appropriation for such an in
crease. It is like the rich man grading
his expenditures to his income and thus
making it serve the general welfare aa
well as his own. It Is like having police
men enough instead of having a number
so limited that the rough are tempted to
riot." % . â  . â :
A toast to the President was drunk
standing. It was responded to by Secre
tary Hitchcock, who bore to the gather
ing the greetings of President Roosevelt
and his regrets at not being present.
Applause greeted Senator Francis M.

trimmed with orange blossoms. Senator
Depew, who was radiantly happy, wore a
white flower at his button-hole. -
The bride and bridegroom gave the re
sponses in a low tone. The groom when
he placed the ring upon the bride's finger
affectionately retained her hand for a
few moments. The service lasted a quar

VENEZUELA AND GERMANY DRIFTING NEARER
TO WAR WHILE REVOLUTIONISTS MAKE GAINS
IN CAMPAIGN AGAINST CASTRO GOVERNMENT
Argentina May Yet
Go to War With
Chile.
Objects to Features
of the Peace
Protocol.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.-Of
ficial advices recefc-ed In
diplomatic quarters hero ln
dlcato that the Chile-Argen
tina controversy is again
opened. According to these advices
the peace protocol referring the whole
subject to arbitration was signed at
Santiago three days ago. But tho
action of the Argentina Minister In
placing his signature to the document
seems to have caused resentment at
Buenos Ayres, both among the prominent
officials and the people. Accordingly, on
yesterday, the Argentina Minister inform
ed the Chilean Foreign Office that he was
unable to concur in all the terms which
had been agreed upon heretofore and
signed. In particular he epecifled two
points on which the Argentina Govern
ment refused to subscribe; first, the with
drawal of police from the Ultima Esper
anza province, and second, the submission
to King Edward VII of England. The
formal refusal of Argentina to sign has
not yet been submitted, but the informal,
statement of the Minister to the" Chilean
Foreign Office is regarded as a serious in
terruption, if not a termination of the
proposed settlement.
The riotous demonstrations which oc
curred in the streets of Buenos Ayres last
night are thought to have resulted from
the signing of this protocol and to have
been expressive of possible disapproval of
the settlement with Chile. The popular
sentiment in Argentina is very warlike
and this leads to the belief in well posted
quarters that President Roca will not suc
ceed in any policy which contemplated an
adjustment with Chile.
The Chilean Charge d* Affaires, Senor
Infante, said to-day:
I note a published statement to the
effect that Argentina looked upon the recent
protocol as an evidence of her very pacific
tendencies, in that it yielded what she re
garded as her unquestionable rights in the
Ultima Esperanza district. As a result the
district has been in the undisputed possession
of Chile for some time. Our police were there,
and so when it came to a question of arrang
ing a status quo, pending a final settlement,
an understanding: was reached that the Juris
diction of Chile should be maintained in Ultima.
Esperanza territory. In these circumstances
it Is difficult to see how Argentina has yielded
any unquestionable right, for if there has been
any yielding In the Interests of continued peace
it has been through the considerateness of
Chile.
DESERTIONS FROM ARMY
ARE ON" THE INCREASE
Major General Otis Calls Attention
to the Hatter in His Annual
Report.
CHICAGO, Dec. 28.â The annual report
of Major General Elwell S. Otis, com

fining military prisoners. There are at
present 1350 prisoners at the various posts,
the majority of them being charged with
desertion. During the year 20,329 persons
applied for enlistment and 5196, or 25.55
per cent, were accepted. For service in
the navy there were 1140 enlistments, com
pared with 975 last year.

PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad, Dec.
28.â Passengers who have arrived
here from La Guayra say that
President Castro of "Venezuela
wished to send troops from Car
acas to Valencia to op'erate against tho
revolutionists, but that the German au
thorities refused to permit the use of the
line unless there was a guarantee against
damage from battle with insurgents. The
railroad officials appealed to the German
Minister to support them. Several notes
passed between the Minister and Presi
dent Castro, and then followed an Inter
view which was not satisfactory. It is
eaid that the railroad officials finally or
dered the dismounting of the locomotives,
while the. German Minister departed to
La Guayrk to go on board the German
cruiser False.
The railroad stations, It is reported, are
occupied by Venezuelan troops.
According to the latest advices the Ven
ezuelan revolutionists recently in Colom
bian territory have crossed the frontier
and are now In Guajlra peninsula and in
Tachlra. They are under the command
of Generals Pablo Penalosa and Rangel
Garblras. The latest 'news shows that
there are extensive uprisings against
President Castro in the States of Cara
bobo and Bermudez, It is reported that
Governor Sarria has revolted and has
established an autonomy in Guayana.
The Venezuelan gunboat Restaurador
arrived here yesterday. She reported that
the British steamship Ban Rlgh, which,
it is said, has on board a large quantity
of arms and ammunition for the revolu
tionists, was at Martinique when she left.
The Restaurador left this port last night
to continue scouting duty.
CASTBO'S STR-EBTGTH WANING.
Venezuela Revolutionists Are Gain
j ing Ground Daily.
"WTJSLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao, Dec.
28. â Advices reached here to-day from Ca
racas, Venezuela, say that the revolution
against President Castro is gaining
ground daily. Nearly the whole of the
republic is in revolt and bands of men
are ranging the country. Coro, in the
State of Falcon, and Barqulslmeta, In tho
State of Lara, particularly, are in tho
possession of the revolutionists.
Cable communication between Cumano,
Curapano and Barcelona is interrupted
and the Government Is without news
from the State of Bermudese (in which
these ports are located), which leads to
the belief that it also has been induced
to revolt by General Domingo Monagus.
General Luciano Mendozo, the Presi
dent-elect of the State of Carabobo, who
rebelled against President Castro, march
ed on La Victoria and was reported to
have been defeated, has escaped from the
pursuit of the Government troops and is
now in the province of San Juan de Los
moros. Antonio Fernandez and thirty
chiefs of the State of Carabobo were not
willing to engage the Government forces
before the revolution was quite ripe.
Venezuela is said to be on the verge of
even more serious complications. The
telegraph lines in the interior of the coun
try have all been cut.
The arrival in Venezuela of Senor Ma
tos, the reputed head of the revolutionary
movement, with the steamer Ban Righ,
loaded with munitions of war, is awaited
daily. A decisive conflict will soon take
place.

Schley was joined at his apartments In
the Richmond to-day by his counsel, Isa
dor. Raynor and Assistant Counsel
Teague, both of whom came over from
Baltimore at the admiral's request In
order to consider what further steps, if
any, were to be taken In the Schley case.
The conference closed at 2 o'clock and
Raynor returned to Baltimore. No state
ment was made as to the results, except
that such further steps as might be taken
would deal with legal rather than naval
phases of the controversy.
Admiral and Mrs. Schley will leave in
about a week for a trip south, to be gone
about two weeks. He has not yet made
up his Itinerary, but will do so next week.
Attempt to Wreck an Electric Car.
BOWLING GREEN, Ohio, Dec. 28.â An
attempt to wreck a car on the Toledo,
Bowling Green and Southern Electric

"Give No Quarter"
the Battle Cry
at Honda.
Rout of Colombian
Insurgents Is^
Complete.
COLON, Dec. 28.â Barranqullla pa
pers dated December 24, which
came to hand this morning, con
tain further details of the battle
near Honda. They say that Gen
eral Leovlglldo Rodriguez commanded
Honda's small garrison. General Marln's
large force of Insurgents attacked the
place early on the morning of December
9. At 8 a. m. General Londono brought
"up 200 Government reinforcements from
La Ciguente, across the Magdalena River,
facing Honda. By 11:30 o'clock the com
bined forces drove the enemy away from
Honda.
The Insurgents, on arriving at Caraoll,
near Marlqulta, in the evening, awaited
the Government troops In two wings. It
was there that bayonets and machetes
were freely used, for the insurgents' am
munition was exhausted. The vanguard
having been surrounded, with the aid of
the rear guard, the Government troops
succeeded in breaking the line and then
utterly routed the enemy.
On the following morning, when 400
were found to have been killed, the in
surgents retreated by way of Guayaquil,
taking their wounded with them. -
The fighting In this engagement has
been characterized as uncivilized. The
Liberal colors bore the device, "I Neither
Ask for nor Give Quarter." i
The following dispatch has been re
ceived from Panama: "General Alban
says that he has conclusive proof that
the President of Salvador has been as
sisting the revolutionists. Fifteen hun
dred of the latter from Tumaco, ' under
Benjamin Herrera, landed on the penin
sula of Tonosi, near Santiago de Veragua.
(a town of Colombia, 125 miles southwest
of Pftnama, near the coast). The small
garrison of that place fought \for five
hours, but when the rebels landed at sev
eral points it could not resist the attack.
."The Government has concentrated all
its forces under General Castro and is
sending more troops to his aid. A battle
is expected to take place shortly; but, as
reinforcements are coming from Barran
quilla, General Alban has no -fear of the
ultimate success of the army in defend
ing the republic.
"General Alban confirms the reports
from Bogota that fighting has taken place
during the week at Fusagasuga and Cu
macua; that many men were killed, and
that the Government troops were victo
rious." -â  â¢ i

be seen floating in the waters of the gulf.
It Is likely â  that several will elapse
before it will be possible to form an esti
mate of the total damage at up coast
lumber camps.
Since yesterday word has come from
Victoria that the vessel ashore on Trial
Island la certainly the ship Santa Clara,
and not the bark Bankburn, as at first re
ported. On the other hand, the Bankburn
has disappeared completely, and not a
word has been received by Captain Wylie,
her master, as to her â¢whereabouts. Cap
tain Wylio is In Victoria.
A report reached- Victoria Thursday
that the Bankburn had found an anchor
age close to San Juan Island, but when
a tug had been dispatched to investigate
it was found that there was no vessel in
the vicinity of San Juan Island, and it i3
considered unlikely that the Bankburn
ever brought up there. Captain Wylle
is placed in the most peculiar position of
having lost his vessel while he was
ashore, and she disappeared at a time
when he thought she lay safely at anchor
in the Royal Roads. It Is thought in Vic
toria that the Bankburn may have been
navigated down to the Sound, but reports
from there Indicate that she is not to be
found in that direction.
There is no change in the condition of
the wreck of the" Minnie E. Caine. She
piled up on Smiths Island, immediately
opposite the end of the Straits of Juan de
Fuca, early in the storm, at about the
time the steamer Mainlander nearly,
foundered in the trough of the sea. The'
crew of the Caine, which is a new four
masted schooner, had no trouble in climb
ing off the ship on the rocks, and catch-
Ing hold of trees they pulled themselves
up the bank. The ship herself will be a
total wreck.
The Santa Clara, which went on Trial
Island, near Victoria, Is no nearer being
floated than when the first attempt was
made Thursday night. Several large holes
were knocked in her bow.
Reports from cannery headquarters and
other Bources to-day, tend rather to in
crease the amount of the loss by the
etorm than to diminish it.

FRENCH MARINERS
HAVE GRIEVANCE
Allege Unfair Treatment
' in Ports on This
Coast.
Claim That Local Officials
Wink- at "Shanghaing"
Operations.
Special cable-to The Call and New York -Her*
' nld. Copyright. 1901. by lie Herald Pub
ltshlns Company.
PARIS, Dec. 28.â A ' cry of alarm is
sounded in the FrenchTpresa regarding the
treatment â¢ received. ' by French merchant
ships in Pacific ports of the United
States.
It is claimed that local -Institutions
have, in defiance of the Franco-American
treaty of 1858, interfered between captains
and crews, ignoring: the authority of the
French Consul, which is alone valid, and
thereby provoking wholesale desertions.
M. Schwob, editor of the Petit Pftate, a
shipping organ published in Nantes," says
he has received a document wh^ph Ieave3
no doubt on the subject. Eight captains
of French vessels of heavy tonnage sent
a complaint a month ago to the French
Consul General In San Francisco and a
similar communication was sent to the
editor of-Phare by French eaptains- at
Portland and Astoria.
These documents claim that the regu
lar trade has been disorganized by a local
sailors' home for holding French seamen
for ransom, and that the authorities re
fuse to put a stop to these proceedings,
hence cases of desertion are becoming
more numerous.
Sixteen French ships on the Columbia
River at the time of writing were, in con
sequence, far short of their strength. It
is further pointed out that the French
naval reserves are also being depleted by
desertion of these seainen.
No change in the situation has been
brought about by the protests sent to the
French Consul General in San Francisco.
One of tl)e captains was arrested on com
plaint of a deserter and, had to find bail
to the amount of $7500. In another case a
vessel belonging in Nantes was seized and
kept under arrest three days on complaint
of an imprisoned seaman.
The Phare declares that in view of the
Inertia or helplessness of the French dip
lomatic representatives on the spot it Is
proposed by a group of ship-owners to
request the Ministry of Marine to send a
warship out to the "Western coast of the
United States for the protection of French
mercantile interests.
"PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 28.â C. Henri
Labbe, the French consular agent, when
seen regarding the reported denunciation
by the French captains in port, to-day
said:
"I feel that I have tised my utmost en :
deavors to protect the interests of my
countrymen. I did not know the captains
had written to the Consul General in San
Francisco denouncing me. I cannot say
anything further for publication until I
have investigated the matter."
The French Consul General, Henry
Dallemagne, last night emphatically de
nied that he had received any complaint
against C. Henri Labbe, the French con
sular agent in Portland. He said that no
French captains had sent a communica
tion to him denouncing Labbe's conduct.
The Consul General expressed the great
est faith In Labbe, and declared that had
he himself been there he could not have
done better under the circumstances. The
Consul General said that the consular
agent in' Portland had done the best, con
sidering the conditions that he was called
upon to meet.
The Consul General admitted that the
conditions surrounding navigation on the
Pacific Coast were not altogether satis
factory, but refused to enter into further
discussion for publication.

FORTY MILLIONS
FOR THE CANAL
Approximate Price Pan
ama Company Will
Ask fojj Property.
PARIS, Dec. 28.â JJ. Lampre, secretary
general of the Panama Canal Company,
tailed for New York to-day on the French
line steamer L'Aquitaine from Havre. He
will confer on his arrival in the United
States with a number of the Panama
Company's American representatives and
overtures for thessale of the canal prop
erty to the United States will then be
renewed.
In view of the doubt existing In the
United States regarding the price the
Panama Canal Company's representatives
intend to ask for the property, your cor
respondent made inquiries from the best
source of information on that subject and
Is enabled to say that the price will be
approximately $40,000,000.
This figure cannot yet be given as the
exact one, because the company has not
yet come to a definite decision, but It
will not be appreciably higher. The Isth
mian Commission's full report la now in
possession of the Panama Company and
its valuations will be studied in detail.
The report of the directors of the Panama
Company, cabled December 21, said:
"We offer to accept as the basis and
principal of departure of fresh negotia
tions the figures and declarations main
tained in the Isthmian Commission defini
tive report."
The estimates come to by such eminent
men are not thought to be open to ques
tion, though possibly a few items are sus
ceptible to reconsideration and a few
matters may remain to be decided, such
as a valuation of the company's stock of
supplies; but none of these is calculated
to modify the gross figure to any extent.
The company does not intend to give the
slightest ground for any further misun
derstanding and believes the definitive
price put forward will now be acceptable.
With M. Lampre in America it will not
be necessary for the mandatory who 13
empov/ered to submit the definitive prico
to depart from France until later, when
the negotiations are under way.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa. Dec. 28.â In
the District Court to-day the attorneys
for Jame3 Doyle filed a mation for Judg
ment in the suit of Doyle against James
F. Burns for. $438,743 in , a â ..ion to the
$443,922 allowed by the jury In its verdict.
The demand for the additional sum is
made on the ground that the jury in It3
answers to special interrogatories found
that a mining partnership agreement or
contract existed between Doyle and Burns
and that this finding had been the right
of Doyle to a share in the Portland Com
pany stock issued for the Devils Own
claim, as well as for the Bobtail No. 2
and Tidal Wave claims, in spite of the
jury's refusal to inclu6e tne Devils Own
in Its verdict.
The additional amount demanded by
Doyle added to the amount allowed by
the jury would aggregate $885,671 63.

Reaving Nothing Undone That Will
Place Them in Condition.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 28.â Stanford "Uni
versity Alumni and students who live
here are rallying enthusiastically to the
support of the cardinal for its meeting
with Michigan football eleven on New
Year's day. They have planned to sit in
a body and wear and wave as much color
as Is usually seen at the annual Califor
nia-Stanford game. Team practice of the
Stanford eleven shows marked improve
ment each day. The members are being
held down to regular football diet and the
men are compelled to keep regular hours.
Partisans of the cardinal are figuring
out that if Traeger plays there will be a
fair prospect of his kicking a field goal.
He did this ln the game with Berkeley In
1900. Roosevelt yesterday kicked five goals
out of six trials from the 25-yard line.
ThU3 are Stanford's friends building
hopes that the cardinal will score against
Michigan.
The sale of seats already reaches $2200.
Sportsman's Park, Pasadena, Is being
placed ln the best of condition for the
fray. Both elevens - are practicing with
determination, and it is predicted the
game will be worth going a long way to
see.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1901.
BOY PBEVEKTS
MAN'S SUICIDE
Policemen Are Notified
Just in Time to
Save Life. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 28.â Buying a
pistol to commit suicide and immediately
afterward being arrested on a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon is what be
fell F. w. Peters to-night.
Peters is a recent arrival in Los Ange
les, where he has not met with the good
luck he anticipated. Belng^nearly out of
cash and suffering from the blues he pro
posed putting- a bullet into his brain.
Peters had Just enough, money left to pur
chase a cheap revolver. He could not
afford a good one, but argued that an
imitation affair sends a bullet as deep
as the other.
The despondent man, who Is well
dressed and appears intelligent, muttered
to himself on North Main street that he
was tired of life and of this country and
that It was time to die. A boy overheard
Peters' moody reflections and watched
him to Bee him die. Peters entered a
gun store on North Main street, but the
stock of firearms was of too expensive a
kind and he departed without a revolver.
The next place he entered could supply
his wants.
Peters left with a pistol fully loaded,
still breathing dark threats against him
self and with the boy shadowing him ln
anticipation of a gory sight. Theywalked
on to First street, where two policemen
were passing the time o' day. It struck
the boy that there was more fun ln seeing
the would-be suicide lugged off in the
patrol wagon at once than to follow him
all night to see him shoot himself.
The boy told the policemen what he
knew. They interviewed Peters and he
candidly stated that having met with
money losses life had become unbearable
and he was so heartily tiredof the United
States that he proposed with the officers'
permission to make a Journey to the other
world. The policemen clapped their strong
arms around Peters, rang in for the
wagon and sent him a prisoner to the City
Jail. After paying for the pistol Peters'
assets consisted of only 20 cents.

CHILD TRIES
TO END LIFE
Fifteen -Year - Old Girl
Drinks Poison in
. Seattle.
Love for a Young Man Who
Danced With Her the
Cause.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SEATTLE, ! Dec. 28.â Daisy liof ton, a
15-year-old girl, swallowed the contents
of a one-ounce vial of carbolic acid at
midnight . last ,nlght with suicidal Intent
while makin&a pretext for using the tel
ephone in the^rear of a drug store. A
physician, after working over the child
for more than an hour, expressed the
belief that she would recover.
Miss Lofton appeared in the store at
five minutes before midnight and request
ed a clerk to sell her a small bottle of
carbolic acid. The request was denied,
but while the clerk's attention was dis
tracted she renewed her request to the
proprietor, who, unconscious of her de
signs, sold her the drug. No sooner had
she procured It than she requested per
mission to use the telephone.
Walking, to the rear of the store, the
girl took the receiver ln one hand and
dashed the contents of the bottle down
her throat with the other. With a scream
of agony she fell to the floor, and Dr.
Lowe, whose offices are over the drug
store, was Immediately summoned to at
tend her.
.. "I did it because I liked Ned so well,"
were the first words the girl . uttered
when she revived.
Ned Moore, upon whom Daisy Lofton's
childish attachment appeared to be cen
tered, is an employe of the Pacific Coast
Company and was almost crazed at the
nearly fatal termination of an attach
ment, of the existence of which he said he
had .not the slightest intimation. 'Moore's
acquaintance with the girl has, he says,
been confined to her company at two or
three dances, and t aside from showing her
the courtesies incident to such meetings
he had thought but little of her.
Moore, who is 25 years of age, is a
member of a highly respected family In
this city. No reason for taking the poison
1b offered except that Moore did not seem
to return the regard which the girl had
formed for him.

WIND SPARES
THE ORCHARDS
Damage in the Southern
. Cities Not So Great
as Feared.
Reports From One Desert
Town Tell of Much .
Destruction.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 28.â The wind
storm of yesterday which swept over a
large area In Southern California has en
tirely abated and reports concerning Its
effects are reaching this city from out
side points. The damage has not been so
extensive aa first reports Indicated. In
some places many oranges I were blown '
off the trees and others somewhat dam
aged from bruises and pricking, but the
aggregate loss Is not great
Riverside, Ontario, Pomona, Corona and
other places ln that section report con
siderable loss to orchardlsts from fallen
fruit, but not to such an extent as was
feared last night. The railroads havo
cleared their tracks and all trains are
moving on time. The weather Is clear and
pleasant.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 28.â At Campo, a
mountain town on the edge of the desert
sixty miles east of here, last night's storm
did some heavy damage. . Telephone re
ports from there say that no such heavy
windstorm has ever before been known
there. Roofs of houses were blown off
and some houses were demolished. Resi
dents had to brace their houses from the
Inside during the night. The store of E.
H. Wiggam, with its contents, was en
tirely destroyed.
People coming in from, the desert report
that the passes are almost blocked by
fallen limbs and trees. The surveying
party of the San Diego and Eastern road
lost part of their camp outfit and suc
ceeded ln saving the remainder by weight
ing it down with rocks.
SANTA ANA, Dec. 28.â The sandstorm
of yesterday and last night waa apparently
at an end this morning and the usual fine
weather prevails. Now that the results
of the storm in this city can be plainly
seen, It appears that last night's reports
were somewhat exaggerated as to the
damage done here. While several build
ings were damaged, the total amount wiil
not exceed $200, though the damage to the
orange crop is still considered largo.
SANTA ANA TVTATTrei PROTEST.
Citizens Declare That Reports of
Damage Were Grossly Exag
gerated.
SANTA ANA, Dec. 28.â In regard to the
reports of the recent sandstorm a mass
meeting, eighty persons being present,
adopted the following resolutions to
night:
Whereas, The correspondent of the Associated
Press tent from this city a certain grossly
exaggerated and false report of the storm of
yeeterday, which will be injurious to our com
munity if not corrected; and whereas, we have
heretofore suffered in silence from many simi
lar exaggerated and false reports published
in certain Los Angeles papers; and whereas,
the continuance of such a condition has be
come Intolerable. Therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the citizens of Santa
Ana, in mass meeting: assembled, declare such
reports to be grossly exaggerated, false and un
fair. We assert:
First â That the wind did not "carry loads
of sand and pebbles," but only the dust of
the streets and fleld3.
Second â That there was no "blinding 1 cy
clonic sandstorm,"' the wind at no time ex
ceeding a velocity of forty miles an hour.
â¢ Third â That tha sand "did not .blow ln pil
lars, or, blind .and smother pedestrians or
teams"; nor was "traffic suspended" at all.
Fourth â That it Is false that "several busi
ness houses sustained broken plate glass win
dows" and that "every awning and sign was
blown down," the truth being that only one
plate glass was broken in the entire city and
not a single sign or awning was blown away.
Fifth â That the telephone service was not
crippled and that the eledtrio light was only in
terrupted by an accident to the line outside
of the county.
Sixth â No train was delayed within the
county of Orange.
Seventh â That the orange crop sustained but
small damage.
We therefore protest against the tenor of the
entire dispatch and demand that all correspond
ents hereafter treat -our city honestly, fairly
and Justly. W. H. SPURGEON, Chairman.
O.- M. ROBBINS. Secretary.
CLALLAM FLEET SAFE.
Vessels in the Harbor Have Narrow
Escape From Disaster.
PORT TOWNSEND, Dec. 28.â Tho
steamer Gertrude to-day brings the first
news from Cape Flattery and way ports
since the Christmas storm totally^demol

the narrowest escape, dragging her an
chors until she was close to the shore.
There she brought up and held fast, suc
cessfully weathering the remaining hours
of the storm. Clallam Bay waa particu
larly exposed to the force 1 of the westerly
gale. The fleet, all of which are safe,
included the ships Owenee, W. H: Macy,

SEES VICTIM
ON THE RUN
Drummer Who Was at
Lookout Tells of the
Lynching.
Thrilling Story Related to
the Jury in Alturas
Court.
ALTURAS, Dec. 28.â The whole morn-
Ing's session of the Superior Court ln the
Lookout lynching case was consumed ln
an argument on a question sought to be
asked of E. I* Carpenter by the defense.
During all of yesterday's session the at
torneys and the Judge appeared to havo
determined to conduct the case quietly,
but to-day there was more wrangling and
quarreling, though in a comparatively
mild degree.
This afternoon the appointment and
qualification of J. W. Brown as Deputy
Constable of Lookout Township were put
in' evidence. The first witness examined
was John Hutton. He stated that he
heard a conversation between the defend
ant, Brown, Isom Eades and two or three
other parties whose names he was unablo
to remember, which conversation took
place between the Morris store and
Meyers' Hotel at Lookout. One of the
men said:
"If the law don't take them ln hand and
put these fellows out of the way, the citi
zens ought to do so."
The witness refused "to say if he had
heard a conversation on Tuesday, the
28th of May, on the ground that he might
incriminate himself. Assistant Attorney
General Post asked the witness if he Â«lid
not hear Brown say on the 28th, "They
will hang them the first clear night."
Attorney Raker for the defense object
ed to the question and pending argument
the jury and the witness were excluded
from the courtroom. The witness refused
to answer the question.
The next witness was Frank Tetreau,
a resident of Chico. He Is supposed to be
one of the leading witnesses for the pros
ecution. Tetreau is a commercial traveler
and salesman for McCormick, Sellzer &
Co. of Redding. He stated that he was
In the town of Lookout the night of the
hanging and slept in a bedroom off the
parlor ln Meyers' Hotel. About l;30
o'clock on the morning of May 31 he waa
awakened by an unusual noise like that
of some one running or walking on the
board floor. He did not know what the
disturbance was.
In about ten minutes he heard people
running on the street in front of the ho
tel and heard some one come toward the
parlor. Then he heard Calvin Hall say.
"Who are you and what do you want?"
Next he saw masked men on the street
outside the window. He heard a door
broken ln and saw Calvin Hall taken
down the street toward the bridge on a
trot. He thought it was about time to
get out and he started to pull on his
clothes. He saw some men standing to
gether in front and heard some pistol
shots fired by some of them. He made a
mistake in going out and got behind tha
bar. When he got outside some one said
a mob had come and taken the prisoners
out of the hotel, but they did not know
why.
The witness suggested that the others
accompany him to see about it and he
was told that he had better not. as they
had been told not to follow. He then went
back to bed. In the morning he visited
the bridge and saw the bodies, got a piece
of each rope for a souvenir and left town.

BRUTAL THUGS
BEAT VICTIM
Footpads Hold Up John
Lubler on a Dark ;
Bridge.
Three brutal footpad? held up John
Lubler on the Second-street bridge last
night, and without giving him a chance
to submit quietly to their demands they
fc truck him three times on the head with
a revolver, knocking him senseless. Be
fore the thugs had time to rifle his pock
ets several men and a woman Etarted
across the bridge ancl the footpads be
came frightened and ran away, leaving
their bleeding and unconscious victim to
be picked up' toy the pedestrians.
Lubler had three deep gashes on the
top of Ills head and he was removed im
mediately to the Harbor Hospital, where
his injuries were dressed. After having
his wounds bandaged Lubler went to the
Harbor police station, where he told his
story of the attempted robbery.
Lubler said he was about half way
across the bridge when the three men
epratig from behind one of the stringers
cf the bridge and ordered him to throw
u;) his hands. Before he had time to com
ply with the request one of the cowardly
thugs dealt him a stunning blow on the
head with a revolver. As he was falling
he received two more blows, and after
that he remembered nothing until he was
picked up by the passers-by, who arrived
just in time.
Lubler had a gold watch and a consid
erable amount of money on his person,
and had not the footpads been frightened
off they would have got a neat sum for
their work. The police are of the opinion
that it was the work of new men in the
hold-up business, as a reasoned footp-id
never harms his victim unless he at
tempts to make a fight.
The care was reported to Captain Sey
mour and he detailed two of his detec
tives on the case. Lubler was stricken
down so quickly that he did not get a
good description of the three footpads.

DOWIE DECIDES
TO SETTLE CASE
His Attorney Seeks to
Secure a Compromise
of Litigation.
CHICAGO, Dec. 28.â John Alexander
Dowie has decided that he will settle the
claim of his brother-in-law, Samuel Ste
venson, the English lacemaker, before
next Thursday, the time set by Judge
Tuley for handing down a decision in the
case. Edward Logan Reeves, Steven
son's attorney, to-day received a letter
from Samuel W. Packard, Dowie's law
yer, to the effect that Dowie was ready to
make a reasonable settlement.
At the close of the trial Judge Tuley
held a private conference with Stevenson
and Dowle and their attorneys, in which
he is reported to have intimated that un
less the case was settled out of court he
would appoint a receiver for the Zlon lace
industries. ,
Stevenson alleged- mat Dowie defrauded
him out of $150,000 and his attorney de
clares that no amount less than that will
be considered in settlement.
DBTJMMERS MAKE MERRY
AT THE BANQUET BOARD
Pacific Division of Travelers' Protec

Annual Reunion.
The fourth annual banquet of the Cali
fornia division of the Travelers' Protec
tive Association was held last night in the
banquet-room of Golden Gate Hall. About
150 of the membership of 323 were pres
ent.
Harry M. Campe acted as toastmaster.
In the course of the evening he announced
that the original charter, kept in the cus
tody of former Senator Braunhart since
the time of the split in the organization,
had been given by Braunhart into the
hands of P. B. Gallagher and was by him
at this time presented to the association.
Harry Moore, the president-elect, in re
sponding to a toast spoke of the future of
the organization, and told a few good
drummers' stories. When he had finished
the orchestra played "Annie Moore."
Former President Ed Warnecke and
Thomas Hays also responded to toasts.
A programme of musical numbers and
specialties furnished amusement that was
somewhat superfluous In view of the num
ber of drummers at table and the amount
of good cheer available.
The California division has elected the
following new officers:
Harry T. Moore, president; Fred Kggers,
first vice president; J. H. Davis, second vice
president; J. J. Baumgartner, secretary and
treasurer; directors â Henry M. Campe. Ben

MILITIA HOLDS
BACK LYNCHERS
Mob Clamors for Life
of Murder Suspect
Wilcox.
ELIZABETH CITY, N. C, Dec. 2S.-The
presence of a squad of naval militia with
loaded carbines Is all that prevents an
attack on the jail in which Is confined
James Wilcox, accused of the murder *of
Nellie Cropsey. Threats of lynching were
freely made to-day and the feeling
against the young man continues bitter.
During the day armed guards have kept
all pedestrians a block away from, the
jail. To-night the saloons were closed by
order of the Mayor. Solicitor Ward had
a warrant sworn out, charging Wilcox
with murder. A preliminary hearing will
be held on Wednesday, when Wilcox
probably will be held for the Grand Jury
which will meet in March.
Wilcox is probably the most uncon
cerned man in the town. He sits in his
cell making cigarettes and talking with
his guards. He says he has no fear of
lynching.
Andrew G. Cropsey, the uncle of Miss
Nellie Cropsey, who had been missing
since November 20 and whose body was
discovered in the Pasqubtank River yes
terday, arrived in this city to-day from
New York. Cropsey is making prepara
tions to take the body of the dead girl to
New York for interment. He is deeply
affected by the tragic death of his niece.
Ho has spent a large sum of money in
efforts to solve the mystery of her dis
appearance and will do his utmost to
solve the mystery of her death.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury, which
was not made public In this city last
night, lest it might cause the lynching of
James Wilcox, was read to-day in
front of the Coroner's office to a
large assemblage of people. The great
crowd not only manifested no sympathy
for Wilcox, but seemed inclined to deal
harshly with him if assurance of his guilt
could be obtained. No surprise was ex
hibited by the general public at the result
of the Coroner's inquest, as the belief
has been fixed in this city that the girl
was murdered.
Payot Lectures on Japan.
"Japanâ The Land of the Rising Sun"
was the lecture given last evening at tho
Mechanics' Institute by Henry Payot be
fore an audience that crushed into every
nook and corner. The stereoptlcon views
were no more highly colored nor did they
show more delicate tints than the word
pictures of the lecturer. He tripped his
hearers to the shrine of gods and Into tho
presence of geisha girls, and gave In
structive accounts of manners and cus
toms, the progress and the lmitatfvo
characteristics of the Japanese, and
amused by telling how .very Improper are
swearing and kissfng in the land of the
rising sun, and how|d witty American,
on learning those facts, said, "I prefer
America, where they kiss and cuss!" The
merry mosquito, said the lecturer, lived
to torment, but he was as mu3lcal as a
brass band. In Japan they did not resort
to nor depend upon fires for warmth^ln
the winter. Instead the Japanese - piled
on to themselves extra clothing as the
cold increased, consequently they seemed
to grew fatter and fatter as the weather
became colder. He paid a tribute to the
intelligence and to the great progress of
the Japanese, and, indeed, all the way
through the lecture was as Instructive as
it was entertaining.

RIVALRY CAUSES
LOSS OF TRADE
Americans Seek to Un
dermine One Another
m Germany.
Foreign Official Explains How
Business Interests
Suffer.
BERLIN, Dec. 28.â American diplomacy
in Berlin, so far as it relates to commer
cial controversies, is hampered by the in
terference of the private interests con
cerned. The force of the representations
of the State Department haa^been contin
ually Impaired by American business men
acting independently of diplomatic chan
nels. This Is the startling purport of a
communication made to-day by a- person
closely related to the Foreign Office, from
whom something was sought more candid
than the Foreign Office's carefully framed
statements usually are. Naturally thi3
person can only speak plainly for publica
tion abroad. He said:
I suggest these memoranda for explaining
German Governmental views on three or four
things that are. the subjects of correspondence
with our Foreien Office, There is the meat
question, always with us, and Ilkely4o be again
troublesome in the spring, if our 'new inspec
tion regulations become imperative. Underly
ing the meat dispute Is, of course, the protect
ive tariff idea in which your statesmen have
educated us. But beyond that, how can you
blame us- if we exclude canned meats after the
embalmed beef testimony? Public opinion here
has most unpleasant recollections oÂ£ that tes
timony and Is now Irritated by the boastful
utterances of representatives of the great meat
firms, whose attitude is that whether the meat
is good or bad, Germany must buy it, as they
cannot raise enough for their own use. These
firms, I may say, are striving to reach the
German Government by influences outside of
your State Department.
Americans Bring About Trouble.
Much of the trouble we are giving American
insurance companies originates in the intrigues
of these great concerns against each other . In
order to secure a semi-exclusive field. They
have filled several cases In our Foreign CHflce
with secret documents against their American
rivals, such as so-called exposures of methods
of dolns business and attacks on the integrity
of their financial operations and investments.
Our case asainst the foreign insurance com
panies Is upheld by briefs against them pre
pared by their rivals in their own country.
Alluding to the approaching period
when a new commercial treaty will prob
ably be negotiated with the United States,
the informant said:
Germany will want her full share of the ad
vantages of the United States reciprocal ar
rangements with other countries. We justly
consider it a grievance that the United States,
under the most favored nation idea, is able to
profit by any new commercial convention we
enter into with another country, while Ger
many is unable to participate in a reciprocal
treaty which the United States makes with
another country. . 'Â»â¢ Â», â¢
The general business situation occupies
increasing attention. As the year closes
careful observers admit that the situation
grows worse. The recently expressed
hope3 that an improvement had begun
have been disappointed. The railway
earnings show a decrease as compared
with 1900. A significant fact is that ISO
Berlin foundries, machine shops and elec
trical establishments have petitioned the
Prussian Ministry for orders, even at
prices involving a loss, in order to avoid
discharging their laborers. â¢ Elsewhere the
dismissals of working people, the curtail
ment of wages and the shortening of the
hours of labor continue. The greatest
iron company of Silesia has Just reduced
wages 15 per cent.
Distress in Berlin.
The distress in Berlin Is shown by the
fact that the sales of Christmas trees
were 100,000 less than in 1900. The mer
chants have begun to feel the effects of
the lower purchasing powers of the peo
ple. Some financiers refer to the low
money rates and to the demand for for
eign loans as Indications of returning con
fidence. More careful critics of the situa
tion, however, see therein evidence of
deep seated lack of confidence in Ger
many's business situation, which pre
vents any new industrial undertakings
in spite of the low prices of raw materials
and the low rate of wages. The papers
say no improvement may be expected
while the uncertainty regarding commer
cial treaties lasts.
A summary of Germany's naval activity
during the year 1901 shows that four bat
tleships were launched and that one arm
ored cruiser, one gunboat, several large
torpedo-boat destroyers and four coast
defense vessels have been remodeled.
Other vesels have also been remodeled.
SECRETARY LONG GIVES
PRAISE TO ARMY MEN
Commends . Heroic Attempt to Re -
cover' Body of Murdered
Naval Apprentice.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â Secretary

tary of War highly commending the con
duct of Captain G. A. Detchmendy and

they prosecuted the search, for the re
mains of D. G., A. Venville, a first-class

dered by Filipino insurrectionists at
Baloi, P; I.
"The fact that the loss of. one. naval
apprentice," says Secretary Long, "in
the multitude of fatal and other casual
ties which have â¢ occurred during the in
surrection in the Philippines could have
inspired such unselfish and hazardous
service as was Involved In the search for

high tribute to the character of '"â¢ tho
United States army and will tend to
unite the navy_ to It in closer bonds.

will transmit to the officers and enlisted
men above mentioned the grateful appre
ciation and' commendation not only of

KILLS HERSELF
IN A THEATER
Dramatic Suicide of Love
sick Young Woman
of Washington.
Takes a Place in Front of
Stage and' Then Swal
, lows Poison. w
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 28.â One of
the most dramatic suicides which (has
ever taken place in Washington occurred
to-night at Chase's Theater, when Miss
Mary Renner during the performance
ended her life because of unrequited
love. Miss Renner, who was about 28
years of age, fancied herself in love with
an actor who appeared at the theater to
night. He was evasive and the culmina
tion came this evening when she killed
herself in the full view of hundreds of
people. Miss Renner invited a friend to
attend â¢ the performance to-night and
shortly after 8 o'clock they entered the
theater and took their seats. A few min
utes later Miss Renner excused herself
and just as the curtain went up she was
seen walking down the center aisle. When
she reached the end of the first row of
seats from the stage she paused, lifted
her hand to her lips and with a subdued
scream sank to the floor. Those sitting
near by rushed to her assistance and she
was carried to the rear, where it was dis
covered that she was suffering from
poison. She was immediately removed to
the emergency hospital, where she died a
few minutes later. After the audience
had been quieted the performance was
continued.
MAKES FIVE ATTEMPTS
*' IN ONE NIGHT TO DIE
Insane Sailor in Lop Angeles Uses
Every Available Method of Sui
cide, but Fails.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 28.â Charles Ger
son, formerly a sailor in the navy, and
who is now in the coasting trade, unsuc
cessfully tried to kill himself in five dif
ferent ways to-night while suffering from
hallucinations superinduced by drink.
While preparing his sailor's bag at the
Monterey lodging-house on South Main
street, and while he had spread before
him his cash consisting of $35 and a sav
ings bank book containing a credit for
$50, Gerson thought he heard voices of
men in the hall calling attention to his
wealth, and a belief grew in him that he
was to be robbed.
He rushed from the lodging-house and
boarded a Santa Monica electric car. He
got off at Hauser station, a few miles
west of this city, and -wandered off in the
dark, the fear of enemies growing upon
him as he went. Reaching a reservoir he
plunged into it, but being a strong swim
mer could not drown.
Crawling back to land Gerson somehow
procured a rope and proceeded to hang
himself. It proved hardly strong enough
to bear his weight and he fell, nearly
choked, to the ground. Out of his water
logged pockets the demented sailor fished
a dull knife .used for cutting his black
navy .plug and proceeded to slash his
throat, but he only succeeded in making
a number of superficial gashes. He next
tried the blade on his wrists, but strange
ly missed all the important blood vessels.
Having lost his knife In the darkness,
he found it impossible to finish his gory
iob; but being still determined to kill him
self and thus foil his enemies, he wan
dered back to the track of the electric
road and there lay down at full length on
the rails, awaiting death which he so
vainly pursued.
The crew of a city-bound car found
Gerson lying there calmly, although al
most frozen from the effect of the cold
water. He was placed on the car and de
livered at the Emergency Hospital.
He lost his money and bank book in his
mad journey.

DANES OPPOSING
SALE OF ISLANDS
Agitation Embarrasses
the Authorities in
Copenhagen. .
Request Secretary Hay to
Permit Arrangement*
for Plebiscite.
COPENHAGEN. Dec. 28.â The a-gitation
asainst the sale of the Danish West In
dies has placed the Government in an
embarrassing position. There is much
difference of opinion as to how far public
sentiment against the sale is genuine and
how far it is the work of rpeculators and
promoters. At any rate it has impressed
the Foreign Minister to the extent of his
being determined to request Secretary
Hay to allow an arrangement for a
plebiscite. This matter will be settled
through Copenhagen and not through the
Danish Minister at Washington.
It is generally declared in well informed
circles here that the islanders favor the
sale. But the chief argument advancea
by the large majority is that there should
be a plebiscite like that of 1S67.
The fact that the Danish Government Is
reopening the negotiations indicates
there Is much doubt in the minds of the
authorities as to how accurately they
have gauged the national sentiment. In
the meanwhile those who are opposed to
the sale are formulating numerous plans
for realizing on the tropical asset so lone
neglected. A company has just been
formed for improving the economic status
of the islands, in the event that they are
not sold. The capital of the company ia
not announced, but the directors include
Heide and Glenckstadt. bank directors:
Andersen, a director or the East Asiatic
Company, and other influential persons.

LAW TO GOVERN
TRADE COMBINES
President of Anti-Trust
Leaguers Opposes
New Legislation.
Criticizes Recommendations
Made by President in
His Message.
TERRY. Tex., Dec. 2S.â M. I.,. Lock
wood of Zelienople, Pa., president of the
American Anti-Trust League, has given
out a statement in which he criticizes at
length the recommendations made by
President Roosevelt for a. national law to
govern trade combinations. LÂ«ockwood
contends that there is no necessity for
any further legislation on the subject;
that the rigid enforcement of the Sher
man anti-trust law would be sumcie^it to
effectually suppress and restrain hurtful
trade and industrial combinations. He
then says: . . â¢ .
* Does not every one know that these indus
trial combinations have destroyed competition,
have created monopoly and are now fobbing;
the American people of hundreds of millions
of dollars annually to pay dividends on billions
of watered stock, and that some of these divi
dends are 48 per cent annually for water and
all? What more publicity does he want?
Lockwood alleges that the foundation
of all the vast fortunes which have been
built up In trade and manufacturing is
railroad rebates and discriminations, and
refers to the close of the discussion of
the matter In the message, which the
President says that Congress can "profit
by the experience gained by the passage
of the interstate law."
Lockwood further says:
In 1S7S the Independent oil producers of
Pennsylvania began agitation for the passage
of the interstate commerce law. We had in
the lower house of Congress John H. Reagan
of Texas.
For nearly eight years we circulated peti
tions. Reagan finally secured its passage
throug-h the House in such a form as to cure
the evils of railway discrimination, but it was
crippled by the Cullom amendments in the
Senate, 60 that twer.ty-odd years afterward
the chairman of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission testified that "railway discrimination
is universal."
Lockwood alleges that trusts desire
just what is recommended in the message
and that their attorneys advocated it be
fore the Civic Federation Conference. He
says:
"Why is it that these attorneys want to
transfer this question to the seat of the Na
tional Government? The answer is that they
want to get Just as far away from the people
who are being hurt as possible. They know
that the atmosphere is a great deal different
on this question In the Capitol lobbies and in
the hotel lobbies of Washington than it is in
the Stales. And would it not be well for
the President who has sworn to enforce the
laws to have his Attorney General start pro
ceedings in earnest under the provisions of the
Sherman anti-trust law against these trusts
and monopolies and against the illegal railway
combines before he asks for any further Fed
eral legislation on the subject? If he will see
that the laws are faithfully enforced against
these, trusts that have paralyzed all capital
except that which Is willing to go into the
conspiracy and will maintain equal rights to
every American citizen over the highways of
the land in the transportation of his products
he will be surprised to see what a multitude
of "captains of industry" will spring up ready
to give the consumers of America their necessi
ties at competitive prices at 6 per cent profit
upon the actual capital invested. For I say
to him that these "captains of industry" upon
whom he relies do not own a monopoly of
business brains, energy and producing force
of this people. Let him guarantee equal rights
and equal opportunities and the American peo
ple will take care of the trade of the world
Neither will they ask the people at home to
pay ten times the profits upon their necesei
tis at which they are willing to sell the same
goods in foreign countries.

recent conference of labor and capital at
New York and says:
They have created a kind of supreme court
and have made Senator Hanna chief Justice
thereof; they have set up a kind of govern
ment inside of and independent of the regular
government of the people.

ACCEPT PAID ENGAGEMENTS

Holds That They Can Enguge in
Such Enterprises.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â Assistant Sec
retary of the Navy Judge Darling has
addressed a communication to the Secre
tary of the Musicians' Protective Union
of this city in answer to a letter from
that organization protesting against the
members of the United States marine
band accepting or soliciting paid engage
ments and requesting action upon the
subpect. The Assistant Secretary said
that he had examined and considered the
facts and thought that, unless in case of
peculiar or exceptional circumstances or
unless otherwise provided by law, he
should be reluctant to prohibit an em
ploye of the Government from engaging'
in private labor or enterprise when that
engagement does not interfere with the
full prformance of his employment by the
Government. In conclusion Judge Dar
ling said:
"This case is not one of such peculiar
cr exceptional circumstances, and your
request (meaning the union's) is therefore
denied."

UNKNOWN OVERTURE
BY MOZART IS
DISCOVERED BY MAR BY.
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
FROM Paris, via the current number
of the Musical Courier, comes the
astounding statement of the re
cent discovery of an .unknown
"Verture for grand orchestra" by
Mozart, in the library of the Paris
Conservatory. The treasure trove was
found .by G. Marby, the conductor of the
Conservatory concerts, while looking
through a- quantity of manuscript music,
and seems to bear all the earmarks of
authenticity. M. Marby's joy may be
imagined when, on turning over curiously
some yellowed and dusty sheets, appar
ently the orchestral parts of some for
gotten eighteenth century composition,
he came upon the following inscription in
French: "Overture for grand orchestra,
by Mozart, Paris. Printed and published
by the Conservatory Press, 152 Fau
bourg Polssonlere."
Now it appears that evidence that such
a work was sold by Mozart to a conductor
in Paris is contained in a letter written
by the musician to his father on October
3. 1778. He says: "Le Gros, director of
the Concerts Spirituel, has bought from
me the two overtures (symphonies), and
the Concertante Symphony." One, only,
of these overtures is known to the or
chestral world to-day. It was rewritten
and published in Germany. The Paris
find, says M. Tierrot, the famous French
critic, is the other. â¢
How it comes about .that the work has
lain in the placid dust for a long century
and a score of years no one seems to
know. An enterprising housemaid would
have long ago settled its fate In any less
classical surrounding. Naturally, also,
one wonders where the librarian of the
Conservatory was during the 123 years
of Its disappearance. Still, It is to be
thankful that the overture has been pre
served at all, by strange chance, though
â¢to be sure the score is lacking. The or
chestral parts, however, are complete,
and M. Maxby has been able to recon-
Jrtruct the score from. them. Apparently
the music had never been used, and it is
curious to think that the overture was
first heard 123 years after it was written.

Japanese Are Growing.
The increase of stature among the Jap
anese Is very preceptlble, and the substi
tution of tepid and even cold water for
the hot baths among, many of the people
is responsible for an increasing floridlty
of the complexion. Before the advent of
military discipline on European models
the Japanese were notable as the small
est necked race In the world, a firm of
London collar makers with a large trade
in Japan asserting that thirteen inches
was the normal circumference of a full
grown Japanese throat. In a little over
twenty years, owing to a more athletic de
velopment, the average has risen an inch
and a half. To athletic development
should also be added greater avoirdupois,
inasmuch as a more generous dirt, and
abstention from parboiling Is bringing Its
reward in an accumulation of muscle and
tissue.
CLEVER SAN FRANCISCO MUSI
CIAN WHO HAS RETURNED
HOME FROM ABROAD.
It -was played on Sunday, November 24,
at the Paris Conservatory.
The Paris correspondent .of the Courier
says that the overture is thoroughly
Mozartean In character; also that It is
Mozart tempered slightly by the French
schoolâ a delightfully naive confession of
French vanity! He further says that the
orchestration is "that of Mozart's other
works written for the grand orchestra."
It should be said that the overture con
sists of a short solo andante for the
oboe, and an allegro spirituoso. As to
the artistic quality of the^ work the cor
respondent has nothing to say, neither of
its reception by the Parisian critics. Mr.
Steindorff will no doubt soon give us op
portunity of hearing it for ourselves?
Things are slow in the musical world
just now, outside of the excellent relig
ious music that has been heard in many
of the churches this week. There has
been nothing at all of public note
beyond that. Last week there was
a private recital of organ and piano music
given by Marshall W. Giselmann. a young
student who has just returned here from
London after two years* study, that must
have been interesting. I did not hear the
recital, but have since had the pleasure
of hearing Mr. Giselmann in the same
numbers, and find him an ardent student,
with an abundant temperament and a
considerable measure of technical achieve
ment. He plays the usual thingsâ Bach,
Mendelssohn, Widor compositionsâ with
Some new works by new men, and shows
throughout a fine enthusiasm for his art.
I do not particularly ' .e his schooling
and think the talented young man could
better himself on his resumption of study
even here In his own city, and certainly
in Chicago, with Middelschulte, not to
speak of Widor and Vlerne in Paris. He
has the attractive attributes of modesty
and industry and speaks of a long five
years of study before him before he shall
be able to do big things, with the humil
ity of the true student. But he needs
right direction, a school in which the
solid values are jiot sacrificed to bril
liance, where the frame Is firm, the joints
clean and the rest will come of itself.
Mr. Giselmann's best number was the
"Toccata" from Widor's fifth symphony,
but he gave with considerable aplomb the
G minor Fantasia and Fugue of Bach,
a Fantasle by Sjogren, a pretty "Pas
torale" of Lemare's and a few other num
bers. He also plays the piano well, is a
Student of harmony and has generally
gone the right way to equip himself for
a musical career. Trotter, the organist of
London, has been his teacher hitherto.
Next week comes the second symphony
concert with an excellent programme,
then Hofmann, the famous pianist. Nor
dica will follow shortly after, which is
all very good to look forward to.

AN EXPLODED ISSUE.
CONGRESSMAN GROSVENOR'S letter to The Call 'on the subject of the Chinese
exclusion act affords the public a double satisfaction, for it not only gives assurance
that Congress is well nigh solid for exclusion, but exposes the falseness of the preten
v sions of the men who have been trj'ing to make out of the issue a good deal of political
capital for themselves. It confirms the statements of iThe Call that there is no doubt^whateyer of
the passage of an exclusion act, and no need at all for Californians or anybody else to send com
mittees to Washington to urge action.
Mr. Grosvenor deals with the issue tersely and tartly. He says: . "I am in favor of the ex-;
tension of the Chinese exclusion act, and I do" not know anybody in Congress who is not, and I
do not know anybody who has not been in favor of it all the time." Referring to the attempts
of politicians, demagogues and yellow journals to make an issue out of the matter 'and to pose as
the champions of the people, the Congressman says: "This whole hullabaloo that has been caused
all over the country by a lot of meetings and committees and traveling hippodromes is finally to
have it said after all" is over that 'We did it/ and that 'It was public pressure that did it.' It is
all simply so much nonsense."
The public of California will readily recognize the truth of that description of some of the
leaders in the agitation. It was easy to arrange for anti-Chinese conventions and meetings, for
the people are well nigh unanimous on the subject, and are prompt to declare themselves upon it.
Such meetings, held in good faith, were taken advantage of by the hippodromers, who managed
to get themselves appointed on committees to manage the fight, to raise money and to spend it, to
go to Washington and to do forty other things at the public expense, so that when all is over .
they could say "We did it!" The hippodrome, however, has not been so successfulas the leaders â 
expected. The poll taken by The Call immediately upon the assembling of Congress showed
there was no danger in the situation, and the attempt of the hippodromers to work up a sensa
tion was a failure.
In concluding his letter to The Call Mr. Grosvenor sums up the whole situation by say
ing: "Congress will take care of the question. There is no doubt about it and never has been any
doubt about it; and there never was a time when ten members of eitlier house of Congress were
not in favor of it."
That ought to settle the question even in. the minds of those who were, most deluded by
the spectacular play of the hippodrome. The various committees who volunteered to undertake,
at the expense qi the public, to put pressure on Congress might as well retire from public view.
They may be needed somewhere to do some kind of work, but they are not needed to make a fight
for Chinese exclusion. That issue is settled, and the Republican majority in the House and the
Senate,.. together witl^ the Republican President, will take care of it.
THOSE GREEK STUDENTS
THE riots in Athens have ceased, and that ancient city is no longer a storm center for
news. The students who survived the violence they incited have returned to their tasks,
and the Cabinet, which was shaken to disintegration, has resumed its duties and is attending
to the government of the little kingdom.
The strife was caused by ihe proposition to translate the Bible into modern Greek, the lan
guage of the masses. As The Call commented on the cause of the outbreak at the time, we are
interested in the correspondence which has been addressed to us on the subject. It is quite im
pressive that in this country there should be so much knowledge and so much interest in the
seemingly trivial cause of such an outbreak of disorder. One writer sends to us the statement of Pro
fessor Achilles Rose to the effect that the Greek language of the educated classes, taught in the
schools and colleges, is pure Greek, the ancient and immortal tongue in which Demosthenes
uttered his orations and Homer wrote. Protected against invasion by foreign or modern words,
by their prompt extirpation whenever they appear, the language is declared to be the classical
Greek, though not spoken in its purity by the masses of the people. Professor Rose admits that
even in its ancient prime classical speaking and writing was the rare exception. As for "the new
Greek" he declares that we might- as well call the Bowery dialect "modern English," and that
the Bible into new Greek would be just like transforming the King James version,
which is in the English of Shakespeare, into the Bowery slang. While the fact is doubtless known
to scholars, it is information for the non-scholastic that classical Greek is still the spoken lan
guage of the Hellenes. The ancient languages have been superseded by the same processes that
have displaced the civilizations of which they were a part. The Greek tongue evolved from the
speech of the tribes which confederated in that most remarkable commonwealth, but in the
process it doubtless received accessions from Sanscrit, Egyptian, Turanian"} and the languages
which preceded it. Greece took the Egyptian philosophy as part of its material, and when Plato
lived in the city of On, and studied the lore of Egypt, he no doubt realised the obligation of his
language to the elder speech. The question -of present interest is whether classical Greek is
exactly adapted to the expression of modern life. A language does not pass out of use without
some reason, and admitting that the tongue in which Xenophon wrote is still* familiar to the few,
its disuse by the many seems to prove that a more convenient vehicle of thought has become
necessary. In this we by no means surrender our conviction that classical Greek was the Â©Teat*
est language ever spoken by man. Lfitin was indebted to it for nearly all its literary quality and
its fitness for expressing the terms of science, and, next to Anglo-Saxon, the best element in
modern English is Greek. But this genuine respect for the dead language has but little to do
with the contention of the students and the riot and bloodshed which it caused.
The Christian theory being that the Bible is an inspired guide to life, the missionaries of all
sects have translated it into many languages in order that the plan- of salvation might be known
of men. It has been translated into our American Indian dialects, and into the numerous primi
tive tongues of Africa and Asia. The purpose of such translations is spiritual and not scholastic.
The purpose of a translation into new Greek was not to spread secular knowledge, but spiritual
light. We may easily see that the scholar looks with indifference upon Eliot's Indian Bible, and
that the purists of , Harvard and Oxford feel no interest in a Dahomey version of the Gospels.
-But the spiritual guides and teachers of the race have an entirely different feeling. | They will say
at once that if the mass of Greeks are living in ignorance of the inspired word, because it is writ
ten in a language that is no more than a hieroglyph to them, their spiritual peril is so great
that devotion to a dead language should not stand in the way of their rescue.
Paul preached to the Athenians once, and amdng his sayings is this: "For the Jews require
a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumb
ling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness." / \ .
Perhaps the Apostle to the Gentiles had a prevision of this year of grace, when the Greeks,
still seeking after wisdom, fought to the death over a question of the purity of speech, regard
ing purity of spirit as foolishness.
It seems to be conceded that Congress will grant pensions to Mrs. McKinley and Mrs.
Harrison. Each of them is fairly rich and has no need of a larger income, but there is sentiment in
the case, ond where sentiment and pensions are united Congress finds the* combination
irresistible. K

MAN NERING ESSAYS
CAMILLE TO
DISPLAY HER TALENTS.
NOT since the summer harvest of
plays has so well-balanced and
competent a company been seen
here as that which Mary Manner
ing brings with her In "Janice
Meredith." They have succeeded In mak
ing the play go, and no further test of
capacity need be asked. They have fur
ther succeeded h* making it attractive
and enjoyable to a large proportion of the
large audiences that have greeted it at
the Columbia. They have done every
thing possible for the play, even to the
smallest detail, from Miss Mannering
down to the fascinated. soldier who just
smiles for his supper. More than that,
they have unconsciously and with mis
chievous intent deluded their good-na
tured audiences into â  the belief that the
play is a good one. The staging, too, is
very effective and the stage management
without a flaw, so, granting all these good
things,' what's the odds if the audience Is
happy?
Mr. Ford has been incredibly fortunate
In persuading Miss Mannering to picture
his wonderful heroine. The difficult Illu
sion of a girl sufficiently beautiful and be
witching to captivate everything in the
masculine line that comes into her orbit
is thus carried off with victorious plausi
bility, for Mary Mannering Is among the
loveliest and most charming of the
younger women stars. She has grown
considerably in her art since her last visit
here, a steady progress upon right lines,
and she has not yet reached her limit.
Indeed, she has hardly yet crossed the
line that divides the leading lady from
the star, though she is fast nearing the
.confines of the flrmamental domain. Her
work is still a little rigid In line and lack
ing a trifle of lightness in the handling,
a little depth in the quality. To l^r is
yet to come the last freedom, grip, au
thority; but that she will arrive is
certain, for her present achievement Is
big with promise. She has conscience and
Industry and numbers but a score and five
years to her pretty name. Miss Manner
ing's work has substance and roundness,
charm, finish, repose and individuality.
It is easily likely, therefore, that the
years will add the necessary elasticity
and grip. â¢
Thursday afternoon next will afford a
valued opportunity to see Miss Mannering
in a new light. Playing In "Janice Mere
dith" to please her management, proba
bly to please herself the charming ac
tress will essay the title role in "Camllle."
It will be the first time that she has at
tempted the part, therefore an occasion
of peculiar Interest. The support Is sure
to be good. Drouet will appear as Ar

WARMLY DEFENDS
ADMIRAL SCHLEY
Arctic Explorer Refutes
the Mean Charge of
Cowardice.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.-At the; eighth
annual dinner of the Arctic Club, held at
the Hotel Marlborough to-night, Amos
Bonsai of Philadelphia, the only survivor
of the Kane expedition In 1853-53, in
speaking of the bravery of men who have
visited the Arctic and Antarctic regions
said:
There was a charge against our member (Ad
miral Srhley) of being a coward, the meanest
charge that could ever be brought against any
man. No man who has the courage to enter
the Arctic i>ack, as he did, and rescue General
Greely car^ever be charged with such an of
fense, ana I deny It and oppose It.
The speaker's reference to Admiral
(then captain) Schley's command of the
Greely relief expedition in 1S84 was ap
plauded for some minutes. The expedi
tion brought Lieutenant Greely and six
survivors back from the frozen north.
President William H. Brewer was at
the head of the table and among those
present were: George II. Daniels, Dr.
Henry Leipzlger. Dr. Frederick A. Cook
and Henry C. Walsh of the Miranda ex
pedition; Henry G. Brayant of the Peary
(1892) expedition, Charles A. Moore Jr. of
the Peary (1894) expedition; Francis Long
of the Greely expedition, James D. Dewell
of the Miranda party and about sixty
members of the club. Good wishes and
success were drunk standing to Peary,
who is an honorary member of the club;
E. B. Baldwin and other members of the
Baldwin-ZIegler expedirlon, and Frank W.
Stokes, with the Nordenskjold Antarctic
expedition.

CONSUMPTION
CAN BE CURED
Thus Reports an Official
Commission in
France.
Declares That the "Wasting
Disease Is Spread by
Expectoration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL 'BUREAU, 1406 G- STREET, N.
W v WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.âConsump
tion Is curable, according to the report of
a commission of . French savants who
made an exhaustive Investigation of the
disease. Secretary Hay has received from,
J. B. Scovel, United States Consul at
Lyons, France, a translation of the re
port. The commission consisted of thirty
two members and was appointed by the
French Parliament to inquire into the
subject of pulmonary tuberculosis, its
ravages In France, the cause of its preva
lence and the progress made toward its
cure. ij
The mortality- from consumption in
France is very heavy, 150,000 persons dy
ing of the disease annually.
The breath of a consumptive does not
transmit the disease, according to the re
port. The air which he expels does not
contain germs. It Is the spittle, dried and
reduced to dust, which is generally the
agent of contagion. It is contended that
this dry spittle clings to the walla, furni
ture and floor of the patient's room for
months and even years.
It is shown, on the contrary, that sun
light destroys the bacilli. Alcohol makes
the best bed for tuberculosis. The depart
ments of France which are the greatest
centers for tuberculosis â¢ are almost
always those in which there is the great
est consumption of alcohol'. Among the
precautions urged is prevention of the
act of expectoration on the ground and
profuse sprinkling before sweeping.
The report declares that consumption is
curable at all stages. Dr. Darfberg is
quoted as having said:
"During the last ten years I have cured
a number of consumptives, who have re
sumed their active occupations, have
married and now have healthy children.
I can even say that I, myself, am the
consumptive that I know best whom, I
have cured. I am, therefore, able to con
firm that consumption is curable."
Pure air, such as is found on the sea
shore and on high mountains, is the best
remedy for consumption. In order that
this remedy should be effective it should
be continuous. The patients should ncft
only keep their windows and doors open
night and day, but should persevere In
this air cure for a long time;

A COMMON TROUBLE. â¢
Thousands Suffer Prom It Without
. Knowing Its Heal Character.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.

are to blame, are surprised that they are
not cured by nerve medicines and spring
remedies; the real seat of jhe miachiei:
is lost eight of; the stomach ia the organ

Nervous ayspeptlcs often do not have
any pain whatever in the stomach, nor
perhaps any of. the usual symptoms of i
stomach weakness. Nervous dyspepsia
shows itself not In the stomach ao much
as in nearly every other organ; in some
cases the heart palpitates and is irregu-
lar; in others the kidneys are affected;
in others the bowels are troubled, wkh
loss of flesh and appetite, with the ac-
cumulation of gas, sour risings and heari-
burn.

"A motive of pure gratitude prompts mo

new and valuable medicine, Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I have been a sufferer
from nervous dyspesia for the last four
years; have used various patent medicines
arid other remedies without any favorable
result. They sometimes gave temporary
relief until the effects of the medicine
wore off. I attributed this to my sedentary
habits, being a bookkeeper with littl*
physical exercise, but I am glad to state
that the tablets have overcome all these'

THEIR CHARTERS
MAY BE REVOKED
Suits Are Commenced in
Ohio Against Fotir
Railroads.
COLUMBUS, Dec. 28.â Suits in quo
warranto were brought to-day In the Cir
cuit Courts of Crawford and Logan
counties to revoke the charters of the
Columbus, Hocking Valley and Toledo
Railway Company, the Ohio Central Rail
way Company, the Kanawha and Michi
gan Railway Company, the Buckeye Coal
and Raftway Company and the Sunday
Creek Coal Company. The suits were
brought in the names of the prosecuting
attorneys of Crawford and Logan coun
ties. They were prepared by Frank
Monett, former Attorney General and
now attorney for the Anti-Trust League,
David F. Pugh and E. B. Finley. The
charters of the companies are attacked
on the ground that they aro controlled
and operated as one in violation of the
State laws forbidding combinations in re
straint of trade and the consolidation of
parallel lines of railroad. The properties
mentioned are all popularly supposed to
be controlled by the Morgan syndicate.
For a first cause of action it is claimed
the corporations are operating in viola
tion of the statute of March 18, 1SS2, for
bidding the aid of one" corporation by an
other through subscriptions to its capital
stock and prohibiting the lease or pur
chase of a railway by a parallel line. It
is charged that the Hocking Valley and
Ohlb Central are virtually consolidated
and that their stock is identical.
For a second cause of action the plain
tiff cites section 4427 of the Ohio anti
trust law and charges that the defendant
companies are In a combination as shown
by their having given joint mortgages.
It is also charged that they have con
spired together to limit the production
of coal, while increasing the price of ship
ment and the cost to the consumer. It
is charged that tho^railroads named are
in a combination In violation of the law
as to freight and passenger rates cover
ing all forms of traffic. The companies
are charged with shutting off the supply
of coal to manufacturers and fixing a
common standard for aJl their operations.
For a third cause "of action evasion of
taxation and falsely returned valuations
are charged. It is charged that the
blanks for filing the taxable property of
the Hocking Valley Railway mailed to
the. proper officers by the Auditor of
State, April V, 1901, were returned with
schedules showing property susceptible
to taxation aggregating J4.696.O6O, where
as the company's taxableÂ»property at the
time was in reality $45,658,605 77.
Monett refused to say by whom *the
suits were instigated. He denied a rumor
that Mayor Tom Johnson of Cleveland
was back of them,' but said that Johnson
was Interested in the prosecution of the
cases. â  js**; \

BELMONT WINS
OVER O'GRADY
New York Election Com
missioners Decide
Contest.
XEW YORK, Dec. 28.â The Board of
Election Commissioner met to-day to
hear the protests in the Belmont-O'Grady
contest over the Democratic nomination
for Congress in the Seventh district. It
was announced that the case would be
taken to the Supreme Court, no matter
what decision the Election Commissioners
might make. â¢ . . -
This evening the board sustained the
objection to the certificate of John
O'Grady, threw out the objection against
the nomination of Perry Belmont and or
dered that the nomination of Belmont be
filed and that his name be placed on the
official ballot under the emblem of the
Democratic party.
On the evidence submitted to the board
the nomination of O'Grafly was not made
in accordance with law and the usages of
the Democratic party. The vote taken by
the board stood 3 to 1.
Thje board also threw out the certi
ficates of nomination of Koag and Ward,
the Prohibition and Social Democratic
candidates, respectively. This action
leaves four candidates in the. field. They
are: Montague Lester, Republican; Per
ry Belmont, Democrat; Fritz Llninger,
Independent, and J. Bennett, Greater New
York Democracy. Bennett becomes a can
didate by petition through what was an
nounced as a convention of the Greater
New York Democracy, held last Thursday

JUDGE GRAHAM
FREES FERRAL
Holds That Commitment
for Contempt Is In
sufficient.
Attorney Robert Ferral, who was fined
$50, with the alternative of twenty-five
4ays in jail, for contempt of court by
Judge Dunne, was ordered released from
the custody of the Sheriff yesterday by
Judg^e Graham. Ferral, an hour after he
had been adjudged guilty of contempt,
applied for a writ of hebeas corpus and
the decision of Judge Graham yesterday
was the result of the application.
Judge Graham ordered Ferral's release
on the ground that the commitment was
insufficient.
In the opinion of Judge Graham the
commitment does not purport, upon its
face, to be a judgment, but a mere nar
rative by the clerk of events which had
transpired under his observation, or
which had come to his knowledge. It does
not purport to be a transcript of any
judgment record, nor does it appear that
any judgment was entered. There is
nothing in the instrument to show that
an order was given by the Judge of the
court and the form of the order followed
by tne signature of the clerk Indicates it
is the clerk's order. .
"I am therefore.' says Judge Graham,
"clearly of the opinion that the instru
ment returned by the Sheriff as his au
thority and warrant for imprisoning the
prisoner is Invalid, and is insufficient to
justify the imprisonment and restraint of
petitioner, and that he should be dis
charged from custody.
"It is not necessary here to consider
other objections to the purported Judg
ment, strenuously urged by petitioner's
counsel. The invalidity of the instrument
In auestion. for the reasons above stated,
renders it immaterial -whether the part
taken by petitioner In the colloquy, re
cited as the basis of his conviction, would
be fcufficlent. of Itself, and without any
element of disorder, insolence or con
temptuous maner. to constitute contempt
of court."
Opposes Attorney's Appointment.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs filed a protest yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors â¢ against the ap
pointment of Joseph E. O'Donnell, or any
other attorney, to assist the City Attorney
in recovering moneys due this city by the
State. It Is contended that the charter
does not provide for such appointment.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1901.
GAIN IN SALES
IS BY MILLIONS
Realty Makes ' a Great
Show in Aggregate
This Year.
Eleven Months Lead 1900 by
a Margin of First â¢
Magnitude.
The sales of realty in Ban Francisco
during the first eleven months of the
present year have amounted to $25,000,000
in round figures. What the total for the
year will be cannot be safely predicted,
but tho indications are that tho present
month will make very heavy additions to
tho record for 1901. Large transactions
are under way at this time which, if they
are finally wound up in the next two
days, will make a fine record for the
month of December, 1901.
Without the last month of this year
tho record for 1901, up to the end of No
vember, leads the total for, tho entire
year of 1900 by $7,000,000 in round figures.
What the total for the year would have
been if the strikes had not taken place
in this city it is difficult to apwoxim'ate.
The total quoted Justifies amply all the
predictions that have been made con
cerning the market for realty during the
several past months. At the close of 1901,
according to the views of the conservative
brokers, the situation is better than it
has been for a long time. There will
naturally be a lull for a few days while
the merchants are taking stock, but this
will be . only a brief interruption and it
may prove to be of inconsiderable effect.

eral transactions of note. A fifty vara

SMALL LEGACY
FOR THE HUSBAND
Mrs. Vogelman Leaves
Bulk of Large Estate
to Children.
Filing of Will Recalls a Fa
mous Naval Court-
Martial. : .
The will of Mrs. Harriet J. Vogelman,
the wealthy wife of Dr. D. J. Vogelmaq,
a dentist of Vallejo, waa filed for probate
yesterday. She leaves her husband $1000,
Emily C. Swift, an. aunt, "$2000, and the
re'sidue of her estate, which Is located in
Vallejo and is worth $200,000,' to Albert
Wilson Tobin and Helen Marie Tobln,
children by a former marriage.
' Mrs. Vogelman was the sister of G. W.
Wilson, president of the Vallejo Commer
cial Bank, which institution was founded
iiLthe early F 50's by E. J. Wilson, their
f/lher. Mrs. Vogelman's first husband
was the late W. J. Tobin, a pay clerk in
the United States navy and one of Val
lejo's wealthiest young men. The two
children to whom Mrs. Vogelman left her
estate are the result of this union. Their
married life was an unhappy one and
Mrs. Tobin secured a divorce, subsequent
ly marrying Dr. Vogelman. Tobin later
married Grade Plaisted, the well-known
actress, who. was also a Vallejo girl. His
second matrimonial -venture was also a
failure, for Grade Plaisted Tobln also
sued him for divorce. He then became a
clerk in the navy and was very prom
inent "through his connection with Pay
master Webster, whose, court-martial at
Mare Island some few years ago attract
ed great attention. It was brought about
through a charge made by Tobin that
Webster had charged his mother, the late"
Mrs. J. F. Tobin, $1000 for his appointment
as pay clerk, claiming that the $1000 was a
bond required of all pay clerks in the ser
vice. The court-martial lasted several
weeks and resulted in Webster's suspen
sion and reduction in rank.
Mrs. Vogelman names her husband and
A. Heynemann as executors of her es
tate. .

Work on more than 500 houses in con
struction in Los Angeles has been stopped
on acount of a shortage in laths. The
price has been raised to $6 per thousand.
A builder who has been talking to the Loa
Angeles Herald makes the statement that
the laths have been cornered and are only
procurable at one yard in Los Angeles,
and that there is a corner forming or
formed to control and raise the price of
shingles and redwood rustic Concerning
the situation the Los Angeles Herald
says: -.Vv-
Building in Loa Angeles has been seriously
retarded by a dearth of laths in the local
market, and It has been charged that . the
shortage in this material Is duÂ£ to an attempt
on the part of the lumber dealers to form a
combination for the . purpose of cornering the
market and thereby raisins the price of that
commodity. . For several weeks ' builders have
been unable' to secure all the laths needed for
the numerous buildings In course of construc
tion. The number on which Interior work has
been held back, it is estimated, runs into the
hundreds, causing, a loss of much tlme^ to
lathers and > plasterers as well -as other . work
men. As to the reason for this shortage the
lumber men claim it Is due to their Inability
to ; procure sufficient material â - to supply - the
hundreds of new structures, while others have
stated the belief that It has been caused by a
movement to force up prices. -. ,Â« }'

Regiment by the discharge of twenty
three men from the service for various
causes, such as removal from the city,
good of the service, term expired, five en
listments In the army and one appoint
ment on the police force. This brings the
regiment to the lowest point since its're
organization after the return from Ma
nila as the First California. During the
past month there were six enlistments.
Colonel O'Neil hopes with the advent of
the new year, when work will be re
sumed, to create a spirit of enthusiasm
that will spur the company commanders
to recruit up their companies' to within at
least 75 per cent of the maximum.
There is a report In circulation that one
of the companies of the First Infantry is
anxious to withdraw from the regiment
and organize as an independent artillery
battery. Those who are said to be at the
head of the movement refuse to discuss
the matter at this time.
Orders have been' issued by Major Bush,
commanding the first battalion of artil
lery, to the effect that, commencing Mon
day, January 20, there will be guard
mount every Monday at the . battalion
armory. The detail, for the guard is one
lieutenant, one sergeant, one corporal, one
musician and seven privates.
The following promotions are announced
in the battalion: Private Harry W. Mitch
ell of Battery B and Private Franklin H.
Locke of Battery A, each to the rank of
corporal; Private John W. Ellery- of Bat
tery C has been advanced to musician.
Upon recommendation of the command
er of Battery D, Corporal William K.
Bush has been reduced to the ranks for
neglect of duty, and Corporal Frederick
It. Haigh has been reduced at his own re
quest.
Twenty-one men have been discharged
from the regiment, ten on account of re
moval, eight for good of the service and
one each for term expired, dropped and
enlisted in the United States navy.
The major in reviewing the organiza
tion says:
There is every inducement to cause auch an
increase; a popular branch of the service, the
only artillery force in the State, line quarters,
new uniforms, a host of friends and a recog
nized appreciation on the part of superior
headquarters and the citizens of this city.
There is, therefore, every incentive to make
this the banner military organization of the
Pacific Coast, not only tn numbers, but in dU
cipllne and esprit de corps. Every officer and
man must assist. No laggards are wanted. A
strict and prompt attention to all duties on the
part of officers and men is required and will
be enforced. "Forward!" must be the counter
sign for the nfew year.
During the ' year there will be practice
marches, lectures and other entertainments.

Company B of the First Infantry (the
old City Guard) held its sixTeenth annual
high Jinks In Union Square Hall last
week, on which occasion Lieutenant W.
N. Kelly acted as sire. The hall was
crowded with active members, ex-mem
bers, honorary members and friends.
Among the number were Colonel "W. C.
Little, who was captain of the company
for four years from 1861; Colonel George
R. Burdlck, who was captain from 18S5
for six years, and Major I. B. Cook, who
succeeded him for six years. During the
evening there were distributed handsome
prizes to each member of the company
who took part in the company shoot on
Thanksgiving day. There , were also
awarded the Taylor and Poole medals,
which were won by Sergeant Charles Lin
decker and Private A. Hoffman, respec
tively. Tbe Jinks was an unqualified suc
cess, the festivities continuing until mid
night, the principal contributors of num
bers being Richard Whalen, William
Hynes, Dr. W. H. Sieberst. Arthur Clif
ford, John : Fitzpatrick. Ed Treboiss,
George Keane. tbe Athenian Quartet.
members of the Olympic Club and Frank
M. Kelly. A pleasing feature of the even
ing was the presentation of a handsome
reclining chair to Lieutenant A. F.
""Ramm. who recently retired from active
service after having served sixteen years
in the company.
A square meal is one that will go
round.
PEACE AND GOOD WILL
EEIGN AT ST. PAUL'S
Bishop Nichols, Wills Approving the
Election of Board of Vestrymen,
Denounces Dissension.
Shaking hands all around may possibly
be the outcome of the heated controver
sies which have for some time been the
unhappy vogue among the portion of the
flock which learns of peace and good will
and brotherhood and the golden rule at
St. Paul's Episcopal Church. The Right
Reverend Bishop Nichols, In response to
appeals, has approved the election which
was the bone of contention between
Eugene R. Ellis, A. C. Rulofson and Dr.
Hlmmelsbach and the Rev. Dr. Reilly.
The charge against the pastor was that
he had controlled a meeting whereby ha
was enabled to place In office those of his
choice. He is now vindicated by Bishon
Nichols, who, at the same time, disap
proves of factional dlffarenAp among
any part of the worshipers atWt. Paul's.

IT IS IMPORTANT
To Know What You Are Taking
When Using Catarrh Medicine.
Catarrh. Is the short rout* to consump-
tion, and the Importance of early and Ju-
dlcious treaiment of catarrh, whether lo-
cated In thÂ« head, throat or bronchial
tubes, cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The list of catarrh cures Is as long as
Â£Ee~ moral la-w and the forms In which
the/ are administered numerous and con-
fusing, from sprays, inhalers, washes,
ointments and salves to powders, liquids
And tablets.
The tablet form is undoubtedly the most
convenient and the most effective, but
â¢with nearly all advertised catarrh reme-
dies it is almost entirely a matter of
jeuesswork as to what you are taking Into
your system, as the proprietors, while
taaking all sorts of claims as to what
'their medicines will do, always keep it a
.close secret as to what they are.
The success and popularity of the new
catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, is
largely because it not only cures catarrh
but because catarrh sufferers who use these
tablets know what they are taking into
their systems. Btuart's Catarrh Tablets
Â£TÂ© composed of Red Gum, Blood Root
fend similar valuable and antiseptic ingre-
dients, and ere pleasant to the taste and
dissolved in the mouth they take
immediate effect upon the mucous lining
Â©f the throat, nasal passages and whole
respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished in old chronic cases of
catarrh are little short of remarkable, and
the advantage of knowing what you are
cutting into your stomach is of para-
mount importance when It is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
beei frequently contracted as the result
tit using secret catarrh remedies.
Btuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval from physicians, because
their antiseptic character render them
o'erfectly safe for the general public to uso
and their composition makes them a com-
mon sense cure for all forms of catarrhal
troubles.
All druggists sell them at 50 cts. for full

est in connection with any of the vessels,
excepting that seven of the steerage pas
sengers on the Curacao were detained and
that the Coptic took away nearly $500,000
In treasure. The Hawaiian made a record
run from New York, covering the dis
tance, with two stops, in sixty-one days,
â¢which is a remarkably fine showing for a
freighter.
The Pacific Mail Company's San Juan
was also among the departing fleet. She
took away about a dozen passengers and
a large cargo.
The French mail boat Ajistralia is be
hind time from Tahiti, that is if she got
away on her regular sailing day. Papeete
is a small port, however, and the accom
dation for shipping is none of the best.
Then, again Government letters may have
to be written at the last moment and
that might have detained the vessel. The
Australia will undoubtedly come in early
this morning.
LATTNCHTNG OF THE S0QX7EL.
The Soquel, a splendid new four
masted schooner, which is destined to
play a prominent part in the coast lum
ber traffic, was successfully launched
yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock at Stone's
shipyard at Harbor View. The ceremony
of dispatching the new craft from, her
cradle into the waters of the bay was
accomplished without a hitch. As the
last restraining blocks were knocked
from beneath her keel, and as she com
menced to glide gracefully down the de
cline, Miss Clara Schaefer broke a bot
tle of champagne over her bow and
christened her the "Soquel," which means
Indian Chief.
The new vessel drifted several hundred
feet out into the water and was taken in
tow by the Sea Queen. She was towed
around to pier No. 2 at the foot of Mis
sion street, where she will be rigged and
prepared for service.
The SoQuel was built for J. R. Hanify
& Co., the wholesale lumber dealers. Her
keel Is 185 feet long, she is fifteen feet
deep, forty-one feet wide and has a ca
pacity of 1,000,000 feet of lumber. It Is ex
pected that she will be completely
equipped in about a month. The Soquel
will be by far the best built and speediest
boat engaged In the local lumber business.
Captain O. Anderson, formerly of the
Luzon, has been selected to take charge
of the new boat.
Sailing of the Coptic.
The Occidental & Oriental Steamship
Company's Coptic sailed for Hongkong,

Curacao Arrives From. Mexico.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Curacao arrived from Mexican ports yes
terday after a very fair run. The first
day out from San Francisco the most In
teresting event of the voyage occurred.
A baby girl was brought into the world,
and all the women folk were kept busy
for hours, and in consequence forgot all
about their seasickness. Before the ves
sel reached Mazatlan the baby had been
christened Curacao Vesquez, and as such
she will be known through life. The of
ficers and crew all made up a fund and a
silver christening mug was bought for the
little one. The father of the child had
been working at the Union Iron Works,
but wanted to get back to Mexico, so he
hurried his wife away, much against her
will. Both mother and child were doing
well when the Curacao left Mazatlan on
her way home. Those who came up on
the Curacao are:
J. S. Corrlgan, W. S. Hlatt, Claude Domboy,
Barah Sabin, Panfilo R. Santlni, John Coiaulo,
W, J. Heney, J. W. Carlson, Anton Planner,

W. J. Heney is the representative of
Flores, Hale & Co. at Magdalena Bay.
and comes up on business connected with
the concern. The company has started a
manufactory of fiber out of the sisal plant
and Is said to be doing well.

CORONER'S JURY
BLAMES COFFEY
Inquiries Into Cause of
Deaths of Savarino
and Gardoni.
Local Official Declaration Is
Made Regarding the Up
lands Wreck.
A Coroner's Jury heard the testimony
terday concerning thÂ© deaths of Francis
Savarino and Johti Gardoni, who died
from injuries received In the Uplands
railroad -wreck on December 19, and re
turned a verdict which fastens the blame
of the disaster upon Engineer John "W.
Coffey. The inquest rcom was crowded
almost to suffocation with eager listeners.
Especially interesting was the testimony
of Coffey, thÂ© man who piloted the Ill
fated train to destruction.
Harrr Preston Wallis, conductor of
train ICo. 10, southbound, of which O.
Konold was engineer, testified that- he
received orders at King City, at which
place he arrived at 12:11 on the morning
of the disaster. He left King City at
12:40 with the order to meet train No. 9
at Uplands, where he was to take the
Elding. He said that when he approached â 
the Biding: the train was slowing down
and when the collision took place it was
almost. at a standstill. The brakes were
set on solid. "When we ran into N"o. 10
It was like going into a. mountain and for
this reason No. 10 was not materially
damaged," he said. "In another half
minute the engineer would have had time
to reverse the engine."
A. Konold. engineer of No. 10, gave tes
timony that did not entirely agree with
that of the conductor. He said that he
saw the approaching train two miles
away and slowed down to get the switch.
He blew the whistle one-half mile away,
but there was no way of warning: the
engineer of the other train. "My train
wes moving five miles an hour when we
collided," he said. "I put on the emer
gency brakes and Jumped, giving a warn
ing- to the fireman."
W. J. Williams, conductor on train No.
9, testified that he received orders at San

From the side step he saw No. 10 ap

saw the switch light which . he passed,

knew of nothing that should engage the
attention of the engineer outside of his
Immediate work.
Then Coffey was called. It was evi

the train In its mad ride to ruin.
"When we reached Santa Margnerita,"
he said, "the engine was in good trim-
There was nothing on my mind to worry
me. I received the orders and understood
them.
"Some trains differ from others in the
handling and this was my first time with
this engine. The injector on the left side
was working properly. I supposed the
injector on the right side was working
right, but had never seen one of that
make before. The engineer who brought
the locomotive down told me about the
new injector and how it worked. At Santa
Marguerita I worked on it and found
that I was forced to give it more than
usual attention to see that it furnished
the boiler a proper amount of water. As
it did not work to my satisfaction I made
the greater part cf the run with one in
jector."

cepted Masons, the Italian lodge
of this city, had its officers In
stalled in the Masonic Temple last
night in the presence of about 120
members of the craft. The work -was in
the Italian language by James A. Devoto,
the retiring master, assisted by F. Cavag

was a presentation of a handsome Jewel
to retiring Master Devoto. It is sur
mounted with a grold plate, on which is
worked in gold and enamel the emblem
of the Knigrhts Templar. In addition
there is a gold sunburst pin and a ring,
intended for Mrs. Devoto. In these may
be inserted a fine diamond solitaire,
which forms the head of the compass in
the Jewel. This, it was explained, was
intended as a. peace offering to Mrs. De
voto for having permitted her husband
to be at lodge as many times as he had
to be in order to reach the highest sta
tion in it.
The lodge has. during the last term,
made a wonderful record, having had a
remarkable increase in finance and in
membership. It initiated eighteen and
raised twelve. The membership now is
127.

Scully's Vivid Imagination.
Joseph Hainey, proprietor of the sa
loon at 1C56 Market street, called upon
Judge Mogan yesterday and declared that
the staements made by James O. Scully
to the effect that William M. Gregory had
attempted to kill' him with two revolvers
in the saloon on Christmas evening was
devoid of truth. Hainey stated that
Scully was not a bartender in his saloon,
and as he was present while Gregory was
there he asserted, that nothing of the
kind occurred, but was a figment of
Scully's imagination. The Judge sent an
order to the police to withdraw the war
rant for Gregory's arrest, as he had been
Imposed upon by Scully.
D. L. Cobb, a barber of Santa Rosa, is

and spent the money. Now William Mar
shall of San Rafael, a brother of Mrs.
Grewell, steps in and says that Cobb is a
married man. This the latter denies, and
says he was divorced three months ago,
and that Mrs. Grewell ' gave him the
money of her own free "will.

GENERAL YOUNG
TO STAY HERE
Military Courtesy Gives
j Commanders Privi
lege %o Choose.
Gallant Soldier Satisfied With
N the Department of
California.
Rumors and positive statements have
been afloat and made to the effect that
Major General Young, in command of the
Department of California, would assume
command of the Department of the Lakes
with headquarters at Chicago. It has also
been stated with rare posltiveness that
the change was at the general's own re
quest. Such information had been circu
lated freely throughout the country, and
probably originated in the fact of the ap
proaching retirement of Major General
Otis owing to the operation of 'the law
which governs age service. The fact is
that the generals who have hitherto been
in command of the Department of Califor
nia have remained in that capacity for
a long period, and as Major Gen
eral Young assumed command on the
retirement of General Shafter as recently
as July 1 last, the statement of his so soon
going to another department, and at his
own request, has naturally atoused won
derment in both military and civil circles.
The senior major general is at the pres
ent time Major General John R. Brooke,
commanding the Department of the East,
with headquarters in New York, and the
next major general in rank is Major Gen
eral Otis, in command of the Department
of the Lakes. It is an important com
mand and takes in Wisconsin, Michigan,
Illinois, Indiana. Ohio, Kentucky and Ten
nessee. On the retirement of General Otis,*
according to long standing custom, Major
General Young: will be assigned to the
command of his department, but there is
a military courtesy, which ia punctiliously
observed before assignments of this char
aracter are made, in the form of a request
to the general officer concerned to state
his preference. It is understood that this
has not yet been done, and also that Ma
jor General Young is very well satisfied
with his present command in San Fran
cisco.

DEPARTURE FROM THE CITY.
Interesting Information Provided for
Benighted Sons of the Desert.
The recently elected illustrious potentate
of Islam Temple, N. O. A- A. M. S. Col
onel Charles H. Murphy, and his staff of
officers, together with a number of the
illustrious nobles of- the temple, left this
city yesterday afternoon for the plains
of Marysville, where the new officers
were to make their first effort In the
line of conferring the degree of the
Arabic Temple upon a class of individuals
who, having passed through the Blue
Lodge and having learned all about the
order in the chapter, were anxious to get
into the "playground" of the fraternity,
as the domain of the Shriners has been
termed.
They did not go as an organized body.
They boarded the boat singly. In pairs
and in bunches of half a dozen. Each
carried a traveling case containing a dress
suit, a fez, pyrotechnics and small bot
tles of the elixir of "zem zem" water.
The notice to the members of the temple
conveyed the Information that the session
was to be held in memory of Abdoo'l-
Wahab, founder of the sect of Wahabe.es,
who was a smasher of Images, and de
stroyed beautiful works of art and build
ings without regret.
The Marysville event was arranged by
a special dispensation from the imperial
potentate, Noble Philip C. Shaffer, and
was for the sole purpose of. conferring
the degre* on forty or more benighted
sons of the desert. There were also given
the following Instructions to the novices
who were anxious to fathom the Oriental
G. W. Moebius and John D. Spreckels of
San Francisco,' G. D. Pierce and E. H.
Wlng of Oakland, F. Jordan of Los An
geles, M.-J. Cushing of Sacramento and
J. L. Hayden of the United States army.
Testerday the sublime ceremony of con
ferring this, the last and highest degree
of Masonry, was conducted in the Ma
sonic Temple by W. F. Frank Pierce of
Oakland, inspector general, assisted by
Thomas H. Goodman. This ceremony,
which was in the^presence of members of
that degree only, occupied more than an
hour and a half and was listened to with
marked attention by all present.
Advertisers' Convention.
Arrangements are being made for a con
vention of general advertisers to be held
at Delmonlco's, New York, on Wednes

interesting programme, embracing some
of the most important questions in the
field of advertising, has been prepared,
and it is expected that a large number of
advertisers from all parts of the country
will attend. There will be a banquet on
Wcdm-sday evening, at which some of the
prominent publishers of the country will

is the discovery that there are fashions
in pieties as well as petticoats.

would meet with vigorous opposition ac
tion was deferred until the next regular
meeting. â¢
Most of the evening was devoted to the
discussion of a rich menu. The* toast

OF THE MAYOR
AT A BANQUET

Talk on Municipal
Government.
Prominent Citizens Bestow Honor..
Upon James D. Phelan During
His Last Bays in Public
Office. /
James D. Phelan, thrice elected Mayor
of San Francisco, sat in silence at a com-'
plimentary banquet tendered him last
night in the maple room of the Palace
Hotel by the officials of this city, and
drank in words of commendation from
every tongue. His political followers
gathered round the board to say farewell
to him with wine and toast. The Mayor
was the guest of honor. Flanked on" either
side were friends whose advice and whose
labor, he has commanded during the five
years of his political service.
Every governmental department of the
city was representedâ legislative, judicial,
administrative. Not only did the banquet
ers represent Phelan' s own political . per
suasion, but parties that fought him tooth.
and nail in campaigns that have become
city history. On the eve of his farewell to
political lifeâ temporary or permanent, as
it may be â his friends bade him . God
speed and voiced compliments - to', him.
More like a happy family, it was than
anything else. The guests called one an
other by first names, told again the story
of the charter and its.'ydung father, en-'
graved mental tablets of its ; early devel
opers and went away '.from the banquet
hall happy over a good dinner, good wines!
and the flow of wisdom. V- . â¢â¢â 
The tables ran from a . cross-table at
the head of the room. On Mayor Phelan's
left were Jasper McDonald, Dr. J. M. Wil-:
liamson, Rabbi Voorsanger,- David Starr
Jordan, Raphael Weill and Gavin McNab.'
On his right were. Chief Justice Beatty :
and Fred Stratton. Mayor-elect Schmitz'
was not present, ;;though= among the in-^
vited guests. He attended a banquet last
night given by Niantic r Pafl or "of" the Na
tive Sons. ' '.'â &â â ' â â â â '':"â 'â¢â¢* â¢â¢-.; : -; â ..â â¢â¢.â 'â ;â . ; -â â  '. .:;_[
The menu was most elaborate and â¢ the
speeches filled the listeners with delight
and brought' their hands, 'together ."time
and again, i Jasper , McDonald, labeled
in the programme as "our- "chairman,",
paid his tribute to the guest after the'
black coffee had been served.- When he!
had told that no man did more to elevate
the municipality and place honesty as the
foundation for public service than James
D. Phelan he was cheered to the echo.:
Then Dr. J. M. Williamson, toastmaster,
was introduced.
"I ask you as a preliminary," said the
doctor, "to drink the health of our hon
ored guest, James D. Phelan." In silence
the "burstins bubbles bringing happiness
and joy" were quaffed. Then the orches
tra played the Jolly good fellow song as
every man stood in his place, erect and
thoughtful.
"Our Guest," by Voorsanger.
The Rev. Jacob Voorsanger responded
to the toast, "Our Guest." He was in
proper mood last night and made one of
his characteristic speeches, which caught
the fancy of the banqueters and received
most enthusiastic applause whenever a
climactic period was reached. In part he
said:
A great many farewell banquets are riven
in Ireland. When a man is alive they call it
a farewell banquet: when he is dead they call
it a wake. The question then is, What shall
we say at a farewell banquet? I feel the dis
tinguished honor to' appear before these gentle
men this evening in order to reply to the toast
which you have so kindly selected for me. I
do confess, Mr. Chairman, that I am a fj-iend
of the Mayor. I have folldtjufcd his adjnfnis
tration with a great deal of Interest. I have
been fortunate enough to approve a great many
of his acts and when, according- tp ttjÂ£uoplnion
of some, he made his mistakes rstoodpy- him
nevertheless. I felt that was exactly the time
a man needed to stand by his friends, j
Now, Mr. Chairman, what Is the usual man
ner for one to reply? I confess I do not know.
I appear so little in what is exactly known as
society and I am so wedded to the retirement
of my own room that I cannot say in what
manner a toast like this should be answered.
I can only compare Mayor Phelan to Richard
Whittlngton, thrice Mayor of London. It
would be Improper to acknowledge in fulsome
flattery of the man and his deeds. I feel I
cannot do Justice to myself and to you, gen-'
tlemen. Mayor Phelan Is too old to take stock
in such phraseology and is too wise to be
drowned and smothered by the fulsome flat
tery of hla friends.
The Mayor has served >flve years. He haa
served the community according to his abil
ity. The question is. What will the future say
of what he haa done? There is too much of
thÂ« forgetting of men after they have retired
to private life. I will take you into my con
fidence.- I don't believe Mayor Phelan will be
retired to private life for a lonar time. {Ap
plause.) There is too much of forgetting of
men and what they have achieved, but there
is a way of remembering, there is a way of
recalling facts, and that is through history.
McNab on Good Government.
Following Rabbi Voorsanger's speech
came the reading of a regret from F. w.
Dohrmann. who was unable to attend.
He was placed on the card of after-dinner
speakers, but sickness In his family pre
vented his appearance.
Gavin McNab on "Good Government"
then added his store of words. He said
in part: â ;'..
I have attended many" banquets, but I have"
never known an occasion when men could be,
brought together at the conclusion of an ad
ministration and look one another in the face
and say that not one of us has done a dishonest
thing. while we served our city. This adminis
tration has given a new. character to San Fran
cisco officialism. In the development of munici
pal problems, this city by the Western seas is
in the vanguard. There has not been a scan
dal or crime . during the , time that this ad
ministration haa been in office.- San Francisco
has' tasted the grood of selr-respect. It has
been able to say that it has officers who are
above suspicion. â¢
Municipal integrity is demanding a higher
class of citizenship. -* Municipal . patriotism
ceases to be a. dogma and municipal citizen
ship must consequently stand for a higher serv
ice. That is. why. we are here now. San Fran
cisco has set the pace with its new charter and
we are here to do honor, to the man that gave
It its stimulus and who was always ready to

Jordan on the Ideal.
Professor David ' Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University was the next speaker in
troduced by Toastmaster â Williamson. He
discussed "Municipal Government in the
Twentieth Century," and in the course of
his remarks painted a beautiful picture
of what it ought to be. His speech was
a happy one and was greatly enjoyed by
his auditors. He took occasion to state
that it was due to Mayor Phelan that a
certain university possessed a magnificent
municipal law library and that he would
not have made this fact known to the
world but for the fact that. it was never
divulged by the generous benefactor. -
. President Benjamin Ide Wheeler was
unable to be present. He therefore sent
a letter of regret expressing his inability
to attend . the banquet, coupled with his
high opinion of the guest of honor. The
sentiments ..w;ere greeted .with applause.
Judge Frank Murasky was also unable
to attend the banquet and his short let
ter of regret was read to the assemblage.
Frank H. Gould was next called upon to
respond to the , toast, . "Benefits* of Non-
Partisan Municipal Government." ,He
dwelt on the fact that this metropolis
was so situated that it has derived all its
power from the outside world and would
continue to do so.
"We can do. a lot to help It on," fie
said. "And it was with that idea that a
young man in San Francisco several
years ago first launched into the politi
cal life. I believe I was present in 1894
at Native Sons'.. Hall on Mason \ street,
when the Mayor of San Francisco
made his maiden political speech. It
was a good one, but it is not a marker
to the one he can make to-flay. His
first speech was high toned and full of
high Ideals and by his administration he
has lived up to those high standards he
advocated bo many years ago. If. there
is an Ideal in non-partisan politics, that
ideal has been reached In this adminis
tration. The high-water mark of munici
pal efficiency has been reached in San
Francisco. There will be a retrogression,
tut it will only be temporary, as the peo
ple will not allow things to happen In the
future as in the past."
In conclusion Mr. Gould offered a toast
to the "ideal Mayor of San Francisco,"
and this was drunk with cheers.
Chief Justice Beatty was given an ova
tion when he arose to speak. He spoke
cf the reward that was due Mayor Phe-.
Ian and said he should.be pardoned and
commended for his acts of commission
and omission. â  v .
Frederick S. Stratton, Collector, of Cus
toms' of San'. Francisco,, was next intro
duced and scored an instant; hit by stat
ing that he feared to make a speech, as
his remarks might be taken in earnest
by his listeners. He illustrated his mean
ing by saying that a candidate for Mayor
on an opposition ticket, meaning Asa R.
Wells, -had at a banquet a. year ago an
nounced that the p'resent Board of Super
visors was the best the city ever had,
and this, in his opinion, led to their elecV
tion last November. Mr. Stratton com
mended the Mayor on his artistic and
forensic tastes. He said the : Mayor was
a patron of art and was doing much to
beautify the city ; that his ' speeches de
livered during his administration were
masterful.'. â¢ â¢â .â â¢â¢ ' -.-â¢/â  - â :

Colonel D. M. Burns left by steamer
yesterday for Mexico on a business trip.
He was accompanied by his wife.
who said that, although he had been ap
pointed a member of a commission by the
Mayor, he was not in duty bound to
sound his praises. He then expressed his
high opinion of Mr. Phelan and regretted
that he had to part with him.' He said
he wished that the Mayor had two more
years to serve, as he would, with the aid
of the new charter, make this â¢ city a
greater municipality.
Ovation for Phelan.
When Mayor Phelan arose to. speak the
chandeliers tingled with the noise of the
greeting given him. He â¢ was unable to
speak for fully three minutes. When he
did so he was given the closest attention
and throughout his address he was
roundly applauded. In part he said:
It is needless to say that I am very grateful
to you for this mark of your esteem.' I must
confess also ' that I feel s embarrassed. I really
expected to be called upon earlier in the even
ing when not .so much, had been said. I will
therefore try. and make my remarks very brief.
i My association has 'been so pleasant that I
leave you with great regret and reluctance.
President Andrew Jackson had an Irish servant,
we are told, who was erratic. His master said
to him, ."Pat. ; I can't stand this any longer.
We must separate." "And faix," said Pat, "in
which direction are ye going." (Laughter.) - 1
realize now that I am going and you are to,
remain. We have associated in all this work.
It is your work as much as mine and what
ever credit that is due the administration nec
essarily belongs to you.
â  Under the charter- it was my duty to appoint
something like thirty-three commissioners, rep
resenting all the executive functions of the
city government, and those commissioners have
done their work so well that the gentlemen
who are not members of the administration
mistake, perhaps, in giving me all the credit.
They should ' know as you should realize that
It* is your work that has brought credit - to
tha- civil administration of our affairs. It is
a nonpartisan government. It was so designed
by the charter, and it was necessary by hav
ing a separate test for election apart from na
tional and State elections, and the whole spirit
of our fundamental law proves that ours is a
business government and not a great political
concern.
â  When about five years ago I was nominated
for the office of Mayor it came to me in the
nature of a surprise. The city at that time
was rent with factions. The lylltlcal boss
had thriven more in San Francisco than in any
city In this country probably with the excep
tion of New York. The boss was omnipotent.
A man could not enter. He controlled the ave
nues to office, and when a man attained a high
position he was owned by his political roas
ter. Men so shaped their conduct in the mat
ter of appointments to insure the continued
favor of the political boss.
Now that was the first battle which was
waged in this city, and successfully waged â
to eliminate the political boss. The adoption
of the charter gave a new political life to San
Francisco and Insured thereafter its success
as a municipality. There are provisions - In
that instrument by which the government may
almost automatically be run. There has been
established â¢ a civil service which has . proved
a ban to political parties and to government
officials'. I only regret that civil service re
form . does not affect all the offices In San
Francisco. I â  regret to leave you because I
have been wedded to San Francisco and its In
terests for these "five years/ â¢â¢ ;

HIANTIC PARLOR HONORS
FOUR OF ITS MEMBERS
Banquets Eugene E. Schmitz, Lewis

Nlantlc Parlor of the Native Sons gave
a banquet last night in a Pine street
rotisserie in honor of tha four of its mem
bers who were elected to office at the
recent election. The men whom the Na
tives honored were Eugene E. Schmitz.
L. F. Byington, J. A. Lynch and A. B.

the parlor, with their invited guests, as
sembled around the banquet tables, which
were artistically decorated with flowers
and ferns. At the head of the table were
seated FInlay Cook, president of Niantic

front of the president was a beautiful
bunch of La France roses.
After the supper had been discussed and
those present were enjoying cigars the
toast master called on a number to make

FAVORITE PLAYERS ROUTED WITH SEVERE LOSSES AT THE RACETRACK OVER THE BAY
LAJOIE PLAYS
BRILLIANT BALL
Makes Some Apparently
Impossible "Stops"
Cleverly.
All-Americas Win Fast Game
From Nationals by a
Score of 4 to 3.
The Eastern baseball stars should give
the followers of the game a hint as to
when they expect to play good ball. One
of the best games of the season was
played yesterday before a small attend
ance. The "fans," probably expecting a
repetition of Triday's long drawn out
game, stayed away. The All-Americas
won by a score of 4 to 3.
Lajole was back in the game and ac
cepted three difficult chances at second.
His work is done so easily the specta
tors hardly appreciate his clever f.eld
inc.
Mertes was ordered off the field in the
eighth by Umpire McDonald for talking
too freely. As there was no one to take
his place the order v."as withdrawn, but
not until the threat was made by the
players, "One off the lield. all off."
Each team scored i:i the first inning.
For the All-Americas Barrett, Fraser and
Lajoie singled, scoring Barrett.
In the fifth they scored two runs. Sul
livan, the fir^t man up, was hit by pitch
er. He went to second on Bernhard's out
at first and scored on Pickering's two
bagger. Pickering went to third on Bar
rett's single to center. Van Haltren hit
to pitcher, and while Mertes was chasing
Barrett between Jirst and second Picker
ins sccred.
Their last run came in the sixth. Ir
v.in was safe on Briuliey's muff of a fly.
He went to second on Sullivan's single
and scored on a line drive which Bern
hard hit to Steinfeidt and which took an
unexpected bound as it approached the
shortstop and rolled out of reach.
Van Haltren scored the first run for
ihe Nationals. He hit safely and went
to second on a wild pitch. He scored on
Mertes' hit, which left the latter safe at
first en a close decision.
In the sixth listen singled over second,
advanced a bag on Mertes' out at first
end scored on Chance's two-bagger.
Van Haltren scored the third and last
run. He was safe on a hit past second,
vent to second on Hulen's sacrifice _nd
made his way home on Mertes' single. In
this inning McDonald had several close
decisions to render, and for a time it
seemed he would "call" the game, the
only punishment he coul.i inflict on the
players, if that could be called punish
ment.
The San Francisco team will play the
All-Americas to-day. It is announced by
the management that Iburg and Waddcil
â will be the opposing pitchers. The score.

HARES OOTFOOT
FAST COURSERS
Run-Down at Union Park
Results in Many Long
Wedgewood Is Made First
Choice in the Special
Hard coursing was the rule in the run
down of the two stakes yesterday at
Union Park. The hares were more than
a match for their speedy pursuers, and
but few of the points in the heavy scores
were credited for kills. During the past
six weeks the hares set a pace that sur
prised the leashmen. They kept up this
gait until last week, when a slackening
of speed was noticeable. Many followers
of the sport predicted easier going for the
coursers and shorter trials in the stakes.
The expected did not happen. From the
cpening of yesterday's sport the hares
gave evidence of renevVed vigor and led
the hounds on long journeys. As the
stakes progressed the hares seemed im
bued with greater strength, and although
relief dogs were called into play .on at
least a dozen occasions, three of --every
four hares liberated managed to reach the
welcome escapes.
Short ends were given decisions often
enough to make the day an unprofitable
one for the talent, a total of seventeen up
sets being recorded.
The running off of the first rounds of
two stakes on Saturday found favor with
coursing enthusiasts, the attendance
being noticeably larger than for many
months.
In the o^en stake Elista and May
Hempstead are even favorites at 6 to 1,
and from appearances they will contest
for honors in the deciding course. Lilac,
Veto and Jingle Bells are. at 8 to 1. Pe
pita, at 12 to 1, is a good outside chance.
Wedgewood is favorite in the special
event. He was favored with an easy
course and in consequence was backed
from 6 to 3 to 1. Narcissus Is at 4, Little
Sister 6. For Glory and Flora McDonald
S, and Master Rocket at 10 to 1.
Likely â¢winners in the second round of
the open stake are Bowery Boy, Royal
Friend, Elista, Daylight, Fair Oaks, Sara,
Sofala, Jingle Bells, May Hempstead.
Terronette, Pepita and Veto.
Winners in the special stake look to be
"Wedding Bells. Vandal. Naughty Gfrl.
Little Sister. Narcissus, Silver Cloud, For
Glory. Sir Pasha, Firm Fellow, Flora Mc-

THE SA N FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 29, 190i. '
POSITION, AN OVERLOOKED OUTSIDER,
BEATS WATERCURE FOR THE HANDICAP
Q AUNT-LOOKING and sad-eyed
and finally knocked down to a
sympathetic bidder for $35 at the
Palo Alto stock farm disposal
sale is the. history of the horse
which defeated Gre,en Morris' crack
Watercure for the handicap at Oakland
yesterday. In the betting on the Peralta
handicap, one "mile and a sixteenth; Po
sition, the entry of "Dell" Fountain/ was
among- those laid out on the bargain coun
ter. Fifteen to one, and at some of the
smaller shops where scalping was done 16
to 1. a tin whistle and a cake of barber
soap went with each purchase on Posi
tion. The race attracted a blgr crowd to
the track over the bay, and seven out of
ten Individuals entering the ring wanted a
ticket on Watercure, the top-weight, with
Winnie O'Connor in the pilot-house. The
latter horse carried 122 pounds, and then
came a fall of 14 stories to Andrisa, with a
toothpick or a boot.iack on most of the
others. Among these lightweights Icicle,
Jim Hale and Rio Shannon fell in for
more than passing consideration. There
seemed to be a premonition of disaster
for Watercure, possibly due to O'Connor's
unlucky streak of late, as 2 to 1 could
always be had about him.
From a spectacular point of view a more
exciting contest could not be wished for.
"Dick" Dwyer started the bunch of nine
on their journey in faultless fashion, with,
Ransch on Icicle away in front under in
structions to set a dizzy clip, followed by
Jim Hale, Andrisa and Rio Shannon. The
pace was too hot. for as the stretch was
neared Icicle melted and Jim Hale eag
erly waited for the gong to sound corners.
About this time the chances of Andrisa
looked bright, when the whole bunch
seemed to swoop down upon her until she
was buffeted about like a decoy duck on
Suisun Slough.
Near the paddock with it looking any
horse's race, spread out as they were
across the track, O'Connor on the favor
ite had worked his way to the firing line
and Watercure's name was shouted by
hundreds. But on the far outside a
brown gelding, ridden by Hoar, had been
making great strides to the fore, and de
spite O'Connor's desperate llnlsh, Posi
tion gained the honors by a neck, while
half a length back Varro. a 30 to 1 shot,
made matters very interesting. The win
ner's time for the distance was 1:46, mak
ing it a creditable performance. Water
cure was last around the turn after the
start, and of course had to take his
chances after that. With clearer sailing
he might have won.
This was not the only spill, though, for
a favorite. There were several others, for
in fact Homsestead alone saved the tal
ent from utter ruin. For those who
picked them Afghan, Favorito, Sunello,
Position and Byron Rose gave splendid
returns for the amount Invested. One
form student picked the^card and he is
now commander of the army of the
Queen of Bavaria.
Winnie O'Connor's tardiness In leaving
the barrier with Herculean in the opening
sprint worked the favorite's defeat. By
the time the head of the stretch was
reached Winnie had "little Willie" nearly
up with the leaders and appeared to have
the race in hand. Mounce on Afghan,
however, got through next the rail, beat
ing the favorite a head. The scale of
weights in this event was raised fifteen
pounds above the scale and the winner
covered the six furlongs in 1:14V*.
Apparently the jumping horses are im
proving, for the mile and a half hurdle
event was a pretty affair, resulting in the
win of Favorito, a 5 to 1 chance, ridden
by Mattier and carrying 142 pounds. Be
fore taking the last obstacle it .looked as
as if Phil Archibald, the favorite, piloted
by Peters, would land, but Favorito out
jumped him, winning almost easily at the
wire from Sam Green. The favorite ran
into the show.
On form It looked, as if Artilla was
the best of the six starters in the mile
and a quarter selling run, and, a 4 to 5
favorltg, the brown mare finished second.
Sunello, with Blrkenruth in the saddle
and 4 to 1, led from start to finish. Bums
astride the favorite did not furnish one ol
his best efforts, for after zigzagging about
lost by a length. Compass, a 30 to 1 shot,
ran third and Â£1 Mido fourth.
Green Morris" colt Homestead was com
pelled to step a mile in 1:40 to win the
two-year-old handicap, and then he only
laid Lapidus away by a head. O'Connor,
who rode the favorite, was cut off by
Royalty about three furlongs from tne
stand, and only led the Jennings entry
out in a hard drive. The stay of Botany
out in front was postponed after two
thirds of the distance had been traversed.
To get out, the losers all unloaded on
Autolight to take the last event, sending
the Morris horse to the post a 7 to 5 fa
vorite.- Slow, as usual, to get moving, the
brown fellow ran third. Byron Rose, an
8 to 1 shot, having Ransch in the saddle,
never relinquished the lead, downing
School for Scandal, another outsider, a
half-length.
Track Notes.
Twenty-one bookmakers again weighed
in. "Bill" Langford did a thriving busi
ness with his combination book, and the
two field books had all they could attend
to.
It is beginning to dawn on turfmen that
"Dell" Fountain is a pretty keen Judge of
horseflesh. In 1898 "Dell" bought Tempo
for $S0 and Inside of a month the chestnut
hirse was beaten but a head by Scottish
Chieftain in the Labor day handicap run
at Anaconda. Some weeks ago he pur
chased Position from J. Creeley for $700,
and the Racine gelding promises to de
velop into a better horse than Potentc.
This last named son of Racine was run
ning: around here in selling races, and
later on in the East captured the Omnium
handicap.
Winnie O'Connor, with "Dutch" Lewis,
left for Sacramento last night, where
Winnie, it is said, will put in a week of
rest at tlfe Haggin ranch.
A deal was consummated yesterday
wherein the New California Jockey Club
became the possessor of the Tanforan
Park, property, paying $S2,500 for the
plant. The property comprises eleven
acres of the choicest land in San Mateo
County, with about $300,000 worth of im
provements thereon.
HORSEMEN WHO RACE AT
CHARLESTON OUTLAWED
NEW YORK. Dec. 28.â B. O. Hanlon of
the jockey club, when seen to-day re
garding the status of the owners, train
ers and Jockeys who are running or rid
ing horses at the Charleston Industrial
Fair racecourse, said:
"The Charleston track Is neither recog
nized nor licensed by the Jockey club.
During the Brooklyn Jockey Club meet
ing last fall the Charleston people made
application for, a license and the jockey
club refused them. During the Bennings
meeting- a few weeks ago I was asked
by several horsemen as to what would
happen if they ran horses at the Charles
ton meeting. Although the rules are dis
tinct on the matter, I did not care to an
swer the question and^ telegraphed imme
diately to August Belmont, who sent the
following reply. 'Not being a regularly
licensed course, horsemen will get into
trouble through racing at the , Charleston
track.' Rules 1 and 7; of the rules of
racing are explicit in regard to thevmat
ter and make It unnecessary tot the
Jockey club to take action, as by violat
ing the rules owners, trainers and Jock
eys outlaw themselves."

WHITNEY SHOWS
SPORTING SPIRIT
Tennis Champion "Will
Meet Chet Smith in
Match Game.
Seeks to End Discussion
of Incident in Recent
Tournament.
George P. Whitney, a member of the
tournament committee of tb â¢ California.
Tennis Club, who won the class singles
held on the club courts Christmas day,
decided last night to play a match with
Chet Smith, who lost by default on
Wednesday. Smith was in the second
class, in which was the largest entry and
most evenly- matched players of any of
the classes.
The tournament commltee agreed to
postpone the play-off until to-day, but
after Smith had left the grounds Whitney
was in favor of playing It off at once.
Grant Smith and Charles Kuehn were the
other members of the committee present.
The former voted against this action,
while the Hatter refused to vote. The
tournament was played. This did not
meet with the approval of many of the
members of the club. Whitney considered
the best way out of the difficulty would
be to play Smith a match for the silver
cup. It will be played this morning and
Smith will receive "half thirty." the
handicap allowed by the committee.
Smith was In the half with Wood and
Collier and has expressed his Intention of
playing each of these men should ho de
feat Whitney. His first match would be
with Wood, who would receive "half
thirty." Should Smith beat Wood he
would next play Collier and receive, odds
of "fifteen." While Smith has little
chance of beating Whitney with the
handicap allowed him, he will at least
be afforded an opportunity of meeting' the
champion which he did not have on
Christmas day. Whitney has shown he
has the instinct of a sportsman by his
action in the matter.
Some interesting practice matches were
played yestrday on the courts of tÂ£e Cali
fornia Club. .Many one-set matches were
played on account of the overcrowded
condition of the courts.
In singles Carl Gardner surprised the
spectators by beating H. W. Crowell. The
score was 6-4, 3-3. George Whitney beat
Dr, Sumner Hardy, 3-2; A. A. Moore beat
M . Cerf, 6-4; Page Collier beat James Mc-
Kenzie, 6-4, 5-7, 7-5, 8-6; Harry Halght and
Chet Smith tied, 8-6, 1-3. Dr. Lane beat
Cerf, 6-1; C. Smith beat H. Schmidt. 6-4,
6-4; P. Collier beat John Gibson, 6-1. 6-0,
6-1, 6-1; J. G. Gibson Jr. tied J. G. Gibson
Sr., 6-4, 4-6; P. Kahn and Joe Lielienthal
tied, 5-5; C. S. Kempff beat P. Collier, 7-5,
6-0, 1-6, 7-5.
In doubles Fred Brown and Will Allen
joined forces and defeated Harold Crowell
and Herman Powers, 6-4, Â©3$, 6-0. The
Lane brothers beat Cerf and Moore, 4-6,
6-1, 6-2; Kahn and Dr. Phillip beat Mc-
Kenzie and Lillenthal, 6-2, 6-3, 6-3; A. Dun
can and Douglas Grant beat Clyde Beal
and Dr. Noble, 6-4. 6-3.
There will probably be a handicap
tournament for the Davis cups to-day.
The holders are Collier and Crowell.
Tebeau Confers With Hickey.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Dec. 28.â George
Tebeau, the owner of the Kansas City
American Association Club, was here to
day in conference with President Hickey.
He says he was only joking: when he

another star play, breaking through the
Berkeley line and running the length of
the field for a touchdown.. Score 10 to 5

captain. End runs by Mini won the gama
for Berkeley, as he scored two touch
downs. The try at goal failed. Score 15

Scholder was injured and had to leave

WORK CEASES ON" THE
PosrorncE building
3>elay in Shipments of Steel and Stone
Retard th.o Course of
Construction.
OAKLAND. Dec. 2S.â Because of delay
in shipments of steel structural material
from the East and the shutting down- for
winter of stone quarries in Utah work has
ceased on the new postofflce building at
Seventeenth street and Broadway. Con
tractor Barrett sees no possibility of se
curing stone until May. He explains that
the Quarries cannot be operated in win
ter, cold weather cracking the stone.
"I am under a penalty of $40 a day to
complete the building by December 8,
3902," said Contractor Barrett, "but I
can do absolutely nothing until steel and
stone have arrived. The steel girders
and columns should have been here by
September 20, but they have not yet left
the Eastern mills. If I had the material
seventy or eighty men would now be at
â work. The Government officials selected
the Utah stone, but they must have over
looked the fact that climatic conditions
there might retard shipment."

the dead. These, with the skeletons,
will be dug up In the Interest of science.

Protest in a : Mass-Meeting
Against an Obnoxious
Order.
ELMHURST. Dec. 28.â Elmhurst resi
dents held a mass meeting in Red Men's
Hall to-night to protest against the action
of the Oakland Transit Company, which
has given notice that after the first of
the new year no more commutation tick
ets will be Issued from any point on the
line to Oakland and that all fares will be
collected in cash. Under the proposed
schedule of rates Elmhurst people will be
required to pay $6 per month for traveling
to and from Oakland, where they havo
heretofore paid but $3 per month. San
Leandro passengers will have to pay .he
same and patrons of the road who go
back and forward daily from Haywards
and pay $6 for a commutation ticket will
after the change goes Into effect have to
pay $12 in cash for the same privilege and
service.
Frank Storer acted as temporary chair
man of to-night's meeting. About 150
citizens of Elmhurst with a number of
others who reside along . the Haywards
line were present. Storer remarked that
it was not necessary to give any detailed
reasons as to why the citizens of Elm
hurst had convened. It was the universal
sentiment, he said, that Elrahurst was
being harshly dealt with as regarded the
coming raise in car fares, and that some
thing should be done to offset or nullify
the handicap if possible.
R. D. Myers was chosen permanent
chairman. He said:
Every resident of Elmhurst. whether he be
a commuter or not. Is financially affected by
the last mandate of the Oakland Transit Com
pany. We came here and tfullt up this com
munity with the assurance that we would have
the privilege of going to and from, our busi
ness In Oakland or to points in Oakland, where
we could board the ferry trains, at an expense
not to exceed $3 per month. 'We have made this
town all It is. Since the Haywards road has
changed ownership and management we have
been gradually deprived of conveniences and
now a raise in rates is coming:. First the tick
et-book costing $1 was dispensed with; next
the carrying; of bicycles on the cars was pro
hibited, and then the electric heater was taken
out of the cars. If we do not take some means
to protect ourselves in this matter, many peo
ple who now own and others who rent homes
here will remove. I do not think we can gain
anything by supplicating: the officials of the
Oakland Transit Company. Those of us who
have already gone to them have received noth
ing but Insults. I believe it would be practi
cable to run a line of automobiles Into Oak
land for a flat fare of 6 cents, and also think
that we could secure a commutation rate from
Elmhurst to San Francisco on the Southern
Pacific for $4 50 per month.
J. M. Moore, who acted as secretary of
the mass meeting, said that the people
of Elmhurst should act quickly if any
thing was to be accomplished.
Charles D. Kelly said that two years
ago Passenger Agent Goodman of the
Southern Pacific informed a committee of
Elmhurst residents that the company
would establish a $3 50 commutation rate
to San Francisco if twelve regular com
muters could be secured. R. B. Matson
announced that E. B. Stone was willing
to operate a number of automobiles be
tween Elmhurst and the Southern Pacific
station, which Is about a quarter of a
mile from the center of town, if the
Transit Company put the high rates into
effect.
At the conclusion of the meeting Chair
man Myers appointed the following com
mltte to confer with the Transit Com
pany and request that the commutation
schedule- be not changed, and also to see
what arrangements could be made with
the Southern Pacific passenger depart
ment:
Andrew Jones, Dudley Kinsell, the Rev. E.
E. Clark, H, B. Myers. J. M. Moore, all of
Elmhurst: B. C. Hawes and W. J. McCoy, rep
resenting San Leandro: "W. G. Palmanteer and
H. C. Morris, bankers of Oakland, who have
heavy property interests in Klmhurst.
The committee will report at an ad

OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS
President Rogers of State Federation
Points Out Important "Work by
National Convention.
OAKLAND, .Dec. 28.â Charles j D.
Rogers, president of the State Federation
of Labor, has returned from Scranton,
Pa., where he was a delegate to the na
tional convention of* the American Fede
ration of Labor. Mr. Rogers brings the
news that In April the executive commit
tee of the national body will hold a meet
ing in" San Francisco for consideration of
labor conditions on the Pacific Coast.
The most important- work done by the
convention, Mr. Rogers, says, was the
adoption of resolutions calling for the
closer affiliation of labor organizations.
Individual unions are instructed to affili
ate with the local central organizations.
"This move has a most Important bear
ing upon the somewhat mixed conditions
existing in San Francisco," said Mr.
Rogers. "It was decided to uphold the
formation of Building Trades Councils,
provided that all of the unions affiliated
with such councils be members of their
international associations and likewise
affiliated with the local organization of
the American Federation of Labor."

KRIS KRINGLE MAKES ARRANGEMENTS
TO MEET CHILDREN OF ALAMEDA
He Will Hold Forth at Harmonie Hall and Be the Gentral
Attraction of the Little Peoples Festival, Which Is
an Annual Event Looked Forward to With Eagerness
ALAMEDA, Dec. 28.â Every child's
favorite, old Kris Krlngle, will
hold forth to-morrow afternoon
in Harmonie Hall from 2 to 6
o'clock, during which hours the
little people's festival, or kinderfest, of
the Harmonie Club will be in progress.
Elaborate preparations have been made
for the annual event, that is always re
garded by the young folks of the local
German colony as the merriest and most
important of each year.
Among the attractive features of the
entertaining programme to be given by
the juveniles to-morrow afternoon are a
minuet dance in costume by a number of
clever children, who have been trained
under the direction of Miss Rosine d'En
nery, and a fairy play, in which twenty
two young people will apear. â¢ The par

DISCUSS TRADE
AND UNIONISM
Noted Economists Re
view Existing Condi
tions in America.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â The American
Economic Association devoted its morn
ing session to-day to a discussion of trade
and this afternoon's session to economic
theories. Brooks Adams of Qulncy, Mass.,
in interpreting the recent expansion of
the foreign trade of the United States
entered a plea of justification for com
mercial and even military warfare to
maintain the commercial supremacy of a
country. He reviewed the economic con
ditions of the United States and sur
veyed the rise and fall of governments in
the past.
"Worthlngton C. Ford, chief of the De
partment of Statistics of the Boston Pub
lic Library, gave a succinct review of the
commercial policy of Europe, in which he
contende'J that free trade would be the
outcome of a threatened breakdown of
the "superstructure of the general tariff
condition" of Europe.
Charles A. Tuttle of Crawfordsville,
Ind., described the workingmen's position
In the light of economic progress and con
tended that trades unionism and collec
tive bargaining, profit sharing and indus
trial arbitration all signified that the
workman has a quasi property right in
the business In which he Is employed.
At the afternoon session a paper by
Thomas N. Carver of Harvard University
discussed "Some Theoretical Possibilities
of a Protective Tariff," and sought, to
show that a tariff duty is not necessarily
paid by the home consumer; also that a
protective tariff may be so framed as to
raise wages as well as to attract labor
and capital from the. less productive Into
the* more productive industriesâ Judged
from, the standpoint of the community
rather than from that of the individual
business man.
The third session was held this evening
and two papers, "The Negro in the
Yazoo-MIssisslppl Delta," by Alfred H.
Stone of Greenville, Miss., and "Concen
tration and Arbitration Among Miners,"
by Herman Justin, commissioner of the
Illinois Coal Operators' Association, were
listened to with much interest.
Justin described the methods pursued
with respect to the coal mining industry
of Illinois in the settlement of disputes
and the prevention of strikes by friendly
council, where self-control is the govern
ing factor.
New View of Parental Kinship.
A little miss of five, living In Washing
ton, conspired with her brother, age four,
to save enough pennies to buy papa and
mamma presents. A friend of the family
noticed that mamma's present was much
finer and more expensive than papa's,
and was impelled by curiosity to Inquire
why the bulk of the savings had been ex
pended for the. mother. The little miss
replied: "Well, you see, papa Is only re
lated to we children by marriage, while
mamma la our relative by bornation."

Attack Made on School
Study of Scientific
Temperance. >
SYRACUSE, N. Y., Dec. 28.â Professor
O.' W. Atwater of Wesley an "University.
Middletown, Conn., read a paper before
the State Science- Teachers' Association
here . to-day on "Alcohol Psychology in
the County Schools." He said in sub
stance: . -
A body of temperance reformers by extensive
organized effort has secured in almost every
State in the Union legislation requiring text
book Instruction In temperance psychology In
public schools. Unfortunately for science,
pedagog-y and morality, a considerable part of
this teaching Is not In accord with the views
of specialists or the result of the latest scien
tific Investigation.
Thus It comes about that In the United
States a (treat educational movement Is at
tempting to build â  up moral reform upon a
basis of doctrine which scientific authority dis
approves.
In explaining what in his judgment
constitutes rational teaching of the sub
ject Professor Atwater said he believed
the instruction should be only In the
higher and not In the lower grades of
schools, and that both the kind - and
amount of Instruction should be left to
the great' body of capable, conservative
and earnest educators to decide.
In the afternoon Just before adjourn
ment Mrs. Mary A. Hunt of Boston, na
tional superintendent of scientific temper
ance of the world's Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, and Mrs. Ella A.
Boole",*-- president of the State Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, disputed
statements made by Professor Atwater
relative to .alcohol in food. Mrs. Boole
said that It was a reflection on teacher^
that they^were opposing temperance leg
islation and teaching of text books. Tho
great' stumbling block in teachers''insti
tutes and normal schools, she said, was
due to the fact that there was not an In
telligent presentation of the effects of al
cohol.

SAYS SCRIPTURE
CAN BE STUDIED
Chancellor Andrews Not
of Belief That Inquiry
Shakes Faith.
, Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 28.
/ Professor E. Benjamin Andrews, chan
cellor of the Nebraska State University,
and President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California were guests
of honor last night at a well attended
banquet given under the auspices of the
Baptist Social Union of the First Baptist
Church. John G. Hoyt, president of the
union, who presided, drew the attention
of the guests to the fact that the two
college presidents are the sons of Bap
tist ministers and were reared in the
Baptist faith.
Professor Andrews addressed himself to
the subject of the Christian religion, de
claring his faith in its mission and assert
ing his belief that evolution is not an
tagonistic to its progress. He said in part:
Fear la expressed by coma people that the
belief in the Scriptures is in danger of being
shaken by study and investigation. I find In
contact with students from Christian homes
that they have the Idea that they must not
indulge in too much Investigation and thought
along theological lines. There teams to be a
fear that if they attempt to investigate tho
Scriptures they are almost certain to bring up
against disbelief. This is a falsa theory. I
don't. think there is any. danger to religion In
the investigation of Its grand principles.
The trouble Is that there are too many people
who regard science as something mechanical
There are many who believe Darwinism, in
particular, to be a terrible thing. And they
think that if the doctrine of. evolution Is taken
as true It destroys all theology. I have met
many students who think there Is & great con
â¢ tradlction between evolution and i religion, I
do not think that there is anything of tha
kind. It li quite true that if one maintains
Darwinism as a strictly materialistic theory
that out of nothing something comes, that life
finally makes Its appearance In matter, such
person has no need of a God. but he has con
siderable need of philosophy and common sense
Another bogie man that scares people Is the
so-called higher criticism. A few of us re
member the early criticism of the New Testa
ment. But this criticism has proved to 'be a
great blessing. "We now see things clearer
than before and have greater assurance In the
'divinity of Christ. We know that Christ spoke
with an assurance as never man spake before
Criticism has shown us more and more that
this is so. Instead of the Christian religion
being injured I believe that the net result of
criticism will be that the faith will be estab
lished more and more stronsrly.
President "Wheeler's address was a hu
morous dissertation on the life of him
self as a Baptist preacher's son and his
association with Professor Andrews, also
the son of a Baptist preacher, at Cornell
and Heidelberg universities. He said he
took no stock in the libel that all minis
ters', sons are scapegoats.

BELIEVES DAVIS
SAW FUGITIVES
Sheriff Satisfied That
Conductor's Story
Is Correct.
Prisoners Escape Six Hours
Sooner Than Officers
First Thought.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec 23.
Sheriff Rogers and his Jailers are sat
isfied that Frank Case and William Kelly
escaped from tho County Jail between the
hours of 9 and U o'clock on Christmas
â¢ On the strength of Conductor "William
Davis* statement to The Call that he saw
them on tha 11:45 narrow gauge train to
the city that night Sheriff Rogers Inters
viowed Davis to-day and ascertained that
tho story is true in every respect. The
Sheriff is convinced now that the men
escaped some six or seven hours sooner
than was at first thought and under
cover of darkness instead of in broad
daylight.
"There Is no doubt that Davis saw
the men," said Jailer George Taylor to
day. "He knows Case well and could not
have been mistaken as to his identity.
We wish he had told us about them
sooner, but, of course, he Is not to blame,
because he honestly thought they had
got out of their troubles with the police.
"He described their appearance Just as
he did to The Call. They were dirty and
dusty from climbing about in their effort
to get free.
"I think they got out between 9 and 11
o'clock Christmas night. We lock the
prisoners up at 6 o'clock at night, but
these two men were not locked in their
cells Christmas night, because they hid
in the bathroom. Their cellmates de
ceived us as to their presence and their
absence was not noted. They must have
crawled through the place where the bars
were sawed off and stayed there until
after., 9 o'clock, when they got away by
means of the rope ladder.
"We think the men are in San Francisco
and that they will be caught very scon.
Neither had more than twenty-flve cents
and I don't think they would have
skipped."
Sheriff Rogers has shut down on vislt3
to all prisoners. He will not permit the
promiscuous calling that has been going
on for a long time. Some of these visi
tors, he says, are responsible for the
presence of saws in the Jail.

DISASTER COMES
TO SANTA CLAUS
Carl Whitmore Typifies
Him and Receives
Injuries.
Whiskers Catch Afire and
His Face Is Severely
Burned.
Oakland Office San .Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Dec. 28.
Santa ClauÂ», personified by Carl Whit
more, son of Attorney Welles Whitmoro
and a student at the Oakland High
School, was severely burned last night
while amusing a gathering of children at
the family residence, 1215 Jefferson street.
His face and hands were scorched so bad
ly that it i3 feared he will be marked far
life.
Regaled in flowing red robes touched
with snowy cotton, and with a beard that
came down to his knees, Santa Claus was
distributing gifts to the little ones from
the tree in one of the drawing-rooms.
Suddenly an accident caused the merry
makers to utter exclamations of terror.
While Santa Claus was reaching within
the tree his whiskers swept over a light
ed candle and in a moment were convert
ed into a sheet of flame. The fire burst
upward into the face of the young man.
and to escape them he threw himself
prostrate upon the floor. There he rolled
over and over in the frantic effort to blot
out the burning cloth and cotton.
Finding that the fire could not be
crushed out and mad with pain, he then
arose and rushed into another room,
spreading the flames as he hurried along.
He was followed thither by his father,
who caught up a rug as he went and
wrapped it around his suffering son. Soon
the flames were completely smothered.
Miss Helen Lethem while playing about
a Christmas tree at the residence of Dr.
Colestock, at Fleasanton, was severely
burned on the hands last night. Her
dress caught flre from a candle and be
fore the flames could be stamped out she
had received a number of wounds.

Many do not understand how it is pos-
dble for us to sell these fine new pianos at
Buch a tremendous reduction in price, but
it is simply this: Before January 1 we
must turn this entlrÂ© -wholesale stock of
pianos into cash or interest bearing notes.
' The question of profit, or even cost, does
not enter into the proposition at alL And
â whe 1 you realize that It costs an ordi-
nary dealer an enormous amount of
money to sell a piano at retail, not to
say anything of the freights and actual
factory cost of the instrument, you will
understand the difference that exists be-
tween the actual wholesale factory cost
und the retail selling price.
Here are the largest size walnut or oak
rased Schirmer upright pianos for $117.
They are considered worth 1250 every-
where. These pianos have three pedals,
revolving lockboard, continuous hinges
and full length music desk; three strings :
throughout.
Then look at these brand new Emerson
and Graxner pianos, for which many of
your friends have paid $3oO, and even $400.
Here during this sale you can get almost
two of these pianos for this moneyâ on <
easy monthly payments, too, if you de-
sire.

never been told even in tho East for less
than 5275, can now be secured for $137, and

to pay all cash down either. Easy month-
ly payments buy them.
Here are some of the finest brand new
Estey upright pianos, that regularly re-
tail for $425 and upward. Taka choice for
5218 and $247, respectively.

makes as these new Kimball. Steinway,
Estey, Emerson. Milton, Gramer, Whit-
ney and other line pianos bold within a
hundred and fifty dollars of the prices at
which we are now offering them to retail
buyers. This seems elmply preposterous,
but it is nevertheless true.

money is an object.

JUDGE SLOSS REFUSES
TO APPOINT BECEIVEB
Efforts of Mrs. Jenner to Get Prop
erty of B. S. J. F. <yueil Mur
phy Receive Setback.
Judge Slossi yesterday denied the appli
cation of Nora IT. G. Jenner, former wife
of Bertram S. J. P. O'Neil Murphy, for
the appointment of a receiver to take
charge of the property of her first spouse.
Judge Slosa also refused to grant an In
junction restraining Daniel T. Murphy,
a brother of the defendant, who la sup
posed to be in possession of Bertram
Murphy's vast estate, from disposing of
the property. Judge SIoss also overruled
a demurrer to the complaint filed by the
defendants. The case will now come up
for trial In the near future.
Mrs. Jenner secured a divorce from
Murphy some years ago in London. She
was awarded alimony, but it was never
paid by Murphy. She brought suit for
the amount due her and got judgment in
the English courts. The judgment was
sent to the courts in this city, where
Murphy is supposed to have large pos
sessions, and another suit was !iled.
The proceedings of yesterday are a few
of the many moves made by Mrs. Jetmer
to secure alimony long due her from her
former husband.

to the study of thÂ© several duties. Dur
ing the evening Past Matron Mrs. Lizzie

well, and that It had recently played at
thÂ© cornerstone ceremonies of the court
house In Martinez and at a concert at
Stockton, and was greatly praised. The
boys have become proficient under the
leadership of George W. Bennett, and as
the boys were furnished the funds to re
cure Instruments by California Chapter
it was thought that the chapter should
now furnish a fund to keep the band in
music, books and other things that are
requisite to a first-class band. After
hearing the statement it was decided to
give a grand concert and dance in Golden
Gate Hall on the night of the 8th of next

band will appear and give several num
bers. The committees necessary to carry

dancing, after which a dainty collation
was served. At the parting there were

F-1-d-e-l-i-t-y Lodge on the night of the
23d inst. had the last Initiatory work un
der the officers whose term expires with
the year. The Interest in the event was
manifested by the largest attendance of
members that has been known for somÂ«Â»
time. There were also/ present a large
number of visitors. Two strangers were
admitted by initiation and two by card.
During the term of the present noble
grand, C. P. Phillips, the membership was
increased by twenty-two, bringing the
roll up to 332. A great deal of this In
crease was the result of the untiring ef
forts of the noble grand, who during the
six months he has been In office spared
neither time, money nor energy to ad
vance the interests of the lodge. Next
month he will take his place with a num
ber of the young past grands who dur
ing the past few years have worked hard
to build up this ever prosperous and pop
ular lodge. After the initiation there was
served an excellent collation under the
supervision of N. M. Peterson, A. T.
Downes and Henry Osthoff. ~Two pleas
ant hours were spent around the table,
at the head of which Noble Grand Phil
lips acted as toastmaster. Before calling
on any one to speak, he told of the many
happy hours he had spent during his
term in the service of the lodge. Then
followed a number of responses to toasts,
recitations, vocal selections and stories,
and the meeting was voted a most pleas-
Jng one.
Yerba Buena Lodge closed the term of
the present officers with the initiation of
four candidates.
Unity Lodge will have work in the ini
tiatory degree on the evening of next
Tuesday, when the event will be followed
by a social hour.

jor C. E, Benedict, clerk; General E. H.
Black, Robert C. Black and Robert W.
Jones, trustees. It is expected that
there will be a large attendance on that
night. The continuing of Captain Korn
beck in the position * of commander of
the corps is a compliment to an officer
â who is one of the best drlllmasters , In
the Patriarchs, and it is a recognition of
his earnest endeavors to advance the can
ton and bring it to a degree of efficiency
of which every member of that branch of
the Order of Odd Fellows may well feel
proud. : â¢

Miss Hazel E. Donoho, daughter of Mrs.
Donoho, secretary of the California as
sembly, graduated at the Denman school
last week, and on that occasion presented
to the classroom a beautiful portrait of
the late President McKinley. Her pre
sentation speech was a gem of oratory
that was most favorably commented upon
by the many who were present and lis
tened to the exercises. The young lady
has inherited much of the talent of her
gifted mother.
The various lodges of the city are get
ting ready for installation of officers.
California Lodge is the banner lodge

more than thirty members.

Native Daughters.
The Christmas tree, party of Darina
Parlor, given in the social hall of the Red
Men's building on the night of the 23d
inst., was a pleasant affair that was in
keeping with the functions that have been
given in'the past by this subordinate of
the Native Daughters of the Golden West.
There was a present from the tree for
each one who attended, and the Darina
girls amused themselves by hurling cas
carones at any one who was within reach.
The dance programme kept those in at
tendance together until midnight. The
affair was conducted by Lucle jBammer
smlth, Edith Brown, Daisle Nepp and
Miss Unger.
The fourteenth anniversary celebration
of the institution of Califla Parlor No. 23
of Sacramento, recently held, was a de
cided success in every way. There was
In the early part of the evening the pre
sentation of a farce entitled "An Obsti
nate Family" by a number of the mem
bers, who acquitted themselves in a cred
itable manner for non-professionals. This
was followed by a banquet, at which there-
Were as special guests Miss Mary Bur
gess, president of La Bandera Parlor, and
Miss Kate Crowell, president of Sutter
Parlor. The hall was prettily decorated
with smilax, Christmas berries and lan
terns. The tables were decorated with
smilax, choice flowers, berries and can
dles. The following was the menu, quite
poetical:
"A good digestion to you all; and once more
I shower a welcome on ye!"

Notwithstanding, their freshness."

â Henry IV.

"We are yours In the xarden."
â Winter's Tale.
While the good things of the menu were
being discussed and enjoyed Mrs. Maggie
Schroth, president of Califia Parlor, who
presided as toast mistress, called for re
sponses to toasts as follows: "Pioneers,"
Miss Bella Johnston; "Native Sons," Miss
M. B. Johnson; "Twentieth Century,"
Mrs. Frankle Greer: "Our Beloved Or
der," Past Grand President Mrs. Ema
Gett; "The Flag," Miss M. Burgess, and
"Sutter Parlor," Miss Kate Crowell.
The first official visit to local parlors
by Grand President Mrs. Genevieve W.
Baker was the one made last night to
Alta Parlor in the Native Sons' building.
There was a large attendance and the
grand officer was received with* all the
honors due to her station and in that
fraternal spirit which has always been
manifested by the members of this well
known parlor. After the ceremonial busi r
ness was over there was a banquet, cov
ers being set for 125. Mrs. Baker was
presented a handsome .basket of flowers
by the parlor and a silver cold meat fork
and sardine fork by her personal friends
in the organization.
Ancient Order of Workmen.
At the last held meeting of Bernal
Lodge of the Ancient Order of Workmen
a class of eight strangers were Introduced
by Special Organizer B. D. Goodrich and
were initiated in the amplified form, the
screen work being introduced on that oc
casion.
Prosperity Lodge has appointed a com
mittee to arrange for a public installation
of its new officers.
A correspondent asks: "A committee on
investigation is appointed with instruc
tiens to report at the next meeting on the
character of two applicants for admission
to membership. At the next meeting two
members of the committee absent them
selves, but the third one is present and
reports favorably. Three brothers in the
lodgeroom declare that they have known
the applicants for upward of five "ears.
Would not the master workman have
been justified in appointing two of these
brothers on the investigation committee
in. place of the absent ones Instead of
turning the candidates away?" Brothers
who accept a position â  on a committee
should perform the duty assigned them
and if unable to come to the lodge, as In
the case cited, to make a report on the
applications, should have sent in a report
in writing and excuse for non-attendance
Having neglected to either come to the
ledge or send in a written report the mas
ter workman should have taken it for
granted that- they had neglected a duty
and he would have been Justified in ap
pointing two of the three brothers who
had known the applicants for more than
five years in the place of the delinauents

AMONG MINERS
New Operators ConSe
Into Field to Search
for Ores.
Extension of Dredging for
Gold in River Beds
Is Planned.
Several deals have been made for min
ing properties that promise well. The out
look is good tor the establishment of sev
eral new dredging plants to mine for gold.
The Calaveras and American rivers will
be the scene of dredging. Groups of
mining claims in several localities have
recently been placed under bond. In all
of the mining counties of this State the
operations are practically at full capacity.
The facilities for traveling on the Colo
rado River are to be Improved to accom
modate the miners who have properties
near the river. Operations on a gigantic
scale are promised in Shasta County.
The Scott Valley Advance says that the
Quigley ranch at Oro Flno has been bond
ed to a company for dredging purposes
and that the Ball mine and mill- are run
ning at full blast
The Upton mine in Am&dor County,
seven miles from Plymouth, has been
purchased by Eastern parties. A ten-
Btamp mill is to be removed from Quartz
Mountain and put up on the property.\
The Redding Searchlight says that the
Mountain View. Copper King, McKinley.
Puerto Rico, Cuba." and Dewey copper j
claims, on the west Blope of Town Creek
Mountain, are about to be bonded. Win- ;
ter work has been begun on the McKinley
group of claims. These are west from
Bully Hill. Twelve 'men are working on
the Boston & Montana Mining Cfcmpnay's
Northern Light mine.
The mines of Randsburg. Â»so say* the
Randsburg Miner, are looKing well and
the outlook is better than at any time in
the past five years. The Yellow Aster
mills are running to their full capacity
and are putting through about 45o tons
per day, with a prospect of an increase to
600 tons daily. There are still rumors cur
rent of the sale of the Yellow Aster prop
erty but, according to the Miner, no one
has yet had an option on the mines.
Predging Â«i& Calaveras.
Concerning the dredging for gold in
Calaveras County the Calavera* Pros
pect says:
The parties who havt â¢soured the bond on
the bed of the Calavera* Rlvar at Jenny Und
and the lands adjoining are about to begin
operations.' The party represented by Mr.
CarnduS have their apparatus for" prospecting
on the ground and were expected to begin work
this week. The ground is to b* thoroughly
prospected by numerous borings before any
other work is done. These borings are ex
pected to devalop the value of the ground, and
if satisfactory will be followed by the exten
sive dredging operations, ilr. DoolltUa. who
has the bond on the Cutler ranch is also ex
pecting to begin the work ot prospeaUng in
u short time. ThÂ» methods hera will tÂ» sim
ilar, to those In the river channel. The ground
is to be iirtt fully tested by tha boring pro
cess, which will be followed "by more extensive
work. The dredging process is expensive to
begin with, requiring the outlay of a large
sum, and no chances ar* taken of working on
barren ground.
The Placer Republican-Argus says that
two companies expÂ«ct to buildvdredgers
to search for gold on the American River
during the coming season. In the North
Fork of the river the tailings form a
solid mass up to thirty feet In depth and
four hundred feet in width from the
crossing of the Coif ax and Forest Hill
road down to Auburn. Above this point
to the mouth of Canyon Creek there are
heavy deposits of tailings In places.
A strike is reported in the Larkln mine â 
in Â£1 Dorado County at the 400-foot level.
A new line of Bteamers is about to run
on the Colorado River to get the business
of the mines in California and Arizona.
It is under the direction of Captain A. B.
Smith.
The Union-Democrat reports that a
company composed of Boston parties has
been organized under the name of the
Horseshoe Bend Gold Mining Company
to work a group of eighteen claims be
tween Parrotts and Robinsons ferries on
the Stanislaus River. Operations have
been resumed at the Dondero gravel
claim at Yankee Hill.
The Noonday copper mine in El Dorado
County, on Mathenas Creek, has been
bonded by Dr. Wrenn and Dr. Proctor to
the Payton Chemical Company of Mar
tinez, which will develop the property.
The bond calls for sinking 200 feet at
once.
The Mother Lode Banner says:
The Bonanza mlna Is closed down. Tha com
pressor and pumps have been removed and tha
mine will fill with water. Tha certificates for
S2.500 shares of the stock, held by the Citizens'
Bank, can now be given to tha children to
ornament a playhouse, as that is the only way
to utilize them. Superintendent M. D. Kelly
feels much disappointment over the outcome,
as he put in several months' work and con
siderable money, all In vain.
"Will Complete Purchase.
According to Mineral Wealth, develop
ment work at the Balaklala mine is such
that ' the bond for $650,000 on the property
will probably lead to actual purchase.
Nine diamond drill holes have teen put
down and great Quantities of ore are re
ported to have been located thereby. Sev
enty-five men are working on the prop
erty under the direction of W. W. Adams. '
According to the Redding Searchlight,
the sum of $25,000 has been taken from the
Dorleska mine by H. Z. Osborne and his
associates. The mine was bought by the
present owners *;- $5000. The mine is in
Trinity County.
The Yreka Journal says:
A man named Winters from Idaho started
up the steam dredger at Hawkinsvilla last
week for the purpose of ascertaining the nec
essary Improvements required to the machinery
and apparatus for better service In working
the Yreka Creek bed at Hawkinsville.Â« Con
siderable top gravel has to be moved befora
reaching the rich bedrock where the gold is
found, especially in the crevices and seams,
often requiring hand work In picking or dig
ging out.
The Punch Creek quarts mine oa tha south
fork of Humbug shows excellent prospects late
ly, a new strike of rich quartz having Just been
discovered. The Goltfsn Star Mining Company
directors have levied another assessment. No
9, ol 2-5o per share, to pay assessment work
now being performed at tha mlna on Humbug
Creek.
The mill of tha Red Bird quarts mine on
Yreka Flats Is kept running steadily and will
soon be going day and night when the new
machinery Is worn a little to run smoother
The cold weather lately has been causing
much trouble In keeping quarts mills running
especially in the high altitudes, where the
temperature Is coldest by reason of water
freezing in tha batteries, which prevents tho
flow ot water needed in small quantity fos such
purpose.
Operations Are Extensive.
Mineral "Wealth says of future opera
tions in Shasta County:
Operations on a glgantlo seals will mark the
mining; Industry of the future In 8hasta County
The small enterprises producing- a few thou
sand a month or a year will be compleflv
overshadowed by the colossal operations now
planned. In a formative staga or already In the
field.
Only a few years ago tho mineral output of
the chief producing counties of the State did
not equal the present output of either of the
two large mines now operating In Shasta
County. an3 with the exceptioh of Shasta" a
yield there is not another county in California
that reaches 50 per cent of the output of one
of her large mines.
The Mountain Copper Company Is producing
at the rate of $4,500,000 a year and tha Bully
Hill Copper Mlnin/er and Smelting Company of
which Captain J. R. de la Mar is the movtne
spirit, la producing at the rate of $2,750 000

OIL PRODUCERS
ARE EXPECTANT
Stockholders Have the
Power tcr Bring
About Climax.
Situation Produces General
Interest Throughout
. the State.
The general situation concerning oil
production In California has not recently
met -with any marked change. The only
condition in eight that promises any re-^
lief from low prices and disorganization
is the existence of the Associated oil
Company. Some producers are saying
that the Standard Oil Company will help
them to get a higher price. On the other
hand It Is uiged that as the market lor
petroleum la based upon competition
*vlth coal, the only purpose that the
Standard Oil Company can have Is to
make as large a market as possible by
crowding out coal to the fullest extent.
whlc*h can be done at a low figure rather
than at a higher one.
The nelda show less development work
going on. The talk of coming dollar oil
is heard. The owners of lands are wait
ing to see what will be done. Assur
ances are received from the Associated
Oil Company that the outlook has not
been cloudea and that future events are
likely to be satisfactory. "
The leading consideration for the futura
of the oil industry would seem to be that
the demand should increase. Those who
have undertaken to burn oil Instead of
coal have ao reason to be dissatisfied
with oil as iuel. .Large contracts have
recently been renewed. In the Kaat, aa
in California, the tests of petrolium as
fuel have been satisfactory. The- Na
tional Oil Reporter, published in New
York, In a recent issue had two state
ments of significance. One was that the
New York Chamber of Commerce has
adopted a resolution favorable to the
Bruumont fuel oil. The other is the fol
lowing:
Save Fifty 'Per Cent
Since the discovery of oil there have been a
thousand and one estimates made on the reia
tlve cost of coal and oil tor fuel. Some of these
were made by experts, who ngured heat units
on the scientific basis, others by oil men, and
the coal baron also had an estimate on the sub
ject. Taking oil at tha value aaked for it. the
results in favor of that fuel were almost stag
gering and astounding to the people who had
never given the subject a thought. Actual ex
perience Is beginning to come in now, and tha
ilrat one to be placed on record in detail prom
ises to give fuel oil a boom that It has never
experienced before. Charles Clark St Co., dredg
ing contractors, began figuring on oil for luel
soon after Mcl-'addin No. 1 came in. but it re
quired some lime to build barge9 for transport
ins it from the field to the boats and holding
the reserve. On account of the time lost In
making these arrangements they have juat
learned what their saving is in dollars and cents.
The following results were obtained from coal
and oil: Coal per month, $35; oil, $12 50;
transportation. $4 t>0; Â«torage barge. $oo; differ
ence in cost of coal and oil. %-Hi; saving in fire
men, etc., $700; saving in favor of oil. $3uoO.
In the above figures it must be borne in mind
that the expenditure of $3S00 for an oil supply
barge will not occur next month, which will
make the saving proportionately more. ThÂ»
barge Is used to hold a reserve supply for the
dredging boats, and will last for many years,
but it is ngured in the first month's expenses,
which still levaes a saving of $5000 on a fuel
bill of lesa than $10,000. /
' Controls the Cream.
Concerning the hopes of the Associated
Oil Company the Los Angreles Herald
Quotes a Kern River district producer as
laying:
If the holdings of the Associated Oil Com
pany are inclosed on the map of the Kern
River field by a red Una it can be seen that
the very cream of the producing territory has
been gathered In by the combine, save one
tract in the northeast, and another In ths
southwest. Now, what can tha outside pro
ducers do to the combine which. I claim, con
trols the situation? I am perfectly certain
that oil cannot be produced on either of these
two tracts for less than 33 cents to 40 cents a
barrel and make a profit. There la no 15 cent
oil anywhere about there, and. consequently, 1
maintain that the combine directly controls
the very best portion of the field, and in an in
direct way also controls the outlying territory.
Inasmuch as none of the producers there can
sell at a very low figure without making a
heavy loss. In such case th*- Associated Oil
Company ought to be able to mako contract*
on a basis remunerative to all concerned.
The voting by stockholders of the pro
ducing companies will continue next
month. The stockholders have had all
the arguments presented to them by
this time. The situation, involving the
future of a vast industry and many mil
lions of dollars, Is one of great interest.
From one end of the State to the other
all eyes are now on the Associated OU
Company.

Mines Save Great Depth.
The Daily Mining Record, discussing the.
depth of mines in the Cripple Creek dis
trict, says that at the start it was sup
posed by those who were classed as ex
perts that the surface finds would prove
to be but pockets. Now the wiseacres
say discoveries at a depth of 1000 feet
seem to Indicate that there are richer de
posits farther down. The shafts, from
the figures given by the record, would
seem to be down from. 1000 to 1500 feet. A
slash, of freight rates has helped the dis
trict. The tonnage indicated by the
smelter records and of chemical plants
show an increase in production. The Rec
ord estimates the Cripple Creek output of
December, basing its opinion upon the
statements of ore buyers, at $2,500,000.
Concerning the reports of Increased ac
tivity amongr.the copper producers abroad
the Mining Journal of London says:
At the beginning of the nineteenth century
Russia supplied most of Northmen Europe with
copper. Her sixty smelting work3 then Issued
2C0.000 poods (thr pood la thirty-six pounds)
per annum. Tha copper discoveries elsewhere
led to many of the Russian works being shut
down. However, the high price of copper of
late years has stimulated production again
and in the last decade the yield of pure coo"
per, beginning at 174,000 poods in ISfll fpii
to 145,000 in 1S>4. rose to 190.000 in IS'V:
dropped again to 153.000 in 1898, then raDidlv
progressed to 236.0CO In 1900. It would.Â«YDear
that as regards copper. Russia Is practically
virgin, only tlje upper veins having: hefn
worked rod the Ural range 1. wtd to be Ve r y

Mail advices from New York say:
"Raisins are firmer on the coast, and, ac
cording to telegrams received by the local rep
resentatives, of the members of the seeding
combine, prices on seeded will be advanced %c
to >Â«c within a few days. Some packers have
already withdrawn quotations. It is understood,
and others wire that confirmations at the old
price "will be limited.' A number of cars of
laney seeded were reported sold to the local
trade during the week and nime business waa
uone in choice. The latter grade are now very
difficult to get. The situation on the coast, it
is reported, has been further strengthened by
two prominent outside packers entering into an
agreement with the Pacific Coast Seeded Com-
I-any to maintain prices. On spot prioes are
unchanged.
"Currants to arrive per Mirarnar, due this
week, were vory active the latter part of the
week, purchases by both out-of-town and local
dealers and cleaners amounting to between
1000 and 2000 barrels. On Saturday the mar
ket for Amalias on this vessel was very firm
at 5%c, with practically ail except one
large holder being withdrawn from the
market. One prominent importer turned down
an offer of 5%c for 100 barrels. The Miramar's
total cargo is about 19,000 barrels. Oregon
prunes are firmer on the coast, holders asking
'.rom 2-4c to a '2%c basis. It is rumored that
the Cured Fruit Association will shortly ad
vance the price on old prunes. Apricots are
li rm. A number of cars of fancy are reported
to have been purchased from the coast during
the week.
"'Evaporated apples were firmer during the
week end sales of prime State stock were made
at 9%c. The slight advance was due to the
necessity of filling December contracts for
shipment abroad, and this demand having been
satisfied prices at the close were easier, prime
State goods being offered at 9c on Saturday.
Raspberries are firm and wanted. Huckleber
ries are In urgent request at ISc, with practi
cally none offering. Cherries are weak."

EASTERN MARKETS.
Xew York Stock Market.
>:EW TORK, Dec. 2S.â To-day's broad and
active ttock market resulted in Email changes
in prices of stocks, owing to the very large
amount of prcflt-taking sales which were mad...
The market wss an excellent one for realizing
profits, wiiich are of tempting proportions, a.s
a result of the considerable rise in prices tha
last few days. There was a vigorous and
wÂ«-;!I-<2:EtrSbuted demand, which absorbed the
offerings without sprious inroads upon prices.
The continued recovery in Sugar, in which the
dealings ware again lars?e. sustained the mar
ket: The unrxi<ccteilly strong bank statement
made the closing Ktrong after the realizing
baud ocmnwMiced to make some impression upon
pri<*Â«. Amaljamaied Copper failed to holu
its pain and closed only '/Â» higher, after hav
ing been at enc that 1% higher. Sugar saved
a net gain of 2V* from an extreme advance of
"Vs. In the railroad l!st Heading was the
feaiure on a continuance of the recent buy
ing attributed to banking interests. The stock
closed H6 higber. Baltimore and Ohio and
Missouri 'Pacific were notably strong. Generally
the realizing in railroad stocks kept the galm
within moderate limits. The compilation of
returns of uarnlnffs for thirty-seven railroads
tor tlio third week in December t-hows a de
crease of iSAIi per cent compared! with last year.
This Is lh" first time- a decrease has been
Khown for the corrwponding period since 1830.
Other roads reporting to-day showed a similar
tendency, including the soft coal carriers.

a number of prominent Ftocks, with sympa
thetic effect on the list. The operations by the
bears were overdone, according to the indica
tions of the latter part of the week, and their
efforts to retrieve their position by covering
ehort contracts caused recoveries to about last
week's closing prices. These developments
gave some animation to the market, in splto
of the tendency to dullness characteristic of the
holiday period. Activity has been largely con
gested in a few speculative favorites and there
has been no evidence of what is called out
side interest in the market, beyond eome in
vestment buying of high grade bonds and
stocks, presumably in anticipation of the Janu
ary disbursements of profits. These disburse
ments will reach unprecedented proportions this
year and will include many new dividend pay
ers, besides the important increase in dlstri
1 bution by old dividend payers. Preparation for
these disbursements makes large temporary de
mands upon the market, and the activity of
the- money market has kept apprehension alive
with flurries caused by calling of leans which
throws stocks held on margin upon the market
and thus militates against operations for an
advance. Sugar has assumed the dominant
position in the market lately held by Amalga
mated Copper, and Its violent decline affected
the whole market, while it lasted. Its equally
violent recovery was an effective factor In
rallying the market. This stock was sold with
reckless freedom by the bears, on the assump
tion that conditions in the trade were analogous
to those recently prevailing in the copper trade,
giving ground for expecting a similar prolonged
I decline in the stock. Their campaign resulted
in a rout. The question of railroad earnings
presents contradictions which have led to sus
picions that conditions have been under manip
ulation for the purpose of influencing public
opinion on the subject of combinations and
community cf ownership. Reports seem agreed
that there is such a preesure of traffic of vari
ous kinds offering to railroads that their car
supply is totally inadequate to accommodate
it. Branches of the Iron trade are reported
in a condition of real distress from inability
to secure delivery cf material or product, and
grain dealers are said to be forced to hold
grain, because there are no cars to carry it.
Cutting of freight rates under these circum
stances forms an anomaly that has given rise
to the suspicion that railroad interests arc
seeking to demonstrate to the public the con
tinued independence of operation of railroad*.,
notwithstanding the community of interest.
Railroad officials assert that the expiration of
annual traffic contracts and the formation of
I new ones explains the present disorganization
1 of freight rates. Signs of solicitude on the
j part of those concerned in the Great Northern
I community of interests have caused some dis
quiet among speculative operators, as the fu
j ture of the stock market is felt to be Intimately
j bound up with that of the mass of securities
concerned . in that transaction. The formal
pronouncement by the president of the Great
Northern, given to the public at the beginning
of the week, was much discussed. It gave rise
[ to some fear that antagonisms remained, in
! spite of the so-called Northern Pacific settle-
I ment, which might leave room for future con-
I test and entanglement. Those who accepted
I the statement as a plea for non-intervention
by State authorities against the Northern Se
curities Company saw in it one of the uigns
of solicitude which might argue a less confi
dent frame of mind among the projectors than
Is publicly professed. Another development
which caused disquietude was the report of de
creased earnings for the third week in Decem
ber as compared with the previous year of the
most representative railroad systems in the
West and Southwest. Explanations are offered
that severe cold weather caused a check to
railroad traffic that is only temporary; that the
cutting of freight rates which probably had to
do with the decreased earnings is also on tem
porary; that comparisons are made with an
extraordinary level of earnings last year, es
pecially in the Southwestern regions. The re
ported decreases had no effect on the prices of
stocks, those which showed marked declines
in earnings leading the strong advance in the
stock market the latter part og the week. The
undertone of speculation has remained con
fident and the belief prevailed that the pass
ing of the year-end money requirements would
be followed by a January rise in prices such
as is not unusual in the stock market. The
clearing conditions in the copper trade, the
extraordinary activity in the iron and steel
industries, the unprecedented holiday trade,
the prosperous conditions of general business
and evidences of relief from the prolonged
crisis? in Germany are all looked to to benefit
the future stock market.
There has been a good absorption of bonds
during the week.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW TORK, Dec. 28. â The statement of
the associated banks for the week ending to
day shows:
Loans, $857,960,200; increase, $954,800.
1 Deposits, Â«910.86Â»,800; increase, $6,773,500.
Circulation, $31,856,100; decrease, $73,200.
Legal tenders, $71,000,600; increase, $1,230,
000.
Specie. $103,618,200; Increase, ?2,560,400.
Reserves, $233,608,800; increase, $3,799,400.
Reserve required, $227,717,450; increase,
gi.693,375.
Surplus, $7,891,350; increase, $2,106,025.
The Financier Bays: The traceable move
ments cf money this week, bo far as they af
fected bank conditions, showed an estimated
less to the banks of only $!Â»Â£,200 cash. Among
the striking features of the movement was the
j steady flow of currency to New Orleans
I through the Treasury, $900,000 having: thus
â¢been transferred during the bank week; the
loss to the banks of $2,030,800 through the
fiscal operations of the Government, and : the
tain to the banks on the interior movement
of money, which amounted, deducting tranB
fers, to $1,735,800. The receipts ot currency
from the West were fairly â  large,' reflecting
shipments by banks In that section to take
advantage of the high money rates at this
center and also the beginning of the return
flow of currency which had been sent to . the
West in response to the early demand arising
from the harvesting of grain. Some Western :
funds doubtless also came hither to meet-In
terest and dividend requirements. The gain
in specie, as indicated by the bank returns,
was $2,569,400, and in legal tenders $1,230,000,
making the total increase in cash $3,799,400.
Loans were augmented by $954,800. The de
posits showed a gain of $8,773,500, which
amount was greater by $2,010,300 than the
total increase of cash and of loans; hence the
statement in this respect was out of harmony.
I Surplus reserve indicated a gain of $2,106,025
and this item now stands at 97,891,850, against
Ml, 525,900 at the corresponding period a year
ago. It Is probable that the statement was
made on rising averages of the cash, for
though transfers to New Orleans through . the
Treasury were large at the end of the bank
week, these were more than offset by receipts
of funds from the interior with which to
meet drafts for January disbursements. It
Is expected that by Monday of this week pay
ments will be made by the Assistant Treasury
at New York of about $3,000,000 for a block
cf $2,500,000 unmatured 4s of 1907, which
were bought for delivery before the end of
the year. There is still due about $1,500,000
on account of the January Interest on Govern
ment bonds, which will be paid during the
current week. Beginning with the new year
1 banks retiring their circulation will forward
through the New York Sub-Treasury nearly
$3,000,000 of lawful money with which to
replace bonds securing such circulation. Those
bonds will then be withdrawn and most likely
they will be sold on the market.
So far as monetary conditions at this center
are concerned, there may be continued tension
until the payments by banks and trust Com
panies for January Interest and dividend* be
come large. Then the distribution of this
money should bring about easier rates, at
least for loans at call on the Stock Exchange.
London Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was quiet on the Stock Exchange !
to-day, but' the tone was still unsatisfactory.
American stocks showed a better tendency,
but this merely reflected New York advices, as
English buying is practically nil. Prices ruled
slightly above parity, but Baltimore and Ohio,
Atchison and Union Pacific were the best fea
tures. Copper was slightly better. . Money
rates were unchanged.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Dec. 28. â May wheat opened I
%@%c higher at 82%@82%c and quickly sold
to S2Vic under the unexpected help of Liver
pool cables, which showed an advance in the
face of the weakness on this side yesterday.
For a time prices held steady on a fair amount
of local buying. Reports showing that stocks
were accumulating at primary points gave rise
to the natural expectation of a big visible" re
port Monday, this serving to weaken bull con
fidence somewhat. The feelings of holders
were further molested by the decline in Liver
pool spot markets, which made the advance in
futures at the market look like manipulation
from this side. The support which has been
forthcoming for May by local operators failed
to appear and as there were numerous stop
loss orders at that figure the . market broke
sharply to 81%@Sl%c and closed weak, %c
under yesterday, at Sl%c.
The corn market ruled firm early, but broke
later with wheat. May closed weak, %c down,
at ii6U@UGVic.
Oats was purely a scalping market. May
closed U c. lower at 45c.
The trade In provisions was light and fluc
tuations narrow. The tone was steady, al
though profit taking resulted in a slight de
cline. May pork and lard each closed 5c down
and ribs 2%c depressed.

ESTIMATES OF COST OF WATER SUPPLY
ARE INCREASED BY BOARD OF WORKS
Comparison of Reports Made for Private Corporations
With Those Made by City Engineer Grunsky for Use in
Proposed Bond Election Show His Figures Are Higher
AN Interesting progressive report Is
expected from Supervisor Reed
to-morrow afternoon at the
meeting of the Board of Super
visors on the question of public
utilities and suppressed reports in the
keeping of the Board of Public Works.
Supervisor Reed left the city shortly after
the meeting of the Committee on Public
Utilities of the Board of Supervisors on
Friday afternoon, taking vrith him for
study the report of Engineer Luther Wag
oner on the proposed Tuolumne River
supply of water for municipal purposes.
Wagoner stands high in his profession
and has for years been called upon to
make estimates and superintend work for
tome of the largest enterprises on the
continent. For years he was connected
\rith the United States Geological Survey
and has an Intimate acquaintance with
the formation of all parts of California-
He made a report placing the cost of
bringing a water supply to San Fran
cisco from the headwaters of the
Tuolumne River at $28,000,000. The Board
of Public Works added $10,000,000 to his
estimate. Supervisor Reed wished to find
out why this big sum was added and he
had a lively time with the members of
the Board of Public Works before he
could secure the information to which
as a public official he felt he was en
titled.
The report on the Tuolumne River
project was not the only one which
showed a raising of the estimate. Even
the estimates of the venerable president
of the Board of Public Works were made
subject for revision an<i Increase. When
Colonel Mendell was a his prime he
made an estimate as to the cost of bring
ing water from Lake Tahoe. His figures
â were $20,512,000 and his report and esti
mates are regarded by engineers as prac
tically a text book.
When the engineers of the Board of
Public Works submitted their estimate
for this purpose the figures were raised
to $29,400,000 by City Engineer Grunsky,

although the topography of the country
had not materially changed. Instead of
utilizing the natural channels Grunsky's
plan contemplated nineteen miles of tun
nels, and the pumping of water over
mountains. This project was abandoned,
for the ostensible reason that litigation
over water rights might ensue.
Another plan that was proposed was
the utilization of the waters of the north
fork of the Yuba River. In their reports
the negineers made estimates of cost of
the several sections of the system. These
estimates Included that for a power sup
ply system as well. s
Figures Showing Increases.
The following figures are taken from
the reports of the engineers and the re
port of the Board of Public Works:
Private engineers* estimate of cost from the
Tuba River to the power house, $5S,591; Board
of Works' estimate. $74,000.
Six miles of canal from dam to tunnel, re
moval of rock, etc â Engineers' estimate, $23},
642; Board of Public Works' estimate. $336,
900.
Tunnel â Engineers' estimate, $579,400; Board
of Public Works' estimate. $750,000.
Oregon house reservoir dam â Engineers' es
timate, $450,000; Board of Public Works' es
timate. $1,347,400.
Included in this latter estimate was the
proposition for a masonry dam and the
clearing of 1800 acres of land.
Engineers to whom the figures obtain
able from the reports of the Board of
Public Works were submitted declared
all the estimates excessive. Said one:
There is a series of recognized formulas used
In the preparation of these estimates. Grun
sky used these same formulas, but invariably
adds one-sixteenth to the cost of his own es
timates. Sometimes he goes far beyond this,
it seems. In the Tuolumne River project
Grunsky estimates the cost of a canal or ditch
about ten feet wide and four feet deep, cut
in rock and on the sides of hills, at $30,000 a
mile. It ought to cost one-half of that. Grun
sky' 6 figures makes the price about $93 70 a
rod. The same sized ditch could be cut
through solid granite for less than $50 per
rod. Then he figures 34,300 feet of tunnel at
?25. and 17.000 feet of tunnel at $30 per loot,
while there is but little difference in the cost

VICTIM TO A SKABPE'
Because of Act of Kindness Hero of
Santiago Is Threatened With
Suit.
Because of his willingness to aid one
whom he deemed to be a friend of a be
loved comrade, Major General Shatter is
now threatened with a civil suit. for the
recovery of $496.
Late in June last a man claiming to be
E. B. Lawrence called upon General Shaf
ter and presented to him a letter pur
porting: to have been written by General
MacArthur, then in China. The bearer
â¢was recommended to the general as a
worthy man, and the statement made that
if General Shatter could accommodate
him in any manner the writer would
greatly appreciate the courtesy.
Lawrence had two drafts on a Hong
kong bank which he desired the general
to indorse. Anxious to serve a supposed
friend of General Mac Arthur, General
Shatter readily complied. He paid no fur
ther attention to the matter until the
local officials of the Hongkong and Shang
hai Bank notified him that the drafts
signed by him were forgeries and that
he would be called upon to refund the
money paid by the bank to the sharper
Lawrence solely on his indorsement.
It has transpired that the letter signed
by General MacArthur was also forged.
General Shatter has placed the matter in
the hands of his attorney, Captain Eu
gene T. Wilson, and he will not pay for
his misplaced friendship unless ordered to
do so by the courts.

of driving a tunnel.
Another thing. Wagoner In the plan he pre
sented recommended a tunnel through the hills
in Corral Hollow near Livermore on an easy
gradient This tunnel was estimated as a mile
long, and would save the expense of a pump
ing station. Grunsky added a pumping plant,
to raise the water over a hill 100 feet high,
which would be a constant source of expense
to " the city. There are about six or eight
sources of water , supply which could be
brought to the city at about one-half the cost
at which the City Engineer estimates. â¢ Even
the Spring Valley system might be bought for
less. â¢
Engineers Averse to Talking.
| Luther "Wagoner, who â  suggested the
Tuolumne River plan, was averse, last
night to discussing his report. "It is a
matter of delicacy with me," he said.
"I submitted my report to Mr. Grunsky,
and what was done afterward in the re
vision of the estimates I do not know.
1 resigned from the employe of the city
more than six months ago." Continuing,
he said: . . - â¢â â 
I suggested the Tuolumne River plan to Mr.
Grunsky. I knew the country thoroughly, hav
ing been in charge of mining interests there for
years, besides being connected for. years with
the United States Geological Survey, from
whose maps of the mountains, and those of the
State Engineering Bureau for the valleys, I se
cured my data. My plan was for an over
ground pipe line, bringing the water around
the bay by way of Mission San Jose and Red
wood City over the cultivated lands to the city.
It was five miles longer than' taking the pipes
to Dumbarton Point and thence across the bay.
Submerged pipes always are subject to damage.
The data was necessarily incomplete and im
perfect, but was the best we had. I understand
field parties were out last summer. to make a
complete survey of the whole Tuolumne River
supply system.
City Engineer Grunsky would not dis
cuss the matter at length. He said:
The Wagoner report, memorandum, or esti
mate, whatever one may wish to call it, was a
private paper and not Intended for public Inspec
tion. â  Most of our papers are not complete, and
we cannot give them out. The easiest way Is
to drop the whole matter, as publicity often
interferes with our plans.
The final meeting of the Committee on
Public Utilities will be held on Friday,
though a progressive report will be made
to-morrow to the Board of "Supervisors.
PARIS KILBURN
GUEST OF HONOR
Harbor Commissioners
and Staff Give a
Banquet.
The Harbor Commissioners and staff of
employes gave a banquet last night in the
board room in the ferry building to Paris
Kilburn, president of the board. In ad
dition to the commissioners and employes
more than one hundred invited guests
were present, including the wives, daugh
ters and women friends of the hosts.
Former Commissioners Dan'T. Cole and
Major Harney and former Governor
James H. Budd were also In attendance.
Mr. Kilburn had been led to think that
Secretary "Bill" English was to be the
guest of honor and his surprise was com
plete when he was informed by Commis
sioner Rudolph Herold Jr. In an intro
ductory speech that he was to be the re
cipient of the sentimental part of the
affair. Herold, continuing, said that Mrs.
Kilburn was to receive the more sub
stantial token of the esteem In which she
and her husband were held by the com
missioners and staff of employes. At a
signal a huge flag which had- served' as
a covering was removed from the table
in the center of the room and a splendid
gift of hand-painted china, cut glass and
Bohemian glass was revealed. It com
prised a fish set and a roast set of china,
four sets of Bohemian glasses and a set
of finger bowls and several pieces of cut
glass.
Mr. Kilburn replied with feeling to Mr.
Herold's very complimentary speech. -He
praised his colleagues for their able and
conscientious service and threw a few
bouquets to Governor Gage, who was
"though lost to view to memory dear."
Every speaker had a good word for the
Governor and the cheers of the assem
blage of appointees drowned the whistle
of the ferry-boats. Ex-Governor Budd In
his speech stole a. march'on the others by
proposing three cheers for Governor Gage.
The cheers were given with enthusiasm. .
After the speechmaking the refresh
ments were served.. .: . .
Music was furnished by a string; or
chestra from the Pensacola and by a
male cuartet.
The board room was elaborately dec
orated by the ferry florists. 1 the chief feat
ure being festoons of evergreens, from the
midst of which sparkled many tiny in
candeacent lights.

Made a Record Buiu
The American-Hawaiian . Steamship
Company's Hawaiian arrived from New
York in a record-breaking run for a
freighter. She came around the Horn in
nearly sixty-one days and made port look
ing as spick and span as when she left
here several months- ago. Stops were
made at St. Lucia and Coronel for coal
but the delay was not great. The Straits
of Magellan were passed through without
Incident, and near the Pacific entrance the
American and Californian of the same
line were met. They were on their way
from Honolulu to Philadelphia with
sugar.
The Hawaiian brings a cargo of nearly
9000 tons. It is all general merchandise,
and the work of discharging It will begin
Monday at Steuart-street wharf.
Captain Banfleld says he never had a
finer or more pleasant run around the
continent. He had good weather in the
Atlantic and Pacific until off the Califor
nia coast, when a norther was encoun
tered. >
