Ingram was Intensely religious, attend

with his -professed views. His closest

would have been opposed to his whole ca

to numberless written . evidences of . her

retirement from active duties in the army
to the quiet and rest of the retiredy-Nst,
and in thus retiring after a few days.over
forty years' service, I wish to say that I
go to my retirement a happy and con
tented man, feeling that I have been re
warded far beyond the most sanguins
hopes of my youth.
"I have never thought I was conferring
a favor on the Government by holding Its
commission, but rather that a great honor
was being done me by giving me that
privilege. \.
"I regard myself as particularly fortu
nate In having at the beginning and end
of my military life, and at an interval of
nearly thirty-live years, had the honor of
serving in two -"/ars, the one for the pres
ervation and integrity of the Union, and
the other to give political life and free
dom to our distressed neighbors in Cuba.
Takes Her Proper Place.
"In this last war we have built better
than we thought. An empire has been
added to our already vast domain, and
with it I believe comes an era of prosper
ity to all our people . such as never has
been seen in this country before, and the
United States has now taken her place as
one of the most powerful governments of
the world.
"In this connection I wish to quote from
a letter written to me by a distinguished
American-citizen, then in the city of St.
Petersburg: .
" 'I have recently been in Paris, Berlin,
Vienna and am now in St. Petersburg, and
I wish to say to you that since Dewey's
victory in Manila Bay and Sampson's and
vours at Santiago a change has come over
the people of these cities. They- no longer
sneer at Ameriean arms.' v .
"This was a letter, gentlemen,, received
by me a short <Jme after the surrender of
the Spanish troops at Santiago, and was
written by my friend who stands here,
the Hon. Irving M. Scott.
"And now, gentlemen, in saying good-by
to you officially I wish to thank each and
all of you for your . cordial support and
assistance to me in the command of this
department. : .
"I: has made my task as its commander
an easy ore. I am grateful for It. ' I hope
that In the busy rush of business I have
never, by my brusqueness,- wounded the
feelings of any of you. If I have I regret
it, for I have never had occasion to tind
fault with an oiflcer serving with me."
Turning to General Young, who sat a lit
tle to his left, the retiring- general grasr-ed
the hand of his successor and said: -
"And now, my old-t'.me friend, : I have
to say that I would rather turn +over the
command to you than, to any other gen
eral officer in the army. 1 . "We have served
many years together,; on 'the frontier and
in the field, and later In the Spanish war,
where 'you distinguished yourself In ihe
first clash of arms with Spanish troops.
"I wish to thank you, gentlemen of Â¦ this
city, for hcnorltig this occasion -with your
presence. ,1 h'ope in the years to come I
may ete much of you and that I.- may

he was made major general, United States

"WASHINGTON, June SO.â The State of
Bouth Carolina, acting through the Gov
ernor and Attorney General, has Instituted
proceedings before the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to test the question
whether the State can be legally required
to take out special tax stamps as a whble
rale and retail liquor dealer under their
Otate dispensary laws, and has made a
demand upon the Commissioner for a re
fund' of all such tax hitherto paid,
amounting to S4916.
The principle at Issue is far-reaching.
The one question Involved Is whether the
Internal revenue laws of the United
States apply to the dispensary system of
South Carolina so as to entitle the Col-;
lector to demand the payment of these
taxes. Tbe entire dispensary system of
South Carolina Is managed by a Board of
Commissioners, consisting of three per
sons, selected by the State Legislature,
with Columbia as its headquarters. This
State dispensary distributes supplies to
the country dispensaries, and these In
turn are managed by county dispensaries
or agents, all being under the Board of
Stale Commissioners. Under the law no
liquor can be sold at night nor drunk on
the premises of the dispensary. The li
quors are sold as the property of the
State and the profits accrue to the State.
The salaries of all the officers of the dis
pensÂ»"J_ /are fixed by law and do not de
pend'on the amount of their sales.
In the brief filed with the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue on behalf of the
State it is contended that there is nothing
in tbe laws of the United States authoriz
ing the collection of internal revenue
taxes which even implledly authorize the
imposition of a tax against a State or Its
instrumentalities of government, and that
puch an act containing a provision taxing
the instrumentalities of the State Govern
ment would be to that extent unconstitu
tional. It Is contended further that the
property of a State and the means and In
strumentalities employed by It to carry
its laws into operation cannot be taxed
by the Federal Government, and an-opin
ion of the late Judge Cooley on this ques
tion is quoted.

MAJOR GENERAL SHAFTER -'RETIRES
SHAFTER WON HONORS
BY DEEDS OF DARING
IN the two-score years that^Major General Shatter wore the army blue he
has participated in many affairs requiring gTeat ability as a â¢ soldier as
well as diplomatic skill. In every affair intrusted to his care he has dis
played tkat ability which has given him the reputation so sought after
by the officers of the armyâ a reputation as a, man of courage, quick dis
cernment and good judgment.
To Shatter was intrusted the carrying out of the Cuban campaign. How
well he performed his duties is a matter of history and of too recent date to
need mention. He returned from Cuba wearing his lAurels modestly. He had
simply done his duty. But Uncle Sam is not ungrateful, and showered more
honors upon him. â¢ i
As major general of volunteers he was content to serve until October,
1S93, when by action of law he would be retired, but a grateful country willed
otherwise. The passage of the new army bill created a vacancy in the ranks
of the major generals of the regular army, and Shatter was retained In the
service and commissioned major general, United States army. .
The retiring commander of the Department of California has been a man
of note In military circles since his entry Into the service as a lieutenant In
the Seventh Michigan Volunteers In 1862. Three months after he entered the
service he was made a major of the Nineteenth Michigan Volunteers, and in
June, 1S64, was made a lieutenant colonel of the same regiment.
In the first year of his service on the field of battle he behaved with such
conspicuous gallantry that Congress awarded him a medal of honor. At the
b2ttle of Fair Oaks, Va., while in command of a detachment of pioneers he
voluntarily engaged in the strife. Though severely wounded, he refused to
leave the battlefield and remained exposed to fire until the close of one of
the hardest fought battles of the Civil "War. A short time afterward he yeas
made a colonel of the Seventeenth Infantry, United States colored trdops.
"While serving with them he behaved with such bravery that he was brevetted
brigadier general cf volunteers.
A few months later he web mustered out. He re-entered the service again
as lieutenant colonel of the Forty-first Infantry and was with the regiment
for a short time, when hie was brevetted colonel for gallant and meritorious
service at the battle of Gettysburg. .
He was assigned to the Twenty-fourth Infantry In April, 1869, and went
with that regiment to Texas. He served for ten years In the Lone Star State,
New Mexico and along the Rio Grande. His campaigns against the Indians
were so successful that he was mentioned repeatedly In orders by Generals
Ord and McKenzie as one of the bravest and most energetic men In the
service. - â¢_. â¢
He was assigned to â¢ the First Infantry as colonel in 1879, and under his
command the regiment became famous. The "Gallant First" garrisoned most
cf the posts in California, and under Shafter's command' soon achieved so
many successes that it became known as the crack regiment of the army.
During the railroad strike in 1S96 General Shatter Â¦was sent to Los Angeles
in command of the troops in that section. It is a matter of record that in
the district commanded by him in those troublous times peace and order
reigned supreme. ~
While in command of the First Infantry, which was stationed at Angel,
Island, he applied for and was granted a leave of absence for one month. He '
went to Washington, and while there was appointed brigadier general. He re
turned to this State and assumed command of the Department of California.
War between Spain and this country was on the verge of breaking out, and
rumor had It, that Shatter would be selected to command the forces to be sent
to Cuba to lead the fight against: the Dons. Rumor was not mistaken in this
instance, for one' month after Congress had declared war he was appointed
major geoeral of volunteers and ordered to Tanipa. '
He 'went to Cuba at the head of the United States troops, landed them in
masterly- style and won a victory, for the Stars and Stripes, which gave him
rank as one of the foremost military commanders of the day.
BEOOMMENDS WIRELESS
TELEGRAPHY UT MAVY
Â¦WASHINGTON, June 30.â In his forth
coming annual report Rear Admiral
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment, will earnestly point out the neces
sity of equipping American men-of-war
with a system, of wireless telegraphy.
As soon as the appropriation is obtained
Admiral Bradford will recommend a sys
tem to be adopted for the naval . service.
In the meantime he Is getting all in
formation available regarding the systems
in operation and undergoing development.
Believing that Commander Richardson
Clover, naval attache in London, is deep
ly occupied with his current work he has
recommended to Secretary Long that a
Â¦wireless telegraph expert be sent to Eng
land for the purpose of representing the
navy in the forthcoming trials of 'the two
new systems developed by the Lloyds
Ag-ency. Action has not yet been taken
upon lils recommendation.
SACRAMENTO. June 30.â It Is now
within a few days of two months
since the disappearance of Wil
liam Ingram, the Sacramento
merchant, which was reported st
the time exclusively in The Call. The ex
planation has not yet been accepted as to
why Mr. Ingram should have surrendered
possession of his property, worth $50,000,
and gone away from the city with but
$150 in his pocket and no clothes other
than those on his back.
Since the day of his' departure, May 4,
when he wrote several letters from San
Francisco, giving no hint of trouble, be
has not been seen or heard from. The
best detectives in the State have been un
able to furnish the slightest information
touching his whereabouts. He had pre
viously transferred to his wife his part

ware firm of Schaw, Ingram & Batcher,
which Is rated in all the mercantile agen
cies as one of the soundest on the Pacific
Coast. The firm owns a large pipe works

SACRAMENTO, June 30. â Former
Attorney General A. L., Hart
died at lavermore to-day. He
had been^ failing for several
years and his condition had s>o
rapidly grown worse within the past few
months that his death was not unexpect
ed. His brothers. Judge E. C. Hart and
Dr. A. C. Hart, and his father-in-law.
William Beckman, were informed by tele
graph of the passing of the distinguished
lawyer. No arrangements have yet been
made for the funeral, deference being
made to the wishes of Mrs. Hart In this
' respect-
General Hart went to the Llvermore
Sanitarium from San Francisco In April
of last year. During the last few weeks
of the action brought by Mrs. Emma Ster
rett against the estate of the late Gustav
Walter, former proprietor of the Orpheum
Theater, Hart Â¦was called Into the case as
counsel for the plaintiff, and It was satd
that his constant application in that case
resulted in the nervous prostration that
has ended in his death.
"When his condition became such that
an immediate collapse was expected.
Colonel Beckman of Sacramento, Hart's
father-in-law, urged him to go 'to the
sanitarium. Colonel Beckman stated at
â¢that time that Hart's condition was due
to excessive cigar-smoking and overwork.
It was hoped: and beHeved that a few
weeks' rest would result in his recovery.
Luminous iLegal Â¦ Career.
General A. L. Hart was born in Indiana
fifty-one years ago. In the fifties, accom

Â¦Among the memorable cases In which
General Hart figured while practicing
here was that of George Jeffries, charged
with the Olga Ayres murder at Brighton,
for whom he secured an acquittal. His
acquittal of Daniel M. .Burns on a felony
charge is historical in legal annals. He
cleared every one of the railroad strikers
charged"at Woodland with murder in 1894.
He was their counsel 'and Salter D. Wor
den, whom he did pot defend, was the
only one convicted.' For three months
he was engaged at; Fresno in the cele
brated Poly. Heilbcrn & Company lami
case, and won it in the Superior and Su

cause that George C. Uorham in tyis paper
complimented him and recorded /the fact

even members of the Suprerae: bench
themselves had spoken in pr&lse of his
remarkable effort. Hart was /nominated
for Attorney General at the flme M. M.

his, fortunes and he returned to San Jose
to enter upon the study of law "under,
Judge Lawrence Archer. v j . â¢
' When 21 years of age he was admitted
to practice. His father having removed
to Colusa. he followed him to that county,
and began there the practice of his pro-'
fession. At the age of 24 years he was
elected on the Republican ticket to the
position of District Attorney, although
Colusa County was overwhelmingly Dem
ocratic. In 1879, when he was only 29
years old, he was nominated by the Re
publican State Convention for Attorney
General and was elected with Governor
George C. Perkins at the head of the tick
et. The youngest man who had ever oc
cupied that important post in this State,
his term of office was the first under the
newly adopted constitution, an* . he was
obliged to handle numerous fmportant
questions growing out of the introduction
of the new instrument.

THACKER, W. Va.. June 30.â A posse
of eight men went to the Kentucky side
of Tug River this morning and captured
nine miners, who are charged with terror
izing the miners of the West Virginia side
of the river for the past ten days by
thootlng at all who could not give the
proper strikers' signal as they passed and
rcpassed along the railroad.
They were "surprised in their sleep, with
their Winchesters under their pillows,
and surrendered with but little resistance.
Even their euard was captured, asleep
on duty. They were brought to this place
and held under heavy guard awaiting the
train to take them before a Kentucky
Judge, who remanded them to Judge
Jackson at Parkersbure, W. Va.
Later in the day Charles Burke, presi
dent of the local union of United Mine
Workers of America, was arrested. He
â¢was taken to Parkesburg to appear be
fore Judge Jackson on the charge of tear
ing down the notices of the injunction
granted by Judge Jackson.
It is generally believed that this will
break up the fighting end of the strikers'
troubles and mat their differences will
soon be compromised in a satisfactory
manner.

ONE LETTER ESPECIALLY CONSPICUOUS IN NAMES
OF OFFICIALS OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY
Of the Twenty-Six Composing the Alphabet H Stands Out More Promi
nently Than Any Other. ' /
If Gwin had succeeded in his plans for Sonora and
Northern Mexico the slow evolution of order in that
country, which it owes to Diaz, would have been sub
stituted by a rapid transformation into an American
community. The plan failed, but it was great and
worthy of the great mind which conceived it. .
History that is may be hardly Â¦more important and
interesting than history that might have been. If
Abd-er-Rahman instead of Charles Martel had won at
Tours, and Majiometism had spread over Europe, as
it would, in what corner of the earth would Christian
ity now be hiding, a fugitive?
His letters to his wife are the best extant history, of
the hope and despair and tragedy that make up the
rapidly shifting scene between the crowning of an
Emperor in the capital and the shooting of a prisoner
at Queretaro.
He was a State builder. It is necessary to interpret
his career in Mexico by his policy in regard to Cali
fornia and Alaska. His correspondence from Mexico
shows that from the beginning he doubted the sta
bility of Maximilian's empire. Jhat Austrian Prince,
the manliest and gentlest of the Hapsburgs, had no
talent for rugged, practical administration. Gwin, by
his influence with the Emperor Napoleon, had secured
concessions and power which he proposed to use by
creating an Anglo-Saxon State in Northern Mexico.
His faith was in his own countrymen. He had no
confidence in the pied and polyglot empire which
must grow out of Maximilian's venture. : . He had
all faith in the homogeneous State that would arise
by the influx of Americans into Sonora. 1 But, to the
success of his great plan for the founding of a State,
it was necessary that the empire should be adminis
tered in the spirit of practical government. His let
ters from the City of Mexico show a keen apprecia
tion of the difficulties which must, be met and over
come under the most favorable circumstances, and
they soon reveal his growing conviction that the em
pire would -fail. With Maximilian interested in Mexi
can entomology and botany more than in the practi
cal details of government he foresaw the fall.
Dr. Gwin was a Southern man and a slaveholder.
If habit and prejudice could influence any one he
would have insisted upon a scheme tp extend the Mis
souri compromise line across California, creating a
slave State, whose northern' boundary would have
divided the Territory on a line running east and west
through Monterey and Fresno. But this would have
been a mutilation and would have hindered the devel
opment of the free State north and the slave State
south of that line. He desired, first of all, the geo
graphical symmetry and the prosperity of his State
and so he wrought amongst the Southern members
in behalf oÂ£ free California.. In that Congress they
had the power to extend the line 36.30 and plant slav
ery on this coast, and that they were turned away from
that purpose was due to the influence of Senator Gwin
and his wife. When the issue came only a few incor
rigibles remained, led by Jefferson Davis. Dr., Gwin
was a man of peculiar foresight in matters of material
and national development. He found Russia desirous
of parting with Alaska, and long before we finally
acquired that American Siberia he 'demonstrated the
possibility of our getting it for a trifle compared with
the sum we finally paid. His study of the resources
of that vast region had convinced him of its value to
this country and he lived to see his views adopted by
Mr. Seward and Alaska brought under our. flag.
THE notices of the death of Mrs. Gwin give
proper prominence to her early influence upon the
destinies of California. Her close sympathy., and
association with her husband brought. her into promi
nence in a part /that she was able to sustain. The
speeches made on Mr. Clay's omnibus bill are full of
the information secured by members of Congress from
Senator and Mrs. Gwin. ; Webster's speech., on that
measure is notably indebted to the Gwins for. the
philosophical reference it makes to the institution of
slavery as unsuited to the physical conditions of this
coast * -
CONDITION OF BUSINESS.
? Â¦ -*HE feature in business last week was the failure
â¢ Jjff the. Seventh National Bank of New York, but
g|s it was due to carelessness in loaning on poor
Â¦Tp^-al it bore no especial significance and produced
fwit a momentary effect. It alarmed certain
ffiLbtors, however, and for a day or two there
â¢Jjifafincreased demand for'loans to patch up inse
jjifiancial fences here and there, but Wall street
f||uqng as usual, and in a few days, probably, the
'â¢jÂ»Pii nt will be forgotten. Immediately prior to this
a bank in Berlin went under, owing to similar
ffiyelessn'ess in accepting securities, but beyond these
fu,o financial failures the different exchanges of the
world were quiet and featureless. The general ten
dency in Wall street was toward a lower range of
values, but the market was a professional one, as the
public still hold aloof.
' Distributive trade, as a rule, continues good. Ex
treme hot weather in most parts of the East and West
has checked the demand for some goods and stimu
lated business in others. There- is a better call for
woolens for fall delivery, and firmer quotations for
. the finer grades are reported. Shipments of boots
\ad shoes continue heavy, being much larger than
at thr time last year, and the excess seems to be in
-creasinj* There is also a good export demand for
leather. The iron and steel trade remains very much
as previously reported, and is away ahead of this time
Xa&X 3 r ear in point* of activity. Then m^ny mills were
Jtdle: now practically all are running and most of thenf
'have all the orders they can attend to. The demand
for structural material and builders' hardware is keen,
showing extensive building operations throughout the
country, while the railroads are continually ordering
.'moTe cars. These three lines â iron, woolen goods
and boots and shoes â are at present leading all others,
and outside of this there is nothing going on in gen
eral merchandise to call for especial comment
The condition of trade, as shown by the bank clear
ings, is 49.1 per cent better than at this time last year,
at least as far as the volume of business is concerned,
and only three important points â Minneapolis, St.-
Paul and Omaha â show a decrease from last year.
In spite of the inactivity in Wall street New York
shows' a gain of 70.9 percent; and Boston, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, St. Louis. and Pittsburg all exhibit large
gains. The country's failures for the week were 204,
against 207 during the corresponding week in 1900.
So, as far as these statistics go, the country seems to
be in an exceptionally strong position' commercially.
The crop outlook, as a rule, is brilliant. While our
crop of wheat will probably be very large, current
estimates placing it at about 700,000,000 bushels,
-t^sfast about 550,000,000 last year, 'we will probably
have an excellent customer in France, which reports
a poor outlook and expects a heavy deficiency. The
increase will probably find an outlet through this
French channel.
Local business shows little change. We. are now
harvesting heavy hay and grain crops, and, while the.
yield of fruit this year is rather under the average,
there will be enough for a good shipping record later
on, and prices are satisfactory, owing to the shortage.
The wholesalers, almost without exception, report
trade very good, though it has begun to slacken dur
ing the past week or so, as-it always does during the
midsummer holiday season. We are very free from
failures, and" the banks all report a plenitude of funds.
As far as all indications go, the present year is a good
as any of its successful predecessors, which is saying
a good deal.

. As it has long been known that the taxes were to
be terminated to-day, it is not likely there are many
tax stamps or stamped checks' in the hands of the
people. The Government, however, under certain
conditions, will -redeem such as are outstanding.
Documentary stamps, for example, must be presented
in sums of $2 or more and within two years of the
time of their purchase, .;and claims for recovery of
money must be accompanied by the dealers and col

WAR TAX REDUCTIONS.
PERCENTAGE CHARITY AGAIN.
OUR- Youth, ,'a weekly publication issued and
sold for the. benefit of the San" Francisco Boys'
Home; has in two successive numbers, those
of June 22 and 29, commented adversely upon the
action of The Call in exposing the schemes and the
methods of the percentage charity entertainers who
were recently at work in this city. In noting the
results of the.exposure The Call pointed but that the
charitable institutions of the city would be benefited,
inasmuch as they would hereafter receive all' sums that
the liberality of' our people intend for charitable pur
poses, and not be forced to. content themselves with a
mere percentage. With that claim the editor of Our
Youth takes* issue. ' â¢ ;
After stating that "we, the charities," have been,
struggling with many problems, are hampered by
scarcity of money, have begged with letters and the
best of solicitors but "have somehow failed to touch
the heart of the big, warm-hearted San Francisco pub
lic," he goes" on to say: ."To us comes an Eastern
entertainer. He brings recommendations from the
highest and best societies- of the East. . *â¢*â¢-*Â¦ We
arrange an entertainment with this man. With a band
of well trained workers * he canvasses the city and
brings our work to the notice of men we never could
have reached. The entertainment is well advertised,
well managed and successful, and we receive a larger
amount as our share Jhan has resulted from any three
or four entertainments we have ever given ourselves."
Such is the plea made for percentage charity. It
does not appear to have occurred to the' editor of Our
Youth that the success achieved was in the nature of
fraud, since it-was not known, to the patrons of the
entertainment that the money obtained was to be given
not to the charity named as the beneficiary, but to the
promoters of the . entertainment itself.. Such a plan
could be worked several times with profit, but, in the
end the public would learn the nature of the scheme
and then every charitable entertainment or undertak
ing would suffer. As soon as the public learned that
charities were being used for private gain there would
be a revulsion against them that would greatly dimin
ish the honor in which they are now held.
The view which is now taken by Ouj>Â£ Youth Js 
largely colored by personal feeling. That is made. >
evident by the fact that in commenting upon the en-|^
tertainment given for the Boys' Home at Golden Gate;
Hall the editor says: "We can't help feeling ..quite ".
resentful toward the daily paper that made it a finan-;
cial failure." Such a feeling is perhaps natural, but
so long as it exists the editor cannot take a fair view
of the subject. There is one feature of the issue, how
ever, which he may be able to. see clearly even in his
present frame of mind. The Call did nothing more
than publish the exact nature of the percentage enter
tainments. If they were good, why was it they col
lapsed as soon as the publication was made?.
The Call did not in any way . misrepresent the
schemes or the methods of the entertainers, and if the
public refused to support their entertainments after
the facts were known , it was only because popular
judgment does not approve of that system of working
for charity. Had The. Call stood aside and permitted
the practice to go on, the results might have involved
the good names of many persons associated with our
charities and some might have been juspected of shar
ing in the percentage that went to private gain. It
was therefore for the interest of all that the exposure
was made, and we repeat that among the beneficiaries
none have had a larger share than our charitable asso
ciations. . Â¦ " Â¦ â¢ , ' â¢ .
THE departure of, the n^w armored cruiser Cressy from
Portsmouth for China has been delayed for several weeks
owing to the breakdown of her, steering gear. A court
of inquiry found , that the mishap was due to some cne
haying tampered with the steering apparatus while the
ship was at anchor. The damage is such as to necessitate con
siderable work, and it was proposed to fit the rudder of the
Spartiate, another new but disabled cruiser, to the Cressy,
but this has been found impracticable.

A mutiny of sailor workmen at the . Constantinople arsenal
took place last month. Their grievance' was that although
their time of service had expired a year ago they were forced
to remain, and their meager payâ of about five cents a day
had fallen in arrears. About one hundred of these men made an
effort to leave the arsenal in order to lay their' grievance before
the Sultan, but the guard with a few bayonet thrusts drove
the mutineers back, severely wounding nine of the crowd. A
number of the men were also arrested. Similar outbreaks are
threatened in other Government departments, where many of
th workmen are said to be reduced to starvation, as they have
not_ been paid for many months back.

An explosion occurred June 5 on board the British destroyer
Daring, when one of the tubes In a Thornycroft boiler blew
out, killing one man and injuring four others severely. A re
markable part of the accident is the fact that the vessel was
steaming at .the low speed of six knots, and that steam, had
been actually reduced when the explosion occurred.

Fireproof wood is to be discarded in decks and Joiner work

Commander Wadagakl of the battleship Hatsuse at Tt *Â°~
suku committed suicide In his cabin on May 25 by cutting nis
throat with a sword. He graduated from the naval school in
1S84, and attained the rank of commander two years ago. Tem
porary insanity caused the act of the promising officer.
A novel suggestion for army and navy reform was recently
proposed by Major General Webber, a retired engineer offlcer
in the British army. In the paper which he read before tne
United Service Institution he proposes the establishment of a
permanent Advisory Board, composed of officers from the navy
and army, to be selected by the Crown, and to be as Inde
pendent and a3 immovable as the members of the Judicial
Bench. He would leave many details as they are now, to tna
administrations of the Admiralty and War Office, but the in
telligence departments of the two services should be trans
ferred to the Advisory Board.
The growth of the United States navy of the last ten years
in ships and men has outstripped many of the attending shore
requirements, and the Navy Department finds Itself cramped
for prison accommodations. The naval prisons at Boston and
Mare Island have been enlarged and it is now decided to
utilize the Southery, a former collier, as a receiving ship at
Norfolk for prisoners until they can be transferred to the shore
prisons. There are now nearly three times as many men and
boys in the navy as there were ten years ago, and while the
proportion of offenses has largely diminished, owing to the
greater care exercised in enlisting, there is of course an in
creased number of offenders to be temporarily provided for
until they are dismissed from the service for good.
Ninety-five vessels are in course of construction for "the
French navy. The list embraces four battleships, fourteen
armored cruisers, one protected cruiser, twenty-flve destroyers,
three sea-going torpedo boats, twenty-four coast and harbor
torpedo boats and twenty-four submarine boats.
The Teal, one of two shallow draught gunboats built by
Yarrow for* the British navy, has had a successful trial. The
boat was to carry a load of forty tons In armament and coal
on a draught of two feet three inches. All the vulnerable parts
of the vessel are platedâ proof against rifle fire. On the trial
the boat drew two feet two and a. quarter Inches and averaged

now some oil must be poured on the trou
bled minds of seme of the local horsemen
before the scheme of the Park Commis
sioners to make driving In the city's great
pleasure place more pleasant will be
unanimously admitted a success.. It is
the consensus of opinion, however, that
the benefits to horsemen' already derived
through putting into operation the plan
to sprinkle the park roads with crude pe
troleum outweigh its shortcomings, and
the scheme of the Park Commissioners
is not as yet in full effect.
Several horsemen who drove through
the park yesterday complained that the
bits of oil-soaked sand left unsightly spots
on their driving coats and deadened
the gloss of their vehicles, 1 This was true,
in a measure, but these few complainers
did not stop to consider the fact that
there was no dust to fill their eyes and
the lungs of their speeding horses, and
again that the evergreens, foliage and
grass along the driveways were greener
than ever before at this time of the year,
for no dust had gathered on them in red,
unsightly coats. . - .
It is also explained by those who have
the matter of sprinkling the roads with
oil in charge that the small matter of the
flying bits of oil-soaked sand will be cor
rected within a few weeks. When the road
has become sufficiently packed a light
layer of white sand will be sprinkled
thfcreon, and the result will be roads as
smooth as the proverbial barn floor, dust
less and noiseless.
No accidents or incidents worthy of
mention were reported to the park police
yesterday. The crowds around the music
stand and at the beach were larger than
for some weeks past. The. memory of the
few days' warm weather California has
been enjoying caused many people to
leave their homes for a day's outing but :
they were disappointed, for the warm
spell had passed. It was chilly and windy
at the park ami beach, and early in the
afternoon the people began to turn home

Tucapel Brings News of a
Smallpox * Scare in
Costa Rica.
A fleet of steamships made port yester
day; One was the Tucapel from South
and Central America; another was the
San Jose from Panama and way ports;
two more were the Asuncion and Enter
prise from New Yorlc, while the remainder
were coasters. The Curacao from Mexi
can ports and the Zealandla from Hono
lulu were both expected during the morn
ing, but they were delayed by the heavy
northerly gale reported off shore. Late in
the evening the Curacao got In, but it
will probably be this morning before the
Zealand:.* comes along.
The Tucapel brought up more than fifty
passengers and 9M) tons of cargo. The
San Jose left Mazatlan on the 23d inst.,
and at that time there were seventeen
people waiting transportation to San
.Francisco. They would not book by the
ban Jose, but preferred waiting for the
Tucapel. The latter did not leave Mazat
lan until the 25th inst., but she was only
a few hours behind the San Jose In mak
ing port. The Tucapel's cabin passengers
Â¦were the following- named:

Luis Oyarzun is a lieutenant in the
Chilean navy and is coining here to in
tpect the various ship building plants and
gun factories. Luis Pomar is a captain
in the Chilean navy and is on his way to
the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo.
Albert Cunnop and Herbert S. Headington
are the owners of a mine in Honduras,
said to be one of the richest in the world.
John T. Wright and family and F. M.
Hanchette and wife are returning from
a trip to Central America.
The Tucapel was considerably delayed
In Central American ports. She only had
400 packages of merchandise for San Jose
de Guatemala, but she was detained two
days in landing. At San Benito she was
ready to sail at 3 o'clock one afternoon,
but was held twenty-four hours waiting
for three packages of mail that contained
about nine letters.
The Tucapel did not stop at Punta
Arenas, Costa Rica, as smallpox was
epidemic there. The Llmari that sailed
from here several weeks -ago put in there
and v.as quarantined for twelve days.
There were three deaths from smallpox
and two from yellow fever aboard. When
the vessel was released she was ordered
direct to Valparaiso. The Limari had 600
tons of freight, nearly all machinery,
aboard for Guayaquil. This was all on top
of the other cargo, so everything in the
hold for other places had to be taken to
Valparaiso. The steamship will have to
make a special trip to deliver the stuff,
so the Aconcagua, is coming here In her
place.
The Tucapel left three stranded Ameri
cans at Acapulco. Captain Mofflt could
not let them stowaway, nor could be ship
them as crew, and they had no money
with which to pay their passage. They
had been into Mexico on a prospecting
trip and were making their way back to
the United States when they were stopped
by a small insurrection in the province of
Guerrero. The Minister there heard that
President Diaz was dying and proclaimed
himself Governor. He was afterward ar
rested and is now in jail. Failing to pass
through Guerrero the men made for Aca
pulco and by the time they reached there
had spent their last cent. They will be
sent home by the United States Consul
Enterprise and Asuncion Arrive.
Two of the steamships that are coming
here from the East for the coal trade ar
rived yesterday. The Asuncion was built
on Lake Erie and is the largest steamship
that ever came out of that sheet of water
intact. The others came through "the
locks in section. As it was, It was touch
and go with the Asuncion. -
She is a queer looking craft and there
was some trouble in getting a crew for
her at Baltimore. Soon after passing Cape
Henry" her steering gear got out of order
and the crew had much trouble getting
her to Rio de Janeiro. At the latter place
she was repaired and sailed for Coronel.
From Ccronel the voyage was uneventful.
The Enterprise was formerly the British
steamship St. George and was in the
Australian passenger trade. She was sent
to Cuba with . a cargo of coal during the
war and was stranded near the spot
where General Shafter landed.- She was
grot off and repaired at New York, after
whicn she received an American registry.
She made the run from Baltimore with
ont a stop and Is now ready to go to sea
again. She is 323 feet long, 37 feet beam,
Ti feot 10 inches deep and 2593 tons gross
burden.
Captain F. C. 'Miller of the Enterprise
Â¦was master of the press boat Wanda dur
ing the Cuban war. One of the newspaper
men with him was Dunning, who is now
on his way here to be a witness in the
Botkin case. L>uring the battle of San
tiago the Wanda had fer fore topmast
carried away. The sight of the battleship
Oregon brought the whole fight back to
Captain Miller's mind and he was loud in
his praise of the work done by the "bull
dog of the American navy."
Arrival of the San Jose.
The Pacific Mail Company's San Jose
arrived from Panama and way ports yes
terday. Among her cargo was $117,794 In
treasure for San Francisco and $42,278 in
bullion for New York. The rest of her
cargo is composed of coffee, rubber, hides
and sugar. She brought up fifteen cabin
passengers, ten gteerage passengers and
three Chinese in transit. The cabin pas

nearly a day off Cape Sasi Lucas owing to
that, and then was delayed again, owing
to a mishap to her boilers. She will be
overhauled before going out again.
Another strike is threatened. This time
the sheet metal workers are going out.
Just what their grievances may be has
not yet been determined. It is possible
it will be a sympathetic strike.,
Inquiries as to the purport of the visit
of Thomas L,. Wilson, fourth vice presi
dent of the International Machinists' "As
sociation, whom Secretary Wisler of the
local branch asserts came into this city
on Friday night, have been futile. Wilson,
is apparently one of the will'-o'-the-wisps'
connected â¢with the strike. The machin
ists contend that he has come here to set
tle matters, but so far he is not publicly
in evidence.
Wilson's Mysterious Visit.
The executive council of the State Fed
eration of Labor met yesterday morning
in room 207 of the Emma Spreckels build
ing. Those present were C. D. Rogers of
Oakland, who presided: I. Less of San
Francisco. W. J. Coons of San Jose; Har
ry Smith, of Vallejo; M. Davis, of San
Francisco, and Guy Lathrop, .who was
formerly connected with the Building
Trades Council. The only absentee was J.
C. Netz of Los Angeles.
The State Federation of Labor repre
sents some sixty odd labor organizations.
An effort is to be made to extend it
throughout the State and for that pur
pose I. Less and President Rogers will
visit Interior points. Less will take to
district work north of Tehachapl while
Rogers will go farther south.
San Jose Is the apparent 'center of the
movement, and from that city Vice Presi
dent Coons will operate.
The proposition advanced at the last
meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council advocating the publication of a
labor journal was indorsed, and will re
ceive the hearty support of the members
of the State federation.
Efforts will be made to induce all or
ganizations throughout the State to aid
the men now on strike, whether affiliated
with their union or not.
Resolutions commending the work of
Jefferson D. Pierce, national organizer of
labor, were passed. An engrossed copy
will be presented to him after he returns
to this city. If he does not come back
the copy will be forwarded.
CUTTING WAR TAX
FOR FISCAL YEAR
Many of the Stamps
Abolished and oth
ers Reduced.
Internal Revenue Office Open
at Midnight to Accom
â¢'inod.ate Brewers.
With the beginning: of the new fiscal
year many of the old war tax stamps are
abolished, and, of those that are left there
are few that have not been reduced.
Stamps will no longer have to be upon
checks, telegrams, express receipts, pat
ent medicines and proprietary articles of
all kinds, and those required on deeds
have been reduced by nearly half. The
stamps will still be required on freight re
ceipts and bonds.
There is also a reduction In the war tax
on beer and tobacco, but that on wine
remains as it was.
The tax on beer has' been reduced from
|1 85 a barrel to $1 60. The reduction goes
into effect to-day, and as the brewers
wished to have them for use this morning
they requested Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch to keep his office open for a short
time just after 12 o'clock 'last night. The
Government forbade the issue of the
stamp until the reduction went into ef
fect, which was at 12, so the brewery men
promised to send in for the new' stamps
between 12 and 1 o'clock last night if the
omce would keep open for that hour. The
office was kept open, and in the hour
nearly $15,000 was taken in for the new
beer stamps.
Ever since it was announced that the
added tax would be dropped the brewers
have been running short on stamps until
the end of the fiscal year left them with
scarcely one of the old ones. The tax on
beer before the war was $1 a barrel. This
was raised to $2 a barrel to raise revenue
for the war, and later it was reduced; to
$1 85, by allowing the brewers a discount
of IVz per cent. Now it is reduced further
by 25 cents, but 60 cents of the old war tax
still remains on. the original $1 tax on the
barrel.
On cigars the tax is now $3, where yes
terday it was $3 60 on the thousand. The
cigarette tax has been reduced from $1 50
a thousand to $1 06. The tax on tobacco
and snuff has been reduced from 12 cents
a pound to 9 6-10 cents. - â¢ k--(
All tobacco that has been stamped with
the old stamps must be inventoried in the
different stores to-day, and in the pres
ence of disinterested witnesses, and a re
bate on the old stamps will then be paid,
but the stock must be inventoried to-day
or there can be no rebate. .
The men in charge of the office of the
Internal Revenue Collector last night
were G. A. Wright, cashier, and George
Lewis, assistant cashier. Collector Lynch
was also at the office.

Better Fitted for the Henley

HENLET - ON - THE - THAMES. Jnna
30.â The Pennsylvania crew took advant
age of Sunday to enjoy a thorough rest,
the only exercise Indulged -in- being a
three-mile walk in the moratoff. All are
In first class condition.
Bob Cook, -Yale's coach, arrived last
night. To a representative of. tho Asso
ciated Press he said: "I consider tSa
P.ennaylvanians to be in better physical
condition than any other American crew
that ever reached the eve of Henley races.
They are better fitted to bring about a
victory for the Americaa.*troke than any
of the lot of men I have seen here. Their
broad blades and style of stroke lnvolva
greater force and shock to the. muscles
and system than the long body swing and
narrow blades of the British, but I think
they can stand the strain and should bava
a fair chance â¢ with the Leanders, sup
posing they meet them in the finals.
"The Pennsylvanians also havÂ» tna
great advantage of having rowed to
gether. I believe, for nearly four years.
They have Improved greatly since they
have been here and perhaps Instinctively
they have adopted some of the best points
of the British stroke." ' _Â»t
After the Killarney trip the Pennsyl
vanians will scatter, some visiting the
Continent and others returning t0 Li na

All Beady for the College Boat
Races at Fough

POUGHKEEPSIE,:N. Y., June 30.â The
varsity race: Wisconsin first, Cornell
second, i Columbia third, with Pennsyl
vania, Syracuse and Georgetown fighting
for. foruth place."' The freshmen race: Cor
nell first, Columbia second, Pennsylvania
third and Syracuse fourth. The four-oar
ed race : Pennsylvania first, ; Columbia
second, Cornell third. These are) the re
sults as" predicted by those who are rtc
ognized as, or alleged to be, experts in
aquatics. Â¦ -^
Many of the men who have watched the
crews train and who believe that they
know something^ of the relative. capaclty
of : each â¢ will Â¦- not acquiesce in these
selections. The Judgment as to Wisconsin
winning:, the varsity race comes from an
excellent source, and after those pro
nouncing -such judgment had seen the
crew on the river, last night.' This was the
practice of which O'Dea.saldhe was. not
proud; but the knowing ones winked and
called atention to the fact that last yÂ»ar
rfcbodyvknew of -the splendid 'ability of
Wisconsin's crew while its coach was
continually .bemoaning the fact that his
men were not In perfect shape.
v No matter what the critics may say or
how winners may be picked for the next
forty-eight hours, the fact remains that
this varsity race will be one of the most
picturesquely exciting ever seen In college
aquatics. There is no heavy betting on
any of the crews mentioned for. first placo
and where there ; is : betting,' no " odds arÂ»
offered.. It Is expected that for two miles
it will be the hardest kind Â¦ of: a fight
Then, judging; from the present condition
of the crews and ; barring accidents and
substitutions , : 1 1 â¢ is thought - that . Wiscon
sin, Cornell and Columbia will draw aw Â¦â¢y
from, the others and, fight it out for first

President Shaffer Will To-Day
Call Out the Hoop Com
pany's Workmen.
> . . . ,
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 30.â President
T. J. Shaffer of the Amalgamated Associ
ation of Iron. Steel and Tin Workers, will
to-morrow morning Issue an order calling
but all union employes of the various
mills of the American Steel Hoop Com
pany, known as the Hoop Trust. It is
estimated that 15,000 meii will be subject
to the-call, which, In connection with the
big strike of the American Sheet Steel
Company ordered by President Shaffer on
Saturday, will affect 50,000 men. Presi
dent Shaffer said to-night:
"The open mills to be notified are one
at Hollidaysburg, Pa., three at Pittsburg
and one at Morrison. The organized mills
which will -close on our call are the Up
per and Lower mills at Youngstown, O.;
Pomeroy, O:; Sharon, Pa.; Girardvllle,
Pa.; Warren, Pa.; Greenville, Pa. This,
I believe, will bring the number of men
affected up to 50,000. It Is a matter of re
gret, but it looks as though there will be
a fight to the death. We have funds and
will use them. If there has to be a strike
we will make It one to be remembered.
The officials now dealing with us have
but little idea of the extent to which this
strike will go once It is on."

When Henry Harris won the game at
Recreation grounds -yesterday afternoon
his team established .a record.- Five-con
secutive : victories over the Senators is
eomething for the local nine to be proud
of, and more; than that,, the series was
specially interesting from the point of
view of good baseball. The climax came
yesterday. In the morning the Senators
were defeated bj' a score of 2 to 0. The
arternoon game read 1 to 0.
Two men achieved fame In the Recre
ation Park gameâ Rube Levy and Jimmie
Whaleiu Rube is now a full-fledged league
umpire pnd his introduction took place yes
terday. Xot one of his decisions was ques
tioned by the crowd or players. "Whalen
was in the best of form and he proved too
much of a riddle for the Senators to solve.
Three isolated hits ' were secured off
Whalen's delivery and that was all.
The only run of-the game was scored in
the seventh, and a couple of two-base hits
did the trick. .Nordyke reached second
on a long rap to right field and J. Rellly
sent him over the rubber by a similarly
successful double. r
At times Sacramento came within scor
ing distance, but Whalen always steadied
at the right moment and it was grood-by
to run making by the Senatorial com

NEWPORT, R. I.,' June 30.â The yacht-
Ing season for the big 90-footers and also
the first of the tuning-up races of the In
tended cup defender Constitution will be
gin to-morrow with a thirty-mile race be
tween the new Herreshoff production and
the champion of '99, the Columbia. The
start will be made at 11 o'clock. A large
fleet of yachts are clustered about the
racers and will so out for the sport to
morrow. That the race will be an inter
esting one Is acknowledged on every hand,
for while Mr. Herreshoff has undoubtedly
made many improvements in the Consti
tution, the great speed and all around
ability of the Columbia makes her still' a
great favorite among many who saw her
work In this port two weeks ago and her
superiority over the Shamrock in the cup
races. Another element of interest is the
rivalry between Captain Rhoades of the
Constitution and Captain Barr of the Co
lumbia. '.---._
The start will be made at Brenton Reef
lightship, two miles off Batemans Point,
and can be seen from shore. It is thought
the course to-morrow will be thirty miles
to the windward or leeward. The com
mittee, however, have the option of or
dering the yachts over a triangular course
ten miles on a side. The race to-morrow
and that of Wednesday will be under the
auspices of the New York Yacht Club.
Independence All Right.
LONDON, Conn., June 30.â That the In
dependence is possessed of great capabili
ties was shown to-day in her run from
Vineyard Haven to New London, a dis
tance of seventy-five miles, in exactly 18
hours. The first twenty miles was a dead
beat down Vineyard Sound, but the re
maining fifty-five miles were made in two
long hitches and a short one, the yacht
sailing nearly the entire distance under
three lower sails and working topsail.
The sea was comparatively smooth, ex
cept from Gayhead to Point Judith, but
the yacht met heavy rollers between these
two points very easily, showing but little
tendency to pound and thrash. The wind
averaged about ten knots. The yacht
made a long board into Narragansett
Pier, passing within a few miles of New
port.
The Meteor Wins Yacht Race.
TRAVEMUND, June 30.â The Meteor,
with Emperor William on board, won to
day's yacht race In Lubeck Bay.
ROTHESAY, June 30.â A development
as Interesting as it was -, entirely unex
pected, has occurred concerning the chal
lenger for the America's cup. This is due
to the action of Kenneth M. Clark, owner
of the cutter Karaid. Mr. Clark has had
three opportunities of racing the Karaid
against the Shamrock I and he has wit
nessed all the trials of the two Shamrocks
since the challenger was refitted. His ob
servations have led him to doubt seriously
whether the Shamrock II Is good enough
to send to American waters in challenge
for the cup. He has a belief amounting
to a conviction that the Karaid is a bet
ter boat, length for length, than the
Shamrock II, and' he desires to see this
question | settled - before any yacht goes
out as a challenger.
When interviewed to-day by a repre
sentative of j the Associated Press Mr.
Clark said he had no desire whatever to
push himself forward in the matter and
had hoped to have an opportunity for re
solving his doubts quietly in the ordinary
races in which he expected the two Sham
rocks to take part. - â¢ "
"It now appears, however," said Mr.
Clark, "that the challenger will only be
tried against the Shamrock I. Even if
both sailed to win the result would only
show which of the two excelled and would
give no real proof as to whether either is
the best boat we have available. The con
test is an international affair In the fullest
sense of the word and for the credit of
British yachting and the good of sport it
is desirable that the British side of the
contest should be upheld by the best
available boat.
"I believe the Karaid Is faster than
either the Shamrocks. I may be wrong,
but that Is my opinion and I- believe J
have excellent reason for holding it. I
desire an opportunity to enter the Karaid
In the trials. If^thls request is not grant
ed I shall challenge Sir Thomas Llpton to
trial races between the Shamrock II and
the Â¦ Karaid, to be over courses similar
to the course for the America's cup and
on the American measurement in order to
decide which should be sent as the chal
lenger."
When asked whether the Karaid was
eligible and whether he would carry the
challenge if the Karaid should prove. the
faster, Mr. Clark said he had no desire
to go to the United States, but if it should
prove that Great Britain had a better
chance of success through his boat he was
prepared to carry the challenge through.
As far as the eligibility of the Karaid was
concerned he said he understood there
would be no serious difficulty, as the
Royal Ulster Yacht Club had lodged the
challenge on behalf of a cutter under
ninety feet water line and he was a mem
ber of the club and his boat answered the
description.
"If Sir Thomas Llpton has the best
boat," Mr. Clark concluded, "I shall be
delighted to stand aside. My only desire
is to insure the securing of the fastest
British yacht and this cannot be secured
beyond question without a trial."
.Mr. Clark, who is chairman of J. P.
Coates (limited) has owned many steam
yachts, but the Karaid is his first big
racing cutter. She was built last year
after "Watson's designs by the Hender
sons. ,. -*;
Mayflower and her son, Game Boy, car
ried - ; off ; first honors in their, respective
stakes yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
Mayflower beat . Sweet Emina, Â¦ Tyrone
Prince, Castaway, Buck, Agamemnon and
Honor Bright in turnl Against Tyrone
she was 5. to 3 short end, -but -was. held
favorite over the others.
Game Boy had the'speed and showed the
way to ali his opponents.- In three of his
four courses . the youngster â¢ was < played
at the small figure in the betting:. For
Glory was sold favorite over him at 2. to
1, but was beaten by a point. Then LJt
tle Sister, always a good one, tried him
out and though she too was a z to 1 choice
Game Boy got the nag. without allowing
her to score. In the nnal JJewdrojt was
picked to take the. honors and the talent,
gave cdds of 5 to 3 that he could outpoint
trie 'Boy. Dewdrop made an undecided of
it and in the run off took second place '
in the stake, scoring 5 to Game Boy's 10.
The winner's- -worn â¢ througnout was of
high, order and certainly showed the
youngster's breeding.
Dewdrop in making second place ' met
some crack flyers and until he was defeat
ed in the nnal not one of them could get
a point from him. Luxor, 2 to 1 favorite
for the course, was beaten 2 to 0 In the
nrst. Warship, 4 to 0, and Hector, stake
favorite and 2 to 1 choice for the course,
followed, score i to 0. Â¦
Fine Fire secured third money and was
only beaten by a point by Game Boy for
the right to contest in the final.
"It's an easy game to beat, but send
more money." was the story of the talent
long before the sport was over. Both
etaKes furnished twenty-seven upsets that
â¢put the pikers on even terms with the
ones of wisdom. In the first round of
the champion event Rector as favorite
won his bye. From that point until the
round closed not a favorite showed, the
seven short ends getting their flags with
out a break.
Honor Bright ran well and reached sec
ond place in the Keserve stake. She beat
Ever Sure. Bonnie Pasha and Golden Rus
set in a bye on the short end at 5 to 3 in
each event. King Cotton and Agamem
non made their way to the semi-finals.
Ihe former beat the stake favorite. War

piece has been brought strictly up
to date and is crammed with fcood things.
Alf Wheelan reappears in the "Babes"
In the part of Sir Rowland Macarsar, and
makes a great hit as the wicked uncle.
Bernice Holmes also returns to the boards
and does good work as the. cruel aunt of
the "Babes." Maud Williams is another
favorite member of the Tivoli forces who
made her reappearance last night as Miss
Raven, the school teacher. She was
warmly welcomed, and her pretty voice
added much to the musical part of the
Wrformance. Annie Myers and Edward
ebb take charge of the title role3, and
are a dashing and comical pair. Each
has two or three good songsâ Webb a
clever patter song, very well sung, and
both are excellently fitted to the parts.
Hartman and Cashman are the tramps.
Weary Willie and Dusty Rhodes, and are
irresistibly funny. The songs and gags
are new, and the piece goes smartly, from
beginning to end. There is a pretty trans
formation scene, "The Babes' Retreat,"
and the ballets are very cleverly ar
ranged. â t 9 <

McGuire and Wilson were booked on a
charge of burglary, and Wilson had a
further charge of carrying a concealed
weapon booked against him. -
The policemen discovered a man stand
ing outside Marx's fur store, 1023 Market
street, and at the same- time saw that the
glass in the front door had been broken.
The man, who gave his name as James
McGuire, was piaced under arrest.
Further investigation showed that eight
fur capes had been stolen and thrown into
the doorway. The -officers entered the
store and found another, man hiding, un
der the counter, 'who at once showed
fight. He was quickly overpowered, and
upon being searched a loaded revolver
was found in his pocket. He ' gave the
name of Thomas Wilson, but was identi
fied as George Wilkinson, who In '1897
served a three months' term for petty lar
ceny. Wilson has been working in a cigar
store at Fourth and Jessie streets.
A clever capture of two burglars was
made early yesterday morning on Market
street by Policemen Heinz, Nolting and
Driscoll. About 4 o'clock Heinz heard the
breaking of glass and proceeded to make
an investigation, after blowing his police
whistle, which was answered by Nolting
and Driscoll. .

ed and the bullet entered Price's abdo
men, and with a groan he fell to the floor.
- The central police station was notified
and also the Receiving' Hospital. Price
was taken to the hospital in the ambu
lance, where the doctors thought that the
bullet had probably penetrated the intes
tines and the wound might prove fatal.
Owing to Price's weak condition an oper
ation could not be performed.
Bonetti was taken to the central sta
tion and Lieutenant Martin ordered him
locked up in the "tanks" for further de
velopments. He was told that he should
have 6een that the revolver was not load

Impressive Memorial Services Are
. Held in the First A. M. E.
Church.
"A'. email- congregation gathere'd- at the
First African Methodist Episcopal Church
last night to listen to "the services com
memorative of the ninetle(h anniversary
of the birth of Charles Sumner. There
was a song service and then. the pastor,
the Rev. Mr. J3rown, Introduced Samuel
M. Shortridge, who spoke briefly but elo 7
quently. He sa!d:
"This nation will never live long- enough
to make amends to humanity for the
wrong done the black man. Perhaps it
will not live long enough to earn pardon
of God. Slavery was a great blot upon
the national shield. I do not speak of the
past with bitterness; but the recollection
of the past to me is full of tears. I hate
and despise slavery in every form, and
with every man of my race here to-night
I am grateful to the man whose picture
you see here to-night."
The speaker paid eloquent tribute to
Washington, Jackson and Lincoln, and
said:
"There never was In this country a more
fearless champion of liberty than Charles
Sumner. It is right that men of your race
should honor Lincoln. To Â¦ him it fell to
break the shackles of slavery. But the
clarion voice that awakened the con
science of the American people was the
voice of Charles Sumner."
The church was prettily decorated with
flags and with a portrait of Sumner.

The sower went forth to sow. He might' have
sent some one else out to sweat and blister his
hands and tire his back while he lay In a
hammock in the shade. That is gentleman
farming, but in farming or anything else If
you would have it well done you must have
an eye to it yourself. If you go riding in the
park every day with a pug by your side in the
carriage, while your nurse maid wheels your
boy ud and down in front of the house in a
perambulator, you must Â» not : be surprised If
tho dog turns out better than your boy
The sower went forth to sow, not to gouge
the seed into the ground. I need this part of
my sermon more than you do. Sometimes I
go Into a town and after about thirty minutes
begin to feel that every man who does not ac
cept my way of thinking ia a horse thief and a
liar. Sometimes a minister starts, a revival
and meets no response and then goes at you
hammer and tongs till 'he makes you wish you
had died while you were little, or that he had.
Be careful what you sow. A man who casts
a vote puts into the ground the greatest pos
sibilities " that can be sown. What you sow
will return to you in citizenship. If you voted
the Republican ticket at the last election, or
the Democratic ticket, you voted for many
good things and for good men, but you voted
for the liquor traffic, you voted to stand by
the gin mill. Before another election comes
around 400,000 more bodies of drunkards will
be rotting in the j graveyards of our country.
And if . Â¦ maybe, your boy- comes reeling out of
a saloon into your arms, may the thought of
the' sower brace you until you do not whine
about saloons, when your boy's ruin is only
the fruit of the vote you cast at the last elec
tion.
The Boy and the Dog.
He was only a sower, a Mr. Nobody of No
where, but I tell you It IE the nobodies, not
the doctors of divinity, who serve the world.
If you wero only somebody else, what a man,
what a woman you would be! But you are
not. That is the infirmity of that supposition,
lou are only yourself, and not very. much at
that; I reckon. â¢- Â¦ Â¦

If a neighbor had come along he would prob
ably have leaned against the fence and said:
â¢'I have every regard for your thrift and en
ergy, but you are crowding the season. You
are sowing on the stoniest ground in the coun
ty. The trouble is you lack sense. I am. a
farmer, but I dp not bow until other farmers
begin, and when other farmers quit sowing I
stop, too. I am a procession farmer and I
stay with the crowd." Does not that sound
familiar to you? Bo men . Bay to me: "No
doubt you are right in the abstract, but you
can't legislate men Into being good. You are
a hundred years ahead of the time.' You have
no political sagacity." My friend, it will never
be more right to be a Prohibitionist than Just
when you get that vision of duty. The time
for you to act is when you get the order from
the home office of the Universe. -
Men say sometimes that we make a' hobby of
prohibition and ride it -until we become
nuisance. If this cause does nothing else if is
at least a cure for vanity. We who have en
gaged in rescue work have sometlties plumed
ourselves on what we have accomplished. We
point vainglorious to what we have done and
pop, like a Prince Ruperfs drop, back into the
gutter goes the drunkard, or back into the
slough the rescued girl, and the heart would
break only we think of this humble sower who
went forth to sow. Never mind, pull out an
other handful of seed and : fling it wide for
Jesus sake. Take up the unromantic role of
the sower who Is happy if along the roadside
Â£ ca Â°. see the fruits of other men's sowing,
though he, poor fellow, has not a spear of grass
to show for his toil.

higher and" more ostentatious things' of^the
world. We like to have the minister take, his
text from Revelations, because then .we .are
certain "that" we do not know, what he la" talk-

not. But I want- to preach the gospel of the

these words of the parable: "A sower . went
forth "to sow." \Vhat,prospect-*tfould be less
Inviting than that set forth in this sentence?
Yet it fairly bristles. with helpful thought's for,

flat pancake of a farm; a winding road, rough,

of the late Hugh Tevls took place yester
day afternoon at the residence of his
mother on Taylor street. Rev. Dr. Foute;
rector of Grace Episcopal Church, con
ducted the services, which were of the
simplest character, as prescribed by the
Episcopal ritual. .
dnly the immediate relatives and a few
close friends were present to participate
in the last sad rites over one who in life
was held In the highest esteem. The
ashes reposed in a metallic urn on a dais,
and gathered around it were the widow of
the : deceased, his mother, Mrs. Lloyd
Tevls; his two brothers, Harry L. Tevls
and William S. Tevis, and ex-Governor
George AV. Baxter and wife.
The floral offerings, were strewn in pro
fusion around the. spacloils parlors, the
i dead man having .been a great lover of
flowers, in his life time. No disp^ltion.
was made of the ashes, but they will be
consigned to the family vault in Laurel
Hill Cemetery in the course of a tew days.
â¢ Mrs. Hugh Tevis has not as yet decided
on any plans for the future. She Is pros

The Ones Who Have Gone! Before.
The address of the grand president was
followed by a contralto solo by Miss L.11
lian Wilson, and the invocation was feel
ingly pronounced by. the Rev. Alfred b.
Clark
Secretary Charles A. Boldemann then
read' the "In Memorlam," .consisting of
the following names of members whq
have died in the past year:
OFFERING PRAYER FOR
TWENTIETH CENTTJRY
The jubilee of the century was cele
brated by the Dominican priests and the
members of the St. Dominic parish yes
terday afternoon. It was the first observ
ance of the custom in this city, and it is
probably the first of a series of similar
ceremonies.
In Europe it has been the custom for
the parishioners to visit the different
churches in a kind of pious pilgrimage
during the first year of the new century.
They march in a body from church to
church, praying in each and . listening to
sermons appropriate to the occasion.
- The custom has been observed in many
of the cities of the East already, and it
has gradually worked westward, until
now it has reached here. Last March the
announcement of the jubilee celebration
was spread through the churches of San
Francisco, and the first to heed it were
the Dominicans. The celebration was ar
ranged for yesterday afternoon.
Two hundred or more of the members
of the congregation of the church of St.
Dominic assembled In the church yester
day afternoon. They were addressed by
the Rev. Father O'Neil upon the sig
nificance of the celebration, and he also
directed them regarding the manner of
its observance.
A litany was said and then the men
formed in line, two by two, and marched
out of the church. None of the" ladies
accompanied the pilgrimage, although
there is nothing In the ceremony to pre
vent the presence of women, but they
stood upon the steps and watched the
procession as it made its way down
Steiner street and turned down Post.
The pilgrimage was to the cathedral, for
as the cathedral represents all the Catho
lic churches of the city a pilgrimage there
would have the same significance as to
all the other churches. "J"
The procession was led by the banner of
the Society of the Holy Name, and all the
members of the society, who also belong
to the parish of St. Dominic, were in the
column that followed it.
At the cathedral the procession entered
and a short prayer was offered In its
sanctuary. It was led by Father O'Neil.
A litany was also repeated, and then the
column formed again and marched back
to St. Dominic's Church, where another
prayer and another litany were said. Then
the ceremony ended.
The observance of,the Jubilee has been
held In San Jose already, and there the
women of the church took part as well as
the men.
MEMORIAL services were held
yesterday afternoon by the par.
lors of San Francisco and Ala
meda counties of the Native
Sons of the Golden West in
honor of the members of the order who
died during the last year.
Twenty-seven parlors united in the
services, which were carried out in the
Native Sons' Hall, which was filled with
members of the order and the relatives of
the departed brothers.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of the following-named gentlemen:
Robert P. Troy, chairman, San Francisco
Tarlor No. 49; Charles A. Boldeznann. secre
tary. California Parlcr No. 1; Bruce Corn-
Trail. Parlor Xa. 76; W. H. Harri
pon, Rlncon Parlor No. 72, and James H.
Roxburgh, Hesperian Parlor No. 137.
Among those present on the platform
were the following named:
Grand President F. L. Coombs, Grand Vice
President L. F. Byington. Grand Treasurer
Henry Martin. Grand Secretary Henry Lun-
Btedt, Past Grand Presidents Frank H. Dunne,
J. A. Stelnbach. Grand Trustees George L.
Jones, J. K. Kncwland, G. L. Jones. Charles
Boxton, W. D. Wagner and W. D. Shea.
The services opened with an overture
by Cassasa's orchestra and was followed
by the address of Chairman Robert P.
Troy. . .
Mr. Troy paid a loving tribute to the
dead members of the order who had
passed away in the last year and in part
said:
We are gathered hpre in this chamber to
weave a chaplet of tender sentiment that will
deck the memories of our fallen brothers and
mingle with the fragrance and purity of the
beautiful flowers that adorn their graves.
First Memorial Services.
Before this hour we have had no com/non
memorial, but the ceremony to-day marks the
initial observance of a custom that history
tplls us originated ' In the palmy days of an
cient Egypt, which has been kept through the
mutations of -many centuries and which will
survivo with us in our order until it ls^no
more.
Our thoughts are not of death, but they are
with tho dead. V.'e knew the one, we cannot
penetrate the' mystery of the other. Confucius,
whose broad philosophy would not be con
fined within the wall? of the Chinese Empire,
said: "How can I rxplaln death, when I do
pot understand life?" We seek not to fathom
the problem, we recognize It as a reality, we
mourn for our friends who have yielded to
its Influence.
The Native Sons of California are linked by
ties of history, of blood, of friendship and of
common Interest with the pioneers. Our work
commences where theirs Is ended.

MIND AFFECTED
BY HARD WORK
In order to keep the brutal assault from
becoming public Kppinger, true to his
friend Gamble, had the woman removed
to the Sutter-street hospital in a closed
carriage.
For &5me unknown reason the proprie
tress of the Leepalmer House failed to
notify the police of the fiendish assault.
It was not until yesterday that Captain
Seymour learned of the occurrence, and
he at once sent Detective Anthony to
make a thorough investigation. Going to
the hospital, Anthony tried %o interview
the girl, but without success, as the doc
tor," who was present, refused to allow
him to speak to her on account of her pre
carious condition. ,
After Gamble's arrest he said that he
was in bed when the woman was permit
ted by Eppinger to enter the room, and
that she took some papers from his pock
ets and also his revolver and exclaimed:
"I'll kill you this time!" He sprang from
the bed and grappled with her, and, as
he says, "treated her as 1 would a man."
He denies, however, striking her with the
revolver.
Becoming alarmed for his own safety.
Gamble quietly left the house before the
cjerk reached the room.
Gamble Hurriedly Departs.
With an oath Gamble violently threw
the pleading woman against the wall,
after threatening to kill her if she did
not "shut up." As she started to leave
the room the woman again threw her
arms around his neck and implored him to
return to her.
For a reply Gamble drew a revolver
from his hip pocket and struck the
woman on the "head with the butt. As
she fell to the floor the brute stood over
her and repeatedly struck her with the
revolver.
By this time Eppinger had awakened to
the seriousness of the affair, and seizing
Gamble by the right arm he managed to
take the revolver from him. The groans
of the wounded woman attracted the atten
tion of the bell boy In the house and he
lost no time in reaching the room. See
ing the ghastly wounds in, the woman's
head and thinking that she Had been mur
dered he ran down stairs and notified the
clerk.
May Gamble learned Friday morning
that the object of her affections had re
turned ' and was stopping at the Mason
street house. She determined to make
one final attempt to win him back, and
going to the house she knocked on the
door of the room occupied by Gamble anrl
his friend . Eppinger. The last named
opened the door and allowed the woman
to enter. She threw her arms around
Gamble's neck and piteously begged him
to return to her.
Strikes Her to the Floor.
May Gamble met the actor three years
ago and became infatuated with him. She
frequently declared that Gamble .was to
marry her, but .as her devotion grew
stronger the actor's love began to pale,
and finally, he packed his grip and left thu
city. He returned about a week ago, anil
Morris Eppinger allowed him to share his
apartments at the Leepalmer House.
