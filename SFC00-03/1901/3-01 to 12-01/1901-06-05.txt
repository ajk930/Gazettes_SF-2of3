THE RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL ON CHILLIWACK RESERVATION. 7. .
VANCOUVER, B. C. f June 4.-The
"tribal procession" was the great
feature of the Indian passion
play celebration at Chilliwack to
day. The number of natives In
â¢attendance has increased to nearly 3003.
To-day's ceremonies -were even more im
â¢presslve than those of the opening re-
Jception last evening to the Catholic
fathers of the Oblate order. At sunrise
the entire camp was astir. Just after 6
tents owned by individual Indians.
The scene is that of a regimental camp.
The ceremonies are conducted with per
fect harmony and not the slightest noise
disturbs them. The procession was con
ducted with all the glory t and pomp
known to the noble red man. All the
Indians took part and the six Indian
band? supplied the music The proces
sion was a mile and a half long. Bishop
Dontenwill, Father Chiroux and other
Â¦ Knox has rendered a very subtle-opin
ion. .There' is to be civil government' In
the Philippines/ but it is to be called a
military government. In all :.' provinces
where the United States authority is well
established there will be purely civil gov
ernments, such as are now being install
ed by the Taft - Commission. - For '- the
lslandsas a whole there will be a govern
ment administered by civilians under milr
itary' authority, and responsible, to" the
War Department. As soon as the revised
tariff for the Philippines Is completed ! it

most, important for many, months." For

The President f and other '.members '.of
the Cabinet agreed in this view; and "con
cluded .that there would be little"?* more
risk , in .â¢ continuing . the present, system
than in' asking Congress to legislate. This
consideration, settled the questiort.if â¢ an.
extra session; and determined the author
ities , to go on Â¦â¢collecting duties until a
possible adverse r. decision of the.;; court
stops it. It is assumed that all the duties
at* both ends will be ."paid under .protest.
Secretary Gage does , not think there ' is
any danger of; importers^ bringing any
considerable amount of goods-;. Into ,the
United States through the 'Philippines in
the Â¦ hope of I securing a refund* of j duties.
The cost of .transportation' to and from
the Philippines. would be considerable and
the amount of money locked up in duties
that would have .to be paid would be a
serious matter. -; . V
The form of government in .the Philip

There will be at the ' session a larger
representation of delegates than there has
ever before been In the history of the
order. There will be representatives from
eighty-five parlors as against seventy-six
the previous year, when the Grand Parlor
met in Jackson, Amador County. The in
crease of ten parlors during the term of
Airs. Ema Gett of Califla Parlor, Sac
ramento, who Is grand president, means
a corresponding increase of members. At
the session of 1900 the membership was
3054 and. at this. time, despite the suspen
sions which always occur, the member
ship is in excess of 4000.
There will be considerable, business In
the matter of legislation to engage tho at

will be the establishment of a scholarship

. IP-; name of the order. "While the propo
sition has been indorsed by a number of

".meet with some opposition. There are
'â¢many 'who are of the opinion that the

"maintenance of such a scholarship could
be used to better advantage in the main

great measure, be between the city and
country-parlors.' Under' the law., the
grand secretary must be a resident of
San Francisco. Miss Frakes, while It is
true that she resides in San Francisco,
still looks to Sutter Creek, where she
lived for many years, as her home, and
many of the parlors look upon her as one
from the interior. Miss Douglass, who is
the daughter of the late Captain "William
Y. Douglass, 'for a generation connected
with the Police Department of this city;
was for a number of years financial sec
retary'- of â¢ her parlor. She has many
friends, both In the city and In the coun
try. The vote, it Is believed, will be a
close one. Â¦

since the northern part. of the State has
had a grand officer who would be In line
for the office, of grand president it should
go to Mrs. Caminetti. Others think that"
it should go, .irrespective of territorial
lines, to one who is positive, aggreeslve
and full of vim, as is Miss Keith, while
there are not a few who think that the

thusiasm among the members of the local

No trains leave here for the west during

by strategy did the officers save him from
being lynched. - Three ladles were con

ately pinched one of them. He was ar
rested and lodged in'jall. Â¦â¢-Â¦,âÂ¦Â¦.'Â¦
Soon it became known that the Vigi
lantes intended to take him out, give him
a coat of tar and feathers, ride him 'on a
rail and possibly, do worse. At 10 o'clock
officers took him from the Jail, and, plac
ing two guards over him, kept him behind
the iron doors of* a business house until
morning. This morning a jury found him
guilty of battery and Justice Hill

of a drove of 5000 sheep recently brought
Into this county from Utah, ' brought in
word to-day that last Friday night ho
and his fellow herders 'were attacked at
their camp about six miles from Spencer

ers of the herders, and. then proceeded
to slaughter the sheep. About 1000 sheep

meeting of the American Medical Associa

Reed read his annual address, an abstract
of which follows:
The army reorganization law of the last
Congress was inexplicable and inexcusable. It
trades the medical department for rank, pro
motion and, in consequence, for pay, below
every other department and special corps of
the army and with the exception of second
lieutenants it la graded below the line. In ac
cordance with Its provisions a medical officer,
to obtain a colonelcy, must pass through three
times as many trials as an officer of either the
tjuartermaster'6, the subsistence or the par
departments: more than twice as many as an
officer of engineers or of ordnance and nearly
twice as many as an officer of the signal
corps.
ThÂ« effect of this discrimination is not only
to lower the rank and pay of medical officers,
but must result in lessening the efficiency of
the corps by repelling- men of spirit and worth.
It becomes the duty of every member of the
medical Â¦ profession Jealous ol his rights, his
prerogatives and the fair name he may leave
his children to resent as personal between him
self and every member of the Congress who
voted for this law the action which cast a
stigma upon our profession.
It has been the conviction of many enlight
ened members of the medical profession that
the means employed by the General Govern
ment for the protection and promotion of the
public health are capable of improvement. The
conditions to-day are precisely | the same as
they were ten years ago. I proclaim, events
proclaim, the existence of a new school of
medicine. It is as distinct from the schools of
fifty years ago as Is the Christian dispensation
from Its pagan antecedents. It is the product
of convergent Influences, of diverse antecedent
origin. It acknowledges no distinctive title.
It heralds no shibboleth. It is a school of hu
man tolerance, ot personal Independence, of
edentlnc honesty. It makes no proclamation
of completeness, no pretensions to sufficiency.
It recognizes that truth is undergoing pro
gressive renovation, not ending to-day, but
continuing through the ages. It greets as a
friend him who thinks, though he think error,
for. thinking, he may think truth and thereby
add to the common fund.

SCORE NEW LAW
The Rev. E. M. Vittum of Grinnell was
the Jirst witness. He said ?se met Dr.
Herron's wife at Grinnell in April, 1S93,
and exchanged pulpits with Dr. Herron.
He was entertained at the home of the
Rands, and they talked all the Â¦ time of
Dr. Herron. Mrs. Herron was loyal all
the time, devoted to her husband and
believed In his teachings. On his last
departure to Kurope she told a friend,
the witness said, that she "wished to
die."
Professor Charles Noble, the second
witness, confirmed the Rev." E. M. Vit
tum. Mrs. Herren was unusually loyal,
he said. Professor Noble said he was
strongly In favor of Dr. Herron at the
beginning, but had changed his views
since. Dr. Herron's book, published, in
1S92. was dedicated to his wife in these
words: ."To my wife, who has been my
most lovins counsel."
The Rev. Mr. Vittum said the trial must
be an exoneration of Mrs. Herron.. She
was innocent and persecuted all the way
through. His church, he said, was ready
to expel Herron without any more evi
dence, but evidence must be heard for
his wife's sake.
Dr. Herron sent av lengthy letter from
New York. His only, reference to his
former wife Is as the mother of his chil
dren, and he says that he does not lay
any blame ur>on her.
After Dr. Herron's letter had been
read a vote was ordered and a resolution
of expulsion was adopted.
J. P. Lyman of Grlnrell presented the
case against Dr. Herron on behalf of the
church committee. ' He read the letter
calling for the council, the invitation to
Dr. Herron to participate and defend and
Dr. Herron's ietter.of declination, in
which Dr. Herron said: "I am perfectly
satisfied that the hearing shall be ex
pane."
DES MOINES, la.. June 4.â Professor
George D. Herron, former professor of
applied Christianity in Iowa College at
Grlnnell. is no longer a Congre&atiorial-
Ist. He was tried by a council of min
isters and elders of the church, sitting at
Grinnell to-day, on a' charge 'of "conduct
unbecoming a Christian and a gentle
man." Thirteen churches were represent
ed. Evidence was introduced to show
cruel treatment of his "unusually loyal
and devoted wife," which finally resulted
in divorce proceedings and a legal sep
aration. A lengthy letter from Dr. Her
ron was presented in his defense.* At. Â¦the
close of its consideration the council de
cided that the charges were sustained
and voted unanimously to expel him from
the church.

DURING THE WAR
Details of Disaster to
British Arms at Vlak
rfbnteih;
This Followed by the Surren
der of Jamestown to
- the Boers.
X LONDON, June > 5.â Details received re
garding the fighting at Vlakfontein show
that it was cne of the most desperate en
gagements of the war. - General Dlckson's
column was I traversing the district and
was J establishing posts ' when it was at
tacked by 1200 Boers under Commandant
Kemp. 'The Boers were so close that fifty
British fell at the first volley.
Â¦ The yeomanry held the position, protect
ing the guns until they were nearly de
cimated and then finding it impossible to
save ; the J suns the artillerymen shoz the
gun horses to prevent the Boers moving
the guns. The column quickly recovered
from the shock of the unexpected attack,
the Dcrbyshires charged with â¢ bayonets
and - after a short, desperate light drove
off the Boers and recovered the guns. The
Derbyshires and yeomanry both lost very
heavily. - . â¢Â¦ â¢ .
It it. asserted that while the Boers had
temporary possession of the guns they
shot two artillerymen in cold blood for re
fusing to work them 'against their own
comrades. : Â»i
. The appointment of .General French,
who has- been recruiting his health in
Cape Town, to command the operations in
Cape i Colony, indicates that lx>rd Kitch
ener attaches considerable importance to
the invasion. The recrudescene of sueh
fighting brings further demands for the
sending -out of reinforcements.
The War Office to-night published the
following dispatch from Lord Kitchener,
dated Pretoria,' June 4:
Jamestown (Cape .Colony) surrendered to
Kreltzlnger's command on the morning of
June 2, after four hours' fighting. The town
guard and local volunteers were overpowered
before our pursuing columns could come up.
Our,- casualties were three killed and two
wonuded. The Boer loss is said to have been
greater./ The stores were looted, but the gar
rison was released.
Have placed General French in charge of the
operations In Cape Colony. Â¦Â¦.-.> .-
The surrender of Jamestown is regard
ed as a disagreeable incident, because it
has provided Commandant Kritzlnger
with a fresh supply of the sinews of war.
Lord Kitchener, in a dispatch from Pe
toria, dated June 4, says:
Dlckson's report ' (of the fighting' at Vlak
fontein, forty miles from Johannesburg, on
May 29,) Just received. On our side 1450 men
with seven gunB were enraged. The force- was
returning to camp' at Vlakfonteln when the
enemy, under cover of a veldt, flred. rushed the
rear guard, consisting of two guns of 'the
Twenty-eighth Battery and 330 men of the
Derbyshlres I and the yeomanry- They tempo
rarily captured the two guns. When the re
mainder of the force came Into action the
Boers were driven off, the guns recaptured and
the Boer position was occupied." Our casual
ties -were six officers and fifty-one men killed.
six officers and 115 men wounded and one officer
and seven men missing-. .One officer and four
men have since died of ! wounds. ' Forty-one
Boers were killed on the ground. -The further
Boer casualties are not known. Reinforce
ments are beins sent.

Both boats were stripped to racing trim.
The decks were cleared of everything
that could catch the wind. On board the
Erie even the lifeboats had been stowed
away between decks. The limited num
ber of spectators carried on each boat
were confined In the cabins and none
was allowed on the decks. Both racers
were made as light as possible." ' :
from the start the result was in doubt
until; within a few miles of the'.'nnish.
â¢The 1 race demonstrated that :the: boats
were evenly matched. Each -was sur
: prised at the speed- of the other.'- The
boats -made.- approximately twenty-three
miles an hour, r- It - was neck and" neck
irflin the 'starting, point until Just" about
/Falrport, where -the Erie encountered
\ shore water and 'fell three lengths behind
her. rivaL ".-. From . Fairport - to Ashtitbula
-she" made no perceptible gain, but finally
picked up and passedr her rival. Â¦ -Tfie
TaEhmoo sailed by spurts, .'getting. ahead
for awhile, then-falling back, while the
â¢ Erie maintained â¢. a ' steady speed. -
( â¢ When -'the .victorious craft â¢ entered the
Cleveland harbor; she was greeted with a
tremendous ovation. Hundreds- of 'people
crowded along the docks, wildly cheering.
The conditions under -which the race
was sailed were ideal. There was a fair
sky and a sea as calm as a mill pond.
The conditions were more favorable to the
Tashmoo, as she is a light-draft river
boat and would have been severely hand
icapped by wind and sea. The course was
lined from start to finish with excursion
boats of all kinds and great crowds as
sembled along the shore at many points.
The noisy departure of the racers at
Cleveland was duplicated at the finish.
Whistles tooted and people cheered both
victor and vanquished.
The Erie covered the distance in four
hours, fourteen minutes and nine seconds
passing the stake boat at Erie one minute
and thirty-eight second ahead of the
Tashmoo and beating the latter by forty
seconds elapsed time. It was pronounced
by old vessel men to be the prettiest race
ever witnessed. Aside" from winning the
speed championship of the Great Lakes,
the Erie won about $100,000 for those who
bet on her. -
Cleveland and Buffalo Transit Company,
and the Tashmoo,' Detroit's crack passen
ger boat, owned by the White Star Com
pany, was, in many respects, the most
noteworthy race ever sailed "on fresh
water. ' Â¦ . . ' 'Â¦ . '

2548. FIRST RACEâ Four furlongs; maiden
BY LOUIS HONIG.
THE books fared well at the Oak
land track yesterday, v second
choices, a few Â¦ favorites and a
good long shot by the name of
Guilder coming well within the
money. The race of the day was between
Jarretiere d'Or and Louwelsea, the fourth
event on the programme. '
.;If Louwelsca had been given a more
skillful ride in the fourth race over six
furlongs Jarretiere d'Or would not have
captured the'first money.^There were four
hcrses in the race and soon after ; they
got away Tomplon went out like a streak,
Jarretiere d'Or a couple of lengths be
hind. Then Bergen on Louwelsea moved
up \ and when ' thÂ© stretch was reached
Louwelsea was gaining rapidly and at the
paddock was a neck ahead. In a driving
finish Ruiz f on .Jarretiere d'Or '.took the
lead, again just before the stand was
reached and . won by ' a head. Yellow
stone's finish was sensational, coming up
like a flash of light from the paddock and
getting the show.
The Initial event on the card, four fur
longs :f or 2-year-olds,, was won by Stuart
on Lady Cairo, four lengths in advance of
You You,, who got the place, i Taking the
lead'soon after, the start Lady Carlo gal
loped in. Knockings, at 6 to 1 for. the
show, got that end of the money.
Guilder furnished the surprise In the
second, race. At 25 arid 30 to 1, with little
backing, and with Paul,- the 'most medio
cre of jockeys up, Guilder took the lead
early in the race and never lost it. Fauq
ette captured Â¦> the place and i Senator
Matts," the 9 to 5 favoritf . made the show.
Rixford was noised about the ring as a
gcod thing. Opening up i at 10 to ' 1 he
was backed down to 3^ to 1 before the
pencilera had hardly reached.' for the
rubbers. Rixford finished far down the
list. . ' â¢ .
Byron Rose. Guiterrez in the saddle,
Gibraltar, Ruiz astride, and Grafter, with
Hoar in the pilot box, got away on a fine
flying start in the six furlong race. Gib
raltar, the even money favorite, started
out to make the pace and led all the way
till Â¦ the - stretch, when Byron Rose went
out and won easily. Grafter was nowhere.
Hoar, on Good Hope, deserved ithe ap
plause he got after the fifth race, a six
furlorig event for 3-year-olds and up.
Var.tine got away . soon after the start
and took such a lead that It was general
ly thought the race was over. Good Hope
kept well back until the near turn, when
she went up on the bound. Then came a
fierce test between Good Hope and Van
tine for the wirs, which was undergone
by Gcod . Hope a nose ' ahead of Vantine,
Dangerous Maid, the favorite, took the
show. . . -. _ . Â¦ .. â¢ .
In the last race over a mile and seventy
yards Qulbo was four lengths be
hind Jim McCleevy in the lead on the
first turn, but inch by inch Bassinger took
Quibo up and when I the -stretch was
reached Quibovwon out with ease. Rio
Chico got the place, McCleevy getting the
show. Ruiz on Merops was left at the
post. Merops broke with the rest at the
start but} propped on * the second stride.
The start was a good one.

The Northman is the first steamer in
the new' , Chicago-Hamburg service ' to
cross the ocean, and her voyage has been
watched < with interest as a test of the
probable success of the undertaking. She
was preceded by the Northwestern, a bis
ter ship, but that vessel was detained by
a mishap, and lost the honor of beins the
ship to make the first voyage In the new
service. . â¢ .: . . :
The Northman, which. Is a steamer of
1496 tons * net, sailed from Chic-agro Apr.l
30, In command of . Captain Ross, with a
full cargo. She sailed from Montreal May
17, from Quebec on May 22, and from Syrt-"
ney, C. B., after coaling. .The scheme of
going through the canals was to give tha
vessel the maximum cargo to , . Buffalo,
there partially -unload; and after passing
through the canals reload at Montreal.

Shipping Intelligence.
Tuesday, 'June 4. â¢-
tftmr Geo \T Elder, Randall, (A hours ' from
Pc&Lland. via Astoria 45 hours. .
until last Saturday night, and not a sign
of the rest of the fleet was seen. The
Arracan is now so long out that 15 per
cent is being paid to reinsure her.
From the start the Cardiganshire did
â¢well and a week out was off Cape Marie,
Van Dieman's 4^and. The equator was
cio&sed a month out and then light winds
followed by calms were the rule. Off the
cuast It blew very hard from the north
west; and yesterday morning early the
rilot took charge and sailed her in.
When the fhip was off the Presidio
preparations were made to anchor her.
The starbcard anchor was let go and
when thirty-five fathoms of chain had
run out it parted. By this time the ship
had headed over for Arch Rock and the
quarantine steamer was alongside. The
pilot at once ordered the port anchor let
go. This was done, but while the chain
war flying through the hawse pipe the
corman broke and fouled everything. The
fhip was therefore without an anchor and
drilling down stern first on Alcatraz. The
captain of the Sternberg soon learned
what was the matter and at once went
full speed ahead. The tide was running
flood and the sails only being clewed up
tor-k the wind and both combined with the
weight of the ship were too much for the
Quarantine boat. For a time it looked
Bfl though the two vessels would bring up
on the rocks.
In the meantime the Golden Gate had
rtarted from Meg&s wharf with the cus
toms officers. When in mid channel Cap
tain Cushing noticed the predicament of
the Cardiganshire and at once rang up
the engine room for every ounce of steam
Â¦the engines would bear. Uncle Sam's
Lrat was equal to the occasion and going
alongside on the starboard bow passed a
hawser aboard. The Golden Gate then
wrrt ahead while the Sternberg remained
hard at work on the port quarter. Even
v.iih both steamers doing everything pos-
Fibie it was five minutes before the force
Â«;f th<- wind and tide could be overcome
arid then the Cardiganshire was in seven
ar.d a half fathoms of water and fifty
feet from the beach. When she was pulled
ciefcr the Golden Gate's hawser parted,
but by this time another anchor had been
pot ready and when it was let go the
thin held.
The whole affair reflects great credit
or. the officers and crews of the Golden
(Sale anc" George M. Sternberg. Had it not
beon for the assistance of these vessels the
f'adringanshire would have gone ashore.
The tug boat officers were notified as soon
as ihere was any sign of danger and the
rtflipf was on her wav to the scene about
rise time the Golden Gate began to speed.
The Relief would have been too late,
however, and all she could have done
would have b<=en to tow the ship off. The
owners of the Cardiganshire are thus
paved many thousands of dollars, as a
Ctoa eminent vessel cannot take any re
muneration for services rendered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 5. 1901.
THE British ship Cardiganshire had
a narrow escape from being
wrecked on Alcatraz Island yes
terday. Had it not been for the
revenue cutter Golden Gate and
the quarantine steamer George M. Stem
berg- she would have gone stern first on to
the rocks.
The Cardiganshire sailed from New
castle, X. S. W., on March 28 last with
2103 tons of coal for San Francisco. The
American ship Spartan sailed a week be
lore her, the British ship Toxteth eleven
days, the French bark Beaumanoir a
fortnight and the British ship Arracan
thirty-flve days ahead of the Cardigan
shire. Luck seemed to be with Captain
Stephens up to the time port was reached,
as his vessel came along with fair weather

cheap rates.

of labor over the industrial demands- of â¢ the <;Â¦ island
The crowding of so large a wage-earning popula

wealth or ambition, has naturally resulted in reducing
wages to a 'minimum. The report says: "No more

couid exist than* the fact that not a few planters, even

According to surveys and a census taken in 1899
under the direction of the, War Department, â¢ Porto/
Rico with its adjacent islands contains approximately
3606 square miles of land and 953,243 inhabitants; of
whom 203,792 live in cities or towns and 749.451 in the'
rural districts. The density of the population is 264
to the square mile, j The number of females is but
slightly in excess of the number of: males, which' is
regarded by the officials as proof that there has never
been much in the way of emigration from the. island.
Of the total population 31 per cent is under ten years
of age, a higher proportion than is found in any State
in the Union, while only 11.8 per cent is above forty
five years/ Deducting all who are too, young or too
weak through age or disease to work,- there remains
an effective working population of 601,271, and it is
estimated - that more than half . of ; them/ are wage
workers. â¢ .
FROM the Department of Labor at Washington
there has just been issued a bulletin giving an
account of labor conditions in Porto Rico by
Dr. Azel Ames. The report confirms the statements
recently made by Governor Allen concerning the
backward condition of the islanders, and particularly
of the working classes, but holds out a promise of
improvement even without that American immigra
tion which the Governor advocates as the only hope
for the development of the island. -

A New York expert has figured out that if the
Southern Pacific. Railway Company should use oil in
stead of coal for fuel it would save at present prices
$5,000,000 a year; but it may be that the calculator is
an oil boomer.
It is to be hoped that the Governor will set in
motion every lawful energy of the State government
to arrest and punish that band of murderers. True,
the scene of the crime is in a remote corner of the
State, but the whole commonwealth suffers from it,
and should applaud every effort made to secure its
adequate punishment.
The five dead men were probably petty thieves, but
they were morally better than the forty murderers
who are now known to have been their fellow citizens.
As between the two classes of criminals the good
name of California suffered less from the deeds of the
five thieves than from the wanton and savage crime
of the forty murderers.
Fo*many of the savage lynchings that disgrace this
country a sudden access of wild passion may be
pleaded as an excuse. These passions are roused by
the inhuman nature of the crime which they are. in
voked to punish. But the offenses of the five mur
dered men of Modoc, even if the charges against them
were true, were not of *a nature to arouse such pas
sion. The murderers were moved upon by a wanton
and criminal thirst for blood. The law provides ample
punishment for the crime of larceny^ and to have
meted it out to the accused would have had all the
admonitory and deterrent effect necessary for future
protection of the property of that community.
WHEN further examined the murder of five
men by a mob in Modoc County, four of
them already prisoners in legal custody, be
comes more revolting. There is no pretense that a
failure of justice was reasonably feared by the lynch
ers. A community that will turn out and murder an
old man and a boy of sixteen against whom a charge
of larceny was lodged can certainly be trusted to fur
nish a jury that would give them an orderly trial in
a court of law and convict them on almost any testi
mony. The crime of that mob may cost the State
dearly in reputation, life and money. The old man
had a squaw wife, and his children who were killed
with hi:n were half-breeds. His influence among the
Indians seeins to ha\e been considerable, and they
resent the lr.rrders. It is already feared that they
may put in action the Indian code, a life for a life,
and, if they do, reprisals will follow that will embroil
that part of the State in a race war of such magnitude
as the "parties to it can set going. This may draw in
the Federal and State authorities and end in some
thing like the lava bed war of twenty-five years ago.

FALSE PRETENSESâ Subscriber, Oak
land, Cal. In California the statute of
limitation in cases of .obtaining money or
goods under false pretenses is a bar to
prosecution, unless a complaint be filed
within a year, if the amount of the money
or property obtained was under the value
of $50; three years if in excess of $30. As
to the method and cost of arresting
a party guilty, of such an offense. If such
party escaped. Into, another county, you
would have to consult the District Attor
ney of the county In which the crime was
committed. The principal expense would
be the transportation of the party sent
for' the accused, and transportation for
that party and the accused to the p'ace
where the trial would be held. As you
do not give localities, it Is impossible to
give even an idea of the expense.
THE HYPHENâ H. S. G., City. The
tendency . of latter days is to avoid the
use of the hyphen as much as possible in

query, there is "Wine, maker, winemak

in meaning, but the last Is formed by com
bining the first two. Whether to use the
hyphen or not cannot be decided by rule.
It is for the most part a question of use,
which must be learned from observation
-or from the dictionary. So long as the
sense is not destroyed it is preferable not
to use a hyphen, and for that reason It
would be perfectly proper to use "Wine
maker."

From that statement it seems those -who feared Mr.
Carnegie would) cause the Scotch^universities to be
crowded with, more students than they can fake care
of, and would inflict humiliation! upon the aristocracy
of Scotland by providing free education for their
sons, may novv. cease their hysterics and grow calm.
They have not yet been so badly hurt as they, thought.
In fact,' they may even have a chance to 'show 'their
willingness to defray the cost of-the education of their
sons, for,'as it is known that in hisgifts.to libraries
in this country Mr. Carnegie has invariably required
that the community benefited shall contribute largely
to the library. he endows or for which he constructs
a building, it is quite -probable that when the full
terms' of the gift are j made known; it , will be found
that the donor has accompanied his gift with the stip
ulation that the Scotch themselves do' about as much
for their universities as he proposes to do.
' The Chronicle says: "It appears; that an understand
ing was come to. by those to whom Mr. Carnegie
has already sketched an outline 'of his scheme, that
no communication should be made regarding it'until
the matter had assumed definite; shape. This under
standing has been violated, and the unfortunate result
is that a very misleading, .because partial, account of
the scope of Mr.' Carnegie's gift has been published.
Mr. Carnegie has in -view a muchjtvider scheme of
benefiting Scotch education than that of making free
education to Scottish university students, and when
the full facts are published it will be recognized that
no harm whatever will be done to the extramural
schools."
CARNEGIE : AND THE SCOTCH.
ACCORDING to the London. Chronicle all the
splutter in Scotland . and elsewhere over the
terms of Carnegie's gift of millions ' to the
Scottish universities has been based upon a.miscon
ception due to the fact that the reports that have
been given out concerning the gift, were not author
ized and in some important respects are inaccurate.'*

desire to make their surroundings more
beautiful. That more is not accomplished,
or at least undertaken, is due to lack of
intelligent guidance: The gentle students

boon would be a collection of the sort in
each of our larger towns ! Given a score
of good paintings, as many; casts, a hun
dred autotypes and a few choice etchings
and engravings, free of access to rich and
poor alike â why, the stimulating influence
of such a place would be second only to
that -of 'the village library. Some, ' of
course, find such things meaningless, but
to others they, would be a constant joy.

unerringly to them. :
Forming an Art Museum.
No art circle is too small to stand
sponsor for a museum- of this kind. The
"art . gallery" may seem very visionary
and tar removed in the perspective, of
time, but there is no reason why a tenta
tive collection should not be inaugurated
at once. It may not overflow a single
portfolio in several seasons, but even
there, between the -pasteboard covers, it
is a nucleus and an incentive. If the club
is poor its little museum! may begin as a
mere pictorial adjunct to its library, con
sisting of "half-tones" j clipped from
magazines and pasted upon â¢ cardboard
or linen. Then will come photographs,
followed soon by the "Copley prints," il
lustrating the best of American art, and
the famous Braun autotypes of European
masterpieces. The Art Institute of Chi
cago has 18,000 of these, presented by gen
erous Dr. Pearsons; Kansas City has an
admirable selection and every art museum
in the country purchases them as its
means may- permit. They are far more
satisfactory than the usual painted copies
of great pictures. (Copies should, as a
rule, be sedulously avoided unless they
. have the approval . of an artist of stand
ing.) Autotypes are expensive, costing in
this country $4 each (large size, 515). A
small club will not buy many in a year,
but to select and purchase them, even one
at a time, is well worth . whileâ Indeed, ic
is the way to get the most good out of
them. . : - Â¦ ". Â¦ , Â¦ . "

. Art in Public Libraries.
Certain clubs in the West have been
farslghted enough to make friends with
their local , library : boards, and in the
building of new libraries have profited
greatly. All over our country these hand
some buildings are springing up, and
every one of them ahould be crowned with
a skylighted exhibition hall. This is easily
incorporated while the plans are matur
ing, but may be unattainable at any other
time. â¢ '- . Â¦"- " â¢;-<;
Before the roof is on the building the
proffers of donations will begin to come
n. It is well to have an art committee se
lected early in the <iay, from among those
best informed, which shall sit in Judgment
upon all works offered. If one or more of
its members come as experts from another
city the effect is all the better. Let it be
understood that their judgment is final
and impersonal, and a great deal of fric
tion may be avoided. :
It will be a work of years to fill the hall
with choice paintings and sculptures and'
it is a great advantage to move with de
liberation, but exhibits may be inaugurat
ed from the first. There is no need of
waiting for a collection of Claude Monets
or of Dagnan-Bouverets! Have a loan ex
hibition of family treasures, â¢ good and
bad. Really, it will be all the more in
structive if some are bad. Later invite the
local geniuses and : the teachers, of oil
painting to show their wares here side by
side. This will be instructive, too, and
there will be helpful study and compar
ison. The school children may be counted
upon to furnish one interesting show.
They will provide the interest, also. Then
"plcked-up" collections of old engravings,'
etchings, "types of beauty," reproductions
of favorite masterpieces, amateur photog
raphy, etc., may be devised with a little
ingenuity and a great deal of work. .
Exhibits of Contemporaneous Art.
All of these diversions lead up to the
thing most desiredâ exhibits of contempo
raneous paintings and sculptures. To ob
tain these in the smaller places is a prob
lem of importance, since all this fervid
study of art is Â» of little avail unless ac
companied by "laboratory practice" with
the real thing.' We came pretty near solv
ing the problem successfully in the exper
iment of 'the Central Art Association,
which undertook some years ago to send
out circulating exhibits among the smaller
cities of the West. The artists were sur
â¢prisingly accommodating and Xhe people
enthusiastic, but just when a sea
son's experience had demonstrated that a
caretaker to accompany the show was in
dispensable the hard times struck Â¦ the
country and the clubs, while still most
eager to' have the pictures, declined one 1
and all -to pay for the attendant. Some
day the art departments of the Federation
of Women's Clubs will .carry, their work
still further and accomplish , what was
then merely sketched. Backed by the-or
ganized strength . of â¢ the clubs they can
readily , set in motion a system . of inter- j
change of collections of good art. Offer-;
ing the hospitality of fireproof, well-light-,
ed galleries and the bait of an occasional;
sale, they will find the response of the
artists cheerful . and abundant. The suc
cess of such t an experiment .will depend
largely upon the intelligence of the per
son in charge, whose care it should be to
superintend everydetail of packing, un
packing and hanging, and who should; be
possessed of sufficient taste to 1 , arrange
and light the collection ',, properly. u; If- the
same individual could introduce the, work
to the public by means of bright -little
talks' on the ; paintings ; and their, authors
the value of these exhibits -would - be
greatly enhanced.': A man, or woman able
to do all these things well would; be worth

they can afford I to employ the best talent
ana . to command the finest Â¦ works ; of art.

cities, j I do not , recall a purchaser in
years from "down in the country,"
though Illinois and Wisconsin, Indiana
and Iowa are rich in beautiful and lux
urious homes. ' The opening up . of new
centers of art trade in the towns would
give a great impulse to production in the
studios. 'A widespread effort like that
made by the Chicago Art Association in
recent years would do a world of. good

Collections of Sculpture.
That these galleries which my fancy, is
building should ever . purchase original
works of sculpture is too great a fight for
a wary imagination, but with . plaster
casts as cheap as they are there- is no rea
son why" our halls should not be adorned
by 'some of the best things ever shaped
by the sculptor's 1 chisel. The, matchless
frieze of the Parthenon can be boueht for
$1 a foot. Venus de Milo and Hermes will
lend you their serene beauty at a nominal
price. This is. not the place for a list of
suitable casts, but the writer would â¢like;
to repeat here a suggestion offered in an -
articleof some months since:' "Why du
plicate all of the old casts in all of the
new collections? Would It not be better
to work on the planof the great -libraries
of Chicago and other cities,- where, aside
from the books In universal demand, each
has its specialty and is rich in its partic
ular field? Why, then, should not our art
clubs of nearly contiguous cities develop
special fields of research? While not neg
lecting the universities and while actively
promoting native art, they could bring to
gether historic collections worth traveling
miles to see. . .
Art and Public Monuments,
. From indoor sculpture the step to monu
mental art is a short one. j If the art ciuba
would use their influence to have all pub
lic decorations censored by experts they
would by this act alone justify their ex
istence.. The military monuments and
other works of alleged sculpture in most
of our smaller cities are inexpressibly bad.
To stem the tide of stock statuary which
Is spreading over our enthusiastic if mis
guided land were in itself a great con
tribution to artistic well-being. But the
clubs with their resourses of knowledge
and influence can not only eliminate the
meretricious, but will be impelled to ef
forts for. positive. improvements. *
Here in Chicago, with our polluted at
mosphere and dirty streets, the clubs
have had to- go-back of the beginning
even and preach cleanliness before adorn
ment, j The - Municipal E Art i League has -
spoken for clean streets and a clear sky
as a necessity before the setting up of
statuary and the . exhibition of , mural
paintings. In many smaller towns .these
particular . handicaps . of ours are not
known, but everywhere in the West at
least there is room for "landscape archi
tecture," for the planting of trees and
shrubs, for the reclaiming of vacant lots
and for the introduction of flower beds
and fountains. The women's clubs are
bound to be leaders in all of these good
works and above all should keep in touch
with professional authorities upon such
subjects. When the time is ripe â¢ for ac
tion they must not only know hdw to do,
but how to guide others.
* In the civic house-cleaning now in prog
ress in Chicago the women's clubs have
formed a league for promoting public sen
timent; women have offered their ser
vices as street inspectors; they have en
listed and even organized the school chil
dren in certain districts to clean up and
keep clean the streets and alleys; above
all, they are preaching everywhere the
doctrine of personal responsibility, the
greatest thing in life. They are planting
trees in neglected streets and filling yards
and window boxes with bloom where erst-,
while was only dirt and squalor. Later
they will make our new small parks de
lightful little oases in the arid desert of
a city. They will bank â¢ them with shrub
bery and sprinkle them with flowers,
while here and there will be scattered
fountains and beautiful statues; subjects
that will do -the tired eyes good, figures
of grace, and other sturdier forms sug
gesting the glorification of labor, cheer
ful, hopeful workers in -various Industries',
Memorials of Our History.
Here as well as the smaller cities
there need -be no ? hurry about erecting
statues to Dante 'and Shakespeare. They
are resting comfortably. Let us rather
make it\our first business -to set up me
morials to those whose lives are associ
ated with the neighborhood and who
have deserved well - of ' their fellow men.
.What â¢ our country ; lacks â¢ is associations,
a background of memories. Let, then, a
portion at least of our art have signifi
cance. Mark the footsteps of the explor
ers. Raise a memorial where the in
ventor has brooded into realization his
beneficent thought; where the author has
penned his helpful lines. On ,the court
houses of Illinois let . there be tablets to
tell us * "Here spoke Lincoln." -* There
should, be 'a record of the. spot, where
Grant took command of his regiment,
where our other great ; men were; born,
haVe lived and died. In these 'ways art
becomes woven into the very, life and his
tory of our people; the statue or bust is
beloved as the man, and -we grow culti
vated in the finer things : of life as 'one
takes possession of an inheritance. , Â¦ "
In all of this the . women's clubs are
destined to play a leading part. Men may
doi the actual labor, but it" Is the women
who will demand it, who will say .when
and how it Is to be done and who will see
to it that it is done. All this study of art
is not to be in vain." It is not an affecta
tion nor a veneer, but something which
our womankind fairly: love and assimilate
into their very beings. There is nothing
like it in any other nation under. the sun.

PAPERS ON CURRENT TOPICS
We are sincere in saying that if there exist griev
ances justifying the miners' denunciation of represen
tative government and their pessimistic and despair
ing outlook their fellow citizens will never put the'.r
warlike dispesition to the test. If they will prove
what they Â«i?sf.rt and carry the issue to the ballot-box
the American sense of justice and fair play will *ee
that they are not left in a minority as an excuse for
flying to arms. Â¦ .
The miners declare that they will use the ballot
when feasible to accomplish their purpose, and when
that means fails will seek its accomplishment with
weapons. Perhaps they do riot mean what their lan
guage implies. It is in danger of being taken to mean
either that some of their purposes cannot be secured
by the ballot and are to be accomplished only by
armed revolution, or that carrying those purposes to
the ballot-box and being outvoted they will attack
the majority with arms and violence, and gain by
slaughter that which they failed to gain ,by the fran
chise. . ,
The American people are not in the habit of believ
ing that under our form of government a grievance
can arise which requires a resort to arms for its cor
rection in a revolt against the law and those who ad
minister it.
In order to have a fair estimate put upon their
proposed action their countrymen should be informed
of the personality of the enemy and of the grievance
for which such an alarming remedy is proposed.
These miners say, formally, that they will arm
themselves and fight in deadly combat against the
enemy in a certain contingency, of which it is appar
ent they intend to be the sole judge.
It would have been well if the union had made a
plain statement of the aggressions of which.it speaks
end given the country a frank explanation of any
lawful purpose with which the courts or the military
have interfered. Such* interference with the lawful
rights or laudable purpose of one man, or any' body
of men, is not in accord with our system of govern
ment, and is the most serious offense against the
rights of person and property that ' any government
can commit. If it have been committed here the fact
should be known and be made plain.
This is followed by some denunciation of the courts
and the military, and expression of "the hope that
the' members of organized labor everywhere will re
frain from voluntary enlistment in any department of
the Federal or State military service." / â¢'.."
Perhaps what is needed to give them, a different
view is more active participation in government,
through their own representatives. With this view of
it we approve their decision insisting upon "local
unions selecting men from their own ranks" to fill
public offices. We believe that a better understanding
would follow the consorting in State Legislatures and
in Congress of actual laborers, skilled 01 1 unskilled,
with professional men. and others who are chosen to
membership in such bodies. The industrial operations
of a "great nation are of such a nature that interfer- 1
ence at one point may check the whole machinery.
Perhaps one reason why some of the'eherished propo
sitions made by the unions are resisted is because they
consider only one of the many interests involved.
And perhaps another reason is that many of their
propositions are not understood by others. . One tone
in the miners' resolutions may be regyded as hurtful
to their cause and inimical to a better, comprehension
of their demands. One of their resolutions says:
"We advise the toiler to be ever on the alert in de
fense of his rights, and educate himself to protect
those rights by a peaceful use of the ballot so long, as
the feasibility of such means will justify the end in
view. When not, let us be prepared to meet the
enemy with the weapons of his choice, and rather
spill every drop of life-giving fluid at the point of
the bayonet than submit further to. oppression on the
part of our aggressors." "
THE Western Federation of Miners, in session at
Denver, has "resolved to take part in politics as
an organization, and responded favorably"; to
such proposition coming, from other labor bodies.
Its resolutions denounce representative' government
and declare it to be a failure. As the Federal con
stitution distinctly formed and established this as" a^
representative government, this action by the miners'
indicates that they have despaired of the republic. '

The Supreme Court rendered a decision
yesterday which establishes a predecent
for the future treatment of State laws
which come in conflict with- the laws of
the United States.
Timothy Mahoney died several years
ago In California and left his property to
eleven nieces and nephews, eight of whom
resided outside of the State but In the
United States. All was clear sailing un
til the estate came up for distribu
tion when a demand was made for 5 per
cent of the entire amount as collateral in
heritance tax and 1.9 per cent more as a
property tax. The claim was allowed by
the Superior Court, acting on the State
collateral inheritance law as amended in
1897. This statute as amended provides
that the tax must be paid in the cases of
nephews and nieces who live outsldo of
the State.
The appeal stated that this law of dis
crimination between residents and non
residents was in violation of .the national
law, which declares an equality between
all residents of the country. This claim
was admitted by the Supreme Court, but
It -was held that to strike out the of
fending phrase would give a meaning to
the law directly opposite to the intent of
the legislators who framed it. In an an
alagous case In the Georgia laws it was
decided that a State law of such a nature
might remain, provided that conflicting
measures should be thrown out and also
providing that such elimination , should
not result in a statute in opposition to the
original law. Otherwise the law in ques
tion phall be determined utterly void. The
amended collateral inheritance law was
therefore held to be valid and the decision
of the lower court was affirmed.

Timothy Crowley, who resides at 345A

sion. July IS at 2:30 p. m. Mayor Phelan
will give a welcome address on behalf of
the city. Bishop Hamilton on behalf of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, and

The expenses of the convention will be about
$25,000. and this sum must be secured. All of it
will be immediately spent In our midst â none
of It fcr the entertainment of delegates, all of
whom pay their own expenses. No other or
panization is likely to bring anything like as
many people to California during the next five
years s.s the Epworth League. This movement
is deserving the support of our citizens. It is
not charity: it is simply business. These peo
ple will spend a million dollars In our midst.
5. While the railroad rates are the same as in
1S97. viz., $50 for the round trip from Chicago,
the stop-over privileges ere more liberal, and
will induce many thousands to come, Etnce the
rates are open to everybody, and are not lim
ited to leaguers.
4. The annexation of Hawaii and the Philip
pines and the opening up of trade on the Pacific
Ocean have attracted all eyes to California, and
pvtrybody desires to visit San Francisco.
2. The fame of the Christian Endeavor Con
vention was such as to make all young people
throughout the I'nited States desire to visit
California. .
3. f^inc*" 1S97 there have been three very pros
perous years, and more people are able to
travel now than ever before in the history of
our country.
1. The Epworth League is numerically very
Ftrcng, having a membership of over two and a
l:a!f millions of young people.
This appeal for financial aid on behalf of the
I tcrnanor.al Epworth League Convention is
r%x\ctif a business proposition. There is every
i ssr.n to believe that the attendance from east
.if the Rocky Mountains at this convention will
:>:eeed 29.C00. the number which came to the
t hrislian Endeavor Convention in 1897. Our
i\afcons for 'this conclusion are:
I. J. Truman, to whom has been en
trusted the task of raising funds for the
convention expenses, has issued the fol
lowing statement, which is being mailed
L; business men:
The District of Columbia will send sev
eral hundred Leaguers. From all over
the South there will be large delegations.
At Louisville. Kentucky, there is talk
cf making up a "Baptist train."
Ohio and Illinois will furnish excursion
ists by the hundreds. Three special. trains
for Illinois Leaguers are in sight already.
St. Louis will send iXW excursionists at
least. Six hundred are booked from Kan-
Fas City, and a special will be run from
Topeka.
New York Leaguers have three special
trains engaged now and more may be re
quired. New Jersey has one special train
made up and a start made on another.
Xew England will send a delegation 400
strong, to be known as the "Banner Ex
cursion."
The Pennsylvanians have engaged all
the accommodations of the Pleasanton.
Colonial and Plymouth hotels.
Iowa alone will have more than 1000
Leaguers. All the accommodations of
the Occidental Hotel have been engaged
for the Iowans.
Reports made to the general committee
In charge of the preparations for the In
ternational Epworth League Convention
pive the committee every reason to be-
Mcve that its estimate of an attendance
from east of the Rockies equal to that
of the Christian Endeavor Convention
will be proved to have been conservative.
Between 30.000 and 40,000 visitors from be
yond the Rockies now seem assured.
Governor Gage Consents to
Deliver an Address of
Welcome.
Attendance Bids Fair to
Exceed Earlier Ex
pectations.

NEW YORK. June 4.â The upward course of
prices received a decided check to-day. After
the strong opening In continuation of yester
day's strength the whole market, with a very
few exceptions, turned weak. There was a
pretty general rally in the afternoon under
the leadership of a few . strong stocks, but
before the close .there., were some ragged
breaks in prices again and the. closing was
decidedly irregular and unsettled, with only
a few stocks hear the top level. The. acute
weakness of Sugar was a determining influ
ence in the early dealings. Yesterday's rumor*
of an Increase in the dividend on this sio.-k
were pretty generally discredited this morn
ing, and there wafci besides an explicit de
nial of a statement put out yesterday that
litigation -with the company's principal com
petitor had been settled. The I'rinclpal selling
had been effected before the actual announce
ment of the unchanged dividend, and there was
some recovery later In the day in sympathy
with the general strength of the market. Tho
stock's extreme decline was 6*4. The ' fact
that the other coalers did not responu to the
early strength of Ontario and Western, on
the report of its punhaso of the old Delaware
and Hudson canal. In spite of reassuring
statements that thÂ» transaction was with tho
full knowledge and approval of tho Erlo
Railroad Company, waiÂ« considered rather om
inous. Reports of drouth in the Southwest
gava rlso to the cross PiiocuUUon usual at
this period of thÂ» year to. bull wheat and to
bear the grain carrying railroads. The eiTecta
of this were particularly munlfest In ft. Paul
and the Southwestern*. Tho decline In Union
Pacific reached JVi and tn St. Paul 2*Â«. Re
ports of a falling off In new order.* received
in the Iron trade, alÂ«iough actual consump
tion Is reported to be still running close to
producttcn, awakrnvd reminiscences of lust
year's collapse, In tl>Â«" steel securities. There
\va* besides very heavy Felling by profession
al oi-rrntors to take proJltn on yesterday's
rise, London Joining In the soiling and ro
verslnir Its position of yesterday. The Iden
tity of sellers wan tho Fubjoct of rnther tinx
loun surmise. The announcement of thn ciikhi
dividend relieved- the market of a disturbing
element and Its recovery srt In from that
time. Tho market's prlnclpnl movements
later turned on the various stories of wlde
rrschlriK adjustments ' In the' railroad world.
Allegations that the MIrfoutI PaclfiV was to
b* accorded an influential Interest in South
ern Pacific in return for relinquishing to tho
Pennsylvania tho Wabash, and Lake Erie
properties, and that- Union Pacific was to have
a voice In Atchison affairs, were factors In
the Ivjyliifr. Pennsylvania rose an "extreme. 3
poir.tF. Southern Paclnc 4*4 an1 the Wheeling
and Lake Erie stocks 2 to 4 points. Rock
Island rose an extreme 6V4. The movement
peemed to be bared on the belief in a be
lated admission . of the company to a share
In the advantages of the Northern Pacific
settlement. The rise in Ontario and Western
nn its canal acquisition reached 4Vt. -General
Electric advanced 13 points on reports of
heavy earnings. United States Express rose
Â»Va Des Molnes and Fort Dodge 3<4. Brooklyn
TTnlon Ga* 3% and Poorta and Eastern 3. The
Kries were again heavily bought -Just before
the .close. La."t prices were invariably be-
Jow the bost. the final reaction reaching a
point or over in some of the Important stocks.
Â¦ The money market was not an Influence in
the trading, as rates continued easy in spite
of a late recovery in sterling exchange to the
gold export point-

The past week has been, as a whole, very
favorable for all crops in California. The
week opened with cloudy, cool weather over
the preater portion of the tState. but closed
â¢ with several days of typical summer weather.
Temperatures extreedlng 95 degrees were re
ported at many points In the great valleys,
Â¦with light to brisk r.crth winds: fortunately
no severe norther prevailed. This warm weath
er has put the cereals iiito good condition, and
all grains are ripening rapidly. In some por- I
tfons" ct the State farmers expect to have the I
largest yield of wheat since 1893, barring
northers. The damage to hay that had been
cut by the rains of last week has not been so
great as expected. Wheat, oats, barley and
rye are all in good condition. In some dis
tricts grain is steadily slumping out, and will
yield heavily. Much hay has been already cut. j
and grain harvesting wi'l soon begin. Nearly i
all fruit crcj>s will be fair. _
Pasturage is Etlll good, and there appears
to be plenty of water for irrigating purposes.
Ditches ere running full in most places. Farm
ers are busy at nearly all points. Orchards
end vineyards generally throughout the State
are in first-class condKIon. Nearly all reports
received indicate a feeling cf satisfaction
among tiie farmers.
Sacramento Valley â Cool, cloudy weather pre
vailed during the first half of the week, but
was followed by higher temperature and north
erly winds. Conditions have been favorable
for all crops, and grain has matured rapidly,
in some sections it is reported that grain has
never been in better c-ndition at this date than
row. Haying is in r-rcgress, and is nearly
completed in some placet; the yield is said to 1
be excellent, and the damage by rain during
May is much less than anticipated. Green feed
is becoming scmewhat scarce In places, and
cattle are being driven to the mountain ranges.
.Citrus fruits are in good condition. Deciduous
fruits have ripened rapidly, and in many sec
ticns will yield good er->ps. Pears were slight-'
ly damaged by north winds.
"."cast and Bay Sectionsâ Conditions have been
very favorable for all crops during the week.
Warmer weather has caused a rapid growth
of grain and enabled the farmers to continue
hay-making. Later reports show that hay was
Â¦not so seriously damaged as estimated, and
there will probably be an average crop in all
Fections. Wheat and barley are in excellent
condition, pad large crops are expected. Cher
ries and other fruits have ripened splendidly.
The yield cf deciduous fruits will probably be
le*s than average, though in some places good
crops will be gathered. Citrus fruits are In
pood condition. Sug-ir beets and hops are
thriity. The yield of apples in the northern
part of the State will probably be below the
average.
San Joaquin Valley -The first part of the
ueek was cloudy and cool, with showers in all
sections, while the latter portion was clear
p.nd warm. The weather has been very favora-
Me for ell growing crops, and grain has filled
cicely. The damage to hay by the rains was
much less than was at first anticipated. Hay
ing continues in many sections, and the crop
will be large and of good quality. The wheat
end barley crops will be fully up to the aver
age. Grain harvesting has commenced' in a
few localities, but will not be general for about
Â« week. The warm dayfc in the latter part of
the week ripened the jrriin very rapidly. Decid
uous fruits are making .good growth. Vines
&re in t-plenfiid condition and making fine prog
ress. Green feed is abundant, and stock of all
kinds ere in excellent condition. Water Is
plentiful.
iSouthern Californiaâ The weather has been
generally cool and cloudy or foggy during most
of the week. Cut hay has cured very slowly,
and oranpe trees are showing the lack of sun-
Fhine. Other crops havo been benefited by pre
vailing conditions. Sugar beets are thrifty,
and will probably yield a large crop. Alfalfa
has made rapid growth. Grain is in fair con
dition and a pood crop will be harvested In
Feme sections. The d*:nace to hay by the re
cent rains was not as great as estimated.
l>fccl<SuouF fruits are looking well. Beans are
U}> and growing nicely.
L06 Angeles Summary â Favorable weather
for growing grain, but not for bay and beans,
although farmers think that the latter will
make a fair cn;p. as they are coming up better
than was expected. Lr.te Valendas are being
harvested; crop good. Irrigation water is
ct'Undar.t.
Hurcka Summary â Cool weather and deficien
cy of sunshine have retarded the growth of
vegrtatlon. Small fruit and berries will be
plentiful but Ute. Grwn feed is abundant.

The Weather and Crops.
* ;;
CHICAGO, June 4.â There was another ex
citing session with an extremely large volume
of business in the wheat pit. The remarkable
strength which" characterized the market yes
terday was not maintained, for a* pyrotechnlcal
advance in the price was followed by a de
cline which, In. the face of" general conditions,
was probably. ' quite as sensational, proving
that the July option still ia in the grasp of
manipulators. .'July wheat opened %@Â»4 to 1%
@l%c higher at 7S to 79 l ,$c, under conditions
strongly favoring the â¢ manipulators. There
were good Â¦ rains In the Â¦ West and -Northwest
and everything but wheat responded to this
Influence. Hardly recovered from their shock
of yesterday; the speculators were loth to be
lieve the showers" would depress the' -market
and, rushing in their ; buying orders in such
contusion that business could hardly be trans
acted, they ran the price up to 79%c within a
fev/ minutes after the opening. The anxious
shorts were. then fed with long lines, put out
by the commission houses which bid' up the
price yesterday and when the source of Â¦ the
supply became common knowledge the buyers
joined the ranks of the manipulators and be
gan selling. .Under the force of fresh reports
of general copious precipitation" In the | Da
kotas: Nebraska, Kansas and other drouth
stricken localities and the enormous offerings
by commission houses, the market reacted in
stantaneously, and within an hour July wheat
was selling at 75%c, the low price of the day.
Within this range , there was little oppor
tunity for even the most modest profit-taking
for any who bought after the high price at th3
opening, but when the minimum i figure \\vas
touched the manipulative element returned to
the buyers' side and the rally, which followed
carried the price to 77Vgc. At this, stage the
recent purchasers showed a disposition to take
profits and the price reacted, and at the close
was weak and 1@1'/8C lower at 76%c. ' .
The corn market .-was dull and heavy, with
very little interest taken in a speculative way.
July corn closed %@%c lower at 44' / i'g44?8C.
Oats" had a . downward tendency with the
other 1 cereals. July oats closed Vic lower at
2SV4C." -.-.-Â¦'Â¦ .
Provisions were quiet. July pork closed 2V4c
lower. Lard unchanged, and ribs â¢ a shade
lower. ' .. . ' . .
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Silver weaker. Exchange unchanged. Â¦
Wheat firmer on the spot and burr on call. \
Other grains dull at previous prices.
Hay and Feedstuff s steady and unchanged.
A r <? activity in Beans or Seeds.
New Potatoes firmer. Nczv Onions weaker. Vegetables plentiful.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs still in large supply.
Berries in good demand. Tree fruits coming in freely. .
Cherries continue to bring high prices.
Oranges firm. Lemons and Limes zceak : and plentiful.
Dried fruits, Raisins and Honey quiet.
Provisions in fair demand and steady.
Wool selling moderately. Notliing new in Hops.
Beef, Mutton and Pork about as before.

NSW YORK, Juno 4,âThc Commercial Ad
vertiser's Ixtndon financial cablegram fays:
Business on the Stock Exchange here' picked
up considerably to-day, but the chief activity
centered In the American department. A The
market opened up well, but the advance en
countered a Rtream of realizing sales â¢ which
flnnlly checked the rising tendency and damp
ened the bullish spirit. In the early trading
Ontario nnd Wcf>tÂ«rn wan the market favorite.
Later Interest was transferred to Reading
shores. Other American eliares, as a general
thlnp, hung pretty ciuse 1 to parity until the
close, when the list yielded slightly, t\ Union
Pacific being particularly dull. , -<"';.Â¦

nesses who were called to identify the
books of the St. Nichplas Hotel, from
which Knowlton is charged with em
bezzling nearly $70,000. After the books
had been identified the special prosecutor,
Meyer Jacobs, attorney for the hotel peo
ple,-made a statement from the stand in
which he told of a meeting he had had
with Knowlton in Watsonville and a con
versation in which Knowlton admitted he
had* taken the money. According to
JacobaF statement, Knowlton said he had
spent the money In wheat and stocks; that
he had nothing with which to make the
shortage good, and that there- was but
two things they could do with him â to
send him to an insane asylum or to send
him to the penitentiary. He had trans
ferred to others what property he had and
he said he could do nothing In the way of
making reparation. The examination will
go on again In a week. , ; -

SAN JOSE. June 4.â The fate of the
California Cured Fruit Association. thÂ»
big combine of prune men, will be settled
at annual meeting to be held to-morrow
in the Auditorium in this city.; While
there has been much criticism of the
association and President Bond's admin
istration, most of the growers realize that
without organization and co-operation tha
prune industry will irretrievably suffer.
This i will cause many to vote for such
plans as wilt continue the association ami
it is almost certain President Bond and
his directors will be re-elected. It Is no?
because they like or are pleased wlthj
Bond's policy that the action w}U be
taken, but because the growers fear the
opposition candidates and believe the lat
ter would make the same mistakes that
have occurred. .
The Packers' Company will evidently
dome, in for a scoring. President Bond and.
tho packers are at outs, and any attack
on ' the Â¦ methods of the packers . by him
will/ be seconded by the growers.
President Bond's annual report will be
the flrtt matter taken up. It will be ex
haustive and will give in detail the bust-,
nesa transacted by the association during
the j-ear, the -financial condition of thÂ»
corporation and other facts of interest to
the members. â¢ ,

Constable Parnell ef Mayfield sent word
that he had the man in custody.
On being locked up in the , branch jail
in the town hall Blake showed fight.

Â¦- . .
SACRAMENTO, June 4.â Assistant AN
torney General C. N. Post and -Deputy A,
A, Mocre Jr. will leave to-morrow for Mo
doc County in the interest of the prosecu
tion of the lynchera of Calvin Hall, his
three sons and' Daniel Yantis. The mis
sion of th* two attorneys is a delicate
one. They realize that they are likely to
encounter a, public sentiment not in sym
pathy with their object. The counties
have on previous occasions shown their
jealous regard for their own prerogatives
and their opposition to what they con
sider outside interference.? and it is more
than likely- from statements which have
emanated from Modoc County within the
past week that such a spirit will be en
countered there by the representatives of
the Attorney General's office. But JudgÂ«
Post is regarded by all who " know him
here as a tactful and courageous officer
and doubtless he will do nothing which
will arouse antagonism in Modoc County
against the State Bureau, while at thÂ«
same time he will not" be swerved from
his conception of Ms duty by any influ
ences whatever. .
It will be the aim of Judge Post and his
associate to ascertain the facts of the
situation In* Modoc County with respect
to the lynching; to become informed as to
what efforts are being made by the local
officials to bring the culprits to justice.
and to lend what aid they can in accom
plishing this result. It may be that their
efforts will be . directed to no greater
lengths than this; but .should It be neces
sary, to assert the authority of the State
they will doubtless prove equal to the
task.- - ' . - ' -
Â¦ Nothing can be told now, however. Â¦ as
to what the. two deputies of the Attorney
General may be called upon to do. They
hope for relations of perfect harmony
with the local authorities and believe that
they will be received in a friendly spirit
by the people and officials of' Modoc.
What their course will be will depend
largely upon conditions as they find them
upon their arrival on the ground. **Â¦Â¦ '

â¢DETROIT, June sixth annual
session of the Nationq.1 Manufacturers of
the United States was called tt> order this
morning' with an attendance of 250 busi

facturing 1 interests of the United States.
Mayor William SÂ» Maybury welcomed the
visitors to Detroit and President Theo-,
dore C. Search responded to the Mayor's
welcome. During the course, of his re
marks he said that the great energy man
ifest in the United States was due to the
public school system, by means of which
th,e children of America were taught to
think for themselves independently.
Following the president's address came
the appointment of committees and then
President Search read his annual , report.
Treasurer Scheiren reported the associa
tion to be in excellent condition. The ex
penditures during the past year were $85.
837, which were covered . by receipts. The
income from the- Shanghai warehouse,
which is maintained in China by the asso
ciation for the purpose of exhibiting. the
products of the members, was $13,274. â¢ and
the expenditures, $8400.. Treasurer Schei
ren reported that $3300 had been raised a.s
a fund to test the validity of the Russian
sugar tax imposed by Secretary Gage, of
which $200 has been expended. The total
membership of the association, as shown
by the receipts from membership fees, is
1450, scattered among thirty-four States.
Pennsylvania leads the States -in member
ship, with New York second and Ohio
third. '
The afternoon session was : devoted
largely to a discussion of the presidents
report. Preliminary 'to the discussion a
letter was read from James Deering of
Chicago, in which the writer advocated a
policy of closer foreign trade relations
and urged all members of the association
to work for the ratification by the United
States Senate of the French reciprocity
treaty. , 'â¢".-. â¢ . â¢: â¢
Barker of New York said he : had been
working with Deering to get the different
interests in the Senate to agree on the
French treaty, but that there were so
many imaginary objections that it was
impossible to unify the opposing inter-'
ests. â¢ By combined work, however, he
thought the treaty might be passed.. A
resolution was passed and referred to the
resolutions committee urging Congress to
adopt the French treaty.
Â¦ The committee on patents and patent
laws recommended- that an international
plan be established which would protect
the American manufacturer in foreign
markets." Â¦ , '

MANILA, June 4.â Gueverra, adjutant
to General Cailles, had a three hours' in
terview with . Aguinaldo to-day. He paid
that Cailles did not believe that Aguinal
do should have been captured and conse
quently issued a proclamation character
izing Aguinaldo's address to the Filipino
people as an American trick. Aguinaldo,
through Gueverra, advised Cailles to sur
render immediately. After this interview
General Wade and General Sumner in
loimed Gueverra. that Cailles must notify
them at Pagsanjan not later than next
Monday of his decision in the matter.
The American generals decline to guar
antee that Cailles would not be prose
cuted. â¢
General Trias, in company with Senor
Lucban. brother of the insurgent leader
still operating in Samar, has gone to Sa
mar Island and will attempt to induce
Lucban to surrender. =.,,
Some of the leaders of the Federal party
have prepared a resolution in which it is
declared that the party will disband
unless the United States Civil Commission
reappoints several Filipino judges who
have recently been removed from office.
Upon the advice of the more rational
members of the party, as well as certain
American authorities, the resolution was
not presented. The wisest of the Federal
leaders are convinced of the lack of wis
dom in forcing discord, especially at a
time when the administration at Wash
ington is about to confer general civil
government in the archipelago.
The commission to-morrow will resume
the organization of civil government in
the Provinces. A bill has been prepared
creating fourteen judicial -circuits. The
salaries of the circuit judges range from
$3500 to $5000 a year. Judge Bates and
Judge Ladd will probabdly be assigned to
the circuits of Iloilo and Cebu respec
tively.

Those killed were in the dav coach.
Surgeons and railroad officials were
quickly on the scene. Some of the injured
were taken to the hospitals and the dead
were brought to Atlanta. Soon after the
wrcok G. B. Dunton, an employe of the
Southern road, was arrested and charged
with disorderly conduct. The charge was
made only that Dunton might be ncld.
He was really arrested on susoicion of
having run the switch engine into the
passenger train. Dunton denied that he
had anything to do with the wreck, and
says he was not on the engine. The
Southern officials claim that he was seen
to get on the engine, and it is said further
that he had no business there, as he is a
yard conductor. Dunton has .several
pashes in his head which he admits re
ceiving in the wreck, but he maintains
that he was not on the engine.

Drugging With Coffee and Keeping
Sick All the Time.
A coffee drinker Is liable to a smash
almost any time and without much "warn-
ing. A New York man, C. W. Bedford,
1055 Lex. Ave., says that when he was In
apparently perfect health, weighing
about 1S5 pounds, with good appetite, he
suddenly had a severe attack of gastritis.
He lost his appetite and the doctor put
him on a rigid diet and gave him reme-
dies, but all to no purpose. He says:
"Kverybody I met had a. cure and I tried
a lot of 'them. I lost weight "until I
reached Hi pounds. I had those nasty
castric staggers.
"About the middle .of the summer,
when on Â¦ a vacation, a friend asked
whether I drank coffee or not. Â¦ Being
to^d that I did, he suggested that I quit
It and take Postum Food Coffee and
Grape-N'uts breakfast food. I laughed at
him and told him that I was throush
with rpecial articles of diet.
"One day the nerves had another bad
smash and I concluded to quit coffee and
see if that was really the cause of the
trouble.
"Next morning I had Postum for break-
fast and it was well made, and tasted
rood. I also had Grape-Nuts for break-
fart, and from that day my be-
Â£an to fade away.
"I am steadily gaining In flesh, con sleep
naturally, and can eat whatever I want.
What is the use of a man's drinking an
article like coffee that poisons him. and
causes such troubles as I have had, when ;
you can have a delicious Food Coffee like j
Postum that builds up instead of tearing
down," Health Is worth more than all the
coffee on earth. l&fc^^^ 1THE SAN FRANCISCOfCALL, WEDNESDAY,;; JUNE ;5, 1901;

One of the principal features of the day
was an address by Mrs. Isabella Charles

who traced the history '. of Â¦ the King's
reaoing of official reports and the nomi
nation of officers. The reports of the of
ficers showed that the King's Daughters
and Sons m the State are enjoying unpre
cedented prosperity and the membership
Is on the increase. Means of better col
lecting the regular monthly dues and more
thoroughly distributing the crosses which
are the adopted insignia of the order were
pointed out in the official reports.
In the afternoon the delegates at once
commenced the main business of the con
vention. All the circles of the State were
formed into one organization with the
same constitution and by-laws as the in
ternational body. This. It is thought,
will enable the State societies to accom
plish better results and render more sup

\ His Notes.
Mark B. Kerr.>spent a busy day on the
stand yesterday in the United States Cir
cuit Court explaining | to .Judge . Morrow
and Attorney Lindley "why he had been
testifying from a transcript of his original
notes instead of the original notes them
selves as to the trend, strike and dip of
certain veins in the Pennsylvania mine at
Grass Valley. - Mr. Lindley discovered
early, in the day in the trial of the Grass
Valley, mining suit that the transcript of
tha engineer's original r.otes contained de
ductions and' other^ matter not found In
the original notes, as made by him at the
time .of -.his scientific explorations. Mr'
Kerr admitted that the additions and In
terpolations of which Mr. Lindley com
plained did not appear in the original and
explained that he had made the transcript
Sf *ffi&& 1 SoT had put a 1Ittle mo?e
Â¦ Then Mr. Kerr was allowed to tell what
he knew about the Pennsylvania mine and
was pinned to his original notes whenever
he- desired. to refresh his memory. Mr

The Heins and Folger people raised an
alarm and Policeman Matthew Tierney
appeared upon the scene. He made a
thorough search of the Folger residence,
but failed to find Kelly. It was re
marked that the closet door was never
keot locked and Tierney went back there
and demanded that Kelly show himself.
Kelly did not respond and Tierney forced
-open the door, which led to Kelly's dis
covery.
Kelly appeared before Judge Cabanlss
yesterday and his case was continued till
to-morrow.
About daylight yesterday morning Kelly
climbed to tho roof of the house, 214 Union
street, occupied by Jacob Helns. He slid
down a light well till he reached a win
dow, which he opened. He was observed,
or rather his shadow was observed, by
Mrs. Heins and she pave the alarm.
Kelly fled from the Helns' house and
climbed to the roof, making his way to
the adjoining house, occupied by W. A.
Folper. He again slid down the light well
in that house, entered- a room and hid
himself in a closet, which he locked from
the inside.
Thomas Kelly, who was booked at the
City Prison early yesterday morning: on a
charge of burglary, makes the novel de
fense that he was pursued by enemies and
took refuge in the house where he was
captured. It is not the first time, so the
police say, that Kelly has offered a similar
deff-nse.

Manager. .
George C. Perkins is a candidate for re-*
election to the United States Senate, but
he desires it to be known throughout the
State.: that he will; make the' campaign
without the assistance of a manager. He
takes the position that he is the candidate

ton Green and James Brown, who handled

and unwittingly; produced a : remarkable
investigation, .will Â¦undertake the some
what / laborious. Â¦â¢ task . of ' convincing the
members of the, California Senate and As
sembly that Irving M. Scott ought to be
elected to the Senate. Initial steps in the
progress of this political enterprise were
taken at; the. last extra session of the
L !f ls J a * ur . e ' but before the wires could be
adjusted to place Mr. Scott in a leading
place, the^Republlcan caucus resolved to
support â¢ Thomas R: Bard. In his selec

many friends by Â¦ his manly course of
acquiescence in the caucus desire. Â¦
In Â» accepting the leadership of the or
