whole time was taken up by Senor Juan
Gualberto Gome^ and General Sanguilly,
who*rrtade long and Impassioned speeches,
the' former against the Platt amendment
and the latter in its favor.
Senor Gomez said In substance that tha
black blood In his veins made him opposed
to the Americans, intimating that their
treatment of his race stamped them as
unfriendly to the negro. . "I would rather
be under the sovereignty of Spain." he
exclaimed, "that under that of the United
States. The Platt amendment endangers
the Independence of Cuba." It means thd
predominance of ' American Influence. I
would rather die of grief or leave the
country should it be accepted.". : r
He admitted he was not particularly op
posed to sendine a commission to Wash
ington, but he said he believed the Platt
amendment should be rejected first.
General Sanguilly made a strong appeal
to the delegates to accept the amendment.'
He cited the reasons fie had already given
in a public letter in favor of such a course
and emphasized the fact that the amend
ment in no way endangered the Independ
ence of Cuba, but reajjy' provided guaran

Thrilling' Â¦? Facts in the Beport of
American Bible Society.
jjjj NEW. YORK. April 10.â The annual re
port of the American Bible Society rela
tive to the situation in China will contain
the following interesting statements from
Its - agent In China, the Rev. John R.
Hynes, p.' I>. : ""'..: *;
There was a deep and cunningly laid plot
under Imperial Â«anction to exlrpate , Chris
tianity, expel "all foreigners and destroy all
foreign interests. No one divined the full ex
tent of the Iniquity, which -was deliberately
contemplated. In all 1S3 Protestant mission
aries. Including 60 men, 73 women and 43
children, have been massacred, with the ex
ception of the massacres at Kuchoo, In Che
kians. In which eleven Dersons were killed,
and at Henzchoo, In Hunan, all of theÂ»*
dÂ°aths occurred In the northern provinces.
The question has .been raised at home aa to
whether the Boxer uprising was antt- foreign
or antl-mtaslonary in its character. No doubt j
exists in the mind of any well informed persor^
in China. The movement was undoubtedly
against foreigners, as such, and the erusada
was directed agaJnst everything foreign â
Christianity, of course. Included. Hsu Chlng
Cheng and Tuen Chang, two Ministers of th^
Foreign Office, would not transmit the awful
edict which reiterated the order to "painfuJljr
extirpate all foreigners," but changed it as to
read "protest all foreigners," and sent It fir
ing over the wires to the remotest provinces.
They~were sentenced to be 'cut In tw,o. Mis
sionaries were the class that benefited by this
act of heroism. The fact that every mission

provinces would indicate that the crusade wu

In the provinces of Chill and Shansl every

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, K.
W., WASHINGTON, April 10.â Not until
to-day was the administration willing to
admit that the Cuban constitutional con
vention had fallen far short of the War
Department's expectations and rejected
the Platt amendments defining the rela
tions between this Government and Cuba.
This news has been reluctantly confirmed,
but the technical explanation is made
that it does not mean a flat rejection, in
asmuch as the constitutional convention
may at some future time reconsider its
action.
The talk now Is all about the probable
result of the visit to the President of the
commission the convention is to appoint.
In this respect the administration is back
to the point where It started on the Cu
ban matter at the time of the r adoption
of the Platt amendment. Then advices
from other sources than those at ,the com
mand of General Wood suggested that It
would be a good way out of the" difficulty
to have a commission come to Washing
ton and talk with the President before at
tempting to apply Albany methods to
Cubans and "jamming 1 , 1^ the "relations
through. . ... ;
President and Commission. .'
The. commission, when it comes to
Washington, will meet with personally a
.warm '.xeception., from President *McKin-
ley.'"It- is believ.ed by the Cabinet that,
a President' who in three weeks talked
over to his side a solidly hostile" Senate
and House can in seven months interven
ing before Congress assembles convince
a small party of Cuban gentlemen of the
error of their views.''' . â¢ .-
It is not likely, however, that the Cuban
emissaries will induce the President to
materially modify the demands which
Congress has voted shall be made. If the
Cubans are expecting the President, with
out the consent of Congress, to consent
to any material modification of the Platt
amendment . they are mistaken. The
President takes the position that he has
nothing to do but to see that tho wishes
of Congress are carried out in this mat
ter, and he cannot make any concessions
unless Congress- authorizes him. to do so.
Hence, in their negotiations with the
President, Cubans '"are likely to find them
selves â¢ up against a stone wall. All the
President can say -will be: "Gentlemen,
these relations are the work of Congress.
The President has no power to modify,
annul or ignore an act of .CongTess. The
President Is'.wHling to discuss the matter
with you and "endeavor to convince you
that you are mistaken in supposing .that
this act of Congress abridges" the rights
and privileges of Cuba as a nation. He
is willing to^undertake to show you that
what the United States asks Cuba to ac
cept Is for the peace, prosperity and-hap
piness of the island. If you would like to
talk on those lines we are willing to go
ahead and have a discussion."
Little Can Bs Accomplished.
But what Is the alternative, suppose the
Cubans should tell the President that they
are only authorized to. demand modifica
tions in the, matter of the right of the
United States to intervene, regulate debt,
supervise sanitation and maintain a cbal
in? station?
These, are the questions that are, now
being discussed. At the War Department
and in administration circles the impres
sion is given forth that in that event no
possible good ' from a Cuban standpoint
could be accomplished." If. the commis
sion, it is said, does not- come here willing
to be convinced of the justice of the posi
tion taken by Congress it had better stay
at home. The present feeling is that the
constitutional convention of /Cuba ought
to bo dissolved' and a Â¦call issued for a
new convention empowered to deal with
the question. No Immediate steps aro con
templated locking to a dissolution of the
convention, and. of course, such a step
at this time would only tend to Increase
the friction prevalent among Cuban poll
ticians. . : Â¦.
Disapproval of Wood's Policy.
The sending of a commission to "Wash
ington ;is regarded at the War Depart
ment as -a tacit disapproval by 'the con
vention of the policy and methods of*Gen
eral Wood. .\ It shows that the convention
is dissatisfied with the treatments has
received from the. Governor General, and,
without further discussing the views of
the United States with that official; 'it
proposes to go â¢. over his head and come
direct. to the President of the "Â¦ United
States^for information as to the attitude
of the American Government. Officially
there is no disposition on the part of the
President or Secretary "Wood ; to criticize
General Wood on the course he has pur
sued. It' was stated at the *,War Depart
ment that General Wood's policy had the"
full 'sanctibri "of* the President. ; .: It is
known, however, , that tile' administration
had ;. hoped Â¦ that the- question of relations
would be settled in Havana and not in

Dewet Reported to Be Almost Demented v and It Is

CAPE TOWX, April 10.â It is understood here that although General Dewe't
In his recent interview with General Botha refused to surrender,, General Botha,
regarding him as irresponsible, undertakes to negotiate in behalf of the entire
Boer forces. The British authorities here consider that If General Botha sur
renders Dewet's following can be easily taken. As explained here, this action
was determined In part by General Botha's discovery at a recent meeting that
General Dewet's intellect had weakened, that his influence with his followers was
diminishing and that a continuance of the campaign. In view of General Dewet's
irresponsibility, rested with General Botha alcne. ,--, v

EL PASO, Tex., April 10.â Mrs James Milliken, a prominent woman of this
city, whose residence is in theÂ«most fashionable neighborhood, committed suicide
shortly after noon to-day by sending a bullet through her brain. â¢ Mrs. Milliken
â¢was alone In the apartment when the tragedy occurred and fired three shots, only
the last taking effect, causing a ghastly wound and instant death. Policemen
and neighbors who investigated found her lying across the bed dead. It is be
lieved the woman had been driven insane by family troubles. Her husband
a few years ELgro was a banker and wealthy cattleman of "Weatherford. Tex. He
shot and killed his business partner and the subsequent trial caused his financial
ruin. He came here, engaged in mining and succeeded, but had been in Mexico
several years and the wife believed herself deserted. Â¦ Â¦
A second suicide occurred, this afternoon when Mrs. John B. Fitch swallowed
carbolic acid and died in great agony. She was only 23 years old and had quar

PARIS, April 10.â The Important festivities attending President Loubefs
.visit to the Riviera were brought to a climax to-day In the double naval
'demonstration at Villefranche and Toulon. Both proved splendid spec
tacles. The profuse decorations at Toulon, the flotilla of pleasure boats
flitting about the harbor, the gayly dressed warships lying in the road
stead, and the animation of the Immense crowds of strangers jostling one another
In the streets and along the wharves imparted a color and picturesqueness to the
scene which outvied the situation at Villefranche. The French people, however,
4 derived as much pleasure from the incidents at Villefranche as from the meet
1 Ing of M. Loubet and the Duke of Genoa at Toulon.
"The Russian squadron," says Le Journal des Debats. "saluted the President
on his departure for Toulon, so that Russia will be associated as completely as
could be desired with the fetes on the Riviera. Those who have spoken about
the coolness of two friendly and allied countries' are now compelled to admit that
they took the desire for the reality. Those who contended that Russia wished to
man}fest hostility toward the Franco-Italian rapprochement now have proof to
the contrary in the fact that the Russians came to salute the President at the
very moment when the fetes at Toulon, sealing this rapprochement, were about to
take place."
M. Loubet ful!y appreciates the value of the French set word "ally" in con
nection with the relations of France to Russia, and he again took an oppor
tunity to pronounce It on board the Alexander II this morning. When accepting
tea from Admiral Birileff he said: ' .
"I am very much pleased that his Majesty the Emperor has sent a squadron
to salute the President of the French republic. I am very grateful for this mark
of* respect, and I raise ray glass to -the health of their Majesties the Emperor
and Empress, and to the friendly and allied Russian nation and to the prosperity
of the Hussion army."
Admiral Birileff suitably responded, toasting "The President of the French
repbulle. the prosperity of La Belle France, my secend Fatherland, and the glory
of the French army and navy."
The ceremony decorating Admiral Birileff with* the cress. of the Legion of
Honor was performed 5n the presence of the whole crew. M. Loubet then em
braced the admiral and expressed regret that the previously fixed hour fcr his ar
rival at Toulon prevented him making a detailed inspection of the Russian flag
ship.
All the officers of the flagship were presented to M. Loubet,. who shook hands
with them all. The Alexander II was the first to fire a parting salute as the St.
Louis steamed out of the bay and the crews manned the Russian warships when
the St. Louis passed, shouting seven times "Vive la Republique," or raising
seven hurrahs. Simultaneously trumpets blared and there was a great beating
of drums. After M. Loubefs departure Admiral Birileff entertained the local
officials on board the Alexander II. ' . x
The general programme at Toulon was carried^out without a hitch. The Duke
of Genoa and the Italian officers ayi sailors met with a flattering welcome, the
French seamen fraternizing with the Italians on shore. Every desire was shown
on both sides to cultivate a mutual good feeling. Extracts from the Italian
press, evincing satisfaction over the events at Toulon and expressing a hope that
these will result in drawing the two countries closer together, are extensively re
produced in and Indorsed by the French press to-day.
At the banquet at Toulon this evening In honor of the Duke of Genoa, Presi
dent Loubet proposed a joint toast to the King and Queen of Italy, former Queen
Margherita, the Duke of Genoa, the royal family of Italy, the Italian nation and
the Italian r.avy. The Duke of Genoa rplled, toasting the French President, the
French army, the French navy and the French nation. " M. Loubet then proposed
ICIng Alfonso XIII, the Queen Regent, the Spanish navy and the Spanish nation.
The President's third toast was introduced as follows: *
"Will the officers of the navy of his Majesty the Emperor of Russia," whose
flag ha.s been acclaimed here amid never-to-be-forgotten festivities, and will the
foreign officers deputed to come to Toulon who have been pleased to. sit at this
table Ii*pldÂ«~iheir--Freacji Â«omra^des^P.ermiLjne^a.assocIai^i^eÂ«*^H-Â«-toa^.-which.
I propose to the officers and crews%)f our r.avy? The same spirit of honor,' the
same habit of discipline and the same passion for danger have established a no
ble brotherhood among 1 the navies of all nations. It is only just to unite them In
one and the same tribute for the examples of solidarity and abnegation which
they give to humanity."

REMOVES STAIN OF SIEGE.
Naval Officials Believe That Captain
Hall Has Been Exonerated.
CALL BUREAU, ; 1406 G STREET, N.
W., "WASHINGTON, April 10.â Captain
Newt T. Hall, United States Marine
Corps, has been acquitted of the charge
of cowardice during the siege of the le
gations In Peking, by the court of Inquiry
which has been making an investigation
at Cavite.. '
This Is .the belief t of the Navy Depart
ment based upon a dispatch received from
Rear Admiral Remey, commander in chief
of the Asiatic station. Admiral Remey in
cluded Captain Hall in the list of changes
made by. him on the Asiatic . station, '.an
nouncing?'.that he had been transferred
from Cavite station to the Newark, which
is^underf orders to return to New. York.
Offlcais of the department point outthat
had the court rendered, a verdict against
Captain. Hall, lie would have been tried, by
court-martial Â¦ on" the - Asiatic station- in
order: that -/witnesses "might be summoned
without "inconvenience. Sincere gratifica
tion isfelt in naval circles at the outcome
of : the ' investigation , not alone because of
the vindication of ' Captain Hall, : but be
cause the finding of the court removes : a
stain from the American guard at Peking,
which received international attention.
Captain Hall abandoned the- wall which
was part of the defenses of the Â¦ legations
on the theory that it was untenable, and
he did not propose to expose his men.
Captain Myer, who commanded the ma
rine guard, agreed with Captain Hall as
to the untenability, of the position, but
deemed it advisable to hold it as long
as possible. ; In naval circles the belief
prevails that a "pettlcc-jat row," In which
the wife of one of the American officials
was Involved, was responsible for the
charge made against Captain Hall.

Manchurian Question.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 10.â The Rus

which it first discussed the Government's

It now declares that the* joy with ..which

to sign the Manchurian agreement has
merely postponed the signing of a new un
derstanding with China, since the conven
tion would be advantageous to China.

CHICAGO, April 10. â Improvement of
the Catholic educational system and plans
for unifying the educational work of the
church and raising It to a level in effec

institutions for hlcher learning were dis
cussed to-day at the third annual con
vention of representatives of Catholic col
leges, which opened here to-day.
The convention will continue In session
three days and durlnjc that time many
important papers will be read and dis
cussed by leading church educators. Rep
resentatives were present at to-day's
meeting from nearly every Catholic col
lege and university of prominence in the
United States and Canada.
The convention began with the celebra
tion of mass by Father French of Notre
Dame College of St. James Church. The
active business of the convention was be
gun by the Right Rev. Monsignor Conaty.
D. D., rector of the Catholic University
at Washington and president of the asso
ciation, who called the convention to or
der and delivered his annual address. Ha
took for his subject the "Catholic Col
lege In the Twentieth Century."
"Unification of education under State
control," said he, "has established a
mighty machine of secularized instruc
tion which threatens to destroy all pri
vate efforts either on the part of in
dividuals or the church. It is Important
to meet unification by unification, so to
strengthen the Catholic educational sys
tem that it may defend Itself against all
attacks and save the religious instruction
of its people from the dangers of non-re
ligious instruction. It is important to
realize the meaning of the facts which
face us and which our educators must
meet. < V -
"Among these facts must be recognized
â first, the State school system with ita
rapidly increasing high school and even,
college development; second, the tendency
to do away with the college by uniting
the higher school to the university: third,
the establishment of educational institu
tions of all sorts, endowed by the private
munificence of non-Catholics and attract
ing Catholic students because these

SUISUN. April 10.â One of the most in
teresting social* events which has ever
taken place in Sulsun was the opening
of the Armijo Club rooms this evening.
There were many visitors from the sur
rounding towns, and the elegant new
quarters of the club were crowded to
their utmost capacity. The rooms are
large and spacious and were beautifully
decorated with potted plants, palms and
flowers. The opening ceremonies con
sisted of orchestral music by San Fran
c'sco musicians, selections by local sing
ers, recitations and other exercises of a
literary character.
The Armijo Club was organized on
April 27, 1900, and after a vain endeavor
to induce local capitalists to erect a
building for its use, Some of the leading
f pirlts conceived the idea of organizing
ft stock company. The company was or
ganized and in a short time enough stock
was subscribed to insure the success of
the undertaking. A suitable location was
procured at a cost of ,$800 and the con
tract Immediately let for a $5000 build
ing. The structure is of the Spanish mis
sion style of architecture, und Is one of
the most Imposing and substantial in the
ccunty. It was recently completed and
has been furnished by the club at a cost
of about $2000. A library of more than
1000 volumes has been obtained and every
comfort and convenience has been sup
plied. No rural social \ club in California
has better headquarters than the Armijo
Club. The club begins with a member
ship of over ninety.

here to-night for the purpose of taking
necessary action toward Inducing the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company to

was appointed to ascertain what the road
would require in the way of terminal

A resolution was passed that the com

ment of the committee and that the meet
ing was unanimously In favor of offering
every inducement to the Southern Pa

NEW YORK. An it 10.â The Evening
Post says: It becamt known to-day that
a special meeting of the directors of the
Chicago and Northwestern Railway had
treen called for April 15 in this city and
that the Omaha directors will meet on the
6anie day.
Wall street guessed that this meeting
meant an increase i:i the Northwestern's
common share dividend, which Is now ii
per cent, and It was also suggested that
a revaluation of the company's holdings
cf Omaha shares, acquired in 1SS2, would
be made in connection with the dividend
action, or in furtherance of some other
plans. No official corroboration of these
reports could be obtained, however.
In some quarters it was believed likely
that the closing of 'the Burlington deal
on behalf of the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific railroads might have
been the direct reason for the special
meeting of the Northwestern directors.
The extension of the direct Interests and
Influence of the North Pacific roads into
territory they have never occupied before
and into direct competition with the
Northwestern has aroused the latter com
pany's directors and there is a possibility
that they may propose retaliatory meas
ures.

UTAH ANXIOUS
FOR NEW RAILS
PARIS, April 10.â Le Siecle, the leading
Bn*yfusite organ in France, and the most
persistent champion of Great Britain in
the Transvaal, to-day announces its fail
ure and sale at auction. M. Yves Guyot,
the editor, published a long review of the
paper's career, in which he recalls the
fact that Le Siecle first published the in
dictment against Dreyfus, which up to
that time was a secret. He admits the
policy of the paper failed to nnd sufficient
readers to make it pay.
"France," he says, "is nqw oscillating
between the Clerical and .the Socialist par
ties' programme. Le Siecle was support
ing the policy of the liberal democracy,
free from clericalism and socialism, which
France needs to spare her from future
upheavals. Le Selcle has not succeeded
in fathering enough patronage to enable
it to attain this result."
The explanation of the collapse of Le
Siecle is undoubtedly that the French peo
ple are heartily sick of the Dreyfus af
fair, and, new that Dreyfus is free, ap
prove the policy of M. "Waldeck-Rousseau
in allowing the matter to sink into ob
livion. The large circulation which Le
Siecle enjoyed up to the time of the
Rennes trial dwindled .rapidly away when
the verdict was followed by Dreyfus' re
lease, and the attempt to keep ; the agita
tion alive by unceasing demands for. the
punishment of, General Mercler and oth
ers responsible for the conviction of Drey
fus failed to enlist new sympathizers.
The unpopularity of Ue Siecle increased
when it daily published unstinted Â¦ praise
of Great Britain and denunciation of the
Boers, until it became regarded as the
mouthpiece of Joseph Chamberlain, and
to-day s'anouncement did not come as a
surprise.

KANSAS CITY, April 10.â Edward King,
an American, formerly a bnakeman on the
Mexican Central Railway, left to-day for
the City of Mexico for trial on April 15,
having been on parole. . Like fifty-three
other Americans now in jail 'in the City of
Mexico, King is a victim of the law that
calls for the arrest of the entire crew of
any train in case a Mexican is killed In a
wreck. Since November 13 last he has
been in the stockade. He obtained a
parole, and coming to the United States
laid his case before Secretary Hay at
Washington. Secretary Hay, he says, ad
vised him to honor his parole, go back and
wait for his trial. King's ca.se had al
ready been postponed several times and he
fears it will not come to trial on the date
set. If he secures no trial. Secretary Hay
promised, he said, to take action In his be
half. - Â¦â¢
"I am afraid they will treat me more
severely than the others when I get
back," said King. "If I get no help I will
starve to death. Our fare is tortillas, a
sort of corncake, beans and coffee. For
over two months I lived on it. As far
as that goes, we in the City of Mexico are
not so badly off as fifteen poor fellows in

north of there. They have been working
underground four years and have never

CHICAGO. April 10.â Armour Institute
in this city, which owes its existence to
the late Philip D. Armour, will to-morrow
receive an addition, to its endowment of
$1,000,000, the money coming from Mrs. P.
D. Armour and J. Ogden Armour, the
widow and son of its founder.
The announcement of the proposed gift
â¢was a surprise even to the officials of the
Institution. It is expected that the money
Â¦will be used to extend the scope of the
institution in electrical and chemical engi
neering. The Institute is now in a very
prosperous condition, having an endow
ment of $2,'3OO/KK), all of which .was given
by tha late /Mr^ Armour. A part oX/the
increased endowment will be used to ex
t<n<1 the. facilities of the institute. It being
difficult for It at' the present to accom
cicriate all the students . desiring admls-
Slrm.
An added interest attaches to the. dona
tion from the fact that P- D/ Armour, at
his death, failed to inake any provision
in his v.ill for the Â¦ school of technology,
which he founded and which had gained
a reputation that vied with that of any
nthcr school of its character in the United
tPtates. There was general surprise mani
fested At the time of the probate of Mr.
Armour's will that the institution which
hoTf. his name and which had been con
sidered by his friends as one of his hob
bies had been practically Ignored. It was
asserted at the time that Mr. Armour,
roiifident that his family would regard
the school as a sacred trust, had deter
mined to leave its future in their hands
without any hindrance, and it was said
that the institute would not be allowed
to puffer and deteriorate by his family.
The truth of this was demonstrated to-
Oay.
The donation will not in any way re
tard the negotiations losing to the affil
iation of the institute wHi the University
of Chicago. It is understood that J. Og
den Armour is to make the institute the
greatest of its character in mechanical
engineering in the world. The money will
not. however, be devoted to that branch
alone. The civil engineering course par
ticularly will be augmented.

desk room, said that Forst had lost more
than $325,000 in stock dealings, but that
his credit was high on the exchange. He
added that there was no need for him to
kill himself, for he had a deal on hand
that might have netted him a lot 5 of
money. Forst is said to have cleared
much money on the Letter wheat- deal
some years aro. and at the time of the
Flower Brooklyn Rapid Transit deal he
cleared $100,000. In some quarters there
was an impression that Forst was worth
at least half a million. . ; . â¢Â¦ Â¦..'..

HARTFORD, Conn.,' April 10.â Action
was begun in the "United State3 Circuit
Court here to-day by Mrs.' Helen Potts
Hall j of New York for the recovery of
her alleged share in the millions of the
late George F. Gilman of Bridgeport. Mrs.
Hall declares that she is the adopted
daughter of Gilman and brings her ac
tion through her brother, Frank G. Potts,
against the Bridgeport Trust Company aa
administrator of the Gilman estate and
against George W. Smith of Bridgeport as
ireceiver. : . .
The bill of complaint declares that Gil
man - was engagred in the tea business in
copartnership with George H. Hartford,
and that they had about 209 stores in the
United States. . This part of the complaint
is interesting because it has been under
stood that the Bridgeport Trust Company,
as administrator, takes the position that
Mr. Hartford ,was manager only and not
a part owner in the tea business. .
After estimating the value of the estate
at more than $1,500,000, the complainant
says the property came into Mrs. Hall's
possession at the time' of Gilman's death
and- there remained until she was . forci
bly ousted by the defendants. For sev
eral years prior to Gilman's death, con
tinues the complaint, he, having conceived
a- strong personal regard for Mrs. Hall,
adopted her as his daughter and she be
came a member of his household, render
ing to him the obedience of a natural
daughter. â¢ â¢
On or about November 1, 1900, It is al
leged, Gilman entered into an agreement
with Mrs. Hall, that if she would continue
to Jive with him as a daughter until his
death she would then be entitled to all
his property, . both real and personal, as
fully, and to. the same extent as if she
were his natural daughter. The complairt
ajit claims that she has fulfilled her part
of the agreement., She states further that
none, of the relatives lived on intimate
terms with Gilman, but, on the contrary,
they had for many, years been estranged
from him and^eome were hostile to him,
and that Gilman failed to make a will and
died intestate. . . .
The complainant asks for a writ of In
junction perpetually enjoining the Bridge
port Trust Company, as administrator of
the estate, from interfering with the busi
ness conducted by the Great American
Tea Company; that the Bridgeport Trust
Company. deliver to the complainant such
assets as remains in its hands in. like
manner as if she were the sole heir and j
next of : kin of t.hÂ« deceased. -
â¢ A preliminary injunction is also asked
for restraining the company from further
interference with the tea company dur
ing the pendency of this action. A writ
of subpena directed to the trust company
commanding It to appear in court and an
swer to the complaint is Â¦ likewise asked
for. The complainant further asks that
George W. Smith, th^ receiver, who claims
to have an interest' in the estate, be en
joined from maintaining the same. â¢ The
writ of subpena is made returnable to the
Circuit Court the first Monday of May.

IT IS IMPORTANT.
To Knijw "What You Are Taking
When Using Catarrh Medicines.
Catarrh Is the short route to consump-
tion and the importance of early and Judi-
cious treatment of catarrh, whether locat-
ed in the head, throat or bronchial tube.-..
cannot be too strongly emphasized.
The list of catarrh cures is as long as
the moral law and the forma in which
I they are administered, numerous and cou-
1 fusing, from sprays, Inhalers, washes.
! ointments, and salves to powders, liquid*
Â¦ and tablets. â¢
The tablet form Is undoubtedly the moat
. convenient and most effective, but with
nearly all advertised catarrh remedies it
is almost entirely a matter of guesswork
as to what you are taking Into your sys-
tem, as the proprietors, while making all
sorts of claims as to what their medicines
will do, always keep it a close secret as to
what they are.
The success and popularity of the new
catarrh cure, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets. Is
largely because It not only cures catarrh
but because catarrh sufferers who use
these tablets know what they are taking
into their systems. Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets being composed of Eucalyptol, Hy-
drastin, Guaicol and similar valuable anil
antiseptic Ingredients, and are pleasant to
the taste and being dissolved In the mouth
they take Immediate pffect upon the mu-
cous lining of the throat, nasal passages
and whole respiratory tract.
The cures that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
have accomplished In old chronic cases of
cativrh are little nhort of remarkable,
and the advantage of knowing what you
are putting into your stomach is of para-
mount importance when It is remembered
that the cocaine or morphine habit has
been frequently contracted as the result
of using secret catarrh remedies.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets meet with cor-
dial approval from physicians, becauso
their antiseptic character renders them
perfectly safe for the general public to
use and their composition makes them a
common-sense curÂ© for all forms of ca-
tarrhal troubles. . 'â rn t " 1

On all hands it was agreed that the Cal

turned into an admirably arranged ex

Is the excellent collection of pictures that
have been gathered. These, ' mostly
very jwell I hung, occupy the ' entire
space at the farther end o'f the gallery,
and in the 181 specimens exhibited will be
found the names of most of the prom

The evening's programme was opened
by Mayor Phelan In an address, in which
he congratulated the California Club
upon the excellence of the exhibit which
it had prepared and predicted for it the
success which it deserved. He spoke of
the place attained by art In California,
of its gradual rise and of the influences
which had directed it and lent to it a
character almost peculiar - to itself. He
looked- forward to the time when Cali
fornia should have a salon of its own
and when Californlan artists, untram
meled by the prejudice which favors the
foreign for the sake of Its distance or
age, will compete with the world In all
the fields of art.

prised the doctors and the professional
nurse who has had the case in charge.
For more than a week Mr. Kidder has
been unconscious and it was impossible
for him to swallow even liquid food. The
disease of which :he died was diabetes.
The poisonous . fluids had been removed
from his system by sweating processes
Previous - to the time when he became
unconscious Mr. Kidder was told of his
approaching death. He gave minute di
rections as to his funeral, asking that it
be in charge of the Masons. He retained
his membership in the Central Masonic
Lodge of Syracuse, N. Y.. from the timo
he left there forty years ago. The funeral
will take place on Friday afternoon.
John F. Kidder. president as well as
principal owner and manager of the Ne
vada County Narrow Gauge Railroad, was
a civil engineer by profession. He was
born in New. York City in 1830 and moved
with his parents to Syracuse In 1840. In
1861 he went to the State of Nevada In
the Government service and In 1863 was
appointed by the California State govern
ment to survey the boundary line between
California and Nevada. During the fol
lowing year he moved to El J>orado Coun
ty, -where he remained three years. Dur
ing 1865-66 he represented El Dorado Coun
ty in the Assembly. He became engaged
in railroading and resided In Sacramento
and the State of Nevada until 1868, when
he went to Oregon to continue in the
same business. He went to Washington
Territory in 1871 and two, years later re
turned to California, living in Solano and
Monterey counties until 1875, when he
came to Grass Valley.}-
While Mr. Kidder had been actively en
gaged. in engineering since 1849, he found
time to serve the State in many public
offices^* When he was elected in 1865 from
El- Dorado County as Assemblyman .he
proved to be a public spirited and active
member of the lower house of the Legis
lature, particularly championing the con
stitutional . amendment prohibiting slav
ery, and he served with such noted â¢ men
as Hearst, Hancock and Johnson.' Gover
nor . Waterman appointed him Yosemlte
Valley Commissioner, and he did all he
could to Improve the roads . leading Into
the valley. He continued to serve on this
commission .'until appointed, by Governor
Markham as Debris < Commissioner, .which
important position he held up to the time
of his death.
The: passing of John F. Kidder is not
only a loss to the State of California, with
whose early history he was identified, but j
a i loss Irreparable to Nevada County and
more especially Grass Valley, with whose
every advancement he has been connected.
It waa John F. Kidder's energy, pluck
and enterprise that built the first narrow
gauge railroad in this State:- that erected
the first modern dwelling and. laid the first
concrete sidewalk in Grass Valley." 7 Every

ASSASSIN'S PLAN
WIDELY KNOWN
Coroner Hoye investigated the circum
stances surrounding Lenau's death last
evening and decided that â¢ death was due
to the fall and the I beating administered
in trying to subdue him. The under
takers have received a message from a
brother, C. Lenau, in Dakota, telling them
to give thebody decent interment in some
local cemetery. r . . Â¦
Coroner Hoye examined the body and
discovered that the neck was dislocated.
He ordered the remains removed to the
Morgue. When the body was placed in
the receiving casket it clearly showed the
immense size of the man, as^his head and
feet touched the ends of the box.
As they entered Lenau's cell he rushed
at them and a struggle ensued. Lundy
hit Lenau a blow that broke his nose and
caused the blood to flow: freely and a
general mix-up followed. Potter and
Lundy were only slightly marked, but Le
nau was terribly beaten. Both of' his
eyes were closed, his nose was swollen,
and his lips were caked. with blood. He
was finally subdued and placed In the
hospital ward, with a ! straltjacket to
aid in controlling him. Later in the day
he was removed to the dark cell, where
he was less conspicuous, and, after
shrieking all day, he quieted down to
ward evening.
Early yesterday morning the night
jailer heard him groaning, and, looking
in, found him in a fit. As the jailer
watched, the man spun about and fell,
striking his head against the cement
roor. â¢ He lived only a few minutes after
the fall. -
Lenau was arrested last Saturday on a
charge of petty larceny, and was tried on
Monaay and committed to the County Jail
for thirty days. At that time he seemed
rational and made no trouble for the jail
ers. After he had been assigned to a cell
in the tanks, however, he oecame wild,
asking for liquor from every one in the
compartment.
On Monday evening he became much ex
cited and searched in many of the cells
for whisky, his fellow prisoners telling
him jokingly that it was to be found on
some of the men.' While* so -engaged he
was kicked and struck - by a pris
oner, who â¢ resented hi3 > Interference,
After the cells had been closed
for the night Lenau began- to call
for whisky, his cries arousing the other
men, who began to yell with him, finally
creating a commotion that attracted the
attention of the night jailer. He told
Lenau to dress and come out, intending to
put him into a separate cell.. The man
gave a profane refusal, and the jailer
called on Fred S. Potter, a short- term
man, and C. Lundy, also serving" a jail
sentence, whom he released from their
cell and told to bring the Swede into the
corridor.
SEATTLE, April 10.â L. B. Lenau, a
Swede . of gigantic stature, held at the
County . Jail for petty larceny, died yes
terday morning in his cell as the result of
Injuries sustained while In an apopleptic
fit and from a beating received at the
hands of fellow prisoners. For twenty
four hours before his . death Lenau suf
fered from an attack closely resembling
delirium tremens, but received no treat
ment other than a dose of some quieting
medicine , given by the jailer. His out
cries were at first thought to be caused,
not by illness, but by ill- temper, and as
a result of that belief the man was ter
ribly beaten by two other prisoners, sent
by the night jailer to subdue him. His
body, as it lies In the Morgue, is a hor
rible sight, the face being cut, discolored
by bruises and swollen, while the nose Is
broken. . . "Â¦ : .* -

Married Before Rela-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PETALUJIA. Aorll 10.â The runaway
marriage of Miss Mary Caufield and
Henry Howe of this city, as recorded 'in
The Call this morning, created a great
sensation here to-day. The news of the
marriage came as a surprise to tho
friends of the >coume. Howe and M5sa
Caufleld had been lovers for some tima.
He was poor and for that reason the
girl's parents did not favor his suit. MÂ»jw
Caufield -has been reared in comparative
luxury. She has had everything she
wanted and her parents believed she
would not be satisfied to begin a life of
hard work with Howe. Miss Caufleld
pleaded with her parents, but they were
obdurate and refused to entertain Howe
at their home. Then the elopement waa
planned and The Call's announcement
shows how well It succeeded.
The young lady packed her few belong
ings and repaired to a. bouse In the weei
ern part of town last rilsrht. There she
was met by Howe with a carriage. They
drove through town by the back streets

NEWS OF THE /OCEAN.
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura arrived from Australasian
ports yesterday. She was expect
ed last Monday, but was detained
at all the ports of call. -The coal
handlers of New South Wales are out. on
strike and the mail boat could not get a
full supply of fuel. In order to get any
thing like the usual quantity the long
shoremen worked St./. Patrick's day and
were paid $1 25 an hour for so doing.
Soon after the Ventura "sailed. for Auck
land, N.'Z.. it was cabled' .that/there was
a suspected case of plague in ; .West Aus
tralia. The New Zealanders' would not
take any chances and 228 tons > of freight
had to be taken aboard < in ' the- stream.
This caused a delay of twenty-four hours
and a" stop of five hours andV thirty min
utes at Pago Pago, Samoa, did not help
matters. At Honolulu the mail steamship
had to be coaled and that "detained her
thirty-one hours and thirty^mlnutes, so
that, all told, sixty-one hours were lost
during the run from Sydney to San Fran-,
cisco by unavoidable delays. ,
The Ventura brings " up 1216 tons of
freight. Among it Is 2000 crates of onions
and a lot of flax from Auckland. More
than 500 carcasses of frozen mutton from
Sydney were landed at Honolulu. In the
future Australia and New Zealand is go
inp to be brisk competitors for the frozen
meat trade of the islands.
The Ventura brought up 204 cabin pas
sengers, of whom 110 were Shriners, twen
ty-eight second cabin passengers and
forty-three steerage Â¦ passengers. Those

The Arequipa's Cargo.

fto valued at $24,504, ', manifested up to 3 p. m.'

"Buffalo" is an orderâ a fraternity of
the eleven-cent kind. Good-fellowship
and eleven cents are the qualifications of
membershipâ that is all; but the rules are
many and must be religiously observed,
else the victim will find himself separated
from his silver or gold as the case may
be. At present there are about a hun
dred "Buffaloes" in San Francisco. They
are eager and earnest men and, as each
possesses the right to draft new members,
it Is certain" that the order will increase
tenfold within the- next week.
The fundamental rules of the Order of
Buffaloes are as follows: Members. must
always carry a" one-cent' 'piece; hand
shaking must be done .by the left, the
right' being reserved for punching; all
drinks must to piloted to the lips with
the left hand; sign of the order is the left
hand over the left ear; absolute sobriety
and silence must be observed by the Ini
tiated of a week's standing; initiation
fee, the coin in:the possession Of the can
didate nearest to eleven cents.' ._.
These are the 1 cardinal rules. Any
breach of .them by a "Buffalo,- ' if called,
means the purchase of something drink
able for the crowd. ' â¢ " ' 'â¢ â¢
Although the game arrived here a few
weeks ago, it Is not yet epidemic. The
railroad men -have taken to it with more
than ordinary avidity and Â¦ are intro
ducing it in â¢ places where the mirrors
glisten and the glasses shine. Converts
and disciples among the railroad frater
nity gave yesterday afternoon to the work
of establishing, the "Buffalo" institution
upon a firm basis. They succeeded. The
new order is an unqualified success, and
henceforth "Buffalo" will rule the cock
tail route.
Look out for it; always have 15 cents
in your- pocket to pay for initiation; use
the left hand when you are drinking; keep
the one-cent talisman about your person,
and cry ! Buffalo" whenever your friends,
who are of the order, forget the counter
sign. Then you will always go home
sober. "' , - ", .

LOS ANGELES, April lO.-Governsr
Gage returned to-dav from his ranch at
Downey, where he has been recuperating
for. several days. In speaking of President
McKlnley's .visit he expressed the Idea
that the : President might be better
pleased to escape any elaborately ceremo
nious welcomB .upon ias arrival In th-'i
State.. The Governor will meet the. Presi
dent at some point near the State Iin3
anjj give him an informal welcome. He
also will receive the distinguished guests
in ,an appropriate manner when they
reach Sacramento. . â¢
: The Governor v/as asked if he- expectea
to the Ohio Society's banquet In
San Francisco. He. replied with a smile:
"I am scarcely in a position to say. as
I have not yet been asked. I understana
that General Gleaves Â»f San Francisco is
president of the Ohio Societv. Some
months a^o he called at the Governor^
office in Sacramento and wanted to know
if I could not come to a contemplated
banquet to be given by the society some
months thereafter. He could not give tb*
time or place of the banquet and the
matter was left open for Â«Â«rther cons der
ation. If I receive a foimal written imi
tation it will then be time enough for me
to consider whether I can or cannot b^
present. - The. other lay when, in San
Francisco I endeavored to reach General
Gleaves, but he was so occusied with
other matters that we did not meet and I
left town without the pleasure of seelus
hi The Governor was asked to preside at
the most important banquet to be given
during the President's visit-that In San
Francisco-but he preferred to relinquish
the proffered honor, believing that cou -
teay and etiquette demipded tnat itshou a
fall to the Mayor of San Francisco.

YELLOWTAIL NOT INSIDE
THE MONEY AT TAN FO RAN
In a Fierce Drive Gonfalon Wins the Deci
sion Over PrejudiceâRansch in Form.
BY F. Et MTJXHX)IiIiAND.
yr vr ELLOWTAIL, the one-time $10,
\V/ 000 beauty, will soon, ,become
\Y about as badly a battered up pub-
Jf He idol as was ever paraded by
the grand stand. With a huge
chunk of weight off his previous perform
ance, which was a very ordinary _oneÂ»
Captain Hackett's horse appeared in the
fix-furlong purse run at Tanforan .yes
terday carrying only Charley Thorpe and
104 pounds on his broad back. Meeting
him on nearly equal terms were Gonfalon.
Prejudice, Tavon, Looram and Babbler.
The last two had only a small part in th<*
chorus. As Babbler happens to put up, at
the same boarding-house, he had the hon
or of being coupled in the betting with
the star YellowtaH. and 3 to 2 was the
best obtainable at the box office. Tayon
was to be seen at his best in this cast,
and from 34 to 5 he was backed to 11 to 5.
Gonfalon, himself a virtuoso in the East
before making: the California trip, has be
come acclimated and came in for steady
support, while far frcm the end stall came
& Up en Prejudice, with only ninety-six
pounds to juggle, that caused a quiet play.
"When the curtain was raised Thorpe
rushed Yellowtail away in front, and
Dominick astrike Tayon foolishly tried to
outfoot him the first half, which was cov
ered in :47&. It was not long before the
favorite had enough, and Tayon hit the
stretch first. O'Connor next moved up
with Gonfalon and resorted to rough
work, laying over against Bookmaker
Cooks' horse the last eighth of a mile,
while Tayon. to hold his own. endeavored
to savace Gonfalon. . Tayon was knocked
off his stride, and though beaten but a
head altogether Gonfalon was called on
to K;eet a. fresh one in Prejudice, with J.
Ransch up, which came like a shadow,
losing the verdict by a nose only in 1:12*.
yellowtail rumbled in five lengths farther
back. Had Dominick nursed Tayon the
first part, that horse could have won.
Only One of Many Upsets.
This upset was only one of many that
has helped the bookmakers' end of it
along for the last few days, for the ring
has been experiencing halycon times.
Brunswick and Catherine Bravo repre
sented the winning favorites, the other
purses falling to long shots George
Dewey, Loconomo and Don Luis, only
backed in a weak-hearted sort of way.
The Gaffer has a hard time trying to
win a purse. The Uncas gelding went to
the post favorite for the six and a half
furlong sprint that opened the racing and
was beaten out a head by the 15 to 1
George Dewey. John Welch, a well-touted
one, led to the stretch and then blew up.
Sailor, another backed one, met with ad
verse luck at the start, finishing back in
the ruck.
Brunswick Heeded "Urging.
Brunsjvick, the record breaker, required
some urging on -the part of O'Connor to
beat Huachuca for the two-year-old
scramble at four and a half furlongs.
Closing a 2 to 7 favorite, the fast young
ster once seemed to hang below the pad
dock, but when shaken up drew away,
winning by more than a length in :54%.
From a time standpoint the race was a
good one. as a stiff breeze blew down the
home stretch. Considerably messed about.
Flora Pomona finished a close third.
Long shots completely smothered the
shorter priced horses in the seven-furlong
selling affair which followed, the winner
turning up in Loconomo, a 10 to 1 chance,
ridden by Charley Thorpe. The "old man"
did some tall hustling on Loconomo and,
passing McAlbert in the stretch, downed
Screenwell Lake a length, hard ridden.
Alicia, at .odds of 40 to 1, ran into the
show. Benson Caldwell wds again In
stalled favorite, but seemed unable to
keep up.
There was nothing much to recommend
any of the starters in the second maiden
event at six and a half furlongs. Cath
erine Bravo had the call and won all the
way. Canejo, Under Mounce's riding,
snatched the place from Cerro Santa.
Tame Irishman did not seem to be bris
tling with speed, even If he was made
favorite for the final run over seven fur
longs. Money bet on the horse was money
thrown away. After Asian had tired Vain
took the lead, when he was in turn col
lared and downed a head by the 15 to 1
shot Don Luis.

result' of the visit the commanding gen

cused of standing idly by while the men

The creditors of Brick & Co. met yes
terday in the rooms of the San Francisco

charges . made by Morris Brick, - â¢who
claimed that | Major Steele of â¢ the Thir
tieth Infantry stood idly, by while his men
laid violent hands on the collectors for
the firms who had ' given Â¦ his men credit
for unlimited amounts. Brick said that
his men were given passes by Major Steele
which granted them the privilege of en
tering ,the Â¦ camp of the Thirtieth Infan
try for the purpose . of collecting the
amounts due him . for , clothing furnished
the soldiers. Brick's men were allowed
to enter the camp. - but Â¦ when . they at
tempted to collect the amounts due 1 him
they were thrown into a blanket- and
tossed â¢ into the air. The result * of this
treatment was a loss of $3800 owed to him
by the men. of the Thirtieth, and a pros

Board May Remove Deputies
in Office of School De-'
partment.4:>-
The undignified sauabble that has been
irolng on. between the Board of Education
and Superintendent of Schools Webster
reached its culminating point yesterday.
Attorney Denman, wno has filed two de
mands of $500 each for legal services ren
dered the board, submitted an opinion in
which he holds that the board has abso
lute authority, under the charter, over the
Deputy Superintendent of Schools. This
opinion was presented as a measure of re
taliation for the unkind things said by
the Superintendent's office about the ex
orbitant charge of Denman for what is
termed petty legal services.
While Denman's opinion Is not official
and cannot be accepted as such, the board
received it with pleasurable feelings and
President Kincaid was immediately au
thorized to communicate with City At
tornev Lane with a view toward securing
his opinion. Should Lane agree with Den
man it means that the four deputies in
Webster's officeâ Klngsbury. Jordan, How
ard and- Sullivanâ will lose their official
heads. The board has openly declared it*
unfriendliness for the deputies and it hails
with delight the possibility of getting ic
venge for all the criticism it has been
subjected to. Director Casscrly, who is
especially bitter, favors the increase of
the deputies' salaries :"rom $150 to $2.10 D3r
month if the courts decide that. the board
is entitled to appoint the officials named
Superintendent Webster laughs at the
desire of the board to assume control over
his deputies and is not afraid that he wiil
be deprived of his prerogative in the prem
ises. He says he will not sign any salary
demands of deputies except for those of
his own selection. Webster auotes tna
charter, which says that "the Superinten-,
dent shall appoint four' deputies." Den
man's opinion follows: . Â¦
I have to advise you that you have no war
rant, cither imder the charter or the State
Uw, to provide for or pay out a salary to
the Deputy Superintendents of Schools. The
only method by which you can acquire Juris
diction to pay a salary to these gentlemen'
would be to employ them under that sec^on
01 tbe cliaiter giving you the power -to em
ploy all !K!tt>ons necessary to carry into effect
your powers and duties. It would, of * course,
be required of you that you decide that these
gentlemen are necessary to the efficient dis
charge of your duties. I must call your at
tention to the fact, however, that the Super
intendent is reported to have eaid that you
acquire from the charter no greater powers
than under the 'State laws. If the Superin
tendent be correct, which I seriously doubt,
even such employment of these gentlemen
would be impossible. .
President Kincaid expresses a determin
ation to recommend the appointment - of
two women deputies if the appointing
power is transferred from the Superinten
dent to the board. In discussing the sub
ject Mrs. Kincaid said:
In view of the fact that . so large a num
ber of children- In the deijartment are in prim
ary grades, it .is. in my opinion, an absolute
necessity to have at least one woman deputy.
If not two. No matter how thoroughly well
informed a man may be, .in psychological and
pedagogical lines, he cannot possibly, deal with
child nature In the earliest years aa a woman
can.
Attorney Denman's Demand.

weaker. Dr. Clift srave out a bulletin to

, National guardsmen of California are
looking forward to ai delightful summer
outing at Santa CruzA Adjutant General
Seamans expects that all ' the troops of
the State will go into camp on June 15,"
and remain on the tented field until Juno
23.' It is also expected that Governor
Gage, commandcr-in-chief, will attend the
encampment, although the immediate
command of the- forces In the field will
devolve tippn Major General John Â¦ H.
Dickinson, division commander.
The First. Second. Fifth, Sixth and Sev
enth regiments of infantry and four
troops of cavalry, will comprise the divi
sion. The adjutant general estimates
that 3000 guardsmen will assemble at San
ta Cruz.
Considerable expense will attach to the
transportation of troops stationed at Los
Angeles and other points south of Te
hachapi. It is figured, however, that the
sum of $12,000 will cover the cost of trans
porting men, horses^and camp equipage
to and from Santa Cruz. The Southern
Pacific Company can afford to make a
low nUe to the State from the south and
the Interior to Monterey Bay, as the en
campment will attract visitors other than
the military to the scene of.summer.ma
neuvers.
The State troops are fairly well sup
plied'.with regular and shelter tents,
ranges, blankets and mess outfits. TherÂ°
.will be no necessity for additional outlay
in this line of equipment. The guard as
now constituted is decidedly shy of artil
lery. -There is not even a saluting sec
tion of artillery in the division. The ad
jutant general recommends that four bat
teries of coast artillery be organized, but
the, organization cannot be; perfected in
time for the summer encampment. Major
General Dickinson and Adjutant General
Seamans will doubtless devise some meth
od . of saluting -the Governor when the
commander-in-chief.. accompanied by his
staff, enters the camp. â¢

AT REDUCED PRICES
Six Hundred Carloads Are Expected
to Be Moved Within a Few
Days.
SAN JOSE, April 10.â The reduction of
the prire of prurcs to a 2-cent basi& by the
fured Fruit Association is the most im
port aiit move ytt mad* by that body, and
the growers look for imm?diate results in
the way cf lars^e shipments Kast. Since the
cut made yesterday afternoon the associa
tion has sold more than double the num
ber of carloads than have been sold since
."anuary 1. Six hundred carloads of fruit
p.re expected to be moved within the next
few days.
The following is the scale of prices for
prunes, net to the grower: 60 to 70. 2%
cents per pound; 70 to SO, 2% cents; 80 to
?9. l^i cents; 90 to 100, 1*4 cents. Those are
prices in sacks and the usual additions
are made for racking In 25 and 50 pound
boxes.
Owing to the decision of Judge Sea well
In the Alnsworth case the directors of the
< "ured Fruit Association will at the annu
al meeting in May submit to the growers
the question whether or not the associa
tion ehall continue.
Judge Bond said that the directors have
.l^ad the proposed cut to 2 cents under
consideration since the first of the year.
At the end of fifteen days, by operation
of the resolution making the reduction,
the price will fro back to 3 cents.

definite between the retired President, Dr.

ways' franchise as to the House. The dis
pensary bill Is shelved for the present, on

Republican members of the SenateâCar
ter standing out alor.e to support the bill.
The joint resolution for a conference to
elect holdover Senators brought about the
meeting, only to have It discovered that
the resolution itselfâ the documentâ had
been lost. There Is talk about bribery In
the matter, as also in regard to the tram

incipient mob.
The Legislature has passed but one bill,
r.nd that is to provide for Its own ex

Thf House of Representatives has en-

dered Its clerk to return the document to
the Governor with a notice that it was
"not in proper shape." because it was
signed "Sanford U. Dele." without any
litlo being affixed to the signature. This
Â»iÂ«-tion was taken because the Governor
leoently sent a resolution back to the
Houfp on account of its being uncertified

Tn his Setter th? Governor declined to
tr-sjiond to a call for general information
â¢ â¢n subjects connected with proceedings
"f thÂ«* Executive Council, stating that he
required specific demands for certain data

subject before the House on which any

INDEPENDENTS
ARE DIVIDED
â¢ The preliminary examination of Daniel
Sullivan came up before Justice of th3
Peace Percy Long yesterday morning, but
by consent - of all . persons concerned it
went over until next AVednesdav morning.
The matter being unaer investigation by
the Grand- Jury, It was deemed advisable
to let the court case. lapse until the Grand
Jury had arrived at some conclusion. The
case to be tried is that of forging the
name of J. Evans, a saloon-keeper, doing
business at 116 Eddv street, to an order
for $500 bail money. I*. Ji.Lennon and W.
S. Barnes appeared as attorneys for Suili
van. -.'Â¦.-.. Â¦ . .
In the meantime, while Sullivan is being
held for trial, the city . officials affected
byrthe fraudulent transactions of the war
rant and bond clerk's assistant are indus
triously engaged in shutting the prover
bial barn door, having just realized that it
was too wide open. The request of the
Treasurer to the City and County Attor
ney for an opinion on the duties of th3
Auditor in the matter of bail demands
was the first step. The opinion of the at
torney, as published yesterday, was that
the Auditor had everything to do with
them and the last stec is the expressed
willingness of the Auditor to take the
added work upon hi^ office. From, now
on 'the Auditor will- have to audit every
demand for bail money that is made upon
the Treasurer.
"Wells Had Objections.
",At first Auditor "Weils did not see his
way clear to take up the work. It will
entail extra work upon already well
worked clerks; it will necessitate â¢ the
opening of a new and complicated ac
count, if. not. an entirely new set. of
books; it will reauire reports from the
warrant and bond clerk's office and from
the .Treasurer perhaps daily; it will in
volve delay in the cashing of bail money
orders, and to conclude the Auditor wa3
by no means certain that his bond would
stand this extra and unlooked-for rer
sponsibillty or that his bondsmen would De
willing, to remain on nls bond If the extra
risk were taken. All through it was a
complicated question, but the Auditor last
evening unofficially assured the City and
County Attorney that he would take up
the work and pass upon the bail demands
from the Police Court. Â¦
Lans Suggests a Plan.
The Auditor's orincioal contention was
that the bail money was deposited in a
special fund and so was not "city" money,
which is required to be passed upon by
him, but this contention he has laid aside.
In his opinion City and County Attorney
Lane suggested that the four Police
Judges' get together and formulate rules
regarding the proceedure on bail deposits
and demands that will assist both - the
Auditor and the Treasurer in keeping
check on the money paid into court and
paid out by the treasury on orders of
court. They have all the power necessary
to make any rules of procedure they seo
fit and the result probably will be a chee'i
system that will provide even for the con<
tingency of a dishonest &6nd clerk's dep
uty. -A system of reports from -the bond
clerk to the Treasurer and the Auditor as
to the deposits of bail money and reports
from the Treasurer to the Auditor as to
the receipts of bail money will be estab
lished; the demands will be s"ent from the
Police Courts direct to the Auditor instead
of through the Board of Supervisors, as
is the case with all other besides salary
demands, and as soon r.i possible the new
check system, on the . Police Court bail
money will be put into operation.

FOREST PRESERVATION
/""*Â» ONSULAR REPORTS for April contains \ a
( communication from Commercial Agent Gus-
tave'Beutelspacher of Moncton, Canada, com
menting upon the efforts of the Canadians to provide
for the preservation of their forests and describing
the plans of the British Government for increasing
the forest area of India. These measures undertaken
by our neighbors to the north and our British cousin3
are of interest to us, for it is high time that we entered
seriously upon the task of preserving the forests of
this country.
It appears from the report that the British long ago
found out that many cf the greatest evils that afflict
the. people of India are due to the wasting of the
ancient forests, and accordingly, as far back as 1844,
steps were taken to prevent further waste. It is only
during the last twenty years, however, that the work
has been conducted on scientific principles, under
charge of expert foresters from France and Germany,
assisted by students from the school of forestry near
Dehra. At the present time there is a forest re
serve in each province, and the acreage is being con
tinually increased. Notwithstanding the compara
tively short time since scientific forestry was under
taken it is stated: "A large revenue is already de
rived from the forests by the Government of India,
and it is expected it will steadily increase." .â¢
The Canadians are learning the lesson taught by
the experience of -India, and have for some time past
made efforts to protect their woods. The experi
mental farms of the Dominion Government have en
couraged tree-planting b> farmers, and it is now pur
posed to have the provincial governments establish
forestry departments and assist in the work.
In the meantime the United States is doing hardly
anything in the way of c'ealing scientifically and com
prehensively with the problem. . There still lives with
us the belief that our forests are inexhaustible.* Our
lumber industries are conducted in such a manner as
to waste as much as is used for merchandise,; and,
furthermore, nothing effective is done to provide
against forest fires even in well settled communities.
So destructive have been these different forms. of
waste that in- our older States the people are already
beginning to. experience. some of the evils that hav2
befallen the woodless districts of India. In the April
number of the Forum A. H. Ford, in discussing the
eiTect of the destruction of forests up6n our water
ways, says: "New England was the first section to
fet! the effects of the deforestry of a magnificent area
Of timber land. Rivers that fifty years ago carried

The Supervisors and the Board of Public Works
h?.ve again been called to a halt by Auditor Wells
for ordering in a decidedly irregular way the appro
priation of public money. If public officials ; were
made individually and privately responsible for their
irregular public acts a very necessary lesson in civic
n'orality might be taught.
SOME interesting information concerning the
book trade as seen from the standpoint of
publishers was brought out at a recent trial in
London of a suit by an Irish author against Con
siable & Co. for failure to publish a book in time for
its presentation to the public at the date agreed upon.
The book was a romance dealing with affairs in
Ireland from 1690 to 1720, the period following the
battle of the Boyne. The author desired to have the
book in the hands of the retailers by St. Patrick's
day, believing it would have a better sale at that sea
son. The publishers failed to bring the work out un
til April 20, and it was alleged by the plaintiff that
net only did he suffer loss by the delay in publica
tion, but also by the failure of the publishers to push
the book in the United States. The defense claimed
that the delay in publication did not affect the sale of
the book, that the firm did endeavor to obtain sale for
it in the United States as well as in Great Britain,
3nd expended Â£25 in advertising^t
For the purpose of getting expert testimony con
cerning the validity of the defense representatives of
leading publishing houses in London were called to
the stand. One of these testified: "It is practically
impossible to get a book by an unknown author
taken up in America." Another said that when books
by unknown authors are presented to retail book
dealers they "treat them as a horse would a thistle in
his nosebag," and upon being asked by the court,
'"What does the horse do?" he replied, "Shakes his
head and snorts."
The most curious bit of evidence, however, was
that given by a. traveling salesman for a leading pub
lishing house, who, when asked concerning the ques
tion of loss through the delay in publication," answered
that from a business point of view he preferred the
o ogy 1 in March and novels in June and July.
Herein we have another illustration of the differ
ence between experts and laymen. In the light of re
ctnt successes achieved in this country by works
whose authors were absolutely unknown to the Ameri
can public, .it is not easy to find justification for the
statement that it is "practically impossible to get . a
book by an unknown author taken up in America."
ICor is it easy to understand why in March theology
should be more popular than a novel. Evidently
there are mysteries in the bo.ok business, and some
enterprising publisher should write a work on the
subject and illustrate it with diagrams.

STEEL TRUST PROBLEMS.
rROM the organization of the steel trust there
has issued discussion enough to form a library
of itself. Nor have the effects been confined to
discussion. In several quarters action has been taken
either to profit by the big combination or else to
guard against the results that are expected to flow
from it. The actions r.o more than the discussions
have been confined to the United States, and from
Europe we get almost as much evidence of the far
reaching influence of the trust . as in our own
country. * ': . " .
London dispatches recently announced that reports
are current in Germany of a movement-in that coun
try to bring about a combination of the big steel
manufacturers in Germany with the steel combine in
the United States, so as to form an organization that
can dictate terms to the world. ,The report quoted an
unnamed American millionaire now visiting Germany
as saying: "We do rot fear England in America,
nor does Germany. We simply fear each other, but
the world is big enough for both nations and the rival
trusts are going to harmonize their interests^ Mr.
Morgan will be here in April. After he begins it will
not be long before an international cartel to regulate
prices and products will be formed. We do not fear
England because her machinery is obsolete and her
men are spiritless and ground to a low level by false
unionism. America and Germany are going to stand
together and dominate the world politics of business.
I think that one day the industries of the entire world
will be syndicated."
Another report is to the effect that the steel manu
facturers of Scotland and the north of England have
agreed to combine for the purpose of resisting the
competition of the steel trust. According to this story,
a British syndicate are now working low grade ores at
Dunderland by the Edison process and are getting
returns which encourage them to believe they can.
compete successfully with American ore production.
The chairman of the syndicate, Joseph Lawrence, is
reported to have said: "We have proved-the-exist
ence in part of the Dunderland property of 80,000,000
tons of- ore. There is reasonable hope that the other
parts are proportionately as good. It is our. present
intention to ship this ore exclusively; to British iron
masters, there being already a market for it. at su
perior prices. There seems here a promise of a sup
ply of high-grade Bessemer ore adequate to the needs
of Great Britain for some years, so it will not be long,
to use Mr. Edison's own words, before the great Bes
semer plants take on a new era of prosperity."
In this country as well as in Great .Britain there
have been expressions of confidence that the new
process devised by .Edison for ; converting iron ore
into steel will break the monopoly organized by the
big trust. It has been hailed as an evidence that no
monopoly can be formed that American inventive
genius cannot overcome. About, as soon as a trust
gets control of the market in any line of production,
some inventor will devise a cheaper and better means
of manufacture and thus prepare a way for success
ful competition. * 'O .
The theory is a stimulating one and offers a seem
ingly satisfactory solution of the whole trust problem
fo far as it relates to manufactured goods. Unfortu
pately it does not take account of. the fact that the
trust might buy up the invention. The managers of
the steel combine, for example, have as good a chance
as any one else to profit by any. new invention Mr.
Edison may devise. In fact, if the combine be strong
enough it may effect a monopoly of invention itself.
In tKe meantime it is to be noted the United States
Investor declares a conviction that the prime purpose
of the steel trust is to promote speculation. After de
scribing the John Law craze in France it says: "We
don't for a moment suppose that the American peo
ple are going to make such fools of themselves over
Mr. Morgan and his steel'combine as the French peo
ple did over the marvelous' Scotch financier in the
first quarter of the eighteenth" century, but unques-!
tionably the new steel combine has been formed for
the purpose, of stimulating speculation, and the'pro
moters, we take it, will be vastly disappointed if it
does not foster a more unrestrained speculative move
ment than has ever yet â¢ been witnessed in this
country." ' Â¦ . . ' '
From all these reports 'and opinions it will be seen
that the steel trust is far more exciting to the indus
trial world of Europe and/America than is the,strug
gle in China.- The good and the evil of it are noted
everywhere, but it is too early to say which predomi
nates. .

vnr.â worry
Mental worry Is a condition of the hu
man mind generally resulting ' from the
combined influence of fear,* anxiety and
.doubt or uncertainty, and is almost al
ways accompanied by increased excitabil
ity of the nervous structure of the body.
It is a mental condition the opposite of
confidence and contentment, and is very
prevalent in the more highly civilized
countries of modern times.. For the more
modern civilization advances the more
varied, enticing and complex become all
the industrial and social relations of hu
man life. Consequently . the more nu
merous,, tempting and uncertain become
the conditions, motives and possibilities
presented to each individual composing
the community. . â¢ - . -Â¦
The condition of mlna called "worry,"
when well marked v and persistent, exerts
a depressing and debilitating effect upon
all the functions of a living body. It
causes the heart to beat more frequently,
but with less force; the breathing to be
less deep, thereby taking less air into the
lungs, and furnishing less oxygen to the
blood; a general sense of weariness, with
less appetite, and less refreshing sleep.
Habitually receiving less than is natural
of the oxygen of the air through the air
cells of the lungs Into the blood, the sense
of weariness or of being "tired" -becomes
more constant; the natural secretions of
the stomach, liver, pancreas and follicles
of the Intestines are diminished, causing
both and ,- constipation; and
metabolic or molecular changes In the tis
sues of the "body, constituting both nutri
tion'and "waste, are diminished, causing
impairment of the vital properties of the
blood. For all the functions. Just named
are directly dependent upon the constant
and adequate tupply of fresh oxygen of
the air through the air-ceils of the lungs
into the biood, and the liberation of car
bon inÂ«the air exhaled.
How "Worry Shortens Life.
Consequently, when persistent mental
worry impairs the efficiency of respiration
and circulation' by depressing the influ
ence of the vaso-motor and pneumogas
tric nerves, it indirectly disturbs and de
presses all the more important functions
of the body and lessens the individual's
vital resistance to any and all causes of
disease. He is more quickly overcome by
either mental or physical exertion; ho ia
more readily affected injuriously by at
mospheric vicissitudes, and he more cer
tainly yields to the influence of tubercular
and all other disease-producing bacilli or
microbes. His chances for long life,
therefore, are very much diminished. In
deed, I have never known a man or wo
man habitually afflicted with true mental
worry who lived to three score and ten
years. .
The class of people who enjoy the high
est average duration of life and furnish
the most numerous cases of unusual long
evity is the clerical, and such others as
are chiefly engaged in. scientific and In
tellectual pursuits. Their occupations in
volve less expectation of either rapid pe
cuniary gains or losses, and- if affliction
threatens them their mental anxiety is
tempered by the ever present hope of a
better life beyond this.
Serious and protracted worry Is mani
fested first most frequently and injurious
ly during youth or school days; second,
at the period of choosing one's occupation
and the first few years of Its pursuit, and
third, at the middle period of adult life,
when business, vicissitudes and domestic
cares,' discords and misfortunes are most
frequent and severe.
Effects of Worry on Children.
The most active causes of the worry
during school days are the arranging of
children of different temperaments and
capacities in the same classes, assigning
them too many studies, and then con
stantly stimulating their ambition to ex
cel and intensifying their mortification at
every failure. By such processes the
younger and more timid ones are kept in
a constant state of apprehension or worry
until many of them lose appetite, become
restless at night, often complain of head
ache and are retained at home, and not
a few c-f them become affected with, cho
rea or St. Vitus dance. Among the older
pupils many are found whose ambition to
stand high in too many classes leads them
to study late at night and to omit daily,
free, outdoor exercises, in consequence of
wnich their blood receives less oxygen
from fresh air in the lungs, and the func
tions of both brain and stomach become
impaired and the mind depressed or wor
ried, and by the time they have completed
the period allotted for school education
they â¢ have become permanent Invalids
from so-called neurasthenia, dyspepsia or
tuberculosis, this all ending in shortening
the duration of life.
Beginning a Career.
Perhaps the most critical period of hu
man life is that when the young man or
woman, finds it necessary to . choose an
occupation for life. Comparatively few are
contented to follow the occupation of their
parents by which they could, with reason
able certainty, accumulate all the neces
sary comforts and conveniences of life and
make themselves useful members of
society. On the contrary, such is the all
dominating influence of wealth, and the
social display it renders possible, that the
desire to make money, and to make it fast
may be said to be the ruling- passion of
til ft 3 fiTP "" "
As the, cities are the chief centers of
trade, manufactures," professions, all spec
ulative enterprises, and almost all varie
ties of labor, the young of both sexes are
constantly migrating from the rural and
agricultural districts to the cities, in the
expectation of making money faster or
gaining more desirable social positions.
Consequently they, find every line of-busi
ness, from street-sweeping and bartending
to floor walking and superintending in the
great department stores, all crowded with
applicants for employment. The avenues
to the several professions are no less
crowded, and their successful practice
even more difficult. .Therefore, large num
bers, of both sexes are constantly found
either wholly unemployed, or so unsteady
that they are constantly in a state of de
pressing anxiety or worry, lest they fail to
obtain even the necessaries of life.. Those
of less education allow themselves to b'e
packed Into overcrowded and ill-ventilated
houses and workshops, at the lowest
wages, which, added to the depressing in
fluence of persistent mental worry, soon
makes them subject to attacks of disease,
especially of typhoid fever.and;consump
tion, or they become desperate and yield
to vicious habits and a brief life of vice
and crime, not infrequently ended I by
suicide. A large proportion of the. better
educated apply for clerical work, either as
salesmen or saleswomen In shops j and
stores or as bookkeepers, typewriters, etc.
Having left home to seek their fortunes
they are directi-" confronted by three
sources of worry. The first is caused by.
fear that they may not find suitable em
ployment; the second, by anxiety lest they
may fail to give satisfaction where they
are- employed; and the third, still more
anxiety for rapid advancement in both
position 'and pay. : ... Â«; -
Â¦ Unwholesome Conditions.
As has been - previously stated, mental
anxiety cr worry always lessens the depth
and efficiency of respiration, which is fur
ther lessened by- all indoor occupations
requiring mental attention. Consequently
a large portion at those young men. and
women who. pass from a free outdoor life
to clerical work in shops,' stores and of
fices, in a few months begin to complain
of being "tired." -They insist that they
are tired every night, and just as tired
when they rise in the morning, with but
little appetite. L To "brace up" they take Â¦
one or two cups of strong, coffee or tea,
and but, little food for breakfast. This
affords , a little nervous exhilaration for
about two hours, when it vanishes, leav
ing them . more depressed ' and tired : than
before during the remainder of the I day.
In addition to coffee : many j of the young 1
men add the smoking of a cigar of to
bacco after , : each i meal. - ox the taking of
a glass of. beer, both of which, by-lessen
ing, the. sensibility of the brain, diminish
their senses of -weariness or, depression for
.M hour or. two, but also retard digestion]

and impair the vitality of the protoplasm
of the blood and tissues of the body, and
therefore hasten their -failure of health
and add to their mental worry in the same
proportion. It is by the foregoing com
bination of influences that . many thÂ«u
sands of both sexes be? ome converted into
dyspepstics, neurasthenics or consump
tives before- they complete the first thirty
years of life. And other thousands of the
men unconsciously to themselves are far
on to road to drunkenness, poverty and
vice.
An Example of Mental Worry.
That mental worry is capable of play
ing- the part I have assigned to it is Illus
trated by the following cases:
Miss A., aged 23 years, up to four years
previous had onjoyed good health and
more or less free exercise in the open air.
As she had to earn her own living she
chose the dressmaking business and en
tered a dressmaker's shop for that pur
pose, and immediately began going to the
shop as soon as she was through break
fast. She worked diligently until 6 o'clock
in. the evening, with only time for a hasty
lunch at noon. In a few months she be
gan to feel weary, with failing appetite
and digestion, which added to her anxiety
through fear of being disabled by sick
ness. She persevered with her work and
became gradually worse until at the end
of three years she came to my office look
ing pale, thin in flesh, with an expression:
of anxiety bordering on despair. I tolc
her that on rising from the bed in the
morning she should. spend one minute in
taking full breathing and free movements
of her arms in all directions, by whlcli
she would renovate the air In her lungs,
add several cubic inches of oxygen to her
blood and quicken the whole circulation;
then have her breakfast at such time that
she could spend half an hour of walking
and free breathing in the open air before
arriving at her shop for work, and when
the day's work was done she could take
her evening meal as usual, but never let
the whole evening pass without going out
half an hour or more in walking and free
breathing before going to bed. By doing
this faithfully as long as she spent all the
day indoors she would sleep nights and
recover health. I saw her three years
later looking well, and was assured by her
that she had literally followed my advice
concerning exercise in the open air and
soon recovered ability to sleep and gooa
digestion without medicine of any kind.
The Man Who Took No Exercise.
Mr. C called upon .me ten or twelve
years since, complaining of some degree
of indigestion, slight irregularities in the
action of his heart, especially on lying
down at night, when his stomach was dis
tended Â¦with gas, and great mental depres
sion and worry through fear of sudden
death from organic disease of the heart.
He was an intelligent business man, much
confined to his office, and during the last
year, since having been told that he had
permanent disease of his heart, he had
ventured to take no active exercise and
was losing both appetite and sleep. After
a careful examination of his condition I
was able to say to him that he had not
the slightest disease of either heart or
lungs, and that he was in no more danger
of sudden death than was any other man
in the community. On the contrary, he
was assured positively that if he would
live on good, wholesome food, take no
strong tea or coffee and no kind of liquor,
either fermented or distilled, but Instead
take from one to two hours of outdoor
exercise each day, he would soon be well.
Five or six years later I met him in good
health and â¢ spirits, . and all without any
other medicine than fresh air, wholesome
food and mental confidence.
Effects of Alcoholic Drinks.
.But the most severe and protracted
cases of mental worry are caused by the
habitual use of alcoholic drinks, aided by
othervanesthetlc and narcotic drugs. It
is not so much mental worry that these
produce in those who drink as it is In
their wives, mothers and children. On tha
drinker they directly dull the sense of
propriety, sear the conscience and pro
duce progressive degeneration, ending In
physical and mental imbecility if not in
terrupted by outbreaks -of reckless crim
inality, often including murder and sui
cide.
But can any one comprehend the amount
and Intensity of the mental worry endured
by. 100,000 wives and mothers in our coun
try whose husbands and fathers are spend
ing much of their time and money In the
salcon or clubhouse with its bar and card
table? Many of them become so much
weakened In vitality by the continued
worry caused by ever-increasing dread of
the fast approaching disgrace and poverty
that they become easy victims of con
sumption'or other infectious diseases, and
not a few of them become insane. Neither
does the mental worry; and nervous ex
haustion end with these. For the inves
tigationg of the last half-century have
shown conclusively that children begotten
by, parents whose blood and tissues are
dally pregnated with alcohol are born
with so little vitality that one-half of
their number die before they attain to 5
years of age, and of the remaining- half
50 per cent prove to be affected with epi
lepsy, feeble-mindedness, idiocy, insanity
or physical deformity, leaving less than 25
per cent of the whole number to arrive at
adult age healthy in body and mind. By
the most conservative use of -well-ascer
tained facts and figures it may be safely
said that half of all the insane, idiotic and
epileptic; more than half of all the pauper
ism, public and private, and three-fourths
of all criminally In this country are easily
traceable, directly or indirectly, to the usa
of fermented and distilled liquors for
drinking purposes. If such use could be
entirely discontinued it would increase
the average duration of human life more
than -33 per cent during the next two gen
erations and diminish more than 50 per
cent the total sum of mental worry and
distress in our country. . ' .
If I am asked how this can be done I
answer, as I have been answering for more
than fifty years, simply by placing alcohol
and all liquids containing 2 per cent or
more of It on the statutory list of poisons,
dangerous to the public health and morals,
and to be sold and dealt In under the same
regulations as corrosive- sublimate, ar-
Senic, stryqhnine.oil of vitriol, etc., and
every dealer to be personally responsible
for whatever damage occurs to those with
whom he deals. That it* belongs on that
list is obvious to all who look or think,
for. It kUls more human beings every
week than all the poisons now on the stat
utory list do in a year.
Here Is a Remedy for "Worry.
Regarding the best means of preventing
or mitigating the other varieties of men
tal worry and nervous excitability, it 13
sufficient to say that they consist in re
moving or lessening the causes mentioned
In ' connection vith each variety. Cease
goading our children Into the utmost
haste in their education. Repress in our
youth the Inordinate desire for wealth and
vain "show. Remind them that he who
hasteth to be rich more frequently cometh
to poverty, and that "pride goeth before
destruction and a haughty spirit before a
tMl." Teach them that they are most
happy who contribute most to the happi
ness of others and thereby diminish the
dominance of human selfishness. Seek to
impart confidence and hope to those who
worry.- Hope is not only ."an. anchor to
the . soul," but : when united with confi
dent expectation it is a most efficient tonic
for invigorating all the functions of the
body. He is the most successful physician
who inspires his patient with the most
confidence and hope. It is Jhe invigorat
ing effect of hope and confidence that con
stitutes the efficient agency effecting most
of the cures attributed to Christian sci
ence, faith curists, magnetic healers 1 and
others. So long as the young son of Klne
David was dangerously sick the mind of
the good king was so intensely worried
that he would neither eat nor sleep But
when the death of the lad put an end to
the torturing. anxiety and doubts of the
f^ he {' J 1< L, calm Â« ly aros e. washed himself,
adjusted his raiment and partook of his
accustomed food. When his courtiers
manifested their astonishment his only
reply was that. the loved one could never
come back, but in due time he should go
to him. The ceasing of doubts and fears
and ? the > confident Â¦-â¢ hope - of again joining
the son a in another and happier world at
once -dispelled from his mind, all worry
and replaced it w^th the calmness of hope.
EXPULSION OF THE NEGRO.
THE process of disfranchising the Southern
negro, and nullifying the Federal constitution
goes gayly on south of Mason and Dixon's line.
By one device or. another the black race is being
deprived of "all political rights. With rare exceptions
the negroes take , it as* stoically as they did slavery.
Long accustomed to subjection, they accept its latest
form without wincing." As the emancipation procla
mation found most of tjicm unaware of what had hap
pened, this partial reversal of that great decree of
liberty moves them not to protest. , ;
The issue promises to assume the exact form in
which the institution of slavery finally presented-it
self. The bondage of the black man reacted upon
the white. It made him the sole arbiter of the life
and destiny of other human beings. He became ac
customed to the autocratic use of authority over men
who were as little entitled to protest as the beasts
that perish. Having taken away liberty the. master
could take away life.
The effect on the wh:te man was bad; it made
him carry the stiff neck of the final judge into his
dealing with his white fellows and caused in him,
first, intolerance of resistance to his authority, and
finally intolerance of adverse opinion. These habits
have long survived the abolition of slavery and the
failure of the rebellion, and have been the great bar
to the progress and prosperity of the South. Until
recently throughout that region, and now in some
parts of it, Northern men with needed capital and
enterprise must submit to be treated as unwelcome
intruders, or- retreat from art atmosphere noxious to
energy and progress.
In the new phase of the negro question the South
ern man is jarred out of his indifference and brought
face to face with his own interests.
â¢That Senatorial travesty on statesmanship, Morgan
of Alabama, has recently announced that not only
must the negro be disfranchised but that his expul
sion from the South must follow. Then, this mar
plotting parody says, ''the Southern people will be
happy' and free."
But, from the Potomac to the Bayou Teche, South
ern labor is performed by the negro. As a miner,
.mechanic, millman and agriculturist he does practi
cally all the work in the South. Southern manufac
tures, lately so crescent and promising, are based
entirely on negro labor. From shucking oysters on
Chesapeake Bay to withstanding the deadly miasma
in the rice fields of the Louisiana lowlands he is the
indispensable factor in Southern industry. The white
owners of great plantations farm-let their lands to
negroes and are enriched by the rents which black
kbor pays. When cotton rose to 10 cents a pound
last year and rolled weaith into the South, she would
not have had enough of that staple to clothe her own
pcc-ple had it not been for negro labor which pro
duced the crop. ,
Under these circumstances the Southern whites
look with aversion upon Morgan's expulsion pro
gramme.^ If executed it would instantly plunge the
South into conditions which would make the poverty
caused by their rebellion seem like luxury by com
pr.iison. . Â¦
The old Southern theory that no gentleman can
work with his hands is current among the rising
generation. There are no hands there to take up
pick and spade, hod and plow handles when the ex
pelled negroes would lay them down.
It is a hopeful sign that the South sees all this,
and some of its best men declare that though dis
franchised and shorn cf his political rights the negro
should be made to understand that his personal and
property rights will be protected as a means of keep
ing him where he is.
Tillman of South Carolina irldorses Morgan and
adds to the contempt in which the decency of the
country holds him by abusing Booker Washington,
who .is toiling to give the negro just the industrial
training which the interests of the South require that
her laboring population should have.
Morgan and Tillman are raising a new issue which
will divide the Southern people into two classes, oh
living by industrial development and the other by
political demagogy.

suspended by the Pilot Commission on ac
count of the wreck of the ill-fated Rio de
Janeiro, has been restored to â¢ his former
position.
The commission conducted an investiga
tion with special reference to the respon
sibility of Pilot Jordan for the disaster
and all available witnesses were exam
ined. In the light of what appeared dur
ing the investigation, Commissioners
Leale and Alexander say that they could
not return any, other verdict than one ab
solving Jordan from air blame. Commis
sioner. Pratt, "however, was opposed to the
restoration â¢ of Jordan on account of his
having . attempted to bring in the vessel
during a fog.
The vote was arrived at only after seven
meetings of tha Commissioners had been
held for the purpose of considering the
evidence. â¢ Elturts were made to have the
decision of the board unanimous, but Cap
tain Pratt could not be brought to see
that Jordan was not in a measure re
sponsible. , Â¦ Â¦
One -of the strongest points in Jordan's
favor was his excellent record and the
testimony of ship captains as to his skill
and caution. The evidence introduced in
connection with the Sequoia was also a
.determining factor in the decision. It was
shown that she had been steered a point
and a half higher than usual in order to
reach Lime Point and brought up at Fort
Point. This proved that the current on
the morning of the accident was unus
ually strong.
Captain Leale is preparing an opinion
on the evidence presented during the in
vestigation, in which Captain Alexander
will concur. All those immediately con
cerned in the matter, including the offi
cials of the Pacific Mail, are satisfied with
the finding of the board, and Jordan has
had his license Issued to him again.
After the vote had been decided, Jordan
was summoned before the commission and
informed of the result. He was cautioned
to observe 'the regulations by which the
pilbts are governed and not to enter or
leave port during a foe, regardless of the
interests of the ship of which he might
be in. charge.
When the decision of the Commission
ers became known, Jordan was given an
ovation by his friends and business asso
ciates.

by Judge Fritz, as it was proved that It
was not vitriol :, but potash that was
thrown. Then he swore, to the complaint
charging the woman with malicious mis
chief for damaging his overcoat with the
liquid. While on the witness stand yes
day he admitted that he had received $20
from the woman for the damage to the
coat and had given her a receipt and a
written agreement not to prosecute her."

that Cooper called Dougherty an offensive
name and Dougherty, who had a cane in
his hand, asked him "how will you have
it?" Then he struck him on the forehead
with the cane, inflicting a slight wound.
It was also admitted that Cooper made a

The oil men of Kern County have
changed their Hne of procedure in'the mat
ter of their complaint against the South
ern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroad com
panies, which have, so they consider,
made unjust and excessive rates for the
transportation of petroleum. Yesterday
they dropped a bombshell among trie Rail
road Commissioners, who were in session
discussing the situation. . "
Frank H. Short, an attorney of Fresno,
communicated with tbe Railroad Commis
sioners and stated that He had been en
gaged by the oil men to represent their
interests in the fight against the railroad
companies and that he would like to with
draw all documents heretofore tiled with
the commission by the oil men. He also
requested that the hearing set for yester
day be continued to some time convenient
to the Railroad Cornmisslonfrs, but not
later than the regular meeting of the
board in the month <jf May.
In the meantime Attorney Short will
file a fresh compla'.nt, to which he pre
sumes the railroad companies will prompt
ly reply and the matter can then be con
sidered by the board at its next meeting.
What this complaint will be is not
known and the attorney keeps his plans
very much to himself. Those who are
familiar with the situation claim that the
oil men should* have been represented by
an attorney long ago. They, cite as evi
dence the weak case the oil men presented
to the demurrer that the Southern Pa
cific Company filed yesterday. This docu
ment recites that the petroleum men in
their complaint to the Railroad Commis
sioners "do not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of complaint; that said
complaint and resolution are uncertain in
this, that it does not appear therefrom
what particular rate3 it is sought to have
reduced, or upon what ground it is
claimed that said rates or any thereof
are in excess of a fair, just and reason
able rate for the service rendered."
The Railroad Commissioners have grant
ed the petition of the Santa Fe Company
for permission to abandon, its track be
tween Santa Monica and Englewood. The
matter 'has been under consideration by
the Railroad Commissioners for some
time. They decided that the only course
open to them was to grant the request of
the railroad company, as it was able to
show that the track had not paid operat
ing expenses since it had been built.- The
Santa Monica residents are anxious to
have the track abandoned, as they will
then be sure of a now electric car service
being put in operation at once.

! yf^ APTAIN EDWARD A. REDDY
fl died yesterday afternoon at 4
(I . o'clock at the Almshouse, of
which he had been superintend
ent for six years past. He had
been in feeble- health since the middle.'oÂ£
last July, when he suffered a stroke of
paralysis, and for a week pa^st he had
been lying at the point of death. 0
Captain Reddy was one of the best
known men in the State. As a mining
man and as an office holder he came in
contact with many people, and all who
knew him cherished his friendship. He
was genial, kindly and generous even to
a fault, always ready lo assist a friend
at whatever sacrifice of his own time
or money.
His birthplace was Woonsocket, R. 1.
He came to California in 1861 when he
was but 16 years of age. He went at once
to Virginia City and worked in the mines
there, afterward to Aurora, Nevada, and
finally to Inyo County, this State. In the
early seventies he became part owner and
manager of the Cerro Gordo mine in that
county. His interests there were finally
sold to Senators Stewart and Jones of
Nevada for a sum reaching into the hun
dred thousands.
As a miner Captain Reddy had his ups
and downs. At times he was wealthy,
but always free-handed and careless of
his wealth and much given to mining
speculation; there were other times whu
he was In straitened circumstances.
General McComb, Warden of the State
Prison at San Quentin, made him captain
of the guard in 1SS4, and it was that office,
OIL MEN CHANGE
THEIR TACTICS
Night express train 9, from Los An
geles, was wrecked shortly after 1 o!clock
yesterday morning at a point on the coast
division between San Miguel and Bradley.
No lives were lost, but the accident is 011.1
of the most costly to the Southern Pacific
Company in the history of the road. Sev
en cars were destroyed by fire, ?25,O0O in
gold that was in Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
express safe is in the ruins and: most 1 of
the passengers' baggage went up insmoks.
D. 6. Mills was traveling on the train
in his. special car "Sacramento." His car
and two Pullmans were : saved from de
struction by fire through the kindly offices
of the passengers, who,' as soon as they
had gained their composure after the ac
cident, realized the dancer that the three
cars were in, uncoupliyl them and pus*ied
them out of the way of the flames.
James F. Higgins, express messenger,
had his leg* severely -bruised by the
shock when the car he was traveling in
left the track. Baggagemaster Watson
had one rib fractured. . The rest, of the
passengers on Â¦ the train escaped with a
few bruises, Â¦which bv railroad men is
looked upon as marvelous, considering the
speed at which the tram was running. .
Several passengers who were' on the
wrecked express arrived on the relief
train that reached this city at 5 o'clock
last night. They, say they were aroused
by the shock of the train leaving the
track. As soon as they could recover they
dressed and sot out of the cars. They
saw a weird sight. The mail, baggage and
the first day coach were not only derailed
but the two latter cars had run ud a side
hill and were lying on th'elr side more
than sixty feet above the track. They
were bursting into flames and soon after
ward a day coach and three tourist cars
caught fire. The engine was on the track
In its right position about 300 yards aheart
of the train/but the' tender, though still
attached . to - the. engine, was without
wheels and was overturned. The passen
gers after much difficulty released thÂ»j
last two Pullmans and D. O. Mills' car
and they were hauleri out of danger.
Blankets were taken from the cars and
the Injured and women and children were
made as comfortable as possible. '
The passengers complain that the South
ern Pacific Company was a long time re
sponding with a relief train and that they
were unnecessarily detained before bein?
brought to this cit^.
Manager Kruttschnitt says thatSthe ac
cident was most unfortunate and that no
one was to blame. It was caused througn
a broken flange on a front wheel of the
engine. The locomotive was a new one
and one of the best m: use on the coast
division. '. - . Â¦" Â¦ '" r
"We seem to be unlucky. on the new
coast division.' he saia. "It was an acci
dent that was nobodv's fault and is one
of the misfortunes tliat come with rail

That there were no lives lost is truly mar
velous and a source cf much relief to us."

which he filled most admirably, that gave
him. the title of captain. He served In
that capacity till 1891. For a year he was
an assistant coiner at the United States
Mint. He resigned that position to be
come superintendent of the Defiance mine
at Darwin, Inyo County, which belonged
to his brother, the late Colonel Patrick
Reddy of the firm cf Reddy, Campbell &
Metson Â¦' â¢
In 1895 Captain Reddy was appointed
Superintendent of the Almshouse by the
Board of Health selected by Governor;
Budd. So efficient was his administra
tion that when the political complexion
of the board changed he was left in
charge of the institution.
.During the six . years of his superin
tendency there was not a breath of
scandal concerning the affairs of the
Almshouse. Captain Reddy instituted
many reforms and innovations which en
deare8>him to the inmates of the Alms
house and made the institution a much
more efficient agent of public charity.
As a mining superintendent Captain
Reddy' s courage was put to severe tesl3
many times, and he became known all
along the mother lode as a man who
knew no fear. I It was that " reputation

Company Is Being Formed
to Sink the Well There
Meeting of Producers for Discussion
of Matters Important to Indus
try Will Be Held at
Palace.
A company Is about to be Incorporated
for the purpose of determining whether
there is oil to be struck by drilling on the
peninsula near San Francisco. The con
ditions attending the enterprise are of
general interest, and prominence is ac
cordingly given to the jfacts. In 1891-92
the San i rancisco Land and Improve
ment Company drilled j a well 1S17 feet
deep at Baden. During the panic season
of lt&J all v,ork was suspended, and since
that time no further effort has been made
to do anything -with the hole. F. C. Mc-
Pherscn, who drilled for the company,
has reported to Mr. Martin, the manager
of the Land and Improvement Company,
thai at various aeptns oily strata "were
pierced and that he wished to continue to
uriii deeper, but the directors oÂ£ tne com
pany aid not consent. JNlr. Martin said
yesterday that he expects to lorm a com
pany to determine a very interesting
question. The capital stock will be only
*2o,Â»wj. There will be no promoter's
s>tocK and no salaried officials. He
hopes to get business men to take
part in tne experiment, and says
thtit only enough snares will be sold to
insure a thorough test of the well. "I
reccRnize the fact," said Mr. Martin,
"that the enterprise is a gamble, pure and
simple, but the possibilities are so great
and the matter is of so much moment to
San Francisco, that I expect no trouble
in finding enterprising citizens enough
who will risk their money in a .venture
of this kind. As soon as we incorporate
w'e will push the work as fast as possi
ble."
Oil Men Gather at Palace.
The oil men of the Kern River and Mc-
Kittrick districts will meet in the marble
room of the Palace Hotel in this city to
morrow evening to discuss the situation in
its various aspects. The companies that
have been invited to send representatives
to the conference will probably all re
spond because of the importance of the
matters that may come up for considera
tion. Henry Ach has conferred with rep
resentatives of several companies since
he sent out invitations to the meeting.
The general sentiment is in favor of
united action among the large oil pro
ducers of the districts mentioned.
The excitement over possible oil discov
eries, according to the San Bernardino
Times-Index, is on the increase in the
de&ert. This paper says:
At Barstcw and Daesett beds are not to be
had at any price so great is the demand for
them, and a livery stable man is a person to
be approached with liowed head. Daggett is
the latest place to catch the Infection and al
ready the clumps of bunchgrass are outnum
bered by location stakes. At Kramer, where
tbe oil was iirst struck, workmen are rushing
to get a regular oil rig- for the purpose of
einking a fleÂ«p well. It is impossible to cor
rectly estimate the claims already staked out
as all have not been riicorded, but the area Is
large and still increasing. At Victor also there
are hundreds of locations, and while there are
; no wells down yet some will be begun very
i soon. Altogether the desert Is the liveliest
place in Southern California. Â¦
Another journal says that surveyors are
busy at all points on the desert between
Kramer, Daggett and Calico, on a tract
many miles wide, laying out claims for
parties in Los Angeles, San Bernardino
and other towns in Southern California.
Thousands of acres have also been located
on the Yuma desert, and in the region
about Walters, Salton and Indio. Parties
are sinking a well about eighteen miles
south of Walters.
The Folsom Telegraph says that there
is a rumor that the old Swain ranch and
other property in the Carson Creek dis
trict has been bonded by parties who
think there is oil in that district. '
I Number of "Wells in California.
i The Los Angeles Herald has been count-
I ing up oil wells in California and figures
out that there is only 21 per cent less
wells under the drill in this' State than
in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and
Indiana combined. The Herald says;
The Oil City Derrick's monthly oil report
shows for March 742 completed wells, of which
ISO were dry, havins a production of 10.343
barrels daily, in trie Pennsylvania, West Vir
ginia, Ohio and Indiana fields. Work under
way March 31 was: Rigs, 503; wells drilling,
ES3; total, 13S2. It is a notable fact that the
Herald's report of same date showed new 'pro
duction in California of 3124 barrels, or nearly
a third that of the four States covered by the
Derrick's report. This is the productive capac
ity of ninety-four completed wells, of 'which
eighteen were dry. Work in progress in Cali
fornia was shown by the Herald to be: Rigs,
235; wells drilling:, 69S; total, 933. This shows
that of wells drilling- March 31 there were in
California 79 per cent as many as in the com
bined fields cf Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Ohio and Indiana. The prolific sands of several
California fields have also kept the average
production of new wells very much higher than
that of Eastern fields. In the latter there were
562 productive wells brought in in March, of
an average production of 18% barrels a day,
while in California there were seventy-six new
wells, of an average production of 41 Â¦ barrels
a day.
Excitement in Arizona.
Most of the interest in the oil prospects
In Arizona would seem to be centered
about the Jerome field, north of Prescott.
Much of the land for a distance of about
twelve miles from Jerome Junction east
has been taken up, and' there are also
locations In the Black Hills divide, on
the Verde slope and in Lonesome Valley.
Indications are also reported to have been
discovered west of Tucson. AH over Ari
zona preparations are making to substi
tute oil for coal for fuel. The Prescott
Electric Company has made the change.
A number of the more important mines
in Yavapai County will cease to burn coal.
With the letting of the contract for the
grading of a railroad into the Sunset dis
trict, the prospects of that section are
materially bettered. The Bakersfleld Cali
toini&n reports that the indications are
that work will .be rushed in order that
the line may be completed before another
winter.
AV. E. Youle has gone East In connec
tion with a plan for the establishment of
a new refinery at Kern City for the man
ufacture of asphaltum. Ten men are con
cerned equally in the enterprise.
SEEK OIL IN NEW FIELDS.
Drills to Penetrate the Dry Bed of
Tulare Lake. ,
BAKERSFIELD. April 10.â It Is ru
mored here that prospecting tot oil in the
bed of Tulare Lake is about to be re
sumed. San Francisco capitalists are said
to be forming a syndicate wlth't"his end
m view. About a year ago elaborate plan3
were made for development work in the
bed of the lake, which has been dry for
several years, but before the plans hai
progressed far Theodore Bacigalupi, who
was at the head of the project, disposed
of his interests in that section and the de
velopment ceased. Â¦
A noted oil expert who exploited the
San Joaquin Valley fields several year3
aso when the oil excitement first began
expressed the opinion that beneath the
bed of this lake there would be found a
vast oil body. His theory was that as the
strata of matter underlying the surface
of the earth followed to a great extent the
Irregularities of the conformation of that
surface there would, exist under every
great depression a corresponding depres
sion in these strata. Naturally the trend
of fluid bodies would follow this depres
sion and the largest and most inexhausti
ble volumes would do found where the de
pression was deepest. On this theory he
argued that in a region Impregnated with
oil no spot offered better attractions for
the prospector than the dry bed of a lake,
but as the depression would bring the oil
bodies deeper than on ' the higher levels
it would be necessary to drill Â¦â¢ deeper in
order to find them. Whether this theory,
is correct may soon be learned.;
- HANFORD. April 10.â Some time ago it
was announced that Theodore Bacigalupi.
a capitalist of San Francisco, who owned
a big tract of land in the bed of Tulare
Lake would organize a company and bore
for oil there. A short time ago Bacigalupi
sold all his property in this county, in
cluding his lake land, and the project of
boring for oil there has been abandoned.'
Those who profess to know state that
there axe good oil indications in the vicin
ity of Tulare Lake and something may
yet be done to develop that territory.

NKW TCniC, April 10.â The speculation for
the sdvance was renewed In force to-day and
*.!ip r.wrkrt resumed much the same appear
rr.ee Â«ls it had during the excited speculation
'â¢{ lart week. London helped to this result by
tcoe rather emphatic advances in the lnter
rjjtlonal etocks lx>fore the opening here, which
*>>nÂ» perhaps incident to the fortnightly tPttie
jn'-nt now in progress on the London Stock
Kxchange. The market o:*ned here in a fairly
1-uoyant condition, the congested buying caus
ing running cales of -'several thousand chare
kUgcfca in a number of etoi-ks at the opening at
;-.<:vsnc<Â»s of from 1 to 2 points. This materially
Hgfcer level of prices attracted torae large ppII
ir.p to realize, snd the tone became rather
r>i nous for a while, as shown In the wide and
Hm|UÂ«Jlt fluctuarions in some of the prominent
Mlr^f. Hut the simulative leaders eeemed to
bÂ» again well supplied with resources, and
'tlÂ»oy supported the market with great confi
o.-nce and manipulated prices with much euc-
CCBBJ The stid Jen and violent advances
wÂ«H calculated to facilitate the multitude of
< i:tside f peculators, v.ho were very evidently
waiting so ocrae into the market ui>on any
â¢ :--finlte signs of a further advance. Monday's
ruction and the subsequent recovery evidently
rcrved'to convince many i>ersons that no lower
ini'-es v.eiv tu be espected for the present, and
iliat further advance might be reasonably
looked 'lor. It was demonftrated. In fact, that
the public is rtill wiilins: and eager to buy
Ft'w-kn. jictwithftanJing the high level of
l>rice!Â« measured hy the earning power, sa long
as prii-ej; <x>nt!nue to. go up.' Large speculative
!n*U. thÂ«rcicr\ find it worth wliiie to support
i-iioes and to advajice the market, even in the
:a>v of heavy offerings, owing to the large out
cide Ucnxand attracted by the advance in

the Government report, , due after trading
hours, hail been discounted by recent heavy
bear selling, there waa a disposition to remain
neutral until its contents were made known.
May opened unchanged to' Uc lower at 70 to
69%c und^r heavy selling caused > by. rain in
the Southwest where it is most needed. This
pressure did not last long, and in its absence
the market began a gradual recovery, touching
7'j^c during . tee forenoon. Driblets of "long
stuff came out and the market reacted to 70c
where it again steadied, this time on reports
of a good export demand. Shorts bid the mar
ket up to WÂ£. but an easier feeling followed,
as . only moderate cash sales â¢ could be con

Speculation in Wall Street.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews eays.
vnfl^r date of April 0:
"Wall Etreet has never before witnessed such
a clashing of impetuous realizing and whole
sale buying as has swayed the crowds of specu
lators during the past week. In spite of the
immense soles some of the largest advances
rwilized on any day in the boom took effect
upon Wednesday. Stories of -new amalgama
tions, neutralized the effects of the large liqui
dations and IJelaware and Hudson advanced
12 points and Chicago. Burlington and Quincy
w-ored a rise of 15 mints within twenty-four
hour?, while Rock Islnnd rose 12 points. Some
fif the realizing was done in the way of part
ing with other stocks to buy those thus advanc
ing.
"The market is drifting Into a stage of con
fusion that has injured many a boom in by
coniÂ» days. Operators are apt to lose their
head* la the sanguine excitement of their oper
ations. There is no possibility of keeping- track
i.f tho rapid changes in the distribution of
rtocks. and when men lose their knowledge of
the forces on the field they lose their confl
<lrnoe;. confusion sets in; then the situation
riiwns into ne rvousnoss : mistakes in tactics
are made, and the confusion may precipitate
heavy forced liquidation when* It is kittle ex
jxx'teVl. We are verging on a position which is
associated with a nigh degree of risk: and
ihrouphout the week there has been evidence
that operators who have made large profits
Â«re adopting means to secure themselves
.-Â¦gainst a scramble to sell."
Prunes and Apricots in New York.
Mail advices from New York say: "Spot
s-locks of all sizes of prunes excepting 70-SOs
and SO-Ws are very light and although some
new Roods are coming to hand the sizes most
wanted by the trade- are very hard to get.
Xfarly ail the prominent commission-houses
were alisoiuteiy without S0-60s yesterday and
i-tcx-kF of 40-iiOs and oO-70s are believed to be
little larger. What few 50-60* there are around
pro hel<l at 5" 8 Â©6o. This is equal to or better
than the equivalent of association prices on
this size. Goods to arrive, however, are avail
nlile at about less, and spine Ousiness is
doing on that basis. The larger jobbers all
have supplies en route from the coast sufficient,
it is believed, to last tliem several weeks, at
least. Then, according to Indications, the
traile v.ill likely be forced to buy association
BQ-Ata or switch off to other sizes. The 6pot
market on 40-iiOs Is firmer, sales in a Jobbing
way being made at 7VÂ«c in 25-lb boxes.
"'Evaporated apples are firmer and more ac
tive.. Sales of several cars of strictly prime
<iry goods were reported yesterday at 4%c, and
some holders late in the day asked up to 5c.
lU;>ort3 from the coast that the frost -has
Â¦lamngrd apricot proepicts caused considerable
interest in the trade, and there were rumors
that a speculative buying movement was In
r.TogTrss on the spot. This could not be con
firinPd, however, and little credence was placed
in the report."

pricej. The appearance of new lenders In the
money market, including some of the specu
lators Interested In the rise, has served to
again defer the exhaustion at money resources,
but the rate for call loans ran up above Mon
day's high level to 7 per cent to-day under the
requirement of the active speculation and of
some large financial operations, Including the
payment of another flO.000,000 Installment on
subscriptions to the Union Pacific collateral
bond Issue. The slightly firmer tone of sterling
exchange this morning indicated that any re
laxation in the rate would lift sterling back to
"ecld export point. Money was no higher In
London to-day, but payment must be made to
morrow there of an $18,000,000 installment on
the exchequer bond issue, and Friday is. the
l>ayday for the stock exchange settlement.
Some renewed pressure for gold on New York
is therefore to be expected. Meantime the sub
treasury continues to absorb cash, and New
York exchange at Chicago to-day fell to 50
cents discount, marking the continued demand
from the interior on New York for money.
The advance in the call loan rate helped to
precipitate a lively realizing movement during
the last hour, which cut into prices all around
and made the closing easy. The Burlington
deal . and. talk of a combination of interests
with the smelting interests looking to control
of the gold, silver and copper product was the
leading influences in the day's speculation so
far as it was due to any specific influence at
all. Burlington rose an extreme 6>4 to a new
record price at 192 and Northern Pacific came
within a small fraction of par. The whole
granger group was affected by sympathy, and
Northwest preferred made a notable advance
of 15 points, while St. Paul and Omaha rose 8
points. Amalgamated Copper gained 5% on
very large dealings and Anaconda 4VÂ». Texas
fend Pacific was largely bought at an advance
of 214 on talk of an exchange of two shares of
the stock for one of Missouri Pacific. As an
outgrowth of these movements the' grangers
and Eries were all strong and active. Special
features of strength were Consolidated Gas,
which rose 7%; Brooklyn Union Gas, 4; Gen
eral Electric, 6, with a reaction of 5; Tobacco,
3%: ex-dividend Pullman,' 3*i. and Chicago
Terminal Transfer preferred, 6%. Evansville
and Terre Haute Jumped 5 points, allowing for
al'/j per cent dividend.
The bond market was moderately active and
higher. .Total sales, par value, $3,755,000.
U. S. refundin? -s advanced VÂ» and the old 4s
registered and the new 4s, % per cent on the
last call.

The wool market Is decidedly quiet and a
very marked falling off in the volume of busi
ness Is noticeable. The large consumers have
apparently supplied their needs for - the time
being, and although quite a number of the
smaller mills have been in, they have taken
on only small lines, the aggregate of which
is figured at 3,608,000 pounds. This quieter
condition of affairs was not unexpected and is
not unnatural, after the enormous business
previously transacted. It would have been
strange- indeed if such a pronounced activity
had been longer maintained in view of the
fact that the great bulk of the purchasing
was ; for consumption. Probably not a pound
of the large total given last week was bought
for speculation. - .
Although there has been such a marked
falling off in the volume. of trade there is no
weakening whatever in prices.
The sales for the week in Boston amounted
to 3,393,000 pounds domestic and 215,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 3.608,000 against a
total of 11.485,000 for the previous week and a
total of 3,692,900 for the corresponding week
last year.
The sales since January 1. amount to 68,
734,900 pounds, against 47,421.900 pounds for
the corresponding time last year.

the general average of condition, 91.7, Is the

Condition of the Treasury.
Ntjj York Money Market.
Â¦The stock market here generally was irregular.
Interest centered in the American shares, which
were active and buoyant from start to finish.
The local impulse to ouy was encouraged when
New York responded U the highest level of
prices we had set before the opening in Wall
street. The favorite American -stocks were
Atchison, Missouri Pacific, Kansas and Louis-'
ville, in which the contango rates at the set
tlement of to-day were 6@5H- The rate for
Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul, Denver and
Rio Grande, New York Central, Illinois Cen
tral and for Northern Pacific was 3Â»Â£ per cent.
Northern Pacific is scarce on account of the
deposit of stock to be exchanged for certificates.
Anacondas were 10V 2 on Boston -advices. Money
was steady.

"NOBBY" CLARKE WANTS
TO BE A POLICEMAN
Alfred Clarke, ..otherwise .known as
"Nobby" Clarke,' at one time a member of
the police force of this city, has" filed a
petition for a writ of mandate to compel
the Board of Police Commissioners to re
store him to his position on the force,
from which he resigned December 31, 1887.
In his complaint Clarke recites that he
was appointed fc member of the force De
cember 3, 185G, and reappointed February
1. 1869, when the McCoppin reorganization
law went into effect. He studied law and
was admitted to the bar. and finally, at
the request of the Board of Supervisors,
he took charge of the litigation growing
out of the laundry ordinance and succeed
ed in collecting $60,000 for the city.
On December 31, 1SS7, Clarke was com
pelled to resign from the force on account
of congestion of the brain. . At that time,
he alleges, he had an understanding with
Mayor Hammond that he should have the
privilege of withdrawing his resignation
in event he regained his health. -He says
he is now, "by the grace of God," a sound
man and having no other means of sup
porting himself and family desires to be
reinstated to his old position. :
Clarke avers that he is unable to com
ply with the civil service regulations, so
he invokes the aid of the Tyrrell. law to
regain his position.
ATHLETES RESCUED- FROM
DANGERS OF THE DEEP
Phil Wand, Alec Pape and J. Dukelow,
three well known athletes and members of
the Olympic Club, had a narrow escape
from drowning in the bay yesterday.. They
were rescued from almost certain death
by soldiers stationed at Alcatraz Island.
Early j'esterday morning Wand, Pape
and Dukelow left the Dolphin boathouse
in . a sailboat. Their destination was Ti
buron, and their passage to that spot was
without Incident. In the afternoon' they
started on their homeward journey and
before they had gone many . miles were
wishing themselves on shore .again. The
bay had roughened and their boat was
tossed about like a cockle-shell. Â¦ 'Although
Pape and Wand are good sailors, they be
came extremely nervous. They had to
lower the sail and both bent to their oars,
but the incoming tide and the choppy sea
made rowing useless. Strive as they did
they could" make no headway, and were
in danger of. capsizing every minute.
Dukelow thought his last hour had come
and wrote a note â¢ which he expected
would â¢ be picked up if he met death by
drowning.
Fortunately the boat was carried by the
tide to the lee of Alcatraz Island and
with great effort the trio managed to
draw nearer shore.
The soldiers saw their predicament and
willing- hands dragged the wet and be
draggled athletes to shore. They were
in a pitiable state. Soldier clothes were
given them to wear while their own were
drying, and hot coffee -was made for them
They returned to this city on the General
McDowell. \

Advises Embroynic Teachers to Be
Guided by Principles in Per
forming Their Work.
"Some Greek Teachers" was the subject
of an Interesting address delivered yes
terday afternoon to the pupils of the Nor
mal School on Powell street by John Mc-
Naught. The speaker advised the embry
onic teachers to be guided by principles
and to pursue their duties in the educa
tional field with the same Indomitable
fortitude as the philosophers of Greece
who, although surrounded by opponents
and enemies, did not hesitate to promul
gate their doctrines and theories, some of â¢
which revolutionized the governments of
the world. In Illustration of this he stat
ed that the theoryâ the greatest ever con
ceived by the mind of man â that govern
ments should be based on the intelligence
of the citizens, was first discovered by one
man and he, by persistent. efforts, taught
it to the world.
The address throughout was received
with close attention by the pupils, and at
its conclusion the speaker was warmly
applauded.
JOHN McNATJGHT TAI^S
TO NORMAL SCHOOL PUPILS
Mrs. Catherine Coarum, -wife of a- west
Indian cook now at sea on the Umatilla,
shot Charles McDanlels, or Dennlson, a
night watchman, to death at her home,
1133% Clay strcet,\ at an early hour yes
terday morning. \She was Intoxicated
when she committed the crime, and has
not yet been able to give a lucid account
cf the occurrence or the causes that led
up to the tragedy.
Persons living in the vicinity of the old
houso occupied by Mrs. 1 Coarum reported
to Policemen Ward and Roediger In the
morning that there had been trouble and
that shots had been fired in the house dur
ing the night. The officers got no response
to knocks, but effected an entrance through
through the wlndowof an adjoining house.
Mrs. Coarum was found sitting in the
kitchen drinking beer. She was In a hys
terical condition, 1 and at once came for
ward and told rtie policemen that she had
killed "Charlie," and that he was In the
basement. ' . .. .
McDaniels* body was found In the base
ment, reclining against a pile of sand.
One bullet had struck him under the left
shoulder blade, another In the right
shoulder, and a third made a slight wound
In the right leg. The first had caused
death.
The Woman's Story.
The woman claims that McDaniels came
to her house early in the evening while
she was out, and broke in at the front
door. After she- came home he went to
a corner grocery and bought a bottle of
beer and a flask of whisky. Mrs. Coarum
thought that was about 8 o'clock, but the
grocer, John Rohde,' says it was 10:30. The
shooting is supposed to have occurred
about midnight. â¢
The woman asserts that McDaniels had
threatened previously to kill her. Ho had
started to go upstairs and had said she
must go with him. She took his revolver,
which, he had laid on the kitchen table.

Yesterday morning, noon and night
there was only pleasure for the Macca

During the early part of the day Su
preme Record Keeper Siegel, under the
guidance "of George V. Leroi of San Fran
cisco Tent, J. C. Freeman of Golden West
Tent, Dr. A. J. Hiniker of Pacific Tent and
State Commander S. W. Hallj was taken
for a drive over the city, the park and
the ocean beach, so that on his return to
his home in Port Huron, Mich., he could
tell of the wonders of the city by the
Golden Gate. In the evening he was the
guest of. honor at a banquet tendered him
in one of the downtown rotisseries and
later, in company of Sir Knights Leroi,
T. J. Harris, G. L. Morgan. J. H. Boyer,
A. J. Hiniker and S. W. Hall/ with Ser
eeant J T. Green, there was a visit to the
Chinese quarter. The visiting, supreme
record keeper expressed himslf as pleased
at what he saw and with the hospitality
of- the local sir knisrhts. . â¢ .â¢ .
Last night Supreme Commander Lady
Lillian M. Hollister of Michigan and Su
preme Picket Lady Walker of Los Angeles
were tendered a reception in the maplv
hall of the Palace. They were greeted by
more than three hundred members of the
hives of this city. Oakland and Sacra

and shot toward him as he stood on the
stairs, intending, she says, only to fright
en him. He staggered to the bottom of
the stairs, and asked her to help him out
where he could get a breath of fresh air.
She helped him out through the kitchen
and down a flight of steps to the base.
ment and left him propped up against the
wall. According to her story she went
back to the kitchen and sat alone till
morning, when she went into the base
ment and found that McDaniels was dead
The police believe that the shooting oc
curred In the kitchen, as there are no
blood stains in the little hallway or on
the stairs. It is their belief that McDan
iels died almost Immediately, and that
the woman dragged the body into the
basement with the intention at first of
concealing it In the sand.
The body of the murdered man was
taken to the Morgue, and Mrs. Coarum
was taken to the City Prison and a charge
of murder placed ngatnst her.- She sobs
hysterically, and says over and over:
"Poor Charlie, 1 didn't mean to dr> It.
My poor husband, what will he think!"
Mrs. Conrum Is 47 years old. She mar
ried Joseph Conrum. or Joseph Knight, as
he is generally known, twenty-seven vears
ago in Liverpool. Her husband, who is
a mulatto, will be In port with the Uma
tilla within a few days. â¢
Came From Seattle.
The Coarums came to San Francisco
frcm Seattle six years ago. About four
years ago the woman became acquainted
with McDaniels, or Dennison, who has
been night watchman for Davis, Schon
wasser & Co., the dry goods merchants.
Since that time he wa^ a frequent visitor
at her house, and she was in his room at*
421 Powell street almost daily. She says
that "Charlie" was jealous of her and
threatened often to kill her, her husband
and himself.
E. G. Schonwasser. of Davis, Schon
wesser & Co., yesterday identified the re
volver with which the crime was com
mitted as one which the firm had given to
the watchman.
â¢ Ex-Judge Webb recognized Mrs. Coar
um at the City Prison as a former tenant
of his in Seattle. He says that she worked
hard there as a washerwoman. She at
tempted once, when intoxicated, to com
mit suicide by slashing her wrists, but
she was discovered in time and her life
saved.
McDaniels. the victim of the tragedy, is
given a good name for sobriety and in
dustry. He was considerably younger
than. Mrs. Coarum.
BREMERHAVEN. April 10.â It is offi
cially announced that two bars of gold
were stolen during the voyage of the
North German Lloyd steamer Kaiser Wil
htlm der Grosse, which left New York
April 2 and arrived at Cherbourg April 9.
The company has offered a reward of
10,000 marks for their restitution or for
the discovery of the thieves.
The directors of the company have ap
parently learned nothing definite as to
when or where the theft of the bars took
place. Captain Englebart of the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grosse is of the opinion that
the gold was stolen at either New York
or Southampton. The police here, as a
result of their inquiries, think the rob
bery was probably committed in New
York.
NEW YORK, April 10.â The robbery at
sea of the specie room of the North Ger-
L'.t-yd liner Kaiser Wllhelm der Grosse
remains a mysterious crime. .Apparently
there had been complete failure either
to locate the missing gold bullion or the
men who took It, although the search of
passengers and ship at Bremen again this
morning may furnish material for the in
vestigations. The advices to Oelrichs &
Co., r.gents for the company, came in
German and on the point as to whether
the specie room was broken open or en
tered by picking the lock admit of trans
lation either way. . .. â¢
The specie room of the Kaiser Wllhelm
der Grosse is iron bound and almost as
strong as a vault. The bars of gold were
packed in oak casks bound with iron
hoops. -Thousands of dollars in gold were
within the reach of the man who forced
hi? way into the strong room, but only
the sum named was taken. At the office
of the North German Lloyd agents this
morning the following statement was

"Three bars of gold, valued at $22,750,
were taken from the specie room of the
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse somewhere
between here and Cherbourg. The bars
were taken from cask No. 4, but we have
no idea. as to how the robbery was ac
complished. Our advices are but brief
and do not show how the room was en

derstand it was insured, but the question

We have not recovered the gold, and this

Horace G. Platt had been spoken of as
the- possible president of the Pacific Im
provement Company. On the arrival of
George Crocker in this city several weeks
ago the rumor was at once dispelled by
Crocker, who, in his blunt way, said that
he was. the president of the Pacific Im
provement Company and that he felt per
fectly capable of attending to the duties'
of the position. The appointment of
Platt as the attorney of the company
comes as a pleasant surprise to his many
friends, as in addition to his other accom
plishments he is regarded as a very able
I lawyer.
NEW YORK, April 10.â It came to light
to-day that a man supposed to be Albert
Jensen, who attempted to commit suicide
by twice shooting himself in the head
while being pursued by a crowd on West
street yesterday, is not Jensen at all and
Is wanted by the Government authorities
in this country and Sweden. He is in
reality John Albert Skoog, a Swede, S3
years old, born in Stockholm, and the son
of a prominent and wealthy family. He
early began a criminal career and is pro
nounced by officials of the United States
, secret service to be the most expert coun
! terfe'.tcr alive.
In March, 1897, he escaped from the pen
itentiary at Jollet, .III., while serving a
sentence there for making* and passing
counterfeit $20 bills. Chief Hazen of the
secret service department . has a bench
warrant for Skoog's arrest which had
been issued from the United States Cir
cuit Court for the Northern District of
Illinois. Skoog is wanted in Sweden for
making and passing a large number of
counterfeit 100 kroner notes, such as are
issued by the Bank of Sweden.
â¢ This work was done early in 1S99. Skoog
having gone to Sweden at once after his
escape from Juliet.
One of the biggest raids in the history
of the secret service was made to-night
by Chief Hazen as a result of the arrest
of Skoog. Mr. Hazen after talking with
Skoog to-day and after following a clew
which he found in Skoog's pocket went
to a building in Grand avenue, Brooklyn,
and arrested Emile Mobert, a Swede.
One of the most complete counterfeiting
plants ever found was discovered in tbe
house. The long- sought plates for the
50-kroner notes of the Bank of Sweden
and the 100-kroner notes of the Bank of
Copenhagen were among those found.
They were buried awav with other plates
for the making of a Â£2f) note of the Bank
of Scotland, which, it Is said, the secret
service of Great Britain has been trying
to run down.

THE "chief topic among railroad men
yesterday ' was the news that
Horace G. Platt, the well-known
attorney and club man, had been
[ . appointed attorney of the Pacific
Improvement . Company. This step was
taken by President George Crocker and
W. H. Crocker of the Pacific Improvement
Company last Saturday and all arrange
ments are being made for the new ap
pointee to assume his responsible duties.
Ever since the forming of the Pacific Im
provement Company and the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company the interests of
the two corporations have been so closely
identified that the legal business of the
Pacific Improvement Company has always
been attended to by the law department of
the Southern Pacific Company.
With the recent change in the ownership
of the Southern Pacific Company this
community 'of interests has ceased and it
was deemed a matter of business pru
dence that the Improvement company
should take its legal business out of the
hands of the Southern Pacific law depart
ment.
Horace G. Platt was rather reluctant to
talk about his appointment yesterday, but
admitted that he would In the future look
after the Pacific Improvement Company's
legal business. " . â¢
â¢"Wen, yes, I am the newly appointed
attorney . for the Pacific Improvement
Company," he said, "and am to take
charge at once. The business will be con
ducted from my office. The work is not

Spoclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Apni 10.â The Rev. James
M. Pullman, brother of the late George
M. PullmaJi. ca'used a sensation in the
New York East Coi.ference of the Meth
odist Church to-day by delivering a sting
ing speech about the evils of trusts. The
meeting was held in the Hanson Place
Methodist Kviscopal Church. Mr. Pull
man is the presiding elder of the New
England Conference. His station is Lynn,
Mass.
He declared that the rapid growth of
trusts was fast eating away the vitality
of the nation. This pernicious system, he
eaid, was fast depopulating the towns of
New England, formerly so thrifty and
prosperous, and he predicted that unless
steps were taken to check the trusts
many of the manufacturing towns of his
6ection of the country would be ruined
beyond repair In ten years.
The speaker charged the trust magnates
with closing- many factories by taking
away the manufacturing industries. To
corner the market on everything was
their Idea, he said.

LABOR TROUBLES
STOP A FUNERAL
Hackmen Refuse to Follow
Band and the Cortege
Separates.
Musicians Found to Be Members of
Union Not Recognized by Driv
ers After Procession Is
Under Way.
A funeral parade came down Kearny
street from the Italian quarter yesterday
afternoon led by a band playing a funeral
march. The Italian Carbiniers, gorgeous
in bright uniforms ar.d flamlnc plumbs,
kept stately step to the music of tho
band. The hearse awl ten carrlases fol
lowed. Just in front of the Hall of Jus
tice a horde of hack drivers swept down
upon the parade, split it in two. turned
the hearse and carriages down Clay
street and let the musicians and fierce
Carbiniers drift alonj Kearny street In
funeral parade minus n corpse.
Two days ago Antonio Salerna. who re
sided at 1312 Kearny street, died. He was
a prominent member of the Italia Rtoli
Carbinier! Mutual Aid Society and t:ie
order decided to burv him with all honor.
Accordingly a band was engaged and after
the ceremonies at Garibaldi Hail the pro
cession started ami then came the
trouble.
It was all a question of unionism. Th*
band was non-union and the hackmea
held up their brotheis in the drivers*
seats of the hearse and carriages anJ
threatened dire vengeance If they contin
ued in the wako of the "scab" band.
There was an interval of wild gesticu
lating on the part of the Italian under
taker and his "assist ir.ts and hot replies
in hackman vernacular. The undertaker
in desperation offered bonuses of $10 ami
even $15 to the drivers If they would pro
ceed, but it was all in vain. The hear*e
stood stock still and the mourners peereJ
out from behind drawn curtains, per
plexed by the delay and the evident ex
citement in the crowd about them. Byt
the non-union band marched boldly on
and the Carbiniers followed majestically,
unconscious that Hamlet had drooped nut
of the play.
When the undertaker found there was
no alternative he consented that the pro
cession should proceed without the band.
The hearse and line ot carriages were
driven down Clay street to Montgomery
and started on the way to Laurel Hill
Cemetery.
The band and Carbiniers reached Pine
street, on Kearny, before their predica
ment dawned upon them. Then they werÂ«
halted and presently when Joe Valente,
the undertaker, came un there was more
gesticulating and rapid fire of Italian
verbiage.
The band could not lead a procession
that refused to follow and the military
with the fierce mustaches and bright red
plumes could not parade without a band â
that was certain. Tho funeral was over
so far as they were â¢ oncerned. Banners
were unfurled, badge* of mourning dis
carded and the band led the way up
Kearny street, back up the hill Into the
Italian quarter, playing the Washington
Post march, the Carbiniers hot-footing it
after them in time with the jauntiest of
quicksteps.
Joseph Valente of the firm of Valente.
Marini & Co.. undertakers, says that the
band wa* hired by t'ue secretary of the
Italian Carbiniers and that the under
standing was that it was a union organi
zation. One of the musicians displayed a
union card upon ch#i!enge of the hack
men, but none of the others could do so.
Some who are Tiot friencilv to Valente %ay
that he, as president of the Italia Re.ili
Carblnieri. hired tho band and that he
was warned before the procession starter
that it was "scab" and that the hack
men would not be allowed to drive be
hind It.
Some o? the musicians were merab*T9 of
the Pacific Coast Musicians' Union, but
the Musicians' Protective Union is thÂ»
only organization recognized by othe*
unions.
Valente asserts that a rival firm of un
dertakers caused all his trouble bv enll3t
injr the hackmen in the scheme to hold up
the procession. The rival firm denies It.
In any event the Hackmen'a Union ha.-i
not had such a triumph since its victory
over Beylard of coaching fame.

Special Dispatch . to The Call,
SEATTLE, April 10.â Charles Brown, a
recent arrival in this city from San Fran-"
Cisco, committed suicide by taking poison
last night between 1L and 1 o'clock, in his
room in a Fourth avenue lodging-house.
He was last seen alive at 11 o'clock, when
he retired to his room. The poison used
was arsenic, of which he had a large
quantity.
Brown came to Seattle last' Friday on
the steamer "Walla Walla. 1 He was ac
companied by A. -Macdonald. who rooms
in the adjoining hou&e. : Macdonald has
known Brown but a short time, having
become acquainted with him while coming
up on the steamer. . . .
. Brown was about -is years of age. He
is supposed to have a family In California
as he was frequently heard to refer to
them. He was a prospector and It was
his intention to go out into the mineral
regions of this State as soon as spring
opened. No reason can be assigned for hio
suicide. â¢ â¢ ' Â¦ 'Â¦ .
Brown's effects consisted of a trunk, a
pocketbook containing $1 13 and some let
ters from California. These were taken
charge of by the Coroner and , an effort
will be made to locate Brown's relatives
in the south. Macdonald knows nothing
whatever of the dead man's relatives. In

This contains phosphate of potash In

This product makes from albumen the

In no way can this jray matter be
made except by the action of phosphate

It comes from Nature's laboratory, and

Fuspected, it will favor the products of

CORONER'S JURY
CHARGES MURDER
Testimony Shows Cordes
Took Aim at the Men
He Shot.
According to the story told -yesterday by
the witnesses at the Coroner's inquest,
John Cordes had made up his mind to
kill Kittie Kisel, "clean .out" the saloon
at 530 Pacific street,* where she worked
selling" 'dfirilfs "on . commlssfon" to" drunken
sailors and then to kill. himself. He lired
two shots at Kittie, but' his aim was bad.
He had better luck, however, with the
next shots, for each of the three bullets
fired entered a man, causing-the death of
two and seriously injuring the third.
"Paul Jones, seafaring man, Fred Polsen,
sailor,- and Charles Nelson,- the bartender
of the saioon, agree J as: to the vital facts
of the double murder; - They saw Kittie
running through the barroom with Cordes
following and shooting, at , her. After she
had disappeared into the street, Cordes
turned to the left and shot John Carlson,
who was standing. outside of the bar; then
he shot Peter Sjorgren; then he wheeled
to the rear' and shot 'the third man, who
was trying -to get under cover beind the
bar. After shooting the men, Cordea
placed the muzzle of the pistol against
his â¢ right \ temple and -.pulled, the trigger
several times, but. -there being no more
cartridges in the revolver, there was no
discharge.
Carlson died in the ambulance on the
Â¦way to the Harbor Hospital, and Sjorgren
died last Monday.- the shooting having oc
curred at 1 o'clock on the Thursday morn
nig previous.
â¢ Kittie Eisel testified that she had been
living with Cordes , for eight years,
and had always had trouble with him be
cause of his bad temper and quarrelsome
disposition. He often threatened to kill
her. They bought some property recently
in Alameda County and went to reside
there, but they could not make a living,
and he declared that he would not go to
work. Finally, the place having been
mortgaged for $400, she proposed that she
should go to work in the Pacific-street
dive, and ha consented.- - - - -
The last quarrel they had was over the
proposed sale of the property. Cordes
came to the saloon and after a few words
placed his right hand into his overcoat
pocket, saying: ! "I'm a thoroughbred and
I can fix all the people in this house: I've
got you now." He drew the revolver, but
it fell to the floor, and she ran screaming
through the barroom into the street with
Cordes in pursuit shooting at' her.
The jury returned a verdict charging
Cordea with murder." â¢
Major Blakeney Sued.
| Major Blakeney of the Life-saving Sta
tion was sued yesterday in-,the Justices'

ARE PREPARING
FOR CONCLAVE
DEATH BROUGHT
BY BOY'S HAND
Orson West Killed Through
Redmond Johnson Turn
ing Lever.
Redmond Johnson, a bright-faced little
boy in knickerbockers and nine and a half
years old, told the Coroner's jury yester
day that it was by his hand that .Orson
C West came to his death in the Phelan
bunding- elevator last Monday night.
The testimony of the witnesses was that
Alfred L. West, a son of the victim,
stepped ' into the elevator first. Waiting
behind him were his father and Edward
>>. Borg. Just as the cider- West stepped
upon the floor of the cage, the elevator
went up at full speed, crushing him
against the second floor. Hugh M. Cam
eron,- 20 years old, and -in charge â¢ of -the
e!tvator. reversed the lever and brought
the elevator half way. down to the start
ing point, and the injured man fell' to' the
bottom of the well.
Cameron said he : saw Mr. Borg waiting
to outer the cage after Mr. West, that
he did not have . hold .of . the lever and
that the elevator ascended at full speed
as the elder Mr. West was- stepping
into it. â¢ â¢ " . Â¦ Â¦ :> , â¢ Â»â â¢
Redmond Johnson, j the Innocent cause
ot ttie old" man's death, was very nervous
and very much frightened when he took
the witness chair. He said he had gone
into the elevator with his father, who re
quested him to wait until, he returned.
"I* pushed the lever 'with -..my arm,' and
it went up as Mr. West was going on "
bÂ« said. "I didn't think it- was danger
ous." Â¦ ; â¢ / Â¦
"You pushed it accidentally, didn't
you?" inquired the Coroner.
"Xo. sir. I pushed it with my arm, but
I cidn t think anybody would get hurt "
The jury returned a verdict that Orson
C West was accidentally wued Â»>â¢*â¢*Â«Â«
elevator of the Phelan building, "and we
censure the owner of said bulldmir tor
permlttins idlers to ride in the elevator

CONFERENCE CO MMITTEE
ON PRESIDENT'S VISIT
Attorney "W. W. Foote, when reprimand
ed yesterday afternoon by Superior Judge
Dunne, for being ten minutes late when
court convened, took occasion to . "talk
back" and was promptly fined $50 In "good
and lawful gold coin of the United States
of America."
Foote had entertained General Fitzhugrh
Lee and the soldier's daughter at lunch
and reached the courtroom at 2 : 25 p.m.
Instead of 2:15, the' hour for reconvening.
The trial of Robert E. Glaze on a charge
of murder was delayed pending the ar
rival of the defendant's leading counsel,
and Judge Dunne took occasion to warn
Foote that a repetition of the offense
would be punished. â¢ .
"Your Honor kept me waiting three
quarters of an hour^he other morning,"
retorted Foote angri*V :
"I was detained on official business,"
was the reply of the Judge, "and in any
case I am not called upon to make an
explanation to you."
'â¢Well, you kept me waiting Just the
same," retorted Foote.
"I don't wisn any argument on the mat
ter." said Judge Dunne in an angry tone,
"and if counsel keeps the court waiting
again -I shall take steps to punisn. the
otfense."
"Xour Honor can take any steps you
think fit," sneered Foote.
"You are lined $50 for contempt of court,
Mr. Foote," was the answer of Judge
Dunne, "to be paid in good- and lawtui
gold coin of the United states .ot Ameri
ca, and in default of payment you will
go to jail at the rate of one day for each
two dollars."
"Will your Honor grant me an appeal?"
said Foote.
Judge Dunne did not vouchsafe a re
ply, but ordered that the trial of Glaze
proceed. When court adjourned, Foote de
fied the Deputy Sheriff to take him Into
custody, and loudly proclaimed that he
would defend himself if the deputy laid
hands on him without a writ of attach
ment from the Judge.
Clerk Mahony hurried to the chambers
of Judge Dupne to secure the attachment,
when i^oote, -thinking discretion" was the
better part of valor, reluctantly parted
himself from two "twenties" and one
"ten" and the .incident was closed.
Silent Witnesses in Court.
Strong "testimony was introduced at the
trial ot Glaze yesterday by the prosecu
tion, and the evidence was unimpeached
by cross-examination.
Silent witnesses of the killing of Wil
liam Trewhella were brought Â¦ into court
by the prosecution and introduced as evi
dence. The leaden messengers of death,
lired by Glaze into the body of his part
ner, were marked as "exhibits."
The jury also saw the bullet-torn,
clothes of the victim of the tragedy,
stained deeply with his life's blood. The
revolver used by Glaze was also in evi
dence, together with the box of cartridges
purchased by him an heur before the
hemicide.
Strong links in the case of the prosecu
tion were welded in court yesterday. D.
A. Calisher. who ran the saloon of the
Windsor Hotel on January 14, corrobor
ated O'Connor, the bellboy, in the state
ment that he, Calisher, had sent O'Con
nor to find Trewhella and secure from
him some lemons. Calisher told how he
had heard shots fired before he had time
to mix a cocktail ordered by the bellboy
for a guest.
J. J. Wren, a clerk at Curtin's dry
gÂ«ods store, testified to hearing shots, and
upon opening a window which command
ed the interior court of the Windsor Ho
tel, he saw Glaze emptying a pistol and
walking Into the kitchen with the wear
j>on in his hand.
' Jennie Martin, who was employed as a
waitress at the hotel on the day of the
shooting, testified that Trewhella had
lurch about 1 p. m. on that day, and that
Glaze looked into the dining-room once
or twice. The witness further testified
that she saw Trewhella standing in the
kitchen near the door, shortly before she
heard the sound of shots. The witness
described the position of Trewhella's body
when she, in company with other wait
resses, ran into the kitchen^from the din
ing-room. She told of seeing a cigar un
der Trewhella's hand, and was positive
she did not see any weapon near the body.
O'Connor Corroborated.
Miss Ada Lawrences who was a wait
ress at the hotel on the day of the homi
cide, testified that she served Trewhella
with lunch on the fatal day. -â¢ , Â¦Â¦ â¢ â¢
"I came into the kitchen with a tray of
dishes," continued the witness, "and saw
Trewhella leaning against the small table
near the door. He was talking.to O'Con
nor, the bellboy. I heard O'Connor ask
Trewhella for some lemons. . I went to
the sink to wash my plate3 and my back
was toward the speakers. Then I heard
the shots fired. I ran into the dining
room and all the girls ran upstairs. We
came down again and entered the kitchen.
I saw the prostrate man at the foot of the
stairs. The hat was over the face. S I
liftecl the hat and saw the man was Trew
hella. He was gasping for breath at the
time. I saw no weapon near him. A
number of people came running from the
hotel into the court at the time I
speak of."
H. Justins, clerk for the Skinner Com
pany. 416 Market street, testified to sell
ing Glaze a box of cartridges on January
14. shortly before noon. He told how Glaze
had a revolver wrapped up in paper and
asked to have it loaded. Witness testi
fied how he had found the revolver was In
need of repairs and so informed Glaze.
"He asked me to fix it." said the wit
ness, "and said a pistpl shpuld be!n good
condition. He said if a man needs a
gun he needs it badly. ' I oiled the pistol
and shot it off in the cellar. Glaze tried
the pistol when it was unloaded."
The witness identified the revolver and
the cartridges mentioned in his testimonv.
Detective McMahon testified to going to
the Windsor Hotel on the day of the
shooting of Trewhella and finding five
empty cartridge cases near the door of the
old -bakery. ,
Kdward McCormick. a druggist at 1016
Market street, testified that on the day of
the shooting a man came into the drug
store and told him that .a shooting had
taken place at. the Windsor Hotel. ' Mc-
Cormiek stated that he telephoned to Dr
McMahon and went to the hotel. He told
of finding Trewhella in a dying condition
and said the wounded man died while he
the witness, was examining his wounds
McCorralcit was positive that no weapon
was on the ground near where Trewhella
v.as reclining. ; " â¢ ' â¢
Evidence of Autopsy Surgeon.
Coroner Leland, v. T ho was autopsy sur
geon at the time of the- shooting, gave
elaborate evidence as to the course the
bullets took in Trewhella's body. Dr. Le
land used Assistant District Attorney
Grcany as ajnodel and showed the jury
the coume of the five bullets.. Four of
them, cut from Trewhella's body by Dr
Iceland, were then introduced in evidence
The fifth bullet was left in the body, as
in order to secure, it the autopsy surgeon
would have had to sever the head . from
the corpse. 3 _; \ -
Deputy Coroner Brown testified to going
to the Windsor Hotel on January 14 at 3
p. m. and finding the body of Trewhella.
â¢Witness told of searching the body, but no
weapon was in the pocket or near the re
mains. - A bunch of keys was found by
