public functions . of " to.-day . was :
noticed' and freely, commented

Governor was at his ranch near :
Los Angeles, if no.t. actually- in the city.
A dozen different reasons have been given ;
for the .executive's absence, the true one !
being; a clash between Gage and- those in :
charge of the arrangements here over the j
usual questions of courtesy. . ...{. '.
iThe Governor declares .. he', has . been f
slighted, arid 'to .prove it he says he' has '
received no invitatiin'to take part in any !
Of the functions 'pertaining to the recep- \
tion" of th'e~ President. " He thinks, too, t
there was ari a'ttenlpt/on' the part-iof his j
old-time enemy, ' Otis,' who has" had a [

United. States Secret Service Agent George Foster had.
charge o?, the detectives who guarded the President during his
visit to the Soldiers' Home. .-Ajnong his rnen were four detec
tives belonging to the Los Angeles department. As the Presi
dential party, was about to leave the dining-room these men
were sent ahead by Fester to clear the. way to the cars and
only, the latter and Special Agent Criroin remained behind to
protect the guests from. AVashington. It was at this time that
tha pickpocket tackled Mr,- Moore's pocket. He was standing
in the center of a number of people when he felt a hand In
serted in the .pocket . which contained his pocketbook and he
knew that as the thief withdrew his fingers the purse went
along witn> It. Moore glanced over his shoulder and saw the
fellow .who had robbed him.
'It was: after -the -reception to the President in the dining
room :it the Soldiers' Home,' about 4 o'clock, as the party was
breaking up and â¢ preparing to proceed to the cars that the
pickpocket reaped a harvest of well-filled purses. ' He would
probably nave escaped detection and capture had it not been
for. Charles A. Moore, a wealthy New York manufacturer, who
is a member of the party. The pickpocket was no respecter of
persons and. before he had begun operations upon Mr. Moore
ho had already successfully obtained the purses of Secretaries
Hay and Wilson. In the collection of pocketbooks found upon
the crook after he had been arrested and handcuffed there were
those of less , Important persons and not so well filled as thosa
of the Presidential party. V
Members of Cabinet Have Pockets Picked.
Secretary of State Hay; Secretary Wilson and eight other
members : of the â¢ Presidential party were robbed by 'a clever
pickpocket at the Soldiers', Home thi3 afternoon. The thief
was afterward caught and he Is new in jail in Los Angeles and
the property has been recovered.

great; gone, but nothing can bereave them of the force they

advanced andthat they weax a purer crown than any man can
weave them.' Th/iy sleep to-day in tho3e silent tents that never

LOS ANGELES, May 9.â There have been bigger
crowds In the streets of Los Angeles, and there have
been noisier o-nes. but there has never been a . more
enthusiastic throne of people than that which blocked
all sidewalk travel to-day and nearly checked the ad
vance of one of the best parades the city has seen.
: It was a great event from the commencement to the end,
and It won generous applause from the President, In whose
honor !t marched.
It was 11 o'clock when the platoon of mounted police that
led the way started from the Van Xuys Hotel. President Mc-
Kinley had been ushered into his carriage through a crowd
that crushed and jostled around the entrance of the hotel and
cheered until the President had driven far down the street;
The route, starting at the hotel on Main street, was 'down
Main to Temple block, around Temple block to Spring street,
couth on Spring to Sixth, on Sixth to Broadway, north. on
Broadway to First street and then on First to Hill, where the
parade disbanded. ' .....
On- Broadway, in front of the City Hall, was the stand from
â¢which the President was to review the parade. Tribunes
reached on either side up and down the street so far as to
shield the entire front of the City Hall and the adjoining build
ings and to block the sidewalk and a good part of the roadway.
Gay in bunting of the carnival yellow and roofed with a cloud
of light blue, the President's stand stood forth from the trib
unes, a conspicuous sight from up and down Broadway. " Just
across tricolored pampas plumes edged the sidewalk, and car
nival bunting and national banners blended their brilliance
along the building fronts and from window to window.
Ovation Received at the Reviewing Stand.
The crowd was all there, and it was well past the hour of
11 when the President arrived at the reviewing stand. Ho had
been enthusiastically received all along the route, but the big
crowd had gathered in and around the tribunes and it was
there he received the ovation of the day. He rode In a car
riage of white and gold, the white being the simple purity of
white carnations and tha yellow gaudy marguerites and silk.
Four white horses, harnessed in yellow and with tails and
manes proudly crimped, drew the carriage, and at the head of
each horse walked vaqueros in yellow velvet, wearing broad
sombreros and stepping as proudly as | the milk white horses.
Ferd. K. Rule and Homer Laughlin of the local committee of
reception and arrangements rode on the forward seat of the
President's carriage, while he alone occupied the back seat and
bowed and smiled his cordial responses to the greetings show
rred U2cn him. MC*ftS
It was expected that Mrs. McKlnley would ride with the
President and would occupy the reviewing stand with him, but
at the Jast moment It was decided that the excitement' would
be too much for her. Instead, she and Dr. Rixey drove in a
half-closed carriage along the line of march and to the review
ing- stand, but there some one recognized her and cheers and
hand-clapping went along the crowds like the wind over a
field of waving grain; nor did the applause cease until the
President's wife had driven away. V "_ ; â¢ *
Parade Holds Much of Interest..
As the parade passed^the" President took his 'place at the
railing of the stand and' most of the' time; with his hat in his
hand he watched, the divisions pass. ./His escort, the signal
corps of the First Brigade and its cavalry troop, passed' first
and lined up along the street, waiting 'for the time when the
parade had passed to escprt him back-to the hotel again, and
then, f or _ an hour. and a half passed features seen, only In the
floral parades of Southern California, , \. '. ..' '
The parade was not made wholly of flowers, however, for
there- were. at. least two features which caught and' held -the
President's attention and won from "him.special" commendation.
One was a riotous, I reckless crowd- of cowboys, -that with
whoops .and yells came' galloping 'down' 'the' street, and the
other was the Chinese division, j _
- The cowboys were from San Fernando. .They were dressed.
In true cowboy style, which means- almost anything pic
turesque^ and- all their, attention seemed to have been lavished
on. bridles and saddles,, spurs and sombreros. As they came
down the street' they had some semblance of a line, but when
they caught sight of the" President "they broke ranks' and
dashed at a mad gallop until just in front of him. Horses were
reined back upon their haunches and the .'wild cavalcade came
to a sudden, stop and mix-up. â¢ For. a minute the street was full
of cowboys with flopping hats and capering horses, and- each
yelled like a Comanche, and' then when 'the President raised
his hat to them and broke Into a laugh they gave one more
â¢wild whoop. and rushed on down the street, getting into lino
again as quickly as they had left It.
. Chinese Division for Sober Enthusiasm.
For an exhibition of serious enthusiasm, the' Chinese di
vision was a -tremendous success. From the well behatted,
young Chinaman, who, astride of ,; an indulgent old horse, led
the division to the man who carried the tail of the dragon : it
was all essentially Chinese and sober, solid business. The only
laughs came from ; the ; crowds or from the grinning dragon,
and the only cheers from the people, but the greater part of
the noise came from the Chinese themselves. . Every squeaker
in surrounding Chinatown had been Â¦ brought ' into play and
every leather-lunged Chinaman who could blow one was given
full _ liberty, and there . were others , who i walked behind wooden
drums and beat an ' incessant tattoo, that revealed Â«'a J small boy,
a lath and a picket fence. There were. men in. gorgeous robes
and yard-long beards; girls . with little feet, men with cymbals'
and -gongs, floats, and the dragon. ' Â¦ â¢
The dragon ! was the greatest sight of all. It was â¢ a good
three hundred feet. long, and 'the 'sturdy shbuldersof nearly a
hundred Chinese were needed to carry it; and that it was heavy

of puffing-, perspiring relays, each man
fanning himself with a turkey wing, who
walked alongside resting for another trick
at the burden. The men were fantasti
cally dressed in pink and green,' and in a
loose pocket in the small of his back each
man working carried a fan. The head
hart been made even more hideous than
usual, for this was an unusually great
occasion, and before it pranced a tall
Chinaman with a long and much-decor
ated staff, with which he lured it on.
Dragon Men Give "Great Welcome.'*
The body of the dragon was made of
brilliant iridescent scales and Its tail was
spiked and wicked looking. Down the
etreet it squirmed, writhing and twisting
ITs great length until the head had passed
the President. Then it turned and fol
lowed its capering leader until It had
doubled back upon itself and faced the
President and then solemnly the uorrible
head bowed low three times and . the
dragon men gave the "great welcome,"
given only to the mightiest and bravest
chiefs.
Amid great applause McKinley returned
bow for bow and he laughed and applaud
ed with his hand upon the top ot his hat
and turned to the gentlemen around him
with every expression of amusement. It
was a novel sight, the hideous head nod
, ding and bobbing to the President while
he returned in kind, and It seemed to In
dicate that with us at least relations with
China arc not strained. -.'Â¦Â¦

hurt the eyes to look at them; with every
conceivable design and all in perfect

short. ")
Pretty Features of Parade.
Many of the Ideas were new and pretty
and some delicately original. One auto
mobile decked in green foliage and red
blossoms passed noiselessly down the
street preceded by a float of white pigeons
with outstretched wings, which, attached
to a frame extending in front, seemed to
be drawing their captor on. A little girl
rode by on a tricycle fitted with two gor
geous butterfly wings which seemed ready
to take their rider and themselves high
over the housetops. Another little girl
sped down the street In a little trap drawn
by a self-satlsfled goat, which seemed to
enjov his distinction and to, appreciate
the bow the President gave to his dimin-
to the second car of the Presidential
train and handcuffed. He had a number
of pocketbooks and purses still filled with
the money . and valuables , they had con
tained before he transferred them to his
own possession, showing that he had
worked all alone and in a very great
hurry. -'
The pickpocket wore a dark Fedora cap,
but in his pocket neatly folded up was a
cap. The detectives who- came with the
Presidential party recognized their catch
as a crook who has been, following It and
who was frequently seen in other cities
on the route. He gave the name of John
Heinrich. The detectives who are with
the party are looking for another man
who has been seen along the road at many
places. They have a good description of
him and expect to capture him. .

finder Honored With a
Visit From McKinley
LOS ANGELES. May 9.â This morning
before many people were stirring the
President was taken for a drive through
the city. The President had expressed a
wish to call on Mrs. Jessie Benton Fre
mont, the widow of General John C. Fre
mont, and the drive included a trip to her
home on West Twenty-eighth street. Mrs.
McKinley accompanied the President and
while Mr. McKinley was Inside talking
for a minute with .Mrs. Fremont her
daughter,, Miss E. B. Fremont, went-out
to the carriage where Mrs. McKinley was
waiting and chatted -with her. The visit
was but a short one. for time was press
ing, and it was not long before the Presi
dent and his wife were again on their way
through the streets of the residence por
tions of the city.
This evening the President and Ids wife
dined with Homer Laughlln and a few
friends. He left about 10 o'clock and drove

In this event Mrs. Louisa M. Muirhead,
sole devisee under the will of the late
Charles Walter Willey, will come into
possession of decedent's interest In the
estate of his father, Amassa P.' Willey,
which Is valued at about $80,000.. Mrs.
Muirhead has carried on litigation over
this estate for three years.
Mrs. Muirhead befriended young Willey
when he had no other friends left. Con
sequently when he won a judgment
against his father's estate he forthwith
rr.ade her his beneficiary. The decision
of the Supreme Court of yesterday now
opens the door for her to receive that
reward which young Willey willed she
should have in return for her kindness
to him when he was in need of a friend.
A judgment was handed down yesterday
by the Supreme Court declaring the deed
of trust executed by the late Amassa P.
Willey null and void. The decision was
reached in the case instituted by E. W.
Carpenter et al, trustees, against E. V. S.
Cooks, in which the plaintiffs sought to
quiet title against the defendant to cer
tain real estate.
Plaintiffs claimed a legal title to the
estate as trusteesâ first under the deed of
trust just declared invalid, and, secondly,
as trustees under the will of Amassa P.
Willey, by the terms- of which he devised
to them Â¦ the property In question upon
the trusts declared in the deed of trust,
which 'was executed prior to the will.
By its judgment the Superior Court
decreed that the trusts created by the
d<*Â« â¢! of trust were void and that conse
quently under this instrument the trus
tees had no title. The Supreme Court
hel.-l yesterday that the trial court was
correct as to its ruling regarding the
trust. The court, however, did not pass
uÂ»on the validity of the trust established
in the will, holding that the matter as to
whether or not the trustees had title by
virtue of the will was a question to be
first resolved by the court in which ad
ministration of the Willey estate was
P< The n k>"wer court will now be # called upon
to again pass upon decedent s will. in
his argument before the Supreme Court
in Aulust of 1S98 ex-Judge Charles W.
Slack presented his points against the
Willey deed of trust. After disposing of
a primary trust, established in the deed
of trust, Judge Slack attacked the trust
esiRblished by the deceased for the care
of his grave. The fact that this trust was
not for a charity and in direct terms a
perpetuity rendered the same invalid,
counsel held. - ' .
A perpetual trust for other than a char
ity has been declared invalid, and, casting
aiide the objection to the primary trust,
it was contended that Willey's effort to
keep his grave forever green defeated the
whole scheme of his deed of trust. These
contentions have been sustained by the
Supreme Court, and as the provisions of
the will are almost identical with the pro*
visions of the deed of trust, counsel are
confident that the trust established in the
will will also fall.

O'Hare "Was Closely Guarded.
A. L. Gutterson, bookkeeper at the San
Francisco Savings Union, produced books
and receipts showing that on December
22 last O'Hare had closed his account at
the bank and had transferred the amount
of $45,254 42 to his credit to Thomas G.
Jacques and an account was 1 opened in
Jacques' name, with that amount to his
credit. Jacques closed his account on
April 15 by withdrawing the amount.
A. M. Whittle, paying teller at the bank '
Identified the receipts and the signatures
of O'Hare and Jacques. He had known
O'Hare for fifteen years and had always
found him competent to transact busi
ness. He opened his account with the
bank in 1S77 and had not drawn any
money out till November, last year, when
he drew out $50 and two other small sums
up to December 22, when the transfer
was made to Jacques. During the occa
sions on which the old man drew out the
money he noticed nothing unusual in his
manner. The only thing was that the old
man was getting older.
Thomas G. Jacques Jr. was recalled and
testified as to what happened prior to
taking the old man to Oakland on. April
12 and'up to his departure with him the
following evening for Cheyenne, Wyo. '
Big Sum. Transferred.
The first witness called yesterday after
noon was F. W. Russell, paying teller in
the London and Lancashire Bank. He
testified that he paid a check payable to
old man O'Hare for $5000. on February 25
last. The old man was accompanied by
young Jacques and an older gentleman who
is admitted to have been Jacques senior.
He recognized the indorsement on the
back of the check as that of the old man,
who had been cashing checks at the bank
for the past two years. .
There was a sensational development in
the case of Thomas G, Jacques and his
wife Caroline E. Jacques, charged with
kidnaping old Joseph O'Hare, in Judge
Cabaniss' court yesterday afternoon by_
the discovery that O'Hare had trans
ferred, on December 22 last, $45,254 42,
which he had on deposit in the San Fran;
cisco Savings Union, to Thomas G. Jac
ques. It was thought that the only money
the old man had on deposit in banks was
about $18,000 in the German and Hibernia
banks, which the defendants and their
son are accused of stealing, and the dis
closure of the fact of the large amount
in the other bank was a revelation to the
relatives of the ol* man and their attor
neys. ' Every one is wondering If any
more money on deposit will be discov
ered.

Through an error in the Information
given out by members of the Health De
partment, the account published yester
day morning stated that the school at
this location was called the James Lick
School. .; . -I â¢ Â¦ . . Â¦.!Â¦â¢Â¦Â«.
The parents of many of the children at
tending the school are much alarmed and
after making a personal investigation of
the premises have declined to allow their
children to return until the danger is
past. Others are still in doubt as to what
course they shall pursue. Dr. Seymour
Bays that both cases are progressing well
at present, and he does not apprehend
eerious results.
Director Mark of the Board of Educa
tion says no action with a view to clos
ing the school can be taken until a re
commendation to that effect comes from
the Board cf Health.
The entrances to the school room's and
the grocery are separate, but the children
play all about the building, including that
portion of it where the patient is con
fined. Dr. Keenan admitted that theie
was possibility cf contagion on account
of the proximity of the respective rooms
and the number of children, but said he
did not feel warranted in making such a
report to the board as would necessitate
the closing of the school.
Dr. Seymour takes a similar position as
regards the possibility of contagion and
Bays the Sheehan boy may have caught
the fever from a child living next door,
whose Illness bears some resemblance to
scarlet fever symptoms. However, it is
quite possible, he pays, that the disease
may have been contracted from Twelt
man - \^ i. .
There are two entrances to the school,
one on Twenty-sixth street and one on
Castro street. The quarantine card is on
thÂ« Twenty-sixth-street side and that en
trance is now closed. The grocery and
the other school entrance front on Castro
street and there is no sign there to mark
the presence of contagious disease. The
store is being run by the son of the sick
man.
Dr. James Seymour, who is attending
the cases of both Tweitman and the Shee-
Jian boy, informed Miss Agnes G. Regan,
principal of the school, on Wednesday
morning that a case of scarlet fever ex
isted in the lower portion of the build
ing in which the school is located. Miss
Regan at once notified the Board of
Health, which had been informed of the
presence of the disease, but was not
aware that there was a school in the
same building. Yesterday morning Dr.
Keenan of the Board of Health went out
ajid made an investigation. He said that,
in his opinion, there was little danger of
a spread of the disease if proper care
were taken.
Little Johnny Ebeehan, a pupil in the
?foe Valley Primary School, which is lo
cated directly over the rooms of Grocer
Nicholas Tweitman, who is ill with scar
let fever, as published in The Call yester
day morning, has been stricken with the
dread disease and is confined to his home
at 145S Church street. The Board of
Health declines to admit that the 130
children attending the school are in any
danger from the contagious disease and
the Eoard of Education declines to close
the school on its own responsibility. The
parents of about fifty of the children,
warned by the published account of the
matter, refused to allow them to attend
school yesterday and, although the usual
Â«xercises were carried oh, some of the
classes " were much depleted.

finishes. Again at Oakland yesterday in
the mile and seventy yard selling num
ber that closed the afternoon's sport ho
figured in a terrific drive that brought the
crowd In the stand to Its feet. E. Mat
thews; his rider, just nipping the decis
ion In a three neck contest with Goldone
and Gauntlet. There were but nve start
ers altogether, and beyond cavil Goldone,
ridden by Bassin^er. carried the heaviest
commission, although Horton closed at
about the same figure. Bassinger ajid
Goldonp had orders to go out in front,
but was unable to shake off Ransch. as
tride Gauntlet. Indeed, a furlong from
the stand, with Hcrton apparently too far
back to cause n-purehension. Gauntlet, a
head in front, looked the winner. Then
Horton spurted and the rooters for the
red horse opened their chorus. At the
paddock h<> had caug-ht the leaders and
with Gcildone en the inside and Gauntlet
bumping. Horton was first by a neck,
while Gauntlet, which seemed to have fared
worst by the jostling, lest the olace by
the same distance. The time. 1:45, was
Â¦within a quarter of a second of the coast
record.
As on the preceding day, form was well
demonstrated, favorites in four instances
capturing purses. The track was fast and
the racing-, far above the ordinars\ at
tracted another large crowd.
One of the unexpected defeats was that
of Jarretierre d'Or by Rory Ough in the
five furlong dash for two-year-olds. The
former youngster held a commanding
place in the betting and was beaten in
ragtime fashion by Rory, which won eas
ing up almost in 1:01 flat. The previous
time out the winner, with Bergen up, had
a most tempestuous voyage. He was
played down in the betting from 5 to 2 to
9 to 5.
Ruiz begran operations by landing the
opening six furlong sprint with Catherine
Bravo, an 8 to 1 chance. The filly led
throughout, winning easily from Matilda
O and Merida. The favorite, Aphrodis,
ran a poor race.
Atkln & Lottridge's Parader. while not
possessing any marked amount of class,
had shown a tendency to go a route. The
big lumbering gelding was introduced to
some moderate company in the mile run
following and, a 2 to 1 favorite, rumbled
home first. Out of it at the start. Ruiz,
who rode him, skirted round the field,
beating in Formatus a length. Conley, on
the latter, succeeded in "scrambling the
egjers" or he would have scored.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's sprinter,
Meehanus, struck a soft spot in the fourth
number, over six furloncs. One to 2 was
the best price obtainable and the chest
nut horse won tossing the bit away. Gib
raltar, sour and peevish as usual, did
g*>t the place from Rinaldo.
Backed from threes to 9 to 5 favoritism.
Alee was never headed In the seven fur
long selling event. At the end Pat Morris
sey got up under punishment in time to
lose out by a. half length only. Mike
Strauss ran third.

Commotion at Baseball
Game in Ninth
Inning.
Oakland I, San Francisco 0.
"War, fistic war and the noise of voices
fell upon Recreation Grounds yesterday
afternoon toward the close of a fast and
congested' baseball game. In the ninth
Inning a lone soldier sitting on the south
ern bleachers Indulged In much profanity
and blasphemy, all of which was directed
against the head of Left Fielder Holland
of the local team. Holland had dropped
a couple of easy ones out in his own gar
den and this angered the defender of bis
nation to mouth insults. "When the sol
dier wound up his Vcuss" invective with
a charge that Holland was throwing: the
game the latter jumped the fence and
thumped Uncle Sam's vociferating fa
natic Into 6llence.
This incident stopped thÂ© game for a
time. "While this storm scene of action
was in process on the south bleachers.
Orlando Stevens of Oakland, a sometime
actor, placed comfortably in the beer
cage, arose and with tragic voice suffused
with foamy passion gave out to too crowd
the following: "You're the dirtiest crowd
of players that I ever seen coma over
the pike." A local fanatic nearby strip
ped to his shirt and would have cham
pioned the local cause, but luckily all fur
ther warring was ended by the interfer
ence of the crowd. " ' Â¦""' Â¦*-*
The game was a pitchers battle. Oak
land's only run being made on account
of Holland's error. Iburg pitched re
markable ball, allowing but -three nits.

Alto, at S;30 a. m.. May 14, the p?rty will
be driven immediately to the Assembly
Hall on the Stanfor-d campus, a mile dis
tant from the station. The audience of
students and faculty will already be wait
iiig for the President.
President Jordan will -welcome the party
in behalf of the faculty and officers of
the university, and then will introduce
Cecil M. Marrack. president of the Asso
ciated Students, who will speak briefly for
the undergraduates.
President McKinley has consented to
speak to the students for half an hour.
The Glee Club will occupy seats in the
balcony at the left hand side of the gal
lory facing the stage. The Stanford words
to the air "One, Two. Three. Four," will
open the exercises, and "America," in
which the whole student body will join,
will close.
Superintendent Frank Covey will then
take charge of the party and will show
them through the celebrated Palo Alto
stables, the Stanford residence grounds
ar.d the university grounds. The whole
time occupied will be but two hours, as
the Presidential train leaves for Burlin
Â£ame at 11:30.
The university authorities have instruct
ed Cliarles E. Hodges, the local architect,
to take charge of the decorations of the
Assembly Hal!. In order to avoid too
large a crowd, admission to the hall will
be by ticket only. The crowd will be well
policed and a sufficiently large corps of
student ushers has been appointed to seat
the crowd. The hall has a seating ca
pacity of 1S00, but It is thought that 2000
tickets can be given out with safety.
The university band of forty pieces will
represent Stanford in the San Jose parade
Monday, and will also be given a promi
nent part in the local exercises.
The following committees have been ap
pointed to co-operate with the faculty
committee and the university manage

toward making their presence on the
rocks known.
The men of the Union Iron Works are
determined to maintain the marine ship
building supremacy of the coast, signal
ized by the building of the Charleston, the
San Francisco and the Oregon. They are

Some comment has been made over the
apparent slovyiess of business houses to
decorate for the President's visit and of
the committee on decoration to carry out
its plans for beautifying the streets. But
the delay is only apparent. The street dec
orations are in the main made' up ready to
be placed In position as late as possible
so that they mav bo Â¦ fresh ; and bright

THAT MAN'S FATHERâ A. G. M..
City. The expression "That man's father
was my father's son" is so simple of ex
planation that there Is hardly any occa
sion ."for argument pro and con for a
week without arriving at any satisfactory
conclusion." For instance, if aman points
to his own son and says. "That mans
father " he means himself, and when ne
adds "was my father's son" he refers to
his own father.

A BIG ESTATEâ W. M., Boston, Mass.
On the 1st of December, 1S95, there was
published in the San Francisco papers a
dispatch from Brockton, Mass., announc
ing that John Hilton of Campobello, a
suburb of that place, would In a short
time leave for San Francisco to secure
his portion of an estate, valued at ?15,0OO,
000 left by his uncle, who died but a
short time before. This department has
not been able to discover that any man
died in San Francisco, or in any part or

XII.â SOCIAX ASPECTS OF POLITICAL LIFE.
In no phase of life in the TTnited States
has so great change taken place since the
first quarter of the nineteenth century as
in what is popularly called "public life,"
especially as seen in national politics. On
the hlctory of political parties and distinct
political rchanges I" will not write, but
rather on what may bo termed the social
aspects of political life.
The Federal city had been planned, by
Major L'Enfant with great minuteness,
and he had seized ample farm lands in
Maryland. and Virginia on the banks of
the Potomac for the Distiict of Columbia.
A national church was planned to go
where the patent office now stands, de
voted to monuments, of the illustrious
dead, funeral orations and patriotic ser
mons. Between the AVhite House and the
Capitol there were to be cascades and
gardens, and public buildings and houses
for the legations But L'Enfant quarreled
and fell into disrepute and was turned out
of office. The city progressed without
him, the- States subscribed money, prizes
were given for designs for the President's
house and the Capitol andâ the unfailing
resort of the dayâ lotteries were estab
lished to raise money. Federal lottery No.
1 was to build a "hotel"â a new French
word then being adopted instead of the
sturdy old English word "tavern," which
is to this day in many of our States the
only legal nomenclature for such great
ous and unconventional scene. Massachu
setts men were Federalists to an aston
ishing degree and hated Jefferson with
all the hatred possible in a good, narrow,
bigoted' people for one whom they be
lieved, an impious rascal. But the towns
people of Cheshire, influenced by its
preacher, Elder Iceland, were to a man
Jeffersonian Democrats. '
The elder was a sort of Baptist-Quaker
revivalist, eccentric, excitable, a ready
and persuasive speaker, a friend of Jef
ff-rron and a disciple of the broad prin
ciples of the Declaration of Independence.
The women . of Cheshire were famous
cheesemakers and the elder of the good
wives evolved the notion of a, mammoth
cheese to be sent to#the new President as
a congratulatory gift. ?The .cheese wa3
made. It was said that every cow in
town furnished curd. It was pressed in
a cider mill Iqf ten days. It was draggei
on a pledge to Hudson by four horses anil
shipped thence to Washington. .The ale'er
went with the cheese, '"preaching all the
way." The cheese was accompanied by
an address, "The Greatest Cheese in
America for the Greatest Man in Anier
irn.." A copy of this address was con
Â¦\ eyed to Mr.- Jefferson a day in advance
that he might prepare and write out a
reply. Then they went to the executive
mansi'm, said their speech, gave the
â¢cheese and heard the President's speech. It
was declared to be a "free-will offering,"
was "but a pepper-corn of their love."
and so on with much formality and pomp

THE LOCATION OF CAPITALS.
BY reason of the destruction of the Capitolat
Harrisburg 'Pennsylvania finds it necessary to
provide for the construction of a new building
for her State government. A bill appropriating the
sum of $5,000,000 for that purpose is now before the
Legislature, where it is being held up pending a set
tlement of the question whether the new Capitol shall
be erected at Harrisburg or at Philadelphia. The dis
cussion is interesting because it shows that the policy
which has prevailed in the United States of locating
the seat of government in a small town rather than
in the natural capital is by no means so generally
supported as it was at the time when most of the
States were organized.

Soon Mrs. Adams was gone, and Mrs.

bountiful but far from elegant dinners for

thus describes the dinner:

over an area nearly as great as the city
of New York and see only a few brick
kilns and temporary huts. Near the Capi

November, 1800, for her few months' stay,
and described to her daughter her sur
roundings with the brilliant pen that
made her letters an enrichment of our his

about 150 scattered houses, but no gar

talk as to the city's name. A doggerel

perhaps it was; but in Mr. Jefferson's
financial diary at that date is this entry:
"Gave Rev. JVIr. Leland, bearer of the
cheese of 1235 pounds, $200," which was
the rate of 16 cents a pound, the price
current for cheese being 11 cents a pound.

J.t will be seen that when the country bank can
expand its issue in the season of demand, when busi
ness men are using their credit, and then contract it
when the demand slackens, congestion in the distant
centers will cease, and men everywhere will use their
credit and have access to the loan fund upon fairly
It is a mistake to suppose that our system of banks
of issue is nearly perfect. It was framed to meet ai
emergency. The evil of the greenback issue was im
mediately apparent 10 Mr. Lincoln, and to avert it
he advised the National banking system, which was
fairly adapted to the financial needs of the country
forty years ago. But the country has grown, while
the banking system remains nearly as it was. Then
the business of the country originated near the money
centers and had- ready access to capital. Now busi
ness is a spontaneous growth far away from those
centers, and suffers from the congestive tendencies of
capital under the operation of the National banking
law.
Congress will now do its duty if it proceed to adapt
the banking system to the vast development of the
last forty years. This will require eradication of the
facility now furnished for the congestion of currency
in the money centers, which causes the accumulation
there of almost the entire loan fund, or surplus capi
tal, of the country.
The exchanges of commerce ebb and flow with the
seasons and rise and fall with the demand, and the
medium of exchange should follow the same course
and obey the same law.
Our Western Congressmen should feel themselves
especially charged to support these measures. The
West needs a sound monetary standard and a more
flexible and adaptive banking system. All Western
business requires an easier and more economical use
of credit, which must come with a banking system
that can emit a sound currency when required to meet
the demands of trade and credit, and contract it when
the demand slackens.
The Indianapolis committee, a non-partisan body,
has with great constancy and energy planned and
pushed this legislation, and indicates now a hope that
its work may be finished in the next year.
Omitting for the present a detailed statement of the
features of these bills upon which the next Congress
will be asked to act, it is now sufficient to say that
they are in line with the reforms promised in 1896
and in every campaign since.
This legislation necessarily was among political is
sues then, as all financial and, economic legislation has
to be in this country, but now it is beyond the limits
of partisanship. The people have indorsed it at two
Presidential and three Congressional elections, and
it is justly considered first among the interests to
which Congress must pay attention..
These measures are of the highest importance and
Vitally concern the financial future of the country. If
business men will but reflect that what has been ac
complished already has practically transferred the
world's financial center to this country and â¢ has
thereby furnished us great protection against a finan
cial panic, which may come out of a clear sky any
day, they will see the need of going forward until the
whole system of financial legislation demanded by the
Republicans and Gold Democrats in 1896 is finished.
The Indianapolis executive committee has in
fluenced the preparation of two bills, one the Over
street bill, to provide exchangeability of all forms of
currency with gold, which completes the gold stan
dard measures, and the other known as the Lovering
bill, to introduce banking reform.
THE short session of the last Congress was over
loaded with business beyond the possibility of
taking action upon the measures necessary to
complete the gold standard law and to begin the
reformation of our banking system required by the
country. It is to be regretted that any time was lost
in matters of such importance to the financial future
of the country, but what is gone is gone, and there is
nothing to be done now except prepare for action in
the next Congress.
FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
The issue may delight those' who take an interest in
discussing the interrelations of mercy and justice.
Some folks will commend the Judge who out of good
ness of heart and' sympathy for human frailty is mer
ciful to all who. are summoned before him, while"
others uphold the stern Judge who enforces the 'law
no matter upon whose neck the ax falls. In this par
ticular case the army officer will be fortunate if the
action of the Justice does not hurt rather than help
him. Some one may yet disclose his name, and then
the discussion over the action of the Justice will cause
it to have ten times the notoriety it would have had
under other circumstances.
The statement of the Justice that he. is financially
able to pay the note should judgment against him be
obtained is declared by his critics to be a "bit of im
pudence." It is not a question of' ability to pay. It
is a Question of judicial impartiality and official hon
esty. The argument is that before a court all persons
should stand on an equal footing, and that no favors
should be shown to any one because of his respec
tability, his profession or mVmilitary service.
It is argued upon the other side that even if it be
true that it is not always proper and just ,to publish
every document that is discovered in, a gambling den,
there remains the fact that all such documents are
parts of the legal evidence in the case and should not
be destroyed by the courts. A Judge should make no
distinction of persons. If he can in the exercise of
good intention destroy the I. O. U. of an "eminently
respectable man," why might he not from a similar
good intention protect everybody?
It will be seen the Justice claims that his action was
taken for the purpose of saving "an eminently re
spectable man, an army officer, now fighting in the
Philippines," from a disclosure that would have se
riously injured him. The Justice does not intend, to
do any wrong to the gambler to whom the note was
given. He declares a willingness to be sued in a civil
court, and if judgment* be given against him he will
pay the note out of his own pocket. His one desire
is to shield a stranger from the consequences that
would follow a revelation of the fact that he had con
tracted a gambling debt.
In his own defense the Justice is reported as say
ing: ''Unlawfully and on my own responsibility, I
found an I. O. U. of an eminently respectable man,
an army officer, now fighting in the 'Philippines, in
the safe of a gambling-house, and I showed it to the
attorney for the proprietor. He agreed that I should
destroy it, and I did so. I am, of course, liable to a
civil suit for so doing. If any one wishes to sue me
my defense will be that it is a gambling debt. If the
suit goes against me I shall pay the amount out of my
own pocket. I am financially able to pay it, although
my name is not on the personal tax list. I have never
met and do not know the officer, and, in fact, had
never heard of him until I found the bill."
ONE of the oddest questions of ethics that ever
arose from judicial proceedings is reported
from New York. Justice Jerome of the
Court of Special Sessions in that city had occasion not
long ago to make an official examination of the con
tents of a safe taken from a gambling-house, and in
the course of it he found an I. O. U. for a large
amount signed* by an officer of the army. Imme
diately upon finding 'the document the Justice tore
it up, so that it might not be a part of the evidence
in the case, and now the question is, Did he do right
or wrong?
A QUESTION OP ETHICS.
The "fire season" has begun unusually early this
year, and it will not be long before we hear of it in
the forests of California, and then there will be more
brave talk of what ought to be done in the way of
forest preservation.
The Kaiser, then, has been defeated in his pet
measure. It now remains to be seen what will be the
result of Morgan's interest in the scheme. Should he
direct his energies to the task he might -manage to
teach the Prussian Junkers that they will gain rather
than lose by improving the commercial facilities of
the country. On the other hand, the mere suggestion
of his interest in the canals might intensify the oppo
sition and make it more determined than ever.* The
matter is not one of any great international impor
tance, but none the less it is bound to occupy the at
tention of men interested in finding a German market
for American products. It seems certain that in the
end the canals will be constructed, for the Kaiser and
Morgan form a team that is hard to beat, and, more
over, the spirit of progress fights on their side and as
sures an overthrow of the conservative forces and
obstinacies that oppose the development of commer
cial facilities.
Two years ago a similar bill was rejected, and since
that time the Kaiser has been employing every means
in his power to overcome the opposition. When the
new bill was introduced the Finance Minister ex
plained that the finances of Prussia are amply able to
bear the cost of the work. It was well understood
that the measure was virtually a bill emanating from
the Kaiser. Nevertheless it was rejected as firmly
this year as it was two years ago.
For years the Kaiser has sought to procure from
the Prussian Landtag money and authority for carry
ing out an elaborate system of canal construction.
In the bill, which was presented last January and re
cently rejected, provision was made for completing a
system of waterways connecting the Rhine with the
Elbe, Berlin with Stettin, the Oder with the Vistula,
and opening a way from Silesia to the Oder-Spree
canal. The object of the measure is of course to
facilitate commerce, and it was just for that reason it
was rejected. It appears from reports the main oppo
sition of the Agrarians and the Junkers was based
upon the argument that the opening of the new canals
would make it easier for foreign goods to be imported
and distributed through the country, and would there
fore be injurious to the agricultural interests, and even
the Silesians are said to have fought the bill because
the construction of a canal through their country
would permit British coal or American coal to be
brought in 'to the detriment of the Silesian. coal in
dustry.
A BRIEF dispatch from Europe says that Pier
pont Morgan has been negotiating for control
of the Prussian canals in order to 'obtain
through them a readier access to the German market
for the products of the steel trust. The dispatch is
doubtless an exaggeration, being but another of the
many rumors concerning the far-reaching ambitions
of the great industrial and commercial organizer.
There is, however, nothing improbable in the sup
position that Morgan has endeavored to arrange for
favorable terms for transportation along the canals.
In fact, it is almost certain he has done so, for such an
arrangement is necessary to his business. His appear
ance in that field, however, is interesting in more
ways than one, for it puts him on the side of the
Kaiser in the fight for an extension and improvement
of the Prussian canals, and it will be worth while to
note what the effect will be should he make an ener
getic fight for the improvements.
MORGAN AND THE KAISER.
A movement has been started to have Edward
crowned as King of Canada as well as of Great Brit
ain and Ireland, and as sucli coronation would be
surely followed by the creation of several Canadian
peers and a goodly number of knights, prominent

The press of Philadelphia declares the city to be in
different to the question. The location of the State
capital there would be an insignificant factor in the
business of the metropolis. The average citizen
would hardly know when the Legislature was in ses
sion except by the reports in the ' newspapers, for
there would be no conspicuous increase in the crowds
on the street or at the hotels, except those at which
politicians would make their headquarters. Public
interest, however, would be so much served by hav
ing the State government established in the natural
capital that it is quite likely the new Capitol may be
erected at that city. The only thing likely to defeat it
is the outcropping of a job in connection with the
selection of a site. There is already a. rumor that
somebody in Philadelphia has town lots to sell.
As a rule the smaller cities of a State are eager to
obtain the rank of capital because the people believe
it is of advantage to them, but it is doubtful if the
advantage be as great as is supposed. A Legislature
which meets only once in two years does not draw
to a community a sufficient number of visitors to jus
tify the erection of great hotels, or to make it worth
while for merchants to lay in supplies for such casual
trade. ' The result is that when the Legislature is in
session the hotels are overcrowded, and then visitors
get a disagreeable impression of the place, and on
leaving it give it a bad reputation. It is doubtful if
there be a single small city occupying the position of
a State capital, that would not have been better off
if the burden had never been imposed upon it.
The location of capitals has been made in this
country in almost every instance as a result of a
conflict of local patriotisms or prejudices. Even at
the establishment of the Union the same unfortunate
policy prevailed. In our time no one would think
of locating the national capital in a wilderness on the
Potomac; but the statesmen of that time could do-^
no better, for there was no way by which a majority
could be induced to agree upon either New York or
Philadelphia. By a compromise of the various issues
between North* and South, the great States and the
little States, and all the other complications of the
time, the capital of the Union was set up in the woods/
and even to this day it has never become a city in the
right sense of the word, since it has neither trade, in
dustry nor financial prestige.
amusement, education and society. Moreover, it is
there that most of the real .politics of the State is car
ried on. Why, then, should not the Legislature meet
there, the Governor reside there, and the administra
tive departments of the government with the Supreme
Court be established/there?
Of course there has to be an East, and a hard, long
winter and a short, hot summer, and our distinguished
visitors have to live there and stand it. They will see
in the heartiness of our golden welcome a desire of
our people to let them know there is something bet
ter than what they are accustomed to. If they could
be with us longc- we could make it easier for them,
but we have a large panorama and a short time to
show it. Therefore we seem to be very busy about
it and may perhaps tire them, but we mean well and
have only a desire to increase their knowledge.
The economic significance of this fact will not es
cape the Presidential party. Where production is in
such variety- and is without interruption man has
more things to which to turn his hand, therefore the
opportunities of life are more numerous and more
reliable here than elsewhere.
THE President is no stranger to California. He
has visited us before. But now he comes as
President, and because we hail and greet him
in that capacity will get a better look at our best foot
than he ever had before. He will traverse the length
of- the State, and will find from the snowy summit of
Mount San Bernardino" to the white helmet that glis
tens on the bald pate of Shasta an unbroken succes
sion of the same facilities, resources, products and cli
mate. He can pluck the ripe oranges of Redlands and
the orange bloom of the Sacramento Valley. The
fig, date, pomegranate, olive and grape grow in sight
of his path through California from extreme south to
extreme north. Nature did not use this State as a
gold ring to carry one small diamond setting in one
section only. It is jeweled on its entire circumfer
ence) and what grows south flounshes north also. It
will not escape his observation that the tiller of the
soil here has some crop for market every month in
the 3 r ear. It is a winterless land, and production is
ceaseless.- Herein California differs from every other
part of the continent, and has few competitors on any
continent.

PEKING, May 9.â An indemnity claim
of 450,000,000 taels was presented to the
Chinese plenipotentiaries this evwiing.
Official Chinese throughout the empfre
have been communicating with the court
and giving advice. Most of them seem tq
favor a loan guaranteed by the foreign
powers. Others, prominent among whom
is Chang Chi Tung, believe in raising the
money in every possible way without a
loan and in paying off the entire demand
wjthin five years.
PARIS. May 9.â An official dispatch
from Peking announces that a band of
Chinese brigands from the province of
Kwangsi recently attacked the French
post at Linan and drove out the garrison,
killing five and wounding seven men. A
few days later the brigands attacked the
French post at Soogiang. but were driven
off leaving thirty-three killed. The band
finally May 2, was driven back into
Kwangsi with heavy loss. Ten Frenchmen
were wounded during the fighting.
Conger told Acting Secretary of State
Hill that China was wholly unable to pay
$327,000,000. In San N Francisco, much, to
the disappointment of the administratron,
he estimated, that China could pay not
more than $300,000,000, but, after sounding
officials and ascertaining that Secretary
Hay believes that $200,000,000 is sufficient,
his"estimate is likely to drop.
Conger expressed belief that if the In
demnity were too large the powers would
have to guarantee a loan.- while if it were
reasonable China could float it.
Conger came to Washington for a
double purpose. He desired to pay his re
spects, to the officials, and he. wished to
familiarize himself with events which
have occurred in China since his depart
ure. He was allowed to read. all the dis
patches cabled by Special Commissioner
Rockhill and Squires, Charge d'Affaires,
and messages from representatives of
this Government in Europe.

MANILA, May 9.â The trial of Captain
Barrows before the military court is be
ing carried on rapidly. To-day was de
voted by the defense to proving his good
character and attempting to show that
Lieutenant Boyer was the principal in the
bacon deal. It does not appear possible
that Captain Barrows can escape convic
tion. \
Captain Read, who Is also accused of
connection with the commissary scandals,
was placed in confinement yesterday by
order of General MacArthur. It is said
this action has no connection with the
local report that Captain Read contem
plated flight before his trial, but it fore
shadows that there Â£<re some unpublished
results which the authorities are safe
guarding.
In the civilian trials before the special
commission a Chinaman who was con
victed of being implicated in the purchase
of commissary supplies was sentenced
to one year's Imprisonment and to pay a
fine of 1000 pesos. .
During the civilian trials Artillery Ser-
geant Knepper, Teamster Vail and Check
er Stickman gave evidence going to show
that there was a well-defined plot for the
alleged disposal of commissary stores.

SACRAMENTO, May 9.â The story
which has gained considerable circulation
to the effect that William Ingram, a
member of the wholesale hardware firm
cf Schaw, Ingram. & Batcher, had mys
teriously disappeared is emphatically de
nied by his business associates. When
asked about the matter to-day, William
Schaw, the senior member, said:
"Mr. Ingram has not disappeared. He
has gone away from the city for a rest
and our firm is In regular communication
with him. As long ago as February last
1 advised Mr. Ingram to take a vacation
for six months, telling him that his in
come during that time would not be af
fected, but he declined the offer. He has
now gone away for a vacation, but will
return shortly, and â¢ his position in the
firm will remain inviolate. Mr. Ingram's
dealings with tne firm are perfectly sat
isfactory in all respects, and the best of
feeling exists between us all. As to what
personal troubles Mr. Ingram may have
to cause him worry I have not concerned
myeelf , since I consider that it is not
â¢within my province, and I know abso
lutely nothing about that. Mr. Ingram is
now off on a vacation such as I advised
him to take months ago."

PETALUMA, May 9.â Claus Moltzen a
pioneer of Marin County, died at his home
in San Antonio Valley, south of here to
day. He was born, in Denmark in ' 1825
and came to California In 1849. He leaves
a widow and large family. A few weeks
ago the old Couple celebrated' their golden
wedding anniversary.
President's stay at '.the encampment Is
said to be probable, but no official con
flrmation of the rumor can be obtaii.ed
It is stated that information has been rÂ£
ceived to the effect that the President
does not wish to, speak from the pavilion
in the open air, but prefers having the
doors of the assembly hall thrown open
to the public at the close of the' session
of the G. A. R.. in which he takes a pan
and speaking indoors. If this is true'
many thousands of persons who are com
ing here by special' trains from all the
surrounding country . will . go away with
out hearing him, for the utmost-, capacifv
of the hall is only about 2000. The general
feeling here is that the President will not
discriminate in favor of the veterans in
this way, but will adhere to the original
plan. â¢ â . * . - ,
The Women's Relief Corps and Ladles of
the G. A. R both convened- in annual ses

The Grand Court was called to order at
8 o'clock this morning; and it was a no
ticeable fact that every man entitled to a
vote was in his seat. After the prelim
inary work of reading the minutes of yes
terday's session was concluded the pre
siding officer called for nominations for
grand senior beadle. J. McCoy and T. L.
Holden. both of Alameda. were placed in
nomination, McCoy winning. L. W. Mor
gan cf Los Angeles and Peter Storni of
Banta Barbara were placed in nomination
for grand Junior beadle, the latter win
cing.
There -were three grand trustees to be
elected, and the following named were
placed in nomination: A. W. Howard of
vctaluma, \V. J- Rowe of Grass Valley,
Harry L. Simon of San Francisco, Gus
Zieper of Los Angeles, Thomas Goodwin
of San Francisco and Charles D. Peck
ham of Watsonville. Howard, Rowe and

CHICO. May 9.â This has been another

a political point of view.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
To-morrow there will be no special dem
onstration, but on Saturday -night the
street fair will close with a carnival on
the streets.
.The brilliant scenes of last night were
repeated on the Midway of the street
fair to-night. The grand stand was crowd
ed and the exercises on the throne were
of an interesting order. The feature of
the evening was a contest among the
spielers to see which one's lungs appeared
to be leather-lined and copper-riveted Tlie
result created no end of fun.
Some of the floats of the labor unions
were quite elaborate. One by the carpen
ters, represented a log cabin, the home cf
an early settler, while in another was
shown a perfectly constructed modern
house. Another float represented a
butcher shop and still another a printing
office. A barber shop was shown where
the charge was 15 cents, and where the
customer was getting splendid treatment.
On the other side of the float was a 10
cent shop, where the victim was being
patched up with courtplaster, while his
tormentor suspended a nicked razor over
his head. The streets were crowded along
the line of march and there was much en
thusiasm. Â¦ âÂ¦ '
SACRAMENTO, May 9.â Between 2300
and 3000 members of the thirty odd unions
contained in the central bodies here
marched in the Labor day parade, which
was held this afternoon as a feature of
the street fair. A general holiday had
been declared and all the printing offices,
newspaper offices, the great railroad shops
and all the banks and business houses
were closed during the afternoon. The
May Queen and her maids of honor ap
peared in line with their, stylish turnouts
and were heartily received.

The fight for the honor of , entertaining
the department delegates next year is
waxing warmer, each of the cities that
would be the host, Sacramento, Los An
geles and Hanford, doing its utmost to
pull the strings its way. Hanford ap
pears at present to be the choice of the
majority, but the matter will remain in
doubt until to-morrow afternoon. <
To-night's programme consisted of an
open-air concert by the encampment
band, a grand . concert and exhibition of
moving pictures of war scenes and a re
ception by the "Women's Relief Corps to
the department officers and delegates of

The "politics" of the encampment is in
full swing and considerable wirepulling is
evident in some directions. Colonel Stone
will, it seems, not have the rank of de
partment commander conferred upon him
without opposition, as was at first be
lieved, for another candidate entered the
field to-day, backed by* a number of the
strong delegations. The new man is H.
E. Parker of Fresno, and it is said he
wields considerable Influence among the
delegates. San Franciscp posts, however,
are solid for Stone as are also a number
of other strong posts. THere are several
candidates for the two vice commanders'
posts, C. T. Rice of Riverside seeming to
lead for the office of senior vice com
mander. The Rev. Dr. Drahms, chaplain
of San Quentin Prison, who is the nation
al as well as the department chaplain of
the G. A. R., will, without doubt, be re
elected, and Dr. Thomas A. Keebles of
Yountville will probably succeed himself
as department medical director.
Lpon reassembling, the committee on
credentials reported and the roll was
called, showing the largest attendance
ever known in the history of the Depart
ment of California and Nevada. Reports
of the department commander, senior vice
and Junior vicj; commanders, medical di
rector, chaplain, adjutant general, quar
termaster general, department Inspector,
chief musterine officer and Judge advo
cate were next presented, and adopted.
Adjutant General T. C. Masttller's report
showed a greater loss In membership of
the order by death ! and other I causes
than during any "previous year in the his
tory of the department. | A committee
from the Women's Relief Corps visited
the veterans during the afternoon ses
sion and presented their organization's
annual report. An adjournment was then
taken to 10 a. m. to-morrow..
Great Attendance Recorded.
The opening session of the thirty-fourth
annual encampment of the Department
of California and Nevada was called to
order at 10:30 a. m. by Department Com
mander G. M. Mott, and as a number of
the delegates, among them several of the
department officers, were not present, the
matter of seating the delegates was laid
over till the afternoon. ~ i-
The veterans are loud In their praise of
the provisions made for their comfort
and entertainment by the people of Pa
cific Grove, and it is the universal com
ment that never before has an- encamp
ment been received with such royal hos
pitality as Is here accorded. The splen
didly bedecked town, the hearty greet
ings of its citizens, the splendid weather,
the record-breaking attendance and, last
and greatest of all, the anticipated visit
of the President, all combine to make
them feel that they are indeed honored
guests.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 9.â That the
present Grand Army encampment is the

Interests as to sharing the benefits of

terms on which the shorts will be allowed
to cover Is, of course, of great impor

to-day, apparently on authority that the
figures at which Northern Pacific sold to
day were far above any terms which it
would be thought of exacting from the

It was a very notable fact that through
out the most acuto period of_to-day's f dis
turbance there was nothing heard to indi

collapse was attributed exclusively to
overextension of credits used in holding
stock which it was not designed to keep,
but to sell at a higher price. TRe shock
which caused the collapse was the North

harm which might result from the North

second hour of to-day's stock market was
never seen before. After a sale had been
made at a fixed price a broker would
throw in an additional block at anywhere
from 5 to 10 points lower, without stop

for his offering. The extent of the de

The hope of relief from the : conditions
Announcements by J. P. Morgan & Co.
and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., who. respectively
represent the two contesting parties In
Northern Pacific, that they would not re
quire deliveries of the stock to-day, meant
a respite of one day at least from ruin
for the shorts in the stock. Late in the
day Street & Norton announced that
they also would not require deliveries of
the stock. This i firm ' has been credited
with acting for James ; R. Keene, and
bought 200,000 shares of Northern Pacific
on Monday last, loaning 150,000 shares
that night and calling in the greater part
of it the next day, thus disclosing, the
corner in the stock. The theory that
Keene's campaign had been directed
toward a squeeze of the shorts was some
what shaken by this leniency toward its
victims. It was significant also tttat, al
though the parties to the contest for con
trol showed their willingness to, relieve
the shorts by remitting the requirement
to deliver stock, they failed to come to
any mutual agreement to lend the stock,
such as was proposed by one party last
night. The surmise seems warranted
from this unwillingness of either party
to let any of their stock get out of their
hands, even to relieve the shorts, â¢ that
there was continued doubt in the minds
of both as to where the actual control of
the property lies. Representatives ; of
both parties made emphatic claims to

the control and the other that they - se
cured it. ;â¢ V'> ':. '.'Â¦
great in any one's mind as to justify the
extent of the collapse in prices. But the
delicate situation of the market, due to
overextension of speculation, made It vul
nerable to this stock. The decline, once In
force, gained cumulative strength. Spec
ulators' margins were wiped out and
brokers had to sell the securities placed
with them as collateral to save them
selves from loss, thus adding to .the
weight of the selling. The shrinkage in
the market value of securities placed with
bankers as collateral made it necessary
that - they Should demand Increased col

lators were holding stocks. With credits
reduced, further sales of stocks had to be
made, and so it came from every quarter.
Battle for Northern Pacific Shares.
The importance attached to the North
ern Pacific episode was made clear by the
eagerness of all classes to learn all devel
opments concerning it and the immediate
effect of any announcement regarding it
upon the stock market. The upward Fhoot
to $1000 a share was the effective cause of
the greatest demoralization in the mar
ket. The announcement later in the day
of the measures for the relief of , the
shorts and the relapse in the price of
stock to 300 allayed the demoralization al
most immediately. . ,

Closing of the Exchange Followed by
Scramble in Snorter's Court.
LONDON. May 9.â Not in the memory
o . the oldest stock broker in London has
there been such a panic as prevailed this
afternoon In Americans. After the clos
ing of the Stock Exchange hundreds of
dealers endeavored to struggle into the
narrow confines of Snorter's Court, where
outside dealings are done, in efforts to
raise or reduce, as the case might be,
Americans to New York parity. Sudden
ly there developed a terrific slump in
Union Pacific, which was knocked down
20 points In as many seconds. St. Paul
Buffered, almost as badjy. Large and
small brokers rushed to the scene until
Throckmorton street became impassable.
The rain poured down, but the excited
crowd .did not heed it. Parties formed
themselves into flying wedges in endeav
ors to force-' their way into the center of
Snorter's Court.. at which spot the prin
cipal dealing was done. All sorts of con
ditions and prices were shouted at the top
of the operators* voices. Down, down
went Americans. The leading houses
sent urgent orders to buy or sell, but
found It almost impossible to have their
orders executed. Rails of every descrip
tion . were quoted at rock bottom prices,
and steel and other securities fell in sym
pathy. Then, without rhyme or reason, a
reaction set in. Up and down Â¦ went Amer
icans. After about half an hour of this
panicky speculation a more reasonable
feeling prevailed and stocks rose to with
in a. few points of their price when the
Stock Exchange closed. But long after
the usual hours hundreds of stock brok
ers, most of them drenched to the skin,
traded in the hope of getting clear before
to-morrow's opening. â¢ Â¦ -- , .
Upon receipt, of the Wall-street quota
tions a panic seized the Glasgow Stock
Exchange and a wild scene was wit
nessed, the brokers scrambling to rid
themselves of their holdings of stock.
PANTC BEACHES LOITDOIT.
There was a strong feeling this morn-
Ing before proceedings had commenced on
the Stock Exchange that a panic could
be averted only by the- strongest meas
ures and with the greatest difficulty.. The
fact was apparent that the corner in
Northern Pacific was still unbroken. Tne
excited bidding last night to secure the
stock for delivery to-day made that very
apparent The first steps to avert the
panic were devoted to circulating reports
that the conferences between the con
tending interests in Northern Pacific,
which continued In one form or another
throughout the night, had resulted in a
compromise which would free the shorts
In the stock from their compromised.posi
tion. These efforts proved utterly inef
fective In face of the first quotations for
Northern Pacific on the tape. The price
paid for the stock ran quickly up to $200
per share and then to $300, to $500 and
then to $700 per share on regular transac
tions and $1000 per share for cash. The
cash price paid meant that unfortunate
shorts who were unable to . borrow the
stock last night for delivery to-day had
to pay whatever cash price the engineers
of the corner chose to ask for it. Tha
figures indicated in these opening trans
actions meant ruin for a very large out
standing interest in the stock. The per
ception nf this fact was the principal im
pelling cause in producing the demoraliza
tion in the stock market. The concerted
effort to support^ the market by buying
all stocks which might be offered, which
is always the most effective manner of
dissuading persons from selling and which
was undertaken, according to the current
belief in Wall street, by some of the most
ncwerful capitalists in the country, was
swept away like a whirlpool under the
Thousand a Share for Cash.
AH classes of employes in the Stock Ex
change district were under tremendous
pressure throughout the day. The im
pression produced by contact with those
was due to their coolness and nerve un
der the most trying and exciting circum
s-tances. Brokers, messenger boys, tele
phone boys, clerks and the like learned
during the last few weeks to waste little
time in demonstrations. They do things
in the quickest and shortest manner and
sc made things go smoothly to-day at a
period when lack of coolness might have
meant disaster t"| many persons.
In the brokers' offices many men sat
who were reduced to absolute ruin as a
result of fifteen minutes' proceedings on
the Stock Exchange. Some of these have
been made opulent within a few weeks
past as a result of the unparalleled rise
in prices. With the true gambling spirit
they have replaced all their winnings on
new ventures on each successful turn.
To-day's drop, therefore, wiped them, all
out. In many cases one could see the
gambler's fortitude with which the
chances of gairi were accepted. But the
glittering attraction of this market has
_broughtinto it a constantly increasing as
sortment of more staid and inexperienced
speculatorsâ *nen and women â¢who have
brought long standing hoards from secret
places and from savings bank ' deposits
with the determination to make one suc
cessful stroke and then retire with the
proceeds The" demonstrations from this
class, which includes many women specu
lators, furnished the hysterical scenes and
tei.Eations of the day.
The state of excitement was very ap
parent all through the financial district
during the period of the panic, but there
were few sensational scenes. Now and
then a white-faced woman would peer
frcm a cab outside a broker's office and
would be driven off in a faint condition
after receiving a message from the Inte
rior. Whenever any near approach could
be made to a ticker or to a board on
which quotations were posted there were
great throngs of excited speculators
scrambling for a view of the course of the
market. But the real stress of the occa
sion came upon the men Â¦who were shut
up in either their private offices or those
of brokers, or who were struggling and
fighting on the floor of the exchange. The
outside country could obtain little idea of
the actual occurrences on the exchange,
as the brokers are remote from the public
galleries in their temporary quarters in
the Produce Exchange, and are half shut
off from view by the sixteen-foot wall.
Speculators "Ruined in Short Order.
The banks have been so well protected
by recent extensions of the margins ex
rcted in the market value of collateral
over the amount of loans placed that they
had little to fear short of an absolute wip
ing out of market values. The shrinkage
cf collateral made it necessary for the
banks in many cases to exact additional
collateral during the day, and this added
much to the distress for a time. But in
â¢the late dealings the principal banks In
| the financial district agreed to form a
pool and raise a fund to loan the money
i at rates down to 6 per cent on the Stock
I Exchange. The bid for money had been
I run up to 60 per cent and was threatening
to keep alive the panic. The dozen banks
quickly, came to an agreement to raise
$16,000,000. with implied willingness to in
! crease the sum if necessary. There were
very heavy loans placed also by indi
vidual banks, ranging' in some cases to
$25,000,000 ajid S3O.00O.OOO. Through the early
part of the day bankers exacted the mar
ket rate for loans, but with the growing
need to suppress the panic offered the rate
down to 6 per cent. Old customers of the
banks were not charged over 6 per cent
at any time, but when outsiders came in
asking for new loans the law of supply
and demand was allowed to run its course.
Sixty Per Cent for Money.
NEW YORK, May 9.â Bitter stress
developed in Wall street by the
second hour of trading on the
Stock Exchange to-day. The vio
lence of the commotion had spent
much of its force, at least. for the time
being, when the chairman's gavel fell an
nouncing the close of the day's proceed
ings. The casualties were great and the
field of battle was strewn with the wound
ed, and may be with the dying. But of
actual fatalities none were recorded of
Importance during the day. During the
height of the panic rumors of insolvencies
were handed about more quickly than
they could be reported. But no confirma
tions could be had of the intimations of
financial wreck. Those against whom the
rumors pointed refused even to show any
signs of distress and professed themselves
ready to meet* all obligations. In more
than one instance the answer to these
rumors wis for a representative of the
house to go* upon the Stock Exchange and
place loans to a large amount,. as indi
cating the abundance of resources at
hand. But notwithstanding these and sim
ilar devices for keeping up credit and con
fidence, the fact was too obvious from the
crash of values on the exchange that
credits and borrowing power were shrink
ing at too prodigous rates not to leave the
mind of , the whole financial world in a
condition of intense strain. But the indi
cations at the close of the day were
strong that the principal damage had
been wrought upon the speculative class
or upon holders of securities on margin
for whatever purpose.

into the system of management of the
royal household in order to correct any
abuses and wastes. The sum of Â£110.000
out of the total of Â£470,000 which it was

/Their Opponents:
How Morgan-Hill Interests Outwitted
NE"W YORK. May 9.â To-night an indi
vidual who has been party to the confer
ence relating to the strained conditions
in Wall street this week made statements
and explanations which give' to the con
test in "Wall street a different construc
tion than was generally accepted down
town to-day. He said:
To-morrow morning Kuhn. Loeb & Co. will
publish a notice saying they will let out their
Northern Pacific to shorts at J150. A positive
statement is mads to-night that to-morrow J.
P. Morgan & Co. will notify shorts that they
will be released on short obligations to Morgan
& Co. on the basis of $130: This will be the
penalization. The shorts will get no stock from
Slorgan & Co. They will sret only freedom.
The Burlington deal -will be known to-morrow
as an accomplished fact. It has already been
accomplished. The Morgan-Hill Interests con
trol the Northern Pacific stock and the board
of directors has absolute power to close thÂ»
Northern Paclnc-Burlington merger without th9
consent of two-thirds of Northern Pacific stock.
The old laws of the Northern Pacific prescribed
that two-thirds of the stock should assent to
such a transaction as the present deal. This
provision, still printed In the manual, accepted
as authentic, has misled the opponents of tha
Morgan-Hill plans, because in the reorganiza
tion the two-thirds provision was abolished and
ahe power was vested solely in the board of
directors.
This release by Morgan-Hill and the letting
out of actual stock no longer useful to them
by the opposing Interests Is expected to relieve
the tension and smooth out the complications
in Wall street to-morrow.
In the light of these facts and conditions it
becomes apparent why Morgan-Hill Interests
declined the propositions of their opponents to
loan stocks to shorts pro rata.

SEEKING A FINANCIAL TKTJCE.
Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and Harriman Syn â¢
dicate Favor Reasonable Peace.
NEW YORK, May 9.â Night closed upon
the eventful, trying day without definite
settlement as to the Northern Pacific, the
central figure in the fierce struggle. It
was anticipated that there would be an
agreement for settlement with the shorts,
but it was evidently not finally concluded.
Shortly after the market closed it was
â¢semi-officially announced that a basis of
settlement had been practically agreed
upon and that it would be clinched before
nightfall. At 5 o'clock, however, Kuhn,
Loeb & Co., whom the street accepts as
masters of the situation, announced that
nothing could or would be said as to the
stock to-day. There was a spirit of com
promise and conciliation in the air, but
until it should bear the fruit of definite
settlement the situation in Northern Pa
cific was felt to be a menace to the whole
market. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and the men
enlisted with them in the Harriman syn
dicate seem disposed to a reasonable
peace, and on the outside the strongest
Influences of the iinanclal world are mov
ing determinedly for a financial truce
that will protect the market, avert panic
and restore confidence. In addition to an
arrangement with the shorts It Is be
lieved that the settlement of the fight will
also involve the future relations of the
Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, Great
Northern and Burlington. Men close to
the Harriman-Kuhn, Loeb & Co. group
insisted that the deal for the sale of the
Burlington to the Great Northern would
be carried through. Granting that Harri
man, Kuhn. Loeb & Co. and their asso
ciates are dominant in Northern Pacific,
it is assumed that they will claim and
win a voice in the future of Burlington.
It is believed that the settlement with the
shorts in Northern Pacific will be made
at 200 or under. Kuhn, Loeb &" Co. say
they deprecate the policy of the third In
terest in taking enormous profits from
the shorts, and their friends avow regret
that outsiders suffer.
A settlement with the shorts would
clear the situation materially, but there
would still remain the great problem in
railroad politics of the future of the road
itself. On that point the following state
ment from, a member of the Harriman
syndicate is significant:
."Northern Pacific is in control of Kuhn,
Loeb & Co. The only thing that can affect
this control will be the possible .inability
of certain people to deliver the stock to
them. J. P. Morgan & .Co. are in the
same position."
The struggle of the financial giants,
which broke the most remarkable move
ment that American stocks have ever had,
dates back but a fortnight. B. H. Harri
man and his associates, so they relate the
story in the street, discovered that
brokers representing J. P. Morgan & Co.
were buying Union Pacific. Harriman at
once began increasing his own holdings,
buying on a market that rapidly ad
vanced, and when sure of control sub
mitted a proposition for some basis of
agreement as to the control of Burlington,
just acquired by the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific. That offer was reject
ed. On Monday last there began a sen
sational movement in Northern Pacific,
and the public got the first intimation of
the battle for supremacy. Street and Nor
ton took all of the stock they could get,
seemingly without regard to prices. Much
of the stock sold to them was for short
account and could not be delivered. It
developed finally that there were three
large interests in the property, two seek
ing its management and the third a spec
ulative profit. Both the Harriman syndi
cate and the Morgan-Hin Interests
claimed control, and the predicament of
the shorts was made worse by the fear
of both the Harriman and Morgan syn
dicates to lend the stocks to the shorts.
It was this fear that led Kuhn, Loeb &
Co. of the Harriman interests to seek an
understanding with Morgan. & Co. as to
the lending of stock to shorts.
To have loaned without an understand
ing was to court the danger of losing the
stock and possibly the dearly purchased
opportunity to control. The shorts
learned yesterday that they were severely
cornered and made frantic efforts to se
cure stock. The movement for their re
lief began last night, but the failure of
the leaders to agree left them in desper
ate straits. There was some consolation
in the extension of time for delivery, but
that after all was merely deferring the

failed, tried to stow away on the Oceanic
Company's steamship Sierra yesterday,
but failed. He was caught hid away in
the chain locker . just as the vessel was
leaving the dock. He was about to be
bundled ashore when he produced a roll
of English banknotes and paid his full
fare. Had it not been for a brutal attack
Cribb made on a cripple last Wednesday
on the Oceanic wharf he might have got
away without. detection, but when the
news of his conduct got wind everybody
on the ship was eager to find him; .

Memory.
The funeral of Colonel James R. Dickey
took place Wednesday afternoon and was
largely attended. The Rev. George G.
Eldredge of St. John's Presbyterian
Church conducted the services at a -Mis
sion-street undertaking parlor. Mrs.
Dickey, wife of Colonel Dickey, was an
active member of Dr. Heznphill's Calvary
Church, and in the absence of Dr. Hemp
hill the Rev. Mr. Eldredge was called to
conduct the service. The floral tributes
consisted of twenty-five beautiful pieces
a,nd several wreaths. In the sentiment of
(sympathy expressed in floral offerings
many well-known citizens joined.
The officiating clergyman read the ser
vice provided by the Hook of Prayer. The
Press Club Quartet, consisting of Fletcher
Tilton, Charles Goettinsr, D. M. Warde
and Charles Parent, sang "Still, Still
With Thee." "Consolation" and "Good
night." The parlors where the. service
was held were appropriately decked with
flowers. The pallbearers were: P. B.

Harriman Â¦wants a first-class railroad
man to fill the position of traffic manager
or, mere properly, traffic adviser for his
gigantic pool of railroad lines. These lines
include the Southern Pacific system,
TTnion Pacific, Oregon Railway and Xavi
pation Company, Oregon Short Line,
Illinois Central and Chicago and Alton.
The Dosition has been tendered to Paul
Morton of Chicago, second vice president
of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
system, by Harriman and refused. The
fi'eld of railroad men eligible for the post
was then looked over and J. C. Stubbs'
name -was mentioned, but he was rot
engaged, as he is deemed too valuable a
man to be taken from the Southern Pa
cific Harriman decided that Morton was
the man for the place and again offered it

ponents testify that the petitioner had no
brother, but six sisters â Elke, Iisse, Indes,
Ihoure,- Menese and Masse Chan. Iisse
married Solomon Ellas Friedman and to
them was born Julius Friedman, to whose
estate Liebe Friedman now lays claim as
an aunt of the deceased. ? â¢-.-â¢
Four residents of far-away Hasenpot,
Kailand, Russia, have offered their testi
mony in support of the claim of Liebe
Friedman that she is the next of , kin and
sole heir at law of the late Julius Fried
man, the well-known capitalist of this
city, who died about two years ago. Liebe
Friedman claimed in her petition for dis
tribution to her of two-thirds of deced
ent's estate, one-third of the same being
devised to charity, that she was the wid
ow of Wolff Friedman and the sister of
Iisse Friedman, mother 'of the late Julius
Friedman, and hence his aunt. In view
of this relationship, there being no other
heirs living so closely related, she claimed
the riffht to distribution.

Harriman's Dlan is to- have as the traf
fic adviser for his big syndicate of rail
roads a man who is popular with the ship
ping public as well as a practical railroad
man. The one who will hold the position
will bo expected to make a study of the
Harriman roads, watch the business,
make suggestions and order changes
where he considers them necessary. His
headquarters will be at Chicago. It is
thought some one will be appointed to the
place at once.

to him. At the present time MSrton is
considering the proposition., but an inti
mate friend of his who lives in this city
said yesterday that he felt almost certain
that Morton would not accept the respon
sible post.
Morton has been second vice president
of the Santa Fe road for the past five
years. As a practical railroad traffic man
ager he is conservatively considered the
foremost in the United States. He iÂ« a
man of splendid proportions, being six
feet three Inches tall. He is in the
prime of life, being 44 years of ege, and
has the reputation of being a man who
can begin work at S o'clock In
the morning and stay at his desk
managing railroad affairs until late
in the evening- month after month with
out showing the slightest eign of fatigue.
This is just the man Harriman wants and
to whom he is willing to pay an enormous
salary. â¢ Morton, however, though not of
a sentimental temperament, assured., a
close friend recently that Â¦ he -would re
main with the Santa Fe as long as it
wanted him.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
IT is rarely that two ships see as
much of each other as have the
Eurasia and Dowan Hill during the
past six months. In fact, during five
months of that time the history of
one vessel has practically been that of
the other. Captains Hughes and Puxley
have almost Identical stories to tell, with
this exception: Some of. the crew of the
Dowan Hill caught Captain Puxley up
town and beat him. Several futile
attempts /-were also made to waylay the
captain and mates of the Eurasia by cer
tain members of the crew, who, finding;
themselves foiled, threw a bottle aboard
iilled with some explosive that came near
doing a great amount of damage. There
is a ble dent in the break of the poop
where the bottle struck. â¢â¢ . Â¦
The British ship Eurasia sailed from
Hamburg on November 28, and the four
masted bark Dowan Hill from Newcastle,
Kngland, on November 24. Both vessels
were in company in the North Sea, They
did not see each other again until Feb
ruary 9, when both were in a heavy gale
off Cape. Horn. On the Eurasia every
thing was blown out of the gaskets, save
a. small staysail, while, the Dowan Hill
had her lower staysails split, the forecas
tle doers burst in and every thins: movable
on; deck washed overboard. Captain
Hughes could just keen the Eurasia's
head ud to the wind when tho Dowan Hill
came bearing down on the starboard tack.
After some clever handling the latter
vessel passed under the Eurasia's stern,
but so close that every man on each ship
could be made out. . â¢ . '
The two vessels again parted company
the next day, only to again meet on! the
Farallones on May 1. The Eurasia got the
flrst tow and about noon was anchored
off Meiggs wharf. Six hours later the
Dowan Hill came in and anchored close
to the Eurasia. A couple of days ago the
Eurasia docked at Union-street wharf
and yesterday the Dowan Hill waÂ» put In i
the berth on the other side of the same
pier. Both are chartered to load wheat,
and the chances are that they will sail in
company lor England.
Captain Hughes expects to get quick
dispatch here, and in consequence tried
hard to keep his men by the ship. Sun
day last a number of them, tried to desert,
but were caught by First Mate Oldfleld.
During the night, however, they got away
and ever since they have been trying to
waylay the captain and mates in order to
give them a beating. When they heard
now Captain Puxley had been mauled by
some of his crew on Market street they
thought it would be a good idea to serve
Captain Hughes in the same" manner.
Monday night they nearly caught Mate
Oldfleld on Davis street, and Tuesday
night they surrounded Captain Hughes
on East street, but the appearance of a
policeman made them scatter. i
To understand what follows it is neces
sary to explain that the employes of the
Harbor Commission are repairing Union
street wharf, and last Wednesday a space
about twelve feet sauare was uncovered
in the middle of the wharf.' Wednesday
after dark the deserters paid the ship a
visit and several of them called upon Cap
tain Hughes to show himself. A few sec
onds later the loaded bottle was thrown,
and when the crash came the men ran
away. Four of them ran into the open
hole in the wharf and nearly perished
from cold before they were rescued. They
dared not call for assistance, and had to
hang on to piles for half an hour until the
disturbance was over. Then they were
helped on to the wharf again . by the
watchman and quickly made their escape.
A meeting of the executive committee of
the Carriage-makers' Association will be
held to-night at Native Sons' Hall. Many
of the strikers were willing' to return to
work yesterday, but their offers of help
were declined for the present. This strike
will probably be settled by mutual conces
sions during the next forty-eight hours.
Upon the results of the meeting of the
San Francisco Labor Council to-night
practically depends a solution of the prob
lem. The executive committee has pre
pared its report, favoring moderation.
Should it decide that all unions should be
called out in a sympathetic strike -none
can decide what the result will be.
Mayor Phelan has not as yet called the
conference that was to have been held in,
his office on ! Wednesday afternoon be
tween employers and employes. The mat
ter is still under consideration. Some peo
ple say that questions of politics are in
volved and the Mayor does not want to be
involved in the controversy even as an
arbitrator. So the matter rests at pres
ent.
Therefore in ' considering the present labor
situation the Building Trades Council desires
the public to understand that it approves of
legitimate unionism with a Just and consistent
retard for the rights of all.
p. h. McCarthy,
President Building Trades Council.
O. A. TVEITMOE, Secretary Building Trades
Council.
The Building Trades Council recognizes as
business agents, in addition to its own, only
such persons as have been reported to and ap
proved by the Building Trades Council, and
these are as follows: Foi^the councilâ H. - M.
Saunders. William Danlelson; Cement Workers
â T. K. Ryan; Carpenters â J. J. Swanson; Elec
trical Workersâ R. G. Alexander; Plumbersâ
J. Lftyton; Paintersâ R. W. Hause; Glaziers
and Ornamental Glass Workersâ S. E. Hopper;
VarniBhers* and Polishers' Union No. 134â
Joseph Tulte; Laborers' Protective and Benevo
lent Association â William O'Donnell. And
statements appearing In the newspapers com
ing from self-constituted business agents are
not to be credited as expressive of the opinion
of the Building Trades Council. -
Recognized Business Agents.
In view of the foregoing the Building Trades
Council desires to notify all affiliating unions
that in matters general in their character and
directed by the institutions other than the
Building Trades Council the council will not
allow any fines to be Imposed for violations of
any supposed rule referring to those general
matters, unless said union first brings the
grievance to the attention of the Building
Trades Council to the end that the entire fam
ily of building trades be allowed to pass upon
the advisability of the Imposition of such fine;
nor will the Building Trades Council counte
nance any interference with the calling out of
any of Its members from any department of the
building Industry by persons desirous of en
tangling the Building Trades Council with out
side and foreign difficulties.
Secondâ The Building Trades Council de
sires it understood by. the public that it lends
Its support, moral and financial, to matters
only with which it has had to do with the
inauguration and arrangement of details In
their entirety; that the Building Trades Coun
cil never has and never will become a party
to anything with which It haB not had the full
management as above stated; that those who
are now desirous of making the Building
Trades Council responsible for and in a meas
ure a party to. the present difficulties between
employers and employes have in the recent
past been found in the same capacity endeav
oring through other channels, to disrupt and
destroy the efficiency of and usefulness in the
building industry of this institution, which
for many years lias occupied the position of
safety valve in the labor movement, and has
successfully maintained the dignity of labor,
with the full appreciation of the employer;
that the Building Trades Council discounten
ances certain interviews which convey the idea
that the employers of labor 83 a class are
opposed to the best interests of organized la
bor and its legitimate requests, when pre
sented properly and in a spirit of fairnessâ
the best illustration of which lies in the fact
that the Building Trades Council has upon
different- occasions signified its willingness to
submit matters of vital importance to the
building industry entirely to the Merchants'
Association of this city for adjustment or ar
bitration, and further has always . had the
'editorial support of all the leading news
papers of the city, when matters of general
public importance were being considered.
Must Have Entire Control.
Because of the many statements and inter
views published within the last . few days,
many of which purport to come from repre
sentatives of the building industry attaching
to themselves the important title of Business
Agent, and by that means connecting Â¦ by In
nuendo and otherwise the name of the Build
ing Trades Council with the present contro
versy, the Building Trades Council desires tc
lay before the public, as clearly as possbile
the position occupied by it and ita afnliatins
unions In the building- business:
; Firstâ The Building- Trades Council at no
time has had anything to do with the condi
tions which have led up to the said contro
versy, either in an official or unofficial man
ner.
Iseitner side was prepared to make any
statements regarding existing' codltions.
President Johnson nas a sore throat, and
Organizer Pierce and Secretary Rosen
berg of the Labor Council had no time to
dictate statements. Both sides admitted
that there was no change in the situation.
The Building- Trades Council has be
come interested in the striker At the meet
ing held last night Louis Chester, chair
man of the executive committee, present
ed the following statement, which was
adopted:
Reinforced by sympathizers from the
butchers, bakers, barbers, cooks, confec
tioners and other unions, the striking
waiters and cooks. made a demonstration,
last nlg-ht, followine the same lingi of
parade as on last Saturday night. The
same banners were carried and the same
cries were uttered in the front of non
union restaurants. The waitresses occu
pied carriages . furnished . by the Hack
men's Union. Â¦Â¦'.'â¢' f .
As usual, the greatest display was made
in front of the Market-street -restaurant
owned bv President Johnson, of the res
taurant proprietors' organization. A force
or police was on hand to prevent any dis
tumance, but was not needed. Jonnson's
and other non-union restaurants were
closed early in the evening to avoid
trouble. > .. v -

Chicago was demoralized' by the ' panic in
Wall street, and the market .declined from
72%c to 70%c, recovering to 71%c. The local
feeling was bearish on account of /the good
crop prospects. A cable * from Paris reported
the French crop not damaged. Most commis
sion houses had. selling orders at the opening.

SEAL ESTATE TEA1TSACTIONS.
NEW YORK. May 9 âThe threatening con
ditions of affairs which developed in the stock
market yesterday culminated to-day in" one of
the fiercest twists ever experienced in Wall
street. The corner in Northern Pacific was
the Impelling cause of the crisis, owing to the
threat contained in the ruinous terms forced
upon the shorts in that stock that disastrous
liquidation would be forced at other points.
Strenuous efforts were made by the most pow
erful financial interests in the country to avert
the threatened trouble and almost unlimited
supporting orders were placed In the market
for the opening in anticipation of the heavy
selling which was to come. Reassuring ex
pressions were , disseminated from the principal
parties in interest to the Northern Pacific con- v
troversy designed to dissuade alarmed holders
from precipitate selling of their stocks, but
all these precautions proved unavailing in the
face of the unmistakable index afforded by
the price of Northern Pacific that the corner
in that stock was intact and therefore that
the bitter controversy over the control of the
property was still unsettled. "When Northern
Pacific began selling at 200 and 300 and 500
and even as high as 700 on regular transactions
and at 1CC0 for cash the appalling possibilities
of the forced covering of the largest shortages
at those terms weakened the whole market
and prices crumbled away with the utmost vio
lence during the second hour. The volume of
the blocks unloaded and the reckless disregard
of the price which they brought were without
precedent in the memory of the oldest trader.
Before any check could come to the tremendous
liquidation Delaware and Hudson had lest 59
points, Manhattan 3). Union Pacific 38, Rock
Island 3oÂ»i. Atchison ZlVt. St. Paul 30%. Mis
souri Pacific 22 and a long list of others from
5 to 30 points. The predominance of the North
em Pacific corner on the situation was demon- '
strated by the quick rally in the market when
the announcement was made that the contend
ing interests in Northern Pacific would not re
quire deliveries of stock to-day. Pretty broad
intimations were also thrown out that such
deliveries would not b<: required so long as
present conditions last. The exemption of
Northern Pacific from the usual clearing-house
requirements of delivery still further allayed
apprehension. The quotations of the stock fell I
back to 300 both on cash and on regular trans
actions after these announcements and there
was a scramble to cover on the part cf pro- '
fessional shorts. There were large numbers
of bargain hunters also In the market. The
combined effect of this buying was reflected
in rallies extending in Delaware and Hudson
to 55, Manhattan 34. Rock Island 33, Atchison
30. United States Steel preferred 20. actually
carrying the stock 2hi points over yesterday's
close: Missouri Pacific :Â». Louisville 23, Amal
gamated Copper 22. St. Paul 21. and a large
nuciber of other stocKs from 5 to 20 points.
This rally did not fully hold. The market
became mu/h quieter during the latter part
of the dayÂ£ but the feverishness and nervous
ness continued. Even the action of the bank
ers by agreement in lending $16,000,000 on
'Change at 6 per cent failed to relieve the close
from such very erratic movements and renewed
bad breaks In price. The extension of shrink
age in the value of securities and the corre
sponding decrease in credentials made money
very stringent and 60 per cent was bid at one
time by those seeking accommodation. The ac
tion of the associated banks forced the rate
down to 6 per cent. The feverish tone of the
market at the close and the fact that the con
troversy which has precipitated the trouble was
still unsettled left thÂ« feeling of uneasiness
retaining large force in the financial district.
Selling of bonds to protect stock holders made I
that department of the market weak in sym
pathy with stocks. j
United States new 4s advanced \i on the last
call.

British pride heretofore has resented borrow

"Wall street is apparently figuring on the
cor.scli Nation of various roads to comprise
thr<e tranfcontinental lines, connecting by rail
the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean. This
movement started by the Northern Pacific se
curing control of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy to complete ita through line. The
New York Central and Pennsylvania people,
it is thought, must necessarily fall in line in
et'.f -defense, hence the rise in Atchison ccm
iron to 30 implies that the Pennsylvania road
rr.cy bo buying it fur control, and the same
theory spplies to the New York Central peo
jile in endeavoring to acquire control of the
Union Pacific road to complete its through
line to thÂ«e Pacific Cojst. Whether these im
lire.'-pions are true or false they form the basis
of rumors which in this wild market are acted
u^>on as though they were based upon" actual
fact, hence the recent rapid advance in the
price of both Union Pacific and Atchison
Flocks. It is a r>K>'. .however, tMat the New
York Central magnates were not sagacious
enough to buy in the control of Union Pacific
whfn its stocks soid down to $6 a share instead
of now paring v.p to 13o for it. It is also un
fr.rtunate that the Pennsylvania people did
BOt buy Atchison common stock when it said
at J3 a shsre and the preferred at $1S as re
cently as six y<Â»arE ago. instead of paying 103

jircpcsition buying properties for consolidation
purp'-iPs 2t a bankrupt price and at a tre
mendously advanced figure, especially when it
:f taken into consideration that the connections
f.re for ail time.
â¢'It in not the New York speculators who
have principally contributed to this extraord
inary furor. The local outsiders are far from
being the most sanguine participants. Their
Bttltude is in the main cautious and not a
lew of them are distrustful of the present
large of prices. The most courageous buyers
Ere from the West and South. The two past
years of proFpcrity Hi the interior have ac
cumulated an unprecedented amount of un
employed funds, and the owners of those sur
pluses have formed such sanguine estimates of
the growing wealth of the country -that they
are willing to stake these accumulations with
out stint in anticipating the future national
expansion. It is very largely from the infiux
from these distant oouices that the immense
laying orders are constantly coming en the
market, and. as the operations chime in with
the interests of capitalists engaged in great
industrial and railroad 'deals, ' they receive
every encouragement from the local million
sire interests. The negotiations of the great
railroad alliances have involved immense tem
licrary purchases of stocks by railroad cap
italists which have furnished an important
Ftin-.ulart to the rise in prices, and, so long
as these 'deals' are continued, the speculative
boors vill be backed by this very effective
source of Â¦ support. But it Is to be kept in
rr.ind that many ttocks procured for these
temporary "deal" purposes will have to be mar
keted as soon as practicable, and the question
is of much interest as to what may happen
if these securities are shifted upon the distant
end less closely informed buyers of the in
tcrirr. This is a contingency to be sharply
Â¦watched, as it will nave more to do with the
winding up of the boom than any other in
fluence. At the moment, however, there are
few indications that this culmination of the
great speculation is roar at? hand, and. if
further railroad deals are to be forthcoming,
there may be further special advances before
the end comes in sirht.

CLOSING.
There was only one topic in the markets here
to-day, namely, the crash in Americans, but
London was little affected by the collapse.
Business was virtually suspended all day. deal
ers being too nervous to make prices, and quo
tations oscillated, chiefly on trifling , transact
tions. simply responding to New York advices.
Northern Pacific began at 120. but the pur
chase of COCO shares for the Continent forced
the price to 138 l ,Â£. The opening prices in New
York showed tumbling prices and sent Northern
Pacific down to 125. Others dropped $3 to $3.
Then the street witnessed the real break . fol
lowing. Northern Pacifies were hardly men
tioned. A sudden rally of about $20 in active
stocks was caused by a report that the arbi
trageurs had compromised and that a 24
hour truce was arranged in the Northern Pa
fiflc squeeze. London was left aghast, like
a man who has just witnessed an explosion of

Dealers continue to report a very weak and
overstocked market for Eggs, and. point to
their overloaded floors. The tendency is to
sell, even at concessions. Some, who are es
pecially overloaded, do not ask over 15c, and
the Dairy Exchange has again marked down
its prices. Receipts from the East are now of
dally occurrence.
Cheese Is weak at the decline already noted.
While there-, is no change in the quotations
for Butter, there Is plenty on hand, and even
fine creamerie's are quoted dull. Continued
packing keeps the market relieved of some 'of
its surplus.
Receipts were 58.5C0 pounds and 286 tubs of

day. Though no statement concerning
the reasons for the unexpected request
would bÂ« isaued from -the president's of

Only two more , weeks of the present

to teach, but It was considered for the
best interests of all concerned that he go

SOUTHAMPTON. May 9.â The sixty
mile racing trial of the Shamrock I and
the Shamrock II from Southampton to
Weymouth to-day was suddenly termin
ated oft the Needles by a bad squall, dur
ing which the gaff topsail yard of the
new challenger was carried away and her
gaff crumpled up. She was forced to
abandon her contest and returned to
Southampton for repairs.
The accident was primarily due to the
carrying away of a heavy backstay, a
block of which fell and struck the deck
at Sir Thomas Lipton's feet. Had the
block fallen a foot nearer Sir Thomas
he probably would have been killed.
The Shamrock II proved herself wonder
fully well able to stand up to her can
vas. The challenger was in the lead over
the Shamrock I by two minutes and fif
teen seconds when a thick black thunder
squall came driving off the 'Hampshire
coast and the two yachts were soon rac
ing along with their lee rails hidden. The
squall blew at the rate of about twenty
knots an hour and the steamer Erin. do-
Ing a good thirteen knots, was unable to
keep up with the racers.
In this afternoon's trial the challenger
sailed twelve miles in one hour and ten
minutes.
It is expected that the trial race will
take place next Saturday.

When it is considered that there has
been a tendency of late to bring to San
Francisco and other cities of the Pacific
Coast expert men from the East to fill
the leading railway positions here, special
significance is given to the fact that Chi
cago sent West for experts in the field
of telephone management. Â¦ It is regarded
as an acceptance of coast superiority in
at least one important branch of public
utility.
The Chicago territory, served by the
lines over which Mr. Sabln has direc
tion, embraces a population of 13,000,000
people. Yet the. number of telephones In
use on the 1st of January last hardly ex
ceeded the number used by the Pacific
Coast territory, which contains only
2,500,000 people.
Since the engagement of Mr. Sabin to
direct the management of the system In
Chicago the stock of the company whose
management he has just taken has ad
vanced several points. The story goes
that holders of the stock of the Pacific
Company have made investments in Chi
cago stock. Â¦ ,
compensation is, therefore, $60,000 a year.
He was not inclined to accept new duties
and extra work when the proposition to
take hold In Chicago was first presented
to him. His personal inclinations tended
toward respite from work. Every time
he declined to entertain negotiations for
leaving San Francisco the Chicago rep
resentatives raised the salary figure until
it reached a limit that constrained him,
to accept for self-defense.
Most successful was the verdict on the
athletic contests and horse races which
were held yesterday afternoon on "Walter
Hobarfs racetrack at San Mateo. The
sports, which were strictly of an amateur
character, were held under the auspices
of the San Mateo Driving Club and the
San Mateo Athletic Club.
In the trotting race, the first event of
the day, the result remained in doubt un
til the final heat had been concluded. The
race was for three-quarters of a mile and
in five heats. There were three entries â
Tom Casey, J. Wisnom and O. Jennings.
Jennings was never in the running. Both
Casey and Â¦Wisnom secured two heats to
their credit before the final, which was
won after a spirited contest by Casey.
The results:

Points of Crossing for Over
head "Wires.
C. L. Ackerman, president of the Amer
ican District Telegraph Company, accused
\V. R. Hewitt, chief of the Department of
Electricity, of being negligent at a meet
ing of the Supervisors* Street Committee
yesterday. Ackerman stated that there
is ro disiMjsition on Hewitt's part to des
ignate the common points of crossing for
Â«j\>-rhead wires for messenger service.
"Hewitt is negligent of his duties," said
Ackerman. warmly, "and there is some
motive back of his actions. He is a whole
year behind in his work, and all he has
<1ono so far is to draw a map showing the
heights of buildings in one block of the
downtown district."
Ackerman further stated that he had
once written to Hewitt ar.d threatened to
have him removed if he did not designate
the points of common crossing.
Hewitt was not present when Acker
man made his charges, but came in short
ly afterward. He hied tiie specifications
for seven profile maps, showing the loca
tions of the points for underground dis
tricts 1 and 2, and informed the commit
tee that the work was comprehensive and
that it had taken some time to accom
plish it. The committee laid the matter
over for one week, when all interested
messenger companies will be represented.
The Finance Committee was requested
to provide funds for the paving of Mar
ket street from Van Ness avenue to Va
lencia street at an estimated cost of $22,
fitO: also for the raising of Sixth street
from Howard to Folsom. the work to cost
$3365; also for the repaying of Polk street
from Sutter to Jackson. The bill provid
ing for a Park and Boulevard Commis
sion was laid over for one week.
HEWITT IS ACCUSED OF
NEGLECTING HIS DUTIES
Has Failed to Designate Common
Terrible Terry McGovern refereed a
four-round slugging match last night at
the San Francisco Athletic Club and fur
nished as much excitement for the 1500
sweltering spectators as the contestants
themselves. He doffed his coat and dis
closed a shirt that added a few degrees to
the atmosphere, called the heavy punch
ers together and Instructed them to light
like gentlemen. .Terry's advice was for
gotten as soon as the gong sounded, and
the sluggers fought like cats on a back
yard fence. McGovern yelled to them to
"break," "get back," "whoa" and used a
few other choice expressions, but Magee
and "Soldier" Ike Allen held on like
brothers. Terry kept them fighting: dur
ing the four rounds, and In the opinion of
every cne he did morÂ© work than tha two
together. His decision In favor of Magee
was a fair one.
It was a night of heavy battling:. The
opening bout, between JoÂ© Hill and
"Jockey" Bennett, was the best of the
night. Hill won In the last round by using
some heavy rights. "Billy" Snailham
fought a la McGovern . and sent "Kid"
Parker to the land of nod with a left
swing on the chin. Frank McConnell, the
clever bantam of the Olympic Club, en
tered the ring under the name of Jones
and . surprised a stockily built youth
named Ford by knocking him down and
out in less than twenty seconds' of fight
ing. When It was all over it was discov
ered that Jones was a "ringer," and thÂ»
Amateur Athletic Association â¢will inves
tigate his conduct. "Young: Kid" McFad
den had all the better of his bout with
E. C. Edwards and would have won hand
ily had he not fouled his man. Referee
Greggalns decided against him and the
crowd applauded the decision.
"Bill" Stewart landed a heavy right on
"Billy" McDonald's jaw In the first round,
and it looked very bad for the latter. He
showed true grit, however, and returned
to the fray and eventually won out by
well- directed punches In Stewart's' mid
section. The police stopped the bout in
the third round, as Stewart was bleeding 1
badly from a cut over the left eye.
"Jockey" "Worthlngton played steeple
chase with "Young Moffatt" and won by
a length in the second round. "Reddy"
Kelly and Ted Wolff were acensed of hav
ing cold feet, and therefore did not put in
an appearance. "Nobby" Otts, who was
to have battled with Pete Coleman, alia3
Magee, was charged with the same af
fliction, but Mr. Otts indignantly denied
it in a speech from the top row of the
bleachers.

TERRY M'GOVERN
AS A REFEREE
Justice of the Peace Groezinger gave
Judgment yesterday in favor of ex-Sheriff
Henry Martin in a suit brought against
him by the Union Collection Agency to
recover the sum of $200 for alleged non
return" of process under section 4179 of the
Political Code. Incidentally. Jud^e Groez
inger administered a severe rebuke to J.
S. Reid, who was prosecuting the case
for the collection agency, of which he is
the main factor.
In his complaint Reid alleged that an
execution had not been returned by the
ex-Sheriff's deputies, but the evidence dis
closed that the execution was satisfied
end Reid's client had received his money.
Judge Groexinger characterized Reid s
procedure as outrageous in having
brought a suit to which the assignor was
r.ot a party. In fact. Reid confessed that
the assignor had not given him permis
sion to sue. and. furthermore, no damages
had been sustained.
"These 6Uits," said Judge Groezinger.
"are brought Einmly for the purpose of
harassing former Sheriffs. I know of one
In which Jules Godeau was mulcted to
the tune of $300. Godeau Â¦was surety for
ex-Sheriff Martin and judgment was re
covered against him by default. I will not
tolerate any more of such proceedings in
mv court and any one who brings a suit
of" that kind again will get himself Into
trouble."

SCORES LAWYER
IN OPEN COURT
Jt is believed by the members that there'
will be no change In the present rating of
smoking tobacco and probably none in
that of canned ' goods. The matter of a
change in cooperage ratings was dis
cussed and referred to a committee, to be
reported on. at the next regular meeting
of the classification committee. The pro
posed modification of the rules governing
ratings on mixed carloads was also pre
sented to-day but was considered only in
part. \
Probably the most important action of
the day, because it was final, was the ad
mission to membership in the committee
of the Burlington and Northwestern Rail
road and the choice of St. Louis as the
next place of meeting. The proposed
change in the time of meetings was acted
upon favorably, the time being changed
from the first Tuesday in May and No
vember of each year to the second Tues
day in January and April of each year.
The application of the Davenport, Rock
Island and Northwestern Railroad for
membership in the committee was pre
sented to-day, but : owing to the recent
change in the management of the road
the committee deemed it best to defer ac
tion until its next regular meeting.
At 5:30 o'clock the committee adjourned,
to convene again at 2 p. m. to-morrow, at
which time it. is hoped- to conclude the
business on hand. The recess to-morrow
morning is taken to enable the traffic of
ficials to take the famous seventeen-mile
drive and see the sights of Old Monterey
and its environments -.before', their de
parture Saturday morning. .
A peculiarity of the deliberations 'fcf the
committee is that practically none of its
actions is considered final until the close
of the entire meeting, and much done to
day is very liable to be undone to-morrow
Several representatives of Eastern man
ufactories adilressed the committee to
day. Messrs. Keane of Chicago and Wey
man of New York representing the Ameri
can Tobacco Company, who appeared yes J
terday in opposition . to a proposed ad
vance In the rating of smoking tobacco,
speaking again upon that question F W
Maxwell of the St. Joseph, Mo., Commer
cial Club and John Adams of the Rich
mond, Va., Tobacco Sheep Dip Company
also addressed the committee, advocating
a proposed reduction In the ratings re
spectively, of millinery and canned goods
and tobacco' sheep dip. No action upon
any of these subjects was taken during
the day.
DEL MONTE, May 9.â The -Western
Classification Committee, which began its
labors here yesterday, continued in ses
sion to-day and accomplished considera
ble. The docket shows 400 subjects to be
considered, but many of them are of such
minor importance that they are quickly
and easily settled. Most of the questions
likely to cause prolonged discussion have
been by common consent of the members
deferred to the last and will come up for
consideration to-morrow.

HENDATE, France, May 9.â Further
advices from Barcelona. Spain, show that
more persons were killed and many
wounded there yesterday. The situation,
is grave. .The garrison numbers 600 men.
Advices from Bilbao say there is great
agitation in the mining-. region.
TOBACCO MEN
OPPOSE RAISE
The Government will present to the
Cortes bills in the Interest of the working
classes; but there will be no compromise
with thfe Catalinists of separatist ten
dencies.
The ! latest dispatches to-day say that
order has been restored. Troops occupy
the suburbs of Barcelona, where the ma
jority of the factories are situated, and
work has been resumed.
,' The Cabinet has decided that all the
agitators arrested are to be tried by
court-martial. The foreign anarchists will
bo expelled from the country.
General Wevler, Minister of "War, has
telegraphed to the captain general af
Barcelona, "You will reply by' arms to
every cry of T>eath to Spain.' "
MADRID, May 9.â An enormous crowd
of people participated in yesterday's riot
ing at Barcelona. The rioters endeavored
to stop work In the factories, which ac
tion resulted in a collision with the troops.
A number of soldiers are among the
wounded. Over a hundred arrests of riot
ers, socialists and extreme Catallnists
have been made. Twenty-one notorious
anarchists, including Chiefs Bofarull and
Foneuberta, have been confined on board
the warshir> Pelayo.

Beneath Shade of Berkeley's Glassic Oaks Class of 190J Holds
: High Revel, Fair Go-Eds Participating* \
' THE SAN FRA^GISCO CALL; FRIDAY, MAT^ .10, 1901.
Auditor Wells thinks that It Is the ob
vious duty of the Civil Service. Commis
sion to order new. examinations when its
eligible lists become exhausted, but the
commission seems to think otherwise.
For that reason enly the names of Miles
Mclntosh, IX F. Maiier, Lewis Booker and
J. B. Lewis Jr. were certified to the Audi
tor for experienced clerks, though requisi
tion was made for ten. The commission
took it upon itself to certify the names
of six ordinary clerks for the remaining
six places in order to make up the Audi
tor's quota of ten. but Auditor Wells sent
his chief deputy, William Wells, to the
commission's rooms -with the notification
that he would not accept the ordinary
clerks, but would be satisfied only with
experienced ones. The work to be done
by the clerk3 is the compilation of the de
linquent tax roll.
Â¦ On the other hand. Chief Examiner Mo
ran states that the men on tha ordinary
clerks' eligible list have all heretofore
been engaged on the delinquent tax roll
and are fully competent to do the work.
Moran explains that the eligible lists are
becoming exhausted owing to the fact that
positions have been found for them more
rapidly than at first expected. Â¦> New ex
aminations have not been ordered on ac
count of the litigation in which the com
mission has been involved in relation to
the so-called county offices, but prepara
tions are being made to hold examina
tions for all positions, and after that du
plicate examinations of those already held
will be ordered In cases where the eligible
lists are exhausted.
The dilatory tactics of the Board of
Civil Service Commissioners were again
exemplified yesterday when that board no
tWed Auditor Wells that it would be un
able to supply him wltb. ten â¢ experienced
clerks, as there remained only four on
the eligible list. Though tha commission
has been in existence for sixteen months,
it has failed to hold enough examinations
to have a supply of eligible* on hand
when reciuisitlon Is made upon It for cer
tain kinds of employes. The same trou
ble was experienced by the Board of Pub
lic Works when It recently filed a requisi
tion for a male stenographer. The com
mission was obliged to confess that it had
only female eligibles on Its list, as tha
males had all been given positions.

' John . Lawrence, \ a well-known bunko
man, was arrested yesterday by Detective
Ryan and locked up in the "tanks" at the
City Prison. Ryan saw him on Larkin
street; near Sacramento, with two stran
gers and placed him under arrest. The
strangers said- that Lawrence had picked
up a key on Market street as they were
passing and asked if it belonged to them.
He then offered to ' take them to the Pre
sidio. Â¦ Lawrence is the bunko steerer who
got Student Palmer of Stanford- Univer
sity In tow about four months ago, and
after swindling him out of $160 went with
him to the Columbian Bank to cash a
draft of $5000, where he -was arrested. The
case was dismissed by Judge Cabaniss.
Bunko Man Arrested.
A special train consisting 1 of an engine,
tender and one day coach pulled into the
Oakland mole yesterday morning and
Miss Margaret Windeyer of Sydney,
Australia, Its sole passenger, swung her
self lighily to the platform. Miss
Windeyer wanted to sail for home on the
steamship Sierra, and in order to reach
this city in time was compelled to make
the run from Nevada In a special.
Miss Windeyer had been visiting friends
in Albany, N. Y. While there she re
ceived a dispatch from Sydney informing
her that her presence was essential on a
certain date in connection with the clos
ing ui> of. her father's . estate. She im
mediately started for San Francisco and
a ticket was bought for her on the steam
ship Sierra that sailed yesterday.
E. C. Williams, president of the Mendo
clno Lumber Company of this city. Is a
friend of the young lady and discovered
that the train she was traveling on would
not arrive here until 12:25 p. m. yesterday,
while the steamer-was to sail at 10 a. m.
He accordingly tried to arrange for a spe
cial .train to bring her from Ogden. Man
ager Fillmore would not permit this, but
ordered that * a train should be in readi
ness for her at Wadsworth, Nev.
The special pulled Into . Oakland, at 9:15
yesterday morning. â¢ Miss Windeyer ar
rived on this side ' of the bay. at 9:50,
where a. hack was. in. readiness for her.
E. O. McCormick had Â¦ detailed one of his
clerks to assist the young lady, and she
Â¦was driven'- along -the water, front . and
landed on the steamship's wharf at 9:57.
She was on the Sierra three minutes be
fore sailing time.

At night the graduates 'were tendered
an informal reception in the library by
Librarian , J. C. Rowell. The affair was
the perpetuation of a custom. which gives
university men and women one evening
in their lives to talk Above a whisper. In
the library building. There were no
formal reception committees, each mem
ber of the class constituting one himself.
Prophecies as to what each graduate
would be doing- and where; he would be
twenty years from now. were sealed in a
box and given into the keeping of the li
brarian. It is proposed to hold a reunion
dinner twenty years from . date and to
open the prophecies at that time.
During the evening - a short informal
talk was made by LÂ» L. Greene, president
of : the University Alumni Association.
He welcomed the class , of 1901 into the
ranks of the graduates.

BLE AT THE BERKELEY
CLASS DAY EXERCISES. â¢ .
In ten years we shall have one of the best
libraries in the world. ... I never tell Â¦ you any
thing unless it 1 ' is ' so . and my,: prediction * will
come true." I am speaking: to you from an ,
elevation and the sun prevents you from look
ing up at me.. I .cannot see ;= your -eyes. "I
wish that I could see your. eyes. I -have not
had as good an opportunity to " know, you = all
personally as I should- have desired. .',.. .:Â¦â¢ .^
My position is a very trying one and, I. am
disappointed (that â¢ I .. cannot Â¦ have ; more to do
President Wheeler said that it. was/fit
ting that the pilgrimage should terminate
at the library building, which represented
so vital a part of university life. He
dwelt on the needs of a great library for
the State University and exhorted the se
niors not to forget their alma mater, in
years to come, but to â¢ help make i the â¢ li
brary one of- the greatest in. the world.
President Wheeler, continuing, said:
The "pilgrimage" finished' in front of
the library building, where President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler addressed - the - seniors.
Richard Â¦ Walton Ttilly . delivered a short
address in behalf of the graduating class,
and when President Wheeler appeared on
the porch of the building he received an
ovation that lasted for. minutes. , . â¢ -
Students Listen . to ' President.
At the chomistry building' Glenn E. Al
len conducted the exercises, and consid
erable amusement was caused by the
"class in chemistry" â¢ conducting experi
ments on the porch -of the : structure.
Enough red and green fire was burned to
illuminate the country for miles.
The philosophy building and the mining
building were 1 then visited. At the for
mer study hall Alexander Gordenker de
livered the address, -while at the mining
building William Beaumont Schaw was
the speaker. -
The first halt was made at South Hall,
where Professor Joseph L>Â© j Conte, the
"beloved," delivered . a short address to
the joyous crowds. He drew a picture of
the cloisterlike atmosphere of the college
of his youth as compared to the free and
broad-minded college of the present day.
Professor Le Conte reviewed the work of
the students during their term of -study
and wished them God speed in. the paths
of life that lay before them. Needless to
say that Professor Le Conte was given an
ovation that made the welkin "ring with
hearty cheers. â¢ Ralph Talcott .. Fisher
made a brief address and conveyed the
thanks of the senior class to Professor
Le Conte and to the entire faculty.
North Hall was the next objective point,'
and around its steps the seniors and their
friends listened to clever speeches by
Miss Muriel Eastman and. Milton H.
Schwartz. . Both speakers .predicted, that
with the building of the Greater Univer
sity of California the world would see the
best and. grandest seat of learning in the
earth situated at Berkeley, j Schwartz
begged that the faculty, in erecting the
new buildings, would leave the old woodp
en steps of North Hall, so that in years
to come the seniors of the college might
be able to revisit the scenes of their edu
cational struggle and find the spot where
they had so often rested and imbibed in
spiration.
Professor La Conte Speaks.
The sight was a pretty one as the stu
dents listened to the various speakers at
the different halls of study. Nearly all
the co-eds were ; dressed completely In,
white, owing to the summery aay, while
the male students' wore white duck suits
and the fantastic headdress distinctive of
tiio college classes.
To the strains of martial music the
gayly dressed, throng visited the various
buildings .where, for .the past four years
the seniors have wrestled ;-w!th educa
tional problems in order to secure the cov
eted "sheepskin" awarded by the faculty
for merit onlv.- ' ..'...; -
At 10 o'clock the seniors, accompanied
by hundreds of the students, met in front
of the library. building, from which point
the "class pilgrimage" started.
More than 5000 people assembled In the
morning under the classic oaks in the vi
cinity of the library building, where -an
excellent programme of music was ren
dered by an orchestra under the direction
of Professor Wilfred Yank. At 9:30 the
senior class assembled in Stiles Hall, and,
led by the band, marched in procession to
the "senior oak," which spreads its huge
branches close to the campus bridge. ThÂ©
ceremony of dedicating the oak. was con
ducted by J. W: S. But ( ler, Paul Sins
heimer and Fred M. Allen. With appro
priate speeches Butler turned the oak
oyer to the care of Allen, who is acting
president of the class of '02. Â¦ Â¦ .â¢ 'â¢>.
THE State Univers-lty at* Berkeley
was en fete yesterday on the oc
casion of the class day exercises
held by the senior class of 190L
From early morning until late at
night the students who are bidding fare
well to college life held high revelry, and
the "pilgrimage" will be long remembered
by all who participated either as princi
pals or guests.
Â¦with the students. . Signing documents and at
tending meetings are but as dust and ashes.
The real work I love Is teaching the classes,
and my position has prevented * me from being
among you as much as I have desired. Last
year I , doubted if there would be as good a
senior class. I know of youi*work and I value
It most highly. I > have realized that I could
lean on you and secure your support at all
times and for ;that I want to thank you.
There has been, a marked gain in self-govern
ment and centralization. of power of, the stu
dent body. This -senior class has done great
work for the university. You have put the
university above class and helped Â¦ a definite
movement to push back Â¦ class and class or
ganization. >uy Â¦ - , .
. The motto of all students of this university
should be "the university above all things."
That has been your motto and I want to thank
you for your lovalty. to the university and to
myself. It shall be your credit and glory al
ways. . You have demonstrated the power of
the student body to i govern itself and from
now on the primacy of the senior 'class will be
an established fact in affairs of the university.
God bless you all and may God be with you
and help you to do your duty in life a3 men
and women. â¢Â¦
Hearty cheers greeted the close of Presi
dent Wheeler's address and -the exercises
of the morning ended, the students and
their friends dispersing for luncheon.
â¢â¢â¢..â¢ Extravaganza in Open Air.
In :the afternoon the seniors" presented
an extravaganza entitled "The Annual
Pilgrimage, to the Shrine of the Most
Learned Dragon Faculty."
The performance was given in the open
air in .what is known as "Ben Weed's Am
phitheater," a sylvan grlen surrounded by
giant oaks. The thousands of visitors
seated themselves on the sloping sides of
the glen, at one end of which was built
a large stage. ' President and Mrs. Wheel
erf escorted' Mrs. -Phebe Hearst to a seat
near the stage, and the presence of the
benefactress of the university was the sig
nal for renewed cheers "from the specta-
The extravaganza was written by Hugh
M. Love, Jewel Alexander and Herbert
T. Moore, and was filled with college skits,
so dear to student hearts.
The various classes, becomingly array
ed, prayed to the "dragon faculty", that
he might grant them diplomas. After
hearing the petitions, the dragon consents
to award the diplomas conditionallyâ on
the giving up of all "frivolities" by those
seeking the diplomas. The vanities of the
"tribes" are piled on the altar and burned
and the dragon then awards the diplomas.
A paean In praise of the diploma Is then
sung and a dance of triumph follows.
' Students Who Trod the Stage. ' .
The costuming was a feature of the per
formance and the songs, marches and
choruses were artistically^rendered. M.
H. Schwartz and R. W. Tully kept -the
fun at boiling point -as the ."Jesters and
the entire performance was keenly, . en
