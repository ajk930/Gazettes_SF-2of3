Suddenly the luff of the Constitution's

sheet Itself,, had evidently carried away.
Down came the jib halyards by a run,
while a dozen men climbed out on the
bowsprit to gather in the' slack at the foot
of the sail so as to smother the flowing
duck. For over ten minutes the Consti
tution, on that close-hauled stretch.- was

' NEW CONSTITUTION.'
J ft^ HICAGO. July Lâ Crowded together
/l^ in a little zinc-lined chanty, under
UL> a northshore pier, ten boys and
â ' young men and one old man met
instant death by lightning to-day.
They had left their flshllnes and sought
shelter from the fierce thunderstorm that
deluged the north part of the city about 1
o'clock. Ten minutes later their bodies
lay, with twisted and tangled limbs, "like
a nest of snakes," as the men who found
them said.
There were twelve who Bought shelter
and just one escaped. Twelve-year-old
Willie Anderson was uninjured, but he lay
many long minutes before he could be
drawn out from under the heav of dead
bodies. :.-V | ; V Â¦ V.?^
The dead are all I from the families of
comparatively poor people. They were
fishing and seeking relief from the heat of
the day, or had come to wade or swim.

Houses and Trees Struck.
The Kcene of the' tragedy was a pier
just south of Manjuette terrace and a few
hundred feet from the waterworks pump-
Ing station, at the foot of Montrose boule
vard. The storm was as violent a visita
tion as has ever been experienced In Chi
cago. The skies were filled with the flash-
Ing glare of the lightning and the air
rumbled . steadily with thunder. Half a
dozen houses, outbuildings and trees In the
vicinity were struck, and almost all of the
telephone wires^ burned out. There were
thirteen men and .boys on the pier at the
time. They rushed for. the only available
shelter and crowded themselves ., in
through the little trap "<Â¦ door in' the top of
the cabin till they were packed almost to
a suffocating point.
Then came the thunderbolt. It was the
worst of ; tha storm. Watchers In : the
pumping' station saw the zigzag lightning
strike the water, as they thought. â¢
There was one small boy,' however,' who

for hours, and little Willie Anderson
might have been suffocated under their
bodies. Â¦'( -I v, Â¦
Percy Keane,, clad In- bathlngr trunks^
and watching . from the water station,
thought he heard a scream -as ; the bolt
struck. Mindless of the storm he rushed
across the ; beach. At the pier he heard
a cry, "Help- get me out!"
He looked into the cabin and in dismay
saw ; the. twisted bodies. Young 'Percy,
crying, pulled at the dead men's arms and
legs to get them away. He : saw "Willie

The network of steel and iron tracks and

blistered and felt like sticky ; mud, in
which every footstep left an imprint. Â¦
- It was a record-breaking day' for. heat,
far hotter than any of Its predecessors of
last week. Never before in the thirty-one
years that the United. States Government
has kept a record here did the official
thermometer go so high. The Govern
ment observatory, . on top of one of the
highest buildings in the city, with noth
ing to obstruct; any breath of air that
stirs, sweltered in the afternoon with the
thermometer at 98 degrees. This , record'
from the. clouds does not adequately rep

Men who had hitherto scouted the no
tion of shirtwaists discarded their coats
for the nonce, and holding -their hats in
their hands to. protect their faces from the
sun crowded about the big Herald ther
mometer in Herald square to watch the
mercury. They found that it had climbed
to 111 degrees Fahrenheit a few minutes
before 4- o'clock. The minimum that it
reached during the day was 84 degrees.
Fifty-eight persons died from the effects
of the heat, and the ambulance service
proved Inadequate to remove all who were
prostrated in the streets. The.deaths re
ported,do not really represent all the lives
sacrificed by the sun, as ~i very many
deaths are attributed to other causes,
though heat is really responsible.' Of the
persons prostrated many. are beyond hope
of recovery, while others will suffer from
the effects for years. ; .
At^ o'clock this (Tuesday) morning the

Thus, over the course of over fifteen
miles to windward and back, the elapsed
time of the Columbia waa ; 2:52:04, while
that of the Constitution was 2;52:52.
Thus, on the beat to windward, the Co
lumbia defeated her opponent nearly, two
miles. Setting spinnakers, the Columbia
was a trifle smarter than the Constitution.
On the run before the wind the Constitu
tion gained. With sheets eased off, she is
faster than the Columbia.
The time at the finish was: Columbia,
2:32:38: Constitution, 2:33:29.
When the sail was In place again the
Constitution rapidly forged ahead, mak
ing up much of her leeway. It was, how
ever, too big a gap to fill. The outward
mark was now in sight, and the' Colum
bia got hold of its true bearings and made
a judicious hitch to starboard. The Con
stitution, a few seconds later, also*acked,
but what she did was a stretch too far.
The time at the outer mark was: Co
lumbia, 1:24:55; Constitution, 1:26:55.
This did not "last long, however. | Both
yachts, with big luff topsails set and small
jib topsails hunting for whatever, wind
there might- be, were making the best of
the breeze. The Constitution, footed faster
than the Columbia. But while the new
boat was going along swift as the wind
she had not the grip on the water that
the other, craft had. Along the starboard
tack the two yachts sarfed, both Jogging
at an eight-knot gait. The Constitution
would not stand as well as her rival -by
at least three degrees. When the time
came for tHe Constitution: to tack it was
a mooted question whether she could or
could not cross the Columbia's bow.
In the judgment of the sharps,
however,, there was too large a
gap to leeward to allow of this.
But just at the moment when the
Constitution's, helm was put down the
Columbia also came about and both went
teen miles dead to windward and" back
again was the course signaled by the ;
flags hoisted on the ship Colonial. . The;
starting signal sent the,. Columbia off at'
11:40:34, well to windward and three sec-,
onds in advance. â¢ The Constitution, with!
a rare burst of speed, came on with' a:
rush and ran through the Columbia's lee,
pointing for a much higher position than
was exoejeted of her. .

The event to-day was the first of a se-
accident set the Constitution back prac
tically a mile, but in spite of it she was
able to cet within two minutes of the
Columbia at the turn and cut this lead
down more than half on the run home.
Some of this gain, however, was undoubt
edly due to the fact that she came up in
the better wind. The Columbia did not
escape without accident, for Immediately
after crossing the finish line in gybing
over the big mainsail her boom buckled
and she had to be towed to the city. It
will be necessary to string a new spar be
fore the Columbia can race again, but it
is expected it will be in place for a race
Wednesday-
NEWPORT. R. I.. July 1.â The
Constitution was defeated by, the
Columbia to-day by the small
margin of 4S seconds In the first
real race in which the new Her
recheff yacht has participated. Although
the contest from start to finish was close
and at times exciting, in the opinion of a
majority of yachtsmen in Newport to
night the Constitution lost through mis
fortune. However, the result of to-day's
contest is far from conclusive and there
is still much to be decided as to the rela
tive merits of the two racers. The mis
hap to the new boat came about an hour
after the start. While the boats were on
the second long tack to the windward the
clew of the jib of the new boat was car
ried away and for some ten minutes she
was without the use of that sail. This
rles of special races arranged by. the New.
York -Yacht Club for.the purpose of bring
ing the two yachts together. The course
was cleared for the racers when the time'
approached for .the firing of the . signal
gun and the breeze came up from 1 the!
south west just 'when- it was wanted. Fif- 1

of. the Savannah, : Florida" and Western

The Populist party will go It alone nÂ«xt

did before. The main issue will be . public
ownershipâ not of everything, understand, but
of the ratural monoplles. WÂ« are not Social
ists. The Populist believes In competition.
Let the public own natural monopolies and
then for the rest let It be every man for him
self and the devil take the hindmost. All we
ask Is that there be equality of opportunity.
The silver question is dead, for the time
being at least, and for one I never favored the
use of that. word silver. All the true Populist
contends for is meney enough to transact busi
ness and maintain the equilibrium of prices.
I believe that coinage and the supply of money
should be resrulated by Jaw.
The Populist party is the progressive party
of the South. In our State It enacted the leg
islation . to encouraee manufacturing, which
broutht eo much prosperity . to that section.

as usual, did not row any distance, and
waited until everybody else had gone in.
The effect of the heat of the past few
days on the members of the different
crews was shown this afternoon, when the
men weighed in for the last time. In
many cases, especially with Cornell and
Columbia, it was found that there' had
been a loss of irem two to three pounds,
and the coaches attribute the fact solely
to the hot weather. They all assert that
it is not to be taken as an indication of
tstaleness. and none of them is in the least
worried because of it.
The average weights of the crews as

The Berlin authorities believe also, like
the other powers, that. Russia's proposi
tion is not likely to go Into effect. Hence
Germany confidently expects a final agree
ment upon the question. The matter of
the renewal and modification of commer
cial treaties with China is meanwhile be
ing taken up Jointly by the -Peking diplo
mats, since this, like the indemnity mat-,
ter, is expected to be settled in unison,. at
least in its general features. ' Germany,

that the question of guarantees securing

Russia's Proposition.
tl Russia's proposition Is to raise the sea
tolls from 5 to 10 per cent, but only If the
junk and salt taxes with 5 per cent of sea
tolls shall not yield .sufficient results.
Great Britain's objections' to Russia's
proposition are believed to be dictated less
by- practical reasons, since the foregoing
taxes would most probably suffice, than
the popular sentiment in Great Britain
and Parliament.

to return to Peking.

PBOMINENT POLITICIANS
UNDER INDICTMENT
Cripple Creek Grand Jury Finds True
Bills Against Several City
Officials.
CRIPPLE CREEK, July 1.â Several
more indictments of men prominent in
the official life of this city were returned
by the Grand Jury to-day and three ar
rests were made. Among those arrested
is Charles Wells, a prominent Republican
politician and director of the School
Board, on five counts, bribery, solicitation
of a bribe and threi charges of obtaining
money on false pretense.
Charles Northcutt, an ex-policeman,
charged with being a" beneficiary of the
Man|la House robbery some months ago,
was also arrested.
Dr. J. B. Gaston was arrested late in
the day. â¢ He is accused of having assisted
in spiriting away Joseph . Encenaur from
the County Hospital to prevent him from
testifying against a prominent lumberman
who was under arrest for shooting Ence
naur. Gaston was attending Encenaur
while the latter was lying at the hospital.
Encenaur was last heard of in Chicago.
were opposed to one another and to-day's
election showed their respective strength
with the Supervisors. Cottle was Mac
kenzie's candidate and Rea was back of
Canelo. Each controlled two votes on the
board, and the balance of power lay with
Supervisor Roll, a Democrat. Super
visors Austin and George Rea voted for
Canelo and Supervisors Knowles and
Stern for Cottle. Roll voted for Canelo.
thus making Rea the victor.
This is believed to be the beginning of
a fight between Rea and Mackenzie for
supremacy. For some time they have not
been the best of friends and Rea has de
clared recently that he intends to open
political headquarters and take a band in
city and county affairs. The capture of
the license collector, the Reaites claim,
will give them the backing of .the saloons.
Canelo took his office at once. He will
receive as compensation 5 per cent of the
amount of the licenses collected.

Â¦rf-Â«?vrrTSBURG, July Lâ The end of
I )J the first day of strike troubles be
11-=*' tween the Amalgamated Assocla
1L tion of Iron, Steel and Tin: Work
ers on one side and the; American
Sheet Steel Company and American Steel
Hoop Company, constituent companies of
the United States Steel Corporation, on
the other, finds all of the union plants Idle
and many workers from open mills, who
are members of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation, on strike. The association officials
say they are satisfied with the situation
and claim they will control between 35,000
and 40,000 men in the two companies! No
move was made to-day on the part of
either side to the controversy, and it ls
doubtful if any decisive movement will be
made for at least a week. Both men and
manufacturers agree that a shutdown for
about two weeks is necessary, whether a
settlement ls reached or not In the
meantime the association officials will
make every preparation to be fully equip
ped for a prolonged struggle should it be
come necessary.
While officials of neither side will ven
ture a prediction, much quiet talk ls be
ing done, the trend of which leads to the
belief that before the usual summer shut
down of the mills has expired a settle
ment will have been reached.
The Amalgamated officials do not con
sider the negotiations with the Steel Hoop
Company as broken, off. I. W. Jenks,
manager of the company. Is of the same
mind and to-day intimated that the mat
ter might be taken up any day. and gave
the Inference that a settlement would be
arrived at. . _ Â¦ ' Â¦
Reports received at the general offlce of
the Amalgamated Association to-nlg-ht
show that nearly all the independent mills
have signed the new wage scale.
Mills Claimed by Both Sides.
Added Interest was given to the strike
Fltuation when it became known that the
two mills which were the cause of dis
agreement between the Amalgamated As
r-ociation and the American Sheet Steel
Company are claimed by both parties-^
These mills are the old Meadows at
Scottsdale and the Saltsburg Mill. These
officials, who refused to sign the union
scale seem much surprised at the claims
of President Shaffer that the mills are
union. The sheet steel officials appeared
to have a trifle the better of the argument
to-dav, when word came foom Scottsdale
that the men now working there refused

personal asreements with us. These agree

CHICAGO. July 1.â The threatened
strike to-morrow of the 3000 woodworkers
in Chicago was averted to-night by the
manufacturers of saloon, store and office
fixtures, who acceded to the demands of
the men and signed a two-year agreement
granting an advance of- 25 cents a day in
the men's wages.
"Woodworkers' Strike Averted.
CINCINNATI, July 1.â A conference was
held here to-day between the representa
tives pf the Laidlaw-Dunn-Gordon Com
pany and the striking machinists In an
endeavor to reach a settlement of the
trouble at that plant. President August
Herrman of the Board of \ New Water
Works Commissioners was a party to the
conference as an arbitrator. A proposi
tion was submitted by the manufacturers,
and after several hours' session It was
amended that the representatives of the
strikers agree to submit It to their ex
ecutive board for approval. The nature
of the proposition was not made public.
About 350 machinists are employed at this
plant. It is expected that should the
trouble at this plant be satisfactorily set
tled other settlements will speedily follow.
Conference on Machinists' Strike.
At the office of the American Steel Hoop
Company it was stated that certain plants
of the company were closed- this week for
needed repairs and the national holiday.
The others were at work as ufeual, but
none of the officials would allow them
selves to be quoted on the present wage
complication.
President Shaffer said to-night that he
had nothing to say further than has al
ready been published. His determination
to carry the interests of the Amalgamated,
Association to a successful finish is un
abated. :
President Shaffer of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation knows that the men at Scottsdale arid
at Saltsbunr voluntarily asked the steel man
agement to grlve them a share of the work be
tng done at the other mills of the company at
the terms of the company or at any terms.
The workers also proposed an individual con
tract, which in the case of one of the mills at
Scottsdale runs for two years and at a rate
no lower than is paid in the organized mills.
The differences In the wage agreement is that
the mill committee ls | done away with and
that the wage rate does not advance until the
wage rate under the - amalgamated agreement
has advanced 10 per cent above the base. In
other words, should the price of sheets entitle
organized mills to a five per cent advance in
wages, the mills working under the individual
contract system will receive no advance.
A well-known independent sheet maker
stated to-day that Indications pointed to
a peaceful settlement of the trouble. He
said:
Peaceful Settlement Expected.
have the mills started. They would asree to
cut the amalgamated for all time if wo could
but etart the mills. They are making money
now, something which they did not do when
quarreling all the time with the association.
President Shaffer can order out his men, but
the quentlon is. can he stop the mill? -Â¦-'â¢Â¦Â¦-
The whole thins In a nutshell is that the
Amalgamated Association seems anxious to
have us force these men at. Scottsdale ana
Salisbury to come into their fold aeain. This
we will not do.

SAN BERNARDINO, July 1.â Wong
Tong, a wealthy Chinese merchant, was
shot and killed this afternoon in his store
at North Ontario, twenty miles west of
this city, by Wong Yuan, a notorious
highbinder of Los Angeles. Three shots
were- fired, the first" taking effect in the
right lung and causing almost Instant
dqath. The assassin then fired two more
shots into the prostrate body of his vic
tim, after - which â¢ he â¢ made his escape in
the direction of Pomona. â¢; Sheriff Charles
Rouse and a posse are In close . pursuit,
with every chance of effecting an early
capture. â¢/
The principals In the tragedy were mem
bers of rival tongs and a bitter . enmity
had existed between them'- for .several
years. The murderer has been in North
Ontario for several days, remaining most
of the time in l*iding.r>He was: suspected
by Wong Tong, and the latter, with his
friends, had apparently taken precau
tions, but when Wong Tuan -.walked into
the store this afternoon he took 'his vic
tim unawares. Wong Tong reached for
a revolver, but was a few seconds too late.
Wong Tong had been - a resident' of
North Ontario fpr fifteen : years and â¢Â¦ was
liked by everybody. His 5-year-old son
narrowly escaped receiving ,â¢Â¦ a death
wound, as one of the' bullets, passed
through bis blouse.
HIGHBINDER'S BULLET
KILLS A HIGH CHINESE
WITH a very good production of
"The Only Way," the Fraw
ley Company last night open
ed its Â¦ season at the Grand
Opera-house. A large crowd
greeted the popular organization, and the
many favorites in the cast were warmly
welcomed.
E. J. Morgan, who appears as leading
man; Theodore Roberts. J. R. Amory,
Wallace Shaw, Katherine Grey and Phosa
McAllister were all included in the cast
and received individual greetings.
' Ernest Defarge In the original produc-,
tion, E. J. Morgan now assumes the lead-
Ing role of Sidney Carton, the part made
so famous by Henry Miller last year, and
the criticism of the performance last even
ing inevitably consisted chiefly of com
parisons between Mr. Morgan's and Mr.
Miller's work in spite of aphorisms to the
contrary. And there is no doubt that Mr.
Morgan does good work, in places excel
lent work, though his conception is in
quite another key from that of Henry
Mlller_and in a key perhaps less high and
pleasing. Miller's Carton was a devil
may-care, clever fellow, Intermittently
cynical, good-tempered always, and with
a careless nobility that sat easily on a
pair of shrugging shoulders. A light touch
he had through it all, and this is where
the chief difference between the two In
terpreters comes In.
Morgan is overstrenuous in his methods,
overearnest, a little, heavy-handed. < His
Carton Is the cynic throughout, lacking
almost entirely in the quaint loveableness
that characterized Miller's, conception of
the careless martyr, and in the trial scene,
â¢where before the tribunal Carton
wheedles the impressionable mob into
clemency for his enemy. Morgan's hail
fellow well met with the bloodthirsty
bourgeoisie comes but stiffly. All through
elasticity, bonhomie, lightness, are. want
ing in the conception, bufeven without
these Mr. Morgan's performance, aided
as it is by his handsome face and figure,
should be a very pleasing one. . His first
scene is really admirable, even side by
side with that of Miller,- and there is dis
tinct hope for the part's future reach in
Mr. Morgan's hands. --' ii!/i .
Theodore Roberts, as Jean Defarge,
filled a good place in the cast, 'Wallace
Shaw essayed successfully the part of
Mr. Stryver, and J. R. Amory was a
quaint and delightful old busybody as
Mr. Lorry. Qharles Darnay was done by
John Mason, an actor new to ub here, and
was played with sympathy and warmth.
H. S. Duffleld played a good Dr. Manette.

There will be a special matinee of "Un

Annie Myers and Edward Webb as "the
Babes" are as funny as -the roles require
and receive many a well won encore. Ber
nice Holmes, the Lady Macasser, plays
the part with ease and tact and does not
overdo. "The Babes" has caught on. -
of course, has to do the most of the work
and does it well in his usual way. One
can t -have too much of Ferris and his
rare topical gaga. His reading of rThe
Clown s Baby" was the most artistic bit
of work in - the performance. As r>r
Deadatone Arthur Cunningham hasn't
much to do, except to. make love to Maud
WilnamB, the pretty, schoolina'am of the
operetta, and he does* it easily and with
apparent earnestness.- Maud is a grace
ful actress and sweet singer and the role
could not have been intrusted to better
handa. - Alf Wheelan in the subordinate
character of Sir Rowland Macasser is too
far in the background to display his rare
talents, but the love scene with the
schoolma'am was one of the funniest
things in the performance.

Orpheum.
Patrons of vaudeville are not likely to
be wearied If they are able ' to witness
such offerings as were presented at the
Orpheum last evening. San Francisco is
far from New York City, and when It is
realized that in the city on the Pacific
Coast one is able to witness for popular
prices exactly *, the same entertainment
presented in the metropolis of the Atlan
tic side of the country for three times the
amount of admisslorf due credit must be
rendered to the management of the Or
pheum circuit.
The bill presented last night was one
replete with novelties. P. Richards is one
of the cleverest cartoonists ever seen In
this city, while the La Moyne Brothers
give an exhibition on the horizontal bars
that is well worth seeing. Ina Allen, a
daughter of California, made her first ap
pearance on the vaudeville stage, and her
powerful mezzo-soprano voice instantly
won, the kind recognition of the audience.
Clayton, White and Marie Stuart present
ed a sketch entitled "Dickey," and the
merry conceit kept the large audience in
raptures of laughter for a long time. â¢. '
Bimm, Bomm and Brrr, whose real
names are unknown, are a trio of the
mostoinimitable musical clowns ever seen
on the Orpheum stage. The acme of ac
robatic work is "presented by the Prosper
troupe, and a second visit to see their
marvelous gyrations will not be regret
ted. Frank Gardner and LiOttle Vincent
begin a second week, presenting a musical
farce, "A Shattered Idol," and help to
keep the fun at sizzling point. -
Emily Lytton, Charles Bowser and com
pany present "A Wise Guy," and this far
cical sketch is one of the cleverest offer
ings ever seen at the home of vaudeville.
The new scenes of marvelous Interest
presented by the biograph make the audi
ence realize that the days of wonders- are
but commencing, so" true are the pictures
presented on the screen. . ,

There was a crowded house and an ap
preciative one at the Central last night
to see James M. Brophy begin his season
of six weeks in "Davy Crockett." The
popularity of the star was attested by an
enthusiastic curtain call at the end of the
fourth act, and the presentation of nu
merous elaborate flower pieces. In re

returned thanks for the kindness that hart

SAN RAFAELT.July 1.â "W. H. Cook,"
attorney for the State Board of Fish Com
missioners, swore out a warrant to-day
before Recorder Murray, charging
Charles Linget with having made threats
against his life. To-day's trouble is the
outgrowth of the arrest of George Agnew
and LJnget several months ago for having
sturgeon lines in their possession. Attor
ney Cock prosecuted the cases on behalf
of the commission. At the Â¦ preliminary
hearing both men were held over to the
Superior Court. Lingex's trial came on
first. As he had no attorney and was
without means Judge Angellottl appoint
ed Thomas P. Boyd to defend him. At
the trial last week the jury'disagreed.
Â¦ The LInget case came up to-day to be
set for another trial. Attorney - Cook
wanted to try the Agnews case first, but
Boyd insisted that as LInget was in jail
he should â¢ be tried first. A compromise
was effected by the prosecution agreeing
to allow LAnget to go on his own recogni
zance. No sooner was he released, how
ever, than Attorney Cook appeared before
Recorder Murray and obtained a warrant
for Llnget's arrest, alleging that he had
some months ago made threats . to kill
him. Constable Treanor went before Jus
tice of the Peace Rodden and obtained
another warrant for LJnget's arrest for
having committed a battery upon him at
the time of the first arrest.
"When Attorney Boyd heard this he pp
peared before Judge Rodden and de
nounced the affair as sharp practice, and
the turning of a prosecution into a perse
cution. Boyd said that the complaints
sworn to by Treanor and Cook .'were not
made in good 1 faith. After making the air
extremely torrid for a while, Boyd pro
duced $150 cash ball and his client was
released. Linget is a poverty-stricken
fisherman who ekes out an existence on
Marin Island.

SEATTLE, July 1.â The steamship
Victorian, Captain John Roberts,
arrived in port this morning from
Skaguay with seventy-five Daw
â¢ sonites and between $800,000 and
$1,000,000 in golden treasure, part of the
spring clean-up In the Klondike district.
The Victorian left Skaguay on the night
of June 27 and brought advices up to that
date. Of the gold. $510,000 was consigned
to the Canadian Bank of Commerce,
$20,000 direct to the United States Assay
Office here, and the remainder was divid
ed among the passengers. H. I. Miller,
the cattleman of Seattle, brought out a
good sized "poke," the result of business
operations In the Yukon metropolis dur
ing the spring. He Is reported to have
brought $100,000. Many of the passengers,
as is usually the -case, undoubtedly pos
, sessed sacks of gold, but kept silent as to
the treasure. They did not care to b*>
quoted as Â¦ having any sum out of the
ordinary.
The large consignments of gold were
contained in small steel boxes. The ship
ment, to the Canadian Bank of Commerce
consisted of seven boxes. The $20,000 con
signed to the Assay Office was contained
in one box. Nearly all of the passengers
kept their gold In their staterooms In
sacks and small boxes. Some small ship
ments were sent out by the Alaska and
.Pacific ExpresB Company In care of Pur
ser Parmelee. G. H. Barnes conveyed
the; gold shipped by the Canadian Bank
of \ Commerce. He accompanied the
treasure all the way from Dawson.
"Tagish" Charley, a well known Indian
character in Alaska, came out on the
Victorian. He\is said to have a good
anftount of treasure, taken from his Klon
dike claims.
The most of the Dawson passengers on
the Victorian/ came up the Yukon River
on the river steamers Selkirk and Daw-
COOK FEARS THE IRE
OF LOWLY FISHERMAN
They know that the latest official British
Columbia man, which embraces Skagruay and
the country for fifty miles around, has been
tent to every Canadian official in the country,
and they know further that these fellows have
been instructed to crowd on to every inch of
American territory that they can bold. -
Sycophantic and weak-llvered newspapers
and pewter-hearted Americans who would sell
their souls to get rid of a shelf-full of oid
goods cannot fool libertv-loving citizens.
The people of Skaguay have sworn that they
will never allow Canada to steal another inch
of Uncle Sam' 3 domain. â¢
There is little doubt about Mr. Hawkins be
ing influenced to take the action he did in
swearing out a complaint against loyal Miner
by the Canadian officials. And it is believed
the gentleman left here suddenly because ha
did not want to appear against him.
Canadian organs in thia city can say what
they please in defense of the Canadian gov
ernment and the British flagr. but it will not txÂ»
swallowed by American citizens of Skaffuay.
They know exactly what Is being 1 done. They
are fully aware that the Canadians are trying
to steal Ekagiuiy. The attempt to Boat the
alleged customs flag was only a part of the
scheme.
SEATTLE, July 1.â The Alaska Trav

AT a meeting of the Golden date
Park Driving Association, to be
held to-night in the Palace Hotel,
oreparations for the biff meeting
to be held at the Oakland race
track on July 4 will be completed. All the
entries are in and have been classified. A
few minor matters are to be disposed of.
There will be no cup races, but a num
ber of special races between individual
members will be trotted and special prizes
will be awarded in each event. The spe
cial team race between E. A. Aigeltinger,
Charles Newman and H. H. Jacoos has
been declared off. At the last meeting,
which was Meld on Decoration Day at
Tanforan track, this event was a feature
of the day. Aigeltinger had the race well
in hand', but stopped in the stretch, and
Jacobs passed under -the wire a victor.
The judges, however, awarded the race
to Aigeltinger, as Jacobs' team ran around
the track. Newman's team became un
manageable owing to a broken strap, and
dashed three times around the track be
fore the horses could be brought to a
standstill. This provided excitement for
every one present. It was the Intention to
bring the team race off at the coming
meeting, but owing to the condition of one
of Newman's animals and other setbacks
it was decided to postpone the event.
Despite this fact great interest will be
manifested in the races. There will be
four races and two special events. H. H.
Dunlap's handsome King Cadenza and L.
Richardson's Edna R will contest 'for su
premacy, as will also George Gray's Irwin

every clam who dares to try to use us as street
sweepers; linen dusters will be furnished to
all coverless clams. We will have you to un
derstand' we are the Poison - Oaks and you
can't touch us, . Runs of twenty are nothing
in comparison to our scoreâ when you come in
contact with us it will swell with every in
ning. Doctors and hospitals will do you no
good. Make your peace with this earth and
purr up to the undertakers and Coroner, other
wise you may find yourselves relegated to ths
chowder fiends of the cocktail route.
Remember time and tide wait for no man
and the following have pledged to cover them
selves with glory and the clams with mud.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and Beal this 2d day of July. 1901.
J. C. WILSON, Chief Oak.
Witnesses: Frank L. Owen, pitcher of high

To simplify matters we have decided to count
our runs only in lots of twent*. Our aggre
gation will consist of the following well-known
parlor athletes and balcony posers:
Our understanding Is that there Is to ba no
hitting in the clinches and it is to be hoped
you will take your defeat cheerfully and con
duct yourselves with due decorum when our
score is finally footed up.
Be it further known and ' duly noted, That

Club â Greeting:: And be it known that the
Mill Valley City Fathers* have expressed a
wish to have the entire valley swept, dusted
and' thoroughly renovated to a state of im
maculate perfection ;. so . . -.
The Gauntlet Thrown.
The challenge reads thus:
The Poison Oaks." are J an "aggregation
of stars" that scintillate for the benefit of
Blithedale butterflies. They have grown
strong climbing Mount Tamalpais per
scenic railway. .. ... ' â¢
The game to be played Sunday is not for
the benefit of anything or anybody. There
will be no charge at the gateâ It would
be too much' trouble to take the money.
It Is not even for love of the national
game that these Bohemians are eroing to
mow down. giant redwood3 with volleys
of home-run hits, lo; , v
only a speaking acquaintance with the
sport. â¢ It is rivalryâ fierce, 1000-watt rival
ry. Once the boys at Belvedere were the
only pebbles on the Marln beach. That
was before the chorus girls began to re
fuse Invitations to the arka. Now the
dances up -Blithedale way, moonlight
drives to Tamalpais and such delights
hav<j won the favor of the girls, and the
sallormen of the arks' seek satisfaction.
They are the â¢ challengers,' and . they are
practicing the game in the cove every
ebb-tide.
The Little Neck Clams and the Poison
Oaks will play a match game of baseball
at Mill. Valley next. Sunday afternoon
The fame of these two redoubtable nines
has extended from . the clam-chowder
cafes of Water street In Sausalito to the
dairy ranches of Tomales^ and ere the sun
has set next Sunday Matin County will
not be half large enough for a pedestal
to their monument of glory.

SHOOTING PARK
Artists and Gardeners
at Work at Shell
Mound.
Team of Swiss Sharpshooters
Is to Compete for
Prizes.
Shell Mound Park will be transformed
into a veritable paradise In honor of the
third national shooting festival of the
National Shooting Bund of the United
States, which will be held during the
week of July 14 to the 23d. Plans for this
transformation have been approved and
artiste, designers, architects and land
scape gardeners are at work with a view
toward making the park the most at
tractive spot in California. The entrance
to the main festival place, the Temple of
Gifts ana the semi-circle facing the head
quarters of all the States in the Union
are to be made irresistibly enchanting.
The Temple of Gifts will be an octago
nal structure, with glass panels set In
rolden rods. Within will be displayed the
rich prizes in gold and silver which have
been contributed by the citizens of this
city and vicinity. As these trophies are
valued at a sum in the neighborhood of
175,090 a guard of riflemen and policemen
will.be stationed around the building day
and night.
It has just come to light that the
famous team of Swiss sharpshooters that
won first prize in the international con
test during the World's Exposition at
Paris is cominsr to California to compete
for prizes in the tournament. The team
consists of the following named sharp
shooters: Richardet, La Chaux-de-Fonds;
I Staeheli. St. Gallen; Boecklin, Glarus;
. Kellenberger, Waizenhausen; and Guether
of Basle.
The competition between the cities of
the United States for the fourth National
JBundesfest promises to be keener than
j the rivalry for the prizes by the shooters.
. Milwaukee Is making a hard and strong
campaign to bring the Bundesfest of 1904
â¢ to that city. Its delegates will come to
.: the festival Instructed to use every en
tdeavor to secure the next national shoot-
Ing festival for that place. The Citizens'
Business League of Milwaukee is backing
the movement and has written to the local
representatives to help Milwaukee. W. W.
Yeager, secretary of the Pueblo Rifle
Club, Pueblo, Colo., arrived in town a
few days ago and is testing the feeling
of California riflemen concerning 1 the next
festival. He Is instructed to work for
Pueblo first, ana for any other town in
Colorado next. Colorado will be numer
ously represented and will have a good
chance to get the next festival. Califor
nians will not object to having the fourth
festival held on the Pacific Coast, but will
probably refrain from making an active
campaign, preferring to let the visitors
show their appreciation of California hos
pitality by voting for San Francisco as
the next festival city.
Shell Mound Park will be closed to the
marksmen on July 4, as the Scottish This
-tle Club will hold its annual picnic on that
day. The shooting experts are at the park
day practicing for the tournament,
which promises to be the greatest ever
held In the West.

When tha Doric sailed Chief Engineer
Keller was having considerable trouble in
getting certain repairs made, owing to the

count her passengers and cargo would be
transferred to the Sierra, and that would
detain the Australian mail boat. Then in

William at once came to "Frisco," but
there was no wife to meet him. As she
took $40 that "was in the house along with
her. Captain Dunleavy is of the opinion
that Mrs. Clyde sent her husband here on
a wild goose chase, while she moved away
ln another direction. Clyde thinks his
wife has gone to her home ln Los An
geles and is going there to look for her.
He will not believe that there is another
man in the case, but can give no reason
why his wife should leave home and send
him on a wild goose chase. . -
"Oh, I'm nearly crazy. Come to Frisco
as soon as you get your money. By-by.
Don't fail to come, dear."

mechanic. Is looking for his missing wife.
Yesterday, for some reason best known

A. J. West was ready to follow me. She
was from Manila for Grays Harbor, but
had to put into Yokohama In distress.
She vras leaking badly, but was put in

me he was going to make a record run to
the coast or know the reason why. If he
got the weather the William Law encoun
tered he must have had a lively time."
hold caught hold of his shipmate around
the -waist. Flynn yelled, "idold on tight,
Quigley," but before the latter could
brace himself the strain came and both
-were hurled to the deck. Quigley was
thrown against the braces and landed on
the deck ln a sitting position. He es
caped -with a sprained ankle and -was able
to bobble to the forecastle. Flynn fell on
his head and lived only a few minutes.
The deceased was a native of Ireland,
aged 50 years.
In talking about the Law's run yester
day. Captain Hurlbert said: "We had
most remarkable weather on the run
over. During the thirty days we were
under canvas we had five storms and
nearly all the time we were under lower
topsails. The first gale blew from, the
northeast and we made good progress be
fore it Then we had three heavy blows
in succession from the westward, and
finally' last Friday it blew a living gale
from the northeast, shifting to the north
and then northwest. The barometer fell
from 30.30 to 29.70 and I prepared for
heavy weather. Sunday at noon we were
snugged down to fore and main lower top
sails and that was about all -we could
stagger along under. I secured a good
observation and figured that I was 100
miles from the lightship. I looked over
the side, however, and came to the con
clusion that we -were In soundings. I got
another observation and still according to
it -we were nearly 100 miles from our.des
tination. Then I saw land birds and re
marked to the mate that the shore was
not far off and that the chronometer must
be -wrong. I ordered the mizzen lower
topsail set and was preparing to stajid
off -when we sighted the Faxallones. As
soon as I could get ashore I had my chro
nometer tested and found it to be nearly
100 miles out. How it can have gone so
radically wrong In thirty days is a mys
tery, as It was right to a mile before I
left Yokohama.

the Act by the Last Congress.
When Collector Welburn's administra
tion ended the office was given a rank by
the department of ZM, the lowest in the
scale. During the fiscal year just ended
ti}Â© office has been examined twice by
United States revenue agents from Wash
ington, and in each case received the rank
of No. L The accounts of the office are
now in such shaoe that the trial balance
lor the fiscal year and for the four years
of the term of Collector Lynch was pre
pared and an abstract mailed to Washing
ion on July 1, the first time that this has
been done in the history of the office. The
total collections for the term of office
have amounted to $13,167,836 t>6, and the
deposits as certified by the United States
Depositary are exactly the same amount.
The First District of California is pe
culiar in several features. It is but one
of the sixty-four revenue districts in the
United States, but in the district is pro
duced half cf the brandy made in the
United States and two-thirds of the sweet
v.-ine is fortified here. Then nearly half
of the Chinese registered in the United
States have their certificates on flle in San
Francisco. The supervision of the mak
ing of sweet wine, the brandy used in
it, and the registration of the Chinese
is undertaken by the United States Rev
enue Service without expense to the tax
payer, acd it does not result ln the col
lection of any revenue. From all data the
aniourt of work to be done has increased
in the past four years over 50 per cent,
while the expense of doing the work has
increased but 6 per cent.
The total amount collected yesterday
was $59,059 48: the sum collected July r.
lauO, was $30,965 05. ' "^

Lynch. A comparison of the fiscal year

Sunday's Ceremonies an Inno

'Circles.
â¢The retirement of General Shaf ter was
the sole topic of discussion ; among mili
tary officials- yesterday. The ceremonies
attending , the transfer* of a department
command ln the post have usually., been
without ostentation, and in consequence
the assumption of \ command ' by General
Young Sunday, attended as it was by. a
display of good | feeling and camaraderie
caused considerable discussion. '.'...
Â¦ Since the establishment , of the^Departi
ment of California it has been the custom
to transfer the command with bare polite
ness and form. The ceremony of Sunday
was therefore an innovation., - â¢
The affairs of the department ran along
as usual yesterday. General Young. came
to the office early in the day and was kept"
busy signing the official' documents which
the : coming of a new department com
mander renders necessary. Out at the Pre
sidio everything^ was surroiuided by an
air of peace. There are but three volun?
teer regiments remaining on the resver
vation awaiting muster out, and prep
arations â¢ for > their retirement- from the
service on the 2d, 3d and 5th of July are
well. under way. 'According to the pres
ent schedule the Forty-seventh Infantry,
will be. mustered out to-day, , the Forty
flrst.Wednesday and the Forty-third Fri
day. . The mustering, out of these- three
regiments will close the career of ..the vol
unteer army of the Spanish and the Fili

known in the hospital corps. .-._-Â¦Â¦:
Â¦ The railroad clerka who- have been sta-'

Hays. Huntington has taken offices in
the Wells^Fargo building on Second street,
so. that he can be in closer communication
with the officers of "the Market-street
Railway Company. His moving out cf
the railroad building indicates that he is
no longer to be connected with the South

It is announced that the crown colony, Jamaica, is
asking that several thousand of these honorable and
hardy men be sent there. For what purpose?. Is it
to put them at labor as servile persons? The climate
of Jamaica is deadly to these men from the veldt* in
the temperate zone. The very proposition is sinister
and disquieting, 'and ' the . act itself will ' become', in
famous in history if it be carried out. The world: is
"getting sensitive over the^ South African war any
way. The burning of General Dewet's farmstead and
driving* his wife and children forth like hunted, beasts
is not an act of war but of. wantonness/ savoring !of
IS it assumed that England has the right under the
laws of war to deport, exile or .permanently re
strain Boer soldiers taken in .warfare?' If this is
assumed, we think the authority for, it under any ar
ticles of war, or public law, should be made plain.

By way of putting a stop to lynching- the Alabama
constitutional convention has accepted a provision by
which any Sheriff who gives up a prisoner to a mob
is to be suspended from office and subject to im
peachment That is another evidence that the best
men in the South as well as elsewhere are opposed
to lynching and arc doing what they can to prevent it
k The resolve of the Democrats of Kansas not to fuse
with the Populists in another campaign may be takejt*
as sure proof that Democracy in that State has come
to the conclusion there are not enough Populist
voters left to make it worth while to give them "any
nominees on the party ticket.
- Mr. Vanderlip, formerly an assistant Secretary of
the Treasury, who has just returned from Europe, is
quoted as saying: "I think it not only possible but
highly probable that Europe will agree to binding
terms of trade combination against us within the next
few years, and that the result will be the most gigantic
and stubborn commercial war in the history oi the
world." The prospect is not a pleasant one to face,
but if the struggle come we can stand it better than
Europe. ' .^ >T-.
Apropos of Rear Admiral Sampsqn's
letter, opposing the promotion of enlisted
men to commissioned offices on the score
of their lack of "social qualifications,"
the Boston ; Globe relates an interesting
incident." Soon after the close of the war
"a dinner was given in honor of .AdmTfat-
Sampson' by a Cambridge gentleman dis>
tinguished In the woild of letters. One of
the guests when Introduced to the admiral
remarked:- 'I had the honor-of .serving
under you before Santiago, sir.' Admiral
Sampson looked puzzled for a moment
and'then remarked: "I-thought I knew all
the officers in the fleet; may I ask on
! what ship you were?' 'I was a seaman on
the Prairie, sir,' was the reply." The ex
seaman guest was a college professor !â

.Burning, at the stake began in Texas, and had oc
curred in nearly every Southern ' State before it ap
peared in Colorado and Kansas* Lynching, by v rope
and shooting,. has. prevailed on the frontier and
throughout the West, arid no one who is regardful
of the;good name of the country excuses it. We
have deprecated it in California and in. Georgia. .That
the crime grows on what it feeds upon is shown by
the progressive cruelty of .the .processes em
ployed. Where hanging once , served, burning
is now used. We expect that this will soon
give place to the more savage plan of drawing the
Â¦victim asunder "by horses hitched to his arms and
legs. Our hot-blooded critic has no word of rebuke
or deprecation of these outbreaks of barbarous fury
in the section Avhich he defends against what he thinks
to be our' partisan prejudice. We make no rejoinder
because we have any respect for his opinion, as the
opinions of men who hide their names behind an
alias arejnot respectable, but only to say. once for all
that lynching is a crime and that burning to death is
barbarous, whether it occur North or Southi
The only reason why one may say that-there is
more barbarism in the South is because more ne
groes are roasted, there. Burning at tHe' stake is /a
peculiarly barbarous proceeding. If people will' hot
let the law as it is take its course', nor amend it to
make the punishment fit the crime, there are less bar
barous ways to kill men accused of crime.
We have always believed that such a- crime is evi
dence of barbarism wherever perpetrated, in Kansas,
Colorado or South Carolina.
U A SOUTHERNER" writes to ' the Placer
/\ County Representative something about the

"spleen" of The Call, in resentment of an allusion to
the burning to death of negroes in the South as [evi

It is with those questions the Republicans of Ohio
challenge their antagonists. :It is to be seen whether
the Democrats will answer or evade them... It is an
off-year :n politics, and even this contest in Ohio is
not likely to be exciting, but as it is to be fought upon
national issues it may serve to show to what extent
the conservative forces of the people remain. united in
support of the administration, and how far the virtual
retirement of Bryan will be followed by a return of the
Gold Democrats to their former standards.
Referring to the opposition, the Senator said:
"What has the Democratic party done that entitles it
to a new hearing in the people's court? Has it turned
a new leaf? Has it abjured free trade? Has it fore
saken free silver? Has it cast out Populism? Has it
followed Aguinaldo's advice and taken the oath of
allegiance? Has it denied any article of its platform?
Not _one. Its official declaration of principles re
mains identically the same bundle of" un-American
fallacies that the people condemned last year and years
before. If it has done nothing, what, then, does it
propose to do? Can any man tell? Does a|ny Demo
crat know?"
Senator Foraker pointed out to the convention that
the country has been placed upon a sound industrial
basis by a protective tariff, and upon a sound
financial basis by the adoption of the policy
of sound money. Prosperity has resulted, and
we now hold that foremost place among the
nations. It cannot be denied by any one that these
things have been accomplished by the Republican
party, nor that the party will maintain the policies
which have brought confidence and opportunities for
labor and capital alike.
OHIO is to afford the people of the country an
opportunity for learning how her voters stand
on national questions. It seems there is to be but
little in the way. of local issues during the State cam
paign which was virtually opened by the recent Re
publican convention. The speeches made by the lead
ers dealt almost exclusively with national affairs, and
it is evident the party intends to ask of the people a
vote of confidence in the Republican administration.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Let each one, then, exercise more than ordinary care
during' the days that will be majked by the general
'explosion of firecrackers. In addition to watching
their own property parents should see to it that their
children do not endanger the property of others.
k With proper care we can pass the celebration without
any fire losses, but if we are careless we may have to
pay dearly for it
We have an excellent Fire Department, and the
officers of the city may be expected to be vigilant and
careful throughout the celebration, but all should not
be left to them. Every property-owner and house
bolder should exercise supervision over his own prem
ises with more care than usual. If that be done the
danger will be slight, for such fires as might be
started by a match or by the burning paper of an ex
ploded cracker could be easily extinguished if seen in
time. Hardly anything more -is needed than watch
fulness, and that should be increased in proportion as
the danger is increased. â¢ * V
Every Fourth of July is marked by a notable list of
fires in various parts of the country. They constitute
t very considerable part of the news of the following
day. In every one of those fires there was the pos
sibility of> some conflagration like that which swept
the business center of Portland, or that which but re
cently well nigh destroyed Jacksonville. The fact that
San Francisco has never been exposed to such a con
flagration is no assurance that the exposure may not
occur at any time.
T-^ ROM now until after the last blaze of celebration
|H of the Glorious Fourth has died away it be
-*Â¦ ' hooves all citizens to be more than usually care
" ful against danger from fire. San Francisco has never
raftered a disastrous conflagration such as has be
fallen so many other American cities, and it is to be
hoped she never will; but none the less there is al
ways a menace of some calamity at every return of the
national holiday with its license to all classes of peo
ple, young or old, to make well nigh unrestrained use
of fireworks of all kinds from a firecracker up.

Constitution is put together with little less cunning than an
egg. If an egg is held accurately end to end a strong man may
strive in vain to break it. The principle of the Herreshoff
boat Is the same in construction. The hull is a self-sustaining
whole, so fragile that one might pierce it -with a walking stick
by a wisely applied blow, yet so strong in its entirety that ton3
of waves may assault it and avail nothing.
Engineering skill is perhaps in no wise better exemplified
than in the building of Constitution. It may be accurately
stated that she is as strong as steel, for the secret of her al
most incomprehensible strength lies in the fact that she is
constructed of steel. ' Most Important, however, is the fact
that lightness, making possible the greatest buoyancy, has
been the aim. of her designer arid builder.
To attain -this every ounce of unnecessary weight has been
eliminated. Frames, joints, plates, braces, : belts, in fact every
component In the body of Constitution has been wrought of
materials which singly would be highly destructible, but when
joined according 'to the cunning of the builder's craft combine
a structure which is a bulwark of strength. '
. As an illustration of the unity of strength of the yacht,
her builders say that an ounce of pressure on her sails is felt
in every part of the yacht^and every part bears its "burden
of the strain. Thus, in a heavy gale, when her sails are taut as
boards and an enormous amount of force must be resisted, the
gallant little craft In her thousand and. one parts fights all for
one and one for all.
Constitution's frame is â¢ an - Innovation " In yacht building.
The thickness of each frame is about 6-40 .of an inch* The fram

GREAT -STBENGTH OP THE HULL
CONSTITUTION, the America's cup defender, is an egg
shell boat, says the New York .World. In comparison
with an egg: -her shell is equally thin, but this shell Is
so constructed that it can withstand tons of "pressure,
y. blows of many horsepower, a, strain on her sail area
which a landsman might well think would crush her instantly,
j The thickness of Constitution's hull Is little more than a
fifth of an Inch. Her frames ' are the strongest part of her
make-up. Yet each frame is less than a fifth of an inch thick.
Constitution is ten times stronger than a section of the ele
vated railroad structure. She. is able to bear the. same burden
on a frame which, is but one-tenth the weight of the "L" con
struction. Ten trains could pass on a structure no heavier
than is Constitution's hull, yet with the same security that
they rumble over the thick iron pillars of the "L."

The plates which cover Constitution's framework are of
bronze to- just above the water line, where composition steel
plating extends to the decks. The thickness of these bronze
plates is from six to eight thirty-seconds of an inch.
Constitution is built with, ability to encounter wtthont In
jury furious blows which are given a boat in a heavy seaway.
Strain may be removed for an instant from the yacht's hull,
to be followed a moment later by the crushing Impact of a
roller. The Herreshoff yacht rides the waves in absolute Indif
ference to these dangers. Her steel hull la depended on to re
tain its model unchanged by so much as a fractional inch by
the buffeting of the waves.
Could an onlooker have viewed, Constitution before her
plates were riveted on he would have seen the model of the
boat outlined In a mass of steel frames and braces. He -would
also have noticed that narrow bands of steel run lengthwise
of the yacht, reinforcing the belt framing. From the deck
frames to the frames below the water line braces are riveted.
One of Constitution's frames looks not unlike a bridge girder.
Their greater lightness, however, ends the comparison.
SECRET OP FRAME'S GREAT RESISTANCE.
The secret of their great resistance lies in the manner of
placing and bracing.
The matter of keel Is one -which gave the builders much
concern. It is an axiom of ship builders that the more lead a
boat can carry with a given water line the more sail she can
carry. Constitution approaches as near the attainable in this
respect as any yacht ever constructed. Lead plates of a total
weight of nearly 100 tons are attached to Constitution's keel.
This lead. represents about three-fourths of the total weight
of the yacht Every pound that could be taken from sails,
rigging, blocks, | etc, has been placed in the keel, producing 1
the lightest attainable shelL So it is finally thfti shell, which
has been lightened In every possible manner, which must bear
the strain of many horsepower of wind.
To landsmen it Is not generally known that Constitution,
In common with other yachts of her general construction. Is
non-capsizable. The center of - gravity made possible by the
tons of lead In her keel Is in such relation to thÂ» center of
effort cf her sails that it .would be impossible for Constitution
to "turn turtle." >
DEFENDER "WILL NOT "TTJBN TURTLE."
longitudinally alone, as in the construction of Independence.
This serves to take up a large part of the longitudinal strains,
-which formerly fell to considerable degree upon the plating,
and so the weight of the plating Is materially lessened.
FRAGILE SKIN OF STEEL OF CUP DEFENDER IS SO DELICATE THAT A PISTOL BALL WOULD PIERCE IT,
YET IT: IS SO INGENIOUSLY BRACED THAT IT WILL WITHSTAND A PRESSURB REPRESENTED IN THE

Taking the reports from Jerusalem in connection
with those of the convention at Philadelphia, it will
be seen there are good reasons for the hopes of those
ardent Zionists who are striving to once more estab
lish in Palestine an independent Jewish state.
. The country back <5f Jerusalem is no^ longer the
desolation it was for many a century. The Post cor
respondent in writing of it says': "One commission
house .has bought a $350 windmill â¢ from an Illinois
firm and will erect it on the Bakaa plain. This firm
is confident there is to be an. important market for
windmills in Palestine and Syria, and for irrigation
machinery of all sorts. Rich foreigners are figuring
to secure control of some of- the once fertile valleys of
the country, and should they succeed there will be an
attempt to make them again a land flowing with milk
Of course, anything like a wholesale emigration of
Jews to Palestine is not to be expected. Among the
nations of Western Europe and in America the Jews
have long since become established as a part of the'
population, having the same rights and the same
duties of citizenship, and comparatively few of such
well established families will leave .their homes. A
large migration back to the old land may be expected,
however, from among young Jews looking for a place
to settle and from among emigrants from Russia and
Southeastern Europe. â¢;
When the various railways, projected through Asia
Minor eastward toward India have been completed
and connected with, the Russian lines in Central" Asia
there will be no physical reason why Palestine might
not recover its -old 'position of. vantage as a central
point on the great j route for trade between Asia and
the countries bordering on Mediterranean. Even
at the present time there is a good deal of trade activ
ity in and around Jerusalem. A correspondent of the
New York. Post, who is now traveling in that country,
says: "An American salesman recently went to Jeru
salem and Beirut and in one day sold merchandise of
an up-tQ-date type to the amount of $3800. * Commis
sion houses for the handling of American goods have
been opened. in every city and town of importance in
Palestine and Syria, and in many instances are con
ducted by wide-awake American business men." He
goes on to say that in Jerusalem there are electric
lights, telephones, phonographs^; sanitary plumbing,
modern stores and most of the comforts of civilized
The reoccupatiori of Palestine has been a dream
among certain types of the Jewish face for a long time.
In the past it has been a dream only, for the conditions
of Palestine in relation to the rest of the world: were
not of a nature to attract any Jew. back to the old land
unless he were willing to make himself a martyr to
an idea. In. later years, however, the conditions of
that part of the world have materially changed, and
the possibilities of Palestine are now of a character to
attract men of energy and business sagacity. â¢- \j
THE REDEMPTION OP, -PALESTINE;
EASTERN, reports giving an account of the re
cent Zionist convention at Philadelphia state
that "the progress of the movement \ for Jewish Â¦
colonization in Palestine, and the re-establishment of
that country as an independent Jewish state, has been
more notable during the past year than e*yer .before.
Many new societies in this country and in (Western

It is gratifying that the Interior Department pur
poses to enter upon the work of conserving the for
ests of the national domain, and of reforesting areas
that are now bare. The influence of the national Gov
ernment will have its effect upon the States and in
the end a thoroughly satisfactory forestry system may
be adopted in every part of the Union.
While all sections of our own country show the evil
results of forest destruction, various European coun
tries reveal the benefits of forest preservation and cul
tivation. The great forests of Germany, France, Nor
way and Sweden are conducted in such a way as to
yield a considerable profit, while at the same time
being preserved for the benefit of future generations.
Ernest Bruncken, who was for some time secretary
of a forestry commission in Wisconsin, and who has
made a thorough study of the forestry of the country,
has pointed out the extent to. which the great pine
woods have been swept from the lake States. Twenty
years ago the Michigan forests were so large that
Saginaw was the center oil the greatest lumber indus
try in the world, but to-day lumbering on a large scale
in that State is virtually at an end. Wisconsin and
Minnesota will soon be as bare, as Michigan. Mr.
Bruncken says: "There are now in Michigan and
Wisconsin many places that .were thriving villages
and little cities fifteen years ago which are almost de
serted, with the houses falling into ruin. The /pine
lumber of the neighboihood|has all been cut, the saw
mills shut down and with it prosperity has disap-<
peared. What is true of the white pine wiH soon be
true of the Southern long-leaved pine, which is taking
its' place; probably the extreme limit for supplying
the market with original Southern pine on a large
scale is fifty years." â¢
On the Pacific Coast the waste has been fully as
destructive as in the East and the South, if not even
more destructive. The waste here has been due large-
Jy to the frequent forest fires that occur during our
long dry summers, and the annual losses resulting
from them constitute one of the heaviest drains upon
the profits of our industry.
New evidences of the need of -a comprehensive sys
tem t of forest preservation and. for the replanting, of
forests are furnished at frequent intervals in the news
reports from different parts of the country." The Call
has repeatedly directed attention to them. Recently
the Buffalo Express noted that the last group of pine
trees, remnants of a forest that once covered Alle
gany County; have been sold and are to be cut down.
A similar story comes from the South. The Charles
ton News and Courier in commenting upon the de
struction of the pine forests the Southern States
recently stated that unless something be done to check
the waste there will not be a pine tree left in the South
within another generation. - %
Â£> ECRETARY HITCHCOCK is reported to have
'â¢^^''; 'stated that he is. preparing. to organize a Bureau
V<-of Fprestry in. the Department of the Interior to
carry out an extensive system of reforestation upon
plans similar, to .those' employed witlr good Â¦ results in

PASSES AN HOUR FACE
TO FACE WITH DEATH
Tlcznes Encroaching: Upon a Hedding
Miner Die Out as They

REDDING, July L â For Just one hour
Sunday afternoon George Boswell, a mid
dle-aged miner, working alone in a pros
pect shaft nine miles west of Redding,
suffered the tortures of one who sees ap
proaching death in horrible form without
the possibility of escape. Â¦
A forest fire burning dangerously near
and working toward the mouth of the
shaft caused Bodwell to come to the sur
face. He saw he was surrounded by fire.
A box of giant powder was on the ground.
He grasped the dangerous explosive and
hurriedly descended. The flames leaped
over a small cleared space and set fire to
the hoist and platform. The shaft was
timbered. The timbering caught fire and
Boswell's death seemed certain, but the
timbers were green and the fire died out
before it reached the imprisoned and
trembling miner. Providence seemed to
favor him, for in other shafts in the same
vicinity the timbering burned to the bot
tom.

and son, who reside in Rochester, Mich.,
of his death.
Bliss was a member of "Wilson Tent No.
3R9, Knights of the Maccabees, of Owosso,

JAMES HENDERSON KYLE.
Sudden Death of the South Dakota
Senator.
ABERDEEN, S. D., July 1.â Senator
Kyle died this afternoon at 5 o'clock. Sen
ator Kyle was stricken at his home at
Aberdeen about ten days ago. His trou
ble was of malarial origin and resulted in
a functional affection of the heart, .which
caused the greatest alarm. A consulta
tion of physicians was held and his case
scon took a turn for the better, the heart
action growing stronger and the general
condition much more encouraging. One of
the latest bulletins from his bedside last
week was to the effect that he had passed
the danger point and that his recovery
would be certain, though slow. The Sen
ator had a similar attack in the East
some time ago and was liable to a recur
rence of the trouble. His health has not
been robust for a year or so. His relapse
to-day was not expected, however.
James Henderson Kj l le was born near
Xenia, Ohio, February: 24, 1S54. He en
tered the University of Illinois in 1871, tak
ing a course in civil engineering. He next
entered Oberlin College in 1873 and was
graduated from the classical course in
1878. He then prepared fo,r admission to
the bar. but afterward entered the West
ern Theological Seminary at Allegheny,
Pa., graduating in 1882. During these
years he was a teacher of mathematics
and engineering. Subsequently he engaged
for several years in educational and min
isterial work in Utah and South Dakota.
At the time he entered political life he
was the financial secretary of Yankton
College. Yankton, S. D. He was elected
to the State Senate as an independent in
1890, and was elected to the United States
Senate to succee-1 Gideon C. Moody. He

Special Dispatch to . The Call.
SANTA ROSA, July tâ Jesse Reed," the
young man taken off the steamer Alliance
at San Francisco on June 27 and who is
now held by Sheriff irace here, has ac
knowledged that he . is Eugene Stum
baugh and that he is under indictment
by the United States court of the Indian
Territory, district for alleged implication
in the' murder of M. Marshall at Wilbur
ton, Indian Territory, on April 6. The
young man does not take his situation
seriously; in fact, he laughs and jokes
with the officers and other prisoners. He
says that he is innocent of the crime;
that while he was arrested in Wilburton
and fined for carrying concealed weapons
and with several others was in the house
where the murder was committed, he had
nothing to do with the killing of Mar
shall. ,
Stumbaugh la about 21 years of age and
rather prepossessing in appearance. He
says he spent his boyhood days in Ken
tucky and that he is of respectable pa
rentage, but after going to Indian eTr
ritory he got into bad company. After
getting mixed up in the Marshall shooting
affair he concluded to leave that part of
the country, coming to California-
United States Marshal Shine of this dis
trict will take charge of Stumbaugh and
will hand him over to United States Mar
shal Hackett of Indian Territory. Sheriff
Grace has shown cleverness in tracking
Stumbaugh. He received word from
United States Marshal Hackett of South
McAlester, I. T.,,in May that Eugene
Stumbaugh was wanted there for the
murder of Marshall and that prpbably he
would visit relatives residing near Healds
burg, but that Stumbaugh had been there
and gone. He again located Stumbaugh
in Marshneld, Or., and with the assist
ance of the Oregon Sheriff he learned
that he was on the steamer Alliance,
bound for San Francisco: It is said a
reward of $1600 is offered for Stumbaugh's
arrest, and it looks now as though Sheriff
Grace will be that much richer.

TORRENT FLOODS
THE MOKELUMNE
Blue Lakes Dam of the
Standard Company
Gives Way.
Lowland Residents Warned
by Telephone to Save
Their Stock.
Special Dispatch to The Call-
STOCKTON, July Lâ The <Sam of the
Standard Electric Company at Blue Lakes
broke to-day, sending a flood down the
Mokelumne River bottoms. Farmers In
San Joaquin County, who oxen lands on
the river, were warned by telephone and
all stock was driven out to high ground.
Near Clements the bottom â¢ lands were
covered with new cut hay and that was
ruined. The first report was that the
water rose twenty-five feet, and it prob
ably did in the deep canyons, but when
the water spread out in this county It was
eight feet high at Clements and ran wider
farther down the stream. The alarm was
telephoned along to the reclaimed lands
west of Woodbridge, but no danger was
feared there, for there is ample room for
such a flood at this time. The mining
dredger above Clements and near Wal
lace was given a timely notice to get out
of the flood, and along the course of the
river the damage will not be very grear,
except in losses of hay crops of one cut
ting. The rush of water brought down
large quantities of driftwood and logs and
the people viewed the flood with interest
at all points.
The understanding in this section is that
the dam was one of a series recently built
by the Standard Company to hold reserve
water for its big plant above Mokelumne
Hill. Land owners who were greatly
frightened at first now feel safer. The
flood had reached Clements at 8 o'clock
to-night.
MOKELUMNE HILI* July 1.â The dam
of the Standard Electric Company, built
across the outlet of Blue Lakes, about
eighty miles from this place, broke some
time last night and the water reached
here about 3 o'clock this afternoon. News
reached Mokelumne Hill by telephone in
advance and hundreds of persons rushed
to the big bar nearest the point to wait
for the flood. It came, but It did not
reach the expectations of the people, as
the river rose but little above high water
mark. No doubt some of the lower dams
of the company have been broken, but the
amount of damage has not yet been as
certained.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. July 1.â
Until the return from Honolulu of Con
tractor McGillivray* who is erecting all of
the buildings now going up at the .uni
versity, there will be little work done
here. This morning the laborers went out
on a strike and as the masons must have
their aid, they, too, have stopped, though
not Involved In the strike.
The cause of the trouble Is the employ
ment of two non-union men. A branch of
the San Jose Laborers* Protective Asso
ciation was recently organized in Mayfleld
and all of the workmen but two joined.
The others asked for the substitution of
union men- in the places of these two and
gave notice that they would not work
after last Saturday evening unless their
request were granted. Finding the two
non-union laborers still at work this
morning, they quit.
McGillivray is expected back from the
Hawaiian Islands in a few days and pend
ing his arrival no attempt will be made to
fill the places of the strikers or to pro
ceed with building:.

"Domestic raisins are flat, pending the un
certainty .as to the disposition to be made of
the stocks of the Raisin Association. Loose
Muscatels are easier, some of the 4-crown goods
recently sold on the Coast at S^jc, supposedly
for manufacturing purposes, being offered on
the spot at lower quotations. These goods show
very fair quality. California layers are dull.
A little traOe is noted In imported 2-crown and
S-crown Sultanas around 12@13c. Four-crown
are scarce. Some slight inquiry is noted for
Valencia layers also. There is a small trade in
apricots, sale of one lot of a little over 100 bags
cf iancy Moorparks being reported at 12%c. No
interest appears to be taken in new crop apri
cots. Prunes continue to be wanted in a small
way and etocks are very gradually being re
duced." . *
Mail advices from New York say:
â¢ "There is very litle doing In any line of dried
fruits, buying being wholly of a hand-to-mouth
order. Currants are quiet, no transactions of
any size beinc reported yesterday. All re
ports Indicate a good crop in Greece 'with no
attack from perinosparos reported up to date.
New crop has been offered here during the past
week or so from Greece at from 21@23s for
Amalias, equivalent to about 6Â»i<jz7 1 -ic, duty
paid, laid down in this market. No buying of
luture currants, however, is reported, and buy-_
ere here have shown little Interest in new goods
as yet. Mail advices from London, under date
of June 15, report a weaker spot market there,
sales of Provincials and ordinary Vostizzas
ehowing a decline of about 2s per cwt.
Dried Fruit in New York.
The London Grocers' Gazette of June 15
eays: "A quietly 6teady tone has to be re
ported In salmon in this market. There is not
a rreat amount of business passing, but the
statistical position is healthy, and fine goods
are in small compass. There :s less doing in
California fruits, but prie'es are firmly held.
We understand that the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer hinted to the deputation â¢ which waited
upon him on Thursday with regard to the extra
charges involved in the Imposition of the sugar
duty in relation to forward contracts, that some
modification of the duty on* preserved apricots
would be made. Pines are steady, with but lit
tle business doing owing to the oaucity of sup
plies. In Liverpool prices for all kinds of fruits
are well maintained, particularly apricots and
pineapples. There has been some lii^uiry for
apricot pulp as the duty of 7s per c/wt. will
make a great difference In the prices asked for
that article."

Stocks of Grain.
Produce Exchange call board sales during the
crop year just closed were 1,016,606 tons Wheat
and 138,500 tons Barley, against 1,497,800 tons

prices for stocks which were aroused by the
action of the market during the latter part of
last week were not realized to-day. It is no
unurual thing for the effect of July disburse
ments upon the money market to ba delayed
sometimes for a week or two, the looked for
demand for reinvestment failing to appear and
the rate for money holding comparatively firm.
These conditions had sway, although there was
some relaxation in j the call money market.
There were, however, a number of more or less
disturbing factors which discouraeed buying, ,
and when last week's buyers attempted to take
their profits they met no demand to absorb
their offerings and prices melted away easily
on a small volume of business. The tone of
the foreign markets was quite cheerful and
the occasion of some opening advances here.
The passing of the semi-annual settlement day
at Berlin without a hitch was a great relief
to all the foreign markets and heavy dis
bursements of Government interest in London
made money and discounts easy there, but
the market here had to face the action of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel
Workers in inaugurating a strike in the steel
trade. Officers of the United States Steel Cor
poration professed to belittle the effects of the
strike, but its effects were manifest upon the
price of the company's stocks nevertheless.
The independent steel companies were also
weak. 'United States Steel, both common and
preferred, lost 1%, and Colorado Fuel and
Tennessee Coal about 3 each. The expected
dividend action on United States Steel to-mor r
row was also a factor in the situation, the
bears striving to discredit rumors that the
common stock would be placed on a 4 per cent
dividend basis. Fears of damage to the corn
crop from drouth in Missouri, Kansas and
Texas especially depressed the corn carrying
grangers, which were more vulnerable by rea
son of last week's strength. The decline,
reached ZVt in St. Paul, 3 in Rock Island, 2% in
Illinois Central, VA in Union Pacific and Texas
Pacific and 2 in Atchison preferred. The hand
of the bears was manifest in the circulation of
some rumors to the effect that the clearing
house> was In consultation over the affairs of
some of the clearing-house institutions. Thera
was certainly no such consultation and there
were emphatic denials of any thought or inten
tion or necessity of such a consultation, but the
effect produced by the rumors showed rather
strikingly that last week's failures have left
the speculative .mind in an Impressionable
state. There is good ground for the suppo
sition' that last week's episode has prompted
some overhauling of coliateral for bank loans
and has induced a rather stringent caution on
the part of the banks in the certification of
checks. It must follow that business by the
Stock Exchange houses is conducted i with
somewhat less facility than when the machin
ery of credit was entirely untrammeled.
There is nothing to show that any further
ground than this exists for the rumors cir
culated of financial troubles. The fierce heat
had its effect on the trading, as it had on all
other kinds of human activity. . There was
notable strength in the Iowa Central stocks
and in the New York. Chicago and St. Louis
stocks, the gains extending to about 2 to 6
points. Most of the active stocks were off a
point or more during the day and the closing
was heavy and dull.
There was little doing in railroad bonds, but
prices yielded in sympathy with stocks. Total
sales, par value. $1,800,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the first call. ' .â¢ f

A large local house yesterday received a let
ter from its French correspondent saying that
the French Prune crop would be light and that
no California Prunes of the crop of 1900 would
be received. This means^ that the carry-over
stock of Prunes will have to be sold "as is,"
and that the : European demand will not be
satisfied with anything-, else than- new Prunes
The French crop last year was about 90,000 0W)
pounds; this year it is estimated at not to ex
ceed 30.000,000 pounds. . The highest estimates of
the California crop do not run over one-half of
last year's crop, while many authorities place
the yield even lower. _~ Â¦ ,: :Â»_â¢.---...

DKCIDUOUS FRUITS.
. There was ' no Orange auction yesterday and
there is not likely to be any more until the
new season begins. The market continues weak
and dull. Limes are higher, but Lemons show
no change.
There was general complaint yesterday of the
poor condition of the fruit, most of the arrivals
showine the effects of the recent hot wave in
the Interior. The Peaches were soft and mushy
and the Plums sunburned. Prices showed little
change, however, except for Figs, . which did
better. More white Nectarines carries in and
sold at $1 per box. Arrivals of Cherries were
so light that they were hardly quotable. Stocks
of Apricots showed a material falling oft from
the close of last week. Berries sold rather low.

$1 50 per box.*

Receipts were 50,500 pounds and 108 tubs of
Butter, SOS cases of Eggs, 430 cases Eastern
Eggs, 10,500 pounds of California Cheese and
pounds Eastern Cheese.
Some Idea of the weakness of the Egg market
may be gained from the fact that 1200 cases
went into cold storage last week and 4000 cases
were still on the market at the close' of busi
ness Saturday. The market yesterday continued
deprersed with large stocks, and prices were
generally lower on the Dairy Exchange. No
decline was quoted in the open market, but
all dealers quoted the feeling weak, especially
for the medium and lower grades.
There was no. change observable in Butter and
Cheese. Both were in liberal supply and quiet.

"My wife is the cause of what I have
done. Farewell to all."
Such was the message that Louis
Schubert left in his room at Broadway
and Sixth street, where he died yes
terday under circumstances which
pointed strongly to suicide. But the mys
tery which enveloped the death of the for
mer East Oakland wagon builder has been
deepened to-day by the failure of the sur
geons who held a post mortem examina
tion at the morgue to find the slightest
trace of poison and there was no mark of
violence self-inflicted or otherwise upon
the body. The doctors made a very care
ful and detailed examination. After -it
had been completed Dr. J. T. Kitchings,
who had charge of the autopsy, declared
that Schubert had died from natural
cause and that undoubtedly congestion of
the lungs bad been the trouble.
The surgeon's views were upheld by
Dr. H. N. Rucker, who assisted at the
post-mortem.
That Schubert had intended to end his
life is the belief of his wife, who had left
him, and no later than last Friday, the
same day he wrote his farewell message,
had refused to return to her husband be
cause of his cruelty. That same day he
rented the room at the Broadway lodg
ing house where he died. He had been
residing in San Francisco since his re
turn from St. Louis, where, strangely
enough, he had written a will less than
two weeks before the end came.
Schubert had been persistent In his ef
forts to induce Mrs. Schubert to return to
him, but she said she feared for her life,
as he had not only threatened to kill him
self, but her as well.
Dr. Kitchings, who was called to attend
Schubert on Sunday, found him in a dying
condition. The physician said yesterday
that he was unable to find symptoms of
poisoning, and he reported this afternoon
upon the completion of the post-mortem
examination that his diagnosis had been
borne out.
"It is not Improbable that Schubert
might have intended to commit suicide,"
said Dr. Kitchings, "but if he took any
drug he thought was poisonous It was not
the cause of death. The only possible
cause as evidenced by the condition of the
remains is congestion of the lungs, and
the symptoms I found yesterday indicated
that disease.- ',"
"The letters, and other documents found
In his possession would show that Schu
bert had elthtr Intended to end his life or
realizing that he was very ill had decided
to attempt to throw a stigma upon the
woman who had refused to again live
with him."

Detectives McMahon and Ed Gibson
were detailed on the case and after dili
gent Inquiry they learned yesterday morn
ing that the Chinese, whose real name is
Horn King, had sailed on the steamship
China for China on Saturday afternoon at
1 o'clock. He dashed on board about a
minute before tbe steamship . left the
wharf. He was observed by some mem
bers of the Chinese Six Companies who
were watching the passengers to see that
no Chinese debtor sailed without paying
his debts. As Horn King 'was a debtor,
they raised an outcry and attempted to
have him detained, but he mixed among
the other Chinese on board and the vessel
could not be delayed.
His unexplained absence Friday and
Saturday led to the suspicion that some
thing was wrong, and on going to a bu
reau, drawer In her bedroom upstairs Mrs.
Diiigee discovered that the $1300 In cur
rency which she had placed there Thurs
day had disappeared.. It occurred to her
that the Chinese servant had seen her

JAMES COOPER
LOSES HIS CASH
Masked Robber Relieves
Saloon - Keeper of
Day's Receipts.
Thief Demands the Coin at
the Point of a Leveled
Revolver.
Oakland Office 1 San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, July 1.
A daring hold-up took place nl Emery
ville to-night, when a masked robber se
cured $183 from James Cooper, who keeps
a ! saioon on Peralta street, just over the
city line. -
Cooper was making arrangements to
close his ealoon for the night. He took
all of the money out of his till and went
to the safe In the back of the store to
deposit the collections of the day. While
the safe was open Cooper thought he
would count his money, and he took out
all the safe contained. Just as he got the
money out and was counting It he heard
some jne say, "Hand that over."
Cooper looked up and saw a short,
thick-set man. dressed in dark clothes
and with a gray - mask over his face,
pointing 1 a pistol directly at his head.
"Not if I know It." replied Cooper.
When the saloon-keeper said this he
heard a voice on the outside say very dis
tinctly, "Plug him if he don't grive up.".
The pistol was pointed at his head and
the man was evidently reinforced by oth
ers on the outside. The odds were too
great against him, and Cooper decided
that he would take no chances and â¢ al
lowed the man to take . the money, $186.
As soon as he j?ot the coin he backed out
of the saloon and disappeared in the dark
ness.
Emeryville has no regular police force,
but the Oakland police were notified. The
description of the robber seen is not very
clear, and there is no idea of the direction
taken by the men with their. booty.

school, was the first witness called and
Miss Coleman, teacher of. the eighth
grade, was the second. . Both teachers told
how the. principal had not ordered them
to leave "Thanatopsis" and "Snowbound"
out of the course of study, for those two
poems were the ones upon which the pu
pils had failed and which It was charged
had never been taught to the children.
They also told how many times Miss Mc-
Kenzie visited their classrooms and what
lessons she gave. Then followed through
the -remainder of- the morning and the
greater part of the afternoon parents and
pupils. They told how the children had
done well in the school until they reached
the eighth grade, where they failed of
promotion into 1 the high school. There
.was also a great deal said about the lack
of reports made by the teachers and the
principal to the parents, all of which was
directed ; toward showing that the par
ents were not kept informed of the stand-
Ing of their children. That ended the
case against Miss McKenzie.
The defendant was then called to the
stand. With her she brought several
typewritten pages, which at the first
question from her attorney she com
menced to read. Three or fpur of the
pages were read before the board decided
that the statement was more in the na
ture of 'argument than testimony, and
consequently it was ordered filed without
further reading. . .
Miss McKenzie's testimony went to
show that she had kept as close to the
course of study as her pupils would allow.
She said the pupils of her school are in a
great proportion of foreign families, anil
that they hear but little English at home;
consequently they are backward in that
study in school and when it came to the
high school examinations that included
matter the teachers had' not been able to
reach those children failed .absolutely.
Miss McKenzie referred to the course of
study where it warns teachers against
hurrying through without regard to thor
oughness, and also where it declares that
circles, one of the principal subjects . of
the recent conferences between â¢ Cardinal
Gibbons, Archbishop Chapelle. and I Cardi
nal Rampolla was how' to devise means

thies of the priests in Cuba and the

quested that the necessary measures . be
taken to secure the Immigration of Dutch,
Belgian, French and - American clergy
men to Cuba and the Philippines In order
to gradually dilute the pro-Spanish prin
ciples of the priesthood. It Is added that

principal of the Hancock Gram
mar School,' commenced before
the Board of Education yesterday
morning. It ran along through
the business hours of the day and finally
adjourned to be taken up again on the
morning of July 12.
The parents of a number of unpromoted
pupils have made charges of incompe
tence, of inattention to duties, of unfltness
to teach, of awarding medals where no
award should have' been made and of re
fusing to stick to the course of study
against Miss McKenzie, and the board is
trying to find out what the charges are
based upon. .
R.-W. Campbell represented MIes Mc-
Kenzie in the examination ye<>*erday.
Thomas D. Aitken represented ie dis
pleased parents and Director Casse iy pre
sided.
With a deElre to get down to business
at once,. Mr. Casserly called Miss McKen
zie as the first witness, but her counsel
refused to allow her to go on the stand.
He said Miss McKenzie was present to
answer charges made against her, not to
prove them. He suggested that the
charges first be made and proved by the
complainants and then when the time for
the defense came he would put, Mips Mc-
Kenzie on the stand for examination and
cross-examination.
This aspect of the situation rather stag-'
gered the board, and when Campbell
further declared that the charges had not
been properly brought and moved that
because of that fact they be dismissed,
the board went so far as to take a vote
on the proposition and decide that the
charges were good enough to work on
anyway.

.McKenzie said that is absolutely in the
hands of the principal, and so far as she
is concerned- the medals had always been
properly awarded. There was a good deal
more said about the reports of the chil
dren, the gist of which was that Miss
McKenzie believed such matters to be the
duty of the teachers, and they should at
tend to the reports without supervision.
As some of the Directors are going out
of town and as there will be a cross-ex
amination of Miss McKenzie, it was de
cided to adjourn the investigation until
July 12 at 10 o'clock, on which date it
will be' taken up and finished.
Miss McKenzie said also that her school
was in such a shape that she could not
devote- much of her time to 'the higher
grades, and that consequently they were
left almost entirely to the vice principal
and the class teachers. She said that out
of 195 school days since December she has
taught a class as a substitute forty-five
days. This, she said, was an injustice to
her and to the school. In September, 1900.
she complained to the Superintendent of
some of the teachers and asked for relief,
but it was some time in coming. She
read a copy of a letter she had sent to
Superintendent Webster, and for a time
it looked as if he was going to be called
upon to explain why it was he did not
bring the letter before the board, but it
was shown that he brought the substance
of It to the Directors' notice and the mat
ter passed.
About the neglect to teach "Thanatop
sis" and "Snowbound" in the course in
English, Miss MeKenzie said -she was as
surprised as any one when, a few days
before the close of school,' she learned
that the two poems had not been reached
by the upper classes. She expected that
her teachers would reach them, and she
was disappointed when they did not.

worked its way to
lie front, and is now known in every city, town and hamlet in the country. Its
staunchest friends arc those who have known it longest and have witnessed its
wonderful curative powers in their own families or among their . friends and
acquaintances. Grateful patients in all parts of the country tell of their restoration
to health and happiness, and the testimony of these is the highest evidence of the
medicine's Â¦worth. S. S. S. is more popular today than ever in. its history â no
other remedy stands so high, has ever given such perfect satisfaction or is so
reliable in the cure of Cancer, Rheumatism, Catarrh, Contagious Blood Poison,
Scrofula, Eczema, Psoriasis, Salt Rheum, Acne, or any disease that originates in
the blood- Being strictly a vegetable preparation, you will find it agrees with you
much better than a drug store concoction or any of the widely advertised potash
and mercury remedies, which affect the bones, muscles and stomach, causing
_ _ - _ â 'Â«..'- Rheumatism or Dyspepsia. If you
gJOn't Experimentâ have never tried S. S. S., you will be
b rÂ» c* rÂ» surprised at the immediate good effects,
iS3sCG Sm Sm Sm for no sooner does it get into the circulation than the
appetite increases; you grow stronger, and gradually
but surely it drives out the poisons and restores the blood to a healthy condition.
If there is a sore or ulcer on the body, it begins to heal around the edges, the dis-
charge finally ceases and the place gets -well ; muscular and bone pains vanish, and
the skin is relieved of all itching, irritating eruptions. Nervous, run down and
anaemic people will find S. S. S. just the medicine they need, for blood poverty
and illy nourished nerves are responsible for their condition. For old people and
children S. S. S. has no equal; being free from all minerals, it does not nauseate
or have any injurious effect whatever, and keeps the blood in good condition, thus
f ortif yinÂ» against disease. Experience teaches what is good and what is not good ;
this applies particularly to medicine, and S. S. S., a remedy that has retained the
confidence of the people for nearly 50 years, must have merit â IT cures, is the
secret of its success. When you call for S. S. S. _jr*ti_
don't be persuaded to accept something else â if l ** g J**fr
there is no substitute for S..S. S. It is the only J f"^^ M Â£
guaranteed purely vegetable blood purifier, and X^ 1^-^ .^J^*^
the safest and best for all blood. and skin
troubles. Do not let them force an inferior fr^ 3 J I^^^J 1 K^^r M
mineral remedy on you because there is a larger 4^/^~^#
profit in it. If you have any blood or 6kin dis- m^^. m^^
ease, don't hesitate to write us about it; our physicians will carefully consider
your case and advise you without charge. Book on Blood and f kin Diseases free.

Receptions.
Cities of All States m
Â¦Visitors Are Coming From
Europe, Canada and
Honolulu. Â¦-
. The Epworth League officials are in re
ceipt of information that other States, are
planning, to give extensive . receptions to
the delegates from I the Bast. In Utah,
Arizona, Oregon and "Washington prepar
ations are under way. to greet the visit
ors and to interest them in the prospects
of the respective States.
â¢ At . Salt Lake City the people are ar
ranging, a grand public reception for the
Leaguers to be held on July 16. On that
day more "than a ; dozen , excursion ; trains
will arrive In the city, where they, will re
main "until the following day. Â¦ Some of
the leading â¢ officials in the League have
been prevailed upon to address meetings
at Salt Lake City and other towns in the
vicinity, and strong efforts will be made
to induce the visitors, when they are com
ing to live permanently In this section of
the country, as it is thought many of
them ; will do, to locate in Utah.
Preparations of a. similar nature are un
der way at Portland and Seattle. The
people throughout the "West have talten a
great Interest in the convention and it
seems to be the wish of all that -this
event, which is to be , the greatest of its
kini ever held west of the Mississippi,
shall 'also be the most successful. A large
delegation is coming 1 from Honolulu, six
trainloads of Leaguers from Eastern Can
ada and many also are expected from Eu
rope. The influence of the convention will
be far-reaching and most beneficial to
California. / -
The outside towns of this State continue
in their preparations for the event. En
thusiastic meetings are being held reg
ularly "at Sacramento and the visitors
will be received In that city with cheering
and gifts of fruits and flowers. >. The peo
ple of Solanq County are planning to trim
the ship Solano with the Epworth League
red and white and-bring it to this city.
A military parade has been arranged to
take place at the Presidio on July 20. AH
the soldiers at the reservation will take
part It is expected that General Young
will conduct the parade.. . . ;
Dr. Beard says there is no hitch In any
part of the arrangements except the col
lection of funds, which is not progressing
as rapidly as Is desired. The time for a
large public contribution is somewhat in
auspicious so soon after the canvass for
money for the Presidential reception, but
it is confidently expected that the neces
sary amount will be on hand in due sea
son. - â¢ Â¦ '- ' ' â¢" Â¦ -â¢ - Â¦ - . â¢Â¦' â¢ - -
NEW "HEIBS" FILE CLAIMS
AGAINST FRIEDMAN ESTATE
Judge TToutt Sets Aside an Order to
. Enable Them to Present
. Proofs. ; v x
Judge Troutt made an order yesterday
reopening the Julius Friedman estate for
the purpose of permitting new claims of
relationship to be filed. The order was
made upon the motion of Attorney A.
Ruef as counsel i for Abraham Jacobsen
and five brothers and sisters, who claim
to be nephews and nieces of the deceased.
The claimants aver that they are the
children of -Judel- Jacobsen, a brother of
tho deceased. They explain the variance
between the names of the deceased and
their father by. pointing to the fact that
they were natives of Poland and raised
in Russia, "where it is not uncommon
owing te the /act that Jews are . perse
duted to a certain extent in .Russia, for
Jews to change their names."' â¢ .
They aver that they frequently heard
their, father "refer to his brother Julius,
who resided in" San Francisco," and acting
upon information and belief they ask that
they be adjudged , the -heirs at law of the
deceased and entitled to the . bulk of his
estate. ;'

No Strike of Street-Sweepers.
"We put 100 of our old men to work on
the streets this morning," said G. F.
Gray of Gray Brothers, street-sweeping
contractors, yesterday. "We have had no
strike in the proper sense of the word.
Some of our men formed a Street Sweep
ers' Union weeks ago. We did not pay a
great deal of attention to that. Then they
got an idea that they might lose their
jobs, and on Wednesday night they held
a meeting, disbanded their union and that
vras the end of it. I did put some eight
or ten colored men at work, but they have
as good a right to -work for a living as
anybody else, and are good workmen. As
I said first. 100 experienced men reported
for duty this morning and were put on
their jobs." Â¦

A RAZOR IN THE PARK
Body of Unidentified Man Found
Among Sand Dunes Near the
Ocean.
Constantine Cisneros, a boy, living with
his parents at 1317 Powell street, found
the body of a suicide yesterday morning
in Golden Gate Park. The boy was walk
ing- among the brush-covered sand dunes
not far frcm the life-saving station south
of. the Cliff House about 8 o'clock, and
he observed a strong odor proceeding from
a clump cf trees and bushes. Drawing
nearer to the spot he discovered the body
of a man. the clothing blood-stained and
en open razor lying near. The throat had
been cut.
The body was removed to the Morgue
and searched for evidence that might lead
to identification. Nothing was found in
the pockets but a carpenter's two-foot
rule, two lead pencils, a pocketknife and
two keys. The body was so much decom
posed that the features were unrecogniza
ble. It was that of a man about five feet
nine Inches tall arid was attired in a dark
suit, with" white shirt and turned-down
collar, black tla. black congress gaiters,
gray trousers and black slouch hat. ~. u?

In the' city prison awaiting investigation
on several charges of burglary alleged to
have been committed within the past

Three months ago Bernstein was re
turned to the Sheriff of this county from
the Whittier Reform School, whither he
had been sent for having committed a re
volting crime. His condutt about the in
stitution of reform became so obnoxious
that the superintendent would not Keep
him. and ordered him returned for trial.
Judge Cook was merciful and offered the
lad another chance upon . his promise to
appear in court once a month and to mend
his evil ways.
Now Detective Edward O'Dea has ac
cused the paroled offender of two burg
laries and expects to trace more deeds
to his door. On Sunday morning Bern
stein is said to have broken Into a grocery
store conducted by Dreyfus & Constlne

"jimmie" to the cash register and ex
tracting its contents he passed a
quantity of groceries out. to a number of
little boys whom he induced to accompany
him and disposed of his plunder in the
neighborhood. Three boys were* arrested
with . Bernstein. The other burglary was
committed in the Knickerbocker Hotel on
Van Ness avenue. One of the rooms in the
hostelry was rifled and $10 in cash taken.

- "We are not borrowing a great deal of
trouble about the strike of the men em
ployed by the American Steel Hoop Com
pany,'" Bald Grove L. Ayers, manager for
Holbrook. Merrill & Stetson, yesterday.
"All the Eastern mills are crowded with
Â¦work now, and we have considerable dif
ficulty in having .our orders filled. Of
course, a strike at this time will not make
our troubles any the less. But beyond the
difficulty of filling orders for sheet metal
and hoop iron I do not think the strike
will be lelt in San Francisco. But little
sheet iron is manufactured on this coast.
Our whole trouble will be the difficulty
In filling orders promptly in the East."
"We have a few men at work making
black iron," said Irwin Ayers of the Pa
cific Sheet Metal Works. "They are at
wprk now, and if they have been ordered
to strike I will know it no sooner than
anvbodv else. I know nothing about the
strike of the sheet metal workers beyond
what I have seen in the dispatches to the
newspapers. Our own men have given no
signs of tlissatisf action."
,A11 the "black" iron workers in the city

there were no indications that a strike

Carpenters Will 2Tot Change Building
Trades' Constitution.
At the meeting of Carpenters* Union
Ko. 483 held last night 1T5 members voted
against the proposed revision of the con
stitution of the Building Trades Council.
The reason given by the members who
voted "nay" was that the proposed change
in ' the constitution repudiated national
unions and afforded an opportunity for
the centralization of power.
The union also withdrew its support
from Organized Labor on the ground that
the paper no longer represented organized
labor.
The dues of the members of the union
â¢were raised from 60 to 75 cents per month
by an almost unanimous vote.
OPPOSE CENTRALIZATION".
The Join executive committee of the
Wholesale Butchers* Association and of
I the Retail and Jobbing Butchers held a
meeting yesterday afternoon and agreed
to furnish no more meat to restaurants
displaying the union card.
Last night, notices were sent to, all the
restaurants in the city to the effect that
after 3 o'clock to-day no more meat would
be furnished to restaurants displaying
the union card. This practically settles
the strike, the wholesole butchers being
all Included in the agreement. It is un
derstood that the wholesale oyster deal
ers intend to take similar action. I
It is claimed by the Cooks* and Waiters
Union that there are upward of 200 union
restaurants in the city, but the -whole
salers say they have only been able to
find about 130.
The petition for an injunction against

Three years ago Morosco built one of the
finest country homes in the State on his
farm In the Fruitvale hills. Of late the
active management Â¦ of his theater has
been In the hands of his son. while his at
tention has been devoted to his horses and
other blood stock of his farm. His latest
fad is a team of ten Shetland ponies
driven tandem fashion. He announces
that he will not re-enter the theatrical
field, either as manager or proprietor. '
It was in 1886 that Morosco opened Union
Hall on Howard street, afterward known
as Morosco's Theater. He installed there
San Francisco's first stock company pfay
ing at popular prices.
After eight years, in which he amassed a
considerable fortune, he disposed of the
Howard-street playhouse and took a lease
on the Grand Opera-house, in 1894. He fol
lowed the same policy there, but on a more
ambitious scale, always . priding himself
upon furnishing amusement to the
humbler classes.
Morosco made a tour of the coast with
Sherman's circus in 1884, and afterward
took the show to the Hawaiian Islands.
In 18S5 he opened the Wigwam, located on
the present site of the Spring Valley
Waterworks Building, as an amusement
house. If had previously been used for
political meetings. He nrst Installed a cir
cus in it and it developed into variety and
then into vaudeville, the Orpheum being
the final outcome.
IiOng Career as Manager.
In 1SS0 Morosco became manager of Dan
Rice's circus. He came to San Francisco
in 1882 and with his son, Harry Morosco,
appeared in Andrews & Stockwell's stock
company production of "Humpty
Dumpty" at the Grand Opera-house, of
which theater he secured control just
twelve years later.
The sale of the Grand Opera-house
marks the retirement of Walter Morosco
from the theatrical field..
The veteran manager and proprietor be
gan as a circus rider and acrobat, at the
age of 15. His real name is Walter
Bishop. That is the name upon the door
plate of his elegant country home in the
Fruitvale hills, and the name he uses in
private business transactions. Lewis H.
Bishop, financial manager of ' the Grand
Opera-house, is his half-brother.
Morosco's father, Joel Bishop, was a
Guilford, Conn., merchant of old May
flower stock. His son Walter left home
at 15 to join a circus and took the name of
Walter Melville. Finding that other acro
bats bore the name of Melville he changed
to that of Walter Morosco and had the
name copyrighted. And as Morosco has
he always been known here, and his son
and his son's children, though Bishop is
the name of the three generations.
Retires From Theatrical Field.
The theatrical investments of Messrs.
Ackerman and Meyerfeld have in the past
been limited to vaudeville houses. Meyer
feld is president of the Orpheum Circuit
Company. Ackerman is president of the
reorganized Chutes Company. Both are
heavy stockholders in each of these, and
also in the Olympia. The purchase of the
Grand Opera-house is their first Invest
ment in a playhouse devoted to the dra
ma. The new company will be incorpo
rated within a iew days. It will be a close
corporation, with a few other stockholders
besides the three named.
It is said that Morosco has expended
$100,000 on . the furnishings of the play
house during the last seven years. Two
years ago he refurnished it at a cost of
$40,000. The electric lighting system alone
cost $10,000.
From Vaudeville to Drama.
Other parties approached Morosco re
cently with a view to the purchase of the
theater, among them a client of Otto I.
Wise. Morosco named his price, but the
deal was not made. Knowledge of the ne
gotiations came to Messrs Ackerman and
Meyerfeld, and they conceived the idea of
adding â¢ to their theatrical investments.
Mr. Ackerman conducted the
for the proposed company. I
Morosco stipulated from the start that
his son, Harry Morosco, should have a
one-fourth interest in the new corpora
tion, and the sale was made under such
arrangement.
The Grand Opera-house was purchased
yesterday from Walter Morosco by a com
pany of which Charles L. Ackerman, Mor
ris Meyerfeld and Harry Morosco are the
organizers, and which will be incorporated
under the name of the Grand Opera-house
Company.. The transfer of ownership will
not affect the policy of the management,
and a stock company will be;installed at
the close of the Frawley season of eight
weeks, under the management of Harry
Morosco. There will be the regular grand
opera season, as last year.
The purchase price was $60,000, and the
transfer included a three-year, lease, of
which but two months has expired, an op
tion for a five-year lease at the expiration
of the present '.ease and all the furnishings
of the opera-house. The building is owned
by James L. Flood and John "W. Mackay.
Negotiations between the purchasers
and Morosco began but four days before
the consummation of the sale. Agreement
was reached tsunday and the tirst pay
ment was made yesterday, Charles L.
Ackerman receiving for himself and asso
ciates the lease and option and a bill of
sale for the theater furnishings.

Â¦ Neil McCarthy, a plumber residing . at
316 Chestnut street, committed suicide, by
leaping from a seventy- five-foot (bluff at
the end of Kearny street early Sunday
morning. ' The body was discovered yes
terday afternoon under a pile of frames,
where the unfortunate man had dragged
himself after he had made the fatal jump
and just before he .expired, j McCarthy
was suffering from dementia, due to the
excessive use of "intoxicants, when he
rushed from his home to the scene $t his
death, attired only in an undershirt.'
McCarthy had been drinking for some
time. He. was arrested several days ago
by Sergeant of Police Christiansen and
Officer Robert Silver after, a desperate
struggle on Stocktqn street. After his re
lease from jail he was sent to his home,
where his relatives attempted to care for
him.
Sunday morning the unfortunate man
became violent and could â¢ not be con
trolled. He jumped out of bed and before
he could be stopped ran Into the street.
He was soon lost to sight and all effort
to find a trace of him proved futile. For
two days friends conducted a search, but
the demented man could not be located, j
Yesterday afternoon Morris Halloran,
employed as a. watchman for a North"
Beach iron works, located the body of Mc-
Carthy under the pile of molders' frames
and reported the case to the Morgue. Mc-
Carthy had fractured both legs, by the
fall and bled to death.

When the Readers Jn the. opposition
heard this disquieting rumor a committee
of deputies waited on Scott at his resi
dence and asked him point blank If he
had made the agreement mentioned with
the Mayor. Scott swore that he made no
such compact.
The deputies retired satisfied tha.t their
superior would not go back- on them.
They are still somewhat Â»perturbed over
the rumored intention of some of the dep
uties to retire from the fight against civil
service, and Casey's resignation has made
them still more uneasy.
The deputies have not drawn salary
for two months because of the protest
of the Mayor against their payment by
the Treasurer. Some of the deputies' are
chafing over the fact that they are not
drawing any pay. It was on the cards
that McCabe, Casey and Janes intended
to resign under an alleged agreement be
tween- Tax Collector Scott and Mayor
Phelan whereby the other deputies would
be discharged and the eligibles, certified
by. the commission,- would replace them.
This would- Insure the appointment of
Casey,. Salomon, Janes, Hume and Mc-
Cabe.
Al Lewald, another deputy, who did not
take the examination, sued out a restrain
ing order some time ago to prevent the
Civil Service Commission from interfering
with the positions of the deputies. Judge
Murasky has the case under advisement
and wi;l render a decision in a few- days.
.' Of the fifteen deputies employed in the
Tax and License offices only three w^re
sufficiently high on the eligible list to be
certain of certification by the Civil Ser
vice Commission. /They are Ben Salomor,
A. W. Janes and James McCabe. Since
the announcement of the eligible list
Casey and .William Hume would be as
sured of selection because several eligi
bles have either left the city or have been
appointed to other positions.
Edward J. Casey, one of Tax Collector
Scott's deputies, resigned his position yes
terday, and rumors are rife around the
City Hall that Casey's action is the be
ginning of a weakening in the opposition
to the appointment, of civil service el'gi
bles to succeed the deputies who refuse
to give up their positions. Casey gives as
the reason for his resignation that Coun
ty Clerk Deane has promised to appoint
him clerk, of the Police Court to succeed
J. J. Groom, who has resigned.
