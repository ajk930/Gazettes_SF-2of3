true enough,' came to them, but much
more happiness than Is the lot of most.
They made happiness : for themselves.

young people "of this generation. "They

both, and their eyes beamed Intensely
with love. The was attired in a

the family. Tho groom was a very brave

and ' . Â¦& â¢' manly expression, yet tender
withal. In all they were as likely a
couple as* one might see in many a day."
Then the story goes on-to Bay that the
wedding feast was "sumptuous In the ex
treme; the table fairly. groaning with the
good viands 'spread upon it. , There was a
supper fit for a king, or let us say for a
president as better fitting the. condition of

time. They were both as devoutly reli
gious people as ever lived.
This William McKinley, to whom she
had given her heart and was presently to
give her hand, was as promising a young
man os her. father had ever hoped for.
He was descended from a long line of citi
zens who in times of peace were foremost
In Industry and In the days of war were
always at the front.' His people were
Highland Scotch, brawny and brainy men,
who needed only tho opportunities and
enlightenment of education.' They were
not of the royalist /tribes of â Scotland,
but a sturdy set, with a determined
though imperfectly developed idea of free
dom. Liberty of conscience was real with
them, and they left the Highlands for, th*
North of Ireland, seeking independence,
and thence to America for the greater
mini, nuere ner ancestors nau ncu to ta
capo religious tyranny lh England. The
first of tha Robo family to emigrate to
America was Andrew, who came with
William Penn and was one of the repre
sentatives Of , the thirteen colonies be
fore the rebellion against Great Britain.
He owned. the land on which Doylestown
staeds to-day. It was his son, Andrew
Rose, who was the father of Mary Rose,
the mother, of William McKinley Sr.
This Andrew Rose did more than double
fluty in the war for freedom against Great
Britain. He fought and made weapons
to fight with. / Â¦<
David McKinley's second son, James,

raised a lateo family. That Deems to
have been just as characteristic of them
as It was of 'tho Allison house.. William

James McKinley, a fine Scotch-Irish
lad of 12 years, was the first, to come to
America. He was the father of David Mc-
Kinley, the great-grandfather of the
President. William McKinley came to
America with James and settled in the
South, where his descendants have been
and are men of distinction. David Mc-
Kinley was a Revolutionary Boldior, one
of the sort not remembered In history, ex
cept under the grand classification of pri
vates.
The mother of William McKinley Sr.
was of equally good and sturdy stock,
being Mary. Rose, who married James Mc-
Kinley the second. She came from Hol-
But she did, for she was one of the girls
of that old school whose girls sil had a
certain charm that ours are in danger of
losing with too much civilization. They
were healthy men and they had no more
idea of what nerves are than has a wcll
poised kitten. They were brave, " for
troublous conditions were not far enough
in the background for them to have fpr
gotten that. They were loyal and con
stant; that was the Ideal of the time. All
these things were entirely true t)f Nancy
Allison, and when William McKinley saw
all these things In addition to the fact
that she was good to look upon he fill
in love with her. *
He did it In the style of those days.
It was not a colloquial style, to cay the
that made them feel all the nearer and
dearer when they traced it out. ;
They used to spend long hours doing
this. | The mother countries were not so
finback in those days but they seemed to
have some relationship to America and
Americans. When young William McKin
leyâfor young he was thenâ came court
ing pretty Mlse Nancy Papa AlliBon made
him give an account not only of himself
but 'of his ancestors for several genera^
tions back.' The account proved entirely
satisfactory. The end was that Miss
Nancy was borne off as has been the
fate of most charming girls before and
since- her time. ' : . â¢
, In New Lisbon the event took place. It
was a pretty and a Jolly wedding,
instinct that she would turn haughtily
away and in all possibility reply to their
advances by saying that her kisses were
now the sole property of the young and
gallant husband at her side. Likewise,
a glance at his stalwart form and proud
brow deterred them from carrying out a
custom that was an old and much-fol
lowed one.
"The congratulations of the friends Of
the young couple were quite beyond reck

most hearty, too, .being not from the lips
alone, but from the heart, for the two

Â«Â» yr RS. WILLIAM McKINLET SR.
f \/| was one of the women who
Y I thought she had a right "to en-
X. ter politics. This sounds ex-
tremely up-to-date. And yet
she wo-ald have been astonished If she
had been offered the ballot. She Is not on
record as having at any time asked for it.
She has always appeared quite ready to
let the men of America do all the voting
that was done, especially since they
showed themfjelves so thoroughly In ac
cordance with her ideas in the matter.
Her part in politics was played for the
most part before ever her son William
eat In the Presidential chair, although he
would tell you that she was of power in
the world political even to her last dayi
and is yet. So long as he holds office she
has her influence, for it is through him
that all her work for the state has done.
Indirect effortâ that Was her idea of the
woman's use In the political field. Through
the men who were near and dear to her
she could reach out and controlâ there is
no telling what What her limitations
were no one shall say. It is up to psy
chologists to determine how much she hat?,
to do with making William McKinley tho
President of the United States.
Mrs. McKinley was the Nancy Campbell
Allison who came of the long line of
Pennsylvania Allisons. They were an en
ergetic race and an industrious. Above
all, their characteristic as a family was
Btlck-to-it^lveness. It was in the line of
family tradition that all of her children
were brought up.
There were nine of -them. The President
to-be waB neither the first nor the last, sc
he had no chance to ; be spoiled. When he
waB a baby the one just before him was
still a baby, too, anil he had to share tha
honors; and just as he w&s about to have
a monopoly on them, along came a glr
and cut him out entirely.
Mrs. McKinley did her best, and her
best wa very good. But 'it Is plain
enough that there was no time to spoil
children in that family.
They have always had big families, tho
McKlnleys, and sturdy ones, too. Bo with
the Allisons. Nancy Allison was the
handsome, well-knit girl whom William
McKinley Sr. married in New Lisbon as
long ago as 1S2T.
The ! Alllsons came from England to Vir
ginia in early days. "In Virginia they
multiplied," says the record.
One branch of them emigrated to Pehn
eylvania In later years. There, in Greene-
County, settled one Abner Allison as long
ago as In revolutionary tlmoB. It came to
pass that he met, loved, wooed and won
a certain Ann Campbell of a Scotch-Ger
man family who were already living in
that county. Later on another emigration
took place. In which these Allisons moved
to Ohio, and there they built them a home
and reared a family of ten sturdy chil
dren. Nancy Campbell Allison was one of
them.
She was never a spoiled child herself.
Perhaps , ! that has something to do with
her sound Ideas on up-bringing. If j'ou
are ' going into that Bort of thing, why,
then, there is fo telling in the wide world
how far/back McKinley' s election to fill
Georce 'Washington's omce may go. Be*
cause nis mother reared him well, because
her mother reared her well, because all of
them were reared wellâ It's as bad as the
house that Jack built.
In the family home at New Lisbon
Nancy Campbell was reared. There she
lived through her little-girl days, very
much as all other little girls do. She
showed a tremendously vigorous constitu
tion, which remained with her all the long
years of her life and which made her a
hale and hearty old lady. .
She was a rcnip as a eirl. It is a- hard
thing to Imagine the stately old lady who
looked as dignified as if her whole b'isi
ness for all her life through had teen the
rearing of Presidents. But romp she was,
as all the records show.
She was a champion tree-climber. 8he
could climb faster and dared climb higher
than a single one of her brothers and
than any boys of the neighborhood, for
that matter. She was a little athlete ftnd
dearly loved all outdoor sport. The story
has been told of her that she never look
a bird's egrg 1 or would accept enÂ© as a
present and that most of her tree-climb
ing was done for the purpose of prevent
ing boys' robberies. She would scale up a
tree like a cat, give a thieving boy a
hearty poke that would perhaps send him
sprawling and elide down and tfive him a
lecture while he was picking himself up.
This tenderness for birds and animals
has always been a marked characteristic
of her and she reared her children with a
regard for dumb creatures constantly be
fore their minds.
As Nancy grew Into her beautiful strong
womanhood along came suitors for her
hand. They were the hardy Kind that
young ladies of that day and the genera*
tlon were blessed with; young pioneers
who had the love of country strong in
their hearts because theirs was a new
country.' V-W
Of them all William McKlnlev was the
only one who In any way touched the
heart of capricious Miss Nancy. For she
was a bit capricious inasmuch as sho was
a girl. She afterward developed Into so
strong and clear-headed a woman that It
seems impossible to think that che ever
played pranks and upset young and un
eettable hearts. . - '
Mra. - McKinley, as most . mothers of
large families, was enabled t.1 . do more
for the children because they were numer
. ous than had she had but one or two. The
danger of being spoiled was obviated, and
the association wltn brothers and sisters
naturally produced a thoughtf ulne*s for
others, a regard for different opinions,
end at the same time helped develop an
ability to care for himself, since In a fam
ily of many members, no matter how har
monious and loving it may be, there is al
ways n. struggle for the supremacy, par
ticularly when there is an inheritance of
aggressiveness.
Mrs. McKinley *was a Christian woman.
She was an ardent Methodist, too devoted (
to her church to admit of any possibility I
of changing It. Her husband was a Pres-J
by terlan by education, but he fell Into the
habit of accompanying his wife to the
church that was home to her. Regularly
on Sunday mornings they used to be seen
going down the street together, the tall,
stately couple who looked enough alike to
bÂ« brother and sister. They were both
distinctly Roman in type, and their llke-j
ness was marked up to their last years
in the strong, intellectual lines of the Ro-(
man face. Mrs. McKinley was an ardent
patriot. Sho willingly offered her son for
racriflee when shÂ« consented to hi3 en- '
taring tho army to help pat down the Te
- feellion when he was not yet 13 years old. '
When you think of how dearly beloved her
children were to her. you can see that this
v:aa no heart'.csstiesa or cold pride, but ,
her Ideal of honor and patriotism assert-'
ing itself over affection for a son. She
always, however, took the greatest pride
in hl3 abilities and his wide reputation,
and It is' probable that she was more re
joiced at his election than was even his
ambitious and devoted wife, for upon her
fell tho arduous responslbilties of tho
White. HouÂ»e duties, and in her delicate
health there was a good deal of dread of
the; undertaking.
Such a mother as McKinley had would
have counted his honor as nothing if it
had been' secured unworthily. Truly hÂ«r
greatest happiness lay In the fact that
he was an honorable man and respected
'by hi!* enemies.
"1 am proud of his achievement," she
said after the election, "but I should not
be If he did not deserve It entirely. That
Is what I am proud of, after allâ his
worth, not Its reward. 1 don't love him
a bit better than I did before. He was
always a dear and devoted son, and he
is the same now. 1 was always proud
of him because ha was good, and 1 am
so now."
The family moved from Falrfleld to
Nlles, where William Jr. was born. , Their
home there was an unpretentious frame
building, a house that was partly dwell
ing and partly store, the dwelling being
very . neat and bright-* good, homelike
place. There . was no* silver spoon In
young William's mouth, although his
parents were comfortably situated. They
were progressing In the slow and sure
Â¦way that pÂ«Â«plfr-dil!geflt # people, that
isâ did. In that time. .
"We kept on and we got ahead," Mr.
McKinley - Used to say. "It was largely
due to Nan. She was always a prop,
and she never let me get discouraged."
She never let anybody that came near
her "set discouraged." She was u
cheery as' the canaries that sang in her
window. Both she and her husbanb,
and most of the family, for that matter,
were the personification of "sound mind
In sound body." They were bota great
wits, and could/ entertain a table of
guests.
There Is a story told of Mrs. McKin
ley's quick wit which lasted through her
whole life. . Not long before her hus
band's death, when both old people wera
In their, seventies, they used to banter
one another as If they were boy- and girl.
William Jr.. sitting In a room ad Join
ins theirs, heard this conversation:
"Nan." said the* old gentleman* "Nan,
I believe that if I were out of the way
this minute you would Imagine that you
could go out and pick up any handsome

"William," retorted the old lady, crisp
ly, "it nevar would -occur to me to im

Nancy Allison, the lively girl and the co
quettish, turned out to be a wonderful
wife- and mother. The girlish traits ma
tured, her virtues crystallized. Her love
and devdtlon. her gentle guidance, her re
ligious Instruction followed her children
everywhere. She, was essentially a do
mestic woman and thÂ« pleasures of her
home life filled ail her tlinÂ© and heart.
It Is said that she and her husband were
never rigorous In discipline, although they
had a model family. They never needed
to be. They were both" people of tremen
dously strong wills, and their children
obeyed Instinctively. In fact, all who
came near them came under the Influence

punishment were unnecessary to. suck par

2A protective tariff to him was far more
than a political theory or a commercial
necessity. It was the protection which
the family as a unit needed against the
outside hungry, aggressive world across
the water.
Thus it was that William McKinley the
younger imbibed his tariff ideas along
with his patriotism and his politics, from
the same source; the source from which
all good, boys and strong men get their
politics â from his father.
The result was a success until the for
ests began to give out and then again

the McKinley Inventiveness was called in
to action and he found that by burning
the stone coal in the same way that wood
was burned /.the resulting carbon,
now known as coke, was a perfect sub
stitute for the wood charcoal. < Still the
prejudices of the Iron buyers could not
be entirely overcome and so for that, pur

tries.
Then, as now, the tariff rates had their
ebbs, and flows. There were high tariff
times and low tariff times, and. with! each
change the young McKinleys got an ob
ject lesson. High ' tariff the household
was prosperous and low - tariff there
were, hard times and privations of all
kinds. More work and less money to
show for it. . .
In time the family moved to Poland,
and later on to Canton. The life In Po
land was important as coming In the
years when young 'William was growing
and developing. There, as well as in
the other towns, the family made 'a deep
impression upon the people of the town.
Mr. Porter says In his volume: , Â¦
"One who knew, Mrs. McKlnley In the
old days at Poland speaks of her quiet
dignity of manner, of her never-failing
watchfulness of the young family and of
herinfluence for â¢good. It was a family
full of sunshine and hope, of self-sacrifice
on ' the : part ' of both . father, and mother
and of filial- devotion on- the part of the
children. It represented a pure American '
home where sound religion and love -of
This devotion' to her friends lasted Mrs.
McKinley to the last year of her life, dur
ing which it was the pleasure of Mr. Jos
eph S. Spear Jr.^and his Â¦wife, who are old
friends of the McKinleys, to meet her and
spend many pleasant days at the Canton
home I of the then President-elect, '.where
his mother was staying. Mr.- Spear tells
of his charming visit to the illustrious old
lady as follows:
strengtn or Tun ana p".rrÂ»i'iÂ» rnax Â¦' Has
been a rich Inheritance to her children."
She was the most sociable woman that
ever lived. At her home of late years, the
one in Canton, she never took a dinner
without at least one guest at table, and
often there werÂ© ; as -many as the table
could by Its biggest stretch accommodate.
She never gave up making calls Â¦ her
self. Every afternoon after the old-fash
ioned noon dinner she would take a nap
â fifteen minutes It always lasted, as pre
cisely as if there were ' some brain clock
to announce the time. Then she arose aa
fresh and bright as a girl, put on her best
bib and tucker and went out'' to' make
calls. Nothing but a storm or trouble
at home ever kept her from this hour or
two with her friends.
the facts, which the tariff framer formed,
that has always enabled ' him. to Invest
such an apparently dry subject with the
Interest which he knows how to throw
. Into it.
Around the home of William McKlnley
there was always a mixture of three In
dustries, for they, were in the midst of
the great farming and coal belt as well
as the smelting. The father was a man
who could not only work and plan, but
he was a logician arid kept his wits
sharpened by continual reading of the
heavy authors of past centuries.
There were tariff arguments then as
now, and, of course, much more acrimo
nious, as less was known by both parties.
The farmers who surrounded the mining
and manufacturing towns closely on every
side could not as a rule easily be brought
to see why it was that they should be .
.made to pay ' more for their tools than
those same tools could â¢ be bought for
abroad. It was true," they noticed, that
when the tariff was Â¦ reduced and 'the
mines and . furnaces closed JoWn, that
there was no chance for them to sell their
garden truck, even If \ they could- buy the ,
hoes ; with which to cultivate it for a few
cents less each.
The miners, too. thought more of being
able to get cheap tools wtien they worked
than to be always sure- of having work.
As sons of the iron founder, the young
McKinleys were always being twitted by
their comrades whose fathers were in
agricultural or mining occupations. The
result was that all of the boy's were con
tinually in the midst-of a .tariff .war,
which was a valuable â¢ training for them.
To a boy his father Is always ; right, and
in their defense of their father tnev. were
priming themselves for the future defense
of their nation in which all of tha sons of
William McKinley Sr. have loined with
their strength whenever has arisen the
country 'were inculcated from childhood.
It was typical of those homes .which turn
out the best and" most useful . citizens of
the republic. Hear what this friend says:
"Many of McKinley's good â¢ qualities,
both of heart and mind, were due to his
mother. I recall her quiet dignity of man
ner. She was just the same in the midst
of commonplace duties as in a palace if
she had been reigning there. All her old
friends, and neighbors of ' Poland who
speak of her agree to this. . Her charac
ter, for all that is commendable In . a
woman's sphere, stands pre-eminent here
In church and in the hearts of her friends
âshe had that blending of sweetness and
line, but like all pioneers he was lacking
in experience and was working feu* the
benefit of others who came after him.'
The ores of Michigan were at that time
too rich and thick with iron to be worked
by themselves, and they would clog the
furnaces with masses which would adhere
together, exclude the intermlxer fuel and
so gradually cocl and form great ingots in
the furnace which could not be got rid
of except by rebuilding.
A new furnace was started on a canal in
Ohio which connected with the interior
river system, and also with the lake. To
this place were brought the too low grade
ores of Pennsylvania and the too high
There Is enough of evidence in the fact
of McKinley's pertinacious j fight for the
tariff, when all tiie rest of the Republican
party wished to give it up, : to show that
it must have been born in him. And not
only that, but what was born in the bone
was strengthened in the it bringing up.
There were short, rations fi the' McKin
ley family when their furnaces had to sell
iron for a dollar a ton less than it cost
them to make It in order to meet English
competition and not forever lose their
trade. It was a patriotic duty that main
tained them in a sometimes apparently
hopeless contest. â¢,..-.
It was this early life acquaintance with
turing iron at New "Wilmington, Pa., Eng
land began a determined effort to under
mine the iron industry of America by de
livering: English Iron at FIttsburg for $1
p?r ton less than the Pennsylvania foun
dries could produce it in their own fur
naces.
There was a clear object lesson In favor
of the people who Eald "Buy In the
cheapest market." But all too fresh in
McKInley's mind was the story which his
grandfather had told him of the troubles
when the homes of Americans were being
burned and riddled with bullets for the
lack of iron to defend them
"Better pay a dollar a ton more, or $10
a ton more," said he, "in time of peace
and preserve the peace than to save the
dollar and be vanquished in a hopeless
war that Is sure to be forced upon the un
prepared.'.'
AH his life Ions the eenior McKinley
| fought for this principle. The result wag
that the efforts of himself and of those
sterling: men of his time put the United
States In a. position that made It invin
cible; gave it a start that has sent it fly
ing: ahead, until now those same Pennsyl-,
vania towns are building- iron bridges for
the British colonies; invading Great Brit
tain itself and there slowly stifling; thÂ«
smoke of the foundries that once nearly
cost this country its national existence.
It was in this atmosphere of tariff, not
for revenue, not for protection of trade
only, but for protection of the very lives
of the people and the Integrity of the Gov
ernment Itself, that William McKinley Sr.
raised his family.
"What could be more apparent to them
than that the folly of buying cheap Iron
during the Bummer of prosperity was like
the policy of the grasshopper who sang
through the summer. In the winter of
war's frowning clouds the busy ant would
say "Go dance."
The Iron smelters of those days had no
such conveniences as are now known, and
much of the work, most of it In fact, was
done by main strength of manual labor.
In all of the processes which were used in
getting metallic Iron from the ore William
McKinley was a leader in advanced meth
ods. In those early days it was not even
supposed that coal could be used for
smelting purposes. "Stone coal" it was
called then by Mr. McKinley as opposed
to the charcoal which he used in his
furnaces. The ore of Pennsylvania was of
a low grade, containing but 30 per cent of
iron and 70 per cent of sand and dross.
The loss in heating and fusing this use
less mass of sand and rock greatly re
duced the profit.
To overcome this Mr. McKinley became
interested in the first company which ever
developed the rich iron ores of Michigan,
which are now supplying half of the metal
of the world. He was a pioneer in that
lived with you for these many years."
Then they both laughed gayly. and
"Good for you. mother," shouted Wil
liam Jr., as he ran to kiss her.
It is perhaps the Impression of most
people who take no Interest In politicsâ of
â¢whom there are unfortunately far too
me nyâ that the devotion of President Me-
KlnJey to the tariff was a matter of com
paratively recent date; that It was taken
up by him as any successful politician
â¢who casts about for a popular wave on
which to ride.
This is as far from the truth as anything
can be. Probably it has seldom before
been realized and perhaps never before
written that the father of the President
was one of the first men in America to
see the necessity for a tariff and he saw
a deeper reason for It than the mere profit
of the day which came to the protected
manufacturer.
It was for this reason Andrew Rose,
above mentioned as grandfather of "Wil
liam Sr., had seen the danger that
threatened America durlns the War of
the Hevolutlon, when the British soldiers
came over, armed with plenty of good
hard metal guns and the poor continental
forces, who had nearly all been farmers,
and had not gone Into iron working, were
forced to fight with such' primitive guns
as they had for killing birds and game.
In order to adapt their arms for warfare
It was necessary to have swords- and
bayenets. There were no foundries ir
the country and but the primitive forges
for farm blacksmithing. The only iron
was in the shape of useful agricultural
Implements.
These were painfully and labTiously
worked by the aid of charcoal fires into
implements of defense. The result is to
be seen to this day in digging over the
old revolutionary battlegrounds. The
American weapons can be told from the
English, old and rust-eaten as they are,
ifor the reason that being only made of
soft Iron instead of good steel, they are
almost Invariably bent and injured. The
American soldiers were not only handi
capped then by the scarcity cf iron, but
by Rs Inferiority. Every one knows -what
the result would have been had the scar
city of iron been greater. Proud, brave

After the war .David ' McKinley settled
in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania-
It was not such a great thing to do, yet
it was the first time hi the history of war
that It had ever been done. And It was
just like McKInley to/do it. A thougnt
fulness for the little comforts of others,
a disregard for the great dangers that
threatened himself.
The way to win a man is to feed the
brute and that little feed won for Sergeant
McKInley '.to a lieutenancy; Â¦

to the position of the officer, and gentle

Not to say that he was not. these things
already. "But every man who enters the
army as a private leaves behind him all
that he has been, and must again work
himself to the top in a new. line of life.
See what another President said of Mc-
Kinley long years before he was Â¦ called
to the Presidential chair.
President Hayes thus tells, the story of
how he helped to effect the promotion of
Sergeant McKinley:
"When : . I became commander of tha
regiment he soon came to ' be on my staff
and remained there for one or two years.
; "From that time he naturally pro
gressed, for his talents and capacity could
not be unknown to the commander of , 'the
army of West Virginia, George Crook.-
He wanted McKinley ' and, of course, it
was my duty to tell McKInley he, must
leave me.
"Later on, coming to Ohio to recover,
from wounds, I called upon Governor Tod
and told him of the incident of young.
Sergeant McKinley risking his life to feed â¢
his brother soldiers.
,"With the emphasis that distinguished '
It is a great test of a boyâ what his own
family thinks of him.
William McKInley was the idol of his
brothers and sisters.
One- of them In particular, the eldest, -
David , McKInley, who was so well known
to San Franciscans as Consul-General of
Hawaii, was laughed at for the adoration
which he paid to his younger brother.
.-More than twenty years ago David Mc-
Kinley prophesied " that his brother Wil
liam would one day be President of the ,
United States.
It has been- fortunate for William Mc-
Kinley that he has had, such an under
standing,' encouraging family. They have
one and all been; firm in their faith In
him, and that must have gone far to give
him faith in himself. .
Before he was seventeen the coming
.'. ' It was a continual struggle between the
growing boy, William, and his family as
to whether he should continue his educa
tion. . Â¦
He declared it, his duty to assist In the
support of the family, while his older
brothers and sisters as " steadfastly In-'
sisted upon doing that and assisting him
to get his education as well, for even at
that time he gave great promise of abil
ity in all local debates and literary con
tests. Â«
Many stragglers had found their way
back to where the commissary was locat
ed. The young 6ergeant pressed them into
duty as cooks and soon had two wagons
loaded with steaming hot coffee and hot
meat sandwiches. Then, securing cne of
the bravest of the stragglers, he led the
way with his wagon and, despite' the
warnings of superior officers, he drove
down through the lines, dodging bullets,
as all men will when they hear the zip
ping close to- their necks. To every man
in his regiment he gave food and drink.
Es was at that time only a boy under
21â a commissary sergeant. The army had
been fighting in the field since before sun

William. McKinley seems to have made
his triumphal entry Into history's blaz

"He stated that, years ago, while Mr.
McKinley was practicing law and before
he had arrived at political prominence, a
dispute arose concerning some mining
property In which Mr. Hanna was Inter

trade of an ' iron worker at the furnace

WILLIAM MC'KINLEY
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
One narrative In particular of Mr.
Spear's Is Interesting, as It explains the
friendship between Mark Hanna and the
President, which has probably been the
cause of more picture drawing, caricatur
ing, paragraphing and speculation than
any other friendship that ever existed. It
Is usually supposed that It began as a
political association, but the reverse is
the case.
"Like others, I was curious to know,"
said Mr. Spear, "how the Intimacy sprang
up, and conversing at one time with Mr.
Hanna, I asked him the question.
"don't drink."
Apparently the principal reason why
there is such an absence In maeazlne and
other current literature of stories of his
early life and boyhood is that he became
early burdened with the responsibilities
of a man. Teaching school at 15, enlisting
shortly after in the army, lie sprang as
with one leap from childhood to manhood,"
from the nursery to the pages of history.
He inherited his father's love of reading
and as a student at Poland was always
' to be found the last one at night to re
tire, and between him and another stu
dent who lived across the street there was
always a rivalry as to who should be the
first to show a light in the morning, for it
was their custom to study at that peace
ful hour, when the mind, refreshed by
sleep and just returned from the dream
voyages, is .capable of comprehensions
and conceptions of which no understand
ing could be had at any other time of the
day. .
During the vacations he was busier fnan
ever, for then he acted as clerk in the
local postoffice and assisted in organizing
the debates on serious questions which
were the delight of the preceding genera
tion.
Those debates probably did more t
moid the young men of the time than nil
of the college education of to-day Is do
ing, fen- they cast the student entirely
upon his own resources, and. what was
best, they put him immediately In the
field of Draclic&l comoetition.
1 San Francisco has' been the home of scv-,
eral members of his family. Two broth
ers. David A. and Janies McKinley, came
here in early days, together with his un
cle, Benjamin F. McKinley, who is now
Asslsiant Postmaster of San Francisco.
The brothers, Janies and David, are botli
dsad, David leaving surviving a daugh
ter, now Mrs. George E. Morse.
Uncle Benjamin McKinley is a familiar
figure on the streets to old San Fran
ciscans, who are always 'pleased to trace
In his keen, merry gray eyes and strong
featurej the characteristic McKinley type
of face which Is so accentuated in the
President. ' - ' .' .,
To the great mass of the young genera
tion he Is incognito, and nothing pleases
i;lm mere than to pass unnoticed on the
Etreet by people who would twist their
neck3 if they knew who wu who.
Another San Franciscan who, wlill* not
a relative, Is an esteemed visitor to the
McKinley. household, either at Canton or
the White House, Is Joseph S. Speir Jr.,
Surveyor of Customs.
From him have been obtained many of
the following stories which he has heard
In the home of the President, from old
friends of his boyhood days, whose talk
would naturally turn upon the host at
any time when he was not Immediately
present. >.
THE transpiration of a great man.
The time when he escapes from se
crecy to notice. The time when the
chicken leaves the shell: when the
traveler on life's road leaves the
broad, well-beaten boulevard which leads
to failure and starts out on the lonesome
trail of difficulties which leads to success.
That Is the interesting point In the life
of any one.
For a man who has been so much in the
public eye. Â¦whose name has become al
most a synonym In our English language
for the phrase, "Protection of American
industries." William McKInley Is a singu
larly unknown person as regards his early
life.
Every ax that Lincoln used for hewing,
every plank he hewed, has been written
up and pictured. Not a child in America
but knows that the flrst path in life which
led Garfield toward prominence was the
towpath of a canal. It is the small things
about great people that serve to connect
them with humanity and to make hu
manity understand and love them.
From the scarcity of anecdotes relating
to the youth of our President one thing is
certain, that he must have led a compara
tively placid early life. He never ran
away from home or chopped down cherry
trees.
He was, by report of all of those who
knew him in his youth, a studious, digni
fied boy of the kind that any one would
expect to see grow up and make a Presi
dent.
The old saying that the good die young
has perhaps come from the fact that
many of them are good simply from inani
tion, lack~of vitality and physical inabil
ity to do wrong. They are good in a nega
tive way in that they do nothing.
Our statesman warrior, when a boy,
was good for none of these reasons. He
had plenty of will and vim and capacity
for a deal of right or wrong either. He
devoted himself seriously and broadly to
1 the good. Not in a narrow, and bigoted
â¢way either. He did not drink, yet he was
no Ironclad teetotaler, and would take a
drink if he wished to, but preferred a
one of General Hayes* regiment* was
. through an oversight left posted like Cas
ablanca, McKInley, then an . aid. rode
through the enemy's zone of fire, hidden
at times by thÂ© smoke of a shell. Pell
-mell be went to give the order without
which the fearless regiment would not re
' treat.
At another time In this same battle h*^
was sent to order a regiment to take a,
new position. It was a post of apparent
danger and the road which led to It was.
worse than the position Itself. The officer*
in command refused to move unless he
had specific orders from the commanding
general as to which road he was to take.
There was no time to be lost. If tha
position was to be occupied It must bÂ«
done at once.
McKInley took upon himself the rlak of
ordering by which route the detachment
should proceed.
The position was taken np accordingly
and a successful termination came about.
The general afterward, said to him: "As
: It was a success you did rightly. If It had
been a failure !'*' ~
Later on in the day he met Sheridan on
his rhyme-famed ride, and Sheridan him
self refers to the name of McKInley In his
memoirs.
Through the long, weary war he served,
always winning: friends, and becoming 1 *o
enamored of the soldier's life that hÂ» de
â¢ sired to follow It. Again, though, he had
the good sense to follow his family's
counsels and returned to his law studies,
entering the office of Judge Charles E.
Glidden at Poland.
This gentleman "was a master of his pro
fession and an orator of ability as well.,
and It Is said by those who have heard
both men that much of the beautifully
sympathetic modulation of McKlnley's
voice was acquired while listening to
Judge Glldden's consolatory addresses
upon the return of the bullet-torn wax- j
rlors and battle-thinned regiments. f
In 'the spring: of 1S6T the young lawyer fl
was admitted to practice at Canton, andp
bade adieu to his old friends at Poland to
go to the former place, then containing a .
population of five or six thousand, to 'open I
his law office.
Here was associated with him his j
younger brother, . Abner McKInley. and
there is still a sign up,on the door of a law
office in the McKInley block In Canton /
which reads: j
â¢v. "W. and A. McKInley, Law Office." /
Eefore he had been two years In Canton .
he had been offered and had accepted the I
Republican nomination for Prosecuting Â£
Attorney.
The county being hopelessly Democratic.
, this was held but lightly as an honor, but
young McKinley took to the stump 'with i
a fury of logic and oratory that won him S
the position by a handsome majority. â¢' Â£
By 1S76 he had won the first place In his E
profession In the town.
In 1871 he was married to the -wife who
las ever since been his constant encour- 5
iger. ' ; J
There must have at all times been a se- .*
cret romantic admiration In his heart for i
California, for when he was first engaged
he sent to his sister-in-law, Mrs. David *
McKinley, then living In San Francisco,
.and had her buy a wedding ring of Call- j
fornia gold with which to seal his be- v
trothalâ a small ring, a ruby set round
with diamonds.
Apropos of this, another story Illustrat
ing his brother David's admiration.
. Shortly after the engagement ring pur
chase and before "William's marriage
there was born to David a cu,te little roly
poly native daughter. David, brimful of
the love and devotion to his brother, per-P
. hops with a prophetic eye to that broth-^
er"s greatness, insisted upon naming the /
little daughter Ida : McKInley, Ida being
the flrst name of the future President's
betrothed. t /
To this day the President has not for-V
prtten the compliment, and a visit to A
which he will look forward with pleasure V
is that to his niece, now Mrs. Ida Me- j
Kinley Morse, and her witching six-year- â¢
old daughter, Marjorie McKInley Morse, y
In their home that fronts the park. 7
The history of the statesman after he I
became such is a part of the history of the *
country. It 13 easy to follow the path
when once it has been found, but the find-
Ins: it. ; Oh,' that seeking for the royal road
that leads to fame! I
See where McKInley found It. ' Â¦Â¦ Â¦. ~] '
Do you see? '
Right i In . his own .home, among his *
brothers and sisters, he began his upward
course; got his footing. By kindness, by
.diligence, by filial respect. '
Among his . schoolmates, by earnest
"work In his studies, by vanquishing them
in good-natured debate.
Â¦ Among his war mates on tha field of
battle, when as a boy officer he risked his
life that they might drink hot coffee.
Among the other lawyers at the bar and
among clients . and opponents when he
fought opponents so fiercely as to win,
cases for his clients, yet handled oppo
nents so gently withal that he won them,
too. as he did Hanna.
â¢ Those faraway little things; way back
In the unheard of village of Poland, wher
ever In Ohio it may be; those small gen- "
tlenesses and strong efforts to do well In
small things. The gentle stroklngs of an
old mother's head; the kindly offered cup
to â¢ the choking soldier. '.Those were the
steps that took William McKInley out , of
the broad boulevard which 99 per cent of
us. are traveling toward the great eternal
failure, and* put him on the lonesome
.trail that led to success.

wisely and well.
"She possesses cool-headed judiciousness
regarding the world, but. this knowledge

perfunctory. For twenty-five years the

President and his wife dearly love every
picture on its walls and every rose that
climbs the terrace. .
"Mrs. McKinley is the most popular
woman there to-day. No honors of state
or nation's capital have spoiled her. She
is just as gracious to some old beaux
whose lives have come to nothing as she
is to an Illustrious executive. - .1

to be clever you are convinced of the
cleverness of the one who does so. So
people go away from her with a snug,
. comfortable conviction about the region
of the heart that they have proved them
selves most entertaining persons. It la
a wonderful gift, but no one would laugh'
more at a suggestion of her possession o* i
It than would Mrs. McKinley. 'But, I am
really so Interested,' she would say.
"She does a deal of newspaper reading |

for she has one advantage that time Â¦

MRS. WILLIAM MC'KINLEY
WIFE OF THE PRESIDENT.
IT was In the latter part of the sixties
that the Canton people living along
Market street used to watch the light
of a very high cigar tracing its late
way from the Saxton houseâ the bis
house on the corner of Ninth street. As
the weeks wore on, this cigar light ac
quired a habit of retracing its way to
ward the Saxton house, and it sometimes
did this more than once.
Gossip spread it abroad that it was the
i cigar of young Major McKinley. Gossip
likewise added that he was courting Miss
Ida up at the big house and that he -went
back every evening for another good
night and sometimes for more than one.
The major was very much in love, people
reported. Itf'x
He has never been known to deny the
fact, from that day to this. If you ask
him about it, he will ask you why he
shouldn't be in love with her? Note, not
why he should not have been, but why he
should not be. He is quite as seriously in
love to-day as he was in the sixties and
he is auite as fond as over of recalling
with her the days when they first became
acquainted up at Meyers Lake.
It seems that this was a small lake
I about two miles' from Cantonâ the favorite
resort thereabouts for picnic parties and
boating. After the Civil War McKinley
returned to his Canton home with the
title of major, and he was lionized in a
way that would have turned the head of
a lesser lion. He was the hero of the
hour, and countless parties were made up
in which he played the leading man's
part-
Day after day there were excursions to
Meyers Lake. The most popular young
lady of Canton and of all these parties
was Miss Ida Saxton, the oldest daughter
of the banker.
The major's first impression of Miss
Saxton was gained at a chicken and waffle
supper, for which the old hotel at the
lake was famous throughout several coun
1 ties. He was particularly delighted with
! the fact that she ate chicken and waffles
as if^he had a healthy appetite, instead
of affecting the live-on -air style that was
the raging fad with young ladies at that
particular period. From that moment on
his admiration grew and she on her part
held a marked admiration for the brave
j and handsome young major.
) They used to row together on the little
lake. They were head and front of .all
) the merry-making that the young people
were carrying on, and they found time for
. tete-a-tetes as well. Then, in the midst of
' all this, came the dreaded timeâ the time
when the young major's duty called and
he was obliged to leave his Canton home
for the long and tiresome law study in
Albany. . . ..
i It was not until 1S57 that he returned to
| Canton. In the meantime Miss Saxton
had been as busy as he. ., .... ,
It would never have been a possible
thing for her to be idle. Even of late
years, while invalidism has been hers to
endure, she has been busy. When she
could not leave her chair, her fingers were
flying with the crochet needle that wove
the thousands of baby shoes that have
gone to smaller invalids all over the coun
try-
As a girl she was busy, whether at
work or at play. In the first place she
went to boarding-school at Miss San
ford's, In Cleveland, and later on at Miss
Eastman's, in Media, Pa. In both of
these schools she left the stamp of her
personality. That is what she does every
where. She led the other girls in their
enterprises, sometimes mischievous ones.
, and her quickness kept her at the head
| of her classes, while she spent less time
in study than any of the others. One
thing is always recorded of her by all
those who knew her; she never said un
kind things of any one. She seems to
have been too big to bother with any
petty acts.
Miss Eastman, the principal of the
school, lived for long years after that
time; long enough to tell many a story
of her favorite pupil. She said that Ida
Saxton was the one girl in her school
who ever caused her to break her rule
against favoritism. She believed that It
was unfair on a teachers- part and she
fought persistently against it, but Ida
Saxton was too much for her. "Â¦ She
couldn't help loving her better than shÂ«
loved any of the others, and in her feai
of showing this she was more severe with
her than any other.
Probably Ida saw through this feigned
severity. At any rate, she responded
most heartily to her teacher's affection,
and afterward, when she became the dis
tinguished Mrs. McKinley and with her
distinguished husband visited now and
then in Philadelphia, ehe always sent a
letter out to Brooke Hall, as the school
â¢was called, inviting: Miss Eastman to
dine with them.
Mr. Saxton was a wealthy man and a
devoted father, and he lavished upon his
daughter every pleasure and accomplish
ment that was to be had. After her ex
cellent education in this country she went
abroad and made a long and extended
tour over Europe with her sisteri She
did not return until 1869.
Then, after all these, years of fashion
able education, she did a most unexpect
ed and unconventional thing. She turned
bank cashier. Canton found cause for
gossip in that fact, but Miss Saxton's
serene bearing and her popularity were
of a nature to wither gossip. Were the
;famlly funds giving out? gossip- at first

MA B JOB IE McKINLEY
MORSE, a six-year-old San
Franciscan, has held the
honor of being called the Baby of
the White House.
This is an honor seldom permitted
one baby to hold alone. During' the
Presidency of Harrison his grand
children, the little McKees, divided
" the honors between them. Rutli Cleve
> ]and had things all her own way for
a while â but it was a very short
. -while. In popped Baby Esther, and
then the honors had to be shared.
And so it has nearly always been.
Presidents seem, to have big families.
But during the time that Miss
Marjorie Morse was there, enthroned
in the heart of "Uncle "William," ska
was sole ruler. She is his grandniece,
by right of being the daughter of Ida
McXinley Morse, -who in her turn is
the daughter of David McKinley. He
was "William McKinley's brother,
the oldest son of William McKinley
Sr. This makes Marjorie's great
grandparents identical with the pres
ident's parents, and that is the whole
thing 1 , you know, about being a
granSniece.
There is a very big and a verj
warm, spot in the hearts of both Pres
ident and Mrs. McKinley for all the .
]:ttle people in Americaâ or in the
whole world over, for the matter of
that. And when one of thess little
people happens to be a girl the spct
seems to gxow even warmer and big
ger than before. For the two graves
that sadden their hearts are the
graves of tieir wee daughters.
Ida was the first one to come into
their home and hearts. She came ou
Christmas day in the year 1871 and
it is said by those who saw her that
.she seemed more like a Christmas
angel, come to earth for only a little
while, than like a real child of this
earth, dry-as-dust old place that it is.
Somehow, those who saw her could
never quite believe that she was
| meant to be kept here, frail thing that
, she was. Perhaps it was no surprise
'? even to her parents when she was
? taken from them, but the grief of it
Â¦was something from which, the
mother never recovered.
.Not long following this death tha
other little daughter passed away.
She was Katie, a more vigorous child,
and one in whom the hopes of all
those who loved her centered. Sha
had almost reached four proud years.
' She was growing stronger and mer
rier every day. She was already mak
' ing her own small place in society,
Laving her little friends who came to
j see her and whose calls she returned
â¢with the delight in sociability that
came to her a direct heritage from
< both parents. She was full of all
lrvely childish, interests â in her dolls,
in her games, in her pets. Life was
; brightening already for her saddened
1 parents when suddenly came the blow
1 of her death.
Jrom these griefs Mrs. McKinley
has never recovered. The shock of the
second child's death, enfeebled her so
that all of her family's care now cen
tered in her suffering. The major
took her away from the home -where
all this trouble had come upon her
and to the cheery old homestead
Â¦where she had lived as a girl. But
she has never been able to heal the
great grief of her losses.
All this snows why Marjorie Morse,
that flower-like little lady, has so
firm a place in those two bereaved
hearts. Perhaps as "Aunt Ida" cud
dles her close sometimes she fancies
for the moment that it is one of those
little wanderers that she loved come
back again. Perhaps "TJncle William"
can pick her up and place her in state
. upon his knee and remember with the
{kind of sadness that is partly sweet
> how he , used to enthrone there an
1 other small queen of hearts.
There is room in the McKinleys'
affections for as many children as the
world can hold, but it is no more than
natural that " 'Marjorie should be
ranked among' the first. For. she is
really a niece, and besides â well, she
is Marjorie.
' She was three years old when she
last visited at the White House. There
Â¦was nobody else but grown people in
the whole great place, and she held
full sway from end to end* Her
moods and caprices, as many as there
are breezes in May, were authority.
Every morning when Mrs. McKin
ley took her drive Harjorie went along
and cluttered to Aunt Ida as fast
and as merrily as the sparrows on
| a. jolly day. Every afternoon, just
after lunch, -when TJncle William took
a half -hour for recreation, she would
climb to his knee and tell him the
most wonderful stories that ever were
told about bears in the woods and
giants in the castles.
The last time that a family party
visited the White Souse Marjorie was
left behind. Because' of a misunder
standing the President and his wife
expected her, and -when, after a long
delay, the party arrived, the two were
still up, contrary to their rule of early
to bed.
''Where's MarjorieP" they clam
ored on the instant.
When it was explained that she
was not of the party their disappoint
ment almost overruled their polite
ness. Of course they were glad to se^
the other people â but they had stayed
up two long hours for Marjorie.
WHEN I came upon Marjorie she
was sojourning in Los Gatos.
This was for the sake of her
health. She informed meVthat
Ebe was trying her best to re
gain strength after a Blight indisposition,
"I guess he will!" m reproachful indig
nation.
"And how about Aunt Ida?"
"Oh, I Just want to see her. I guess I
do. I love Aunt Ida. If, it hadn't been
for driving with her and playing with her
I'd have been so lonesome in the White
House! I wouldn't have had anything to
do but sit around and lick my paws.
'Cept just a little while every day when
Uncle William talked to me and 'cept
when Junior Hobart took me out driving.
Junior Hobart was the Vice President's
son." .
A President is to Marjorie a very mat
ter-of-fact although a much-beloved per
sonâhe Is merely an uncle. But a Vice
President â she recalls the drives : with
Junior Hobart with considerable of a flut
ter."' When she flutters she does it all
over, from the fluff of tawny-gold curls
beneath a huge beruffled hat, all the way
him, not Knowing his name.
"Let's give him a nameâ what?" Â»sa!d I.
"I like him so we'll. name him McKin
ley," said she proudly.
And in the scattering drops of an April
shower he was christened. "~ '
Then she seized the whip, seized the
reins, seized everything in sight, hearts
included, and with a ringing laugh and a
ringing "Get up," she drove, the horse,
poor old Jog-trot of a beast that he was,
till he raced madly down the street
where he had never before gone- at more
than a mild trot. '
"Get up!" she shouted, leaning forward
where she stood to whip him. She drove
with the fury of a Roman charioteer, and
the horse, with the wool '. thoroughly
pulled over his old eyes by, this time,
shouted back a jolly "Neigh" : to' her, and
pranced delightedly. He could no" more
resist; the command of his scarlet-
you are going to vote for McKinley," sne
would say to every man, woman or child
who entered her door, without Â» regard to
the part that age and sex play : in the
matter, and she said it "with the easy
sureness that is hardest to deny. .
Marjorie's time spent In . "Washington
was very much with grown people, so
Junior Hobart appears to ' have made a
deep impression upon her as being the
only child of .'her Washington circle.
"Junior had two Shetland ponies," she
told me, "and a little cart."
"And- "
Â¦"And he came and Invited me to g-o
driving with him nearly every day, I
"think, and I did.; Hurry up,~Mckinley!"
\ "Was. Junior ' Hobart -a little 1 boy?"
.-* "No, he". was; a big boyâ about 10, years
old, I think.' He .was big enough to drive,
but they always sent a man along with
him to look out for the ponies. My, they
mmseir stiu more so wnen no haa the
young lady of the White -House beside
him, and 'such a young lady. Her rib
bons and laces, her moods and her whims,
were all alike bewildering and bewitching
and Junior counted himself a lucky dog.
"And you should have seen the flowers
he used to 'send her," Minnie said. 7 Minnie
has tied ribbons and dressed' hair for Mar
jorie these five years.
""Weren't they pretty flowers,' Marjorie?"
"U-m-m-m, weren't they!", ,
Marjorie and her maid went into an ec
stasy of . reminiscence over the flowers.
Junior was bidding for '^solidity when he
sent them, for the young lady is fonder
of them than of . anything else, not ex
cepting; a' French doll ;that ! says- "Com
ment-vous portez-vous" and a^, gramo
phone that plays "Where. is My .Wander
ing Boy To-night?"
' "When she tells stories of her Washlng-
ton life, first and foremost Â«hÂ» reckons
the eÂ«f rolling. It waÂ» the event of her
career and she will never forget it en
tirely, no matter how far back It may
stow to be.
' "The children roll eggs on the grass and
they exchange with each other." Â»he ra- -
late*.
On the Easter morning when she was
present at 'the egg rolling 1 she saw It from (
the Inside of the White House. All other <
"Washington children had to content them
selves with the outside point of view. Ac- V
cording to her Ideas, they had the best\
of the bargain, and she vociferously de
manded leave to join them. L
Her Uncle "William had carried her to
the window to watch the sport. There I
below them were dozens and scores and
hundreds of little folks frolicking and run
ning and scrambling In pursuit of the
eggs, and tumbling over each â¢
other, romping and pushing, and all in a
tumult of laughter and good temper.
Marjorie's curiosity was keen. She ask
ed twenty-five questions to the minute
all about who the children were, and
where they came from, and why they
came, and where they. got their eggs, and
what all those policemen were doing on
the lawn.''
She learned that they were all the chil
dren In the city who were able to walk
or drive to the groundsâ poor children and
rich, those who had maids like Minnie tÂ»
look after them and take good care of
them, and those who had nobody to look
after them, but had to play nurse them
selves to smaller brothers and sisters.
' "That's one of the poor little children.
I think," she said, pointing out a small
pickaninny who was rolling herself and
her calico-dyed eggs vigorously on the
grass. And "that's a poor one," and
"that's a rich one." and "see tha poor lit
tle lame girl," and so on until she had in
spected and passed upon every one in
Bight.
"Closer, take me closer to the window,"
She begged.
They tried to hold her back to talk.
They told her old-time stores of the egg
rolling and of the days when it took place J
on the capitol grounds. They pointed outf
the worldly wise youngsters who. were ]J
gambling, and explained how they wereW
"pecking eggs" and winning on tfe hard \
ones. Her attention was held for a few
minutes by the revelation of how some
very dishonest boys used china eggs or
shells filled with plaster of paris and pre
tended that they were like other eggs, and Â¦
so won more than they were entitled to. I
But all the time she was wriggling to go,
and finally the President gave In, tossed^
her to his shoulder and stepped out on the J
veranda. . ft
On the Instant there was a shout ItÂ£
came from hundreds and 'thousands of
small throats below on the terrace. The ;
President and the baby of the White Â£
House had appeared and a welcome to
them went up from every youngster in
sight. ;/-.C'- >
Marjorie nodded and smiled and waved
her hand. .But that was .not enough, j
They wanted her, they called for her, they ff
clamored .for. her, and she wanted to go.%
In the 'end it came out as It usually has t
to when Marjorie wants something. She
had her way. . ' - Â¦*,'-'
Down she went, such a mite oft dainty (
thing as she was, into the midst of the Y
democracy. The populace on the terrace t
set up another shout as she approached.
For a moment they waited as if for her (
to join them. Then their eagerness broke
loose and with one tremendous lunge they
mobbed her.
It took two policemen to rescue her.
breathless and disheveled, from the crush I
of their loyalty, and even then she didn't
want to ~ come. It was -with a. tear that
tried to wink itself out of sight that she
returned to safety inside the house.
"P'raps I'll be big enough next time to
stay," is how she consoles herself.
Marjorie's attendance at a Cabinet
meeting Is ' part of "White House history-
It happened before the war, when all
America was waiting for the decision f
and when the powers that be were con-V
ferring days and tossing nights with the j
weight of thousands of lives and their
offering-up hanging upon tneir decision.
The Cabinet met one fateful morning
in the dreaded chamber. Marjorie had
been taught what this room wasâ It was
t~e room where Uncle William went
wnen he had Important business to at
tend to, and no little girl could ever
think of such a thing as crossing Its j
threshold, even for the joy of seeing 1
Uncle "William. "When he was in there i
he didn't have time to talk to little girls j
as <he had In his idle half-hour after!
breakfast.
There Is a likelihood that this was tha
very reason why the little girl wanted to
go. It was the same way with the family
of children whose mother told them not
to swallow any Ink while she was away
It had never occurred to them before, but
they were delighted when she put the
idea into their heads.
So on a very important morning, during 1 1
a very Important meeting. Slarjorie
slipped away somehow, nobody can ever
guess how, and made for the forbidden
and forbidding door.
The President's head was bowed In
â¢thought. The secretaries were about him.
likewise deep in thought. Should it be
war, or should it not?
Then of a sudden the door swung open
and a dazzling, stream of sunlight fell
upon the gloom of the room. And in the
light stood a radiant little presence, as
white as earthly things seldom We, and
the halo that she. had was a wealth of
shining hair.
She stood, there very still. She had
meant to scamper to Uncle William, but
everybody looked so solemn that she was
afraid to.
It was the President who spoke first.
"Here comes a ray of sunshine to us." he
said. \ n
The sudden presence and the words
came like an Inspiration to the troubled
men. Somebody picked her up and set
her down in the midst of the meeting.
"She may be an omen of good," they all
agreed, and the superstition of the thing
clung to. them all through the anxious

Of McKinley's immediate predecessor
Mr. Harrison was the greatest ' traveler,
although nearly all: the long Journeys he
made were during the time. of his candi
dacy, and not after he had attained his
goal.
President Cleveland was busy declining
invitations to visit various sections of the
country, because 'Â¦ traveling was exceed

office ho never traveled "in state,',' so to
speak, and his longest trips were to St.
Augustine, Fla., and to the Adirondack

On these latter trips Mr. Cleveland
usually went "incog."â that is, the people â¢

Henry Harrison, the hero of Tippccanoe
and the grandfather of another President,
Benjamin Harriso.n. William Henry was
the fighting kind of a lad, too, and when
he was given command of some troops to
chase the Indians, he knew how to do the
work and do it well. Used to the priva
tions of the backwoods settlements Har
rison had also studied carefully the ways
of the wily Indian and knew his fighting
tactics. At Tippecanoe, July Â£7, 1811,: he
severely defeated a great army of the
savages and ended their depredations in
that section of the country. At this bat
tle Harrison fought like one of the men
and two bullets passed through the rim
of his hat.
The second President Harrison found
also the inspiration of his boyhood and
early manhood among primitive surround
ings. Nor did he ever outgrown. the love
of the forests, of hunting and of fishing.
Like McKinley, he was born in Ohio, and
Just ten years earlier 'â¢than the present
chief executive. His surroundings were
Thinking constantly perhaps of his own
early struggles, the President has ever
felt a keen interest in the welfare of boys
and young men. He is always pleased to
, meet them, whether at the White House,
' in his Canton home or upon his journey
f ings throughout the country. "It is the
young man wno is the pillar of our na
tion," lie has often said, "whether he be
born in the backwoods surrounded by the
uncouth, the rough or lowly, or whether
in the lap of luxury and art; it is the
young man of to-day, of sturdy American
character and mold, to whom the country
must look for the stability and character
' of to-morrow."
Just as the youth of the country to-day
* has before the eyes of his ambition the
splendid example in the person and char
| acter of the President to nerve him on to
harder knocks and greater attainments,
L so had William McKinley spread out be
fore him the story of great men who at
tained their highest ideal from the most
humble surroundings.
| It is said that in the President's youth
he was a great admirer of that sturdy old
American of early days, Andrew Jackson.
Perhaps, indeed, he saw in "Old Hickory"
a likeness of himself, and perhaps, too, he
early formed an ambition to attain, like
his hero, the most lofty post in the gift of
the people.
Strictly speaking-, Andrew JacKson was
the first of the frontier Presidentsâ the
first boy to make his way from the log
cabin of the forests to the executive man
sion of the nation. When the eld Liberty
bell in Philadelphia first rung out in dec
laration of independence Jackson was but
9 years of age. His mother died in the
midst of the revolution and little "Andy"
â though not small by any means for his
age â received many a hard knock at the
hards of distant relatives and guardians
before he was 15. This treatment didn't
| do him a bit of harm, as he afterward
said, but rather prepared him for ; the
harder knocks which were in store for
him. He was more of a thinker than a
"book scholar," and his lack of the "book
larnin' " caused him many embarrass
' ments In later life. His spelling 1 was
something to be wondered at and it caused
more than one tilt between "Old Hick
ory," after he became President, and his
' private secretary.
| Private secretaries were not In those
i days what they are now â expert steno
graphers, etc., etc., with many as
sistants. But rather were they more in
the nature of clerks or messenger boys.
The President would write most of the
letters and the private secretary would
read them over, punctuate wherever nec
essary, seal them and mail: One day,
when "Old Hickory" was in a particular
ly angry mood, he rushed to his desk
and as hurriedly as was possible with
him scribbled off a letter to a political
opponent who was the cause of his an
ger. Giving the letter to his secretary he
began to pace the floor of the office. The
writing was fearful; the spelling worse.
The secretary, not wishing to see such a
letter leave the White House, spoke to
Jackson about Its defects, without refer
ring to the spelling, a tender point with
the President. But the latter wanted the
letter to go just as it was written. Fin
ally, as a last hope, the secretary said:
"The writing is not only bad and illegi
ble, Mr. President, but the spelling is of
the worst."
"I don't care," replied Jackson, glaring
furiouslyâ "that fellow will understand
what I mean!"
Jackson won lasting fame at New Or
leansâ"the battle of the cotton bales"â
where with a small body of riflemen,
armed with the old. flint lock, he slew 7000
of the British enemy, and almost annihl

Polk and Johnson were also products of

Mecklenburg, N.C., where the local peo
pie first defied Great Britain in the Meck

harmless document. He emigrated to
Tennessee and shared with Jackson all the^
privations of the pioneer. Andrew John
son was also born in North Carolina. His
parents were very poor and before he was!)
13 years of age he had shouldered his ax
and began earning his livelihood In the I

of education were denied him until long
after he had attained his majority.

is surely the "home of log cabin boys'"

native land and leveled road3 for them

House is located. Besides thosa already
mentioned who came from that great
State there are Grant and Hayes, both
soldiers, statesmen and Presidents. Gen
eral Grant was reared on an Ohio farm,
and foorn into a family the lot of whosa ,
members was abiding toil. His birth was
during the administration of Monroe, and
his patriotism was fixed by the then re

displayed exceptional ability' and brav

now he will undoubtedly have the

Â«V< t last the American Publishers'
f I Association and the American
fâ I Booksellers' Association have come
V, I to a sensible conclusion. Their
Jl plan went into operation on the
1st day of May, and deserves the hearty
co-operation of all readers and book
lovers.
Their idea is to take bock-selling out of
the "bargain counter" business; to estab
lish a rate en every copyrighted publica
tion on a living basis for the publisher
and a buying basis for the reader; and
to enable every book-buyer to purchase
of the local dealer in his own town any
net book in the market at as low a price
as it can be procured from the largcs:
city stores.
It has taken years to consummate
this plan, but at last it has been brought
to a successful issue..
The American public from time im
memorial has been seeking .for "some
thing for nothing." It has become ,so
imbued with this mcttcâ and. it must be
said, especially the fair sex of the public â
that the barg?.5n counter and 7S-cent and
SI 27 sales have become the watchword
for funny writers in the joke columns.
Even the humorist has discovered that
the "bargain" lover pays dear for his
"bargain" in the long run. '.'V.;'
lit requires very little thought to figure
out that this is all wrong.
No man is in business for his health â
unless possibly a consumptive orange
grower in a southern climeâ therefore no
man can afford to give away "something
for nothing."
You may think that by buying some
thing for 39 cents at one place ycu are
growing rich; but somebody has to help
pay the clerk salaries and rent, and if
you do not, Â¦why, the ' other customer
must siand the expense. . â¢
Of course, it is very easy to say, "Well,
let the other customer pay it." But you
will find a little later that you are bound
to come under the head of "the other
customer" at some time and have tc do
a little paying yourself. , f Â¦ <
The cut rates of the past years In book
selling have been alike disastrous for
bookseller and customer. It not only
meant the gradual but sure death of the
good book store, but it meant that while'
you might get certain editions at an ap
parently , lower figure, ycu would have
to pay the difference on some other book.
Such a system as that, being no system
at all, could only bring disaster.
It left the market uncertain for tho
buyer; it discouraged the bookseller who
was obliged to ask for more margin
from the publisher, wTio in turn was
obliged to take away from the profits of
the authorâ and there you are, right back
to the reader again, for if the author
cannot sell his wares he wll! not write,
and the reader Is the loser.
Cheap rates cannot bring good quality,
and a system of cutting trade always re
sults In the best producers becoming dis
couraged.
This new plan of the publishers and
booksellers, however, is. not to arbitrar
ily raise the p^ice on all books to the
detriment of the buyers' pockets, but
merely to establish a price at a living
margin on each copyrighted workâ a price
set once and for all at "net" and then
adhered to.
Here Is the gist of the matter as set
forth in a little circular which is being
circulated by the American Booksellers'
Association amons readers:
In accordance with the mutual agreement
recently entered Into by the members of the
American Publishers' Association, there will
be a general reduction In the â¢ price of books
published under the NET system, and no dis
count will be allowed from the advertised
price of new copyrighted "net books" publish
ed after Slay 1. The wisdom of this beneficent
measure will be apparent # to all after a brief
consideration of the facts.
* 1. The new "net price" will be absolutely
maintained to all customers, eo that the "net
book" of real worth will have a recognized
permanent value, after you nave . read it and
placed It la your library.
2. When you purchase a new "net book" you
will no longer be tempted to spend time and
money "shopping around" in order to get It
at the lowest market price.
3. Hereafter, in ordering a "net book" from
your dealer, you will have th? assurance that
you are purchasing it at the lowest price tor
which it can be manufactured and sold with
a living profit for author, publisher and dealer,
and that no one else can purchase it for less
money than you are paying for it.
Under recent conditions, the Jl 50 novel has
been retailed at all sorts of prices, ranging
-from Jl 50 to 78 cents. In tie first case a
rood profit was made, except by dealers In
the far West and Southwest, where trans
portation charges are very heavy; but every
person who sold this book for"^ cents incur
red an actual loss on each volume, as It is im
possible to wholesale, even In very large
quantities, a $1 SO book .at 73 cents. The
money lost by those merchants who advertised
popular books at such astonishingly low
prices, was charged "to advertising account,"
and It was thought by them that the, money
actually lost In selling books for less than
cost was well Invested, as It created the Im
pression on the part of, their customers that
all goods In their stoics were sold at corre
epondlngly low prices, which obviously was
not true.
Another development, under recent condi
tions, has been the formation of "home library
associations" and other mall order agencies,
for the avowed purpose of supplying: books at

roundirg end Or^r mn.-tion' of the
ID. A. E. sndD. Societies.
Surprising revelation- ns .o the cause
cf the separation of tho Diu 'liters of the
rievcHition from the Daughters of the
American Revolution Â¦ are made in Â¦ tha
hislrry of the societies, just published by
their Flora Adams Darling.- Ths
book makes clear the distinction between
these two patriotic societies which are so
closely alj.ied in name, but which have
maintained' distinct organizations for the
past nine years. It explains that the dis
ruption resulted from a clique of woman's
rights advocates converting the_D. A. R.
into an order accepting members who
wer-j merely collateral kinswomen of 're
volutionary r>atriots. The collaterar ele
ment consisted of members who belonged
to a "Woman's Risrhts Club, known as^the
WI-MO-DAUGH-SIS, located in Washing
ton, D. c. Â¦ Â¦ j
Mrs Darling's history recalls the 'jwar"
of the daughters that was waged with
such intensity during 1SD0-91; and presents
the hitherto suppressed officially attested
records cf the first two years of the or
ganization of the societies. To confirm
the statements made in the book the
author has caused all 'important Iettcr3,
documents and papers to be reproduced
in fac-simi!e. Mrs. Darling offers her
history to the i daughters as~ a proof that
"the records of the D. A. R. have been
altered to cover the false story of the
founding which the board of managers of
1S91 set up, and which has since been per
petuated."
As a story of diplomatic intrigue and
finesse the history is interesting even to
the casual reader. It explains the many
difficulties that had to be overcome in the
effort to unite the two extremes of society
lustrated. and i3 me -which we can rec
ommend to primary teachers .is timely and
serviceable. (Published by the American
Bcok Company, New York. Price 50c.)
Thus rr.any purchasers, to enable themselves
to makÂ« proper selections, have been uslns tho
local bookFtores, without yielding any profit
In return to pay the local merchant for clerk
hire, rent, insurance, trar.srrrtation. and for
the risk of inverting his money in now bio'is
with only a Foseibilitr of BrlHns them. Thi3
has doubtless been done without due Tm
siderationâor under the n?fjral hnpresÂ«loi
that it is one's duty to buy where ho can buv
cheapest. As a matter o' far'., many pur
chasers have raid rroie r-.oi:ey for books
bought, through these agsneics than h â¢
would have been required to ray to local Ccal
ers for the same editions."
This plan canr.ot fail to receive the ccm
menda'tion of the book-reafiing public;
and as the "bargain" cranks are not, as
a general rule, book-lovers, it will make
but little difference to them. It will mean
more encouragement for authors in a
financial way: it will incite publishers to
put forth better editions; and it will en
courage booksellers to keep a larger and
better stock. B. G. LATHROP.
Bird Life.
D. Appleton & Co. of New York
have just published a new edition of that
Interesting book on "Bird Life, a Guide to
the Study of Our Common Birds," by
Frank M. Charman.
Frank Michler Chapman, whose works
on natural historyâ and especially on
birdsâ have given him an international
reputation, was born at Englev/ood, N. J..
in June. 1864. He received an academic
education and since 1SS7 has been connect
ed with the American Museum of Natural
History, being now associate curator of
vertebrate zoology. He was at one time
an enthusiastic sportsman, but within the
last few years has given his attention to
the humane object of conserving bird life,
and has become a leader in the wide
spread movement for the protection cf
birds from destruction for commercial
purposes. He is president of the Lin
naean Society, and a member of the Orni
thologists' Union: he is also editor of
"Bird Lore." He has been a most suc
cessful lecturer on all subjects connect?d
with the study of birds. Bes-des innumer
able articles on birds and mammals, he
has written a valuable "Handbook of ;he
Birds of Eastern North America," "Bird
Studies with a Camera." for the prepara
tion of which he traveled 10.000 miles and
exercised an extraordinary amount of pa
tience and ingenuity: and "Bird Life.'
This book Â»has been recognized as the
standard authority on our common birds.
It was prepared particularly tor those
that desire a general knowledge of bird
life and a speaking acquaintance with cur
common birds. Its value is greatly in
creased by a series of seventy-five pla'es,
representing in their natural colors more
than 100 varieties of birds deDlctei with
loving care by Mr. Ernest Seton-Thoma
son, whose reputation as an animal painl
er and illustrator is second to no other
artist in this country. These plates are
reproduced not by any cheap and unsatis
factory color photography, but by litho
graphy, and are justly regardod as a
triumph of successful iliustra{ions.
The production of this remarkable book
at the low Drice of $2 0'J will be welcomed
by all genuine nature lovers, and will in
sure it a wide circulation.
Kontanya.
"Montanye." by William O. Stodd.ird. is
a work of historical value, although thid
feature does not deiract from its interest
as .fiction.
Montanye is a corruption of Montaigne,
the name of an old New York family who
actually owned the land given them in,
the story. It is now a part of Central
Park and on it was a spring which for
generations bore the name of Montanye's
fountain.
Dr. Montanye himself, with his dark
secret to keep; the Pequot slave with his
flogging to avenge; the privateers, pirates,,
slaves and slave mtrchants are all at
tractive studies, and so Is Madeleine J.>^^,
tanye, the patriot girl living among Brit
ish foes and under the British flag.
While all other American seaports were
feverishly preparing for freedom and
prosperity the city ti New York remained
a British camp. The last months of this
paralyzing occupation are pictured to the
life in Mr. Stoddard'^ fascinating contri
bution to historic.^ romapce. He has
Â¦ treated the topography cf the tale with
his well-known accuracy and has brought
in many rare featuies. The last days of
piracy and the slave- trade pass vividly
before our eyes in connection with the
thrilling incidents of the story.
The book is not only valuable as a care
fully painted historical picture, but it is
a delightfully entertaining romance with
a well-sustained plo^ that holds the read
er's attention to the very last. .
The story is one i.hat has long needed
telling and a better narrator could hardly
be found than Mr. Stoddard. a writer of
known brilliancy, in whose hands history
becomes fascinating romance. Spirited
action, coupled witli the charm of nar
rative and the character drawing that
characterize Mr. Stoddard's work, is fully
displayed in the novel. (Published by
Henry Altemus Company, Philadelphia,

x Hallie Marshall.
"Hallie Marshall." by F. P. Williams, is
the story of a man who, wholly against
his volition, deserts his family. and home.
The people by whom he finds himself sur T ,
rounded seem to have entered into a con
spiracy to efface all traces of the past
from his memory. At first he struggles
against \his, but gradually he yields more
and more to the sweet influences that are
working on himâ the generous Southern
hospitality and the witchery of Hallie,
who strives in many ways to convince him
that his real past is not the past that he
recalls. Finally the picture of his de
serted wife becomes so faint In his mind
that he finds himself making passionate
love to Hallie, on Echo bridge, beneath the
glorious full moon of the South. And, as
he searches the depths of the girl's eyes,
suddenly it seems to him as though he
had passed out of his old life through the
gates of death and has entered into a life
that is free from the disappointments and
sorrows of the old. He renounces his old
allegiances, but before Hallie will accept
his fealty she insists upon a test; she bids
him return to his Northern home and then
choose once for ali between the old life
and Hallie. The reader will find rather a
surprise in the conclusion of the story.

Heading and Composition.
"How to Teach Reading and Composi
tion," by J. J. Burns, M. A., Ph. D., Is a
book designed to help the teacher to pre
pare for the labor of training pupils to
read and to write the English language.
It aids in guiding the student to secure
knowledge and culture from a book; and
in training him to express what he may
know or feel with clearness and grace.
The quotations chosen for study are most
suitable for the purpose: to some notes
are appended, of others, questions are
asked: sometimes both modes are used.
Suggestions are given for the production
of compositions to be based upon the se
lections read. The book is attractively U-
âthe ; rich and the poor, by the hitherto
untriedbond of pedigree. . , ,
In. the history the full story of the early
days of these great and j important patri
otic societies is told. It is the belief of
Mr3. . Darling " that > with this , history : to
aid :. the ' two sister societies In getting at
the bottom of the facts that led to separa
tion they will' find means for a reconcilia
tion. The D. A. R. and the D.' R. have"the
same noble purposes, to foster and extend
the interest of the peopla'in the history of
their , country, and the preservation of his
toric landmarks. That they! are. not -now
working. in unison. is a matter, of keen re
gret to their founder. (Published by. In

The Trophies of Heredia.
This little volume of sonnets seems to
have stepped in from the classic past.
' They are by Jose Maria de Heredia. a
Cuban poet, sen of another Cuban poet
by; the same name. The younger, the one
With Â¦whorrT'.v.-e are concerned, is now 53
years old, and his recently published col
lection shows th;v flame of youth tem-
Aercd by mature nrt.
His. early edrcaion was received at a
Reman Catholic crii!esre in France. Later
on. after a stay nt the University of Ha
vana,' he returned to Paris. Frank Scw
all. to whom we are indebted for the di
vining translation of the poems, says:
"Heredia took up a course of paleo
graphic studies', the fruits of which ap
pear in the exquisite elaboration of his
later work. He became associated with
Leconte de Lisle and others of the .poet
circle of the 'Parrassiens.' and in this at
mosphere were produced, at first for. pri
vate circulation, the rernarkable sonnets.
'Les Trophces, 1 which in 1C93 won for the
author his admission to the academy and
which have alone sufficed to place; him
among the' most eminent cf the . French
poets of any age. The poems appeared
here and there j in the Revue des Deux
Mondes, but were too refined in their su
preme beauty 'to appeal to tlfose outside
of a select circle; and therefore the poet
has remained 'illustrious and unpublished."
'Les TropheeV have at last received the
public's recognition and '. have passed
through many -editions."
Jules Lemaitre has covered 1 the sonnets
broadly. when he has said :. "Each one In
cludes much : science and much dreaming
â all theLbeauty of a myth, all the; spirit
of an epoch, all that is picturesque in a
civilization." And Sewall calls attention
to the hot Spanish blood traceable in
Heredia's "fervent J description of the hot
lands of the south, and < his portrayal of
Cartagena."; Given this ardor, U has been
chiseled, polished in the school of old
world art. , and the' result is : found m
poems like this:
Like flight of falcons from their native . crags,
Content.no more In their high solitude.
From Palos or Mogruer the captains sailed.
Half drunk with dreams of deeds heroic and
wild. . vV.i.:.
They -went to seize the fabled metal veins sj
Clpango ripens in her distant mines;
The trade winds bent their lateen yards
j toward
The shores mysterious of the Western Â¦World.
Each evenins hoping for an epic morn.
The' phosphorescent azure ot the sea.
Would charm their sleep with Its mirage of
gold ; â¢
Or leaning o'er the caravel's white bow,
They saw aecendlns in an unknown sky
New stars from out the depths of Ocean.

The Woman Who Trusted
Will N. Harben has been given high
praise and. possesses/ ra.re ability as a
wi-'ter of short stories. His novel recently
published cannot fail to attract attention.
While "The Woman Who Trusted was
running as a serial in the Saturday Even
ing Post the editor received many letters
containing the highest praise of the novel
and showing" absorbing interest in the plot
and, characters. . Â¦ -''?'' V
The average reader Is interested in the
vivid, artistic portrayal of a strong char
acter : struggling against overwhelming
odds, and Mr. "Harben's hero is a young
man possessing a most sensitive spirit and
the highest ideals, who proves his true
metal by successfully passing through a
crucible of sorrows and reverses that
would have consumed a weaker man. The
story opens in the South, shifts at once to
bohemian New. York, and .terminates hap
pily In Europe. There are few men in the
United- States better * qualified for such
an Â¦."'undertaking than-. Will R- Har

was one of the editors of the Youth's Com
panion : In Boston, where he. learned the
inner workings of a great periodical and

Eastover Court House.
After that splendid story by Ellen Glas
gow, "The Voice of the People," perhaps
we have had our taste cultivated to such
a pitch that we Â¦would not enjoy even a
good story of "life of the South to-day."
In any event after Miss Glasgow's sym
pathetic and remarkable Â¦work, "Eastover
Court House," which Is a fair story, sinks
to the degree of "poor."
"Eastover Court House,^ by Henry
Bufnham Boorie "and ' Kenneth Brown, Is
the first of a series of twelve American
novels by American writers which Har
per &. Brothers propose to bring out dur
ing the coming' literary season. The idea
is an excellent one and th^ scheme is de
serving of success.
The words "Court House" In the title
might lead the reader to suppose that this
is ar, story of law and lawyers, but the
name merely refers to a Virginia town,
the. seat of Eastover County. The story
is. supposed to be of up-to-date Virginia,
but at times savors strongly- of the South
of years ago.
Frequently It is difficult to tell what it
is all about. There is a slight strain of
love, a bit of horseflesh and horse racing
and some of the old "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
flavor of negro floggingâ but the work as
a whole is lacking in continuity.
Literary Notes.
Love letters seem to be the order of the
day, and - particularly timely therefore is
the. new edition of "His Letters," by Ju
lien Gordon, author of "Mrs. Clyde" and
"A Puritan Pagan." It will be brought
out by D. Appleton & Co.
"Out-of-the-Way Places in . the Orient"
is the collective title of three illustrated
papers in the Foreign Travel number of
The Century (May).. India and Burma are

paul" being described by. Mrs. Lockwood
de Forest ; "Amber, the Deserted J Capital
of Rajputana." by Marion Pope; and "The
Defiles of the Irrawaddy," by V. C. Scott
O'Connor. Mrs. de Forest's account of
personal, experiences is illustrated In part
by Lockwood Kipling, the famous story
teller's father. .
"American Country Life" Is the title of
a new monthly magazine Doubleday,
Page & Co. will publish, early In the au
tumn. It is expected to Interest every one
who cares' for out-docr . matters of any

of the Cornell Nature Bulletins, author,
professor and practical farmer, has done
more than almost any other person to
promote interest in outdoor. matters, vriil
edit it. The publishers claim that it is
going to be the most beautiful magazine
on the news standsâ because it has the
most beautiful subjects, and no pains will
be. spared, in reproducing them with all
their original charm. Heavy enameled pa
per will bo used throughout. , Though the
idea of this magazine is a new one, it will
stand for the .same love of .nature and .
outdoor life that has enabled this same
publishing hous^ to* print 65,000 books 'of
their new nature series : with colored
plates. Such. a periodical will have an ap
preciative audienre and. will, doubtless, in
time gain one of Â°ihcse large circulations â

Drexel Biddle. publisher, Philadelphia,
announces the shortly, forthcoming publi
cation of a highly Important contribution
to English literature. It Is a work by
Professor Winthrcp Dudley Sheldon, thÂ«
vice president of Girard College. Tho
work will bear the title. "A Second Cen
tury Satirist," and contains tne nrst Eng
lish translation ever made of the more
important and interesting dialogues of Lu
clan There are forty translated dia
logues of this brilliant satirist* who lived
in the age of the Antonincs. and who is
the / most entertaining among anciont
writers, because, more than any of them,
he possesses a genuine flavor of mod
ernity.
Professor Sheldon has worked many
years on thi3 great and comprehensive
undertaking, and the table of contents
offers .a highly appetizing Ii3t cf title*.
By a liberal supply of foot-note references
and an alphabetical index, the work is at
once stilted for the reader wno seeks en
tertainment and for the student at school
or at college.
A powerful chapter from one of the
most remarkable of recorded human ex
periences appears in McClure's Magazine
for Mayâ Captain Alfred Dreyfus' own
story cf his arrest, degradation and trans
portation to Devils Island. To this story
is added a portion oi the diary kept by
Dreyfus on -the island for his wife and
referred to so often and so mysteriously
in the Rennes trial, but never made pub
lic.
A more intense and convincing expres
sion of human agony than that found in
these fragments is inconceivable. From
first to last it is evident that the sufferer
is bewildered and maddened by what has
befallen him and that all which keeps
him from Insanity or death is his deter
mination to prove that his persecutions
are powerless to overthrow what he calls
the "sovereignty of the soul." These dra
matic passages make It clear, too, that
Dreyfus was compelled to undergo on
Devils Island every ; ignominy and hard
ship his jailers could devise, even to close
confinement in a hut. enclosed by pali
sades and shut out from air and light,
with double irons upon his legs through
out the night.
The book from which this remarkab.le
document is taken, containing the story of
Dreyfus' entire five years of suffering and
imprisonment, is to be published by Mc-
Clure, Phillips & Co. In May.

Mary Catherine Crowley, author of "A
Daughter of New France,'-' which Little,
Brown & Co. publish early, in May, has
been actively engaged in literary work for
the past ten years. She is well known as
a writer for the young, and has also con
tributed to- various magazines and syndi
cates, sometimes under her own name,
sometimes under pseudonym.
Miss Crowley Is a native of Boston, and
had the good fortune to be born of schol
arly stock. Her father, John C. Crowley.
is an alumnus of Harvard University; her
mother is a graduate of the Sacred Heart,
Manhattanvilleâ later the daughter's alma
mater. With so favorable home and
school influence, a large circle of traveled
and book-loving relatives, a host of fam
ily friends among the clergy, and, in due
tirnp, a broad and varied social life, her
literary gift made rapid and symmetrical
development.
In 1SS2 Miss Crowley went abroad, visit
ing Rome, Paris, Dresden and other Old
"World cities. For the past eight years she
has lived in the "West, a part of the time
at Detroit. She has traveled in Canada,
and is familiar with Quebec and Mont
real. Thus among her acquaintance be
longing to the old French-Canadian fam
ilies, and from the pages of old memoirs
and histories, she gathered the material
for the ground work of this romance "A
Daughter of â¢ New France." which Â¦ oc
curred to her about 1SD4. It was begun
three or more years ago, laid aside for
other work and finally taken up and fin
ished during the past winter. .
Miss Crowley was for some years a
member of the New England Woman's
Press Association and of the "Woman's
Press Club of New York City.

Harry waiters,, who has iwen given the
sobriquet' of "king" among his asso
ciates, is a graduate of Oxford. He is a
talented musician and. a distinguished lin
guist, speaking several tongues fluently.
While many of the others have never
passed the portals of Oxford, the expert-,
ence gained by shuttling about the world
and coming in contact with all sorts and
â¢ iescripiions of human beings makes them
equal to any emergency. If they.wouid
apply their talents in legitimate channels
instead of to the art of fleecing they
would be huge successes. Their general ,
make-up leaves small wonder that they
are able to successfully act the charac

The bunko man has no home. He must
be a nomad in habits, and on the Pacific
slope "works" a territory extending front
San Diego to Seattle. Occasionally a
"jump" is made to Denver, but only when
the detectives have been prodded into
action. When a haul Is made and the
case given publicity, and the victim . re
fuses to listen to a compromise, the per
petrator of the job passes along to another
station on the circuit. As quickly as the
matter has passed out of mind he returns
to resume operations. While in a town
his residence is uncertain. A room may
be rented for a month, but it may only be
occupied for a day. The victim is always
certain that he remembers the place
where he parted with his coin, but when
he returns with the officers the "ticket
office," "tailor shop" or "assay office"
has been blotted from the . map of the
city, and the key left, without explana
tion, with the landlord. /
The parapnernalia.used in the thieving
games is simple and is packed, as a rule,
by the itinerant tricksters in small hand
satchels. Cards, pieces of quartz, blank
checkbooks and-, other articles of corre
sponding bulk often comprise the- entire
outfit, so that the bunko man may always
make a hasty departure. Sometimes, how
ever, his flight is interrupted, and Cap
tain Fred Esola, property clerk for the
Police Department, shows visitors a sec
tion of his office that resembles a baggage
room in a passenger depot.
The bunko business in San Francisco is
carried on almost exclusively by men.
Few women have ever been implicated in
plots of plunder. In the Eastern cities,
however, it is different, and females play
prominent parts in. games of deception!
and blackmail. Â¦ Â¦ '

It Is an old legend, but It â¢would
perhaps be well to hang it up some
where and let yourself into the
habit of remembering your pocket
book whenever you are in a crowd tor tne
next few weeks.
Human coyotes, they are, who live by
sneaking about and thieving their living
from the unsuspecting:. 'They do not com
mit capital offenses, so there is no excuse
for hanging them; they confine them
selves to "stone getting" and pocket pil
fering, trusting to the comparative small
ness of the offense and to their wits to
ret them off with light sentences in case
they are discovered and captured.
And really they have all the advantage
over their victim, as well as over the de
tective who does not know them person

laid, while the subject upon whom they
have determined to operate' has not thÂ©
remotest idea be is going to be robbed.

are hundreds here and more are comlns.
"Now that's all foolishness! To be sure,
there arc doubtless a few here; but we

up the subject train.

They shall also trot before every officer

When crowds are In -town and thousands
ftnreac the streets tntn flourishes tnÂ©
bunko man like the rreen bay tree.
Thus he is described by one who has
met him:
"When he approaches you with his glib
tongue, inquiring the location of a certain
street or asking the time of day, his
mind is formulating the plans for your
financial depredation. In a few seconds
he has read your temperament, learned of
your susceptibilities, and knows more of
your affairs than could be written on ten
pages of paper.
"If a doubt should cross your mind as
to the proper intentions of the well
dressed, educated individual, whose con
versation, though loquacious, becomes in
teresting almost as quickly as it is begun,
and whose cordiality relieves the monot
ony of staring into unfamiliar faces, you
cast It aside. His offer to render you as
sistance makes you eager for a better ac
quaintance; and if he says that he, like
yourself, is a, wanderer in a strange land,
you feel that touch of sympathy arising
out of loneliness. But you afterward
hear the old, old story of the 'sucker'
and the bait when the police explain, in
a matter-of-fact way, that he was only
the 'steerer' and you a victim." â¢ -
A horde of bunko and confidence men
and professional "grafters" infest San
Francisco. They thrive pn the credulity
of people, and the extent of their harvest
has never been told. Only at times when
the police capture their outfits and secure
the receipts of victims who accept the re
turn of a petty portion of their losses
rather than expose their folly by report
ing the matter, is an Idea gained of the
vast army of men in the world whose lack
of common sense, coupled with a greed
of rain, makes them easy prey to be
duped or imposed upon. '
Standing side by side in thÂ© ranks of
the "sure thing" man's victims are the
farm hand and the metropolitan (capital
ist. Not only does Silas Perkins cart
away his gold brick to find that it can
only bo disposed of at a foundry, but the
gentleman who has listened to the rumble
of streetcars his entire lifetime and
whose wit and shrewdness have won him
plaudits In both social and business
circles discovers that he has yet things
to learn. Both the rural and the city man
are handed their "bricks," only they are
often passed out in different packages. '
ThÂ© devices to trap the unwary are as
numerous as reeds in a marsh, and each
Is adapted to a certain case, usually at
the discretion of the man who, to use
his own vernacular, first "picks up tho
hooslor."
The personalities of the sharpers afford
an interesting study in criminology. Un
like tho burglar or tho footpad, their
countenances seldom betray their wicked
wiles. Well cppearlng and conversant on
diverse subjects, they command the atten
tion of the learned as well as the Illit
erate. Should tho toplo of conversation be
upon foreign lands, the information thoy
vouchsafe at once marks them as men of
travel; and their knowledge of men and

; One of the shrewdest gold brick . cases
on the records of the Police Department
was worked. on a Stockton-street sausage
dealer named Ludwig in 1892. ; A stranger
who had visited Ludwig's store on, many
occasions told of his ' experience one
morning of meeting an . old Indian : called
Pedro in a secluded portion of Golden Gate
Park. The redskin, he â¢ claimed, had on
one occasion exhibited a large bar of gold
and offered it for sale. Ludwig's curiosity
was aroused ' Â¦ and \ â¢ he * ' accompanied Â¦ the
stranger to the spot and saw .for .himself.
Before recommending a purchase . thÂ©
stranger drilled into the bar in. the pres
ence of the sausage man and had the
drillings assayed. They proved to be fine
gold. When Ludwig gave the Indian $5000
and took the brick to an assay office hÂ©
was Informed that the bulk of his article
was. bell metal' and that holes had been,
drilled and tamped with gold from, which
the bunko man obtained bis sample for
assay, purpose*.
The selling of gold bricks is an old story
and is usually worked on strangers In the
city. A favorite means employed by tho
bunko men is to meet the victim in a ho
tel and engage him in conversation." \\ hile
thus engaged a bearded ' and rough-look
ing individual enters loaded with blan
kets and baggage. He greets the "steerer
and is then introduced to the man who
has been selected to purchase his brick.
The late comer announces that he has Just
arrived â¢ from some mining region and
would like to see the sights. He is in
vited to "do the line," but objects,, after
hesitation, Â¦ because, although he has
plenty of gold bars in his luggage, his
purse is slim and he dislikes Imposing on
the hospitality of his friends. All banks
and the mint being closed, he is unable to
convert the bullion into coin until thÂ© fol
lowing day. The "steerer" suggests that
he sell one of his bars at a' liberal dis
count immediately, and he consents to do
so. v The farmer offers to accommodate
him with money, and sometimes has /to
mortgage the farm when he goes back to
the country. . . ; . '.
At length a good hand is dealt the guest
and he is urged by the man who brought
him in to make 'a heavy stake. When he
is raised and his pockets are empty he is
permitted to go to his hotel in company
wtih one of the players to get* more cash
with which to "see" the raise. Ihe hands
have been sealed in envelopes, and when
they are opened the bunKo gentlemen
rai.e in the pot and console the loser.
What is known as three-card "monte"
may be worked in a saloon as well as a
"joint." The steerer meets another of the
gang apparently by chance, who is shuf
fling three cards, two of which are blank
on both sides. The game is to point to
the other card marked on the reverse
side. While the man who is conducting
the game turns his head for an Instant
the "steerer" picks up the desired piece
of cardboard,' and winking his eye turns
up one edge slightly. The farmer intends
to bet on the card thus mutilated, but
when the swindler shuffles the three again
ht deftly straightens out the corner of
the winning card and turns up another
one. In this manner the hoosier is
hoodwinked. The "shell" game, in. which
bets are made that a bean is under a cer
tain shell, is operated in much the same
manner. ' . ;
ately the other two object and a discus
sion ensues. The proposed victim is not
always inclined to play at first, but he
finally accepts the invitation out of cour
tesv. He is "allowed to win a few small
bets, and soon the "steerer," reappearing
on the scene, stands behind him.
The "lock" trick, worked on the streets,
is one of the least troublesome to the
sharpers. The victim Is walking with the
Roulette wheels are controlled either by
the use of brakes or air. If the former is
employed the i operator presses a section
of the floor or table to which a lever Is
attached and the slight pressure makes
the revolving wheel stop at a desired
point. Some gamblers' machines are so
constructed that airholes guard each of
the colors on. which big prizes are paid.
A small rubber bulb is used by the opera
tor In forcing air when he finds that the
little ball is inclined to bounce on an ob
jectionable color or number.
A crucible filled with perhaps amalgam
to. resemble molten meial is in position,
and each time the lever is worked a shin
ing gold piece drops out of the machine.
One of these is given to the would-be pur
chaser, . and when he becomes satisfied
that it can be used as a circulating me
dium he agrees to take a quantity of
them. When he opens the bag supposed
to contain his "treasure he finds in hi3
possession a number of copper cent pieces.
â¢The coins dropped out of the machine
were genuine and were released by a lit
tle contrivance one at a time.
v A number of swindling ? devices are
manipulated by the force of electricity.
Ibe 'plate" game, by which a man was
recently victimized at the Cliff House, is
controlled by a series of magnets. The
player casts plates and tries to land them
on the surface of others some distance
away. Magnetism causes the metal disks
to fall wide of the mark at which they
are aimed, and hundreds of dollars are
cleaned up by -the operators. A "Tivoli"
baseball table that occupied space In. a
Dupont-street '-joint" was recently con
fiscated by the police. Its surface was
an incline plane dotted with metal pegs.
A ball started rolling at the head of the
table would deposit itself in a pocket at
the lower end. The line of pegs just
above the pockets was on a movable strip
and' could be worked from side to side, so
that the rolling ball would be under the
control of the manipulator. The cash box
was fixed on the side of the table and the
lover operating the portable section of the
table was inside of it. When the game
keeper had occasion to steer the ball lest
it fall into high-priced pockets he pre
tended to be coaming money in the cash
drawer. The movement of the pegs was
so slight that the player could not per
ceive it, and he scarcely divined the ac
tion of the bunko man in placing his hand
in the box. The "smooth" dice box, con
structed with a glazed r interior, is the
means of robbing men at dice, and its
use is not confined to the ring of bunko
men alone.. Faro and draw poker layouts
are also arranged at a disadvantage to
the players."
bpurious coin is ottered to a farmer at
50 cents on the dollar. The victim is led
into the headquarters, where several men
are at work with a small machine. He at
once inquires what they are doing and is
informed that they are manufacturing *5
gold pieces from a substance so closely
resembling gold that the substitution of it
for the genuine article could not be de
tected even by experts.
The "green goods" men dispose' of their
wares by representing that the counterfeit
bills ottered for saie by them are exact
counterparts of the genuine articles. In
proof of this they give the intended buyer
a good bill purporting to be bogus, with
a request that ne get it changed in some
store or, saloon. "When the business man
to whom it is presented makes no protest
the victini is | convinced and a boxful I of
bills at 20 cents on the dollar is -wrapped
up for him. Before the package is deliv
ered, however, another box filled with
sawdust is substituted for it. The victim
fears to report the case to the police,
thinking tha.t he may De liable for deal

â¢ Bogus policemen â¢ often frighten away
the men who have been beaten at tho

demands for its restoration when the pro

discovers that gambling has been Der-
The prisons confine a varied host of law
breakers", but there Is one class of crimi
nals that seldom is forced under their
shelter. The bunko men are often arrest
ed; occasionally arraigned on a felony
charge, but seldom convicted. The set
tlement of cases out of court is responsi
ble for the immunity these felons seem
to enjoy. One of the accomplishments of
the craft is the pacifying of the victim
should he be inclined to invoke the assist
ance of the police in securing retribution.
This aftermath is attended to b.y the
"shadow" * or "trailer," whose duty it Is
to dog the footsteps of the man who has
lost his money and ascertain what action
he contemplates taking. In some cases
the victim never makes a complaint. He
is willing to sacrifice the money for the
experience and say nothing. When the
"shadow" satisfies himself that no trou

quarters and prepares for a more vindic

neither of the finders can disjoint the two.
"I'll take you up,", says the steerer.
"My friend here opened them the first
time he tried." ' â¢Â¦ â¢ â¢
The friend believes he has found the
goose that lays the golden eggs, but when
he loses his wager discovers that the bun
ko men used to sets of locks, one of whica
it was impossible to open.
A bunko man, attired as a beggar, walks
along in front of a bevy of fashionably
dressed women and picks up a ring whicn
he himself has dropped. Inside 1 the band
are the characters 1SK. and he at once
stops the women and asks them what the
numbers and letter indicate. When told
that the ring is valuable he makes reply
something like this:
"Well, ladies, a cup of warm coffee
would do me moss good than a chest full
of gold jÂ»iÂ£l now. 1 have not eaten a bite
for two days, and as I need money for
food you may have this article for half
its value." .
The ring, or whatever the piece of Jew
elry may be, is found to be spurious.
"Ringing the boodle" is a game that
brings many complaints to police head
quarters. The victim is Induced to Invest
a certain amount of coin in some proposi
tion with the -"steerer" 'and the joint ap
propriation is placed in a valise. A plan
is adopted by which neither partner can
rob the other by looting the treasury. The
victim is permitted to retain the valise
in his possession, and the bunko* men take
the key. When the latter falls to keep
an appointment on the following day the
victim becomes alarmed and cuts open
the valise. He finds that it contains a
number of iron washers or something that
will make a jingle. The valises were
switched whila ha was dreaming of
wealth.
The most criminal and despicable trick
employed by bunko men is the swindling
of sick persons by bogus physicians. Men
who come from the country in search of
medical treatment are approached by
"steerers" who claim that they have suf
fered from exactly the same ailment as
afflicts them. The name of a physician is
mentioned by the bunko men and the suf
ferer is finally induced to consult him.
The "physician" lightens the patient's
purse, often taking his last dollar, without
bringing him relief. . In many cases lives
are endangered by the neglect of proper
treatment. When the stranger realizes
that he has fallen among thieves his mal

An appointment Is mada with the latter,
and an "attorney" urges him to withdraw

The recent escapades or tnÂ© swlndltrt

are about to visit the city during the
period of time the IÂ»Teaident will remala

would treasure the remembrnnce.

In 1820. it being presented to William
Mlcklefield and consequently removed to
tho Micklefleld mansion Juut opposlto the
Joshua Ward houÂ»c.
When Mr. Micklenold died in- 1<40 the
chair passed to his eldest daughter and
was preserved by her In the Mlcklefield
mansion until her death In 1870,' nt which
time th&' chair was Bent to her sister'*
husband in California. William O. An-'
drows. It was shipped west In a little
sailing vessel around Capo Horn, early In
the seventies and reached Its destination
without n scratch.
For nearly thirty years Mr. Andrews
treasured tho historical relic >ln his pic
turesque home at Bollnaa. Being a lover
of curios, he filled his house with inter
esting things, .but in the foreground ho
always 1 kept. the Washington chair. He
always took pride In having a silk Amer
ican flag draped on the back-the flag for
which we are indebted to this splendid
general. No article in the room was dust
ed withi quite the care and precision given
to this particular piece of furniture.
The little ' town of Bolinas is scattered
along the smooth beach. of the great Pa
cific In such a free and happy sort of way
that it has become an ideal resort for
those who love the sea. As the different
people come, and go from year to year
they* learn of the â¢â ".Washington chair,"
which has . become quite a landmark In
Marln County. U For years people ', visited,
the Andrews house to see the chair, and
were always \ well entertained. Mr. An
drews was a capital story-tellor. while his
wife took great pleasure in showing the
valuable relics In her sweet, modeat way.
Among other interesting things was ? a
huge, gun which Â¦ Mr. Andrews' grand
father carried all through the Revolution
ary War. .. It was a' clumsy weapon, over
six â¢ feet long, so , that - the grandfather
needed to bo of very good slaehimself to
fight with It. : This gun also went through
the war of , 1812 with Mr. Andrews' uncle,
who afterward brought It West with, him,'
using it to defend himself against Indians
PRESIDENT MC'KINLEY IS TO USE THE CHAIR
OF GEORGE WASHINGTON DURING HIS
STAY IN SAN FRANCISCO
PRESIDENT McKIN'LET'B visit to
San Francisco will not consist sole
ly ot banquets and bows. To be
sure, there must be fetes in his
honor and bows in return, but tnÂ«>
kind heart of the irreat executive had
been made manifest by his readiness to do
a gervlct for othersâ a service that cannot
add to his purse or his plaudits, but a
consldera-tlon simply to gratify an old
man's whim that the President shall sit
in his old, historic < hnlr. which hns been
used by Oeorgt Washington and other
, great men.
The invitation did not go to the White
House engraved on a pinto of solid gold
and borne specially by somo prominent
representative of Ban Francisco. It whs
merely a brief note of request carried by
Undo Bom in the usual way and subse
quently laid upon tho President's deÂ»k by
his necrptary. There was no pull, no
pressure brought to bear, making It In
cumbent upon our country's ruler to be
gracious, but a clroplo explanation thnt
there is in Ban Francisco a very old chair
of George Washington's which has also
been occupied by other great men, and
that it was the earnest wish of the old
man who guarded It his entire life-time
that Freslfl*nt McIClnley should confer a
similar hotTor.
There was no formal reply that the
President had already accepted a suffi
cient number of invitations, but would
take the matter under advisement, as he
has a way of doing when asked to attend
banquets. There was no delay, no hesita
tion, but a prompt rcsponso to Indicate
his pleasure in complying.
For the convenience of the President
the chair has been Bent to the residence
of Mrs. George E. Morse, 1378' Fell street,
where Mrs. Morse Is to entertain her dis
tinguished uncle. ;
A-side from being historically interest
ing, the chair Is a work of art It Is of
rarest mahogany through and through,
rt<a!icately carved by/ hand, and uphol
stered with black satin haircloth, the seat
being outlined with dozens of ornamental
brass-headed tacks. The beauty of Its
wood and the fineness of Its carvings are
a credit to the cabinet-maker of two cen
turies ago, and would certainly tax the
wits of our modern manufacturers. It
does not in any way resemble the huge
armchair which Long-fellow's children had
made for him out of the "spreading chest
nut tree" he had loved so well. There is
nothing massive about this chair Of
Washington's, which suggests the Louis
XIV style of furniture; in fact, It looks
so frail that we wonder if it has not
groaned under the weight of years or
creaked with the weight of Presidents.
But the chair is as strong- to-day as it
ever was, and promises to stand pat for
several centuries more.
General Washington -used this chair
whilo vJMting at the Jonhua Ward man
sion in Salom, Mann. This %vos the Presi
dent's memorably vlolt to Bulcm In 17S0.
In a vory old copy of tho Salem Ob
server may bo found some particular* of
Waphlngton's arrival In that city on that
oceuslon. Thla account omphuHUes tho
importance of tho event to the pooplo of

"Soon after 2 o'clock on the aftornoon

places of the first consequence.
"The Joshua Ward house was probably
as eligible a mansion for tho entertaining
of such a guest as tho town afforded. It
had been erected between August 11, 1781,
and August 8. 1785, with bricks Imported
from England for the* purpose, and stood
low, with the open terraced approach In
front of the two great trees, one of which
Still survives. \The Neal house 'was not
then built." - } â¢
Tho chamber occupied by Washington
was on the northeastern corner and for a
century afterward this room in the Joshua
Ward house remained a point of histori
cal interest. --'
Among the surviving records -of that
memorable day of President Washington's
entrance Into Salem, the greeting of AJr.
Northey, the Quaker leader, stands out
most strikingly. Nothing seems to hav*
pleased more than the plain and hearty
manner in which this chosen representa
tive of the Society of Friends received the
honored President. Â¦ In presenting Wash
ington to the selectmen Mr. Northey took
the President by the hand and remained
covered while he said:
"Friend Washington, we are glad to see
thce, and in behalf of the inhabitants
bid theÂ© a hearty welcome to Salem."
To-day it would surprise some of us to
see b. citizen present our country's ruler
to an audience without removing his own
hat, but the good Quaker wa3 far too
steadfast- to change the customs of his
brotherhood and we can well afford to
add that he had far too honest a heart
to be misunderstood by so good and great
a man as George Washington.
Tho Independent Salem Cndets enjoyed
the honor of escorting General Washing
ton In Salem and listened, to words of high
commendation from his awn lips. Ilcfor-
ence to this occasion may still be found on
a yellowed page In their treasured orderly
book, reading as follows:
During President -.Washington's visit to
Salem he was so loved and lauded by the
inhabitants of the town and regarded with
an admiration, and respect so profound
that' they flocked to' the Joshua Ward
house to pay some tribute of their devo
tion. For weeks after his departure the
people visited the mansion, many, of them
kissing tho doorlatch" Washington had
touched. The enthusiastic visitors devised
every scheme to set Into the guest cham
ber that had given their hero restâ "Rest
that knits up the raveled sleeve of care."
The old Salem residents of. to-day, sit
ting around their firesides, talk over this
visit of Washington's and some of them
produce, with a great deal of pride, a bit
of tho bed curtain which a grandfather
once stealthily , clipped from, the great
general's couch . of slumber, j One family
even boasts of & pillow case which, even
If procured by unfair, means according to
the common law, is no less dear to their
patriotic hearts. . . . .
It is not surprising, then, that the loyal

able character and also his brilliant career
i. j a general that he revered everything
about the house which his honored friend
had touched. ... V
With all of : Mr. Ward's devotion to
Washington there was no selfishness and
after a time ha presented the valued chair
to a William Spencer, who had long been a
faithful friend of the family. Mr. Ward's
reason for offering: such " a' gift to % Mr.
T3pencer was never made known to the in
quiring public' Mr. Spencer was said to
be a man of very fine nature, ; however,
ington'3 stepson, wooed and won Miss
Eleanore Calvert.
In the east drawing room tha walls
were once entirely covered with a water
color painting of a fax chase, executed by
an artist whose name It Is impossible to
discover.- This also was painted over dur
ing the reconstruction, and the mirrors
which originally covered the walls in tha
west room have also been removed. Each
of these rooms contained a beautifully
carved mantel-board of Italian marble,
one of which was recently sold for $5000.
Â¦ The remainder of the first floor Is taken
up by the kitchens, dining- room, library,
and storerooms, with the exception of tha
portion occupied by tho plate vaultâ one
of the most, interesting points of the old
place. The Iron doors ofÂ«this strong room
had ttct been opened for generations,
when a tenant, in order to secure more
room, had 'one of them removed and a
portion of the wall torn down.
In 'removing the masonry, many old and
valuable papers were discovered. Among
others, a commission signed" by George
III appointing Bennet Calvert, father of
the sixth Lord Baltimore, revenue col
lector in the Province of Prince George,
not/ Prince George County, Maryland.
There were also autograph letters of
Henry Clay and George Calvert.
A wide staircase, with mahogany newel
post, leads to the second floor, where are
the rooms In the old days set apart for
the use ot Henry Clay, Daniel Webster,
and General Washington, all close friends
of George Calvert. In one room Is a
chair used by Clay, and also a cedar-lined
wardrobe, In which It Is said the famous
statesman used to hang hta long-tailed
coat, satin vest and knee breeches. Tho
rooms of Wnehlngton and Webster are
bare of furniture and are uninteresting
save for their historic associations.
TJe:U comes the garretâ the very naras
suggests mystery I The visitor reaches It
by a narrow, creaky stair, and In the dim
half-light beholds hair trunks. Iron and
brass bound cheats, and boxes n ; all
kind* plied nigh on every side. What a
treat It would bo to delve Into this store
of ancient' papers, utensils and clothing,
with their memories of lone &fo! : But,
nlnf, many of the boxes have beÂ«n de
spoiled of their contents by unscrupulous
relic hunters, and those which still retain
their treasures are kept securely locked.
Originally a bell hung in the cupola, but
lomtt year* ago this wai - presented by
Mrs. Gordon to the Catholic Colh-sÂ© at
Georgetown, and Us deep voice, which
once called the slaves from the fields, now
sounds each hour from. thÂ« tall spire oC
the University. The old bell was present
ed to Mr. Calvert In 1814 by friends in
Home, and was blessed by the Pope be
fore being sent to this country.
The house contains forty rooms, includ
ing the wine vaults and store- rooms in
tha cellar, and many extensive house
parties and dances* have been given in tha
old mansion by the various colonial and
historical clubs of Washington. In tha
rear, a porch paved with marble tiles
runs the entire length of the main portion
of the house, and from this can be seen
the lake, on an island in the center of
which are the ruins of a summer house.
Here Henry Clay drafted the famous Mis
souri compromise. The pillars which sup
port the roof of the porch were originally
made for the Capitol, but were. sold to

The Interior of the house had benn al

with the dead leaves of autumn, blown In

There If no authentic statement as to
the exact nge <>f the building, some giving
the date of construction as 1760 and nth.ua
placing It rs lKte as 1832. It is saffl to
cay, however, that it was built In the
latter part of the eighteenth centurv.
The architect and original owner, to
whom the land was granted by George
III. was Henry Stler, an exile from Ant
werp. Ke snared no expense Â«o make
the place the equal of any in the colonies,
bringing decorators and sculptors from his
native country to beautify the mansion.
The material, including a larce part of
the lumber, was brought from England
and landed at St. Mary's City, Md., where
it was loaded on ox carts and hauled J12
miles to Riversdale. The entire cost of
construction was 524S.OOO.
The place came into the possession of
the Calverts when George Calvert. grand-
Fon of the sixth Lord Baltimore, married
Rosalie Eugenia Stior, a daughter of the
builder.
The exterior of the house is exceedingly
imposing. It is a long, low building, with
a large wing at either end, and follows
tlie general plan of latter eighteenth cen
tury architecture. An oak shaded drive,
passing the main entrance, Incloses a cir
cular lawn. In the center of which are
the remains of a once beautiful fountain.
Guarding the front porch is an nld rust
eaten cannon, at one time used on a
British frigate, wrecked in the Potomac
during the Revolution. It was ratseu
from the river bed and presented to Lord
Baltimore by the monks of St. Mary's.
The front floors, of English oak, open
into a large hallway, from the opposite
side of which folding doors lead into the
spacious ballroom, where in the colonial
days satin-clothed and lace-bedecked
macaronies led trim Maryland damsels
through the stately minuet or rollicking

1-^ EL MONTE, May 11.â There was
\ a three-cornered reception to the
1 President to-day, starting in Del
f Monte and ending in Pacific
"^ Grove, Â¦where he spoke to his old
comrades in arms the veterans
Cf the Grand Army of the Republic. At
each place there was enthusiasm, the
â¢waving of flags*, the cheering: of thousands
e.nd all the excitement of a Presidential
visit, but at Pacific Grove there was a
touch of sentiment absent from every
place he has visited and which will be re
peated at no place to which he will go.
When the President stood before the
people gathered in the assembly hall at
Pacific Grove he looked at men who wore
the same blue in which he first served his
country. None of them were young, and
fome were bent and halting and McKin
ley stood among them perhaps the most
youthful of them all; but when he spoke
he brought them back to the times when
the uniform meant more than a State en
campment at Pacific Grove, and to be a
nan of the Grand Army required nerve
as well as patriotism, and cost more than
the price of a rifle or a sword.
Pathetic Words to Veterans.
It was a beautiful speech that the Pres
ident made to his old comrades, pathetic,
patriotic and replete with sentiments of
reveranre for the flag and tender as a lov
ing memory. As he spoke no one thought
of him as the President; no one looked
Â¦upon him as the man who won his straps
by the steadiness of his rifle and the edge
of his sword: no one considered him a vis
itor from the other side' of a country he
had helped to keep strong and undivided.
They listened as to a loved comrade
who. after an absence, had come among
them again, and it Â¦was that- sentiment
that guided thf President's words. He
ppoke with intense feeling, low and clear
ly as always, but with a suppressed fer
vor that sometimes showed Itself In' a
flutter of emotion in his voice, and a
rhoking in hi* throat. He was seldom in
terrupted by applause, but sometimes it
would come, and then it was of the kind
that comes more from the heart than
from the head or hands; that brings the
tear sooned than the smile and dwells In
the irenrpry after all else has faded.
President McKInley spoke truly when
he eald: "'Nowhere in my travels have I
been in such clo?e heart touch with the
men with whom I kept step from "Cl to
'fS." and the applause which followed
showed that his comrades, too, felt the
fellowship and were grateful for It. There
was more applause when he declared,

"Mr. Hill, are the troubles between the
Northern. Pacific and the Union Pacific
settled?" asked the reporter.
"There is no question of any trouble.
I never myself had any doubt that in

And the trouble was not foisted upon the
public by us. I did not speculate myself
in a single ihare, and the shares of the

Mr. Hill paused and turned half around.

contest which has been waged during the
past few days. Certain holders of â¢ the
Northern Pacific in league with Hill were
tempted, says the: information, by. the
high price of the stock to put it on the
market unknown to the Hill managers.
It had be^n acquired by them when, the
stock was low and while the holders of
this stock had no intention of deserting
the Hill-Morgan combine they concluded
that the stock was too high and could be
bought back* at a much lower price and
they could clean up a- few : thousands by
the transaction. It appears that the Har
rlman people had 'anticipated some such
action and had planned to Dick up the
Stray shares of Northern Pacific as fast
as they appeared on the ' market. " This
stock, which was pledged to the Hill com
bine, was eagerly gobbled' up by the Har
riman interests, as also were all other
small lots offered. This was two weeks
ago. Finally the rumor reached the ears
of the Hill people and,' as the etory.was
repeated and grew, stronger, they began
to count noses. It was then that they ills
covered that a large block of their â¢ own
stock- had got into the hands of Harrl

of one of their own party and theÂ»order
went forth' to their brokers, to buy- up
the stock at any price.- 1 ':. " Â¦' " ;
This was the. beginning of the frantic

complish ends 'that could find no justifi

With only one exception of much. Im

Moreover, nearly one-fourth (22.6 per

more than twice as large, as the wheat

Y-i An adjournment is really necessary now,"
because, the ; attendance in the Reichstag
durhjg the past .fortnight has dwindled
Steadily, and important measures .have
.repeatedly been passed by a, few score of
members: This doubtless was owing par
tially to the fact that members of
Reichstag do not yet receive any. remun
eration for their services/ not- even free
railroad passes. The Reichstag this week,
for the thirteenth time, passed a resolu
tion by a five-sixths majority to the effect
that the members should be paid so much
per day, but It is known that the Emperor
and the Bundesrath still opgose any re
muneration, and will not confirm the
Reichstag resolution.
When the members disperse next week
the House will have agreed to a prolonga
tion of the provisional commercial ar
rangement between Germany and Great
Britain until December 31, 1903, to an im
perial order levying a duty on logwood
and , to a supplementary duty on coffee
and cocoa from Haytl.
American Criticism Annoying.
The anti-Germanism in part of the
American, press is keenly felt herÂ©, all the
more because nobody knows Â¦ the reason
for It. The Foreign Office is kept busy
denying one unfounded story after an
other. Intended to ascribe rapacious
schemes to Germany. The officials of the
United States Embassy fully confirm the
statements of the German Foreign Office.
The serious and influential newspapers
have v hitherto not paid much attention to
this renewed "Deutschen Hetze" (Ger
man baiting) in America, but the Berlin
Neueste Nachrichten, Conservative, has
pointed out how differently sensational
news from America, apparently conflict
ing wtth German interests here, is re
ceived.' It instances the report about the
Azores, and savs:
"Nobody here blames the United States
for trying to secure a coaling station on
the Azores or elsewhere." â¢.
The Taeeblatt's New York specials, re
ferring to anti-German utterances in the
American press, have been followed in
every case by prompt official denial here
of the imputations made.
Russia's Moves in China.
The China auestion is still .uppermost
here. The Cologne Gazette prints a St.

THERE are a multitude of women, es-

womeli obliged to be on their feet
constantly, who are wretched beyond de-
scription simply because their strength

Peruna Is such a perfect specific for
each case that when patients have once
used it they can never be induced to quit
it until they are permanently cured. It
begins to relieve the disagreeable symp-
toms at once. The backache ceases, the
trembling knees are strengthened^ the ap-
petite restored, the digestion made per-
fect, the dull headache is stopped and the
weakening drains are gradually cured.
These results certainly, follow a course of

The executive committee recommends
that the afternoon of Tuesday, May 14, be
declared a holiday by all business houses,
and urgently requests the adoption of Its
recommendation in order that the recep
tion of the President aud party may be
attended with proper ceremony and that
every citizen may be given an opportu
nity to take part in it.
Secretary Long of the navy will be the
guest of honor at the semi-monthly ban
quet to be given by the Unitarian Club on
Friday evening. The banquet will take
place at the rooms of the Merchants' Club
on Sansome street. The number of Invi
tations will be limited.

streets that wi'.l betoken the
presence of magic. Even now
there is a display of flags and
bunting that symbolize the unrest
and eagerness with which the
people await the coining of the President
xuicl the ej>ectacular parades and assem
blages which will mark the week's visit
of the chief magistrate. But by to-mor
row night the principal streets will pre
sent vistas of flaming colors "glowing
against backgrounds of evergreen, and
when night falls brilliant electric displays
will make the night scenes even more
glorious than those of the day.
The executive committee met yesterday
and came to final conclusions upon many
features of the week's programme, but
this final programme must be submitted
to the President and receive his approval
before it will be official.
It was decided that Mayor Phelan
should deliver the address welcoming the
President to San Francisco at the public
reception in the nave of the ferry depot
Tuesday night, instead of waiting until
the citizens' banquet Saturday night. Al
thor.gh the surroundings at the public re
ception will not be conducive to effective
Fpeech-making-, the incongruity of delay
ing the formal welcome to the city until
the v!Flt would be almost over was appa
rent and the change was made.
Donahue Fountain Dedication.
The unveiling of the Donahue fountain
has caused the committee some worri
rrjent, as there seemed no desirable half
hour available for that purpose. Mayor
Phelan suggested that the ceremony
ought to taKe place early in the week, as
that would enable the visiting thousands
to enjoy the beauty of the fountain dur
ing the remainder of their stay in San
Francisco. Accordingly it was agreed
that the ceremony should be held Wednes
day morning at 8:30 o'clock, if the Presi
dent approve. This will enable the dedi
cation to be completed in time for the em
barkation on the revenue cutter Golden
Oaf* at 9:15 to o#v=s the bay for the com
mcr.eement exercises at Berkeley.
Tha reception committee. It has been 1 de
cided, v.-ill not meet the President at
Burllnganie. Instead Irving M. Scott,
chairman of the committee, will select
three or four members who will go to
Bwrlmgame, while the remainder will
meet them and the President at the Va
lencia-street station. i
There will be two receptions given the
President on Thursday after his return
from Mount Tamalpais, Instead of one, as
has been erroneously announced. The first
at 2:30 p. m., will be given at the Palace
Hotel by vhe Sons and Daughters of the
American Revolution. The second, at
about 3:30 o'clock, will be given at Native
Sons' Hall by th* Mexican War Veterans,
Loyal Legion. Native Sons and Native
Daughters.

Krom the above dispatches It is evident
that the excuses made by members of the
local committee that the President was
responsible for the absence of a Vallejo
trip from the programme of his visit are
not valid. * Secretary Cortelyou, who
speaks for the President, places the re
sponsibility directly upon the committee.

AGAINST TIME OF PRESIDENT'S VISIT
Strict orders had been given to the vet
erens who kept guard at the door to al
low none to enter or leave until the Presi
dent and his ; immediate party had gone
out. By this means a clear passage from
the door to the waiting carriage was kept
and the President was enabled to leave
the hall very comfortably. .
?, The Presidential carriage did not get
very far on its Journey before another
stop was made, this time as it turned into
â¢Forest avenue, toward the entrance to the
seventeen-mile drive.' Here. he spoke for
a few moments to the hundreds of people
who were debarred from entrance to the
Grand Army session and who therefore all
the more eagerly awaited his appearance.
At this point It was very difficult to
keep the crowd in order. : Although the
whole length o* the street over which the
President was to pass had been roped off
and officers were on hand to keep the
people back, the crowd disregarded all
checks and pressed up to the very wheels
of his carriage while he spoke.
Then the party started for the seven
teen-mile drive, but before going very far
the -President turned off, entered another
carriage. and was rapidly driven back to
the Del Monte. The remainder of thÂ©
party went on the drive."

this morning: developed Into an affair of

rations began In earnest, and before the
evening was old the halls were full of la

floated %thp music from an orchestra, and
the lobby was filled with the hum of con

ple that had found a new pleasure.
The reception was held in the hotel par

be presented and the ceremony of intro

a perfunctory one. but no one knows bet

The Reeves were to be tried in Jasper
for thÂ© murder of two deputy Sheriffs,
John E. Gardner and William Cox, on the
afternoon of June 1, 1885. The brothers, it
is alleged, escaped after committing the
crime and were not recaptured until sev
eral months ago, when they were arrested
in Illinois. Before being brought to In
diana they were incarcerated in Ken
tucky, charged with arson and bank rob
bery at Birds Eye. It is said that at this
time they secured $31,000, which they hid
before they were recaptured.
Huther, feeling that Reeves was about
to get the better of him, made a final
struggle and succeeded In throwing off
his adversary's hold so that he could
reach his revolver in a -rear pocket.
Drawing the weapon he leveled It at
Reeves' breast and shot him through the
heart
from their wrists and as the carriage
started to cross Paloga River bridge both
men sprang to their feet and leaped from
the carriage.
John Reeves was quickly overtaken,
bound and again placed in thÂ© carriage.
Deputy Sheriff Huther followed in pur
suit of George Reeves. He fired twice
from a rifle at the. fleeing prisoner with
out effect, the latter finally making an
attempt to climb a steep embankment to
get into a dense wood. Here the deputy
overtook him and a "hand-to-hand battle
ensued, Reeves using his handcuffs,
which were still fastened to one wrist,
in an endeavor to dash out tho Sheriffs

the well will have to be abandoned.
The well was being. sunk by contract
taken : by Jewett & .Blodget. The con
tractors have had hard luck and are losers
on the venture. Considerable oil has been
struck and the well was looked upon as
ah ultimate producer, but from various
causes the work has been delayed.' Opera
tions were suspended a month ago, but a
few . days ago they, were, resumed. A
pocket of gas was struck, which Ignited
and set fire to the works. It is probable
another contract will be entered into
whereby a new hole will be sunk on the
property. . . ' '

PACIFIC GROVE, May 11.â The closing
scssiohi''of the thirty-fourth annual en
campment of the Department of Cali
fornia and Nevada, G. A. R., was held
here to-day; and the veterans will leave
to-morrow, feeling: thai tne best encamp
ment in the history of the department has
been held at Pacific Grove. From start to
finish the affair has been one long suc
cess, and the entertained and entertainers
are equally well pleased.
Very little business beyond the Installa
tion of the newly elected officers was ac
complished during the day, the time be
ing occupied by the President's visit and
by preparations for this great event.
Department Commander Mott and Com
mander-elect Stone went to Del Monte to
visit the President this morning on behalf
of the veterans and arranged the pro
gramme which was so successfully carried
out this afternoon. The only other busi
ness transacted before adjournment was
the choice of Hanford as the place where
the next department encampment will be
held.
To-night the annual campflre and ban
quet was had in Monterey, and this func
tion concluded the programme of the en
campment.

Aguinaldo's life is quiet. He seldom
goes out and is always accompanied by a
guard, as there is some apprehension of
his assassination by friends of General
Luna or personal enemies.
A party of insurgents partly burned the
bridge near Lucban.Tayabas Province, on
Thursday night, but were driven back
without loss on either side. '
The department of Southern Luzon Is
sending various expeditions in pursuit of
the remaining Filipino bands. It is ex
pected that the island of Mindoro will be
occupied In the near future. Many fugi
tive .Tagalogs and a quantity of arms are
reported to be concealed in Mindoro. The
United States Philippine commission is
overrun with applications for civil posi
tions,, and the officers of the new prov
inces are submitting many questions to
the commission. The routine business of
the Commissioners is heavy. The provin
cial officers have encountered no serious
difficulties.
MANILA. May 11. -The trial of Captain
Frederick J. Barrows, of the Thirtieth
Volunteer Infantry, quartermaster of the
department of Southern Luzon, on
charges connected with the commissary
scandals, was finished to-day. The verdict
has not been announced.
Pursuit of Filipino' Bands.
. I Instances of atrocities committed by natives
upon United tSates soldiers who have become
separated from their regiments or have fallen
into their hands are too numerous to mention.
In the Twenty-sixth Infantry, Privates Dugan,
Hay and Tracy, of Company E, were murdered
by tha,town authorities at Calinogr. Private
Nolan, at Dingle, was tied up by the hands
while in a stupor, and Insurgents were sent for
and cut his throat with a sangut. The body of
Corporal rtenehy, of Company E>, was dug up.
burnt and mutilated at Dumangas. Private
CHearn, captured by apparently friendly peo-
Ele near Leon, was tied to a tree,
urnt for four hours with a slow
lire. and finally ' slashed up. Ideuteji
ant Max Wasner was assassinated on
the road to Potoan on October 1 by Insurgents
disguised in American uniform. In November
at Jaro a large flag of truce was used to entice
officers into ambush, and by order of the native
commander all persons displayed white flags in
the country where our troops operated, not for
protection, but to give warning to the insur
gents to hide their pins and disguise them
selves. Details can be furnished of butcheries
at Leganes and Mina, and of a burial alive
near Barotao Nuevo. As against . these atroci
ties, the conduct of the American troops in the
Philippines has been eo humane as to be a
continued course of surprise to all foreigners
and to the natives themselves.
Americans Follow Rules of War.
The War Department supplements the
report with these comments:
There may have been instances In which na
tive troops opÂ«ratlng on the aide of the United
States have practiced toward the natives of
other tribes the methods of warfare followed
by the barbarous or semi-civilized people, but
bo far as the department is advised, and it has
made most careful and painstaking investiga
tions into all charges of this character, the
laws and customs of war, as practiced by all
civilized nations, have in no instance been de
parted from by officers and soldiers of the
United States in the Philippine Islands.
The special report from the Philippines
was the result of an allegation made by
Sergeant Charles S. Riley of Company M,
Twenty-sixth Infantry. In a private let
ter written to a friend in Northhampton, j
Mass. Sergeant Riley described the
"water cure treatment" administered to
natives to compel them to disclose where
they had secreted arms and ammunition.
The major commanding the battalion,
the captain of Company M and Sergeant
Riley himself assert positively that no
officers or soldiers of the regiment took
part in any water cure proceedings or
other Inhuman. treatment of natives. This
has been the invariable result of investi
gations that have repeatedly been made
as to the foundation of sensational stories
sent home by soldiers in letters to their
relatives.
On a Tour of Inspection.
Secretary Root has approved a plan by
which Brigadier General Breckinridge i
inspector general of -the- United States:
army, will proceed to the Philippines for !
an extended tour of inspection. The start !
will be made about June 20, on the trans- !
port Ingalls, leaving New York by the J
Suez canal. There are a larsre number j
of military posts scattered through the i
Philippines, and it is understood to be I
the idea to get a thorough knowledge of I
their condition and needs, not only for the |
President, but with reference to the tran- j
sition stage from military to civil rule, i
which is now being rapidly brought about, j
It is expected at the War Department i
that the homeward nvrvement of the vol- !
unteer regiments In Jhe Philippines will j
begin to-day or to-morrow by the de- i
parture from Manilaj of the transports

Becelves a Mortal Wound In - :
the Encounter.
, ADIN, May 11.â Sheriff Behrens of
Shasta County arrived here this morning
on the track of Dorland and Illingsworth,
who escaped from the Shasta County Jail
April 9. A Modoc County Constable, H.
S. Walker of Alturas, met Sheriff Beb
rens, here and they located the fugitive
three miles north of Adin. -\
A hand-to-hand combat ensued. Dur
land was killed, supposedly accidentally,
by a bullet from his companion's rifle, as
he was between j the Sheriff and Illings
worth. Dorland did not shoot, as the
iSheriff had him covered, but Illingsworth
fired a score of times, three bullets pierc
ing the Sheriff's clothing-. Constable
Walker was shot through the left hip,
probably fatally.
Illingsworth escaped. Dorland's body
was taken to Adin to await a Coroner's
Inquest. -
Walker, besides being: Constable at Al
turas, is the operator of the California
and Oregon Telegraph Company's office
at that place. . .
REDDING, May 11.â Under Sheriff Rich
ardson received the following telegram at
4:45 o'clock: ;
' "Tracked fugitives sixty-five miles after
hand-to-hand fight. Constable of Alturas
probably fatally shot. . Several bullets
pierced my clothing-. Came out O K. Dor
land killed. Start for Redding to-morrow.
1 "C. H. BEHRENS."
Sheriff Behrens left here on Wednesday
for Modoc County after B. H. Dorland
and "W. C. Illlngsworth, escaped prisoners
from the Shasta County Jail, who were
reported to be" making toward Idaho.
From, the telegram, which came by way
of Reno, it would seem there were two
fatalities resulting from a desperate en
gagement. ' - .
Dorland and Illingsworth escaped from
tho jail here by gaining access to the in
sane ward, pulling out the staple of the
lock of a door leading- into the jail yard,
scaling the high wall and gaining the
hills west of town. Sheriff Behrena be
lieves friends must\have shielded the men
for ja. while afterward. Absolutely noth
ing could be heard from them for a couple
of weeks. Then they sent into Delta,
thirty miles north of Redding, for car
tridges. They were heavily armed.
Where they procured the weapons, unless
from those who shielded them, is a mys
tery. Behrens . was notified and got on
their trail west ot Delta, but lost it when
they turned upon the railroad track. It
Is now believed the fugitives followed the
track, probably at night, to Sisson and
then started east for Idaho. Behrena
heard of their suspected presence and
left here on Thursday morning for Al
turas. The encounter of this morning was
the result. Â¦

indomitable Teutonic pertinacity and
skill as a conductor to whip them up to
the mark." "Iphlgenie en AuIIde" came out
in 1774 and caused a fearful outcry to arise
from the Italianists. who tried to> prove
that "Gluck lacked all power of song and
set things to music that were not appro
priate to songr."
These are the invariable charges against
operatic performers. The Gluck-PIccInni
controversy has no Interest then except
so far as It stimulated Gluck to produce
those masterpieces which fixed the form
of French opera for nearly a hundred
years. His operas, as Mr. Apthorp points
out, are essentially grand operas; "to
produce their proper effect they need not
only fine acting and singing and a com
petent orchestra, but a vast, well-equipped
stage and the most copious spectacular
paraphernaliaâ especially a superb ballet.
They are essentially spectacular, and it Is
the prominence of this feature In them
that has most militated against them in
this country." Â«
In this over-Wagnerized agÂ© it Is pleas
ant to find a highly trained specialist who
can appreciate Mozart. "It Is not too
much to say," declares one author, "that
citly Wagner's Tristan und Isolde* and
Mile Meistersinger* can rank with "Don
Giovanni' (17S7) as completely great
â¢wprks of art; nothing else in all/X.yric
Dtama maintains itself throughout on
quite so high a planeâ Intellectually, mu
sically, dramatically."
The influence of Meyerbeer on -nine
teenth century opera Mr. Apthorp con
siders greater than that of any composer,
except Wagner. His "Robert le Dlable"
(Paris, 183D was the result of four years
of careful study; the methods of Auber,
Rossini and Berlioz; the compositions of
the old. . long neglected contrapuntists;
Victor Hugo, Dumas and the strenuous
life of the Paris of his dayâ all these were
read, marked, learned and invariably di
gested by this eclectic of eclectics. Every
body >who had anything worth taking was
laid under contribution. Yet the result
was Individual. In his methods of work
Meyerbeer was the Gray of his age; in
his results he was Dumas set to music.
Mr. Apthorp's interesting remarks on
Wagner, "The Art of the Opera Singer
and the Present,' I must reserve for a
future occasion- Enough has been said,
perhaps, to-day to show the method of
his book and the trend of his judgments.
IN "The Opera Past and Present"
. (Scribner*s), W. F. Apthorp has given
an admirably clear and succinct ac
count of the evolution of grand opera,
from "The Dafne" of Perl, brought out
in France in 1595, down to the "La Tosc !L
of Puccini (Rome, 1900). During these 300
years there has been a continuous strug
gle between the dramatic principle, which
the Florentine Camerata of the seven
teenth century rightly laid down as para
mount, and the musical principle of Ca
risslml and Cestl, which would subordi
nate both text and action to musical ef
fects. The history of this struggle is the
history of the development of opera.
To this development only four nations
have contributed anything of merit; these
in order of Importance are Germany.
Italy, France, England. Indeed, if we look
closely at the matter these four are re
ducible to twoâ Italy and Germany. For
England has produced but one musician
of the first rank, Purcell, and he (a con
temporary of Newton), though the great
est composer In Europe of his day, left no
worthy successors and founded no school.
As to France, did you ever notice that of
the four men .who have made French
opera what It isâ Lully, Gluck, Meyerbeer
and Gounodâ of thesa four only onÂ© is
really a Frenchman? Lully was an Ital
ian, born in Florence, his real name be
ing Giovanni Battista Lulli; Gluck' was a
Bavarian, born at Weidenwang (nothing
?*ery French about that); Meyerbeer was
a Prussian, whose real name was Jakob
Meyer Beer. Gotinod, moreover, is the
lightest intellectual weight of the quartet;
he is, as Mr. Apthorp points out, em
phatically a man of one work, "Faust."
Who can ever forget that dreary "Romeo
arid Juliet" evening last year, witn Melba
cold as a stone and Saleza off the key for
the first two acts? Yet their rendition
was better than what they were render
ing, for Gounodâ "a small, tenuous voice,
not devoid of a certain searching sweet

drama like 'Romeo and Juliet,' with mul
titudinous opportunities for drawing char

of his depth.
So much for France and England. Turn
we now to Italy, where, owing to the im
mensity of the field, we can take a rapid
survey of only those names that mean
something to us to-day. During the eight
eenth century Italian opera had conquered
Europe, but while doing so was dying of
formalism; it was becoming less' and
less music dra'ma; It was becoming more
and more . concert in costume. Â¦. Rossini
(born in 1792) did his best to continue the
bad traditions he had inherited:' "A man
of the most fertile melodic inventiveness,
of incomparable brilliancy, gifted with a
facility that can fairly be called damna
ble, Rossini enthroned graceful Frivolity
in the center of the lyric stage to rule
autocratically over singers and orches
tra." Yet he was^awake to the signs of
the times; the romantic movement touch
ed him as it had previously touched Au
ber; with infinite pains he produced a
masterpiece, "Guillaume Tell." This was
in 1829, whqn he was but 37. He lived
thirty-nine years longer and wrote^ â almost
nothing! The explanation? Pure laziness,
it seems. -a
Of his contemporaries.! Donizetti, and
Bellini are the only,two Â¦vtho have accom
plished work that haa Hv,^d; work that is
full of passion In spite 0^ the; undramatia
and unscenical I forms ;> In which they
worked. Donizetti is' besi known outside
of Italy by an opera ("Lucia di Lammer
mooT") that is by no meanshis best, for
there is no musical characterization in
this that can compare with that lavished
upon the part of Maffeo Orsini In "Lu
crezia Borgia." ' Bellini achieved one real
success in "Norma," thanka partly to an
admirable libretto, and one sentimental
success in "La Sonnambula" ; but on the
whole I think one must agree with Mr.
Apthorp when he declares it to be rather
a debilitating business, "this opera of
sweet sentiment, beautiful melody and
ear-tickling." Strength was sadly lacking
and this strength was supplied by Verdi,
"the hottest blooded man of passion the
art of music had known since Beethoven."
He was born in 1813 and died, you will
remember, only the' other day. His
eighty-seven years of life gave him time
to develop four distinct periods and man
ners: Of the first, the formal Italian
"Ernani" (1S44) may stand as the type;
of the second (at which most men stop),
"La Traviata" (1853); of the' third or
transition period, "Alda" (1S71): of the
fourth, "Otello" O8S7). By the) time
"Otello" was written the Wagner ideas,
of course, had become the common prop
erty* of musical Europe; to deny their
influence upon "Verdi in his third and
fourth periods would be absurd. Yet
granting that in the art of dramatic
properties Wagner was teacher and Verdi
pupil, it must equally be granted, I think,
that in two respects the pupil has bet
tered the masterâ first, lacking Wagner's
enormous conceit, he has not written his
own librettos but has found some one
really competent to'cfo it: second, he pre
served copious and fresh to the end his
spring of melodyâ a spring that in Wag
ner's case dried up many years before
his death. jA great man, Verdiâ a great
man, indeed !
The Germans. Well, we must credit
them, as aforesaid, -with Gluck and Mey
erbeer. To these two pre-Wagnerians we
must add Mozart. Of* this famous trio
Gluck, if not intrinsically the greatest. Is
the greatest in the history of opera. When
he went to Paris on Marie Antoinette's in

gospel; Lulli's antiquated forms regarded
as classic" models," and Piccinni esteemed
a great composer! "Principals, chorus and

On Thursday evening at Century Hall
an interesting recital was given by the
younger pupils of Miss Ida B. Diserens.
Miss Diserens is fortunate in having some
very talented children in her class.
Helen Dodd is distinctly one of the best
rtudents, having already a good tech
nique, remarkable grasp and poise, and
exceptional intelligence. Little Miss Dodd
played the whole of the Pathetique Sonata
by heart, also the Y/eber "Invitation to
the Dance," and accompaniments to her
little sister's violin solos. She has, like all
the pupils, one characteristic fault, that or
sharply biting off the phrase endings; and
in the first allegro of the sonata the little
player made some unwarranted altera
tions in the tempo, but It was altogether
a highly creditable* performance. Another
student with a strongly marked musical
temperament is Anna Jacobs, who gave
the Chopin B minor mazurka in an amus
ingly mature fashion, considering her
not very extended technical acquirements.
Others who took part were Florence Conn,
also quite musical; Elva "Woodman, an
other clever student: Zellah Smith, Arvil
la Thorp, Bruce Kennedy, Marion Green
wood, May Schl utter, Lurline Matson,
Ellen GiminI, Grace Gimini and Miss
Nonie Dodd, a clever young violin pupil
of Hother Wismer. All the students have
a good tone and play with nice feeling.
American music has received a distin
guished recognition this month in the
conferring of the order of the French
Academy upon our famous bandmaster,
John Philip Sousa. This is said to be an
unprecedented honor for an American
musician, and is one of the most coveted
distinctions among the musicians of
France. The decoration is conferred up
on the conductor for his splendid work at
the Paris Exposition and is understood to
represent the best French appreciation of
Sousa both as conductor and composer.
The decoration consists of a palm leaf de
sign in brilliants suspended from a ribbon
of royal purple.

VjO^/ musically interested In tbe

Buffalo. Not that we are
thereby to consider ourselves snubbed.
There are other cities as large as ours
and lightly apt to regard themselves as
of far more importance that have not
been Invited to distinguish themselves
even through one musical denizen. Of
such is Cincinnati, that, unlike ourselves,
has bands to burn, and great has been
the wrath thereat. But in spite of our
email concern in the matter and even
without the famous bscids of Cincinnati
the cause of music will be well cared for
In the great exposition.
The Temple of Music, having a Beating:
capacity of 4000, is one of the most betu- :
tiful of the exposition buildings. It con
tains a splendid example of the organ
builder's art from one of the foremost
factories in Massachusetts. The organ,
which is a four-manual Instrument and of
which I give further particulars below,
cost $15,000, and during the exposition will
be played upon by the most distinguished
organists of America.
In June the National Saengerfest 'will
be held in the Temple of Music, In which
th'e leading German- American male choral
societies will take part. Four thousand
male voices will compose the huge chorus
and the effect should be something to be
long remembered. Another chorus com
posed of 3000 children will be heard and
those familiar with the child voice in
chorus will well appreciate the profoundly
touching and rarely beautiful results that
may thus be obtained. Among the solo
ists at the festival will be Mme. Schu
xnann-Heink, the glorious contralto, and
Evans Williams.
The orchestral arrangements are on an
equally important scale. Some twenty
bands have already been engaged, chief
among them being Sousa's. which will
stay four weeks; Victor Herbert's organi
zation, which has been booked for two
weeks, and Brooks' band, for four weeks.
The Mexican Government has sent its
best band, at its own expense, to give a
series of concerts for the musical honor
of Mexico, and altogether the entertain
ment offered the music-lover at the Pan-
American Exposition will be very satis

Otto Floersheim. the Berlin critic of the
Musical Courier., prints the following let
ter of interest to us from Marcella Sem
brich to the German press concerning her
alleged loss of voice:
Marcella Sembrich, about whom the cable
reported that she had completely lost her voice
and was going to retire from the operatic and
concert stage for goodi sends out the follow
ing information to the press: "Allow me to
correct the truly American canard. I have re
turned to Europe with a somewhat obdurate
catarrh, bat otherwise in the "jest of health,
ar.d ara now already busr upon the prepara
tions for my next seaeon. The possibility of
an Italian etazione in Berlin this very spring
yet is not excluded. During the brilliant ter
mination of my tournee In America I caught a
cold in San Francisco, which necessitated
nursing and a change of climate. The Ameri
can papers, and as it would seem also some
European ones, aggrandized this into a severe
Illness, which makes me hope for a long life
and extended period of pinging. With cordial
greetings, MARCELLA SEMBRICH."
Nielsen's first appearance in London,
when the little Californian singer and her
country distinctly scored:
The Etage in London is full of mediocrities,
full of beautiful walking ladies and fashion
figures, full of fine-shaped figures whose brains
are all in their legs, but whose histrionic abili
ties are so minute they are not to be seen on
many occasions. ; It Is the "American inva
sion" that will make English men and women
of the stage actors and actresses. It is the
"American invasion" of the English stage that
will rftl England of hundreds of men and
women who have no business whatever to tread
its boards and whose presence would never be
missed were they to sink into oblivion to
morrow.
"Of Alice Nielsen and her company of
singers in the 'Fortune-teller' I have
only pleasant things to say. Her success
was immediate and pronounced, but not
owing to the generous treatment of the
gods in the gallery or the lukewarm pa
trons of the pit half crown seats. In fact,
it was uphill work for some time after
Miss Nielsen's opening number in the
first act of the opera. She had an encore,
but It ,was the insistence of -the stalls and
the dress circle that earned it for her.
As the opera progressed and Miss Nielsen
showed her audience that she could sing
as none of her compatriots have yet sung
In all the work they have presented in
musical pieces the past few years to Lon
don play-goers, the pit began to wake up
and the gallery gods began to thaw; but
in the closing scene the latter once more
grew restless, and when a repetition of
the little prima denna's closing number
was demanded there was the cry of 'time',
from the gallery, and there were fears on
the part of the Americans present that
there would be another riot again when
tno curtain fell, and there were called ont
the now seldom unheard 'boos.'
"But they had riot reckoned with clever
i Miss Alice Nielsen, who on the fall of the
curtain after it had been raised once to
disclose her whole company at the end
of the opera was next seen standing alone
in the center of an empty stage, with
some beautiful floral tributes lying at her
feet and auite filling the middle of the
stage, as the curtain again slowly rose,
with her head bent and her modest man
ner disarming any tendency there might
have been to 'boo' the little singer. She
actually fought, bit by bit, so to epeak, j
for the success she achieved, not because
it was not deserved, but because there is
still this silly feeling among the cheaper
pr:ced London theater-goers against the
so-called 'American Invasion.' As for the
invasion, it is the happiest and best thing
that ever happened to the London stage.
It has made English managers wake up
to the limited capabilities of hundreds of
their own players, and it has made Eng
lish actors and actresses fear their Ameri
can fellow artists as they never would
have feared and felt the power of the
talents of their own compatriots."

SEMPERVIRENS CLUB, not content with the appropriation obtained from the Legislature
to purchase a large tract of the Big Basin in the Santa Cruz Mountains, on which the giant
redwoods stand, has set' its face toward a still greater enterprise in the way of forest pres
ervation and has taken the first steps to achieve it. At a meeting of the club on Friday even
ing it. was announced by Chairman Reed that it is the intention to appeal to liberal and public
spirited citizens to contribute a fund large enough to purchase the entire 14,000 acres which
are necessary to round out the Big Basin Park and make it what it should be.
A movement of the kind merits cordial and generous, support. It is to be borne in mind
that a forest of the kind proposed will not necessarily entail an annual expense to the State for its
maintenance. It can easily be made self-supporting; and with good management might yield some
thing of a revenue. ,
Forest cultivation, while almost unknown in this country, is well established in some parts of
Europe and has been found highly profitable. We have repeatedly directed attention to the ex
cellent results obtained from the state forests in France and Germany and lately from the British
experiments with tree planting, in India. Those, however, are by no means the only examples of
success in such enterprises. A recent report from Europe gives an account of what has been ac
complished by the people of Orsa in Sweden in a work of the kind. That community has a forest
district which forty years ago was well nigh denuded of trees and steps were taken at that time to
properly care for it. The result has been that in the last thirty years there have been sold from
the woods $4,600,000 worth of products and to-day the forest is better than ever. It is believed* the
income will not only be permanent, but will be an increasing one owing to the diminishing, sup
ply of timber and to the better results to be expected from skill in management.
Of course no such results as that are to be expected of. the Big Basin reservation, for the
redwoods are to be preserved primarily for park purposes and not for profit, but still a consider
able quantity of wood can be sold every year and in the course of time the income derived will be
large. It will naturally increase as the woods around this section of the State , are cleared away
anfl the supply diminishes. That^ being so the expense of maintaining the Big Basin reservation
will hardly be more than that of the -first cost. The Sempervirens Club, therefore, is not seeking
to impose a burden upon the State for merely sentimental or scientific purposes, but to confer a
clear benefit upon this and all future generations. Perseverance in such a cause merits universal
PERSEVERING SEMPERVIRENS.
THE President easily sees the physical and industrial features of the State. He sees the out
ward manifestations of human energy and the great, work of nature is beneath and above
him. The splendid panoramas of flower-dotted plain and mountain uplift impress him
everywhere. But, after all, these make only the stage upon which the life of California plays, its
part and passes in a moving procession that never ends. . "^
Much has been said and written about the impression left upon this State by its pioneers, and
there is hardly anything in the traditions, romance and reputation of California about which there
is. abroad as much misinformation. To that we have, ourselves contributed. We are; in the habit
of picturing the pioneer miner with his pockets full of pistols and whisky bottles, his mouth full of
blasphemy and his hands full of cards. The lesson taught by this is that those pioneers were a
mixture of the buccaneer and conquistador, men of violence, and thirsty for liquor and blood. It
is believed outside the State, and by many new comers among us, that these violent men planted
the seeds of disorder and lawlessness- and these germs are thought to be still producing condi
tions against which the stranger must arm himself and stand gua/d. To such an extent is ,this
vain idea held that many tourists, who come now, bring weapons as a necessary part of their out
fit and are watchful and alert as soon as they cross the California line.
A few of those mining pioneers survive. They were in life's bloom and vigor when they
came;"the sap of their vernal time was. in them and care sat lightly on their shoulders. They were
thrilled by the spirit of adventure and their courage did not need further proof than was fur
nished by their long march across the plains, their familiarity with cholera and fever on the isth
mus or their battle with the tempests of Cape Horn and their struggle for life in the alternate
storms and calms of the tropics^ ; Â»
They are old men now and have the fondness of old men for magnifying their heroic days,
but let the visitor interview them and he will be surprised to know, how Jew carried arms other
than were needed in the hunt for game. He will be informed in the capacity of man for govern*
ing himself by learning of the infrequency of crime and the justice of its punishment and of the
general " security for life and property in the mining camps, where neither statutes nor locks and
keys had yet appeared. The rules they made were so at one with natural justice that when the
governments of the State and nation had to adont codes of ownership and procedure concerning
mining property and regulating its operation the rules of those pioneers were bodily adopted as
the law of the land, and every inch of mining property, clear into cold Alaska, is to-day under the
just law voluntarily made by the California pioneers.
Those men were not.the gold seekers that followed Cortez and Pizarro, snatching the shin
ing metal from the hands.of natives who had mined and smelted it. They sought it with their
own labor on the bar and in the ledge, and when the lucky miner had filled his buckskin sack
with the glittering dust it was. as safe in his log cabin as the ashes on his hearth. The-remote
foundation of the life of California as we see it to-day was partly upon what such men. brought
in the early and heroic immigration. Partly, too, it is based upon the civilization which pre
ceded them, upon the grandly simple ways of the Spaniards and Mexicans, who were the first civ
ilized occupants of the soil. Their lovely pastoral life survives only in memory and v in history. It
was not wtiat we call progressive, but there was upon it that, ineffable contentment and calm, that
simplicity of faith, that expression of reserve power, which garlanded it with charms whose beauty
grows with the perspective of time through which we behold them.
That hacienda life led by Vallejo, Castro, Del Valle, Estudillo, Peralta, Pico, Pacheco,
Galindo, Covarrubias and the other great Dons, who lorded wjth gentle sway over far-reaching
principalities, though far gone now has left its impress upon the life of to-day. The well-known
California hospitality, the faculty of our people for hailing the guest with everything that enchants
and satisfies, comes to us an inheritance from those baronial gentlemen, whose â¢ honor was as
stainless as a star and whose hospitality was as natural as their stature. Let all this be said in jus
tice to the two classes and the two races which cleared the way for the present life that makes Cal
ifornia what she is. . :

LECTiraES ON ANIMALS
Tells Stories About Yellowstone Park
Bears and Old Lobo, tho
King Wolf.
Expressly for the accommodation of the
school children Ernest Seton-Thompson de
livered another of his inimitable lectures
yesterday morning at Metropolitan Hall.
A great number of the little folks turned
out to hear his quaint stories about wild
animal life. The lecturer rehearsed sev
eral of the narratives which he had writ
ten in his book, but added many Interest
ing incidents which he had noted through
personal .Investigation. He told about Old
Grumpy and Little Johnny, two black
bears of Yellowstone Park, whose per
sonality he had studied.
Another of his narratives which excited
great Interest had for Its hero Old Lobo,
king of the Mexican wolves, which . for
merly, tyranized over the cow punchers of
Mexico and slaughtered their cattle night
ly until finally, heartbroken because of the
loss of his mate, he became careless and
was captured in a trap. The lecturer
stated that the hunter of to-day is leav
ing his gun at home and carrying with
him to the woods the camera instead, thus
immortalizing instead of destroying the
wild animals.
LONDON. May 11.â Considerable amuse
ment has been caused by the publication
of a dispatch from China saying great re
lief whs felt among- the European troops
nt the withdrawal of the Americans, who
were too free and easy for the military
ptinuette of the (continental forces. The
Daily News comments on this as follows:
"Their manners have not that repose
that stamps the military caste, of Europe.
It is painful to think how the Innocent
freedoms of the American soldier must
have jarred on Messrs. Atkins, Dumanet
and the rest."
WASHINGTON. May 11.â Tt Is the un
rfprstandinfr at the State Department that
Â¦thp American troops who remain in the
Forbidden City in Peking are very few
in number and compose the legation guard
wViich is to be permanently retained In
Peking. They are now occupying the
Fame place which they have held since
the occupation of Peking, and it Is sup
posed that they will remain where they
are until a p*Â«nanent United States lega
tion compound has been secured.
BERLIN, May 11.â Officials here say
iat the withdrawal of the American
oops from China is in accordance with
n agreement between Von Waldersee
nd General Chaffee. The officials also
say Von Waldfrsee has not reported any
recent disagreement with General Chaffee.

HONEST AMERICAN SOLDIERS
JAR CONTINENTAL ETIQUETTE
Cs-r|-Â«aHE men of Company M, Twenty-
I ninth Infantry, which was mus-
II tered out Friday at the Presidio,
ii, are extremely proud, and with rea
son, of Corporal J. W. Wilson.
They warmly commend his brave actions
and soldierly qualities, and the officers of
the regiment point to the corporal as the
best type of the American soldier and a
man worthy of. all honor.
Corporal Wilson Is' a modest fellow and
does riot care to talk of his achievements,
but his comrades are not so backward and
will talk by the hour "of the pride of the
regiment." The particular deed- of daring
of which the men delight to tell is a tale
of a gallant rescue from drowning of a
party composed of three officers and ten
Filipinos. The officers and natives were
out in a boat and lost Control of the
craft. They were drifting about and were
in great danger of being upset and
drowned -when Wilson, who was standing
on the shore 100 yards away, procured a
rope, sprang into the swiftly running river
and swam out to them. The hero fastened
the rope to the frail craft and returned to
the shore. Willing hands -were ready to
grasp the line which Wilson held, and
strong arms soon dragged the boat to
shore and safety^ ;. â¢ .. - : -
â¢" The corporal's conduct was reported by
the officers to the United States volunteer
life saving corps, and the handsome medal
which adorns the Breast of Wilson's blt.e
blouse was sent to him in recognition of
his bravery. The medal was presented to
Wilson before the entire command by
Lieutenant E. O. Perkins and the follow
ing letter was read:

The delegates from the 358 lodges of the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows of the
State of California, representing an ag
gregate membership of nearly 32,030, will
assemble in annual session 1 in the Odd
Fellows' building next Tuesday. In addi
tion to the grand officers the representa
tives to the grand body will number 639,
and it will take about four days to trans
act the business that is to be brought up.
W. W. Watson, the present grand mas
ter, will be succeeded by. "William Nieholls
of Sacramento, deputy grand master. M.
G. Gill of Red Bluff, grand warden, will
be promoted to the office of deputy grand
master. The most spirited contest will be
for the office of grand warden, which is
the pedestal on which stand those who
seek to become grand master of this ex
tensive order.' There are as candidate?
for this position C. W. Baker, of Sacra
mento, Samuel F. Smith of San Diego,
James Rye of Oakland, J. W. Linscott of
Watsonville. C. Wete of Napa and G. W.
Minstrell of Lakeport. For the office of
grand secretary George T. Shaw, the ni
cumberit, who has given satisfaction to
all for a number of years, will be re
elected without opposition. James \V,
Harris can be re-elected grand treasurer
if he desires the position for another term.
So far the only candidates named for the
position of grand trustees are the incum
bents, C. O. Burton of San Francisco,
John Glason of Gr*ass Valley and J. F.
Nichols of San Francisco. There may be
a contest for the office of trustees of the
Odd Fellows' Home, as there are tv;o to
be elected this year. Thos far but three
names have been mentioned, A. F. Jones
of Oroville, J. Morton of San Mateo and
Dr. W. F. Gates of Oroville. The other
offices are. appointive and the choice will
rest with the incoming grand master. .
The Thermalito Home.
During the past year the order has. made
a substantial gain in finance, despite the
fact that there has been a heavy call
upon the treasuries of the several bodies
to assist members in sickness and dis
tress. There has been a gain of about 803
members during the year.
The most important matter to come be
fore the Grand Lodge for discussion at the
approaching session will be the report of
the special committee appointed at the
previous session to visit places which
might be suitable -for a home for aged
Odd Fellows. . At the previous session
there was a severe attack made on the
home, which is located at Thermalito, in
Butte County, on the ground principally
that the sanitary conditions are not such
as are conducive to the health of the aged
guests at the home. The people of Butte
County, through their representatives in
the Grand Lodge, made a stubborn fight
to have the home retained where it is.
and succeeded in having action deferred
for a year. In the meantime the special
committee has visited the home, also site^
that have been offered in Alameda, San
Mateo, Santa Clara and Monterey coun
ties. An exhaustive report will be pre
sented, but it will be without recommen
dation. The people from the northern
county will again be in force to show by
argument why the home should not be re
moved from its present site, while others
will advance arguments in favor of the
several sites that have been visited by
the committee.
The following: is the list of the repre
sentative Odd Fellows from all parts of
the State, with the exception of a half
dozen lodges, "whose lists of delegates had
not been received up to yesterday. The
list gives the localities in alphabetical or

Innovations in- the Art of Furnishing That
Promise Great Popularity.
The conspicuous success that attends the intelligent direction of business
affairs is often accounted for bv the unprogressive as the result of chance,
luck, or some term equally indefinite, whereas the true facts when known '
compel the unwilling admission that brains or ideas are, after all. the respon- 'j
sible factor in compelling results. The present day is wonderful in that it "is |
the day of great achievement.
Men start with comparatively nothing but ideas for their capital, and yet,
if these be good, the enlistment of money to develop them is easily accom-
plished. Ideas are in demand, and they are the most potent factors of suc-
cess. Instances without number can be cited of wealthy mercantile firms
slowly dying of "dry rot" while younger firms with limited capital are striding
to the front because possessed of enterprise and ideas, commodities which the
former have ceased to employ.
A case in point is that of the Pattosien Furniture Company in the Mis-
sion. Established bnt a few vears. they have enforced the attention and ad-
miration of their older competitors by reason Â» of the startling innovations
they are constantly introducing. Their latest idea is one that must commend
itself to every thinking person.
It occurred to Mr. W. T. Pattosien. the manager, that if a contractor
could construct a row of flats, consulting only his own ide?s. and then suc-
cessfully place them upon the market, meeting with a ready sale, why may
not a further step be taken bv offering the buyer a flat, not alone readv for
purchase, but also for occupancv? Following this plan, the Pattosien Com-
pany have leased at the corner of Oak and Cole streets nine newlv con- "
stfu'eted flats, thoroughly modern in appointment, which they have furnished
throughout with the most suitable furniture, carpets, draperies and ornamen-
tations that could be drawn from their vast establishment. These flats nre
for rent and the furniture for sale. Each flat has been furnished in a stvle dis-^
tinct from the others, and vet all with due regard to harmonious effect and
symmetry. It is undoubtedly true that few are gifted with g thc happv faculty
of either planning the appointments of their homes or selecting these ap- -
pointments from the bewildering mass of differing styles and types found in
a large furniture exposition building which, when installed, can be said to be
in correct taste.
As opposed to this difficulty the Pattosien Company enioved the dis- Â¦
tinct advantage of the advice and counsel in the fitting of these flats of^ their
staff of assistants, each of whom is a recognized authority and specialist in
his respective department.
The result is an association of ideas representinT the most appropriate
combinations of color, fabric and texture compatible with the best taste. ThU
idea is the Vey note of this innovation, and is vital to the question of value nnd
rost. The Pattosien Company have rented not one but all of the nine flat*
?nd of course in leasing all have secured a lower price ur>on the individual
flat. As the motive is to sell the furniture, the Pattosien Company are in n
positiof. to save to the purchaser from $5.00 to $10.00 per month on the
rental. Then, ajjain. were the individual to plan th<* furnishine: of his own
home he must enlist the same servi~eof the specialist in each department of
his house, but at a greater cost, his being but an individual piece of work:
"-hereas in this case the specialist has been employed on nine nieces of work,
thereby producing a maximum of result at a minimum of coÂ«t. By a simple
nroces? of reasoning the division of expense among the nine flats must result
in tl"" 1 lowering of cost in the individui! ?.at.
Throughout the whole plan the Question of minimizine: the cost has be<*n
constantly kept in mind, so that if prospective purchasers can be s"ited with
the flats and their furnishing they certainly can be with the price. The cost of
-t completely furnished home will be a revelation to contemplating buyers.
These flats are open for inspection to-day (Sundav) and all this week until
sold. Hours g to 12 and 2 to 5. evenings by appointment. Tel. Private Ex-

OF GARF.IELD r POST
Ceremonies to Be Held at Grand Army
Plat in, Odd Fellows'
Csmctery.
The veterans of James A. Garfleld Post,
Grand Army of the Republic, have de
cided to hold services this year at the
Grand Army plat in Odd Fellows' Ceme
tery on the morning of Memorial Day,
and they will .not therefore form any part
of the parade or ceremonies at the Na
tional Cemetery, Presidio.
They have also determined to accept no
part of the $503 appropriation made by the
city, preferring to have the post treasury
pay all expenses. This action . has been
taken by Garlield Post for. the reason that
its members feel that memorial services
should be held under the auspices and
control of the living comrades, whose
loyal hearts are in harmony with the ob
jects of the day. - â¢ - % â
It is also the intention of Garfleld Post
i to hold evening services in a commodious
! hall, to which the public generally will be
cordially invited. A proper programme
: for this purpose Is now being prepared,
which will consist of vocal and instru
mental music rendered by the best obtain
able talent, appropriate recitations and an
oration by one of our most eloquent pub
lic speakers. Â¦ â¢ ' . '
The efforts being put forth by Garfield
Post to make these observances perfectly
in keeping with the day will not only add
luster to its prominence as. a. -patriotic
body but will- afford thousands of our
citizens who visit Odd Fellows' Ceme
tery every Memorial day an interesting
and Instructive object lesson of the love
living comrades of the war show for their
soldier dead. /
The post committee consists of General
Edward Salomon and Sol Cahen, past de
partment commanders; A. E. Cohr. com
mander; Adjutant Frank Elliott Myers,
Chaplain J. H. Hilton and Comrades An

this morning at the post- room.
PETITION FOR AID TO
IMPROVE MISSION BOAD
Property-Owners Ask Board of Super
visors to Make Appropria
tion.
The property owners on the. southern
section of the Mission road have forward
ed to the Board of Supervisors a petition
for the improving of that thoroughfare
from Silver to Onondago avenue. For this
contemplated work they ask the Super
visors for an appropriation of $16,000. The
wording of the petition makes the propo
sition clear. It is as follows: "
The Mission road Is the main outlet from
the city, the only practicable route to the
jcemeterles and the natural and most fre
quented route for all traffic southward from
the city. Its condition during the winter
months is deplorable, caused by the excessive
and heavy traffic thereon. ' Tho I property
owners have already expended on the road
about $8 per front foot for grading, macadam
izing, sewering and widening, and : are . still
ready to contribute toward Its maintenance ;
but in view of the character and volume of
the travel it is impracticable to keep portions
of. the. road in good repair with macadam and
the property-owners consider It unfair to com ;
pel them, at their cost, to put down a perma
nent pavement to accommodate the through
travel -to and from the city.
The cost of a permanent pavemertt between
Silver and Onondago avenues will be . about
132,000. This outlay would place the worst por
| tlon of the road permanently in good, condition.
The property-owners propose to raise' by . sub
scription about J63CO, and feel assured that they
can raise from patrons of the road about. $3500,
and think that the city should appropriate
$16,000, considering the importance of the road
I and the public character. of the travel thereon.
The results of yesterday's proceedings
left the general aspect of the strike situ
ation unchanged. Meetings cf both em
ployers and employes were held and each
; seemed confident of victory. The possi
1 bility of a general strike is now exceed
ingly remote and the labor leaders are
positive that they can accomplish their
ends by other methods.
The Cooks' and Waiters" Alliance held
a very enthusiastic meeting at 300 O'Far
rell street last night and was' addressed
by delegates from sister unions. All
promised the heartiest support, both fin
(incially and otherwise: Representatives
from the Butchers' Union stated that
they would give all possible assistance
I and even walk out if it should be deemed
expedeint. Several smaller restaurants
have requested union cards and union em
ployes from the alliance, although none
of the larger establishments have as yet
acceded to the demands of the strikers.
About 800 cooks met at the Turk-street
j Temple' last night and considered meas-
ures for settling the strike. The union
voted unanimously to abide by whatever
decision the executive committee might
make. About $400 was collected in aid of
those now out. The plan which was ap
proved was that adopted by the leaders
of the Labor Council. This plan is to
avert a general strike unless new develop
ments appear. The method of campaign
is to call out a number of men from those
branches of trade which supply restau
rants and thus cripple the service of all.
Means will be adopted, however, that the
union -places shall not suffer. It: is con
sidered that this worrying process will
better advance the cause of labor than
a general strike, which has been contem
plated and urged by many previous to
yesterday. ; â¢
The Bakers' Union makes the statement
that the employes of six large bakeries
will be called out to-day. This will in
volve nearly 100 men. The complaint is
that the bakeries on which the strike is
made have been supplying non-union
houses, contrary to agreement.
The attitude of the Labor Council is
set forth in the following communication
to the. public: < "'
Nothing of special importance has developed
within the last twenty-four hours. The en
deavors of the Labor Council continue as be
fore along the lines of peaceful adjustment.
The favorable signs, Â¦ however, now apparent
might shortly result In the speedy adjustment
of <the cooks' and waiters' disputeâ unless the
sinister influences at work for some time past
step in and prostrate the work being done.
Stronger and stronger Is the expression of
support to the Labor Council in its conserva
tive course and that Iead3 the men' in charge
to believe that the next twenty-four hours
will materially contribute toward the final re
sult. That result seems favorable to peace.
Let every one wlih a desire for fairness act.
The Labor Council still stands ready as be
fore to confer with the other side; it still
stands ready to Insist on "hands oft." But
every move of the other side will meet with
a counter move* and then the fates only can
tell where it -will end. The executive com
mittee of the Labor Council has matters In
charge. To-morrow morning at ,10:30 o'clock
the adjourned meeting of the Labor Council
will be held at 117 Turk street. More definite
action will then no doubt be taken.

RED MEN HONOR THE
MEMORY OF TAMMANY
Large Crowd of People Entertained
. by Music and Ora
tory.
The musical and literary entertainment
and dance given by the tribes and councils
of the Improved Order of; Red Men in
celebration of St. Tammany ' day in Na
tive Sons' . Hall last night attracted to
that place" an audience that filled the hall
to ita limit". Tha programme included the
following, numbers:
Address, . Great Sachem F. D. Brandon: bary
tone solo, "William Brown; "The Red Man,"
Kmilio Lastreto, specially written for the occa
sion by Professor Carl Sawvell; vocal solo, E.
A. Greenblatt; ventriloquism. Professor ,Wil
liam A. Butterfleld; barytone solo, Horace Tor
mey; tenor solo, Richard H. Hunt; specialties.
Professor -B.', I. Barnett; basso cantante, ' Will
U Smith.
There- were ten numbers on the dance
programme and its was midnight before
the council fire was quenched.
The reception and floor committees were
composed of -F. -Petersen, K.-H. Culver,
H. C. Wehr, Miss K. Cunningham, C.S.
Graham, . M. ; Bloom. Mrs. iM. Seaberg,
Miss C. Li. Johnson, F. D.Ritchie, L. Gran

was- enwrapped In the manuscript of the
sensational melodrama, and, better still,
he had the center of the stage and the
limelight was full upon him.
Â¦If the play comes up to the rehearsal
it will score a hit. Terry McGovern is the
bright particular star, and he shines with
EIGHT HUNDRED COOKS HOLD SESSION
TO CONSIDER THE STRIKE SITUATION
The play is replete with sensations and
the dialogue is full of clever sayings. Two
villains, a tough girl, three Chinamen, a
Hebrew merchant, an : Irish â¢ policeman, a
Dutch woman and other characters make
it a production that is certain of success.
a brilliance that surpasses the Iridescent
glimmer shed by his diamonds. Terry is
feather-weight champion of the world, but,
like Corbett, Jeffries and that honest old
blacksmith red-haired Bob Fitzsimmons,
he has hopes of making- a name in the
histrionic world. . .
Marvelous Ducking of Bouquets.
No Whisky for Terry.
Terry is modest on the stage. He knows
â¢when to sidestep from the center when a
brother actor has the stage, and he does
not blink or fret when opera-glasses are
leveled at him. He gesticulates with as
much grace as he displays in the ring.
Even in rehearsal he warms up and leads
Â¦with either hand. His ducking of the
bouquets shied at him, in the course of
the play is marvelous. . :
But Joe Humphreys is. the "goods," as
he would put it.. Owing. to the poor man
uscript it was necessary for some one to
teach the actors the business. Sam Harr
ris delegated this important task to the
announcer, and Humphreys accepted it
with pleasure.
The first, rehearsal he attended won
him fame in the eyes of the entire com
pany. Humphreys, after "sizing up" the
aggregation, made his little bow and ex
patiated at length on the fine points of the
drama. Growing eloquent, he said: "Say,
when Terry rescues der goil in. der fort
act der guys out in front go nutty. Dat
ladder scene is der limit. Yer see, Terry's
goll is in a hop joint, and he rubbers
around and pets wise dat the villyun is
coin' to moider her. Den. he climbs up,
and der blokes pipe him and try to give
him der double-cross by trowing down the
ladder, but dey is foiled."
On being introduced to Miss Fay Court
ney, the prepossessing- young lady who
has an important part in the play, Hum-
to the front with several gushers of the first
order, and Southeastern Ohio made a. gain of
50 per cent over her record of new - produc
tion In March. This section, out of a total
of 130 wells completed. Is credited with forty
nine dry holes. Over 37 per cent of the wella
completed In Southeastern Ohio during April
proved unproductive. : .
Other Combinations.
The Hollister Bee reports that the fol
lowing, companies were represented at a
recent meeting for the purpose of con
solidating interests In the Panoche. Silver
Creek and Vallecltos districts: Fresno,
Isis, Morning Star, Franklin, Corbett,
Olally, Oro Fino, Los Angeles and Meracle
& Corbett.- A committee of eleven was
appointed to 'Â¦consider the project of con
solidating the companies. The following
named companies in the Kern River dis
trict have combined to construct a pipe
line to convey their oil to the railroad:
Chicago Crude, Toltoc. Senator. Sterling,
Sovereign, Globe anu Euclid.
Oil lands in the southwestern extension
of the Los Angeles field have just been
sold at the rate of $S00 per acre.
.phreys excitedly said: "Hully gee! dis is
a funny - colnsky. Why, der dame wot
1 played dis part in New York was named
Courtney." During one oC the acts Mr.
Humphreys wanted two of the actorS T to
pose and make a pretty stage picture. He
yelled to them:- "You two guys frame
yerself." His advice to the man who im
personates Charley White, the - famous
referee, was as follows: "You , does der
refereeing. You gets in and makes a
sneak under der ropes and goes, into der
ring and sizes up the two culls, and den
yer have a adlib talk before the audgence.
( Den yer gives der timekeeper der hand
and he sounds der gong." Miss Courtney
asked one of her fellow actors to repeat
a line so she could get her cue to -come
on. Humphreys told her "to cut dat out
: - and to "take her tip when der guy was
trew chinnin'." , - , Â¦ â¢ 7;*."^
Terry's strongest line is sprung on the
audience in the third act. He enters the
highbinders' headquarters and finds a bot
tle of drugged whisky on the table. Â¦Â¦Â¦ The
gallery gods hold their breath -for fear
that he will be knocked out, and when he
picks the bottle up. smells it and says.
"Whisky, hey? Dafs der stuff dat skilled
many a good one," every one breathes
more freely and there is boisterous ap
. plause. "
OIL PRODUCERS
READY TO MEET
Petroleum Association's
Annual Meeting Is
Called.
Various Localities Giving Evi
dence of Faith. in tne .
Future.
The directors of the California Petro
leum Miners' Association have decided to
call the annual meeting -of the,associa
tion for June; 1L : There are sixty com
panies belonging^ to the association and
there are individual members also. Anew
board of director 'will be elected; at the
annual meeting, and there are several in
teresting matters to come . up for. consid
eration. Â¦ The association has been -in ex
istence a vear.
The Pacitic Oil Reporter figures that the
ten more tank's that the Standard Oil
Company is reported to have ordered for
use in the Kern .River district will, with
what tankage it has already there, give
it a capacity for storing 555,000 barrels of
oil " in tnat district. Tnere are now five
37,00u-barrel tanks erected in the field be
longing to the Standard Oil Company and
the muteriaJ for others is on the ground.
W. S. Miller, the Pacific Coast manager
of the Standard, says he does not, believe
the oresent price for oil will continue
much. longer and that it is too low. ; This
statement will not in ail probability pre
vent, the oil producers from going on with
their organization on the principle that
the first duty of a man in ousiness is to
help himself and not depend upon some
â¢one else to do his work for him. .x
Mr. Miller has something of interest to
say concerning the iiast, where there is
no fuel oil, all tha product belns needed
for illuminating purposes. If Texas, he
says, can produce a great amount of fuel
oil there is no doubt that it will come into
immediate competition with coal In the
great manufacturing States along the
Atlantic coast, but it will never come into
competition with California oil as fuel.
The Texas oil will probably be sent to
tide v/ater through a pipe line and then
be transported in tank steamers â¢' to dif
ferent cities in the East. Â¦ It would cost
$2 per barrel to transport oil from. Texas
to California. The California product is
superior to that of Texas for 'fuel.
I. Facts of the Field.
A co-operative oil company is being
formed at Grayson, Stanislaus County.
The capital stock is $24,000, divided into 3U0
shares at a par value of $JJO per share. No
one is to be permitted, to subscribe for
more than live shares. The shares are to
be paid for at the rate of $10 per share per
month,' and the first payment is due on,
May 10 next to J. R. McOonald of Gray
son, who will be the agent until the cor
poration ia formed. The total amount is
to be paid in monthly Installments before
any work is to be done. With the work
ing . capital thÂ© lncorporators are to pur
chase land that is favorable for the pro
duction of oil in paying Quantities, if
after 200 shares have been sold Â¦' it is
deemed not advisable .to sell the re
mainder of the shares the 100 shares are
to bo placed in the treasury for the bene
fit of the stockholders.- The agreement is
not to be binding unless 200 shares axe
subscribed.
V Subsequent to the discovery of seepages
near Cooperstown, so says ., the Modesto
Herald, a promoter giving the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank as reference arranged to
bond tracts !of land along the seeming: oil
belt. Later analyses of the . "seepage"
ended the negotiations, however, the au
thorities pronouncing it not oil.
O. Lowe of -.Woodland has offered to
deed eighty acres of land to an oil com
pany that will sink a well on his land, the
deed being- contingent upon the discovery
of oil in paying quantities, and he will al
so subscribe $100. The purpose is to have
a -Well drllled.at Woodland.
According to the New Era work is pro
ceeding with day and night shifts on. a
well at Corning. There is a gas flow from
the well.
More Natural Gas.
At Carriso Creek.
The Fresno Democrat reports the dis
covery of a floTV of natural gas on Mrs.
McMullin's ranch, whicn is situated west
of Lane's Bridge. The Democrat says that
a well was drilled to a depth of 162 feet
for water and when the water was struck
gas came up to the surface. The gas has
been lighted and burned brilliantly.
When the incorporation papers of the
Los Angeles Oil Producers' Association
were filed with the County Clerk $3310 had
been subscribed of the capital stock. The
association is capitalized at $20,000, the
stock being divided into 2000 shares of the
par value of $10 each: The Los Angeles
producers are giving out that they do not
fear the Kern River field producers, the
reason given being that Kern River can
not sell much oil in Los Angeles. The
handling of the association's oil will be
based on an agreement. of the producers
to deliver the oil as soon as it Is brought
to the surface and that the manager of
the association will market if as instruct
ed by the directors, who have ample
power. The contract will probably run
for three years. Once before Los Angeles
has faced a price of 45 cents for oil. Then
the wells were shut down and the price
went up in three daj-s to $1 per barrel
A. L. Wollberg, who is a director in an
oil company that has located a large tract
of land in the Carriso Creek district in
San Diego County, says:Â«^The next thir
ty days I- feel assured will" demonstrate
that this is the richest district in the
State. We have received many applica
tions for land, but they have invariably
been turned down. If the value of the
Kern River land amounts to from $1000
to $5000 an acre, a person owning an acre
in thfe new district will be independently
rich. Our company, which is composed
of prominent business men of this citv,
has secured 27,000 acres of patented land
for oil. Tho company expects to com
mence operation in. the near future. It is
composed of the following named busi
ness men: M. M. Ogden. J. V. Coleman,
R. R, Grayson, E. H. Michels, J. J. Ler
rr.an. H. M. Gorman, Charles, Sonntag, J.

Owen, J. A. Ferson. J. Strassburger, R
J. Curr, John W. Gray, W. A. Jacobs and
Charles, W.' Mueller. . M. M. Ogden, who
has been investigating the land, claims
that . he'. never has ' seen indications so
numerous and so promising."

wells that were drilled last year in the
Mattole Valley, and that preparations are

CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 11.â As thÂ«
culmination of a bitter struggle between
the Longshoremen's Union and the line
agents in this city that haa been on sine*
early spring three longshoremen to-night
assaulted and shot one man, Frank La
vigne, inflicting a serious wound In tha
eye. Two other men, it is said were hit
by flying bullets. i
The trouble arose over ihÂ» refusal of
the line agents to treat with the Long
shoremen's Union over the unloading of
vessels. The work has been given to
contractors,, and the contractors hava
hired men other than the regular long
shoremen. This has aroused thÂ© bitter
antagonism of the latter. - -
The Injured man, with several others,
was engaged In unloading the steamer
Mahoning, when three longshoremen
came upon the dock and began shooting.
Lavigne was hit In the eye. His fellow
workmen got away without injury. But
one arrest was made.

Still, on the whole, I had little serious
trouble In understanding what was said
to me. It needed only a little ingenuity
and a few questions to get at the English
meaning. When It came to making the
English understand me, however, it was
a very different matter. ! I found them
anything but agile in interpreting unfa
miliar phrases. It was only after repeated
failures to persuade the 'bus conductor to
"let me out" at- a specific crossing- that
I learned to say "put me down," which
worked like a charm.'. I asked a booking
clerk for. stopover privileges, and he
stared in amazement. I might "break the
journey" if I liked, but what did I mean
by "stop over?" "Return trip" only served
to elevate i everybody's eyebrows. . I soon
learned to replace it with "How much
for the? round?"- Nobody understood me
when I asked how many blocks or squares
It' was to the cathedral. But if I - said,
"Can " you direct me to the cathedral?"
out came. the concise reply, "Top of the
street, second turning to the left. You
can't miss it." In Warwickshire I tried
to send my too cumbersome trunk ahead
by express. The porter assured me this
was impossibleâ there was no -such in
England. "Freight?" No, he didn't know
anything about freight. It took, the pene
tration of the hotel porter to fathom my
difficulty and supply the magic 'words
"goods train." In London I attempted
to buy a pair of silver cuff buttons. "I
don't think we have the article, madam,"
said the perplexed clerk. "Sleeve but
tons?" No better. "Cuff buttons, sleeve
links?"' Still no success.. /Things to fas
ten your cuffs with!" I cried at last in
desperation. Slowly a light broke over
his countenance. "Ah!" he exclaimed,
"you mean solitaires!'' and he dldn t mean
diamonds, either.
Again,' needing a paper fan for steamer
use I Inquired at a pharmaceutical chem
ist'shop where fans were to be- found,
and was directed to a fruiterer and florist
hard by. An . unlikely place, thought I.
However, In I went and demanded a fan.'
"Certainly," " said , the obsequious shop
keeper, "but do you require one In a pot?"'
They â¢ thought I said "fairn" to rhyme
with "bairn" and that, in their , dialect.
Is spelled f-e-r-n. Only by saying "fahn'*
should I get what I wanted. I hastily ex
plained and was < directed to the estab
lishment of H. Quick & Sqn f silk mercers,
linen drapers, haberdashers and uphol
sterers, where I found my article in the
Ironmongery, department. :
' Perplexing, ; even. vexatious, as are these
misunderstandings, they are not without
their compensation. If our conversational

headed countryman who refuses to j abate
one tittle of his Yankee vernacular. â Bos
ton Transcript. ' V v ;
phrases I noted in my diary, and unrav
eled them one by one. They y were:
"Steam â¢ roundabout," "a fall for. travel-
Ing," "annual sermon," "cubicle" and
"chocolate sandwich." The sandwich I
ate; it was a layer cake. The cubicle I
investigated, and found.it to be a tiny
bedroom. The annual sermon, I found on
inquiry, did not mean only one sermon
a year. The fall I bought, and it proved
to be a veil. Lastly I refused to have
anything to do with a steam roundabout
when it turned- out to ! be a rampant
merry-go-round. 1
It Isn't alone the accent, nor vet the
Inflection, which makes the English of
the English puzzling to American ears.
It Is the very definite and inflexible way
of saying things. They speak by" the
code. When it rains it is "a dull day,
isn't it?" When the thermometer mounts
into- the eighties it is "close." The weather
is "thick" when the mist creeps over the
landscape, or "fine" so long as It doe3
not actually rain. So universally patron
ized are these neat and convenient, if not
always adequate, formulas that in using
any other expression one feels quite in
decently original. To a London landlady
one scorching July day I observed that
the morning was "hot." Could you have
seen the stare Â¦ of well-bred amazement
with which she replied irreproachably, "It
is close," you would not wonder that I
registered a vow to try my own methods
no more. Â¦ . ' - . . - v ;
But the expressions are not only un-
Americanly uniformâ they are pretty uni
formly un-American. Ordinarily that ' Is
all the trouble there is about it. The
phrase is intelligible enough, but strange.
For Instance, when vou are told that the
yelling mob of public school boys who
pack the trains on the 1st of August are
going home for the "haulldays" you get
a momentary shock. We have the holidays
so closely associated with frosts and
Christmaslng that it is ham to realize
that the word may be properly applied to
the dog days. Again, when the landlady
at an Inn, In answer to your request for
rooms, plumps out her ready-made phrases
"We're full up!" there is no chance for
misunderstanding. . So with . .'.'fire assur
ance," "message boy ,Â«- " "keeping ring'*
(guard ring), "secret bed'' (folding bed),
etc., all. very logical, no doubt, but likely
nevertheless, when . first you meet tnem,
to give your brain a turn. ,
Now and then, however, you encounter
an expression by no means simple of com
prehension. When,, on the dizzy top of
my first London 'bus, an inoffensive look-
Ing English woman turned to me and said
stiffly, "Thank you!" I did not under
stand her. Twice she repeated with stern
emphasis, "Thank you! and half .rose
from her seat. Â¦ Then I saw that she
wanted to pass me. The remark was a
request the first time, a command the
second. But how, pray, was an Ameri
can to know that? Even the simple words
"up" and "down" proved too much * for
me when I found them marking the plat
forms of a suburban station. Being bound
for the north I selected the side placarded
"Up Trains." Presently a porter came to
me and demanded abruptly,. "Where
for?" "York," said I.- A shade of melan
choly crossed his Â¦ face. * .''You'll 'ave to
cross the line by the bridge, miss; this" is
the hup side." I protested I. was going
due north, and. would by no means take
a down train. "Well, you be going from
London, be'ant you, miss?" retorted the
porter, as If that settled It. And, indeed;
if did. Â¦ North, south, east , or ..west, , it's
*'up" to London; and, "down" to â¢ everyr
thing-elsa in the. island. On another oc
casion I came near being dashed to death
by a pursuing hansom; because, forsooth;
I stood still when, the driver yelled '"Hi!
hi!". To me, "HI!" meant; "Hold on,. there,
I want to speak to you, 1 ,' so I Incontinent

"The Eastern syndicate thinks well of
this portion of California as a field for

and out Into the adjoining country, rather
than toward the heart or the city. This
movement has been particularly notice
able of late down the peninsula from San
Francisco to San Jose and the projection
of the electric road into that territory
will add an immense and powerful im
petus to this movement. It Is understood
that the line will be completed to San
Mateo within a jvear and to San Jose just
as rapidly as rights of way can be ac
quired and the roadbed constructed.
The legal matters connected with the
negotiations were conducted by Attorney
General Tirey L. Ford on behalf of the
purchasers and by Morrison & Cope on
behalf of the former owners.

The makers do not advise the use of
Grape- Nuts Food alone, except in ex-
treme cases like this. It Is better, as a
rule, to make the -breakfast of three or
f our, heaptog teaspoonfuls of ' Grape-Nuts
with soml good rich cream, together
Â¦with a little cooked fruit and some
Postum Food Coffee. At midday have a
little meat and some vegetables . and at
night have the same meal as the break-
fast. This sort of a diet will cure stomach
and nervous troubles in 90 cases out of

WISE HOTEL MAN.
Wife Put Him Bight.
All hotel men, as a rule, are healthy, but
once in a. while they are subject to
Etomach trouble like the ordinary mortal,
and It Is interesting to know what they
do to provide themselves with proper
food.
In the case of Mr. McKee of the
Wheeler House, Howard. S. D.. he finally
got down to Grape-Xuts Food alone, and
lived on it for a little over 6ix inontbs.
He speaks of some wheat foods and other
cereals that be could not digest, but
Grape-Nuts is pre-dlgested and easy for
the weakest kind of a stomach, bo that he
got well on It - Â¦
He writes at length, giving a descrip-
tion of his years of sickness and his final
cure by food. He says he had become
completely discouraged, as he could not
retain any food and digest it Finally his
wife heard of Grape-Nuts Food and
urged him to cat some of it and. nothing
else. He says: "I quickly. began to gain
in flesh, and my skin took on another.
color. I stuck to Grape-Nuts and noth-
ing else for over six months. I gained
25 pounds, began to sleep naturally, and
have gotten quite well.
"After a while I began to eat plain food
again and fe!$ no distress. The Grape-
Nuts regulated my bowels and cured
me of the old headache." '

LOS ANGELES. May 1L-The body of
Mrs. Grace Sefton Winters lies in an un
dertaking establishment and her husband,
I. Ross Winters, is detained in the City
Jail on suspicion that he murdered her,
he having admitted that he shot her, but
claimed that it was an accident. " The cir
cumstances attending Mrs. Winters'
death are such that her husband's story
will not be accepted by the police with
out a searching--' Investigation and-Detec
tives Auble and Rich felt warranted in
placing Winters under arrest.
Winters Is a laborer about 28 years old.
His wife was- 22 years of age. They lived
at 734 South Workman street, {laving mar
ried two years ago. After their marriage
Mr. and Mrs." Winters both took out In
surance policies payable to one. another
for 11000 each.' Shortly after Winters had
taken home the body of his wife to-day
he" notified E.- W. Schmidt, the general
agent fot the company, of ' the accident
and .presented" a claim for the insurance
oh his wife's life.
At first the prisoner said his w'ife was
shot accidentally while they were out on
a hunting trip, his gun having fallen and
been discharged. Later he changed this
story several times.'
The charge of shot at close range tore a
gaping hole In her side, just back of the
left breast.
One -account was that he had crawled
through the barbed wire fence- into a
field where he believed there might be
good shooting. He left his shot gun on
the- other .side of thÂ« fence, and his wife
asked him if she could not bring it over.
He consented, but cautioned her to be
careful. He heard her say "All right, I
will." That was the last remark she ever
made. Winters heard the roar of the
shot gun and turned to see his wife in the
convulsions of death on the ground.

Merrier Grows Feud Between
Gage and the Orosser of
the Rubicon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 11.â The whale
town Is talking over the extraordinary,
and, to some, Inexplicable ignoring of
Governor Gage during the visit , of the
President to Los Angeles. "Where Is the
Governor?" was asked by hundreds of
citizens on Wednesday afternoon and
Thursday morning during the parades.
The Indignity Is resented by citizens/who
realize that the public has been "insulted
by the affront put upon the State's chief
executive.
The conviction prevails that General H.
G. Otis Is responsible for the engineering
of the slight to Gage: that he imagined
that during tM> President's visit he would
he able to pay off some old scores, and,
In particular, punish Henry T. Gage, who
had â¢â¢ presumed to resent his vicious at
tacks. Certain it is that General Qtis
usurped the position of plenipotentiary
extraordinary on behalf of President Mc-
Kmley and assumed a dictatorial attitude
toward the executive committeeâ a dic
tatorship which, with a few exceptions,
eeems to have been meekly accepted.-
Otis Designed the Parade.
Two weeks ago General Otis set his mil
itary mind at work concerning the forma
tion of- the parade for the President's re
ception on Wednesday afternoon. The
result was a diagram which was hajid
ect to Major E. F. C. Klokke and dis
patched to General Last, grand marshal
of the'parade. General Last's account of
the interview that succeeded . Major
Klokke's arrival is as follows: " .â¢â¢,Â¦!
Major Klokke handed me this piece of parch- i
ment, sayinsr: "General Otis presents his
compliments to you, General, and offers this
as a suggestion for the formation of the pa
rade of which you are to be grand marshal.''
I examined the diagram and told Major
Klokke to Inform General Otis that, while I
appreciated his courtesy, the formation of the
parade was my business and I believed I was
able to attend to it without assistance.
On further examination of General Otia' dia
gram I discovered that no provision was made
for the Governor of the State. I turned to
Major Klokke and said, "What about the Gov
ernor? Where is his carriage?"
Major Klokke' 8 reply was, "He is not com
ing." â¢
How Major Klokke or Â¦ General Otis knew
that the Governor was not coming, except that
he had not been asked, I am not able to say.
The Governor was very loth to' talk
about the matter at all, except to posi
tively declare that he had never received
any written invitation to take part in the
proceedings, but at the eleventh hour he
had been approached by Messrs. Laugh
lin and Rule, when it was impossible for
him to change his plans. The interviewer
referred to the out-of-the-way position as
signed to Governor Nash and the Ohio
visitors during the floral parade.
"You don't mean to tell me," exclaimed
the Governor, "that the Ohio party were
not given seats near the Presidential par
ty! This is the first I had heard of It. It
certainly seems an extraordinary arrange
ment."
Last and Laughlin. Disagree.
General Last had an opportunity to-day
to talk matters over with the Governor,
and was asked: "Do you think that the
Governor was deliberately slighted during
the President's visit here?"
General Last's reply was very emphatic:
"I not only think so, but I know It, and I
am also convinced that the people aro
very indignant about it. I am also con
vinced that the whole, thing, was de
signed."- ".-'â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦-,Â¦ ''^ : - T'^' "â¢'Â¦Â¦Â¦". : .
Homer Laughlin. chairman of the recep
tion" committee, thinks that the persons
who stood in the recent Presldentiallime
light were the persons who k ought to have
stood there. He believes ..that the. right
persons rode in' hi3 : carriage in the- two
parades. Mr. Laughlin. was asked: :
"Don't you believe that when the Presi
dent comes to a town the Governor of the
State and the Mayor ought to ride in his
carriage?"- -- â f
"I suppose some people might look at it
in that way. But the committee got *up
this pageantâ we did the work and raised
the money. You will find that the chair
men of the committees" are often chosen
to ride with the guest of the occasion.
My committee thought I was entitled to
the honor, not only as chairman, but on
account or my twenty years' acquaintance
with the President."- â
Â¦The Governor left for the north . this
evening. He has accepted . an invitation
to take lunch with President- Benjamin
Ide Wheeler at. tho University of Cali
fornia on May 15. to .meet the President.
He will dine with the Ohio Society, but it
is not known If he will accept the invita
tion of the Union League.

POWEB. OF THE EXPERT DTJH".
Thinks Any Bill Could Be Collected.
Kindly Creditors Not TJn-
common.
"I don't doubt," said a bill collector of
long experience, "but that the most hard
ened of debtors can be made to pay by
persistent dunning. Continual dropping
will wear away a stone sure; the only
question is, will it pay to keep the water
dropping? In this as in many other
things it is not a question as to whether
the thing can be done, but as to whether
it will pay to do it.
"Many a man who has, or fancies he
has, teat a creditor out has really es
caped paying only because the creditor
has made up his mind that it would cost
more than it was worth to collect the bill,
and so has stopped, though he knows well
enough that he could collect it by keep
ing at it. long enough; for, as a general
proposition, no man is really invulnerable
to all the possible varied forms of con
tinuous dunning, if they were resolutely,
unnuggingiy and year after year, with an
evident purpose of continuing indefinitely,
applied. I repeat that what saves .the
debtor who does finally escape paying
is. not his own cheek or bluff or imagined
indifference, nor even his poverty, if that
be the real reason for his slowness in pay
ing; what saves him is the creditor mak
ing up his mind not to spend any more
monew on 'him'.. ...
"But there "are some creditors who
make it a matter of business or principle,
or whatever you mind to call It, to spend
any amount of money to collect debts due
them; and I think myself that this Is a
wise way. Not because it gives me work,
but because I think it's' good sound busi
ness practice. I like the business method
that consists in the collecting of bills at
any. cost. The man thus persistent may
in some cases spend- more than a bill
amounts to to- collect It, but he doesn't
often have to do this. Withouj; any ex
planation or setting forth of the creditor's
that his creditor Insists on having what
Is due him just as I know that he will in
sist on it. This isn't a case of getting
out of him what you can or seeing what
you can do with him, or trying to collect
the bill â it is a case of .a settled, firm de
termination to collsct it, and I know and
feel it, and the debtor realizes, it;. and he
pays, and often promptly. I believe that
this creditor, who insists, at any cost, on
collecting, collects after all at a smaller
average^ cost than the the creditor who
only will spend so much' on a bill. 1
"As to the dunning of a 'debtor,' I think
that it is all right to dun him. I know
that for myself I haven't the slightest
squeamishness over my work as a-collec
tor.. I think not only professionally but
personally that a man ought to pay his
debts. To be sure the best intentloned
and at the same .-time most level-headed
and Intelligent of men sometimes, through
force of circumstances, get into deep
water, and for the time may be unable to
pay; -but if . they're square men, who in
good faith mean to pay. they are likely to
be met in the same spirit and not hurried.
'You might be. surprised to know how
many creditors there are who would say
in such circumstances: 'You tell So-and-
So not to fret himself for a minute about
that bill: to pay it when he. gets ready,'
or, 'tell What' s-his-name that I don't care
if he never, pays.' . It's a fact. I can tell
you. If you don't know it of your own ex
perience, or observation, that there's a
heap of decent people in the world. ;
. "And aÂ« to the slow but square debtors,
they pay. almost to a man, though I don't
mind telling you that even- among them
there may be now and then one who needs
prodding a. little, gently. - ;
"A- help in collecting debts In these days
has come Â¦ out ' of the * application of the
payment of them on the principle of pay
ments for goods bought on the installment
plan. I suppose there are now more peo
ple than . ever who. pay v debts .piecemeal,
and I like the method very much; it's an
everlasting ' sisht better; than not payins
anything: there is no creditor but Â¦ what
would prefer to get his money In that way
rather, than not at all. . And while I don't
set- myseu up- as the grand' adviser and
counselor of those who- owe money as
to what is right and proper, I . say with
out hesitation/ that no man need, feel
ashamed of paying a debt in Installments:
his payments, however small, will be wel
comed, he may be .sure. ; Suppose I held
for. collection, -for Instance, a bill againsf"
a man for 550 and ; he should gi ve " me a
dollar every time I called. - Wouldn't that
be satisfactory? Well, I should say yes.
"But I do think one thins certain. â¢_ I
think a man ought to pay his debts, and It
doesn't disturb me a bit to ask a man<for
i~e ; money.' 1 â New York Sun. /

Conspiracy to Kill a "Wife.
PHILADELPHIA, May 11.â Dr. Thomas

with conspiracy to kill his wife. Several
days ago the police were notified by Paul
Schroeder, a private detective, that he

who had left him. Schroeder asserted
that the doctor wanted him to inject

SCHWAB OPPOSES
UNITED LABOR
Steel Trust President
Explains Corpora
tion Plan.
"WASHINGTON, May 11.â Oharles M.
Schwab, president of the United States
Steel Corporation, was before the Indus
trial Commission to-day. He said that
the United States corporation' controls
eight companies by owning" their stock,
and that while steps are taken to insure
the good will and co-operation of all these
companies, each one generally Is left to
conduct business in Its own way. As a
rule the plan had been to take in only
companies which were not competitors,
but it was true that tnere were cases in
which two institutions of the same line
were brought together, and in such case
the managers were expected to get to
gether in making plans for sales.
Enumerating the advantages of consoll
dationr Schwab said they were found espe
cially In " transportation and management
and injhe utilization of all the ores own
ed. In this' connection Schwab said r that
the United States corporation owns 80 per
cent; of tfce iron ore of the country, and
expressed the opinion that these ore de
posits must constantly grow in value, be
cause limited. The company makes from
65 to 75 per. cent Ot the steel products of
the country. He also said that there had
been no increase in the price of products
since the organization of the United
States corporation, and that the tendency
is toward lower prices.
Discussing the tariff, Schwab expressed
the opinion that In articles of manufac
ture in which labor does not enter as an
important factor the tariff might be re
moved, but in products into which labor
enters largely.. such, for instance, as tin
plate, it would be necessary either to re
duce wages or lose trade if the tariff were
removed. He thought that except on the
Pacific Coast ' the removal of - the -tariff
would not. interfere with the â¢ production
of steel rails and billets. Schwab took a
position agalnst : organized labor, saying
that it did not give individuals a fair
chance in life. - â¢,
Schwab said it was the purpose of the
parent company to control the subsidiary
organizations in harmony, but this was to
be done by indicating the officers of the
various concerns. "There may not be so
many names of influence on the boards,"
he said, "but the management will be ef
ficient." - Â¦ Â¦ â¢â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢"'â¢
No Details of the Trust.
Schwab" excuses himself from speaking
concerning the details of the organization
of his company, once or twice saying that
questions concerning capitalization, pre
miums, etc., should be asked of Morgan.
"I do not know the steel trust,' he said
when some one designated his company.
Â¦ In a general way he would say that the
company is organized upon the same plan
as the "Federal Steel Company, but he
did not consider' the .company.-over-capi
talized. He said the assets of each of the
subsidiary companies had increased in
value since their organization, and that
the popular estimates did not place a suf
ficient value upon the mines owned by. the
company. -He also stated in this connec
tion, that the company owns 60,000 acres
of Connellsville coking coal land, and
that in. its iron mines there are 500,000,000
tons of ore in sight. ' _ ...
He, thought a reasonable profit on.this
iron ore would" be $2 a ton. Asked how
long he thought these mines would be
able to meet the demand, Schwab placed
the limit on the iron ore' at thirty years
and on the coal at sixty. Each of the
constituent companies, he said, makes its
own purchases and its own sales. In a
word,',' he. said, "the. United- States . Steel
Corporation is a clearing-house to which
its: constituent companies go for informa
tion." - â¢ ; ;: . . ' :. Â¦ â¢
Sells ' Goods at Lower Price.
He admitted .that the company * sells
many of Its products at a lower price in
foreign markets than at home saying
that this .practice is followed to hold the
markets.. -.* . * :,_ A ,â Â¦
â¢ Regarding -the relation of the tariff to
the .steel Industry, :he said- that upon the
whole he did not desire, to have the tariff
changed in any respect,' considering it en
tirely satisfactory as at present arranged.
Asked for his opinion as to the effect of
the enactment of. the BaJbcock bill, tak
ing the duty r off trust-produced articles,
Schwab" expressed 'opposition, to it. He
did not consider as possible an interna
tional iron and steel combination regard
less of all tariff restrictions. -..-- ,: : : â¢
Discussing the relations of â¢ capital to
labor he said that while he would not un
dertake to outline the future policy of the
steel. corporation, he did not indorse the
policy -of the labor organization, as in the
interest' of laboring men themselves. He
did hope, "however, to so .arrange matters
that operatives could .'share in the profits
of the enterprise. Instead of being a-det
riment, he considered the big corporations
as. affording the best openings. for labor
and enterprise. . , ' ' â¢
-'"There" were -never such opportunities
for-them 'as to-day," he said. .."If ( I: were
a" laboring man, as I once .was, I should
not want I to belongs to a labor, organiza
tion :4f employed by a properly managed
corporation jike- the 1 steel company,: for I
would not' want, to be put on a level with
the coorer workiiwn In the' establishment.
The tendency is to give the highest possi
ble price for proper services, and no mem
ber- of a labor organization" is in al posi
tion to avail himself of snch disposition."
He said the average of wages paid now
by the steel companies is higher thanpre

of wages,' but of the management of busi-

long and dramatic trial, Charles H. East

ted to-night on the charge of murdering
his brother-in-law, Richard Grogan Jr.,

The Jury, after listening for nearly three
weeks to a mass of testimony, followed
by two days of argument, debated five
hours and a half before reching a verdict.
When the verdict v/as announced there
was a demonstration among the 150 spec

able to suppress for some minutes.

ness, with which the labor unions wanted
to interfere. . . Â¦ ;
Schwab expressed himself as opposed to
the publicity of the accounts of corpora
tions and said he had no legislation to
suggest for the regulation of corpora
tions. He consideredÂ«them of value both
to the investor and to labor, and thought
they were calculated to extend business.

In all likelihood Miss J. "Wade will be
elected by the Board .of Education to suc
ceed Miss Amy T. Campbell as vice prin
cipal of the Jean Parker, formerly the
Broadway Grammar School. Miss Camp
bell has been promoted to the principal
ship of the school made vacant by the
resignation of Mrs. Jean Parker, who will
assume a responsible position in the State
Normal School.
While the appointment of Miss Camp
bell will not take effect until July 22 it
is almost certain that Miss Wade has
been selected for the vice principalship.
It is understood that she is assured of the
votes of Directors Klncaid, Casserly and
Penman, but Mark declines to commit
himself, as he thinks the time when the
appointment will become effective is too
far off to make a selection at the present
time. A successor to Mrs. Parker was
decided upon in advance. Mark says, in
order to avoid the political pressure to
which the board would be subjected if
it delayed the appointment.

the board recommends that arrangements
be effected for its 'completion. In his re

â¢ "The amount of grading to be done. on
this '"block has been , estimated at 36,300
cubic' yards, .the cost of which; excavation
being mostly .'rock, at 40 cents per yard,

Edward A. McKay, secretary of the I
firm of McKay & Co., lumber dealers,
was found dead in his room yesterday
irerning and under conditions which lead
to tfaa belief that he committed suicide.
Carbolic acid was found in the dead man's
stomach and a half empty bottle of the
corrosive poison was discovered under a
washstand in- the room. Thus far no rea
son has been irfven why the man should
Jiavc destroyed his life. . ' Â¦ . .
McKay resided at 712 Shotwell street
He was found dead by his sister, Mrs.
LopBie, Â¦fc-hen she went to call him, that
paper-hangers might commence the work
of renovating his .rpom, . . Â¦Â¦
Cororrer's Deputies Flynn and Smith In
vestigated the case, and while there was
no ii.dicaiion that the man had drank
carbolic acid, still the presence of the bot
tle was suspicious. Coroner Leland at
ence ordered the body to the Morgue and
an autopsy performed. Dr. Bacigalnpi
found carbolic acid in the stomach and
ihe Question of poisoning was settled.
McKay was 41 years of age. So far as
Is known his business affairs were in good
condition. The only plausible reason for
the suicide is that the man destroyed his
jife while intoxicated. He bad been drink
ing heavily of late and was drunk when
he came home Friday night.

bine and -make sure of its success. The :
company employs 1000 men a*d the option
Is for upward of $5;000,000. The company
has opposed the trust, but will sell rather

had a contract with an exhibitor. Word
waa at once sent to Director General Bu

A meeting of the Building Trades Coun

It was decided that unless the lumber i3
removed from the grounds forthwith
every man employed on the Manufactures
building will be called out. If this action
does not result in the removal of the "un

facturers of Kansas City struck to-day
for a nine-ho^r day and an. Increase of
12*2 per cent In wages. The strikers' com
mittee in a statement issued to-:day say:
"The strike is not local. On the 20th of
May. If the demands of the machinists
are'not acceded to. every union machinist
in the United States, Canada and Mexico
will walk out. Tbe trouble goes back a
year or more, when the international
tody of machinists made an agreement
with the National Metal Trades Associa
tion .whereby, on November. , 20. the ten
hour da v was to be cut to nine and a
half hours, and on May 20 this year to
nine hoyrs. Kansas City merely takes
the Initiative. The walkout will occur all
over the country if the National Metal
Trades Association dees not concede the
points we demand." .-- -
The strike was precipitated by a local
firm discharging four union men.
: CHICAGO. May 11.â Eight hundred
members of the Machinists' Union to
night decided to demand of the National
: Metal Manufacturers' Association, an in-
I crease of 12% per cent on the existing
scale of wases. The new scale Is to be
come effective Mav 20. on which date the
law of the machinists making nine hours
a day's work will go into operation
throughout the country.
The decision reached to-night affects
C500 men in and around Chicago. There Is
no likelihood of a strike because oZ an

replete with the inevitable coon songs,
was rendered cy a number of well-known
amateurs, ' who" have achieved some dis
tinction in their several lines. The first
part was well staged* and was composed
of thirty boys dressed in "Tommy Atkins"
costume and twenty-five, young men, in
cluding eight end men in relays of four, in
the circle presided over by George Cheney
as interlocutor.
The end men are W. W. Brackett, Elton

Clarence Freed, Ed Hogan, Denny Jordan
and G. H. de Pue. Some of their jokes
are original and others aboriginal, but
they are all well told. Lloyd Spencer won
the house with his singing of a comic
song, "Just a Little Bit Off . the Top."
The sentimental singers are George Che

P. A. Dunworth, and their selections are
all pleasing to the ear.

alleged to have stolen. Captain of Detec

telegraphed to â¢ the ' police authorities at

// W \\ the St - Nicholas Hotel, at Mar-
A. V JJL ket and Hayes street, is. ac
cused of having Â¦' stolen $23,000
belonging to the Doolittle corporation dur r

was sworn out yesterday for his arrest on
the complaint of J. H. Doolittle/ manager
of the hotel. >
Knowlton is a brother-in-law of Doollt|
tie, being married to the latfer's sister.
In Grand Army circles and in railroad of
fices Knowltonis well known . ....."
When Colonel Ira W. Doolittle took pos
session of the St. Nicholas Hotel in July)
1894,. he placed his son-in-law, Knowlton;
in the position of cashier. Knowlton for
many years was connected . with the"
Southern Tacific Railroad Company and
was at one time ticket agent in the Bald
win Hotel and also traveling passenger
agent.' When his relations .with the road
were terminated he was given a position
by Colonel Doolittle at the latter's hotel
in Woodland and afterward came with
Doolittle to the St. Nicholas. â¢ - '
For seven years Knowlton has ! handled
all the funds of the St. Nicholas and not
until ten days ago did his peculations
come to light. Knowlton was fond of high
living, but his honesty was never .ques
tioned. *
Toward the end of last month Knowlton
went on a prolonged spree and his broth
er-in-law determined that his erring rela
tive must leave the hotel. Doolittle re
ceived the consent of his mother, Mrs. Ira
W. Doolittle, that Knowlton should be dis
missed. On asking Knowlton for a settle
ment of his accounts Doolittle was in
formed that there might be a slight>short
age. Knowlton's hint was the clue that
led to the expertinjr of his books and the
startling discovery was made that the
cashier had carried on a system of pecu
lation" for seven years, the total of his
defalcation reaching $23,000. ' . .
Refused to I*r?ave the Country.
The books showed that Knowlton owed
more than $S00 in "bar tags'.' and when he
was asked to make this good he refused
to do so. When Mrs. Doolittle and h*r
son learned of the gross deception played
by Knowlton it was decided to give him
a chance to leave the country," but h'e de
fiantly decided to remain. He went to
Watsonville, where his. relatives live, and
negotiations were carried on between At
tornev Meyer Jacobs, representing the
Doolittles and the accused, man. Knowl
ton admitted his crime but refused to take
any steps toward restitution. He refused
to turn over to his wife and daughters his
interest in his father's and sister's estates,
amounting to $2000. but deeded these inter
ests to other parties. <:
Again Knowlton was given a^ chance to
leave the country, but he refused to do s-q,
and yesterday Mrs. Doolittle and her son
decided that he should be arrested and
punished for his offenses.
The system by which Knowlton defraud
ed the St. Nicholas Hotel was to make
false entries in the cash book when post
ing the items of receipts from the daily
cash blotter. Â¦ The experts have so far
discovered more than 1000 false entries,
ranging â¢ from $20 to 5120. The difference
between the genuine /and . false entries
went into Knowlton's pockets and it, Is
known to his relatives that the money was
spent in riotous living:.
. Mrs. Knowlton is prostrated with fe-rief
at the disgrace brought upon her by her
husband and her brother and mothfr also
bitterly grieve over the offenses of thuir
relative. " Â¦Â¦Â¦
Defalcation May' Reach $5O,OOO.
It was stated at the St. Nicholas Hotel
yesterday that Knowlton's defalcations
might reach the sum of $50,000 and until a

In. a. recent first exhibition* of _ the first
scene, now . completed, I the " curtain rose
upon a view of the plains of Bethlehem,
with the city of the holy nativity sleep
ing in the distance on the hillside.' A
bright moon shone out and gradually sank
away behind the hill:- a pale blue light
suffused' the stage like an afterglow, and
then the stars came out, and the star of
Bethlehem, with almost majestic realism,
grew in,, power and seemed to cast' rays
over a tiny cottage in the far â¢ distance,
proclaiming the birth of the Savior. This
scene holds one spellbound.- * ' t . -â¢Â¦
. Owing to :the scope of tho work and the
interest it has excited there has been- a
great demand for, tickets. It was at first
intended -to issue complimentary tickets,
but the cost has been so large that a small
admission, fee will- be Â¦ charged. ? In fact,
the requests for tickets would have re
quired a house many times; the capacity
of. the theater. In order to add strength
to the cast several of the graduates of the
institution have been prevailed upon to
take part. The District Attorney of Santa
Clara County, James H. Campbell, will
create the character, of King Herod; Clay
M. Greene, the author/will enact the part
of Dathian, the tempter of Judas, and
others now prominent in business and pro- â¢
fessionol' life, whose names ..will , be an- j
nounced first on the programme, will take
part. S There will be special, train service
from this, city during , the jubilee and on
the evenings of the "Passion Play."
Kenna early entered into correspondence j
with. Clay M. Greenq pn this subject, and
that well known at once be
came- much interested in it. As Â¦ the i
plans matured tjie enthusiasm 'grew, so j
that finEully it was resolved to give the
ulay'jn the best possible manner, although
it v/ould involve a. large outlay. Only by
a visit to the college theater can one real
ize the magnitude of the* work.- Even in
Its preparatory stage it has occasioned no
liitle surprise at . the costly scenery and
accessories. And the mental effort to
train more, than 100 people so as^to per
form their I parts with sufficient power,
dignity Â¦ and impressiveness is far greater
than would be required in the. production
of an ordinary play. 3Vtr. Greene .is giv
ing the preparation his personal attention
and is greatly assisted by. the enthusiasm
of 'nil wno are to take part.
Michael' O'Sullivan,' a well-known scenic
artist, has already been two months upon
the paint frame and his department is al
most ready for public approval. The en
tire stage of the theater has been remod
eled, so that there will be no delay in
shifting, and .to accommodate the many
scenes all the modern improvements in
stage mechanism were rendered neces
sary. The electric lighting arrangements
to enhance scenic effects are thorough.

The visitors were scheduled to arrive
!n the morning, but their plans were
chcr.ged at Los Angeles and the special
train did not reach the depot at Third and
Townsend streets until 6 last eveninjr.
A delegation of the Ohio Society of this
city was on hand to receive the chief ex
ecutive of the Buckeye State and those
Â¦who accompanied him on his trip across
the continent, while many ladies and gen
tlemen who are natives of Ohio were on
hand to extend greeting to the advance
guard of San Francisco's euests.
The Ohio Society was represented by

California.
When the special train of five Pullman
cars- glided Into the depot a . shout Â¦ went
up from the waiting crowds* and a rush
was made for the rear car, where Gover

Adjutant General Seamans of the Cali
fornia National Guard had accompanied
the Ohioans from Los Angeles and j es
corted them to this city as the representa

The delegation of* the Ohio Society
formed in a group at the steps of the
Pullman car as Governor Nash alighted
ci:d cheers rent the air as he stepped to
the ground. With marked gallantry Gov
ernor Nash assisted Miss Helen Deshler
to reach terra firrca. and all eyes were
centered on the young lady' who is to
christen the battleship with the name of
her home State.
The ninety r.nd more Ohioans who trav

As soon as the distinguished visitors :
had . removed the traces of travel and
dined they started out to view the sights
of the city, renewed old acquaintances,
went to the theater or rested from the
nerve-rackine ride.
The majority of the delegation will leave
for San Jose in the morning and wiU take
every opportunity possible to acquaint
themselves. with the needs of the Garden
City. One Important point that will be.
considered during the trip is. the improve
ment of Alviso Slough in order that San
Jose may be given water connection with
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast. ! The
citi:.ens of Alviso are urging the claims
of that village, located practically at the
headwaters of the bay of San Francisco,
as a gateway and distributing point of
the- rich country that lies beyond. Trips
to Mount Hamilton and other points of
interest in that section are also sched
uled prior to the arrival of the Presiden
tial party.
Monday's Engagements Postponed.
It was originally intended that the Ohio
delegation of Congressmen and those
from other States who comprise the party
should meet the representatives of com
mercial organizations of this city at the
: Chamber of Commerce on Monday after
noon. Invitations had been extended to
every organization of importance in tha
city, and It was expected that all interests
would be represented. When the delega
tion arrived it was found that nearly
every member had made other arrange
ments with a view toward meeting the
President on his trip from San Jose,* and
.in consequence it was found necessary to
postpone the meeting to some future date
convenient to the arrangements of the
distinguished visitors.
As soon as the members of the Â¦commit
tee can make these arrangements the date
will be announced, but all invitations for
the meeting of Â¦ Monday afternoon have
been canceled.
Congressman Nevin has the distinction
of being the first Republican to be elected

FLYCASTERS MAKE A
NEW AVERAGE BECOBJ)
The regular competition of the San
Francisco Fly-Casting Club, held at Stow
Lake yesterday, was productive of the
finest average In delicacy ever made by
ten men. The average was 86 2-12, In a
* strong west wind, and some of the cast
ing was more than remarkable.
Golcher led in distance, dropping his fly
120 feet out into the lake, Brotherton be
ing second with 113 feet. Brotherton was
the most accurate, his .percentage being
91.8, with Muller a close second with 91.4
per cent. Towsig led in delicacy. Follow
ing is a summary of the contest:
The Lowell High School, represented by
Norman Hodgkinson and Carl Gardner,
carried off the honors in the annual ten
nis tournament for the championship of
the Academic League. Oakland High
School got second place after making a
very fair showing in the finals against the
winners. At the last moment Gardner
was substituted for Al Rosenberg:, who
â¢was unable to play on account of ' sick
ness.
Eight teams were entered in the doubles
and eight in the singles, but In the lat
ter only two matches were played. The
schools represented were Lowell High,
Oakland High, Berkeley High, Alameda
High, Palo Alto High, Polytechnic High,
St. Matthew's and Boone's Academy.*
In the first round Taylor and Creed of
Oakland High School defeated Llllenthal
and Smith of the Polytechnic High, the
score being 6-3, 8-6. In this match Smith
was substituted for Harold Mann, which
change weakened that team materially.
In the second match Towne and Sloan
of the Palo Alto High School proved to
be much too strong for Caldwell and
Kenyon of Boone's Academy, whom they
defeated, 6-2, 6-1." Hodgkinson and Gard
ner of the Lowell High School completely
outclassed Lewis and Valleau of the Ala
meda High School, beating them in
straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. The last match of
the preliminary- round proved to be the
closest of the day. In it Esterly and
Cavalier of the Berkeley High School
were pitted against Freeman â¢ and Ben
nett of St. Matthew's. After a long, con
test the latter finally won, 7-5,. 3-6, 8-6.
Bennett, who was little bigger than his
racket, wielded that instrument with the
strength of a man of twice his size.
In the semi-final round Taylor- and
Creed, O. H. S., disposed of Towne and
Sloan, P. A. H., the score being 6-0, 6-2.'
In the other half of the round Hodgkin
son and Gardner put a stop to the aspira
tions of Freeman and Bennett, St. Mat
thew's, by beating them in straight sets,
6-3, 6-3. â¢
The finals,', in which Hodgkinson and
Gardner, L. H. S., and Taylor and Creed,
O. H. S., came together, brought out the
best tennis of the day. The Lowell men
took the first two sets handily and it
looked very much as if. they would make
it three straight, but then the Oakland
men took a brace and won the third set,
6-3. The Lowell men, realizing that they
were up against' a good team, pulled
themselves together and took the last set
easily, 6-0. The complete score of the
match in favor. of Hodgkinson and Gard
ner was 6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. .
The singles were started,. but. owing to
the lateness of the. hour had to be, post
poned when but two matches were'com
pleted. . In singles Valleau of Alameda
High defeated "Kenyon of Boone's Acad
emy," the score being '6-4. Cavajier of
Berkeley. High beat Bennett of St.. Mat
thew's," 6-4. The Remaining matches in sin
gles will he played next Saturday morn
ins on the courts of the California Tennis
Club at'9:30. ; Hodgkinson, L. H. S., Is a
strong favorite for first honors in the sin'
gles.

LONDON, May 11.â At Kempton Park
to-day the great Jubilee handicap of 3000
sovereigns was won by George Edwards'
Bantoi. Caiman was second and Aivescote
third. Santoi's victory completely upset
calculations. William C. Whitney's Kll
marnock II, on which L. Relff had the
mount, was a warm favorite, and Richard
Croker*s Harrow, ridden by J. ReifT, wa3
also considered dangerous. Greenan led
until a quarter of a mile from home, when
Santoi 'drew to the front and won by a
neck and a half. A half-length separated
the second and third horses. Kilmarnock
II was fourth. The betting. previous to
the start was 25 to 1 against Santoi, 9 to 1
against Caiman and 100 to 6 against Aives
cote. -
The Kempton Park May auction plate,
of 200 sovereigns, was won by Frank
Gardner's chestnut colt Omaha II (bred
in the United States), with Clem Jenkins
in the saddle. :â¢ 'Â¦-. '-'.â¢ Â¦;.
the track at Emeryville yesterday
and waved a merry welcome to the throng
that filled the grand stand and clubhouse,
for everything and everybody seemed to
conspire to make this Fabiola Derby day
surpass all others. Evidences of Mr. Wil
liams' liberality and forethought were
everywhere visible, from the large Fabiola
flag flying from the tall staff in the center
of the trackâ his gift to the hospital as
sociationâto the beautiful. decorations of
the clubhouse. In the latter broad bands
of satin ribbon in blue and white were
festooned about the' walls and from the
chandeliers, and silken draperies of the
same colors, adorned the back of each. A
small stirrup and strap, tied with blue and
white ribbon, held each, yellow satin cur
tain in place- In a position of honor on
the long center table stood the beautiful
silver cup given by the ladies of the Fabi
ola Hospital Association as a trophy for
the gentleman's race. The cup was won
by Mr. Ledgett, who received it from the
hands of little Amy, Long, the pretty 3
year-old daughter of General Oscar Long.
The little lady was daintily attired in blue
and white and performed her proud task
with? childish grace. / . #
The clubhouse and the Judges' stand
were also gayly outlined in blue and white
bunting. The day. was cool. and pleasant,
the. -track fast and the undercurrent of
feeling that the day was devoted to a
charitable purpose made even old habitues
of the racecourse enjoy the x afternoon
with an added zest. . -
Ladies of the 1 Fabiola Association were
present in large numbers, as well as many
prominent Oakland people who are not
members but who take a great interest in
the well-known hospital. Generous dona
tions were sent by many who were unable
to attend. Aside from the donations, how
ever, the gate receipts/which Thomas H.
Williams Jr. so generously turned over, to
the Fabiola fund, amounted to $2129.

Betting in the ring was exceedingly
brisk and old-fashionedlike, and no com

ning the Fabiola cup, 1 offered for gentle
men riders. He had the mount ?f or the

in the betting, won all the way. "Well up
the finish Mr. Bates took the place from
Whaleback with ' The Buffoon, second
choice. Periwig, the mount of Mr. Skin
ner, received extensive support, but the
ex-jumper was outclassed. . Â¦ .
According * to the handicappers Ada N
and Maresa figured so closely alike that
each closed at odds of 5 to 2 in the betting
on the first event," a . Futurity course
sprint. â¢ Ruiz early picked a pocket to fall
Into with Maresa, and Ada N was slower
to get In motion than a freight train on'
some jerkwater line. In consequence J.
Ransch on Grafter won very handily at
18 to 5. In a drive Russell brought Ada N
up in time to beat \Flatterer a head for
the place. â¢
Eleven single- X maidens started In the

Joyed the call, and getting away well was

invincible, Rory .went to the post a 6 to 5
chance, with Hafley In the saddle. Lead
ing to the paddock, almost, he was then
collared and in a mild ' drive - downed a
head in 1:01%. The .winner was.ridden'by
Bassinger and came In for steady support
at odds: of 3, to 1. The Giver ran an ex

PERFECT racing weather, the
presence of the usual Saturday
crowd of racing enthusiasts, aug
mented by an extended list of vis
. Itors from Oakland's fashionable
circles, all tended to make" Fabiola day"
at. Oakland track an unequivocal success.
As a pecuniary reminder of the occasion,
Thomas H. Williams Jr. presented the
lady management of Fabiola Hospital
with a check for $2129,' certainly a most
substantial tribute to the generosity of
the California Jockey Club.

Down near the end of the card Geary's
Ireland was played for a cinch against
P. M. Curtis* Anchor. As grood as 9 to 1
was offered that Palo Alto's brother could
get the flag. Willing and anxious, Ireland
took the lead and after he had scored
three It looked reasonable that he would
fulfill predictions and Quite handily, too.
Anchor, however, got possession by the
hare coming to him and held his position
until the finish of the course, keeping: his
opponent from further scoring:.

CHARITY REAPS REWARD FROM
FABIOLA DAY AT OAKLAND TRACK
YALE DEFEATS
HARVARD TEAM
Annual Athletic Con
tests Between the
Two Colleges.
Interest Sustained Until the
Last Event, Which Was
. Decisive.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 11.â Yale de
feated Harvard this afternoon In .art excit
ing series of track events constituting the
annual meet between the universities.
The contests, were; spirited throughout
and interest never flagged. The games
did not begin until after 3 o'clock, but
were finished before 6. The score was:
Yale o7, Harvard 47. The final and de
cisive score was made in the last event,
the pole vault, up to which decisive con
test Harvard had a diminishing lead.
The great surprise of the day came in
the two-mile race. Yale had concetled it
to Harvard and- Harvard's men were run
ninc in the first mile as if it were only a
question of who of them was to set the
race At the seventh lax> Richardson set
a fast spurting pace. Teel of Yale caught
him in the stretch and in the straiKnt
away passed him, clearing several feel at
the tape. Gay of Yale came in third, mak
ing a total of six points for the blue
where onjy one had been hoped. The Tf ale
record In this event was broken
The 100-yard dash proved a tight to the
finish between Hargrave of Yale and
Lightner, Hatght and Webb of Harvard.
The former won from the last Quarter or
the dash by an outlay of energy that waa
not exaected. He repeated the perform
ance in exactly the same way in the ZÂ«
yard dash. In that event Dupeeof Yale,
a former crack sprinter, also came to time
in sensational fashion, winning second
place.
The mile run was Harvard's easily,
Weston of Yale being unable to catch
Clark, who was well paced.
In the broad jump Spraker of Yale did
pot do well. He was outclassed by the
Harvard contingent, three of whom di'
vided the event.
In the high jump Spraker beat Ellis of
Harvard. The shot-put was taken by
Yale easily, Sheldon, Goss and Becks
shutting out their competitors with good
distances. The hammer-throw was also
Yale's entirely, with Stillman, â¢ Sheldon
and F. Gordon winning: out in order. The
pole vault' went at the comparatively low
height of 10 feet 3 inches to Yale. Hord,
Peaco and Thomas tied at that height.
There were thirteen\ events scheduled
for the afternoon, and points were scored
as follows: Firsts 5, seconds 2, thirds L.

San Francisco 3, Oakland 2.
Sad was the wind-up of the game at
Recreation Grounds yesterday afternoonâ
for the Dudes. Until the eighth inning
they had victory, wings, tail feathers and
all, but the game was not yet over.
In that round the local team came to
the bat and something happened which
proves that such a thing as luck exists
Jn this world. Schwartz reached first on
a fielder's choice, Krug following with a
two-bagger. Then Holland hit to left and,
Dunleavy dropping the ball, Schwartz
scored, Krug going to third and Holland
to second. Then Pabst rolled out the bail
to right, scoring Krug and Holland, it
looked as if Holland had been put out at
the plate, but Umpire Donohue said no,
so the game was won. Lohman kicked
hard and lone without. result.
Kru'g's brilliant work at short has not
been surpassed this season. He caught
seemingly impossible flies, covering miles
of territory. His throwing was likewise
of the sensational order. Iburg pitched
a splendid game, allowing 0>ut five hits.

The general committee of arrangements
Mrs. Rose declared that the cruel treat
ment of the child was a matter, of noto
riety about the neighborhood. She fsaid
that on one occasion he- had been forced
to sleep out in the open all night in a
rainstorm. _ . . _ â¢
Mr. Bird is an employe oflthe Southern
Pacific Company. The family; has lived
in south Berkeley about three months.
"I gave the child breakfast and then
sent him to â¢ school. When he returned
heme his mother locked him up and went
away. At' 5 o'clock his elder brother let
him out and he came to me. Knowing
how cruelly he was treated at home, I
kept him and \was working with the'So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty : to
Children of San Francisco to have him
taken from his parents, .when- Mrs. Pres
cott came. His father has threatened me
with San Quentin . for keeping - the child,
but I could not bear the thought of let
ting them beat him."
Child Leaves Home.^
Mrs. Rose told a different story. She
said: "Last Tuesday â¢ morning when my
husband got up at 5 o'clock to go to the
city he found Harry shivering on the
perch. The child was cold and hungry.
He said he had slept In the Ashby-avenue
railroad station-house all night. , This we
can prove, for we have witnesses who saw
him. . â¢.'-â¢ . . â¢â¢:â¢
and came over. I went to the house and
demanded the boy. They* denied all
knowledge of his whereabouts, though he
was there at that very time. Mrs. Rose
ran screaming across the street to Dr.
Allen's house. I followed her, and she
finally told me that Mrs. M. J. White at
tho Parfott building in San Francisco
knew where the boy was. I Immediately
recrcssed to San Francisco and the police
helped me find Mrs. White, wife: of the
secretary of tne Children's Aid Society,
though the hour was then very late. Mrs.
White told me that a womon, apparently
insane, came into the office, and, giving
tho name of Rose, said she had a boy
concealed In her house. V
"I came backhand this morning went
wjth Marshal Kerns to Dr. Allen's â¢house.
He denied all knowledge of the affair, as
did the Roses. Then I went to Oakland
and got Mrs. Prescott. She came out and
in twenty minutes found my child in
Rose's house."

W. M. Bird, the father of the child,
lives opposite the Rose home at 2328
Lorena street. He said:, ,
"My boy was enticed from home. I
don't know why, but he was, and he was
kept in conlinement by Mrs. J. J. Rose
right across the street from us all the
while we were hunting for him, from
Tuesday afternoon till this nrornins:. This
is the way we found him after keeping
the police all around the bay stirred up
and going nearly crazy ourselves: Miss
Lombard, â¢ the principal of the school
where Harry attended, told my wife yes
terday that Mrs.- Rose knew where -the
child was. My wife went there, but they
would not let her in. Then she came over
to San Francisco and told me what she
had heard.
BERKELEY, May 11.â Two strange and
conflicting stories are told regarding the
disappearance of seven-year-old Harry
Bird from his home in South Berkeley
on Tuesday. One is a story of motherly
protection for an illy treated child, the
other a story of threatened kidnaping.
The child was this morning taken from

by Mrs. L. A. Prescott, president of the

his note about four years ago for $300.
He has never been able to pay interest

LOVE'S LOTTERY
An opinion was current among the Con
gressmen that Senator Hanna could not
be elected if nominated, and that he had
the same idea, the reason being that his
wealth amounts to several millions.
"'Whether he would be a good President
or not would not figure in face of that,
was one view expressed.' "A man with
that amount of wealth would not get the
votes of the great majority of the peo
ple."
For the Heath Ftory there was noth
ing but ridicule. The idea v.-as strongly
grounded that Senator Hanna has been
consistent in his denials that he would
accept or would like a Presidential nomi
nation and that he. unquestionably re
mains in the same frame of mind.
practically the same statements to the
members of his own political faith. Con
sequently the Ohio Congressmen, whose
opportunities are better than those of any
other person to know what Senator
Hanna"s political wishes are. simply rid
iculed the Interview that Perry S. Heath
g-ave out, _j
The former First Assistant Postmaster
General might not have been pleased to
hear the expression of ideas entertained
Ly the Congressmen. They made it clear
that they thought that he fancied that he
â¢would gain the favor of Senator Hanna
by fevcophancy. They had no idea that he
â¢was "actuated by any motive other than
to help himself politically, although one
Congressman suggested that there might
be in the interview simply an attempt to
gain greater publicity. Mr. Heath is no
longer in office and is therefore less be
fore the public than formerly.
Bi?t there is another reason why Sena
tor Hanna. in the opinion of associates of
his own political faith in Congress, Is sure
lv not a candidate for a Presidential nom
ination. This reason is never mentioned
bv Senator Hanna, for he is sensitive
about it. His health is poor, they say,
and has been getting v/orse for the last
two years. His knee troubles him and
he has difficulty with his heart. One of
the ConKressmen said that rheumatism
was the malady, but that a large per
centage of heart troubles are really due
to and are identical with rheumatism or
ere the effect of it. A story is in circula
tion that recently Senator Hanna, at his
residence In Washington, fell from his
chair in a fainting spell, that his symp
toms strongly resembled heart failure
and that he did not entirely recover so
that he could leave his bed for three days.
Concerning this story the Congressmen
denied any knowledge, but they are well
aware that he is very far from being a
well man.
them for a year and they were eagerly
looking forth to the time when they
should see the event. Absolutely there was
no political significance in the pilgrimage
of the Ohioana to the Golden Gate. All
the people of the United States had be
come more interested in the entire Pacific
Coast since the commercial importance
of the slope in connection with the trade
of the Orient. had loomed up. There -was
a glorious future for the coast, he felt as
sured, that even the present residents of
the Pacific States, accustomed as they
were to contemplating the possibilities
and dreaming- of the time to be, could not
estimate. He had enjoyed every moment
that he' had been in California and the
entire journey had been tilled with In
struction and delight. In this he but voiced
the sentiments of all the party.

SAN JOSE. May 11.â Decoration on top
of decoration is being added to cover the
mar man's work has wrought in nature's
beauty bestowed on San Jose, and when
President McKinley arrives here on Mon
day afternoon he will be ushered inta a
realm of flora, while sweet-faced . and
pretty girls will perform the work of
fairies and scatter blooms in his - path.
From one end of the city to the other the
streets have been garlanded and decorat
ed with evergreens and palms, while over
head American flags and carnival colors
of yellow and red, with a background of
blue sky. wave a joyous welcome to the
guests/ These -decorations' are^aot "com-*
plete, but enough is apparent to show
that San Jose will outdo herself. Owing
to the fact that so many flowers are to be
â¢used In the display the finishing and beau
tifying touches must be done at the last
moment; but nothing will be lacking, for
load after load of roses, calla lilies and
sweet peas have been contributed and are
ready for delivery.
The decorations as laid out by the dec
oration committee are garlands of green
extending over the streets from trolley
pole to trolley pole, with evergreens and
palms banked against all poles and signs
in town. From these extend carnival
flags, while overhead are hung American
flags. The electric tower has been decor
ated with flags the entire height of over
200 feet and from the top will fly a larger
flag. The front of the City Hall has been
handsomely decorated. A large picture of
McKinley graces the front of ihe builaing,
surrounded by flags and festooning, with
the words "Welcome, Our President,"
above and below.
St. James Park is now in the hands of
the carpenters, who are putting the fin
ishing touches to the reviewing stand and
various arches. At each entrance to th<?
park arches have been erected, which will
be decorated by ladles from, various sec
tions of the county. The reviewing sland
will be handsomely decorated and from
this a walk leads to the President's bou
quet The framework of this nosegay ia
complete and ready to receive the thou-
Eands of smaller bouquets of which it will
be composed.
The Ohio Society is busily engaged in
decorating its headquarters in the Court
house. Judge Lorigan's courtrjoom Is be
ing transformed into a reception-room,
where a welcome will be tendered both
President McKinley and Governor Nash's
party. Here a thousand calla lilies and
other flowers are being, used in the dec
orations. A miniature of the battleship
Ohio, composed of white and red flowers,
is one of the features. *
Firms and merchants are also decorat
ing their places of business, and San Jose
is rapidly donning her holiday garb.
McKinley will arrive here
about 2:30 Monday afternoon. He will be
accompanied to this city by Mayor Mar
tin, Alfred Holman and O. A. Hale, who
will meet him at Santa Cruz. At the de
pot here a reception committee, headed
by Director General Greeninger, and with
the Grand Army veterans for an escort,
will conduct the President up First street
to the reviewing stand opposite the Court
house. The several thousand school chil
dren of the city will be lined- along First
street. Mayor Martin will deliver an ad
dress of welcome and President McKinley
will respond. Then the President will be
presented with the big bouquet by Mrs.
E. O. Smith. Afterward he will be taken
for a drive through the orchard districts,
through Santa Clara, Later the Presi
dent will attend a reception at the Ohio
Society headquarters and in the evening
a reception &X the Vendome. . 'â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦-,
On Tuesday morning the grand floral
parade will occur, starting at 9 o'clock.
Captain A. B. Cash. Is grand marshal.
The floral parade will be the finest ever
seen here. Â»Â« -.
The carnival committee is Jubilant be
cause the President is going to visit here
an hour longer than was intended. The
programme called for his departure at 9
a. m. Tuesday, but this evening the com
mittee received word from Congressman
Loud that- the -time for leaving had been
extended to 10 o'clock. At first it was
feared that McKlnley's early departure
would not enable him to see the parade,
but now there will be plenty of time and
the parade will be all the better, for this
hour will enable more time to arrange the
floats. >

yesterday ordered the release of Clinton
P. Ferry, alias William Renz, a 16-year
old boy, who had enlisted in the navy
without the consent of his parents. The
boy was produced in court by Captain
Henry Glass of the Pensacola and re
stored to the arms of his mother, Mrs.
Evelyn P. Ferry, who had petitioned for
the writ of habeas corpus.

It is alleged that Flower, expecting an
examination, sent to another bank in this
city a Government sealed package said
to contain $40,000 and received in exchange
for It $40,000 In gold clearing-house certifi
cates of the denomination of $5000 .each.'
His cash having been counted by the Na
tional Examiner the evening before and
found correct, it is alleged he returned
the clearing-house certificates to the bank
from which he had borrowed them and
received in return his unbroken Govern
ment package said to contain $40,000.
This package was received by thÂ© Hi
bernia National Bank from the sub-treas
ury of this city in March last and con
tained $4000 in $1 bills. It is alleged that
Flower had preserved a label from an old
Government package that did contain $40,
000 In denominations of $10 each, which he
pasted Â«n the package which contained
only $4000 in $1 bill3, thereby making it a
$40,000 package to all appearances. This
package was opened and counted aJfter his
departure from the bank.
Flower Is a cousin of thÂ© latÂ© Mayor
Flower and comes from one of the most
prominent families In the State. He is a
son of the late ex-United States Sub-
Treasurer Samuel Flower of this city. His
bond for $10,000 was promptly signed when
he was arraigned in .the United States
Court to-day.

A Most Remarkable Remedy Th\t
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor '
. to Men.
A Free Trial Packasr8 Sent by Mail
to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remarka-
ble remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against the mental and
physical sulfering of lost manhood that
the Institute has decided to distribute free
trial Â¦ packages to all who write. It is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any form of sexual weakness result-
ing from youthful folly, premature loss
of strength and memory, weak back, vari-
cocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
â The remedy: has. a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
If cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute, 328 Elektron building. Fort
Wayne, Ind., statins that you desiro one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free sample will enable them
to see how easy it is to be cured of sex-
ual weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no
restrictions. Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed in a
plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write
without delav.

"Work of the Brokers.
The prices that are being obtained by
owners of eligible properties for their
holdings furnish the surest indication that
can be afforded concerning the condition
of the realty market. While there are
weeks in -which there are comparatively
few sales that fact has no material bear
ing upon values. When the buyers are in
the field and business is on the Increase,
such being the case In San Francisco, the
future is more promising than even the
present and there is more discrimination
used by purchasers. A look at the daily
records of sales in The Call is sufficient
to convince any observer that there ia a
move In nearly all sections of the city.
The expansion of older districts, notably
in the wholesale and manufacturing and
warehousing section, is only an indication
of still further expansion. Judicious in
vestors count upon the future as adding
to their assets and they are warranted in ;
this by all indications perceivable. Con- !
sequently they will scan the field and a.^e !
carefully considering it with a view j
toward making the best possible purchase
for the future as well as for the pres
ent. In certain large areas, where there
i? little chance to go much astray in es
timating present earning capacity,
there is an element of future appreciu
tloa that is keeping- the seller and the
buyer in a calculating mood and they do
not come together in haste.

have not yet applied for a copy of the pros-
pectus or report from the mines. Every share-
holder has received a copy of the reports as
Issued from time to time and has read therein
that which has added to his confidence In the
company and the properties. While the reports
are Intended primarily for shareholders, we
are willing the world should read them. The
Montezuma Company has no secrets. It la
willing and even anxious that the light of day-
be turned upon its properties and its business
management The report follows:
OFFICE OF MONTEZUMA MINING CO.
TACOMA, Wash., April S, 1901.
To the Stockholders:
Agreeably to the intention expressed in my
February letter, to from time to time issue
a report on the progress of the Company, it
gives me much pleasure to state that the* last
60 days have been very prolific in develop-
ments.
COPPER PROPERTIES.'
The night and day shifts at our Tacoma
Group of Mines have been doing good work.
We are Just in receipt of the first report, since
the date of my previous letter. The tunnel
is now in 140 feet, the ore has been classified
and placed on the several dumps. The Su-
perintendent sent in three samples of ore from
three separate places in the tunnel, a copy
of the assays of which I herewith submit.

(Concentrates 5 in 1.)
Please note that the assayer's test shows
that our No. 3, which is concentrating, would
concentrate 5 into 1, which would give the con-
centrates a value of $196 45 per ton, from
which a small allowance Â¦would have to be
made for a loss in the process of concentra-
tion, if water is used; but it is our present in-
tention to concentrate by smelting, in which
event the Io6s would be very small. Â»
I might here add that while golng^ in on
the "Tacoma Mine" tunnel, each miner Is tak-
ing out per day approximately $20 00 "worth of
ore and putting it on the dump. We have to-
day several thousand dollars' worth of this on
the dump, and this, while simply doing tunnel
Â¦tt-ork, shows the great richness of the Tacoma
Mine.
Our force on this property has Just been
doubled, and by the first of July we antici-
pate having a compressed air plant and power
drills in operation.
The five feet of snow reported at our copper
properties will delay the starting of work on
the Chicago and Blue Star Groups until some
time in May.
COAL MINES.
Since my last report in February we have
been constantly at work with a crew of over
30 men and can report satisfactory progress.
We have opened up on the surface 6 veins
of coking coal; one 11 feet wide, one 8 feet
wide, one 7 feet wide, one 4% feet wide, one
3 feet wide and one 5 feet wide. By the aid
of this development we have been able to lo-
cate two permanent drifts which will crosscut
the strata and develop the 14 veins known to
exist on our property.
A wagon road from Fairfax to the mine has
been completed, and we now have on the
ground a water wheel, air compressor and
power drill, which will be In operation during
the present month. We have a sawmill also
upon the ground which is being installed and
which will be In operation this month.
We are now drivinjr entries on the coal and
piliner the coal up ready for shipment in May.
RECENT PURCHASE.
"We have Just purchased 160 acres of coal
land, adjoining the property we are operating,
and which will be worked through the same
entries. The land Is covered with the finest
cf fir and cedar. This property belongs ex-
clusively to our Company and is a very valu-
able piece of land. Sincerely yours,
(Signed) C. W. THOMPSON, President
I KEEP ABREAST OF THE TIMES.
There is Indisputable eyldence that an era
of great prosperity is dawning for the Pacific
Coast Representatives of rich Eastern syn-
dicates are traveling the length and breadth
of the Coast for the purpose of determining Its
resources In the base minerals euch as cop-
per, iron and coking coal. These representa-
tives have suceeded beyond their most san-
guine expectations, as the following extract
from the New York Commercial will testify:
"For several months past representatives of
strong New York syndicates have been looking
over the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska,
examining In the most critical and thorough
manner the iron and coking coal deposits in
order to determine the possibility of establish-
ing furnacf-s, rolling mills, plate and structural
works on Puget Sound. Doubt was expressed
by Eastern associates regarding the ability to
find iron and coal in sufficient quantity and
of the right quality for a large plant. But
that doubt Is i now dispelled. They have se-
cured the Fan Ysidro iron mines in Lower
California, where expert examination shows
20,000,000 tons of ore cropping above ground.
They have found large iron deposits in Wash-
ington, British Columbia and Alaska, all with-
in easy distance of tidewater. They have been
equally successful in locating coking coal in
large quantities, accessible to tidewater and
cheap transportation. This coal makes coke
equal to that produced at Connellsville, Pa.
These coal fiel'is are in the vicinity of Seattle
and Tacoma, and a number of mines have in-
stalled plants and. are supplying coke .to Bmelt-
ers and foundries. The New Yorkers have dis-
covered that they can produce pigiron and steel
billets as cheaply on Puget Sound as they are
produced in Pittsburg or Birmingham, and have
as profit the $12 per ton charged for trans-
portation across the continent. The consump-
tion of Iron on the Pacific Coast Is 1000 tons a
day, with Increasing demand. The Orient also
affords a great market It is the purpose of
the New York syndicate to build a plant wtth
a present capacity of 1000 tons daily. They
look upon the Pacific Coast as the greatest un-
occupied iron field in the world, where trusts
or combinations cut no figure and large profits
are permanently assured. They anticipate the
beginning of the foundation for the furnace
plant within sixty days,. and will push it to
early completion. They are receiving great en-
couragement from foundry and shipbuilding
people all over the Coast, who assure them
unbounded success."
The above Is one of many signs of time/ all
of which go to show the enormous develop-
ment assured the Pacific Coast . within the
next few years. It Is for the reader to deter-
mine whether or not he shall share largely In
this prosperity or whether he shall plod along
In the same old rut. It is our candid opinion,
and that opinion is shared by 500 people who
hold its stock, that the Montezuma Mining
Company will make more money for its share-
holders (the present low price of the stock
considered) than any other company on the
Coast The mines are rich In copper and cok-
ing coal, and have only to be developed to
become great dividend payers. The co-opera-
tive principle adopted by the Company makes
It possible for anybody to share In the profits.
EXCURSION TO THE MINES.
We are glad to show the Montezuma prop-
erties, and that we may do so are organizing
an excursion to Puget Sound and the mines
which will leave San Francisco June 15 in a
epeclal train of first-class Pullman cars. Fare
for the round trip, including sleeper, $40, or
free transportation to the purchaser of 3000
shares of stock for cash or on installments.
Ask for excursion folder.
PRICE OF THE STOCK.
Montezuma stock (par value $1) may be had
during all of "Presidential Week" for 10c cash
or 12c on installments. We invite visitors and
others to examine specimens of copper ore,
coal and coke at our offices. Ask for pros-
pectus.

: CHICAGO. May 11.â The wheat market was
largely a. professional one. The .government
report helped, out a prospect, fully as flattering
as the most Intense bear could wish, but it had
beenvdiecounted. and It required the additional
influence of lower cables and a weak corn
market to. 'draw prices farther on the' decline.
July opened He to %c lower at 71c to 70%c. , It
sold between 71%cand 70%o during '. the'.'cur
tailed seEsion and closed %@%c lower at
70*4@70%c. The top price was reached on cov
ering by shorts, who generally sold later. when
they found that no advance was on the sched
ule. May was sold actively for a time* and
dipped V&c under July, Imt recovered and closed
with the discount narrowed to He.
The corn trade was fairly active. Easiness
prevailed at the start and later developed -into
pronounced weakness in the July deliver}'. A
sharp decline at Liverpool, liberal receipts and
excellent climatic conditions ; were the factors
responsible for this state of affairs. July closed
weak, lHc down at 43%Â©43%c. May closed un
changed at Sl'.-sc after a session almost bare of
transactions.
Oats were fairly active and steady for some
time, but eased off in sympathy with corn.
July, closed Uc lower at 27Hc.
Provisions started steady on . light hog- re
ceipts, but eased later in sympathy with corn.
July pork closed 17%c lower/ lard 7 l ,Â£c down,
and ribs 5c depressed. ...

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail Â°advices from New York say: "There Is
a little more activity in several lines, the re

caused the local trade to wake up . a bit on
both apricots and peaches. At the close of the
week there was quite an active Inquiry for
rhsap peachy in bags, but it could not be dis
covered that any considerable ' lots changed
hands. "What was wanted was a peach that
could be bought at frcm 4@5c. Goods around
that price are hard to get, and for anything
really desirable SVic Is about the bot
tom. Good dry apricots in bags con
tinue to be wanted at from 8@8 l^c for putting
in storage. Box goods are less soucht . after.
Prunes continue in fair demand.
"A slight Improvement in the demand for 3
crown California loose raisins was noted Sat
urday, holders bsinK firm at 5^Â£c, and a fair
business being: reported at that quotation. A
bid cf 5kc from cut of town for a fair lot
v/as turned down. Dates are selling moder
ately well at a considerable shading of prices,
holders showing pressure to sell in order to
carry over as light stocks as possible. Cur
rants are firm."

center, both by Institutions and by operators
whose accounts had been weakened. It is also
true that a great deal of investment buying
from outside sources has been going on. These
influences do not show In. the current exhibit.
The export of a Email amount of gold during
the week in the face of money rates far above
normal . created some comment, but it Is ex
plained that .this was on a previous order.' To
what extent the International exchange situa
tion has been affected over the last week can
not be stated accurately, but- it will not be
strange if some unexpected features appear as
a result of the causes already alluded to. The
official statements of tne New York City banks
as made last week show that they have lost
$10,000,000 in cash since the previous call in
February.' while deposits have contracted about
$11,300,000 and loans have remained almost sta
tionary. In other words, their reserve is lower
than at the beginning of February. _ It is sig
nificant that of the losses in deposits the
greater part can be traced to the withdrawals
of interior institutions. Any maintenance of
firm rates here,* however, will attract funds to
this center.

Want Salt Water Mains.
The North Central Improvement Asso
ciation filed a petition with the Board of
Supervisors yesterday in which that body
Is requested to make provision for a sys
tem of salt water mains in the next tax
budget, whereby the downtown district
will be afforded proper protection from
fire.
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down a decision which puts an end to the
long controversy involving George Clark's
tenure of office as Mayor of Sacramento
and , establishes him securely in his posi
tion. . , ....,_ i. .
At the time. of Mayor Clark's, election
In the fall of 1S99 it was alleged by Wil
liam Land, who was Mayor at that time,
that the' successful candidate had used
money illegally for election purposes. On
'the day when Clark should have entered
upon the duties of office Mayor Land re
fused to vacate. Force ' was accordingly
used and Mayor Clark was installed in of
fice. Litigation at once commenced and
from an unfavorable decision of the Su
perior Court Land appealed to the Su
preme Court. He relied on the purity cf
elections act to justify his claims. The
section auoted* In the appeal to the Su
preme Court is as follows:
Any candidate for public office who shall re
fuse or neglect to file, or make false statement
of moneys received or expended, as prescribed
by- Â«ecticn 3, shall, in addition to the punish
ment for such offense prescribed by the laws
of this State, forfeit any office for which this
statement is required to be made. If a candi
date elected to a public office refuses or neg
lects to file the statement prescribed by sec
tion 3 of this act. the iiicum'lwnt of the office,
unless he is himself a defaulting Â¦ candidate,
must not surrender or deliver up said office,
but -shall continue to die-charge the duties and
fhaTl receive the emoluments thereof.
Ex-Mayor Land held that Clark neg
lected to file a proper statement of moneys
expended and was therefore ineligible to
office.
Mayor Clark's account showed an ex
penditure of $200 contributed to the Re
publican City Central Committee for cam
paign purposes, which the court held to
be perfectly legitimate. There was also
an item, "sundries and incidentals, -$22 05."
The law provides that $100 can be spent
for incidentals and no vouchers are re
quired for amounts not exceeding- $5.
The court held that to construe the law
In such a manner as to include the case
under consideration would be an absurd
ity. The offenses complained of were con
sidered to be of a trivial nature and not
arising from any want of good faith. The
opinion of the court set forth In the de
cision rendered is as follows:
Â¦Under the circumstance?, it seems to the
court to be just that the Faid candidate shall
not forfeit his office; 'that- the election of such
candidate shall not by reason of such offenses
or omissions complained of be void, nor shall
the candidate be removed from or â¢ deprived of
his office.
The case was heard on affidavits. Jus
tice Garoutte rendered the decision, which
was concurred in by Justices McFarland,
Van Dyke. Henshaw and Temple.
Several other similar cases are hanging
fire in the courts and this decision will
doubtless remain a precedent for the ad
justment of such litigation in the future.
Appeal of Ex-Mayor Land Is
. : Deemed Trivial by
Justices.

That the profit In copper mining is largo
where there is a good mine Is very well
understood, but there is still food for
thought in the statements contained in the
answer filed by Henry H. Rogers, vice
president of the Amalgamated Copper
Company, in a suit in the East. Mr. Rog
ers set forth that the properties of the
Butte and Boston Company, which were
purchased a few years ago for $1,000,000,
are now worth $18,500,000. In 1890 the Bos
ton and Montana Company paid dividends
amounting to $6,130,000 and in 1900 the divi
dends, aggregated $6,450,000. The properties
of the Boston and Montana Companv,
leaving out the matter of good will and
all intangible aÂ»sets, are worth, so Mr.
Rogers said, $50,250,000. The Amalgamated
Copper Companv has issued stock to the
amount of $75,000,000 for the purpose of
acquiring copper properties where it ap
pears to be clearly to the interest of the
stockholders to take them in.
The Shasta County papers have a story
that Captain de la Mar, in case he pur
chases the Balaklala Copper property, will
establish a great plant for smelting near
the junction of the Pit and Sacramento
rivers for the purpose of handling the
ores of the Bully Hill and the Balaklala
mines. The Redding Searchlight antici
pates that this would mean "a vast indus
try equaled in few if any of the great cop
per camps." De la Mar's experts are still
examining the Balaklala property. The
new smelter of the Bully Hill mines has
been' blown in. The Mountain Copper Com
pany has installed a large converter. By
this the cost of shipping a great amount
of waste in matte to New Jersey lor
treatment every year will be saved.
The Board of Supervisors of Shasta
County have adopted a resolution request
ing Governor Gage to expend in North
ern-California one-fourth of the sum that
the Legislature appropriated at the last
session for the compiling of a State min
ing-journal.
Facts From Counties.
The Forbestown correspondent of the
Oroville Mercury reports that 100 men are
employed at the Gold Bank mine and that
work has been resumed on the big ttinf
nel. The Miller mine at York Flat ha?
been closed down with the exception of
the tunnel, which is being run by con
tract. The Carlisle mine will be reopened.
. Present mining activity in the vicinity
of Trinity Center, so says Mineral
Wealth, is unusual. In tin 5 vicinity is the
Sikes mine, a placer property, with an
ample water supply. A new ryanldlng
plant is being Installed at the Headlight
mine.
The Eastern people who have bought
the copper mines at Copperopolls are re
ported to be willing to put in a large
amount of coin to reopen the properties
on an extensive scale. The Stockton In
dependent says that several weeks will
elapse before the water is out ,of the
mines, upon which pumping operations
have been under way for some time. Con
cerning -the mines the Independent says:
Th% Copperopolis mines could never be
worked at a profit when' copper was low, be
cause it is low grade ore and carries no silver
and gold to pay for working, as other mines
of this State do. When the Copperopolls mines
were worked the ores were hand sorted, the
better portion being smelted into a black
matte, which was shipped to Boston for treat
ment, and the poorer stuff was roasted In the
"open air and leeched. That process of extract
ing the copper was very costly and the fuel
expense was enormous. With low-grade ore
ranging from 4 to 16 per cent copper the mines
could not be made profitable except when there
was a strong demand for copper. The new
method of treating copper ore does away with
the old-fashioned smelting and the process is
much cheaper, which encourages the new own
ers of the Copperopolls mines in the belief

The Sonora (Tuolumne County) papers
report that the Riverside mine, located

Properties Are Sold.
Standard Electric employes are running
lines to the Baliol mines at Butter Creek
and also the Keystone mine at Amador
City, so reports the Amador Dispatch.
Both â¢ properties will be operated with
electric power.
Two considerable sales of mining prop
erty on the coast are reported.' The
white Horse Copper Company, with head
quarters in Vancouver, B. C, has sold six
teen claims on the ."White Horse River to
an English syndicate for $160,000, r all of
which are contiguous. The other sale was
made in Utah, where a half interest on
the Surprise group â¢ was turned I over for
$300,000 by S. L. Adams to John McComb
of.Etenver. The machinery for a smelter
has. been shipped from Denver. The Dixie,
mines were recently sold for $200,000, and
the Salt Lake Tribune says that the price

opolls mines are on what Is known among
miners as the east copper belt, while the pay
lngf mine at Campo Seco Is on the west cop
per belt. The west belt mines carry consider

ing of the ore and leave the copper product

Progress of Dredgers.
The progress of the dredgers in the
north is reported by the Yreka Journal
as being satisfactory. Preparations are
making for the construction of a huge
dredger ' at South Fork of Scott River,
the lumber for which will be hauled in
from Gazelle. The dredger., at '. Hawkins
ville, on Yreka Creek, has started, up
again and is cleaning up bed rock gravel.
The water has been pumped out of the
basin to permit of this. Several hydraulic
claims on Klamath River, are idle be

that prevented the melting of the gnow.
There is an abundance of Â¦ water when
