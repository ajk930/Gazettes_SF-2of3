"When the romance began to be sus

"Yes." Then, with an apologetic smile,
that begged pardon inasmuch as I wore
an Eton instead of embroidered blouse
and serge instead of clinging silk, and
hair that was high and fluffy instead of
low and plastered, she added: "I like Chi
nese dress best."
"You always wear Chinese dress?'
The independence of her, you see, Is' in
evidence everywhere. With her own t&s
tidiousness she selects what pleases her
from the two fastidious nations. She de
mands the best caterine of both, the best
trained service of both. Above all, she
mingles freely in the most -exclusive so
ciety of both and that in opposition to all

Ho yow. "They are of a high class."
"She has servants to attend to both

and the patronizing tone that we employ
toward corn beef and cabbage.
"Roast beef and sweetbreads."
Two questions at* once were ruled out
by her gesture of despair. At last It
was interpreted to me that she has sorted
out from American menus what she con
sidered worth while, and she has these
things served to her, together with the
best of Chinese catering.
"What are they?"
"Have you learned to like American
cooking? What do you eat at your own
table?"
"Tea." she sa!d, and she struggled. I
could see that there were other refresh
ments coming, and in her feminine eag
erness to tell about them, and mine to
hear, we appealed together to the Con
sul. â¢
"She serves both American and Ori
ental refreshments," he explained. "The
Oriental ones consist of tea and sweet
meats and preserved fruits, such as you
find in our restaurants."
"And for refreshments?"
"My â hand," she lisped, lifting the
dainty, useless-looking little member and
letting it fall limply. It told its story in
that one motion. Her gestures are few
and far between, for she belongs to a
race of people who do not express, but
one gesture tells as much as a French
man's twenty.
She nodded and murmured something to
her brother. "Seventeen hundred at
tended the last time," he said.
"The Minister and his wife have of late
adopted a custom heretofore unknown to
our legation in Washington," explained
Ho Tow in his book English that can be
matched in purity and pomposity by few-
Americans. "They k^ep open house on
one day of every week and all are per
mitted to call. Previously they received
only by personal Invitation." f â¢
"And a great many must avail them
selves."
Her little tapering hand, with a flash
of American-set jewels, made a sweeping
gesture that covered an eternal round of
cayety.
She understood slowly, but in the end
she understood, and she nodded with
pleasure. She was waking now. She was
forgetting to be tired.
"Allâ time â go â pahtyâ go â dlive â go â

"And is it all true?" v I asked her. "Do

showed me how.
"Howâ longâ youâ stayâ inâ San â Flan

then and went ahead, to the end that I
learned how she was to be here ten days;
was then going to China for two months;
has property of her own there, which
needs attending to, and is pleased with
San Francisco. AH of which being prop
erly disposed of I had things which I
wanted to talk over with her.
"I think it would be well for you to
ask now what questions you have pre
pared and let the photographs be taken
afterward," Ho Yow said. That finished
me completely. I never have a cuettion
prepared, and there wasn't one that came
to my rescue In the critical moment. And
when Mrs. Wu had waited in vain for me
to begin an interview according to ap
proved methods, and I didn't do it, she

dled to the sofa and sat there beside me.
Ho Yow remained near in case he should
be needed. He smiled approbatively on
the whole affair, bat It is unknown what
he thinks in the depths of him. With a
sister who talks and poses for publication
and a wife who is never even seen by
any but her own family; and a few of the
exclusive ladies of Chinatown, he is a
man between two fires, and it is safe to
count on him for getting burned ' by
neither.
Every word that she utters she utters
carefully, distinctly. It Is that child lisp
ing. "Doâ youâ seeâ theâ co v.'? Theâ good,
âcow-gives-milk." When she doesn't
feel sure of being able to hold her balance
on a word she doesn't attempt to mount
it. but appeal to her brother. She has
a national reputation as a mistressof the
English tongue, and she tries her best to
maintain it.
"Willâ youâ sitâ down?"
"Butâ peopleâ areâ kind," she added,
apologetically, with a quick Chinese in-
Ftinct of polite dishonesty. It is an open
question how many of us have ever been
kirc! to her. The most have been vulgarly

CHINESE WOMAN
IN AMERICATHE SUNDAY CALL.

Off, Not On, the Stage.
IT'S all tommyrot. this talk of the stage
glamour.
Defenseless actresses are every day

Â¦ are ever painted rosy on it. As a mat
ter "of fact, the glow of illusion shed over
many a woman vanishes in the cold real
ity of the actress. Take a front seat and
watch her. with the footlights full upon
her and you know the worst at once.
They are nearly all good hostesses. The
first dressing-room interview I ever had
was with a star who has since turned out
to be no planet. Just then, however, she
was it at a local vaudeville house and I
was 'shown to the best room.
My reception was tropical. To be sure,
I was not such a lobster as not to know
that there is often a business motive for
the courtesy which the "profesh" shows
the press. However, I did not think that
was here nor there, any more than I do
to-day. The point was that she knew how
to be charming, and to Cariboo with the
motive.
, "Do sit down If you can find a place,"
she said, clearing the extra chair of a
suit of blue silk tights. "I don't suppose
you ev* saw a dressing-room In such dis
order before."

and I warmed immediately.

a pillow in the corner of the shelf, and

survey he came straight to me and gave
me the glad paw.

"I never before knew . Taidie to go to a
stranger. He is most reserved. He seems
to think you are all right." \
Now there is nobody who Is not jsus
cep^iblc to the flattery, of. a dog, especial
ly a reserved one,*so I warmed still more,
though as a matter of fact I suppose
Taidie is tipped, to nose every stranger.
As the chat went on I glowed more and
more. Here was the woman* of tact, of
magnetism. She was not beautiful, to be
sure, but her fascination was all the more
remarkable in* view of that fact.
"You are a native San Franciscan, are
you not?" she asked.
"No," I answered. "I made o. mistake
of 4000 miles when I was born, but I am
willing to be more careful at reincarna^"*"*

"Well, you seem the San Franciscan ,
anyway, and that Is the most I can sav.

The first clocks manufactured in this
country were by Ell Terry at Plymouth.

came extensive and Connecticut wooden
clocks were famous ail over tha toaatry.
These hang pendent like a medal. Other
very swell effects are created by a simple
chain with a diamond on each end and
no clasp except the crossing of the chain
around the neck. But the quaintest of
them is a dainty green enamel with a
pearl pendant. Two chains of irregular
lengths end with green clasps holding
fast a single pearl. It is the daintiest,
frailest appearing novelty that has lately
pleased the novelty crank.
The matrix Is another new and popu
lar fad. Any kind of matrix and any
klnd^of setting seem to go, but the tur
quoise makes up the swellest.
A new turquoise brooch is mounted in
rose gold and the gold makes a wlggly,
curling mass of snakes- that peer into
every nook and cranny with their bright
diamond eyes.

Thrift is a virtue which should be culti
vated, if not indigenous. A French woman
stands aghast at the lack of it in an
American, but the French woman has had
the advantage of being a recognized part
ner in the domestic firm., I-ooking for
ward to old age or to the dowry of her
daughters and the establishment in life of
her sons, she has been in the confidence
of her husband and has assisted him to
build up their united fortune. American
wives are often pitiably ignorant of their
husband's affairs. The husband, honestly
anxious to shield the wife from every
care, keeps the problems in his office, and
has not the courage in periods of stress
and weather to let her know the impera
tive need of retrenchment. No home can
ever be perfect ""where on either hand
there are reserves. Entire â¢ confidence is
an essential of success in home making.
Doris and Strephon, should life be grant

on this rule. - And surely, if a man trust
his wife with his most intimate. and sa

children's care and up-bringing, he may
well afford to be open and to bestow upon
her regularly n requisite portion of the
home income.

WHEN Strephon puts on his Sun
day best and goes to court Doris,
so every-day a master as money
never enters either head. She re
ceives him, a gallant figure, courteous and
debonair, his port as brave in her eyes as
that of some knight of the middle ages.
Doris herself, in her pretty daintiness of
attire, her silk waist, her shining eyes,
her ma*s of gulden hair. Is as captivating
aa a princess in a fairy tale, and she car
ries herself aa regally. Whatever her sta
tion, she has been born In the purple, if
en American girl. Farmer's daughter,
merchant's, mechanic's, or scholar's child,
she is well educated, well mannered, and
Independent. If her people are rich, she
has had money In plenty; if poor, she has
earned It. As a typewriter, a teacher, an
artist, as singer in the church choir, she
has been her own mistress, and. If
v.-ealthy, she has had her allowance or her
fortune, and thus independent, too. Some
times, unfortunately, marriage changes
all this.
Orce married, and settled In a home,
however unostentatious, the question of
the exchequer soon rears Its formidable
head, and la neither to be evaded nor lg
r.ored. To carry on the simplest house

factor In the machinery. Though lovers.

plain terra firma, would scout the notion
that money might one day be a. persistent
wedge to ruin their happiness, the little
rift within the lute, fatal to the music;

candid moments, would confess that they
owed JLo that one cause all the heart-burn
ings they have ever had. A man says,
prandly and sincerely. Whatever . I earn
beltfrgs to -my wife. She has only to ask.
But .she dislikes to ask, and if her asking

irilllation as with a cloak. Men seldom

quirements of women. The purse-bearer
holds too heavy a balance of authority.
The Matter of Dollars and Cents
Applied to the Household.
No wife should be forced into the position
of a licensed mendicant in the marriage
relation. No wife can enjoy this, though
she may seem to acquiesce.
If the home is to be a type of heaven in
its sweetness and rest, the two who pre
responsible for it, and who carry it on 1 ,
should arrive at an Intelligent agreement
about its financial management very early
in the day. If they have been building
on an unsubstantial foundation they will
do well to start anew at any period In
their common career.
With an eye to the style of living pre
ferred, husband and wife may easily es
timate the cost of various items in 'the
annual bill of expense. Shelter, fuel,
clothing, food, are the primitive wants.
The education of children, the social rami
fications of the family, a margin for char
ity and for travel, come later. The wife,
if she defray any portion of the regular
and acknowledged expenses of the house
hold, servant?' wages, school bills, etc..
and the accounts of the grocer and the
butcher, should have her allowance, paid
to her at stated intervals, for the purpose.
Beyond this, and in accordance with the
family means, she should have something
for her individual expenses, her private
purse. If possible, her separate bank ac
count, even if very small, should be part
of the domestic scheme.
Men constantly complain of or assert
the business incompetence of women. Yet
a woman may be treated like a child all
her life, and if by her husband's illness or
death, without previous training or prepa
ration, she will meet the occasion, and
prove herself mistress - of âli&^exigencies.
The wife who never had any money in her
control, who perhaps bought . what she
chose and sent the bills to her husband,
or did without desired conveniences rath
er than face his criticism, will when
thrown upon her own resources show a
wonderful adaptability. She will not

years number , but thirty. He.comes from a blend of good English ami
American stock and was born and laised in St. Louis. In 1888, at the
ag-e of 17; he received an appointment to Annapolis, but after gradua
tion fslt so- strongly drawn toward letters that he waived the bright
prospects of a naval career to accept a position on the Army and Navy
Journal. He spent about a year of editorial work on this journal and
the Cosmopolitan Magazine,' and then decided to turn his attention ex
clusively to the more pleasant field cf story writing. His first book,
"The Calebrity,". went into the third edition within a month and was
voted Â». literary hit.- This was in 1897. Then Mr. Churchill took aim
at higher things. He decided to write a series of stories covering the dif
ferent phases of American social life, and of this series "Richard Car
vel" was the first. He-spent a great deal cf time, study and research on '
this book and has been rewarded by hearing its title in the mouth of
every reader of fiction. It even went the way of other hits and took its
place, with more or less success, on the dramatic boards. "Richard Car
vel" is a story of the Revolutionary period. "The Crisis" is of similar
construction devoted to the time of the Civil War. Mr. Churchill has
taken two steps down in our history â first in tho middle of the eigh
teenth century, next in the middle of the nineteenth century. Where
will his next step in the contemplated series bring him? %.

On closer view the lights and shades
make pictures in themselves. First and

him with the eyes of Stephen Brice, who
goes to Lincoln v.-ith a messasre at the lit
tle inn. Little does Brice dream that this
ugly mortal Is one day to be President of
all the United States:
In the glance at it as a whole you see first
this magnificent figure of Lincoln, mls
uncenstood at times, but standing there
for good and all for the welfare of his
people. You sea the strong character of
Grant and the wonderfully versatile and
energetic Sherman. You see in Stephen
Brice and Judge Whipple the conservative
North deploring the ruin of its Southern
brothers, but firm In the maintenance of
a union. In Clarence Colfax there is the
dish and youth of the South that made

enjoy for the broadness of the concep

closer to find that under the magnifying
gl2ss it is perfect in every part and un
folds details that hold you for days of
pleasant study.
Mr. Churchill can thank his youth and
Western energy that permitted him to
weave fiction about such a character.
He can thank his long line of American
ancestry and his birthplace for the intui
tion that has given him the power to
cull and properly present the best that
history has to offer. These things are
inherent qualities and a part of himself;
but credit must be given to the hard and
laborious research he undoubtedly carried
on to rnal:e his novel historically accu
rate, and also to the painstaking care
with which he has given every detail of
color and atmosphere.
Even when Lincoln himself is not per
sonally in evidence. Etill you feel the per

the actions cf the other characters; you
sepc his hand ever present. In the molding
cf events; and you hear from afar his
voice crySngr for the ultimate unity of his

A remarkable feature of Mr. Churchill's
book Is that it is a novel of the Civil War
period, depending upon the causes and ef
fects of that struggle without using the
claptrap, sensational opportunities af
forded by such a subject. There are no
accounts of personal struggles, thrilling
fights by land and sea, blood, carnage,
deaths and all thafsort of thing. There

out of him by two knocks of his head on a
wooden table when Stephen Brice finds
him making love to Virginia Carvel.
Sherman makes his appearance as presi

his cars with his . children beside him.
But he lives In the novel to give Brice
many a helping hand and himself the

Churchill carries him through gloriously
until he makes him "General Grant"â
the Grant of Vicksbursr, the Commander
in-Chief of the army of lhÂ« United States;

It may not be out of place to quote here
a thought that comes to Stephen Brice:
When we meet the truly great several things
may happen. . In the first place, we begin to
believe In their luck or fate or whatever we
choose to call it and to curse our own. We

Frrm the viewpoint of the novel reader,
Stephen Brice is the hero. And a fine
fellow he is. too. He isj a young Boston
attorney, who eome<? to Si. Louis to try
his fortune? with Judge Whlpple, an old
friend of his father. Brice has an uo
hill road, but he climbs it with the steadi

wins the goal.
Then there H Virginia Carvel and her
splendid old father. Colonel Carvelâ both
descendants of that Richard Carvel we
have met before. Virginia is the perfect
type of the bostnf Southern women.
How she hates Stephen Brice'and would
love to hear something bad about him,
yet every one of his sterling deeds come
to her Â«-ars and you feel all along that his
love will eventually conquer her to un

We see Captain Grant unloading wood

crept over him? Surprise? Cautiously he
raised his eyes. The hands were coming around

In its stead wonder was come. But soon he

was a man transformed. The voice was no

Coming after a ion? succession of
stories- of early colonial life. "The Tower

has too little intrinsic merit to com-*

mantic history of the settlement- of a
part of Maryland, and .deals with the
adventures of Richard Smith and Rat

England to Claiborne's colony on Kent
Island, in Chesapeake Bay. The young
Englishmen have many exciting experi

and afterward when they are drawn into
the quarrels which arise between the
adherents, of Clalborne and those of

The Hubaiyat.
Of the series of famous poems known as

volume IX has just appeared and is a
translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar

version of Edward FitzGerald and has
been well illustrated by. Herbert Cole.
Considering the lowness of the price,
these books are a positive boon to the
lovers of good verse. The price in cloth
is 50 cents and. in leather 75 cents.
"The Potter and the Clay." by Maud
Howard Peterson, is a strong and de
lightful piece of work. The title is in
itself attractive, and Miss Peterson, with
the verse from the Rub.iiyat as a motive,
has wrought out a rare and absorbing
romance of conscience. A young American
girl from- a frontier -fort finds herself
in England with two British lads
whom she had known in childhood, now
grown to manhood, as officers in the
British army and suiters for her hand.
The contrasting natures of these two
men. the characteristics and .motives of
the girl. are. remarkably drawn; and the
way in which love acts and reacts makes
the stcry indeed, as it has been called, a
romance of conscience. But the strain,
as well as the Interest in the story, cen
ters upon Trevelyanâ the clay that i3
thumped and molded and shaped and
shattered, as the potterâ destiny, provi
dence, will, call it what we mayâ tries
and tests the clay that does not take the
perfr ct shape it should. Opinions will
vary as to Trevelyan's character. The
question as to whether he was a hero or
coward will be debated according as the
sympathies of the reader are swayed;;
while the characters of Stewart and Cary,
the heroine, show the well rvised man
and the true-hearted woman as foils for
,.Tre\elyan*s unsettled soul. The book is
full of rich descriptions: and the Ameri
can, English, Scottish and East Indian en
vironments and atmosphere unite in a
realistic and picturesque setting for a
strong and -absorbing story. The illustra

very soul of the situations. (Published

well, B. A., is a new novel by the author
of "The Ironmaster" that, can hardly fail
of a welcome. This latest product of the
celebrated French novelist is an absorbing
story of love and intrigue. The scenes are
laid in Paris, San Francisco, London and
elsewhere. Most of the characters are
typical of French life, gay and grave. A
principle is enunciated at the beginning of
the book: the fallibility of human Judg
ment "even in those, whose profession it
is .to pass .sentence and who are conse
quently ,in â¢ 'a ; position to boast ! of special
experience"â thus * the .possibility of legal
error. The .*ploj_'.of*the. story reveals a
sensational instance of such* legal- error. 1
and the reader is taken through many
stirring events' and made to share In many
strong emotions. The story of the un
happy victim suggests by the force of cir
cumstantial . evidence the unscrupulous
villainy of those who plot against, him,

most valuable of its kind which has been
presented to our notice. The work has
been prepared simply as a textbook and
not as a compendium of astronomy or
an- outline course of popular reading in
that science: consequently matter which
permits of experimental treatment with
simple apparatus is of peculiar value and
is given prominence. The author says:
"Teacher and student are alike urged
to magnify the ooservational side of the
subject and to strive to obtain in their
work/ the maximum degree of precision
of which their apparatus is capable. The
instruments are few and easily obtained.
With the exception of a watch and a pro
tractor, all of the apparatus needed may
be built by any one of fair mechanical
talent who will follow the illustrations
and descriptions of the text."

A few quick questions established tha
fact that she hatt not noticed the name
of the author. Before this discovery the
dismissal of the cook had been a sealed
verdict, but, In justice to the force and
delicacy of the compliment thus paid Mr.
Horton's powers as a narrator, the ver
dict was set aside and the cook escaped
with a warning that her literary tastes
must thereafter be held in subjection un
til the family dinner was safe on the
table. . â¢ ;
Instantly there was a rush to the
kitchen, where the cook was found in
tears and the goose burned almost to cin â -
dors. When the penitent domestic re
gained sufficient control of herself to
{Â¦peak she confessed that she had become
so engrossed In a story that she had en
tirely forgotten the roasting fowl. In
proof of the. extenuating circumstances
she drew from under her apron a paper
containing Mr. Horton's serial.
Shortly after he returned from Athena
and became' literary editor of the- Chicago
Times-Herald he began the publication
in serial form of "Like Another Helen."
The author has a strong predilection for
roast goose, and one Saturday provided
an extra fine fowl of this kind for his
Sunday dinner. His appetite was well at
tuned to do justice to this favorite dish,
and shortly before the fowl was to bo
served he was horrified to catch the odor
of burning meat.

overlooked, but at all events It was ar
ranged that the two take their places on
kegs of powder, with a lighted fuse
placed In the bunghole of each. The
kegs, of course, were empty, but as the
foreigner saw the fire slowly burning
down to the supposed volcano below him
his courage failed him and he fled.
SU21 more Interesting Is the story of the
Yankee skipper and the Englishman.
In the earlier days there was not much
love lost between the two factions, con
sequently It was no very hard matter to
pick a quarrel, especially when each
thought the death of the other would ,>e
a service not only to his country, but to
the world. In this particular cafe the
fkipper of a weather-beaten Yankee
whaler met an-Engllshman in a foreign
port and hatr^in altercation with him.
perhaps over a matter of precedence. A
duel was arranged, and at the appoint
ed time the Englishman appeared, brlng
!nj with him two swords, as, though the
Yankee had the choice of weapons, he
inferred that the armory of a whaler
contained no . such luxuries. But the
skipper would not accept the proffered
Â¦weapons, whereupon the other brought
out a handsome pair of dueling pistols.
These, too, were refused, and the Eng
lishman demanded In astonishment what
his opponent did want to fight with,
whereupon the Yankee replied ho had
brought his "weapons with him, and pro
duced a pair of well-sharpened
poons! The Englishman of course pro
tested; but as the choice of weapons did
not lie with him he was obliged to ac
cept the harpoon. When the Yankee
raised the murderous-looking piece the
Englishman knew that arm. experienced
in piercing the dodging whale, could not
fail to miss him. The unwieldy harpoon
began to shake in his awkward hand and
he flung it down, leaving the exultant
Yankee master of the situation.
Another interesting duel fought' with
out the use of ordinary weapons had for
one of its principals the Dul^e of Rich
mond, then Viceroy of Ireland.-.' His ti
tle to fame rests on the fact of his be
ing a great duelist and a six-bottle man,
able to drink all his staff and gentlemen
guests under the table. On a visit to a
friend in the we?t of Ireland the duke
complained that he had no one to drink
v.ith him. and his host, wishing -to
remedy this deficiency, sent for a curate
famous for his liquor, drinking. After
five bottles had been disposed of by each
the curate complained Â¦ that it was too
slow work and proposed \ bumpers of
brandy. These were immediately filled
and as quickly emptied. ' Fresh bumpers
were then filled for each, but as the rep
resentative' of the church stretched' out
his hand to receive one he - fell helpless
to . the floor. On the following day thÂ«
duke made him a dean, remarking that
if he had been victorious in the'drinking
duel his curacy would have' been ex
changed for a bishopric.
A little earlier than this the famous Dr.
Young, going with some ladies to Vaux
hall. then the rendezvous of all the beauty
and fashion of London, played on the Ger
man flute to , amuse them. '.Just K behind
them came a boatload of officers, and
when the" doctor ceased playing one -of
them insisted- that he should continue or
be thrown into. the water. Wishing to
avoid a dispute before his friends lie' con
tinued, but arriving at his destination he
sought out' his tormentor and demanded
satisfaction with swords and without sec-
onds early the following morning. When
they met, however, and hau taken their
places the doctor instantly drew out a
huge horse pistol and. pointing, it" at the
officer's' lead, compelled him to dance a
minuet. The officer had no choice' but to
.obey, and for a quarter. of an hour kept
up the danoe. The doctor then lowered
his pistol, saying as they "were quits they
might now arrange another affair with
seconds and the officer might have satis
faction.
But if England. was an uncomfortable
place to live in in those days France was
Still worse. >. Such a state" of affairs ex
isted that In 1041 was instituted the "Sa
vior's truce," whereby duels were prohib
ited from ." Wednesdays until \ Mondays.
/But, like all other forbidden things,- the
duel rather grew in favor than decreased.
Montaigne says: / "If three Frenchmen
werÂ« rut into the * Libyan desert they
would not be a month there without fight
ing and quarreling." Cases are
Â¦ of .father and son facing each r other in
mortal combat/ brother arrayed against
brother and the dearest of friends killing
each other for absolutely nothing-except
perhaps. a misplaced. word. Even the'wo
rnen of France have fought, Jthough. in
deed, it was no very unusual" occurrence
in any country for a wife to disguise her
self m her husband's armor when he was
to meetthe foe himself. "â¢.-Â¦ .*, Â¦ ..,'."
; One of the > most famous of 'Â¦the 1 women
duelists of France" was. Maupin, -one of
the x performers at the opera. Scrane, the
famous fencing, master; ; fell in love with
her and gave her many valuable lessons

was very rude to -another "lady and was

says the younger.
"You bet I wouldn't." affirms the elder.
"I know I- could have done it."
"All rieht. We took your word for It.
No need to prove it."
Perhaps that is how it happens that the
younger Mattner returned from abroad.

climb, many of long years; Alpine ex

Just why Europe thinks of inviting hot
visitors to make it is something I never
coukl discover. With the good chancts of
death. !t strikes me that it comes ton
near suicide to be temptatious. We have
never yet asked any tourist to shoot Ni
agara for pastime. . We shouldn't call it
hospitable. But Switzerland *a.va: "Come
and try a hand at committing suicide.
We'll do our best to help you. And If
you succeed we'll be sure to .save a'.l the
souvenirs we can find of youâ any belt
buckles, matches, hairpins, card casesâ
any articles that you may chance to spill
by' the way, and we'll put them on ex

This is the way that Switzerland ente*-

They describe the blue light Inside the

"The queer thing about this is that it
isn't particularly cold, even after you get
deep into it." say the tourists. "At its

in default of one you make a break and

ODD NOOKS IN EUROPEVenice, with its water}' streets, has not
icany open dry spaces to boast of. So
this oblong stretch of pavement seems to
the Venetian to be room enough for all
the parados and out of door assemblies
and celebrations that ever Venice rejoiced
in. or the world for the matter cf that.
To visitors coming from terra lirma it
dees not .seem so much of a big thing.
The wonderful old buildings that surround
it are the objects of interest. But his
torical spots are commonplace to people
who have been born and bred where his
tory was at home-. The natives who
throng the Piazza are most interested in
the pigeons that gather there to be fed.
They are sacred pigeons, protected by
Italian law, which is as fierce as Paliaii
lawlessness. The pigeons apparentlv un
derstand th!s to the full, for they come in
flocks at feeding time and alight on any
hand or shoulder that offers itself. Men,
women f.nd children all collect there to
feed them as regularly as the clock strikes
and so regularly are the birds on hand.
St. Mark's Church is at the end of the
Piazza and St. Mark's bell-tower beside
it. This is the tower built upon 90") onn
piles. It rises 350 feet into the air, and
there aloft perches an angel who can

so U ng will it be a shrine for offerings

sits within cold walls of Italian art his
devotees will not fail him in their gifts
from the outor world of Italian sunshine.
It will take a great many years to do
thatâ more, by far, than it has taken to
bring it to its present condition. In the
meantime it and the Vatican may crum
ble together. The mosaics and the paint
ings and the statues may have disap
peared from the face of the earth. The
candles that stand before it may have
ceased to burn; the censer may have
ceased to swing.
After the gift has been laid at -the saint
ed feet, the giver rubs a handkerchief
across the projecting toe. kisses it. rubs
it asain. The result of years of that is
its gradual wearing away. Will it disap

great, solemn bronze figure endure to be
come footless?
Year in and year out they have been
bringing him flowers, gorgeous wreaths
of them, masses of them. On the day of
rach year dedicated to him the bronze
figure l;as been burled in the fragrant,

other days of the year it is never with

The figure stands in the Vatican, back
grounded by splendid mosaic decorations,
canopied by embroidered and tasseled
hangings, and surmounted far above by
the tablet and portrait of Pius IX. He
is a much-beloved St. Peter by the good
Catholics of Rome and by pilgrims from a

However, there is one. I believe, and

proper officials can entrance be obtained.
Aftei this is accomplished you may wish
you hadn't, for the hill is climbed by
means of stairs and there are 203 of these.

Thr- old place is kept sacredly in order
nov/adays. Its chapel and numerous as
sembly ha!!s are rigidly clean and orderly

In the rare old chapel John Nepmont
lies buried â John Nepmont, who was
thrrwn from the Carl's bridge, below the
castle. His silver coffin contains 3700
woight of the metal, or an amount valued
at 200.000 gulden. This represents not the
coffin alone, but the figures in silver of
cherubim that surmount it. If funeral
pomp can atone for troubles during life,
rarely John Nepmont ought to be enjoy
ing a sense nf poetic justice.
The gorgenusness of thÂ«- chapel has
rÂ»een steadily increased since its earlv
building by Charles the Fourth. It wa's
rebuilt by Maria Theresa. It contains
more precious stones than any chapel in
the world. I understand, and its decora
tions are largely in real silver and gold.

climbing stairs. The peculiarity of this
tower is that it has no stairs, being as
cended by means of an Inclined plane that
winds like a staircase.
"It isn't so steep as you would think."
Dr. Manner says. 'T climbed it and had
some breath left to get down again. There
are no cleats on the incline, eitherâ It's
smooth."
The tiny windows can be seen in the

platform that Napoleon rode with two
.Austrian officers following; him. and from Â¦
this platform that sightseers now climb
to he locked forth over the old- Venice,,

Suddenly a gliding, graceful figure crept
along and drew near to Bicilis. After ex
changing a few words with him, It dis
appeared and made its way to the nearest
gate. Andrada felt the hot blood bound
ing in her temples as, breathless, she
watched the traitress. An instant after
ward the gate was forced and the Romans
entered in dense masses. Andrada applied
her two hands to her mouth and sent
rorth a shrill cry. like toÂ»that of a bird of
preyâ a second, yet a third time, and then
rusned to the flight of steps leading from
the tower. But, alas! there wa.3 a door
at the bottom of these steps and this
had been fastened from the outside.
"Fausta!" cried she. biting her lips with
her teeth until the blood flowed. She
looked around her; the staircase was ob
scure, but she perceived a stone which
was loose and had fa.llen away. CouM
she raise it? Stiffening her arms and
with the force of an Amazon, she lifted
it above her head and flung it against
the door. The dpor shook, but the hinges
did not yield. A second effort was more
successful and the wood of the door shiv
ered Into splinters. Then Andrada seized
two torches and lighting them at the
smoldering ashes, forced herself a passage
amid the throng. On all sides were
women, only waiting her behests. They
flung the torches to right and leftâ from

cave there glistened some luminous thing,
and, approaching: with the lamp, there
glared out upon her in the 'darkness the

animal. Andrada felt for the hilt of the
poignard in her. waist-scarf, but, leaving
it in its place, she seized , Fausta by the
wrist and dragged her/from her hiding

asked she. . ;

of the Roman legion, which was furtively
approaching In the obscurity.

Andrada stood before him, leaning against
a large stone, on which burned a small oil
lamp, flickering and smoking.

even for t Dactan woman. Suddenly
came wild shouts and the blasts of horns,
while a clashing of arms was heard at !he
nearest gate of the town. The Roman*,
under cover of the blackness of the night,
had silently approached and were now a?
saulting the town on three of its stdes si
the same time. Their fury had redoubled
â¢when the morning light had brought to
their view the head of Longinus. An

of the tower. She saw her father giving

successful, assaults of the Romans, hj

cried. "Bato! what brings you here? Are

âslavery: and we know how to protect
ourselves from that."
Bicilis again looked toward Andrada,
who still remained calm and motionless
as a morsel of stone from the cave.
"And our women," asked he.
"Our women will die! Trajan knows An
drada's beauty, and has sworn to be its
possessor." ~- ,' ,
Then Andrada aroused herself. "Trajan
Is a mighty Emperor," cried she, "but An
drada is yet more powerful."
"To the gates!" cried Decebal. rlslnsr.
while his voice resounded in the cave likÂ»
an echo from the bowels of the earth
that voice which, like the fanfare of a
clarion, had so often incited his warriors
to acts of valiant courage.
Andrada hastily sought Fausta. for now
ânow she nv.st die. and there was not a
moment to be lort. But Fausta was no
where to be found.
Fausta escaped like an 'eel, leavimr a

"You .saw at Turnu the piles driven into
the Ister to form a bridge for the legions
to pass the stream in safety? I would
lay my body down across your little feel
for the Romans to walk over:" Saying
these words he entwined his arms around
the slender waist of the young girl, who
for a moment allowed herself to be press
ed to his heart: but catching sight of An
drada advancing in the distance, she es
caped from him, and continued her way
toward the river. The course of the water
had been turned bo as to excavate a deep
fobte. destined to hold the treasures which
the Dacians wisned to put in safety
dreading a fresh invasion of the Romans.
Andrada rejoined Bicilis and bade him
jrucr the prisoners to carry food aim
Â¦Nothing to the Cave of Oozia. beneath
the IX-va Fortress. There was their last
refugeâ m the impregnable mountain, near
to tne mines of gold, so attractive to the
cupidity of the Romans. Bicilis listened
m silence, and, preceded by the prisoners
in single rile, he passed through the iron
gate which led to the cave. A narrow
pass beneath two giant rocks conducted
him to ih!s last and only safe refuge of
the Daeians. lie paused at the great
gate and, while pretending to examine it,
withdrew the bolt, took It away and
Jlung it into the stream of the Slrau,
which flowed close by.
"What could he have been saying to
Fausta?" thought Andrada, and calling to
her from the river bank, he said "Do

that of the prisoner whom you go there

Fausta followed the direction of Andrat
cap hand, which pointed to a fortlfled*
tower. . -
"i wUh 1 were dead." said she. "If
you love me. Bicilis, put an end to my
miser}': talie your sword and kill me
now:"
"Andrada has no feeling," cried he;
""how tan she torture you so cruelly!" At
these words hot tears streamed from
Kausta's eyes.
"It hurts the shoulders and the heart
as wellâ mine, at least." replied he, as he
took down the coffer and gave it to a Ro
man prisoner to carry.
"Leave it where it is, Bicilis,". said she:
"it does not hurt my shoulders so very
much."
"Never!" cried Audradn.
"We shall see as to that," murmured
the Roman maiden, and her white teeth
shone between her tightened lips.
Kau:=ta was not far on her "way when
she encountered the young: Dacian, Bicilis.
who grew red with anger as he saw her
bending under the weight of her heavy
i< ad.
"Ah: then it wiM be you who will have
to c::rry the bunlecs in Rome, as I do

re^tfd her sIpds toward the river.
"Twice, in .truth, has mv father been

frowning eyebrows the expression
changed to onÂ» of somber and dull anger.

Andrada's hand shook as she filled to

hesitating Decebal raised it to his lips and
took a long draught. ,
"It reanimates one,"- said he as he
passed the cup on to the others, who. in >
turn, all drank of it in silence." Soon a
gentle lassitude penetrated their power
ful limbs and weighed down their heavy
eyelids. J .
"The rest for me." said Andrada," onco
more filling the goblet. "My father, 1*

the cup to her lips, but a rapid movement
caused it to fly from her hand. It was
Fa vista, who, with an air of mocking
triumph cried* "To Â¦ Rome, " Andradaâ to
Rome." ; But the words died on her lips
as Andrada quickly drew a dagger from
her, waist scarf arid thrust It IntoFausta's
throat. A Jet of blood spurted out as shÂ«j

Andrada was supporting herself by the

her' wound. She raised her foot .to ward
Bicilis. as if'to crush'a serpent." At the

She smiled feebly at him. . ., ;

*or upward of an hour thereafter the
detective's umbrageous associate contin
ued to lead the way through the dense
bristling timber growth. Then, suddenly
urgins.his horse up the side of a slight
elevation, he finally emerged into a smail
glade at the summit, in the midst of
which stood a, rude hut constructed of
ironwood logs and roofed over with a
thatchwork of palm leaves. As the horse
men approached this rujtlc abode there
appeared in the open doorway a burlv
evil-faced Mexican with a repeating ri.'le
resting conveniently In' the hollow of his
arm. At the sight of this ferocious-looU
ing Individual the. newly arrived bando
lero hastily drew rein and proceeded to
introduce^ his strange companion to the
custodian of the premises, whom he in
turn announced as El Capitan Chavez
the head of the outlaw community. This
formality, having " been disposed of the
horsemen dismounted, and after caring
for their jaded animal'? accompanied the
wicked-looking ch'ef into the interior of
the ironwood castle. "
At first the detective was puzzled at the
limited proporrlons of . the nefarious or
ganization, the membership of which he
had always beMeved to be . of a most
formidable character, but which now ap
peared to be restricted to Chavez and one
follower. Howover, in the course of the
evening, which had now set in;. the seem
ing mystery wus. cleared by the appear
ame' of addltional^members of the. band,
who dropped in singly or in couples, un
til at length a company of twenty- as
vicious and uncompromising; villains had
assembled as It was possible to band to
gether In a slrgle fraternity. To each
of these the stranger was duly Introduc
ed as the hero of the latest rustling ex
ploit In the stock country to the north
ward.'and, as a reward for the inglorious
role he had assumed, was regaled with
many a^ boastful narrative of a similar
character, Involving the most damaging
admissions possible against .the various
craftsmen -present. The leader, in partic
ular, was revealed as an especially choice
scoundrel, for not- only had he planned
and directed -various thieving enterprises
executed by his followers, but had also,
from time to time, perpetrated numerous
villainies on his own account, in all of
which accomplishments he took an exces
sive pride. But most significant of all
his vaunted achievements was his boast
ed participation in the recent encroach
ments on the very cattle ranch belonging
to the detective's client. The face, more
over, of the newcomer's single-handed
raid in this same connection won for him'
the most enthusiastic admiration of the
swarthy bandit chief, who shortly pro
posed another excursion of ' a like char
acter into the\same promising district.
The detective, however, while heartily
approving of this arrangement, argued
for a postponement of the undertaking,
ostensibly'that he might rest, but in real
ity for the purpose of first thoroughly ac
quainting himself with the bandits' re
markable desert strongholdi For a week,
therefore, he continued in the locality,
riding about from one to another of the
robbers' camps In the ironwood forest,
'lhe various retreats were scattered
about 1 over a radius of a dozen miles,
each so located as to command a view of
the grove for miles around, and at the
same time remaining practically Inacces
sible excepting to those entirely familiar
with the environing jungle. At length
when the detective felt that he had suffi
ciently mastersd the situation, he signU
fled his readiness to accompany the im 1
patient Chavez on his prospective raid.
The - latest plan of this enterprising
worthy was to import a number of calves
Into his mountain domain, thus establish
ing a nucleus for a cattle-raising indus
try "of his own. Now. as previously ex
plained, the mere feat of crossing the
Intervening desert waste was a sufficient
ly harassing ordeal, and the additional
task of transporting a colony ef calves
over its ninety-odd stifling miles struck
the detective as being little short of ap
palling. However, It was not for him to
dissuade the ambitious Chavez from his
undertaking.
The bandit's scheme was- to first steal
the calves and then hold up some unsus
pecting border teamster, deprive him
of his conveyance and utilize the same
in transporting the living plunder to his
desert stronghold. These border teams
ters, he argued, always carried a liberal
ry*r FRONTIER settlement in Lower
[ I California Is at best a scant insti-'
I I tutionâ so scant that the lowliest
\. I <Â¦' the Mexican pueblos beyond the
X bordering gulf assumes an almost
metropolitan aspect by way of
oomr-arison. And from the most remote
cf thÂ«tse peninsular rancherias to the
heart of the ironwood forest among the
Sierra de las fXcapas It is many a weary
league. All of which explains why the
rural police of the border hamlets studi
ously abstain from projecting themselves
thither. And if these tireless desert rid
ers will pause at the threshold of the
thirstf. sweltering plain that engulfs the
Â£:ttan* grove, hardly stranger is it that
the American officers from the green val
leys of Kan Diego or even from the broil
ing regions of Yuma avoid the pathless
route thereto as they would avoid perdi
tion. But for all that, the conscious eyes
cf the law Â«tre often cast longingly in the
tirectioa of the ironwood oasis. For this
singularly inaccesiLle locality is an asy
lum for more than one transgressor, who
for years has set at naught the potency
of the law he has violated.
Now, did the law in question belong t<>
the Mexican code it might make a diuer
ence, so far as the first mentioned guar
dians of the frontier axe concerned, for
it must be admitted that there is no
desert too drear for them to traverse if
actually obliged to do so. Eul, unxor
lunately the ofTense of the fugitive Â«s in
variably against the big nation to the
northward; hence, the apprehension of
the culprit must needs involve no end of
International negotiations on the part of
his. prosecutors. And even witn his uucu
tnental authority in hand, the American
txecuttir discovers his task lax lium con
summated. To extradite a prisoner is
or.e thir.sâ to capture an unfettered Ues
jK>rado is another: yet to success
fully bring him to justice involves bo,th
of these more or less complicated detaus..
Upon presenting his credentials at the
r.atif)::al lÂ»oundury line, the American of

assurance that his man is somewhere in

Ever since the suppressing of the noto
rious banditti in the earlier annals of
< slifornla. this remote southern region
has been the common objective point for
every desperafo criminal who, having
irojie the extreme length 01 his tether,
suddenly realizes the necessity of hastily
evacuating that most exemplary com
monwealth. Only a small proportion of
the refractory spirits who have from time
to time headed that way have successful
ly overcome the manifold obstacles that
naturally beset t! eir flight, the greater
number either having been captured be
iore reaching the line, or accomplished
5nis only to perish from hunger and
thirst In the pillles* desert beyond. But
even the comparatively small minority
who have eventually contrived to reach
the coveted though desolate goal in the
fastness of the Sierra de los Cucapas
constitutes, at the present period, a col
ony of no diminutive proportions â as such
colonies go.
It may be that the evidence relative to
this community's existence is regarded in
the higher official sources as too slender
to warrant a sufficiently vigorous move
ment toward its extirpation. . Be that as
It may. there are officers In the far South-
was the circumstance of Detective-Ins
lty's" nocturnal visit thereto any excep
tion to this rule. On the contrary, the
occasion in question witnessed an un
usually laige yuihering of this character,
ai;u, . as ni.jjht oe supposed, the au-au
sorbing topic was the latest unsuccessful
raid across the border, involving a iiveiy
speculation as to who the provable ot
lendt-r might have been. â¢
Lnder such wrcumsiances it took the
detective but a short time to determine
which members of the assemblage were
in sympathy with" his ~ recent e.capaue.
rinai.y sinfeiing out one of the inojt
promising oi* i.iese scoundrels he cal.ed
nlm to one side and confessed hlmse.f
as the. fugitive, staling, moreover, that
he had a .me steer at least to show for
hid effort, which he waj anxious to dis
pose or" to advantage. The detective's
Keen intuition was strikingly hm.-itr.ii.2d
in the selecting of his man. for not only
did he readily consent to attend to the
matter ot the steer, uut. uefoie me trans
uctiocrwud accomplished, he admitted
himself a. member of the ironwood fra
ternity and invited the detective" to ac
company him to their, distant stronghold.
Captain Iris.ey. ot course, promptly ac
cepted the suggestion, as It was precisely
what he had desired to bring about, and
In older to accomplish which It had been
necesrary first to brand himself as a des
perate criminal. â¢ . - ,
.The journey lo the mountain rendezvous
was an ordeal which the detective, inured
though he was to hardship, never forgot,
for although the first hnlf of the distance
was traversed durinir the night the ris
ing -sun found the party In the very midst
of the dreaded alkali desert, which, as the
It was an irrelevant undertaking on the
face of it, and. as perilous as it seemed
absurd, for there is but one summary
punishment meted out to rustlers in 'the
Southwest and, when taken red-handed,
explanations don't go.
Hut little did George Insley care for
the danger; he keenly relished that ele
ment in ,his work, and as for the seem
ing absurdity of the actâ we shall see
presently. 'Just before reaching the line,
he deftly sepaiated a steer from the fly
ing bunch, and while the latter continued
blindly onward in flight, devoted his sole
attention to making away with his lone
quarry in an oblique direction across the
national boundary. The result was that
his pursuers missed him in the darkness
ai.u continued on after the scampering,
bellowing animals he had abandoned.
Ail this was transpiring within a fev/
miles of the little Mexican, pueblo of
Jacumba. and, as the detective 'antici
pated, thither rode the enraged cow
pur.chexs with the bulk of their recovered
stotk to invoke the assistance of â¢ the
ruiules in apprehending- the miscreant
Â¦wlib had perpetrated the theft. As for
the outcome of their importunities, it
was the same old storyâ a request to be
shown their requisition papers, and finally
the aggrieved horsemen were forced" to
ride horm.wurd. vowing, the while, they
would swing that rustler, extradition or
no extradition, if lucky enough to en
counter him on their way.
â¢ Meanwhile the latter Individual had
firivÂ«:i his purloined' steer up to the very
limits of the same pueblo, and having
ropul and tied his. captive, rode up to
thu cuartel just as the vindictive "punch
ers" were i:i the act of withdrawing.
Now, notwithstanding Jacumba's rather
formidable border police force, It Is un
questionably ono of the most iniquitous
liueblos that ever exuded the perpetual
fumes, of vile whisky and viler mescal.
However, a lurse percentage of Us popu
lation Is of a certain drifting character
that argues pmnly for the moral tone of
the community, and It is a rare interval
whefi one or more actual desperadoes are
not to be' found within its walls. Nor
west who know conclusively that men
who are "wanted" and wanted badly by
the California courts are to-day se ; urely
ensconced in the ironwood forest of
Cucapas. And the same officers will; tell
you that one of the secrets of. their se
curity lies in the fact that the criminal
colonists are almost all. if not entirely,
members of the native Californian ele
ment and. as such, have the sympathy of
the peninsuiar inhabitants, including the
iural police themselves. â¢ .
The most authentic Information regard
ing this illicit community was unearthed
through the personal enterprise of the
late Captain George Insley of Los An
geles, who. up to the time of his death,
but a few years ago, was regarded as one
of the most accomplished and efficient de
tectives on the Pacific Slope. Captain
Insley.. in addition to his sterling quali
fications as an officer, was a Spanish lin
guist par excellence, and being of a
somewhat dark complexion, had no diffi
culty, when occasion demanded it. of
passing himself olf as a native pa'sano.
For several years the captain had en
deavored to devise some plan of inform
ing himself concerning the nefarious
community beyond the Lower California
boundary linÂ», but the problem persist
ently baffled him. AOength he determin
ed upon a novel expedient. A certain
large cuttle ranch in San Diego county
had repeatedly been raided by unknown
parties, and iiuch of its lost stock had
been traced to the Lower California line,
where the trail invariably vanished.
Captain Insley had been employed â¢ to
work up the case, and he proceeded to do
so in his characteristic way of taking no
one, not even his own Client, into the
secret of his methods. Going to San
Diego one day the detective donned the
garb of a r.atlve vaquero. and struck out
into the hills lor the s ene of the Â» attle
raid. As evening approached he came
to the top of ;x high hill overlooking the
ranch of his client, at which point he
paused to adjus-t the little plan .he had
conceived in his mind.
From whore lie on his horse he
could plainly distinguish the landmarks
indicating the national boundary line ten
miles to the southward. Scattered
throughout the valley Immediately below
him were the herds of cattle hearing his
client's brand. Strprlinpr out a bunch of
these he rode leisurely down the trail,
and as soon as darkness fell, deliberately
cut thÂ«m off from the main herd and
started thorn on a mad stampede for the
line. Before ho had covered half the dis
tance, a chorus of .yells far in his rear
told him he was being pursued, which
was exactly what he had boih expected
and dfsirca. On and on he raced, the
distracted cattle, a half dozen in num
ber, tearing ahead like a whirlwind under
the slinging influence of his riuta lash.
supply pi water tanked along tne sides ot
the .r wagons, ami mis would enable them.
to accui.iplitn ilie enterprise with the ut
most facility. So tne excursion was ar
ranged entirely alon? the linea of this
unscrupulous rascal s reckoning, and in
Â«ue time, accompanied only by his newly
enlisted confeuerate, he set out for tha
north. "
' Now, the detective had plans of his
own about tn^s little expedition, ' which
were widely diverse from those Â¦ con
ceived by his resourceful companion.
His intension was to wait only until he
had his man safety across the line, when
he would promptly place him under ar
rest and at once convey him to the jail
at San Diego. But even the most careful
ly studied p>ans of the cleverest of de
tecuves are otten doomed to miscarry.
Ana so it proved in the present instance,
for as the two horsemen neared the bor
der me robber chief suddenly drew rein
and proceeded to arrange the programme
as follows:
His companion was to ride on ahead
and accun.iiliah the abduction of tha
calves; which he was to convey to a
deserted cabin which stood immediately
beyond the boundary line on the Califor
nia side. Meanwhile his contemporary
did not propose to be idle, volunteering
to ride fortn along the border in searcn
of the transportation facilities of which
he had so confidently dreamed. In vain
tue uetective demurred; he had experi
enced quite enough of this outlaw busi
ness.
Though temporarily , frustrated in hiÂ»
project and keenly disliking the Idea ot
losing sight of Chavez even for a brief
interval, the detective had no alterna
tive but to ride on and bide the oppor
tunity afforded by the return of his man.
But he dispensed -with that part of the I
programme allotted to him oy Chavez,
and rode straight for the abandoned
structure Indicated by that worthy. It
was late in the evening when he arrived
here, and he waited until far into the
night without any sign of the bandit's
approach. At length his fatigue arising:
from the long ride across the desert
overpowered him, and he fell into a trou
bled sleep. - How long he had remained
thus he aid not know, but suddenly he
became conscious of a low, rumbling:
sound outside the cabin. Springing: to
his feet, he listened intently. The sounds
were growing fainter. He hurried to the
door and peered. into the darkness, just
tinged by the gray dawn of morning. In
the faint light cf which he discerned a
great, bulky object moving away from
the cabin in the direction of the line. A,
grave apprehensiveness seized upon him.
Could It be that Chavez had returned,
and. finding him asleep without having
performed the part assigned to him. had -
decided to return in disgust to his desert
retreat?
The 'line was less than WOO yard3 dis
tant, and the prospect of the bandit's
escape was little short of maddening.
Raising his voice he shouted after the
fast vanishing figure. By way of re
sponse a curse was hurled back at him
out of the gloom. He recognized the
voice beyond a doubt as that of Chavez,
and his worst fears were, therefore, con
firmed. But he would not give over at
this stage of the affair without a deoper
ate effort at the bandit's capture. Spring
ing forward he hurried at the top of his
speed after, the retreating vehicle. As ha
came up behind, he perceived the outlaw ,
standing upright in a great lumbering
cart of Mexican design, drawn by a yoke
of oxen, while his own saddle horse fol
lowed In the rear. Evidently he did not
propose to sully his reputation amonjj his
followers by returning to them altogether
empty handed. By the time the detectlv*
reached the end of the cart, the Â¦ line,
marked by a dry arroyo, or river bed. was
â¢but a few yards further on. Without a
moment's hesitation the officer sprang .
into the jolting cart, and as the bar.tllt
faced sullenly about he looked Into tfce
muzzle of a leveled revolver.
"You are my prisoner," exclaimed thÂ«
officer, "stop your team immediately."
. For an instant the bandit failed to
grasp the true situation, and he stood as
if petrified with amazement, Â¦â¢vhlla the
ox team plodded steadily onward. ThÂ«
next instant the wheels grated on the
stones in the bed of the river. The ne
cessity of decisive action was Imperative
if the arrest was to be legal. Both men
realized the situation. The bandit deferred
stopping the team, yet the detective could
not shoot down an unresisting man, even
though be were a branded criminal.
But ne must act quickly, if at till. With
a sudden movement he reached forward,
and grasping the outlaw about the body
hurled him through the open -jnd of tha
cart, landing him fairly on his tack in
the bottom of the arroyo.- In another In
stant the detective was upon him. and be
fore the prostrate man could recover him
i self a pair of handcuffs were snapped â¢
about his wrists, and he was a pr^oner
on United States soil. The remainder of
the detective's work was comparatively
easy,> and by noon that day the captive
bandit was safely lodged behind the out

ty trifles that we wish to bring to the
lront In this room. We will prepare to

cation which recommends' It most highly
"LAVf is that it is also quite inexpensive.
What more could we ask for our back

Â¦ This. is one of the secrets of simple and
good effects. You need not study ,your
backgrounds as artists do in the com
position of their pictures, unless you wish
to make a : specialty of decorative work.
But It is necessary to give some thought
to this subject;: of keeping your back
ground clear :and simple in treatmentâ
or much of the, money you may spend for
decorative articles is wasted. To -return

.The difference between the feeling of
pride with which one exhibits a homer
which is comfortable, beautifully adorned
and attractive, and the shame with
she allows. others to perceive that life in
her home Is shorn of both comfort and
beauty is Just the difference between hap
piness and misery. A lack of means no
longer furnishes sufficient excuse for a
failure to accomplish this. The materials
which are' now at hand are? often of so
inexpensive a description that they fall
within easy reach of the smallest purse.
The great point is to select the right thing.
Things have to - be bought and homes
have to be fitted up. -Human 'life demands
certain accessories, and I think that our
study should be to buy these necessities
with discretion and always with an eye
to the beautiful. . . â¢ . -. ; - - â¢
It is an established fact that beautiful
colors, graceful lines, and harmonious ef
fects have actually an exhilarating influ
ence on human: beings. Naturally then,
our lives are constantly .'brightened and
lifted out of the common place by beauty
In our homes.
To look at a beautiful object, to listen
to an exquisite strain of music, we all ad
mit, gives usâ for a moment at least â a
thrill of enjoyment. Every such thrill
that we experience sends us along the
road of life with a fresh impulse of
strength and vitality â thus. It is worth
while to bend energies that are ' often
wasted In other directions toward the
higher one of filling our livesâ as "'far as
circumstances will allow â with beauty.
Art in the Some.
' This means In a broad senseâ to my un
derstandingâthe introduction- into 'our
daily lives of a feeling for the/truly, beau
tiful in line and color, and â a correct ap
preciation of harmony In combinations. Â¦'
In order to work up to real judgment
and discretion we must first rid ourselves
of all fondness for tawdy cheap looking
effects however glittering they may be.
There are certain lines to be laid down
and adhered to In a deliberate cultivation
of taste; and having made a study of it
for many years, I feel that I may safely
offer a few helpful suggestions to those

IN offering to the people suggestions
on artistic house furnishing I would
remind them that the day for the
idealization of the home and its be
longings has passed away. We are
'living in a material and practical age.
Objects of household use are no longer
'called beautiful because of affectionate as
sociations; to be admired, to afford us
pleasure, they must now be beautiful in
themselves, and so recognized by all the
canons of art. A Â¦wave of artistic feeling
for architecture (which Is the outside) and
house decoration (which is the inside) of
our homes is sweeping over the country.
"When it has passed many beloved but
homely objects will undoubtedly have dis
appeared and a new feeling for the har-*
monious blending of rich, soft colors and
the effective arrangement of furniture will
have arisen.
A realization that it Is not the amount
of money expended which secures a beau
tiful result, but the taste and discretion
with which it is spent, is being forced
upon us. There Is no valid reason why
the mechanic's and the workman's cot
tage should not give pleasure to the most
refined tastes and yet, on the other hand,
it cannot be denied that the interior of
the millionaire's mansion often induces
a confused sense of failure. It must,
therefore, be admitted that the correct
and effective arrangement of one's house
hold belongings will have- to be with
many a matter of education. To help
those who need suggestions this corre
spondence Is to be conducted, and I will
gladly answer any clearly written ques
tions addressed to me in care of The Call
on this subject.
To those Â¦who build mansions and to
those who have to content themselves
with a cottage home there Is much to be
said, and it will be the object of this de
partment in The Call to afford practical
help to those whose ambition it is to make
their homes beautiful in the artistic sense.
And when I speak of a harmonious effect
I mean that product of the mind which
Fbows a discreet perception of the fitness
of association in certain things, of tho
feeling for color which throws the proper
Fbades of the right colors into conjunc
tion, which courageously eliminates all
discords and completes its gracious work
by setting each thing in * precisely Ita
prefer place. There are Individuals wrw
are born with this faculty. Such a or/.
can literally cause the desert to blossom
as the rose, for she can create a charm-
Ing home in the midst of barren surround
ings, and others can make themselves, by
careful thought and a etudy of the sub
ject, nt for this work of home making.
A exeat deal is said in these days, about
environment, and it Is conceded that the
elevating influence of a refined and beau
tiful home cannot be overrated. '
There are many desirable things In life
of which a Â¦woman of narrow means has to
deny herself. The slender purse renders
therr impossible to her, but an attractive
and charming home lies within the possi
bilities for every woman who earnestly
desires it, no matter how short her purse
may be. Let her begin at once to beau
tify It in every little way which upon
careful thought suggests itself.
The Unlovely Conveniences.
There may be In It objects which for
years have caught and held her eye with
a sense of repulsion. She has looked at
them unthinkingly, but she has never put
them out of sight. She should, therefore,
b-egin her Â¦work by making a clean sweep
of all unlovely objects. There are many
articles, as we all know, which are neces
sary, but far from beautiful, that we are
compelled to have constantly and con
veniently at hand. These may be so
placed,^ so disposed of by an intelligent
and determined woman that If not alto
gether hidden they will c*a*e at any rate
Â¦to force themselves upon the attention.
Then the first step toward making a beau
tiful home with slender means is to bring

There may be; halls presenting problems
to their owners In the way of -being too
narrow, bare looking. Inappropriately fur

\ The Importance of Color, j
* In making up an interior effect the most
Important thing to be considered is color.
Imagine an apartment furnished in the
simplest style, . but in .which the colors
are as carefully selected as they would
be upon the canva3 of j a charming pic
ture â all softly brilliant, they melt into
one another, or, cool and quiet, they give
distinction to the light and "airy furniture
of the room. Contrast with this ajoora
in which the handsomest pieces of furni
ture are thrown thoughtlessly together.
Another point of value to remember Is
that a room which conveys an idea in its
decoration gives a more subtle pleasure
to all -who. enter it than one which ia
merely pretty. Â¦
If, for instance, one has means to build
a charming cottage home, complete in all
â¢ of Us cppointments, comfortable and fin
ished hi its details, appropriate in its dec
orations, he will undoubtedly make a'ter
rible mistake if he fievotes this money to
the building cf a large unfinished house.
If the style of the house assumes a cer
tain luxury of â¢ accessories and surround
ings and these are lacking, the .whole
thing is a failure. And if you live in a.
cottage, by all means keep it a cottage;*
study cottage effects and work them. out
thoughtfully and with taste and you will
yourself be charmed with the result. Un
less you have previously studied the sub
ject, you will be surprised to find how
artistic and even luxurious a cottage may
become. '. - Â¦* , . .
The cottage idea does not exclude a li
brary, for one may have a long, low room
lined with books in a cottage. French
.windows may open from this room on
a terrace bright .with flowers, and deep
embrasured casement. windows may have
cushioned seats where one may 'read as
much at her ease and in as deep seclu
sion as she would find An .the most izn
' posing. mansions.
Â¦ The cottage idea does not exclude oil
paintings and exquisite water colors, Cop
ly prints and etchings, nor good plaster
. casts of world-famous pieces of sculpture
nor rarely beautiful Chinese jars with
growing plants in them. ; All of these
beautiful things may be used in a'cottaga
and yet the house. will not lose Its charac
teristics. The point I 'wish to make 13
this: It is much better to build a wide
spreading, roomy, cottage or. bungalow to
furnish if with light and inexpensive fur
niture, curtain it throughout with white
muslin and pretty figured cottons and
through the rooms scatter articles of real
artistic valueâ pictures that delight a con
noisseur, curios that would be of Interest
I to. your /most ' cultured and intelligent
fuests, rugs from Oriental loomsâ than to
uild a more pretentious house and be un
able^to carry to a satisractory : finish all
of inelaborate suggestions. As a woman
aptly said the other day: In referring to
i her expendlture,"Every thing depends upon.
1 thescale you' start in; if you go'on an ex
pensive scale there la no telling- where you
will end.",.. And I say to you, if you start
in on a lower plane, realizing all the time
your limitations, you may be able to mold
everything to . such completeness â¢ that In
the end you will attain the more artistic
effect. , â¢
flowers that 'you might use would show in
the same charming and effective way.
A clear wash in water color â in other
words, calciminingâ for rough plastered
walls is an inexpensive finish and a good
background. There are also many cheap
papers with delicate well-toned figures on
them which are charming when the floor
has a plain matting or carpet on it and
the curtains are in plain colors. It seems
to me, with this much that is good, wiÂ»h
sheer muslin or soft white cheese cloth
curtains at the windows, it- is an easy
matter to render - a room attractive and
pretty. Â¦ t â¢'â¢."Â¦. '
. There is in many places a mistaken idea
prevalent that the Turkish rug is a lux
ury which is beyond the means of the
ordinary purchaser. Also, that to set the
pace with a Turkish rug means that one-
Is to be led into all sorts of extravagances,
and. that it looks well only with the rich
est accessories. Both of these Ideas are
mistaken ones, and It would be greatly
to the advantage of many people to dis
card them." First, as to price: Brus
sels or Moquet rug, an American "Smyr
na," will often exceed In price a rare,
soft-toned, everlasting and always beau
tiful Oriental one. Of course, there are
rugs and rugs, even when genuinely Ori
ental. "Sometimes, but rarely, they are
really ugly; but if one will, in selecting:,
choose one in which her favorite colors
predominate, if she will . assure herself
that these colors are softened so that they
,tone readily into one another (and this
toning is only accomplished by age) that,
in other words, there are no colors which
are crude and staring, she 'will be sure -
to buy a good one and will. never regret
' the purchase. "Whether the weave be that
of an Anatolian, with its silky sheen; a
Kazake, velvety and deep in tone, or a
cashmere, with its heavy fringe and its
Indian designs, she -will extract a thrill
of pleasure from it every time her eye
encounters its soft beauty. A word as to
the purchase of a cashmere: I would ad
vise the avoidance of those which have
a strong yellow. In them. Many very
h,andsome Â¦ pieces present a strong yellow
against a dark background and running
as a border into the fringe. If this light
thread is white instead of yellow and the
fringe is .strong, pure white, you have a
much more valuable . rug and one which
will look well wherever you place it.
Concerning Oriental Bags.
To the critical visitor it is pretty sure
to strike the note either of harmony or
discord, which will appear upon further
exploration. The importance, then, of
.treating this portion of a dwelling with
careful thought is palpable to all thinking
people.
Again, when a house has stately pro
portions and an imposing effect Is the
one aimed at. it remains simply a. hall
way, but is so clothed and embellished
and dealt with as to impress the beholder
with the dignity of its mission. It is the
first part of a house to present itself to
a guest. It leads to the inner, more pri
vate portions of this temple of domestic
life. It must, therefore, put its best foot
foremost, /as its expression will be con
sidered a' sure indication of what is to
come afterward.
Since : architects, householders and dec-
CTators have unanimously recognized re
cently the necessity of an ethical and
artistic consideration of the home, these
indications of crudity are passing away.
Now often we see the hall space widened
into a broad, open room. Sometimes,
where si>ace is a consideration, and the
hall can be scarcely more than, an en
larged vestibule. It is richly and cozily
furnished as a. reception room;, again it
spreads out into a great, airy living room.
Its central and get-at-able position in the
house peculiarily fits it for this adapta
tion.
There was a time, which we have left
not far behind us, when in the modern
conventional house the hall was often con
sidered solely as an entrance way to the
rooms which opened out of it. In thin
cs.se it was narrow and also frequently
bare and ugly. I have seen many com
fortable homes Â¦which boasted well fur
nished, cheerful rooms, and 'which yet re
pelled intensely at first glimpse by usher
ing you through a scantily furnished, un
embellished, narrow hall â a mere passage
way. In fact, to these pleasant apart

San Francisco has a mest creditable
reputation in regard to appreciation and
patronage of operatic entertainment.
While the year 1867 did not exhibit as
many eminent theatrical luminaries in its
arrival^ as are found in the diaries of
18C6, it brought to this coast many play
ers comparatively unknown, some of
whom became prime favorites here, re
ceiving indorsement and encouragement
of great value to tiiem in after days.
There were few accidents of a serious
nature and no deep shadows cast over tha
stage for some time after poor Dan Set
chell. the comedian, sailed for Australia
January ZO, 18GG, on the good ship Trieste,
which was never heard from thereafter.
One of the great favorites of that day
was Harry Jackson, the versatile comed
ian, who distinguished himself by play
ing in grand and light opera, all lines of
dramatic work and as the leading clown
with Lee & Kyland's circus, all inside of
twelve months.
His son, Harry Jackson Jr., who opened
the Dewey Theater in Oakland a few
years ago, is a successful dramatist, com
edian and manager now playing his own
clever sketches in the vaudeville Houses.
The younger Jackson made his first ap
pearance on the stage January 26, 1866, as
a child, playing Emmeline in "The Old
Corporal" at Maguire's Opera-house.
Harry EdWards, the favorite actor, who
for many years remained In San Fran
cisco, came here with Julia and Mary Cor
coran, Heine, the blind violinist, and his
clever wife, and the dashing Lady Don,
all the way from Australia, about the
same time that^Madame Celeste, the gTeat
French actress, made a short stay here,
en route to the same country.
; This was in the fall of' '66, 'and Mr. Ed-

It. was related of the handsome Ottille
that in her early triumphs on the stage
she created a strons competition for her
favors among the.. young officers at the
German court, and that on one unfor

such a high temperature that they in

attention cf amusement seekers . in
San Francisco was specially attract

at Woodward's Gardens by an adver

be 25 cents. The gardens had been a pop
ii!ar Sunday resort for some time pre

picnics and other gatherings for which
they were not too far from the city.

Throngs of people trailed the weary
way to the Cliff House in the early days
eager to witness the acrobatic trials of
the numerous performers from the cir
cuses who essayed the difficult feat of
walking the tight, rope from the balcony
of Foster's old hostelry to the nearest
Â¦eal rock, a distance of SIS feet.
High winds frequently made the at

made the exhibition all the more attrac

boom in musical entertainments during
the latter part of the sixties will remem

son English Opera Company in the sum

the title was illustrated by the cast of
"Sonnambula" at the Academy cf Music
July 9, in which five Howsons appeared
in prominent roles.
About this time there was given one of
the most unique entertainments ever of
fered up to that time. The "Moses Tay

on board the steamer at sea en route to
Panama. The cast included Charles?
Thorne Jr., Harry Wall and wife (Louise
Clarkson). Walter Leman and Mr. and
Mrs. Yeamans.

some of their gaudy guests.
These two modest men couUl by a word
wipe out not only the splendid sprig of
aristocracy, but his little country us well,
the shivers every time ne thinks he has
lost it, which happens every time that hÂ«
gets his headgear on hind side before.
While these men all constitute one large
official .family there are the gravest dis
tinctions to be drawn among them, ow
tng to rank of their respective countries
and also to the fact that there may ba
long-standing feuds between them \vh!ch
have never been healed by a healthy out
burst of war. Such, for instance, was the
coolness between Austria und Mexico,
which have never recovered from tha
shock of the Maximilian affair. This has
always to bo regarded In possible meet-
Ings between the representatives.
The importance of the doings of the
Washington diplomatic corps comes from
the fuct thut the great battle between
with him. As It is with him, so with tbÂ«
others.
As a rule It would seem that the lesser
tha power which accredits a representa
tive the more dignity do they invest him
with in the way of silks, furs, plumes and
golden decorations. The must gorgeous
of all In the diplomatic corps are the per
sons who represent Korea and Slam, coun
tries which are merely allowed to remain
on the map because some statesman who
has the say has not yet concluded that It
is time to erase them, Their Inherent
power has long gone by.
For rich elegance there are few who
equal the Chinese Embassador, and next
to the English he has the largest retinue.
Minister Wu wears a diamond In his hat
which is so valuable that it gives him
than from any written precept, still glveg
a great power in the matter of the. settle
ment of small questions of precedence
and practice, of which diplomacy largely
consists.
Each of the members of embassies and
legations wears the court costume of
his own particular country, and the result
is a mixture of fashions such as can bo
seen at no other place in America.
The Chinese gentlemen wear gowns,
their ladles wear trousers. The represent
atives of the Shah and Sultan wear their
hats In the house and even to church. Not
that they Intend any disrespect, but for
the simple reason that under the hat of
the Turkish Minister it is always Tur
key. He is always at home with himself,
and carries the. custom of his country
three star companies, could ever hope to
succeed. Each Is Jealous of his own dig
nity, of that of his country, and still
more of the possibility that In some way
unknown to him their luster may be Im
paired by too close relations with our
very democratic American nation.
Most luminous of all of the constellation
It IÂ»rd Pauncefote, the. personal repre
sentative of his Britannic Majesty King
Edward VII. Most luminous for two rea
sons, the first that his la the most active
ly powerful country represented, and the
second that either by accident or acumen
he was the first Embassador accredited
to this country, and as such takes place
as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. This*,
while merely an honorary position, and
aiiilnar more from courtesy and custom
THIS Is the most gorReous .aggrega
tion of humanity that was ever
gathered together In America. The
President and Secretary of^ State
representing America: und Embas

These are men. of more than peraonul
Importance. An Insult i or slight to one of
them would ba an Injury, to his country
and possibly a cause of war. Again, a
good word from one of them might on the
contrary, end a threatened, breach of na
tional peace.
To handle this galaxy of bright particu
lar btars is a task at which no stage man

CHICAGO. June 15.â The Tribune to
morrow will cay: E. H. Harriman was
the directing figure in two movements be
gun yesterday and which are expected to
affect every railroad running west of Chl
cero and St. PauL
What is believed. to be the first step to
ward a composite agreement between the
great roads running west of these cities
was perfected at a .conference held here
between Mr. Harriman and the officials of
the companies concerned. By its term
an ironclad agreement to end rate wars
and other complications Is expected to be
spread over all the roads In the northern
group, including the Northern Pacific, the
Burlington, the Milwaukee and St. Paul,
the Union Pacific and Northwestern and
the Great Northern lines. " . â¢
To the southwest the Santa Fe will.op
erate hand in hand with the Southern Pa
cific. It will be a "community of inter
ests" plan and provides that the Pacific
M&ll and Occidental steamship lines/con
trolled by the Southern Pacific, shall take
care of the Santa Fe's trans-Pacific .busi
ness:
The other move directed by Mr. Harri
man was the practical provision for ' the
transfer of the Chicago, Milwaukee" and
E t. Paul to the Harriman syndicate ' and
the turning of this line Into a link of the
Union Pacific system. This plan was ar
ranged at a secret conference held at the
Auditorium annex, attended by many rail
road men and a* number of bankers. Lit
tle doubt is entertained that the syndi
cate has obtained control of the Milwau
kee and St. Paul on practically the sume
lines that . J. Hi* secured the Burling
ton. The Btock of the St.. Paul road, will'
be taken over by the Union Pacific at the ;
Octotter meeting. It is reported that the
stockholders of the . former line will be'
offered 5200 of I per cent for every $100.
worth. of stocks, and that the bonds will,
be guaranteed by the Union Pacific, the
Southern Pacific ' and the Missouri Pa
cific Â»nd the Goulds, who are. said to be
parties to the transaction.'; Certain large
Btcckholders of the St. Paul, it is said,
have sold or agreed to sell, s'tock' amount-

; NEW YORK, June 15.â The Tribune to
morrow will say: The report v/as current
In Wall "street yesterday that a railway
combination' had been /organized with an
aggregate capital .of : $2,00O,0CO,000. The
combination was said -to include the St.

western, Northern Pacific, Wisconsin
Central, .Union. Pacific and Southern Pa
cific- J. . P. â¢ Morgan: was", said ' to â¢ be" the
financial backer of the combination.- Ac
cording to a prominent official in one of
the lines said to be involved, .the story
grew out of , the reported St. Paul-Union
Pacific deal, by which the latter Is said to
have bought a large block of stock in the
former. Little credence was given to .the
report In Wall street. â¢Â¦

GOVERNOR PINGREE
IN CRITICAL CONDITION
His Attending: Physicians, Although
Apprehensive, Are Still Hope
ful of His Becovery.
IX5NDON'. June 16, 1:30 a. m. â A consul
tation of physicians in former Governor
Pingree's room at midnight evidenced the
acuteness of his illness. Every effort has
been extended to check the exhaustion
from which he is suffering, and while the
physicians declare that Mr. Pingree has
fairly held^his own to-day, they are un
able to say that he is anywise improved.
The question new is whether his natural
physical strength will enable him to with
stand the exhausting strain of the last
few days. The patient was sleeping at 1
o'clock. A further consultation will be
held at 9 o'clock this morning. That Mr.
Plngree's condition is critical cannot be
denied, and his physicians do not disguise
their apprehension, though they were still
hopeful of a favorable result.

"W.. WASHINGTON, June 15.â Edwin H.
Conger, Minister to China, disappointed
the adnalnlstra.tlon to-day. Instead of ap
plying for an extension of his leave of
absence, as had been confidently expect
ed, Mr. Cong-er informed the President
that he Â¦would return to his post by a
steamer leaving San Francisco the first
"week In July.
Mr. Conger's anxiety to return to IV
fcing- Is explained by some persons as
due to the fact that he desires to be sure
of one position while reaching out for an
other. This attitude has caused consid
erable criticism by administration of
ficials. The Minister Is regarded as im-
pervious to hints, however, and is appar
ently certain that the President is satis
fied with the course he pursued In Peking.
At least this was the statement he made
after he had called upon /the chief ex
ecutive.
Mr. Conger was accompanied to the
White House and State Department by
his brother, the Rev. Everett Cong-er. ,
â¢who resides In California and who is in
terested in mission work. Mr. Conger
â¢was subjected to some rather embarrass
ing- Questions as to his prospects for, ob
taining- the Republican nomination for
Governor of Iowa. He answered such in
quiries by explaining that he was not a
candidate. Mr. Conger declared there was
no ground for the "belief that he Â¦was not
on the best terms with the administra
tion.
"I have been assured,** he continued,
â¢"that my course at Peking has met with
the full approval of the President and
the State Department. There is no foun
dation for reports oÂ£ a disagreement. I
have not the slightest feeling about the
criticisms made of my conduct."
Mr. Conger said the indemnity question
â¢would probably be disposed of by the
time he returned to Peking. It will be
his duty to represent the United States
in the negotiations for a revision of the
American treaty with China. He believes
the changes he is instructed to demand
will be beneficial to American trade in
terests. The Minister believes China will
receive ultimate benefit from its recent
experience, and that when the indemnities
are paid and order restored China will
again be in a position to develop her won
derful resources. Mr. Conger believe* the
feeling in Chi*a Is distinctly friendly to
America. â

NEW YORK, June 15.â The Journal has
this from Paris: The reception given here
by the Count and Countess de Castellane
at their new house continues to form a
favorite topi* of conversation, not only
because of the number of guests, which
exceeded 2000, but likewise because of the
irritation which the Countess manifested
at the attention with which her husband
overwhelmed the Infanta Eulalle. It is
perfectly true that the latter was the star
guest, having been, so far the only royal
personage to cross the threshold of the
Castellane mansion... but Boni's devotion
to the Princess was so exaggerated and
extravagant as to excite amusement and
ridicule on the part of his less exalted
guests, whom he so completely neglected
for her sake.

Dreibund Mot in. Danger.
During: the week the two questions
â¢which mainly oocupied public attention
"were the discussions In the Italian
Chamber of Deputies . relative to the Drei
l>und and Great Britain's attitude toward
[the Question of German} 1 maintaining a
â¢ garrison at Shanghai. -The press . ex-
Tjreesed the opinion that Signer Prinetti;
Ithe Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
cannot be relied upon by the other powers
forming the Dreibund, although -the news
papers incline to the belief tfaaf after
Friday** proceedings the continuation of
the Dreibund is assured. Government cir
cles never held a different opinion after
Premier Zardenelli's declarations to
Count von Bulow. K j
Regarding the attitude of tbe British
press toward the policy of Germany at
Shanghai and Lord Cranborne"s state
ments in Parliament, the Gerarian press
and Government continue to i" hold the
opinion that Germany, by the very terms
of the Yangtse agreement, is bound to
protect the â¢ Yangtse Valley. Besides,
Germany has the same right to keep
troops there as have Great Britain,
France, Japan and Russia.
Referring to the Washington cable dis
patches saying the United States does not
mean to protest against the maintaining
of a German garrison at Shanghai, the
Frankfurter Zeitung eays:
"This is a .very sensible conception of
the situation, since Shanghai is Chinese
end not English and the only country
having the right to protest Is Chinn. Ger
many has precisely the same right to
take care of her Yangtse interests and
commerce that any other country has."
Great Britain's Retreat-
A number of German papers duKInsr the
Treek Intimated that Germany. Great
Britain being practically powerljea6 for
the time, used strong pressure to bring
ebout thÂ« Anglo-German Yangtse agree
ment. The Tageblatt says:
"ThÂ© abandonment by Great Britain of
her Yangtse sphere of interest idea is
perhaps the most Bevere blow Gre?.t Brit
ain has sustained, since the South African
â¢wat began."
The Lokal Anzeiger prints a special dis
patch from Japan which says Cooint von
vValdersee had a farewell audience with
the Japanese Emperor yesterday and re
ceived a number of valuable presents. The
Vossische Zeitung says Count von Wal
derree will be created a Prince by Em
peror William after his return from the
far East.

YOKOHAMA. May 30, via Victoria, B.
C, [June 15.â The Cabinet muddle is not
only still unsettled, but it becomes every
day more complicated and hopeless of so
lution. The source of trouble, while dig
nified as a strife between the principle of
a party ministry, and that of an Inde
pendent .Cabinet, responsible only to the
sovereign, is almost 'lost sight of in the
pettiness cf the political squabbles which
Lave 'come .to', the surface, making It lm-'
possible for any statesman, without com
pleta loss of n self-respect, to undertake
the tiifk of> forming a ministry. '. ; :-
In the meanwhile Â¦ the impression has
gone sibroad that the difficulty has arisen
from the desperate state of the finances.
Nothing could tÂ»e further from the truth,
the financial status of the Government
being - sound and flourishing.
In other words," the trouble, should, be at
tributed j solely to | the, country's' inexpe
rience in the -workings of parliamentary
Institutions.' It is the natural outcome of
the f t>eriod of transition through which
the politics of the empire are passing.
Meanwhile much sympathy Is felt and ex
pressed for the Emperor, who in his ab
eorblng- interest for the success of the
experiment in constitutional government,
which he has freely granted to his. people,
row finds himself deprived of means to
keep It in practical operation, no help
coming. from any statesman in whom he
places confidence. ' .
Much consternation has been awakened
by the escape â¢ of a rat. The medical
authorities of the Imperial University en
gaged in experimenting on. some rodents
by the introduction of plague bacilli into
their veins, and one of the animals elud
ed their vigilance. As a consequence sev
eral rats have recently been discovered
in the hospital and were infected with the
disease. As a result the war .' against
them has assumed huge proportions. The
Toklo municipality has voted 30,000 yen.
rat traps by the thousands are distributed
among the people and a bounty of 5 sen
each Is offered for their capture. With all
this evidence of consternation there is no
need of fear that the disease can gain a
foothold In the country,' in which i meas
ures for prevention have become very ef
fective. While sporadic cases appear here
and there, they are instantly isolated and
the spread of the contagion is rendered
practically impossible. The authorities
do not hesitate to adopt the most drastic
measures In each instance, and as a re
sult the empire is to-day in an excellent
sanitary condition.

"Last Â¦ fall I contracted a severe cold,

"I cannot speak too highly of the valuo
of Peruna. I believe that I owe my Ufa
to its wonderful merits. I suffered with
catarrh of the head and lungs In Its 'worst
form until the doctors fairly gave me up.
and I despaired of ever getting well again.
"It took six bottles of Peruna to cure

Men and women are subject to catarrh.
tVomen are eve* more subject to catarrh
:han men. This is due to many causes,
rhe chief causa Is tha delicacy of her or-

remo sensitiveness of thÂ» nracous lin-
nx of every organ of a woman's body la
veil known to physicians. This ex-
plains why. In part at least, so few
women are entirely freÂ© from, catarrh.
A vast multitude of women have found
Peruna an indispensable remedy.

Tvomen, are praising Feruna as a remedy
for all forms of catarrhal difficulties.

LOS ANGELES, June 15.â Judge York
to-day handed ' down hls^decislon In the
case''' of . the Southern \ Pacific - Railroad
Company .- against the city of Pomona "in
favor of the city. . The action grew out
of the riot that occurred In that city on
April 13 last as the result of the railroad's
attempt to lay a track over land that the
city did not consider belonged to the com
pany. An injunction was issued-prevent
ing the company, from going any further
with the work until the suit should have
been settled. Judge- York's ; decision j vir
tually upholds the Salt Lake road in its
contention that it has the : right of way
over the contested ground. '-
Â¦ Judge York's decision takes Â¦ up : many
interesting and intricate Â¦ questions in
volved in the controversy.- The court dis
! cusses at- considerable, length the, law of
dedication- in its various phases pertain
ing to the "facts in question,- and holds
that all of the property, claimed by " the
city of Pomona. as public streets was ded
icated by the company for such "streets,
and that, the dedication has been accept
ed by the people, with the exception of a
strip i of land on the north side of - First
street about i ten feet wide and a - piece
known as "the section-house lot." Ac
cordingly, the judgment and findings are
as follows: â¢ >
"It Is ordered that the plaintiff, - the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, shall
have judgment quieting, their title to that
portion of the >?trip of land in controversy,
known as 'First street, between . Henry
and Elizabeth streets, north, of the width
of sixty feet, and to that portion^ fenced
in and known as the 'section-house lot';
that as to the remainder of said strips,
the land known and found to be public
streets the plaintiff shall take nothing-;
that the plaintiff shall take nothing - as
damages â¢ against ' the defendant,' and that
neither party -shall recover their costs."
; This decision ; sustains the streets lo
cated on the map of the property in ques
tion- as made out by the city- civil en
gineer on the theory of -dedication. The
railroad asked for $1000 damages.

Business Men and Mechanics of Navy- Yard Town Adopt
Resolutions Thanking This Paper for Its Endeavors to
Secure Recognition of the Merits of Mare Island
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF VALLEJO
APPRECIATES EFFORTS OF THE CALL
The case disposed of. Judge "Wofford
asked if both sides were ready for the
trial of C. W. Prince, Bert- and Will
Prince, father and brothers, respectively,
of Mrs. Kennedy, on the charge; of con
spiring to kill Kennedy. The State was
ready, but the defense - asked for a post
ponement until Monday." Judge Wofford
aaid he wished to call in another Judge to
sit in the case.
"I am not satisfied," said he, "that Bert
Prince and the old man were at the Ridge
building at the time of the.killing."
This seemed to Interest the father more
than the verdict just rendered arid the
prisoner raised her head and listened in
tentlv to the talk about her relatives.
When Mrs. Kennedy was led back to her
cell she had entirely recovered her com
posure and resumed her cool, indifferent
manner.
The murder of Kennedy occurred at 5:40
on the evening of January 10 last in the
new Ridge building," In the center of the
business district. Kennedy, who was con
tracting agent of the Merchants' Dispatch
Transportation "Company, was sitting at
his desk in his office when called to the
door by Dr. Cross, the woman's physi
cian. Mrs. Kennedy followed the-physi
cian closely, asked her husband if he In
tended to live with her, and receiving a
negative answer, began shooting. She
fired five shots, all of which took effect
and any one of which would have proved
fatal. Kennedy died almost instantly, the
only â¢ words escaping his lips being, "It
wasn't her gun." Before taken away by
the police the woman kicked the prostrate
man in. the face. Thomas Kennedy, a
brother 'of the dead man, tried- to wrest
the revolver from Mrs. Kennedy's hand,
and was struck- down by her brother. Win
Prince.
The couple were married in the Circuit
Court and two days before he y was killed
Kennedy . brought suit to have the mar
riage set 'aside,' alleging duress. He
charged C. W. Prince, the girl's father,
and Will Prince with forcing him to mar
ry her at the point of a revolver.
Mrs. Kennedy is 20 years of age and
Kennedy was 28. \ . Â¦' - '-Â¦
The jury took six ballots. The first stood
10 to 2 for conviction. They remained that
way until the last ballot. - The defense
gave notice of appeal.
Mrs. Kennedy calmly heard the verdict
read. A moment later she sank Into ; a
chair a.nd 'covered her . face with her
hands. Â¦ . Â¦Â¦; â¢ :,
While Judge Wofford was dismissing the
Jurors the prisoner sat with her chin rest
ing on her hand.

ing year was fixed at $1200 and 10 per cent
of all collections made from persons not
members of the synod's congregations.
It appears that in the . past the Rev.
Mr. Pearson,-, solicitor for the Swedish
Immigrants' Home, has received the au
thority of the board of management to
collect money for the home, he to receive
40 per cent of all moneys collected. It
was shown in the discussions that Rev.
Mr. Pearson often received as- high as
$200 or more in a single day for the home.
The action of the board of management
was severely criticized, and it was stoutly
affirmed that others were receiving en
tirely too much money for their labors in
a charitable cause. A resolution was
finally adopted, providing, for the election
by the synod of a committee which should
make a thorough investigation, of the
financial affairs of this institution.
JAMESTOWN, N. Y., June 14.â This
morning's session of the conference of
the Augustana Synod of the Swedish
Lutheran Church of America was devoted
to the presentation of the president's an
nual address and the beginning of the
annual election of the synod officers.

CHICAGO. June 15.â John D. Rocke
feller Is In Chicago to join with President
Harper and the faculty and students in
the celebration of Chicago University's
tenth birthday. Mr. Rockefeller intends
to take, a somewhat, silent part in the
festivities, and is expected to deliver no
public utterance, until convocation day,
the final day of the jubilee. Shortly after
7 o'clock this morning the distinguished
euest arrived on the university grounds,
and with Mrs. Rockefeller, who accom
panied him on his trip from the East,
repaired to the home of President Har
per. He addressed a gathering of co-eds
who besieged him at the entrance of the
president's home and then retired inside.
Mr. Rockefeller made four appearances
on the first day of his stay, the first of
which was at the class day exercises of
the graduating class on the campus. Then
he attended the baseball game on 'Mar
shall Field, was a guest at' the alumni
dinner in the evening and witnessed the
second presentation of "As You Like It"
by students on the university campus.
The senior class alluded to the Standard
Oil magnate's Income of $30,000 per day at
the beginning of the class-day exercises,
when they sang their song entitled, "John
D." The subject of the production was
present, and he heard the following lines:
John D. Rockefeler, wonderful man la he.
Gives all his spare change to the U. of C.
Mr. Rockefeller evidently had not seen
It in that light before, for his face took
on a puzzled expression. Then It relaxed
into a quiet smile, and from that he burst
into hearty laughter as the song pro
ceeded. . . , _
Ho will remain at the university for sev
eral days." â¢ . â¢. Â¦ , , .. , . 1

Bad Circulation is the cause of most of the ills that come with old age. With
advancing years there is a decline of strength and vigor â the machinery of the
body moves with less speed and accuracy. Because of the weak and irregular
action of the heart the blood moves more slowly, becomes impure and loses much
of its life-sustaining properties, and muscles, tissues and nerves literally starve for
lack of nourishment. "A sluggish and polluted circulation is followed by a long
train of bodily ailments. Cold feet, chilly sensations up and down the spine, poor
appetite and digestion, soreness of the muscles, rheumatic pains, hard and fissured
skin, face sores, chronic running ulcers on the lower limbs and other parts of the,
body â -thesexand many other diseases peculiar to old people are due to a lack of
healthy bloodand imperfect circulation. Restoration to health must come through
the building up and purification of the blood, thus adding strength and tone to
the vital organs and quick, healthy action to the circulation. Â¦ - ;Â¦
S. S. S. being strictly a vegetable blood remedy and the best tonic, makes it
the most_varaable and efficacious of all medicine for old people. It is free from all
mineral ingredients, and mild. and pleasant in its action. It cures blood diseases
of efery character, even those inherited or contracted in early life. As the system
gets under the influence of S. S. S. there is a marked improvement in the general
health, and: as richer and purer blood -begins to circulate through the body the
appetite improves, and there is a softness and elasticity about the skin that you
have not noticed for years ; sores begin to heal, pains in muscles and joints grad-
ually cease, and you find that it is possible to be happy and healthy even in old age.
Our medical department is in charge of physicians who make a study of blood
and skin diseases. If you would, like to have their opinion and advice in your
case,' write them all about it and you shall receive such information and advice as
you want. This will cost you nothing. Others have found our medical depart-
ment of great benefit to them- â their cure being much more rapid as the result of
some special directions received from our physicians. â¢

The Race
Does not depend on the start but on the
finish. It's staying power which carries
many a runner to victory. It's like that
in business. Many. a man starts off in
the race for business success with a
burst of speed which seems to assure
victory. Presently be begins to falter
and at last he falls and fails. The cause ?
Generally "stomach trouble." No man
is stronger than his stomach. Business
Itaste leads to careless and irregular eat-
ing. The stomach'and other organs of
digestion and nutrition become diseased.
The body is inadequately nourished and
so grows weak.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It
strengthens the stomach and so strength-
ens the. -whole body which depends on
the stomach for the nourishment from
which strength is made. Â« J
There is no alcohol in Â« Golden Medical
Discovery," and it : is entirely free from
opium, cocaine and all other narcotics.
Accept no substitute for the Â« Discov-
ery." Â¦ There is no medicine w just as
good " . for diseases of the stomach and
allied organs. :â¢*. *â¢ /
"Your 'Golden Medical Discovery* has per-
formed a wonderful cure," writes Mr. M. K.
House, of Charleston, Franklin Co., , Ark. "I
had the worst case of dyspepsia, - the doctors
say, ' that . they ever saw. â¢ After trying seven
doctors and everything I could hear of, with no
benefit, I tried Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery, and now I am cured.". .. \

P. H.' Idol; the popular manager of the
OverlandÂ»stage line, is always on the alert
to furnish additional accommodations . for
the patrons of his line. Only a few weeks
ago the Herald announced to 'its readers
that the company .was running
a daylight line "all the way to Scotia, g This
was a great convenience to passengers and
was duly appreciated. Mr. Idol,- however,
was not satisfied, and further increase
accommodations he has put "on a special
day passenger line from Ukiah. This
gives" WlllitS: two stages a dayâ a passen-'
ger and a mail stage arriving both from
the north and Ukiah, and a similar num
ber, departing. < ,The latest surprise was
sprung on the traveling public Monday
noon, when the passenger, stage arrived
from Ukiah. <. The people who Witnessed
the arrival were spellbound for a minute
at /the spectacle that greeted them. Up
to the St. James Hotel drove one of the
nicest traps that ever covered the road.
The rig , was purchased at a- cost of $ti35
from a Boston firm by Mr. ; Idol. The
wheels" are set so the wagon has a wider
track than any other rig on the road, and
the dish and angle make It almost im
possible to upset. â¢ It. is said to be safer
than, the- ordinary,; stage; coach. . Th6 bed
of the trap is inclosed and all baggage. is
shoved under. . the seat and out of sight,
there being a solid floor for the passenger
to rest his'feet qn. The four seats are, set
mu^h higher than stage seats, for the spe
cial purpose of keeping the passenger out
of the dust. -The seats are finely uphol
stered andjof a comfortable width. The
rig will be'drawn-by four .fine horses and
when loaded swill' have ".more, the appear
ance . of ; a pleasure party : than, a stage;
The vehicle is gorgeously painted' and is
complete , to "the merest -detail, having a
coach horn -concealed In a neat .wicker
basket at the : side. On : the â¢ hew ; schedule
the trap leaves Ukiah in the morning and
arrives- here at moon.' .Returning, leaves
here at 1 and arrives in Ukiah at 5 p. ' m.
A: passenger leaving Ukiah In the morning
would Â¦ take supper at " Scotia: the next
nightâ a distance of 142 miles. -< On jthe:in
itial - trip the trap" brought up four passen
gers." One thing more that- was , a" surprise
was the that- hereafter the
fare on Ithisr line . from â¢ Will! ts ; to iUkiah
would be $1.*. The $1 50' fare that had'for
merly prevailed;. was" considered; reason
able,- the distance . covered being 24 miles. J

well, Controller of the Treasury,. has ap
proved the decision of the Auditor of the
Treasury refusine to grant a refund of
$62 paid by the German Benevolent So
ciety of San Francisco as taxes and pen
alty on the business of a retail liquor
dealer, under the war revenue act.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
recommended the refund and transmitted
his recommendation to the Auditor,' tak
ing the position that the German Benevo
lent Society conducted a hospital for sick
members of the society. He held that it
was not a private institution conducted
for pecuniary benefit, but a public insti
tution founded and conducted for the gen
eral stood. It was admitted that wines
arid, liquors were given patients and
charges made ' therefor. . ;
In passing upon the question the Con
troller says that the statute defines a re
tail llauor dealer as "every person who
sells or offers for sale" liquors. It makes
no exceptions of hospitals i or charitable
institutions. . . *

SACRAMENTO. June 13.â It has hpen
brought to the attention of T. J. Kirk.
State Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion, that tne Board of Education of
Kern County is alleged to have ignored
the State textbooks in many important
In-stances, .thus setting at defiance the law.
which requires the State textbooks to be*
used in the schools. 1 In the course of
study issued by the Kern County Board
of Education, which the teachers are re
quired to follow on pain of punishment
for. unprofessional conduct, it is claimed
no mention is made of the State gram
mars, physiology, civil government or
speller.
State Superintendent Kirk was asked as
to what action he proposed to take with
respect to the charge. that Kern County,
is disregarding the law. He said:
"If it can be substantiated that Kern
County is violating the law by discarding
the use of the State series of textbooks
and if the remedy is vested In me I will
certainly uphold the law. I am ready to>
do it at any time, and if the facts are as
itprtsented and the matter can be
Drought to my attention in a legal way I
sha'.l not hesitate a moment to do my
duty and withhold Kern County"s share
of the State moneys when the. next appor
tionment is made In July."
Superintendent Kirk admitted that
many of the State textbooks are unpopu

Special Dispatch' to The Call.
WOODLAND, June 15.â One of the most
terrible , tragedies in , the history of .Yolo
County , occurred in Madison late ' this
afternoon.: A- barn â¢ fire resulted in the
agonizing death of two boys, Andrew and
Fred, aged 3 and 5 respectively, the sons
of Andrew Kramer.
The presumption is that they went into
the barn and started the fire themselves.
The structure was . of dry redwood and
very inflammable. The flames spread
quickly and the building was soon com
pletely enveloped.
The mother of the boys discovered the
fire and a moment later heard the screams
of the children. Several men soon arrived
but they were too late to rescue the boys.
The father rushed frantically into the
burning building and would certainly have
.perished if other men had not pulled him
back. i . .
The bodies were not recovered until the
building had collaDsed. _A horse and a
lot of hay were also burned.

The organization of the league has al
ready promoted activity in the | creation
of district clubs and Imparted vigor to
the anti-boss sentiment throughout the
city. â¢
There was a meeting of Republicans of
the Thirty-sixth Assembly District at
Rolander's Hall, Â« Twenty-eighth and
Church streets, last evening. Tempo
rary organization of a club was effected
by the election of Frank French . presi
dent, Joseph Scheerer first vice president
and M. W. Littlefield secretary. It was
resolved that the club should be free from
boss dictation and that the delegates to
the Municipal Nominating' Convention
should be selected and nominated in such
manner as shall give all sections of the
district Jus't and fair representation on
the ticket to be voted at the primary elec
tion. Â¦ â¢
Last night the rooms of the Republican
Primary League in the Baldwin Annex
were radiant with electric lights. Many
Republicans visited headquarters during
the evening and commenced the work of
the league. The directors are engaged in
the consideration o.f plans for extending
the organization to the several Assembly
districts of the city, with a view " of
awakening public interest in the ap
proaching primary election. The league
has no candidates to favor and no fac
tional interests to protect. It welcomes
the support of all Republican citizens who
are sincere in the advocacy of clean poli
tics and good local government. A cen
tral rallying point for Republicans is es
tablished, where voters may meet and
exchange . views.-
Republican Primary League.
If Federal officeholders are wise they
will keep out of State politics. The prim
ary election law will afford citizens an
opportunity to elect delegates to the State
convention of 1902. Republicans will not
require the assistance of the railroad com
pany or the Federal brigade in selecting
delegates to nominate a State ticket.
Lj-nch cannot use . revenue department
deputies to do politics for Governor Gage
or for any one else without the fact of
such use coming to light. As a precau
tion against such interference Senators
Perkins and Bard could pass the word
along the Federal line that the Govern
ment at Washington has no candidate for
Governor of California.
It Is suspected that Lynch is taking a
hand In State politics, and using his Fed
eral position to support a movement in
favor of the renomination of. Henry T.
Gage for Governor. It is well known that
he left his post of Federal duty in this
city to personally participate in the pro
longed Senatorial contest at Sacramento.
He brought to bear all the strength at his
command to secure the election of Herrin's
candidate for United States Senator. He
went so far in his blind devotion to
boss methods, as to exhibit a paper' pur
porting to^ contain a copy of a wired mes
sage from Senator Perkins advising that
the boss candidate be supported. Lynch
knew then as he knows now that Senator
Perkins never sent the message. It is a
mystery to many why the Senator did not
take immediate steps to punish Lynch for
this offense.
Senator Bard has not yet recommended
any one for the office, but word comes
I'rorn the south that he is inclined to sup
port Postmaster Kelly of San Bernardino.
Senator White's term, and as a matter
of right Mr. Bard should make the selec
tion.
When giving assent to the proposition
that Senator Iiard should name the man.
Senator Perkins said his colleague was
entitled tofe share of the patronage that
had accumulated after the expiration of
Senator Perkins some time ago readily
agreed to Indorse the recommendation, of
Senator Bard for the Collectorship of In
ternal Revenue. Since then great political
pressure has been brought to bear on the
penlor Senator to persuade him to favor
the retention of Lynch, but there Is no
proof other than rumor that the Senator
has resolved to cancel his agreement.
State Senators S. C. Smith of Kern, A.
A- Caldtrell of San Bernardino, Charles
M. Belshaw of Contra Costa and Marln
and Thomas Flint Jr. of San Benito and
Monterey, have petitioned the California
Congressional delegation to appoint an
ants-boss Republican to succeeu John C
Lynch, Collector of United States Inter
nal Revenue for the First California Dis
trict. Day before yesterday a delegation
of Republican State Senators visited Uni
ted States Senator George C. Perkins and
discussed the subject of appointing a rep
resentative Republican to the place now
held by Lynch. The term for which Lynch
was appointed will expire within the next
two months.
no opportunity to spread the doctrine of
the glad hand, and fte has a personal pop
ularity which makes him a formidable
candidate, despite the dangerous .oppo
sition which he has engendered.
What bothers the opponents of Clark is
the twofold question, ! Who shall succeed
Colonel Wright on the political throne
an<? who shall be put up for the Republi
can nominee for Mayor to defeat Clark's
aspirations? The tight must be made at
the primaries, for Clark will seek to con
trol them. ' "
Of all the .Republicans mentioned, the
most popular has been W. E. Gerber,
cashier of the California State Bank. But
Gerber would not take the office under
any circumstances. With* Frederick Cox,
C. W. Clarke, A. Heilbron and George B.
Katzensteln he recently acquired owner
ship of the vast Earl Fruit Company, and
this, with a half dozen other interests,
now demands more time than ' he has to
give. Gerber feels more like taking a
pleasure trip abroad than engaging In pol
itics, and his refusal is decisive. Joseph
Steffens, a director in Gerber's bank, is
regarded as a possibility. He has a clean
record and few enemies. Ex-Mayor Wil
liam Land, however, will probably -be
found to bÂ» the nominee should the Cav
anaugh-Daroux faction win out at the
primaries.
Wright's Name Is Mentioned.
Colonel Wright himself has been spoken
of as a candidate, but the friends of the
colonel assert that , he can contrive to
make a good living without asking the
people for an office, and he doesn't want
it as a mere floral tribute. ...
A Municipal League with reform." Ideas
is gaining ground and promises to figure
extensively in the approaching campaign
with candidates for Trustees and a can
didate for Mayor, who may and may not
be Clark. But Sacramento is used to be
ing bossed in the good old orthodox style
and is sighing for a leader. Colonel
Wright, sitting in the library of his brand
new Moorish residence on H street, does
not meet the popular conception. A man
must either run a saloon or have the
power of a great corporation behind him
to satisfy the local requirement. Colonel
Wright does not run a saloon, and in the
popular mind the severance of the tie that
bound the division superintendent to the
local political system is complete and per
manent. -
ANTI-BOSS REPUBLICAN IS WANTED
TO SUCCEED COLLECTOR JOHN C. LYNCH
Leaders of the State Senate Ask for the Change in a
Petition to the Congressional Delegation.
Clark Leads the Rivals.
But despite all this opposition, arising
principally from the Wright incident, and
in part from grudges which other inter
ests have against the present Mayor,
Clark seems to have considerably the best
of it for the present. The town is Re
publican by a few hundred majority, and
a Democratic Mayor has not been thought
of as a probability. Mayor Clark has lost
SACRAAIEXTO. June 15.â The retire
ment of Colonel J. B. Wright from the
post of division superintendent of tho
Southern Pacific means to Sacramento
much more than a mere change of rail
road officials. For many years past,
"Wright had been one of the local political
powers. -Since the death of Frank Rhoads
a coucle of years ago and the failure of
a new leader to succeed to and rehabili
tate that politician's prestige, Wright's
position in politics in this city and this
section had materially strengthened. He
vras at the very height of his power when
the announcement came that he had been
deposed from his place in the company's
service.
No official was too proud to visit
Colonel Wright at his depot headquarters,
and take advice from him, if not orders.
When Mayor George H. Clark a couple
of months ago made him a defendant in
the now famous oil land case and charged
him and others equally asvprominent and
powerful with fraud, the T supporters of
the Mayor deemed further political am
bition on his part absolute insanity.
But Clark is out for the nomination
again, and Wright Is shorn of his lofty
position in the railroad councils, and in
consequence of much, if not all, of his
political prestige besides. Yet everything
is not smooth sailing for Clark. There
are 3500 able bodied voters in the railroad
shops and railroad yards, and with them
as a class Wright stood and still stands
high. The large number among them who
axe stanch adherents of Wright insist
that Clark's suit against him was the im
mediate cause of his being deposed. In
consequence they have ready hammers
out for Clark. Cavanaugh and Daroux,
who were Wright's valued lieutenants in
many a political battle, also have a griev
ance against Clark, and threaten him with
defeat next fall.

debilitating disease from the human system,
restores the fire and buoyancy of youth, and
euppHea the strength of body and nerves that
all wish for but so few possess. Impotency,
nightly emissions, varicocele, nervousness and
kindred troubles disappear in a rnarvelously
ehort cpace of time, while any weakened or
ernaclated organs are restored In a. very few
days to their natural size and vigor.
When yon 6top to consider the possibilities
of lovine and belne loved as only strong, well
and happy men can be It does seem that any
.sexually weak man should no longer hesitate,
but write at once for the receipt which costs
absolutely nothing. There are no restrictions
Â¦whatever, as Dr. Llpes is anxious that every
afflicted man who needs it should have the
benefit of one of his free prescriptions with-
out delay. The treatment can be used in the
pri%-acy of your own borne without the knowl-
edge of even your most intimate friend or as-
E ociate.
Write to-day and learn that while the re-
ceipt costs you nothing at all. It may change
your whole existence from one of misery to
a. continuous life of pleasure and happiness.

The following letter which I received In
answer to Mrs. Alma Webster-Powell's
plaint against operatic conditions in Ger
many will be of interest:
. I SAX FRANCISCO.
-Pear Madam: The article by Mrs. Alma
Webster- Powell published In your column of
last Sunday should, certainly be of great value
to vocal students of this country. "While read-
Ing it I asked, myself, "What lesson will they
learn from it? Will they soon begin to real
ize that It will be to their and their country's
advantage to keep the 'bank book' they have
to have abroad In thi3 country?"
" Apropos of bank book, why should musicians
take exception to the necessity of money in
building- up tbelr particular business? May
not this prevailing idea of the musician fur
nish a clue to the freauent lmoosition of the
public In expecting professional musical ser
vices free of charge? I see that our Ebell So
ciety has even as one of Its by-laws that "no
talent contributing to their entertainment*
shall be raid!" .
What business or profession does not need!
money In order to make money?
And ir> reference to Mrs. Powell's condemna
tion of AVagnerian music as a voice-destroyer.
Mrs. Powell, whom I know personally, has a
high colorature voice.' She sings, for exam
ple, the part of the Queen of the Night in the
"Magic Flute." in its original key, a feat sel
dom attempted by the ordinary high sopra
nos, an F above high C being demanded. la
it not quite natural that such an exceptionally
high voice should not find its proper domain in
the roles of "Wagner's operas, which are all
written for the dramatic and not the lyrlo
soprano?
But had Mrs. Powell the necessary quality
of voice for the master's music she would mako
an excellent Wagnerian singer, like, for in
stance, Lllli Lehmann. wliom she herself ad
mires so much, though t.. Lehmann has
been a' Wagnerian singer and before the pub
lic for more than a quarter -of a century.
One must have the technique in order to sing
roles like the Queen of the Nifiht. while, un
fortunately, singers with no method can
"scream" a couple cf yeara at Wagner.
But because these proverbial "fools rush in,"
and even though they be in the majority,
should we therefore condemn work of the mas
ter? Are not his scores filled with annotations
of piano passages? And does he not continu
ally warn by these annotations against that
abominable shouting? Has he not laid tha
orchestra underzround. I so that the human
voice should be carried as on waves of the
musical Â»?a, not that it should howl in com
petition with an orchestral storm?
Anton Seidl Is an article on "Conducting"
says: ' /
Another thing: do not let your singers scream.
This everlasting forcing of the voice seems to
have become almost the second nature of Ger
man singers. "We scarcely ever hear on tho
stage nowadays, "Bllck Ich nmher in diesem
edlen Kreise," In a dreamy, restrained tone, or
a poetically ethereal, "O Du, mein holder
Abendstern!" or a whispered "Lass leh's ver
lauten toes' Ich dann nlcht meines "Wlllens halt
enden Haft <"Wotan)7" or a playful. "Du hoerst
nlcht drauf? So aprich doch Jetzt, hast mlr"B Ja"
selbst (n den Kopf gesetztl" murmured into the
ear of Eva. All this is sunir with full voice,
as if the purpose were to sing everybody elso
to deaths Listen to the representatives of Wo
tan if you would hear how they Ignore Wag
ner's frequent injunction, "to be suns in. an
almost totally suppressed tone." or to the
Walther von Stolzlnss. and hear them scream
the wondrous passages in the prize song, "Dort
unter einem Wunderbaum," or "Dort unter
elnetn Lorbeerbaum." which are marked "as If
in complete ecstasy" end "piano." Nor does
it occur to them to retard^the tempo a trifle.
Everything Is sung as if it were made over
one and the same last. Moreover, our Brun
hildes utilize the passage. ""War es so schmaeh
lich was Ich verbracht?" for exhibtlon pur
poses, as If to rebuke, as early as possible,
Wagner's Injunction, â¢ "to .be begun timidly."
The manner in which the scene of the Nornlf
13 given, if at all, is simply laughable end
scandalous. Similar offenses against < Wagner
might be adduced by the bookTul. So far Anton
Seidl, who certainly knew his Wagner and.
every musical and dramatic Intention of tha
master.
Is it not about time that we ahould create our
musical atmosphere? I am so tired of hearing:
the constant cry for "atmosphere." While a
former generation may have been perfectly en
titled to the classic grumble I deny any Â»uch.
right to the present age. yet the cry is kept up
In complete rorsetfulness or the faet that con
ditions have since changed so tremendously
that this eeho is simply an absurdity.
As a matter of education, after ' cnÂ» ha*
learned enough at home to tie an appreciative
traveler^ â and according to my experience that
takes a goodly timeâ traveling: may be of tx
cellent service, though I am of the opinion that
its value is often overestimated. But, â¢will you
tell me, where abroad can you find an opera
company of such magnitude and merit as th*
Grau combination?
Therefore, let' us all and everybody appreciate
this glorious country. Its great possibilities. ltÂ»

ONE of the few gratifying features of the diplomatic controversy over the indemnity de
. manded of China by the powers is the periodical recurrence of the original suggestion
of the United States that the matter be submitted for arbitration to' the High Court of
Nations constituted by the famous Peace Conference at the Hague. All the great
powers have appointed representatives to the court, and the tribunal is therefore ready for work.
Under the circumstances to refuse to give it work will seem very much like self-stultification on
the part of the nations that constituted it.
The position of Russia on the question is peculiar, and if her* statesmen were at all sensi
tive to public opinion either at home or abroad. they would be greatly embarrassed in their 'refusal
to arbitrate. Tne Peace Conference was called by the Czar, for the express purpose of arranging
just such international arbitration as is now proposed. ' The Ministers of the: Czar are supposed
nominally at least to carry out his -will and to promote all his plans for the benefit of his people and
the world. He has himself said that the - establishment of a, High Court of International Arbitra
tion is the subject nearest his heart;, and it is consequently surprising to find-his Ministers oppos
ing arbitration when offered under conditions so favorable as in this case.
The issue is certainly one that should be fairly and honorably arbitrated. The allied powers
entered, China expressly for the purpose of substituting civilization for barbarism. v It is admitted
that they have just claims for indemnity "against the Chinese Goyernment^but it is also undeniable
that China has counter claims that can with justice be made against the powers. Here then is a
chance for the Czar to attain a true fame as a just sovereign and a peacemaker among nations.
The High Court of Nations up to this time has been a nullity. ~ It remains for the Czar ; to deter
mine whether it shall become a beneficent reality or an organized hypocrisy. ..'. ''M .'--'-
ARBITRATION FOR CHINA.
WHEN George W. Cass made the old Chicago, Pittsburgh "ana 1 Fort Wayne -Railway a
part of the Pennsylvania-system and itVwas double tracked, making. a complete double
track road from Atlantic tidewater to Lake Michigan, it was regarded as a stupen
dous enterprise and- a marvelous advance in American railroading. The New York
Central followed with a four track road to Lake Erie, arid supplied Chauncey Depew with an end
less, subject- for after-dinner brag about the enterprise of the Vanderbilts. Now it seems intended
by the Union and Central Pacific lines to construct a double track from Omaha to San Francisco.
Such a facility will be of immeasurable advantage to the business of this coast, and as it will doubt
less be soon duplicated by the Santa Fe, it means a shorter time for freight, and passengers. As
other lines now have a passenger schedule of but little more than four days between San Fran
cisco and New York, that part of the traffic is not exactly suffering for more speed. But on a
single track fast time for passenger trains is secured at the expense ; of freight, as freight trains
have to lay out for passenger trains. The great benefit therefore will accrueto the freighting'Â¦busi
ness. As our summer freight is largely fruit and perishable, a shorter schedule is worth millions to
California. When through freight can go forward uninterrupted by the passenger traffic, freight,
time may closely approximate the present passenger time..
' In the interests of California will it not be possible for the. se'eond track to be laid outside
the snowsheds in the Sierra Nevadas?" Such an arrangement would enable the running of passen
ger trains, at least one way, :'n view of the mountain scenery which influences so many tourists in
taking a trip to the coast. It is true that such an exposed track might be thrown out of commis
sion for a time each winter by snow, but as the heaviest freight business is done in the summer,
such obstruction would not be serious. '
When useful improvements are under consideration this may well be -studied.

T* HE initial year of the new century
promises to be somewhat remark
able in musical annals for the un
wonted activity that has been and
is being displayed in the production
of grand opera. After a long slack sea
son In the industry, broken only- by a few
spasmodic efforts opera ward by Mas
cagni, Puccini and Leoncavallo, a kind of
operatic renaissance seems to have set in
in all the musical quarters of the globe.
Italy, France. England, Germany and
America are all under contribution to the
revival of grand opera, and one work at
least seems destined to surviveâ Pade
rew'ski's "Manru," produced the ether
day in Dresden, Germany. A cablegram
from Otto Floersheim, the Berlin corre
spondent of the Musical Courier, la a very
enthusiastic comment concerning the new
opera" as follows:
â¢ DRESDEN,-. -Germany, May 23.â Premiere
Paderewski's "Manru" took place before illus
trious International audience with unprece
dented success, Increasing In intensity from act
to act. culminating in over thirty curtain calls
after close. Music replete with original lyric
beauties; masterly worked up climaxes: char
acteiistic gipsy colors; wonderful orchestra
tion finely staged. Performance superb.
O. FT/>ERSHi:iM.
â¢ â¢ -.*â¢Â¦â¢
The book of the opera is by Alfred
Nossig, of romantic and old-fashioned
style, to which Paderewskl has done am
plo justice In a musical setting that, the
critics have characterized as a mixture of
the. Italian lyrical and German dramatic.
Tne opera has been three years In writ-
Ing.
On the same evening that "Manru" wag
produced another new opera was also
given at Covent Garden Theater, London,
Dr. Villiers Stanford's "Much Ado About
Nothing." Dr. 'Stanford's opera seems to
have met with only indifferent success,
notwithstanding the fact that It was pro
duced under the most favorablejuisplces.
David Bispham appeared as . Benedick, a
part for which he is eminently well suited,
and the rest of the cast was equally well
chocen. -The London Times has the fol
lowing comment upon the opera;
Dr. Stanford's opera -was. found to lack the
?ift of power and distinction required in a
work given under such conditions.- That the
comiioser Is a ?cholarly anil painstaking nra
siciiin is indisputable." The fact that his Â«vork
contains many merits which would have told
better , if it had been produced less /ostenta
tiously Is not to be denied. It is hampered
by the' libretto, which, like the curate's ens In,
the legend,* is only good in parts, and those
parts are purely Shakespeare's. The church
scene in the third act. in which the text Is
closest to Shakespeare. Is decidedly the best
part of the work.
The first fruit of the operatic renais
sance was the Siegfried Wagner opera.
i'Heizog Wildfang," nrs.t produced at tho
Munich Court Theater in March of this
year. Opinions of this second effort of
Richard Wagner's son seem much divided.
By some critics stigmatized as a dismal
failure and an effective damper to the
hope of those who had prophesied the
falling of the father's mantle upon the
shoulders of the son; others again have
claimed a mild success for "Herzog." The
libretto, which young Wagner also fur
nished In imitation of his. famous sire, \%
generally conceded to be hopeless and the
plot of 'the. opera perilously near a whole
sale, plagiarism of "Der Melstersinger."
A recent* performance of "Herzog Wild
fang"'in'Hamburg in connection- with, a
cycle, of Wagnerian opera' is said to have
met u with a considerable measure of ap
preciation.

lessly furnished the writhing victims of
his pen with that so much daintier morsel
for the purposes of vengeance an opera.
And. as if not content to. incur the conse
quences of only a personal unpopularity.
M. Bruneau, In .the person of his famous
librettist, Ernile . Zola, has challenged a
political enmity that In itself "would seem
almost sufficient to down any opera, of
whatsoever merit, that might be written.
"L'Ouragan," therefore, naturally re
ceived a somewhat warm greeting on Its
first production in Paris a few weeks ago.
Gustave Charpentier found the work of
extraordinary merit and Gauthier-Villlers
of the Echo de Paris says it is stupid and
tiresome. Others, In the facile prophecy
of the hour, say the opera is "epoch-mak
ing," 'while the opposing faction deny any
claim to musical value at all. Henry T.
Finck, quoting from Wolff's criticism in
the Berliner Tageblatt, . says that the
opinion of the public on the occasion of
the opera's premiere was markedly more
favorable than that of the audience at Its
first public rehearsal, when those person
ally antagonistic to composer and libret
tist were largely In evidence. The "yeas."
however, had It, and at the close of the
opera drowned out any dissentient voices.
M. Wolff says In effect that there appears
to be a quality of greatness in the work
of both Bruneau and Zola, though he does
not venture permanently to place the
opera.
And now as to two operas that arÂ© ' in
the air: Boito's "Nero" . and the Dam
rosch and Henderson "Cyrano de Ber
gerac." .'..".
The famous librettist of Milan, so Inti
mately connected with the beloved Verdi,
Is again coming to the fore. "His "Meflsto-.
f eles' ' will be given at the Tivoli during
the coming grand opera season, by the
way, and Is- being largely * revived in
operatic circles. "Nero" has been prom
ised to the public by Boito for more than
twenty, years, says the Italian correspond
ent of the Courier, and It now seems sure
that " the next I carnival . will j see - its pro
duction at La Scala, Milan. -*At a reading
of the libretto of the opera, -to which the
editors, the Breves brothers of Milan, in
vited the litterateurs and musicians, the
opinion was virtually unanimous that the
dramatic situations Â¦ and possibilities of
"Nero" are magnificent. \ , Â¦ ,
The "Concert-goer" Is responsible for

friend, after having successfully, engineered
his mighty nose "through the devious ways of

boards in grand opera. Walter Damrosch, it is
announced, Is now completing the score of the
opera, for which Wiiliam J. Henderson, the
critic, .has Written the book. Rumor says that
this will not only be the most ambitious thing
that the young composer has ever attempted,
but that it will be ' the mdst : notable achieve

THE appeals made by Frederic Harrison and John Morlev to the English public upon the
subject of the-Boer war remind one' of the appearance of Henry Ward Beecher in. Great
Britain at the crisis of our civil war. Our seizure of -the Confederate envoys Mason and
Slidell, and taking them from air English; ship on the high seas, came near, undoing .the
Union cause by inducing English recognition of the Southern Confederacy. That step would have
been followed by the Continental powers, and the prestige and position gained thereby 'would
have won the cause of secession. Even â¢ Gladstone believed the Union cause to be hopeless and
leaned the other way, and the British aristocracy, press and Parliament were against us. It was felt
in Europe that division of, the Union would destroy .the Monroe doctrine; and invite the Old
World to 'resume her estate in the New. The. designs upon Mexico had already ripened, and am
bition was whetting its "sword for, the carving of the Western Hemisphere by the Eastern. /It
seemed necessary in England to bring over only one more class to recruit the cause of Confed
erate recognition. The laboring and artisan portion of the people were against slavery and there
fore for the North. 1 But the blockade of the Southern sea ports, preventing the export of cotton,
had disused the looms of Manchester and labor, had been .reduced, to famine rations,
it was feared that these conditions would carry labor over to the South, and the seizure of Mason
andjSlidell was used as an appeal to their patriotism, for the British flag had been insulted.
In this emergency Henry Ward Beecher appeared in England as the 'champion of the
Union. His first speech was made in Liverpool to a passionate mob that at first threatened per
sonal violence, then listened and then cheered. That speech prevented recognition, and perhaps
did as much to save the Union as was done at Vicksburg and Gettysburg. He warned Brit
ish labor that every man who helped chain, the Southern slave was forging chains for all human
labor and was establishing 1 - the doctrine on land and' sea that capital had the right to own labor.
He attacked the British press for its strictures upon the motive and morals of our civil war, im
peaching it of hypocrisy, for "in all the world, in the wilds of Africa, Indian jungles and the islands
of the sea, the native heart stops beating at the sound of martial music,' leading British' soldiery
to new conquests."
Rising to greater heights as the mob became an audience, he said:. "Has love of country
run so low in Great Britain that the rising of a nation to defend its territory, its government, its
flag, is a theme for cold aversion 'in the pulpit and sneers in the -pew? Is generosity so dead in
England that she will not admire in her children the very qualities which have' made them proud
of their English ancestors?" In his climax he declared that the spirit of Runnymede was. not dead
and that "the North will fight this war through at all hazards and' at any cost. Anglo-Saxon Amer
ica, entangled in the meshes of slavery, will be free or perish."
', When his appeal was finished' the cause of the Confederacy was a lost cause. 'Europe
looked to English leadership, and Beecher proved that the real power of. that empire', lies with the
masses of the people, and that neither throne nor Parliament dare defy that power. Â¦ .
Understanding this one comprehends the final cause of the Boer war and the persistency
in its prosecution. When out of crowds on the London. streets rose the cry.to Victoria, as 7 she
passed in state, "Ma'am, please give us a go at old Kruger," it meant that war was already declared
by this source of British strength/the masses of the people. British, philosophers, students and
thinkers were against.it.- But the politicians do not fear them. They looked beyond, to the masses,
and shaped a policy to. their wish; hence the war. ,.'
Harrison and Morley may turn to' Beecher's remarkable campaign in their country, for the
Union, and learn from it that if they desire, to "change the policy which they denounce they must
get the same people with them that Beecher carried over to his side.

Between Taylor, and - Jones.The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday affirming the Judgment
and order of the lower court which de
clared In ihe case of Treasurer W. K. llc-
Kenzie of Fresno that the court and not
the Board of Trustees or Supervisors of
a city Js the final arbiter in dispute.
The Fresno Canal and Irrigation Com
pany had a contract for flushing the sew
ers of Fresno in 1S97 at the rate of MuO
rer month. The company's bill for the
closing three months* of the year was
?1200. The bill was audited and the city
Board of Trustees ordered Treasurer ilc-
Kenzie to make payment. This he re
fused to do. and the water company
brought cult against McKenzie and his
bondsman, J. O. James.
Previously, however. McBean, a con
taactor, had entered suit against the
Treasurer to recover money due him for
taking care of the city sewerage during
the year 1893-4, and had obtained judg
ment in the Superior Court. The payment
of this bill exhausted the surplus fund in
the city treasury, and when tho water
company's demand was presented ; there
was nothing with which to pay it.
The company then sued to recover the
S1200 due it, on the ground that McKenzie
had acted illegally in not obeying the or
der of the Board of Trustees. McKenzie
and his bondsman won In the lower
court, and the Treasurer'* course was
finally Justified In the decision of the Su-
Dreme Court yesterday.

Commandant John Krige of the Boer
army lectured at Metropolitan Temple
last night on the cause, conduct and
probable outcome. of the war in South
Africa. The lecture was under the aus
pices of the Netherland Society of Wil
helmina, and isas interspersed with some
Illustrated pictures of- Boer people and
scenes that were well received by the
audience. Â¦ â¢
Krige described several famous actions
in which he was engaged, how he was
taken prisoner by the British army and
how he escaped after thirty days' incar
ceration. Speaking of General Dewet, he
said that all shirkers have j left his
forces because he is a strict disciplina
rian. Dewet's enforcement of army rules
caused the fake report to be spread that
he is cruel and that his losses h/ive driven
him insane.
"Dewet and Botha are the only two men
who can make peace," said Krige, "and
neither will do so without the other's
sanction. We have 12,000 men in the field,
though the British have been so kind as
to grant us 16.000. General Botha has at
no time been able to figure up more than
30,000 men. With two such generals as
Dewet and Botha in commanu l venture
to predict that England will never con

a large addition has been made to this list,

feel that they must sell, and the supply
will be so limited that it is expected tha
price will advance to 50 cents.
It is reported by the Bakersfield Cali

shut down their wells until the price of oil
advances to a figure somewhere in rea

which arises from sand in various parts of the
oil fields is to be overcome by the use of com
pressed air. .The Eastern "Star Company re
cently installed a compressed air plant and has
by its aid been able to clean its pipe of the
sand at the rate of 40 feet a day, which is
very gratifying. Heretofore by the use of a
bailer, the company has been unable to lower
the sand more than fifteen, feet a day. It la
thought the compressor will greatly facilitate
drilling:.' and it has already been conclusively
proven that pumping is hastened by its usage.
' While they are trying tp get together,
there are all sorts of stories afloat, calcu
lated to persuade the producers that some
one will do for them what they evidently
must do for themselves to have their
business paying what it ought to pay. In
terviews which are pronounced fakes by
the parties who were reported to have
talked for publication Is one method. Pipe
lines and gigantic refineries have been
built in imagination. There are several
stories afloat in the Kern River district,
some of which find : their way , into the
papers. It is constantly more and more
apparent that the producers must help
themselves by their own efforts.
The Stockton papers report that a dis
tributing plant for oil is being established
In the western part of Stockton. Large
tanks "will be sunk in a depression west
of Weber avenue. The oil will be taken to
Stockton from the Kern County fields and
Coalinga by rail. It will be pumped from
the tanks as needed.

It now looks as though the trouble and delay
Stories With"' Stings.
There are several influences represent
ing large investments of capital mat are
concerned in keeping the oil men divided if
possible. The btanuard Oil Coifcpany has
already indicated its purpose by calling
for bias for large quantities of oil in the
Kern Kive'r district. -Then it was plain
that the price of oil could not be main
tained when the consumers. were bidding
against one another. There are many
on men who believe this move was in
tended as a "feeler." The Standard Oil
Company refused to report .what any bids
were. No one doubts that the Standard
Oil intends to handle the' product as far
as possible. .,..â¢.. .,
Â¦ Tne railroad companies are also largely
concerned in the price of oil. Changing
from coal to oil for fuel in their locomo
tives and being . compelled to buy fuel,
they naturally seek to get It for the low
est possible price. Disorganization among
the oil producers is the surest one to get
low prices. The higher the transporta
tion rates, the.le5g.net profit for the oil
men. Acting on the old-time principle
to blame some one else and so ra'se a
question to divert the public from the
real issue, the Southern Pacific Company,
antwtring the complaint before' the Rail
road Commissioners concerning the
freight rates on oil from Kern County to
San Francisco, charges the failure of the
oil producers to make the expected profits
on oil to their methods of selling. The
fact ie that there would still be a margin
for the oil producers at the present price
in San Francisco if the freight ,iates
were not enormously higher than for the
same service Â¦ in Texas, where the South
ern Pacific is moving oil. The railroad
company, having no risks, get's mors net
protlt per barrel* for the oil merely for
moving it down hill to San Francisco than
do the producers of the Kern County
fields. If ever there was necessity for the
Kern County producers to stand together,
this is the time. Â¦ -
Opposition to Unity.
Several newspapers have assumed that
because there is a tendency to suspend
â¢operations to some extent the oil industry
of Kern County may languish.- The fact
is that some well owners nave determined
to wuit for better prices for oil. But the
cil is in the ground and the demand is in
cit-using. Ultimately the price must rise
! it the producers show the desire and abil
ity to act together for their own good.
There are more than five hundred com
pleted oil wells in the Kern, County fleld3.
One-fourth of that' number are also under
drill. Such are the figures supplied by
the Bakersfleld Calit'ornian. In sections
4 and 5, in township 28 south, range 28
cast, there are 145 completed wells and 47
drilling.. In section 29, 2S-28, there are 48
completed wells, and 13 .are drilling.

son.is the patentee. If the, slow and primitive
process of â¢ dry washing now in. vogue can be

cÂ»yi<HAXKS to a heavy subsidy, the
I French merchant marine is grow-
I ing with startling rapidity. A
I" few years ago its flag was rarely
/ ir.et on the Pacific; now French
built chips are In every port, and one of
their, can even afford to come here in bal
last from Ireland to take a load of wheat
back to the Emerald Isle. The Bourbaki
Is now thirty-six days from Limerick,
and or. her arrival at Portland, Or., will
at once load wheat for Queenstown. The
subsidy raid by 1 France to its sailing
vesseis almost 'paj-s all the expenses, and
whatever Is received for freight is clear
profit. It Is no wonder, therefore, that
French ships can accept a charter that
an American or British owner would not
look at.
A few years ago the French flag was
rarely seen in the bay of San Fran
cisco, and then it was generally at the
mast of a man-of-war. At the present
time there aro three French barks in
port, the Jane Guillon, Brenn and Beau
manolr. There are eight vessels coming
here from Cardiff and every one of them
liies the flag; ten coming here from
Swansea, and five of them are French.
Other vessels built and owned in France
and now on their way here from various"
ports are as iollows: From Hamburg,
one; Newcastle, England, two; Newcas
tle, N. S. W., two; Antwerp, two; Hiogo,
Japan, one; Hongkong, one, and Liver
pool, one. There are thus twenty-four
French vessels on their way to the coast,
and as they get a fixed amount for every
knot sailed the question of a dividend at
the end of the year is placed beyond a
doubt.
Several San Francisco merchants are
profiting by the opportunity, anda dozen
vessels now nearing completion at St. Na
zalre are nearly all owned here. The man
aging owner will, of course, be in France,
but the large profits will in many in
stances come to the Pacific Coast. All of
the vesseis are run on a very economical
plan, and not one of them has failed to
pay enormous profits on the investment.
The three barks now in port are nearly
loaded and ready for sea.
WEAVER'S BOAT IN HARD LUCK.
Obliged to Put Into a Hawaiian Port
for Provisions.
X. J. Weaver of yacht Nonna fame Is
not having plain sailing in his latest ven
ture. Six months ago he was in San
Francisco and told glowing stories of the
concessions that had been granted him in
Samoa. He chartered the schooner Julia
E. Whalen and on January 1 started her
.for Apia. Captain Erratt got the vessel
down there all right, but Weaver did
not get the cordial reception from the
Germans that he expected. The cargo of
the schooner was discharged, however,
and with a quantity of copra and cocoa
nuts she started back for San Francisco.
Light winds and calms proved too much
for Captain Erratt. and when sixty days
out from Apia he was compelled to put
into HauaJel, H. I., short of provisions.
This was on May 25, and the next day
the Julia E. Whalen made another start
for San Francisco. She is now twenty
one days out and should g:et in any time
now.
The Whalen made a poor start from
here and Is now making a poor finish.
Soon after passing out through the Gold
en Gate she was caught in a gale, and
five days later had to put back for re
pairs.
British Ship Toxteth Arrives.
After the long passage of ninety-one
days the British ship Toxteth made port
yesterday from Newcastle, X. S. W. Oth
er vessels have arrived from the same
port during this month in fifty-eight and
sixty days, but the Toxteth got all the
light winds and could not make time. She
Bailed from Australia on March 16, and
For British Columbia â 7 cs arms and amu

The steamer Walla Walla sailed yesterday
for Victoria with a general cargo manifested
up to 1 p. m. as follows: For British Colum
bia, J17.SS8; for Brisbane, Australia, $66; for
Boston, $15,548. The cargo Included the fol
lowing:
The bark Himalaya cleared Friday for Port
Adelaide with 779,187 ft lumber, 1000 doors, 400
bxs and 200 pkgs metal polish. The cargo was
valued at $26, ISO. ,

The Rosamond will load merchandise for
Honolulu; the M. P. Grac^, lumber (at Had

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Matters of Interest to Mariners and
The battleship Oregon will be open to
the public again to-day. A big crowd
visited the warship yesterday, and it was
after 6 p. m. before the last of them got
ashore. A lot of outsiders were selling
tickets for the various launches yester
day, and the members of the Transfer
Men's Union did not like it. They com
plained to the owners of the boats and
the outsiders were withdrawn. Peterson's
fleet will run from the Folsom-street float
and Crowley's from the foot of Mission
street to-day.
Now that the Humboldt, the "Alaska
flier," is on her way to Nome, Max Ka
lish, the popular agent of the vessel, is
back in San Francisco. Mr. Kalish will
remain here a few weeks and will* then
go to the Sound to meet the steamship
on her return.
There was a Â¦ trivial cutting scrape on
the steamship Colombia yesterday that
gave rise to a great deal of talk on the
front. Two of the helpers in the kitchen
were peeling potatoes. Instead of keep-
Ing on with their work they began sky
larking when the cook's back was turned.
During a scuttle one of the men cut the
other In tho leg with his knife. This
story was magnified until it was made
out to be a case of attempted murder,
and the wagon was sent from the harbor
police station and the ambulance from the
Harbor Hospital, f It only took a few
minutes to straighten out the matter.
Water Front Notes.
The mammoth nun buoy, painted red
and numbered 2, has twice broken away
from the Fort Point ledge; and each time
It has brought up near Mile Rock. On
Wednesday last the current that rushes
past the fort took pbssession of the buoy,
and yesterday 't was anchorerl by its own

ADVERTISEMENTS.Automobile for Chief Sullivan.
The Fire j Department has at last .been
enabled to secure ari automobile for Chief
Sullivan which will prove . strong enough
to stand the strain which will be imposed
upon It by the hills of San ' Francisco.
A few evenings ago Sam Sue Su at
tempted to commit suicide, by hanging
herself, but she was discovered before she
could accomplish her purpose.. At the re
quest of Mr. Woodworm, \ Dr. Morrison
made a physical examination of the pris
oner and found that she was far advanced
In consumption. â¢ Under such a combina
tion of distressing circumstances Mr:
V/.ocdworth decided to commit a legal er
ror on the side of humanity, and had the
v^man released, to be cared for by her
friends. . Â¦ ' -
. Mrs. Sam is a widow,; 5S years old. She
came [ to . San Francisco [ forty years ago
with her husband," a cook, arid .never left
here. During a- portion of the period dur
ing. which registration was going on under
the terrii3 of the Geary act, she was .con
fined to. her room by sickness, and partly
because of that fact and partly becauseof
her ignorance she failed to get registered.
Ihn old woman appeared last week as .a
witness in the deportation case of Jeung
Lin Heung,. a female slave, and admitted
onithe witness stand that she had not
btcr registered. She was arrested in the
courtroom 'and since that time has been
helri a prisoner In the County Jail, awalt
inp her examination, the only result of
-which would be her deportation; sick and
superannuated as she is, to China, to
starve among strangers.
An act of humanity was performed yes
terday by United States District Attorney.
Wcodworth ,. when 'he/ appeared before
United 1 States Court Commissioner Hea
cock and , secured the dismissal of the
cltaTge /against- Sam Sue Su, an old
woman, 'who had -been. arrested for being
illegally In this country.

Marvin Ford, the shoe salesman who
.knocked Lee Leong senseless and stole
a bag -of money from him -and who was
in " consequence convicted of. "highway
robbery, was sentenced by Judge Lawlor
yesterday. The court adjudged that Ford,
should serve ten years In the State prison
at San Quentin.
' j "When the' case was called the defend
ant's attorney. Colonel Barry, made &
motion for a new trial* on the ground ot
alleged improper Instructions of ths
Judge to the jury on the question of In
sanity, or Â¦ transitory mania. He argued,
at .length on the. motion, but the Judge*
denied it and refused arrest of judgment.
Â¦ In passing sentence the Judge, after re
viewing the history of the charge, said In
part: â¢ â¢ â¢
Let there be no delusion as to the question oÂ£
the defendant's merttat responsibility. This
court Is flnnly of the belief that he found him
self at the close of the races on the afternoon
of February 15 desperately in need I of money
with which to enable him to continue in his
demoralizing course. Ha was practically pen
niless, 'and for the purpose of providing: him
self with funds and with a showing of law
lessness almost inconceivable he planned tha
crime which has brought him to the bar of
justice. That is the plain truth about this
case.

For: those who may have the time and
means to make visits to outside points
excursions have been arranged to various
parts of the State. -A six-day trip to Yo
semite at moderate prices is expected to
attract many. : : - . : - .
Other excursions will be given to Pacific
Grove, Del Monte, Monterey, Santa Cruz,
San 1 Jose, Mount Hamilton, ' Palo Alto,
Mount .Tamalpais, the Geysers, Big .Trees
and Napa and Sonoma valleys. A special
rate to Alaskan points has also been se
cured, and excursions to Southern Cali
fornia will- be arranged later. . â¢ . <
Many of ' the visitors also may be In
clined "to locate in California, and an in
formation bureau will be established
which will give them an accurate idea of
the benefits to be derived from coloniza
tion. Competent, guides will be furnished;
who will â¢ conduct the delegates to all
points of Interest. *
Daily trips will be made to the park,
the . military reservation - and the water
front. -All visiting Easterners take great
interest in Chinatown, and , excursions
through that section of the city will be
made a particularly prominent â¢ feature of
the entertainment. The attention of min
isters and missionaries will be directed
to .the missions for foreigners, which are
conducted 'in this city by the Methodist
denomination.
-The entertainment and recreation to be
afforded the thousands of .visitors; who
will attend the 'international convention
is a matter of much concern to the Ep
worth League officials who have the pre
liminary arrangements in charge. It is
felt that although the convention Itself
will be of paramount interest to the dele
gates many of those I who , coma have
never been in this section of the country
before, and will therefore be desirous of
seeing something of the beauty and re
sources of the State. Accordingly special
attention will be paid to this feature of
the convention. .

rear and passed, through a vacant store
at 121 Gcapy street to liberty. The tools
with which he : had been working were ly
ing beside the safe and belonged to the
Blcre. A hole had been bored in. the "dial
ot the safe and powder inserted and ig
nited, but it did not have force enough to
blow the door open. A "jimmy" had then
been inserted to force the door, but had
failed. The force of the explosion
knocked the Inside of the safe into pieces
and loosened the shelving near the safe.
â¢ Blake went to the safe and discovered
that it had been- tampered with. He im
mediately^notified the police, and three
officers were quickly on the scene, but
they could , find; .no trace Â¦: of the safe
crackers, as it 'was suspected there had
been' more" than one. â¢ ,
A daring attempt .was made to blow
open the safe ln.Kohler & Chase's store.
26-28 O'Farrell street, early; yesterday
morning. When-Robert Blake, the book
keeper, entered the - place at 7 -o'clock he
was astonished 'to see a- strange man
there, and. when he asked the man what
he wanted he was more-astonished when
the stranger ran" upstairs and disappeared.

"I have taken no medicine, . but my
Â¦teady diet of Grape-Nuts Food has given
zaÂ» Btrecstb, health and memory."-
"I have lately had a seven-months*
course of vocal Instruction and have
memorized 58 songs and most of the ac-
companiments besides Â«' several piano
pieces. When I started in it seemed
difficult to memorize one, but my memory
has been growing better every day and I
now find it easy to commit to memory
Â¦without difficulty. , i'-'i'v*^ 'Â¦'/<:
Mrs. G. H. Baber, 528 South . Paulina
street, writes, "I had a terrible siege of
gastritis; my stomach refused everything
In the way of food until I got hold of
Grape-Nuts. It was perfectly wonderful
and marvelous to see the difference. I be-
gan to improve at once. I weighed myself
about that time and found that I had 118
pounds to my credit. I gained in weight,
strength and health steadily and rapidly,
and now weigh 160 pounds and am strong
and in better health than ever in my life.
Grape-Nuts Food was made especially
to rebuild the brain and nerve centers.
An experience In Chicago .will illustrate.
Now we know that daily use of the
brain uses up certain parts that are
thrown out through the pores to the outer
surface of the skin. This waste is natural
and must be made up from food.
It Is hard to believe that certain kinds
of food will strengthen the memory, and
yet. upon the condition of the brain de-
_ pends the character of the mind, and its
power to remember, and to exert itself
in various ways and a healthy brain can
only be maintained by well selected food.

After waiting for a year to. elapse since
the estrangement between herself and
husband, Mrs, Margaret Olcese-Borlihi
has taken the necessary steps, to' secure
an absolute divorce from him, the grounds
to be desertion. The wife has conferred
with. her attorney, and as soon as the pa
pers can be prepared they, will be filed in
the Alameda County Superior Court. " . '
"We have been separated more than a
year now," said Mrs. Olcese-Borlini at her
home in Oakland yesterday, "and as that
is the statutory time .required for people
to be' separated before divorce proceedings
can be begun, I have decided to begin
suit. As for Mr. Borlini, I don't know
where he is and have riot heard anything
of him for a good many months." '.
Mrs. OIcese-Borlinl is the daughter of
Mrs. Margaret Olcese of 1030 ' Sixteenth
street, Oakland. As Miss Olcese she was
a leader in Oakland society. When she
married- Alfred â¢ Borlini a year ago tho
wedding was deemed ' one : of the most
notable of a series -of society weddings
and was celebrated with great . pomp. -Â¦ .
But hardly had the sound of the wed
ding bells died away before it got abroad
that* young Borlini was a defaulter and
that his bride, having discovered the fact
first, had separated from. her husband and
gone back to the home of her mother.
The matter became public when Borlini
was charged with peculations, of money
by his employer, the London and San
Francisco Bank, with which Institution he
had been for many years. " He had con
fessed his crime tto his bride" Â¦while they
were on their wedding tour, hoping that
her "well-to-do relatives would come to his
assistance;f.but when she. found -she had
been deceived she left Â« him. â¢Â¦Borlini was
then compelled to' confess his shortage to
his employers. Through . the : influence of
friends he escaped prosecution. It was
openly charged at the time of the , mar
riage that Borlini had deliberately wedded
the young woman in 'the : belief that hia
shortage would be made good after he had
become her-husband.- Â¦ . i,-, _â¢.-*;

the fact that their "business ends were to
the point." A California -street car - was
the first to pass through the swarm. An
eioerly lady and her son were seated on
the forward dummy. /The lady suddenly
uttered a thout and her son got off the
car to see who struck his mother with a
cobble. Then they went home.
Several men with whiskers began to
suggest waj's and means to "settle" the
bees for capture, but after the majority
had been harpooned they also went home.
The bees finally reached the conclusion
thet there was "more doing" in other
quarters and they departed as quickly as
they came. .
BAY COAST LIKE REFUSED
PERMIT TO BEGOT WOEE
Board of Works Says Ebad Will Cut
Into Main Sewer .
Outlet
The Board of Works notified the Super
visors yesterday that it will not grant a
permit to the Bay and Coast Railway
Company to grade certain streets, as its
plans will cut the main outlet of the
Xorth Point sewer. It will also be neces
sary to fix official grades along and ad
jacent to the proposed line. The action
of the Board of Works Is significant, as
the company Is required by the ordinance
to do ?25,000 worth of work before June 25
or forfeit its franchise, unless an exten
sion of time Is granted. The communica
tion says:
The company modified Its application by ex
pressing a wish to grade on Delaware and
Ocean avenues in accordance with the grade
fixed by the profile by it. This profile shows
the proposed railway as passing under Mis
sion street af Springdtle street. This cuts the
Xorth Point main, the main drainage ; of the
city, and cannot be allowed. Between this
point and Illinois street the proposed grades
are so low. that if the road be constructed
upon them the drainage from important dis
tricts will be seriously Interfered with. â¢ The
board win therefore not bo In a position to
Issue the . permit until such grades be estab
lished by law. . . \

MACTTTTJISTS . FILE PROTEST.
./ DETROIT, June 15.â The: Detroit branch
of the 'International Association- of Ma-"
chinists to-day forwarded to President
Angell ;of the University of. Michigan a
protest against the* plan cf, certain De
troit employers ; of. hiring: undergraduates
of the university to fill the places of the
striking machinists. â¢> The -protest says:
"We, as taxpayers of the 'State of Michi
gan, protest most strenuously against the'
funds of the State being, used" to educate
the sons of well-to-do families to take
our places, when we are making an effort
to place labor In a position -to have and
use more of the leisure which the modern
industrial system, if properly adjusted,
provides that it should enjoy.
"We most- earnestly request you to use
your best efforts to dissuade the students
from pursuing a course which would re
flect discredit on the good name of the
University of Michigan."
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 15.â Two
strikes, Â¦ each affecting directly
over. 4000 men. one formally de
clared' and the other seriously
Â¦ threatened, are features of the
troubles of labor in Western Canada. The
track "and bridge constructing gangs on
the Canadian Pacific Railway have al
ready " gone on," strike and are quitting
work to-night all the way across the con
tinent. The threatened strike is that of
the Fraser River fishermen, who are at
a deadlock with the canners on the ques
tion of price. â¢ \
Now that the strike of the trackmen has
become an accomplished fact, the feature
of the affair is whether the engineers and
conductors .will join in the fight. The en
gineers' organizations have not passed
upon the question of whether the track
men can ; rightfully be organized as skilled
labor, but even if no decision is come to
on this point the engineers may refuse to
haul trains over roads which are unpro
tected by inspection of section gangs.
This is probably the way in which the
trainmen's brotherhoods would act and al
low the trackmen and the company to
fig'at out the question of recognition be
tween themselves.
The question is now, how long will the
strike last? Canadian Pacific officials
claim they are not in the least concerned.
They say they have all the section bosses
working and these foremen will take
charge of gangs of Italians who will make
up the 'section gangs, along with the men
who will necessarily become dissatlslied
with the strike. But the men themselves
declare that ''they have plenty of money
in the headquarters treasury and can car
ry on -the strike for an unlimited time.
In British Columbia about six hundred
men quit work to-night. There are over
200 bridge, builders in this number. The
trackmen will have the support of simi
lar organizations in the United States, as
the union is an international one, all
branches being affliiated. But the Cana
dian Railway heads of depart
ments - seem to rest easily in the belief
that the majority of the men will return
to work upon the advanced rate of wages
being offered by the company during the
negotiations, after they have satisfied
their consciences by turning out at the de
mand of the order.
Affairs are in a strained condition be
tween the fishermen and canners: After
a scries of half a dozen joint meetings this
week, the canners agreed to offer ten
cents per fish during the rush of the sal
mon season as the highest price they
could possibly afford. To-day "the central
union of the fishermen, representing near
ly 4000 white men, met and unanimously
decided to refese the offer, holding out for
twelve and a half â¢ cents. The canners
will not pay a cent higher and the fisher
men say it is folly for them to work at a
lower figure. The Japanese are as yet un
certain, and. will probably-%Bi out In the
event of a strike to fish for whatever they
can get., Â¦ f\ Â¦ ...â¢â¢., , . Â¦â¢

, Conditions in Other Lines of Trade Are Slowly Changing
ALTHOUGH National Organizer
Jefferson D. Pierce of the Amer
ican Federation of. Labor
spent several hours yesterday in
consultation v/Ith the executive
committee of Journeymen Butchers' Union
No. 115, all attempts to restrain the de
sire of the workingmen to accejpt the de
mands promulgated by them nearly three,
weeks ago and accepted by their employ
ers were futile. At the close of the day's
business it was announced that only two
shops carried the union card, around the
display of which the whole controversy
resolved.
No exciting situation marked the close
of the journeymen butchers' meeting.
They met at the Turk-street Temple and
there discussed the situation. The an
nouncement that four shops had been
closed because of opposition to the will
of the wholesale dealers who had been
supplying them and that the same fate
would be meted out to others had the ef
fect of causing the hauling down of union
cards except in two instances. Both of
the men who held out are located in la
boring districts and have been making
displays of placards.
The change in conditions was effected
very quietly. The wagons of the whole
salers went around between 4 o'clock Fri
day afternoon and 10 o'clock yesterday
mcrning. Â¦ - * Â«
"Got a union card?" the driver, who
was generally accompanied by a trusted
representative of the supplying firm,
would ask. â¢
If the reply was "yes" the driver would
say: ' â¢- - â¢Â¦
"Give me the card or I'll have to drive
on." .
The cards were handed in promptly,
and now 286 of the 2S8 butcher shops of the
city do not display the union card. Al
though the matter was practically settled
by the prompt action of the wholesalers,
pickets were out during the busy hours
of the evening, because the men directing
the strike had other matters to consider.
Although the working butchers' head
quarters was deserted last night and the
executive committee had a long session In
a private residence, an acknowledgment'
of defeat was not generally admitted. A
meeting will be held again this afternoon
at the Turk-street Temple, at which it is
expected formal announcement of the
close of the strike will be made and the
men advised to apply for work at once.
"Only two butcher shops now display
the union card," said Isaac Frohman, at
torney*for the executive committee of the
Wholesale Butchers' Association. "We
expect a surplus of workmen to report for
duty on Monday. All who are capable
may find places, as there is no animosity
between the men and Jhe employers. We
thought they were ill-advised in their ac-.
tions, and while all other demands had
been agreed upon there came a sudden
stumbling block. This has, happily, been
removed, and now all- is harmony. Mr.
Rodolph, secretary of our Â¦ association,
who has been at Butchertown each day,
says that the slaughter-houses are run-,
ning full handed and that meat supplies
will be delivered at the usual hours. It
is safe to say that the strike has reached
its climax." :. â¢â¢* .^V; â¢.-
A number of the striking .butchers went
out to Butchertown yesterday morning
and were met by Henry Moffatt, the only
wholesaler who happened to be there. The
men were received pleasantly and the
limited courtesies of Butchertown â¢ were
extended to them. A most Jovial disposi
tion was manifested,; which may have had
much to do with the settlement of differ-
It was reported th'at'a-'humber;;of;cattie
dealers, attracted by the strained situa
tion, were in the city. Some . talk has
been indulged In about the organization
of a stock company to erect a union

once proceed on this plan. None- of the
leading retail butchers approached would
admit that ' they were about to become
Interested in such an enterprise, j

was doing, arid- I told him. â¢ He ' said he
wanted' to rent an office, and I suggested
that he take office room with us. I noti
fied Mrs. Pettee and she Instructed me to
let Doneghy have desk room for $10 per
month. I did so and Doneghy installed
himself the next day. ; I saw all the
women" come in there every day with
the money, from 'the sale of tick
ets, and' I quickly' realized that it was
all a case of grafting. I realized that
from the number cf tickets sold and the
donations the women * brought in every
day.. They also came in with orders for
liour,' clothing, etc. j The goods were al
ways turned over to Hutchinson, who
inns a boys' home in the Mission.
"Doneghy told- me that I was not,sup
posed to know what was going on, as he
feared that an expose in the newspapers
would "do him up. I first met Mamlock a
week ago. He' came' to the office and
Doneghy introduced me to him. I listened
to their conversation and knew that Mam-
M. B. Weinberg made the '/following
statement last nicht: â¢ \
."I wish to state that I was never con
nected with my brother in business near,
the Presidio, and I was never warned off
the reservation. My brother was the'one
warned off. I have known Doneghy if or
about ten years. I first met himiln Buf
falo, N.-Y., where ,1 was born. I met him
many Hjmes -after that. I was traveling
and I frequently^ ran across him.. He : was
engaged I n. getting up "concerts and enteri
tairiments. f I did not know, what ; he was
giving them for.; I met him here last Der
cember. He came down ' from Â¦ Portland
and ,was . accompanied by; Helen Barnes,
Josie , Haines. Miss | Deitweiler, | Miss Flem
ing and .William Greehleaf.- They gave an
the nursery would have to do with the af
fair was to take the money. The terms
submitted by Mamlock 'to the ladies was
50 per cent of .the"" gross receipts. The re
sult of the meeting was that although the
ladies approved of Mamlock's offer they
decided to leave the matter to the discre
tion of their president, who was instruct
ed-to look into, the credentials offered by
Mamlock. : Â¦ Â¦ ." Â¦ /â¢ â¢â¢
Mamlock in giving his references to the
board of managers of the Nursery for
Homeless Children mentioned the firm of
Murphy. Grant â¢& Co. as vouchers for hia
gcod character^ Mr. Grant was seen in
regard to Mamlock, and declared that the
nan 'was not known to. him by name, al
though it was possible that he might have"
had some business negotiations with him.
Mr. .Salisbury of Pasadena, the presi
dent of the Boys' and Girls' Society, was
called up on the phone and the" president
of the nursery put a few questions to him.
Mr. Salisbury declared that he was per
fectly satisfied with the way Mamlock
had managed the benefit for the south
ern charitr, 'but when questioned as to
the amount realized said that his accounts
were not In such shape as to allow him to
state with accuracy the, sum netted.
Salisbury's statement, in the face of the
fact that Mamlcck had declared that $5000
had been realized, inclined the lady wha
presides over the destinies of the charity
to declare the | benefit matter off, and
Mamlock was consequently notified that
his offer would not be : entertained, - - * : .
Previous to Mamlock's* attempt at ben
efit negotiations with the San Francisco
Nursery for -Homeless Children Mrs.
Gregory had called upon the president of
the- institution and offered to get her up
a'- charity concert, promising ' to take'
charge of the sale of the tickets and the
procuring of amateur talent. , Mrs., Greg
ory's offer was refused. .
WEINBERG MAKES A
PLAIN STATEMENT
Acting Secretary Murray of the Young
Men's Christian Association was also in
terviewed yesterday, and in reply to ques
tions said: ...... .. .
"About three weeks ago a man called
on me and wanted to rent- our hall'for a
night, claiming to be the secretary of "the
California Boys' and Girls', Aid : Society.
He said it was for a charity and that we
ought to let him have the hall cheap. I
told him what we would rent the hall for
and asked him to pay a deposit. He de
clined to do so and went away. I did not
cee him again. This week a number of
persons called here with tickets for /a con
cert to be given on July 1 for the Cali
fornia Boys' and Girls' Aid Society. They
desired to exchange the tickets for re-
Eerved" seats. I also received 'a number
of letters from prominent persons stating
they had bought tickets and desiring to
have seats reserved. In each case I could
but say we knew nothing about the con
cert."
The description given by Mr. Bayley
and Mr. Murray of the. man who called
to see them tallies with that of Mam
lock. He is described as a man of slight
build, with fair hair and blonde mustache.
Matron Anita Pugh of the Lying-in
Hospital and Foundling Asylum, at 923
Golden Gate avenue, yesterday denounced
as fraudulent any attempt to sell tickets
or solicit donations for that institution.
"About the end of April," said Miss
Pugh, "a woman called upon > me and
gave her name as Barnes. She told me
that she wanted to give a benefit concert
for our institution, and would supply all
the talent if we would rent a theater. I
spoke to our doctors, and. they met the
woman when she called again. They
were not'impressed by her and refused to
listen to her proposition. We had an Idea
that she had some motive in calling on
us other than that of helping our institu
tion. .The woman told us that she had
yery successful in Los Angeles. St.
Louis* and other cities, and informed us
that she traveled with a party of artists.
We have not consented to any concert
being given for our home, and no one has
a right to sell any tickets for us."
On April 16 Mcs. Gregory, alias Miss
Graham, sent a number of letters from
the Grand Hotel to charitable and benevr
olent organizations in this city/ All 'the
letters were signed "Miss C. C. Graham,"
and in each the writer proposed to give
a "benefit" concert for the society .ad
dressed. Among those who received-let
ters were the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, . the
Mount Zion Hospital Association. Pacific
Homeopathic Polyclinic and the Little
Sisters' Infant Shelter.
MAMLOCK MAKES
GENEROUS PROMISES
The board of managers cf the San Fran
ci&co Nursery for Homeless Children was
fur more than a week considering an offer
KEde by Mamlock to get them up a "ben
efit" In aid of their building- fund, and for
which he assured them that they, would
realize $5000. 'Â¦ '^S'^

dent of the Institution. armed with many
letters -and a strong â¢ credential from a
Mr. Salisbury, president of a . boys'^. and
girls' aid society of Pasadena. ~ Mamlock

have to come to me. I read of the action

in exposing. him." _â¢
HENRY MILLER'S NAME
IS USED FOR BAIT
The charity "workers" made a strong
effort, to have the. San Francisco Fruit and
Flower Mission . permit them to give a
benefit in aid of their charity. One of the
charity "benefit" managers called upon
the lady- who last year . presided over the
destinies of the mission and laid his plans
before her. \He was laden with- letters of
recommendation and. promised big things
If allowed^ to get up an entertainment for
FURTHER Investigation Into the
methods and ramifications of the
professional "charity" workers
who are at present infesting this
city ehow an extraordinary state
cf affairs. Not only are the benevolent
people of San Francisco being system
atically duped in the name of
charity by the gang headed by
Hiss Helen Barnes and William H. Don-
alias Donnely, aiias Doneh'y. but
there are several other gangs of workers
operating along similar lines under the
cloak of well known charitable organiza
tions whom they have deceived by plausi
ble representations into engaging their
services. .
Mrs. K. C. Gregory, alias Miss C. C.
Graham, who was exposed In The Call
t-everal days ago, is one of those who have
found the "profession" a lucrative one,
and another of the Ilk is a man named
Mamlock, known on this coast as an ad
vestising agent. Mamlock is known to be
selling tickets for unknown societies and
has a number of women in his employ.
He Is evidently an imitator of Doneghy's
methods. Mrs. Gregory gained her train
ing while working- for Doneghy. These
Â«re but a few of tlie many schemers who
are making an easy and luxurious living
by preying upon the generous credulity of
San Francisco citizens, unwittingly aided
by many worthy organizations who have
cllowed the use of their names. But not
only have tickets been sold for "benefit"
concerts for bona-fide societies, but tick
ets for organizations unknown in San
Francisco have been disposed of by Mam
lock and a crowd of pretty women.
The expose by The Call has set the ma
chinery of the Police Department to wcrk
and detectives were engaged yesterday in
eecuring evidence. Mamlock was taken
Into custody late test night by Detective
Kamill. In the past few months
many of the leading charitable organiza
tions have been approached by members
of the band of schemers, in each case an
offer being made to give a "benefit." con
cert.
Testerfiay it was discovered that tickets
â¢were being gold around the city for con
certs in aid of the "California Boys* and
Girls' Aid Society" aad the Lying-in Hos
pital and Foundling Asylum. There Is no
society known here as the "California
Boys' and Girls* Aid Society" and the of
ficers of the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society
at Grove and Baker streets denounce as
fisudulent any sales of tickets in its
name. The officials of the Lying-in Hos
pitai and Foundling Asylum, situated at
Â£23 Golden Gate avenue, have never au
thorized the sale of tickets for any
ccEcert for the benefit of their institution,
aiid desire to warn all persons who may
be approached that those offering tickets
for the society are common swindlers.
DONEGHY, ALARMED,
CALLS IN CANVASSERS
Doneghy. alias Donnely, alias Donehy,
and his chief associate, Helen Barnes,
yesterday tcok alarm at the expose of
their methods by The Call and kept under
cover. All the girls and women associated
Â¦with thejn were ordered to refrain from
celling tickets or soliciting donations, and
their ill gotten gains were shut off for the
dsy.
E-oneghy. "who Is passing in this city as
IV. llliana Donnely. arrived here last De
<'-mber from Portland, Oregon. He was
preceded by Helen Barnes, who is always
sent ahead to pave the way. For many
>Â«-ars Doneghy and his- wife worked the
SBtne kind of scheme in the East.
Mrs. Doneghy is now in the East organ
izing "benefit" concerts for all they ar<Â»
worth. She has the reputation of having
paved her money, while with Doneghy It
Is a case of easy come, easy go. '*
"When Doneghy and Helen Barnes estab
lished themselves in San Francisco they
were accompanied by women known by
the names of Fleming, Deitweiler, Chase
and Haines. Another member of the
party was William D. Greenleaf, who,
however, broke away from Doneghy.
A number cf concerts were given In this
city and then Doneghy and his assistants
went to Los Angeles, taking along a few
recruits from San Francisco. In Los An
geles the charitable people were worked
right and left and a large sum of money
was cleaned v.rt. Two of the women. Miss
Chase and Miss Haines, left Doneghy
there and are now supposed to be In Lon
don, working: the "charity" scheme in the
treat metropolis.
Donpghy boasts that his "work" is per
teCQj legal and claims that he secured
the opinion of a Supreme Court Justice
in the East to that effect. His further
boast is that he paid $1000 for the legal
opinion.
During the past week many tickets have
been soM for a concert to be given for the
"California Boys' and Girls' Aid Society"
on July 1, In the auditorium of the Young
Men's Chrlstfan Association.
Assistant Superintendent Bayley of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society is unaware
cf the existence of the "California" So
ciety.
"I know nothing: of a society called the
California Boys' and Girls' Aid Society,"
said, liaj-ley, "and this thing is a, fraud.

MERCHANTS MAY TAKE
UP WORK OF CHARITY
. At the last monthly meeting of the Mer
chants', Association a. paper : entitled "A
Plan for the Administration of Charity"
was submitted and read by Andrew M.
Davis, a director of the association. Jlr.
Davis' plan, as outlined In his paper,
-would prevent all such bunko 'work "in
the cause of charity" as has been prac
ticed In this city by Eastern grafters dur
ing the last few weeks. and now exposed
by The Call. Mr. Davis said:
The Merchants' Association , has heretofore
confined Its efforts chiefly to the solution of
tho political and economic municipal problems
of. San Franci3co. It was the distinctly un
satisfactory conditions in these departments
that called this association Into being-. Its
record- of good accomplished Is too great to
be retraced here. Its power and moral.influ
ence have come to b'e recoxnized to "such an"
extent that its Indorsement of any measure
secures for , It resoectful and serious consid
eration. ; ' .
There is a department of our civic- life, how
ever.to which the Merchants' â¢ Association has
"given no attention and ' I fear but little
thought." This social Interest I refer to, "tha
department of philanthropy." Is for the most
part in the hands of kind and .well-intentioned
persons, but appears to be ai an arch re
quiring a keystone. ; and that-stone. It seems
to me, this association can supply better > than
any other civic organization. . . .
"The poor we have always wlth.us,'* and "we
recognize the obligation of sparing a certain
amount from the store of our material bless
ings for the benefit of those who are less
fortunate than ourselves. There Is a natural
and Just tax put upon the rich for .the rellej
of the poor and suffering, but the knotty prob
lem, is how to impose, collect and * distribute
. this tax. * ,

sf^ ERNEST EDWARDS and M. B.J
// Welnberg, whose names were
(k^. published as being associates
v^^ O of Doneshy and his charity
workers, consented last even
ing to tell all they know about the manner
in which they had become acquainted with
the head of the gang.
Edwards, in telling of how he and his
sister had been connected with Doneghy,
said: . . â¢
"I am innocent in this matter and so ia
my sister. About six months ago my sis
ter answered an advertisement in the pa
pers'and met Doneghy. He offered her $3
per day to work for him and sell tickets
for benefit concerts. She sold tickets for
a concert for the San Francisco Boys'
Home, given on December 20 at the Cali
fornia ' Theater. She also solicited sub
scriptions. Benefits were also . given for
; the Girls' Aid Society at the Central The
ater and for Sister Julia at Golden .Gate
Hall. My sister went to Los Angeles
with Doneghy and his party. ' He paid her
fare and gave her $3 a day while there.
She came home three weeks ago and was
idle a week,, and. then, went to. work for
Doneghy again. She told me. that a con
cert was to be given at Golden Gate Hall
for. the boys' home run byHutchinson. I.
asked her if there was a chance for me to
make some money and she told me to
come up and see Doneghy. I went up to
his office and met him and he asked me to
arrange for the concert and he would pay
me $33 for It. I wa3 to supply all the tal
ent. I did not know that there was any
thing wrong in the work of Doneghy "and
his people.
"I arranged a concert myself for the Al
hambra for July S for the Home Finding
Society. Doneghy has nothing to do- â¢with
that. I knew that Doneghy brought some
of the women to this city with him.
"I recognize the ticket calling for a ben
efit at the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation on July 1 for the California Boys*
and ,Gir!s^ Aid Society. Last Wednesday
Mamlock told me that the girls he had
out were selline those tickets. - 1 have
seen Mamlock show those tickets to Don
eghy. Doneghy told Mamlock that he was
a fool to sell bogus tickets and that he
Tjrould get into trouble.
"Mamlock read the expose of Mrs. Greg.
ory in The Call and said to Doneghy that
his game .was spoiled, and then he tore
up a lot of the tickets. I have no, desire
to hold anything back. I and my sister
were brought into this affair Innocently.
"We are known to many people here and
I don't war:t t to be looked upon as one' of
these 'grafters.* I shall certainly not al
low my sister to have anything more to
do with them. I think that I ought to
give the 'concert on. June 27, as I have e'a
gaged all the talent for It." J

sellers traveling; with him. He spok<;
about the big success they had met with
and wanted to be allowed to give a con
cert for our organization. I sized him up
as a faker and refused to have anything
to do with him or his scheme. I' do not
kiiow the society for which tickets are
now being sold. Our name is the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society, and no doubt peo
ple have bought the tickets thinking the
concert was for our institution. We have
not consented to any concert and know
nothing about it whatever."

lie could do as much for the nursery, and

Though a few pools were sold, there waa
no one who voiced the opinion that Cot

In a wrong key, for Cotton Ball stopped
scoring after getting three points to his
credit.
Cosey , on the short end at 1 to 6 against

BUFFALO. X. T., June 15.â The track
and field sports given under the auspices
of the A. A. U. ended to-day with the
senior championships, and when the last
lap had been run and the last weight
tossed not a single amateur record had
been broken in competition. In an exhi
bition throw Harry L. Gill of Toronto
tossed the discus 120 feet 11% inches, which
is 2 feet 2^4. inches better than the record,
â¢which has stood for three years, but the
amateur records do not recognize per
formances outside of competition. .
The prettiest performance of the day
â¢was the sprinting of Sears of Cornell,
â¢who ran 100 yards with a N. Y. A. C. em
blem on his breast in 9 4-5 seconds, which
Is the record. Sears also took the 220-yard
dash in brilliant style and went the dis
tance In within three-flfths of a second of
the record.
Gill of Toronto was protested in every
event in which he competed for alleged
professionalism, and the result in the dis
cus throw, which he won; the running
high Jump, where he was second, and the
12-pound shot put, where he was second,
â¢will remain- in doubt until his case is
passed upon.

JOCKEY HEK"RY VICTORIOUS.
NEW YORK, June 15.â Before a
crowd of 20,000 persons, on a
most disagreeable day, Alcedo
came home a winner in the Su
burban tc-day in but two-fifths of
a second more than when Salvator made
the record, eleven years ago. The crowd
cheered wildly, for there was a hot tip on
him and he won easily. Toddy managed
to hold second place till a few jumps from
the wire, when Watercure passed him and
left him third. The favorite, Ethelbert,
badly beaten, was away back in the ruck.
Suburban day was little . better than
that on which the Brooklyn Handicap
was run, in the rain, but it was fully as
disagreeable, for a cold northwest wind
swept across the track, making everybody
uncomfortable and chilling the enthusi
asm of the spectators. When the time
came for the horses to go to the post in
the Suburban the grand stand was a solid
mass of dark colors, very different from
the scene of a year ago, when the specta
tors were in bright summer garb. -
Ethelbert was at all times a consistent
favorite, although a lot of money went in
on Alcedo, on the strength of some phe
nomenal work two days ago, and he was
backed from 20 to 1 to 4 to 1. The odds at
post time were: Ethelbert, 13 to 10; Al
cedo, 4 to 1; Star -Bright, 4 to 1; Kamara,'
& to 1: Toddy, 30 to 1; Sidney Lucas, 25 to
1; Watercure, 10 to 1; Blues. 8 to 1; All
Gold, 30 to 1; Beau Gallant, 30, to 1; Pro
cession, 40 to 1.
Delay at the Post.
The horses cantered slowly up to the
post between lanes of people that extend
ed along the stretch on both sides of the
track. The spectators stood ten deep
along the rail. -
The horses were in the hands of the
starter at 4:10 o'clock. Mr. Fitzgerald
never had a worse lot before him. They
absolutely refused to go up to the barrier
and time and again it was shot up in the
hope that they might wheel and get away
in decent order, in the sixth break they
were off to a good start, with Watercure
in front, Alcedo second and Ethelbert,
Star Bright and the rest close up. I On the
way to the grand stand they settled into
thfir stride and as they came to the lower
turn Alcedo got to the front, with All
Gold second and Ethelbert third. Around
the turn and to the half-mile pole on the
backstretch there was little shifting of
Eositions, Alcedo still holding the lead
y a neck over Blues, which had come up
from behind in the mixup,' All Gold fall
ing back to fourth place. , . â¢
There was a pretty race between the.
leaders up the backstretch and everybody
shouted as a streak of blue and white
shot by them all on the outside, for Toddy
had elected to make his run then and
at the three-Quarter pole he had a neck
the better of Alcedo, which was a length
and a half. in front of Blues. The latter
was just clear of Ethelbert, which seemed
to be in difficulties and slowly slipping
back in the race. That was not all Toddy
could do, for in almost the twinkling of an
eye he was in the lead by a half length,
then an open length in front as they
swung around the broa4 upper turn.
Alcedo to the Front.
Spencer, on Alcedo, knew Toddy's limit,
however, and bided his time. The. seven
furlong pole was in sight and he called
on Alcedo, which responded bravely. One
instant he gathered himself and then in
a series of herculean bounds he passed
the Keene four-year-old almost as if he
were standing still. It was a tremendous
burst of speed and timed so that as they
rounded into the last quarter Alcedo was
a length to the good over Toddy, which
was two lengths in front of the rest of the
field, all of which were dropping back
beaten, with the exception of Watercure,
on vhich Shaw was making a desperate
effort. Ethelbert, the pride, of Perry Bel
mont's heart, -was beaten,- away back in
the ruck and was losing ground with
every stride.
At last they were straightened out for
home, and it was plain to everybody
that, barring accident, the prize was a
sure one for Alcedo. Spencer took a
steadying pull on the leader but kept him
well' in Â¦ his stride, so that any possible
challenger would find him ready to meet
the issue.
In the meantime little Smith, riding
hard with hands and heels, was doing his
best 'to hold Toddy In second place. He
almost succeeded, but Shaw; had the bet
ter horse, and Watercure J took . second
place a few Jumps from the wire. ' Alcedo
was running along comfortably in front,
and when the wire was reached and he
had carried off the great -race of thelyear
the crowd shouted as loudly as if Ethel
bert had been the winner.
"Jimmy" McCormack's'Luck.
The race had a'few spectacular features
but it seemed always as if Alcedo had the
most speed, and the time, -2:(5 2-5, might
have been less had there been a horse to
crowd the winner.' Jt was an easy victory
for J. H. McCormick, who had told his
friends that he would surely win. Sum

GOLFERS PLAY A TIE GAME.
Fifteen, thousand people journeyed 'to
the track to see the Derby run,' and they
gave Mr. Schorr's colt and jockey an ova
tion; Racing conditions could -not have
been more perfect than they were to-day.
Silverdale was made - favorite at 6 to 5,
but owing to t the fact that the turf critics
and professional handlcappers had stated
that the colt showed a' disinclination to go
the Derby route in his workouts no de
cided plunge was made on him. San*
nazarro and Gaheris were the next best
liked and they received a strong play.
Duelist made the running to the mile,
where he chucked it up. Sannazarro then
assumed command and showed the way
into the stretch by a commanding - lead.
When they were straightened out for
home Woods went to the bat on Silver
dale, and, responding gamely, the colt
passed the rapidly tiring Sannazarro at
the 'last furlong pole and beat him'out by
a half length. Wall .was third, two lengths
off, with the balance of the. field strung
out. . â¢ . . : . '*.'":
Silverdale was badly. bumped on all the
turns and was twice pocketed In the last
three-quarters, but when Â¦Â¦> he finally
squeezed through he : came like a lion un
der the -whip and was going away, at the
finish. Summary: -Â¦ ... - , â¢

ST. LOUIS, June 15.â Silverdale, the
mighty son of Favordale and Golden Roq
II, picked up 127 pounds and carried the
colors of John W. Schorr, the Memphis
millionaire breeder, to victory in the St.
Louis Derby this afternoon, covering the
mile and a half in 2:35.

Silverdale Wins at St. . Louis and
John.E. Madden thought so well of Star
Bright's chances that he bet $11,500 on Mr.
Whitney's candidate. Â¦ A" $2000 commission
on Star Bright was also sent into the ring
by a clubhouse contingent..
While Alcedo runs in the name of'"Jim
my" McCormick, it is understood that his
real owner is Louis V. Bell.
Clarence Mackay, not wishing to. allow
his' new purchase - Kamara to run un
backed, bet $250 against J3000 on the filly.
Had Kamara won it was" Mackay' s inten
tion to make a present of the $3000 to his
stable - employes. . Mackay always puts
down a bet for the boys/ashe calls them,
when he starts a horse, in a big event.
He never beta for pereonal gain. - -
Watercure was well thought of by sev
eral shrewd players. "Eddie" Burke liked
Littfield's horse so well -that he wagered
$2000 against $16,000 on the son of Water
cress. "Leo" Mayer bet $1000 against 58000
the same way. Another plunger, whose
betting name is Charles Bonnell, ' placed
$1000 straight and place on Watercure and
quit ?2000 winner tt> the race.
Johnson and Gideon were ' all smiles
after the race. It is said that, their win
nings footed up close to . J50.000. Frank
Farrefl was another fortunate one; bet
ting $2000 against $16,000 on the winner.'
Farrell also prevented his friend. Senator
Timothy D. Sullivan,- from losing money
and made him win $1250. I
NEW YORK; June 15.â The speculation
In the betting ring was extremely, brisk
from the time the odds were posted until
the starter sent the field away in the Su
burban handicap. " Ethelbert* always had
the call with the public. . Quite a,number
of heavy bettors also placed large com
missions on Perry Belmont's horse," nota
bly among the number being "Sol" Lich
tenstein, who bet $5(XX);' Jesse Lewissohn,
who wagered $2503, and "Jakey" Josephs,
who wagered $2WW against $i'l\X).
Secona only to the. play on the favorite
was the support given Alcedo by small
and large bettors. Conspicuous among
the good judges of thorougnbreds who bet
thousands of dollars on . "Jimmy" Mc-
Cormick's horse were David Johnson and
David Gideon. As soon as the books post
ed the prices Johnston bet "Eddie" Burke
$1000 against $10,000. He made a similar
wayer with "Leo" Mayer.

the first class and a Â¦â¢ large number in the

head against the iron bedstead In her cell.
Mr. Ringstorf said that for some . time
hia wife has appeared' to be out of sorts,
but. she cunningly concealed her design
of murder and suicide and . no suspicions
were entertained by the family as- to her
sanity. ~ - . <
The unfortunate woman was partially
quieted and induced to go back to bed.
Her husband took up his watch at her
side to wait for the morning.. As soon as
the patient thought herself safe from de
tection she took a steel hatpin from where
she had secreted- it in the bed and' was
trying. to thrust It into her heart when her
husband detected her purpose and took
the pin from/her. . -
This morning Ringstorf sent to the
Sheriff's office and called in help to have
her removed to the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Ringstorf ; was examined by Drs.
Knox.and Buteau and recommended for
commitment- to an asylum.

In his estimates of the expense of run
ning his department. Chief Hodgklns for
the coming fiscal year so figured the co^t
that it wili not be more than $2000 above
the ordinary expenses of the department,
though the ten extra policemen's salaries
will be $10,000 for the year.
"The annexed districts are entitled to
bet*er police protection than they have
been getting," said Commissioner , John
son, "and we intend to give it to them as
soÂ»n as the City Council authorizes us to
make additions. We think that ten men
will be enough for. the present. ) Chief
Hodgklns made the - statement in the
estimate of expenses of his department
for the next fiscal year that that number
of officers and two more detectives would
be needed. We. have already provided fire
protection to the annexed by
equipping two fire engines ' and manning
them with nineteen men, and now when
the people get the additional . police they
will have all they have demanded of us."
Examinations for the eligible list will be
helcnext Tuesday morning in the City
Council chamber. There are about fifty
ai plicants for places. They must be be
tv.-cen 25 and 35 years of age, at least five
feet seven inches high and not less than
150 pounds In weight. The time for filing
applications, expires Monday.
The following 1 named are some of . the

Ten more men will be added to the Oak

cil will act favorably upon the recom
mendation of the board that they are
necessary for the proper protection of the

the Council will authorize the increase, as

The church has the further distinction
of being the first stone structure to be"
erected by the Catholic people in this
archdiocese. It Is built entirely of Marin
County blue stone, in . rough blocks as
they came from the quarries, with buff
colored sandstone trimmings. It has cost
about $20,000. t ' -
The roof is covered with Vermont red
slate. A graceful campanile marks the
corner -of the church and a flight of stone
steps twenty feet in width, rising from
the street to a covered vestibule, forms
the very effective approach to the edifice.
Gables pierced by large rose windows
form the transept wings and sanctuary
space and serve as ornamentation to- the
front of the church. Â£
THE dedication of. the new Church
of the Assumption at Tomales
this morning will give Rev. Father
John Rogers' parish in that town
* the most beautiful house of wor
ship in California, although other Catho
lic churches may be more imposing and
more expensive. The little Tomales
church boasts no cathedraMike grandeur,
but for artistic completeness and richness
in detail it is superior to any other edifice
in the State.
The church will be dedicated this morn
ing by Archbishop Riordan, the elaborate
services beginning about 11 o'clock. Rev.
James McDonald, j pastor of St. Charles-
Borromeo parish, will preach the sermon.
Many Catholics of San Francisco will wit
ness the dedication. " . .
Four stained glass windows, made in
Munich, are masterpieces. Each presents
a perfect story in picture. They have no
superiors in any church in California. Â¦
The entire wall surface of the interior,
is faced with stone in the style known
as broken ashler.^. The Â¦â¢â¢ black- cement
pointings form a pleasing contrast against
the soft buff of the stone. Wood is en
tirely eliminated from the/ interior finish.
The sanctuary has a vaulted roof of the.
same buff stone that lines the interior
Â¦walls, ar^d its three altars are of marble."
The high altar Is approached by steps
and platform of marble. It Is valued at
$1500. The side altars were made in Car
rara, Italy, of the exquisite marble which
has made those quarries famous. They
are beautiful pieces of marble decorative
work. The altar rail is of California onyx
and Italian marble.
Bronze and i Â¦ silver-plated sanctuary
gates are set .In the center of. the altar
railing, while the silver sanctuary lamp,
tabernacle door and altar candelabra give
rich setting to the sanctuary. ".*
OAKL,A>TD. June 15.â The Reliance Ath
letic Club programme for the monthly
gentlemen's night, which Is scheduled for
Friday, June 21, consists of three glove
Â¦contests between men who have won
' much local fame in the ring.
The principal event Â¦will be a 15-round
bout between Tom Herman and George
Baker at 125 pounds. A few months ago
these men met before the Reliance Club
In a similar contest. In which Baker was
â¢declared the winner. Ever since that
event Herman has been seeking a return
match, believing that with his increased
ability in the boxing line he would be able
to defeat his shifty opponent. Baker has
nt last agreed to a return match and it
"has aroused considerable Interest.
The second event will be a ten-round go
between Jack Capeless of the Reliance
Club and George Curran of the San Fran
. Cisco Athletic Club. Both are well known
locally as aggressive boxers, who always
put up a good contest. They will meet at
122 pounds.
The opening event will be a ten-round
bout between Louie Long of the Reliance
and George Murphy of the Bay City Club.

Card.
D. S. TVeaver, who holds a judgment
claim against the city for $2s:G, together
v-ith 510S costs of suit, filed with the Audi
tor 5'esterday through counsel a protest
against paying interest on the teachers'
back claims and not on others. The judg
ment, with interest at 5 per cent per an
num, with costs accrued, now amounts lo
53Â«16. The protest, which will cause ad
citlonal complications in the disposition
oz the surplus fund, follows:
That interest on t-uch Judgments is a. matter
Â¦ of right and as much a part of ihe debt as
the principal has been determined by oar
Superior Court in many cases.
You will further take notice that any dis
crimination In allowing interest on
claims In favor of some individuals and dis
ellowln^ interest in favor or others payable
out of any surplus fund under the late con
stitutional amendment No. IS is unjust, ille
gal and denying persons within the juiisdlc
tloa of the State equal protection of the laws.
Concerning the payment of interest,
Auditor Weils is of the opinion that the
Supervisors have acted illegally in dis
criminating: by making provision to pay
interest to teachers and not to the mer
chant creditors. Complications will un
doubtedly axise and the only way that
trouble may be averted is for the board
to rescind that portion of. the budget ap
propriating SiH.OOO to pay interest on
teachers' claims, or else make provision
to pay interest on all back claims, the
Auditor says.
The finance committee of the Board of
Supervisors held a conference with the
Mayor and Auditor and it was decided
that the Park Commission and Board of
Education will be called upon to contri
bute their quota of any balances remain
ing in their respective funds to pay the
judgment claims held against the city.
The two boards named have benefited to
a. material extent by the increased assess
ment roll, which resulted in a surplus
â¢ fund of more than half a. million dollars.
Under the charter the balances remaining
Â¦with funds of the two boards at the end
of the fiscal year are not transferred to
the surplus fund, but are carried over In
The park and school funds to be expended
next year. The School Department will
have a surplus of about $25,000 and the
park fund a balance of several thousand

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
' . 111S Broadway, June \o.
The butoliers' strike in Oakland, was en
livened i<-day by the reported defection
from the union of John Crosby, the or
ganization's vice president and one of the
leaders la the meat cutters', fight for rec
ognition of their trade organization.
Crosby's failure to walk out with other
union employes at Robert Vincent's mar
ket this noon, when Vincent took down
the union card, was the cause of the ex- |
citement among the union strikers. But -
it subsided when Crosby, an hour or so
later, joined his fellow unionists in their I
walkout. *' . â¢ !
The trouble at Vincent's shop was due |
to the demand of the wholesalers' com- I
mittee that Vincent should surrender -his !
union card, which he hung up yesterday.
Vincent. In common with every other re
tail butcher in Oakland, Alameda and -
Berkeley, was notified that the union card
must come down, otherwise no meat
would be sold to them for thirty days.
Vincent had started as a union snop
yesterday and had secured a supply of
meat through the efforts of the union
skirmishers. But when the demand was
made, fearing that he would be unable to
Ket enough beef outside, Vincent with- .
drew the card and the union workmen, !
who had returned to their meat blocks, I
immediately withdrew.
Crosby Seeks Arbitration.
- Crosby lingered behind long enough to
explain that he had desired the union to
adopt a plan of arbitration involving the
acceptance of the Western Meat Com-!
pany's offer to accede to all of the de
mands of the union except that of dis
playing the union card.
Crosby also proposed that the union put
back men in all shops that would patron
ize the Western Meat Company solely, so
that a fight could thus be kept up for
awhile against the stockyards slaugh
terers. Then, if that failed, the reverse
order was to be tried. But these Dlans,
as well as that of arbitration with the
Western Meat Company, were not deemed
.feasible at this stage of the fight.
The wholesalers' action in notifying re
tailers that their supply of meat will be
cut eff if the union card is held forces
upon the union men the duty of finding
beef for the shops that still display the
union card. The journeymen say they
can do this, and the wholesalers are as
positive that there is not enough available
beef to be had independently of their
sources.
Reply to Frohman's Statement.
Tliis stand of the wholesalers has led to
the calling of a meeting by the retailers j
of San Francisco and Oakland, which will !
be held to-morrow in San Francisco. Their .
action will be awaited "with interest, as
upon it hinges in large measure an im- I
portant phase of the strike. |
The press committee of the Alameda
County Federated Trades has given out a
statement in reply to 'Attorney Isaac
Frohman, representing the wholesalers, j
The statement charges the wholesalers
with having precipitated the strike. It
concludes:
The wholesalers do not want their establish
ments unionized and have attempted by. des
potic methods to intimidate the retailers into
complaisance with their demands. They are
fighting organized labor over the backs of the
retail dealers and incidentally trying to throttle
the public through its stomach, meanwhile in
dustrially beating the "union card" tom-tom
in an effort to make it seem that the fight
rages solely around that issue.
In conclusion we appeal to the public to Judge
which is the more dangerous trust, one com
posed of the organized mechanics, artisans and
tellers of the land, from the sweat of whose
faces capitalists like Miller it Lux and all
other wholesalers accumulate their wealth, ex
ist and have their being, or a trust composed
o* a. few land barons and cattle kings, who by
reason of the special privileges they enjoy as
"owners" of vast cattle ranges are in a posi
tion to shut off the suply of meat or be the
absolute dictators of the price which the pub
lic shall pay therefor.
We have no hired attorneys to plead our
cause and need none. We believe the general
public can see as far through a millstone as
the active trade-unionists and appeal to it to
give preference to union shops now and in the
future, no matter what the outcome of the
present disagreement may be, and to remember
those retailers who have had the courage and
manhood to resist the imperious demands of the
cattle trust. Respectfully submitted,
P. B. PREBLE,
\ . J. M. LYONS,
Press Committee Alameda County Federated
Trades.
The Meat Cutters' Union claims that the
wholesale committee's action in carrying
oft the union cards that were surrendered
to them to-day is cause for Criminal
prosecution, the union declaring- that own
ership of the cards is vested in the or
ganization.
Irving C. Lewis, of Grayson, Owen &
Co., said to-night: "Out of twenty-seven
retail shops visited to-day by our com
mittee twenty-five withdrew the union
cards. The strike will be a thing of the
past in a few days." >

1118 Broadway, June 15.
The Alameda local train which left
Park-street station to-night at 10:05
o'clock jumped the. track on the Oakland
side of Harrison-street bridge fifteen min
utes later. The- accident was due. the
railroad men believe, to a misplaced or
defective switch that operates the tracks
on the north side of the bridge. The
train was thrown from the track that it
should have taken to run .down â¢ First
street to the pier, and was ; headed- up
the Webster-street broad gauge into Oak
land before the switch tower operator at
the foot. of -Alice street could handle the
derailing switch that threw the engine
â¢and baggage car off the tracks. â¢
The train* was composed of engine 1218,
in charge of Engineer W. M. Thompson
and Fireman William Gallatin, a smoker,
baggage car and' two passenger coaches.
Dan Murphy was conductor. Â«
Thompson said he got a signal to cross
the bridge and -saw nothing out of the
way until he struck the switch at the
Oakland side; then" his engine, instead
of running down on'the right-hand track
into First street, started for the Webster
street side and was derailed about 100 feet
from the First and Webster-street cross
ing. 'The engine and .baggage car were
thrown off the tracks before the train
was brought to a standstill. The run was
on a down grade, "the embankment form
ing- the bed for the tracks, it. being a.
gradually filled rise from First street to
the drawbridge.
'The cars were well filled with passen
gers, but none were hurt.~ The jolting
over the^ ties shook up . those in the
smoker.- - . .
The 'accident blocked the tracks for the
night, preventing the operation of trains
on the Webster-street line to Alameda
pier. Both the 10:45 and the 11:45 trains
from Fourteenth street to' the city were
'abandoned for the night. " The. passen
gers on the ditched local were sent on
their interrupted journey by a special
train that was backed up to First and
Webster streets.

cents per share for the same. He is Al
bert A. Snyder. canvassing manager for

and â¢ was found .-at his rooms, 32S Eddy
street. He was brought to police nead
quarters, and his explanation to Captain
Seymour was that he had known Charles'
Gordon as.C. 3. Stickney In Portland, and
that he had engaged Gordon in March
last as a canvasser, giving him this dis
trict, as- he was a smooth talker. Gordon
had told him that he was interested in a
mining deal, ani asked him as a favor to
S9 to Ames* office and "make the offer of
10' cents per share on" behalf of Denver
capitalists, as he was anxious to -get
Ames to close the deal. That was all he
knew about it. His employer called upon
Captain Seymour and gave - him a good
character. The captain is Inclined to be
lieve that Snyder is telling the truth, and
that his only fault was in allowing him
self to be duped by Gordon. He was ac
cordingly released from custody.

Gordon, who is known in criminal circles

one of the cleverest confidence operators
in the country. He was arrested in Den

and was arrested recently in Chicago for

nine beauty.
But don't use dyesâ that clumsily
hide, instead of removing, the gray and
the fading. SCIENCE hai found a
way to RESTORE the natural, trans-
parent, glossy coloring; science, aa
embodied in my
4-Day Hair Restorer.
GRAY HAIR is becoming only to
extreme old age. . On young heads-
less than 50â it is out of place, inhar-
monious, irritating.
It is not merely your privilegeâ It Is
your dutyâ to yourself, to those near
arid dear to you â in fact, to the world.

"WEAKNESS
There Is no -such condition as weakness In a
ftian under fifty years of aee, other than gen-
ial debility. Prematureness, loss of vitality,
â¢tc. are but symptoms of some damage to th*
.reproductive . system caused by a contracted
Jisorder or eariy dissipation. In looking for the
location of this damage we generally find an
jnlarged. swollen and inflamed prostate gland.
An this gland is the very center ! of the re-
productive system it can readliy be understood
that inflammation of it must, cause disordered
function. The cases are promptly benefited by
proper treatment, otherwise the patient goes
'rom bad to worse. The essential point In all
of them is the necessity of the cure of the focus
of the trouble, in the prostate. Many men .who
have unsuccessfully treated for a. , weakness
should now know the cause of failure. In our
experience there Is no drug In the- Phartna-
copea, taken Into the stomach, that will even
benefit this claca of cases. Our plan of treat-
ment is entirely a local one, and prompt result*
are obtained, as Indicated by increased circu-
lation and return of natural vigor. Our colored
chart, which we mall on application, is inter-
esting to any one wishing to study the anatomy
of the male.
Varicocele.
Varlcocele Is an enlargement of the most
vital blood vessels in man. In their normal
condition their function is to carry off waste
material, thus enabling the organs to recelva
fresh nutrition. Owing to the breaking down
of the valves, caused by the paralysis of the
muscular coat of the veins, they become dilated,
ar.d local stagnation of the blood follows. ThÂ«
vital nerves, being deprived of their proper
quality and. quantity of nourishment, weakness
is the result. . Statistics prove that 25 per cent
or the male population are afflicted with varl-
cocele in some stags of the disease. We guar-
antee to cure i varlcocele in one week at . our
office, or four weeks of home treatment, with-
out the uae of knife, caustic or ligature. WÂ«
have cured over 2000 cases without b. single
failure or unpleasant result. We Invite cor-
respondence and the fullest investigation of our
method, and can refer to cured â¢ patients If
desired.

Chicago opened lower on unfavorable cables,
favorable weather and some liquidation, but
the strength in coarse grains helped wheat, and
the market turned higher, . being helped by the
bad reports from France, which were accom
panied by buying orders from the Continent.
The French new3 was the principal factor of
the day. Advices to Bolton, de Ruyter & Co.
said that in spite of lower Â«ables wheat has
j averaged firm up to the present, and that the
weather is all that could be desired, except that

NEW YORK. June 15.â The Commercial'Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day had a' subdued
cheerfulness that quite disregarded New
York's early fears that its bank statement to
day would make an unfavorable showing and
that gold exports might be expected in' the
near future. There was good buying of Amer
icans, therefore, particularly Union Pacific
which was favorably affected by the talk of
consolidation plans.
Money to-day ruled steady.
CLOSING.
"Trade In the United States is abnormally
active and likely to be more active during the
coming year than hitherto, and the demand for
money In America Is llksly to greatly expand.
Consequently it will have to be met by a
greater stock of gold. But the world's produc
tion is more than sufficient to provide the cur
rency needs of America and the usual demands
of the arts. Jhe surplus must, apparently, flow
into the banks of England, France and Ger
many. There is every reason to believe that
the autumn demand will be met without diffi
culty. Thereafter the accumulation in the chief
centers will result In easier money than for
years. We may regard the period of money
stringency as practically past."
Discussing the hupre production of gold in re
cent years, attended by the abnormal demand
of several countries, compared with the entirely
changed conditions in Russia, India and Japan,
which are now releasing gold, the Statist re
marks:
"The really important factor governing ' the
value of money in London this autumn will be
the condition of trade and the demand for
money in the United States. They are gathering
an enormous wheat crop, exports during- the
coming year will be very great and the trade
balance in their favor will be colossal. Our
holdings of American securities are greatly re
duced and in the event of a continuance of
trade expansion In America, which appears cer
tain, we may be required to pay In gold for a
portion of our cotton and wheat. Hence tht
American demand for gold will probably neces
sitate protective measures by the Bank of Eng
land in the autumn."
The Statist says
Money in Berlin Is abundant and there Is a
prospect of the reduction of the German bank
rate in July. The lowness of Berlin exchange
is attributed to the recent heavy selling of
American securities for German account and
must be taken in connection with the high New
York exchange. Much American money Is be
ing Fent to London to pay for securities pur
chased in Germany. Owing to the poorness of
the German crops the trade oalance will be ex
ceptionally unfavorable and consequently there
is greater prospect of exports of gold from Ber
lin than of imports.
The marked advance in French exchange early
In the week was partly due to the transfer of
a moderate amount of Russian money to Lon
don. When this was completed a reaction oc
curred, excluding: an exceptions demand on
account of Russia. The desire of French capi
talists to employ money In London Is expected
to be sufficiently keen to keep French exchange
well above the gold point. The supply of money
in France is enormous.
LONDON. June 15. â Money was plentiful to
day and discounts were weak. The tone of the
Stock Exchange was cheerful, but there was
hardly enough business to test prices. Opera
tors were hopeful that with the continuance of
the ease of money activity will soon be In
creased. Gilt-edged securities hardened. Amer
icans were quiet and at parity. The inactivity
tended to irregularity and there were some de
clines noticeable. The close was steady., The
contributors to the causes of the plethora of
money are Government disbursements, the re
turn of country cash usual alter Whitsuntide
and fhe accumulation preparatory to the loan
installment of June 18. The Increased demand
in connection therewith will probably stiffen
rates nml be followed by u further temporary
hardening In the succeeding week with the
Stock 'Exchange settlement and the half-year
end Immediately thereafter. However, heavy
Government disbursement*, combined with the
release of funds July 4. will again rewult in ex
treme ease. Therefor*, in view of the bank's
strength and Â»he tendency in New York ami
Purls U> send to I^ondon, the maintenance of
the bank rate nt SVa per cent was unnecessary.
Though the reduction was a great surprise no
movement is antlc'.rntert until June 29. The
action taken la Indorsed by many who are
closely ncijURlnted with the prevailing condi
tions of the great money markets of the world.
The banks of Holland and Belgium correspond
ingly reduced tholr rates to 3 per cent.
London Financial [hLulat.
The Financier says: Large syndicate opera
tions are reflected In the New .York bank state
ment of June 15. The excess reserve was again
heavily decreased and stands at $S, 782,125. as
compared with 5"1,2SC,OCO on May Zo, a loss of
over $12,000,000 In three weeks. In this period
the loans of the banks have risen no less than
$42.OOO,CCO and deposits $44,000,000. while the
amount of cash on hand is about $1.700,0(*) less
than on the former date. It appears, there
fore, that the banks are not losing much par
ticulerly, but that the increased liabilities are
tying up a large amount of otherwise Idle
money in the form of reserve deposits. This
is worthy of mention only in the sense that
the large operations noted are of a more or less
temporary character and their consummation
may set free quite an amount of available
lund.4 in the near future. The July dividend
period is largely being arranged for and may
exert an influence in the market soon. The
particular features which are shown in the
current statement are. traceable to the Penn
sylvania steel purchase and kindred ponding
deals and the loss of $1,500,000 in casb Is due
to movements of money in the direction of
Philadelphia; which were heavy during the
bank week, and to operations with the eub
trÂ«iSUry ut New Ycrk. As a matter of I'act
the majority of the banks did not participate
as factors in the charges noted, the bulk of
the increases- in loans and depcsit3 having been
repotted by two large institutions which were
concerned in these special operations. While,
however, the declining reserve is thus easily
explained it cannot be denied that the effect
will be shown in some firmness of rates, as was
indicated at the close of the week. This does
not mean a long continuance of harder condi
tions, but with the surplus reserve reduced
over half in two weeks it is not surprising
that a firmer tendency is shown. Loans are
still about $1S.OOO.COO under the maximum fig
ures reached March 9 last and deposits are
$2K.000,000 less, but the excess reserve at the
present time is $2,OCO,-000 less than at the
period of record-breaking deposit and loan
totals, so that a continued expansion seems
impossible unless money moves to this center
in heavier volume. Eut, as pointed out. this
is no reason to expect a continuance of heavy
increases in any of the items. A small amount
of gold was taken for export during- the week.
This does not figure in the current statement.
It is expected that as the 1st of July draws
near these shipments will Increase tn fre
quency in order to make July settlements.
Rates are higher at Berlin than elsewhere
and the exports, if any. will probably be to
that center.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. June 15.â Though the session in
the wheat pit was quiet, there -was a surpris
ing change in the tone of the market.
With Liverpool prices down and a continua
tion of excellent weather, the day began with
a modest array of sellers and July wheat opened
MpMc to U@%c below yesterday's close at
G9T&C to 70c and, under the pressure of the sell
ing movement, the price declined %c. All of
ferings were taken by one or two commission
houses, and this started a rumor that the
buying was for export. Consequently the
market turned, advancing to 70 1 ,gc. Profit tak
ing took %c off this price, but the expecta
tion of more buying orders caused a continua
tion of the upward movement to the high
price of the day, 70%i?J-70%c. .Under profit tak
ing there was a slight reaction, .and the olose
wa.s firm, Vt<3%c higher at 70Hc.
Improved cables and the smallness of stocks
on hand more than matched the bearish weath
er conditions, and the corn market, from a
firm b^ginnlnc, developed surprising strength.
July corn closed strong and l^c up at 43%c.
Several commission houses took considerable
quantity.
As usual on Saturday, the market for evap

An Improvement In the Prune market is
noted, due principally to the change in the
French crop. A month ago it promised to be
heavy, but the fruit has dropped so seriously
that now only a light yield is expected. This
has caused Drices in France to advance and
led to an European inquiry for California
Prunes. Forty or fifty cars have changed
hands on this market durlrrg the past few
days, and the tendency in prices is upward.

There was a decline In speculative activity
and some liquidation during the early part of
this week, caused by the showing made by last
Saturday's bank statement. But interest re
vived again as the week progressed, although
the volume of dealings did not rl*e to last
week's level. Many important general condi
tions developed which offered ground for ex
pected improvement. Eut the speculation?
seemed to be based for the most part oil special
considerations and was largely consisted In
special stocks. The substantial gains in the
list kept the undertone of the market pretty
firm and seemed to support prices against con
siderable realizing, which was in evidence from
time to time. ThÂ« Gould group of stocks were
conspicuous features during the week. Belief
was confident early in the week that early an
nouncement would be made of steps accom
plished toward the expected consolidation which
Wall street has designated the greater Missouri
Pacific. The announcement that the Missouri
Pacific directors would consider other than
routine matters at a meeting next Monday and
the news that holdings of $12,000,000 of Missouri
Pacific convertibles paying 6 per cent had had
the option exercised of exchange into stock fos
tered the belief in coming developments. Some
â¢warning intimations were heard later against a
too confident assumption of early action toward
consolidation, and confidence was somewhat
modified and directed toward dividend actions
in Missouri Pacific itself
Some rumors that the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company has control of the Pennsylvania Steel
Company, to control its rail supply, are credit
ed in Wall street. These rumors attracted a
large number of buyers of Pennsylvania stock.
Fome very large dealings In the Pacifies
and Northwestern railroads were attributed
to Insiders and were supposed to be due
to the working out of the comprehen
sive plan of adjustment of claims, assur
ing permanent harmony, which was explicitly
promised in the official statement announcing
that an agreement had been reached In the
Northern Pacific dispute. As Northern Pacific
etock has practically disappeared from the mar
ket since the corner and dealings in Burlington
are nominal, while the floating supply of Chi
cago and Northwestern and Great Northern is
m:'all stocks of other companies have been
looked to as en index of proceedings. The
notable strength of Union Pacific and of St.
Paul has Jed to conclusions that an Inter
change of securities of some sort between the
two was contemplated. Rumors have been
plentiful In Wall street that the enlargement
or consolidation of some of the Independent
eteel companies would be made, preliminary to
NEW TORK. June 15.â There was a feverish
undertone in to-day's stock market, but the
buoyancy of St. Panl was a determining factor
In sustaining prices and In turning them up
ward after the dip occasioned by the weak
bank statement. Authoritative announcement
regarding the developments in St. Paul con
tinues la'-kir.s. but the belief holds In Wall
street that a controlling: interest in the etock
has been made available for the purpose of a
Northwestern railroad dispute which is being
worked out. It is a matter of notoriety that
when efforts were made to secure St. Paul pre
vious to the Burlington deal the figure de
manded for the stock by controlling interests
was 200- Intimations have been given that
minority stockholders will be given equal bene
fit in any terms of sale of the controlling in
terest. Assumptions from these premises were
the occasions of to-day's dealings in the stock,
ia which conspicuous leaders, however, bore a
large part. St. Paul crossed 1S1 In the law
dealings, compared with 174>4 last night. Colo
rado Fuel added 6 points to Its sensational ad
vance. The general market was Influenced
throughout by St. Paul.
The heavy loan increase disclosed by the
bank statement reflects continued demand for
syndicate purposes. The decrease of cash of a
million and a halt is part of the known move
ments of money, which indicated a small gain.
Part of the gold withdrawn from the sub
treasurv went to Holland to-day. It is be
lieved that more may eo next week to meet
Berlin's requirements for the semi-annual set
tlements on July 1.

THE Most Reverend Tikhcn,
Bishop of the Orthodox Greck-
Kussian Church of North Ameri
ca, arrived in San Francisco last
evening on the overland from the
East after an extended tour of the coun
try, visiting the churches under his juris
diction. He has been absent from this
city about two months, and during that
time has traveled many thousand miles..
On his arrival last evening he went direct
to his residence at 1715 Powell street.
In an interview Bishop Tikhon said that
on leaving here he first went to Galveston,
Tex., where the new Russian church,
built to replace the old edifice, which was
swept away in the disastrous flood of last
year, was dedicated. The services were
most Impressive and thousands turned out
The Sausallto Golf Club played its first
match outside of Marin County yester
day against a team of class B golfers of
the Oakland Golf Club. The Sausalito
captain, R. "\V. Mason, was unable to get
together a full team of six, and so both
teams were reduced to four. In the first
round A. H. Higgins of Oakland was 2 up
ag^nst Leonard Chenery of Sausalito,
Wonhtngtor. Ames of Sausalito and P. E
Bowles Jr. played a tie, L,. H. Noble of
Sausalito was 2 up against Frank Kales
of Oakland and R. W. Mason of Sausalito
tied .vith J. H. Ames of Oakland. The
medal play scores were as follows; Ijeon
ard. Chenery 51, A. H. Higgins 48, Worth
ingtor. Ames 48, P. E. Bowles Jr. 50, L H
Noble 46, Frank Kales 50, R. \V. Mason
55 and J. H. Ames 54. The first round re
sulted in a tie.
In the second round the visitors did not
do so well, Leonard Chenery losing 2
down to A. H. Higgins, Worthlngton
Ames losing 2 down to P. E. Bowles Jr
L. II. Noble tying with F. Kales and R
W. Mason losing 6 down to J. H. Ames
Oakland was 12 up in the two rounds, less
2 holes for Sausalito, and so won the I
match 10 up. The medal play scores ln |
the second round were as follows: Leon
ard Chenery 51, A. H. Higgins 47, W.
Ames 5S, P. E. Bowles Jr. 41 for seven
holes. L. H. Noble 4S for eight holes,
Frank Kales 57, R. W. Mason 66 and J.
H. Ames Â£2. The course is in good condi
tion, though somewhat hard, so that the
ball has a long roll. The details are
shown in the table:

to witness the ceremony of the consecra
tion of the new edifice. From Galveston
the Bishop went to New York, where he
laid the corner stone of a new church in
that city. This church will be a magnifi
cent and massive structure when com
pleted.
After leaving New York Bishop Tikhon
visited Minneapolis, where he presided as
the judge at the examination of the stu
dents at the Russian Theological College.
From Minneapolis Bishop visited
Pittsburg and opened the cbnvention of
the Union Orthodox Brotherhood.
Special services will be held at 10 o'clock
this morning at the Russian church, 1715
Powell, in honor of the safe return of the
Bishop. The services - will be conducted
in Russian. Slavonian and Greek. The
sermon will be preached in English, r

EXTENDED TOUR OF THE EAST AND SOUTH.
Again, a complete list should be kept of all
the accredited philanthropic Institutions of this
city and county and a careful investigation
made concerning the work they are- supposed
to cover. Full and complete books of account
should be kept and exhibits made, so that those
who contribute. to the fund will have the sat
isfaction of .knowing how their money is ex
pended and where to direct those who apply
The board should have the right to exact tljat
those who contribute to' the fund should bind
thtmsalves to subscribe only through this re
lief association to such . institutions as are
placed upon its. list; otherwise the very object
of this organization would be defeated.
While there is no intention to elaborate the
details of this plan a few suggestions might
be noted here. For example: The labors .of
the board which is to control, this San Fran
cisco merchants' relief fund could be lightened
and its effectiveness vastly increased Â¦ by en
gaging the services of a competent and well
paid secretary, who will co-operate with the
Associated Charities and keep the. board of
directors perfectly In touch with the workings
of the association. An emergency fund might
be reserved to be used in cases too urgent -to
await proper investigation and classification. -
The suggestion that I have to offer to meet
the difficulty is this: Let a fund, to be known
aa the San Francisco merchants' relief fund,
be created, this fund to be made ud of self
imposed contributions from not only the mer
chants of this city, but from every -and all
available sources, i Further, let the fund thus
created be distributed among- the various
philanthropic institutions of our city and
county, according to their merits and inter
ests; and, finally, let a competent board of
directors be selected to tak3 charge of the
work, men who will not alone direct the dis
tribution of the fund, but .who will devote the
time necessary properly : to carry on such a
work. A plan of administration will naturally
develop as the work progresses, and the fund
at the disposal ot the board should increase as
its efficiency and influence widen. Â¦
As a result of the present Improper distribu
tion of support Ineffective associations are
often oversupplied, while others more needy
and more capable are seriously hampered for
the means to realize their ends.
\
cording to their equipment, for the relief and
uplift of the submerged class. ' Philanthropic
institutions exist ln endless numbers and va
riety. There are probably more institutions
now In existence than are really necessary for
the work that is to be accomplished.

tiro community and its effectiveness under
good administration will be comprehensive and
far-reaching. It will fill a gap that is now
apparent to even the most casual observer.
It will be a help to all charitable and' relief
orders; a protection against fraud and impo
sition, and a preventive for the overlapping
and waste that come of Indiscriminate alms
giving.
It will be a source of information to the con
tributor, and a relief and benefit to the bene
ficiary. , . Â¦ .
