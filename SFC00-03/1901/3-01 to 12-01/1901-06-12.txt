NEW YORK, June 11.â
The Sun has this from Lin
coln', Nebr.: In this wsek's
Commoner Mr. Bryan brings
forward Justice Harlan as a
proper candidate for the re
organizationists in the Demo
cratic party. Under the cap
tion "Why Not HarlanP" he
. says:
"The Gold Democrats seem
anxious to find a Presidential
candidate who is not 'tainted
with the silver heresy,' and
insist that that was their
main objection to the tickets
nominated in 1896 and in
1900. Why do they not urge
the . nomination of Justice
HarlanP Of course Mr. Har
lan is not a Democrat, but
that objection ought not to
weigh with the Gold Demo
crats who voted for McKinley.
Mr. Harlan not only
placed himself on record 1
against' imperialism, but he
also wrote a dissenting opin
ion in the* income tax cass and
opposed the position taken
by the Supreme Court in the
sugar trust case. He has a
splendid., record on three
prominent questions, but this
is ' the .very reason why the
Gold Democrats would object
to him. They prefer a Demo
crat who indorses Republican
policies to a Republican .who
supports Democratic policies."

T T IS just what I expected the President would say. r Accord
" Â¦*Â¦ ing to my judgment it is too early to discuss the Presidential
candidate for the next term. I don't think the precedent estab
lished by Washington has much to do with the. matter, but there is
no doubt a strong sentiment among the people against such a propo~
sition.â Senator Marcus A. Hanna.
I knew McKinley wouldn't consider a third term for a mo
ment. .The President's statement zvas quite like McKinley. Gov
ernor Odell as. a Presidential possibility is too far away to discuss.
The opportunity will produce the- candidate. *The Republican party
will never be without a man when the moment to nominate him
comes. Governor Odell has made himself very strong with the
people.â Senator Thomas C. Platt.
President McKinley' s act is exactly what I should have ex
pected from the patriot that he is. Another policy would have sur
prised me, as it would the people of the whole country. â Senator
John L. McLaurin. . .
T REGRET thai the suggestion of a third term has been made.
I doubt whether I am called upon to give it notice. But there
are now questions of the greatest importance before the admin
istration and the country and their just consideration should not 'be
prejudiced in the public mind by even the suspicion of the thought of
a third term. In view, therefore, of- the reiteration of the sugges
tion of it, I will say now, once for all, expressing a long settled con
viction, that I nod only am not and will not be a candidate for a
third term, but would not accept a nomination for it if it were ten
dered me.
My only ambition is to serve through my second term, to the
acceptance of my countrymen, whose generous confidence I so deeply
appreciate, and then with them to do my duty in the ranks of private
citizenship. WILLIAM McKINLEY.

WASHINGTON, June lL-The Chinese
exclusion law will expire on May 5 next.
Labor organizations will demand of Con
gress a re-enactment of the law.
John W. Hayes, ' secretary of the
Knights of Labor, was the commissioner
appointed In 1892 to visit San Francisco
and report upon conditions there resepct
ing the Chinese." He spent thirty days in
that city and made the report upon which
the Knights of Labor based their fight..
"When the matter was first taken up In
the* House," said Mr. Hayes to-day, "Con
gressman HItt, who was opposed* to the
exclusion act, had a majority of the
House with him, but we filed hundreds of
thousands of petitionsâ they . covered two
or three desks when they were piled up
for exhibitionâ and so, when the vote was
taken, he had only twenty-eight members
voting with him. We are proceeding this
year with the same methods. We already
have sent out 100,000 copies of the appeal
of the San Francisco local assembly ask
ing for the re-enactment of. the exclusion
law upon the ground that if such action
is not taken the. tide of Chinese Immigra

THE : organization Â¦ under the new
army bill ' of artillery districts
will cause many changes in the
commands now held by < officers
of the artillery corps, particularly
in the Department of California, .
' The bill abolishes the regimental forma
tion of the artillery and provides for the
organization of an artillery corps consist
ing of 126 co'm'panies of coast artillery and
30 batteries of field artillery. The coast
artillery is to be stationed at fortifications
where heavy armament has been erected
for coast defense. The care of these im
mense guns requires, the attention of ex
perienced ;. men. -In order ; to enable j the
men to acquire an Intimate knowledge of
the workings of large guns it has been
determined by the War Department to as
sign the artillery permanently.;, to these
posts. The artillery thus becomes strictly
a "home guard."
The assignment makes necessary the re
moval of the 'coast artillery from all posts
at which there are no fortifications. The
Presidio is. not a fortified; post; and the
companies on duty there will be sent to

LONDON, June 11.â A blue book Â¦ wa3
issued to-day containing the report of the
Transvaal concessions commission. It ia
clear, the commission avers, that a ; state
which has annexed another Is not legally
bound by any contracts made by the state
which has ceased, to exist, and , that no
court of law has jurisdiction to enforce
such contracts if the annexing â¢ state re
fuses to recognize them.
The commission recommends that the
Government decline to recognize the dyKa*
mite and other concession?, and adds that
It ..Is satisfied Dr. Leyds and others have
received from certain directors shares and
financial - considerations.
Regarding the Netherlands-South Afri
can railroad, the report, while admitting
that the concession was legally granted,
considers it injurious that trunk railroad
lines should be. the monopoly of a single
company, especially ' a . foreign company.
The concession should be terminated, even
If the. company's conduct is not open to
complairft." But its ', extraordinary action
in the war precludes the possibility of its
continuance under British administration.
Discussing, the position of tha share
holders, the report says, that tha belliger
ent acts ."for whlph all* the shareholders
were legally responsible" caused immense
damage to Great Britain, Cape Colony and
Natal. The British Government, as an act
of grace, may show some consideration to
the shareholders,. but the commission con
siders'this should ' be - postponed till -the
shareholders have exhausted the remedies
open to them against* the directors, and
untilthe damage done by the company is
made good. ;> The commission recommends
the debenture holders', to full recognition.

Ftories cf how he had hobnobbed -with
SMerpont Morgan. Russell Sage was a
dear friend, and Hetty Green would be
shocked if she heard of his predicament.
-When asked about the" $16,000 tha.t he is
charged with having appropriated \ to /his
own use he maintained a resolute silence.
After the victory Geirshofer and Attor
ney Cochrane walked down the stairs. The
attorney then walked outside the doors.
Half a dozen officers asked him where his
client was, and he responded, "Oh, he just
stepped into the Sheriff's office for a min
ute." That was the last seen of Gelr-
Ehofer, but how he left the building no
one seems to know, and what route he
Xook from San Rafael is as much of a
mystery.
District Attorney Mclsaac made the
best of a bad case, and Judge Angellotti
brought the proceedings to a close by
directing the Sheriff to discharge- the pe
titioner from custody. The affair ended
so quickly that the courtroom was still
nearly empty.
Discharge of the Prisoner.
Promptly at ? o'clock this afternoon
Sheriff Taylor brought Geirshofer Into
the Superior Court- Attorney Cochrane
was on 'hand, as was also District Attor
ney Mclsaac. Judge Angellotti called the
<:ase. There was a manifest desire on
the part of the district Attorney to se
cure a continuance of the proceedings for
several days. This aroused Attorney
C'ochrane. who insisted upon an immedi
ate hearing, as business' would call- him
away to-morrow for several d^.ys.
When Judge Angellotti decided that the
case should proceed. Geirshofer smiled for
the first time in a week. The proceeding
following did not occupy ten minutes.
Attorney Cochrane contended that Geir-
Ehofer was deprived of his liberty without
any authority of law. The only process
that even lent color to his detention, he
said, was a warrant Issued by the Court
of General Sessions in New York charg
ing the petitioner with grand larceny in
the first degree. The warrant merely di
rected the arrest of the defendant by anv
peace officer in that State. Besides, the
lawyer argued, the defendant could only
be held upon a process from a court that
had exclusive jurisdiction of the offense.
According to Attorney Cochrane, Geir
ehofer's detention was a gTand mistake.
Geirshofer in the Court.
To-day's proceedings caused no sur
prise. Sheriff Taylor, after consulting
Â¦with District Attorney Mclsaac, yester
day came to lhe conclusion that while,
he had the much-sought man, the process
he held him on was worthless in the face
of the habeas corpus proceedings which
Â¦were commenced by Attorney Cochrane.
This morning at 9 o'clock the Sheriff no
tified Captain Seymour of the San Fran
cisco Police Department that in all prob
ability Glershofer would be released at
S o'clock this afternoon, when the writ
would be heard. The San Francisco po
lice have shown an interest in the case,
and this step was taken to enable them
to be on the lookout for the man from
Xew York.

ehofer. who is wanted In New York for
alleged grand laiceny, was released from
the custody of Sheriff Taylor this after

The President's Intimate personal and

that they had not expected such an an

the President would not, so quickly take

tention to the talk. No, he said. It was
due to himself and the American public
that this third-term .nonsense should stop
at once. Nothing could. change his mind
'about it and the statement was given out'
to-day at the White House, all the news
paper men with whom the President is
personally acquainted being notified.
Supporters of William J. Bryan say the
President is nrerely putting aside his
crown as Caesar did and that he did not
write his letter until he found from the
newspapers { that there was still a deep
prejudice against a third term. The
President is really entitled to more con-,
sideration. He feels, the weight of his
responsibilities. Two days before his sec
ond inauguration he said to a caller:*.
"My friend; if I were leaving this place
on Monday to â¢ return to my home at
Canton and to private -life I should wel
come the change with sentiments of re
lief too deep to be described."

will give special prominence to a charge
that the offensive affidavit, for which
Judge Humphreys on the Saturday pre
vious to the bar meeting sentenced
Messrs. Harfwell, XCinney and Bailou to
thirty days for contempt, was designed
with deliberation for the purpose of irri
tating the Judge into committing some ju

; Grand Jury Still in Session.
The Thurstoa habeas corpus case i3 now
pending before Chief Justice Frear on
briefs. If it should hang fire until tha
Grand Jury term Is over, the result will
be â¢ the . avoidance of the imprisonment
clause . of the sentence, but as that end
has already probably been secured by Mr.
Thurston's previously reported divul
gence of 'his client's name to. the Grand
Jury, the delay in the Supreme Court has
no importance.
When the Grand Jury will adjourn was
made a fresh uncertainty yesterday. The
jury came into court and informed the
Judge that tbey had, after eighteen days"
work, prepared a report on the , legisla
tive bribery matter. This they presented.
Since preparing the report, however, they
had been given the names of new wit
nesses. / Judge Humphreys directed that
the report be placed on the secret flies un
til the Grand Jury reported the result of
their examinations of the additional wit
nesses. -
This turn of event3 came about curious
ly. A reporter of the Advertiser talked j
outside about some fresh revelations that
paper was going to make to-day upon the
bribery matter. It had secured a witness
to an actual transaction in legislative cor.
ruption. - This came to the ears of thÂ©
Grand Jury and among the new witnesses
it' transpired yesterday the Advertiser
staff was represented.
Home Rule Envoy Becltley, on reappear
ing in the House from bis mission to San
Francisco, gave a verbal report of his in
terviews with President McKinley of
identical tenor to the statements he made
before his departure to the San Francisco
press. The House since his return ha3
been working diligently on the appropria
tion bill. , It is observing to some extent
the* advice of the President, through Mr.
Beckley. to "make "economy" the watch

' A majority report of the Military Com

TRAIN DISPATCHERS WHO ARE TAKING PROMINENT PARTS / IN
THE PROCEEDINGS OF^ THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL CONVEN
â¢TION, WHICH. IS BEING.HELD AT RED MEN'S HALL.
Reports were received from the train
rules committee, the executive commltte
and Secretary and Treasurer J. P. Mackie.
v Only once was ' the tranquillity of the
proceedings disturbed. J. W.' James did
not join in the general congratulations
which were being bestowed on Editor
Mackie, but instead read a paper criticiz
ing his policy. The friends of -Editor
Mackie had got wind of Mr. James' -, in
tended speech, and when he rose to de
liver it they interposed many objections."
A torrid time reigned for a short interval.
Mr. James' friends . claimed that liberty
of speech was being . suppressed,' Â¦ while
Editor Mackie's partisans wanted to have
the speech first referred to the executive
committee so < that objectionable features
might be stricken out. When Mr. James
was finally allowed to have his say "the
apprehension of Mr. Mackie's friends
proved not to be warranted. The speech
contained some very timid criticism and
wound up with an appeal to the delegates
to elect the speaker in . Editor Mackie's
stead. *
Criticism for | Editor's Policy.
Although considerable business was ac
complished during the. morning session,
practically nothing was done in the after
noon. The time was spent listening to
technical reports, giving the glad hand to
each other and-. complimenting the secre
tary and treasurer, J. F. Mackie, for the
manner in which he. has conducted the
official organ of the association.'
been offered by the Rev. Edgar J. Won,
pastor of St. Stephen's Episcopal Church,
Mayor James D. Phelan was introduced
and welcomed the visiting trainmen to
the hospitality of the city. The Mayor
dwelt on the brilliant' prospects of. this
city, and State, attributing the major part
of their possibilities to the transconti
nental railroads.', In speaking of matters
pertaining to the convention . he paid a
tribute. to. the train dispatchers,' "the men*
into whose hands are entrusted the lives
of the traveling public." -"'- 1 - - s:
Secretary and Treasurer J. F.' Mackle
made an . appropriate response to the
Mayor's words of -welcome, saying that
the hospitality of California is famed all
over the Union, but that he did not ap
preciate its real extent until he had
reached -Los Angeles on his way to the
convention.
After innumerable congratulatory let
ters and telegrams from, prominent rail
road officials and absent members of the
association had been read the convention
got down to business. President J. R.
Lusk presented his annual report," show-
Ing that during the past year the associa
tion has increased in membership and in
financial standing, and suggesting several
valuable changes in - the system of ' con
ducting business. Just before the con
vention adjourned for ; the noon recess
over fifty candidates for membership who
had presented their applications .were
voted into the association. Â¦

Proposition to the San Fran- '
cisco Supervisors.

a large hay grower of this county, has
offered to break the combination formed
by San Francisco hay firms who deai with
the Supervisors and Fire Commissioners

directly with the farmers they could save
from S3 to $5 per ton.
In the bids submitted last week the hay
combine's lowest price was $13 06 for No. 1
wheat and $12 60 for oats. Percy offers to
furnish No. 1 wheat delivered in San
Francisco at $10 50, and oats at $8 50. A
meeting of hay men will be held Saturday
to see if they cannot deal directly with the
Supervisors and Commissioners.

dead whose bodies have been recovered
are:
WILLIAM McCUNE. superintendent of
tne company's mines along the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad. Body found in the
passage-way, about 1000 feet from the

superintendent; Clarence Settler, Daniel
McCullough and Thomas Gleason. All are
badly burned and bruised. Harry Bever
ldge and Arthur Smith cannot live.
Twelve of the dead are men who went
into the mine as rescuers. What caused
the explosion and loss of life Is something
that the inspectors of the Ninth antl
Eleventh districts spent the greater part
of to-day trying to find out. Th officials
of the coal company declare that none but
regulation mine lamps were used, while
others are of the opinion that one of the
men carelessly ignited the gas and caused
the catastrophe.
Mine Inspector Callahan, accompanied
by seven men. descended the shaft to-day
and started upon an ivestigation tour of
the mine. The men gave the signal to be
lowered at 9:04 o'clock, and about an hour
afterward a terrific report was heard. It
was another explosion and grave fears
â¢were entertained for their safety, but all
reappeared unharmed.
"I never had been in a mine in the con
dition of this. one," said Callahan. "I &m
nearly exhausted from swallowing so
much afterdamp. My lungs are like coals
of fire. There is no hope of 'saving any
persons in the mine, and it may be a year
before the bodies are recovered. It will
take two days to fill the mine with water
and twelve months to pump it out again."
KANSAS CITY, June 1Lâ Not since the
Democratic National Convention have so
many visitors from all parts of the United
States been in Kansas City as are gath
ered here to attend the twenty-seventh
national meeting of the Nobles of the
Mystic Shrine. Gorgeously appareled
Arabs have illumined the streets all day.
With morning and night parades, a ses
sion of the Imperial Council and sightsee
ing, the Shriners have spent an exceed
ingly busy day. The imperial ottlcers
were escorted from the Hotel Baltimore
to the Standard Theater this morning by
all the uniformed Shriners and a large
number of Shriners in carriages. . After
the welcoming speeches at the theater all
but delegates were excluded and the coun
cil entered upon its business of consider
ing the reports of the ameers and commit
tees. The session adjourned at 1 p. m.
until 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, when
ofneers will be elected and the next place
of meetins chosen.
Shriners Parade Streets.
Beautiful weather favored the Shriners.
Thc official ceremonies began this morn
ing, when the nobles were accorded a,
military escort trom their headquarters
to the Standard Theater. The imperial
officers, headed by Ix>u B. "Winsor of Heed
City, Mich., imperial potentate, and P. C.
Shaffer of Philadelphia, deputy imperial
potentate, rode in carriages, each arawn
by four white horses. 'i"he grand mar
t-nal, E. F. Allen, and his aides were
mounted, as was the patrol of the Almas
Temple of Washington, D. C, and a pa
trol of Ararat Temple of Kansas City.
Patrols from a halt hundred cities fol
lowed on foot. The nobles from Wash
ington in their Bedouin costumes were
tingled out for the heartiest cheering that
greeted the cavalcade on its way through
streets lined with people. At the Stan^
dard Theater there followed at 1:30 an ex
change of greetings and an address from
the imperial potentate. Then came an
executive meeting of the officials of the
order.
Grand Night Celebration.
The downtown streets were given over
to-night to "brass bands and marching
Shriners, in brilliant Oriental costumes,
with an accompaniment of fireworks and
the booming of mortars. The splendor
of the costumes of the Arab patrols was
enhanced by the electric lights and by the
pyrotechnics set off by the Topeka Flam
beau Club, which led the procession.
Ararat Temple of this city furnished one
of the most attractive features of the
parade. The regular patrol of Ararat
Temple was garbed in velvet, satin and
fine cloth. The other organizations were
no less brilliantly arrayed in purple and
scarlet, chrome yellow and ultramarine
blue, and all the extreme tints in the cate
gory of colors were seen. Some of the
best bands in the country were in the pro
cession and the strains of martial music
were continuous.
Unique Features Presented.
A unique feature of the parade was the
India Temple patrol from Oklahoma City,
which indulged in typical Indian war
dances at regnlar Intervals. The Zuhroh
Temple's patrol from Minneapolis was
also in special favor with the crowds.
Perhaps the most picturesque division of
the pageant was the mounted patrol of
Washington, D. C. This patrol, each
member of which wore the costume of an
Aral> Shiek, belongs to - the Almas
Temple. . -â¢ . . . . -..
The Abdallah Temple of Leavenworth
consisted of forty men and their costumes
were Â¦wonderful. The men wore long and
loose coats made of goods of Persian de
sign.
The head of the parade reached Conven
tion Hall at 10 o'clock. The Arab patrols
each company headed by a band, passed
in at the main entrance at the south end
of the building. The entire arena floor
was set apart for. the maneuvers of the
patrols and after giving an exhibition of
fancy drilling they marched out through
the north end of the building. The seat
ing capacity of the hall, in the boxes and
balconies and the space in the roof gar
den, was reserved for women. No men
Â¦were admitted other than those having to
do with the management of the entertain
ment. â¢ .

TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR HUMPHREYS
After a dozen, or more .speeches the
resolution was carried by a vote of 37 to 7.
The following amendment, moved by F.
M. Hatch, former Minister, of Foreign
Affairs and Minister to Washington, was
negatived by practically the same vote:
"Resolved, That the Bar. Association of
the Hawaiian Islands deprecates the atti
tude of Hon. A. S. Humphreys toward the
attorneys of his court as an infringement
of the right of every lawyer to â¢ practice
law fearlessly and independently in the In
terests'of his client." . ,. - Â» ...
,Mr. r Hatch, in proposing his amendment,
said he appealed for fair play and that
it seemed to him' that at best "the fight
Â¦was - largely one between newspapers."
The Bar Association, as a matter of fact,
had Â¦ very, little to do . with it. He hoped
the, fight would be left with the news
papers, where.' it had started and where
it still- belonged. * - -'*
Powerful speeches, were made against
the resolution by T. McCants Stewart, an
American colored man, Frank E. Thomp
son, J. Alfred Magoon and former Judge
Silliman. ,.Â»..'
Instead of the matter being fought out
byrthe newspapers, as Mr. Hatch claimed,
since * the, morning after the meetingâ
when both the Advertiser, which had been
bitterly attacking . Judge Humphreys for
months . in letterpress .and I cartoon, . and
the Republican devoted pages . to . the re
port and continentsâ the papers have had
very little to say upon the controversy..
To-morrow,- -however, the Republican
Make Appeal for Fair Play.
The first clause of the 'preamble states
that Judge* Humphreys "has { continued
since his appointment to publish and con
trol a partisan newspaper, and has taken
and continues - ; to. take. an", active part and
leadership in bitter political controversies
in this territory."
The second "whereas" is that the judge
"has used Â¦ his position on the ; bench for
his own personal and political ends."
Thirdly, "the Â¦ said Hon. A. S. Humph
reys has been "arrogant and insulting in
his conduct Â¦ toward memnen of the bar,
and has abused his powers over attorneys
and others appearing before his court."
And, lastly, "the course of said Hon. A.
,S." ' Humphreys since his Â¦ appointment to
the. bench has destroyed the confidence of
the bar in his- administration of justice.**
â¢ It Is then first resolved, "That the Bar
Association '" of ; the Hawaiian Islands
deems it absolutely necessary in the inter
. ests : of :the administration of justice in
this territory that said A. S: Humphreys
be removed from the office of judge.".
. Then it is : resolved to appoint a com
mittee of five members to take depositions
and statements of members of the associ
ation and others regarding the conduct
and acts of Judge Humphreys, also to
formulate charges against - him, allot
which incriminating material is to be pre
sented by one or .more members of - the
committee to the President and the Attor
ney General of the United States.

A: S. Humphreys, first judge of the Cir

The betting on the. American team,
which began at 6 to 5 against, closed to
night at 10 to i in their favor. 1 Neverthe
less, Paul North and ( the American
leaguers declare that all the members of
the team are shooting far beneath their
usual level. It was fully expected that tha
team could kill 90 per cent of the birds,
but to-day's results showed less than 87
per cent.
The high winds and the. unfamiliar sur
roundings hai much to do Â¦with this.
Crosby lead the American score with 93
birds; Budd secured 89, Tripp and Heikes
88 each, and the lowest was 691
As the British team used a double bar
reled gun and the Americans a single bar
rel weapon, it was interesting to note
that the British team used 33 to 40 per

score. " -

FRANCESCO'S HANOVEB STAKES.
Mate Huber is spoken of by those who
have worked with him as a man not ad
dicted to violence. The Chinaman, who
had made two trips here with the schoon
er, is also well spoken of. I The; exact
cause ofthe trouble that led to such * a
terrible crime will probably never be
known. , ;-*Â¦:- ;
On the afternoon of the 10th the bodies
of both the victim and the -murderer were
buried at sea,', funeral services being con
ducted by Mrs. Smith. The mate. was bu
ried firsthand half an hour later the body
of the Chinaman ; who killed him: was
dropped into the water after a burial ser
vice. . Â» .: ' > '. Â¦â¢â¢:.Â¦-â¢-: *. '..--, Â¦ .,';
The watch continued all night, and the
next morning !t was decided as a last re
sort to adopt the horrible method of
steaming' the -murderer , out of his unap
proachable-refuge. The donkey engine
was fired and the necessary connections
were made. A force of steam was turned
into the galley where the Chfnaman lay
in wait. .The crew heard a .pistol .shot
while they were at -work, but paid ; no
attention to it, not knowing but that.it
was a trick of Ah Kee to make them think
he had killed himself. Steam was turned
into the galley ! and the force was kept
up for an hour. Then the men entered
the cook's quarters.- They found Ah Kee
seated in a chair with a bullet . wound
through his head. A revolver lay where
it had dropped. from his hand.- The steam
had fairly cooked his flesh, ., so that the
body came apart when the men ' removed
it. -Â¦ '. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦
Suicide of the Murderer.
Captain Smith distributed arms among
the crew and tried to get Ah Kee out.
Kee only showed himself once. Then the
second mate covered him with a revolver,
and the Mongolian went back into the
galley. The mate says he would have
fired had not other members of the crew
been in his line of fire.
Night settled down and the schooner
continued on iier course with the galley
in possession of the murderer and the en
tire â¢ crew armed. and watching for him.
There was a quantity of kerosene where
the murderer was, and it was feared that
he would set fire to the ship. The cap
tain got a bucket brigade ready to fight
fire, and made- arrangements to turn the
water from the vessel's tanks into the
galley should a fire be started.
Â¦i* â Â¦ 7â ' Â¦ ; â â ,*r
The latter retreated into the galley and
fired a shot.. It was impossible to enter
the galley except through. a very, narrow
space, down a ladder from the high deck
load of lumber, and the Chinaman's at
titude convinced; all .that it was certain
death for any one to attempt to make the
entrance. -Mrs. Smith offered to go and
try to pacify the Chinaman, but her hus
band would not allow her to do so..

A Night of Terror.
In the meantime the second mate and
Captain Smith started to arrest the cook.
The trouble occurred on May 9, when
the vessel was seven days out on her
Journey. The members of the crew state
that they do not know the cause of the
quarrel that ended in the double , tragedy,
but Mate Huber was heard by . the sec
ond mate, William Manning, to threaten
to "do up" the cook. Huber entered the
galley where the cook. Ah Kee. was do
ing his work. A moment later he came
out and started to climb up the ladder
that led from the galley to the top of the
vessel's deck load of lumber. - Ah Kee
flred with a revolver as Huber climbed,
and when Huber reached the deck and
started for the mainmast the Chinese
fired again. The matcfell near the com
panionway and died soon after being re
moved to the cabin, wherp Mrs; Smith,
the captain's wife, did all that could be
done for him.

were brought last Sunday by the Amer

E. Smith, from -Port Blakeley with lum
ber. The mate of the vessel, Adam Hub
er, was. murdered by the Chinese cook,
and the latter, after terrorizing the whole
crew by holding possession of the galley
for - nearly twenty-four hours, ' during
which it was every moment feared that
he would set fire to the vessel, was sub
jected to a steaming process to bring him
out. He finally shot himself rather than
come forth and be captured. When the
crew entered the galley they found the
Chinaman's body literally cooked by
steam. . . . â¢

money in the last race by good work at
the finish. Sir "Hampton with McCarthy
in "Â¦ the saddle made -the place, and Cas
take, at long. odds, the, show. Pat Mor
rissey, the 1 favorite, was taken out soon
after the start and led until the stretch,
when the graveyards opened and Pat fell
in.
After leading all the. way to the pad
dock,. Glendenning lost the handicap for
2-year-olds to Carlo. Carlo, with Rus
sell in the saddle, held . a good position,
and by a hard drive beat Glendenning out
for first money. . Escalante, third choice,
po the show. Glendenning with Achilles
figured at 9-5, Escalante apd Carlo being
listed at 3 to 1. Glendenning was fa
vored on account of weight, Carlo being
ballasted with 122.
The choices fell into the sea in the sec
ond race, and when the full four furlong
course was lioofed, three long-shots
helped their backers to a round sum of
money.; J. Alexander on Marelio. made a
strong finish, capturing the purse. Gypsy
Boy, with J. McCarthy on top, played a
strong second until a few yards before
the Judges' stand, when Robert Bonner
II won out the place. * ' â¢

following with a broad stretch of- day*
light showing. Torsida, much favored in
the ring, made the show..
Buck Taylor, a heavily played favorite,
won ;the fourth race, but only, after a
hard - struggle to hold the first position
in the ; stretch. Leading pretty much all
the way,' it looked an easy victory for
Buck until Romero on Frank "Woods

THE Mariners* Church, on Sacra

very pretty wedding at noon yes
terday. The ceremony was
unique, inasmuch as the grand
father made his grandson a benedict on
the same spot and at the same hour on
which he had married his son twenty
five years ago.
The Rev. Joseph Rowell has been pastor
of the Mariners* Church for over thirty
years. His sen. Professor Joseph C.
Rowell. is now librarian of the University
cf California, and his' grandson. J. Ar
thur Rowell. is assistant librarian. On
June 11, 1ST6, at noon. Professor Rowell
was married by his father in the Mari
ners' Church. Yesterday at noon he and
his wife stood before their father in the
same place and renewed the vows plight
ed a generation ago.
Beside Professor Rowell stood his son.
J Arthur Rowell, and beside Mrs. Rcw
eil stood Miss M. Grace Miller of Santa
RoÂ«=a while near by stood Clarence F.
Rowell and Miss Olive Kurtz. As soon
as Professor Rowell and his wife had re
newed their vows they stepped back and
Joseph C. Rowell and Miss Miller took
their place before the head of the fam
ilyâRev. Joseph Rowell. The marriage
service was then read, and in a few min
utes the young couple were husband and
wife. The bride is a graduate of the
fniversity of California, and is a great
favorite in Santa Rosa. â¢
Before marrying his grandson. Key.
Mr. Rowell referred to the fact that his
ancestors came to America nearly 300
vears ago, an.i in all those Tears there
had been nothing but upright. God-fear
ing men among them. This record was in
th! keeping of the rising generation and
would undoubtedly be kept inviolate,
were the concluding words of the divine.

that is an easy rule to enforce, as they
are not fond of liquor. â¢ They are great

waged war on each other. They delight
in wholesale slaughter. I have collected,
however, all the arms and weapons I
could secure and think this will put a
check on the fights in the future.
"I enlisted fifty-eight Samoans as sail
ors in the navy and they act as a guard
of the islands. .They receive about $20 a
month salary each and are. the most im
portant men in the islands.' They plcked :
up their drill with wonderful promptness,
and after short instruction with the rifle
became good shots. The islands are of
great value to the United States, as they
have a number of fine harbors which can
be used as a place of refuge during hurri
car.es.- We also have a fine site for a coal

ated a sum of money to enable us to en
large the 'coal capacity of the-harbor to

A letter was received yesterday- from the
Iowa headquarters of the league and the
officials of that State are sanguine that
they will win the coveted emblem. At
least 1000 delegates are assured from Iowa
and it is expected that many more will
attend. The Iowans already hold the in
ternational banner for the greatest num
ber of subscriptions to the Epworih
League Herald. . New York, Penns/:vanta
and some of the New England States arc
also well up in the race.
The missionary branch of the organiza
tion promises one of the most attractive
exhibits at Mechanics' Pavilion. Natives
of every clime will be present anl show
specimens of their manual skill and in
tellectual attainments. The Indian ex
hibit will be made a special feature and
a large number of converted Indians will
be brought down from Mendocino County.
The new bulletin issued by the officials
contains much information of value to
those planning to attend the event. The
question of accommodations is one of se
rious import and every effort is being
made to provide for the many thousand
guests. There will be no free entertain
ment, but very advantageous rates have
been secured from many of the leading
hotels. The league officials, however, are
ready to assure prospective visitors of
proper accommodations.

half the English press spoke or it as a master
ful retreat.- They say that the South African
war caused the death of Queen Victoria. That
may be so, but I predict that so sure as Eng
land perseveres In her policy, toward the 'Boers
and Chamberlain is continued as the head of
the administration of affairs, so sure will that
policy cause the death of the British empire.'
Do not believe the reports that Botha is nego
tiating for peace. No later than last September
I was a witness to an agreement between Botha
and Dewet that neither would sign (articles or
make a treaty without the other's sanction.
Kruger himself has not the power to make
peace. Botha and Dewet are the only ones who
have the" right, and they will not do it unlesa
the Colonials are exonerated for the assistance
they gave the' Boers. England is engaged in a
war of extermination. . She cannot Â¦ catch the
men in the neld, bo she fights defenseless wo
men and children; but she will "find that the
Almighty is in supreme command, and justice
will yet prevail. Â¦â¢ . , ... â¢ "
The only grievance that England has is that
the Boers had the temerity to deliver their ulti
matum to one of the greatest powers of the
world. We stand now on as good ground to grain
our independence as we did eighteen months
ago when we flred the first shot. John Bull has
been bullying people smaller than he Is for
many years past, but some day he will meet
some one his size, who will take the. wind out
of him once and forever. The great grievance
with us is the increase of dividends to be paid
the Enelish Government and the reduction in
the labor. â¢ â¢ . ....
Commandant Krige's lecture consisted
of a highly interesting description of the
South African troubles from a Boer stand
point. -He arraigned the English Govern
ment In no uncertain terms for its policy
of suppression and his remarks were fre
quently applauded. After briefly review
ing the incidents which led : to the Boer
uprising, Krige said: ,
A good sized audience was â¢ present last
night at Metropolitan' Temple to hear a
lecture on the Boer war by an escaped
prisoner of war. Commandant Jan Krige,
an officer on^the staff of General Botha. Â¦
The lecture was given under' the auspices
of . the Wilhelmina Society. The lecturer
was introduced by Thomas Barry, .who
was presented as chairman of the even
ing, by M. C. Van der Kamp, president of
the society. Seated on the stage was P.
J. Van Loben Sels, Consul for the Neth
erlands. Â¦ ' .' - .
England for Suppression Policy.
IiECTTTRES ON BOER WAR.
Commandant * Jan Krige Arraigns
Major McBride tells how Kruger pro
hibited a fight near the border line, and
rather than be captured by the British
troops the remnant of the Irish Brigade
entered Portuguese territory and surren
dered to the officials. The men were taken
to Lourenzo Marques and then sent to
Europe by a Boer agent,' money being
given them to reach their homes in all
parts of the world. McBride will shortly
give a lecture on his experiences.
"Five days before Kruger sent his ulti
matum to England, we were sent down to
the Natal border. We had a skirmish
with the British soldiers at Elands
Laagte. but the first big fight was at Dun
dee. . General Symons was in command
there and he died of his wounds. He was
.the first English general to fall." Our brig
ade was in the fight at Nicholsen's Nek
and Modder Spruit on October 30, 1S9D,
when the Boers won a big victory and
captured many of the English soldiers.
We went through air the fighting around
Ladysmith and on the Tugela River, wrien
Buller tried to break through. " â¢
"I was at the battle of Colenso on De
cember 15, 1S99, when the son of Lord
Roberts was killed. I saw him galloping
down to the captured guns, but did not
know who he was. I learned later that he
was the son of the British general. Lieu
tenant Colonel Bullock, who was In com
mand of the guns, surrendered to me. I
was the first on our side to reach the
guns."
Major McBride told how the news of
Cronje's capture on Majuba day, April 23,
1900. took the heart out of the Boers
around I^adysmith.and they fell back. He
participated in the retreat of the Boers
into the Free State .and on to Pretoria
under Botha. The Irish Brigade went to
pieces close to the. Portuguese border,
where it was surrounded by the British
troops and fifty of their horses were cap
tured, leaving only fifteen mounted men.
"Shortly after the Jamieson raid," '.he
said, "I went to South Africa. I knew
that It was only a -question of time that
there would be righting and I wanted to
be in it. I arrived In Johannesburg in
1896. I secured employment in one of the
mines as an assayer. Six weeks before
the war broke out, I started with Colonel
Blake to organize the body known as the
Irish Brigade. I saw Kruger on two occa
sions and he- knew exactly what I was
doing. A number of meetings were held
in Johannesburg, and when the brigade
was formed we offered our services to the
Transvaal. We. numbered about 500 men
and the Government equipped us with
I arms and horses. ' . Â¦
Major McBride belongs to a -well-known
Irish family and the spirit: of adventure
led him to throw In his lot with- Kruger'3
followers. He was seen last evening at
the house of friends in the Mission, where
he is stopping, 'and told of his career as
a fighter for "Oom Paul.".
Major John McBride, â¢ who fought In
Blake's Irish Brigade oh the side of the
Boers in the war In South Africa, ar
rived in the Â¦ city last evening.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
According to Mr. Hyde a university is a species of
partnership in which six parties are interestedâ 1,
founders and benefactors; 2, the state; 3, trustees*
4, professors and instructors;. 5, students; 6, the
constituency of the college, or -that- portion of 'the
community from which its students and its money
comes. Of the rights of the founder. the speaker said:
"He has no right whatever to dictate the specific view
which the institution shall teach. The moment a donor
has given his money he has entered into a partnership
with the. five other parties of the institution^ and his
rights must be limited by the rights which belong to
them. Neither may lie legitimately; draw up a creed
or statement of opinion which the professors of the
institution shall be bound to teach. . .To do that would
be like sending a boat to sea .with the tiller lashed in
The issue, as he pointed out, has become one of
practical, importance because universities no longer
confine their instruction to Greek, Latin and mathe
matics and other subjects over which there is nothing
in the way of political controversy. The prominence
given in later years to courses in social and economic
questions on which people are divided, and on some
of which questions political campaigns are carried on,
has naturally led to attempts at least to interfere with
the freedom of teaching. In consequence of that
state of affairs President Hyde rightly says: "To de
fine accurately the rights and duties of the parties to
such university education, securing reasonable "Jiberty
for all and absolutely free course for the truth, is the
most pressing educational problem which the nine
teenth century has handed. over to the twentieth."* Â¦

It will be interesting to note the tactics which the
opponents of an isthmian canal will bring to bear
against this enlarged policy.
The policy of President- McKinlcy brings the reali
zation of the canal nearer than it has been before in
the century and ten years since the project was first
agitated. The proposition began in the eighteenth
century, was a subject of discussion during all the
nineteenth, and seems about to be achieved early in
the twentieth.
The relative economy of the two routes will depend,
of course, upon the price for which our Government
can secure the work already performed by the French
company. It is known that the Colombian Govern
ment will impose no obstacles.
It is known that De Lesseps in selecting the Pan
ama route was influenced by the judgment of Hum
boldt and the investigations of the American en
gineer. Lieutenant Strain, and no engineers have
questioned the practicability of De Lesseps' plans.
Humboldt, who critically examined and exhaust
ively treated of five canal routes in his "Political Es
say on the Kingdom of New Spain," favored the
Panama route. The distance across the isthmus by
that route is less than* thirty miles by a straight line.
He said: "The third route is across the isthmus of
Panama, by the Rio Chagres, which empties into the
Caribbean Sea. This, being the narrowest part of the
isthmus, is the route tc which the attention most nat
urally first directs itself. The course of the Chagres
from its mouth to the town of Cruces, where it ceases
to be navigable, is forty-three miles. Thence the dis
tance across to the Bay of Panama on the Pacific is
only fifteen miles."
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL.
THE CALL said some months ago that the de
feat of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty would bring
into focus an alternative canal proposition
which would put it in the power of he administration
to force a canal through in defiance of opposing inter
ests. It could easily have two strings to its canal
"bow, and take to itself the imperishable credit of
crowning its career and enriching its record by assur
ing the completion of and perhaps completing the
great work and leaving it free of European inter
national complications. This, we said, could be done
by taking up the Panama route. It is now more than
intimated that Admiral Walker's commission of ex
perts will report both routes practicable, with cheap
ness on the side of the Panama canal.
In the face,' of such odds '.and. with', but- a forlorn
hope of victory. to cheer them. the. prolonged and'gal
lant.struggle,of. the , Boers forms' one" of the noblest
illustrations of patriotic constancy and courage ever
given in the history of the world. It has'now become
something of an oft-told story, and the mass Vf man

but none the less; the record of \he" war. continues to
deserve attention and to' merit the admiration of-man
kind. Not even'in the first fierce "rush o'f. the: Boers

done or better generalship been exhibited than in these,

â¢In a speech in the House of last winter
Mr. Wyndham, after stating that-the British/ forces
at that time in South numbered , 213,000,
pointed out that it was, the largest army Great.Brit
ain ever put into the. field. Â¦ Since- that time more
than 100,000 additional troops have; been. sent to the
seat of war. The whole region of hostilities has been
mapped out like a checker-board and "a British force
placed in each square-to, drive out the Boers. In
many sections' < the \ whole" country has been laid
waste. By such means the strength : of the defenders
has been continuously' weakened. In a late dispatch
summing- up_the- results of- his operations 'for the
month of May Lord' Kitchener stated that the num
ber of Boers killed or captured during the month was
2040. Such a wearing away process 'must; eventually
result in ; the destruction of the Boer. armies, for they
have no means of- recruiting their "strength, but the
process is evidentl/ going to be.along one. ~
A recent, official statement places the number of
Boer prisoners in -the hands of the British at 19,042.
These men have been "captured, 'but they have not
surrendered* the cause of their country. ".A British
correspondent who talked with many of them at St.
Helena .reports that in. his opinion they will never
submit permanently to Â¦ British rule. . He' says that
when told that at. the close of the war the two re-,
publics would be governed as crown colonies the
Boers mocked at the. suggestion and* proclaimed an
intention to take up arms. again if they were ever sent
back to their homes. \ Thus it appears that while$the
Boers in the field are' spirited .and those in prison
are sullen, both retain a seemingly indomitable' deter
mination to fight so - long as life lasts rather than
yield up the independence of their, republics.' 'We
have here an illustration of that unconquerable Dutch
resolution - that defied Phillip of . Spain arid resisted
successfully the power: of an^empire which was then
the mightiest in Europe. 'â Â¦ ., '
SWIFTLY following the reports of the battle of
Vladfontein arid of the capture of Jamestown,
in Cape Colony, by the Boers come now the
further announcements that a force, of Boers', has
occupied a strong position near Dordrecht, while a
considerable, army under Dewet holds a position in
the hills commanding the British lines of communi
cation. With such -reports succeeding one another
so -rapidly it is hardly likely the statement, that: Gen
eral Botha is willing, to center- into' negotiations for
surrender can be correct.*, If theBoer. general has;' en
tered into' negotiatio'tis^at fallv it 'has' probably,; been
solely for the purpose of gaining time for some
strategic movement. 7"

The other popular idol 'whose clay feet have been
exposed recently is the Rev. Mr.. Sheldon of To
peka, who widely advertised himself as a leader of
advanced thought. In his book, "Born to Serve," he
took the ground that the good people hired to help
in the house should have all the privileges of, the
family. Mrs. Sheldon recently hired a "help," who
put a plate and napkin for herself at the family
table and sat down, only to be ordered up to wait, on,
the table. The sincere maid iaid she had read Mr.
Sheldon's book and proposed- to carry out its teach
ings as to her rights if she remained in the Sheldon
family. She did not remain. .
Mr. Herron and his go-as-you-please companion
have gone to New Jersey to live out their ideas,
which he hotly insists conform to the Christian ideal
and standard. Probably the sequel will prove that he
is not worth the $60,000 paid for him by the mother
of his consort.
While the ceremonial part, of this union was per
formed by a clergyman, apparently to satisfy the
statutes of New York, the contract had certain pe
culiarities. The parties omitted the pledge that is in
tended to make the marriage tie permanent, and sub
stituted therefor a contract to live together as long
as the relation is mutually agreeable. We are per
fectly aware that marriage as a civil contract amounts
to that. But it' is also true that in a vast majority
of marriages the present intention of the marriage is
that the tie shall be permanent. The law directs what
conduct by either party shall be a violation of the
contract and work its dissolution. But to the normal
and wholesome mind the only element that makes the
relation tolerable at rll is the hope, expectation and
a desire that it shall endure. That. desire causes pa
tience, fosters unselfishness, maintains the adoles
cence of mutual affection, and is the sole final cause
of happiness and mutuality of purpose, and these ele
ments are in the foundation of the home which every
marriage is intended to establish. To accept the op
posite idea is as if the builder of a ship would say:
"The waters it must ride are wild and stormy, the
night and tempest are there; therefore why build
stanch and strong that which will be wrecked? Let
the/ribs of the ship be weak, its hull easy to breach;
its spars brittle, and its sides rotten. It will be
wrecked anyway."
Finally his classes began to wane and his influence
to fall away. The more rugged intellects which
studied his doctrine were soon aware of the imprac
ticability of his standard of life. Then his connection
with the college ceased and he was patronized on the
platform as a lecturer only by those whose radical
ism leads them to J believe that the ideals of anarchy
and Christianity are the same. Next he was heard of
on a tour to Europe with his rich patroness and her
daughter, and after an interval came a second tour
abroad in the same agreeable company, on each occa
sion his wife and children abiding at home. After
that second absence came a suit for divorce brought
by his wife on the ground of desertion and failure to
provide. The divorce was granted, and the statement
is uncontradicted that his patroness paid the deserted
wife the sum of $60,000 and the philosopher was free.
His union with the daughter of his patroness soon
followed. '
He is a man of ready expression and sumptuous
vocabulary, and for .a time his, lecture-room was
crowded and his admirers believed that he had
founded a permanent cult, and all who delight in what
is vaguely called "a movement" became his disciples.
He was privileged to stand among the" preachers of
his church and fate them soundly, scolding and scorn
ing to his heart's content, because manj' of them also
are in the habit of applying literally the figurative por
tions of the Bible. It occurred to none to put him
to the whole test of his method, which would require
submission to physical ordeals fatal 'to the empiric
who would venture to try them.
TWO men in this country,- both ordained minis
ters of the Gospel, 'have done a great deal in the
last few years to unsettle institutions and give
aid to the artificial classification of our people. One
of these is the Rev. George Herron.-, He gave to the
spiritual and metaphorical text of the Scriptures a
literal interpretation and professed to have thereby
raised a new standard, or the real standard of Chris
tianity. A wealthy woman became a' partisan of his
theories and mode of interpretation and greatly de
lighted a struggling denominational college at
Grinnell, Iowa, by endowing therein a chair of
"Applied Christianity," upon condition that Rev. Mr.
HÂ«rron should be selected to fill it.
IDOLS WITH CLAY FEET.
It-will be perceived that in this attempt to define
the rights and duties of the various partners to a uni-
Yersity there is after all a good deal left to the exer
cise of authority on the. part of the state and the trus
tees. Of course it is not to be expected that an exact
definition of academic freedom will ever be given, and
yet it is well to have public opinion. sensitive on the
subject, so that every instance of alleged interference
with the rightful liberty of instruction shall be. brought
to the bar of public opinion.' The popular verdict
may not.always be right.'but it is better to appeal to
it than to tolerate interference in such" matters without
taking an appeal at all. - ,- Â¦ . ..*
Upon the question of the status of. professors Presi
dent Hyde said: "Removal of professors for incom
petence is a duty of trustees and presidents which they
have never half lived up to. .To; shift the duty to
students or to the elective system, as is being done
at present, is cowardly negligence. The incompetent
man should be dismissed at the first opportunity.
Academic freedom demands it." \ - .-- â¢
Up to that point all/ seems clear .enough. v Mr.
Hyde, however, perceives- that, there must be some
check upon . a teaching i force Â¦ lest it run into all
kind of extravagances. - The power to apply the check
he would put in the hands of the state. k On that point
he says: "It is the duty. of tHe\ state to protect the
public against, misdirection of funds and the cheapen
ing of degrees. An institution founded ffr'.the prop
agation of -Christian: Science, - : theosophy. palmistry,
astrology or alchemy would have.no claim to 'exemp
tion from taxation or the conferring of: degrees, for
somcof these subjects have been proved to be without

make good their claim of public confidence. * Â¦ * *
Furthermore, the State should refuse charters
to institutions which attempt to duplicate means of
instruction already adequate. The state should not
support ten colleges' when five are adequate to serve
its educational needs. .The. state should refuse to
grant charters for the promulgation of individual 'preju-.
dice. It should not allow an institution'to bind itself
to teach either free trade or protection, the gold stan
dard or the free and unlimited coinage of silver at

Has woman, who has been so much Im
proved by the club, received any serious
injuries' from it? J believe that she has.
The most difficult virtue for an American
to practice is moderation. -Membership in
one club may be exhilarating; in two,
may be stimulating; but membership in
twenty clubs must be- distracting and
enervating. , . . :.
It is easy to say that it may not be at
tributed to the club'as a defect that
Â¦ women carry their devotion to it to ex
cess. True, as it may not be . attributed
to wine as a detect that men drink it to
excess. I am not counseling the prohibi

the club habit may be indulged in â nay,
is indulged inâ to excess by many women.

ofneer in thirty-four clubs and societies."
I am sure that among readers of this Ar
ticle .will' be Women who. know other
women who are officers or privates in a
still larger number of clubs and societies.
There, may be women, to whom the club
has become the. same monopolizer of time
and interest that Harriet Martineau ac
cused the church of being when she first
visited our country. Women, a large por
tion-of whose time is spent in meetings,
have- their, minds dissipated.- The best
intellectual work can be done only in soli

contemplation in solitude is indispensable.
Evil Effect . Upon the Home.
" 'Tis home where'er the heart is," says
the poet. 'Tis home where'er the woman
is in whose hand and heart are gathered
up all the threads of the lives that are be
ing lived under her roof. She who is such
a center, by. virtue of nature's appoint
ment and endowments, must sometimes
be found at the center. The house Is not a
home. when the woman who guides it is
not under its roof. Meetings, classes, so
cial functions limited exclusively to wo
men do, I verily . believe, consume an
amount of. time in personal preparation
and in personal participation which leaves
the woman too little time for sitting se
renely at the center. ' â¢

home much improved by their going out;
but it Is injured by their staying out too
long. Mothers have no time to follow
with daily care the progress and the in
terests of their own children because they
are members of committees that are look
ing after the interests and the progress
of all children. â -
: Do not, gentle -readerâ if by this time I
have one reader left, gentle or otherwise â
imagine that I do riot know that much
good has come to women, and to every
one related to them, through. their enter
ing upon public service on committees and
boards. Through this women have learned,
to recognize the common interests of all
children and tho sense of solidarity of in
terests aninns all classes has been
strengthened. Through this they have
learned that their own children cannot be
properly reared so long as the children of
any class in the community are neglected.
It is, however, a pity that in learning
this lesson women have become so ab
sorbed as to practice It to excess. Bring
ing up a child is an individual business.
It caMiot be done by a committee; neith
er caJT~~chlldren be brought up as soldiers
are trained, in a squad or a battalion. The
individual watchfulness, the individual
tuition, the daily conference with every
member of the familyâ this Is the highest
privilege of th-3 woman who sits at the
center of any home. But, as I have said
before, she must sometimes be found sit
ting at the center if she will enjoy this*
privilege, or if her children or her neigh
bor's children tre to reap the fruits of it.
It is well that In a woman's club wom
en should consider the literature appro
priate {or children; but it is ill- to carry
that consideration to such an exhaustive
degree that the womenÂ«who write the
papers and who lead the discussion on
the best books for children shall be
obliged to say that it has taken so much
time to read up the current criticism on
the subject, to . read the books and pre
sent their views, that, so far as their
own children are concerned, they ."haven't
Â¦read a single book with them for a year."
Evil' Effect Upon Society.
-It Is a curious reflection ; that : the club,
having for one of its unconfessed objects
the training of women into a sense of
equality with; men, has resulted in pro
ducing a wider and deeper cleavage be
tween men and jwomen. It ia a matter of
comment among all travelers that there
is less general societyâ that it, less society
in which men and women meet for social
interchange â in our country than j in any
other. -As a' matter "of fact men are al
most eliminated from society in the great
middle class. While many other* circum
stances and conditions conduce to this
separation of the sexes in. Bociety, the
satisfaction- which women, have found in
one another's company is a large element
in. the situation which, may. well be
studied, by ' socioliglsts. .-'. I believe, it ia
necessary for the higher development of
women that they should develop a capa
city for enjoying one another apart from'
the society^ of men; but one can witness
only, with regret the increasing desire of
men to hand over to their wives the duty
of discharging all social obligations and
the increasing, complacency with which
women accept the situation. That- men 1
and women are .both at their best in each
other's presence Is, I believe, an incontest
able; fact. Women, having - been accus
tomed to meeting: in their clubs apast'
from men, have grown more indifferent to
the presence of Â¦ men in other ..social're
lations. Breakfasts, '.luncheons and after-,
noon;teaa are "among most sections of
society -necessarily . limited to women * by
the fact,that the hours given over to'such
functions are devoted by men to bualnes3.
Dinners' and evening parties Â¦: : grow less
frequent in proportion to the .increasing
frequency of ."luncheons and .' afternoon
teas;-; so -the social- functions' which, for
merly brought men r and women together
socially, are less frequently? enjoyed than
formerly. ,. .; â¢ - ; . . - ..â¢'.,
I. have no doubt the effect -of* excusing
men from their social obligations and per-'
mitting them Â» to maintain their = social i
place .;, largely .through, the; /.vicarious
efforts of, their wives has as deteriorating
an effect upon them as it has.rupon
women; but it '.Is ojily to the 'effect upon
the latter that I shall refer. Â¦ *
In a former article I took pleasure in
stating what:, seem to. me -the good ef
fects of what is popularly known as "the
club movement." Less pleasure may be
found in, stating its evil effects, but a
higher, duty will be performed in calling
attention to them. 'Â¦; -
XVII.â THE .CLUB HABITâ ITS DISADVANTAGES.
(COPYRIGHT, 1901.)
By May "VVriglrt Serwa.ll.
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL, COUNCIL, OF WOMEN.
the company. A company exclusively, of
women is more likely to fall into person
ality and to tolerate a conversation hard
ly above gossip than a company composed
of both men and women. The women
who have grown out of the narrowness
of excluding from their club programmes
subjects of vital importance and of-cur-
rent world-interest have generally grown
into the habit of discussing such subjects
only at their clubs. Â»The more actual con
tact of men with large affairs, their clos
er relation to political life, or to the men
who lead and direct political life, gives
to their conversation upon such subjects
an accent of reality, a ring of first-hand
knowledge, or of Immediate, first-hand
impressions, which It Is very helpful for
women to set.
To the degree to which the club has
tended- to separate women from men so
cially, to that degree is its effect inju
rious. Temporarily It may be' that this
deplorable condition' is a necessity. I be
lieve that a separate social world has
been as necessary; as affording an oppor
tunity for women ito develop independent
opinion? and unrestrained expression of
them, -as the separate club life or the sep
arate college life has been; that all three
â the separate club, Â¦ the separate college
and' the exclusively feminine social func
tionâmark a temporary condition and are
so many departments of one large train
ing school in. which women are being fit
ted* to take their places as 'equals beside
men, but I deprecate the continuance of
this separation beyond the accomplish
ment of its full aims. " .. ' â¢ ",. '
Neither nor women can ever be
sufficient to themselves. It is the order
of nature that each shall seek comple
tion through the other.' This is no-more
a fact on the physical plane than on the
intellectual and social planes. All Influ
ences that tend toward giving a sense of
self-sufficiency, socially, to either sex is
deteriorating to society. It -is a matter
of frequent remark that manners â¢ are de->
teriorating.' And it is certainly matter of
observation, to any ".one. who observes,
that easy tamiliarity has' to a great de
gree replaced the deference and dignity
which formerly, characterized the highest
standards. Camaraderie â the capacity to
meet men without consciousness of sex â
is a factor in any ideal society; but it is
quite impossible that this capacity shall
be developed in a society where women
meet so seldom w.th men; excepting with
those who belong' to their own families or
their most intimate circle.
Socialistic . Tendency of the Club.
I believe that the doctrine of socialism,
which it seems to me clear is of the.es
sence of Christianity, is destined to grow
and to find its ample and legitimate appli
cation. Through their worn in clubs the
women who theoretically deny and reject
socialism have done much to hasten its
arrival and prepare its welcome. This,
to my mind, is good; but a consciousness
of what they are doing would enable mem
to escape some of its attendant injurious
effects. Perhaps such a consciousness re
quires for its- awakening the influence of
independent study and solitary thought.
One often hears this question, What will
be the outcome of the club movement?
The field of prophecy is beset by difficul
ties. 1 do not care to enter it. What has
been the outcome up to date, both good
and bad, I. have tried to show. This, like
all other movements, will probably pass
into trie next phase, leaving no definite,
measurable results, and chiefly valuable
as leading to the next step. What. the
next phase of sociological expression will
be I am not bold enough to try to state;
but, without professing to be a discerner
of times.-'it is. easy- toÂ»seq-;that ail the
signs point,, to an expansion of socialism;
one may not "Bay to" the introduction of
socialism, because socialism already has
large expression in many of our institu
tions. I believe that, one element in the
preparation of society for the wider ap
plication of . socialistic principles is the
club movement. . one evil effect of which
is the expansion and the weakening of
ties. I do not believe that the multiplica
tion of ties necessarily leads to the weak
ening of. any of them; but it naturally
does this unless there is an open recogni
tion of the tendency and a steady effort
of will applied under 'the spur of con
science to, withstand the tendency.
Limitations to Be Recognized, j
âDo I counsel abandoning -the club? No;
I desire not its abandonment but its de
velopment. The first condition of its wise
development is its recognition of its lim
itations, of its proper place, of its relation
to other social institutions. The club
should offer in its discussions examples of
accurate and elegant speech; it should be
the promoter of refined manners, the cre
ator of an exacting standard of literary
criticism.. It should realize its functions
as a meahsjof relaxation, and, above all,
it should recognize itself, as aaneans, not
as 'an end. It should cease to exaggerate
its achievements: It should", bear 'in mind
that club women do not constitute a dis
tinct social or intellectual class; that club
women comprise women of every class, of
all degrees of literary taste, intellectual
capacity and social refinement. The club
should cease self-laudation/ It is no longer
so new that it needs to announce itself.
Club women should remember that the
expression of self-consciousness Is as dan
gerous In an institution as in an individ
ual.' The effect of exaggeration of one's
own claims is to reduce public respect for
them. Â» Were the club so set apart from
aiy other social institutions as many of
its members affect to suppose it. it would
indeed be of trifling value, for only in pro
portion as one institution is consciously
related to other existing institutions, and
only in the desrree to which each recojr
nizes relationship and the obligations im
posed . by relationship is any institution
of account in the entire community.

London Market.
NEW YORK, June 11. â The desultory move
ment of prices in to-day's stock market dem
onstrated the professional character into- which
1 !t has again relapsed. The volume of dealings
fell back near to the level' which was reached
previous to last week's spurt of speculative
activity. The diminished interest showed a
tendency to become congested In a few stocks.
The strength of these had some influence in
sustaining the general market, but this waned
in the latter part of the day. The opening
made a good show after strength under the
combined influence of favorable interpreta
tions of the Government crop report, published
after the close yesterday, and the rumors
which came thick from London that peace was
imminent in South Africa. The crop report
had the greater effect on account of the short
selling which has been done by the bears dur
ing the past week In expectation of a showing
of great deterioration in the crops. Notwith
standing the decline in condition of the winter
wheat crop during the month and the decrease
In acreage of â¢ the spring wheat crop experts
are able to figure a bumper crop on the Gov
ernment showing. The rains which have fallen
since the first of the month, which Is the date
of the Government's computation, were also
taken as an offsetting factor to the unfavorable
features of the report. The short covering
which developed yesterday afternoon was there
fore continued with energy this morning. There
was an attempt, nevertheless,- to distinguish in
detail the effects of the reports as bearing on
different stocks. The spring wheat grangers
were conspicuously strong, while the Missouri
and Kansas lines were held back. A sharp
raid carried Texas and Pacific down 2% from
the high point and Missouri Pacific itself fell
under last night. The whole market suffered
from realizing until the aggressive movement
In Missouri Pacific checked the decline. There
was a rumor that the company's bonds, which
have -the options of exchange Into stock and
which pay 5 per cent, are to have the .option
exercised In their behalf. The pressure on
Texas and Pacific was attributed to a change
In the ratio of its proposed exchange with
Missouri Pacific, which has been supposed
hitherto to be two shares for one of Missouri
Pacific. The Mexican Central issues were
largely dealt In In connection with a report
of a refunding plan which would bring the
stock nearer to dividend claims. The appear
ance of controlling Standard Oil Interests in
the directorate of the American Linseed Oil
Company was responsible for- the strength of
those stocks and of National Lead, which, it
Is said, will benefit from the change. A num
ber of those high-priced specialties, such as
Sugar, Amalgamated Copper and American To
bacco, fluctuated feverishly under the Influ
ence of what teemed purely speculative opera
tions. There were come sharp advances In less
prominent specialties, which were unexplained.
Including American Express. North American.
General Electric, Virginia-Carolina Chemical
and others, in which the gains ran from 1 to
7 points.
The money market was free from disturb
ance, but reports of a transfer of several mil
lion dollars in currency to Philadelphia, In
connection with the steel consolidations, was
an Influence on sentiment. The gelling pres
sure gained force at least and the closing was
heavy at about the lowest and generally be
low last night, declines from the top ranging
from 1 to 4 points In the principal active stocks.
The sale of 1C0 chares of Northwestern pre
ferred was made at 13 points lower than the 1
preceding sale.
The demand for bonds was well distributed
end prices advanced. Total Fales. $3,975,000;
United States bonds were all unchanged on :

Weather Report.
San Joaquin Valleyâ The weather has been
cl*sr, with warm days an<i cool nights, and
vÂ«ry favorable for the developing and maturing
cf the grain crop. High north winds occurred
in some localities, but d!d no damage. Haying
is nearly ccmplf-ted, and a large crop of good
quality has bc*-n stacked. Grain harvest has
<-r,rr.meÂ«ce-<3 in some localities, and the yield
hats be*n very satisfactory. The cutting wjll
be gÂ«nral in about a week. Some grain fleJds
r.f-ar Corcoran which were flooded by the levees
lireaking will probably be a total loss. Decidu
ous fruits and vines are making fine progress.
F'lire peaches, apricrtB and berries are being
marketed, and canneries will commence work
rext week. Water iÂ« plentiful. Green feed Is
abundant, and all kinds of ctock are looking
treU.
Southern California â The weather has con
tinued cool and cloudy or fogg-y nlghtn and
morning*, ivith moderately high temperature
during the days. Conditions have been favor
sMe for citrus fruits, grain and 'sugar beets,
V>ut somewhat detrimental tr> deciduous fruits
and hay. The Hessian fly pest has quite seri
ously damaged wheat In portions of the San
Oabnel valley, in ether sections grain con
tinues in good condition and will yipld a fair
crop in many places. Haying is progressinc
Â»!owly, and the yield la not as good as ex-
I^cte<l. much of the crop ha.ving been damaged
by late- rains. Beets nnd beans are doing well.
Walnuts erÂ«? thrifty and will be equal to the
average. Grapes are in good condition.
Los Angeles Summaryâ Cool, cloudy mornings
rnd fair afternoons continue, though a few
v.-arm days in the interior caused citrus trees
f;nd fruit to grow rapidly. Grain harvest and
haying continue; yield good. Grapes are doing
veil.
Eureka Summaryâ Unseasonably cool, with
fresh northerly wind nearly all week. Warm
weather is much needed to promote the growth
of Eraln. vegetables and fruit. Haying is
progressing slowly: yield good.
Coast and Bay Sectionsâ Warm days and
cool nights during the week have been
favorable for crops, though somewhat
retarding the ripening of deciduous fruits.
Grain has ripened repldly. and harvest has
commenced in some sections. At NIpomo. Ean
Luis Obispa County, where heading is now in
-2>rogress. the grain is reported heavy and
Flump. Reports from all grain districts indi
cate that unusually large crops of wheat, bar
ley and oats will be harvested. Haying is
nearly completed: th* largest crop Â«>ver raised
Jn San Benito County is being harvested. In
Alameda County the hay crop is heavy and free
Irom rust. Grapes and deciduous fruits are In
pood condition, but will probably yield less than
The average in many places. Apricots, pears
an<5 prunes are reported full cropn in the vicin
ity of Xiles. Corn, sugar beets, hops and beans
are thrifty.
Sacramento Valleyâ The temperature has
continued slightly below normal during
moFt of the week, and conditions have
been generally favorable for grain and
hay. Dry northerly winds caused f- light dam
age to wheat and barley In some sections.
Prospects are etfll good for large grain crops
in ail tarts of the valley. A heavy crop of
bay is being harvested; the quality is excellentr
Hope are making- vigorous growth and will
rrobably yield a large crop. New potatoes of
excellent quality are In market; and garden
1 roducts are plentiful. Green feed needs rain,
but ie Ftill abundant In some sections. Decidu
ous fruits and gxapes are In good condition, but
Â»re not maturing rapidly, owing to cool
weather. Citrus fruits are thrifty.
Deciduous fruits are somewhat backward in a
few localities, owins to the continued cool
.veatlier, but are in excellent condition. There
v ill be nearly an average yield of most varie
ties except in a few places. Peaches, however,
are reported below average. Grapes, walnuts
and citrus fruits are thrifty. Irrigation water
is plentiful.
Grain has matured, rapidly, and harvest Is
progressing In portions of the great valleys
and in the Coast and Bay sections. Wheat Is
said to be unusually plump and heavy in many
places, and the outlook is good for an average
crop In most sections north cf the Tehachapi.
A fair crop will also be harvested In portions
cf Southern California, Bar.ey. rye and oats
are looking well, and good crops will be har
verted. The hay crop is nearly all harvested,
tnd baling is in progress; there has been a
heavy yield, excellent In quality. Sugar beets,
heps, beans, corn and garden products are all
doing well and will yield good crops.
The weather lias been generally fai-orable
for the grain and hay crops during the week,
but somewhat too cool for rapid maturing of
deciduous fruits in Borne localities. The nights
and mornings have been cool, cloudy and foggy
in many places, followed by clear, warm days.
Dry northerly winds have prevailed In some
Eecticns, but have caused very little damage
to crops.
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and crop section of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
The Weather and Crops.
"Future evaporated apples continue to ad
vance, holders now asking 8c for prime and
a Eale .being reported at 7%c. Future waste
Is very strong, l%c being bid and 2c asked.
Ppot prime apples are higher, a bid of 6Hc be
ing made, with holders asking 6%c. Spot
waste Is scarce and wanted. Sales are re
ported at l'4c, with buyers freely offering
that quotation for further lots. Holders
EEk 1%C."
"The features of this market are the extra
ordinary strength displayed both by currants
and evaporated apples. Outside of these two
erticles there is little or nothing of any im
portance doing.
"Currants were less active yesterday than on
the two pervious days, but there is still quite
a Rood Inquiry for round lots. The largest sale
actually reported was of 50 barrels of good
Amalias at 9%c. A bid of 9 lie was made for
200 barrels of the came grade, to arrive, holders
asking He higher. Negotiations were still on
late In the day.
Mail advices from New York say
Dried Fruits in New York.
The London Grocers" Gazette of May 25 says:
California fruits on the spot meet a moderate
demand at slightly firmer prices. The position
regarding the proposed Impost of 7s per cwt. on
tinned apricots is unchanged. So far no reply
has been received from the Government to the
protest forwarded on behalf of the trade last
week. Meanwhile the lot of those who bought
to arrive and whose goods had not been un
loaded or had not arrived before the Imposi
tion of the tax is a peculiarly unhappy one, as
the price at which they purchased was above
that now ruling on the. spot, and in addition
to this loss, they are called upon to bear the
duty at the excessive rate of 7s per cwt. on the
total net weight of the fruit and syrup.
Canned Apricots in London.
The situation in tree fruits remains about as
before.' ..Apples, Pears, Plums and Peaches are
In heavy : supply : and there"- Is' no '.Â¦ scarcity '.In
Apricots. The few Cherries. left continue to sell
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
" The finer grades of Butter continue firm and
in demand, but the medium and lower grades
are dragging. There are now no orders of any
consequence on the market. ; }:f*

Flour and Millstuffs.
WHEATâ Liverpool was lower. Chicago
opened easier on lower cables, and the de
mand was light and chiefly to fill shorts.
The Government report was about as expect
ed, and produced little." effect. There were
further showers In the Northwest and fa^
vorable conditions for the growing crop
everywhere. There was pressure to sell July
wheat through brokers and long wheat 'came
out on stop orders. It seemed as If some
body had wheat to sell on every hard spot.
Minneapolis wired that Monday's break
brought good acceptances of Flour from for
eigners. Bradstreet's reported a decrease in
stocks east of the Rockies of 1,499,000 bush
els, and a decrease In - Europe and afloat of
2,100,000, making a total decrease of 3,599,000

CHICAGO. June 11.â Superficially the figures

condition to please the bulls, but a compari
son seeme.l ij convince both bulls and bears
that there wruKl be more wheat In the coun^
try than voukV tell around 70c,- and conse
quently the f>i>-oi the gong found a host
anxious to sell. July opened %@%c lower at
72U@72%c. and with the downward course,
assisted by g-ne-.ii rains in the Northwest and
Southwest, the price declined, with occasional
fractional reactiir.s to 71 1 ,&c. The close was
weak and lUc lower at 71Vic.
Improved corn weather and the weakness of
wheat, together with liberal receipts and a
poor shipping demand, was the bearish com
bination in the corn pit. July closed %@%c
lower at 42%c. The only demand was from
the "pit shorts and this was light.
Oats were weaker with the other cereals.
July closed iic lower at 27%c. . . â¢

TRY TO SAVE HER LAND
"I" was on this island six weeks, sub
sisting during- the whole time on raw
shellfish. I suffered greatly from hunger
and cold, as the weather was very severe,
storming nearly all the time I was there.
I was finally rescued by a party of Atka
Island natives who were on a hunting
trip." .
"I had no matches, so consequently
could get no fire. I had a gun but no
ammunition, having lost it in the capsiz
ing of the boat, so that I could not kill
any of the seabirds or seals on the island.
I managed after a hard struggle to get
my boat far enough up on the beach to
be out of the way of the tide and I
spread a piece of canvas over her. This
sheltered me from the wind.
"When I landed I was unable to stand
for some time from cold and exhaustion.
When I gained consciousness I found I
was on an uninhabited island, devoid of
wood or any kind of shelter.
'/The vessel drifted toward this island
and when in a few fathoms of water I
let go a small anchor that I had still left
on board, but that would not hold her.
She kept drifting until I finally got my
boat into the water and ran a line to a
rock and made her fast to that. The line
soon parted and the vessel went ashore
on a reef and commenced breaking up. I
then started for the shore. It was quite
rough, my boat capsized and I came very
near drowning. My dog swam to me and
towed me onto the beach.
When the schooner went adrift' there
-was no one on board save the captain and
his dog. The steering- gear was out of
order and the schooner covered a distance
of over 500 miles before she brought up
near the island of Kagataska, one of the
Aleutian group. Seymore tells, this story
of his hardships:

The most important matter brought up at
the convention was the adoption of a measure
for the immediate raising of a fund.- eo that
the present treasury fund of the association
might be Increased to $500,000. The raising of
this amount of money for the protection of

realization of such a defense fund.

Point "Richmond was swept to-night .by
a. flre In which the ten-months-old .baby
girl of Mr. and Mrs. ? J. Simon was burned
to death, seven buildings " destroyed and
one volunteer fire-fighter so seriously hurt
that fatal results may follow. â¢
The injured man is Chris Chrlstensen,
employed by the San Pablo Gun Club. He
was crushed by falling timbers while pull
ing down a building to check the spread,
of the flames.
All that saved the business portion of
the -town from being wiped out was a
fortunate turn in the wind and the hard
work' of the gang of Santa Fe railroad
hands with a switch engine that pumped
many tank fulls of water on the flames.
The total loss is between $15,000 - and
$20,000, with some insurance.
The fire started at 8:30 o'clock from the
explosion of a lamp . or coal-oil stove in
the residence of J. Simon; above his large
general . merchandise store. Simon and
his > wife, were downstairs In- the store,
having left the baby asleep in a bedroom.
The explosion and the crackling of Barnes
alarmed them. , The father and mother
made a rush for the child, but were beat
en back by the fire, which swept the
building in a few minutes.
The flames spread so fast that there
was not a chance to savo a thing. \ Next
door was A. C. Lang's drug store, whioh
was wiped out. * Then the three small va
cant stores adjoining, owned by L. H.
Harley of Callstoga. were burned. 'â¢ - Â¦-
The flre fighters made a stand at Mrs.
R. McNally's Hotel Richmond, a large
two-story building of forty rooms. They
could not save it. It was owned by It. N.
Woods. â¢ Two smaller buildings, occupied,
as saloons by J. H. Borzone and,F. S.

POINT RICHMOND
SWEPT BY FIRE
We.- the jury, do find that thf cause of
death -was due to shock due to extensive burns,
resulting from Ignition of alcohol while said
deceased was being bathed therein by one W.
F. \ Hoffman, and we find that the death ot
said deceased was indirectly due to the culp
able carelessness of said Hoffman in setting
fire to alcohol drtpptngs upon the floor of tha
room wherein deceased was being bathed.
The jury found as follows:
Frank C. Ayers, a supervisor at the in
stitute, said he had often seen Hoffman
light alcohol on the floor. They had de
cided that was the best way to set rid of
the alcohol.
Joseph Gabrielll, a deaf mute pupil, was
in the room and saw the occurrence. He
testified: "I had my alcohol bath and was
dressing in the corner of the room when
Hoffman lit a match and threw it on tha
floor into the pool of alcohol. He put it
on the alcohol to see it burn. The towel
caught on fire when Hoffman put it on
Allen's body. Allen screamed, but was
told by Tabor to shut his mouth. I saw
Hoffman smoking a cigarette. He was
smoking when I came Into the room, and
he threw the cigarette out of the win
dow.*'
Jury Censures Hoffman.
Henry W. Tabor, a deaf mute super
visor, said: "I went Into the alcohol
room with Allen, after giving him a soap
bath in the adjoining room. There was
fire on the floor before Hoffman began to
spray the boy. "1 was going- to warn
Hoffman of the danger, but did not be
cause I supposed he knew his business.
When the boy. caught fire I helped to put
out the flames. There were burned
matches on the floor.".
Hoffman admitted that he smoked cigar
ettes, but could not remember whether ha
was smokinsr in the bathroom where the
alcohol was used. He said he and hla
fellow-fumigator, W. Berry. .. had made a
rule against smoking in that room.
Miss Mary Wiseman, a matron of the
Institute, related that Hoffman had told
her he had caused the flre by throwing a
match on the floor. She had seen Hoff
man smoking cigarettes several times
before the accident occurred.
Superintendent Wilkinson testified: "t
asked ' Hoffman why, in heaven's name,
he had lighted the match. He replied, 'I
don't know. It's only once in a hundred
times such an accident would occur.* "
Admits He Is a Smoker.
"After Allen was brought in," said Hoff
man, "I flicked at the lire on the floor to
put It out, and then sprayed the boy with
alcohol, wrapping the towel about hia
heau. The towel was afire and I did not
know it. Allen's scream was the first
warning. I had that he was burned. Then
I pulled oft my coat and put out the fire
on his body, at the same time calling: for
help."
Interest in the hearing- centered upon
the testimony of William F. Hoffman, tha
attendant, who 'had the boy in charge
when the accident occurred. Hoffman said
he had purposely ignited a pool of alcohol
on the stone floor of the basement bath
room to destroy the drippings becausa
pupils at the institute had been playing
wiih the Inflammable stuff. A few day*
before th% accident occurred a boy named
Jacobs had burned his hand by scooping
up alcohol and lighting it.

Judge R. H.~ Lovett of Peoria, the only

withdrawal. This makes the re-election of
Major Northcott a certainty. ;
A motion for the appointment of a com
mittee of ten to revise the ritual to re
ceive the same compensation as delegates
was voted down and a substitute carried
providing for the appointment of a com
mittee consisting of delegates to. receive
no extra compensation.
Other official reports submitted were
those of the board of i directors,' hea-1
banker, medical department, general at
torney, â¢ board of auditors, appeals and
grievances committees, committee on
ritual and editor of official paper.
The receipts of the society from all
sources during the term aggregated
$8,635,930. . Â».-â¢-â¢-
The report of Major C. W. Hawes, grand
secretary, shows that up -to June 1, the
society had paid a total of 11,340. death
claims, the aggregate disbursement for
such purpose being $22,000,000.
i Welcomes and responses and prelimi
nary routine in -the appointment of com
mittees took up the morning session. Gov
ernor Van Sant of Minnesota, Lieutenant
Governor Northcott of Illinois, Mayor
Smith of St. Paul, and others participated
in the opening greetings. The reports
show a net gain of 211,370 in new members
since the meeting of two years ago. >
S In his opening address General North
cott said: "This rapid growth has never
been equaled by any fraternal society or
life insurance in the world's history. We
have 630,000 members and 9700 local lodges.
We are maintaining insurance on lives of
members to-day in the aggregate sum of
$1,025,000,000 and we have . more policy
holders than the largest regular life in
surance company lit the United States." '
A resolution admitting Indians to mem
bership in the order was offered by dele
gates from Oklahoma and referred to the
proper- committee. .
, The question of admitting, Chicago and
five other large cities thlit are: now ex
cluded from membership in the order was
precipitated. by an amendment to the laws
committee, presented by Delegate Ale
shire, but a decision was not arrived, at.
This question took up most of the after
noon session and was fully discussed. J.
G. Johnson of Kansas led the opposition
and argued that if the larger cities were
admitted they would soon get the ma->
chinery of the order into their own hands
and could in a few years control its pol
icy. The matter was made a special or
der for 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, and
indications point to the defeat of the
proposition for admission. â¢- . . . .-
A resolution was adopted providing that
each State shall hereafter be entitled to a

WOODMEN WILL
REVISE RITUAL
Ben Brock told of being at C. W.
Prince's place of business shortly before
the shooting, and of Will Prince first
leaving and being followed closely by Bert
Prince r.nd h'Â« father.
On cross-examination a letter written
by the witness to the defendant in June,
1900, was introduced. Prince was asked
what he meant when he wrote that he
was worried over Lulu's conduct. He
said it was because she 'was sad and dis
pirited. He did not know that she was
poing with Cass Patten, the baseball
r'ayor, at that time. He denied that the
pi&tol with which Mrs. Kennedy did' the
shooting: belonged to him.
Prince testified to leaving his father's
place of business at 5:20 and going to the
Ridge building, where, attracted by a.
woman's screams, he Â¦went to the second
flcor and saw a man choking his sister.
H<- had thought the man was Philip Ken
nedy, but found he was the latter's broth
er, and left the scene.
The State tried to show that Prince left
home with his sister on the afternoon of
the murder, furnishing her with a re
volver en route, and instructing her in
what ehc should do when she went to her
husband's office.
"Was Worried Over His Sister.
W. A. Prince then took the stand. Ac
cording to a theory of the prosecution he
is a professional mesmerist, and in nerv
ing his sister up to commit the murder of
Kennedy exercised his hypnotic power
over her. Prince denied that he was a
rr;esrr;erist. or that he ever mesmerized a
person. He detailed his whereabouts on
the day of the murder and denied having
accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to town a few
Lours before the murder.
Through T. J. Noble the defense en
deavored to prove that the time of the
murder, as set by the State's witnesses,
was incorrect.
Defendant's Brother on Stand.
Thomas H. Ridge told of the scene in
the Ridge building at the time of the
murder. When the doctor 6aid Kennedy
was dead Mrs. Kennedy, stepping to the
j;rostrate form of her husband, kicked
him in the side of the head.
Mrs. Kennedy had taken particular care
in making her toilet to-Kiay, and she dis
played more interest than at any time
r-ir.ce the case opened. She scanned each
witness critically and listened eagerly to
the testimony. When Will Prince testi
tif-d in defense of his sister, Mrs. C. W.
Prince, the mother, burst into tears,
which broke forth afresh as he detailed
the different chapters in the affair.
Prince denied that he had ever exer
cised mesmeric powers over any one; de
nied that he accompanied his sister down
town on the day of the murder, and said
that the revolver used in the killing was
not his. He knew of the murder only
iifter it had been committed.
Will Prince was taken from his cell to
testify. His entrance into the court
ioom caused a buzz among the spectators,
who craned their necks to get a glimpse
of the man whom the State is trying to
prove was the chief actor in the alleged
conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The prisoner
brightened perceptibly at the entrance of
hÂ«r brother, whose testimony she fol
lowed closely. She appeared perfectly
well to-day.
Denies Ownership of Revolver Used.
The bulk of the testimony was brought
out in an attempt to prove an alibi for
Iiert and C. W. Prince, the brother and
father of the prisoner, whom the State
nad tried to prove were watching the en
trances to the Ridge building at the time
Â«f the murder to prevent Kennedy's es
cape. Although the defense tried to
irove that they had left the older
Prince'6 pool room after the shooting oc
curred, the time given by the witnesses
varied from 5:15 to 5:-I5. The shooting
took place at 5:40.
KANSAS CITY. June 1Lâ The defense
la the case of Lulu Prince-Kennedy, on
trial for killing her husband, was to-day

coffee: "A little over two years ago I
was on the verge of collapse superinduced
l>y the steady grind of the newspaper of-

pound sleep and the wakeful nights were
followed by despondency and a general

Secretary of Treasury Bequests Col-
lector to Hold Him Pending
Investigation.
Su Shlh Chin, gentleman, ' scholar . and
adherent of the deposed Kwang Hsu, re
mains In custody in the detention' shed on
the Mail dock, pending a decision by the
Secretary of the Treasury as to his right
to land. . â¢Â¦ .. â¢ _
Customs Collector Stratton received yes
terday a dispatch from the Treasury De
partment requesting him to hold Mr. Su
until further orders, and in the meantime
to transmit to the Secretary of the Treas
ury all the papers in the case, together
with the recommendation of the Collector.
The Collector has already recommended
that Mr. Su be allowed to land, as not be
longing to the classes of Chinese debarred
by the exclusion act.
Minister Wu and Consul General Ho
Yow are making strenuous efforts to pre
vent the landing of Mr. Su, who,' they say,
is one of the leaders of the reform or
Kwang Hsu party in China, and whose
mission here is to raise funds for the rev
olutionary movement at home. The re
form movement has many thousands of
adherents on the Pacific Coast, and in this
city it has an organ, the World, published
In. the Chinese quarter. , - Â¦
It is expected that Mr. Su's fate will be
decided in a few days. Should he be or

the protection of the British flag he will
be as safe in that port as he would be in

Phelan Not a Candidate.
Â¦Word was given out by a prominent
Democrat yesterday that Mayor Phelan
had finally made up his mind to decline
a renomination. On this point the Mayor's
mind had been wavering for several
weeks. When he did resolve not:to.be

Mayor that nothing would induce him to
run again. Â» - - *
Politicians who are foremost In direct-'
ing the party combinations speak of
Raphael Weill as an available man to
succeed Phelan - in . the Mayor's chair.
Mr. Weill is widely known as a progres
sive, up-to-date merchant and a man fa
miliar with the administrative methods
of large affairs. He served creditably on
the Board of Education. He is a straight
out Democrat, who has never faltered in
his allegiance to the party. â¢

Jasper McDonald has admiring support

the subject of putting him forward as a
candidate for Mayor is presented.

The managers of the Democratic party
in San Francisco, at a caucus held recent
ly, decided in favor of a big convention.
Precinct representation will be recognized
to the fullest extent. If apportionment
will permit every precinct will have a
delegate In the convention. Arthe pri
mary election of 1899, under the Stratton
law, the precincts for voting purposes
were consolidated to lessen the cost of
conducting the election. .The precincts :
are to be consolidated in the same way
for the coming election. It is understood
that the Election Commissioners will use
the form adopted in 1899, although there
may . be some changes in the polling
places. The apportionment of delegates,
however, will not be made on consolidated
precincts. . but on the regular precinct
subdivisions of the city. Â¦<". - :

Democratic Managers Active.
Headquarters of the Republican Pri
mary League of San Francisco, opened in
the Baldwin Annex yesterday, will be
open every day from 9 a. m. until 11 p. m.
The first duty devolving upon the league
is to awaken interest in the approaching
primary election. To this end district or
ganization will be effected as soon as the
organizers of the league can obtain the
views of the leading Republican citizens
in the several districts of the city. The
Republicans possess sufficient Btrength to
control affairs of the local government.
All that is required to assure triumph is
harmony; of action on the general prln
piple of ignoring bosses and factional agi
tation in favor of anxious candidates. The
right of citizens to aspire to olflce Is not
questioned, but personal inclination In this
respect should give way to the higher pur
pose of uniting all the reform forces of
the party in the common cause of win
ning a victory for good local government.
The best service that can be rendered
by the recently incorporated Republican
Primary League is to put forward in each
district a- ticket of representative men to
be voted for at the August primary. The
names proposed for the nominating con
vention should represent the workingmen,
business men and professional men. When
representative men are mentioned the
false notion may be entertained that only
men of great wealth or recognized emi
nence in manufacturing, mercantile and
professional pursuits are considered. The
notion is wrong. Delegates proposed
should represent the small taxpayers as
well as the big holders of real estate. The
mechanic owning his own home In the dis
trict stands on the same footing, as the
rich banker. The workers and taxpayers
who contribute the means to maintain the
local government should be the men to
make the nominations. The boss idea is
that the officeholders, clerks, deputies and
all others on the municipal payroll who
derive a living- from the money raised to
support the government should control
the nominations.

VSir" Harry . Westwood Cooper, alias
Ernest Moore Chadwick," surprised every
one in Judge Cook's courtroom yesterday
morning by frankly admitting that he had
forged the telegram sent to Norine
Schneider, for which offense ' he is being
tried; but in his overmastering conceit
he added that he committed the offense
through prearrangement with the girl,
.who was madly in love â¢ with him and
wanted something to show her sister and
friends before going with him to get mar
ried. â¢.' The, 1 girl and her mother, who sat
in the" courtroom | facing Â¦ him, were so
shocked by the statement that they vis
ibly protested, which ' drew forth , a re
mark from the defendant's attorney ask
ing, the court' to notify them to comport
themselves properly.
Cooper was the star witness of the day.
He commenced by admitting that he was
In 'this city in 1897 with Ida Maude Cam
paign,. but said he, had never Â¦ been â¢ mar
ried^ to her. In cross-examination, when
shown the ! certificate of marriage with
the girl in Canada- on May 24, 1S97, he .said
Â¦with *the.. coolest effrontery that he had
induced' a young, man to forge the names
to the certificate and that he had pur
chased the blank- certificate from a sta
tioner's store in Toronto, Canada. It took
the young, man Â¦ only ten minutes to fill
out â¢* the certificate and forge the names.
The certificate was -given by him to Cap
tain Seymour, at the time of his arrest
in 1897,' and; in' explanation of havlng.it
with him , he said* it was for the protec
tion of the young girl. Â¦ He admitted hav
ing spoken of her as his wife, but never
Introduced her as such. . â¢ . Â»
Several witnesses were then called -for
the defense, to testify as to. Mrs: Schneid
er speaking of her daughter Norine as the
intended bride of Cooper, but the evidence
was not admitted. : -
Coo'per. was. again- called to- the stand
and told of having arranged with Norine
Schneider on , the night.of February 22 to
send her ; the forged telegram next day,
when he and her mother went, to the city,
so that she could, have a pretext for leav
ing with, him to get' married, as < she was
in love with 'him and did Â¦ not care wheth
er he had, money, or not. He made other
statements contradicting the evidence of
the Scheniders' as to making arrange
ments and purchases . f or Â¦â the* wedding,
which had been fixed for. Sunday, Feb
ruarys 24,; but was postponed by MrsJ
Schneider. '.**.' V Â¦. .Â¦ â¢
In i cross-examination he admitted that
he had. been convicted of. a felony in this
city, â¢ but denied that he had been â¢ con
victed in ' Australia. - When asked * as to
.the ; forged Â¦Â¦ telegrams he . showed the Â¦ girl
when on the train for Ogden, purporting
to be from her mother, to the effect that
the. girl's brother had absconded,* he de
clined to answer^ any of the questions on
.that- point. A question : as to where â¢: he
was to. get ' the, $20,000 .which he .was to
settle upon; Norine was objected to by his
attarnftv.' and : tha ' objection was -sustained.

talnment.' The offer was that if the or
ganization would lend its name it would
get $500 whether the entertainment was a
success or a- failure and if the sale of
tickets reached a certain figure the or
ganization was to get a percentage on all
additional sales. The entertainment was
never given, however, but Mrs. Gregory
has been more successful. The directors
of the home have left the entire manage
ment of the coming benefit in her hands
and they have confidence she will make a
success of it. Mrs. Gregory had a similar
contract for a i recent benefit entertain
ment in Oakland, but the venture did not
prove much of a success."
Â¦ The plan is an alluring one, for it brings
results without the usual attending work
in the arrangement of details by those
who do not understand such things and
It may. lead to a series of ready-made en
tertainments, all for.charity and all run
under a percentage system. The scheme
has its limit in the patience of the mer
chants, however, and when they call a
halt some new plan will have to be
adopted.
The feature of the entertainment to be
given on the 28th will be the full minstrel
performance by- the Army and Navy
Minstrels. There will ' also be several
numbers by juvenile professionals.
COOPER FRANKLY
ADMITS FORGERY
IMPEOVZMENT CLUBS
OPPOSE HIGH BUILDINGS
Will Call Mass Meeting for Purpose
of Interesting People in the
Fight.
The Federation of Western Addition
Improvement Clubs held a meeting last
night at Saratoga Hall for the purpose
of taking .action in regard to the proposal
on the part of the Supervisors to rescind
the ordinance placing a limit on the
height to which buildings may be con
structed. The improvement clubs of the
Western Addition, under the leadership
cf Charles Alpers, have been making
an energetic crusade against the con
struction of tall buildings. It was decided
last night to call a mass meeting for Fri
day night for the purpose of interesting
the public in the fight.
Supervisor Curtis, who was present at
the invitation of the federation to deliver
an address, took exception to some impu
tations which were cast on the Board of
Supervisors, and entered into an earnest
defense of that body. He pointed out
that in this year's budget liberal provis
ion had been made for the improvement
of streets, especially Polk and Bush
etreets, in the Western Addition; for the
construction of schools and fire houses,
and for the better lighting of the city.
After he concluded his address he was
asked many questions by the members of
the club concerning the municipal gov
ernment under the new charter.
The federation completed the adoption
of its by-laws, and elected H. V. More
house of the Hayes Valley Improvement
Club third vice-president. An executive
committee was appointed, consisting of
Robert Day Larkin. Street Improvement
Club: A. J. Schohay. the Hayes Valley
Improvement Club; Martin Hink. the
Polk Street Improvement Club, and F. W.
Meyers of the Devisadero Street Improve
ment Club. President O. K. Cushing. Sec
ond Vice-President X. B. Greenfelder.
Secretary Emanuel A. Lorenzo, Treasurer
A. G. Klinert and the third vice-president
are also members of this committee.
Prudent housewives will lay In a large
supply of meat before 10 o'clock this morn
ing, as that is the hour the Journeymen
butchers have set to go out on strike. The
whole question of the strike may be sum
marized as "no union cards, no meat."
Some weeks ago demands were submit
ted to all retailers, asking that certain
concessions and certain hours of labor be
granted the journeymen. It wa3 left op
tional with the proprietors to display the
union card, so long as the other demands
were granted. With a few minor excep
tions the men received all they asked.
Since the concessions were granted the
wholesale butchers decided that no meat
would be supplied to shops displaying the
union card. This has apparently angered
the journeymen and at a meeting held last
night at the Turk-street Temple it was
decided to walk out at 10 o'clock this
morning. A protracted debate preceded
the action taken. ,
The hall was filled with over 1000 work
ing . butchers. They represented all
branches of the trade, and debate waxed
warm throughout the night. Finally, by
a unanimous vote, it was decided that in
every butcher shop, slaughter-house, sau
sage factory or place where meat is sold
or handled, the proprietors should be com
pelled to sign the union agreement or dis
play the union card before 10 o'clock this
morning. Non-compliance with this fiat
will result in a general walkout at the
hour appointed.
A few of the shops will remain open, as
it has been the practice of these employ
ers to demand a twenty-four-hour notice
from employes before quitting. Some of
the men thus obligated declared their in
tention of remaining with their employers
until this time limit had expired.
All Day Meeting of Union.
Shortly after .the hour appointed the
journeymen butchers will assemble at the
Turk-street Temple and remain in session
throughout the day. President Benjamin
Davis is now confined I to : his home, . 1627
Polk street, with a broken kneecap and
during his retirement the affairs of the
union will be managed by Fred Sanderson,
walking delegate and business manager,
with the assistance of Secretary Herman
May.
Several conferences were held yesterday
by the wholesale butchers, who have been
fully advised of the present conditions.
They have determined that the retailer will
have to wait for his stock, if the demands
of the Journeymen are acceded to, and
when present stocks are exhausted, it is
not Improbable that strike rations of ba
con and beans and 'ham and eggs will
comprise the bills of fare in many fami
lies. As the poultry pickers are also union
ized, they are likely to go out in symr
pathy with the butchers.
According to President McCabe of the
Iron Trades Council there are nearly 5000
iron workers on strikeâ practically all
that are in the city. Of the iron molders,
the last to go out, there are 350. The re
mainder of the strikers are machinists,
riveters, shipfltters, coremakers, steam
fitters, blacksmiths, pattern-makers
and the helpers and apprentices In these
branches.
Great expectations are. based upon the
financial results of the ball to be given at
the Mechanics' Pavilion on the night of
June 22 by the Teamsters' Union. The
proceeds will be devoted to the fund for
the support of the striking machinists.
Every union in the city is buying tickets
up to the full limit of its treasury â¢ capa
city. . â¢ ,
Leaders handling the executive ends of
the strike of the ironworkers anxiously
awaited information yesterday from New
York, where a meeting of the representa
tiv es of the iron industry was held.
As no information had been received up
to 8 o'clock the headquarters were closed
at that hour. Upon the action of the
meeting in New York } future action of
the local ironworkers ' largely depends.
No action will be taken until advices are
received from the International Associa
tion of Machinists.
The Longshore Lumbermen's Protective
Association will hold the annual reunion
and picnic at Shell Mound Park on Sun
day. ' >
The Amalgamated Woodworkers re

applications from six more. Strike bene

out of positions by the strike of the iron
workers. â¢
directors, of the University
I Mound Old Ladies' Home will give
la benefit entertainment In Native
JJL Sons' Hall on the evening of June
2S that, aside from the excellence
of the programme, will be a feature in lo
cal entertainments, for It will mark the
introduction into this city of what ia
known, In the East as "listing the town."
It means that the entertainment has been
planned and arranged for by a lady who
makes a business of such entertainments
and that all the directors of the home will
have to do will be to gather in the money
that will surely flow into the box office.
The lady getting up the entertainment is
Mrs. K. C. Gregory. She has arranged
the programme, secured the talent, hired
the hall and is now covering the city with
tickets as fast as she is able and with a
success that promises a golden harvest.
The tickets are sold by girls employed
for that purpose. A small advertisement
in the papers on Sunday morning brought
a score or more of prepossessing young
ladies to the California Hotel, where they
were examined and some were engaged.
The advertisement called for "two bright,
well dressed ladies" and it was not hard
to pick those needed from the number
that answered. The employment offered
was said to be "remunerative" and the
hours were from 10 to 12 and from 2 to 4.
The work was to sell tickets for the en
tertainment on the 2Sth.
There are nine young ladies- selling: the

TRENCHING FEES
TO BE REDUCED
Board of Works Will
Amend an Obnox
ious Law.
City Engineer Gninsky Will
Have Two Additional
, Assistants.
The Board of Public Works has con
cluded to recede In Its position of Impos
ing a. fee on every piece of trenching: work
done by the water, heat, light and power
corporations. The board decided yester
day to submit to the Board of Super
visors, with a recommendation for its
adoption, an amendment to the trenching
ordinance recently passed, which will pro
vide for the payment of $175 per month to
the city by corporations who engage in
continuous operations in the opening of
streets for conduit or pipe service.
One of the big corporations figured that
under the ordinance now in force It will
be compelled to pay several thousand dol
lars monthly for the salaries of Inspectors
detailed to supervise trenching work. All
the corporations but one â the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company â rebelled at com
plying with what they regard as an un
just measure. They were preparing to
resist the ordinance in the courts, but the
decision of the Board of Works to have it
amended so as to impose a fair charge for
inspection will result in an amicable solu
tion of the dispute. The amendment pro
posed by the board follows:
Whenever any person or corporation shall
begin work which calls for extensive opening
of streets, and requires the services of one or
more inspectors for a period of one or more
months In continuous operation, the Board of
Public Works may, upon application of said
party and upon payment to the said board, in
advance for each month and for each inspector,
the sum of one hundred and seventy-five dol
lars ,$175.00), grant to said party a permit to
open streets, and shall detail the necessary
number of Inspectors, who shall supervise the
opening of trenches, and shall require the ful
fillment of trenching specifications prescribed
-v the City Enrineer.
The said monthly payments shall be In lieu
of the fees hereinbefore prescribed in this
ordinance, and no additional fees shall be ex
acted of said party.
Nctwlthstandlng the unfavorable criti
cism to which the Board of Public Works
has been subjected by improvement
clubs and taxpayers generally for its
waete of public funds .to pay salaries to a
host of subordinates, it has decided to al
low City Engineer Grunsky two additional
engineers. That official made a formal
application yesterday for authority to em
ploy two men. He grave as a reason that
the board was about to expend $60,000 to
repair a number of blocks in the downr
towr. districts and that as the work had
to be commenced in July his present force
was inadequate to prepare the plans and
specifications in time. The board agreed
with Grunsky's contention and $300 or $350
additional in salaries will be expended
monthly for the two assistants.
