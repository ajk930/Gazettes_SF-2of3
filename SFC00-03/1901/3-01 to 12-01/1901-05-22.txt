found it difficult to restrain the surplus

on their faces when It seemed that they
would miss seeing the great man showed

the burghers in that district. The total
strength of the Boers in that . district is
estimated at between 10,000 and 15.000.
There is an unconfirmed rumor that Gen
eral Christian Dewet is again in command
of the Boer invaders. British military of
ficials are cognizant of the movements of
the Boers, and are prepared for them.
BRUSSELS, May 21.â The Senate to-day,

when he rejoined McClellan, /moving
against Lee in Maryland. He commanded

river. t He continued in command of the
Fifth Corps in- the Federal movement to

12,' 1862 v /when:'he i was? relieved from his
fcommand" in'.'the'j presence of the enemy
and a few days.later placed under arrest.
This was on account of charges preferred
by General Pope. of. misconduct and cow
ardice .during Stonewall Jackson's flank
movement â¢ in ; the summer of 1862 around
Pope's army and the fighting leading up
to the second battle of Manassas.

ter and he was cashiered from the army.
Not till' sixteen years after, in 1878, when
the Comte de Paris, in his "History 'of
the War of the Rebellion," Had demon
strated that Porter was not In fault, and
Porter and his friends had made repeated
efforts to that end, was a court of inquiry
appointed to examine into the findings of
the court-martial and. report thereon.
This court, consisting of Generals Scho
fleld, Terry and Getty, completely vindi
cated the much-wronged Porter. General
Grant approved the finding and exerted
himself to have Porter reinstated in his'
rank in the army. A bill removing his
disabilities was passed after a fierce fight
in both houses of Congress, but was ve
toed by President Arthur. Another bill,
practically the same, was passed In 1886
and became a law. - He was restored to
his rank, but no provision was made for
his back -pay. He not long after retired,
after which he held the positions of Com
missioner of Public Works in New York
City, assistant receiver of the New Jersey
Central Railroad for several years and
then Police Commissioner of New York
City. ; On the expiration of his term In
the latter office he was appointed Fire
Commissioner, from which place he re
tired at the end of his term and did not
after "hold any public office. Â¦ In all his
military career General 1 Porter showed
himself to be a thoroughly capable, judi
cious, brave and successful soldier.

Great Benefits, of Education.
The- President" stood- up in his carriage
and spoke. --Frequent. interruptions of en
thusiastic applause punctuated : his i ad
dress. His speech'was as follows: .-Â¦ < : i. â¢Â¦.
I ' desire to - express the pleasure * which'
has been elven I to me to meet i with' the
45,000 school 'children . of Â¦ the 'â¢-. city of -'San
Francisco. It has given. me -an Introduction
Into the- countleES'homes of your. great city and
has permitted me to witnenB the sunshine -which'
this vast number of young people bring to the
firesides of the city.. I know of no richer pos
session than great scholarship, no nobler ambi
tion than to attain It. We cannot all be great
scholars.. but we can all have good scholarship.
Your State constitution early provided for a
greats public school-system', and- declared that
the diffusion of. knowledge and Intelligence was
Indispensable to. the Independence and liberties
of the people. You have 260,000 school children
in the public schools of the State of California,
and your State annually expends for your en
lightenment and equipment to â¢ perform â¢ the
great duties of life more than Blx millions of
dollars, and I want to assure you young people
that there is nothing so essential to your easy
advancement and success In after life as a good
education. .1 If those of us who have battled in
the rivalries and contentions of a busy world
could go back to our youth and our school days
we would embrace cheerfully our neglected op
portunities and pursue- them with industry and
delight. If the testimony of the active men of
San Francisco and of the country could be
taken it would be uniform In the declaration
of thÂ« embarrassments under which they -have
suffered from scanty mental training in youth.
Praises Our Schools and Universities.
You have In this city splendid public schools*
and you have denominational universities
everywhere throughout trie State, and then you
have the two great universitiesâ the Stanford
and the University of California. (Applause.)
No boy and no girl in the State of California has
any excuse for deficiency in the essentials 'and
.rudiments of education and practically the uni
versities are open to all; and I cannot speak of
the. universities without bringing to my mind
those two noble women whose munificent bene
factionsâMrs. Stanford (great applause) and
Mrs. Hearst (great applause)â have- done - so
much for * these great educational institutions.
â¢^Applause.) Â¦ Their magnificent gifts .will last
long after they are gone, and they will mold
and Influence the lives -of the boys and girls
of California for generations yet to Â¦ come. Â¦
Nothing has. given me more pleasure In my
long trip from the Atlantic v to the Paciflo than
the scene which, we have witnessed Â¦ here this
morning (applause), every child waving the
flagtof our faith and our hope and every little
heart Ailed with the love of country. (Great
applause.) What an army for liberty and union j
and civilization! (Great appleuse.) Why, we
have In the' public schools of the United States
four-fold more children than there were people
when this Government waa founded (applause),
and all of them proud of their country and all
of I them revering its institutions and all % of

Willing to Meet Manufacturers.
At the conference the committee of the
Metal Trades' Association will demand
that the men return to work and refer
the wage question to the board of arbitra
tion. Business Agent Constant Booth of
the machinists said to-night: . â¢ '
"There will be no arbitration. This mat
ter has gone too far for arbitration."
A statement was given out to-night by
the , executive board of the Machinists'
Association, in which they say: Â¦ . â¢Â¦ ,.
"We are willing to meet the manfactur
ers at any time and we are ready to come
to an understanding with them, provided
the nine-hour day without any reduction
of the per dieni rate be granted. The nine
hour day in the machinists' . trade . has
come at last and there Is nothing unfair
in our demand, as the employers have had
a year to prepare their contracts accord
ingly. We have certainly acted fairly in
waiting tl\at length of time. Regarding
the arbitration feature of the agreement
we can say that we have religiously ob
served that. Many violations' of that
agreement have occurred on the part of
the. members of the Metal Trades 'Asso
ciation and we v have Â¦ endeavored .both
through our local and national officers in
the various cities 'to have the aforesaid
violations taken up and arbitrated, but

"As far' as New York 'City lsjconcerned,

* It was announced that President O'Con
nelr- had sent word that the machinists
could appoint a conference committee.
-According to Devins, the purpose or the
Metal Trades' Association in asking for
the conference is to gain an opportunity
to lay before the machinists fairly the
r>tuation. Devlns says that there is' no
question that the machinists under exist
ing agreements are- entitled to a nine-hour
day. This the employers are willing to
concede. But the question' at the bottom
of the present difficulty is whether or not
ten hours' pay for nine hours' work is to
follow the introduction of th'e nine-hour
system. The members of . the Metal
Trades' Association say that there 4s not
a word about the wage system in the
agreement, and that under another clause
of that document, all such questions when
difficult to settle are to be decided by arbi
tration, the men remaining at work pend

little satisfaction. ' The men I said they

"Personally, I do not think our men

Speaks of Sending Work East.
Henry T. Scott, president and treasurer
of the Union Iron works, freely discussed
the etrike situation. He expressed, he
said, the views of' the executive commit
tee, which is looking after the interests
of the employers, who are ready and will
ing to hold a conference with the men
â¢who are employed by the Union - Iron
Works or other places affected. He re
gretted that the Etrike was on and said
the men would suffer more than the em
ployers, as in all Government . work a
Ftrike clause protected the latter. â¢
The Iron Molders met and discussed
their grievances last night at 1133 Mission
ctreet.
"We have been in conference all day,"
eald Secretary Wleler, "and the results
indicate a peaceful solution of the diffi
culty."
NO more* orderly body of men
seeking an adjudication of dif
ferences between themselves and
their employers could be found
than the ironworkers now out
on Etrike. They met at their headquar
ters at 323 Sixth street yesterday from
early morning till late at night. Condi
tions arising out of each shop were dis
cussed and while many of them talked
to others In their endeavor to make a
hasty settlement, no results were reached.
One feature of the strike that is of the
utmost importance is the action to be
taken by the Iron Molders. Those men
have been through a strike before and
while their sympathies are with their
brothers in the trade they may hesitate
to take definite action.
At the Potrero, where are located the
Union and Risdon Iron Works, the lead
ing shipbuilding plants on the Western
Coast, the sound of hammers was not
heard. At the Fulton Jron Works, in
the northern end of the peninsula, the
came quiet reigned. At noon time some
thirty or forty iron molders walked out,
leaving the work practically in the hands
of the apprentice bcyB. . "
At the Union Iron Works a paying tell
er disbursed the wage* coming to the
men who left on Monday morning. The
same plan of payment will be pursued
until each man has received his due. It
is said that the works, formerly employ
ing nearly 40W men, will be closed down
for an indefinite period until the differ
ences between employers and employes
are adjusted.
Looks for Peaceful Solution.
Secretary Wlsler, who represents the
International Association of Machinists,
stated that no shops had been unionized
during the day, although it was the hope
of the men concerned in the strike that
cuch a result might be obtained. 6o far
thirteen shops have agreed to the de
mands of the worklngmen.
BOSTON, May 21.â There was little

In Boston to-night. A telegram stating

manded was looked -upon as the most
significant development of the day. This
company, the Blake Pump Works Â¦Â¦ of
Cambridge- and the Davis Pump Works

machinists believe that as the Worthing

the same. .-'--.'.- Â¦ -..Â¦Â¦

No regularly declared strike of the iron
molders will : be inaugurated to-day. At
a meeting held last night the question as
to whether a strike should be declared in
sympathy with the machinists was ex
haustively discussed, but no definite 'ac
tion was taken. The meeting was finally
adjourned until to-night, when a larger
hall will be secured and the question tak
en up again. As yet no communication
has been received from the national body
of iron workers and without their sanc
tion the local body is prohibited from
striking. The iron molders who have
tjius far left their work have done so
on their own responsibility.
At the. meeting last night many vehe
ment speeches were delivered In favor of
an immediate strike, but on the other
hand the more conservative element ad
vised caution. A general feeling prevails
among the iron workers that the meeting
to-night will result in a general strike. It
is expected that the national body, will
declare its position to-day.
Those who are looking after the general
interests of labor are casting about, for
some disinterested individual to act as
arbitrator. Some names have been sug
gested and are now -under consideration.
Bishop William Ford Nichols of the Epis
copal church, Archbishop Hiordan of the
Catholic church and Bishop John W.
Hamilton of the Methodist Episcopal
church have been suggested as probable
mediators. In the scope of the plan out
lined by -the Building Trades Council it
is proposed to peacefully settle all differ
ences by arbitration. But as. there are so
many different features involved in the
of the problem now confronting
the labor movement it is very "difficult to
find one who will attempt to emulate the
example given by Bishop Potter of New
York.

"WASHINGTON. May 21.â The case of

Commerce Commission to-day. The case
has been pending in various ways for a
long time, and after a hearing: that closed
late this afternoon tne commission fixed
October 22, In this city, for the hearing of
arguments In the case. /
St. Louis and Chicago Shippers are try
ing to secure lower rates to the Pacific
Coast from the Middle West and to have
the roads reduce the difference between
carload rates and leas than carload rates
in the Pacific Coast business. Vice Presi

W. O. Herrin and Vice President Stubbx,

M. Johnson of St. Louis and J. F. Tomp
klns of Chicago represented the Business
Men's League, and E. S. Plllsbury the
Pacific Coast Jobbers.
Vice President Morton was the principal
witness to-day. While he knew many rail
road officials differed with his views, he
believed that the difference between the
carload and less than carload rates should
be decreased. The difference, he said, wa3
too great from the standpoint of both the
carrier and the small shipper.. He said
it did not cost the railroads to handle the
two quantities of goods an amount com
mensurate with the difference in rates. Ha
believed the difference should be basd on
the cost of handling. It was right that
this difference should be decreased, al
though he said it eight be Impracticable
to bring It about. Custom had brought
the present difference, and the action of
any individual road could not break the
practice. , .- - * -
Morton also favored graded rates on
transcontinental business as a fair and
equitable measure for both the carriers
and the shippers.' Vice President Stubba

GHICAGO, May 21.â If the plans of
Coroner Traeger do not fail the
courts of Illinois, and possibly the
Supreme Court of the United
States, will In the near future be
asked to pass upon an entirely new ques
tion In American jurisprudence, incident
ally upon the disposition of Dowie and
Dowlelsm. The problem whether the
State may protect its citizens against
folly by making medical attendance in
certain emergencies, particularly in con
nection with the birth of children, com
pulsory Is to be decided. After a long
conference with State Attorney Deneen
Coroner Traeger announced that he in

his efforts till everything possible had
been done to compel the high priest of
Zion to end his tralHc in Chicago.
Trouble for Dowie recently began by

PORTLAND, Ore., May 2Lâ General
William Kapus killed himself with a re
volver this morning during a fit* of ' tem
porary insanity. He was 66 years of age.
He -was prominent in. the affair of Ore
gon and "Washington Territory for many
years. In 1890 General Kapus was United
States Consul at Sydney, Australia. Dur
ing the Civil War he 'was mustering and
disbursing officer for Oregon and Wash
ington! and served in Montana . and Utah
as lieutenant of the Thirteenth Infantry.
General Ka.ous was a hale and hearty
man- fend, -up to a few -weeks ago,' had
never/been ill. He was seized with grippe
and, although the malady * had not kept
him from his duties appreciably," ; he] suf
fered/ considerably. Within the. past few
days! it had been noticed that , his mind
was fellghtly affected. .. Yesterday - he was
disposed â¢ to ." be very . melancholy. Last
Sunday he manifested marked symptoms
of derangement while. In the presence of
his family. .

Ingr.l about' 6:30 o'clock, . and while his

pressed by representatives of the press
for sanies and addresses he. persistently
refused to givf them and- wanted to fight.
He also: refused to make any statement
as to the ' amount and the - disposition
made of the money .'collected in his meet
ings. The Call and other papers continued
to "roast" him until his following fell off,
collections dropped to low tide and the
Impostor sought other fields for weak vic
tims.
After leaving ..Oakland he spent some
time in Salt Lake, and then proceeded to
Chicago,' where, dropping the "Eden"
scheme, he inaugurated the "Zion" move
ment; which has grown to very large pro
portions. He did not .leave California
empty-handed, however. From the sale
of photographs of himself and family, col
lections in his meetings Â«ind fees for so
called "healing," be had amassed a very
large sum of moneyâ just how much no
one on the outside knows. At any. rate,
he had the cash in hand to make large
purchases of real estate on Michigan ave
nue in Chicago and start in '.'business" on
a larger scale. The assessment rolls soon
after rated his holdings of real estate at
$251,000, which included the. Zion building
and the Zion City Bank and the land on
which they stood on Michigan avenue. He
had besides a farm in Michigan for which
he paid $10,000 cash. He had elegant car

presented by 300 Indians, under the guid
ance of Father Chlrouse of the ' Catholic
church,, who will ; oversee all arrange
ments. The priest was here to-day char
tering a special train : to take the Indians
and their effects to Chilliwack-next week.
One thousand will attend from the coast
tribes between here and Alaska, and . as
many will come - from Cariboo and the
Kootenays. They . -^#1 . have (a monster

place. The play will be entirely carried
out by the Indians, who for months have
been practicing for the work, and the
priest says they are now nearly perfect.

Moffatt and Gardner Are Matched
for the Middle-Weight
Championship.
The San Francisco Athletic . Club has
matched â¢ Jack Moffatt of Chicago' and
George Gardner, the top-notch middle
weights, to fight in this city on July. 4.
According to the plans of the club, the
fight will take place during the middle of
the day at the Sixteenth and i Folsoni
street grounds, and will be for the cham
pionship of the middle-weight class.
Gardner and Moffatt have met before.
In New York several years ago. Moffatt
broke his arm on Gardner, but-the-gen
eral verdict at that time was that Moffatt
had pretty much the best of it. Gard
ner has beaten George Byers twice and has
a long record to show for his fistic career.
The San Francisco Club is â¢ also trying
to secure a second match for the. same
day. This will be a preliminary between
the winner of the Matty Matthews and
Rube Fern match and Thurston.
OPEN-AIR FIGHT FOR Â¦
THE, FOURTH OF JITLY
ing of the directors of-the Chicago Board
of Trade to-day the Peavy elevator "B"
: was declared irregular pending an> inves
tigation of charges made by Slaighter.&
Co. to the effect that grain stored in the
elevator was not regular. The announce
ment caused a stir on the board, as the
action is said to be without precedent.
Following is the notice sent by Slaighter
' & Co. to Secretary Stone of the Board of
Trade:
"As the Peavy Grain Company cannot
or will not deliver No. 2 corn for which we
now hold loading orders, we hereby notify
you we will not receive as regular deliv
ery any wheat or corn in Peavy elevator
"B' on regular contracts made on the
Chicago Board of Tradei"
These charges are said to be the direct
result of the Phillips deal in May corn.
The Peavy Company, it is -said, tendered
to Phillips on delivery warehouse receipts
calling for 648,000 bushels of No. 2 corn.
Slaighter & Co. applied for this corn oh
loading orders from Phillips, but the grain
offered out of elevator "B". was refused
on the ground thai It was not up to con
tract grade. As a result of the directors'
action none of the 607,000 bushels of corn
in the elevator can be delivered and there
fora excitement was fomented in May
corn. Most of the grain in elevator *'B"
is said to have come from private Â¦ware
houses, and an investigation as to how it
passed inspection is among the probabili
ties. In this elevator are also 428,000 bush
els of Â¦wheat and 163,000 bushels of oats.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., . May 21.â What
the police believe was an attempt to rob
the Cambridgeport National Bank of this
city, by the use of dynamite in broad day
light was revealed at 10:45 a. m. to-day by
an explosion in the bank, which blew out
the side of the building, damaging other
parts of it, arid in which Cashier William
A. Roaf sustained a wound on the head.
If the . explosion was a part of a plot
to rob the bank the plan failed, for. noth
ing of value was taken from the place.
It ie thought from the force of the con
cussion and other evidence that dynamite
was used, and that it may have been set
off by a time fuse.
The bank is in a four-story brick struc
ture in the business center of Cambridge.
The shock of- the explosion was felt for
several blocks, but no damage was done
outside of the bank building. -

General Assembly Delegates
Asked to Urge Greater
Aid.
PHILADELPHIA, May 2Lâ The com
missioners to the Presbyterian General
Assembly to-day gave vent to a sponta
neous burst of patriotic enthusiasm
which found voice in the hearty rendition
of a national anthem. The report of the
committee on home missions had bcea
read and the Rev. Charles O. Thompson,
secretary of the Home Mission Board,
arose to make the usual appeal for aid.
which developed into an oration and
aroused the assembly to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm.
A statement in , the committee's report
that over 3000 churches failed to give di
rectly to the Home Mission Board aroused
the ire of the commissioners representing
self-supported synods and presbyteries*
and after a brief but lively debate the ob
jectionable paragraph was eliminated.
The Rev. Dr. Hush K. Walker, chair
man of the committee, in discussinsr the
report declared that unless the churches
supported the home missions the foreign
missions would . fall. The report urged
Congress to act on the anti-polygamy
amendment to the constitution before thÂ©
Mormons secure the balance of political
power in any additional States. Both
morning and afternoon sessions were de
voted to routine business.

WASHINGTON, May 2Lâ The Coroner's
Jury which nas been Investigating the
murder of James S. Ayres, the young
Census Office clerk, at the Hotel Ken
more last Wednesday morning, to-day
brought in the following verdict:
"James Seymour Ayres came to his
death on "Wednesday, May 15, 1901, about
the hour of 2 o'clock a. m., at the Hotel
Kenrcore, died of a pistol shot- wound of
the chest. Further, said shot was fired
during a fatal conflict between said James
Seymour Ayres and Iola Ida Henri Bo
nlne. WÂ«, the Coroner's Jury, hold Iola
Ida Henri Bonine for the Grand Jury."
Before the jury rendered its verdict a
number of witnesses were heard. An ef
fort was made to show that Miss Minas
could easily have heard voices through
the door connecting her room with that
of Ayres. and that lights could have been
seen through the- cracks. Detectives
Home and Weedon testified to this effect,
but Miss Minas declared that she saw no
lights on the night of the shooting. She
also testified ! that the cries she heard
coming from Ayres' room were made by
a. man s voice and not by a woman's. 'She
was positive that the voice was not that
of Mrs. Bonine.
This contradicts Mrs. Bonine, who in
her confession yesterday said that she
had uttered the only vocal sounds made
In the room at the time of the tragedy.
Detective Home's testimony concerning
yesterday's confession was not materially
different from the statement as then
given out District Attorney Gould said
that Mrs. Bonine had decided not to ap
pear before the Coroner's Jury.
The typewritten copy of her confession
was taken to Mrs. Bonine to-day for the
purpose of having her bwear to it, as she
was not under oath when she made the
statement yesterday. Mrs. Bonine after
making the confession had consulted a
lawyer and he advised her to avoid any
thing in the nature of assisting the prose
cution. When the confession was present
ed to her she positively refused to make
the desired affidavit.
After the Coroner's Jury had rendered
the verdict Mrs. Bonine was removed to
the City Jail.
Iola Bonine Must Answer
for James Ayres'
Death.

JURY ORDERS
THE WOMAN HELD
RYDB, Isle of Wight, May 21.â The trial
of Shamrock II and Shamrock I to-day
was in many respects the most puzzling
that has yet taken place. Instead of
throwing additional light upon the abili
ties of the challenger, to-day's race makes
it more difficult than ever to estimate her
speed.
On the stretch from Cowes to the Sll
kiker they had an interesting struggle
under full racing canvas, with the skip
pers at the helm. Officially racing has not
commenced, but the skippers were appar
ently having a trial between themselves
and snatching every advantage. The
Shamrock II was a good half-mile to the
leeward when they started, but in the five
miles between the anchorage and the Sil
klkcr she closed up the whole of this big
gap. After threatening to go through to
weather Shamrock II had to be thrown
into the wind and held all aback while
Captain Wnnge sailed . the Shamrock I
boldly across his bows on the wrong tack.
The keenness of the contest was shown
by the fact that Captain Wringe tried
this bluff, for had Captain Sycamore held
on there would probably have been a dis
astrous collision.
For the first five miles of the official
course the new yacht did equally well,
opening out on every board and then sud
denly falling off instead of gaining. The
new yacht lost on every tack. The ex
plaration.given by those on board is that
the bobstay weakened and spilled the head
sails and foresails, but it is strange if an
imperceptible difference in the trim of her
sails made so much difference in her sail*
ing.
However, as it was, the old boat turned
the weather mark nearly three minutes
ahead and went off down the wind at a
great pace. Then came another surprise,
for the challenger, which had never be
fore been able to run her, closed up all the
time, and when they finished at Nab light
ship the times were:
Shamrock I, 2 hours' 6 minutes and 12
seconds. . â¢. . : - â¢
Shamrock II, 2 hours 11 minutes and 19
seconds. *.
The opinion of most of the experts who
witnessed the' race was that had it been
desired that the ' Shamrock II should win
she could easily have done so.

Starting out this forenoon In a dying out

fine southwester sent her scudding about
the bay in a lively fashion, with little fuss
and scarcely any feathery foam under her
smooth, bow or in her clean wake. Every
point of sailing was tried. She was hauled
flat on the wind, thrown about half a
dozen times, given a grood broad reach,
and finally sent home before the wind

Dr. Bunker's Examination.
The preliminary examination of Dr.
Robert E. Bunker on the charge of mur
der in connection with the death of Jane
Bouillaguet. a governess, was continued
befcre Judge Cabanlss yesterday after
noon. The prosecution closed with the
evidence of Dr. .Bacigalupi, autopsy phy
sician. Attorney Hosmer then made a
motion to dismiss. He argued that Miss
A. Cerles, the principal witness for the
prosecution, was. If anything, an accom
plice If a crime had been committed and
ihere was nothing to corroborate her tes
timony. The Judge denied the motion and
the defendant testified in his own behalf.
Dr. W. R. Cluness also testified for the
defense, and the case was continued Ull
this morning.
While every one Is preparing to decorate
the graves of the soldiers who served the
country so well and faithfully there is a
deep-founded desire to pay some special
tribute to the men who fought on the sea
and who lie sleeping beneath its restless
waves. For years it has been the custom
to decorate the mounds of earth that
mark the last resting place of the soldier
and to include in the decoration a thought
to the memory of the sailor, but this year
and hereafter it is proposed to strew flow
ers on the breast of old ocean In special
honor and memory of the dead he has
clasped in his great white arms.
The suggestion cprnes from Mrs. Arml
tage S. C. Forbes. It has received the In
dorsement of every one who has heard of
It, and particularly of men of the navy.
A year ago such a demonstration was
made, but It was quietly done and only
by those who had good cause to show
some special care for such a ceremony.
This year, however, the idea has claimed
attention from many sources and the out
going tide will bear with It garlands and
wieaths and big bunches of blossoms
dropped on the surface of tho sea In
tribute to the memory of those who were
its sons and those it has claimed as its
own.
In years gone by the sailor dead have
not been neglected. The mournful mounds
that tell of their last berth ashore have
briEhtened at the close of every May
with the flowers loving hands have show
ered over them, but a peaceful rest under
the daisies is not the only fate of those
who brave the storm and carry the flag
through wind and weather. â¢

General Lacayo Pays a Fine.
General Carlos Lacayo, ex-Consul Gen
eral of Nicaragua, was convicted In Judge
Fritz's court yesterday on the charge of
disturbing the peace and was fined $50.
Early last Thursday morning he assaulted
Oeorpe Brown, a student from Chile, at
Powell and O'Farrell streets because
Brown asked him for money loaned. The
general claimed that Brown made dispar
aging remarks about one of his lady
friends.

while the living cleared,, for action once
more. It Is one thing to fight with the
solid old mother earth beneath the feet
it is. another to fight with a thousand
fathoms of clutching, clawing sea reach
ing for ship and man, where defeat means
to sink with the vessel and where even
victory has often meant the same. For
these men there has been no special trib
ute on Memorial day. but it is the inten

And the men who stand to the guns are
not the only toilers for the flag at sea.
There are thousands more who carry It
to the farthest confines of the world

treasures from the land it represents.
Memorial day has grown to be more than
a time of memory for the man who bore
arms, and next to the man from the war

creates in peace what the bluejacket pro
tects in war. The annals of the merchant

In the task of drilling for the Sutro tun
nel of the Comstock ne was actively en
gaged. At Fitchburg. Mass., In 1867, Mr.
Lacy flrst met Mr. Burleigh, and subse
quently Introduced on this coast the drill
which bears the name of the inventor.
Mr. Lacy began his business career In San
Francisco in 1871. He was born at Wex

and daughters to mourn him. - , .Â¦ .
ceased had suffered but a short time.
Benjamin T. Lacy was a man of pro
gressive energy. He was connected with
the work of drilling the Mount Cenis tun
nel through the Alps and of boring the
Hoosac tunnel In New England before he
came to California. He also performed
important work under General Newton in
Congressman Loud also deems the com
ing visit of the committee to be of much
public Interest In California. The commit
tee, he eays, will visit the Atlantic and
Gulf ports and river systems as well as
the waterways of the Pacific slope, Its
Idea being to get a complete knowledge of
the entire subject as it concerns the
country at large. Very likely It will visit
the great lakes, if the members are not
thoroughly acquainted with them already.
He understands the committee will travel
at its own expense.
Congressman Julius Kahn has received
advises from Washington that lead him
to think that nearly all the members of
the Congressional Committee on Rivers
and Harbors will come to California next
morlh. He 6ald yesterday that before he
left the East for home he had a talk with
Congressman Burton, who is the chair
man of the House committee, concerning
the journey of the committee members,
and he thinks it probable that their visit
to California may have a very beneficial
effect. This State had large interests
reptesented in the provisions of the river
and harbor bill as it was reported from
the committee at the last session. Among
the items was one of $612,000 for the im
provement of Oakland harbor. The San
Joaquin and Sacramento rivers were to
be benefited by the expenditure of sums
aggregating $250,000. There is also a rec
ommendation for the disbursement of
S216.000 unexpended money for the work
on f.hag rock and Arch rock to secure a
depth of thirty-four feet of water over
them- Redwood and Petaluma creeks
also are in the line of improvement. Alto
gether the amount that may be expended
for the betterment of Callfgornla rivers
and harbors is about $1,600,000.
"The purpose of the coming of the Riv
ers and Harbors Committee," said Con
gressman Kahn, "is to gain personal
knowledge of the waterways and to find
out what Is needed, that means may be
provided to give what relief can be af
forded. I assume that a majority of the
committee will come to the Coast. From
Congressman Burton I have learned that
he has tried to enlist the Interest of all
the members of the committee. The mat
ter is of importance. I will accompany
the committee, if it desires, when it ar
rives, and help it to get all the knowledge
that It needs of the various localities
where improvements may be made, and
also of waterways generally."

It Is Impossible for this court to say that the
showing of such a violation of a city ordi
nance did not prejudice the Jury before whom
ho waÂ» being- tried. â¢ â¢ â¢ In view of these
facts the court reverses the Judgment and order
of the lower court and remands the case for a
new trial.
The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday reversing the judgment
and order of the Superior Court. -; which
convicted Thomas A. Kelly a year and a
half ago of the charge â¢ of conspiring to
defraud a public " office. . Â¦Â¦ '",
Kelly was accused of accepting "straw"
bonds as ball â¢ for the recognizance of a
negro sneak thief named "Wilson, who fled
froih the city as soon as he was freed. : It
was alleged that Kelly accepted the fraud
ulent bonds knowingly and had. made an
agreement to do so with Wilson's attor
ney, J. N. E. Wilson. .
In rendering the decision ;the, Supreme
Court considered but two points In the
appeal; first, that there was a large
amount of extraneous evidence admitted
at the trial, and second, that Judge Law
lor, before whom the case was tried, had
wrongfully charged the jury. v. .
It was admitted that evidence In regard
to conversations between Wilson, the ac
cused, and his attorney, at which Kelly
was not proven to have been present, had
been allowed to be presented, by the
Judge, although it Incriminated the pris
oner.- The Supreme Court therefore -held
that a conviction under, such circum
stances was illegal. In charging the jury
the former court had read an ordinance
wherein it is prohibited to a police court
clerk to accept ball bonds outside the
limits of the City Hall. The trial court
then admitted its error, but said there was
evidence enough aside from the ordinance
to convict.
In reference to this point the Supreme
Court says: ;
a Jury.

The club is also planning to have a club
house as soon as feasible and unless
articles of Incorporation are filed Its of
ficials cannot transact business in a
proper manner. Mrs. White also states
that the club has some money and it Is
desired to invest this in such a manner as
to draw more Interest than It does at pres
ent. It is thought that as a business con
cern the club can inspire more respect
among business men than If it remains an
irresponsible organization. Every one is
strongly In favor of the plan, and Mrs.
"White states that there Is : no doubt /but
what it will be adopted at the regular
business meeting.
After the meeting the members were ad
dressed by Mrs. Mary Urquhart Lee,- the
distinguished parliamentarian, from the
East, on the economic and social condi
tions of the Mormon women. L. M. King
spoka on the subject. of street cleaning.
The clubrooms were taxed to their full
capacity and the greatest Interest was
shown by the members in the topics un
der discussion. At the conclusion of the
addresses numerous questions were asked
the speakers. .
" Mrs. Lee gave an Interesting sketch of
a number of the most prominent of tlie
Mormon women and attributed to them a
high degree of Independence and self-re
liance. She asserted . that their &ssoci>
tion with the men In political life had
greatly developed them and that as a rule
they had become more determined and
more willing to face the drudgery of llfÂ«
than the ordinary woman. She spoke of
the remarkable skill they have attained
as Â¦weavers of silk and gave a very en
tertaining description of silk culture in
general. â¢ '
By unanimous -vote Mrs. J. J; Scovllle,
Mrs. Aaron Schloss. Mrs. J. S. Spear, Mrs.
Dorothy Harnden and Mrs. Charles. A.
"Warren were appointed a committee to
learn how the action might best be taken
and to report thereon at the regular an
nual business. meeting of the club, which
Is to be held on next Tuesday.
Mrs. Lovell "White originated "the plan
more than a year ago and the matter has
been discussed frequently since that time,
but no public attention was given to it till
yesterday. The incentive to Incorporate,
Mrs. White says, arises from a general
desire to increase the scope and efficacy of
the work of the club. ;Â¦Â»
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the
club, addressed the ladies present on the
subject of incorporating the organization.
The project met' with favor. Suggestions
were made" 1 by some Denver ladies who
are visiting 1 In San Francisco and who are
members of an incorporated club in their
home city. Â¦.-They- stated' that with them
the experiment had proved an 'unques
tioned success and placed their club on. a
much higher basis.

Mrs. Lindsay, Johnson's Efforts.
It is a far cry from William Morris and
the Kelmscott shop to the Georgia moun
taineer at Fouches Gap, and yet an arts
and crafts movement has been initiated
in the latter placo, which, however hum
bly, recapitulates the thought of the great
English master. . ;
/The mountaineer* of North Georgia, in
common 1 with those of North Carolina;
Tennessee and Kentucky, the other States
of the Appalachian highlands, are a primi
tive people, among whom life has moved
in the same channels for many, hundreds
of years. Their Ignorance explains their
prejudice, and their, bravery, honesty and
occasional fruitless industry, speak of
greater capabilities within them. â¢ 'Â¦
The genuine highlands are 'remote, from
civilization." but â¢ there . are boundary -dis
tricts In which the "mountain white," in
his untcrrlfled Illiteracy and shlf tlessness,
lies geographically near to the great world
>of which; he knows so little. .". . : Â¦
Hand Work of the Mountaineers.

their â¢ illuminating trade-mark of "Not

The whole business of hand work has
fallen so thoroughly into desuetude in the
United States that the dying embers of it
must be fanned and cherished,
and after the work is done a.market must
be created, almost artificially at first, for
since hand work must always cost more
than the -products of the machine, the
public must be Interested in the subject
of crafts and acquainted with the excel

fore it will see a reason for paying a
larger sum for what seems, superficially;

" Fostering Hand Work In America. Â¦
True it is that the Occidental nations
have ever lacked that subtle necromancy
of touch which makes of the products of
the Orient wonders of the world. It Is
equally true that our own new world has
found neither place nor time for the beau
tics of European hand work, but for this
latter deficiency there have been reasons
which do not, perhaps, argue a lack of
artiwtlc possibilities. Though the. hand
products of tha western world may never
equal those of tha Orient they may cer
tainly attain an admirable degree of
ixauty and-excellonce and be. found ox*
prooslve of our life and civilization.
The General Federation of Women's
Clubs has a strong central committee,
which has done much to stimulate inter
est in and desire for hand products. Its
chairman, Mrs. Herman J. Hall of Chi
cago, with an able corps of assistants, ar
ranged at the last biennial convention of
women's clubs in Milwaukee an exhibit
ol arts and crafts which was of unex
celled value and significance of interest.
The handwork of ail nations appeared tn
wonclerf ul â¢ and dazzling array, Â¦ metal,
Jewels, -wood, lace, leather and all the
wonderful weaves of the Orient testifying
to the art of the old world' craftsman.
Few and pale in comparison seemed the
rugs and pots, the draperies and the carv
ings which stood for "home products,"
but of unspeakable Interest to the loyal
American, who saw in them the promise
of unfolding beauty and development both
of the art and the artist.
Work by the General Federation.
'.- Social telesis, as a great social philos
opher has aptly named this effort of.so
clety.faa a whole,' to assist socialevolu
tion, is manifesting itself more andr^e
strongly in afl the movements of the <*W,
and such a group as is constituted by the
club women of the United States should be
a potent factor in observing and fostering
social tendencies, v
A notable instance in this direction is to
be found in the great and growing inter
est 'of American club women in tne new
movement toward democratic art and its
expression, which is manifesting itself so
strongly in the United States to-day.
Never before has there been such a ten
dency to make art a part of the dally life
of all the people and to draw from the
simplest individuals some product of the
hand inspired by the individual mind.
The club women of America have done
and are doing much to foster this ten
dency for individual hand production,
which is raising- its head feebly enough
amid the endless profusion of machine
made products. ' : ':Â¦Â¦â¢
The work of women's clubs falls under
two headsâ what they do and what they
suggest. Â¦
Every discussion must take into consid
eration these two distinct lines of influ
ence and there can be little question that
the abstract field of suggestion is quite as
important as the concrete one of actual
endeavor. ;
.Society Is only Just reaching that stage
in evolution when it perceives Its "ten
dencies" and consciously strives to foster
them.

was true of the fair In the autumn of
1900. On both occasions Mrs. . Johnson's
hand weavers created great Interest by
weaving on the loom at certain hours and
by a beautiful exhibit of coverlids of va
rious designs and colors,' towel.i, draperies
and similar products.
All sold well and many orders were
taken- each year which the weavers filled
during the long summer and winter
months that elapsed between exhibits.
The blue and white cotton 1* particu
larly popular for draperies and portieres
in seaside cottages, where it denes the sea
air, refusing to Decrfme "slimpsy," as may
bo said of few other fabrics. . "
.. One purchaser ordered a hundred yards
of this product for cottage draperies,
while many buyers have been delighted
with their quaint blue and white fringed
counterpanes. . â¢ â¢ .
Linens and Silk Scrap Draperies.
Some beautiful hand-woven linens have
been produced for sheets and towels, but
the cost of the flax necessitates so consid
erable an Investment that this feature of
the industry must needs wait on orders or
further capital.
Good success has attended ' the weaving
of the silk scrap draperies which axe so
effective for portieres, dlyan covers and
similar uses. The same 'product which
can be woven in New York for $1 a yard
can be woven in the mountains of North
Georgia for about 10 cents a vard. In
each case the silk scraps are, of course,
furnished by the customer.
Mrs. Nellie Peters Black of Atlanta,
whose farming interests also border on
the mountain district, has found similar
interests to foster. Â¦ Â¦ -
From Pine Log come, besides the weav
ing, old-fashioned silk quilts, hand-made
hats, and some interesting specimens of
basketry in which cornstalks, pine needles
and broomstraw are used with really ex
cellent effect. . .
Exhibits of all these products are made
not only at the State fairs, which are the
best markets, but at the various women's
clubs of the State, and thus a steady and
increasing demand for the hand wares
has been produced, which has- proved
mutually advantageous. to producer and
consumer. One must needs know the
homes and - the home life of the women
who do the handweaving to realize what
the coming of ready cash must mean to
them.
Hope for Rag-Carpet Weavers.
Of course the rag carpets are among the
Eroducts of the mountain craftswomen,
ut as yet the results have not been par
ticularly satisfactory. Some Instruction
in color combination, however,' can bring
this product up to the level of the other
wares and can produce strips equal to
those sold through the Roycrofters, at
East Aurora as the work of "Rovcroftle
gtrls 70 years young."
Although the mountain women are
those for whom â¢ southern club women
have done most, the movement has by no
means ended there. Hand craftsmen
have been developed and encouraged both
among club women and elsewhere. Some
very excellent exhibits have been marie
at the clubs- of hand carving, both In
pieces of furniture and In smaller apccN
mena of burnt wood, carved and burnt
leathar, hammered brass,- plaiting - and
weaving;
An -effort has been i made, to divert the
talent of nomÂ» young artlits from .the
painting of largo pictures which nobody
wantM to- the execution of beautiful and
artlxtlo dlnnnr curds, menu cards and
Christmas and Easter giftsâ things, In
â¢inert, which people really want and In
the preparation of which artistic Ability
may find a genuine expression that the
big, undeslred oil painting would never
show. â¢ * i
Arrnnfflnpf 'for a' Market.
A' number of mIch have been mnde of
alt tho articles above mentioned and for
the ensuing autumn a great stile' is
planned at the Women's Club In Atlantn,
nt which every .variety of hand work,
ranging from carved wood to embroid
eries, will be offered to those In search of
holiday Â¦ gifts. There seems little duubt
that purchasers, as well as craftsmen,
will be pleased at this opportunity to ae
curo gifts of a novel and unique character,
each Dearing- the "hand-made" .mark.
One embyro bookbinder has been found
who, with legal calf and some simple in
struments,/ has produced good results. :
Among humbler craftsmen like efforts
have been made toward encouragement
and direction. Manufacturers of root and
branch settees and chairs, so fearfully
and wonderfully made as to be objects of
curiosity, but not of utility, have been
induced to substitute for Â¦ these wares
neat, strong, well-made chairs, as tables
and lawn Beats of white hickory,, perfect
in every part and standing squarely on all
four legs alike. - , Â¦ .- â¢ â¢ . ;
Work of Negro Craftsmen.
The work of some negro craftsmen has
been encouraged. ; They have done par
ticularly well in basketry, mainly in large
pieces, such as clothes hampers and waste
baskets made of willow withes. These are
pretty In white and when stained with
analine dyes, in bright reds and greens,
they give a picturesque Indian effect.
That so little of that effect appears In our,
art products to-day marks the crowning
loss Of American crafts.
That the wonders of -Indian pottery and
basketry, at once so unique and so char
acteristic, should have been permitted to
lapse and disappear from the art of our
nation was an error as inexplicable as it
waa irreparable. The remains of.,thls
aboriginal art may be stimulated some
what in. the "West and Northwest, but in
the South, where "the red man -in some
what isolated Instances appeared within
the writer's recollection,- no trace is left
of his crafts, .the secrets of which should
In an> important respect the Nantucket lightship
service differs from what has been done hitherto. The
former enterprises made use of wireless telegraphy for
temporary purposes; it was applied only for special
occasions. The service now established by the Herald
is to be permanent. It is to continue until science and
invention have devised better methods. At present it
represents the best in*the world and will be of vast
benefit to the public. A saving of fifteen hours in
getting news from trans-Atlantic steamers is an event
of high importance, and the whole commercial world
may be congratulated on the enterprise of our New
York contemporary.
By reason of its relations with the Herald % The Call
will have the benefit of the improved service, and thus
will again be a sharer in the advance made in tele
graphing without wires. It will be remembered that
The Call was the first paper to apply wireless teleg
raphy to the service of newsgatheringwhen it obtained
from a vessel off the Golden Gate the announcement
of the arrival of the transport bringing home the Cal
ifornia volunteers from the Philippines. The next
notable work with wireless telegraphy was done when
the Herald and The Call reported the international
yacht races off Sandy Hook from a steamer that fol
lowed the yachts and dispatched reports of every fea
ture of the race as it occurred, thus getting the news
far ahead of papers that relied upon the old methods.
BY the New York Herald there has been estab
lished on Nantucket lightship a system of wire
less telegraphy, by which news of incoming
steamers from Europe will be received fifteen hours
earlier than at present. A gain of that much in time
is an important factor to all interests that are affected
by steamer news, and consequently the establishment
of the improved service is one of the most notable
things that have been accomplished thus far by the
wirfcless method of telegraphing.
IMPROVED NEWS SERVICE.
have been engrafted upon our people and
â¢fostered as the most truly American art.
This effort to stimulate and foster art
expression has proved wonderfully inter
esting, and if sometimes our "swans
have turned out geese we have not been
too much cast down. . ,~
How an Enthusiast Was Disappointed
I remember one rather amusing Incident
of dashed expectancy in the case of a club
Â¦woman : who was an 'ardent proraulga tor
of the arts and crafts. movement and was
constantly on the watch for hopeful ma
terial from which to develop a craftsman.
One day a servant brought to her bed
room a tabouret mado of bamboo and
matting, but executed by the hand of a
skilled workman. He reported that a man
at the door wished to sell It. The club
woman was all interest at once. A Geor
gia countryman who could make a tabou
ret like that was a treasure. Buying the
llttlo specimen, she cent word to tho
maker to como back with other work
when she could see him. The wife of the
American Minister to Japan was present
and Paid mildly that it looked very like
Japanese workmanship. The club woman,
however, protested that there was no rea
pon why every good pleoe of Joiner's worlt
done in bamboo should be necessarily
Japanese*'' Â¦ â¢
It was a blow when the craftsman ap
peared a few days later and proved to bo
a full-blooded Japanese to whom English
was still an unknown quantity.
The club woman took her disappoint
ment generously, ordering fascinating 1 tea
table* and porch chairs for a summer
cottage. Sundry younjr American crafts
men, seeing the work, were Induced to
emulate It.
Growing Demand for Sand Work.
There can be little doubt that this move
ment for hand work, with Its excellenco
of execution and Its Individual expression.
Is to be more than a passing fad in Amer
ica, That a market is to be afforded
among us Is evident from such facts aÂ»
the well known one that the ateliers of
numerous artists of to-day have been
turned Into workshops, -with orders for
hand-made furniture pressing for execu
tlcn.
The same demand seems easy to creats
In every department of the hand crafts,
and In creating this demand and stimu
lating the production which shall, with
increasing excellence, fill it, lies a great
field for Interesting 1 /and valuable effort
on the part of the American club woman.

The Democratic Review for November, 1839, re
commended that canal treaties be made with the
Central American governments and England, France,
Holland and Russia. Clayton made the first of these,
with England, now known as the Clayton-Bulwcr
treaty, and yet the project is but little farther advanced
than when the monk united the oceans in the ravine
of Raspadura, one hundred and fourteen years ago.
In 1835 John M. Clayton promoted an inquiry
in Congress, and the result was an exhaustive report
with appendix containing the opinion of Mr. Radcliff,
to the effect that what is now known as the Panama
route was the preferable route. /* :
' The next effort was a grant to Baron de Thierry to
build a canal by aid of the rivers Chagres and Grande
and the Bay of Limon. Santander/ President of New
Granada, made this contract. De Thierry was an usher
in Cambridge University v and in that capacity met
some chiefs from New Zealand, who, in a freak, con
ferred upon him letters patent as "Sovereign Chief of
New Zealand." When he solicited the canal grant from
Santander he insisted upon the use of that title, and
when it was not employed his zeal for the canal abated.
He was a mere adventurer. This brings the history of
the canal up to 1835 and the organization of Biddle's
company and its failure.
Simon Bolivar, the Liberator, while ruler of Co
lombia, gave much attention to a canal. He employed
Lloyd, ah Englishman, and Falmarck, a Swede, both
engineers, to investigate the subject, and they reported
in England to the Royal Society and the Royal Geo
graphical Society. Bolivar, at Guayaquil, in 1829, de
clared to an American gentleman that, having brought
the war between Colombia and Peru to a victorious
conclusion, he intended, on his return to Bogota, to
employ his army in building the canal. But Bolivar
was compelled by failing health to resign and soon
after died. It is believed that, had he lived and con
tinued in power, the employment of his tremendous
energy and talents would have assured the completion
of the work.
After this failure President Jackson sent Mrv Bid
die to Central America to negotiate for a canal. But
Biddle was unequal to the task arid his mission was a
mortifying failure.
Next a Dutch company ,wns formed under the
patronage' of the King of Holland. General Vcrvecr
was sent by the King to Central America. This project
was defeated by the Belgian revolution.
After their separation from Spain the Central
American governments began immediately to con
sider an isthmian canal. September 18, 1824, the En
glish house of Barclay & Co., representing a company
composed of American merchants, made proposals to
Central America for the construction of a canal by the
San Juan and Lake Nicaragua. This proposition seems
to have aborted, but in June, 1826, Charles de
Beneski, representing American capitalists, made a
contract for a canal by that route. The contract set
forth that the canal should admit merchant ships of
the largest class and be open to all nations on equal
terms. Possessed of the contract, Mr. Palmer exe
cuted a deed of trust to DffWitt Clinton, Stephen Van
Rensselaer, C. D. Colden, Philip Hone and Lynde
Catlin, by which they were made commissioners to
superintend the organization of the "Central, American
and United States Atlantic and 'Pacific Canal Com
pany." A financial crisis, and political disturbances on
the isthmus, killed that project.
The fifth was by the same river Atrato and its trib
utary, the Quito. The waters of the latter approach
near to a stream called the San Juan; emptying into
the Pacific. Between the two is a small ravine called
De la Raspadura... Humboldt says that a monk of
great enterprise, cure of the village of Novita, em
ployed his parishioners to dig a small canal in that
ravine, through which, and by the rivers, canoes
loaded with cacao pass from sea to sea, and that this
communication between the oceans was in operation
in 1788, and was unknown in Europe!
The fourth was by the river Atrato, which, witl\ its
tributary, the Napipi, is navigable to within eighteen
miles of the Bay of Cupica on the Pacific.
Humboldt, in his "Political Essay on the Kingdom
of New Spain," enumerated five different routes for
the canal. The first is within the limits of Mexico,
from the Bay of Tehuantepec ' on the Pacific to the
Bay of Campeachy on the Gulf, following the rivers
Chimalapa and Huasacualco, whose navigable waters
approach to within twenty miles of each other. The
second was the Nicaragua route by the San Juan River
and Lake Nicaragua. The third was by the. Isthmus
of Panama, requiring a canal only thirty miles long,
and was most favored by Humboldt.
â¢ Again, in 1788, Jefferson wrote: "With respect to
the Isthmus of Panama, I am assured by Burgoin that
a survey was made; that a canal "was practicable, and
that the idea was suppressed for political reasons alto
gether. He has seen and minutely examined the re
port. This report seems to me a vast desideratum for
reasons practical and philosophical."
THE proposition for an isthmian canal, to connect
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is by no means
new. It did not even originate in the nineteenth
century. It had birth long before the age of railroads,
and preceded the adoption of steam power on the water.
The Edinburgh Review of January, 1809, spoke of it as
"the mightiest event in favor of the peaceful inter
course^ nations which the physical circumstances of
the globe presents to the enterprise of man." But at
that date the discussion of the canal was far advarfecd.
In 1787 Jefferson, 1 then our Minister to France, in a
letter to Mr. William Carmichael at Madrid said: "I
have been told that cutting through the Isthmus of
Panama, which the world has so often wished and
supposed practicable, has at times been thought of by
the Government of Spain, and" that they proceeded
once so far as to have a survey and examination made
of the ground; but that the result was either imprac
ticability or too great difficulty."
SOME CANAL HISTORY.
That kind of thing .will never be written of. an
American warship again. : Our ideals have moved up
ward and forward a long way. since the old Ohio sailed
and charmed the world by her graceful beauty, but
was manned by sailors disciplined by the cat. .We
have improved in something more than in machinery
and in guns, and .the improvement is worth noting by
all who are in the habit of talking about the good old

The citizens of Boston can mark the difference be
tween the feelings existing toward Commodore Hull by
his ship's company " (the "Ohio ; had' 1000 officers, seamen
and marines) and that between Commodore Reed and
the crew of the frigate Columbia; then, several hundred
of the friRate's crew, after they were discharged,
paraded In front of the Tremont House in hopes to be
able to chastise him in such a manner as his cruel and
arbitrary, conduct so richly merited. '
In the course of his journal the writer says:
of s(Tventy-five lashes were common. '-Yet Commodore
Hull (who commanded the Ohio, during the Â» cruise
the journal describes) was _ reckoned an easy com
mander in those days." â¢ : _
THE SAN FEA^CISCp CALL, WEDNESDAY, ;MAZ; 22, 19( >1.
Whatever view be taken of the responsibility of par
ticular individuals, it is certainly an evil that a few men
are able artificially in a time of prosperity to bring
about a panic of such large proportions. There should
be some way to fix the responsibility definitely and
then provide means'of restraining such an exercise of
power hereafter. In this case the injury was confined
to speculators, but in a time of industrial depression or
financial weakness a similar panic might affect the
whole country.
The Boston Herald attributes the crash to a set of
men who it says are simply stock gamblers. They have
no desire to control a railroad and when they purchase.
stock they do so solely for speculative purposes.
"These men," it says, "came to the conclusion that
there was a fight for control on foot between tre
mendous financial interests, and that the opportunity,
under such circumstances, for a 'corner' in the stock
was uncommonly good. The speculators who then
entered into the market as purchasers were unques
tionably the true cornerers, and they had not the least
compunction in exacting from the unfortunate seller
every ounce of flesh and blood that the terms of the
contract gave them the right to demand. It was this
outside participancy in the movement, that had not
been entirely foreseen by the two rival financial in
terests, which led to the seriousness of last week's
crisis.
There is an evident unwillingness on the part of
most of the critics of the event to name the "eminent
financiers" who are supposed to have been responsible
for it all. The men who were struggling to get posses
sion of Northern Pacific stock so as to control the
road have one and all denied having any complicity in
the corner. It is stated that two banking houses, those
of J. P. Morgan & Co. and of'Kuhn, Loeb & Co., held
between them, either in actual possession or in prom
ises to deliver, a larger number of shares than was
represented by the entire capital stock of the Northern
Pacific road, and consequently they could have formed
a corner and cinched the street had they desired. Still
there seems no reason to believe they did so, for, in
stead of taking advantage of the situation, they are
reported to have been prompt in trying to arrange a
means of relieving those who were caught.
THE CORNER AND THE CLIQUE.
HAVING studied out the recent corner in North
ern Pacific and reached the conclusion that the
whole flurry, fiom first to last, was absolutely
artificial, the people of the East arc now trying to dis
cover who arc the men that brought it about. It ap
pcart to be generally conceded that a comparatively
small number of persons organized the scheme,
worked it up, excited the speculators of the street and
then, at their own time and in their own way, precipi
tated the slump. They made some millions of money
for themselves, but they ruined an untold number of
persons who were credulous enough to risk their small
earnings in the gamble.
In commenting upon the subject the New York
Sun says: "The sudden tumble in prices on Thursday
was catised by efforts specially made by a few men to
enrich themselves through sacrificing public interests
by whipping up a storm for which nothing in the
actual conditions afforded justification. It was a panic
of purely artificial creation, of preconcerted and knav
ish manipulation, an example of the havoc which
treachery can work in the sensitive world of finance."
The United States Investor says: "The responsibility
for the appalling shake-up of the last few days can be
placed at the doors of a set of eminent financiers." ' It
adds that their immense private and corporate re
sources and their control of the banking facilities of
the country have enabled them "to embark upon the
most audacious schemes of self-aggrandizement, in the
prosecution of which they have forced upon 80,000,000
people the most terrible financial collapse on record."

China's offer-to pay* to the powers an indemnity of
$337,000,006 ,in a series of annual installments of $10,
000,000.each is as excellent from a' diplomatic as from
a financial, point of view," for if it be .-accepted there
will be a good _ prospect of haying the arrangement
broken by some sort; of international contest long be
fore the last payments' become due. -
An illustration of the change is to be found in ex
tracts taken from a "journal of the cruise of the
United States ship Ohio.Jn the Mediterranean in the
years 1839, 1840, 1841," and published by the Boston
Transcript in connection /with the launching, of the
new Ohio. After giving an account of the many tri
umphs of the' ship at various European ports and cit
ing evidences of the admiration she excited among
naval experts of all" countries, the Transcript says:
'.'The journal gives a picture of naval discipline of
sixty years ago which makes the humanitarian of to
day shudder. The cat was used for the punishment of
all offenses that were worth punishing at all. Sentences
A CHANGED NAVAL SERVICE.
VAST as is the contrast between the magnificent
ship that bears the name Ohio in our new fleets
and the Ohio of the old days, it by no means
represents ail the changes that the passage of time and
the improvements of life have brought about in our 5
navy/ There has been in the serviceMtself a better and
a mightier change than that in. the structure of the
ships. The new Ohio is to uphold a higher American
ism among her officers and crew. than was known to
those who sailed the older one.
. Of course, data obtained in the Adirondacks affords
no. basis for estimating the productiveness of forests
in California, where the climate,the soil and the trees
are different, but.it may be safely said that if scientific
silviculture can be made profitable in New York, equal
care and skill will make it even more profitable : here.
The 'New York experiment, therefore, can be made
of .value to , us. It shows what can be done in^that
way arid should arouse in California a resolve to emu
late the example. -; ! .-
Further interesting information concerning the rate
of growth of trees in the Adirondacks is given in the
following statement: "Of the sixty maples on which
rings were counted. a diameter of twelve inches on the
stump wa3 reached b'y seven within the limits of age
from 116 to 183 years. Ten trees reached a diameter
of sixteen inches in from 172 to 240 years, and seven-,
teen trees reached a diameter of twenty- inches in 175
to 233 years, while the oldest and stoutest reached
twenty-eight inches in 280 years. Thi3 was a domi
nant tree, and probably always had favorable position,
making one inch in the average^ every ten years for
a long time, and probably representing the best that
could be expected.. The few beech that were counted
all indicate a rate similar to the maple, the best mak
ing one inch in ten to eleven years, but they are not
growingjpersistently, the largest one reaching, a dia
meter 'of , twenty-four inches. It should be stated,
however, that this particular plot was rather poor in
beech. Birch, on the other hand, showed a better
rate in all the trees counted, namely, mostly under
ten years for one inch. The oldest and stoutest, 300
years old,~measured thirty-seven inches on the stump
with a' height of about" eighty-five feet to the. tip, fur
nishing, however, only two sound logs of twenty-eight
and twenty-nine. inches diameter with nearly 800 -feet
B: M. birch of thirty-six inches diameter
and'ninety feet height showed 275 rings. '
Concerning the age of the trees in the forest and
the amount of time icquired to grow timber the re
port says: "The 2600 cubic feet of wood per acre,
to which an addition of 800 feet for the culled spruce
and the, remaining" material would be a very ample
allowanceâ these 3400 cubic feet have been produced
by the virgin forest in an unknown period, but, as the
age of the trees which furnish the bulk of the product
indicates not less than 175 to, 200 years â this volume
would have been produced under common silvicul
tural methods in less than one-half the time, and prob
ably, if pine and spruce are made the main crop,
twice the amount of material could be harvested in
The New York college has contracted its wood sup
ply fo a cooperage company,, which is erecting near
one of the lakes in the Adirondacks a stave and land
ing factory to utilize the logs and a wood alcohol plant
to use. the cordwood. . The trees are felled and the
logs' cut and skidded by the employes of the college,
as it is feared the contractors would not do that work
with sufficient care for the preservation of young
trees. So careful is the economy practiced in the
work that the managers expect to be able to find, a
market for every product of the woods down to brush
one inch in diameter.

H a big crowd of Chinese down to
see the vessel away and some of
them would have liked very much to have
detained one of the passengers, who was
poking fun at them.
Yung Lun was, up to Saturday night
last, a female impersonator in the Chinese
theater on Jackson street. He was paid
a high salary, but fan tan and lottery
kept him always in debt. Lun finally
came to the conclusion that he would
never be able lo pay what he owned, so
he quietly packed his trunk and pur
chased a ticket for China on the Coptic.
Vhcn he attempted to board the eteam
eh'p yesterday his creditors grabbed him
and a free fight followed, in which Yung
Lun lost part of his queue. The customs
officers interfered, and as there wag no
warrant for the arrest of the debtor they
Insisted on his beingr allowed to board the
ship. It was then Yung Lun showed his
meanness, as he 6ecured a prominent po
sition aft and laughed and Jeered at his
angry creditors as the Coptic moved away
from the wharf.

Has Troubles of His Own.
They are not a happy family in the
cabin of the scnocner Robert Searles. now
on her way from Honolulu for Puget
Sound. The vessel left here last year,
and Captain Plltz took his wife along with
him. The lady's brother wanted to go to
gea, so the captain shipped him as cabin
boy. All went well for a month or so,
and then the lad decided that his brother
in-law should treat him as one of the
family and not as one of the crew. Mrs.
Plltz sided with her brother, but the cap
tain could not see It in that light. In con
sequence, the gallant skipper had to take
many a curtain lecture. Things reached
a climax at Honolulu. There Captain
Plltz discharg-ed his brother-in-law and
shipped another cabin boy. On May 10
he sailed for Port Townsend, but hove
to off Diamond Head. The America llaru
did not bring the end of the story, but
the supposition is that Mrs. Piltz won the
day and that the captain sent ashore for
his brother-in-law and Is bringing him
home as a cassenccr.
Coloma Home Again.
The old bark Coloma arrived from Sali
nas Cruz in ballast yesterday after a

carg-o and make the vessel ready for sea,
and It took her thirty-eight days to -come

years old, and the greater portion of her
life has been on the Pacific Coast. She is

A Most Remarkable Remedy Tint
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Paekasre Sent by Hall
. to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remarka-
ble remedy are being mailed to all who
will write Â¦ the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled - for years against the mental and
physical sulferingr of lost manhood that
the Instftute has decided to distribute free
trial packages to all who wrke. It is a
home treatment, and all men who suffer
from any form of sexual weakness result-
ing from youthful folly, premature loss
of strength and memory, weak back, vari-
cocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength j
and development just where It is needed
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success In
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute, S28 Elektron building, Fort
Wayne, Ind., stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute Is de-.
siroua of reaching that great class of men
who are tfnable to leave home to be treat-
ed, and the free sample will enable them
to see how easy it is to be cured of sex-_
ual weakness when the proper remedies
are employed. The Institute makes no
restrictions. Any man who writes will be
sent a free sample, carefully sealed In a
plain package, so that its recipient need
nave no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write
without delav. . .

NEW. YORK STOCK LIST. â¢
Shares . . , â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Closing
Sold. Stockâ : Bid.
The nature of the business is Indicated by
the example of several stocks to-day. Union
Pacific was sold yesterday on reports of an
additional issue of convertible "bonds to finance
the Northern Pacific stock purchase. To-day
the fact was confirmed that the company had
applied to the stock exchange to list the ad
ditional bonds, yet Union Pacific rose at one
time 4% over lart night. -Missouri Pacific' was
weak yesterday on the statement that th^ ex
pected dividend - would . not be declared at
once: to-day the directors met without acting
on the dividend, yet the stock rose four points
over the early low point. In other words, {he
bears of yesterday were covering their con
tracts to-day. The buying by railroads and
capitalists to effect changes in control of va
rious railroad systems which was supposed to
make up the bulk of the buying in the boom
market, when dealings ran between 2,000,000
and 3,000,000 shares a day, is also inconspicu
ous, although rumors of such dealings con
tinue to play some part, especially in Union
Pacific, which :s credited by . the newest ru
mors with Securing an interest in St. Paul.
The sttength of the Toledo, St. Louis and
Western stocks is accompanied by intimations
about tbe exchange that the buying u for
Vanderbilt account with a view to elimina
tion of competition. The other story of a
consolidation of Southwestern roads wns re
vived to-day in connection with the rally,* In
MlsEouri Pccific. The continuation of the In
junction agsinst Amalgamated Copper's mer.
ger projects accounted for the early weakness
of that stock. American Linseed and National
Lead were , strong, rather strangely, since the
absorption of thÂ« Linseed company by the
Union Lead and Oil Company is supposed to
indicate Increased competition for the National
Lead Company. The greater . ease of money
to-day had some Influence In the recovery In
prices. . Banks which were below their legal
reserve by Saturday's statement apparently
completed their â¢ recuperation yesterday. The
payments of an installment of subscriptions on
the Union Pacific bond issue and on the *pur
chase of the Rio Grande Western by the t>en
ver and Rio Grande which were made yester
dav resulted in some Influence on the mar
ket . to-day. No gold was engaged to-day, but
pome gold is expected to go out before the end
of the week. The â¢ stiffness of the London
money rate lifted the sterling rate at Paris
a fraction, but any relaxation In the London
money rate finds Immediate response In a de
cline in the Paris sterling rate, which means
shipments of gold from New York to Paris for
London account. That Is to say, Paris money
lent in London is called home to meet the
exigency of the Russian loan unless the Lon
don rate is kept high enough to make a loan
there rr.ore attractive.
The bond market was dull and inclined to
weakness .early, but showed some recoveries
later in sympathy with stocks. Total Bales,
par \*alue, $2,790,(00. Â¦ . .
United States new 4s declined % per cent
on ' the last call.
Â¦ The dealings were almost purely professional
and even that clars of operators showed less
interest than yesterday. There - is not much
difficulty experienced by them in moving
prices, declines being easily effected on light
offerings and advances are as easily achieved
by a smart bidding up process. The light
chare of the public in the market, however,
offers ro medium to take profits and the pro
fessionals find more and more that in cover
ing short sales or In selling to realize on pur
chases prices are brought back to about
where they started from.
NEW YORK, May 21.â There was a still
further JecMne In activity In the stock mar
ket to-day, the aggregate sales falling to a
figure that has not oeen touched before In
many months Even the diminished voiume
of business was largely centered in a few
stocks, notably Union . Pacific. That stock
fcoemed to nave a dominant influence on the
whole market and the evidence that It was
supported turned the market from the early
weakness, in continuance of yesterday's down
ward movement, and lifted prices to a much
higher plane, except for a stock here and
thero, which did not move hi the late trading.

Weather Report.
"Evaporated apples are firmer, 6e being
asked for prime and 4%c bid. There are few
really desirable lots of prime to be had. Waste
Is firm and in rome request. Reports from
the big apple-growing sections of Western New
York indicate a light crop this year."
"Teaches are firm, with a continued Inquiry
for low-grade fruit at 4%c. Apricots are firm
and selling fairly well. There is a steady
Mnall' demand for 40-50s, SO- 60s, 60-7Os and 90
100s prunes.
"A little more interest is noted In Calttornia
ree'dless Muscatels and unbleached Sultanas,
due possibly to the higher market on currants.
Fotth- hUElness is reported in seedless Muscatels
at 6%c and in unbleached Sultanas at 6%Â©7c.
Loose raisins are quiet. Sale of a small lot rf
2-crown wai reported at 5c. The market Is
particularly bare of 4-crown. Some inquiry
la noted for 2-crown California layers.
Mail advices from New York say: "Currants
are very firm, but the demand from the
country is only moderate, sales being chiefly
in 10-barrel' lots, with an occasional order for
a lartrer quantity. Stocks in jobbers' hands
generally are not large, but the trade is not
inclined to pay the advance, particularly at
this season of the year. Stocks in this market
will be increased by about 2500 barrels about
the middle cf June by the arrival of the Aisa
tia, which is reported . to have sailed- from
Patras on Tuesday.

The feeling In Chicago was firmer and tho
market advanced lc. In fact, ' firmness was the
feature of all American markets, and a bullish
sentiment is gradually growing. This is due
to Consular reports of the unfavorable condi
tion of the German crops, to complaints of dry
weather. In the Northwest, light receipts and a
large decrease in stocks of contract wheat. Tha
shorts are covering, and bears are not as plen
tiful â¢ as they have been. Most commission
houees had small buying orders. The Southwest
also -bought freely, but little wheat came out.
The dry weather in the Northwest is begin
ning to be a factor, and Is. creating a good
deal of talk. ' ;

CLOSING.
A holiday feeling pervaded the stock market
here to-day. The stagnation was general and
all stocks were heavy. American shares were
hardly mentioned. - They stuck at the lower
level set by New York, with the single excep
tion of Louisville and Nashville and Union Pa
cific, which were quietly bought up. Money
rates were unaltered. -

XEW TORK. May 2Lâ A Sun special
from Manila says: It is announced from
the headquarters of the Federal party
that negotiations looking to the surren
der of General Malvar have failed and
tbet General Malvar has proclaimed him
self dictator in succession to Agulnaldo.
It !? said he will reconstruct the insur
gent force of some 1800 men who are scat
lered In Batanpas, Tayabas. Laguna and
Mlndoro, and the new insurgent army
will be commanded by four generals.
The leaders of the Federal party deplore
the threatened continuation of hostilities
in the rich provinces above mentioned.
They say MaJavar'e anti-American wife
is responsible for his refusing to surren
der. It is probable a strong expedition
will be sent against him and his rendez
vous for the insurgents destroyed.
MANILLA, May 2L-E. C. Lawrence, for
merly a private in the Thirty-third Vol
unteer Infantry and afterward employed
as a civilian clerk In the adjutant gener
al's office at Manila, has been accused of
forging the signature of Captain Slavens.
the insular disbursing officer, to certain
checks purporting to be payable to Gen
eral MacArthur. On the backs of the
checks were forged indorsements of Gen
eral MacArthur to General Shatter and
to E. C. Lawrence. Two of these checks
of 5200 each have been cashed at San
Francisco, but another negotiated at St
Louis has been returned to Manila and
pronounced spurious by Captain Slavens.
Lawrence is suspected of other forgeries.
The insurgents to-day made an unsuc
cessful attack upon the village of Nacar
lan. in LAguna province. A private in the
Eighth Infantry was killed in the engage
ment. The official report of the recent en
gagement near Pasacoa, in South .Cainar

soldiers were killed and one native scout
was captured.
General MacArthur has ordered reports
from all the civil departments preparatory
to his own final report.

ST. PETERSBURG. May 21.â The at
tack on the Kaiser's speech by the Berge
vala Viedomosti is considered to have
been inspired. It says:
"We suppose Emperor William made
the speech to try to pacify the Germans,
who are angry at the disproportion be
tween the real interests of Germany In
the Far East and the colossal sacrifice of
lives and money for fantastic ends. It
is principally the fear of a break in the
amicable relations with Russia that
causes anxiety among the common sense
people in Germany. .
"Waldersee's campaign has been the
most deplorable mission In modern his
tory. The Chinese have not learned to
appreciate our civilization. On the con
trary, such deplorable conditions cannot
be hidden by rhetorical displays."
The Novostl says: "The Emperor
praises Count von Waldersee. Public
opinion not only of Germany but of all
Europe appreciates the case otherwise.
At best his efforts have been useless.
Quite uselessly he prolonged the military
occupation of Pechill, and artificially cre
ated a sphere of activity. Otherwise peace
would have been concluded long ago."
The Novoe Vremya has a special dis
patch from Vladivostok describing a
grand performance at the Chinese theater
in aid of the families of the Chinese fall
en. The Russian Governor was present
and large sums were subscribed.
Russian Press Denounces His Cam

CRITICISM OF VON WALDEBSEE
to meet Its obligations with respect to in
demnity. This proposal contemplates the
appointment of an international board of
financiers which shall periodically collect
from China the amount of money which
foreign Ministers in Peking say she can
pay, and this sum shall be distributed
among the powers In proportion to the
value of bonds issued to them by the Chi
nese Government.
Should the Chinese Government fail to
pay the amount the board fixes upon after
consultation with the foreign Ministers
as reasonable, then each power shall lose
in proportion to the amount of bonds it
has received. Individual action is to be
prohibited and the seizure of territory Is
not to occur in case China shall fail to
make payment. ,'
Special Commissioner Rockhill, who has
communicated the information regarding
this proposal to the State Department, has
been carefully instructed by the State De
partment as to the attiude of he President
thereon. Rockhill's instructions permit
his acceptance of the general features of
the proposal.
Whether the powers would be willing to
adopt the plan outlined cannot be said at*
this time, as some of the Ministers in Pe
king are as yet without Instructions from
their Governments. Even should the plan
fall of adoption, however, it is the purpose
of the administration to insert in the ttnal
treaty to be entered into a provision for
the establishment of the "open door". 1 and
if possible a provision insuring the integ
rity of China. The question of the method
to be adopted to obtain payment of the
indemnity cannot be determined until the
amount of indemnity is fixed, and the
State Department is still insisting that
there should be a substantial reduction.

those of the engineers, firemen, conduc
tors and trainmen, has not been made
manifest. There has been a general har
mony of action between the five "brother
hoods" since they united against the rail
road on the Insurance scheme proposed
by the late Collls P. Huntington. but
whether it will extend to opposition to the
new general order is a question. The gen
eral impression is that the old organiza
tions will oppose the new one, but that
remains a matter for future development.
Ogden on the east and New Orleans on
the south there are 1300 , employes eligible
to membership in that order and 1100 of
them are members, showing the complete
ness of the organization. Much of this
organization is due to the work of Estes,
but not a little is due to W. E. Davidson,
who has been appointed by President Dol
phin to succeed Estes. These two men
have been leaders in the order on the Pa
cific Coast. . â¢
The position which Estes held and to
which Davidson has been appointed Is the
head one of the order so far as .all of the
lln^s of the Southern Pacific Company are
concerned. IÂ£ there is any trouble be
tween the men and the officials of the
rood It becomes the duty of the chairman
of the division to adjust it.
From the statement of President Dol
phin it Is apparent that his order Is going
to lcok with disfavor upon the new gen
eral order. What stand Is to be taken by
the four other great "brotherhoods,"

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, May 21.â LitUe
mercy was shown to-day to cadets at
the Military Academy found by the court
of Inquiry convened by Colonel Mills, the
superintendent, to be guilty of Insubor
dination. Five were dismissed, six were
suspended and half a hundred were or
dered deprived of their privileges. Cadets
Stephen B. Vernon of New York and
Charles S. Perry of Iowa will be dis
missed In accordance with the findings of
a court-martial. â¢
WEST POINT. May 21.â Deep gloom
pervaded the cadet corps when the un
official information reached here regard
ing the disciplinary measures. - Colonel
Mills will return from Washington to
morrow, bringing with him the official or
ders. He will cause five men to be notified
of their dismissal by noon, thus prevent
ing them from reporting for afternoon
and evening duty at 2 o'clock, the usual
time. At dress parade, a few minutes
after 6 o'clock, as the corps is assembled
on the grounds, the cadet adjutant will
read out the sentences, including, besides
the five dismissed, six men suspended.
The expulsion of five cadets at one time
for disciplinary reasons is without parallel
In the history of the academy. The au
thorities regret the necessity far such
drastic action, but they feel that it is an
essential to the well-being of the acad
emy. Of course the cadets are said to
have been implicated in the demonstra
tion against Colonel Mills. Five were ac
cused of conceiving and leading it, twen
ty-five of actual participation and eighty
three were declared to be partlceps crlm
inis, in that they aided and abetted the
deed by encouraging shouts, and cheers.
The five chief offenders accused are re
ceiving the most severe penalty. Only
six of the second-class offenders are being
punished now, leaving nineteen of those
thus accused to be tried.

GOLDEN JUBILEE
OF UNIVERSITY
yÂ«N AKLAND, May 2Lâ The retire
fi \\ ment of George Estes, chairman
II JJ of the Southern Pacific system
division of the Order of Railway
Telegraphers, and B. A. Myers,
secretary of the division, was not volun
tary, though resignations prepared by the
two are now on their way to Grand Presi
dent Dolphin at St. Louis. Before the res
ignations arrived Grand President
Dolphin removed both of the Pacific Coast
officials. The actual reason for the dif
ferences between Estes and Dolphin Is
the refusal of the Order of Railway Teleg
ruphers to recognize the new general or
der of railway men known as the United
Brotherhood of Railway Employes.
Estes possesses great ability as an_or;
gauizer, and has taken much interest in.
tho organization of the new general order
of railroad employes. This was not pleas
ing to the officers of the Order of Rail
way Telegraphers, and a few weeks ago
â¢Dolphin himself made a trip to San Fran
cisco to look into this very matter. He
returned to the headquarters of the order
in St. Louis without taking any action,
and the removal of Estes was of recent
date.
A dispatch from St. Louis, sent out
through the regular news channels of the
Associated Press, tells the story of the
removal of Estes and Myers without
mentioning their names. This dispatch
rends:
President M. M. Dolohln of the Order of Rail
way Telegraphers, â¢aho has just returned to the
headquarters of that organization from a busi
ness trip through the East, when shown a dis
patch statins that the Order of Railway Teleg
raphers is interested in the establishment of an
organization similar to the old American Rail
way Union on the Pacific Coast, said:
"The Order of Railway Telegraphers Is
neither officially nor otherwise connected with
euch a movement. It is true that two of our
local officials in San- Francisco were connected
with the movement, and they were removed
from office by me a few days ago on that ac
count. The plan of organizing all railway em
ployes into one organization is not feasible, and
it is my belief that it never will be. The old
class organizations which are now in .-exist
ence and have been for years have accom
plished great good for the railway employes,
and there is no reason why they cannot con
tinue to do so. I will reiterate that we have
not only not aided or abetted this new move
ment, but that we have not recognized It in
any way."
This is a plain statement coming
from the head of one of the strongest of
the railway orders. Taken together with
the announced removal of Estes and
Myers, It means that as far as the officials
of the Orders of Railway Telegraphers
are concerned they will not recognize the
new general railway order.
Estes has thrown himself bodily into tho
new order, and it remains to be seen
whether he can get the telegraphers into
It or whether the officers of the Order of
Railway Telegraphers can hold them to
the old organization. .
This will be an important railroad ques
tion, for the telegraphers are now very
Btrong. particularly on the Southern Pa
cific Company's system. Between San
Francisco and Portland on the north,
Stockholders of the Cramp , Company
will, it is said, have the option of taking
cash or exchanging 1 their holdings, share
for share, for a 7 per cent preferred stock
in the new company. There is $a.000,000
worth of Cramp stock and $15,000,003 cash
will be necessary to buy out Bethlehem..
PHILADELPHIA, May 21.â The Press
to-morrow will say: There Is little doubt
that the last obstacles In the way of the
Cramp - Vickers - Bethlehem combination
have been removed and that the official
announcement of tlio completion of the
arrangement is now a question of a few
houre only.
It was announced yesterday that the
Vickers Company had obtained an option
on the stock of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany at a price bordering: on 23. The op
tion is also said to include the Bethlehem
Iron Company stock at about the present
market price of C3.
In order to complete the transaction the
New York syndicate, which is to under
write the present combination, has been
compelled to raise about 515,000,000 In act
ual cash, as it is entirely a money trans
action, and fully that much will be re
quired to purchase the two Bethlehem
companies' stock. It will take $7,000,000 to
buy the Bethlehem steel stock.

When a person has used coffee for a
number of years and gradually declined
Jn health, it is time the coffee should be
left off In order to see Â¦whether or. not
that has been the cause of the trouble.
A lady in Huntsville, Ala., Mrs. S. M.
IJrazler, cays she used coffee for about
40 years, and for the past 20 years was
troubled with stomach trouble. "I have
been treated by many physicians, but all
in vain. Everything failed to perfect a
cure. Was prostrated for some time and
came near dying. When I recovered suf-
ficiently to partake of food and drink I
tried coffee again and it soured on my
stomach.
I finally concluded coffee was the cause
of ray troubles and stopped using' it. I
tried tea and then milk In its place, but
neither agreed with me, then I com-
menced using Postum Food Coffee. I
had it properly made and it was very
pleasing to the taste.
I have now used It four months and
my health is so greatly improved that I
can eat almost anything I want and can
Bleep well, whereas, tefore, I suffered for
years with Insomnia,
I have found. the cause of my troubles
and a way to get rid of them. You can
depend upon It I appreciate Postum."

Situation in Oakland.
OAKEAND,- May 21.â The machinists'
strike situation in Oakland is unchanged
to-day. Each side Is awaiting such moves
as may- be made in San Francisco, the
results - here practically depending upon
action across the bay. The molders and
coremakers were at -work to-day in the
shops, -and cannot strike unless orders
come from the Eastern headquarters. Un
ion pickets have been placed on duty at
the works affected. \ There will be no
places filled at the various works for, the
present at least. The employers are hope
ful that. a compromise may be reached,
although there is every indication that the
molders will Join the machinists. In that
event the several works will be compelled
to shut down. *V-
All houses who sign an agreement to
patronize only manufacturers who abide
by the rules of the association will be
furnished with union cards, which they
will be requested to display in a conspicu
ous place. The officers of the association
consist of I* ..Van Laak of the "Van Laak
Manufacturing Company, president, and
J. P. Henry of the California Broom Man
ufacturing Company, secretary and treas
urer. The companies comprising the asso
ciation are the Van 'Laak Manufacturing
Company, the California Broom Manufac
turing Company, Taylor Bros, and Zan
Bros. & Co. /
The broom makers of this city held a
meeting last night at 201S Howard street
and permanently organized themselves
into Â¦ a union under the name of the Cali
fornia Broom Manufacturers' Association
for protection against Chinese labor and
the prison labor of other States. By-laws
were adopted pledging the members of
the association not to deal with any mer
chant, wholesale or retail, who carried in
his stock goods not bearing the label of
the International Broom Makers' Union.
The broom makers were also bound not
to patronize or to employ Chinese 'under

Interesting Report of the

Order.
Nine Circles "Were Instituted
and Two Suspended
Last Year.
The Rrand officers and delegates to the
Grand Circle of the Companions of the
Forest. A. O. F., went out on a trolley
ride yesterday morning and did not return
until late, consequently there was but a
short session in the afternoon.
A resolution was adopted granting to
social members who became - such prior
to May, 1S90, the right to funeral benefits
the same as beneficial members.
The grand organist was by. vote added
to the executive board. . " " Â»
A vote of thanks was passed to Max
Boehm past grand chief companion, for
many sen-ices rendered to the order. Â¦
Grand Chief Mrs. M. E. Falconer In her.
report says: â¢_ :
It affords me much pleasure to report that
our order has done fairly well during the past
year. As a rule harmony has reipned through
out our Jurisdiction. As In my pervious term.
I have not hesitated to enforce "order and
decorum" whenever I deemed It necessary for
the best interests of our beloved order. In
three Instances I found it necessary to
use the "weedinsr out process" with exce.Ient
results, getting rid of an element among
whom "discord and strife" was omnipresent.
In Franklin Circle No. 115 one offending
member was brought before the board of final
arbitrators and by a. verdict of said board ex
pelled from this order. Â¦ â ' -
In Pride of the Forest Circle No. 122 I found
much discord and detailed a special deputy for
the circle, under whose guidance the circle
has become harmonious and prosperous.
In Loyal Circle No. 1T9 I found It necessary
to suspend the circle, reinstate the law-abiding
members and bring the offending ones to trial
before the final arbitrators, all of whom have
been duly expelled, and Loyal Circle is now
less Jn membership, but Infinitely ricner In
peace, hannony and fraternity.
With the exception of these Instances the
order is in thorough concord and hannony.
During the past year S69 candidates were
lr.Jtlated as members of this order. Nine new
circles were instituted and two were sus
pended, and 604 members were either suspended
or expelled, leaving a net gain of over 265
members and seven circles for the year ending
March SI. 1901: 125 members have been ini
tiated since that date, making a total gain
From the reports of the supreme secretary
3-cu will eee that the funds of our subordinate
circle e have increased in a satisfactory man
ner, and that our financial standing Improves
m each year rolls by. At our previous^ cession
the total funds ot our various circles amounted
to the sum of-rrS10 6S; at this time the total
funds amount to J896S 67, showing an increase
of J11R7 99 for the year.
Durlne the past term fourteen claims have
been paid from this fund. Its management
and benefits have given entire satisfaction
throughout the order and I see no necessity
for any change in its laws.
In the evening the grand officers, dele
gates and members of the order enjoyed
a night at the Central Theater.
To-day the election for grand officers
will take place.
EXPRESSMAN WOLF TO
LOSE HIS PROPERTY
Sis Horses and "Wagron Seized . for
Confiscation and Sale Under
the I/aw.
J. W. Wolf, the aped expressman who
was acquitted last Monday of the charge
of smuggling a trunk containing opium
into Mrs. Tapley's lodging-house. 217
Stockton street, is a victim of circum
stances and although undoubtedly inno
cent will be likely to lose his two-horse
team and wagon.
' His accuittal on the criminal charge
does not tret him out of his troubles, for.
under the provisions of the United States
statutes on the subject of smuggling,
United States District Attorney Wood
worth will be obliged to institute, civil
proceedings for the confiscation Â«->f the
team and wagon. The guilt or innocence
of the owner of the ship or other vehicle
in which smuggled goods are transported
is not material to the issue, the law pro
viding that such vehicles shall be seized
and sold for the benefit of the Govern
ment. While his horses and wagon are
in the custody of the Federal ofllcials
Wolf is deprived of his only means of
support. In ord*>r to relieve the old man's
necessity Mr. Woodworth has consented
to ask the Secretary of the Treasury to
allow Mr. Wolf to rive bonds and use
his team and wagon until the confiscation
proceedings shall have been ended.
