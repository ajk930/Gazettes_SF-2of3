MEMBERS OF CONVENTION TO ENJOY
AN OUTING ON BAX THIS AFTERNOON
Continued on Page Three.
There are two types of financiers, gentlemen.
Ab a layman In such matters I may. have an
opinion about financiers. There Is the destruc
tive financier and there is the constructive
financier, whom we have here with us to-day,
and I count myself privileged to speak In his
behalf of one who has touched nothing that he
has not re-created, enlarged, made strong and
beneficent, and whose relations, in the ruture
history of finance in the whole world, and I
venture to say the supreme characteristic, are
theee things which belong to the foundations of
a 'great estate and a great civilization. And I
am sure that you will Join with me in appre-
Gentlemen: I wish it was In my power to
tell you half of what I feel. I said to Mr.
Crocker, my host this evening, when he epoke
about the dinner, J'l will dine with the gen
tlemen with great pleasure provided there is no
epeechmaking." I never was known to make
a speech in my life. I do not know what to
say except that I feel that I must tell you
how much I appreciate all that he has said.
The General Convention to which he has
alluded is not composed solely of laymen.
(Laughter.) We have got Borne clergymen
and what is more we have got eome Bishops,
and at the last moment when I thoueht all
hope was removed I saw the Bishop of New,
York enter the door. He will attend to th*
speechmaklnr for me, and consequently you
can iroajrlne all that I would say. but you
cannot Imagine all that I feel, and I call upon
the Bishop of New York to say what probably
I would say if I had the ability.
Bishop Potter accepted the responsibil
ity thus placed upon him. He said:
Mr. Host and Gentlemen: So far as I know
I cee no reason why I ahould preach for Mr.
Morgan. Nothing could be more unnecessary,
.gentlemen. I am sure, than that either he or
I should make any extensive remarks in re
uponne to the toast which has been offered by
my host. Mr. Crocker. I am sure I may ven
ture to i>ay for him, as I may venture to say
for my episcopal brethren who are here to
night, how we have been touched by the wel
come whlcM San Francisco has given us. I do,
not think that In the history or the General
Conventions of the Episcopal church there has
ever been anything like It. Never. has there
been such a missionary meeting as was held
the other evening at the great Mechanics' Pa
vilion.
"William H. Crocker In a few appropri
ate words epitomized the reason, of the
banquet and called upon J.; Pierpont Mor
gan for a few remarks. A short response
followed by the great financier, who Im
mediately switched the burden of speech
upon Bishop Potter of New York. Mr.
Morgan said:
ments In the realm of finance tand his
work in the fields of charity.
Xot one of the guests could help re
marking the beauty_ of the decorations.
As they sat down to' the dinner the first
thought in the minds of all was the ar
tistic and decorative effects of the table.
Two horseshoes with ends joined together
was the shape of the table and all the
central portion was solid. But for the line
of plates all- was flowers, grapevines and
fruitâ the choicest of chrysanthemums
and the finest quality of the fruit that
California could produce: Depending and
radiating from the central chandelier was
a preen bamboo plant. On the walls were
Indian maize, vines and flowers of every
description. The room was a bower.
The dinner hour had been set for 7, but
it was some time later before, the guests
filed Into the banquet hall to take their
appointed places. With a hearty and a
courteous welcome the host of the even
ir.g bade his friends be- seated. Then
tame course after course and the merry
click of glasses and the conversational
rallies that make sauce and condiment to
the best of dinners. And then the speeches
Jind the parting handshakes.
SOME OP THE SPEAKERS.
J. Pierpont Morgan did not pay much,
lie simply thanked one and everybody
nnd then dr legated Bishop Potter to play
the eloquent for him. The Bishop re
rponded with sentiment, eulogy and
\u25a0tOTT. Both college presidents. had their
Ting at the came of speech. President
.Wheeler talked of the wonderful possi
bilities of development along Pacific
Khorts: President Jordan on California
climate, hospitality end greatness. The
nishops of Massachusetts, Kentucky and
South Carolina departed from the
strained seriousness and entertained all
with genuine after-dinner speeches. -Gen
eral Barnes, eloquent and grave, spoke of
the greatness of financiers and how their
charity toward men Is the charity which
makes men self-dependent. Irving M.
Scott dwelt upon the "Iron girders
that hold up nations and make brothers
of us all." And so they went on, now
nnd then paying a compliment to State
end nation and a laudation to the guest
cf the evening for his wonderful achieve-
BEAUTY OF DECORATIONS.
JPIERPOICT MORGAN has
been socially entertained In
San Francisco. He was the
guest of honor at a banyuet
9 in the Paclflc-TTnlon Club last
nigrht. TVUllasx: H. Crocker^
was the host Bishops and
clergymen. Eastern visitors and promi
nent local citizens, men on the higher
rungs of professional, commercial and in
dustrial life made up the gathering.
ICo fault could be found with the menu.
The decorations reached the limit of
artistic excellence, the appointments were
perfect and the speeches that shortened
tiro hours ran a gamut from light witti
cisms to the heavy problems of religion,
education and finance.
Gathered round the fruit and flower
bestrewn table were some of the biggest
men in America to-day. First there was
the guest of the evening, J. Pierpont Mor
gan, and his personality furnished the
theme' of every speech and dominated the
tone of the entire banquet. Then there
v.ere College Presidents Benjamin Ide
Wheeler and David Starr Jordan; Bishops
of New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky
and South Carolina; distinguished law
yers from many Eastern States, and our
own big men. Many of them had their
cay. and they spoke well, some eloquent
ly. Over the coffee and through the
wreaths of cigar smoke the flow of rea
son mounted higher and higher. And it
was a social feast, too, and will mark a
high place in Pacific-TJnion affairs for
many a day to come.

This resolution was sent to the committee

Men of brilliant attainments took part
in the debate, arguing for and against the
proposition that the Episcopal church
should forbid Its clergy to remarry di
vorced persons.
At the close of the afternoon session
the subject had not been voted upon, and
it will come up for further discussion
next Monday morning.
The House of Deputies was called to

After the reading of the minutes for the

mittees.
Deputy Lewis of Pennsylvania offered

the Episcopal General Conven
tion entered on the second day's debate
on the subject. Every seat on the floor
of the church was taken and the galleries
were filled with hundreds of womenârela
tives of the deputies and visitors.
THE all important question of
marriage and divorce served to_

DIVORCE DEBATE BEGEMS.
Deputy Lswis of Pennsylvania, the lead*
er of the debate, then read the section of
the canon requiring the officiating cler
gyman at a marriage to record the aga
of the contracting parties.
The Rev. Mr. Martin of Texas convulsed
the committee and the well filled galleries
by. making an earnest plea against the*
section, on the ground that it was not
fair to ask a woman her age and that to
do so provoked falsehood. The speaker
offered an amendment, which was defeat
ed amid much laughter.
The Rev. Dr. Moore of West Virginia
offered an amendment " to the section re
quiring that the signatures of the con
tracting parties to a marriage be placed
on the church record. After many depu
ties had spoken on the subject the amend
ment, was. put to a vote and defeated by
217 noes .to 106 ayes.
Paragraph 3 of section 3 of the canon
was then carried by a. vote of 270 ayes to
41 noes.-. The paragraph is as follows:
"No minister shall solemnize a marriage
except in the presence of at . least two
witnesses, nor,* in case the parties are un
known to the "minister, without the pres
ence of witnesses to whom the parties ara
personally known, unless in the judgment
of the minister it shall be impracticable
to obtain such witnesses."
Deputy Lewis of Pennsylvania read sec
tion 4 of the canon, which particularly
prohibits the remarrfage of divorced perÂ»
sons, and asked for Its acceptance.
The much talked of section is as fol
lows:
a ."No minister shall solemnize a mar
riage between any two persons unless, nor
until, 1 by inquiry he shall have satisfied
himself that neither person is the hus
, band or the wife of any other person then
alive or has been the husband or the wife
of any other person then living, unless
the former marriage was annulled by the
decree of some civil court of competent
jurisdiction for cause existing before tae
former marriage." â¢
In explaining the section Deputy Lewis
said:
* Mr.' Chairman, the provision speaks for
itself. At a proper stage of the debate I
may have something to say upon It. but
I only desire to make one statement In
response to numerous questions which
have been asked me as to the purport of
this amendment, and I simply wish to
say that it Is not a proposition to stop or
forbid the marriages of anybody.
"That is a matter over which we have
no control whatsoever. It Is a matter for
the state and any action that may bo
taken In that regard would be entirely
ultra vires and void. It is a proposition
only to forbid >the ministers of this church
from solemnizing a certain class of mar
riages. That's all there Is to It and let it
not be misunderstood."
RIO minister shall solemnize a marriage between any two persons unless
iff nor until, by inquiry, he shall have satisfied himself that neither per
son is the husband or wife of any other person then living, or has been the
husband or the wife of. any other person then living; unless the former
marriage was annulled by a decree of some civil court of competent juris
diction for cause existing before such former marriage. â Section of Canon
on Divorce 1h.it is the subject of deb lie in the convention.
rHEH what is the great charity ? The great charity for the coming cen
tury is that which shall make it possible for a man io live, to support
his wife and educate his children without reliance upon anything else but
God and himself. That time is coming and wa shall make it. We have
75,000,000 of people in this country to-day. They cannot all be manufac
turers. 7 he bulk of thejn must live by the land and on the land. â Excerpt

ELOQUENCE OF ORATORS APPLAUDED
Continuing the Rev. Mr. Battle said: "I
desire that this church Fhould set an example
to the citizens of the United States -of all
churches of all denominations. I believe that
we should try to constitute ourtelves leaders
on this Question. And if we do not adopt this
canon as sent down from the House of Bishops
we would make a very great if not a fatal
mistake. I believe that If we adopt this canon
we will take a step that wll! enable us in
the end to bring about uniformity of the laws
of the United States in regard - to marriage
and divorce. I believe that this legislation is
such as is suited to the people of t^e United
States nnd as is consistent with the Chris
tianity of. the. United States.
"What was the law when our Savior spoke
Deputy Lewis in reply said: "In reply to
the \u25a0 gentleman from North Carolina I would
ask whether he does not think the committee
has covered his objection in the canon they
have proposed and in the portion of which It
is left intact by the amendment of the rev
erend deputy from New York. The word
'other' in ~the third line before -'persons' was
Inserted there for that purpose. They are for
bidden to marry any one who has been, the
husband or wife of any other person then liv
ing. If they have been the husband or wife
of some person â¢ there Is -no objection* and it
was put there for that purpose."
The Rev. Mr. Battleâ I believe in leaving
nothing to construction that can be avoided
by the enactment that is made at the time
the legislation i% desired and therefore I see
no. objection to adding the words that are In
the present canon on the subject of marriage
and divorce.
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the con
vention: I have drawn an amendment to. this
clause under consideration in almost the exact
terms of those offered by the deputy from New
York. I will aek to add to his amendment
the words 'nor to the remarriage of parties
once divorced, peeking to be united again.' " ,
The new Mr. Battle of North Carolina said
"So much of this amendment, sir, as is
new and not contained in the form sub
mitted by the committeeâ so much of my
amendment as is new is not my own, but
the work of a former member of this
houpe, 2Â»Ir. Miller of Georgia, who is not
in attendance here because of duties in
the Supreme Court at Washington. Mr.
Miller was a member of the committee
appointed by this house to deal with this
subject, and the view which holds. and
which I share is embodied by his own
hands in the amendment which I have
now offered.
"With respect to the legal merits of it
I shall 'have nothing to say. for there are
many on this floor far more competent to
speak upon that point, but I should like
very briefly to state my argument on the
main principles involved and which I be
lieve to be unanswerable.
"It is admitted by all that our Lord
Jesus Christ in his utterances on the sub
ject of marriage and divorce spoke of one
exception to tne rigid law which he laid
down, and I do not raise the point as to
interpretation of the exceptions, but make
the single point that our Lord Jesus
Christ in his own legislation admitted the
exception of one exceptional case. â¢
"How can that be met by the friends of
this measure? Only by discrediting the
record. Only by raising the question of a
higher criticism, and if that question be
raised there will be scholars enough to
meet it. I may remark in passing that It
is a little singular that the opposition of
our existing legislators on this subject
should come from a person who lost no
opportunity to disparage higher criticism?
whereas when it comes to the issue the
only way in which the legislation which
they propose can be adopted "is by meth
ods of higher criticism. -
"Our Lord Jesus Christ admitted one
exception to his rigid law of marriage,
therefore any legislation by this church
which does not admit one exception to the
rigid law of marriage Is not and cannot
be in accordance with tha mind of Jesus
Christ."

"Mr. Chairman' and members of the com
mittee: There is no doubt-in -my mind- that
there is no subject of greater importance that
Is- to come.br that can* come before' this Gen
eral Convention. I find myself Interested In
The Rev. Dr. Greer of New York; who Is In
favor of prohibiting remarriage of divorced per
sons, then addressed. the committee as follows:
Who is to determine the. Innocence! of the
party? It not?unfrequently happens that both
parties are guilty and that there is collusion
between the parties. How are \u25a0 you goins to
meet that case by a certified copy of any
record? How is it possible to meet that case
by the production of the record of a civil
court? You can't -do it.- If there be -collusion
between the one will be found guilty,
of course, if the divorce be granted, but only
inferentlally. The other party Is, Innocent.
Whereas, In. case of collusion they are equally
in guilt. I claim therefore that if you Intro
duce any exception to that universality of this
iuIo you largely destroy the purposes to be
accomplished by the section. "
I claim that it Is" better and safer to let
the section stand as It is. It may be we will
work individual hardship in pome cases, but in
the lone run it will conduce to the welfare ef
the community, it will be for the protection
of the clergy and It will advance the inter
ests of religion on all sides.; Unaer the -pres
ent condition of things they no doubt for the
moment had In vieW the laxity in relation to
marriage and. divorce. What is called__holy
matrimony is now only too often a \u25a0 contract
of convenience between' the parties, ' more or
less temporary in its nature. \u25a0_>
T>H. GBEEB/S ARGUMENT. :
Of what shall that consist? Shall it con
sist of a certified copy of the decree? Why,
as stated by the deputy who last. spoke (the
Rev. Mr. Battle), in many cases decrees do not
disclose the precise ground "on which thi di
vorce has-b.een granted. A libel for divorce
may set forth various grounds and the decree
in some, of the States la siinply that a divorce
a vinculo matrimoniae ba granted. Of course,
all these discussion's I am referring to are of
absolute divorces and not merely divorce from
bed and board. ' '
Now it is proposed in suostance to amend
the section by excepting the case, of an inno
cent party to a divorce on the ground of adul
tery. Who Is to ascertain the fact of the. Inno
cence? Will It appear by the record? Certainly
the ministers of this church have no authority
'at their own instance to institute an inquiry
which might lead to a satisfactory, determina
tion cf the fact. They, are without power to
summon and examine witnesses, bo- it goes
without fraying 'that lt-the innocence of the
parties is to be established at all, it must be
established by evidence, as the lawyers say,
aliunde. â¢ â¢ .
In particular cases, but because individual
hardships may result from the application of
a general rule, no argument is furnished
against the propriety of that law. If it be
calculated to do good to the greatest number.
If it promote the general welfare we rest con
tent with It.
Undoubtedly the ; universality of the pro
hibition is contained in the. section as re
po-ted from the House of Deputies will, in
my judgment, in certain cases, work a hard-
Ship, for I do not, as I have already stated,
entertain the ideas entertained by a great
many of the delegates here present. But shall
individual hardshin practically defeat in large
measure the beneficial results which will
enure from the universality of the rule? I
claim not.
MINISTERS LACK . AUTHORITY^
The Rev. Dr. MeKltn of Washington, who
favored the amendment of Dr. Huntington,
said:
"Mr. President and gentlemen of the commit
tee: I rise to speak upon this subject under
a very solemn sense of responsibility. It has
been truly said that no question that is to
come before us. or that can come before us.
is more important. . >'
"I desire at the outset to express my deepest
sympathy with the motive that lies behind the
canon that has been proposed to us and that
has come down from the House of Bishops. I
sympathize profoundly with the motive which
Is intended to guard the purity of the family,
which is intended to* check the vast and grow
ing evils of divorce In our land. But. Mr.
President. I differ in toto from the committee
In regard to the measure \u25a0 which they \u25a0 propose,
as I do not believe it will accomplish the ends
that they propose. I believe so strongly that
it Is a measure fraught- with evil to this
church, not only in itself, but in its relation
ship to the people of the land, and if there were
no other voice in this convention to rise and
oppose it. mine should be that voice.
"Now, sir, I beg to call your attention: first,
to the fact that this proposed legislation is
revolutionary. For ICO years it has been the
privilege of the clergy of this church to offi
ciate at' the marriage of an Innocent party
in the case of divorce for adultery. The prac-
I tice, the principles, the usage of the church,
â¢for 100 years, is now proposed to be over
turned, and in Justification of that statement
I have only to point to you the language used
by a member of the committee himself.
"I mean the Rev. Dr. Fulton, who said that
this legislation Is along the lines of discipline
of the Western church: that iÂ« to say. the
church of Rome. - I object again to this be
cause It brings into this church the doctrine
upon the subject of marriage which belonged
distinctively to the church of Rome. We had
yesterday tbe 'BlshcD of Rome' upon our
floor \u25a0 That was something- to laugh at be
cause of a mistake, but to-day, in this propo
sition, we have the spirit and the teachings
and: the discipline of the Church of Rome in
very deed and truth.
\u25a0 "The Church of Rome teaches that marriage
is absolutely indissoluble. This church has
never taught it. Now this is a proposition that
we shall change our position upon that point
so that marriage is absolute and under no cir
cumstances indissoluble.
"I would like at once then to come to the
question. What is the teaching of our divin*
Lord? The reason why I object to this legis
lation, the reason why I feel so profoundly
upon It, the reason why I would not dare to
vote for such a proposition as this, ia because,
in my opinion, this is in direct contravention
of the teachings <ef holy Scripture and the
authority of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
and of the authenticity of the records of the
holy Gossel. I believe that it would be one
of the gravest possible errors that this church
could v possibly make.
"Let me first, briefly and hastily as possible
direct your attention to what the real evi
dence of holy- Scripture Is upon this subject.
Our Lord spoke about this upon three occasions.
Two of them are mentioned in Matthew and
one in St. Luke. St. Mark mentions) one which
is one of those mentioned by St. Matthew."*
"In two of the cases upon which our Lord
spoke lie made that one exception to the.indis
solubility of marriage. Now it is said that
St. Paul has spoken in the seventh chapter of
Romans and seventh chapter of First Corin
thians and says nothins about an eruption,
but it did come to pass that a statement
of our Lord was to bÂ« subjected to the exten
uation of an exception. Our Lord in St Mat
thew in those two places states the law and the
exception. St. Paul states the law without
mentioning the exception. . . -
"Now. Mr. President, my opinion, â¢ of course,
will not weigh much upon this subject, but â¢ I
venture to .' direct attention to the opinion
of one whose authority will. I think, be recog
nized. I hold In my hand the clerical confirm

nothing to complain of but your own nature.
For me. I am nre everywhere and always.'
"Social righteousness Is illustrated au<l
taught in that great divine development and
altering of society as illustrated and taught
as I think by the sovereign lord of the world.
Social righteousness may burn and destroy here
and there and work social hardship, but it is
social righteousness always and everywhere.
I believe, gentlemen, that it : Is the duty . of
the church to take action in this matter. The!
question Is. what action? Shall it .apply- a
general rue? Or shall it apply a rule subject
to exceptions, which will partially neutralize
and defeat the rule itself? I am In favor of
the universality of the. prohibition in all cases
of divorce, no matter what may. be' the cause,
for the simple reason that In my Judgment no
other view, no other law, is practicable and
can work satisfactorily. We all know that
most general laws work individual hardships
I believe that the situation confronting us Is
one . which demands of us some \u25a0 action. -It
seems to me that this question cannot be de
cided by merely theological arguments. We
all know that there are .very many learned
men who differ on- this subject. We cannot
expect them to agree. Now what Is our duty?

of this land. It menaces the purity and happi

civilization. I
Mr. Chairman,, gentlemen of the eommlttee^-
I sincerely trust that these amendments will
be defeated. I hope from the bottom of my
heart that section 4 as reported from the
House of Deputies will pars. I am not one of
those who believe that Holy Scripture forbids
the marriage of an Innocent party to a dU-orce
on the ground of infidelity during the lifetime
of his or her wife or husband. I do not enter
tain that belief, but equally. I do nof believe
â¢that Holy Writ contains a command or an in
junction that under all circumstances and re
gardless of tho conditions existing at the time,
a divorced person, though innocent, must be
married and must receive what he is entitled
to have, the ceremony performed and solemn
ized by the ministers of this church. -
Judge Bradford of Delaware, .. United States
District Court Judge of Delaware, then ad
dressed the committee as follows:
"I know that It is natural for this church,
refined and educated, to desire j to stand upon
a higher plane than any other Christian body
can stand, but let us not take an impracticable
step. Let us take a step In which we will be
accompanied by the best people of this country
in all churches of any and all denominations."
The Rev. Elder of South Virginia stated that
he was in sympathy with the amendment but
deemed the language not sufficiently compre
hensive and that the evidence of- adultery
should be sought in the records of the court
rather than upon the face of the decree, etc.
"My only object is to enlarge the means or
the way by which the ground or cause of di
vorce Is to be ascertained," he said.

"What did our Savior say when they asked
him the question,. 'What shall be done with
this woman who was taken in the act?' He
replied, 'Let he who is without sin among you
throw the first Btone at her.' \u25a0 What sin had
the man done? Why, the sin which they
charged her with being, guilty of. Nobody
doubted that or can doubt '. it who . reads it
with understanding. He didn't pardon her sin.
He didn't condemn her to death. This is what
he said to. the woman: 'Has no man con
demned thee? Neither do I condemn thee. Go,
and sin no more. 1
to his disciples on this question? It was .that
a woman guilty of adultery should die. That,
of. course, would end the marriage. Isn't that
so? And if he said nothing about the adultery
of men it was because he was not laying
down laws inconsistent with those of the Jews
then in existence. The laws of the Roman
empire were then in the ascendant. The very
laws to which these people allude who asked
him these questions admitted polyaramy. At
man was allowed to have a plurality of wives.
"The teachings of our LÂ»rd and Savior
Jesus Christ laid down such 'principles of
morality, such principles of relistlon and of
virtue as have educated the people of all civ
ilized countries to the point at which we stand
to-day: Women of his day were but little bet
ter than servants. Men were their masters.
Why say that a woman guilty of adultery
that her husband should be divorced when the
law was that she should die, to end the mar
-riase in that way? . .

no one more. clearly. cr better than I, that in
some instances It will work hardship. Of

"And, sir, I believe further that this is the
teaching of our divine - Lord upon the subject.
Every one, of course, is responsible to his own
intelligence and to his own conscience in the
interpretation of the teaching of our Lord. I
believe, that the purport of his teaching is to
lay the stress not only upon the indissolubility
of the family, but upon the spirituality of the
family relation. To, dissolve that relation is
to 'disintegrate that unity. It seema to me
implicitly recognized that it Is a. physical re
lation and not a spiritual relation. It is a
spiritual relation into which a man and woman
enter. A spiritual relation In the midst of a
physical environment like the soul in the midst

question, where he tells us that during the
recent year more divorces were granted in
this country than In all the countries of Eu

the past twenty years, as he says, the popu

of 60 per cent, the divorces during that period

"All these men agree in saying that in case

the responsibility of opposing the judgment of

Judgment in the Engllsh-speakins . world in
the nineteenth century, is very great indeed.

upon man than to study the history and watch
the career of those we knew when he and
they were boys, when the shadows of life, its
struggles, its anxieties, its successes and Its
failures have overshadowed them. I have tha
advantage, I think, of every one of the gen
tlemen sitting about this 'table, because I knew
the distinguished guest of the evening when he
was a boy.
Mr. Morgan was a quiet, refined, delicately
sensitive young man, and he began life when?
his great father left off. Taught In his school,
inspired by his example, his father lived to
see him a crown in the occupation . of his
choice, a power for good wherever he went,
useful not merely In the higher walks of
finance, not merely the strengthener of the
national credit and the upholder of the na
tional power, but dealing with everything from
great questions of finance to the building of
the Columbia that has kept the cup of the
America still upon American noil.
The history of this last century has been a
wonderful one. The history of this century will
be more wonderful still. The last century has
demonstrated that this nation is one and in
divisible. It has made forever an end of human
slavery. It has developed the high energies of
a great and prosperous people, and the problem
of the coming century will be the development
of that which Is the highest and best charity,
what is beet for man to . do for man bo that
Industrial excitement shall no longer exist, that
commerce shall not be paralyzed by strikes,
ships will not be tied to wharves and bands of
marauders beat the shape of God's image out of
those who desire employment. The time is at
hand when these questions and that higher
charity will find it* development.
In many respects the American people is
the most charitable people the world has ever
known. I remember not long since reading
that the individual charities of the men of
wealth in America, not counting sums less than
$5000, for nine years ending the commencement
of this year, given for private charity, amount
ed to $300,000,000. If you add to that the benefi
cence of the Government toward the men who
suffered and fought that this nation might be
preserved it rises to the thousands of millions,
runs up into the uncountable and unmeasure
able billions of valuation. In future all chari
ties must end. and if they end they must be
repeated. If our great friend here to-night
were to take his fortune and divide it up
among the people of the country, in a few
months it would all be spent and the work
all have to be done . over again. . .
CHARITY IS RELIANCE.
Then what is the great charity? The great
charity for the coming century is that which
shall make It possible for a man to live, that
shall make it possible for him to live, to sup
port his wife and educate his children without
reliance upon anything else but God and'him
self. That time is coming and we shall make
It. We have 75,000,000 of people in this coun
try to-day. Before long we shall have 100,000.000
to 125,000,000. They cannot all be manufacturers
and the bulk of them must take up the land
and live by the land and on the land. Crops

The Bishop of South Carolina, after a
happy speech, concluded with this bit of
sentiment which won him hearty ap
plause:
I want to assure you, gentlemen of Califor
nia, that there is in South Carolina a very sin
cere and a very earnest and a very growing
eentiment of love and reverence and respect for
this great country of ours. It is my duty to say
that I believe that the late President of the
United States, honored be his memory, as glo
rious was his character, has done more for the
people of the South, more for my dear people
in helping us to a sincere, self-respecting, con
scientious respect for the stars and stripes and
the Government that overcame us, the Govern
ment that persuaded us as he would have it,
persuaded us by an affectionate assimilation in
arms to be one â and I assure you, gentlemen,
that there is in South Carolina to-day as faith
ful and as sincere and as loyal a purpose and
determination to be true to this country as
there was some years ago as faithful and loyal
a determination to be faithful to the Southern
Confederacy.

It is a pleasure and a privilege to welcome
under this roof men of such high endeavors
and particularly to welcome here members of
a profession too seldom represented in an au
dience of this kind, and their presence reminds
us of the fact that more than a century ago
men also inspired by religloua zeal sought this
shore. They broke the silence . in -which this
land â¢ had been slumbering and they laid the
foundation. We may then hope that this new
race of men equally earnest and striving to
wards the same ends may bring to that prog
ress a new birth and new impulse, and It Is p.
happy omen for the fulfillment of that hope
that the foremost man in America's industries
finds the time and inclination to come here
and share in the consideration and solution or
the moral and religious problems of our daily
life. Gentlemen, we cannot fail to feel the
better for your comins.

That respect which California has shown in
very hisli degree for education augurs well
for a return to solid foundations for respect
for order. It is out of schools and universities
that will come that sense of obedience which
will make anarchy impossible and which will
make respect for order the very foundation of
life. (Apnlause.) The best thing our schools
and universities can teach, the first thing they
must teach, is respect for order.

been made fit to live as members of the

We welcome these guests here to us becauÂ»e
they represent a standing order. California
can we!! afford to take into itself a larger.
reFpect for things that have stood among
men and have stood the tesj. of time, the test
of experience. We can very well afford to in
fuse into our life a larger reverence, a finer
obedience toward things that are permanent,
firm and noble.
Out of respect for lire ae historically consti
tuted crows that orderliness of life which
makes life economical, which makes life pro
ceed without waste, which gives life its ef
fectiveness, its charm, the love of life, oppor
tunity and fulfillment and makes life worth
living.
Wo have had enough of disorder to disre
spect all forms of lawlessness. We have had
enough of disorder to welcome whatever repre
sents the solid historic order of our social ex
istence.
AVe are out here in the Far West in one
sense far away from the centers of historic
order, and we welcome here a body that rep
resents a standing order, that order in life,
that reverence for things that were and for
life that is historically constituted out of which
can spring the highest effectivenessâ freedomâ
and freedom that is anchored in respect for
the established order is the freedom that glv^s
life effectiveness.

devotion and high ideas In finance which are
illustrated in your guest to-night.
I aeked one of his children some time ago to
tell me about the father. She said that when
he was at home he almost always read. She
said: "When he is entirely at leisure he reads
the old convention journals." What Is it that
he finds jntere^ting- in the old convention jour
nals? I have reached the conclusion that he
Keeks them as a mode of repose. (Laughter.)
I believe myself that is the explanation. He
finds it a soothing atmosphere and - one that
does net greatly tax his intellectual resources.
When I went to Grace Church last Sunday
and saw the collection, after the service,
brought into the vestry room, one of
the wardens held up the considerable
coin, a penny. He said: "We don't get that
sort of coin here, only when you Eastern people
come." Well, gentlemen, that Is the situation
to which we have been introduced by the en
ergy and aggressiveness of the West.
It has been suggested that Mr. Morgan might
decide to stay in San Francisco for the rest
of his life instead of living in New York. If
he does not I can assure you it will not be be
cause he doesn't want to.
ORDER AGAINST LAWLESSNESS.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the
University of California, was then called
upon. He said:
Mr. Host and Gentlemen: I am very proud
that I can stand up here this evening to
speak for California. I speak of it as if I
had made it. I speak of it with all the prida
and all tha enthusiasm of a new convert. We
are glad to welcome these guests among us.
I suppose, first of all, because we are so few
that we often get tired of each other, and tired
of each other's stqries and each other's
speeches, and we are glad to hear somebody
ftlFe talk. We are glad to welcome them among
us for what they represent.

EDUCATION IS THRIVING.
President Jordan of Stanford University
said in part:
Mr. Host and Gentlemen: I am cast to-night
in a very modest though a very pleasing^role,
which is my duty to express to our guests some
points or some pointers that may perhaps help
them in their future relations with California.
I am inclined to think that they are possessed
of strictly erroneous ideas In regard to the
climate of California.
As a friend of mine suggested. It is just as
well for men to get away <rom the idea that
every table in California Is set in just the
way this one is to-night. Our guests will find
when they stay in this city a short time that
It Is made up of hospitality and climate.
The measure of higher education to the square
inch in California is higher than anywhere else
in the world. You will find this State with a
scanty population of a million and a quarter of
people with D000 college students to-day.
The old Ideal. of the English universities has
been that of culture, to make Individual, cul
tured men, to raise men out of a class of com
mon men. It is a high ideal. The universities
of Germany find this a secondary matter, but
they ' have an Interest In other things. But
there is still another ideal which I think is
higher than any other, and that is the ideal of
effectiveness.
and violence has been suggested of
every sort, violent legislation and violent ac
tion, but after all when we come down to the
right all anarchy can be annulled only when
the sense of obedience toward the standing so
cial order Is inculcated In the children who
grow up to make the next generation. The
source of authority, the source of loyalty to
the existing order will be found always in fami
lies, and it is the family system that we must
stand loyally by. If we go at the right of the
matter we shall go into schools and we shall
establish In schools education, not in the know
ing of things, but In obedience to the author
ityf that inheres in the standing order, the
Ftajiding order of the family, the standing or
der of Christian society. We shall Inspire
their reverence for things that are fine and
noble, things that are high and holy and of
good repute.
You cannot separate from Inspiration religion.
No process that has been found yet can wring
out as water is wrung out of a cloth reverence
p.nd faith and belief in things noble. Our pub
lic schools may well avoid subservience to a
cultivation of things sectarian, things ecclesi
astical, but we have got to nave In our public
schpuls and In our universities as teachers men
who revere things noble, men wno nave faith In
things high, men who have faith in things be
hind the veil, and we in California rejoice to
have among us a body of men who stand for
the larger reverence which makes life solid and
gives us an anchorage before the sunrise and
behind the sunset. We are proud of California,
we are glad to have you here in order that you
may see It, see its abundance, see Its opportu
nities. We think we know what its opportunity
is. We are just waking up to know the full
ness of it. ' â¢
We have always talked about things in the
East as things "back East," and yet we have
not half lived up to our phrase "back East."
It is only In recent days- that we have really
come to believe what Bishop Potter eaid to
day at Berkeley, that San Francisco is the
front door of the continent. We need men
who can lead and bring men together. This
land of California Is all right If it can bring
out men who can join their hands together
and men who can lead them and who can
help. For after all it is not climate nor geo
graphy that makes a nation; it is the power
of joining men together. Yes, It Is righteous
ness that exalteth a nation and makes a peo-

MONSTER BE2TEITT
THURSDAY AFTERNOON"
Upon motion of Deputy Lewis of Pennsylva
nia the House of Deputies resolved itself Into a
committee of the whole to further consider the
canon on the solemnization of marriage and
divorce adopted by the House of Bishops. Chair
man Packard of the committee of the whole
A message from the House of Bishops. .was
announced and Secretary Harf entered - and
handed the nominations for Bishops to the new
dioceses created, as follows: To the missionary

A message was received from the House of
Bishops notifying that it had concurred in and
adopted proposed article 11 of the constitution;
and that It had disagreed to the ratification of
the proposed article V and the second part of
the proposed article X.
MESSAGE FROM BISHOPS.
When President Lindsay called the deputi/s
to order there was not a vacant seat in the
eacred edlflce.
Despite the heat, the House of Deputies was
crowded with visitors in the afternoon. The
galleries were filled to their utmost capacity by
the wives and daughters of the clerics and lay
men. The fair sex looked cool in their vari
colored shirt waists. There was a constant
flutter cf fans that made the scene an animated
one.
Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York
Delivers a Stirring Speech, in
Defense of Innocence.
DEBATE CONTINUES
AFTER NOON RECESS
Â£Â£ to our responsibility as clergymen of the
church. I want to say a word about that. I
believe that this proposition is really a propo
sition to nullify the teachings of Christ, to
nullify the authprity of the Matter and to
nullify the power and the force of those vows
which you and I have taken at the solemn
moment when we were ordained for the priest
hood. At that time we promised before God
fcnd his church that ve would so administer
end dispense to the church as Christ the Lord
liad commanded.
"Now you tell us that we must administer
cot according to the commandments of Christ,
but according to the teachings of this canon.
I want to ask you this: 'Am I to obey 'Christ
or the canon of the church; am I to ask this
of the Bishop?* It would be a very difficult
thing for the Bishop of that diocese to an
swer and decide that question. I earnestly hope
that some form cf amendment like- that which
I>r. Huntingdon has in its simple form pro
l>oeÂ»d, be adopted by this house.
"If this canon were passed I should so back
â¢to my home feeling that the church of my
Jove, that the church ol my reason, that the
churcn of my forefathers for 300 years has
lowerW the standard of Holy Scripture to a
etate no longer in the forefront and as pro
claiming that its teachings are based upon
the teachlcgs of filvine law and the Master
himself."
REV. PR. FISK'S ADDRESS.
The Rev. Dr. Fisk of Rhode Island was the
Jiext speaker. He said:
"We are not discussing a canon relating to
<iECipline of the members of this church or
the law of Christ, but we are discussing what
la expedient in the attitude of this church to
nard this great moral question.
"The eyes of the people of this whole coun
try are turned and have been turned for a long
time toward the Episcopal church when it
ehculd assemble to see and hear what it will
have to say in thi6 great question. If this
convention adjourns with the rejection of this
canon proposed the moral sense of the people
of this country will suffer from the blow."
The Rev. Dr. Packer of Long Island in part
paid:
speaking upon this question the gentle-
sa.id that he desired to test It by three
inTTgt:: First, does it answer the requirements
of ho'.y Scripture? Does it command the ascent
of the moral sense? Or is it an expedient to
meet the requirements of utility? First, has
it the sure warrant of holy Scripture? It
should have it. Now I want to know if thip
church can afford to go out into the world
with a car.on whose authority is doubtful. Can
we enact on this great and burning question a
canon that does not embody the mind of Jesus
Christ. I believe "that adultery is a deadly
thing. So deadly that it can disintegrate and
dissolve the marriage vow."
Tfce Rev. Dr. de Rosset of Springfield was
nexvi recognized. In part he said:
"Au-^ug other tMngs the gentleman said
IKat he or.ly wished to make one point, that
this was the question of the solemnization of
matrimony only. He called attention directly
to the words of the prayer book: "So long as
vp both ?hall live' and the words 'until death
us do part' and the wcrds 'let no man put
asunder.' This service ould not be used even
though the church may allow divorces for "cer
tain causes, or even thoueh certain lnterpreta
tÂ«ons of the word of God may be admitted.
This service cannot be used again if a person
who has a husband or wife still living is di
vorced for cause.
'This church is perfectly competent to pre
pare any service if it wishes so to do, but it
6ays r.ov.- that this service shall be used only
iur certain ceses and for no others."
WHAT CHRIST WOULD DO.
The Rev. Dr. Ashton of "Western New Tork
continuing the debate, said:
"The prayer book repeats and echoes the
jrreat law of Christ upon the indissolubilitv of
the marriage bond. The question before th's
house is. What is becoming- and what is right
in the case of a minister of this church who
"It is always, it seems to me, expedient,
and we are at all times at liberty to go to an
extreme for the sake of expediency. The third
ground for my change of attitude is that the
situation is absolutely so scandalous that we
must do something to influence public opinion."
The committee of the whole then reported
progress to the House of Deputies and an ad
journment was taken until 3 p. m.
Our Lord made one exception. He said- that
except for one cause there should be no di
vorce, but I take the ground that if our L,ard
were here to-day he would take a higher
ground and one for which the unity of mar
riage and for which the people would stand
here to-day." ....
I>R. FOLET DECLARES HIMSELF.
The Rev. Dr. Foley of Central Pennsylvania,
the last speaker before adjournment, said:
"Mr. Chairman, I have taken the floor to
declare myself upon this question a convert
since I came to San Francisco. When I came
here I was asking mj-self and others. the ques
tion whether we should take an extreme posi
tion upon this subject. One of the reasons for
my conversion Is that in conversation with dis
tinguished laymen of this convention I have
come to the conclusion that the great majority
of the laymen propose to vote in favor of this
fourth section as sent down to us by the House
of Bishops, and 1 cannot think that there will
be any greater misfortune than for the lay
men of this convention to propose a remedy for
this social evil than for the clergy and this
convention not to give their assent to this
canon.
Â« - . . \u25a0
may be called upon to solemnize by divine cere
mony this most sacred and divine act of matri
mony? I shall offer a resolution that before
we go into the vote upon this" particular section
that we respectfully request the president of
the House of Deputies to stand upon the pulpit
and offer a special prayer for divine guidance,
that when we come io cast our vote here it
may be for the glory of God and for the good of
man.
Contiaued From PagÂ« Two.
. "This is hot a liturgical refinement, and I
can justify it by an appeal to history. The
last speaker, or the last but one, called our
attention to the fact that in the days when
our Lord .was on the earth there were no
courts of divorce. Well, then was Christ de
fying the state? No; he was saying something
that the man who married the woman needed
to keep In mind, and which he alone was con
cerned to keep in mind. To him, he says,
therefore. 'What God hath Joined together let
no man," (let not you) 'put asunder." There
can be no other exegesis; it. is pure fact.
"I should like to use the few minutes remain
ing to me, if few minutes there be remain
ing, in disputing this assumption of the posi
tion of the Christian state as if It were some
thing alien from the church of God. No man
who takes that view of the matter has studied
his Bible or his prayer book, and especially
I say his prayer book, for in that book the
Institution of human society and of civil gov
ernment Is recognized Just as distinctly. Just
as clearly, I am. almost prepared to say more
distinctly and more clearly than the institu-
"We .-have had that referred to here as if this
were the church' shaking Its fist In the face of
the civil . power and defying it to do Its worst.
Who has not listened in the congregation when
holy, matrimony was being solemnized and
heard those words read in precisely that spirit?
I can show in a word or two that that is an
utter misconception of their purpose. They
are not addressed to the public at large; they
are not addressed to the congregations there
present; still less are they addressed to God's
institute, the state. They are addressed to the
parties concerned. - â¢ -
"Some years ago I received a. letter from an
eminent Presbyterian divine of liturgical ten
dencies who thought that he could improve on
the office of holy matrimony' in the prayer
book, and, knowing that I had taken an inter
est '.n such subjects, and being a ' personal
friend, he sent me a draft of his proposed ser
vice for. matrimony and wanted to know what
I thought of it; and one of the improvements
which he considered especially valuable" was
that he had transferred these words 'Those
whom God hath joined together let no
man put asunder,' from the place which they
ordinarily occupy in the office of the prayer
book . to the place between the announcement
to the congregation and the blessing.' That is
where it belongs, he said. Not at all; not at
all. .It is spoken- to. the parties, as you will
ses^by examining .the rubric, 'And-'after that
has .been said then shall: the ; minister speak
unto the company." - . â¢ \u25a0
\u25a0 "Now, sir. for the prayer book fallacies.
They are \u25a0 two. â¢ I may not have time to bring
them, out clearly, but I will do my best. The
first is with reference to that sentence in the
office of matrimony, 'Those whom God hath
Joined together; let no man put asunder.'
- "For the legal .'aspect of this question I am
well content to rest with what has already been
Eaid by. those -more competent to speak than
I.. I am glad to have heard the words of an
ex- Attorney General of the United States; I
am glad to have heard the words of a Judge
of the Court oÂ£. Appeals of the great State of
New York. It is not for me to attempt com-,
mentary upon what they have to tell us. They
have sided with- the- innocent party. I do not
yield for one moment to my eloquent and dear
friend, the rector of St. Bartholomew's, New
York, in zeal for. the' purity of the family and
the sanctity of the home. But. sir. I put as
high as any of these considerations justice to
the innocent. , , ... â¢.
."First, with -regard to the .innocent party.
I once heard an eminent divine of this church,
who has been active in this discussion, and
who. but' for my knowledge of his tender heart,
I should have, charged with cruelty for say-
Ing it, speak of the 'so-called Innocent party"
in this discussion. It reminded me. I confess,
of the famous expression used by a preacher
In his diatribe against modern science, when
he spoke of this- 'so-called nineteenth century.'

"There ' are : innocent persons, sir, in every
criminal case ,-involvIng other interests than
those of. the one, and I marvel that in thin
debate, where the lights of the law have given
"us of their wisdom, that it has not occurred to
any one ; of them to quote the maxim. 'It is
better that . ten \ gullty.jmen should escape" thai,
that one innocent man should suffer."
"In our "zeal for sanctity . let us not forget

to call attention to divers prayer book falla

who Is Innocent, the church has no censure to
place upon you.' We will reward such con
duct when a faithful son or daughter of the
church comes for its sanction, to tell them that

DEFINES THE SCTEHPTXJRES:
Rev. Dr. Benton of ..Kentucky followed and
argued on the indlssolubllity of marriage. '_ He
quoted sections of the Bible to strengthen his
argument. In part he said: â¢ \u25a0 i "\u25a0 â¢ .
"We have been told that this proposed ac
tion sent down from the -House of Bishops is
revolutionary. That it Is contrary to the uni
form practice of 100 years.
"If we take pity" upon the wife who is the
wife of a drunkard who turns his home into
a hell, shall we not have pity upon the wife
whose husband has been unfaithful to his mar
riage vows? If pity Is to rule must we not
marry people who are divorced for any cause?
"I submit, sir, -that the scriptures remain
and they, in their fullness, declare the indtssol
ubillty of marriage and that no one can re
marry. And now we come to our own legis
lation. AVe take up our Book of Common
Prayer, and does it not declare the doctrine
of the church ? Doeg that not declare that after
the marriage vows are taken, that that engage
ment is for life?"
DR. HXTNTINGTON'S ARGUMENT.
Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York, having
"In this discussion there are two great prin
ciples that underlie everything . that has be.en
said or perhaps- can be said on this subject.
There Is underneath everything the paramount
question, "What can we do when we look
abroad and see the dissolution that comes to
our homes â what can we do for our homes?'
"It is not the question or criticism on what
we are to decide this matter. It is the ques
tion â¢ of the great principle that' our Savior,
Christ, put into the world when he . spoke to
the people of Judea. I ask what is the inter
pretation that Christians have placed upon. his
words? They have said in defense of the sanc
tity of the home that no divorce shall be allow
ed the man at his own whim and pleasure,
but should only be allowed by a decree of the
court. - '" ' \u25a0
posed the' proposed canon, directing his bat
teries principally against the fourth section, r
"The question before us,".; he said, "Is not
whether the . laws of the State â¢ are right . or
wrong, but the precise - question , we have to
consider and ' decide is what ; is : the best course
for the' church . to pursue with reference to
persons after they* have been -divorced? Ms :it'
better, for the" church to proscribe and prose
cute and drive away such persons, or lsilt bet
ter for- the church to extend to them- the hand
of friendship, to" treat them with consideration
and kindness and try to make better-men and
women of them? I am aware that there - are
great abuses under the existing divorce laws
of. the country, but those abuses are arguments
to be addressed to . the ' law-making power I of
the country. They, have nothing .-to do with
the question before this convention. !
"I have had considerable to do with the ad
ministration of the law for more than fifty
years as. Judge and practitioner, and the result
of my experience 1b that In a great majority
of cases applications for -divorce are made by
women who seek to be released from worthless,
drunken and criminal husbands, who have been
left abandoned, ' sometimes with children on
their hands, and generally in "poverty. I ask
any man In this convention if he, can give
any good, sound, practical reason- why a
woman . who is divorced under such circum
stances if she finds a man who is willing : to
marry her, who will 'â¢ make her a good husband
and her children a good father and will.pro
vide support and' comfort for her and them,
why she should not have a right to marry that
man and why an Episcopal clergyman should
not have the right to perform the ceremony.'
This legislation \u25a0 on our part will. have no more
effect in deterring people from getting divorce
than the Pope"s bull had against the comet.
When people seek \u25a0 divorce they -do not stop
to consider whether they will be recognized by
the Episcopal church. They know very well
that if the Episcopal church will not recog
nize them all the other churches of the coun
try, will. Therefore it is trying to do some
thing that is , impracticable. It Is 'straining
at a gnat and swallowing a camel.' " - ..-
DISCUSSES PARAMOUNT POINTS.
Rev. Dr. Bassett of Rhode Island followed
and said in part:
Deputy 'George H. Williams of Oregon op-
OPPOSES PROPOSED CANON.
"There is one point involved, and that is
whether the principle of this church shall be
the iodissolubllity of the marriage relation.
"We come here not to legislate; that is for the
State â for the civil government. We come here
to say what shall be the policy of the church.
"We come here to learn whether the policy of
the church Is to preserve the purity of woman.
It is for us to say whether the white banner
of the church shall be unfurled in the cause
of purity or whether it shall be-- denied with
the sophistries of the age."
"For me it . Is sufficient that the unbroken
practice of this church from the commence
ment has permitted remarriage to the innocent
party to a divorce on the ground of adultery,
and that by the common consent of all civ
ilized legislatures and rulers it has been al
lowed. It comes, in my judgment, to the
question of the â¢ expediency of this proposed
legislation. In my judgment the statistics of
divorce -which have been quoted here are not
pertinent to the discussion until it has been
shown that a large number of the divorces
granted in this country have been granted on
the ground of adultery. I believe that nine
tenths of the divorces in the United States pro
ceed upon grounds not scriptural other than
adultery. This is a question of expediency. I
admit that great principle of law which su
bordinates the interests of the few and permits
restraint to some extent upon personal liberty
in the interest of matrimony. This is the first
attempted legislation which I have ever known
which undertakes to subordinate the rights and
interests of the many for the reason that they
may be opposed by the few. Are we to permit
that legislation which denies to the innocent
party entitled to a divorce on the ground of
adultery? Are we to deny to this large class
of people who admit a scriptural right to
remarry simply to prevent abuses which now
and then take place by the perversion of the
judgments of the courts? In my judgment
we are not so justified and no question of
expediency can authorize j an ecclesiastical
council to interpose an obstacle to the ad
ministration of matrimony by the ministers of
our church upon such grounds."
Rev. Dr. Thomas of South Carolina followed
and told the convention that he was the proud
descendant of the first missionary sent out
to 'convert the Indians in his State. In part
he said:
"This is the question of all questions in the
world. I am told that there are numbers of
gentlemen who know all about this question.
This one thing is certain. That of all the mat
ters that can. come up before the convention
this is one that touches the human heart. Here
comes pathos, here comes misery, here comes
pity, here comes compassion."
Deputy Charles Andrews of "Western . New
York next claimed the attention of the house.
He said:
"Now, there are two sorts of conscience in
the world as I understand itâ both very valu
able, both very different. One is the conscience
refined and scrupulous and devout. The con
science that ultimately leavens the world and
sets the standard of morals. Will that con
science agree with you, will it support you. if

know the life of the soul. Knowing this, . as
men and women grow older they grow more
rigorous toward self and more infinitely com
passionate toward others.
"You cannot convince the public of America
that there are not certain people . who should
not marry after divorce. You may yourselves
believe thisâ that is your privilege, but the
great body of America will never believe that
by the law of Christ they cannot remarry
after â¢ divorce. That being the case, is your
legislation expedient? It will be expedient if
you can command the Christian conscience of

little about that, but Christian conscience â and

Rev. Dr. Parks of New York was the first
speaker to be recognized. In part he said:

DEPUTIES TALK. ELOQUENTLY,
1A HE Junior department la eon-

ence yesterday morning at
headquarters, 1G09 Sutter street.
The conference was conduct
ed by Mrs. Burleson of North Dakota,
At noonday special prayers were read

Powers, who spoke interestingly on the
chui^rh and missionary work in Cuba.
The afternoon ceremonies consisted of
conferences and addresses. Bishop Mc-
Xim spoke to the ladies on the missionary
work la Japan. He said in part:
Three years have passed since the last con
vention work and this represents a new era
in Japan. Since then Japan has been admit-
Rev. Dr. Nevln of Rome said he sympathized
with what he . understood to be the object
of the proposed legislation, which was to pro
tect the purity of the family and the sanctity
of marriage. Continuing, he said:
"But I have failed to see from anything
that has been said that- that end will be
reached by this proposed canon. I am very
much afraid that it will work in the opposite
direction. This patchwork has come down
to us, apparently . â¢ the result of a scare
on account of notorious facts in conspicuous
society. This proposed canon seems to be
very bad medicine for the body social.
"I base this conclusion upon the result of
my observations for thirty-five years in Italy.
where divorce is forbidden. The family life
in Italy by this prohibition of divorce has
been nothing bettered;,* but has grown steadily
worse. Adultery is a greater sin than di
vorce; a greater evil in the social body than
divorce, as the hidden cancer is a greater evil
than the open cancer. Adultery is practically
legitimated in Italy. The woman freed from
the fear of divorce -for adultery comes to look
upon it not as a sin \u25a0 to be punished by the
law, but as a venial offense; and it is
looked upon by the ordinary confessor as such
and practically treated as such.
"The frailty of human flesh! Whatever the
evils of divorce may be here, I do not have
the least hesitation in saying that the' family
life In the United States of America is In
finitely higher and infinitely purer than it is
in those countries in Europe where divorce
lor adultery has been forbidden. I deprecate
this proposal, or the proposal of any legisla
tion that can have the effect of lowerimr our
standard on this side, and I ask the members
cf this house to make very sure before vot-,
ing en this canon of shreds and patches that
has corr.e down to us from the other house as
to -whether it will do the least thing in re
straining or In regulating divorce: and second
ly whether it may not be found instead to
work simply as a canon for the promotion of
adultery."

for the church militant; nay, read all the
prayers that bear upon the subject and bear
me witness that it is the testimony of the
Church of England that the stafe is sacred,
even as the church."
WITHDRAWS HIS AMENDMENT.
Delegate Battles of .North Carolina withdrew
his amendment, saying that one objection to
the canon as it existed heretofore was in the
proof that the minister should .require when
he is asked to remarry a person who has been
married before. When it had been put upon
record according to the laws of the United
States, the. record of each State was conclusive
evidence in every other State. The only ques
tion In I such case would be were the parties
before the court by' proper proceeding to get
them in court. Hence he thought that diffi
culty had been done away with by the amend
ment, although perhaps net as clearly as.' it
would have been by the adoption of his sub
stitute. . ; ' -
Rev. Dr. Davenport followed and discussed
the proposed canon under "consideration.

Bishop Potter then addressed. the gath
ering. In part Ijp said:
i When President "Wheeler and Bishop

lustily cheered by the college rooters.
Bishop Potter gave a start and a smile of
amused interest crept over his faes when
the prolonged cry .which ends the Cali

sudden vehemence. President Wheeler
presided at the meeting and, introducing
the speaker, said:

dress was principally confined to an ex
pression of his views' on suffrage as ex
ercised by the various classes of people,
the danger to the republic through a cor
ruptible ballot and California's obliga
tions to the Far East. Every seat in the
gymnasium was occupied and standing
space wascrowded. The students, almost

people from this and other cities.

ted to the comity of nations and administers
its own laws to Europeans and Americans.
Under the new treaties Americans and Eu
ropeans are npw under Japanese jurisdiction.
Before Europeans and Americans would sub
scribe to this treaty new codes of laws had
to be adopted by Japan. It is now in Japan as
difficult to obtain a divorce as in many of
our "Western States. This Is an Important fact
in missionary work.
Social conditions in Japan are such that a
minister does not enjoy that free access to the
people we have at home.
Then the Bishop discussed the self-sac
rificing work of the missionary "women in
Japan. He told how at first their, hard
ships were very severe, but conditions
improved and they are now fairly com
fortable.
Tea was served from 4 o'clock until 6,
at which hour the conference on the work
of colored people adjourned. j
"It seems to me that those who have argued
in favor of this canon has proceeded upon the
assumption that is not quite fair. They have
assumed that they are the only ones who
care for the Integrity of the family, the pur
ity cf the home and social righteousness. There
are those in this house who resent the idea.
There is not a clergyman or layman in the
house who does not agree In these things and
who would not lend his interest and power to
further such ends."
Deputy Lewis made a motion that the com
mittee of the whole rise and ask leave tft sit
again. The reason hs made the motion was
that certain persons desired to speak and as
he was entitled to close the debate it was too
close to adjournment to continue. His motion
was adopted. â¢
President Lindsay called the House of Depu
ties to order and Chairman Packard of the
committee of the whole formally reported
that the committee had : the subject of mar
riage and divorce under consideration and
asked leave to sit again. Permission was
granted.
Upon motion of Deputy Lewis the committee
of the whole will sit again on Monday at
10:30.
An adjournment was then taken.
Rev. Dr. Fulton of Pennsylvania followed
and said:
"I believe the marriage of the innocent party
to a divorce for infidelity is as lawful in the
sight of God and honorable in the sight of
man as any other marriage. Holding that
opinion, and holding it very strongly. I
should prefer myself that the canon had been
in a different form. I should have preferred
that it was a declaratory canon. There Is no
uniform doctrine or discipline la the Catholic
church. I hold that the solemnization of mar
riage is not essential. It is a privilege that
you claim, but it is not a. right. I hold that
the church may withhold it if it thinks there
by it will accomplish a great deal of gd#d
The church is justified in admonishing her
ministers not to celebrate marriages in the
case of divorced persons. One of my own
special desires is to relieve the clergy of being
judges in cases of this kind. How can a
clergyman know It a church in Utah is a
court of competent jurisdiction?"
Rev. Dr. Huntington interrupted at this mo
ment to say that if a clergyman was Incom
petent to answer such a question he was In-,
competent to be ordained.
Dr. Fulton continued and said that when
thl3 burden was laid upon the clergy it was
something that they could not bear. He sin
cerely hoped that the canon under discussion
would not be adopted.
Rev. Dr. Alsop next took the platform and
said in part:
EDUCATE MEN" TO VOTE.
I should like to leave with you to-day one
or two suggestions of a practical character
which I hope will be incorporated In this uni
versity. The foundation of a republic is the
purity and Intelligence of the ballot. The great
danger that threatens our country Is the cor
ruptibility of the ballot and the fact that thÂ«
voter is purchasable. I believe that the first
thing to do to change this state of affairs is
to establish in \u25a0 every center of learning a
course of direct training for the exercise of
the right of suffrage. It should be so that
when a young man has reached the age of 21
he might wear some external badge that should
proclaim to the world that that man had been
tested as to the rights of citizenship and had
proven himself capable of holding such a
trust.
No man will undertake to forecast the futur*
of this great State and this great center of
learning. The people are nocking to your
shores from the Far East, of which the Golden
Gate is the threshold. May God give you wis
dom.- courage and spirit, of brotherhood in which
to deal with them.
"When I was here two years ago my friend
and present host,* Mr. Crocker, said, in an
after dinner speech, that San Francisco was the
front door of the American continent and New
York the back door. Men comfort themselves
with that thought who don't live in the East.
And it is true, it is certaintly true. Students
are knocking at your door from the Philippines,
China, Japan and all the Far East. But from
our Western land is to stream the great civil
ization and commerce which is to join the old
and the new. A university's great calling la

MATJD MILLER ESSAYS
PLAY BY HER FATHER
''Heart of Sierras," Written by Joa
quin Miller, to Have Its First
Presentation.
Maud Miller, daughter of Joaquln Mil
ler, the "Poet of the Sierras," will ap
pear as a star for the first time in San
Francisco at Sherman & Clay's Hall this
evening. Miss Miller will be assisted by
six players, including E. J. Holden in the
character of "49." Bernhard "Walther, the
Belgian violinist, will render a number of
solos between acts. The performance is
under the auspices and for the benefit of
the United Moderns. Miss Miller leaves
on Monday for a long tour through the
south.
The play, "The Heart of the Sierras,"
is a new adaptation of "49." One char
acter has been bodily cut from the manu
script. This character was not originally
created by the poet author, but was in
serted by an actor to whom Mr. Miller
leased the play. The story is told in the
entirety of its poetry and humor and Is
called "The Heart of the Sierras." The
play is the personal property of Maud
Miller, and is a gift to her from her
father.

head had not been relied upon to carry the

; Mr. Raynor questioned the witness at some
length on this point, saying: '\u25a0
"I want to call your' attention to this: Dis
patch No. .8 was received en May 23 by the
Hawk, el Now it is in evidence here that the
Hawk carried No. 8 to Commodore Schley, and
this letter commences 'In reply to your letter
No. 8, I would state," and so on. Then it says:
'Regarding inclosed information from McCalla.'
Now, doesn't that refresh your memory upon
the point that when he received No. 8 from
the Hawk he received with it the inclosed in
formation from Captain McCalla, which is the
memorandum?"
"He probably did. He might have received it
half a dozen times. That was not the first" time
it was sent."
"Does no.t that settle it that he got it from
the Hawk?"
"I do not know that it necessarily, does."
Lieutenant Marsh was then excused.
The last witness of the day . was Captain
French E. Chadwick, at present in command
of the Newport naval station.' . He went on the
stand at 3:30 and had not concluded his tes
timony when the court adjourned. He was.
questioned by Mr. Hanna concerning the code
signals arranged by Captain' McCalla of the
Marblehead with the -insurgent Cubans near
Cienfuegos. He replied: ; \u25a0"'
"Captain McCalla arrived off the reefed
Key West -at noon on the 19th of May. He
came on board- and" was there some time .with
Admiral Sampson and myself. After coming
on deck he spoke. to me and eaid he had made
an arrangement with the ' Cubans oft Cien
fuegos by which they could communicate with
the ships. He said he did not. care to havs
anything said about.lt, as he was going back
the next day and his would probably be the
first ship there. He was accidentally delayed
at Key West by his\ inability to get coal and
water until the next day, so that instead of

Schley on the New York.
"He had been informed that Captain Mc-

all his conduct." f \u25a0

on an earlier date than this letter of May 19,
transmitting the McCalla memorandum?
"I should say not; the McCalla memorandum
being press-copied in the book on a prior page."
\n cross-examining the witness, Mr. Raynor
said that counsel for Admiral Schley would
admit the receipt of one copy of the McCalla
memoranda but that there was dispute as to

ish shore batteries had not given the American
ships much trouble on that occasion:
"None from the Colon came near," he said,
"but two or three shots from the batteries fell
about the Massachusetts at the time, one pass
ing over it." .â¢ \u25a0 .
"What conclusion did you arrive at as to the
caliber of the shore guns?"
"I did not think they were of very large cali
ber, not over six-inch." â¢ - -
Marbleh.ead Officer Testifies.
Lieutenant Francis Boughter, who was a
watch and division officer on board the Mar
blehead during Commodore Schley's blockade
of Santiago, was then called. He said that
during that time the Marblehead and the Vixen
were on picket duty between the snore line and
the line of blockade, the Marblehead being
stationed three miles from the shore and to
the westward, six miles from the Morro. Ho
would not attempt to say how far outside the
squadron was, but he could not see the ships
after nightfall. â¢
The court asked:
"Was the Marblehead in such position at
night while on picket duty off Santiago that
the enemy's vessels would have been seen had
they attempted to leave the harbor?"
The witness replied: "That would depend on
a great many circumstances â the state of the
weather, the course they took and their suc
cess in keeping their ships dark and quiet."
Admiral Deweyâ The Marblehead was on
picket duty. Could she have seen the enemy
coming?"
"If the enemy kept too close to the shore
and we were three miles off during most of the
time we could not have seen them; if the ene
my had stood south from the entrance, which
would have placed them about four miles off,
we could not have seen them, provided they
kept reasonably dark and quiet.".
Mr. Raynorâ What was the purpose of the
picket boats being theresif they could not see
the enemy? . \u25a0 . â¢ \u25a0 '
"They were supposed to be- there, I pre
sume, for that purpose."
"Then, if they were there, for that purpose,
what was it that would have prevented them
from accomplishing this object?"
"The fact that they could not see a vessel
if it ran a distance of from two to three
miles off at night."
At the afternoon session of the court Lieu
tenant Boughter said he had received no gen
eral orders as to the distance out from San
tiago harbor for the Marblehead, the captain
of the vessel fixing the distance from time to
time. \u25a0 ,
Lieutenant Ernest Bennett, ' flag lieutenant
on the New York in 1898, was called. He said
that when the North Atlantic squadron .ar
rived off Santiago they found the flying squad
ron there. Captain Lemly then said that he
had called Lieutenant Bennett . not only for
his direct examination, but for full cross-ex
amination in accordance with the precept. Mr.
Raynor stated, however, that he had no ques
tions to ask, and the witness was excused,
being succeeded by . Lieutenant Charles C
Marsh, who was flag secretary to Admiral'
Sampson during the Spanish war.
Lieutenant Marsh testified concerning the for
warding of dispatches by the Dupont and the
Iowa from Key West on May 20. These mes
sages were from Admiral Sampson to Commo
dore Schley, and one of them was the mem
orandum by . Captain McCalla concerning the
insurgents at Cienfuegos. Questioned as to
the correctness of his memory, the witness
said that his mind was refreshed by the rec
ords of the commander-in-chief as to his cor
respondence. Every letter was, he said, press-
copied as soon as written, and he therefore
considered the order in which the letters were
copied as a certain record of what had tran
spired in the way of letter-writing. Other rec
ords were produced which, he said, were cor
roborative of this. From these records he
found that the "Dear Schley" letter had been
sent on the Dupont May 20. He also found
from the record that a dispatch of May 21
saying the Spanish squadron was "probably
at Santiago" had been forwarded by the Mar
blehead. This is the dispatch dated at Key
West in which Admiral Sampson said to Com
modore Schley: "If you are satisfied that they
<the enemy) are not at Cienfuegos, proceed to
Santiago." etc. He also identified a dispatch
of May 21. dated at Havana, and urging the
commodore to get away from Cienfuegos be
fore daylight of May 23, as the "Spanish would
probably be still at Santiago." The latter-dis
patch, he said, had been written after the dis
patch from Key West of the same date.
WASHINGTON, Oct ll.-Cap
tain F. E. Chadwick. who was
in command of Admiral Samp
son's flagship, the New York,
and who alro was chief of the
admiral's staff during the war with Spain,
testified before the Schley naval court for
a short time this afternoon. He was the
last witness called and when court ad
journed was still under cross-examination
by Mr. Raynor, who stated that he had
only a few more questions to ask him.
There was considerable interest in Cap
tain Chadwicli's appearance because of
his close relationship to the commander
in chief of the North Atlantic squadron.
Captain Chadwick's testimony related
very largely to dispatches sent by Ad
miral Sampson to Commodore Schley
while the latter lay off Cienfuegos, in
May, 189S. and to the code of signals
agreed upon between Captain McCalla of
the Marblehead and the Cuban forces
operating near Cienfuegos.
Chadwick said the code had not been
sent to Commodore Schley by dispatch be
cause Captain McCalla had expected to
join the commodore immediately and
communicate the "code to him. He also
told of being present at an interview be
tween Admiral Sampson and Commodore
Schley, in which the latter had expressed
his intention to be loyal to the command
er in chief. H-3 related in detail the
change of opinion concerning the where
abouts of Cervera'e fleet by Admiral
Sampson on May 21, between the sending
of the two dispatches of that date by
Admiral Sampson to Commodore Schley,
one of which was dated at Key West and
the other at Havana. Captain Chadwick
gaid he had not approved Admiral Samp
son's dispatch of May 28 congratulating
Commodore Schley on his accomplish
ments to that o'ate.
Five other new -witnesses were heard
during the day, two of them being officers
of the New York. One of these was Lieu
tenant C. C. Marsh, the flag secretary of
Admiral Sampson, who testified concern
ing dispatches to Commodore Schley, and
the other was the ship's flag lieutenant.
Lieutenant E. L. Bennett. Lieutenant
Tl^odore G. Dewey, a nephew of Admiral
Dewey, who served on the Massachu
setts;" Lieutenant Althouse. also of the
Massachusetts, and Lieutenant Francis
Bough ter, who served on the Marblenead,
were the other new witnesses of the day.
was Admiral H. C. Taylor. While he was on
the stand he was asked by Captain Lemly
whether he had received information that the
Spaniards were coming out of the harbor at
Santiago before they made their appearance on
the -morning of July 3. His answer was:
"None whatever." \u25a0\u25a0 â¢
Mr. Raynorâ You did not get a message from
the Vixen in reference to smoke coming out of
the harbor?
"None."
Captain Parkerâ Your attention was not
called to smoke? >
"Not at all, sir."
"Do you remember anybody on your vessel
who did observe smoke and report it to you?"
"I dod not remember."
Captain Lemly read a report from Capt. Mer
rill Miller, formerly of the Raleigh, concerning
the accuracy of the stadimeter. This report was
dated in 1895 and stated that the stadimeter
had been found to give accurate results in
measurements of less than 800 yards, but not
so ' when the distance was greater. In one
case -the writer noticed an error of 200 yards
in a 1600 yards measurement.
Movements of Massachusetts.
Lieutenant Adelbert Althouse. formerly watch
and division officer on the battleship Massachu
setts, was then called. He detailed the move
ments of that vessel in connection with the
flying squadron. He said that at Cienfuegos
the vessels lay to ten miles out at night,
going nearer in the daytime. Lieutenant Alt
house said that on the day of the bombardment
of the Cristobal Colon he had been in charge
of the 8-inch turret of the Massachusetts. He
said that the ship had not taken tc exceed
three minutes in passing the entrance to the
harbor on the first passage, and that only two
shots were then fired. The iflBtructions were to
make the range 7000 yards, but the shots fell
short and the range was increased on the re
turn trip to 8500 and then to 10.000 yards.
Asked what was developed as to the strength
of the land batteries by this reconnoissance, he
said that to his mind it was shown they were
very weak. In reply to a question as to whether
he had made any notes concerning the engage
ment he replied: "No, we went in under in
structions to sink the Colon." His orders had
been to direct his fire at that vessel.
When Lieutenant Althouse was excused Cap
tain Lemly introduced as evidence the reports
made by Commodore Schley to the Secretary of
the Navy of the engagement of May 31. In one
of these dated June 3 Commodore Schcley said:
"Reconnoissance was intended principally to
injure and destroy Colon. The fire was returned
without delay, by the heavy batteries to the
east and to -the west of the entrance, large
caliber, long range; reconnoissance developing
satisfactorily \ the presence of the Spanish
equadron lying behind island near inner fort,
as they fired over hill at random. Quite satis
fied Spanish fleet is there."
Lieutenant P. G. Dewey. nephew of Admiral
Dewey, who was a watch officer on the Mas
sachusetts was the next witness. He placed
the distance of the blockading line Under
Commodore Schley from the mouth of the har
bor at from five to eight miles, the distance
being about the same day and night. There
was he said, no particular formation of the
vessels. The examination on this point was
as follows: . â¢ .
Captain Lemly- When you were at the west
ern end of the blockade with the leading ves
sel making the turn, what orders were there
for attacking if you saw the enemy coming
out of the entrance?
"I do not believe we could have seen the
enemy coming out. There were no orders I
havÂ«^ any knowledge of."
"Why do you think you would not have seen
the en'eray coming out if such had been the
case?" -\u25a0 -^
"Owing to darkness* and the distance from
the harbor. For instance, when we were at the
western end of the line<the ships could have
come cut and stood to the eastward without our
being any the wiser unless they showed lights."
"How about the reverse of that proposition?"
"I think it would have been the same in
either case." r ". ' â¢
Captain Lemly then asked: .
"Did you have any conversation with 'the
commanding officer of the flying squadron or
any one in his presence in relation to the fire
on the Colon or otherwise?"
Lieutenant Dewey replied:
"I was told shortly before we started into
the entrance that the commodore wished to st>e
the turret officers in the pilot house. I went
to the pilot house and the commodore said that
he intended to go In a few moments and take
a \u25a0try' at the colon and that he hoped we
would sink her. I asked what speed we would
make, and was told 'about ten knots." I re
marked that I thought that that was giving
us very little chance at the Colon, as she
would be in sight between the head lines only
a couple of minutes and that the smoke from
the guns would probably make our fire very
slow. To the best of my recollection the com
modore stated we would have to do the best
wÂ«i could, that the speed would be ten knots."

Questions About Schley's Operartions
Off Cienfuegos Answered in Court.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 11.â After the witnesses
cf yesterday had been recalled to-day in the
Schley court for the purpose of correcting their
testimony Lieutenant J. H. Kolden was re
introduced to continue his examination. Other
witnesses called for the day were Captain
Chadwick. who was Admiral Sampson's chief
cf staff during the war with Spain; Commander
M. C. Mareh and Lieutenant E. L. Bennett,
both of whom eerved on the flagship New
York; Lieutenant Adelbert Althouse of the
Massachusetts, Lieutenant Francis Boughter of
the Marblehead and Lieutenant W. H. Rey
nolds, who was signal officer on board the
Texas. ....
Captain Lemly had supposed that he would
be able to conclude the presentation of the Gov
ernment'6 side of the case by the close of this
\u25a0n-eek, but he now finds that he will still have
several witnesses on his list when the court ad
journs to-morrow. In all probability he will
consume the greater part of the first half of
rest week. Mr. Raynor estimates that the
court will not be able to conclude its work be
fore the middle of November.
When the court was called to order Captain
Lemly made a brief explanation of one of his
statements of yesterday concerning the state
ment received Jrom Commander Marix. He had
said that the statement was "unsworn."
"I would like it to appear." he said, "that
although these are sworn to they are not, be
ing in the shape of depositions and ex-parte
Etatements, such sworn evidence as is usually
admitted before the court, but came in with
their full value merely because there was ' no
objection on either side."
Among the witnesses called early in the day
for the purpose of correcting early testimony
. "Yes."
"You have stated that he became certain
on this subject?"
"He became assured, or at least my Im
pression is that he felt assured after the re
ceipt of the second word- from Captain Allen
in regard to the matter; that was on the even
ing of the 20th." .
"Was that- an assurance, may I ask you. of
whether the 1 Spanish fleet was at Santiago
or whether it had gone into Santiago?"
"At 'Santiago." '" 'â¢ â¢â¢' *" T
\u25a0 T - "Does it sta'te anything about 'having gone
in and come out?"
"No, that they were there."
At this â¢ point in Captain Chadwick's testi
mony the court adjourned for the day.
"This dispatch and the telegram to the de
partment paraphrasing it were prepared on
the night of the 19th and were sent .that night,
I think. 1 - At noon of the 20th Lieutenant Staun
ton saw Capain Allen in Key West and Staun
ton was again sent to Key West and came
back with the assurance . from "Captain â¢Allen
that the Spanish fleet was there. Then the
doubt in Admiral Sampson's mind was re
moved, and he then wrote a dispatch to be sent
by the Marblehead, which we were expecting
to get off hourly. She. however, was delayed
and the flagship got under way at 4 o'clock in
the morning of the 21st and went over to Ha
vana. . From there, as there was more possi
bility of delay in the Marblehead's departure
than was expected, he sent the Eagle and the
Hawk with a copy, of this dispatch and a sup
plementary dispatch to Commodore ! Schley,
also with verbal instructions to the command
ing officer of the Hawk to move at once to
ward Santiago."
"Is this the dispatch you refer to. No. 8?
On the 21st the \u25a0 following Instructions were
written at Key West for Commodore Schley
and sent at 3 a. m. to the Marblehead to be
delivered with all dispatch: 'Spanish squad
ron probably. at Santiago, four ships and three
torpedo-boat destroyers. If you are satisfied
they are not at Cienfuegos proceed with al!
dispatch, but cautiously, to Santiago de
Cuba, etc.' Is that the dispatch that was sent
to Commodore Schley after the doubt was re
moved in the mind of Admiral Sampson of
where the Spanish fleet was?"
"No, sir. 'What caused the belief was thÂ«
information received from Captain Allen of
the signal corps, who was in . charge of the
telegraph office' in Key West. He informed
Lieutenant Staunton, who was in Key West,
at noon on the 20th that this information, had
come overnight from Havana-"
"Could I interrupt you just a minute? "Waa
number 7. the dispatch referred to (the 'Dear
Schley' dispatch), being 'sent in answer to this
inclosure?" \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ - - .

Questions Over Telegrams.
rival of the Spanish squadron at Santiago. Will
you kindly give t U8 the information and from
W "The first intimation we had was by a tele
gram from the Navy Department mentioning
that "The information may well be correct-
Next day Lieutenant Commander Staunton waa
in Key West and saw Captain Allen, who saui
that the evening before he had received com
munication from Havana that the Spanish
squadron had' gone into Santiago, and he was
only waiting until the evening of the 20th to
have it corroborated, as the operator who sent
the information put himself in communication
with our office in Key West only once a day,
about 6 o'clock in the evening. Staunton came
with that information and then went up in the
evening to wait a second telegram, which cor
roborated the first, and which .caused Admiral
Sampson to believe "that the Spanish fleet was
in Santiago and also caused, him to write the
second dispatch directing the movement toward
Santiago." '
Mr. Raynorâ Is this the telegram you refer
to: "The report .of the Spanish fleet being at
Santiago de.Cuba might very well be correct.
So that the department strongly advised that
you send word . immediately by the Iowa to
Schley to proceed off Santiago de Cuba with
his whole command, etc?"
"That is the telegram I refer to."
"Did I understand you to â¢ say that that
caused : the belief that the Spanish fleet was
in' Santiago?" . , .
"You say that after the arrival of Captain
McCalla information was received of the ar-
A. â I don't remember speaking of if to Cap
tain Evans, nor that I told him to communi
cate it to Schley., When McCalla came in it
was expected that his ship would reach Cien
fuegos about the same time as the Iowa and
the Dupont, and McCalla said he would carry
the signal agreement back with him". ! That,
signal was really for the benefit of the Cubans
and the McCalla memorandum was for Com
modore Schley. The memorandum was full and
explicit in that regard. If I may explain it a
little farther, by the afternoon of the next or
the afternoon of the day after McCalla came
in. Information was received of the arrival of
the Spanish squadron in Santiago. So that any
question of the insurgent Cubans about Cien
fuegos dropped out of sight.
Q.â Captain Evans has testified here that he
knew it. Could you give me the source from
which he derived his information?
The witness admitted that this was so;
. Mr. . Hanna â We have not asked oninions of
officers commanding ships regarding that. We
have carefully abstained from so doing.
Mr. Raynorâ Then 1'will ask you in reference
to the leaving of these vessels. You have
stated, and it has been in testimony here, that
this signal code with the Cuban insurgents was
not made known to Commodore Schley. Have
you not fallen into a slight error in point of
time? Did not the flying squadron leave Key
West before McCalla got to. Key West, and have
you not inadvertently fallen into error in point
of time? You could not have given Commo
dore Schley the information because you did
rot have it until Captain McCalla got there. Is
that not the reason? â¢.
. Mr. Raynor â Did you at any< time approve of
the blockade which Commodore Schley main
tained before June 1? What was your opinion?
Judge advocateâ I object.
Admiral Deweyâ The court does not want that
opinion.
, Judge advocateâ No > objection was made to
conversations after June 1 relating to the block
ade as maintained prior thereto.
Admiral Deweyâ Of course it ought not. You
ought to have been watching.
"I. aid ob'ject to it twice, and then when- it
was stated that it was. something in reference
to - something that occurred before I did not
want to disagree with the court."
H"o Opinions "Wanted.
"Did Commodore Schley . go on ' board the
flagship?"
. "He came on board."
"Were you present at an interview?"
"I was present there the whole time he waÂ£
there.; In the 'cabin the only persons, who
were present permanently, so to speak, were
Admiral Sampson, Commodore Schley and my
self.' \u25a0 There were several different persons
coming" and going." *
: "Did Commodore Schley come aboard Admi
ral Sampson's flagship on June 1 oft Santiago
when the latter reached there?" \u25a0 V
"Yes, sir; he came aboard in the Vixen."
. "Will 'you please tell the court what occur
red during that interview. Was there anything
said with regard to the feasibility of conduct
ing a blockade oft Santiago?"
"Yes. I remember Commodore Schley spoke
in ;my .presence, and I think to myself, as he
was leaving the ship, saying, 'You cannot
blockade those ships in there if they want to
come out.' I remember that."
The Judge Advocate â Did you have any in
formation whatever from any source that Cer
vera's fleet was going to make a sortie from
the harbor of Santiago on July 3?" . .
"None whatever, within my recollection."
. Taking the witness for cross-examination,
Mr. Raynor asked:
"Do you recollect the dispatch which will be
found in the official report of Admiral Samp
son, dated May. 29, which congratulates Com
modore Schley upon his success? I will read
the dispatch. Following telegram was sent
te/ Commodore Schley -*Â» boCh Port Antonio,
Jamaica, and Mole St., Nicholas:
" 'I congratulate you on success. Maintain
close blockade at all hazards, especially at
night. Very little fear from torpedo boat
destroyers. Coal in open sea whenever condi
tions permit. Send a ship to examine Guanta
namo with a view to occupying it as a base,
coaling heavy ships one at a time. Appraise
captured coal, use it if desired, and after
ward send ship in as prize." "
"I remember that very well, because I pro
tested against his congratulations. I asked
him why he persisted and he said: 'I want
to encourage him.' "
. "You recollect that because you protested
against putting that in the dispatch?"
"I said that under the circumstances I
thought it was improper." ,
"Did you meet Admiral Watson at any time
and have a conversation with him?"
Admiral Deweyâ I don't think that has any
thing to do with it. You know what .we want.
We want all the facts relating to these speci
fications and -we don't want anything about
conversations with Admiral Watson, commo
dores or anybody else on other subjects.
Mr. Raynorâ This testimony has all gone in.
It ought not to have gone in.

I WAS told ' shortly before we started into the entrance that the commodore wished to see the \u25a0 .turret officers in the pilot

New Strength and Life in One
. Real Remedy.
Ablest of All Physicians Freely
Gives Advice.
. . : â .;
It is truer to-day than ever before that
one man Is no better than another unless
he does more than another.
When, recently, in the most learned
medical review in London, the orgah of
the great English college of physicians "
and surgeons, it was proved by exhaus-
tive statistics that, despite the drain upon
nerves and blood incident to the modern,
strenuous lifeâ despite the fact that dig-
eases of the nervous system appear earl-
ier and oftener among working people
than formerly, nevertheless within tha
past five or six years the average life of
Americans was materially longer than it ' $
was a decade agroâ the editors of the't^ *!
view pronounced it as their firm oplnloj^M||kj
that this undoubtedly resulted in no small \u25a0*?
degree from the discovery a few years I
ago by an eminent American physician
of a positive cure for diseases of the nerv-
ous system, which had promptly been put J
within the reach of the . public in that
MR. F. G. CROWELJ* S
country, and was beinff used more and |
more generany as a family remedy.
One of the physicians, a member th^ y
and now of the royal staff, in forward^; >
a copy of the article to the proprietors of
Paine's celery compound, inclosed a long
and somewhat technical letter, in which f
he said: '
"We are thoroughly convinced that no
remedy yet known affords so certain re-'
lief from that class of disorders which %
modern conditions of working and living
now breed as your Paine's celery com-
pound."
k. Certainly one remedy is no better Â£han j^'.
another unless it accomplishes more tliar*: J
another.
And Paine's celery compound is pre-em-
inently the best remedy known to medi-
cine for the cure of ailments that result
from Impaired nerves and consequent im-
pure blood. The rheumatism, neuralgia. j
sleeplessness, indigestion, lack of strength
that a bottle of Paine's celery compound
so rapidly dispels are but temporary con-
ditions if the relief that this remedy af-
fords is properly given.
Mr. F. G. Crowell, a regent of the State
University of Kansas, a typical exampla \u25a0,
of the strenuous life of to-day, a college
graduate with a later master's degree
from Columbia, who resigned from the
Prosecuting Attorneyship of Atchison
County after four years to engage in the.
grain business with the famous Green- '
leaf-Baker Grain Company, is one of tha [
thousands of such young men who oÂ»*a (

was station agent for tlie Colorado and
Southern Railway at Jefferson. His head
had been beaten to a pulp with a club.
The Coroner's verdict charged the crime
to Charles Bauer, a man formerly em
ployed by Vallle on a ranch. Charges
were made that Baker's motive for the
crime was love for Mrs. Vallie. who \ras
much younger than her husband. Mrs.

flames were soon getting beyond control.
Nearly 300 acres of timber have been de
stroyed and the fire is unchecked.
The Santa Lucia range fire started
near the old reservoir of the Pacific Im
provement Company, back of Monterey
and Pacific Grove. Several hundred acres
of pines, cypress, scrub oak, ' manzanita
and other timber have been consumed and
the flames are spreading. The fire can
be seen from Salinas. Unless rain falls

During the day the heat here has been

RICH PAY DIRT
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 11.â In com
pliance with a request from Washington
the search by Ottoman troops for the ab
ductors of Miss Stone, the American mis
sionary, has been abandoned, it being
feared that the brigands would kill her
should they be closely pursued. Arrange-
The United States is not willing, how
ever, to authorize any preparations at this
time on the part of the Bulgarian or the
Turkish Government to attack the brig
ands immediately after Miss Stone's re
lease. Such preparations were made by
the Greek Government In 1870, in the case
of the party of English and Italian visit
ors held captive by brigands, and the lat
ter, in order to facilitate their escape,
killed their prisoners. It is surprising to
the United States that the abductors of
Miss Stone have not coupled with the de
mand for ransom a demand for amnesty,
as was done in 1870 by the Greek brigands.
Great Britain urged upon Greece to
grant the amnesty desired, but the Athens
Government was unable to comply on ac
count of constitutional limitations, though
It agreed to permit an English warship to
convey the men safely to Malta after they
had released their prisoners. The United
States would undoubtedly go as far as
Great Britain did, and if necessary will
urge Bulgaria and Turkey to grant am
nesty to Miss Stone's captors.
May Grant Amnesty.
The State Department understood that
the Turkish Government had so disposed
its troops along the frontier that the
brigands would be unable to enter into the
interior of the country. It is believed
here that the brigands are moving from
place to place along the boundary line,
seeking refuge first in Bulgarian and then
in Turkish territory. To both govern
ments the United States is making most
urgent representations not to authorize
an attack. Only by fair dealing, in the
opinion of this Government, can Miss
Stone be rescued. After careful considera
tion of the matter the authorities have
decided that the wisest course is to ran
som Miss Stone, and once she is released
and actually in safety, then the Bulgarian
or Turkish Government will be urged to

(i . Fears even deeper than those
hitherto entertained are felt to
night for Miss Stone, the Ameri
can missionary, held captive by Bulgarian
brigands. Her situation is most desper
ate. She is in the hands of men who will
not hesitate to commit murder if they
themselves believe that the crime will
facilitate their escape. Aware that the
military forces of Bulgaria and the Turk
ish Government are prepared to attack
them at a favorable opportunity, Miss
Stone's abductors must receive the ran
som without delay or else they will kill
their captive. The time limit fixed for the
payment of the ramsom expired on Tues
day. It is thus three days overdue, and
the sum demanded has not yet been
raised. That the brigands appreciate the
dangerous situation in which they have
tound themselves is shown by the fact of
their return into Turkish territory.
Watkins testified that the train arrived
st Wenatchee at S:10 o'clock. It is yet to
be decided who was at the key in Spokane
â¢when the train was cleared at Wenatchee,
as evidence concerning the man on duty
in Spokane is conflicting.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11.â In a head-end
collision between ' a lemon train and a
work; train oh the Colegrove branch of

The injured: : S. "Wartner, J. Nelson,
George Noonan, "William Cameron, E. W.
Flannagan and H. L. Prltchard.
The Colesrove.: branch of>the Los An
geles and Pacific Electric Company, on
which the accident occurred, la a single
track line, and from the stories told by
those concerned the wreck was unavoida
ble. A dense fog and slippery rails are,
In a great measure, responsible for tho
disaster. The work train, consisting of
two flat cars and a light motor car, start
ed out 'of Sherman for Laurel Canyon,
two miles east. Eleven or twelve laborers
were riding: on' the flat cars In charge of
Foreman. Reuter. A dense fog: made it
impossible-, to see beyond the train's
length.
About the same time a lemon train, con
sisting of two heavily loaded freight cars
and a heavy motor car, left the packing
house at Colegrove, west bound. The
grade west to Sherman is down hill,
which fact, coupled with slippery rails
from the fog, caused the train to shoot
down hill at a high speed. Just east of
the scene of the I accident there ia a sharp
curve. On rounding this Motorman
Prltchard of the lemon train saw the
work train and called to the conductor
and another man to jump, at the same
time leaping: from the -flying car. The
trains came together with a crash, the
heavier motor climbing over the work
train arid crushing the laborers on tho
flat cars. Motorman Vinson of the work
train stuck to his post and was killed.
Some of the injured men in the hospital
in this city are not expected to recover.

â¢ A dispatch from Brussels to the New York Herald
says the plan is to be seriously made a part-of-diplo
matic discussion during the coming winter. There is
something of radical common sense in the plan that
renders its adoption very improbable. In fact, most
diplomatists would ' probably laugh! at it if it were
permissible for a diplomatist to laugh at ' anything.
At present Austria, Germany, France, Italy and Spain
have to keep a considerable police force watching ah
srehists all the time, and evenjin Great-Britain arid
the United States there is much police supervision'
necessary. Each Government feels relieved when
some particularly dangerous anarchist removes Vhis
residence to some other country. In , fact;.' nations
have repeatedly warned such anarchists to leave their
boundaries, thus forcing an evil upon a 'neighbor na
tion instead of crushing it. . â¢ v
\u25a0It would be rnorereighborly as well as cheaper in
the long run to accept the Belgian idea and establish;
the international colony.. It .ought not to be dis
agreeable to anarchists, for it would give -them an
island in which they could live in lawless freedom.
It would'save them from. the trouble of conspiringto
kill anybody, while .permitting, them the amplest lib
erty of speech. Altogether the subject is well worth
the attention .of^diplomatists, and it js : to be hoped
the Belgians will really press it upon their considera
tion.'.. ; ' . ' : ;V',"'C'
OF all the plans which have been suggested for
.dealing with anarchists who are too good to
hang but too bad to be tolerated in civilized
society perhaps the best is one which has been pro
posed in Belgium, and which it is said the Belgian
Government will endeavor to have adopted by inter
national agreement. The plan is nothing more nor
less than the establishment of an international penal
colony on some uninhabited group of islands in the
Pacific, to which the nations shall be bound to de
port all anarchists now living within their borders.'
\rThe : man who devised the scheme seems to have
worked it out in every detail except the selection of
the islands. That he left to international diplomacy.
For the rest he proposes that one island or group of
islands shall be seit apart for male anarchists and an
other, for females, and that the separation between the
two shall be kept strictly enforced, so that there will
be no breeding of anarchists. He figures out that pro
vision will have to be made for not more than . 10,000
persons, as' that is about the number of "reds" now
wandering about the world outside of Russia. -. For
some reason not set forth in the report-that comes to
us Russia is not to be asked to join in the plan. Her
Government is' to be left to deal with her anarchists
in its own way.
AN ANARCHIST COLONY.
H." R., San Rafael, Cal.
Tne steamers of the Japanese line stop
at Honolulu on the return trip, but can
not carry any passengers from that point
\o San Francisco. . .,-
Mr. Asquith, one of the foremost of the Liberal
leaders, recently said: "It is a total mistake to sup
pose that the proclamation his the force of law; no
Minister in this country has- the power by putting
on a piece of paper, the sentenccof banishment- to
make that sentence effective against any part of his
Majesty's subjects. What the proclamation really
amounts to is this, and in this respect it corresponds,
I think,- to a large extent with what was done at the
tnd'of the Franco-German war with regard to the in
habitants of Alsace. The proclamation says to these
people: You must make your choice. If by the date
fixed you surrender, well and good; if you do not,
we warn you that local legislation will be initiated for
the" purpose of doing what was done to the inhabi
tants of Alsace who did not choose to come in under
the proclamation on terms, banishing you from the
territory." ' \u25a0 - . '\u25a0..'.'
Mr. Asquith went on to say that he did not believe
the Commons of Great Britain would ever consent
to an" assumption on the part of the Government that
it had a; right by paper proclamation to banish from
any part of the empire any British subject, and that
before the warning given by the proclamation can be
put into. effect there; will have to be local-legislation,
which at every stage can be'discussed, and -which even
when e r nacted- will be at afl times subject to amend
ment, revision and repeal. ; ' . . .
.The statement of Mr.. Asquith has been regarded as
such a clear presentation of the law of the empire
that even some members of the Ministry have ad
mitted its truth. The Westminster Gazette says that
the question of the legality of the proclamation is
even more important than the question of its, ex-'
pediency, andadds: "If we accept this gazetted no
tice as good law;; the Russian method of banishment
by administrative order will henceforth be a weapon
of the British executive, and thus under the supposed
stress of military necessity: we shall part one by'v one - ;
with the most ; cherished- safeguards .of our ' \u25a0 liberal' ;
tolerant and unaggressive empire..":;.-. -' . 'Â«'
While the British. lawyers and Liberals are thus
discussing the proclamation from' a legal standpoint,
all questions as to its 'expediency seem to have been
answered by, the event. t The proclamation has not
brought a single Boer leader to surrender. It fias
served only to deepen": {heir hostility to the British
KITCHENER'S proclamation warning the Boer
leaders that if they did not surrender before
September 15 jthey would when captured be
sent into permanent exile appears to have had m'Ore
effect in Great "Britain thanin the Transvaal. - The
Boers have paid little attention'toit, but the British
themselves have been warmly idiscussing it .and con
demning it. It is claimed that the threat of exile is
on the part of Kitchener an assumption of power
which he does not possess, and that neither he nor the
B~ritish Ministry can legally enforce such a-punish
ment unless given authority by the Legislature;

. It is sa^d that Rudyard Kipling's "Kim,"
published this week in book form after
having run serially In Cassell's Magazine,
cost him more work than any of his pre
vious books, (some sections were rewrit
ten a dozen times, and j when changed
were perhaps cut out altogether. The
book was begun more than eight years
ago. The journeys of Kim and his lama
reproduce many of the same travels of
the author, especially the description of
the journey toward the land of Thibet.
The end of the book also, it Is under
stood, is taken from actual experience.
"The Benefactress," by the author of
"Elizabeth and Her German Garden,"
which Messrs. Macmlllan will pufait3h be
fore very long, is I believe a novel of
German village life. It is, said by those
who have read the manuscript to be full
of the charm of the anonymous author's
previous works. The benefactress Is a
young English woman who has a fortune
left her by a German relative. She takes
up her property in Germany, and the
story tells her experiences in that coun
try. I belleve.it Is. also safe to say that
tho book will contain more than a few
biographical touches.
I hear that Mr. Barrett has just de
signed a bookplate for the Queen, but it

Talking of books, nobody is so fond of
them or takes greater care of them than
Lady Feo Stuart, who is ju3t now in Rus
sia. She perfectly revels in books and
pays very large sums for them and then
has them exquisitely bound. I have just
seen Goupll's edition of the Louvre In six
volumes, which she has had bound in a
lovely shade of old French red leather,
most beautifully tooled. Every volume is
lined with white watered silk.
Sir David Salomons Is also very fond of
books and pay3 large sums for their bind

Half a century ago Lord Grimthorpe's Interest In horology
took the form of something more than a 'hobby. Though a
Parliamentary lawyer by profession he designed and superin
tended the construction of the "Westminster clock, the largest
In the world and one of the finest public timekeepers. Ho has
written a book, "Clocks and Watches and Bells," which la re
garded as a classic in it3 war.
Lord Grimthorpe Is now a rugged-looking old gentleman,
who wears a broadcloth frocJc coat of distinctly clerical cut.
He Is somewhat militant in manner . He made a large fortuna
at the bar and inherited great wealth. His annual income i3
said to exceed $500,000.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Lord Grlmthorpe has during nearly -the whole of -his
life pursued what Is probably the most curious hobby
affected by any member of the Peerage. He designs and oc
casionally makes and repairs clocks. At Batch Wood, his St.
Albans residence, he has a workshop replete with all the ap
pliances of the clockmaking trade, and In his younger days, It
is said, he took a pleasure v in "doctoring" the out-of-sorts
watches of his fellow-Parliamentarians.
AN Interesting figure In England Is Lord Grlmthorpe,
clockmaker, author and King's Counsel. He Is now In
his eighty-flfth year, and Is the oldest King's Counsel,"
having been appointed in 1854.
THE address of Bishop Potter before the Church
Association for Advancement of the Interests of
Labor was a notable effort and should be circu
lated for the 'study of all who are interested in the
labor problem. He keenly analyzed the many changes
that have come over the modern world, and espe
cially over American life. Bellamy, Gronlund and
other reformers of that school have greatly succeeded
in creating a distaste for work. They have especially
held up the home and housekeeping arts as degrading
drudgery, and have imagined all sorts of schemes of
a communistic nature to take the place of that charm
ing and hospitable housewifery which the Bishop re
called with so much pleasure. * -
As this distaste for housekeeping has not yet or
ganized any of the lazy plans framed by the reform
ers, people live on canned goods and food prepared
outside their houses. Public opinion has much to do r
with it. Formerly when a young couple married if
they did not begin at once to build a home and to
keep house within it as their castle public opinion
regarded them with surprise' and " assumed toward
them an attitude of criticism. Now it is quite differ
ent, especially in our cities. People marry at the
parsonage or rectory, live at a boarding-house, die in
the hospital and are buried from the undertaking par
lors. They plant and tend no flower or vine, and hal
low no home to their children. â¢
All this is done to avoid, those domestic cares and
duties which, assumed with zeal and discharged with
patience, go into the warp and woof of manly and
womanly character to be its strength and beauty.
Children reared in this avoidance of home-making
and housekeeping, who play in the halls of a hotel
or boarding-house, and have no home shrine nor
hiding-place for their childish treasures, are them
selves totally unfitted to make a home, and, worse yet,
are materially unfitted for the most important and
necessary duties of life. The effect threatens the
state itself, inasmuch as the state is founded upon the
homes of the people. If the people keep no homes,
the state comes to be founded on a boarding-house,
and on dyspepsia and the diseases of idleness.
Bishop Potter put forward very powerfully the
necessity for right understanding and sympathy be
tween employer and. employe.'. These once existed in
this country, and began to disappear when the class
idea was imported from other countries. The great
manufacturing business of New England was founded
and flourished by the employment of native labor.
The New England mill girl was the queen of her
time. She went out from a New England home, was
known to and respected by her employer, and earned
her share of what was needed to found another home
like that of her parents. The change came when she
was displaced by immigrant labor. The tie of a com
mon nativity was sundered and friendly sympathy
went with it The industrial demands of the country
outran our power of assimilation, and instead of the
class distinctions and exclusive ideas disappearing in
the contact, they subordinated to them the relations,
the ideas and the ideals that they found here, and
for a quarter of a century or more labor has been
taught an antagonism to its employer which the em
ployer has been compelled to accept as a fact at first,
and finally to act upon to an extent that would have
appalled our grandfathers.
After all, is it not true that part of this offensive
feature is derived from the homeless lives of the peo
ple? When employer and employe both live in fixed
homes their life experiences have sympathetic*, con
tact in that relation. It was a profound economic
saying that put forward the little child as the leader,
like whom all should be. Fatherhood and mother
hood know no condition of life. They are the com
mon experience and the teacher of all in wisdom.
Taken on in a home, fixed, permanent and definite
they are the common tie between all kinds and con
ditions of men, and when that tie is felt the thrill of
human sympathy passes through it, like the .power
giving current through the electric wire. */ '
We believe that the Church Association for Ad
vancement of the Interests of Labor has in mind this
cne, great, common and persistent tie between men
and following put that philosophy it may hope to
reform conditions and to regenerate individuals,' mak
ing the whole social slate to change to the older and
better model without socialism, and to bring men to
a sense of their common interests without com
munism.
BISHOP POTTER ON LABOR.
It will be seen, therefore, that those who best un
derstand the subject do not regard polar exploration
as a mere adventure carried out in the name of
science, but as a genuine working for a definite and
usefuTend. It is safe to say" that whatever view, the
public may take, of the matter the explorations will
be carried on until men have reached both the poles
and have accurately mapped their lands and deter
mined the nature of their atmospheric phenomena.
Mr. Smith agrees that the commercial benefits to
be derived from a complete exploration of the poles
are not slight, and that they will go far to repay all the
outlay that such explorations cost, but he also holds
that the advancement of science must be the chief re
ward. He recalls the fact that the-earlier voyages to
the frozen seas were designed solely, for material
profit, and' quotes the saying of Milton: "They might
have seemed almost heroic if any liigher end than
excessive love for gain and traffic had animated the
design."
Mr. Clayton says: "The observations. in- the polar
regions in the past have borne fruit in many ways.
The observations on terrestrial magnetism ;:have' f en
abled scientific men to make progress in working out
the laws which govern the movements "of 'the'' mag.-*
netic pole and the changes in magnetism which affect,
the compass of every ship that plows the. deep.- Poiar
observations are enabling men to compare- and test
the theories about the origin of weather changes. and
are thus aiding toward the determination of ; the true
laws of stcrm and cold waves, which knowledge may
in time be worth millions- of. dollars, to the. world."
He concludes by the declaration that in his opinion'
the United States will gain more by polar exploration
than by annexing the Philippines, and Great 'Britain
more than by conquering the. Transvaal. v.^ ; f ;./.-/
Professor Ward goes over. . virtually -the;' ; same:
ground as that traversed by Mr. Clayton and says:
"The more we can learn of Arctic .and -Antarctic.
meteorology the better will be our understanding of
the great laws that control atmospheric movements,
thus influencing weather and climate and affecting
man's activities and mode of life. Many .problems
await for their complete solution the data which pres- 1
ent and future polar explorations will supply. * * *
To the question," 'Will polar exploration give meteor
ology any facts which will be of immediate practical
value to man?' the answer must be no. But that all of
the data thus gained will help the advancement of
science and will thus in the end be of practical bene
fit to mankind there can be no question."
Professor Tod says that in addition to the benefits
to be expected in the way of geographical exploration
and scientific research there will be commercial profit
from the polar voyages. He says: "I have never met
any one not ignorant of the facts of polar exploration
who could argue against it. Consider the standpoint
of commerce alone â for the past two centuries the
yield of Arctic products has exceeded an average of
$5,000,000 annually, and the available wealth of these
superficially known lands is by no means exhausted."
FOR the purpose of explaining to the public what
. gains are to be expected from further explora
tions of the polar regions four scientists of Bos
ton have contributed articles to a recent number of
the Boston Globe. , The writers are: H. Helm Clay
ton, president of the Boston Scientific Society; Rob
ert D. Ward, assistant professor of "climatology at
Harvard; David P. Tod, professor of astronomy at
Amherst, and J. W. Smith of the Weather Bureau.
These men are certainly competent to \u25a0 pronounce
upon the profitableness of such explorations; and
each and all of them maintain that mankind will be
well repaid for whatever energy is expended in reach
ing not only the north pole but the south pole as well.

POLAR EXPLORATIONS.
What nefarious scheme of plunder had they on hand,
and how was it thwarted by the Examiner? Cham
bers of Commerce, . commercial bodies, social clubs
and secret and beneficial societies, all over the coun
try, have attacked and condemned the. Hearst papers.
In What plundering scheme were they thwarted by
those, newspapers? "Let us have the particulars. If
college presidents and Cardinals, and a majority of
the social and commercial organizations of this coun
try, are contemplating plunder and crime and bite
their thumbs at the Hearst papers because they alone
prevent the success of these' distinguished criminals',
it is surely an alarming state of affairs, and the anarch
of the dailies should let us know all about it.
a Bishop Potter and Father Doyle the Paulist, Dr.
Hillis of BeeclierV church, Dr. Savage of the Uni
"tarian Church of the Messiah, 'Archbishop Riordan
and President Jordan, Rev? Robert Mackenzie and
Gavin McNab, President -Wheeler, Rev. William
Rader and Mr. Lindsay, grand chancellor of the
of Pythias, are among those who attack and
condemn the. Hearst papers, and the Examiner says
they do it those newspapers prevent them
"from carrying out plans as criminal as any that
have sent men to jail."
I This is alarming, if true. The Examiner boasts that
it is the defender of the people, and has the courage
of its convictions. Why not draw on its stock of
courage and its knowledge of the criminal schemes of
these gentlemen and let the public know the extent
of their criminal plans/ which .. it stays awake to
thwart, overthrow and defeat? â¢
Among the newspapers which have attacked and
condemned Hearst's yellow papers are those leading
Democratic papers, the Brooklyn Eagle, Detroit
Free Press, Philadelphia Times, Washington
Times, New Orleans Times-Democrat, Chicago
Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Sacramento
Bee and Coliisa Sun. In what scheme of
crime have they been thwarted by this champion
thwarter? 'It will be very interesting to know what
crime Colonel Henry Watterson intended to com
mit when Hearst caught him at it and promptly threw
out his thwarter and thwarted him. Colonel Watter
son travels a good deal and may try to work his
scheme of plunder and criminal plan when Hearst is
not looking, so it is quite necessary that the Ameri
can people shall be put on to Colonel Watterson's
criminal combination in order that they may turn in
the fire alarm and thwart him before he can work
it. Mr. Hearst should abandon his attitude of gen
eralities and inform the public fully about these
things. - . ...
The American people, of whom the Examiner
kindly, but firmly takes charge, are sending their chil
dren to Yale and Harvard, . and Stanford and
Berkeley, and to Rutgers and the Cooper Union, and
the other hundred institutions of learning -which have
condemned Hearst and* thrown his papers into the
ditch, If the children, of the people are being, sent
to institutions which wpuld commit such crimes as
sendmen to jail if Hearst should turn his back," it
should be known at once, and Hearst should publish
a ground plan and front elevation of the crimes these
colleges and universities would commit if he gave
them the chance. . ,
In a play that is popular are three characters called
Colonels Yell, Brag and Blow. : The names are very
applicable to Hearst's three newspapers, for by yell,
brag and blow they hdpe to weather jthe storm of
popular indignation which has swept them out of all
respectable places in the United States.
This makes; necessary a bill of particulars. The
Hearst papers have been attacked and condemned by
President Eliot of Harvard and by Cardinal Gibbon.
IN the Examiner's last Jack Cade manifesto, "in
which everybody is warned not 'to touch it, for
it is the American people, those who oppose it
are 'specifically described as criminals whose schemes
of plunder it Jias thwarted, and who have in.contem
plation crimes like "those for which men have been
sent to Jail. \u25a0 â¢> , -
and to strengthen their resolve to 'fight to. the last. It
is to be borne in mind always that even after the con
quest of the Transvaal the. British will- not own all
of South Africa, and accordingly, when resistance in
the field is no longer possible the valiant Boers will
have only to cross over the border into German or
Portuguese territory to find safety and 1 repose." Evi
dently, therefore, the British- are to gain nothing by
the proclamation, and its publication seems. to have
been one of the worst blunders they have made dur
ing the war.

Four coal-laden vessels bound for this
port were yesterday added to the over

four-maeted baxk Afon Alaw.- She is now
332 days out from Swansea and the under
writers are payins 8 per cent to reinsure
their risks. Captain Thomas has been com
ing to this port for years and never met
with a mishap, so his friends are not wor
rying. He was master of the bark Meri
onette when she made the record run of
ninety-seven days from Swansea, but he
has never been able to make a quick pas
cage in the Afon Alaw.
The French barks La Tour d'Auvergne,'
149 days out from Swansea; Edward De

are also entertained for the Chilean bark
Antoinette, row out 142 days from Che

little schooner Helen, now out eightv-five
days from San Diego, for Alaska, and the
Fhip Indiana, now out forty-three days
from Bristol Bay. for San Francisco.
What makes it look bad for the Antoi
nette is the fact that the schooner Fred J.
Wood, which left Chemalnus over two
months after her, arrived at Antofogasta

The Helen was built at Sausallto to take
a party of gold hunters to Nome. As
soon as the boat g-ot outside a storm came

She made San Diego leaking a.nd after be

transfer his flag to the Philadelphia and
will start for Panama. At the isthmus
he will again transfer his flag to the
Iowa and will go to Pago Pago in that
vessel. Admiral Casey will be head of
the court appointed to try (Sommander
Benjamin F. Tilley of the Abarenda,
naval governor of Tutuila, for "conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman."
The Philadelphia will remain at Panama
and the Wisconsin at San Francisco until
Admiral Casey's' return.
Commander Tilley is now in the United
States, but will return to Pago Pago on
the naval transport Solace, which is
scheduled to rfail from here on the 15th
inst. If he does not go on the Solace
he will be a passenger on the mail steam
ship Sonoma, which sails on the 24th inst.
The Solace will take down to Pago Pago
a lot of anchors, chains and general
stores to the naval station. These were
to have gone on the schooner Ju}ia E.
Whalen, but at the last moment the Gov
ernment countermanded the order and
put the Solace in commission.
Cruiser Will Start for the Isthmus
Some Time Next "Week.
PHILADELPHIA; FOR PANAMA.
IN another week or so there will bo
an amalgamation of shipping inter
ests that will be the strongest ever
known in the history of the 'port.
The Steamship Managers' Associa
tion, the Shipowners' Association and the
steam schooner owners are now practi
cally one concern and in future will gov
ern all matters pertaining to the shipping
ami paying off of ships" crews.
The formation of the Shipowners' As
soeiution dates back to the big strike of
sailors several -years ago. Since that time
the members of the association have
shipped and paid off their men in the
office of the association. The Steamship
Managers' Association was formed a few
months ago as the result of certain de
mands made by the Sailors' Union. The
steam echooner owners are the latestr ad
dition to the compact.
Members of the three different bodies
held informal talks, and finally a meeting
was called for last Wednesday. There
were present at it J. R. Hanify of J. R.
Hanify & Co. and C. A. Hooper of C. A.
Hooper & Co., representing the steam
schooner owners; Captain Goodall of
Goodall. Perkins & Co. and E. R. Di
mond of 'Williams, Diraond & Co., repre
senting the Steamship Managers' Asso
ciation, and Henry E. Pennell of the
Simpson Lumber Company and Captain
Goodman of Alexander & Baldwin, repre
senting the Shipownt-rs' Association.
After considerable discussion the steam
schooner owners decided to ' join the
Steamship Managers' Association, but for
the time being will ship all their men
through the Shipowners' Association.
That is as far as the matter has gone at
present, but on the 15th inst., when an
other meeting is to be held, the chances
are that all three concerns will amalga
mate and form a large central associa
tion.

The Grand Jury returned three indict
ments yesterday. The first was against
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper, or Ernest
Chadwick, the liberated jailbird, who was
recently sentenced by Judge Lawlor to
ten years' imprisonment at San Quentln.
The Grand Jury had already returned one
indictment against Cooper, but it proved
defective. The new arraignment is on a
charge. of perjury in having testified that
he had given certain telegrams in Ogden
to Miss Norine Schneider. Cooper's ball
was fixed at $5000 on the new charge.
The other indictments were against
Leonard Nott and C. Roland, two strikers,
who took the star, club and pistol away
from a special policeman on the water
front. The charge in each case was rob
bery. Bail was fixed at $500.
"Sir" Harry West-wood Cooper, Re
cently Convicted, Must Answer

GRAND JURY RETURNS
THEEB INTXECTMENTS
"It is a wonder that the Southern Pa
cific Company has not made this rule be
fore. In the East none but those pur
chasing overland tickets are allowed to
board the train. Many people complain
about the Southern Pacific Company, but
coming right down to bare facts it is one
of the most lenient roads in America."
There will bo wailing and gnashing of
teeth over a new order of the Southern
Pacific* Company which went Into effect
yesterday. In the futre only those with
transportation will bo allowed on over
land trains.
It has been the custom of friends of
those going East to make the trip to the
Oakland mole and ride on the overland
trains as far as the Sixteenth-street sta
tion with them. In the same way it is
the custom to go to the same depot and
ride with friends coming from the East
to the mole on their return trip.
Superintendent Frazler issued an order,
which went into effect yesterday, allow
ing only those who carry overland tickets
to ride on overland trains, and in the fu
ture friends of travelers will have to be
satisfied with saying a farewell at the
Oakland mole.
A prominent railroad official, in speak
ing, of the new order, said:
Privilege of Going to Six
teenth Street Is Abol
ished.
Only Ticket Holders Can
Ride on Overland
Trains.

was to hnve been played on the campus
on November 2 between Oregon and Cali

Oreijon refused the game on account of
the loss of time and the heavy expense
of the trip.
Then they came into the stretch again,
and the runner pushed the stallion a lit
tle harder, Ketcham calling on him to
even greater exertions, and finally Bwun?
the whip over his back, careful, however,
that not even the snapper touched the
velvety skin. The horses went under the
wire in 2:09%, which is the fastest miie
ever trotted on a half mile track.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 11.â Cresceus this
afternoon lowered the world's trotting
record on a half-mile track a quarter of
a second. The record was previously held
by himself, having been made on the lo
ledp track a year ago. It was 2:09%. He
trotted for the benefit of the charitable
institutions of the city and more than
40,000 people gathered to see him. The re
ceipts were $18,000.
Cresceus got a very slow start, and Mike
the Tramp, the running mate, led Cresceus
to the first turn, when he pulled out and
Crebccus swung in the trail. With the run
ner at the wheel Cresceus buckied down to
the work in hand. On they went in the
same relative positions and they passed
the quarter in j2Vi. As he made the turn
into the home stretch for the first hiilf
mile there was deafening applause from
the throng, but Cresceus only increased his
speed. They flashed under the wire at the
half just one minute and four and a half
secoiids after the word had been given.
The three-quarter pole was reached at
O'Brien showed clever blocking and ring
generalship, but did not have the force to
give a knockout blow at any time. He
worked at Turner's stomach during the
entire , fight, but the colored fighter-was as
fresh at the close as his white opponent.
The only knockdown in the fight was in
the eighteenth round, when Turner
slipped and O'Brien caught him a short
left in the stomach. The colored boy took
the count. Turner's mistake was in lay
ing up the first six rounds in an effort to
protect his friends, who bet on the second
line. In that time O'Brien obtained a big
lead on points.
STOCKTON, Oct. ll.-At the close of
twenty hot rounds, Referee Ed Smith of
the Reliance Club, Oakland, to-night gave
Jack O'Brien of New York the decision
'over Rufe Turner, the Stockton fighter.
The men fought at 133 pounds and gave
a pretty battle from start to finish, with
honors even, according to general' opinion,
but the referee decided for O'Brien. Tur
ner laid back the first six rounds and
made a waiting fight, with O'Brien bor
ing in at all times. After the sixth it
was give and take.

hard, but they tried all the time.
Candidates of various political parties
were Introduced and made short speeches.
Billy McDonald and Frank George
fougnt_four desperate rounds to a draw.
ine bout between Fred Landers and Ed
Snider was won by the former in the sec
ond round. He knocked Snider down sev
eral times.
In the first round it was apparent Kelly
was not trying his hardest. In the second
he commenced to warm up, but his oppo
nent was so awkward as to be hard to
reach. Kelly tired badly in the third and
was nearly put out. Nolan was in dis
tress, owing to lack of condition, but
proved game beyond all expectations. In
the last round Kelly freshened up a bit,
but he could not make the man in front
of him stop. This round was one of the
most sensational ever fought in the club,
where sensational fighting is the rule.
Of the eight bouts on the programme
two were draws, the remainder ending
inside of two rounds.
Referee Greggains stopped the first bout,
between Bob Ennis and Bob Mitchell
early in the second round. Mitchell
showed no knowledge of boxing, but stood
a. lot of punishment in the first round. He
had enough early in the second and went
down to avoid punishment.
Jim Sharkey and Jack Cordell fought
like a pair of animated windmills, their
arms never being at rest. Cordell showed
the most experience. He stopped his op
ponent in the second round.
Joe Rose lasted only half a minute in
rront of C. Peterson. He was knocked
down several times and finally stayed
down.
"Cyclone" Kelly stirred up a tempest
last night in the gymnasium of the San
Francisco Athletic Club. He was matched
to fight Tom Sears, but the latter did not
appear. "Bob" Nolan, an inoffensive look-
Ing boxer from Redding, was. anxious to
make his debut here and was sent into the
ring with the man who bears the danger
ous name.
San Francisco won from Oakland at
baseball yesterday by a score of 13 to 1.
This lone tally, which separated the men
from across the bay from a complete
shutout, was practically a gift. Iburg let
down his speed In the ninth and allowed
two base hits. In the other eight Innings
only one hit was secured. In these same
innings only one Oaklander reached first
base, and he did not get beyond It. The
fielding of the "Wasps was of the sharpest
character, many apparently Impossible
stops and throws to first base being made.

New Divorce Suits Filed.
The following suits for divorce were
filed yesterday: J. B. Roberts against
.Agnes Roberts for Infidelity, Emma Stern
berger against John Sternberger for fail
ure to provide.
In response to a general request of the
audience Rev. Father Clifford, who is the
possessor of a powerful barytone voice,
gave a -selection of sweet Gaelic melodies
that won admiration' from his hearers.
After the rendition of "Savourneen^Dee
lish Eileen Oge," Father Clifford was
forced to respond to an encore, and in a
tuneful voice of sweetness he again
pleased the large audience with "The Col
leen Dhas Cruthin Na Moe," in old Gaelic.
It being the unanimous wish of those
present to hear an Anglo-Irish ballad by
Rev. Father Looney, the young clergy
man sang with fine effect one of the most
touching melodies by the Bard of Erin,
"The Meeting of the Waters."
A reception and introduction" of the
guests of the evening followed the liter
ary exercises, which were closed with
prayers in Gaelic and English for the fu
ture success and welfare of the school.
After the installation of permanent offi
cers and a short course of easy lessons
in Gaelic under the direction of head
principal, Rev. M. D. Clifford, assisted by
volunteer teachers from the sister
branches, was given.
President Miss Margaret O'Brien then
announced the literary exercises. .
The programme commenced with a Gae
lic essay by Miss Kathleen M. Murphy,
whose brilliant effort was cordially^ re
ceived. Thomas J. Cannon followed with
a bilingual address in Gaelic and English
from the pen of Father O'Leary, a noted
Gaelic writer of short stories. After a
popular Irish ballad by John Mullen, en
titled "Shule Agra," which won applause,
the meeting was addressed by Secretary
Theodore Lynch of the Father O'Growney
Branch. Aft'er words of appreciation of
the generous welcome and hospitality ac
corded the visitors, who were agreeably
surprised and edified at the attendance
and enthusiasm, of the Mission Gaelic
schools, Lynch added to the pleasure of
the evening's entertainment ! by a dra
matic recitation from the works of Thom
as Davis, the young Irish pÂ«et.
\u25a0 A plaintive Irish ballad, "Eileen Aroon,"
was rendered by Stephen McCue. He was
followed by a Gaelic essay by Principal
William ' Desmond of the O'Growney
School, the pioneer Gaelic institute of the
coast. â¢ :
The meeting -was called to order at 8
o'clock by th& organizer of the school,
Rev. Father E. M. Looney, who extended
a welcome to the audience. After an elo
quent address showing the glorious tradi
tions associated with the poetic and pow
erful Gaelic tongue Father Looney thank
ed the volunteer teachers present on be
half of the students of the parish for their
untiring zeal and self-sacrifice in the work

The raisin district. Forecaster McAdie
says, will be benefited by the existing con
ditions. The predictions are that to-day's
weather will be a repetition of yesterday
and that the break in conditions will not
come until to-morrow.
Forecaster McAdie feels It his duty to
\u25a0warn the residents and the city's visitors
not to be fooled into changing- their cloth
ing for summer wear, as a fall of 20 de
grees will most likely occur when normal
weather resumes sway.
These climatic conditions are at present
confined to about 150 miles of coast of
which San Francisco is the center. The
bay counties feel it most, but to-morrow
its effects will be upon almost the entire
State.
Unlike any previous, weather, It contin
ued until sundown, and at that hour the
high point was still maintained.
Warm weather prevailed yesterday, and
the day was recorded as the hottest of
the year. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning
the temperature began to rise and before
noon the mercury had reached the 80 de
gree mark. The usual early afternoon
west wind that can almost be depended on
failed to come to the rescue of the swel
tering populace, and the temperature con
tinued to rise until 88 degrees had been
recorded.

At all events, Senator Clark is far too
able and practical a man to build his road

"That defendant, on or about September
11, 1901, abandoned and deserted plaintiff
at the city of New 5Tork, leaving their
apartments and announcing his intention
of not returning to plaintiff, since which
time defendant has failed and refused to
provide for her." ... .. .
Sewell is vice president of the American
Smelting and Refining Company, known
as the smelting trust. Mrs. Sewell and her
husband had apartments at the Waldorf-
Astoria, and in an affidavit she Rays she
has always been' a faithful, loving wife.
She says in the spring of 1901, at the de
fendant's suggestion, in. company of her
eldest son she sailed for Europe and re
mained abroad for a period of. some
months, returning to New York on Sep
tember 11 last. "Immediately upon her ar
rival In New York." she goes on to say,
"the defendant abandoned and deserted
her apartments, and ever since has re
sided elsewhere."
She asserts Sewell's income, according to
his own admission last year, was between
$40,000 and $50,000. Sewell denies all his
wife's allegations and intends to fight the
proceedings. The cause of the family

WIFE CENSURES
RICH HUSBAND
Six thousand tons of raisins of the crop
of 1900 were put upon the market yester
day by a decision of Judge Sloss. The or
der to show cause why an Injunction
should not be issued to James Madison
and Charles G. Bonner, raisin growers,
who sought to prevent the distribution of
the crop, was set aside.
The suit grew out of an agreement made
by the growers and the California Raisin
Packing Company whereby the entire
crop of raisins of the season of 1900 was
to be sold by the Raisin Growers' Asso
ciation to the packing company. The
agreement stipulated that the crop, which
amounted to 30,000 tons, was to be distrib
uted in proportion to the business done
by each grower. Under these terms Mad
ison and Bonner would receive as their
share 2400 tons. The agreement was car
ried out by both parties until June of this
year, at which time there were 6000 tons
undistributed.
The following month Madison and Bon
ner filed a suit in which they alleged that
the other parties to the agreement had
conspired to sell the remainder of the crop
to the Pacific Coast Seeded Raisin Com
pany, which was formed by them.
The filing of the suit for an injunction
brought into the fight all the growers In
Fresno County, and until Judge Sloss ren
dered his decision the 6000 tons were
tied up.

Sullivan annDuneed that he would come
into court next Tuesday with a bid of
J20.000 for the property which has been
sold for $13,000.
Sullivan reappeared at the end of the
half-hour's grace allowed him by the
court, but he had not been able to ac
complish anything. His motion for a con
tinuance was denied, and Judge Seawell
afterward made an order confirming the
sale.
Attorney Metson and ex- Judge Slack,
who represent the interested parties, took
exceptions to Sullivan's intimations, and
stated to the court that the attorney's ap
pearance at the eleventh hour wa& hardly
proper. Sullivan was asked why, if he
thought there was a conspiracy, he did
not put in an appearance during the ear
lier days of the trial.
Sullivan replied that he was under the
impression that the attorneys who repre
sented" the other heirs would ask for a
continuance, and relied upon them to do
so.
Attorney Matt I. Sullivan appeared in
JudgÂ» Scawell's court yesterday after
noon during the hearing of the suit insti
tuted by Mrs. Morfcw to secure an ordev
of ccurt confirming the sale to hot of a
piece of property by ihe Ciooks estate,
and ahked for a continuance. Sullivan in
support of his motion made a iengthy
statement, in which he intimated that the
parties interested in the suit had con-
Bplred to secure the property at a price
much lower than its real value.
Attorney Sullivan represents the minor
heirs cf one of the Crooks, and claims
that if the property is sold for $t3 000 his
clients will suffer a great loss.
"If the i ersons interested in this case,"
said Sullivan, "the grown persons I mean,
fcet together and form a conspiracy by :
which the minor children whom I repre
sent are to suffer, I certainly think I
should be allowed time En which to file
a protest."
Geo:ge D% Collins, counsel for "Walter
M. Diirmick, on trir.1 in the United States
];;5trift Court (or presenting a false
toucber to the cafihfer cf the Mint, occu
pied ilio whole of yesterday's session in
bis 'argument to the jury. He closes at
6:15 p. m. Ex-Judge S. C\ Den?on will
make the closing argument for the Gov
crnmci.t. beginning ai 10 k. m. to-day.
Mr. CoUUui took the aprprressive in his
argument, denied the assertion of impar
tiality put forth for ihe prosecution in the
argument of Ben Schlesiagcr on the pre
vious day and insinuated that Superin
tendent Ker.cli and Cashier Cole should be
convicted Instead of the defendant. He
boldly charged the prosecution with un
fairrcss in the cross-examination of the
\u25a0Fitnesses on reputation when the counsel
for the Government asked whether the
\u25a0witnesses had heard of certain transac
tions of Dimmick with the Tallant Bank
ing Company, J. S. Kirk of Chicago, the
Cutter-Tower Company of Boston and
other matters concerning which they had I
not attempted to introduce a particle of j
evidence.
The real law-breaker, said Mr. Collins,
is Superintendent l^each, and In this case
the sanctity v.hich the prosecution has
alleged surrounds a public official merely
because he is such does not apply to Mr.
Leach, for he grossly violated the treas
ury regulations in his management of the
Mint by allowing the Selby Company to
offset a claim that the United States held
against it. Continuing Collins said:
Purpose that E3L0G4 were missing out of the
cuÂ»toai- cf liie oat!:ier. and *Ji>iK>se ibat Mr.

you to know that ihere is sumethins in this
CiUB? other :haii the bald charge of the presen
tation of this voucher lor *4l'5> 37â ihis voucher
"which by ray agreement." says .Leach, was
to he exhausted by credit for material fur
nished to the Mint. Section 4 of article 21 j
o! the Kevised Statutes of the United States i
provides ihat all funds received irom the sale
tit ty-produrts. oid material, etc.. shall be
separately deposited on the last aay of each
Quarter in tr.e tub-Treasury of the United
Ma us and that no portico of. the moneys col
lected for the purpose named shall be used for
tJ.e jiaytnent 01 exi-enset of any kind. Leach
clearly violated this law. so ihat the proceeds
of liie sale of old material never reached th.e
treasury vf the United States. The money
was i.*i-d tcr eJLpenses contrary to this regu
lation. From that point on everything was
c Tie in this case as j^eaci ordered and wanted
to be done.
His or. n testimony sTioirs what a rross law
breaker this man Leach is. * - lt was my under
standing with RaJyton," 1 saj-s Leach, "to keep
this account ssxiarate from the regular pur
chase account of the &fint_" Leach had no
rirbx to exclude this transaction from that
accciin^
Mr. Collins n-ext turned his attention to
showing that the alleged fraudulent
voucher â¢ f or (OS 22 was a genuine claim.
It was marked paid on March 26, he said,
\u25a0when in point of fact it \u25a0was never paid
Â£t all. tut was f=et off by material re
ceived from the Selby Company. Cashier
Cole carat in for a scorching because he
admitted that at the time he paid the
money to DimirLicS: he thought - Uiat the
trimsacticm vr&s peculiar, yet he waited
ten months before he informed Superin
tendent Leach cf that transaction.
Counsel commented upon the fact that
Cashier Cole mad* no memorandum of
the receipt of the voucher and the pay
ment of the money as evidence that Cole
"understood that the matter \ras to re
main in abeyance, and this proved that
Dimmick"s version cf the affair was Uio :
oniy correct one.
It \rzs necessary* the counsel argtied.
that the prosecution should prove that
Dimmick had a criminal intent to defraud
the Government of $49S 37 before it could
expect a verdict of conviction, even as
suming- that the voucher was fraudulent.
On the contrary, the evidence tvus that
DiffijnicJs returned the money to Cole, and
that Cole, while admitting the fact of the
repayment cf the money by the defend
ant, at the same time admitted that he
had made no entry of the transaction in
h:<= books, thus corroborating' the explana
tion made by the defendant.
In conclusion Collins said:
Cg3Â» is about tb* trickiest -witness I ever
raw on the etaa4- He diss-linalttes all tfcrougti
the material portion of hi* testimony and I
cay that a man \u25a0who cannot be believed on a

A NEW DEPARTURE
A New, Effectual and Convenient
Cure for Catarrb.
Of catarrh remedies there' is no end,
but of catarrh cures there has always
been a great scarcity. There are many
remedies to relieve, but very few that
really cure.
The old practice of snuffing salt water
through the nose would often relieve, and
the washes, douches, powders and inhal-
ers in common use are very little, if any,
better than the old fashioned salt water
douche. '
The use of Inhalers and the application
of salves, washes and powders to the
nose and throat to cure catarrh Is no
more reasonable than to rub the back to
cure kidney disease. Catarrh ls just aa
much a blood disease as kidney trouble
or rheumatism and it cannot be cured
by local treatment any more than they
can be.
To cure catarrh, whether In the head,
throat or stomach an internal antiseptic
treatment is necessary to drive the catar-
rhal poison out of the blood and system,
and the new catarrh cure is designed on
this plan and the remarkable success of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is because be-
ing used Internally It drives out catarrh-
al Infection through action upon stom-
ach, Hver and bowels. .
Wm. Zimmerman of St. Joseph relates
an experience with catarrh which is of
value to millions of catarrh sufferers
everywhere.. He says: "I neglected a
slight nasal catarrh until It gradually ex-
tended to my throat and bronchial tubes
and finally even my stomach and liver
became affected, but as I was able to
keep up and do a day's work I let it run
along until my hearing began to fail me
and then I realized that I \u25a0 must get rid
of catarrh or lose my position, as I .was
clerk and my hearing was absolutely
necessary. .
"Some of my friends recommended an
Inhaler, another a catarrh salve, but they
were no good in my- case, nor was any-
thing else until I heard of Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets and bought a package at
my drug store. They benefited me from
the start and in less than four months
I was completely cured of catarrh,
although I had suffered nearly all my life,
from it. , \u25a0.
"They are pleasant to take and so
much more convenient to use than other
catarrh remedies that I feel I cannot
say enough in favor of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets.". \u25a0
A little book on cause and cure of ca-
tarrh will be mailed free by addressing
F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich., and
the tablets are sold by all - druggists in
tha United States and Canada.

D0NT HURT SOME
Eut Coffee Certainly Ruins Some of
the Most Highly Organized
People.
"One year I lived where the water was
bitter \rith. Iron and I could not bear to
firink It, so I began drinking coffee three
times a <3ay.
"Gradually I noticed an uncomfortable
feeling In the stomach, anfi more or less
constipation. In a few months I began to
lie avrake at night long- after I had re-
tired.
"This Increased, until I never thought
of going to sleep before three or four
o'clock In the morning, and : then only
after getting out of bed and walking the
floor for an hour.
"I was talking- of my nervous state with
a friend, who suggested that perhaps It
was the. coffee I had been using. Ehe
felt quite sure It was, and stated that cof-
fee would not stay on her stomach at all,
but as Ehe felt she must have a hot drink
for breakfast Ehe had been using Postum
Food Coffee. She said she didn't like
Postum particularly well, and at break-
fast the next morning I didn't wonder,
when I tasted thÂ© flat <5rink that the ser-
vant brought on.
"The same day I was Invited to take iin-
nÂ»r with another friend, Mrs. Foster. I
had visited her often before and knew she
made delicious coffee, so when she asked
how I liked her coffee, said. 'It is just as
fine es usual.' 6he invited me to have

ADVERTISEMENTS.
The Kind That Men Admire.
Men admire a pretty face and a good figure, but sooner or later learn that
the happy woman, â that contented one is most of all to be admired.
Those troubled with fainting spells, irregularity, nervous irritability,
backache, the blues and that dreadful bearing down feeling cannot hope to bo
happy, and advancement in either home or social life is impossible.
It is clearly shown in the young lady's letter which follows that Ijydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will cer ainly cure the sufferings of wo-
men ; and when one considers that Miss Murphy's letter is only one of the count-
less hundreds which we are continually publishing in the newspapers of this
country, the great virtue of Mrs. Pinkham'- medicine must be admitted by all ;
and for the absolute cure of all kinds of female ills no substitute can possibly
take its place. ' Women should bear this important fact in mind "when they go
into a drug store, and be sure not to accept anything that is claimed to bo
"just as good." as liydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, for no
other medicine for female ills has made so many actual cures.
MISS MARGARETTA MURPHY, J
President "Lend-a-Hand Club," Seattle, Wash.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â For three years I suffered with bearing
down pains, backache, became nervous and hysterical and could not â¢
enjoy life as other young \u25a0women did. A lady friend who had suffered
similarly and been cured, suggested that I try Lydia E. Pinkliaxn's Veg-
etable Compound. I had little faith hi it, but nevertheless I gave it a
trial, and I am glad that I did. I kept getting better gradually and my
pains left me and within four months I was a well woman. This is a
year ago and I have never had any trouble since. I wish all suffering
women knew of your valuable medicine. â Yours very truly, Makgabi-
etta 'Murphy, 2703 Sec. Ave., Seattle, Wash." " . :

Failures in the United States for the week
number 1?3, as against 175 last week, 210 in
this week a year ago, 164 in 1899 and 233 in
1898.
The boot, shoe. leather and kindred Indus
tries were all active and Eastern- shoe ship
ments are 14 per cent larger for the week and
12 per cent larger for the season than a year
ago. The strength of hides and the recent ad
vance in leather, however, is still further nar
rowing the margin of profit, in shoe manufac
turing.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 4,719,898 bushels, as against 6,195,749
last week, and 4,292,855 in this week last year.
Wheat exports, July 1 to date (fourteen weeks),
aggregate 89,568,178 bushels, as against 50,458,240
last season.
Among cereal products ' the feature is the
active demand for: flour at higher prices.
Wheat is a fraction higher on the week, on a
belief that following the recent decline caused
by the heavily increased movement at the
Northwest and the gain in visible supply reac
tion -is due. â¢ .. , ... .1 . â¢ .
Hardware is active at nearly all markets
and supplies are generally limited. Some
weakness in nails is noticed at the Kast, not
withstanding active demand, but at the West
\u25a0wire mills are behind on orders. Special activ
ity in lead and zinc Is noted at Western pri
mary points. Copper is in hand-to-mouth de
mand here, but it is to be noted that spot
prices have advanced at London. Tin is higher
here in' sympathy with the speculative' advance
at the. same market. â . â¢
. Iron and steel continue in active demand,
particularly for the cruder forms, such as pig,
and for finished . products affected by the re
cent strike.
The great mass of prices the country over
show few important changes, and this steadi
ness, In fact, is a notable feature of the trade
situation. The feature in sugar is ,the partial
restoration of the large reduction made in re
fined sugar at the West last week. Instead of
the 3%c quotation Of last week 4%c is now
asked, the large orders received at- the' lower
price making It certain that the full reduction
was an extreme one . .
NEW TORK. Oct. 11.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row -will say:
Some quieting down in the general demand
for merchandise is noted this week, partly the
result of weather conditions, such as r.ains in
the Northwest and warmer weather at the
West, while at the South the restricted move
ment of cotton delayed collections at several
markets. The lull in the demand for dry
goods, clothing and shoes from Western jab
bers is. however, not unexpected, being ac
counted for by the advanced ' stage of the sea
son. .A slight upward swing in prices is noted
this week, following the general gain in all
staples down in" September, but the changes
in cereals are small, whether upward or down
ward.

\u25a0 NEW TORK. Oct. tLâ Great speculative ac
tivity continued in the stock market to-day,
tut It was centered to a large extent in trans
continental Etocks, led by St. Paul, which rose
Â£% points over last night in the late dealings,
and closed 1 point below the btst. The ap

last spring, dear to the memory of tie pro

\u25a0new railroad system or a new transcontinental
combination iras rumored each successive day

CHICAGO, Oct.. It-Considerable activity fol
lowed the opening of the corn market, induced
largely by the disappointment among the bear
clique, which expected a decided advance In
the olHcial crop report. At the close yesterday
this advance was predicted at at least five
points, and bears had sold freely in conse
quence. When, however, October's condition
wa% reported at but 52.1, as compared with Sep
tember's at 51.7, quick covering was the re
sult. December closed firm, %c higher, at 56%c.
Wheat ruled fairly active and higher, De
cember opening- %@%c higher on improved
cables at 69Vi@69%c. Statistics. If anything,
were bearish. Receipts were still very liberal,
though falling off somewhat in the Southwest.
Clearances were small and the export demand
was sluggish. In spite of these influences
wheat gained material strength, principally
from the corn report, and rose steadily through
out the session on -covering by shdrts. There
was some outside demand, which helped, and
December sold to 70VÂ»c, easing off a trifle at
the end and closing strong, %c higher, at 70c.
Oats were moderately active early, but dull
and narrow later in the day. December closed
a shade lower at 35Vi@35%c.
An easy market in provisions at the opening
resulted from a renewed selling for the local
and outside accounts. Prices sagged rapidly
for a time in spite of a stronc hog market,
but on a development of a considerable local
demand, thought to be an effort of packers to
keep prices up, January products reacted and
held steady. January pork closed 12%o ad
vanced, lard 7%c up and ribs 5c higher.

Everything on the list is quoted dull. There
seems to be a cessation of the demand at the
moment, though a reaction is expected to ap
pear at any time. Brokers say that even con
cessions fail to induce buyers to take hold.
The fact is the buying was so furious a month
or so ago that everybody got loaded up and
will not resume buying until stocks need re
plenishing. â¢

London Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 11.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The tone of the stock market was distinctly
Improved to-day, and there was much more ac
tivity, especially in the American department,
jj Copper shares spurted with Amalgamated
Co1>per, Rio Tlntos 1% and Anacondas 1%.
American stocks opened with London a free
buyer, expecting handsome profits, but New
Tork etolidlty made London sulk, although the
reaction was unimportant. The coal stocks
were the favorites in the expectation of a re
vival of the combination. Erie was In particu
lar demand. London.' observing that New Tork
is all the time absorbing, talks of. a resump
tion of the bull movement, and the activity of
the Morgan, Hill and Harriman interest en
courages buyers. - V-iâ¢

California Fruit Sales.
Failures for the week numbered 231 in the
United States against 232 last year and 34 in
Canada, against 32 iast year.
Wholesome activity is still the feature at iron
furnaces and steel mills. While old orders are
tilled efs rapidly as possible, there Is no imme
diate prospect of catching up with contracts,
especially as each day brings new business with
delive rles running far into next year.
l J igiron production on October 1, according to
the- Iron Age, was at the rate of 307,982- tons
weekly, an increase of S112 tons over the output
on September 1 and 84,813 tons more than in
October, 1800. Yet furnace stock steadily de
creased, amounting only to 361,593 tons October
1, against 670,541 a year ago and supplies In
consumers hands are believed to be light. Foot
wear shops are still producing at. full capacity,
not only in the old-established New England
factories, but In this State and in the West and
houth; prices are unchanged also, although
manufacturers contemplate the advancing of
the leather market with some Increasing inter
est. Hides and leather are at the top price of
the year, while the finished product sells below
the prices of early spring. \u25a0 \u25a0
Quiet conditions prevail in the dry goods mar
w ' not because of light demand, but through
the strong views of sellers, which prevent ex-
POrt sales as TreU as domestic business.
â¢silently better relative prices have been es
tablished by the leading cereals, wheat making
a fair gain, while corn lost a little of its ex
ceptional strength.- There is no evidence of
holding back for higher prices in Western re
ceipts for two weeks of 15.83S.426 bushels,
against 12,918,3S3 last year, when more attrac
tive quotations prevailed. . Export3 from the
United States are not equal to the recent rec
ord-breaking figures, but" still compare fairly
well with earlier years. For the week, flour
included, shipments reached 4.188,328 bushels,
a sainst 3,583.438 a year ago. and 4,329,829 for
toms. labor is well employed at good wages and
the- buying power of the people is more than
sufficient to meet the advance In the cost of
living of 4.6 per cent over the price prevailing a
year a^o..

OAKLAND, Oct. 11.â There is disquie
tude among the constabulary of the coun

new county government act, which super
sedes the present one after the election
one year from next January, will reduce
their number in the townships of the
county. At present there are two consta
bles connected with each township court,
but the new law provides that there shall
be but one In cities and towns where there
are city justices' and recorders' court with
city marshals to do the work of the con
stabulary.
As there Is some question about the
meaning of the new law it is probable that
a Judicial decision wlll\ be sought by the

The land lies in small valleys surround

grass for stock. The State is building the
canal system and will own and operate it
in perpetuity for the sole benefit of the
occupants of. the land and without prolit
to any one, making the enterprise entire
ly co-operative in nature. This.. Is -the
first irrigating canal on the American con
tinent to be built and operated by a State
government, and undoubtedly* marks an
epoch tn the great irrigation progress. \u25a0

Reporting upon the study of yellow
fever by a board in Cuba General Stern
berg says: :
The results obtained were especially' valu
able, showing; that the bacillus lctsroida bears
no causative relation to yellow fever, and that
the mosquito serves as an intermediate post
for tha parasite of this disease. Further ex
periments ol a most interesting character
demonstrated that yellow fever la transmitted
to non-Immune3 by the bile of a mosquito that
has previously fed on the blood of those sick
with this disease; that yellow fever can aleo
be produced by the KUbcutaheous Injection of
blood taken from the general circulation dur
ing the first and second days .of the disease;
that an attack of yellow fever produced by
the bite of the mosquito confers immunity
against the subsequent injection of infected
blood; that yellow fever Is not conveyed by
clothing, beddlns- or merchandise soiled by
contact with those sick with the disease;
that a house may be said to be Infected with
yellow fever only when there are present in
it mosquitoes-capable of conveying the para
site of the disease, and that the spread of
yellow fever can be most effectively controlled
by measures directed to the destruction of mos
quitoes and the protection of the sick against
the bites of these insects.
General Sternberg says the results of
the investigation are of far-reaching Im
portance, as the surgeons are now in pos
session of knowledge which enables them
to "Stamp out yellow fever.
The deaths jfrom all causes amounted to
28.75 per thousand of strength, as com
pared with 30.58 in the- previous year. Dis
ease occasioned 20.26 deaths, the principal
cause being dysentery, which, with other
intestinal diseases, gave a ratio of 9.08.
The rate from injury amounted to 8.49
The death rate in China was large, 47.7<>
per thousand of strength, 23.62 from dis
ease and 24.14 from, injury. , . .
Since the close of the calendar year 1900
the health of the troops in the Philippines
has been steadily improving. The health
of the troopa in Cuba during the /ear was
excellent. As a result of American occu
pation nearly every city and town has
had its sanitary condition improved.
Speaking of special diseases General
Sternbersr.says: .
The steady decrease cf late years in the ad
missions for alcoholism among the men of the
regular army la a matter for congratulation.
Military ofllcera may be said to be unenimoua
in their opinion that thl3 13 mainly the result
of the establishment of tho post exchange, or
canteen, at military posta. There is \u25a0 lesa
drunkenness among troops in active service

WASHINGTON, Oct. 11.â Surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg has made his annual report
to the Secretary of War. He says the
health of the army has been unusually
good during the calendar year 1900. The
admission rate to hospitals for all causes
in the army, volunteers and regulars, with
a mean strength of 100.3S9, in 1900, was
2311.81 per thousand of strength, as com
pared with 2178.06 in the previous year; but
during 1899 only 39.2S0 men out of a total
of 105,516 were serving in the Philippines,
while during the past year 66,882 of a total
of 100,389 were thus serving.
In the Philippine Islands, with a mean
strength of 66,882, the admission rate was
2621.9G, as compared with 2395.52 in the pre
vious year, this increase being mainly due
to sickness among the volunteers. The
regulars, on the other hand, showed a
marked decrease in the ratio of admission
for disease, which fell from 2454.10 to
2197.73. Two-thirds of the admissions for
disease were caused by malarial fevers
and diarrheal diseases. . .
Strained relations exist between the
Board of City Trustees and the Board of
Foremen and Engineers of the Fire DÂ»
partment. The tension was not lesst-ned
by the action of the latter body last night
lii practically nullifying the efforts of the
municipal rulers to reorganize a flrst
claes volunteer fire company at the West
End by absolutely refusing to grant cer
tificates to fifteen citizens who were elect
ed'to membership in the company. The
fifteen candidates who were rejected by
the foremen. and engineers last night had
been Induced through the labors of the
fire committee of the City Trustees to
join AVhidden Hose Company. The Board
of Foremen and Engineers took the stand
that as Whidden Hose Company had but
lour members it could not elect any one
to membership.
There is considerable feeling among the
West Enders. They claim that the ac
tion was taken for the reason that many
of the members of the old Whidden Com
pany were not friendly to the present
Chief of the Fire Department.
Another action taken by the Board of
Foremen and Engineers and one which is
a cause of much criticism is the refusal
to pay any attention, to the resignation of
Thomas R. Hanson from the Fire De
partment. Charges of misbehavior had
been placed against Hanson by Acting
Chief F. K. Millington. Rather than
stand trial Hanson resigned. This tbe
Board of Foremen and Engineers held he
had not right to do and that body has
decided to try him anyhow, Hanson's
trial Is set for. next Monday night.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 11.â Dissensions in the
Fire Department are being recorded with
a rapidity that is alarming tha City Trus

sidering the advisibility of raising the

BERKELEY, Oct. 11.â The members, of
the North Berkeley Hose Company will
take no part in the Firemen's Convention
to bo held to-morrow night in American
Hall. Delegates have been appointed
from the six other companies, but the
North Berkeleyans maintain that the
convention Is uncalled for and that the
Trustees should be left to deal with all
things pertaining to the new Fire De
partment now under the course of or
ganization. The convention will do Its
work without noticing the action of the
North Berkeley men. It will elect a.
Chief, whose 'name will be submitted â¢>
the Town Trustees for appointment as
head of the proposed salaried department
and will ask of the city government that
po one outside of the volunteer rank^ be
given positions with pay. The rolls of
all the companies will be closed against
applicants for membership.
Several candidates are out for the posi
tion of Fire Chief. The firemen have, in
vited the Trustees and business. men to
be present at their meeting.
Delegates from the various hose com
nanies have been selected a3 follows:

OAKLAND, Oct. 11.â Upon the showing
of Mrs. Eliza C. Avery that her husband
had obtained a decree of divorce from her
through fraud and deceit Judge Hall set
the decree aside this_ morning. â¢ Sfco
charged that she had made no contest cf
the case because she had been led to be
lieve by her husband that It was not nec
essary to appear until after a certain
date. After the decree was granted to her
husband she says she awoke to the real
ization that she had been deceived. Judgn
Hall took the ground that the courts
should take a broad view in such matters
and give divorcees every opportunity for
a full hearing. '
Emile Fritz was ordered by Judge Hail
to contribute $25 for the support of hia
wife pending the outcome of her suit for
divorce against him, desertion being thu
cause of action.
Judge Hall Takes Ground That Liti
gants Should Fully Present
Their Cases.

12* DORSE SCHHITZ FOR MAYOR,
SETS ASIDE DECREE
GRANTED THE AVERTS
At the general business meeting of the
Ebell Society this afternoon the proposed
amendments to the constitution, which
were defeated at the last assembly, were
carried by small majorities. The amend
ments Were: First, to increase the mem
bership limit from 400 to 500; second, to in
crease the initiation fee from $10 to ?25.
The arguments pro and con were many
and the contest was quite a lively one, a
great many of the members desiring to
keep the list within its present select lim
it and others deeming it wise to increase
the membership and initiation fees with
the end in view that the club may be en
abled in a shorter time to purchase a lot
and build more commodious quarters.
The question of furnishing the children's
room in the new public library was dis
cussed, but no action could be taken in the
matter. A two-thirds vote of all the
members is necessary before the commit
tee can fulfill the pledge which, it is stat
ed, was made to the library trustees that
the Ebell Society would be responsible for
$5000 toward furnishing the juvenile de
partment. The required number was not
present to-day, so another special meet
ing will have to be called, i
At the close of the business meeting this
afternoon the doors were thrown open to
the club's guests and a programme was
given under the auspices of the Shake
speare section, of which Mrs. J. R. Scup
ham is curator. Mrs. James Allen was
heard in two artistic vocal selections and
Mrs. Paul I^ohse gave a brief account of
how the "Shakespeare chairs" came to be
in the possession of the club. â¢ The three
articles of furniture are made of the pew
ends from an old church at Stratford^on-
Avon and one chair and the settee will
eventually become a portion of the fur
nishings In the children's room in the
free library.
The principal feature of the programme
was a Shakespearean sketch done by four
young ladles. Miss Dolly Chapman of
Alameda was an entertaining Ophelia and
MlS3 Lillian Quinn of San Francisco was
clever in the role of Portia. Lady Mac
beth and Juliet were impersonated by
Miss Nellie Inglis of San Francisco and
Miss Josephine Chapman x>f Alameda.

Superintendent of Schools McClymonds
has called for opinions from District At
torney Allen and City Attorney Johnson.
A special meeting of the Board of Edu
cation will be called for Monday night
to discuss the situation.
Regarding the conditions he said:
Although I am not In a position yet to give.
Official expression upon the subject I have a
private opinion, and I told Mr. McClymonds.
the Superintendent of Schools, what I thought
might be done. That was to lop off somÂ« of
the fancy frills at the Central High School
and tarn the money that could be saved over
to the night schools. But before I had finished
my story I was met by thÂ« Superintendent's
statement that the money now set aside for
High School purposes could not be used for
any other department.
There is no question that the night schools
with their hundreds of pupils, old and young,
who are struggling to get some education, are
immensely important. We can ill afford to
dispense with these schools, which are pro
viding training for pupils who could get it in
no other way.
I trust that the Board of Education will
promptly take this matter in hand and find sl
way out of the difficulty.
The announcement that under, a Su
preme Court decision the night schools
can no longer receive support from the
State school fund allowance, has created
much discussion in official circles. Tne
existing condition of Oakland's flnance3
renders the solution of the problem very
difficult. The interested officers are In a
quandary concerning the outcome. They
do not know what steps to take to pre
vent the shutting down of the schools.
Mayor Barstow insists that something
shall be done to maintain what he de
clares lo be one of the most ' Important
departments of the public school system.

"Rather than see the evening schools
close I would go up and down the
streets myself, hat in hand, to solicit the
money necessary to keep them open. And
there would be a jingle in the hat before
I approached the first man."
Such was Mayor _Anson Barstow's dec
laration to-day when he was apprised of
the situation pertaining to the night
schools of this city, where hundreds of
pupils, unable to attend school during the
daytime, receive the rudimentary educa
tion so important to their welfare.

Burning with a desire to outdo "Black
Bart" and other highwaymen Matilda Is
enberg, aged 10 years, turned road agent
yesterday and "stood up" another little
girl for her bicycle. She rode away with
the machine as fast as her little Ieg3
could make it go and enjoyed the extreme
pleasure of riding about the streets until
to-day, when - she . was detected and
brought to bay by Police Detective Kyte.
Miss Isenberg lives with her mother and
brothers and sisters at 1665 Grove street.
Yesterday afternoon she wandered down
toward Tenth and Clay streets. She saw
Margery Ryan, aged six years, who lives
with her parents in the neighborhood,
riding around on a bicycle. She im
mediately â¢ made up her mind that
she wanted it. She made a grab for
the cyclist 'as she sped by her and thsn
ensued a fight for the possession of the
wheel. After a struggle of several min
utes the' would-be highway girl came out
victor and mounting her prize soon dis
appeared in the distance, to the discom
fiture of the victim of the hold-up.
When little Miss Ryan's parents were
Informed of the robbery they notified the
Police Department and detectives were
detailed on the case." The sleuths did not
meet with any success until this "after
noon, when Detective Kyte located Miss
Isenberg as she wa3 riding around In the
neighborhood of her home. She denied
that she had stolen the property and in
sisted that her uncle gave.it to her for
Christmas, but the proof was too conclu
sive. The officer took girl and wheel to
the City Hall. There, when confronted by
Miss Ryan and her mother, the highway
girl broke down and confessed.
Miss Isenberg told her mother when
asked where she got the wheel that she
had won it in a drug store raffle. She wa3
sentenced by her parent to an acquain
tance with a slipper and a bread and
! water diet for twenty-four hours.

"General Buller's speech, pathetic in its
weakness, is," the Spectator asserts, '"the
best possible justification for the declara
tions that he is not fit to command an
army corps."
The ' Saturday Review refers to his
"petulant apology" as "sheer feminism,"
adding: "The mysterious conspirator
who Issued threats at Aldershot m'pht
have come from De Quincey's 'Confes
sions.' The demand that he be shown a
better commander than himself savored
of the challenge of a navvy in the ring."'
Sir Walter Peace, Agent General for
Natal, speaking in London to-night re
lerrtd to the unfortunate utterances of
Sir Redvers Buller and said:
"It must ever be remembered to Gen
eral Buller's credit that he saved South
Africa for Great Britain. But for his
change in the plans on his arrival at
Cape Town there is no doubt the Boers
would have gone down to Durban, and in
that case, in the light of what has since
happened, there is no doubt the Cape
Dutch would have risen and 1 the British
have been driven from South Africa."

LONDON, Oct. 12.â The etorm caused
by General Buller's remarkable outburst
continues to grow. The epeech is the one
topic of discussion and there Is general
anticipation that disciplinary measures
â¢will follow unless General Buller him

tive supporter of the Government as the
Standard and resigns.
The tone of the press la generally one

stuck to him throughout, and his and his
wife's social Influence has been most
powerful and has even reached the court.
It had been decided that he would be ele
vated to the peerage on the next honor
list, but it is now doubtful if, after yes
terday's confession that he advised the
surrender of Ladysmith, "a humiliation
compared with which," as the Standard
Fays, "all other reverses of the war
would have been trivial," even the ICing
and the people will continue to favor
him.
The Fremont Republican Club will re
ceive the Republican nominees this even
ing at the rooms of the club in the His
tory building.
The campaign to date- has not been
narked by excessive enthusiasm. The
Bear Club ratification of the Republican
ticket was adjourned, as only seven voters
assembled last Wednesday evening to
ratify.
The Supreme Court decision has set the
politicians to gossiping about the proba
bilities of an extra session of the Legis
lature. It is claimed that the county gov
ernment act was passed in the same faul
ty manner as that which rendered the
code legislation unconstitutional. The
prospects of 58 a day and promiscuous
junketing et the expense of the public
utatury afford del'ght to Senators and
Assemblymen. Many of the lawmakers
would be pleased to return to Sacramento
and devote six weeks considering a new
county government act
When interviewed on the subject of an
extra session the members of the Legis
lature said that the neglect of business
affairs incident to the session would cause
great hardship on them; yet if duty de
manded they would go to Sacramento
again and serve the people.
The Non-Partisan Convention, of which
Nathan Bibo is chairman and ex-Senator
Morehouse, A. G. Treadwell and Charles
G. Nagle are the bright lights, met at
B'liai ii'rith Hall last night and indorsed
Eugene E. Schmitz. the Union Labor par
ty's nominee, for Mayor. Norman W.
Hall, whose name has been mentioned as
one of the Non-Partisan delegates, is not
a member of the convention. He says tha
use of his name was unauthorized.
He was a delegate from the Thlrty
nir.th District in the late Republican Con
vention. The story that Joseph Fas6lfcr
had failed to accept the Democratic nomi
nation for Tax Collector is not authentic.
Mr. Fassler states that he sent his letter
oi acceptance to the secretary of the con
vention on October 7.
The Supreme Court in upsetting the re
v;sed codes rendered void many choice
specimens of railroad legislation, and as
a result a cloud of sorrow hangs over the
law department of the Southern Pacific
corporation. This blow, coming: on the
keels of the ruling of the Railroad Com
missioners touching the oil rates, creates
a surmise that something has happened
to cause a loosening "of the company's
grip.

Schnadhorst would do his best to check
the mad step. But, he said, if "your re
spected leader remains obdurate I shali
certainly call upon you to devote my sub
scription to some public charity."
In Schnadhorst's reply he says Rhodes*
money had already been spent, as he be
lieved it was given mainly to help the
home rule struggle. Schnadhorst, how
ever, assured Rhodes that Gladatone'8 ut
terances were only an expression of hi3
opinfon, that Sir William Vernon Har
court was also annoyed at them, and that
no scuttle out of Egypt was likely, as be
had seen Lord Rosebery, then slated for
Foreign Minister, who would not permit
it. being "a strong man. who will take his
own course, very different from the
pliant, supple Granville."
"On the reception of this." Rhodes says,
'I bothered no more, as upon Lord Rose
bery's appointment I knew that Egypt
was saved. I leave your readers to de
cide how far Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man is justified in characterizing the orig
inal statements as a lie from beginning to
en &\. According to their statements,
neither Sir Henry Caropbell-Bannerman
nor Sir William Harcourt are acquainted
with the facts. But I naturally assumed
that Mr. Schnadhorst was speaking with
authority;." . .

LONDON. Oct. H.-The Spectator to
morrow will print letters from Cavil
Rhodes and the late Francis Schnadhorst
(who from 1S85 to 1S92 was the chief or
ganizer and adviser of the Liberal party)
sustaining the sensational allegations
made some months ago that Rhodes in
1891 gave Â£5000 to the Liberal party on
condition that Gladstone would not bring
about the evacuation of Egypt by the
British troops. Both Sir "William Vernon
Harcourt and Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman (the Liberal leaders) have pub
licly declared this 10 be false.
In a letter covering this correspondence
Rhodes sums up as follows:
I met Mr. Schnadhorst in London and he
asked whether I was willing to subscribe to
thQ party funds. I said I was prepared to do
so providing the policy was not to scuttle out
of Kgypt and that in the event of a home rula
bill being: brought forward provision should
be made for the retention of the Irish, member*
at Westminster. I understood from Mr. Schnad
horst that he would consult Mr. Gladstone,
which quite satisfied me as I looked upon Mr.
Gladstone as the Liberal party. Mr. Schnad
horst accepted the contribution upon the con
ditions defined in the letter appended. â¢
In this letter Rhodes demanded that his
contribution be kept secret and that the
check be returned if the Irish were not
represented at Westminster. But he added
a postscript saying:
Light Shed on Controversy
About Egypt's Evacu
ation.

THE Manufacturers' and Produc

taken a step which Is calculated
to advance materially the inter

liberation the officers and directors of the
association have decided to appeal to the
Xatlve Sons'and Daughters of the Golden
West to appoint committees to consider
all matters relating to the industrial wel
fare of California and to take in hand
communications from the Manufacturers
and Producers' Association and report to
the parlors, when necessary, such special
action as may be recommended. In a let
ter which was sent out yesterday the pur
pose of this movement is explained by
Charles E. Bancroft, secretary and man
ager of the association.
"The object of these suggestions," 30
reads the communication to the Native
Sons and Daughters, "is to place your
parlor and this association in close and
friendly relations in order that, with a
common sentiment and purpose existing,
questions affecting the industries of the
State may be considered and acted upon
intelligently and co-operatively as such
questions arise."
Every narlor of the Native' Sons and
Daughters is, in pursuance of this public
spirited idea, requested to signify readi
ness to co-operate with the association *n

George "W. Rice, a non-union machinist
employed by the Golden State Foundry,
was fatally shot at the corner of Twen
tieth and Howard streets last evening by
one of three men who followed him from
his place of work. William Buckley, who
is said to have been one of the trio, was
arrested and taken to the Seventeenth
street police station.
The assault on Rice was one of the bold
est that has come to the notice of the po
lice for some time. Rice was followed by
his assailants frdm First street. They
boarded the car with him and when he
alighted at the crossing of Twentieth
6treet they wielded both pistol and club.
A club loaded with lead was first used;
then three shots were -fired into the un
fortunate machinist's body as he fell to
the ground.
Some weeks ago Rice was attacked on
Fourth street, near Market. A crowd
gathered about him and, being unable to
defend himself with his fists, he drew a
revolver and fired several shots. One of
the bullets struck a striker on the arm.
The affair aroused the bitterness of the
union men and the assault last night is
supposed to have been the outgrowth
of it. \u25a0 '
Rice left the foundry shortly after 5
o'clock and boarded a Howard-street car
at the crossing of First street. He no
tioed that three men got aboard at the
Mine time, but paid no particular atten
tion to them. Before the car reached
Twentieth street it was crowded with peo
ple. No attempt was made to molest Hice
on the car.
First Beaten and Then Shot.
Scarcely had Rice stepped to the pave
ment when Twentieth street was reached
than he was dealt a heavy blow from be
hind. He did not drop immediately, but
turned to defend himself. One of the men
then pointed a revolver at him and fired
four shots in rapid succession. Three oi
the bullets took effect. One bullet en
tered Rice's breast, another passed
through bis body In the region of the
jrroln and & third lodged in the left shoul
der.
After the murderous assault the men
ran down Twentieth street, one of them
turning Into Shotwell street. Officers C.
W. Brown and Frank Lysett were Jus:
leaving the Seventeenth-street station
and heard the shots. They ran along
Eighteenth street and met a party in pur
suit of the man who had turned Shotwell

followed the three men along Twentieth

street. Then he continued the chase aftei
the man who entered the latter thorough
fare. Levy pointed out Buckley as being
the man he had followed and Identified
him positively. The other two men have
not yet been located by the police. Thej

street. Detectives Graham. Fitzgerald
and Crockett \u25a0were detailed on the case bj

Wounded 2Â£an Cannot Live.
Rice was taken to the City and County
Hospital, where the bullets were extract
ed. The surgeons in charge state that he
cannot live. For two hours the injured
man remained conscious, and during that
time Buckley was brought to his bedside
for purposes of Identification. Rice said
he thought Buckley was one of the three
men who attacked him, but could not pos
itively Identify him. He was certain,
however, that he was not the person who
flred the 6hots.
Rice Is 40 years of age. He resides with
his mother and sisters at 3335 Twentieth
street.
Buckley does not deny being present at
the scene of the shooting. He told the
police several contradictory stories, how
ever, and they feel confident that he Is onÂ°

Little Confusion in Sonoma.

BULLA IS NOT STTBPRISED.
Says Governor and Present Code
Commission Blundered.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11.â The decision
of the Supreme Court annulling the re
vised. Code of Civil Procedure has caused
consternation among members of the lo
cal bar. ' General Johnstone Jones, As
sistant District Attorney, said to-day:
I am of the opinion that the sweeping de
cision of the State Supreme Court is applicable
to the Penal Code and will have the effect of
rendering null and void the several amendments
to the Penal Code made by the Code Commis
sion. ' , '
Judge J. W. McKinley does not believe
that convictions will be affected. George
J Denis of the Code Commission said
that the decision had surprised and aston
ished him. Senator Robert N. Bulla, who
preceded Mr. Denis on the commission,
said:
' I am not at all surprised at the decision. In
deed, I should have been astonished had the
Supreme Court arrived at any other conclusion.
The first act of the so-called commission of
1897 was to determine in what form the legis
lation necessary for the revision of the codes
should be introduced. "We then satisfied our
selves that the only safe course to pursue was
to introduce each code as a separate bill, re
printing the same In full and showing in the
body thereof every amendment suggested by
the commission. In pursuance . of this plan,
we revised three of the four . codes during our
incumbency, which extended over a period of
a little more than two years, and at the ses
sion of the Legislature in 1899 we introduced
the Civil Code as amended by us. The bill as
Introduced was not paesed upon by the. Legis
lature, but after the adjournment of that ses
sion the commission continued Its labors along
the same lines* until Its retirement and the
appointment of its successors by Governor
Gage during the summer of 1S99. As before
stated, at the time we vacated the office we
had completed three of the four . codes.
When our successors were appointed, for rea
sons which doubtless were satisfactory to them
the work of their predecessors was discarded
and a new plan of procedure adoptedâ that of
suggesting amendments to separate eectlons of
the various codes and introducing a fragmen
tary bill, not re-enacting the entire codes.
The object of the commission doubtless was to
save the expense to the State of reprinting
these sections of the codes which were not to
be changed In the revision, but the reeult. as
determined by the decision of the Supreme
Court, has proved most disastrous and far more
expensive than if the commission of 1899 had
pursued the same plan adopted by that of
1897; and the uncertainty, inconvenience- and
hardship which will follow the decision of the
Supreme Court declaring their labors unconsti
tutional would have been avoided.
Of course, good lawyers honestly differ in
such matters, but the mistake of Judgment on
the part of the present commissioners in-adopt
ing their plan of amendments, and of the.Gov
ernor in ratifying their unconstitutional meth
ods, is certainly most unfortunate for litigants
and the people generally. What can be done
to remedy the evil? Nothing but await the
meeting of the next session of' the Legislature
and then Introduce each code as a separate bill,
showing on its face every amendment suggested
by the commission. Of. course this will be ex
pensive and probably will cost the State in the
neighborhood of another $100,000, but I see no
other way out of the predicament if code re
vision is to become an accomplished fact.
The lawyers of .' San Francisco and
doubtless their official brethren through
out the State are rejoicing over the de
cision of the Supreme Court which nulli
fied the codes. The ponderous volumes
purchased on July 1 are laid away, but
the $15 which they cost is not mourned
for, so great is the general delight in the
fact that their tangles will no longer have
to be unraveled. The legal lights con
gratulate each other when they meet and
smile lightly when the Code Commission
is mentioned. . . '
Attorney Charles Heggerty says: "That
set of codes was the most senseless and
worthless conglomeration of everything
that was ever adopted for the law of any
State. -We know what we are doing now
that the whole business is declared inop
erative. With the revised codes no one
could tell what might happen in any
case."
Attorney, Heggerty's opinion Is shared
by all the fraternity with the exception
of a few perhaps who for personal reasons
were interested in having the new laws
declared valid: The decision was not unex
pected and attorneys with foresight have,
it is said, carried on their cases since July
1 under both the old and new methods of
procedure. \u25a0,
The chief objection to the Code of Civil
Procedure was that the contestants in
any case might make affidavit that the
Judges to whom, their respective causes
were assigned were biased and a trans
fer must then be made.- In that manner
the parties might select their own Judges,
a state of affairs very undesirable..
Several other cases analagous with that
of Lewis vs. Dunne, in the decision of
which the codes were declared invalid,
were handed down by the Supreme- Court
yesterday. The most important of them
was that of "Watt vs. Cook. Rolla V.
Watt, representing the Fire Commission
ers, alleged bias on the partof Judge Car
roll Cook in the case of Maxwell against
the board. Under the code a transfer
would have been made Imperative. Judge
Cook will not try the suit.
E. R. Leventon, one of the Lookout
lynching suspects, had alleged that Judge
Harrington of Modoc County was preju
diced. His petition falls, of course, with
the others.

Rousseau, pleaded guilty : in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday to the charge of ar
son. In accepting the plea -the Judge con
sidered the fact that Biasioli Is only 19
years of age with ; no criminal . instincts
and that his previous good character in
dicated that he had. a useful future -be
fore him. The Judge postponed sentence
till January, and if the defendant behaves
himself' sentence will -be; continued from
time to time till the Judge's term expires.
Biasioll was placed- under â¢ a bond â¢ of
$1000. J. D. McGilvray, i a contractor of
Palo Alto, and D. McPhee, contractor of
this city, became his sureties. Biasioli is
a skilled workman and can earn $4 per
day. The parents of Miss ' Rousseau are
willing that she and \u25a0\u25a0 Biasioli should

tunity to render to the State the most pat
riotic and material service, alike creditable to
themselves in- the highest degree and beneficial
to the State in the furtherance of these ideas.
It would seem peculiarly appropriate and fit
ting that the energy and the influence of these
orders should be so' exerted, unselfishly and
without discrimination of Individuals or classes
as against others concerned In those industries.

you will give this matter your undivided-at

We're better fixed in
Women's Kid Gloves for $1.00
Than we ever were.
âand that's saying a good deal. Our previous glove achievements have
been as incentives to make us improve. Every season we keep crowding
more into our $1.00 glove. We keep buying more, so it's worth the makers'
while to keep giving us more. ,-
Of first and prime importance are
Our H. B. Kid Gloves $1.00.
They wear longer, look better and are more comfortable than the aver-
age $1.00 glove. The fact that we sell more of them to women who have
been used to wearing $1.25 and $1.50 gloves is pretty good evidence of their
superiority. Women who wear them once keep on wearing them; they do
not disappoint. If they do go wrong we stand ready to replace them or
give your money back.
They're made from selected Italian lambskins, tanned in the newest
shades of mode, brown, red. blue, green, gray, violet, pearl, white and black.
