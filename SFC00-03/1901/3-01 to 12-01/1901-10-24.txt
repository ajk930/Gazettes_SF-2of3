The robber kept at my elbows,

the messenger, the robber v forced me to

holes blown into the door. As I did so

to shoot, as I was between him and the
robber and the shot would hit me. I had
no sooner entered the car than I was

They next attempted to enter the car
by compelling the engineer, who was in
the hands of the robbers, to crawl in
through the door, the robbers hoping
to gain admittance by using him as a

good fire directly over the engineer's

EXPRESS MESSENGEK'S DARING
Express Messenger C. F. Charles was
in the car and had made up his mind
to stay there. The robbers ordered the
messenger out, but he determinedly re
fused to obey, and held a position where
he could easily bring down any. person
who should attempt to enter through
the opening in the side made by the
dynamite.

Two men boarded the train at Cot

Adjutant General Ccrbin has received
the following mall report from General
Chaffee, giving a list of the casualties m
the Philippines reported to him since his
U.st communication, dated September 3.
"When I left Manila there were 45,000
troops in the archipelago, and this force
is amply sufficient. Luckban has innum
erable men, but certainly less than 500
rifles. The insurgents have .very little
ammunition, end this has been the great
element of their miltary weakness. They
had a comparatively good supply of am
munition at tha beginning of the insur
rection, but they have not been able to
replenish It."
Secretary Root will order several regi
ments to the Philippines to take the
places of those who will be brought homo
cn account of the expiration of the terms
of enlistment of many of the men. He
sees no necessity, however, for giving
General Chaffee a larger force than now
comprises that officer's command'.
Rear Admir.il Rodgers has cabled the
Navy Department his arrival on his flag
ship, the New York, at Catbologan, Sa
mar, with marines to co-operate with the
army in suppressing the insurrection.

the affair at Balangiga is deplorable in
the extreme. It is isolated in character
and has no bearing on the main situation,
which will go on to final solution as It
"hus in Luzon. Pa nay and other islands."
General MacArthur was asked if the
Eiiccesses of the insurgents in Samar
â¢would have any effect upon the Filipinos
elsewhere in the archipelago.
"Only In a trifling way." he responded.
"3f course, success encourages the party
\u25a0which attains it, but in this instance the
success Is so slight that It has very little
c:Tect, not sufficient in any event to bring
ebout a general recurrence of the insur
rectlons. The Amercian force in Samar
has been considerably increased lately,
and that insures a quicker result. If
necessary, reinforcements can be sent
from Luzon -without affecting the situa
tion in the latter island.

Excluded From Resources.
General Miles said to-day that while the
situation was serious, in his opinion It
could be met with the forces now at Gen
ersl Chailee's disposal-
G-ener&l MacArthur, who Is especially
familiar with the situation throughout
the archipelago, made this statement to
The Call correspondent this afternoon:
"I have no information concerning the
situation in Samar as it exists to-day be
j-ond what I have gleaned from the news
papers. From that I do not think serious
conditions prevail. In Samar it is simply
the expiring efforts of the insurrection.
During active operations xn XJuzon it was
not possible to send a large force into
Eamar, and therefore the island was not
ful'!y occupied until very recently. The
plan of campaign pursued so successfully
in Luzon is now to be carried out in Sa
xaar. Every town and every barrio that
can possibly be used as a base of supplies
fcy the insurgents will be occupied by
American troops.

The preliminary steps In the acquisition
of a municipal water system were taken
last week when Mayor Phelan, In behalf
of the city of San Francisco, filed upon
the water rights and storage reservoirs at
the source of the Tuolumne River. This
Information was contained In the volum
inous report on the investigation of water
supplies made by City Engineer Grunsky
and his assistants and submitted to tha
Mayor on Tuesday. / ,
The report also states that the filings
havebene placed of record In the United
States Land Office. Accompanying the re
port is a recommendation by the City En
gineer that the Tuolumne River supply be
acquired by the city. Under the charter
the Spring Valley Water Company will be
asked next Monday by the Board of Su
pervisors to state a price at which it will
sell to the city. The two propositions will
then be submitted to the people at a spe
cial election to determine a choice. The
recommendation reads:
On the basis of thÂ« facts herein set forth,
and the comparisons made between near-by
sources of supply and the rivers of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, it has seemed desirable to
recommend that thÂ« tmraediate further exam
inations be confined to a single Sierra Nevada
stream and to the- maturing of a single in
dependent project.
The Tuolumne River project presents tha
most attractive features. It has therefore been
recommended that a complete general plan of
works for the utilization of water from this
river be made with a cost estimate based on
less reconnolssance work and more definite se
lections of location canals, pipe lines and
structures than have been available in making;
the financial forecast herelnabove presented.
Recommends Tuolumne Supply.
In a communication accompanying the
report the Board of Public "Works says:
The investigation of the water supply for this
city has embraced every available source. From
this Investigation there has been selected one
which does not interfere with vested rights In
any way. and which Is capable of developing
an independent water supply of 150,000,000 gal
lons of water per day, or. of being used In
conjunction with existing supplies to reinforce
.the same. This supply is gathered upon aa
area well above the snow line, uninhabited
at present, and by nature unfitted for human
habitation. It is. therefore, not only initially
I pure, but will remain pure for all time.
It was necessary to move in its acquisition
with extreme caution, as interested parties arÂ»
willing to seize upon any public utility and
cause the city to pay enormously therefor. To
forestall thl3 action, the Mayor of this city
has filed upon the water rights and storage res
ervoirs for and in behalf of this city, in thÂ»
basin of the Tuolumne River, and these filings
have been placed of record in the proper United
States Land Office. In connection with this
supply, an abundance of electric power can be
developed and transmitted to the city for what
ever purpose the city may require power.
The necessary preliminary steps have been
taken in the acquisition of these rights ex
clusively for the city. If they are utilized
In the spirit with which they have been thus
acquired, this city will stand jpre-eminent
among all cities in the world aa having tha
purest and most abundant water supply.

KESWICK, Oct. 23.â A lone robber raid
ed John Miller's saloon at 1 o'clock this
morning and got only $11 for his trouble,
when, it was possible for him to have
stolen half aa many hundreds. It was the
coolness and thoughtfulness of the bar
keeper, Eugene Hugel, that frustrated
the robber. Only three patrons were ln
the saloon when the highwayman, with
his face masked by a handkerchief, ap
peared at the front door and told them
to hold up their hands. A cocked revolver
emphasized the command and brought
prompt compliance. Barkeper Hugel
was in the center of the room." He was
told to step back and keep his hands off.

contained but $11 in silver. He then be

This Is not the first occasion on which
C. F. Charles, the courageous express
messenger, has proved that he Is wortny
of the trust which the Wells-Fargo Com
pany has reposed in him. Nine years ago
near Ceres, in Stanislaus County, Charles
bravely fought a gang of train robbers
who were attempting to rob the baggage
car of which he was in charge. "With \V ai
lace Reed, another Wells-Fargo messen
ger, he withstood the attack of the rob
bers, who were believed to have been the
Evans and Sontag gang, as those des
perate outlaws were at that time terror
izing that portion of the State. For his
valiant defense of the property intrustec
to his care Wells-Fargo Company pre
sented him with a handsome gold watch.
When the Grant Wheeler band pf out
laws was Infesting Arizona and PlunafJ;
ing the citizens of that State, Charles
was. sent by the Wells-Fargo Company
as a shotgun messenger to protect me
company's property. . o â ,,.
The express messenger who has so sis
nally distinguished himself for his hero
ism is a young man, not more than w
years of age. He is not acquainted witn
the meaning of the word "fear, and he
has frequently told his friends, in rnodest
depreciation of his own bravery, that It
does not cost him any effort to fight train
robbers. He is genial, yet modest and re
tiring in his disposition. - .
Immediately after the receipt here of
the news of the robbery General Manager
Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pacific Com
pany telegraphed instructions to the north,
to run down the robbers at any cost.
Mr. Kruttschnitt also made a formal
announcement that a reward of $250 would
be paid for the arrest of each of the rob
bers. The company is determined to use
every possible means to bring the men to
justice, and, with that end in view, it has
engaged all the detective agencies ln the
north, including those of the Pinkertons,
to join in the man-hunt. Detectives have
already joined with the posses sent to the

the President was accompanied on the

yet been ln a struggle for righteousness
and decency that there were not men of

ident Hadley announced that all Yale men
were now doubly honored by greeting tho
man and the President as a son of Tale.
Specially addressing President Roosevelt.
President Hadley spoke as follows:
"Theodore Roosevelt, while you were
yet a private citizen we offered you most
worthily the degree of LL. D.. Since in
his providence it has pleased God to give
Theodore Roosevelt another title, we give
him on that account a double portion of
welcome. He is a Harvard man by nur
ture, but we are proud to think that ln his
democratic spirit, his broad national sym
pathies and above all his clearness and
purity and truth, he will be glad to be an
adopted son of Yale." . , â¢
President Roosevelt advanced, bowed
profoundly and tried to speak. Again the
audience cheered and it was fully a min
ute before he was allowed to proceed. He
.said:
or. David Joslah Brewer, LL. D., Justice
of the United States Supreme Court, de
livered the commemorative address. Jus
tice Brewer was given a tremendous ova
tion. Early in his address Justice Brewer
elicited hearty applause when he referred
to Yale aa a place "where men are taught
to recognize a Washington, whether. his
name is George or Booker."
The presentation of candidates for hon
orary degrees followed the commemora
tive address and the function occupied
about one hour. President Hadley was
extraordinarily felicitous in the delicate
compliments he conveyed to the distin
guished candidates. Secretary John Hay,
Joseph H. Choate, Chief Justice Fuller,
Archbishop Ireland, Mark Twain,. Seth
Low and Rear Admiral Sampson received
tremendous ovations. The foreigners who
were honored with degrees were received
with great enthusiasm. ;;. '
When the long list had been finished
President Hadley advanced a step or two
and with great Impresslveness said:
. "There yet remains one name."

The most unique and original feature of
the reception was the fact. that there was
no handshaking. The suggestion to elim
inate this old-time custom originated with
President and Mrs. Hadley and was read
ily adopted by the President, after con
sultation with Secretary Cortelyou.
Light refreshments .were served at the
side hall opposite the official party.
â¢ It is estimated that*500 persons attended
the reception. At Its conclusion the Presi

"The first intimation I had of anything
wrong," said C. F. Charles, the expre33
messenger, "was when the train began
to slow up near "Walker station. It was
a quarter to 3, as near as I remember.
Shortly after the train .came to a stand
still I was ordered to open the door. I
refused to move. I was threatened with
all sorts of things. 'Open up this car or
we will blow you to ,' commanded one
ol the robbers. I made no response and
was given a salute with dynamite. The
first charge blew open one of the doors
and knocked me down.., My overalls were
blown into shreds and my legs scratched
somewhat, but otherwise I was unhurt.
Further commands to open, and threats
followed, but without avail. I made no
i eply, knowing that the object of the
robbers was to locate me in the car and
then try : to put me . out of the way,
either with dynamite or bullets. â¢â¢ \u25a0\u25a0 I
changed my station to the other end of
the car.
"A second shot blew open the door at
tho other end of the car. The third shot
failed to go off, as I had removed .toy
shoes and quietly walked over to the
dynamite and detached the fuse. Two
more shots exploded, each of- them blow-
Ing a hole into the floor of the car. All
told, four sticks of dynamite went oft ln
the car, two failed to explode, and one I
prevented exploding by removing -. the
luse. .
"All efforts to compel me to open up or
leave the car falling, the engineer was
sent in through the opening blown in the
side. I ordered him to get out and fired
a shot over his head- with a shotgun.
The entire ceremony lasted about forty
minutes. The ' engineer retired after I

among the crowd and a aquad of police

The postal Inspector has a description
of two men who may be the ones. "im
plicated in the hold-up. It is known that
iast night two men beat their way on the
southbound overland, No. 15, by blind
baggage and left the train at Cottage
Grove.
"The mall clerk was covered by the
iobber while I was compelled to open lh"e
mail sacks. After the mail was dumped
out the robber sorted It and had the mes
senger hold the eack while he took what
he wanted. But one sack of registered
mail was taken. The robber also helped
himself to the messenger's lunch. This
ended the work of the robber.
"I was taken back with him to the en
gine and commanded to take him to a
point about a mile from Eugene. He told
me to stop as soon as the lights of the
city could be seen, when he jumped off
and disappeared ln the darkness in the
direction of the river. When leaving he
told me to go in any direction I desired
except toward Eugene."
Postal Inspector Ball, who was on the
train on his way home from San Fran
cisco, obtained a list of the pouches
which were rifled by the two men. Four
through registered pouches were taken
by the robbers. After being silt open
and the contents taken they were thrown
down. These pouches were all from San
Francisco and were being sent to Spo
kane, Seattle, Tacoma and Victoria, B. C.
One through pouch, which was partially
hidden behind a box, was overlooked.
Nearly everything in the four pouches
which were rifled was taken away by the
men, only a few articles being left" be
hind. \u25a0.:â¢ -x'r-k- 7 : \u25a0\u25a0 ' â¢ \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢\u25a0
the attack on the express car and turned
his attention to the baggage car. I was
compelled to enter the baggage car and
command the baggage man to give up.
Assuring the robber that there was noth
ing of value in this car, it was also aban
doned and the mail car was taken ln
hand.
Lake' Tahoe is to be considered capable of
yielding about 60,000,000 gallons of water per
day. without apparent damage to users of water
from Truckee River. In making any considerable
diversion in excess of this amount it must be
anticipated that some Interference with vested
rights will be claimed and that the city would
be liable for damage actually resulting there
from. -.- \
From North Yuba River at Alabama Bar,
in combination with the large storage facilities
at the Oregon House reservoir site, without
recourse to any portion of - the river's low
water flow, upward of 60,000,000 gallons of
water per day can be obtained. Water from
the North Yuba. from a watershed with a
population of about 3000 should be considered
in too great danger of pollution to be used
without filtration. )
Supervisors to sell water properties or to
construct water works fOr the city as fol
lows:
Lake Tahoe and San Francisco Water Works,
Marysville and Nevada Water Company, Jay
B. Russell (American River). M. C. Taylor
(Tuba River) William Stuart & Co. (Middle
fork of American River). Kel River and Rus
sian River Water Works, D. E. Gish & Co.
(artesian), Jersey City AVater Supply Company,
Spring Valley Water Works (offer to arbitrate).
E. G. Wheeler and associates (Coyote Valley).
T. J. Patterson (Stanislaus River), Dumbarton
Land and Improvement Company. Grant Gap
Water Company (north fork of American
River).
The estimates of cost for four of the
supplies are given as follows:
North fork of Tuba River project, to effect
delivery to city. $38,608,300; add for distributing
system $7,000,COO; total, $45,608,300.
1 Lake Tahoe project. 60,0)0,000 gallons per day
to be delivered and including distributing sys
tem. $46,400,900. .
Tuolumne River project, $33,206,200.
Stanislaus River project, $40,836,200.
The appraisement of the Spring Valley
system, excluding properties not at pres
ent in actual use, is fixed at $23,204,265.
What the Investigation Cost.
' The appropriation of $30,000 for the water
supply investigation was expended' as fol
lows, a balance of $46 32 being left:
Supervisors' trip to Lake Tahoe and Tuba
River, $792 85; publication "The law and the
facts," $118; salaries and wages, $17,013 93;
materials and supplies. $2343 IS; reconnoissance
and incidentals, $5936 78; expert services, $3CO0;
bacteriological examinations, $728 34; total,
$29,933 68.
The following are some of the important
conclusions noted in the report:
It Is desirable that the combined sources of
water supply for this city should be capable
of yielding ultimately at least 120,000,000 gal
lons per day, and that any source of supply
now to be utilized or an extension of the es
tablished system should place at least 60,000,000
gallons of water per- day at the disposal of
the city, and that the capacltyof water worka
should be such as to deliver this amount of
water to the city at the outset. Any new
source to be combined with the established sys
tem should be capable of yielding at least
30,000.000 gallons per day and a possible expan
sion to 90,000,000 gallons is desirable. The
population forecast indicates 1.000,000 inhabit
ants in about the year 19S0. with no probability
that this number, under favorable conditions of
growth, could be reached before 1363. \u25a0
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â Admiral
Schley is expected to take the witness
stand ln the naval court of inquirj\ which
is investigating his conduct in the Span
ish War, some time during the day or
to-morrow. This announcement is justi
fied by the progress made to-day in tin
examination of witnesses called to tes
tify in the admiral"s behalf.
Eight witnesses were heard to-day, an<l
there are only three more names on the
list preceding the name of the admiral
himself. Of these tnrte only *Captain
Clark of the Oregon is expected to testify
at any length. It Is not probable that the
idmiral will be called before the after
noon session, lie will be the last of th-*
witnesses to be neard in support of h'i
side of the controversy. It Is now con
sidered probable that he will be on the
stand for two or three days.
It is not yet possible to say whether
any witnesses will be called in rebuttal
ay the court, but it seems probable that a
.'ew persons may be summoned for this
purpose. The testimony to-day led Judge
Advocate Leraly and Hanna to decide
upon the calling of at least one rebutting
witness If he can be found. This is Sylves
ter Bcoyel, whose testimony is desired In
connection with the incident of the meet
ing of the press boat Somers M. Smith
by the scout boat tit. Paul while the lat
ter was off Santiago in May, 1S9S.
The first of to-day's new witnesses,
James H. Hare, photographer on the
press boat, stated that Captain Sigsbee
of the St. Paui had told the correspond
ents on board the Smith on May- Â£ti an.i
27 that Cervera's fleet was not inside thÂ»
harbor at Santiago. Scovel was among
the correspondents on the Smith, and if
he can be found he will be asked to come
to "Washington and give his testimony on
this incident. It is also probable that an
effort will be made to rebut other por
tions of the testimony given in Admiral
Schley's behalf, including Lieutenant
tears' denials of a conversation concern
ing Admiral Schley, which the lieutenant
is alleged to have taken part in on board
the Massachusetts on May 3L
Other witnesses in addition to Hare who
testified to-day were Chief Boatswain
Anlliam L. Hill, Gunner P. T. Applegate
and Major Paul St. C. Murphy of the
marines, all of whom were aboard the
Brooklyn during the Cuban campaign-
Lieutenant Commander Harlow, who as
executive officer of the Vixen made notes
of the battle of- July 3, and three officer
of the Oregon. Lieutenant A. A. Acker
man, Lieutenant E. W. Eberle and Lieu
tenant R. G. Johnstone. Lieutenant Ack
ennan had charge of the after 13-inch tur
ret and Lieutenant Eberle of the forward
13-inch turret en the Oregon on July 3
and Lieutenant Johns-tone was signal ofli
eer on the Oregon at that time.
Johnstone testified that he did not re

Voorheis, Caminetti named Fred Zeitler,
Attorney General Tirey Ford named L.
E. Aubury and J. H. Tibbitts of Shasta

the matter of most serious present concern to

Is peculiarly one In which the whole mining
Industry of the State is interested, together

sources of the public domain to the mining
industry that their development might be .en

ever since General Buller refused to cor

subjected to the bitter hostility ot Lad/
Roberts, who used every eftort to force
her husband to demand his recall. Within
the last few days her antipathy has fotmtl
fresh vent owing' to this Westminster
speech. It is said she compelled 'Bobs* to
go to the War Office and demand oZ
Bro'drick that he should issue an order
for General Butler's resignation.

Buller replied with a flat refusal to
resign. Then Lord Roberts and Mr. Brod
rick put their heads together and waited
for the King's return to London to lay
before his Majesty the alternative of
Buller's dismissal or their resignation.
-"It was by n:> means a pleasant inter
view. At first the King refused point
blank to countenance any such drastic
proceedings. He defended Buller right
and left and declared that such a provo
cation as anonymous attacks were no
warrant for such an explosion on the part
of a bluff old soldier, but Lord Roberta
and Mr. Brodrick were equally stubborn.
"Lord Roberts threatened to resign in

of the action ol the California miners.
Congressman Coombs spoke of the Yuba

Yuba works all the support they could in

spoke concerning the exclusion of Chinese
from the United States., He said that r.
was whispered 'about in the East that
the farmers and miners of California
wanted more Chinese laborers to develop
their lands and mines and that rallroa-1
builders also wanted the Chinese. He dui
not think that representatives of these in
terests in California would sit silent un
der these imputations. He was largely
acquainted with the farmers and thought
that he knew their wishes concerning- the
exclusion of the Chinese: -
If there was not enough labor in Cali

OHIOANS HEAR
FROM KILBOURNE
The text of the resolutions adopted by
the convention that dealt with topics of
the greatest general interest is as follows:
lows:
Resolved. That in the Judgment of this as
sociation, the mining industry of this country
with its output of raw material amounting in
1900 to the sum of $1,070,108,883 in value, its
tremendous significance to the industrial pros
perity of the nation, and its still more splen
did promise for the future, warrants and de T
mands the governmental protection and assist
ance that can be adequately extended only
through a cabinet department of the executive
branch of the Government. We therefore hear
tily indorse the now national demand for \u25a0 a
Cabinet Department of Mines and Mining.
Resolved, That the committee on legislation
be requested to prepare a bill embodying the
Important Resolutions.
Whereas, We cannot but look forward with
dismay and alarm to .that untoward event
which shall precipitate upon our shores the
alien hordes of Asia without let or hindrance;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That we hereby request our dele
gation in Congress to endeavor to procure
the enactment of another Chinese exclusion act.
and that wo further hereby request our said
delegation in the prosecution of their efforts
in this behalf to exercise the greatest diligence
and vigilance.
Whereas, The Chinese * civilization In our
midst has proven to be wholly alien to ours
and to our Institutions, and the presence of
the Chinese among us has been shown to be a
blight and a curse upon our people; and
Whereas, The Chinese race has been proven
to be wholly unasslmilable with the Caucasian;
and
The enactment of a new Chinese restric
tion law \u25a0was advocated. The administra
tion of the State Mining Bureau under
Lewis B. Aubury was approved and the
Legislature was asked to make a liberal
appropriation for the support of the
bureau. Land Commissioner Binger Her
mann was commended anew for suspend
ing agricultural entry upon California
lands supposed to be petroleum-bearing.
Thanks were voted to the merchants,
manufacturers and business men of San
Francisco for financial support given to
the association and also to the press of
San Francisco and of the mining counties
of the State for aid to the association and
to the mining industry of California.
The resolutions that were submitted by
the committee on resolutions, of which "W.
C. Ralston was the chairman, were really
an epitome of the history of the important
doings of the convention during the week.
The reports of all committees, with the
recommendations made therein, were sent
to the committee on resolutions after they
had been read to the convention and the
last named committee embodied the sug
gestions that met with the favor of the
convention in their final report.
The text of the resolution reported by
the committee and finally adopted by the
convention concerning the Chinese exclu
sion act is as follows:
\u25a0Whereas, The Chinese exclusion act, so call
ed, is about to expire; and
Whereas, Upon Its expiration, unless Congress
shall enact another law of similar-purview, this
country, and particularly the Pacific States and
Territories, will at once be flooded with Chi
nese; and
the Immediate purposes of the as
sociation vrore Bet forth in no uncertain
terms and by electing officers of the next
year. Tho officers elected are: President,
E. C. Voorheis of Amador County: first
vice president, Frederick Zeitler of Ne
vada County; second vice president, Lewis
E. Aubury of Los Angeles; third vice
president, M. E. Dittmar of Shasta Coun
ty; secretary, E. H. Benjamin of San
Francisco; treasurer, S. J. Hendy of San
Francisco. They constituted the old
board of officers and were re-elected, with
the addition of M. E. Dittmar, .who occu
pies the efflce of third vice president,
which was created by amendment of the
by-laws cf the association, so that the
northern counties, about to form a Miners'
Association of Northern California, might
receive proper recognition in the State
body.
The more important aims of the asso
ciation that were mentioned in the reso
lutions that were adopted are easily sum
marised. The demand for a national. De
partment of Mines and Mining was re
newed. A national law was asked for to
provide for the location of 160 acres of
petroleum-bearing land as a placer claim
and to give the locator an opportunity to
make technical discovery of mineral as a
precedent for location. A national law
was also asked for to throw the burden
of proof in a contest in the United States
Land Office, between a scripper and
miner, upon the scripper. The restrain
ing works for the Yuba River were "ap
proved and additional restraining works
upon the tributaries of the f Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers were advocated to
enable miners to provide for the resump
tion of hydraulic mining in all parts of
the State adapted thereto.
Once more the passage of the mineral
lands bill was urged and it was voted to
send a representative of the mining inter
ests of California to Washington in that
connection if the executive committee
should approve. The executive committee
was instructed to defend a case properly
brought to test the Caminetti law. Bring
ing persons before the Federal Grand
Jury, who falsely make non-mineral af
fidavits for the purpose of fraudulently
procuring title to mineral lands, was de
clared a purpose of the association. A na
tional forest patrol, reserving from sale
all public forests and the enaptment of
State penal laws to protect forests from
tires were strongly advocated. The
amendment of the Federal statutes to pre
vent the prolonged holding of mining
claims without the performance of annual
assessment work w4s also favored.

The bridesmaids, Miss Gertrude Parker',
over all things, within the First Presby
terian Church all was light and gay.
There were bright flowers and gorgeous
palms, beautiful -women, a most generous
sprinklinjg of handsome men and a mag
nificent display of beautiful gowns and
stunning hats. The floral decorations of
the church, while simple, were in most
exquisite taste. Magnificent palms made
a most effective â¢ background for the
chancel, while tall, white chrysanthe
mums sprang gracefully from the midst
of a rich tangle of green. Two hearts
(a&hioried of pink roses peeped forth from
the center of all this wealth of flora.
. The wedding guests began to arrive
early, and it was hardly more than half
after 1 when every seat of the church was
occupied.
There was a hush In the crowded edi
fice when, stepping to the sweet strains
of the Lohengrin bridal march the brides
maids came from the vestry and. march
ing down the center aisle went to meet the
bride. The procession was then re-formed,
the ushers leading the way, followed. by
the bridesmaids, who in turn were fol
lowed by the' maid of honor. The bride,
leaning on the arm of her father, closed
the bridal procession. As the bride ap
proached the altar the groom, Harrison
Magowen Parker, came to meet her. Un
like the majority of grooms he was not
sedate and serious. He \u25a0 approached the
lady of his choice quickly and eagerly,
while his face was lighted with a happy
smile. â¢
Dr. J. E. Stubbs, president of the' Ne
vada University and uncle of the bride,
performed the ceremony, assisted by Dr.
Mackenzie, the pastor of the church. After
the ceremony a reception was held' at the
heme of the bride's parents, , Mr. and
Mrs. J. C. Stubbs. on Pacific avenue. The
magnificent residence :â¢ was aglow with
rich blossoms and while there. were flow
ers everywhere there was no set form of
decorations. . .
The bride wore an exquisite gown of
white tulle, embroidered at the hem in
white forget-me-nots. , Tiny ruffles edged
with white . silk finished off the long
trained skirt. The corsage was trimmed
with an exquisite berthe of duchesse lace.

Richard T. Gardner, Florence, B.C.,
suffered foryears with Boils. Two bot-
tles of S. S. S. put his blood in good con-
ditioa and the Soils disappeared.
The liability to disease is greatly-
lessened when the blood is in good con-
dition, and the circulation healthy and
vigorous. For then all refuse ma&er
is promptly carried out of the system ;
otherwise it would rapidly accumulate
âfermentation would take place, the
blood become polluted and the consti-
tution so weakened that a simple
malady might result seriously.
A healthy, active circulation means
good digestion and strong, healthy
nerves.
As a blood purifier and tonic S. S. S.
has no equal. It is the safest and best
remedy for old -people and children
because it contains no minerals, but is
made exclusively of roots and herbs.
No other remedy so thoroughly and
effectually cleanses the blood of im-
S^^ i^^"purities. At the
KT^I Qni same time it builds

General Ludington is of the opinion that
henÂ«after none of the big transports will
stop at Honolulu on the way to Manila.
The srnaHer vessels will stop at Hawaii,
but the larger ones will go via Guam. The
general is accompanied by his wife and
will leave for Washington in a day or so.
In China and Japan, where I met many men
who had observed the soldiers of the United
Statss. I found that there were only good words
for them, as to their appearance, equipment
and action. In fact, they made an excellent
impression upon every one who observed them.

\â¢ , P i? SfSJ ls - Mnceme(1 - 1 have been away
Irom the Philippines for a month, and so can
on'y speak of what was. the condition at that
time. As I observed affairs, there seemed ever*
reason to believe that there would be little
irouDle in the country, in fact all was practi
cally quiet according. to the reports. The af
lalr or the other day In which a company of
men was ambushed Is 6omethingr of which I
was very sorry to hear, and wnSch was of
course entirely unexpected.
Tbe condition of the army In the islands is
very gwod. The men are in good shape and the
Farrlsons are well cared for and in good health.
Every one seemed to be of this opinion and
our Investigations indicated that there was lit
tle Thich could be done to better the condi
tions for the soldiers. The service of the
tran:iports ls as good as it can be. and the
ehlpii are In excellent condition for the service.
Thene seems to-be a good service between the
portsi of dispatch and also between the islands.
General Ludington has been on a tour
of Inspection and is more than satisfied
with the way things arc being conducted
at Manila. Talking about his tour he said
yesterday:
Brigadier General Marshall I. Luding

-\u25a0: The writs .arrived; September. 14, but in

-, "You had access -to the files, did you not?",
asked McLaughlin. ... \u25a0 ;..... .; .
Metson took this as,, an, insult' and told

gave an instance of a discovery of a sub

the contretemps came to an end. -,..\u25a0'â¢\u25a0
\u25a0 Metson explained 'â¢ later ; that' the only

was to examine the j files themselves. {

questions in regard to Geary' s ' connection

'.Metson 'said' in regard to this:
' Geary . kept cautioning' me. not' to get -mixed

intentional. "When it came to -the, cross

Metson Is known as a mlld-raannereÂ«l
man. He told a tale yesterday of prepa
rations at Nome for gun-fighting on; a
magnificent scale. He was right there,
too, when the time came, and the others
were forced to play men from Missouri or
go far back out of the range of guns and
legal processes before he quit an inch of
his ground. \u25a0
Although there were five witnesses on
the -stand during the day, Metson was
the star. He went to Nome before thu
plot spoken of by Hume in his testimony
was hatched.. He was there during the
entire trouble, r.nd in fact mixed right '.n
the midst of it as one with an .active in
terest. It was Metson : who I started the
ball rolling and the contempt cases are
the last development. What he told ot
the judicial methods of Judge Noyes was
of a cumulative nature."' Once during the
afternoon Metson ate fire with Judge Mc-
Laughlin. Both realized that a liberal
mixture of reason" with their valor woukl
extinguish the argumentative conflagra
tion, .and the only real -case of bad-tem
per in two days was smoothed over with
mutual compliments.

PANAMA RIOTâ A. R., Oakland, Cal.
In April, 1836,; a drunken man In Panama
went through the streets stealing fruit
and damaging property for which he re
fused to pay. That day a steamer load of
passengers from the East reached Pan
ama and the natives sought revenge upon
them, assaulting, beating and robbing
them in revenge for the acts of the drunk
en man. The native soldiery was called
upon to quell the riot, but instead of do
ing so turned on the strangers and fired
a shot from a cannon Into a house where
a number had taken refuge. The story of
this riot is. to be found, as described by
Carrie Stevens Walter, In the December
number of the Overland Monthly, volume

CHILTERN HUNDREDSâ T. O. P,.
City. "Chiltem Hundreds" Is a hilly dis
trict in Buckinghamshire" and Oxfordshire.
England, belonging to the crown and hav
ing a nominal office attached to it. called
the "stewardship of the Chiltem Hun
dreds." In the long ago the beech foresta
which covered the Chiltern Hills were In
fested with robbers and to protect tha
peaceable inhabitants from their attacks
it was usual for the crown to appoint an
officer, who was called the steward of tha
Chiltern Hundreds. The office has long
since ceased to serve Its primary, but is
now serving a secondary purpose. A mem
ber of the House of Commons cannot re
sign -his seat unless disqualified either by
the . acceptance of a place of honor and
profit under the crown or by some other
cause. The stewardship of the Chiltern
Hundreds is held to be such aÂ» place, con
sequently it is applied for and usually ac
corded to a member who desires to re
sign. As soon as obtained it is again /re
signed, and is generally vacant when re
quired for the purpose in question. In
othervwords, being appointed steward of
the Chiltern Hundreds Is the English red
tape route to resignation from the Housa
of Commons.

Big Cities' Expenses.
THE country has been somewhat Vtartled by a
report from Boston that a religious body,
called' the Reformed Presbyterian Church, has
expelled a' rhember for becomingSa citizen of the
United States and swearing allegiance to the consti
tution. No fear may be felt that the foundations of
the Government are about to be undermined by this
church. It has a small and scattered membership of
orderly and well behaved,^albeit austere and stern,
people. y . '.''\u25a0] '.
, It had its beginning away back in 1680, when a Rev.
Mr. Cameron, a Covena'nter and field preacher, ap
peared at Sanquhar, in Dumfriesshire and publicly re
nounced his allegiance to Charles II, whom he ac
cused of violating the "Solemn League Vnd Cove
nant." He gathered.a party around him, and in an
encounter with the royaltroops at Kyle was killed;
His followers became the Reformed Presbyterian
Church, separating from the Kirk of Scotland because
that body. has. its v independence guaranteed by the
coronation oath, taken. by the sovereign of Great
Eritain, and these peculiar people refuse to recognize
any government but a theocracy, proceeding from
Divinity. ' They refuse to bear \ arms, to take a' judi
cial oath, serve on juries, 'school boards or in any way
to recognize earthly government; which they regard
as corrupt and wicked.
In this country they have been .the most active pro
moters of the proposition known as the G6d-in-the
constitution movement. They are generally of Scotch
descent, and are' known for their austere, morality and
manners and simplicity of life, and for their hyper
critical \u25a0 attitude toward other forms' of the religious
idea. They pay taxes to secular ; government under
protest, and are usually people in good conditionma
terially. Ini8/6 their presbytery voted to join what
is known as the Free Church, a Presbyterian body;
not large in numbers and holding much -the same
views as to government, oaths, etc.'
As a rule they have the respect of their neighbors
for tlieir uprightness and fidelity to what they think
right, .though they. are not a sociable element in a
neighborhood on acount of -their extreme -austerity
and asceticism. . i, ). < \u25a0 \u25a0 .'
We can afford to regard their enmity to the con
stitution leniently, 'remembering 'that Wendell Phil
lips once made a .bale fire of that document on Bos
ton common and denounced it^as "a league with death
and a covenant with hell,'^ and the .constitution an'd

THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION.
REPORTS from the Yale festival are to the
effect that of all the distinguished scholars and
official dignitaries who are attending that great
gathering not one has received more ' considera
tion than Dr. Booker T. Washington, the
negro principal ol Tuslcegee Normal and Industrial
Institute. Sonic of the attention paid him may be due
to the discussion raised by the fact that he recently
dined with President Roosevelt, but we may be sure
that most of it has a more permanent foundation than
that. Had lje never dined , with the President Mr.
Washington would slill have commanded respect in
such a gathering of educators by reason of the extra
ordinary work he has accomplished in the education
of his race.
The story of Tuskcgee Institute reads almost like
a romance. It was started by Mr. Washington wh.en
he was himself a poor, .unfriended and untried, man..
It began almost literally with nothing, in the way of
material wealth.. It was a case > where a brave, indus
trious, sagacious and indomitable man went out into
the wilderness and set about establishing a center of.
industry and education. He received nothing in' the
way of help until he had proven that he could get
along without help. At the present time his institute
is one of the most considerable in the Union so far
as the number of students is concerned, And one of
the least considerable with respect to .wealth." "It is
virtually living from day to day by the labors of its
students directed by the experience of its principal,
and is about as completely a self-supporting institu
tion as can be found in the: world of' education.
The nineteenth annual report. of the trustees of the.
institute, which has just been issued, states that the
average daih r attendance' of students during the past
year was 1010, and in addition there has been an" aver
age attendance. of. 160 children in the training-school
of the normal department. The school is conducted
on such strict economy that the individual cost to
students averages only Â§73 a year. Of that cost the
larger part is paid ;by the students in the form of
labor, and during the past year the amount credited
to them for lhat service was over $67,000.
While the school aims to train teachers and to fit
students for various lines of industry, the chief study
is agriculture. In his report on the work of the school
Mr. Washington . says : ''The salvation of my race 'will
largely rest upon its ability and willingness to secure
and cultivate properly the soiL I believe that'every
thing possible should be done to enlarge and increase
the efficiency of our agricultural department. In this
connection I am glad to add that arrangements have
been made to reserve three acres of land around the
new -training-school, to be used in giving agricultural
training to -the smallest children. -The negro as â¢ a
slave was started on the foundation of agriculture,,
mechanics and household arts. While I would by
iio means limit his present education to these, but
would in all cases add academic and religious training^
I do believe we shall find.it helpful for a number of
years to come, in our methods of education, to give
great attention to these^ fundamental occupations. In
proportion as one owns the soil and has the mastery
of these fundamental occupations, in the same proobr
tion does he lay the foundation for- : the. highest and
most complete development of himself and children."
Along those lines the school has been working and
its influence has been widely felt. At present it has
students from twenty-nine States and Territories and
from six foreign countries. \ Such a record would be
accounted good had it been made by a university
established' on a foundation' of millions, and the man
who has made it by" his almost unaided efforts' cer
tainly merits honor from all "wfioare concerned in the
education of mankind. ...

WHEN the bill regulating the succession .to
the Presidency was under consideration it
was. carefully scrutinized by able lawyers of
both.parties and * was* extensively discussed both
within and without the halls of Congress. It would
seem that under such circumstances it should have
been brought to something like perfection .before it
was enacted. There are critics, however, who declare
it to be very far from perfect, and these critics are
now demanding that Congress revise the law and
remedy the defects at the coming session.
The first alleged defect in the act is this: It is pro
vided that certain members of the Cabinet in, a stated
pfder shall "act as President until the disability of the
President or Vice President is removed, or a Presi
dent'shall be elected." Now a President is regarded
as having been elected as soon as the % result of the
electoral vote has been declared, and under the exist-,
ing law the count is made on the second Wednesday
of the February following the Presidential election.
The new President, however, does not take his seat
until March 4. There is therefore about three weeks
between. the date of the election and the date of the
installation. Let us suppose now-that a President and
Vice President having died in office, the Secretary *of
State is acting as President. Under the statute his
right to act terminates with the election of the new
President in February, so that from that date until,
,the installation' on March '4 there would be an inter
regnum during which there would be no one to act as
President. â¢ '
It is claimed. by some authorities that in such a case
as that supposed^'the new President would be sworn
into office as soon as elected, instead of waiting for
the regular inauguration day, and consequently there
Would, be ; no" interregnum. The accession to office of
a President in February; instead of March, it v is said,
would have no effect in disturbing any fixed term for
Congress or for.officials, who would regularly hold to
March 4.
- A graver ; question, but at the same time a very
improbable one, arises from what is regarded/as an
other defect of the statute. Should a. President and
Vice President elected on the second Wednesday in
February T die before -March 4 there would be no, one
to inaugurate, and accordingly under the . statute ; the
Secretary of State of the previous administration
would hold office until the next Presidential election.
Now it might be that the incumbent would be a mem
ber of an administration against which the popular
vote had been given, and consequently there would
be in the Presidency for four years a representative of
the party the people'had^ repudiated at the polls.
While\the contingencies suggested are so^remote
they can hardly be termed issues of practical. politics,
it.is nevertheless interesting, to consider the effects
that might flow from them. The opposing views
raise. what are "now but'academjc questions of. law, but
should they arise as actual problems we might be in
volved in serious disputes -between rival parties. - It
would therefore be, prudent for' Congress,- to settle
them at. once. jThere is nothing to be gained in leav
ing in the law even a seeming defect which might be
used to disturb the 'country "over a Presidential) suc
cession., ;MBB^ V ' : 'V.; -..;.- '.'r: v - \u25a0"\u25a0.â¢-â¢â¢-â¢ : .

We have no desire to do ; Mr. Wells any injury and have therefore been careful to
take him by his "self-measurement and by the judgment of the persons who are respon
sible for his candidacy. Viewed in the light he has turned upon himself he is a thorough
impossible, and the city is to be saved by election of his regular opponent- who so' far
has furnished every reason why the independent voters "should supports him against the
class candidate. , .--. x - L' . I 7 ':' .
-Will Mr. Weiis now make a plain statement in his senior, organ of the celebrated
rights which he determined to preserve, even if their proper , preservation required him to
decline the.nomination and retire from the ticket? They must have been very serious and
important "rights if their preservation required such emphatic .action. Where are- they
now? Will he give a ground floor and front elevation of them in their present state and
condition? We say to him frankly, that as those rights, seemed; to involve : his 'manhood
the independent voters are going to take up the task of preserving them where he laid it
down. They are going- to take him at his word and practically retire him from the contest
arid "from politics for al} time to come."
Those who wanted to support him and who refrained from opposition a long
time were watching him closely. They wanted to see what estimate was put upon him by
the men who nominated him and by Mr. Herrin. Those men have exposed their esti
mate. They keenly judged him, and that which he called an "ultimatum" they recognized
as a bluff. Surely he cannot blame the people for taking him at the estimate put upon him
by the men he calls "the leaders and Mr. Herrin/' '
> | "vHE political bosses who made a so-called Republican ticket forvSupervisors which
'] â I â¢'.. Wells felt called to repudiate, until > he was properly rounded up
P % I , ' an d instructed, seem to ' have \u25a0 forgotten' that independent : voting in municipal elec
*â¢ tions is a confirmed habit of San Francisco. Even during the Civil War, when
party feeling had every reason for running high, the people would elect a good candi
date on the Democratic ticket in preference to a' bad; one on the Republican, and vice
versa. Perhaps no large city.in the Union lias shown more discrimination in independent
voting. -This is so well understoocl by wise bosses that even Buckley, in the. height
of his "power," always selected a considerable number of first-class>men on his ticket,' and
even permitted the nomination of some that were opposed to him. In this way it hap
pened that men of eminence, who enjoyed the public confidence, like Bartlett and Pond,
could be elected :Mayor. But the bosses who controlled. the, so-called Republican conven
tion had not that kind of wisdom, and, because they lacked it, loaded the ticket with ma
terial which icpels the independent municipal voter. A|> party lines are largely loosened
in. city elections,. the. party men, who wish their party to succeed,, make nominations that
bear the scrutiny of the independent citizen. That citizen is usually a firm and unyield
ing party man in 'contests- that involve principles,; but no power can convince hirnVthat
any broad party, principle is involved in the election of a ;city government. The bosses
who pipe for party votes will lure in vain. 'Their music is wasted. The people will not
dance to it. â¢' â¢ '-
: According to^his senior organ, the . Bulletin, even Mr. Wells himself felt a" spasm
of this independence, for that paper says that after his nomination he sent an ultima
tum to the bosses -who had put him on the ticket, in the form "of a demand, that -Flint
go on 'the. Supervisor' ticket. He "said "Flint goes on or I go off." He even went
so far as ( to say to a 'Bulletin, reporter that Mr. Herrin agreed wfth â him in this show of
independence. But later developments prove that Mr; Herrin agreed with him only for
the purpose of getting him to change his mind. \ , . ' *
That magician transformed the independent Wells into a superserviceable and) al
together limp and nerveless candidate of the bosses. His, celebrated ultimatum, that had
in it the ring of a bugle : call, sank to thetinldeof'a tea bell calling Mr. Wells to his po
litical supper, and the bold candidate who for one. moment stood like a flint for Flint be
came as soft as butter exposed to our unseasonable hot spell.
The feeling of independence which was i purged, out of him by Mr. Herrin has not
been exorcised from the majority of the voters. With them in municipal. contests it takes
the place of. that party principle which dominates their ballots in general elections. The
firmer the} 1 " are as party men in campaigns that affect -principles the more flexible they
are in city elections in their attitude of independence/ \.
The Bulletin said that on October 3 Mr. Wells said to its reporter: "I believe, how
ever, that as the head of the ticket I have some rights, and those rights. I am: deter
mined to preserve. ,TJie /leaders of the party agree with the position V have taken â¢ and
Mr. Herrin has so expressed himself. I don't know yet \yhen the change will be made, but
if it is not made I shall certainly retire not only from the contest 'but from politics for all
time to come." - â¢'\u25a0\u25a0' '- .-.\u25a0 ; : . '-"".-.

tober 2, in \whlch charges- .were made
against them and which Attorney Pierce
denounced in ; such scathing terms aa to
cause Pope to withdraw from the. cas 1 ?
and ask that the petition be withdrawn.
In granting the motion trie Judge said: -
\u25a0 It is not a plea'sant matter for an attorney
to 'feel that a document of. the character in

me that It is the duty of the court when tho
motion- Is' made by the parties aggrieved to
strike* from the files the petition in question
to grant it. -The matter is entirely within the
discretion of- the. court.- and the proceedings
appearing to have been abandoned and dis

CAI^L BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â For the
first time in several days the State De
partment received information to-day
concerning Miss -Stone, the American
missionary held captive by Bulgarian
brigands. .
j Consul General /Dickinson, at Sofia,
wired the State Department concerning
the whereabouts of the party of which
Miss Stone and Mrs. Tsilka are captives.
The brigands are apparently still in Turk
ish territory. Immediately upon receipt
of Dickinson's dispatch 'Acting Secretary
of State Hill sent an instruction to Mr.
Eddy, secretary of the American Lega
tion, under which that officer will make
such representations to the Turkish Gov
ernment as may facilitate the liberation
of Miss Stone and her -companion. The
authorities are continuing opposition' to
an attack by the-Turkish or the Bulgar
ian troops upon the brigands, believing
the chances of relea.se greater through the
medium 'of ransom than by military
operations.
No information confirmatory of the re
port of the death of Mme.- Tsilka was
received by the State Department to-day.
The failure of Consul General Dickinson
to mention such an occurrence Is accepted
by the administration as- an indication
that he does not credit the report
CONSTANTINOPLE, 1 .- Oct. 23. âCold
rains are falling in the where
the brigands who abducted Miss Ellen M.
Stone, the American missionary, are con
cealed and a prolonged stay in the moun
tains is believed to be almost impossible
even for the brigands. Here it is consid
ered likely that they will hasten to re
lease the captive as soon as they can se
cure the ransom and then disperse to
their homes.
No word has come from the missionaries
to-day, though W. W. Peet, treasurer of
the mission here, to whom they would
communicate, 'is still hopeful. 'Peet is
not expecting news until he is asked to
forward the gold, which it is estimated
wjll weigh between 300 and 400 pounds
PARIS, Oct. 23.-M. Saratoff, the former
president of the Macedonian committee
has written a letter to the Temps, dated
from Paris, emphatically denying the re
ports that he is an accomplice in the ab
duction of Miss Ellen M. Stone, the
American missionary, and that he is even
now at the head of the band of abductors.
He says he has been S living quietly in
Paris for the past month.

MEMPHIS, Tenn.i Oct. 23.â The world's
trotting record for half a mile in competi
tion was broken this afternoon at Billings
Park when Audubon Boy went half a mile
in 1:00%. This feat was accomplished in
the fourth race, a 2:20 class pacing event,
under what is known aa the "Memphis
plan." The first heat at one mile was won
handily by Audubon Boy, Don Monical se
curing second place. Audubon Boy made
his own pace in the second heat, which
was at a mile and an eighth, and won by
two lengths from New Richmond. In the
last heat, starting from the half-mile pole,
the game son of J. J. Audubon went tp the
front and won in the easiest sort of fash
ion in 1:00%, breaking the world's pacing
and trotting record.
Ed Geers brought The Abbot out for an
attempt to lower his record of 2:03%. After
giving' the horse easy exercise the noted
driver sent him away at a fast clip, ac-;
companied by two running horses. The
quarter was passed in 32 seconds, the half

horse was not at his best. He will try
again Saturday.
To-morrow Little Boy will be sent
against his recently made record of 2:01%.
Mr. Billings, his owner, said to-day he
was not satisfied with Monday's perform
ance. He believes the horse can complete

Just after the start Timothy Foley was
crowded to the fence and went down. The
field went on and when rounding the far
turn Johnny of Navarre, with Cochrane
up, overstrode himself and turned a com
plete somersault. Councilman Tom, rid
den by J. Callahan, fell over Johnny of
Navarre. The latter horse was killed and
Councilman Tom was severely hurt and
had to be shot. The jockeys marvelously
escaped injury and walked back to the

NEW YORK, Oct. 23.â A chapter of ac
cidents marred the racing at Morris Park
to-day. Alexander Olsen, one of the Jock
eys, received injuries which resulted in his
death a few hours later. Three other
jockeys had a narrow escape. Two horses
were killed outright, while another was so
badly hurt that it had to be shot.
In the first race King T fell at the water
jump, directly in front of the grand stand
anÂ£ broke his neck, Barry, the jockey, es
caping injury.
It was in the fifth race that Olsen met
with his fatal mishap. When he was
picked up it was at once seen he was se
riously injured. When taken to Fordham
Hospital the surgeons found his skull
badly fractured. He lived until 7 o'clock
this evening. Olsen was 18 years old and
was riding Timothy Foley for K. L. N.
Anderson.

work yesterday constructing forty addi

Futurity course start, and even these will
be insufficient to accommodate all ' the
arriving: stables.
The Morses of Green Morris stood the
trip from New York in splendid shape,
and will soon be ready to answer post
call. Green thinks his rider, Winnie
O'Connor, will be here on time for open

E. G. White, a well known Chicago turf

On a date to be announced in the near

"My husband . left . home at the usual
time on Tuesday night," said Mrs. Cox
last night, "and the tirst intimation I had
that anything was wrong iwas when L
was notified by he gas company at noon
to-day that he had failed to work the
night before. He has been sick for some
time," and -in consequence despondent. He
never spoke of suicide."
Bart S. Cox, for the last seven years
an inspector for the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company, is missing, and
indications point to; his having drowned
himself on Tuesday night. 'He left home
as usual on that night, but failed to re
port for work. Early yesterday morning
visitors to the beach near Land's End
found a coat and vest similar to those
worn by Cox. On the vest was pinned
badge 18 of the company by which he was
employed. \u25a0 -. â¢
Word was sent to police headquarters
and Officer Greggains was detailed on thu
case. He found that Cox lived at 431 Sev
enth avenue In the Richmond district.
His wife info'rmed the officer that her
husband had been ailing for some time
and was despondent, but had not given
any intimation of an Intent to commit
suicide. She recognized the clothing
found on the beach as that her husband
wore when he left home.

rNTHCATES A SUICIDE
â¢Young Mowatt of/Chicago, the "fight
ing conductor," : g.-.ined the . decision over
Toby Irwin of this city in a flf teen-round
bout last night at the Reliance Club, Oak
land. Mowatt was the aggressor.through
out and .won because he did all the fight
ing. His only blow, however, was a right,
which he failed to land except at close
range.
Irwin was the cleverer with his hands
and on his feet, but refused to mix things
with Mowatt, clthough repeatedly urged
to do so by his friends among the specta
tors. He stayed away until the last round
and then did some leading, but It was
too late to shade the verdict in his favor.
The decision cf the three judges was
unanimously for Mo Watt and the crowd
went away satisfied.
Dick Glicuke and Mike McClure won
the preliminaries. Glieuke fought what
was to have been a six-round go with
James Green. to settle an .old grudge.
Green quit in the second round. McClure
had Jack Donnelly of Denver to oppose
him' and had it all his way until the fifth
round, when Donnelly, went out of busi
ness. They were to have gone ten rounds.
It has seldom fallen to the lot of race
goers In California to see .horses run in
the name and the' colors of a woman. In
the Kast and in Kurope it is no such
rarity. Mrs. Cone has seven horses which
will sport her colorsâ white jacket, red
cuffs and red hoop. These include King
Kayon, Frank Klnney, Bombshell, Bar
bara Frietchie, Buzz, Cassiope and Floria.
While their owner gives her personal
attention to their needs, seeing them
every day, they are under the direct man
agement of Washington Perkins and are
trained by John Coleman. In addition to
these there are two exercise boys and' the
regular grooms. AH-the attaches of the
stable are colored men. %,.
In order to be near her horses Mrs.
Cone has rented a comfortable cottage
three blocks from-the track. She usually
visits the track at midday when the
horses have been made up after their
morning's exercise.
She says she seldom bets on her horses,
letting them run for the purses they may
\u25a0win and for the pleasure it affords her to
see them perform. -
Over at Emeryville, where hundreds of
Bleek-lookingr thoroughbred "horses are be
in? galloped Into condition for the forth
coming meeting of the New California
Jockey Club, there is one stable the
horses of which will run in the name of
a woman. The owner is Mrs. Madeline
Cone, formerly of Denver, whose mar
riage to and subsequent leave taking from
Walter R. DInmore created a nine days'
wonder here last year.
Mrs. Cone is a Kentuckian by birth and
absorbed her love of horses watching thÂ«
foals kicking up their dainty heels on her
father's farm in the blue grass State,
famed alike for its great racehorses and
Its beautiful women.
Her Thoroughbreds Have
Won Consistently at Some
Eastern Meetings.

tâ¢ horse has taken to self destruction. The first case of equine suicide ever, re
< portedvin this city occurred -yesterday, afternoon when "Mollie,"' the Hibefnia .Bank's
d^ faithful old steed, shuffled off the mortal coil by dashing headfirst against the- stanch
iron-gates opening onto the grass plot and courtyard on the west side of the bank.
"Mollie" ended her existence shortly before I o'clock; and nearly every attache of the
bank rushed out into the street to gaze in amazement upon the. poor animal that had sud
denly taken and carried into effect the strange notion to cut short her existence.
Dan Burns, the bank messenger, drove "Mollie". into the courtyard at dinner timei un
hitched her, as was his usual custom, and then strapped on the feed bag. The animal fate
nearly all of her oats,.then suddenly threw her head into the air and with a frenzied snort
dashed toward the heavy iron gate and destruction. The mare bolted against the thick iron
bars with terrific force. The big gate shuddered under the potent plunge, the strong lock
broke into a hundred pieces' and "Mollie" stumbled headlong with a broken neck into McAl
lister street. A large crowd gathered. Death came quickly.
. "Mollie's" memory will live long in the minds of the old attaches of the bank who re
.member the faithful old mare when she was a bristling young colt, and that was many years
ago, for/'Mollie's" career of usefulness would have soon been cut short from natural causes
had she not ended it herself.'
: Those connected with the bank are mystified over the freakish act of the animal. No
solution can be offered save that some one might have dropped something on her back from
a neighboring building, causing her intense fright." Then again "Mollie" might have dropped
into a quiet little nap, as horses sometimes do after their dinner, arid upon partial awakening
became frenzied with a dreamy fright that drove her to her own destruction. Two of the. iron
gate bars were bent fully a foot out of place by the collision. '.

In conclusion permit me to say that the crime
for whltfh ; these men stand - Indicted ' is the
blackest that has ever been committed in the
history of this State; that, notwithstanding all
the discouraging facts hereinbefore mentioned,
I am nevertheless keenly sensible that the honor
of both the State of California as. well as that
of Modoc County is involved In this prosecution;
and that I Intend to prosecute these defendants
with all the vigor and energy at my command;
and, to that end, I hereby direct you to proceed
with the arraignment of Defendants Leventon,
Brown and Kades, and to have their trial set
for Monday, . the eleventh day â¢ of November,
1301, or as soon thereafter as may be, having
the cases so set that the defendant Brown will
be first trled^ \u25a0_' .
I am aware that certain newspapers in your
county have seen fit to disparage the prosecu
tion in this case, and have referred to my ef
forts and those -of my subordinates therein in
an unfair and apparently malignant spirit.
I am also aware that- you were present with
my representatives at. the examination of the
lynching cases by your Grand Jury, and I am
Informed by my representatives that you and
they were agreed that the evidence, there ad
duced, warranted the indictment of Leventon,
Brown and Eades, and tbat you and my repre
sentatives were fully convinced of the guilt of
the men indicted: an<J; as you "have not as
signed a belief In the innocence of the" Indicted
men as one of your reasons for desiring to dis
miss these cases, I am warranted m assuming
that you still believe, as do my representatives,
that the indicted men are unquestionably guilty.
Denounces the Crime.
As you are aware, I sent two of my deputies,
Messrs. Post and Sturtevant, to your county to
assist you at the examination of the lynching
matter by your Grand Jury, the result of which
was the Indictment of the defendantsâ Brown,
Leventon and Eades.. I subsequently sent Mr.
Sturtevant again to your county to assist you
in certain matters incident to the case that
came up : before your Superior Court, includ
ing the arraignment of .these defendants. I have
spent several hundreds of dollars of the funds
of this office in an endeavor to aid you in en
forcing the law. ' .
I am aware that the Supervisors of your coun
ty have rejected the claim of the shorthand re
porter who took down the testimony given be
fore the Grand Jury after having been advised
by this office that the claim was a legal charge
and should be t>aldt
I am aware that a brass band went to 'your
County Jail and - serenaded the Indicted men.
'The Attorney General at once sent a
telegram in reply, ordering the arraign
ment and trial of the defendants. Brown,
Leventon and Eades. A - letter was also
mailed to Mr. Bonner. It is in part as
follows:
I will not attempt to express my utter sur
prise at the astounding contents of your com
munication. That Modoc County Is willing to
rest under, the awful and shameful stigma of
the Lookout lynching I do not believe, nor can
I reconcile the sentiment and suggestions of
your communication with the official duties of
a District Attorney.. \u25a0 _ . .
Attorney - General , Indignant.
Please advise me at once In the matter as to
your wishes. These defendants have been held
practically in. solitary confinement for nearly
five months and the county sympathy is very
strong. â¢ â¢ . ." . " ' - : .-. _, . V ,
I arrived home ! yesterday afternoon to find
that petitions for dismissal are being signed by
leading citizens all over the county, irrespective
of political lines or geographical. My candid
judgment is the entire county desires It. I hon
estly consider further prosecution entirely use
less of these defendants. Even the Grand Jury
Itself or a majority have expressed a desire for
dismissal of the cases. Unless you can give me
strong additional evidence I will consider It my
duty to move dismissal of these cases. I think
you and the rest of us can at this late day dis
miss with perfect propriety to all concerned.
I do not feel disposed to continue these mat
ters. â¢ . ' . ' "
The astounding Information that the
people and officials of Modoc County de
sire to dismiss the charges against the
three Lookout! lynching suspects, now iu
confinement at Alturas, was conveyed '.o
the Attorney General yesterday through
a communication to Deputy C. E. Post
from the District ' Attorney of Modoc

The Chinese Government, through Us Minister

OLD OIL RATE

Re-established Pending
Rehearing" of the
Case.
The- Railroad called . a
special meeting yesterday to consider the
petlilon of the Southern Pacific and the
Santa Fe â¢ railroad companies for , a re
hearing of the Bakersfleld . oil-rate â¢ case.
Commissioner B. B. Edson was J In â¢ the
chair and Blackstock was also present.
Laumelster did not attend, the meeting.
Edson opened the meeting by stating
that the two railroad' companies ; -had pe
titioned for a lehearinu of -the case. He
read the' Southern Pacific Company's ar
gument for a new trial, and at its close
Etated that he thought that enough evi
dence, had not been submitted In the caae
and that he was in favor of rehearing.
Commissioner Blackstock seconded the
motion and offered a resolution to theef
fest that pending the rehearing of tho
case the new rate of 37 8-10 cents, ordere.1
by the Commissioners for transportation
of oil from Bakersfleld to San Francisco,
be discontinued and that the old rate of
42 cents be restored.'
This motion was carried and Chairman
Edson ordered that the rehearing -of the
case be set for November 12.
This action on the part of the Commis
sioners created great surprise. - It . was
thought that when the board made the?
recent order reducing the price of thij
transportation of oil it would be agreeable
to all parties concerned. â¢

" "The Henrietta" at the Columbia, In the

every evening. A more finished and satis
fying conception than that of Mr. Robson
as Bertie the Lamb would be difficult to
imagine and. Maclyn Arbuckle's Old Nick
Is almost equally picturesque. Of the
feminine members of the company Miss
Dorothy Rossmore as the fascinating
widow, Mrs. .Opdyke, is most pleasing,
at the popular house. The opera
is excellently cast, and went with spirit
and considerable smoothness. For the
first time this season Montanari is heard
in a role that fully suits her, the grace
ful and pathetic little figure of the Paris-
Ian grisette, Miml, and she is wholly sym
pathetic and pleasing In the part. Agos
tlni is a splendid Rudolph, singing mag
nificently and acting with ardor and truth.
His duet with Montanari in the first scene
was exquisite, Repetto Is a dainty Mu
setta. playing and singing her part with
grace and spirit. The Bohemian trio,
Schaunard, Marcel and Colline, are re
spectively sang by Zani, who does effect
ive work, as the hungry musician: Fer
rari, whose Marcel is conceived in a clever
comedy spirit, and Dado, whose fine
basso was invaluable in Colline's part.
Dado was encored enthusiastically in the
pathetic song to his old coat. Cortesi does
very good workâ he has been a useful
member of the company this seasonâ In
the usual double role of Benoit, the hard
hearted landlord, and Alcindoro. - The
opera is admirably staged and costumed,
and barring longish waits between acts
goes easily and smoothly. It is a little
boisterous in places, but will doubtless
tone down with further presentments.
"La Boheme" goes again to-night and
"Norma," with Avedano, Barbareschi,

Arrested for Cruelty.
Baron Alexander Kahlbahrs. the Rus
sian general who commanded the Czar's
troops in Manchuria, arrived from the
Orient on the steamship City of Peking
yesterday. He is en route to St. Peters
burg, but whether to be disciplined re
mains to be seen. It has been stated that
the famous order which was interpreted
In Manchuria to read: "Drive the Chinese
Into the Amur." in reality read: "Drive
the Chinese across the Amur,", and that
when the terrible news of the affair reach
ed the Czar's ears he was much dis
pleased. The general "gives no intimation
that he is on his way to St. Petersburg
to make any explanation to this effect
When the villagers were forced into the
river by the Cossacks it was estimated
that about 15,000 were drowned. The river
at places; was choked. Whole villages,
\u25a0vrith their thousands of citizens, were
wiped ofE the face of the earth, and not
one was left to tell the tale of Russian
cruelty. On the banks of the river every
house was razed with the exception of
tne 6tone and mud chimneys and a few
lempies.
General Kahlbars has been forty years
a soidler and looks a man whom nothing
would diiunt. Years ago he was appointed
Minister of War for Bulgaria for honor
able services. He was a member of the
Interns tonal Commission appointed in
1ST9 to fix the boundaries in the Balkans.
He entered the Kussian army in lfctil and
has participated in every war since that
time. His record is a brilliant one and
this fact caused the Czar to appoint him
to the supreme command of the Manchu
rian forces in August of last year. He was
then in Paris at the exposition. He re
ceived a telegram from the War Depart
ment to proceed with the utmost dispatch
to Manchuria. He lid so, going out over
the trajis-Siberlan Railway. General
ICah bahrs said yesterday:
I force 1 all the Chinese generals In Man
cfcsiria ti> surrender, together with all their
pien and arms. The last troops to surrender
Before I departed from Manchuria were 7000
n}en. I janlcipated In four expeditions against
the Chinese. I was In supreme command, and
forced the Chinese back Into the mountains.
The expelitlons were most difficult, and every
result was accomplished after great effort. No
carriages or wagons could be carried 'Into the
mountains, and It was only .by pushing the
Chinese backward that we finally brought them
to terms. The subjugation of the province is
complete, and It is entirely under the domina
tion of S.ussia at the present time.
This tisx opened the way for the trans-Si
berian railway to conEtruct Its road down
through the province to Port Arthur, riving
a rtretch of railroad tfrcm the Yellow Sea to
Moscow. At Port Arthur our Paeiac fleet is
mobilized. At Tallen Wan the commercial ship,
ping is gathered. I left Manchuria September

A SCIENTIFIC BREAKFAST.
Rightly selected food will cure more
than hsJf the diseases. Try a scientific
and healthy breakfast Fruit of some
kind, preferably cooked: a dish of Grape-
ICuts, with cream; two soft-boiled eggs.
Put two eggs in a tin pint cup of boiling
water, cover and set off for nine minutes
Whites will then be the consistency of
cream and most easily digested. One
slice of bread with butter; cup of Postum
Cereal irood Coffee.
On th.it breakfast you can work like a
horse and be perfectly nourished until
noon. Tour nervous troubles, heart pal-
pitation, Btomach and bowel troubles,
kidney complaints and various other dis-
orders will gradually disappear and firm
solid health will set in.
Why? You have probably been living

Late mail reports 'from New York say:
"Prices on new association seeded raisins were
finally named yesterday at 5TÂ«c for choice and
6%c for fancy, f. o. b. California. These prices
are %c lower on choice and %c lower on fancy
than the lowest prices previously quoted by
outsiders, and while the trade made no great
rush to buy on the new basis still buyers took
hold fairly well and orders for a Kood many
cars were wired to the coast. Out-of-town
Jobbers took to the prices very much more
readily than the home trade, and before noon
many had wired their confirmations to local
representatives of packers. City buyers un
doubtedly would have bought more freely had
the general situation been more settled. There
were rumors also of prices %S',ic less than
the figures already given and thes>e naturally
increased the nervous feeling.
"Lower prices were also quoted from the
?oast on London layers. Sultanas and Thomp
son's seedless. The new quotations for layers
were $1 10 for J-crown, fl 29 for S-crown and
SI 60 for 4-crown. This is 15c less all around.
,rul tanas and Thompson's seedless were marked
â¢iown %c to 5c and 6c, respectively. The in
terest of the trade, however, centered in seed
ed and little or no attention apparently was
jaid to other roods .
"New local seeded raisins, for delivery within
a few days, are quoted here at 7c for choice
and 7%c for fancy, with rood demand. Old
coast seeded are selling freely from 7%c for
choice to 7%@7Â«ic for fancy. Stocks of old
JXew Torlc seeded are practically exhausted.
Association packers on the coast offer old 12-oz.
rations at 4%c, â¢ f. o. b. coast. New loose
raisins are coming in more freely, a num
ber of cars being received yesterday. De
mand is fairly active at 6c. 6%c and 7c for
::. S and 4 crown, respectively.
"New prunes are selling fairly well and are
."nore plentiful. Santa Claras are offering more
ireely at a 3c basis. New Oregons are due to
arrive in about ten days.
"Currants sold freely from the James Tur
:?ie dnrinc the early part of the day at 5%c
'or Amallas. but at the close holders were firm
at 5%c. The Turpie brought 9990 barrels, fifty
>.alf -barrels, 127S cases, 4255 half-cases and 1142

Condition of Money and Trade.
POSSIBLE GOLD SHIPMENTSâ NATIONAL
IMPORTS ANT> EXPORTS.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"Local monetary conditions should soon Im
prove, as , we are near the period when funds
withdrawn for crop moving purposes will be
gin to return. At the moment currency ship
ments are large, and in view of other known
movements one or two more unfavorable bank
statements would cause no surprise. Bank re
eerves are low and the best has b*en said
when the early return of currency has been
taken into consideration. We are now enter
ins the rold importing season, \u25a0which with re
leasÂ« of crop funds usually Insures a period
of easy money until April. The prospects of
gold import* just now, however, are very re
mote; In fact we seem more likely to send
than to draw gold from Europe. Germany's
financial crisis is evidently reaching: another
critical period; England Is depressed by war
and France, the most prosperous of all Eu
ropean nations, is girding herself to meet con- ''
sequent demands upon her resources for as
sistance; to say nothing of -the chill caused
by the recent break in copper in the United
States. With the European markets In this
mood and Urge Russian, English and other
loans in prospect. It is not likely that gold
will come here In any considerable quantities
under the most favorable conditions; and in
~a-e of untoward circumstances we mieht be
Dbliged even to ship gold, for Europe would
certainly eell our high priced stocks to help
meet their own difficulties. Our forelsrn trade
continues en a. very satisfactory basis, Sep
tember exports showing an excess owr imports
..mounting- to $33,594,000, against $56,333,000 the
\u25a0same month last year. It is worth noting that
several timet! during the past twelve- months
our exports have not only fallen below last
Tear, but that our imports are steadily In
creasing as a result of the difference in trade
<*onditlons here and abroad. The decreases in
\u25a0exports have been chiefly in cotton, .copper,
-readstuffs and steel manufactures, the out
ward movement of which could be readily in
creased by lower prices, provided Europe's buy
ing capacity was not further impaired. in
\u25a0hose days of close International commerce the
differences in prosperity and adversity between
Europe and the United States cannot long en
sure; they must in time approach a closer
>vel, and a? this comes about we may look
'or a reduction of the excesslx-e trade balance
which has been such a feature in our foreign
commerce during the last three years."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct 23.â Speculative activity
to-day was largely confined again to a few
stock?, but the field of action shifted from
the Vanderbilts and Chicago and Northwestern
into St. Paul. Union Pacific and Southern Pa
cific. An overwhelming proportion of the day's
total business was in these three stocks. The
aggregate dealings rose considerably over those
of recent times and as the day progressed the
market showed a broadening tendency in sym
pathy with the sustained strength of the three
leaders. Chicago Great Western came con
spicuously into the movement later in the
day and achieved an extreme advance of 2%
en very heavy dealings, closing at the highest.
Other stocks reacted somewhat from the top.
Influenced partly by a break of 4% in Chicago
and Northwestern preferred. St. Paul's ex
treme rise was 3 points. Union Pacific 2% and
Southern Pacific a point. Among the stocks
to come forward late in the day were mem
bers of the soft coal group and the Southwest
erns with gains of 1 to 1%. Sugar was also
quite notably strong, rising 1%, and Interna
tional Power advanced 2%. The early weak
ness of the market was quite generally over
come by the late advance. Amalgamated Cop
per, which fell 2 points in the morning-, closed
with a net loss of only 1%. There was some
very large selling in the stock and it was
affected by the weakness of " raw copper in
London. The local tractions and People's Gas
were also prominent In the early depression.
Glucose Sugar fell 2% and the preferred 2 un
der raids by the bears, and Hocking Coal wai
forced down 1%. with a subsequent recovery.
There was some continuance of the early
strength of yesterday in the Vanderbilts. New
York Central rising 1%. Chicago and North
western 3 and the preferred 3%, but the move
ment was not continued after the reaction tn
the market. There was no specific news to
account for the action of the market., but It
was undoubtedly based upon the assumption
that the negotiations now in progress will re
sult in the settlement of the Northern Paciffe
controversy with beneficial effect on the entire
Northwestern system. The neglect and lag
ging tendency of Great Northern preferred and
Northern Pacific preferred did not seem to dis
turb this conviction. Neither did the appar
ent contradiction found in the resistance of
the retirement of Northern Pacific preferred and
the broad Intimation from President Hill that
the Great Northern Is to be consulted In th<Â»
matter of the control of the Burlington system
as well as Northern Pacific. These Insistencies
are regarded as the vantage to be shrewdly
held while the process of bargaining .ig still
f^olng on. as it undoubtedly is. Total sales.
792,400 shares.
The bond market was quite active and broad
and prices as a rule advanced. Total sales,
par value, $4,670,000. United States refunding
2s declined V* and the old 4s V4 per cent on the
last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. ' 23.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business on the Stock Exchange continued to
dwindle to-day and consols' were heavy, on the
withdrawal of Â£399,000 in gold coin to Ger
many.
\u25a0 Paris exchange is heavy, but' discount Is 2%
per cent.
London" is beginning to whisper about a rise
in the bank discount rate, although such a
movement is likely to-morrow. Neither French
nor German gold exports quite pay yet and there
are special reasons why America is the best
market.
London did little in stocks, but when New
York came higher in Union Pacific and St.
Paul we did considerable in options in Atch
ison, although it was suspected to be a case
ot stage army effect to cover . sales elsewhere.
The general contango is 3% on a small account.
. Copper stocks automatically follow Amalga
mated, the formula being a movement of 1 in
Amalgamated to U In Tintos.

Back of Nevills' fight there is a story.
Revenge enters into his plans. It is said
that he had a'dlstinct understanding with
the projectors of the line that the moun
tain terminal should be Jamestown. Act
ing on this agreement, the mining . man
put $500,000 into : a palatial hotel and as
much more into other improvements. His
Rawhide mine backed up the j town and
times became livelier there than for
twenty years previously. But when the
road pushed on to Sonora and Carters,
Jamestown was injured and Nevllls' hotel
became; a "white elephant." He is now
free from litigation over his mining prop
erty and has money in plenty. He has
doubled the forces in his Rawhide and
App mines and is booming all of his enter
prises. . .-
It Is said that many of . the merchants
are not enthusiastic over the coming of
the mountain railroad and will back
Nevllls In his fight for a \u25a0 return to old
time methods of transportation. Nevllls
believes he can make, the '.railroad regret
its go-by of Jamestown and is prepared
for. a stubborn .fight. The railroad peo
ple's side of -the story, is not obtainable
here.- ' -" ." r-. : ._ :. . \u25a0 -, : \u25a0 . .\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 >
STOCKTON, Oct. 23.-Captain W. 'A.
Nevllls, the mining magnate, whose inter
ests in and about Jamestown run into the
millions, has sworn enmity to the Sierra
Railroad and proposes to make his anti
pathy" of a kind that will count against
the mountain line. He will this, week put
on a big line of freighters between Oak
dale and Jamestown and contract to haul
all goods offered him at $1 or more a ton
less than the railroad schedule. Further
than this, he announces that he will meet
every cut the road makes and will give a
rapid and satisfactory service.
,. The people in the mountain districts af
fected are said to hail with delight a re
turn to old-time conditions, when the big
freighters dotted every trail and the crews
made money fly in the roadhouses.

An inquest was held yesterday Jay Cor
oner LÂ«land in the case of Peter Lynch,
who was shot in the leg July 30 last by
one of two colored non-union teamsters
while defending themselves from, an at
tack by, a mob. The Jury returned a ver
dict of accidental death, practically exon
erating William Ferguson and Roscoe
Horn, the men who fired into the crowd.
The nitnesses told practically the same
story ta the effect that as the two colored
rneii were going to work in Enmons' sta
bles on Eleventh street they were ad
vanced upon by two crowds of strikers,
one numbering fourteen or fifteen men
and the other about twenty-five men.
When the smaller mob had reached the
middle of Eleventh street, near Harrison,
Ferguson and Horn drew their revolvers
and finsd into the crowd, wounding Lynch
Dr. Charles M. Miller of the Central
Emergency Hospital testified that when
Lynch came to the hospital he told the
\u25a0witness that .while walking diagonally
a.Â«>ross the street with his back turned to
Ferguson and Horn he had been struck
by a bullet intended for some one else.
William Ferguson, one of the men who
did the shooting, took the stand and iden
tified Wallace Jamieson, a fireman of en
gine No. 29, as one of the mob. While he
and Horn were going to their work they
saw another fireman go to the door of the
saloon on the southwest corner of Folsom
and Eleventh streets and call to some one
inside:
"Wait a minute, I want to see the fun."
Ferguson testified that he saw Jamieson
leave the engine-house and mingle with
the mob just before the advance was
made upon the witness. When the crowd
began to cross the street for the purpose
of attacking the witness and his compan
ion several stones were thrown and Fer
guson ordered the men to stand back and
drew his revolver. One of the mob made
a threatening remark and the crowd con
tinuing to advance menacingly, the wit
ness'fired one shot in the air. This not
having the desired effect he shot into the
crowd.
Horn corroborated the testimony of his
companion.
Detective Sergeant J. F. Dlnan produced
the transcript of a statement made to him
by Lynch shortly after the shooting."
Lynch said that the strikers had attacked
the colored men and they had fired their
revolvfrs and shot Lynch accidentally.
The Jury returned the following verdict:
That the 6aid Peter Lynch came to his death
October 20 through septic pneumonia and sep
ticaemia following gundshot wound of left hip
inflicted by either William Ferguson or Roscoe
Horn, which one we are unable to determine.
We flnd that the shooting of said Peter Lynch
was accidental.
Coroner Leland approved the verdict.
Killed by. an Elevator.
A Japanese olevator boy known as
George was instantly killed last night at
the Hotel Metropole, 6 Turk street. He
had taken a lady passenger to the third
floor of the building and stepped out of
the cage to direct her to a room. While
he was out of the cage the elevator sud
denly started vpward. In attempting to
catch it the boy had his head crushed
between the floor - and the frame ' work

Keys the initiates are compelled to do
what they are told by a chosen leader. In
evening dress coats, duck trousers and
plug hats the neophytes met the 8 o'clock
local train this morning at Berkeley sta
tion and escorted the San Francisco co
eds to college. Each man had a tin Jiorn
and when he approached a co-ed he lifted
his plug ceremoniously and gave a blast
on the horn, then he took her books or
grip and walked with her to her class
room. The morning hours were spent in
flying kites and escorting unwilling co
eds over the campus. As most of the
women students were afraid tb,pass from
one building to another on account of the
marked attention they received the col
lege classes suffered severely for want of

\u25a0: ' ALONG CROWDED STREETS
Voting Woman's Remarkable Grit
and Presence of Mind Saves
Her Life.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 23.â Miss Kitty Snell
of San Francisco, at one time a member
of a theatrical company there, had a
thrilling experience in a runaway here
this afternoon, and but for her presence
of mind she would have been killed or
badly injured. The young lady was being
driven in a closed coupe on Third street,
near St.- James. A piece of broken har
ness frightened the horse and he became
unmanageable, the driver being thrown to
the ground. The horse then ran up St.
James to First street and along First at
a breakrneck pace.
Miss Snell. displayed great grit and
presence of mind. Reaching out of the
window, she seized, the lines. For three
blocks on First street, whieh was crowd
ed with rigs, she skillfully guided the
horse. That collisions were avoided
seemed almost miraculous. Every one
expected to see Miss Snell killed.
In turning from First on to San Fer
nando street the rig crashed Into a pea
nut stand T>n the corner, entirely de
molishing It. The horse wa3 then
stopped.
Aside from having, her hair disarranged
and a silk waist torn, Miss Snell suffered
no damage. . . ..
Miss Snell* formerly lived here, but
several years ago went to San Fran
cisco to study for the stage, and for some
time was a member of a stock company
in one of the theaters. She was reared
on her father's cattle ranch near Mount
Hamilton,, and the knowledge of horses
she then gained probably saved her life
to-day. . . \-.-,--. :-;'\-.^ 'Â«,:

Not- only ia education needed in the islands,
but there should be :disseminated in the States
of this great Union instruction that will edu
cate the people to exercise patience. -.
It will take many years to bring these island
tribes, to a state of, civilization equal to our
own. Spain, you' say. did not educate those
people. Yes, she did. For three hundred
years she gave them Instruction in the arts
and sciences; she taught them engineering, law.
philosophy; the practice of medicine, -and,- as
a- result, there were natives of the utmost re
finement and wealth who were the equals of
any civilized people. Spain acquired these
islands when in the zenith of her elory and
the race distinction was never wiped out until
the guns of Dewey's fleet gave this country a
foothold in the Philippines. Our duty â¢ Is â¢ to
teach them the principles of 'liberty that have
made this the grandest republic the world has
ever seen. Thia is the task we have before
us and it will require time and patience. \u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢

ASSASSIN CUTS
VICTIM'S THROAT
VANCOUVER, Oct. 23.â For the : third
time I within six months Charles | Suto.' \u25a0 a.
New Westminster hotel proprietor, has
been attacked by an unknown assassin,
who appears /to be relentless in' his deter
mination to end Suto's life. Suto's throat
was cut 'by.{tha murderer last
night, and the .'.wound may caused hU
death.
Suto lives alone in the rear of the depot
hotel. \u25a0 He went home at about midnight.'
As- soon as he opened the front door he
heard a noise which convinced him* that
some one' was in the room. He spoke, but
received no answer. ; He went 'toward hid
bedroom to light a lamp, and he was fol
lowed by the assassin, who attacked him
just as he entered the door of his sleeping
room. \u25a0? The man* jumped upon Suto from
behind and threw him to the floor, and
immediately drew >Â»-.<\u25a0 ra?or-edged knife
across Suto's throat, :.' Inflicting a deep
gash extending almost from 'ear to. ear.
Suto raised an outcry and , the assassin
made off with all possible speed. He wa-s
seen to. disappear through the doorway b/
his victim, -who ; was . lying prostrate . on
the floor- and ; unable to follow him. A
few seconds later Officers McKercher and
Johnson arrived'; on the scene andvSuto
was Â£ removed to ' the hospital. The offi
cers instituted a search for ! the criminal,
but without avail. - . " - .
Owing to. the darkness Suto did not get
a good' look: at his assailant and- does not
even know, whether he was a Japanese or
avwhite man. t He says he has no bitter
enemies that he is aware, of and does not
know, of any reason: why he should have
been attacked. \u25a0 .

BULLETS BURDEN
THEIR SCHOONER
The George W. Prescott is a trim little
schooner of . 54 , tons burden. She left San
Francisco on May 28, 1897, bound for the
Arctic whale fisheries. - Not until to-day
have her captain and crew stepped upon
American- soil other than' that of Alaska.
For four years the hardy craft has been
fighting with the fierce- seas of the Arc
tic Ocean. For weeks at a time she was
locked in the ice. During her wanderings
the schooner cruised as far south as Ja
pan and as far north as Cape North. â¢.
The catch of the - schooner -would be
taken to some Siberian or Alaskan port
and soldi . The boat would then go for
another cruise. One of the six menln the
crew died and was buried at sea with all
the honors which the . rough, seafaring
men could give him. At one time the crew
nearly perished from â¢ starvation. j For
eight weeks they were locked in the ico
and unable to get supplies. Their provi
sions dwindled until each man was living
on a biscuit a day and the flesh from a
stray seal that they happened to kill.' A
break in the ice enabled them to move
their vessel and a lucky encounter with
a Government cutter saved them from ex
pected'death. . . _
A year ago the schooner wintered at
Teller City, The 'crew deserted and fled
to the gold fields. With the coming of
spring an entirely new crew had to be en
gaged.
The Prescott, arrived in the harbor to
aay in a leaky condition. Since leaving
Bering Sea the crew have had to keep the
pumps going constantly. She will have to
go on dry dock in this place before going
southward. - \u25a0
During the time the sehooner .has been
in the north her owner, John ' Smith, a
resident of Whatcom, died. Captain
Douglass was making inquiries to-day to
learn to whom he should . surrender his
command. He is tired of fishing for
whales and would like to turn the
schooner, over to her owners. These can
not be found. Until some one who can
legally claim the boat appears Captain
Douglass will have to remain with her.
SEATTLE, Oct. 23.â After four years of
battling with the ice of the Arctic* Ocean,
the sehooner George ' W. Prescott re
turned to this port to-day; - It is an.Inter
esting .tale of mingled hardship and good
fortune that Captain Angus Douglass
tells. :
"While due praise must be awarded to thosv
of the officers and crew who remained on the
ship until she sank under their feet and for
assisting so many of the passengers to reach
the boats and other available means of preser
vation as presented themselves, we cannot ig
nore the fact that there was an unpardonable
lack of appreciation of existing danger to their
fellow passengers shown by those in the boats
regarding the rescue of others who for the
want of an opportunity had not been able U>
avail themselves of a chance of boarding the
boats before they left the ship's side.
We think that Pilot Le Blanc . is open to
censure for his action in keeping the ship at
full speedâ at the rate of nearly fourteen knots
an hourâ after seeing* floating ice some ten
minutes before the accident; we would also Con
demn the custom apparently in vogue in coast
waters in leaving the bridge of a steamer at
night (and mere especially a passenger steam
er), in charge of only one officer.
We also find that there is no evidence before
us that the loss of the Islander was due to
the Intemperance of the master or others.
That the Islander was wrecked on the night
of August 15. 1901, by contact with some un
known substance {presumably ice drift, very
much submersed), sinking in deep water In lesa
than twenty minutes after the collision and re
sulting in the loss of life of master, sixteen of
the crew and twenty-three passengers.
It does Dot appear from the evidence that the
master realized the imminent danger in which
the accident ! placed the ship." hence the lack.
of prompt and resolute means in arousing the
crew and passengers, who were asleep in'tha
cabjns; in placing- an officer and crew to each
boat and in forcing the proper quota of pas
sengers to each boat. The evidence clearly
shows the capacity of the boats, was sufficient
to accommodate every person on board, but on
account of Improper management and discipline
there was a rush to the boats at the last
moment, which was beyond the control of the
few officers and members of the crew engaged
in gettinff~lhe boats into the water, thereby
preventing the rescue of several valuable lives.
VICTORIA, B. C./Oct. 23,-The Com
missioner and assessors appointed to in
quire into the loss of the steamer Islander
gave out their finding this morning. In

the place finally tells her parents of her

Club was held at Franklin Hall last even

The meetinsrwas called to order by M.

Club of the Fortieth Assembly District.
The following officers were elected: :
President, George A. Connolly; secre
tary, John T. Bennett; treasurer, James
RIordan. . ' -. .;
A campaign committee -consisting of
twenty members, one from each precinct
in the district, was appointed . by the

Under the captions ""Workingmen should vote
for Wells." â¢ "Unions should not support Labor
party," "Wells is the only representative can
didate" and "Wells as Auditor," we are told
that there is a man . before the people whose
greatest struggle in life has been the up
lifting, the ennobling, the protection and care
of his fellow man, whose chief desire has been
to obtain for his -.fellow workers maximum
wages and minimum hours. Such merit might
fall as music upon receptive ears who know
not to - the -contrary, but to the wise i it is
farcical.
Mr. Wells was a carpenter and used a
hammer, and not the least of his faults is
the fact that he has carried that hammer ever
since he 'has ceased carpentering. That ham
mer is and has been for labor, and he has used
it for thirty years and has not let an oppor
tunity slip by. j
He with four others, in 1869, controlled the
entire planing mill Industry of San Francisco.
In 1867 the eight-hour day went into effect and
remained â¢ so until 1869. Mr. Wells | got out
his little hammer, and being master 'of the
situation, destroyed ; the eight-hour day by in
creasing the time of mill hands from eight
to ten hours. Was this friendship to labor? \u25a0
After thirty years the Building Trades Coun
cil undertook the re-establlshmtnt of the eight
hour day, and after a long-drawn-out i contro
versy succeeded, but not until. Mr. Wells and
his little hammer once more took action. This
occurred on August 24, 1900. 'when without ap
parent interest or reason, uninvited by' either
side, he again opposed labor, attempted' to
show the inadvisability of the eight-hour day,
predicted all sorts of disaster in case of lte
adoption and strenuously, decried the â¢ wisdom
of such a move. Was this friendship to labor?
It was neither friendshlD to labor nor an ex
hibition of business Judgment, for If Mr. Wells
is caDable of knowing anything, he ought to
know, the mill business. But subsequent events
have oroven that he did not even know that,
as the mill owner and mill worker are to-day
enjoying more harmonious and : profitable rela-'
tions than ever before, and eight hours' labor,
constitutes a day's work. I '. Â»-
Fellow, workmen, do not be Influenced by the
blandishments, claims and^ promises of a paid
partisan pacer. Let manhood \u25a0 be - your stand
ard.-and whether a candidate was. or is a la
boring man or not, be guided by your convic
tions and select the man in "whom, you think
reposes the ability \u25a0 and 'honesty to properly
conduct the city's affairs. v All men are labor-'
ers, whether they are â¢ mechanics or "not, andi
as the conduct of public office concerns us all
and affects us all pecuniarily, < it : is to our. in
terest, and a â¢ selfish t interest at that. ( to "hava
a wise, economical and energetic,administra
tion,'and to that, end it.ls equally'our duty to
show to this community that the day has long
since â¢ passed " when â¢' labor ' could - be \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 wheedled,
coaxed and fooled , by Isenseless Bulletin â¢\u25a0 edi
torials. - (' . .' JOHN : B. WILLIAMS. <

The following communication from a
member of the Brotherhood of Carpen
ters and Joiners of America discusses
phases of the campaign that have not
previously received attention:
To the Editor: It is extremely annoying and
sickening as each campaign occurs to read in
the daily prints the paid eulogies of this or
that candidate, particularly so when they ap
pear in capers that have no politics and are.
with the side which pays the highest figure. '
It is equally sickening to witness the syco
phantic efforts of such journals when the sop
is extended to the laboring element, and the
merits' of a candidate. In statements true or
false, are paraded with a view to attract su]%
port. â¢ -â¢ . \u25a0 '\u25a0 .' \u25a0. " â¢
- I have yet to call to mind the first candidate
for Dubllc office of Importance who has not
been the lifelong friend of labor â who did not
weep when labor wect and burst with Joy at
labor's success, when in reality labor was. a
nightmare, a thing abhorrent, a- contact to be
studiously avoided, if DCS3lble, without detri
ment. Such is the position of the usual can
didate and Buch is the usual course of the
newspaper which makes his fight. Such truck
ling, sniveling, hypocritical conduct in candi
dates is nauseating; in newspapers intolerable.
The present campaign is no exception to the
rule and the same hackneyed, time-worn tac
tics again appear in a new dress. The Bulle
tin presents its candidate and is with breathless
anxiety engaged in teaching us, the working
people of San Francisco, how Asa R. Wells
used the hammer (as a carpenter), what he has
done for labor, how sorry he is that it was his
misfortune not to "have been able to have done
more, and now. that he is incidentally looking
for a few votes, what he will do in the future.
From Mr. Wells' standpoint, and what he
would have labor believe, there ia nothing in
the city but labor; it is the alpha and omega
of the situation. Mercantile, capitalistic and

Member of Carpenters' Union Tells
How the Candidate Has Used
His Hammer.
SAYS WELLS IS NOT . i
A FRIEND TO LABOR
The gentleman. asks me If my In
terests are yours. They are. 1 rep
resent interests ivhicli every man in
this audience has helped to create.
Gentlemen, the people I urn proud
to call mine commenced their life in
this land in ' mm humble circum
stances as any man in this hall. By
their efforts they have risen to a.
condition of comparative wealth.
Their prosperity I have shared. But,
gentlemen, I have never forsotten
that my father entered this city a.
poor man. I have never forgotten
that my father worked on the
streets of this city, and any man
that says I am not the friend of the
worklngman, lies.
I desire and I hope 'that the spirit of my
address to you this evening will put me .on
entire equality with every man irt this audi
ence. I come not as a man with his eye on
some future political goal, but. as a man with
the interests of San Francisco at heart, a
man interested in the welfare of every citizen,
no matter what his condition in life may be.
X hope I represent no one but the people in
this light, and if elected I know I will repre
sent in the City Hall no one but the people.
I do not want you gentlemen to look upon me
as I have been represented. I am. one of you.
My sympathies are all with you. Your inter
ests are my interests.
Here the speaker was interrupted in
sarcastic tone by the query:
"Do you really mean to tell us, Mr.
Tobin, that your interests and ours are
the same?" .
WHEN Joseph S. Tobin mounted
the platform at . McGrath's
Hall, 530 Third street, last
night a handful of lusty
, lunged â¢ young men tried ' to
stampede the meeting with the slogan of
"Three cheers for Schmitz!" The meeting
refused to stampede and- Joseph S. Tobin,
when he left the hall, left behind him a
room full of friends cheering to the echo
the candidate for Mayor. \u25a0,'-',
Tobin addressed two meetings last even-
Ing and In both cases confirmed the good
impression he has so far made wherever
he has appeared. After leaving McGrath's
Hall he went to Masonic Hall at Four
teenth street and Railroad avenue, where
a crowded auditorium awaited him and
where he was given an enthusiastic re
ception.
His address at McGrath's Hall was in
part as fellow's: \u25a0 -
NO INDORSEMENT FOE,
MAYORALTY CANDIDATE
I am not to be driven from the issues of
this campaign by anything that may be said
about 'me personally. These things will take
care of \u25a0 themselves later. I am no Sancho
Panza.to be tilting at windmills, when there
are live animals In the land more worthy of
my steel.
The speaker again referred to the "Wells
Interview and after reviewing the issues
of the campaign, said:
There was another large audience await
ing Tobin at Masonic Hall. His address
was in part as follows:
I shall make it my purpose, If I get into
office, to see that the present City and County
Hospital, a' place unfit for over-night accom
modation for the poorest of a poverty-stricken
land, is replaced by a modern, practicable,
humane hospital. The present institution is
a dishonor and a crime.
Tobin i then referred to â¢ the interview
\u25a0with Asa R. Wells published in yester
day's Call, in which the Republican can
didate for Mayor explains that not only
did the Republican leaders agree with the
position he had taken in demanding the
placing upon the Republican Supervlsoral
ticket of one candidate of his own se
lection, but that Mr.- Herrin had con
sented to a compliance with his request.
Mr. Tobin said:
Who Ir Mr Herrin? What Is Mr. Herrin
that he should be quoted In this manner by the
head of the Republican ticket? You know who
Herrin. is. You .know what he represents. 'The
head of the Republican ticket tells us that Mr.
Herrin 'gave his consent to a change in that
ticket â Mr. : Herrin, .who represent* debauchery
in public-life, .-who represents the corrupters of
legislators, the purchasers of Supervisors;' Mr.
Herrin, who represents corporations that must
buy franchises from the city, corporations- that
\u25a0ell water and gas to the city. â¢ .
Why does the head of the Republican ticket
quote Mr. Herrin? Because Mr. Herrin repre
sents the supreme ' office-giving powers. Be
cause Mr. Herrin gave him and all the others
on the Republican ticket the nominations they
hold. No man taking a nomination on. the Re
publican ticket can consistently take it with
the intention of doing his duty- toward the
people. No man can serve two masters.
I accepted this nomination not because I
sought political prererment, but because 1
deemed It my duty, because I was a young
man and because circumstances "placed me in
a position 'to devote my time to the things
that will tend to the good of San Francisco./
I believe that no man that works as I know
you work, as I have seen you work, in the
foundry and in the ship's hold, should work
more than eight hours.
-\u25a0--It ..has -been definitely established that
Schmitz will not secure. the solid vote of
the Musicians' Union, of which he 'is
president. Several members of that body
said yesterday that Schmitz would not
get more, than twenty "votes from the
members of his own organization. They
declare that while no open - hostility I has
manifested itself against him in the union
there is a, deep V feeling- that he is .not
qualified to serve the city as Mayor and
that his election would be c a serious blow
to -the industrial advancement of the city.
The ; hostility shown â¢ by -,the , Building
Trades Council, to the labor ticket ' has
set i-the- laboring. men of the city think

organ of "the organized workers toward'
the :\u25a0 labor ticket as a .whole > Is having \u25a0&
weighty ..effect .upon workingmen of all
classes: .' This opposition among the very
interests Â« in which Schmitz expected to
find solid support . is proving a serious
blow to the . labor candidates. Efforts are
being . made to .. harmonize the conflicting
The Schmitz . managers are rounding
up. the unions and bringing pressure to
bear upon their partisans in those bodies
to cause resolutions to be adopted In
dorsing the entire labor ticket. Up to
date only three unions have given the de
sired Indorsement, and the greatest dif
ficulty is being experienced in whipping
the labor organizations into line. .
I The personnel of the labor candidates
appears : to be the great stumblins-block
in the .matter of general indorsements.
Many union - men who favored the elec
tion of labor candidates changed their
minds when they caught a glimpse of the
majority, of the Supervisorial nominees.
There was little to â¢ inspire union â¢ voters
with confidence in many of their candi
dates,'and the result is an ever increas
ing feeling that the interest of San.Fran
cisco, could in no way .be subserved = by
their election. â¢';.'\u25a0_\u25a0 --\u25a0 v
The division of sentiment among: \u25a0 the
union 5 ranks relative to the candidacy of
Schmitz f6r' Mayor is growing more pro
nounced as' the; campaign progresses.
Men who were ardent supporters of the
labor ticket a) few days ago are now

DISSENSION IN LABOR
PARTY BANKS GRO\5rilTO
Most of us would rather watch others
than work ourselves.
The Labor party candidates addressed
three poorly attended meetings last night,
the first at Bear Hall, corner of Post and
Fillmore streets, the second at a hall at
Pacific and Leaven worth streets and the
third at the Alcazar building. Little In
terest in the speechmaking was manifest
ed and the applause was quite perfunc
tory. \u25a0-' -
At Bear Hall a crowd consisting of the
most part of boys In search of election
cards greeted Schmitz and his bodyguard
of office seekers. The meeting was pre
sided over by L. M. Manzer, who said
that he favored the Labor party because
he wanted equal rights for all and special
privileges for none. When Schmitz ar
rived the band played "We "Won't Go
Home Till Morning," and the small crowd,
some of whom were under the impression
that it was a Democratic meeting, yelled
for Tobin. When somebody suggested
three cheers for "Fatty" Maher they were
given with a. will.
Schmitz regaled his audience with a
memorized speech,, in which he repeated
some of Abraham Lincoln's sayings and
told what he would do when he was elect
ed Mayor. He had his - usual fling at
Tobin's polo pony, but the audience did
not appreciate the humor of his observa
tion. When he said that the meanest
ditchdigger might be assured of a welt
come at his hands after election aÂ»mur
mur of applause broke the deep silence.
Schmitz found fault with the platforms
of all the'parties save that of the Labor
party and wound up with the statement
that he was for the man before the dol
lar every time. Other speakers at the
meeting were William- J. Kenney, W. D.
Getchell and-J. T. McEntee.
A small audience greeted the labor
standard-bearer at Pacific and Leaven
worth streets. Schmitz repeated his speech
here and his utterances aroused no more
enthusiasm than at the previous meeting.
The speakers at this place were Dr. ! J.
JT.f Dillon, Thomas Gallagher, Thomas
Eagan, P. H. Coyle and J. J. Daughney.
The .shoe clerks met In the Alcazar
building and after the executive session a
smoker was given- to the members. A
set programme was rendered, one of the
events being a six-round glove contest
between two members. Schmitz and his
contingent arrived while this was in pro
gress and his entrance was in . conse
'quence quite flat. The announcement that
Police Judge Fritz was in the hall created
a sensation and that official was given an
ovation. Subsequently Schmitz was intro
duced and he took advantage of the oc
casion to throw more bouquets at himself.
Several addresses by labor, candidates
were delivered. : .' Â» .

wider grows. the breach. -
The candidacy of Police Judge Alfred
J. Fritz for re-election is regarded with
general ' satisfaction, and' he is receiving
the support of all classes, \u25a0 irrespective of
party affiliation. His conscientious and
fearless official course during the last two
years has won for him - the admiration
and . respect -of the, public generally, so
that the support he is -receiving warrants
the prediction on the part of his workers
that he will distance his opponents by
far. - --â¢ \u25a0..-.,.
The friends of Harry Baehr. Republi
can candidate \u25a0 for Auditor, are â¢â¢ making
an excellent fight for their candidate.
Baehr' s popularity is winning for him
the support of men upon whose aid he
had at no time counted. An army of
faithful workers Is making his canvass,
and on all sides assurances of fealty are
repeatedly expressed.
I was born in the south of Ireland and was
resident in Liverpool when I decided to como
to America. When I reached San Francisco,
thirty years ago, I found that my countrymen
were running things In this country anyway
and my assistance was scarcely needed. Here
In San Francisco an Irish policeman, McCop
pin, was Mayor.
A physician knows no country. The profes
sion is destined to promote the brotherhood of
man, and to break down national prejudices.
In my opinion there is no more justification
for the existence of' national boundary lines, in
this age of ready communication | and rapid
transit, than there was for the existence of
clans, in medieval times. .The nation is the
clan of modern times. - -
So, although I have lived here thirty years,
I am still a subject of Great Britain largely,
I presume, because thinking as I did about
such things I. was too lazy to take out naturali
zation papers. But. I am a taxpayer. In Eng
lish municipalities there is more freedom in
that respect â whatever your nationality you
vote if you are a property holder. Property
qualification? Yes, that is true. You can't
vote unless you have property.
My interest in this is not political. I have
never concerned myself with political ques
tions and am not now, but when I consider it
iny duty to speak out I do not shirk it. .
Dr.. Buckley's sudden Interest in affairs
of government astounds those of his ac
quaintances who know of his prejudices
against national boundaries and devotion
to country." The average man of this day,
when patriotism is still judged a virtue,
is not able to associate indifference to na
tional welfare with unselfish interest in
municipal affairs or to see how these ap
"parently antagonistic states of mind can
be harmonized. Dr. Buckley explained to
a Call reporter last night why he had
lived thirty years in America and had re
mained a subject of Great Britain. He
said:
prominence and financial afflu
ence here without deeming it desirable
to become a citizen of the country which
smiled so graciously upon him, has taken
it upon himself to. advise the people of
San Francisco in municipal affairs. He
opposes the candidacy of Joseph S. Tobin
for , Mayor and in communications to an
afternoon paper warns the people that
if they expect honesty or devotion to their
interests in case of Tobin's election they
are hugging a delusion.

THERE will be no amalgamation
of the retail and wholesale liquor
dealers' . associations, and there
wifl be no indorsement of . Wells
by either. Tobin or Schmitz will
be indorsed by the liquor merchants, if
any indorsement whatever is ..given, but
the Indications are that no candidate
for Mayor will â¢ be indorsed. The
trap to catch the retailers and bring them
into the wholesale organization was set
by John Lynch, Collector of Internal
Revenue. The retailers and the whole
salers will not stand for the Lynch pro
gramme. They know Wells' record on
the license question and that is enough
for them. All the Lynches in creation
cannot change .their purpose to ' protect
themselves.
Johnny Lynch, whose term as a Federal
officeholder Is drawing, near the end, Is
again neglecting his official duties to
meddle in affairs that chiefly concern
people who pay taxes to support our mu
nicipal government. Lynch is not a resi
dent of San Francisco, and it is none or
his business how the liquor dealers vote.
If he goes too far in his implied threats
to make it uncomfortable for dealers who
will not take the programme he may
get what he most deserves. It may
gratify representatives of the liquor trade
to know that Senator Perkins has agreed
with Senator, Bard to take up the sub
ject of the appointment of Lynch's suc
cessor as soon as Congress meets. Sena
tor-Bard favors Stephen Kelly of San
Bernardino . and Senator Perkins agrees
to indorse any good man recommended
by his colleague in the Senate.
Lynch Has Tricky Ways.
Lynch is noted for his readiness to
do the nastiest kind of politics. iHe will
go to the. limit of using forged tele
grams. At Sacramento he produced a
bogus telegram, representing it to be a
genuine message from Senator Perkins
requesting members of the Legislature to
vote for D. M. Burns for United States
Senator. Even Senator Perkins, whose
forbearance is remarkable, and whosÂ«
desire to pleass everybody amounts <o
enthusiasm, asserts that the utterance oS
a forged telegram is a dishonorable ace.
Lynch will not scruple to use any sort
of tactics to catch the liquor dealers off
their guard, but his cunning will not pro
cure the indorsement which he is schem
ing to obtain. This subject is already sec
tied eo far as Wells is concerned, for that
candidate is not on the list of those to
be considered. The Society for the Pro
tection and Care of Aged and Indiscreet
Talkers may indorse Mr. Wells and re
ceive a testimonial from Mr. Cobb at the
Grand Hotel,, but Indorsements elsewhere
will be few and far between. ;
Lynch's official position does not dis
turb the liquor men, as they know that
he will be removed from office in Decem
ber next. \u25a0 â¢ Â«
Dr. -C. F.' Buckles', a stickler for royal
ty, a subject of King Edward the Sev
enth and a standing candidate for direc
tor of the Hibernia Bank, is meddling in
affairs that do not concern the King. Dr.
Buckley, whose character as a man and
whose attainments as a physician are
not questioned, in the local campaign ad
vises the people against supporting Mr.
Tobin. Dr. Buckley is not registered. He
is not a citizen of this country. He has
no aspiration for American citizenship.
He dwells in this country because he can
do better here than in England. Perhaps
he wants to be near the Hibernia Bank
in case his long cherished wish to be a
director of that institution should be
gratified. Before projecting himself any
further into the politics of San Francisco
he should advise with the British Consul
and get the consent of his Majesty, King
Edward, to chip In.
Tobin Easily Wins a Bet.
Mr. Tobin seems to be good enough for
the people, of San Francisco. The Native
Sons entertain a high regard for him. He
was born in California and loves the land
of his birth. It is true that he is not as
old as Mr. Wells or as handsome as Mr.
Schmitz. but he has a mind of his own
and expresses It in a style that wins the
high regard of his fellow citizens. He
may never be able to match Mr. Schmitz
for pulchritude or acquire Mr. Wells' fa
cility for wobbling, but he is in tha
race for Mayor, with every prospect of
success. Dr. Buckley should, gaze* on Asa
R. Wells and see the danger of talking
through one's hat. Cobb cannot protect
everybody from the indiscretion of rush
ing Into print. All his time is now taken
up in guarding against further outbreak
on the part of Mr. Wells. . .
Tobin is surely a winner. He won a bet
so readily at the Palace Grill yesterday
that those who believe In auguries are
convinced that he will win all alongr.
He happened to meet a representative of
the Examiner, to whom he remarked that
he did not make the statement in the Pal
ace barber shop that the Toblns would
not patronize the establishment if the Ex
aminer was not excluded. 1 The newspaper
man offered to bet $25 to $5 that the paper
published just what Mr. Tobin said. The
wager was accepted and the principals
went to the barber shop for a decision.
When the facts were elicited the Exam
iner man said: "Mr. Tobin, I will send
you my check for twenty-five dollars."
Mr. Tobin replied: "Never mind the
check. Give it to charity."

Simon yesterday urocured a warrant for the

TOR LOSS OF PROPERTY
Claims Relatives Encroached on His
Lot in Erecting a Fence Fre-
quently Blown Down.
The trial of the suit instituted by Henry
Wegener to quiet title to a lot at the cor-
ner of Hyde and Lombard streets was
heard in Judge Graham's court yesterday.
The defendants are Frederick Wegener,
Mrs. Silva and Mrs. Leisen, a brother and
â¢two sisters of the plaintiff. The property
in question consists of two lots, which
â¢were deeded to them by their father,
\u25a0Christian Wegener, in 1873.
Henry Wegener testified yesterday that
his brother and sisters were in possession
of ten feet of his property and that .they
got it with the aid of the high winds that
blow in that neighborhood. He said that
the fence dividing the property was fre-
quently blown down and that every time
It was rebuilt the defendants built it on
â¢his territory, until it stood ten feet from
its original position.
