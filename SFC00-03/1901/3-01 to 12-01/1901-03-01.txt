LOOKOUT ELLINGSON MAKES
CONFESSION THAT HE HEARD
RIO'S SIGNAL OF DISTRESS
The San Francisco Call.
MARK ELLINGSON. lookout of
the Fort Point Life-saving Sta
tion, confessed yesterday to his
superior officer. Captain Jo
seph Hodgson, that on the fatal morn-
Ing when the steamshio Rio de Janeiro
-went on the rocks he (Elllngson) had
heard the startling distress whistles of
the doomed ship and had taken no notice
Â©f them. Captain Hodgson, on hearing
the awful admission, took the wretched
tpeaker by the throat and almost stran
gled the breath from his body.
The information that the Rio de Janeiro
had sounded prolonged whistles of dis
tress and that the signals had been heard
by the life-saving lookout has been sub
stantiated in every detail, both by the evi
dence of Â¦witnesses before the official in
vestigators of the disaster and by the con
fession of Mark Elllngson. From the time
the first boatload of survivors of the Rio
came ashore to tell of the tragedy at the
Fort Point rocks until yesterday morning
E'.lir.gson has stoutly maintained that he
rever heard the slightest sound, on last
Friday morning, which would have caused
him to think that a Fhlp was In distress
close to- where he was on duty. His su
perior officers defended him and abus*
was heaped on those who had charged
EMr.gson with criminal neglect of duty.
Clairas He H^ard No thing-.
Captain Hodgson of the Fort Point
Iife-eavlttg Station has since Friday ;
begged and pleaded with Elllngson to tc'.l
him the truth- To all auestlocs put to
him El'.lr.gson had but one answer: "I
heard nothing out cf the ordinary while
I was on duty on Friday morning." â¢
On Wednesday Ellingson's comrades no
ticed a change in his demeancr. Elllngson
was moody and kept to himself. He did
rot Join in the conversation of the hardy
men who are ready to go out on the angry
Beas en the most stormy nJght to try and
save life. Ellinsoon's comrades thought
he was. brooding over the fact that for
tune had failed to help him In the mls
eion cf saving some of the souls on board
the Rio.
a. m. yesterday he sought Captain Hodg
son and eald, "Captain, I have something
to say to you." Ellingson then unfolded
the grave story of his action at the time
of the wreck of the Rio.
"I told you a lie. captain." faltered El
lingson. "I told a lie when I said I did not
hear the Rlo's whistles."
Captain Hodgson sprang on the man
who trembled before him and, grasping
him by the throat, choked him until he
was livid In the face.
"You cowardly dog, you cowardly dog!"
exclaimed the captain as he threw Elling
son to the floor. '
Heard the Long Whlstle3.
When released. Ellingson told his story
in a few words.
"I heard the long whistles, but I did not
pay much attention to them. I cannot
tell you why â I don't know."
Before Captain Hodgson had time to
realize fully the awful Importance of the
confession, Â¦ Ellingson had passed out of
his presence and made his escape from the
life-saving station.
Captain Hodgson reported the confes
sion to his men and Ellingson might have
felt the weight of their wrath If they
could have laid their hands on him.
The life-savers were wild with anger.
J3ut for the neglect of Ellingson . they
could have upheld their reputation and
saved many lives when the Rio de Ja
neiro took her final plunge.
The confession was reported by Captain
Hodgson to Major Blakeney. who Is su
perintendent of the Twelfth Life-saving
District, which Includes California.
Major Blakeney Astounded.
Major Blakeney, who had defended the
honor of the men under him, was as
tounded by the news brought to him by
Captain Hodgson. For the honor of the
life-saving service. Major Blakeney hopes
that it will be proven at an investigation
that Ellingson was blameless.
Ellingson has been In the life-saving
service for six years. He had the repu-

VIOLATES ORDERS
Witnesses Give Conflicting Testimony
Before United States Inspec
tors Who Are Investigat
ing Cause of Wreck.
The official Investigation of the wreck
of the steamship Rio de Janeiro was com
menced yesterday by O. F. Bolles and J.
K. Bulger. United States Local Inspectors
of Steam and Sail Vessels.
The Investigation was held at the office
of the inspectors in the Appraiser's build
ing. The witnesses under examination
were Second Officer Coghlan, Chief Engi
neer P. H. Herlihy and Pilot Frederick
Jordan. .... '-~"J.
The testimony was mainly on the lines
followed by these v/ltnesses before the
Coroner's Jury, but it was technical to a
degree. Chief Engineer Herlihy, after a
rigid examination, was forced to admit
that he had violated the orders of th6
Pacific Mail Company by being in his
room on the Rio de Janeiro when she
started to come into port last Friday
morning, the orders requiring him to be
at the engines. Engineer Herlihy and In
spector Bulger entered into a hot argu
ment as to a statement which Bulger
claimed was made to him last Monday by
Herlihy, but which -Â»vas denied by the en
gineer.
There Is a remarkable" discrepancy be
tween the testimony of Graham Coghlan,
second officer of the Rio de Janeiro, and
that given by Pilot Jordan as to the
Pilot Jordan, who testified after Cogh
lan, swore that he Bet the course at NE.
course eteered when the Rio de Janeiro
started from her, anchorago on Friday
until Bhe struck. Coghlan v.-as on j the
bridge of the ship and testified yesterday
that from the time the vessel started un
til she ran on the rocks the course
given- to him by Pilot Jordan was north
east, and that it was not changed until
the moment the ship struck, when Jor
dan called out to alter the course to NE.
% N., then immediately changing It to
NE. by N.
tation of being a fearless man In the face
of danger. Two years ago he resigned
from the service and went to Alaska. . He
returned to this city a few months ago
and Captain Hodgson recommended him
for reinstatement in the life-saving ser
vice. Ellingson, who passed the civil ser
vice examination, was again placed on
active duty early In January. He is about
36 years old and unmarried.
Ellingson has been suspended from duty,
as under civil service he cannot be dis
missed without an Investigation.' -

to the publicity of the divorce he did not
want to cause any more talk than .was
necessary and suggested that we marry,

to him, but he finally persuaded me to
agree to the contract marriage.' He drew
up the paper and we signed it in the pres

189L He kept the contract, .saying that
he would place it in the safe of his office.
A short time afterward his second oldest
daughter, Dora, commenced legal pro
ceedings against him, making serious al
legations. The suit was tried ' before
Judge Sweensy and resulted In a dis
agreement of the Jury. It was afterward'
dismissed. While my husband has not
treated , me right, I believe that the suit
brought by his daughter was unjust, as
she afterward said that. she expected to
force her father toi' pay her several thou
sand dollars. 'After that we came to San

for city life and we went to Bakersfleld,

still partners; but have of late been de

After the paroxysm of srief had passed
clvil suit filed on Wednesday last in the
office of County Clerk Deane.
Attorney William D. Grady, who is rep
resenting Mrs. Hewitt, filed the suit for
divorce on Wednesday on the grounds of
cruelty, desertion and failure to provide.
In the complaint " the allegation is mad-)
that the community property, consisting 1
of both real and personal property, is val
ued at $100,000 and Hewitt is asked to pay
,$250 a month alimony for the support' of
his wife during the pendency of the liti

Ing or having in their possession or under

Unfortunate Matrimonial Ventures.
The marriage of the plaintiff to Hewitt
was her third venture in the matrimonial
line. Two of her husbands are dead. Both
of them met violent deaths. â¢
"I seem to have been singularly unfor
tunate," tearfully said Mrs. Hewitt yes
terday. 4 '1 must have been born under an
unlucky star. My, flr6t husband s was
killed five days after our marriage. I
married G. W. Howell June 27. 1886, In
Benton County, Or. He was a woodsman.
He was cutting Â¦ a treo when It suddenly
toppled over and crushed him to death.
Exactly a week after our marriage I fol
lowed his body to the gravel I worked at
various employments after that. Af t*>r
two years and nine months of widowhood
I married Rudolph VoUroth. Our life was
a happy one.
"We had been married less than a year
and a half when we determined to leave
Oregon and make California our future
home. We were traveling over the moun
tains, when my second husband dropped
a revolver from his pocket. One of the
cartridges was accidentally exploded. The
bullet entered his hip and blood poisoning
set In, causing death. After burying him,
I proceeded to Redding, Shasta County,
where I met Hewitt. He was engaged In
business as".. a' searcher of titles. I I se
cured employment in his office as a copy
ist. He and, his wife, did not get along
happily, together. They had been married
eighteen years and nineteen children had
been born to them. All of 'the children
were, not living. If- 1. remember right
there were twelve of . them still living at
the time I .first met him. Mrs. Hewitt

BAKERSFIELD. Feb. 2S.â The news of
the divorce suit brouzht by Mrs. Mary
E. Hewitt against her husband. John B.
Hewitt, of the firm of Bender & Hewitt,
did not create any great surprise here.
The couple separated about two years
ago, Mrs. Hewitt going to San Francisco,
while her husband remained here to at
tend to his prosperous abstract business.
It is not positively known where' the chil
dren are. but there Is a general belief
that they are in Los Angeles and being
well looked after by their father. ThÂ»
fact that It was a contract marriage was
common gossip at the tSma Mrs. Hawiti
left here.
Among Bakersfleld Bssidents.
HEWITT IS WEALTHY.
Divorcs Suit Occasions . No Surprise
Hewitt has been married again. That
fact has been disclosed, by the records of
Alameda County. A license to marry
Irene Mabel Hedrlck was issued to him
June 20 last. The age of the bride la
given as 23 years and her residence De
lano, Kern County. They were married
the same day by Justice of the Peace
John W. Stetson. The certificate of mar
riage is on file In the Recorder's ofilce.
Residents of Bakersfleld variously esti
mate the value of Hewitt's estate. They
all agree, however, that through fortu
nate investments in oil lands he has
amassed a fortune much larger than that
given by his wife In her complaint.
Hewitt Has Another Wife.
"You will have to excuse me from an
swering that question." replied Grady.
"for, as I told you before. I do not wish
to discuss the litigation in any form,"

Cries Piteously for Her Babies.
"The proof? All the proof required will
be forthcoming at the proper time," re
plied Mrs.' Hewitt. "My husband dare not
deny our marriage. I never had the con
tract in my possession. It may be that he
destroyed it, but that it existed will be
shown in court. He will be put in a seri
ous position, for he Is, so I understand,

"Where are the children?" was asked.
"I would feel. easier if I knew," replied
Mrs. -Hewitt. "I have endeavored to find
them, but cannot' get any trace of them.
They are not in Bakersfield. Friends of
mine in Kern County have made inquiries
for me, but they are unable to learn any
thing -as to their whereabouts. I ap

Sick, weary, and tired as I am. I would go
to them. -You cannot understand how my
heart yearns for them. I must and I
will see them again."
"Have you proof of the contract mar
riage?" was asked.
Mrs. Hewitt continued her narrative. "It
was in August, 1892, when my first born.
Myrtle, was about five months old, that
Hewitt called me vile names and after
cursing me slapped me in the face. He
was infuriated and choked me until I be
came unconscious.' From "that time on he
continued his abuse. He struck me and
beat me and on one occasion dragged me
from the house. It was in February, 1890.
that we separated, lly husband accused
me of infidelity and drove me from our
home. Before driving me away he forced
me to sign a paper relinquishing all my
title to the community property for a con
sideration of 5250. He forbade me ever
returning to Bakersfleld. threatening that
he would have mo arrested and put me to
great trouble. He would not allow me tc
take the three children born to usâ Myrtle,
Gladys and Johnnie. Myrtle Is now aged
8. years, Gladys 6 and Johnnie 4."
Complications are said to be growing
and it is feared that the friendly arrange
ments of the boundary dispute cannot ba
made. The foreign Consuls here to-day
offered their services with their bubjects
to guard the city in case of necessity.
The patriotic sentiment is at the highest
pitch.

had not heeded them. After making the confession Ellingson left the life-saving station and
has not since been seen.
The investigation into the cause of the loss of the steamship commenced yesterday be
fore the United States Inspectors of Steam Vessels. Startling testimony was disclosed. Chief
Engineer Herlihy claimed that he heard no orders given to clear the ship or man the
boats when the Rio struck. Herlihy admitted that he was not at his post of duty when the ship
started to enter port, as required by the rules of the Mail Company. Pilot Jordan and Second
Officer Coghlan gave conflicting testimony as to the course steered by the Rio. The pilot also
claimed that he had requested a passenger to go to the bridge and tie down the cords of the
whistles some time after the vessel struck the rocks. This statement is disputed.

revenue cutter service. The friends of the
bill were very persistent and in face of
many difficulties hung on to It with bull
dog tenacity and finally forced the bill
into such a parliamentary situation that
it will be voted upon after five-minute de
bate to-rjorrow.

Conference Eeport on War Revenue
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2S.â The serenity
of to-day's proceedings in the Senate was
In sharp contrast with the tempestuous
discussion of yesterday. An Immense
aK.ount of business was disposed of and
not a point raised was sarply contro
verted. The river and harbor bill, carry
ing appropriations of more than $50,000,000.
was passed without a word of discussion,
and the Senate adopted the conference re
port on the war revenue- reduction meas
ure without dteturblng in the least tho
millpond smoothness of the proceedings.
"Final conference reports were made and
agreed to on the diplomatic and consular
and the agricultural appropriation bills,
and another conference on the postofflce
bill was ordered. Conference reports on
several other measures were agreed to
and several bills of a minor character
passed.
The last hour and a half of the session
was devoted to consideration of the sun
dry civil appropriation bill.
A resolution offered by Allen of Ne

His death was caused by pneu
monia. For several years past he had
been without the uscÂ» of his eyes and was
otherwise so feeble that he was unable to
leave his home. Up to the time of death
he was the nominal head of the law firm
of Evarts, Choate & Beaman, although

practice.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2S.â William M.
Evarts died at his home In this
city to-day.
Mr. Evarts was S3 years oM.

Harvard in 1&70. In the Cleveland-Blaine
campaign of 1SSI Mr. Evarts remained
stanch to .his Republican principles, and
in the oxcitinir canvass of .New York
State was one of the most prominent ora
tors. After Mr. Blaine's defeat, he an
nounced his Intention of entering the
arena for the United States Seimtorshlp
from New York State. â¢ . ' ' .
Evarts was considered one of the most
brilliant of orators, and his attendance
was much sought for in meetings of all
kinds. Many of his speeches have been
published, notably his eulogy on Chief
Justice Chase, centennial oration at Phil
adelphia, etc.
William Maxwell Evarts was born at
Boston. Mass., February 6. 1S13. his father
being Jeremiah Evarts. He was gradu
ated from Yale in 1S.T7 and was admitted

New York In 18S5-M.
; "When I went out yesterday,". the pilot
said to the Coroner and jury,- "I . found
the wreck in five minutes."
The hope that the .bodies in the'Rio's
hull would be speedily recovered was shat
tered yesterday by the report of the diver
who was sent down by the Pacific Mall
Company at the spot which Pilot Jordan
declared covered the sunken ship.
Â¦Whltelaw's wrecking barge was towed
out yesterday â¢ morning . to , Fort Point by
the tug : Mlllen Griffith. An attempt to
place the barge over the spot marked by
the pilot was unsuccessful. The hawser
between; the barge and the tug parted
twice ' and - the barge drifted a : considera
ble distance before the tugr caught up and
brought It back. Operations were sus
pended until :5 p. m., the barge Â¦ mean
while being anchored in a sheltered cove
inside the point.' - - <-* Â¦
When . the flood tide slackened. Diver
Consolation was felt when Pilot Jordan
stated at the Coroner's Inquest on Wed
nesday that he never had the slightest
doubt as to the exact location of the rock
on which the ship struck.
Uilll.
The wreck- of the steamship Rib de Ja
neiro and the bodies. of the scores of peo
ple in her shattered hull still lie unlocated
in the'watera of the Golden Gate.- "
cated by Pilot Jor
dan.
"I never heard any order to clear
ship," said Herlihy, "perhaps thafac
counts for the loss of so many lives.
From the time I left the captain on
Thursday night at 9 o'cLbck, I never
caw him again."
The evidence of Second Officer Coghlan
was that the ship had anchored in deep
water on the night she came close to
land and had started In a heavy fog tho
next morning to come into port. Coghlan
was most positive as to the. course indi
cated by Pilot Jordan, as it was Coghlan's
duty to transmit the pilot's directions to
the quartermaster at the wheel. lie also
testified that the lead was not used to
take soundings while coming in. Coghlan
also teatlficd that the entire crew re
sponded promptly to tjie call of the cap
tain to abandon -ship, and that there was
no confusion among the crew. He also
stated that the passengers were called
from iheir rooms to enter the boats. He
fixed the time from the striking until the
ship went down at twenty minutes.
Pilot Jordan gave practically thtf same
evidence as he did before the Coroner's
jury, except that it was in nautical terms
and went into degrees and points and di
rections ot wind. For the first time since
he landed on shore since the wreck he
stated yesterday how he had asked a pas
senger to tie the whistle cords down.
Chief Engineer Herlihy had- an uncom
fortable time while under examination in
that the same questions were piled on in
rapid order until he gave the required an
swer. He stated that the ship always car
ried 145 pounds of steam and never less.
"She had 145 pounds on the morning we
came in," said Herlihy.
"How do you know that?" replied In
spector Bulger; "you were not In the en
gine room when she started.
"But we never carried less than 145
pounds of steam," retorted Herlihy. |
"Did you not say to me last Monday
when you were in this office that the ship
did not have steam up when she started."
asked Bulger: "and you also said to me
that you 'hooked her on' while coming .
"I never said anything of the kind." re
plied Herlihy. -
"Yes, you did, and you know It." re
torted Bulger.
A lino of examination then followed by
Inspector Bulger to find out from Herlihy
why ho was not at the engines when the
Rio started to come Into port. Herlihy
tried to answer the questions by telling of
the trust he placed in his. assistants, but
Bulger fired the same question back at
the witness. Â¦ ' â¢ â¢ Â¦
Herlihy sat" many times that he was
present to F.pcak the truth and would do
so. and flna'.lv Bulger asked him if the
rules of the 'Pacific Mail Company did not
require chief engineers to be at their en
gines when a ship came into port.
Herlihy admitted that such a rule ex
isted, and then Bulger said to him:
Â¦ "Were you at your post when the Rio
started to ccmo in?" . â¢ - -
"I was not." replied Herlihy; "I was !n
my room." He was then allowed to leave
the witness stand..
The examination will be resumed to-day
at 1 d. m. Â¦ - - Â¦ - ' . . . - .

"I said to him," testified Jordan,
'â¢' 'You go on the bridge and tie the
cords of the whistle down,' and ha
did so."
Officer Coghlan, who was sitting near
Jordan, flushed to the roots of his hair
on hearing this remarkable statement.
Coghlan had testified that when the ship
struck Captain Ward had tied down one
whistle cord, and he (Coghlan) had fol
lowed the captain's example and tied tne
other whistle cord to the rail.
Chief Engineer Herlihy also made the
startling statement that he did not hear
a single order given to man the boats or
abandon the ship after she struck.
on starting and maintained It until he
was sure he was off Point Diablo, when
he changed it to NE. by N.
"I kept NE. by N.," said Jordan, "for
fully fifteen minutes and then hauled up
N.NE."
Pilot Jordan also claimed that when he
was helping people into the boats a pas
senger came up to him and asked if he
could be of any assistance. .

The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
turned over to thj clerk of the United
States Circuit Court yesterday $2271 65
wages due the white members of the
crew that were lost. Heirs and other ap
plicants for the same will be heard by
United States Circuit Judge Morrov at
9:30 o'clock every Saturday morning.
Resolutions defending the name anÂ«l
ability of the late Captain William Ward
of the Rio de Janeiro were passed yes
terday' by California Harbor No. 15 of
the American Association of Masters and
Pilots of Steam Vessels. "The resolutions
refer to the disaster of - last Friday
through which Captoln Ward lost Sis life
and express the regret of the, association
over -'the heavy mortality which followed
the loss of the ship. The public is asked
Vy the association not to pass ha'sty judg
ment on Captain Ward or be guided by
the statements of ' irresponsible or un
scrupulous persons who may haveyeasons
for casting blame for the loss of the Rio
de Janeiro on Captain Ward. The reso
lutions state that the captain was ham
pered by having a Chinese crew on his
ship.
' Tho directors of the Italian-American
Â¦Bank yesterday opened a fund for the
purpose of rewarding the Italian fisher
men who .saved many lives Â¦when the Rio
de Janeiro sank. Subscription lists will
,be sent to the various commercial bodies
and to the principal business men of San
Francisco. The following donations were
announced yesterday: Italian-American
Bank, $100; Mayor James D. Phelan, $100"
the Chinese Six Companies, ?200.
In addition to revrarding the fishermen
a fund will be started for the Fishermen's
Mutual Benevolent Association and gold
medals will also be given to the men who
saved life.

tourist who was among the saved has

Fishermen Who Saved Lives

PILOTS AND MASTERS
. DEFEND CAPTAIN WARD
Fund Is Opened to Reward Italian
The men , of the lifesaving- station at
Fort Point stated yesterday that on sev
eral occasions when they were watching
for bodies they have seen fishermen pick
up boxes and rifle them of their contents.
This statement is borne out by the fact
that a number of empty boxes which
have presumably come from the wreck
have been found along the beach.
During the afternoon the lookout at
the station saw what he thought -to be a
body floating in-the distance. A boat was
sent out. but before it reached the point
the cbject had been carried away by the
swift current.
The positive statements that the wreck
had been located prove to be erroneous
and the sepulcher of tne victims of last,
Friday's disaster is yet to be found.
The wreckers stated yesterday that If
the hull of the Rio is found it will only
be possible to work thirty minutes each
day, fifteen minutes at slack water of the
ebb tide and the -same period at slack of
the flood,. The current yesterday, ran from
four to seven" milps an hour.
When his helmet was taken off Cowl
wood reported that he had not seen a
sign of the wreck or a body. He sug
gested that he would go down again to
day and that the tug should tow him
around the spot where the Rio is sup
posett to be. The second descent was
made in more than 100 feet of water and
the diver bled from his ears on coming to
the surface.
Cowlwood descended to ihe bottom of the
bay where it was thought the Rio was.
He remained down (eight minutes and the
line showed. that he .was in six fathoms
of water. A second attempt was made
by the diver, and after twenty minutes
had elapsed those on the* barge and tug
were hopeful that he had located the
Wreck. Signals were sent down to him
on the lifeline, and as he failed to an
swer them It was tuougnt advisable to
haul him up". -The strong tide by this
time had set in and it was 'with difficulty
that those on the tug brought the diver
to the surface.

not be ascertained, but notwithstanding
some of the expressions contained in the
clauses of the constitution referring to re
lations between, the republic and thÂ«
United States which seem In conflict with
the propositions of this Government the
officials believe that an arrangement sat
isfactory to Cuba and to the United States
will be reached.
"Cuba will come around." was the
cheerful prediction made by Senator Platt.
Encouraging dispatches were received
to-day by Secretary Root from General
Wood. Governor of Cuba. Officials of the
War Department made the same predic
tion as did Senator Platt after he had
concluded his conference, apparently bas
ing their statements on special informa
tion.
Senator Platt of Connecticut and Sen
ator Spooner, after an hour's conference
late th's afternoon with Secretary of War
Root, both asserted -that there would be
no modification of the attitude of the
United States.

The following statement, made to-night

"The following telegram from Professor
Beligman, chairman of the committee of

aroused by false or misleading statements
as to the manner in which that commlttea
was constituted:

the reunion of friends and acquaintances
and the exchange of amenities. Mrs.
Brckman. Mrs. Gray and Miss Tufts re
ceived in a most RTacious manner and the
several hundred priests were made to feel
perfectly at home. The parlors were dec

scheme being- red. An orchestra dis

music for dancing, in which scores in
dulged. Refreshments were served the

Programme of Ceremonies.
Representatives of the various veteran
organizations who yesterday, through
General Daniel Sickles, declined to par
ticipate in the inaugural ceremonies be
cause they were dissatisfied with the place
assigned them In the parade, to-day de
clined an offer of Grand Marshal Francis
V. Greene to send a guard of honor of
twenty men from each local post to act
as an escort to the President. The veter
ans declined to have any part In the cere
monies unless this invitation were ex
tended to all members of veteran organ
izations, both local and visiting from
other cities.
Will. Attend.
Word was received at the Navy Depart
ment to-day that the training ship Dixie,
which is the flagrship of the fleet ordered
to take part in the Inauguration ceremo
nies, left Hampton "Roads this morning
for Alexandria. The old warship Hartford
also is within about the same distance
of the capital. These two vessels proba
bly will anchor off Alexandria to-night or
to-morrow morning. The Lancaster and
Topeka will undoubtedly reach the same
rendezvous Snturday. It has been de
cided at the Navy Department to keep
these vessels off Alexandria and to bring
their crews to this city on" ferry-boats.
The big monitor Puritan is at Washing
ton navy yard and will remain there until
after the inauguration.
Â¦ The Ninth Corps badge had its origin at
the battle of Roanoke Island in 1S61. in
which the prmy and navy joined forces In
the attack on the. enemy. It consists of a
gun and an anchor, crossed. The Eighth
Corps badke is a six-pointed star, and had
its origin in the divisions that originally
composed the corps.
The circular drive in front of the ex
ecutive mansion is included in this grand
scheme of illumination and a large force
of workmen has been engaged for two
weeks or more in the erection of pillars
of classic s shape at frequent intervals
along this drive. From these pillars novel
effects in electric illumination will be dis
played, and it is expected that the court
of honor will surpass in beauty anything
of the kind ever- attempted in this coun
try, and certainly in Washington.
Officers having the Government build
ings in charge are putting in place special
decorations in honor of the occasion.
Commander Baird, superintendent of the
State, War and Navy Department build
ings, has made an interesting contribu
tion to the special decorations. He has
placed electric lights forming the well
known badges of the Eighth and Ninth
Armv Corps as used during the war of
the liebellfon on the east pavilion of the
big granite trl-department building. Pres
ident MeKinley as a major in the army
served in both these corps during the-
Civil War.
Brilliant Night Spectacle.
Although Pennsylvania avenue will be
Illuminated during the three nights of
the 4th, 5th and cth of March as rarely
before. A special feature will be made of
that part extending from Fifteenth street
to Seventeenth, on the north front of the
White House grounds. This section has
been designated the "court of honor,"
and many special features of illumination
will be introduced.'
The general inaugural committee has
been hard, at work for more than a
month perfecting the arrangements, and
the spectacular features of the celebra
tion, as well as the general arrangements
for the occasion, will be on an exception
ally line scale. The reviewing stands
which have been erected at intervals
along Pennsylvania avenue from the foot
of the Capitol grounds to Seventeenth
street are uniform and unique in.
design, and the general decorations of the
city, especially along the line of the
parade, will be more lavish and artistic
in character than formerly.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â The prepara
tions for the Inauguration of President
McKlnley next Monday are rapidly near-
Ing completion, and unless all e>lgns fall
there will be a larger, crowd of strangers
present to witness the ceremonies than
Washington has seen in many years.

principles which weak stomachs lack, and
unless the deficiency of pepsin and dias-

cur* stomach trouble by the use of "ton-

Judge Coffey Finds Charges Mada

Are Unfounded.
Superior Judge Coffey has sustained the
will of the late .Olive Jana.Wickes, who
devised .her estate lo Dr. J. M. Shannon.
The wlli was contested by Mrs. Annette
P. Clarke, president of the King's Daugh
ters' Home, who accused Dr. Shannon of
exerting undue influence upon Mrs.
Wickes and with having kept her isolated
from her friends. Tho court found that
the charges were untrue. "Mrs. "Wickes had
no helm except? 1 her husband, who was
bedridden . at the home 1 of â¢ which Mr3."
Clarke is the head. .His wife, before mak
ing her will, had oraVision made for her
husband's care and burial when he should
die. He died six weeks after she passed
away. Before his death he made a will
devising his estate to Mrs. Clarke. Mrs.
Wickes made no beanest to her husband
because of his physical condition. Tht?
only witness upon the charee that Mrs.
\Vi<?kes.was of unsound mind was Mrs.
Clarke., Judge Coffey held ehe. wcs # not.
competent to testify upon that point. The
estate is valued at $13,000. 'Attorneys B.

Old Woman Charged by a Coroner's
Jury With Carelessness and
Incoxnpetency.
Mrs. Stelnle of 71J>>-2 Howard street was
censured yesterday by a Coroner's Jury
for Â¦ the death of Mrs. Ida Ferchland of
S45 l ,2 Third street. Mrs. Ferchland was a
healthy woman of 31 years, but shÂ© dlerX
on February 23 of blood poisoning after
Mrs. Steinle had performed the functions
of midwife. The testimony showed that
Mrs. Steinla had not adopted tha neces
sary aseptic precautions.
The jury rendered a verdict to the effect
that death had been caused "by blood
poisoning, due to the carelessness. Ignor
ance and incompetency of one -Mrs
Stelnle. midwife, residing at 719% Howard
street in the city of San Francisco."
JKrDWITE STEHTLE IS
BLAMED FOR A DEATH
No excuse, reasonable, imaginative or
chimerical, can be raised In Hawkins' be
half. At the time of his gross fistic mis
conduct he had several Bhadcs the bettsr
of the fight; He was leading and was out
pointing his adversary, who seemed, to be
making a waiting, defensive battle. Haw
kins' straight lefts and right crosses were
point-earner?, although they worked no
appreciable damage. In the seventh round,
after a mlx-up. McFadden shot his right
over on Hawkins' left eye. The blood
flowed like a torrent, blinding the tSan
Francisco fighter. Hut Hawkins kept
cool for a time, assuming the defensive.
Then he determined to end . matters by
fouling, which he did palpably and with
out cover. He hit MoFadden below the
belt. McFadden, angered by- these un
fair tacticB, rushed at Hawkins, deliver
ing left and right In auick succession.
Then it was that the local man lost all
control of himself and as he was backed

kicked at his antagonist. Both men then

yV drummed himself out of the

lL*^' of the seventh round of his fight
with George McFadden before
the Twentieth Century Athletic Club he
committed as palpable a foul as was ever
perpetrated within sight of a referee. Mc-
Fadden went to his cprner writhing In
pain. Then the eighth round came on and
with deliberate, intentional and mallcloui
foul fighting Hawkins tried to j cover a
redolent yellow streak and thus- lose his
fight. Referee Jack Welch, disgusted and
maddened, caught hold of Hawkins and
threw him to his corner, giving the fight
to McFadden.

thing happened that brought temporary
constellations to McFadden. Ha was
caught with a stiff right and set upon
the floor for several seconds. But hÂ« got
up and stayed with the game even from
tho aggressive side. For five rounds this
and take business went on, Gil
feather showing courage and skill all tha
time. McFadden boring without a stop.
The sixth and seventh rounds showed tha
same eager, earnest fighting and was a
division of honors. Then the end came.
Like a little red demon the Kid went at
Gllf^ather and by a series of punches on
Jaw and body finished the pecond ot hl3
undertakings.
Then came Kid McFadden's second
labor. Tommy Gilfeather, and It was a
surprise to all. Aggressive at the start,
the Kid was soon stopped by some clever
Sandwiched In between the Kid McFad
den bouts was a. contest between, Hugh.
Garrety and Joe Fields. Joseph Welch
was not well, said the doctor, so the
Welch-Fields contest was called off and
this other was substituted. They went
two rounds, and then Captain Wittman
called It off and the fight was awarded to
Fields, who had several opportunities dur
ing the two rounds for chest extension as
he walked around hla antagonist, supine
from stiff body punches. Â«
Kid. McFadden started out with George
Curran, the first of the two men he bar
gained to put into bitter slumber. Little
time was wasted by the Kid, whose right
was ever working on the body and head
of his antagonist. Curran went down
several times in the first round and It was
only his grit that saved him from , a
knockout. Refreshed but weakened, Cur
ran came to the center for the second
round only to receive a few more of those
warm corkscrews that the Kid had in
store. Referee Jack Welch stopped the
fight when Curran was In no condition to
go further, and thus the Aureole Kid won
hip first contest.
McFadcIen did not show ud much as a
fighter of much worth. The one damaging
effect that Hawkins showed was the bad
cut over the eye, which seemed to come
from the sharp point of his opponent's
elbow.
The preliminaries, two bouts In which
Kid McFadden participated and a filler
furnished the fistic amusement of the
evening. This was the Twentieth Century
Club's first venture and the Mechanics'
Pavilion, in which the fights were held,
was comfortably filled with patrons of the
sport.

Â» XOTHER track record went glim
i\ muring at Tanforan yesterday in
ZA\ the six and a half furlong race,
A )V which was captured by Toah,
Winnie O'Connor In the saddle.
O'Connor's race was a pretty one. He
waited to the stretch before he used his
horse at all. Seide started out In the lead,
with Raveling close behind. On the turn
Raveling passed to the drum major's po
sition and looked the winner, but Toah
came up from behind and finished a head
in adyance of Raveling, Â¦who ran a good,
strong race. The old track record was
1:21. Toah's performance cut a quarter
of a second off the mark.
The long-shot players feasted on three
winners out of the six yesterday. The
favorites were put under the sod in all
but the last race. . 'â¢â¢ .': ".
A small boy and a large man touted
Espirando in the first race, six furlongs,
celling*. There were seven in the field and
Espirando, with Tommy Burns in the
caddie, finished sixth. Kitty Kelly, the
longest shot In the bunch, Miller In the
pilot box. walked away with the money.
Our Lizzie had a strong following, but
got nothing better than the ehow, Kacetto
coming In for the place.
So fierce was tfie play in the second race
on Edgardo that the price dropped quick
ly from 3 to 1 to 8 to 5. Vohicer, who sold
at 12 to 1 at the close, won out, leading all
the way. Brownie Anderson and Donator
gave Vohicer a rub at the finish, but
could not offset the steady lead taken at
the start. Anderson took the place
money, Donator comlrig In for the show.
All kinds of stories floated about the
ring In the fourth race, seven furlongs.
Prejudice, ridden by Burns, was the fa
vorite, but there was a strong play on
Greatland, the 7 to 1 winner, ana Macy,
first time out. Prejudice played a leading
part until the paddock was reached, when
Greatland, with Charlie Thorpe at the
wheel, made a hypnotic pass or two- and
Prejudice went to sleep. Macy got the
show. :'." .â¢
Edlnborough, a prohibitive favorite in
the first race, led all of the five furlongs.
Santa Lucia came up strong in the early
stage of the race, but was beaten out by
Maclaren for the show.
The last race was the closest of the day,
Antagcne, the favorite, with O'Connor in
the saddle, taking first money. The finish
was as torrid as the weather, especially
for second and third places, Favorlto get
ting the place; and AJary's Garter the
show. When the numbers were displayed
at -first Alary'a Garter was made the
place winner, but the Judges ordered the
chance at once.

AT TANFORAN TRACK
NO prettier or more exciting flntsh
has been witnessed at Oakland
track this season than that
which marked the close of the
six furlong handicap yesterday,
when Sly, Frank Bell and Sad Sam
passed the wire heads apart in the order
named. Dan Hanlon's game and con
sistent mare had Bullman In the saddle,
and, carrying 118 pounds, equal weight
with Frank Bell, enjoyed a slight call
over Sad Sam In the betting. While 109
seemed a bit "weighty" for Maggie Da
vis, the little mare was bet on, and only
some tempestuous weather encountered
Just before striking port prevented her
from being a keen contender. As expect
ed. Sad Sam picked up Domlnlck and his
9S pounds and went out to make the run
ning. Within hailing distance Frank Bell
moved. along In second position, followed
by Maggie Davis and tsly, which order
was maintained to the stretch. Less than
an eighth from the stand both the favor
ite and Frank Bell drew up on nearly
equal terms with Sam, and the riders on
all three 'began riding with whip and
heels. In the deepest going, next the rail,
Sad Sam began tiring, Frank Bell was
sandwiched and Sly got the verdict by a
head. Gibraltar sulked with Henry
Shields, finishing last. As the track was
still fully four seconds slow the time,
l:15Vs, is somewhat misleading.
The summery weather drew out quite
a crowd of turf lovers and the books did
the largest business of the week. First
choices were In rare v fettle, capturing
every purse of the day, with a single ex
ception. Johnny Bullman piloted three
and Owen Mounce two winning horses.
In the introductory scramble Mike
Strauss mingled with much plainer com
pany than he was Introduced to first tlm?
out. He made a ragtime march of it at
odds of 3 to 1, beating Gold Baron and
Foul Play among others.
Caesar Youngs Daniel put Almoner
away by a head in the six furlong selling
run which followed.. Daniel closed an even
money chance and only Bullman'a splen
did, handling returned him winner after
Almoner had made, ail the running. Thi
ehow fell to Inclndiator.
Bullman next rode the Atkin & Lottridge
entry, Jarretlcre d'Or, In the two-year
old dash. The youngster ruled a pro
nounced favorite and, losing his field at
the Jump, ran in two lengths before Es
tado and Torso Maid.
Only four faced the bsrrier In the seven
furlong ran, decided under selling con
ditions. While St. Rica had auite a fol
lowing Dandy Jim. the favorite, shoul
dered his 116 pounds os easily as a long
shoreman would a sack of flour, finishing
first under restraint bv- three lengths.
Eight to S was the best price obtainable
about the winner. Dunfree "showed."
Socialist created much merriment by
decamping with the mile and a sixteenth
purse, quoted at 7 anJ 8 to 1. "Stump"
Golden made a sortie out in front with
the St. Carlo gelding and before any of
fhe others could reach the firing line ths
race was over. El Mido. the favorite, re
tired . early, which enabled Grand da
chem to get the place from Morlngu in a
drive.
Track Notes.
Stnrter Holtman nnea Dominlck $50 for
breaking through tho barrier with Sad
Sam. This is the first fine imposed on a
rider since Jake -took the position at
Oakland. He has been extremely lenient
and the boys should not complain.
Quite a "killing" was made on the win
of Kitty Kelly at Tanforan. Xot only
were several thousands of dollars removed
from the ring- but the mare Is reported to
i.ave been "plugged" m the Montana. anÂ«t
Hot Springs poolrooms.
Ten books cut in at Oakland and there
is plenty of money in the ring.
The Eastern employers of both .'-Henry
and Burns should feel pleased at the
magnificent work each is doing out here
aboard favorites. No other riders on
earth ever experienced the bad luck of
this pair.

Macbeth Explains.
Macbeth fald he was absent when An
<SersoÂ»i'F motion v.as adopted and that- he
h.nd fcfn misinformed as to the instruc
tions, lie had understood that the single
committee bill was the one wanted by the
Awembly. He promised, however, to re
port at once all bills in the possession of
rl?:- â¢â¢nrnmitteo.
Trcadwr 11 insisted that Macbeth explain
why hut one bill had been reported by the
committee.
Speaker Pendleton called Macbeth to
nrdfr, ttatlng that there was nothing in
what Johnson had eaid to Justify Mac Â¦
bath's rÂ« tort.
Speaking to a question of personal priv
ilege. Macbeth expressed resentment at
the criticism Implied in Anderson's mo
tion demanding immediate report of the
primary election bills. He said the com
mittee had been working faithfully and
conscientiously to frame a good primary
law, and had fejt no disposition to shut
out suggestions? or to smother features of
merit in the bills submitted to it. He be
lieved the committee had framed a work
able and constitutional measure, and it
remained for the Assembly and Senate to
say whether it should become a law.
Johnson, who had a bill in the commit
tee's hands. a?ked why all the bills had
not been reported, according to the Xa
pembly's Instruction. Macbeth retorted
with some heat that the work of the com
mittee was in the hands of the Assembly,
and if Johnson and others were not satis
fied with it thev could kill It.
CAT.T. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
JIEN-TO. Feb. 2Sâ The Assembly Commit
tee on Elections met with pointed rebuke
this morning when it evaded to a degree
the instruction cf the Assembly given
yesterday to report to-day all the primary
election bills under consideration by It.
When the committee report came in it
consisted only of the substitute bill pre
pared by the Joint committee, together
with the amendments agreed upon In
committee since the reference of the bill
to the committee.
"As it stands now we have pruned the
primary bill down to a pure primary law,
and all things not bearing directly on tho
subject we have taken out and put in
separate bills. It was feared that any
matter even slightly irrelevant would but
endanger the law, and the committee pre-
As the primary bill has come Into the
two houses it is stripped of everything
that would In any way endanger Its con
stitutionality. In speaking of the meas
ure this evening Senator Devlin said: â¢
I have written a similar letter to Mr. Mac
beth, chairman of the Assembly Committee on
Elections. Very truly yours.
- F. B. STRATTOX.
I think that we ought to endeavor In every
way- to escape from constitutional difficulties
and objections, and certainly It would be the
crentest of prudence and foresight to at once
? Uminate this defect.
I nm rlenrly of the opinion that you cannot
enlarge the scope of a measure by enlarging
the scone of the title of thÂ» bill. If these
matters relate to different subject* thÂ»n they
cannot b- Included in one bill Including more
Jlmn one subject In the title.
In any event the title ought to be changed
si that should these matters not be germane
V' thÂ« cubject of primary elections only the
Irrelevant ructions would be considered as sur
rlufaee and the rest- would 'â¢ be allowed to
stand.
In this regard I would refer you to tho case
o* Spier vs. Baker. 120 Cal.. 373. where the.
Fi!prÂ»-Tne Court. In deciding the primary elec
tion law of 1S57 unconstitutional, held that the
act embraced more than one eubject. It Is
tile the act was not declared unconstitutional
"*?" this ground, for the reason that It
T. i '.r at as to matters not embraced In the
title the act would fall, and as to such matters
not ra embraced there would be in fact no
legislation. The spirit, however, of that de

Stratton advised, this course, and he
made several suggestions in a letter to
the committee. All those clauses he ob

stands I am sure we have a primary law
that will stand all assaults. It provides
a general primary at which all parties

in thc negative.
The first bill received forty-eight ayes,

MENTO, Feb. 28.â The committee on
Ways and Means reported to-day a sub
stitute bill for Assembly bill 220, the
Redwood Park Commission bill presented
by the Semnervirens Club. It was re
ferred to the Committee on Introduction
of Bills and will undoubtedly be placed
on file, and so far as tho Assembly is con
cerned there Is an excellent prospect for
Its passage. Â¦â¢ '
The new bill. Assembly bill 872, makes
changes in the old bill mainly In makine
the $250,000 appropriation available in
$50,000 portions yearly, beginning on Janu
ary 1, 1902. the last $50,000 being available
on January J, 1906. -.-, None of the money
may be expended by the "California Red
wood Park Commission," created" by the
bill, until abstracts of titje have been
furnished for. the lands acquired.
The 'commission is empowered to select
the most available .-sites for redwood
parks, but it is anticipated that the Big
Basin in Santa Cruz County will be the
first selection in case the bill becomes a
law. Et&FltmSaB&fSggEBaiBgjm
Will Probably Be Reported
Favorably.

The State tax for all purposes will come
under the limit of 50 cents on the $100 In
dications are that the assessment roll will
bo unusually, large, and consequently the
tax rate will bo low.
The several district agricultural socle
tlps receive an aggregate appropriation of
$80,300.
The bill Is subject to amendment on the
floor of either house and may be ln
crpased or decreased before final passage.
The tax levy will be the next measure
of importance to com? from the Ways
and Means Committee. Chairman Fisk
said to-night that tho committee would
proceed at once to its final compiling.
This measure will contain the appropria
tions for tho school fund, interest and
sinking fund, etc. It will demand some
thing in tho 'Â¦sighborhood of $6,000,000.
It Is now f â¢eshadowed that a sum in
excess of $11,000,000 will be provided to
maintain the State government for the*
next two years, the amount to be raised
for the support of common Â¦ schools as
fixed by law.
-The State Agricultural- Society receives
$30,000', same amount as provided In< the
last general appropriation billi ; Â¦ ' \
.A saving of $40,000 is effected on clothing
for. the National Guard, as Â¦the'equip
ment:of the State soldiery- was provided
for two years ago. For summer encamp
ments of the guard $30,000 Is provided. :Â¦â¢'Â¦
The State makes a considerable sav
ing in the salary list of the Debris Com
mission. â¢- .. The commissioner ,' is allowed
$1200 instead of $7200 for the -â¢ two years,
and the clerk $600 Instead of $3000, as for
merly. These reductions meet the con

necessary by the State's growing needs,
the. bllj re-ally represents -a reduction in a
large number of items, to an amount
. much. In excess of $40.000.i The greatest
reduction is made in the appropriation

NOMINATIONâ B. H. H., Oakland. Cal.
In a fraternal organization it is custom
ary, but not necessary, to second the
nomination of a member for ah office. All
that is requisite is to place a member in
nomination so that the others may know
that he is a candidate. The seconding
of a nomination is merely complimentary.
THBRMOBAROMETBR-E., Oakland,
Cal. There is an Instrument used for
measuring altitudes according to the boil
ing point of water. It Is called thermo
barometer and consists of a metallic ves
sel for boiling water, fitted with very deli
cate thermometers,' graduated only from
80 to 100 degrees centigrade (176-212 F.), so
that each degree occupying considerable
space on the scale, even hundredths of a
degree may be noted; thus It is possible to
determino the altitude of a given place
within about ten feet.
TRANSPIRE AND PERSPIRE-^A. H.,
City. There is the same definition
for "transpire" as there Is for "perspire,",
namely, "to emit through the pores of the*
skin." In the ordinary use of the English
language the word "perspire" Is used -in
speaking of sweat, and "transpire;* -is
used to designate "come out'* or "become
known." The definition of "transpira
tion" is given as "the process of passing
off through the pores of the skin in the
form of vapor," Â» and that, of perspira
tion" as "evacuation of moisture through
the pores of the skin." .

OUR TRADE WITH RUSSIA.
rIGURES which have just been compiled by the
United States Bureau of Statistics show that the
evil of the tariff war which Russia has precipi
tated is by no means so serious as the general public
has feared. The exports of manufactured goods from
this country, so far from reaching the value of
$30,000,000, as has been asserted, have never reached
one-fourth of that sum. That much is made clear by
the official statistics not only of the United States
but of Russia.
According to the report of the bureau the Ameri
can exports of manufactures to Russia range in value
from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 annually. That is the
showing of figures obtained in this country. The
Russian official statistics show that our manufactured
exports to that country have averaged in value a little
over $4,000,000 a year since 1895, the earliest date at
which detailed figures of Russian imports are obtain
able. - ; ''Â£Â¦/'% > V 7: :?: r ;
The report of. the Bureau of Statistics goes on to
point out that the Russian statements of total imports
of goods of all classes originating in the United
States have never, save in two exceptional years,
shown as much as $30,000,000, and have averaged
since 1895 less than $25,000,000 per annum, and of
this sum more than three-quarters represents raw cot
ton, which is not affected by the recent order of th;
Russian Government. Much of the American cot
ton iriiported into Russia is bought in the markets cf
Europe, and thus, while represented in the Russian
importations as of American origin, does not show
in the export statements from the United States be
cause it is sent from this country direct to the great
cotton markets of Europe, Liverpool and Bremen,
and thence is distributed to -Russia and other interior
slates of Europe. , ,,. i
Owing to the fact that Russia obtains a large por
tion of her American cotton imports through other
countries tliere is a discrepancy in -the showing of
her trade statistics when compared with our own.
Our statistics show exports of. only about $10,000,000
in value to Russia', while the Russian figures show
imports of American goods to the value of $25,000,
000. The difference is due to the cotton shipped by
us to Great Britain or Germany, and thence taken tc
Russia, where it is credited to the United States.
.. Taking the whole subject into consideration, and
after a review of the official statistics of both coun
tries, the report says the value of the articles exported
from this country to Russia which have been made
subject to maximum duties by the. recent decree
English merchants r.re organizing, it is said, to op
pose what they fear ?.re the aggressions. of American
trade in their country. They evidently still believe
that curious notion of antiquated political economy
that in a bargain either the buyer or the seller must
lose.' They should not deprive themselves of an ad
vantage or us of a privilege. Â¦â¢â¢
THE ANTI-SUFFRAGIST.
\4 ANY a periodical has been started in the
/ \ United States for no other purpose than that
of supporting some ; particular movement.
Indeed spme of them have been designed to advance
what should be termed a "wiggle" rather than a
movement. Rarely, however, has any one thought
it worth while to launch a new publication merely
for the purpose of opposing something. It is there
fore worth noting that there has now been established
in New York. City a neat little four-paged periodical
bearing the title "Anti-Suffragist," which has for
its sole object a refutation of the arguments of the
advocates of the. enfranchisement of women.
The paper asserts that the woman suffrage move
ment received its first.impulse from what it calls "the
extravagant teachings" of Jean Jacques Rousseau,
and goes on t<? say: "It stands to-day at its first real
turning point. Its old leaders are reverting to some
of its earlier utterances and conduct. They have pub
lished a Bible that reveals the soul and intelligence of
the movement. Law and religion arc attacked, and
man is denominated woman's enemy. Another leader
in reverting to the early type is organizing a crusade
against a country that grants woman far more legal
privileges than man. The new leaders, meantime,
have thrown aside the old arguments and ceased to
utter the ringing war cries that confused the battle
and misled the unwary."
It is to meet the crisis of this turning point that the
new publication has entered the field of combat. It
gives fair notice that if a woman "believes in suffrage
it should receive her cid in the hour of its trial. If
she does not believe in suffrage she should give help
to those who are striving to lay to rest the haunting
presence of a figure that has loomed athwart the path

AGGRESSIVE Bryanites and timid Republicans
in. Congress have joined to prevent action on
the bill to restore our merchant marine. No
argument worthy of the name has been made against
that measure in the Senate or the opposition press.
A great deal of mouthing has been done by parties
Â¦who arc without knowledge of the features or inten
tiohs of the bill. \ . . :
It-is intended to extend to deep water ships the
same equalizing policy of protection which has so
immensely developed our lake and coast shipping.
The latter is exclusively American. No ship Hying
a foreign fi.ig is permitted in the coastwise trade.
Therefore the 25 per cent higher cost of building and
35 per cent higher cost of running an American ship
are\ not felt in that trade, since the cheaper built and
cheaper run foreign ships are not permitted to ente
it and compete with ours. Â¦ . ..
On deep water, however, we have to meet that
cheap competition, .and our competitors have the ships
and we have not, so they get the trade and we pay
them about $160,000,000 a yea.* for carrying our
products, which ought to be paid to our own people.
Senator Hanna lias been called on to make a state
ment, outside the Senate debate, giving the purpose
and effect of the bill. From his analysis of the meas
ure it is seen that its advantages are open to any
American ship that is in first-class condition; it does
not exclusively favor rny type of ship or route; slow
ships may under it compete with fast ships, and sin
gle ships with lines of ships; compensation is based
on size of ship and distance sailed, with extra for
steamships exceeding twelve knots. For every Amer
ican built ship now in commission its owner must
build a new tonnage equal to 25 per cent of the exist
ing ship within ten years. For every foreign built
ship admitted to American register equal new ton
nage must be built in the United States for its owner
within ten years. Foreign built ships admitted to
American register receive but half the compensation
given to American built ships. Not a dollar is paid
to any American citizen until he has constructed new
tonnage and put it in operation in deep water.
As foreign ship-owners now carry 92 per cent of
our foreign commerce it is only natural that they op
pose this measure, which will make us independent of
them in a few years. No one expects that they will
permit the passage of the bill if they can prevent it.
For their American allies an excuse equally innocent
cannot be given.
These American friends of the foreign ship builder
and owner pretend to believe that our merchant
marine may be revived by free ships â that is to say,
by permitting American citizens to buy cheaply built
foreign ships, put th:m under the American flag and
register and compete for deep water trade. This is a
vain scheme. The cost of running an American ship
due to our higher wage scale, is 35 per cent more
than the cost of running a foreign ship. That shuts us
out of the competition unless we reduce the pay of
American sailors to the foreign standard, or equalize
the cost of operating ships by the plan proposed in
this bill.
The nations vith which we must compete to re-'
cover the right to carry our own merchandise pay
their ships in bounties and- subsidies more than
?20.ooo,ooo a year, which they get in addition to the
advantage of cheaper construction and operation. So
Americans who attack this bill because it pays a
bounty arc the stanch' iriends of a foreign bounty svs
tem which has vfTcctually driven us of? the seas as "\yc
could have been swept therefrom by the great guns
of a hostile fleet directed tigainst our unarmed mer
chantmen.
The local Civil Service Commission and the Board
of Public Works have again been tearing the-repu
tations of one another to tatters. They have the ad
vantage not enjoyed by the public of knowing one
another intimately enough not to violate the truth.

It may be noted as an illustration of, the versatility
of the man that he was as skilled in making .after^
dinner speeches as in pleading great causes at the bar
or in the Senate. In those lighter moods he did not
have to rely upon teliing good stories f6r the enter
tainment of his audiences. His wit was bright and
facile. It never offended nor was it ever lacking, an:l
he was as ready with the polished and light repartee
and jest of the banquet-hall as with the learning or
the arguments required to meet opponents in court or
in the Senate. ;.. \ . :
In his later years he developed a strange belief that
exercise is unnecessary for the continuance of health
after reaching maturity. He frequently boasted that
he never took exercise, and it appears the boast was
justified by the facts. The result was that during his
later years he was virtually dead to the world while
men equally old and having no stronger constitution
to begin with continued to be active and vigorous,
doing useful work in the world. His life, therefore,
while full of noble lessons for all, contains one notable
warning. It is in vain that even the most robust
frame can neglect altogether the law of nature which
demands work for the body as well as for the mind. "
When the history of the United States for the period
that followed the clos.e of the Civil War down to the
end of the reconstruction of the Southern States
comes to be written Mr. Evarts will occupy a p-omi
nent place in its pages. He was a great lawyer, a pure
statesman and an unswerving patriot. His retirement
from public life at an age when his powers should
have been still useful to his country was a loss to the
nation, and now that he has gone the people may well
mourn his death. . ..

THE COST OF BAD ROADS
THE many road bills introduced into the Legis
lature at this session, while perhaps not credit
able to the local enterprise cf the sections from
which they come, are evidences of a feeling that bet
ter country roads are necessary.' , \' ;Â¦". " ;
The users of country roads, who must .haul : over
them. to and from market and ride over them pn.busiT.
sitss or pleasure, do not need to have p6irited' : out ; 'ti>'
them the inconvenience and annoyance, of bad. roads,:
but they are strangely oblivious to the waste and idss
which such roads cause- '.'.'. .Â¦ .
Eastern engineers have taken up this subject and, in
conjunction with the Agricultural Department, have
developed the economy of good roads. As a result of
these investigations we have very accurate estimates

â¢.rpad_.s^"-.-A.vhorse.wilI pull at a force of 100 pounds tn

: .The difference in cost per ton per mile is due tdythe.
difference in the quality of the roads, and therefpre in
the hauling power of the horse. The cost in. the.; Pi-,
cific States is 21 cents per ton per mile, while the rail-,
road charge is less than half a cent per ton per. mile. .-â¢
The average cost of the wagon-haul all over the
United States is 25 cents per ton per mile. V
. Now it would be hard to convince the rural pro
ducers that it costs them more to haul their produce
to the railroad than it does to ship it by rail. But on
the face of the facts is. the case. General Stone,
chief of the road bureau of the Agricultural Depart
ment, estimates the cost of hauling products over
rural highways to a railroad or point of water ship
ment to be 5946,000,000 per year.
That sum is greater than the operating expenses of
all the railroads in the United States. Â»
It is said that the common answer of farmers is that
it costs them nothing to haul their produce to market.
That idea stands in the way of a general movement in
favor of better roads. A6 well might a farmer say that
it costs him nothing to raise his crops. Until 'that
wrong idea is overcome, and men generally see not
only the superior convenience of good roads and the
greater pleasure in their use but also their great eco
nomy, we will not have a disposition of local districts
tc secure good road metal and put it down in the
most approved way. The rural land-owner will per
haps see the benefit to him of good roads if put in
another Way. They directly increase the value of his
land for precisely the same reasons that land" values
are advanced by the building of a new railroad to
which the lands have access.
General Stone estimates this increase in value on
the 640,000,000 acres of farm land in the United States
to be $5,120,000,000, which would build the best roads
to be had to serve every farm and economize the mar
keting of its crops. .... .. ':â¢ ; .' '
When the legislators can device an equitable sys
tem for division of the cost between the farm lands,
the county and the State, we will probably begin road
improvement. The State and county should share the

Â¦.â¢Â¦Â¦â¢The Â¦Â¦'-'nineteenth century opened .in
Franco upon a time of confusion ana

things in the new republic was running
smoothly, with no marked events of his
tory save the death of Washington, which
had temporarily dressed American women
in mourning. ribbons, lockets, gloves and
even gowns, for as long a time as court
mourning is worn in royal circles. .-â¢ â¢ _

simple lines, and less material was used
in the manufacture of gowns. The iskirt
was short, reaching in meager, clinging
folds only to the feet, with but slight

lightly were they -dressed;' In January,
1S07, the walking dresses were of whito
jaconet muslin or cambric, with browrÂ»
velvet or "orange blossom" shoes. Tho
"chemise shape" cowa was deemed the
most elesant. The hat was of straw or
tiger fur. Another favorite was a "Chi
nese robe" of India twlli or French dimity
trimmed with a border, of tambour, with
loose back or scalloped at the bottom.
White kid and rose-colored silk low shoes
were worn, with silver rosettes. Muffs
of white down and varievated sarsnet silk
"cottage cloaks" gave scant warmth. la
the spring pink muslin mantles appeared
and sarsnet tippets trimmed with Malines
lace; lilac and pea green were fashionable
colors. With ball gowns were worn white
satin shoes spotted with gold and gloves
trimmed with gold lace. Sleeves were
trimmed with ribbons put on corkscrew
fashion "to give an air of srenteel con
finement." Necklaces and bracelets of
white camellan were very fashionable. â¢
, The neck and portions of the arms were
Often left bare, even for outdoor wear,
hence a scarf or long shawl in winter be
came a grateful adjunct to the scanty
toilet.
Freezing for Fashion's Sake.
One old Iadv tells me she often went
to church In winter In a French ' cambric
grown with a shawl but a yard square as
the only outdoor covering. The wife of
Governor Joseph Trumbull remembered
riding from Mlddletown, Conn., to Berlin
in an open sleigh one bitter winter's night
In an organdy gown, low necked and
sleeveless, her only extra covering a cloth
cape without lining. That fell curse of
New Englandâ consumptionâ waa nour
ished and increased by this scanty dress.
A rhyme of the day begins: . ... . : ..; -,Â¦"-. .:
Â¦ '.Â¦Â¦'. Plump and rosy was my facÂ» '--'. / v â¢;â¢'â¢:
Â¦Â¦'.'.. ',"-â¢ And graceful was my form:- .-Â¦..; ".'Â¦
.-I Till fashion deemed it a Oltgnx* 'Â¦:.Â¦
: - ; To keep my body warm. .-Â¦â¢.Â¦ ,.
Very little "underclothing was worn; no
flannel save a rare flannel petticoat by
older women. Girls would rather die than
look stout. The scanty gowns were easily
made. A good dressmaker could make
three Blips a day and the gowns were
cheap. The wife of a commodore of thÂ»
United States navy had a gown that cost
$50, and a friend wrote that she could not
see how Abby (Mrs. Commodore) could
"justify such extravagance to her con
science." A wedding outfit could be
bought for $100, If it had no lace or shawls.
The opening and vast prosperity of our
East India trade had brought these
shawls and scarfs to our market, as it
had brought the beautiful muslins, cali
coes, dimities and lawns which still show
their place of birth In their names.
When Our Grandmothers "Went Shop
ping.
From newspaper advertisements of that
day we learn exactly what goods and
stuffs were imported and sold. In the
Columbian Centinel in February, 1S01, we
ilnd frequent notice of the sales In Boston
of muslins, muslinets, muslin garments of
various coiors; jaconet, tamboured, open
worked, fancy and sprigged; cambrics,
printed patches, China ribbons and tastes;
platillas, ginghams, Madras longcloths,
lappet muslins, gauzes, cypressâ all these
were thin stuffs and what would now be
unseasonable Roods for winter wear.
There were sold in the offices of mer
chants and i.n tho wharves hundreds of
different East Indian Btuffs. Nearly all
tre.ee of the signification of the names or
of the quality of these stuffs Is now lost
with the death of the old India merchants
who imported and sold them. We know
that among white cottons were Tandisan
rtas. Allebad, Cossas, : Tanda Mamoodies.
Gadjapoor Cossas, Chadpore Cossas,. Baf
tas. Altonah Sannas, Boran Coossahs,
Mow Sannahs, Cudor Cossahs. Among
colored stuffs, presumably of cotton, were
Cutters, Sooty Romalls. Blue Glllas, Blue
Guineea. Other stuffs advertised In
1S00 were Tanda Baftas, Jallapoor Sannas.
Dungree ' Stripes, Jallapoor Mamoodies,
Albad Baftas, Janna Cossahs, Omeitys,
Tockoys, Gude Cossahs. Barboom Gur
ras, Muchan Gungees, Adhungee Sannas,
Oudes, Chltabilly Baftas, Toolpore Cos
sas, Selinas, Janna Sulquachls. Kerboam
Surrah3, Slstersoys, Tookettys, Gugger
nauts, Penasprys. Jugedahs.Carlapahatya,
Seelsackers. I The last named we still
have â seersuckers â the others are lost In
the' dust of...- past decades. Other femi
nine fancies were musin shawls, tambour
ed and open- worked; purple chintz and
Rutland net gauze shawls, pagoda-top
parasols with honeycomb fringes; elastic
wire and horse hair jrlove ties. These
glove ties or glove tighteners were a de
vice to hold the long gloves up at the el
bows. â¢ â¢ Â¦
A pelisse- was.'the warmest outer gar
ment.. If.it were of dark cloth It waa
brightened with gold clasps and lace.
Pelisses of scarlet, pink, flame color and
green were worn. When cloth was an
nounced for gowns in 1S28 a writer In the
I^ady's Mazagine urges the readers never
to wear them indoors, as they "were not
a fireside costume."

Mrs. AlpJionsine MfGrcw Ti-iH novr se
cure the tSOOt insurance money that was
<2ue her from the Mutual Life Insurance
Corhpiiry cf New York. At her husband's
death the Insurance company refused to

that previous to his death the husband
l.a.l secured a divorce from her in Hono
lulu on statutory jrrounds. The Supreme

r> turr.ed to the iplands in the latter part
â¢ â¢i D< ci-ir.ber of the samo year. McGrew
v.;'s ;n a very IVeblo mental condition
Iroxn softening of the brain.
When they reached Honolulu the hus
band and wife were mt-t by a man named
Carter, Â¦who had been appointed guardian
"i the husband. Carter treated Mrs. Me-
Grew with little consideration. He would
Dot permit her to occupy her former rcsi
ilence. and he took th<? c-nfeebled husband
and placed him in a hospital away from
ib< Borrowing: wife. Carter then brought
fuit Jur <1iv<irro on statutory grounds and
rhe hu^l)aiid .secured a decree. Mrs Mc
<irow jicd to California with her little
boy, fÂ«arir.R that Carter would attempt
Lo take the child from nor.
Tb. ro i? a statute of Hawaii which de
clare* "that when a divorce is decrÂ«Â»ed for
Infidelity or other offense amounting
thereto of the wife tho husband shall
hoM ber personal estate forever." it was
upon this rtatute th^t tho insurance eom

The following telegram was sent to both

San Francisco has become a great sta
tion on the highway to the Orient, and
the future of this city and of the State
of California depends, in a great measure,
upon Asiatic trade. For this reason it is
considered that a representative from this
State at so important a post as that at
Hongkong would materially benefit the
commercial .interests and enterprise of
this section,;. . Â¦ .
A meeting of the presidents of the com
mercial bodies of San Francisco for the
purpose of taking measures to secure the
appointment of a Californian to. the office
of Consul General at Hongkong, now va
cant through the death of Rounsevelle
Wildman, was held yesterday afternoon

decided that the commercial bodies shall
act as a unit In the selection of a candi

There was weeping and Wailing: and
g:;a?h:r.s of teeth from one end of the
water front to the other yesterday. The
Ji^r.)or Commissioners held an executive
tcssion early iu the day ajid cailed all the
i;ea<ls of <iÂ«-partments before them. Econ
omy was the cry, and when the ILStOf
names had been eone ever twenty-threo
incnwere out of a job. They were em-
I io>es of the belt railroad, carpenters,
jilumbers, painters and men employed in
Keeping the streets In repair. By this re-
Guctlon in the working force about 12000

The necessarx permission for the Iron
worka to build a drydock on the 150-foot
t..p was, granted at a special meeting
hold by the Harbor Commission veÂ«ter
ca;- altcrnoon. ../Â¦Â¦..
To obviate any difficulties that might
have hereafter arisen in tho matter the
Jiarbor Commissioners gave the gas com
pany rermiÂ£Mo;i to extend its wnarf out
Jrom nÂ»tj to aw feet. This plan proved sat
isfactory to both companies, Inasmuch as
the Hisdon improvement will be built out
*t right angles from its property and the
two companies will practically have a
jo:rt whiirl".
The original contention of the gas com
pajiy was that If the Rlsdon people got
the extension the gas company would be
unable to land ships at its own wharf, as
the vessels when docked extended out
and took In s. portion of the lil) feet upon
i* hie 11 it is proposed to build the new

An amJcable arrangrerrient has been
reachtd between the HlPdon . Iron- 'Worka
and the San Francisco Gas Company
whereby the iron works people obtain

Â¦rggy^ To all whom It may concern:
f "V In December, 1S39, I was talc-
'&{Â£ 3 *n sick with Black Typhoid
fLj, 9 Fever, the most virulent type
\&^i known' to medical Â»ciencc I
had hemorrhages, both r.a.ial
timgmjS*3m and Intestinal, eight of ths
VfriA f* f VV\v latter (icourrir? In one day.
â¢â¢*Â»Â«i*JBiÂ». Dr. Wong Woo, the- amlnent
Chinese physician, was caUed. and with onÂ«
dose of hta tea stopped the flow oC blood, there-
by saving my life, as I had been given up by
my white physician, as .well as by all my
friends. Was unconscious four weeks, but by Dr.
Wong Wco's wonderful Iktll he saved my life
from this most fatal of all fevers. Although I
was confined to my bed three months, was
ablÂ« to resume my vocation In six months
from the time I went to bed. and now I
weigh 202 pounds, more than I had ever at-
tained previously. I would cheerfully recom-
mend Dr. Wong Woo to any one In need of a
flrst-vlass physician for any cause whatsoever.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28.â James H. Ty
nan, who a few days since applied, to the
Superior Court to have his adoption of
Grace Bailey Bet aside in order that he
might marry the girl, had his wish grant
ed this morning. Judge AllÂ«>n said the
proceeding was unusual, but the Supreme
Court having held that adoption is but a
contract, it could be annulled like any
other contract on petition of the inter
ested parties. He questioned the girl as
to whether she was acting under con
straint in the matter, and upon her nega
tive answer dissolved the contract of
adoption and left the adopted daughter
free to marry her foster father.

PRICE ON THE HEAD OF

SAN JOSE, Feb. 23.-Frederlck Be?e
row, who killed Josenh Cech and. August
Berger at the brewers' picnic here last
July, took the witness stand in his own
behalf to-day. He related the history of
the case and maintained he only killed the
men In self-defense and when he thought
his life was in danger. He made a good
impression. Begerow stated that when* he
started to leave the park with George
Schmidt, whom he ha-J placed under ar
rest, Cech and Berger followed him.
They demanded the prisoner's release and
when he refused they struck him. A club
ho drew was knocked from his hand anil
Berger and Cech both struck him. The
prisoner was taken away and the two
men kept on attacking the Constable.
Begerow's face was cut and bruised and
finally he drew his pistol and commanded
Cech and Berger to stand back. They
renewed their threats to kill the officer
and Begerow then shot Into the air as a
warning. Being closely pressed he shot
both men dead.
Leo Maloney, a 15-year-old bpy, sub
stantiated this testimony of Besrerow.
This closed the defense and argument
was then commenced. Attorney Part
ridge, special counsel for the prosecution,
made the opening argument.-
Asserts That He Killed Berger and
Cech in Self-Defense.

The directors of the Market-street Rail
way Company held a meeting yesterday
afternoon. It was decided to extend the
McAllister-street road from I Seventh ave
nue to Tenth avenue. Work on this ex
tension will be started at once.
The advisability of changing the steam
dummy line from Central avenue to the
Cliff. -Into'. an' electric . system was dis
cussed, and it Is more than possible, that
at: the next meeting an order will be made
for the work to be commenced.' The Jack
eon-street line, from Devlsadero street to
Central avenue, will also soon be turned
into an electric line, as will the Sacra
mento-street line from Fillmore to Cen
tral avenue.
The matter of allowing school children
to ride for half fare was also brought up
at the meeting, but no definite conclusion
was arrived at. '

Fire rJcpartments. The proprietor of the
establishment, who is. scarcely more than
a boy in years, claims that burglars, after
having robbed him of money arid goods,
a:pplled ; the. torch .to his establishment-
The detectives who have been detailed on
the case hesitate In accepting this theory;
and point to some circumstances which
wiil require considerable explanation. ,

he was awakened by the sound . ot police
Â¦whistle's. He Immediately sought to open
a door leading to the store, but foTind.it
barred. Thinking that burglars werÂ© in
the place and were holding the door he
rushed, back-to his room and secured a
revolver with which he fired :twb "shots
through thedbbr.. When this did not have
the desired effect he jumped, through : a
