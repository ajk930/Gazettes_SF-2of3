In the afternoon the sturdy and rough
riding polo players attracted a large at
tendance to the track, the infield skirting
the green field being crowded with equip
ages of every description, bearing loads of
gayly attired ladies and their escorts.
Owing to some petty grievances among
the players the ensembles of the two op
posing teams was changed and rechanged,
until it was -nearly 4 o'clock before Ref
eree "Bob" Betiner, tossedthe ball on the
green and called play. Then the make-up
was as follows:.. .
Â¦In the continuation of the golf tourna

meets C. E.Orr, G. B.Hubbard meets R;

day 2 up, Orr beat O'Connor 4 up and 2 to
play, Hubbard beat Brown 1 up, Fitzgerald
beat- Atherton Folger 1 up,- Sears beat- Kellogg
2 up, Stratton beat Crosby 1 up.
On the side of the Blues, Walter
Hobart appeared to have lost none of his
old time dash or. skill,* but the ponies he
bestrode, while gamy, were not the
trained veterans . of former Â¦ seasons.
Charley Dunphy, an adept at. blocking
â¢and utterly fearless when it came to
''taking any old chance, seemed; to have
lost his hitting eye. Frank Carolan, well
mounted, of course, showed great im
provement in his work and .was always
on the firing line. * -Â¦ _ \
'Â¦ Neither team scored during the first
period. . In the second Joe Tobin acci
dentally" knocked a goal 'for the Blues
and later in a srjlendid sally, after losing
the |unch, Walter Hobart - rolled Â¦ up
.handicap of two points. That this was a
hasty and ill-advised, concession on the
part of Captain Hobart after-events
proved. If- the lazily played first period
could .'be excepted, the game was replete
with fast-maneuvers and remarkably
dashing displays of skill and horseman

feverish excitement. After playing- "the

HIS RESIGNATION
It does not look as* If the United States was
trying to quench the flumes, but. on the con
trary, as it that country were trying- to epread
them as much as possible, in order, in any
case, to have a pretext for military Interven
tion.
If the Americans Intend ' nothing: more than
to protect the reasonable Interests of- citizens
of the United States, they should rejoice at
the presence of the European vessels havlne
the same object in view. Even the co-operation
of various powers would be possible.- But the
very fact that the United States Minister at
Caracas undertook the business of the congeed
Colombian Minister was calculated to arouse
distrust of the intentions of the Washington
Government, which thereby got control of
ex'ents at one of the most Important points.
Referring to the report circulated In

possibly somewhat sooner, as she is much
faster. No orders have yet been issued to
any other vessels to reinforce the Machias
at Colon, but instructions were sent to
Admiral HIgginson to-day directing him
to take the entire North Atlantic squad

This will place an adequate force at the
disposal of the department and will en
able as many ships as may be necessary

Neither the State Department nor any
of the legations here has received con

is probably based upon the operations of
some small guerrilla band in the neigh

operations in any way or that they are
on a Bcale entitling them to serious con

Soo Art was captured in this city and
the suspicion was strong in the mind of
his captor that he had just come across
the border from Mexico. He was supplied
with a certificate of registration, but the
description did not tally with his appear
ance. Before Commissioner Knoles he
claimed that he lived in Los 'Angeles and
had come down to collect an amount owed
to him by another Chinese. He said that
he had lived in Los Angeles for many
years, yet he could not- tell the name cf
a street or a person in that city.
The order for Soo's release comes from
the United States District Attorney, who
holds that he cannot be imprisoned pend
ing such an appeal. He was released
â¢without bonds and did not stop to get the
registration certificate, which the Col
lector still holds.

NEGRO MURDERER LYNCHED
BY A MOB OF MISSOURIANS
Tot>in-Hobart Feud Again. â¢;
The blazing up once more of the ; old
Tobin-Hobart feud .came, dangerously
near postponing the polo game. Cyril To
bin declared early .in the afternoon that
he would not play with Walter Hobart.
There was a gathering of the clans and
several secret meetings, but by .the .time
that Driscoll's tailor forwarded him suit
able toga in which to take his place in
the tournament, and which' would make
the theft of his wardrobe not too' appar-.
cnt. the Tobin-Hobart matter .'.was all
patched up- and Tobin lined up .with the
Burlingame team, riding to honors under
Captain Driscoll. . .
Young Joe Tobin has managed to creato
a sensation here and arouse to a becom
ing degree of excitement the members of
the exclusive set whose scutcheon sets
forth, "You can't astonish us." Joe ap-.
peared on the polo field this afternoon in
the very latest English rig. His white
ducks looked exactly like everybody else's
white ducks; so did his boots and glossy
leather leggins. But it was his headgear
that made the admiring onlookers elong
ate their necks. On Joe's shapely cran
ium was perched the very latest fhingâ
the English polo cap.
An English polo cap is a very impres
sive affair and most becoming, at least it
is^to Joe. To the unitiated it looks mo3t
like a smoking cap. . It is of a rich blue
cloth, elaborately embroidered in gold,
and kept in place by means of an elastic
worn behind his e"3rrs. Joe wears it rak
ishly tipped over his right ear.
EL MONTE, Aug. 19.â It is " the
quality that counts at Del Monte
these days and not the quantity.
The qualifying for the golf tour
nament began this morning, the
opening of the polo tournament was In
full swing this afternoon, and, excepting
the players, of course, the golf and polo
enthusiasts have not turned out strong
enough, to alarm anyone. At the golf
links this morning there was scarcely
more than a handful of smart maids and
matrons to cheer the players on. It was
different with. the polo game in the after
noon; everybody turned out, but every
body all told did not make much or a
showing. This must not be construed to
mean that golf is losing hold as a fash
ionable game. Everybody plays golf and
talks golf, but everybody is not many.
There is an irate millionaire here who de
clares the next time he comes to the
hotel he is going to wear baggy trousers
and golf cap and buckle on. his. back, in
a good, stout leather bag, all "the pic
turesque golf implements.
"Then I'll be shown some considera
tion," he eays. "That's the only way to
do it. It's the brassy .that counts these
days, not your bank account." â¢
â¢ They are putting 1 all the blame for the
slim attendance on the. weather, and cer
tainly it has been cold and dismal enough
to warrant all the mean things that can
be said. Those who watched the polo
game this afternoon came away, with
blue noses and chilled hands, and the
restoring warmth of the and
the cheering fire in the great hall of the
hotel were gratefully accepted. Those who
paid attention to the golf game \ were
treated to a few surprises, first and fore
most of which was thatthe home teams
did not make the showing it was
hoped they would; and, last but not least,
that the men from the southland - were
more than apt to carry off the honors.

DEL MONTE, Aug. lÂ£*-Although: the
weather was bleak and dreary and 'an
overhanging fog threatened to envelop the
links, an eager, expectant throng of golf
ers early gathered to participate in the
men's amateur competition for the Del
Monte cup. Of the original twenty-one
entries sixteen easily qualified- in. the
opening play, at eighteen holes.- The score
was as follows: â¢ Â¦ '. â¢ ;
Fred S. Strattoiv, 78; E. Folgen 89; A. Fol

After the! noori hour, the "drawing hav r '
Ing taken place, match play^was resumed.
Of course, the hepes of. the north 'reposed
in the prowess of the coast champion,: the
Oakland golfer.- Ernest Folger, and his
overthrow .at the hands of the Southern
Calif ornian. E.. D. Silent, who won by a
score of .three up and .two. to play, was
decidedly the sensation of .the' day. The
campfires of the southern contingent burn
brightly to-night, for in the event of .the
downfall of Golfer Silent, C. E. RJaud and
C. E. Orr are said. to be drivers and put
ters far above the ordinary. After the
game Champion Folger told friends that
he had no apologies to make.
"I met a better player," said he. His
conqueror, Mr. Silent, Is especially strong
at putting, although a stranger to the
links,- and to this branch of the Scottish
game Folger attributed his defeat more
than to anything else.
-With such a formidable and worthy
competitor as Mr. Folger dethroned, Fred
S Stratton, the attorney, considered* by
many, the coming player- of the year, is
now picked to give the south country folk
a rub. Cool, possessed of splendid judg
ment and unruffled by the presence of
many spectators, .he is looked upon as the.
dark horse of the tournament.
The wounded men were at once taken to
the post hospital, where proper medical
attention could be given.
Private King died to-day. Private Mur
ray Sykes of New York City is expected
to die at any moment.
Private Watson, killed to-day, is from
Waco,>Tex.
Unless unexpected complications set in
the remainder of the men will recover,
but it will be necessary to remove the
light eye of Sergeant Dennis Mahoney.
Notwithstanding the accident to-day the
battery will go out for target practice in
the morning as usual.
Recruit Lloyd, who recently joined the
battery from Jackson, Tenn., had his left
forearm blown oft" and right eye badly
burned.
Sergeant Dennis . Mahoney, a native of
Boston, was hit in the mouth with a frag
ment of shell and lost several teeth.
Private Murray Sikes had a portion of
his skull torn and right eye badly injured.
Charles Duncan was badly bruised about
the head and blinded in both eyes. He
is from near Wichita.
Henry Logsdon is of London, Ky. His
body is badly hurt and he may go blind
from powder burns.'
Private John King had both arms torn
off and lost both eyes. He is from New
Jersey.
The big siege battery of four guns has
been on the target range north of this
city since "Wednesday of last week. This
morning the usual practice was in pro
gress. The 107-pound, shell had been put
into the third section gun and Private
Watson was' in the act of â¢ramming the
shell home when there was a terrific-ex
plosion and the headless body of Watson
was seen standing perfectly erect for al
most fifteen seconds, when it moved as
if to Etep, and then fell, alighting on the
back and shoulders toward the gun. '
Watson has a father in Texas and a
brother and eister in South Carolina and
enlisted in Savannah, Ga. .Â¦â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦

and Just then Dr. Phillips of Seattle
came up and grasped the same piece. It
was only a frail support at best and Phil

ing just seen his wife and daughter drawn
to their doom in a whirlpool formed by
the sinking â¢ of the ' ship. Another man
was observed struggling in the water and
the end of the wreckage was passed to
Â¦him. He was one of the oilers and -his
name was Burke. Thus there were three
men clinging to one frail piece of wreck
age. " Â¦ ' Â¦
Suddenly the fog. , which had wrapped
all in obscurity, lifted and Mr. Brownlee
discovered a quantity of wreckage not far
away. He succeeded In securing enough
for a small raft. "By this time his legs
were so numb with cold that he could
rot move them and he was! compelled. to
rub and. punch, them persistently to re
store " circulation. He firsts hauled Dr.
Phillips aboard and i. after much exertion
succeeded In reviving him. The two then
hauled' Burke- aboard, but the unfortu
nate inan was too far gone and, murmur
ing something about_belng cold, . expired
on the raft. ' . - , .
. More wreckage was secured and the di
mensions of the raft increased. The two
men realized 'that unless, they reached
shore or were picked up speedily it would
be all overwith them. . They commenced
paddling in what they took to be the di
rection of the shore.
â¢Finally, having -been in the water for
about an hour, they were hailed by Pur
ser .Bishop and a boatload of rescuers.
They did not at- once go to the shore.but
continued to row ' back and forth i in -â¢ the
vicinity of the wreck, picking up here and
there a body or rescuing some benumbed
person clinging desperately to portions of
wreckage. ;. The boat was soon filled with

was out of the water' and consequently
could not work. He rushed : to the deck
and explained the situation to ; the cap

six in number, and the life rafts, launched.
This was done very successfully under the
direction of Captain Harris, formerly of

Captain Foote just as. he -left his room.
Captain Foote Inquired If the steamer was

would have been saved, with" the possible

Andrew Keating and his two sons. Arthur
and Julius, of Los Angelas. The crew, on
the. other hand, behaved splendidly, and
looked to the safety of the passengers.
After the beats had been launched the
crew turned its attention to the rafts, but
thess were also rushed and after they had
been launched, some of the seamen had
to swim for wreckage, as there were too
many, on the rafts. Le Blank believes the
vessel sank In twenty-three fathoms and
that the boiler did not explode, but that
the woodwork was carried away by the

was a passenger on the steamer .Queen,
saw Dr. Phillips of Seattle at Juneau. Dr..
Phillips told him that he had lost his wife
and child. The doctorÂ»insisted that no one
called at his room, but he felt the sudden
stoppage, and Fays that his wife told him
to- get up and sec what the cause of 'it
was. He demurred at first, but. hearing
people moving on the deck he got up and
told his wife to dress immediately. When
they emerged from their room the steam
er was' sinking, and before they ! could
Jump from the deck his wife and child
were caught in the suction of one of the
ventilators and drawn down. Dr. Phillips
â¢was also drawn into the ventilator, but
was caught by the head af the top and
Â¦escaped being drawn down to death.. His
eye was severely cut by the ventilator. He
went down with the steamer, but caught
hold of some wreckage, from which he
was afterward rescued. "When rescued'.he
called for his wife and child, and a man
brought the body of his little girl to him.
He was left at Juneau. refusing to leave
until his wife's body was found. " ''
Sam Starten of Winnipeg also dropped a
satchel laden with ?4000 in gold and a
friend lost his portmanteau with $3000 in
gold in it and escaped to tell the story,
Â¦while one man who had just come out of
the Klondike, -vhose name was Blumauer,
is reported to have taken his portmanteau
from the care of the purser. Mr. Bishop,
and with'the grip containing dust amount

hands jumped from the sinking steamer to
the boat close by. Failing to reach the
boat he went down, together with his
treasure, to rise no more. "... '"%
the lifeboat he was afraid to throw his
satchel of gold down from the deck into
the boat before steadying down into a
place, for fear that the weight of the gold
would stave a nole through the bottom of
the lifeboat and thus cause the loss of the
lives of those in the boat, as veil as his
own chances ->( safety. He concluded to
abandon his gold, and dropping the satch

"All that Tighe told me was printed in
the papers last week, and there was noth
ing aside from this. The Chicago mill men
xvho remained at work are now no longer
members of tiie organization. Thev are
rot entitled to a trial and will have 'none.
They are at liberty to act as they see fit
now. b'jt if they go out they will do so
on their own responsibility. "We will do
nothing about the matter from this time.
On the whole, the strike is going on very
we!!. We are petting out more men every
f!ay and will continue to do so. The fight
Is hflr-ily bpgun yet. There will be plenty
of trouble for vhe tru.-t before long if they
k*ep on in their present course. There
has been ro effort on any one's part to
ward pftaee, anj ther** will be none on our
part again. A>- to the situation in Du
r\v.e?nÂ». all tfiat I can say is that there
has been no strike ordered in that mill.
I Paid lspt week that Â¦when tve were ready
that mill would be attended to."
Assistant Secretary M. F. Tighe re
turned from the West to-day and was
r-ios^ted for several hours with President
fchaffer. He was given a very enthusi
astic reception by his associates, and re
turns a stronger figure in the organization
ihan -when he departed. Discussing his
report Shaffer said:
The greatest fight in this district is for
mastery at the Duquesne mills of the Car
regie company. Both sides are working
secretly, the Amalgamated Association to
rxtend its organization and strength
smong the workers, and the steel com
pany to block any plan to get the men
rut. Neither side has shown its strength
yet. and it is impossible to get any line
on the ultimate result. The claims pre
viously made on either side are conflict
ing. The Amalgamated organizers assert
that they have secured a strong position
Jri the property and that when the word
If given it will bo shut down. The man
cgers of the mills admit that the strikers
havÂ©- some friends in the mills, but ex
pres-s absolute confidence In their ability
â¢to keep the entire plant in operation. Coal
and iron police carefully gruard the prop
erty, admitting none except emploves. and
they ir. turn are watched by secret pickets
cf the strikers.
riTTSBURG. Aug. 19.- The United
Ftates Steel Corporation made a series of
pains toÂ«<IÂ£y in the restoration of proper
ties crippled by the strike of the Amalga
mated Association and its sympathizers.
The steel mills at Monessen after a long
period of Inactivity were partly put in
motion by strike-breakers gathered in
fome of the Southern States; two more
mills in the Pamter plant were also start
ed up, and another large mill at the Clark
property was operated for the first time.
There was some disorder in the streets of
Moncssen during the day, but the local
police never lost control of the demon
strative crowds, and there was no serious
trouble. The reopening of the Monessen
r-ill is believed to be the first of a series
<^f aggressive moves on the part of the
steel corporation. Preparations are known
to be in progress for reopening the Star
tin mills in this city and for increasing
the force at the Lindsay & McCutcheon
mills. It is thought to be only a matter of
time before the strongholds of the strik
ers, like Newcastle. McKeesport, "Wheel
ing, Bellaire and Mingo Junction, will be
Invaded. The .strikers deny that any real
progress has been made at either Mones
fen or Painter's, and say that they are
not to be frightened Jby the burning of a
lot of coal and the mere operation of ma
chinery. They say that skilled men can
nct be secured outside of their ranks and
that none of their men are deserting, de
spite claims to the contrary. The man
egers of the Painter mills claim that part
of their two new crews is made up of old
rmploves who have come back to work.
At the Clark mill, where the ten-inch mill
was started for the first time to-day and
where everything except a small eight
inch mill is now being operated. It is said
that more skilled men are offering their
services than can be accommodated. Fifty
more were taken on there to-day, bring
ing the total force up to 600. It was
claimed that there were 200 men at work
la the Painter mills and that fifty of them
were skilled.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 19.â One of
the newest confidence games heard of by
the police for many a day was exposed
when J. Lopez Delara. a Spaniard, was
placed behind the bars at police head
quarters. The game failed in Kansas
City but it appears that it worked in San
Diego and San Francisco. Delara came
to Kansas City several months ago with
letters of recommendation from persons
of note in Mexico, which enabled him to
obtain a position as special instructor in
Spanish at the Central Business College.
He professed to be something of a the
osophist, and in this way met several the
osophists, among them Hubert S. Turner.
Shortly after becoming acquainted witn
Turner the Spaniard told him of a schema
whereby he said it was possible to maka
a very large amount of money. In 1896. ho
said, thouaards of cattle had been killed
in Cuba by the Spaniards. He had been a
major in the Spanish army and was onn
of a very few who knew what had be
come of the hides of these animals. All
or the hides, he declared, had been tanned
and then buried in secret places so that
after the war should be over the Span
iards would be able to recover them. Tur
ner was almost persuaded to invest in a
scheme to recover the hides but conclud
ed first to write Knoche. the head of thÂ»
universal Brotherhood in San Diego giv
ing- an outline of the tbeosophisfs schema
and a good description of the Spaniard.
In a few days he received a telegram
from Knocne which said that beyond a,
doubt Delara was the same man who un
der the name of Juan Martn had robbed
of members of the Washington
AIlen Grlfflth s was communicated
with and at once telegraphed Turner:
Beware of the Spaniard with the Cuban
proposition Both are frauds. Await my
letter. When it came it told how Grit
funs had been lured as far as New York
on the buried hides scheme. There r>e-
! a L a .f,Ji as ..^. a 25 lost hlm - Bfter borrow
ing $100 of Griffiths. To-day Delara was
arrested. If the California authorities do
not want him he will be prosecuted for
the attempt to swindle Turner.

SEATTLE, Aug. 19.â L. S."Robe, one of
the passengers on the Islander, returns
with one .of the most intelligent accounts
of the terrible disaster. "While he .would
not consent to be quoted on this branch
of the subject, his demeanor unmistak
ably indicates that he believes the offi
cers of the Islander were derelict in their
duty. Indeed, the charge is being more
or less freely made by the survivors that
officers of the Islander had been drinking
heavily. The vessel, too, had not aboard
the marine law requirement in the quan
tity and character of life-saving equip
ment. It is also remarked that, In view
of the statements that a dense fog pre
vailed, the vessel was running at full
speed. 'Robe said:
"It is known that an hour before the
departure of the Islander 107 tickets had
been sold. This did not include children in
arms. Including the crew, there were in
all 181 persons on board. There are 113
survivors, making sixty-eight people lost.
The vessel struck at 2:15 a. m., ten miles
north of Juneau, off Douglass Island,
and opposite the entrance to Taku Inlet,
whence the treacherous ice came. She
was then making 104 revolutions to the
minute, little short. of fifteen knots per
hour. "When she struck I looked out of
my cabin window, but it was densely
dark. When I came on deck I sought a
responsible officer, but none was in sight.
I passed to the forward part of the ves
sel, where I found crowds of passengers,
but no officers. â¢Â¦
"On the hurricane deck I found Captain
Foote in the stateroom back of the pilot
house. He made no reply to my inquiry
what was the matter. One boat was al
ready in the sea with but seven occu
pants, many crying from the vessel for it
to come back. Four men with myself se
cured a life raft. By this time I stood in
two feet of water, the ship sinking rapid
ly.: When the ship exploded, which, I
think, was due to compressed air, the
whole upper part of the vessel seemed- to
rise. We were an hour on the raft, which
was Â¦ leaky and unsafe, overturning ' sev
eraltimes. We were finally picked up by
a boat which made shore and returned to
rescue others. The tug Flossie came from
Treadwell and- delivered us at Juneau."
W. G. Preston and wife, who were in
the first dispatches yesterday reported
drowned, were the last to leave the ship.
"When seen to-night Preston said;
"The officers of the ship handled the
situation in: an extremely incompetent
manner. No warning was - given to the
passengers in their staterooms and . after
they had come on deck of their own ac
cord they were assured that there was no
danger. This, the fact
that the ship sank within twenty min
utes. I A notable exception to the conduct
of the majority of the officers was that
of First : Officer Neroutsos. He was on
deck and gave able assistance to the pas
sengers." _ '-Â¦
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 19.â Lemuel A. Wy

of age and the girl 18 the license was re
fused Wyman and Miss Sweet started
off on wheels for Oakland. To-day the
girl's father notified the officers that it
was a case of elopement. \

BEAR OUT TALE
OF DRUNKENNESS
One of the best known of thos,e who met
theif doom was Dr. John Duncan of Vic
toria, who was Just ' completing a trip, to
Dawson, where he had -gone on a com
bined business and pleasure expedition.
His brother, Dr. George Duncan, has been
in Dawson some time and the trip was
undertaken partly for the purpose of vis
iting him. Another brother, Rev. W. 1^.
Duncan, resides at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.
According to the stories told by some
of the passengers the proportion of women
saved was' small. "When the survivors
were brought ashore some ; of 'them ; were
so numb and disheartened and had so lit
tle life left in them that they begged to
be left alone or to, their death.* Â¦Â¦Â¦
The case of Mrs. Ross is a peculiarly
sad one. She left, Victoria a short time
ago to jbln her husband, who was recent
ly appointed Governor of .the Yukon Ter
ritory. Only a few days ago she left her
parents in this city, Mr. and Mrs. John
Mackay, with whom she had been visiting
for a few months, to take up her residence
in the . Yukon Territory, and a letter re
ceived a few days ago told of her plans
for the future. It was for the purpose
of carrying out these plans that she was
on her way to Victoria, it being her.in
tention to purchase furniture and furnish
ings for the new home of the Governor.
She left five of her children in Dawson,
but brought the youngest, an infant, with
her, together with a niece, the daughter
of her brother living in Dawson.
chief engineer landed and . walked to the
mines. He told his story to the-manager,
who immediately dispatched two small
steamers to the scene. -
I By the time he had returned, the chief
said, the little steamer Flossie had al
ready loaded up with the bodies of the
dead and with this grewsome cargo was
about to start for Juneau. He boarded
the steamer and arrived safely at the
Alaskan town.-
N. A. Belcourt, M. P., and G. C. Ray of
Ottawa were traveling companions on a
trip to Dawson. Mr. Belcourt said, the
steamer was running at full speed and
while possibly no fog had been encoun
tered up to or immediately preceding the
collision a dense fog' prevailed when the
accident occurred. At first' Mr. Belcourt
did not think anything very serious had
occurred and as the boat appeared to be
keeping on its way he thought of again
retiring to bed, from which he had arisen
when the shock was felt. Presently he
heard a commotion among the passengers
and felt a bumping motion of the steamer.
On trying to open his stateroom door he
was unable to do so. Mr. Ray tried" and
was also unsuccessful. The concussion
had evidently jammed the framework of
the cabin, whlc-h caught the doors like! a
vise. Mr. Belcourt and Mr. Ray got out
of the window. The former returned to
procure a life preserver, but failing to
find one immediately got out again, and,,
getting up on the railing of the steamer,
jumped to a boat that he saw below. He
was about the last man to leave the
steamer and not more than. a few min
utes elapsed from the time he got out of
his cabin first until he made his leap in
the dark. Fortunately he alighted on the
shoulders of one of the passengers In the
last boat to leave the steamer. Messrs.
Belcourt and Ray were in the small boat
one hour and a half before reaching
shore, which was, however, not more than
a mile away, but owing to the fog could
not be made out.
Continued From Page Three.
Survivors on the Queen say the shock
was so severe that many were thrown
from their berths and wild , excitement
prevailed. ."Word was soon passed that the
vessel was doomed and a general scramble
ror the lifeboats ensued, many jumping
overboard and attempting to swim to the
shore, the distance being short. In the
scramble to get into the boats many were
hurled headlong into the chilly water,
wnlcn, according to passengers arriving
from the scene, seemed alive .with human
beings. Before all the passengers had left
the vessel she gave a lunge and went
down, bow first. It is known that sixty
seven lives were lost. It will be some
time before, the names of all. can be
definitely learned, as the purser lost his
passenger list.
The death of Captain Foote was very
pathetic. He remained on the bridge until
the steamer was foundering. When the
vessel commenced to sink and it was seen
that no earthly, expedient could avail, the
captain is said to have jumped upon the
life raft which was already taxed for ac
commodation. . Realizing that his weight
would work havoc there he exclaimed:
I see there are too many here, so good
bv, boys,' ., and swam away. He was
shortly afterward seen to sink.
. On Sunday evening a concert was given
on the steamer Queen for Â¦ the wreck
sufferers and-$333 was ' raised, which was
given into the care of "United States Con
sul A'. J. Smith , of Victoria, who was a
passenger on: the Queen.
PORT TOWNSEND. Aug. 19-The
steamer Queen has just arrived from the
north bringing .additional particulars of
the wrecking of the steamer Islander. The
Islander sailed from Skagway on August
14. When nearing the southwest end of
Douglass Island at 2 a. m. on August 15
and running at full speed, she struck the
floating iceberg and in less than twenty
minutes went to the bottom of the deep
channel. The Islander had 108 passengers
and all of them .were In bed when the ship
struck. ' Â¦

home of his sister, near Carson.
City, from the effects of an operation per
formed some three months ago. He wasi
sent to the dry air of Nevada in the
hope that he would recuperate, but al
though every attention was given him. he
slowly passed away.
Kelly first came Into prominence as a
jockey in 1884. He had been around the
stables for many years before as exer
cise boy. He then entered the service of
Porter Ashe and became the jockey that
piloted the famous mare Geraldine to
many a well earned victory. As increas
ing years brought added weight he was
! forced to retire from the" saddle and be
come a trainer. Geraldine and other
horses of the Ashe stable were under his
care for a number of years and were well
taken care of.
Then came a split with the Ashe broth
ers and Kelly obtained possession of Ger
aldine, then stabled at the Bay District
track. He sold the handsome mare to
Thomas H. Williams" Jr.. but before the
delivery -had been made the Ashe broth
ers broke into the stable one night and
carried the mare off to their ranch at
Fresno. After considerable litigation and.
several changes of ownership, the marc
passed into the hands of A. B. Spreck
els, who was her owner when the mare
died about a year and a half ago.
After leaving Ashe's employ in 1893
! Kelly trained for the stable of Thomas
H. Williams Jr. His next engagement
was with John Humphreys, the book
maker, in whose employ he ,was for about
a year. His last employment was i with
Burns & Waterhouse, in whose Â¦ employ
he was up to the time that a series of
operations unfitted him for active work.
The last operation was performed thren

beyond recovery.

ding day was set for July 17 last, the
ceremony to take place in Sacramento.
It took some time to get the young lady
to agree to this plan. But. Love's logic is
irrisistible. and after a time she con
sented. Fred J. McWilli.'ims, a gentleman
who is himself no amateur in affairs of
the heart, was called In as best man, and
with Jackson acting as bridesmaid the
deed was done on May 12. 1900. /
"Why get her to come to town, see your
old friend Judge Kerrigan and the job is
done with no one the wiser."
"How?" inquired Houseworth.
'What was he to do? Unable to work
the problem out alone, he sought advice
of his friend "Johnny" Jackson, a son of
the late Collector of the Port. Now Mr.
Jackson is a past master in affairs of the
heart. He thought deeply for a long time,
then raising his head with a toss of tri
umph exclaimed: "I have it! Get mar
ried." Â¦
On the part of Houseworth the passion
was one of the tempestuous kind that will
brook of no delay. He had found the one
woman in the world to make him -happy
and ' he must ihave her.
Some two years ago Mrs. Houseworth,
as Miss Dorothy E. Kirk, was a pupil at
the State Normal School at San Jose. She
had promised her father , that she would
finish the course at that institution, and
found no difficulty in keeping her promise
until the manly form of Fred A. House
worth, assistant manager of the Penn Mu
tual Life Insurance Company, dawned
upon, and dazzled her sight. To see House
worth was Â»to love him; ,as for House
worth, he took one glance at Miss Kirk
and went out without a blow.
It may be stated that both Papa Kirk
and the hotel guests are somewhat mis
taken. Mr. and Mrs. Houseworth have
given both friends and relatives that
which is known, in the vernacular as the
"double cross," and instead of being bride
and groom are staid old married people,
who have seen the moon of matrimony
rise, quarter and fill many times since the
day they first promised to be everything
to each other. The story of their young
romance fs a story of two fond hearts
beating in unison and whose owners de
cided to join themselves, one to the other,
without posting the bulletins of their hap
piness on the beards for the daws to peck
at. â¢ .
When Papa Kirk; he who is known out
side the family circle as State Superin
tendent of Education Kirk, caresses the
head of his little daughter and asks her
how she is getting along in her new life
he thinks he is probing into the heart se
crets of one whose experience of domes
ticity is limited to a few short weeks.
When young Fred A. Houseworth crooks
the mighty right that in the old days used
to crush forever the ambitions of aspir
ants for amateur heavy-weight honors
and takes young Mrs. . Houseworth in to
dinner at the Colonial the other guests of
that exclusive hostelry gaze with interest
on a couple they imagine to be bride and
groom.
Ruhlin says Fltzsimmons landed on his
jaw time and again In the memorable
fistic battle and he thought he was kicked
by a mule. He gained two falls over Fitz-
Flmmons on the paxl, the first time in
twelve minutes and a second time in four
teen minutes.
George Siler of Chicago may referee the
big fight, although if the. bout is brought
oft before the San Francisco Athletic
Club Jack Walsh will be put forth by the
club, as he Is its official referee. And if
the contest is given to the Twentieth Cen
tury Club Manager Gleason will push the
claims of Phil Wand, its official referee.
The decision also may be made to-day.
Jeffries will arrive In this city this
morning from Harbin Springs, where he
has been resting for a month with his
brother and manager.
Ruhlin yesterday -discussed his two
meetings with Fitxsimmons. The first
trme he met the freckled blacksmith in
the prize-ring and was knocked out in
six rounds. Their second meeting was on
the wrestling mat last month. This time
the Akron giant -was victor.
When the principals meet this afternoon
it Is expected that they will sign articles
to contest for the heavy-weight cham
pionship of the world and flx a date for
the contest, with the understanding that
the fight shall go to the club offering the
highest bid.
Billy Madden, who looks after Ruhlln's
Interests, said yesterday that he was not
pledged to any club. He said he was will
ing to allow Ruhlin to battle before the
club offering the best terms. He called
attention to the fact that he had on one
occasion acceded an offer made by the
Twentieth Century Club of 65 per cent of
the gate money and $500 for expenses, but
the match fell through. Whether or not
he can get such good terms at this season
of the year and during a big strike re
mains to be seen.
Gus Ruhlin of Akron and James J.
Jeffries of Los Angeles will meet at Cor
bett's saloon at 2 o'clock this afternoon
and hare a heart to heart talk. Both pu-
FiliPts will be accompanied by their man
agers, who will do the haggling while the
principals size each other up. Manager
Cleason of the Twentieth Century Club
and Manager Alec Greggains of the San
Francisco Athletic Club may be present.
Each fight promoter is anxious to have
Ruhlin and Jeffries fight under the aus
pices of his club, and although they will
not bid for the bout until the principals
agree to fight, they will watch the pro
ceedings to-day with deep interest.
Preceding the race there was a 100-yard
handicap race for members of the club.
C. G. Rodgers won the final, heat, with R.
B. Cornell second. Rodgers was given a
handicap in the first h*>at of 30 seconds
and W. Young 22 seconds. Rodgers 1 time
was 1:26. The second heat brought out F.
C. Clough. 19 seconds: C. C. Clough, 19 sec
onds, and Alex Pape and R. B. Cornell,
scratch. Cornell and Pape qualified for the
final heat. In the final heat Cornell tried
hard to overtake Rodgers, but the dis
tance was too short and he could only
come in a close second. Tixne. l:26'/4.
The officials were: Starter. George
James: judges. J. A. Geddes, Wallace Tay
lor and S. J. Pembroke: timers. Phil Wand
and A. Brown; referee, John Hammer
smith; announcer. George Hensley.
H. A. Wideman, the champion short dis
tance swimmer of America, lowered his
own record for fifty yards last night by
swimming the distance at the Olympic
Club in 28 seconds, and defeated Scott
Leary, the club's young champion, by one
fifth of a, second. The race was exceed
ingly exciting and the spectators ', were in
doubt until it was finished. Wideman was
given hearty cheers by the members, but
sympathy was shown Leary. The latter
ewam with great swiftness, but his un
familiarity with the finer points of the
game lost him the race.
I Both men sprang into the water at the
sound of a pistol shot, but Leary had
Blightly the better of the start. The con
testants used the double overhanded
stroke and they made the water foam by
their exertions. Leary splashed consider
ably and this In a measure retarded his
speed. â¢ Wideman swam with a longer and
cleaner stroke and went through the
water like a fish. On the turn the men
were even. Wideman showed his, clever
ness at this juncture by getting a strong
impetus by pressing his feet against the
end of the tank and shot ahead 'of Leary.
The latter was unable to do likewise by
reason of his crippled leg, but he followed
swiftly in the wake of his opponent and
was only beaten by half a foot. The
timers' watches recorded 28 flat and this
record, when duly authenticated, will
stand as the American record for the dis
tance. To-morrow evening Wideman and
Leary will swim seventy-five yards and on
Friday evening will compete. in a 100-yard
contest. These races will be watched with
interest by the members of the club, who
have great faith in Leary. Many members
think that Leary could defeat Wideman
if the race was without a turn.
"The I report of. Admiral Walker was
about completed when I left and will soon
be in the hands of the department at
Washington. Of course it would not be
the proper thing for me to speak concern
ing its contents, but I can say that when
it is made public it will be found to con
tain much that will be of Interest to cit
izens of every class all over the country.
"Owing to the poor coffee crops that
have been produced this season the finan
cial condition of Nicaragua is not all that
could be wished. Gold is at an unusually
high premium. The usual rate is three
to one. That is one dollar in golÂ«3 is
worth three dollars in the currency of the
country. It has gone even higher than
that now and a gold dollar will brins a
premium of four hundred to four hun-lred
and fifty per cent."
"President Zelaya is one of the moat
progressive men in Central America. He
is a firm believer in the advantages of
education and under his administration
the public schools of Nicaragua have been
almost doubled in number.
"The citizens of Nicaragua appreciate
the advantages that will come to thtm
through the construction of the proposed
canal and are enthusiastically in favor of
It. President Zelaya, who occupies a slm
iiar position in Nicaraguan affairs that
Diaz does in Mexican, politics, having been
twice elected and being the only possible
candidate for the next term to come, is
a strong partisan of the canal movement.
Not only does he want to see the work
go through, but he" wants to see it con
trolled by the guns 'of America. He says
that the relations between Nicaragua and
this country are so close and so f rien-.lly
that it is as much a matter of moment
to his own people as to us to see the pro
posed waterway entirely in American
hands.
Mr. Donaldson was asked last night con
cerning the work done by the commission.
He seemed very sanguine concerning the
outcome of the canal. Though, owing to
his official position, he was not in a posi
tion to go Into details concerning the work
accomplished, he said that Admiral "Walk
er, president of the commission, was about
to hand in his report to the Government
and^that when the Washington officiate
saw fk to make public the contents of
the report it would be seen that mucn
had been accomplished toward furthering
the plans of those interested in seeing a
waterway across the isthmus which will
be under the control of Uncle Sam. In
speaking of the feeling of the people of
Nicaragua in the matter Mr. Donaldson
said:
Chester Donaldson, United States Con
sul at Managua, Nicaragua, -who is now
y ln this city on a vacation. Is at the Occi
dental. Accompanying Mr. Donaldson are
his wife and J. Fred Appleby, an - en
gineer in the employ of the isthmian com
mission.

Preston, Lloyd and Hubert Burnett, neg
lected lads from a large family residing
on Cinnabar street, entered the building
from the roof, climbed down to. the lower
floor and set fire to the structure In four
different places. They afterward made
STOOil their escape to a safe distance, there
to watch the conflagration.. Fortunately
the hostlers engaged in the care of the
horses in training in the park, saw the
reflection, sounded an alarm and a. bucket
brigade extinguished the fire. The boys
are only street arabs, none of them over
If years of age. The Sheriff brought them
to the jail this evening, but the Judge saw
no use in holding them and let them go.
Neither the pavilion nor the other prop-,
erty of the association around it is In
sured. Had the boys succeeded in starting
a quick blaze they could not have es
caped before they themselves had been
suffocated.

' Dunlap bid $250 each for three franchises
and $500 for the fourth, from San Jose to
San Mateo County. E. Myron Wolf of
San- Francisco bid, for two of the fran
chises $625 and $260, respectively, more
than Dunlap. while on the other two he
was much lower. Henry Newburg of San
Francisco bid 4V6 per cent of the earnings
of the road after fivÂ« years. In the face
of* the competing and higher bids the
award was made to the Gilroy man. This
brought on the. storm which may result in
tying up the; franchises for some time.
'Â¦Â¦ The roads '. for which Â¦ franchises are
asked will radiate from San Jose to all
the principal points in the county. All of
the bidders are agents and refuse to dis
close their backers.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 19.â After a somewhat
pyrotechnical session of the Board of Su
pervisors- this forenoon,; franchises cover-
Ins: more' than ninety miles of proposed
efcetric roads In this county were awarded
to;George T. Dunlap of Gilroy, over the
protests of two other bidders. The pro
ceedings were sensational from the fact
that,- where no opposition to Dunlap was
expected, 'two additional bidders were in
the field. Protests were filed and one: of
these bidders threatens indirectly to take
the affair into court at once, claiming
irregularity on the part of the members
of the board.

of the Oregonian. She was only 74 hours
getting through the Straits of Magellan

the first heavy weather was encountered.
Captain Lyons, who commands the Cali

ANTIOCH. Aug. 19.â At a meeting of
the Contra Costa Almond Growers' Asso
ciation only two San Francisco buyers
were present to bid for the crop, about
seventy tons. The bids were so far below
expectations that they were rejected, and
Baturday. August 31. -was set as the date
for the opening of new bids. Members of
the association believe San Francisco buy
ers have formed a combine and are mak
ing an effort to break up the association.
In consequence no better bids are expect
ed from local buyers, but it is hoped there
will be bids from Eastern buyers. Should
this not happen and the bids still be below
what the association deems fair It will
eend an agent East to dispose of the crop.

C, the largest corps In Minnesota, writes
from "The Landour," 9th and. Nlcollet,
Minneapolis, Minn., as follows:
"Please accept hearty thanks on
behalf of Peruna, that wonderful
medicine which raised me from a
sick bed and made a strong and well
woman of me in two weeks. I suf-
fered with bearing-down pains, back-
ache and continual headache, and
found no relief until I tried Peruna.
It cured me completely, and I feel as
young and well as when 18. I wish
every woman knew the merits of tho
medicine, and no home would be
without it"â Mrs. E. A. Crozier.
Mrs. Wm. Henderson, BorWac, N. C.
writes:
"I was troubled with very serious fe-
male weakness; had spells of flowing that
exhausted me so that I feared I would
lose- my mind. I suffered untold agony
â¢with my back, the pain extending down
my left leg. My pain was so severe that
I would have welcomed death at any mo-
mentâso no one need wonder that I rec-
ommend Peruna. ao highly, for it cured
me entirely of that: Not a. sign of pain
has returned, and that will soon be two
years now.
"I am grlad that there la a way I can
speak, trusting: that many a sufferer will
read my testimonial, and not only read,
but believe."â Mrs. Wm. Henderson.

The orator went on to say that in two-thirds of the
cases where prisoners had been taken from the hands
ot officers the capture was due to the fact that the
officers were not unwilling to give up the prisoner.
That willingness, he said, "is due to a false conviction
in the public mind that a Sheriff in resisting a mob
would be fighting not for the law but for some worth
less criminal." Against that opinion it is time for
the conscience of the South to rise in protest. "These
mob executions," he said, "are brutalizing our chil
dren, blunting our religion and undermining our civ
ilization. Can any one in the sound of my voice rise
up and say that this is not so? We are undermining
all noble ideals of duty and manhood. When we sur
render to any local public opinion, which . dom
inates in some places, that a Sheriff is not bound to
take any risks even to loss of life or limb in defense
of a prisoner, we abdicate all our past and. bow 7 down
and worship false and base standards of duty. Why
In response to that plea Mr. Jones said: "Why is
it that of all men on earth who are intrusted with
the keeping of others that a standard of honor must be
made for officers different from all others and that
he should take no risk. We see locomotive engineers
every day standing by the throttle and risking their
lives to save passengers; we have seen -captains of
ships standing on the bridge, that the women and
children might be saved and going down to death in
the waters. What man would have respect for Ala
bama State troops no matter against what- odds if
they allowed- a: mob to take a prisoner from them?
Such a standard as is claimed for Sheriffs has no rec
ognition in any laws of honor. It is a false standard
of duty â if I may be pardoned for saying it â a cow
ardly standard of duty."
OUT of the constitutional convention of-Ala
bama there has come one speech at least that
"reflects credit and even dignity upon its pro
ceedings. It is the speech made by Thomas G. Jones,
a former Governor of the State, in support of a clause
in the constitution providing that any Sheriff or other
officer of the law who fails to protect from a mob a
prisoner in his hands shall be summarily removed
from office. The opponents of the measure had
argued that it often happens officers cannot -protect
prisoners, and that for them to undertake to do so
would be to confront certain death.
THE - OFFICER AND THE LAW.
With, such an amount of money at their disposal
the promoters of the fair are pushing the work .vig
orously. They are determined to make a record for
themselves and for St. Louis by having a]l the build
ings ready in time to open the fair on the date fixed.
Should they succeed in doing so 'they will have ac
complished, a feat of genuine merit. Any kind of a
promoter can undertake a big thing, but it takes
a high order of executive ability, to carry it through
according to programme, and if St. Louis make a
success of the opening she will. have 'a right to crow
over Chicago. ,
The structures to be raised on, that large area are
to .be 'proportionately grand and vast. An ample
supply of money seems to be forthcoming to defray
the expense, cf the ambitious undertaking. It has
been recently, announced that appropriations ac
tually made from various sources amount to very
nearly $17,000,000, and that, without counting what
is^to be done by 'foreign Governments, there is up
ward of $3,ooo,doo more in sight. Of that sum there
came $5,000,000 from the National Government,
$5,000,000 from the city of St. Louis, and various cor
porations, companies and individuals have contrib
uted about $5,000,000 more. Several of the States
have already made appropriations for State exhibits.
Missouri leads with an appropriation of $1,000,000,
Illinois has appropriated $250,000, Kansas $75,000,
Colorado $50,000, and one or two other States have
appropriated amounts ranging from $25,000 up. â¢
The Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia covered
sixty acres, and^ that was the largest area that was
covered by any exposition that preceded it.' Each
one that followed, however, was upon a larger scale,
until Chicago erected her Columbian Exposition
upon a park of 666 acres, and now St. Louis sets
apart for the World's Fair of^903 a domain of nearly
1000 acres.
UNDISTURBED by the comparative public in
difference toward the Buffalo exposition,
which has thus far made that venture a finan
cial failure, the promoters of the St. Louis exposition
are going ahead upon a programme which if carried
out in its entirety will make that the largest and most
magnificent exposition ever held.
THE ST. LOUIS EXPOSITION.
John Alexander Dowie is evidently doomed to fail
ure in Chicago, for in a recent sermon in that city
he said: "You people who ate pork for dinner to
day, do you know what you took into your system?
I'll tell you. You got tuberculosis, cancer and
scrofula." How cart Chicago be expected to stand
that?
It is reported from England that at a recent meet
ing of the Devon and Somerset staghounds several
ladies took part in the hunt riding astride, and the
impression they made on society was so favorable
that some people believe the side-saddle is doomed.

The welfare and prosperity of the people south of
us react upon us, and will ever be cherished by us
wisely and, if need be, by a show of power.
The French newspapers are in quite a flurry about
our intentions and are horrified at the signs of our in
tention to grab South American territory, which they
pretend to see. We do not want any South American
territory, but if we did we would take it regardless
of any protest by France, whose attempt to get a
foothold in Mexico is not forgotten, and whose grab
game in Algiers, Madagascar and Cochin China has
disqualified her for rebuking her neighbors. When
national good faith is under discussion it will be re
membered that forger>' in the French treaty of i860
has caused all the bloodshed and horrors in China.
So the Paris press might well go and seek a more
composed frame of mind for the discussion of affairs
in the Western Hemisphere, where the. United States
has and will retain hegemony, in spite of any pro
test by France or by combined Europe.
Â¦ With South America as much under one govern
ment as North America is under qurs, our position
would be much stronger and safer, because the risk
of European intervention would be less.
This is the tendency for the last thirty years, during
which time Germany and Italy have both undergone
the process of uniting a people of common blood and
language under one rule and one flag. As the popu
lation and power of the Central and South American
countries increase, it is inevitable that the people,
who are of common racial origin and language, will
consolidate. It must be the work of patriots, how
ever, for the politicians want the multitude of small
countries, with their offices and patronage. Senti
ment in the United States is in favor of South Ameri
can consolidation. Our obligations under the Mon
roe doctrine require that we take an interest in
South American politics. The numerous little states
there are always peppery toward each other and
liable at any time to get into trouble with each other
and appeal to Europe for intervention. This we
cannot permit, for we want no European troops
landed in this hemisphere, unless in a war directly
between some nation here and a European power,
and in concluding such action we would veto any
transfer of territory and would spend every military
energy we have in preventing it.
It is probable that "there is a strong revolutionary
element in each country that is determined not so
much upon subversion of the local government as
upon an upheaval that will result in a consolidation
of territory now under three Governments into a na
tion with one Government.
SO far it seems" that the trouble between Venezu
ela and Colombia," with Ecuador making some
fuss on the side, is not in the nature of an out
and-out declaration of war, but the encouragement
of revolutionists within the three countries. Venez
uela has been in a disturbed condition for some time,
and it is believed at Caracas that the Colombian Gov
ernment has helped to push the revolution against
Castro. On the other hand, it isÂ«uspected at Bogota
that Castro has fomented the Colombian revolution.
Just why Ecuador is active does not plainly appear,
since Bogota and Quito have seemed to be- cordial
even beyond the requirements of diplomacy.

Some of the passengers have been disappointed because they

horses and every other creature credited with Inhabiting the
kingdom of Neptune. Jt must be said, however, to the credit
of the officers of the ship, that they have in a measure rnado
up for this disappointment by regaling us with their choicest
stories of adventure with the demons of the sea. The follow
i ing was related to us as a true story. It happened while a
whaling vessel was off the coast of South America. They had
J captured a fine whale which was towed alongside in order to
take oft the blubber.. The sailors were standing on the whalo
with sharp spades cutting off great chunks of the blubber and
throwing them on board. As usual, there was a shark scout
ing around picking up whatever might be dropped, and once,
coming too near, a sailor struck him with his spade, inflicting
a very deep cut in the side. Now, the vitality of a shark is
wonderful. This apparently mortal wound did not even affect
the shark's appetite; but as soon as he swallowed an especially
large piece of blubber, it came j out at his side. Nothing
daunted, the shark again swallowed the blubber with the same
effect. He tried osain and again, and, as the ship sailed away
he was still swallowing the blubber, losing it and swallowing
it again.

AT the Eastern elections this year it is probable
there will be more tests than ever before of
.the use of balloting machines. The results
of the experiments thus far made have been encour
aging and as a consequence many towns and cities
that have not yet tried' the new way of voting will
make the experiment this fall.
Most, of "the localities where the machines are to
be tried for the first time are small, but it is probable
Â¦a test will be made in Boston, and should it be so,
the results will furnish a good basis upon which to
fo'md estimates of the availability of the machines
for cities of the largest size. Massachusetts some
time ego created a State Board of Examiners on vot
ing machines, which must first approve a machine
before it can be used at elections. The board has
approved certain machines and several of. them have
been set up for public trial. Moreover, the Boston
Election 4 Commissioners have made a tour of inves
tigation to the various cities in which machines have
been used, and it is reported that they have returned
strongly convinced of the practical utility and ad
vantage of the machine system.
_ The Commissioners themselves have not yet ma^de
an official report of their investigations,' but it has
been stated by several of them that most of the wit
nesses examined in Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buf
falo and other .places were well-nigh unanimous in
favor of the machine. In the report that comes to,
us of the investigation it is stated: "The machines
used find favor, according to these numerous and
credible witnesses, for the reason that they are ac
curate in recording votes and report the result pi
the poll quickly. In the course of the board's journey
Qf inspection and 'information inquiry was made in*
New York^City as to the attitude of city officials with
respect to the machines. They had been on exhibi
tion in Tammany Hall for two years and had been
put to the most trying tests, but* the Tammany, poli
ticians, if was discovered, did not approve of them
for New York City. In the cities visited the machines
have stood the test of several elections and seem to
have passed beyond the experimental stage."
In Pennsylvania the people are to vote at the com
ing election upon an amendment authorizing the use
of the machines. and as a consequence a good deal
of study is being given in that State to the results of
the experiments that have been. already made. â¢ The
amendment does not require the use of the machines,
but leaves it optional with the Legislature. It is be
lieved, however, that if the amendment be adopted
Pennsylvania will soon have a system of machine
voting in operation.
It will be seen then that the movement toward the
new system is moving rapidly. * The machines are
being improved and made more effective with each
succeeding test and it would seem that sooner or
later every progrssive community will have to adopt
them.

The country would be in sympathy with action by
the G. A. R. looking toward such a reform, but it is
doubtful whether it will ever be taken.
The action of that organization upon General
Evans' report will be awaited with great interest.
Any proposition to change our pension policy is
met with stubborn opposition, in the fear that it will
be made less liberal. A reform might be effected,
however, that would make it far more liberal to those
who are "deserving.
Perhaps it will never be done, but if a commission
of independent men could be appointed to review
and revise our whole pension system, pensions
might be limited to actual disability and the amount
saved be added to the pensions of widows and those
whose capacity was really and permanently impaired
in their country's service.
General Evans reports 997.737 pensioners on the
roll, an increase of 4206 over last year, although it
lost by death 38,153. It is interesting to notice that
two of the deaths were pensioners of the Revolu
tionary War, which closed 118 years ago. We may ex
pect, therefore, that under existing laws, for wars
now past, pensioners will be on the roll in the year
2019. Of pensioners of the war of 1812 there died
215, and that war ended eighty-six years ago. The
Spanish war has already added nearly 6000 pension
ers to the roll, not including the claimants from the
Philippines, who are believed to number many
thousands, whose claims will occupy the attention of
the bureau during the coming year, with the result
of increasing the appropriation by several millions,
and making the pension roll more than one million
of persons. Last year 13,334 widows of the Civil War
went upon the rolls.
For non-military folks we seem to be indulging
martial expense rather freely. Of course we omit the
pension payments by other countries, but they are
so small that if counted it would leave our relative
position the same, with Great Britain alone lead
ing-us.
Putting pensions and cost of army and navy into
the annual military budget, we are paying annually
for military purposes the sum of $330,727,878, or
more than any of the military nations pay for their
combined army and navy, except Great Britain* and
she exceeds us by only $13,000,000.
Comparing this payment with the cost Â¦ of main
taining their standing armies by the military nations,
it exceeds some of them and approaches the highest.
The annual cost of the Austrian army is $123,000,000;
of the French, $127,000,000; the German, $159,000,
000; the British, $197,000,000; Russian, $166,000,
000; and of our own, $134,000,000. The t cost of the
British navy is $145,000,000; the French, $60,000,
000; the German, $35,000,000; the Russian, $42,000,
000; the United States, $55,000,000.
To inform his fellow veterans and the country as to
the*facts, General Evans has prepared an advance
copy of his annual report for use at the coming na
tional encampment of the G. A. R. A synopsis has
been published, which contains facts and statistics
that may be commented upon. It appears that the
annual pension payment in round numbers in Grant's
first term was $^9,000,000; in his second^ $28,000,000;
Hayes' term, $38,000,000, , when Garfield said.it had
reached high water mark; but in Garfieid's term it
rose to ?59,ooo,ooo, and in Cleveland's first term was
$76,000,000, when Cleveland made a determined stand
against further incre^ge, but was met by a powerful
reaction which carried the appropriation up to $129,
600,000 per year during Harrison's term, and $139,
000,000 during Cleveland's second term; during Mc-
Kinley's first term it was $140,000,000.
PENSION COMMISSIONER, EVANS has
been subjected to almost constant attacks, due
to the charge that his administration of his
bureau is illiberal. He is himself an old sol
dier and a member of the G. A. R., but the most per
sistent demands for his removal have come from that
organization. The charges have been numerous, and
it has appeared that his position has been rendered
intolerable," unless he is a philosopher or the owner
of a resistant nerve as big as the center- pole of a
circus tent.

Such an Address ;is one of the hopeful signs that
are visible here and there through the- darkness of
the race problem in the Southern States. When brave
men like this former Governor of Alabama speak out
it will not be long before they will have a considerable
following. Should a right standard of official honor
be fixed in the minds of the officers, of the. law not
in the South only but throughout the Union there
will be an immense gain for society. Fortunately,
brave and honorable officers are not rare, but there
are still too many of them who have not learned that
there are times when honor calls upon them to do
their duty even if they die at the post.
should not the Sheriff die at his post as well as the
locomotive engineer or the priest or the doctor or the
soldier?"-

It was reported that every effort was
being made to secure from the Employers'
Association a promise to mediate on the
subject of the settlement of the strike
but that thus far these efforts have proved
abortive. It was thought the sentiment to
be expressed at the mass-meeting of re
tailers at Metropolitan Hall to-morrow
evening would have a beneficial effect,
and it was decided 1 to aid the retailers In
making the meeting a success.
Mr. -Bibo reported having -attended a
meeting of the executive committee of the
City . Front Federation on Sunday at
which he was assured that the Federation
would gladly co-operate with the Munici
pal Federation in its campaign In- the in

The published statement that the reso
lutions offered at the meeting of the Re
tall Trades Association on Sunday were
submitted by C.I L. Barrington was an
error. The resolutions were presented by
Edward' P. Barry of the retail cigar deal
ers. Mr. Barrington, although in accord
with the spirit that prevailed at the meet
ing alluded to, lays no claim to either the
preparation or submission of the resolu
tions in question.
E. P. Barry's Resolutions.
Â¦The executive committee of City

olution announcing that that body was
willing at any time, to meet any commit
tee of the Employers? Association to dis

strike. If the association declines to ap
point an arbitration committee, the fed
eration declares its -willingness to treat
with any representative body named by

Willing to Settle Strike.
In the second place, the Chief of Police has
used the force at his disposal in ' such a
manner as to show either conspicuous unfair
ness or conspicuous incapacity. The â¢ police
have been put on the wagons when there was
no necessity for doing so. We beg: to refer
you to our letters written to his Honor - the
Mayor, in which we show that such a move Is
absurd strategy, but useful to show that the
Police Commission is on the side of the em
ployers. â¢
In the third place, the Police Commission has
sworn in a large number of special policemen,
In the present struggle between labor and the
employers there has been no breach, of the law.
The men have been absolutely peaceful. Yet
the police department of the city . government
has tried by all means In its power to proclaim
to the world that the city la the scene of riot,
and has taken every measure to make that
proclamation good by using tactics calculated
to lead to a serious breach of the peace.
In the first place the president of the Police
Commission wrote an open letter containing a
number of misrepresentations concerning the
situation. His Honor, the Mayor ' states that
this letter Is unwise and that the statements
in it are untrue. We have twice petitioned the
Mayor to remove Mr. Newhall because of his
evident unfltness for office and because of the
danger of putting power In the hands of , a
man who has shown himself so devoid of pru
dence, of truth and of decency, but in spite of
facts the Mayor has refused to act. â
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors, City
and County of San Francisco â Gentlemen:
We come before you as the representatives of
the workingmen who have been locked out of
employment at the dictates of a secret society
known as the Employers' Association. We
come before your honorable board, not to ask
you to Interfere between our employers and us.
Though the attack has been wantonly j made
upon us, though the employers are using all
means to Injure us, we are able to hold our
own. As long as the struggle is between them
and us we have no fears of the outcome. But
we have a right to fair play. We have a right
that the Influence of the city government shall
not be used against us. and it is to ask you
to vindicate that right we now come before you.
We have already applied to the chief execu
tive of the city for redress, but we have not
found it. Though it may be that you have no
legal machinery in your control to compel
relief, still you are the popular branch of the
city government, you represent the people
directly, and the expression of your opinion in
the form of a resolution cannot fail to have
the greatest weight.
The San Francisco Labor Council filed a
petition yesterday with the Board of Su
pervisors with a request for the Interven
tion of that body In the mattei* of the
petition to Mayor Phelan for the removal
of George A. Newhall as Police Commis
sioner. The council also protests against
the appointment of special policemen. The

It is likely that next month the club
will hire a bay steamer to convey the
automobiles of the members to Sausalito
or Tiburon for a run over the pretty roads
of Marin County. An Invitation from
Reno, Â¦Nev., for the club to send several
machines up to that town was received,
but it is considered that the distance Is
too great for any concerted action on the
part of the club.
President Hyde stated that the efforts
of the club attorney, H. P. Dimond, had
been rewarded by securing the passage of
satisfactory ordinances regulating the
speed of automobiles in ban Francisco,
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. The
president said that the directors will rlc
vote their attention to securing favorable

A similar statement was made by T.
Burns, a trustee of the Shipwrights' Un
ion.
"Of the 176 members of the union who
walked out on May 20 not a single man
has returned to work. It is true some
men went to work ct the Union Iron
Works to-day, but they were not members
of our union. Our men remain steadfast
to the principles of the union and they
have not weakened to date. I do not
know the men who went to work, but
they are not affiliated with our organiza
tion In any manner."
The statement that the twenty-three
men who went to work in the shipyards
at the Union Iron Works were ship
wrights is officially denied by officers of
the Shipwrights' and Calkers' Union No.
9162. When questioned concerning the mat
ter last night Secretary J. D. Duarte of
the union said:
"The story is exaggerated," he said.
"We had watchers at the works during
the morning, and none of them reports
that any such number of molders went
back to work. The statement that 1700
men are employed â¢ at the Union Iron
Works is also untrue. The actual num
ber will not exceed 900. The molders are
standing shoulder to shoulder, and all
are satisfied with the prospects. There
will be no backdown, either by them, or
the machinists."
The people connected with the Iron
Trades Council arc loth to believe that
any striking molders returned to work
yesterday. R. I. Wisler, chairman of the
executive committee of the Iron Trades
Council, denied the truth of the story.
A rumor gained currency yesterday that
many striking machinists had applied to
the management of the Risdon Iron
Works to be allowed to return to work,
but this proved to be untrue. Inquiry at
the works developed that as far as the
molders were concerned, all vacant places
were filled some time ago, and that no ad
ditional men were required. At the com
mencement of the strike the Risdrfn Iron
Works employed 1400 men, and at the pres
ent time 1100 men are at work.
Mr. Scott said further that the situation
was full of promise. He felt satisfied that
affairs would shape themselves satisfac
torily in the near future, and that more
of the strikers would come back before
many weeks had elapsed.
Iron Trades Council Makes Denial.
"The molders had no reason for strik
ing in the first place," said he yesterday.
"No pressure of any kind was brought to
bear upon them to return to the works.
They came back voluntarily. The number
of molders was twenty-one. In addition to
these, twenty-three men went back to
work in the shipyards. Whether these
were strikers or not I do not know. I was
told by a mblder that he and his fellows
returned to work because they were un
able to secure strike benefits from their
union. Most of them are married men,
and I presume they preferred to go to work
tinder the old agreement rather than re
main idle. I know that 90 per cent of the
molders who struck in the Union Iron
Works in May to assist the striking ma
chinists are again at work. About 1700
men are now regularly employed at the
works as against about 3500 before the
strike." <
Henry T. Scott Feels Satisfied.
The official statement of Henry T. Scott,
president of the Union Iron Works, con
firms the story of the return of the strik
ers to their work in every detail. Mr.
Scott expressed great satisfaction at the
change of sentiment in the men.
The incident, which is regarded by the
Union Iron Works. management as indi
cating that the strike is losing strength,
excited considerable comment about the
works. The pickets of the machinists and
molders who lingered outside sought in
vain to dissuade some of the returning
strikers to reconsider their resolution, but
their efforts were fruitless. When the
whistle blew the working force at the
works was increased by forty-four men.
THE machinists' strike, which was
inaugurated on- May 20, received
a serious setback yesterday when
twenty-one molders who struck
In sympathy about the same time
returned to their work at the Union Iron
Works. The men appeared without solici
tation at the works early in the morning,
and each went to his post as if he had
been there every day during the past
three months. At the same time twenty
three other men, including ship" carpen
ters and other mechanics who left the
works In May last, resumed work.
clothing them with the authority of the city
and putting thorn unreasonably at the disposal
of the employers.
We beg to call your attention to the ominous
fact that these men have been picked up from
anywhere and everywhere and that no Inquiry
has been made into their character or fitness
or responsibility. This is a misuse of power
which calls for condemnation especially "from
honorable board. It is a terrible thing
to put the lives of citizens at the mercy of men
whose addresses are not even known, whose
antecedents are a problem and who are practi
cally under no supervision or control. It is
surely your duty to rebuke such an outrage on
the people of this city. The men now deprived
of employment are not transients, loafers or
estrays. This town is their home, here their
families live, here many of them were born.
They are the citizens of this city. Its-peace
and good name "are as dear to them as to any
other class In this community, and for that
reason they appeal to you to express your
sense of the injustice that is done to them by
the retaining of Mr. Newhall as a member ot
the Police Commission, by the employment of
police to do the work of employers and by the
arming of Irresponsible and reckless mercen
aries to -terrorize this peaceful community.
We are respectfully yours.

An effort was made yesterday by the
Machinists' Union to prevent the Standard
Machine Company from repairing the
launch Amy. but it was unsuccessful.
William F. Brusher, one of the members
of the firm which contracted to put the
launch In repair, was summoned before
the union and told that he could not. as a
member of the union, complete the Job.
Brusher was formerly a Journeyman ma
chinist and only lately became an em

self he contended that the union had no
right to Interfere. After a lengthy argu

him to go back to work on the launch.
The George W. Elder was a day late In
arriving at Portland on her trip. The de

cables to run over the housetops the lines
of the district messenger service will be
centered for the time. This arrange
ment will clear up all the wires from the
thoroughfares that have been an obsta

Attorney Foulds of the Market Street
Railway Company argued from a legal
standpoint that the board had no power to
increase the license tax on street cars
when it is specifically provided for in the
franchise. Foulds arpued that the street
railway companies already pay their full
proportion of taxes for the support of the

the city. The resolution, -which was re

ing the receipt of an opinion of the City
Attorney as to whether the firm named
has \-iolated the contract, follows:
THE principal development in the strike situation yesterday was the return to work of twenty-one mold- â¢
ers and twenty- three mechanics at the Union Iron Works, all of whom went out in a sympathetic
strike in behalf of the machinists in May last. The fact that the men returned to their stations -with
out solicitation by the management of the Union Iron Works and voluntarily agreed to stand by the
schedule in force before the strike is regarded by those interested in tho iron trades as a virtual ac
knowledgment of the failure of the machinists' strike, and the belief is growing that the end is fast ap
proaching. . . i ' \ ' ' -
The tie-up of gTain vessels at Port Costa was slightly relieved yesterday when thirty-five men
were secured to go to that place to engage in the unloading of grain vessels. The principal grain dealers
in this city are confident that in the near future a sufficient force can be secured to answer all require
ments, and thereby relieve the congestion of traffic which was the inevitable result of the strike. On the
other hand the strike leaders declare their cause will suffer no material damage by reason of the action* of %
the grain dealers in sending the men to Port Costa.
The Labor Council filed a petition with the Board of Supervisors requesting that body to take a
hand in the matter of the petition to Mayor Phelan for the removal of Police Commissioner Newhall. The
council also protests vigorously against the appointment of special policemen at a time when, according to
the views of that body, no valid reason for their appointment can be advanced.
At the meeting of the Board of Supervisors, Supervisor Heed introduced an ordinance requiring
all special policemen to wear uniforms, and directing that they shall be distinguished from the regular
officers by wearing a star bearing the word "special." The ordinance confers the right upon the Police
Commissioners to appoint special policemen on the petition of any person, firm or corporation, but all such

The examination of Charles L. Clayton
for embezzlement was had yesterday be
fore United States Court Commissioner
Heacock. Clayton was quartermaster's
clerk on the ttansport Sheridan and left
the vessel sudJenly after having been in
formed that another clerk had been ap
pointed in his place. His books were ex
amined and v it was found that he was
short $1261 90 in his cash. Clayton was
arrested a day or two afterward by Se
cret Service A?ent Hazen. who found him
drunk in the bou3e of a lriend on Castro
street.
George D. Collins appeared for the pris
oner and Assistant United States Attor
ney Banning for the Government. Clay
ton put in the defense that on going -to
the office on board the transport on three
different mornings he had found the safe
unlocked. It had been left so. he said, on
the previous vi'ght. either by himself or
by Captain Milesâ he could not say which.
His counsel inferred that Captain Miles,
having had access to the safe, was just
as responsible icr the safe keeping of the
money as was Clayton.
The case will be argued on Wednesday
at 2 p.m.

sponsible for Loss of

NEW TOnK. Aug. 19.-DealingB \ in stocks
to-day were too 6mall to offer a broad basis
for generalization. But the fact is significant
that very few stocks were offering for sale,
holders apparently being content to retain their
holdings in spite of bome of the developments
unfavorable to values, so that the demand,
though small, was eufficient to overcome the
opening decline and establish a higher range
of prices than those at the close of last week
The additions to the ranks of the striking
steel workers over Sunday were responsible
for the opening heaviness, not only in those
stocks, but in .the, general list. The interes-ts
involved in the strike are so large that its
vicissitudes affect the values of all securities.
The market guardians for the steel stocks sup
ported them and the starting of some of their
mills. had a reviving effect. â¢ But they did not
fully rhare In the â¢ later recovery- of the mar
ket, which carried fome/if the railroad stocks
fubrUntiaKy over Saturday's! prices. The ac
tivity land' strength was confined to a 'few
f-tocks cnly and was apparently due to causes
individual to tho&e otocke.- -Norfolk and West
ern was most conspicuous under the influence
of the net earnings of the company for the
fiscal year, showing, a Eubstantlal surplus over
the present dividend rate. Chesapeake and
Ohio rose to a less extent In sympathy. The
buying of these stocks was attributed to Phila
delphia account. The figures of the coal ex
port trade published this morning, showing the
value of coal exports doubled since 1897 and
the amount more than trebled since ,18*1, were
aa influence In the ttrentth of these stocks.

CHICAGO, Aug. 19.â Heavy receipts In the
Northwest, together with lower cables, caused
a weak opening in the wheat pit. The early
loss, however, was more than recovered later
en a decrease in the visible supply of 1,450,000
bushels and on heavy seaboard clearances.
Trading was mostly for local account, Sep
tember opened %@%c to %@%c lower at 70%@
71c. On commission-house selling the price de
clined to 70%c, but rallied later on covering by
local shorts to 71%c. The close was %c lower
at 71%@71%c. Toward the close there was con
siderable changing from September to Decem
ber.
Heavy rains cast of the Mississippi River
caused a weak opening in corn. Speculative
operations were small" and traders appeared to
be waiting for developments of relations with
supply and demand. The weakness In wheat
was one of the causes for the bearishness in
corn. September closed %c lower at oS%c.
Oats opened steady and higher, but declined
in sympathy with corn. Trading was 'light.
September closed %c lower ak35%c.
Provisions opened steady on higher prices for
hogs. On good buying by packing-houses the
market became strong. Trading was light on
the whole.. January pork with a gain of 22'/4c,
lard 5(37^0 higher and ribs 10c higher. â¢

CLOSING.
There was a dead calm in the stock market
to-day with prices generally sagging. Consols
were heavy and the weakness of New York
accompanying, suggestions as to gold with
drawals, American stocks opened weak on Sat
urday's bank statement and the spread of the
steel strike, but London is inclined to plck\up
stocks on reactions and New York came as a
buyer, particularly of. Norfolk and Western
on the rumors of . a coal combination. .The
close was irregular.
, The : Bank '. of England has. received Â£333,000
gold in bars and has bought Â£166,000 in India
and Â£16,000 on the continent. Money, quiet.

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
"Peaches -are quiet, but spot stocks being
light everything is firmly held. There was no
talk of futures." ...
"Prunes remain steady at substantially pre
vious range. The spot supply is email and
very firmly held, but arrivals are expected
shortly which will relieve the situation here
somewhat. Yesterday's sales were light, being
little more than retail quantities, and nothing
was said about sales of futures.
Mail reports from New York eay: "There
Â¦was a continued quiet condition noted In yes
terday's market, with business confined to
actual requirements. Buyers are apparently
holding off on actual transactions, though there
is more inquiry from all directions. The prin
cipal feature of the market was the advance
of loose raisins to 5%c for 2-crown and 6',ic
for 3-crown. Thre are no 4-crowns here. Seed
lees Muscatels are held very firm at 6%c and
seeded are still wiling at 7@7%c. Business In
all varieties is light, but spot stocks are Email
and conditions favor increased firmness. Im
ported goods show no essential change from
the previous reports.
â¢'There is a firm feeling In currants, but
no large tales were reported. No further
cables have been received, indicating that crop
conditions arc not essentially different. There
it perhaps a trifle more inquiry, but no Im
portant transactions are reported as pending.
"A good deal more interest Is noted in apri
cots. While no important sales are reported
there has been considerably more Inquiry of
late and choice Royals in bags are quoted at
8%c. f. o. b. coast. The goods which have ar
rived here are said to be of uncommonly good
quality, but the supply Is still very small,

which are peculiarly benefited by the coal ex- |
port trade. Norfolk and Western rose 2H over
Saturday. The rise in St. Paul and Atchison
reached about the same figure in- a sudden
spurt Just before the close.- Chicago and*.
Eastern Illinois mounted 8 points over the pre
vious sale. Amalgamated Copper resumed Its
upward movement and there was some activity ;
in Sugar, owing to the concerted action of the i
companies in fixing prices. The stock advanced
but lost practically all the rise. . There was
greater confidence felt In the money outlook
than on Saturday after the bank statement.
This feeling was due to several causes. The
unexpectedly large decrease in cash was said Â¦
to be due to the retirement of circulation by
the absorbed Bank of the Republic. The sub
treasury has made a email contribution to the
money market since Friday by reason of large
pension payments and disbursements on ac
count of Philippine expenditures. But the sud
den weakness developed In" the foreign ex-
change market was the dominant influence In
causing the better feeling over the' money out
look, on account of the assurance afforded, that
gold from Europe would be â¢ forthcoming to.
meet any urgent needs . on the part of New
York. Demand bills fell to-day to $4 86%, com
pared with $4 SS at the high point last week,
marking a relapse of approximately a third
of the range from the gold-export, to the gold-
Import point. -Offerings of bills against wheat
exports, purchases of stock for London account
and a cessation of the demand for repayment
by syndicates of the loans from European bor
rowers were all influential in the weakness of
exchange. The market closed firm, but very
dull on the last rally.
Railroad bonds were irregular. Total sales,

WHEAT â Liverpool and Antwerp were lower.
Chicago declined at the opening on weaker
cables and general rains In Indiana and Illi

ever. There was less than 1.000,000 bushels at
the seaboard, and only 1,250,000 at lake and
canal points. This was rxpected to result in
lighter clearances, but 1,851,000'- bushels were
cleared nevertheless. The American visible
supply decreased 1.449.000 bushels.

The following dispatch from Liverpool will
interest Apple and Prune growers, as show
ing what the demand is likely, to be for these
fruits abroad: "French Prunes are again com
manding more attention, reports from France
as to the season's output being perhaps re
sponsible for some amount of the inquiry, 31a
to 453 being paid, according to the size of the
fruit. The crop of 1901 promises only moder
ately, while the Apple crop of France, which
locally provides the great substitute for
Prunes, is an entire failure, so that it is very
probable our continental neighbors wilt not
have much fruit of this description for export
in any direction.. We look for a good season
on" California Prunes."

WATKINS. Auctioneer."Men and Women" is the name of the
play which served to Introduce the mem
bers 'of the Central Theater Stock Com
pany in their initial venture in society
drama last night. The introduction was
a marked success. The new leading lady,
Miss Annette Marshall, made her first ap
pearance and created a favorable impres
sion In the part of Agnes Rodman. Her
voice is well modulated and her acting
displayed considerable talent, besides a
natural charm of manner. Miss Marshall
is destined to be a valuable acquisition to
Central.
Another immense audience greeted the
new programme at the Orpheum last
night and every number was enthusiasti
cally received. "The Smart Set," a hilar
ious jumble given by the four Otts, set
the house in roars of laughter. Louise
Thorndyke Bouclcault ia a pleasing figure
on the stage. The music of Lefebre's Sax
ophone Quartet is as novel as it is pleas
ing and the acrobatic work of the Crags
family is the best of its kind ever seen in
the city. On account of the indisposition
of Katherine Germaine Richard Jose sang.
The popular contra-tenor will be heard all
the week. Charles H. Bradshaw and com
pany in "Fix in a Fix," Hill and Sllviany,
the sensational bicyclists; Remarc and
Rllay, European grotesques, and the bio
graph complete the bill.
Orpheum.
and it at once established itself as a prime
favorite. Last night the Grand was well
filled with a thoroughly appreciative audi
ence. Much of the success of the piece
hinges upon the character of Lieutenant
John Hinds, who has risen from the ranks
and gets a commission In a crack cavalry
regiment. He has been unused to the ways
of polite society, but has the heart of a
lion and the instincts of a true gentle
man. The part was essayed by Daniel
Frawley and his interpretation was clev
er. From the blundering mistake in the
first act to the Intensely dramatic scene
with Huttpn in the last act he was the
character to the life and carried the sym
pathies of the audience with him. Har
rington Reynolds as his friend. Lieutenant
Launcelot Pleydell, was -effective, and
shared the honors with Frawley. Frank
Mathieu as Lieutenant Earl of Hunstan
ton r.r.d H. S. Duffield as Colonel Stapyl
ton were good. Mary Van Buren as the
Baroness Royden gave a fine rendition of
the part. She lacked in vivacity. in the
lighter scenes, but In the final scene be
tween her and her lover she was splendid.
Phosa McAllister was dignified as Lady
Pleydell . and Blanche Douglass was
charming as Kate Johnson. The other
parts -were -well sustained.
an otherwise clever company. Robert
Cummings gave a virile impersonation of
Israel Cohen, a bank president, while
Ernest Howell was quaintly humorous as
Mr. Pendleton, a bank director. Howard
Scott distinguished himself as Stephen
Rodman, the Governor cf Arizona and a
reformed convict. Wlllard Blackmore
played the defaulting cashier well and
gave a thrilling climax to one of the
strongest acts in melodrama when he
placed the handcuffs on his own hands
and acknowledged his guilt. Edwin T.
Emery, Stanley Ross and James Corrigan
were good as usual. Juliet Crosby was
delightful as Mrs. Kate Delafleld. and
Mabel Pennock, Oza Waldrop, Georgia
Woodthorpe and Lillian Bartlett acted
their Beveral parts with tact and good
judgment.
Alcazar.
Miss Charlotte Thompson's new play,
"Silver-Mounted Harness," began its sec
ond week at the Alcazar to a good house
last evening. The flower dance at the end
of the third act Is the feature of the play
and deserved the applause it received.
Fischer's Concert House.
Coleman and Mexis, sharpshooters, were
the sensation of the evening at Fischer's.
Their work is extraordinary. Camelia and
Amelita, Spanish dancers; Fannie Ray
mond, a pleasing balladist; P. A. Duns
worth, a popular tenor; Hooley and Kel
ton, in "McGinty's Resurrection"; Paul
La Croix, a novelty- Juggler: Leo . and
Munroe, eccentric comedians and dancers,
and "Jones and Brown, colored fun mak
ers, completed an excellent programme.
A duet for violin and cello, played by
August Hinrlchs and William "Wertsch,
was warmly encored. The house was
crowded.
Chutes.
A large audience enjoyed the new bill
at the Chutes last night. Hayes brothers,
comedians and dancers, proved clever en
tertainers and scored a .big hit. Mille.
Jeanette and her performing cockatoos
are also a good number. Little Claire
Fex, the clever Juvenile, made her reap
pearance and repeated her former big
success. Other good numbers are Rey
nard, the ventriloquist: Irving Jones, the
colored comedian; the Gagnouxs in a clev
er juggling act, and new moving pictures.
Olympia.
Senorita Salvlnl, a Spanish character
artiste, Annie Morris, a coon shouter,
Kalacratus, a hoop juggler, and lone, In
poses plastiques, are the principal enter
tainers at the Olympla this "weeK.

Judge Hall and a jury will decide upon
the merits of the case, the preliminaries

Miss Herman accuses her relatives, an old
couple living alone, of enticing her to
come to this coast from Pennsylvania on
the promise of making her their com
panion during their remaining Â¦ years and
their heir when they died. She came and
for a time was well pleased; now she says
that she has been cast off for no cause
and left dependent on the charity of
strangers. In her complaint she i alleges
that this waa accomplished by asking her
to contribute to the household expenses,
she. working out in accordance with their
request and gradually being forbidden the
privileges of the Mertz home.
â¢ The uncle and aunt maintain that It was
their, niece's discontent and roving ways
that caused the rupture. They say that
they were at all times willing to carry out
the original agreement. .
â¢Miss Herman states that her relatives
painted rosy pictures of her future as their
adopted daughter and heir, promising her
a bequest of not less than $10,000.

extent. , .-.-Â¦'-'

source from which the power will be
taken. There is any quantity of water
power available en either side of the tun

W hen the project was first taken up it
was the intention to merely introduce
electricity to be used in the operation of
the trains through the Cascade tunnel
and to install the plant for that purpose
at once; but the calculations made by the
engineers convinced the officials that this
was a vastly more economical method of
operating than the one in use and the
plans have been greatly enlarged. It is
rot yet decided, however, whether the
portion of the road to be equipped for
electric motors will extend from Skyko
mish to Leavenworth or from Everett to
Wenatchee.

R. C. Carton has written plays before,
one good one. "Lord and Lady Algy," and
"Wheels Within Wheels," but it is doubt
ful if this latest effort will add anything
to his reputation. The plot is given away
in the first act. Lady Huntworth, young,
charming, beautiful, has been divorced
frcm her husband, a drunken wretch who
has done everything but beat her, and she
takes: it into her head to cook for her
living. Sbe goes into service at a vicar
age and soon has all the male element at
her French heels, the vicar, a bachelor of
uncertain age; the vioar's niece's be
trothed, and Gandy, their rather Mgh and
mighty butler. The lady's husband is also
a suitor for her hand and heart, having
discovered that she has fallen heiress to
an Australian fortuneâ those easy for
tunes!âand having discovered her where
abouts by accident through an acquaint
ance with the betrothed. Then the vicar
and Gandy propose to the pretty cook
maid, only to be refused, and the be
trothed offers his friendship in such manly
fashion that she makes it evident that it
_would not be "No" if he entered the lists.
Of course it ends happily ever, afterward.
The niece runs away with a convenient
curate and her betrothed gets Lady Hunt
worth and the Australian gold. Meantime
there is some rather amusing comedy that
the company certainly made the best of,
with the exception of the leading lady,
Miss Hilda Spong, who did little but
smile (adorably) through her part and
&l-ow an uncommonly handsome face and
figure in her cap and gown. She did noth
ing as beautifully as it can be done, which
is saying more than it seems at first sight.
Neither is Miss Spong the only pretty
girl in the cast. Beatrice Morgan is de

NOW let Bertha Clay and the
"Duchess," Dora Thome and the
rest of the innocuous romanticists
of the lemonade age hide their
diminished heads, for. a greater
than they has arisen! R. C. Carton has
gone them several better in his "Lady
Huntworth's Experiment." that shone
alike upon the just and the unjust last
night at the Columbia, with Dan Froh
man's good company at the handle. It is
a play like those books that were always
whipped under the pillow when the
economical dominie came round to turn
out the gas; in which belted Earls and
errant damsels in distress wandered
through marble halls -with their hearts on
their fashionable sleeves. It is the old
romance of the "Lady Turned Serving-
Maid" brought up to date, and all family
heraldry has assisted in its incubation.
Edythe Chapman seldom appears to bet
ter, advantage than she does in the Bar
bara Frietchle of Clyde Fitch, the tender,
loving, brave and loyal daughter of the
sunny South. That' is why the second
night's production was greeted with a
large and appreciative audience. While
the play has many defects, it abounds in
excellent episodes, notably the love scene
in the first act. the winging of Sharp
shooter Gelwex in the second and the en
counter in the third with mad Jack Neg
ly. These afford Miss Chapman an op
portunity of displaying all sides of her
emotional nature. The company Is a good

But I don't sec two dollars' worth in the
play from any standpoint, and I think the
experiment of charging that for it will not
prove by any means so successful as
"Lady Huntworth's" experiment.
The men, to:>, are mostly satisfactory.
Grant Stewart as the vicar, mincing and
ladylike, but still with a somewhat fishy
eye for beauty, is entirely delightful, and
Gandy is a satisfying Crulkshankian or
Pickwickian figure in William F. Owen's
hands. Jameson Lee Finney has the un
pleasant part of the drunken husband.- a
character quite out of key in the frothy
play, but made strong and powerful by
the actor.

D. A. Vail, the young business man of
Los Angeles, who was charged with hav
ing sent an insulting, letter to Miss Alice
Maud Harries of Mill Valley, has been ex
onerated from air suspicion by the deci
sion'of United States Court Commissioner
Heacock. Judge Heacock gave his deci
sion yesterday morning, and said that
there had been some doubt in his mind
last Saturday on the conclusion of the ex
amination, but that he had taken the
whole of Sunday to deliberate upon the
evidence, and he thanked God that he had
done so, he said, for he was -fully con
vinced of. 'the innocence of the young man.
Disregarding the evidence of the hand
writing experts, for they conflicted, he
added, he had compared the handwriting
of the accused man.wita that in the let
ter which .formed the basis of the charge
and had carefully weighed all . the evi
dence, and the result was that he was
convinced of Mr. Vail's innocence. He
therefore dismissed the charge.
A. H. Vail, uncle of the defendant, re
ceived a letter from Los Angeles signed
Revenge," In which the writer stated
that having a grievance against Vail he,
the anonymous writer, had written the
scurrilous letter and signed Vail's name
to it. A similar letter was written to Miss
Harries. Both letters were in the same
hanuwriting and on similar paper in size
and texture to that used In the scurrilous
note. â¢ i '
.Mr. Vail was warmly congratulated by
his friends on the outcome of the trial.
The value of the testimony Oii handwrit
ing experts was shown by the fact that
the. one hired, by the prosecution swore
the handwriting of the scurrilous note
was Vail's, while the one hired by the de
fense swore It was not. Each argued in
support of his declaration, as a lawyer
would in backing up a contention.

about $2000, were taken. Detectives Dinan
and "Wren were detailed on the case and
last evening they arrested an athletic
young fellow who gave his name as Mike
Ifce and charged him with the crime. A
large portion of the plunder was 'found
in his pockets. Lee, the police think, is
a desperate crook. He had two keys,
which would fit almost any Yale lock.
Lee at first denied that he committed the
burglary, but when confronted with the
evidence of his guilt he broke down and
made a complete confession. To the de
tectives he said he arrived here about two
weeks ago from Seattle us a . stowaway.
"While * passing Â¦ the jewelry store- - he
thought It would be easy to enter It and
get away before the police could get track
of him. Early Sunday morning he went
to the store and as the street was de
serted he concluded to force an entrance.
With the keys he had in his possession
he opened the Yale lock which held the
door and quickly entered. After helping
himself to a large assortment of rings,
opera glasses, colored spectacles and two
nickel watches he emerged from the place
and hurriedly walked to his room on
Kearny street, near Pine. Last evening
he was seen by detectives walking 8100?
Grant avenue and they placed him under
arrest. *
The menagerie has been added to since
last season, when it was a rarely fine col
lection of zoological specimens. Several
weeks ago a giraffe was brought to this
country for Ringling Brothers and it is
now on exhibition in this" department of
the circus. It is the' only animal of its
kind in captivity. There are splendid
specimens of ;hÂ» rarest wild animals and
thirty elephants in the menagerie annex. â¢
The programme contains one hundred or
more acts. Among the star features im
ported for this year's bill are Amelia Fee
ley, a young bareback rider, barely 18
years old, who has achieved great Euro
pean fame. She rides In a 'long skirt and
presents a stuuning picture. Then
there is the Â¦ Holloway trio, who perform
onÂ»a high wire the most difficult" gym
nastic work: the Garcinnetti family of
nine acrobatic celebrities from Italy; the
Marvelles and Le Mounts from England
and the Millers from Australia. The won
derful Dacoma family is at the head of
the acrobatic list of sixty performers, and
their feats . separate them from all the
others. Joseph La Flarva, the French
gymnast; the Fisher family, aerialists; Al
bert Crandall â¢ and his trick mule. Mme.
Noble and her bucking horse Jupiter, John
O'Brien and his sixty-one horse act, the
menage of Miss Nora O'Brien and Miss
Fredericks, the bareback riding of John
Rooney and Julia Lowanda and Lizzie
Rooney, the clown antics of the Mlacos.
Al and Steve, and Lockhart's performing
elephants are ultra-brilliant acts in the
long list that makes up the ring pro
gramme. .
Wonderful Performers Will Display
Their Skill During the Coming
Week.
Ringling Bros.' circus has been weighed
and not found wanting by the San Fran
cisco public, and its return next week will
be welcome. It is a circus of enormous
size; the canvas coverings spread over
twelve acres .of ground. In the huge hip
podrome tent' there are three rings, two
stages and an oval racing track a quarter
of a mile long. Overhead are all the me
chanical trappings that go with daring
midair feats.

Sizing Up Delegates.
It is common belief that Hearst will bolt
the Democratic ticket if Phelan is renom-
Inated for Mayor. The Phelanites control
the convention, but they are appalled at
the widespread unpopularity of Phelan.
The Mayor himself comprehends that he
has lost caste in his own party and may
decline to go on the ticket. He speaks of
Foing abroad, temarking that he has ad
justed his business affairs to enable him
to make a long trip. Up Gavin McXab's
sleeve there may be a candidate to allure
the Democracy. Phelan. however is re
rarded as the logical candidate of the
Democratic parly. He was winner in the
little skirmish for delegates to the party
convention. ;

tering obstacles in his search for an ac

or cf leadership on his ticket was offered
to James G. Maguire, but the latter after
reflection declined to. make the race. Had
he accepted war to the,knife would have
