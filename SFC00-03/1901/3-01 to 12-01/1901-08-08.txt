and determined citizens of Coffee County
to-day, j The mob was composed of both
whites and blacks, and though the suffer

A large pesse was quickly organized with
bloodhounds and they chased the negro
until early this morning, when he was
captured In a swamp. Penningtc.n was
bound hand and foot and taken back to
the Davis home for identification.
Word of the assault on Mrs. Davis had
been sent by runners for miles around
Enterprise, and every farmer in the
neighborhood had joined in the search.
There is not a telegraph office in Coffee
County, but the messengers traveled faSt.

with Pennington at least 500 persons were
gathered near the Davis residence. A
great shout went up when the prisoner

men withdrew to the woods and quietly
awaited the result of the meeting of Pen

broke down and wept. He admitted hav

the reason for his action that he was ill.
Taylor lived in a cabin about one-half
mile from the plant and was far from

last Sunday Taylor had "been missing. The

STRIKE SITUATION" IN OAKLAND
Neither in the "danger district" where
ttriking teamsters have made non-union
teaming a hazardous occupation nor on,
the water front were there as many acts
of violence as on Tuesday, and the fears
of these who thought rioting was about
to become general were allayed by the
relatively peaceful conditions that existed
yesterday.
Andrew Furuseth, secretary of the Sail
ors' Union, stated late in the afternoon,
that as a result of repeated protests the
police on duty on the water front had be
come much milder in' their treatment of
the strikers. He said they were less in
clined to use their clubs and in conse
quence the strikers were in better mood
and uere easily controlled by the union
pickets. He said the only complaints had
come from the region of the Lombard
street wharf, where unnecessary rough
ness had been shown by the police.
The sand teamsters took action which
may result in general discomfort. They
refuse to make an exception of the team
sters the street-sprinkling carts
or the wagons hauling the street sweep
ings. This may result in the temporary
cessation of street sweeping and sprink
ling, as the contractorsâ Gray Bros, and
the City Street Improvement Company â
are not at all sure that they will even at
tempt to carry on the work with non
union teamsters.
A DAY of little friction but of great
activity in following up their
several advantages and in seek

the opponent was passed by
strikers and employers yesterday. Sand
teamsters to the number of 500 and nearly
a hundred marine firemen were added to

unions were called out nor new measures
of importance launched.

to the ground in a faint. He was quickly

the crowd stood silently by.
The frightened man was limp and had to
be held up while the chains were fastened
around his neck and body. When all \tas
ready the cry 'was given and the cr^wd
stood back. A match was applied to the
pile and with oil to feed upon the tiny
flame soon burst into a roaring fire. The
terrified negro again pleaded for mercy
in the most agonizing tones and prayed
to God that those around him might per

circled his neck an unearthly shriek was
heard and the man's eyes almost bulged
out of the sockets.

careful about spreading such reports, especially- about
men in a position like mine. Luckily I am able to give
a full account of mvself. If I were not, such a canard
would do me an immense injury and might result in
sending me, though perfectly innocent, back to the

San Quentin he returned at once to Sierra City, where he
has been engaged In mining operations ever since.. - This
can be proved by any number of witnesses. As to his
skulking about Crockett Phelan says he has not been at
that place for seven years cave to pass through on a
train from Sierra City to San Francisco.
When seen at the Russ House last night Phelan was
most willing to talk and tell anything and everything:
about himself. He seemed to realize his ticklish position
and to be anxious to remove any cloud that might be
hovering over him. He is an Irishman about 35 years
of aÂ«re. â¢ . Â¦? .
Warden Agruirre came over to this, city last evening
and 'met Phelan. They had a long conference and the
parojed prisoner gave a satisfactory account of his
whereabouts since being freed from the penitentiary
three weeks ago . up to the present day. Upon leaving
army of detectives, public, private and other-
I wise, will have to drop the name of Richard
| Phclan from their lists of suspects and hunt
JJL elsewhere for some one on whom to fasten sus
picion of complicity in the Crockett bullion
robbery. Phelan Is now in this city, where he has just"
arrived from Sierra County. . He is staying at the Russ
House and his first act upon setting here was to tele
graph Warden Aguirre acquainting that gentleman with
his presence in San Francisco and informing the Warden
of his readiness to make any explanation that might be
required of him. He has succeeded in proving an alibi
so complete that it would be impossible to connect him
with the crime itself or the men who may have com
mitted it.
The name of Phelan first became subject to suspicion
from the fact that he was once working at Crockett and
because he was a paroled convict. It was further stated
that he was seen prowling about Crockett a short time
before the commission of the robbery. The crime for
which Phelan was sent to San Quentin was murder in
the second degree and there was never any stain on his
honesty. He ie not a professional criminal in any sense
of the word and he has established his whereabouts since
being given his parole to the complete satisfaction of
Warden Aguirre and other officials responsible for his
conduct- On the last day of July he reported to Warden
Aguirre from Sierra City, in compliance with the law
which compels a paroled prisoner to report to the
Warden of his prison at least once a month, and, as
soon as he heard of the crime and the fact of his re
ported connection with it he sent Warden Aguirre the

tend that they have broken no contract

â¢Duty to Federation.
Many of the firemen are of the opinion
that the members of the union should
have remained' faithful to the shipping
firm. These men made a strong fight at
the meeting to prevent the passage of the
resolution calling them out. but their ef
forts were unavailing. The men who fa
vored breaking the agreement argued
strongly that their duty was to stand by
the federation and support it in its every
move. Â¦
Captain >linor Goodall when seen yes
terday was very wroth over the turn af
fairs had taken. He said:
"This shows us what faith we can in
future place in any agreement signed â¢' by
labor .unions. We had an agreement witn
the Sailors' Union along the same lines
and they had no hesitancy in breaking, it.
The firemen held out for a week and we
were under the impression that they
would stand firm. The pressure was too
strong. It seems, and they also broke faith
with us. It was due, of course, to the
gathering of men here since the strike
commenced and the fact that the men
employed by^us'were not strong enough
numerically to defeat the measure. .
"We will not let it pass by unnoticed.
Such a slap is' a little too hard for us to
bear and in a day or so we will appeal
to the law for redress. The union- has
$20,000 and I think we can make it pay
for their violation of an agreement which
we have kept faithfully. If the funds are
not available we will "try" and find" out
what has become of them. It is an in
corporated body and as such is amenable
for the damage it has done this com
pany." . .. ,
Number of Men Affected. -
The order of the Firemen's Union calls
out about one hundred men. The vessols
of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
fleet, with the number of men affected,
are: Â¦ ' > Â¦'Â¦' -
Umatllla. 9 firemen and 9 coal passers;

All of these vessels with the exception
of the Walla Walla, the Pomona and the

reach port unless the leaders of the strike
manage .to. reach them at a way. port

TjT^v TJRING a small riot which oc-
curred early yesterday morning
II in the vicinity of the Oregon dock
lM**Jr William Hootan, a negro non
union stevedore, was shot in the
'right shoulder. Although the wound has
not proved fatal "it is considered serious,
as the bullet glanced from the shoulder
blade and lodged near the spinal column.
When the fight began Hootan, who has
been employed at the Pacific Mail dock
as a truckman since the inception of the
stevedores', strike, was on his way to
work. He was accompanied by Charles
Black, a negro friend from Oakland, who
was going to the dock to seek employ
ment. Â¦'While crossing Front street near
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany dock they were confronted by a mob
of strikers, who inquired where they
were "going. On Hootan's replying that It
was none of their business the strikers
commenced to hurl stones at them. The
negroes claim that they were struck by
several of the missiles, upon which Hoot
an drew his revolver and fired two shots
In the direction of the mob. The bullets
failed to take effect, and Instead of dis
persing the mob only served to Increase
its anger. One of the strikers .finally
drew his revolver and" fired at the two
non-union men. striking Hootan in the
back of his right shoulder.
Hootan did not know that he had been
shot, but supposed when the bullet struck
him that he had been hit by a stone. Not
until he had reached the Mall dock and
had his coat removed did he know that a
bullet had entered his shoulder. An am
bulance was summoned and the injured
man was removed to the. Harbor Hos
pital. Subsequently the patient was trans
ferred to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where with thÂ«? aid of the X-ray it was
discovered that the bullet had lodged r.ear
the spinal column.
Father and Son Beaten.
John T, Hayes, contractor, of ISX^PA

the arrest of five striking teamsters on

drives a team for the "Whittier-Coburn
Company and while father and son were
on their way home Tuesday night they
were attacked by live men and severely
beaten with slungshots. brass knuckles
and fists. They were near their home
when attacked. The men had been hang

afternoon.
NEGRO MEETS AWFUL DEATH.
Continued From Page One.
According to agreement about 500 team
sters, the entire strength of the Sand
Teamsters* Union, with the exception of
the men who were in the employ of the
street - cleaning department, . remained
away from their work yesterday morn
ing. As far as the leaders know there
was not a single deserter. The effect on
the building industry was not imme
diately felt, as in many cases the con
tractors had taken the precaution to
provide an extra supply of sand and brick.
Its, is thought by the sand teamsters that
whatever extra supply may have been
laid in will be speedily exhausted and
that by to-night the majority of the 5000
mechanics who are engaged in the build
ing trades throughout the city will have
to be laid off. Unless non-union men with
police protection can be obtained work on
buildings now under construction and
all street work will have to be suspended.
Lumber yards and brick yards will suffer,
heavily becapse of the strike.-
The sand teamsters determined to call
the street cleaners out in order to make
the strike as binding and as burdensome
upon employers as possible. In doing
this they believe that the trouble will be
the sooner adjusted. They state that they
entertain no grievances against their em
ployers, but that they recognize the strike
to be a fight for the preservation of tho
union principle and that in the flght per
sonal considerations must be forgotten.
As the Sand Teamsters' Union embraces
almost all the men engaged in that line
of work, and as the teamsters almost
without exception own their, teams-, the
contractors have* small chance of secur
ing non-union help. Even if the non
union teamsters are obtained it will be
-impossible for them to work unless pro
tected by the police. The entire available
police force of the city is being used to
guard the expressmen and truck drivers
and it therefore appears certain that the
streets will not be swept nor the dust
laid to-day.
Harry N. Gray of Gray Brothers, which
firm has the greater part of the street
cleaning contract, said last night that he
had not as yet decided whether to at
tempt to employ non-union help or to let
the streets remain uncleaned.
AT a meeting? of the "Sand Team
sters' Union, held last night at
1159 Mission street, it was decided
that no exception should be made
in regard' to the men who are in
the employ of tho street-cleaning con
tractors, but that every member of thu
union should be called out on the strike.
To-day, unless the men who have the con
tracts for cleaning the streets can secure
non-union teamsters, the thoroughfares
of the city will remain unswept and un
sprinkled.
The union's action reverses the action
of the executive committee of the Labor
Council, taken Tuesday night, in making
an exception of the men employed in tho
street cleaning department. . â¢ .

asked whether the Federation of T^abor
will lend financial assistance to the
striking steel workers, Vice â President

Striking Steel Workers.
How Labor Union Could Help tha
AID OF THE FEDERATION.
The sales department of the American
Sheet Steel Company has given notice to
jobbers that it cannot take any orders for
some time, as the capacity of the operat
ing sheet mills has been contracted for.
The continuation of the strike and the
fact that it is to be extended to greater
proportions augmented the scramble that
has been on in Pittsburg for two weeks
to secure sheet tin plates. A canvass of
the jobbers developed that the supply of
both sheets and tin plate is rapidly run
ning behind the demand, and especially
in tin plate. The American Tin Plate
Company has not changed its quotations
of $4 25 per box, but the consumers have
paid this week as high as $5 50 per box for
immediate delivery. The combine price
for sheets is 560 per ton. but $70 and 575
have been paid for sheet available at
once. The independent mills are reaping
a harvest. They are taking contracts at
prices as high in some cases as $70 a ton
for future delivery.
Secretary Joseph Bishop of the Ohio
Board of Arbitration is in town and Is
visiting several of : the combine officials,
it is said. In the interest of another con
ference. He refused to discuss his move
ments, saying he was here on other than
steel organization affairs.
"There are no union mills making struc
tural steel or iron, and all our men have
been working the material furnished them
and will continue doing so. If there was
one union mill making the material used
by us we would possibly act differently.
I took this matter up with President
Shaffer two years ago, but he did not see
then of what benefit an alliance with our
organization would be to the mill work
ers."
The action of the structural Ironwork
ers was tersely outlined by J. W. Pryall.

Ironworkers' Union, who said to-day:

can get the Vandergrift men away from
their environment, very little trouble will
be found in bringing them Into the as
sociation. â¢ . . .
In discussing the plan of the trust. As
sistant Secretary M. F. Tlghe said:
"That effort will not extend very far,
because there are only a few skilled men
available, and before enough can be
trained to operate mills snow will be
pretty thick. A move of that kind might
be made in Bessemer or open hearth
steel mills, but In a Bheet mill, where the
skill required Is of the highest order, the
filan cannot do anything except ultimate
y fall. A sort of showing may be made
for a time, but it will not last long."
Archbishop Ireland is in Hartford,
Conn., to-night and could not be seen.
He went there this afternoon, and la ex
pected to return to the Fifth Avenue
Hotel to-morrow.
Walsh said that in all probability the
Archbishop would also see Senator Hanna
and endeavor to obtain his assistance In
the matter.
Michael Walsh, a close friend of Arch
bishop Ireland, when seen at his resi
dence at Fort Hamilton last night, as
serted positively that the Archbishop is
taking steps to obtain a settlement of the
strike through the intercession of Presi
dent McKinley. Â«
"I have not seen Archbishop Ireland
in five weeks," said Walsh, "but I have
been in communication with him. He is
now with President McKinley, or is about
to visit him in the intertst of the steel
workers. Any one who knows Archbishop-
Ireland's position In labor matters will
understand that he cannot remain quiet
and allow this strike to go on without
making an effort to obtain an agreement
by mediation."

wide and his sympathies are broad. He

McKinley. These were the reasons that
an appeal was made to Archbishop Ire
land by Roman Catholic dignitaries who
realized the gravity of the present situa
tion.
Plan Is Found Feasible.
This plan was tested the first time this
week and was found to be feasible, so far
as the mills at Hyde Park and Wellsville
go, and it has been decided to adopt It so
far as the sheet and hoop mills are con
cerned.
Plans for the starting of the closed tin
plate mills have not been contemplated.
In this branch the situation is different.
The tin plate company has only six of
its 232 roll trains going, while the sheet
company has a few less than half.
The officials of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation say this movement will in a meas
ure play into their hands. At McKees
port President Shaffer said that he him
self would lead from Vandergrift into the
No Overtures Will Be Made.
So far as President C. M. Schwab is
concerned no overtures will be made by
the trust to the workers. In a talk with
a Pittsburg man in New York yesterday
he said: "We have made our last proposi
tion to the Amalgamated Association,
and will now proceed to start our works.
President Shaffer makes this counter
statement: "The next proposition must
come from the United States Steel Cor
poration officials." ,
Thus the two stand. It seems as if only
outside efforts can bring them together.
The trust officials have decided to go
ahead slowly in the matter of starting
mills and to do so with as little publicity
as possible.
The strongholds of the sheet company
are the mills at Vandergrift, the largest
in the country; Lieechburg, Apollo and
Scottdale. It has been decided to take
as many skilled men away from these
places as possible without retarding oper
ations there and start the mills where
there is the least danger of an outbreak.
The places left vacant at the mills men
tioned will be filled with men deserving of
promotion and they wllJ be given better
positions. This movement will be under
taken slowly and with caution. The plan

Amalgamated Association Succeeds in Closing the Big' Plant at

Partly Breaks the Strike at the Clark Mill in Pittsburg
PITTSBURG, Aug. 7.â In the big
steel strike honors are- eaay in
this section to-night. The Amal
gamated Association succeeded in
closing down the big steel plant
at Newcastle, and the manufacturers
partly broke the strike at the Clark mill
In this, city. Neither side Is exulting, nor
is there* any expression of discouragement.
Up to this hour not the slightest trouble
has occurred at any point in this imme
diate territory and the Amalgamated of
ficials are correspondingly happy, because
this condition would seem to be the car
rying out of the association's new de
parture In the handling of the strike situ
ation. The quiet. waiting of the strikers
may be one of the surprises hinted at by
the national officers. From one or two
points the strikers are reported as rest
less and eager for action, but so far they
have kept faith with their leaders and re
frained . from committing any breach' of
the peace.
The United States Steel Corporation, it
was learned to-day from an official source,

strike-breakers will be trained and then
sent out to the mills that are closed.
Seattle Coroner Finds
Ghastly Evidence of "
a Crime.
Grewsome Indications That a
.Young Girl Was Mur
dered*
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Â¦ SEATTLE, Aug. 7,â Seattle's list of un
solved murder mysteries was, increased
t*"-day by a discovery made yesterday but
carelessly pigeonholed by the police. By
mere accident the Coroner heard of the
case and after he had made an official in
vestigation did not hesitate to say that a
brutal murder had been committed. â¢
The victim was a young girl and her
body was chopped to pieces and then
buried. in an old trunk eight miles Bouth
of Seattle. The trunk was discovered
during' the grading for the new race
course. At the time the trunk was burled
that part of the county was a lonely spot
and as the place of burial was not very
far from the banks of the Duwamlsh
River the murderer could have- safely
rowed to the bank, burled his victim and
then escaped In the darkness;
Coroner Hoye says it would be impos
sible to have got the body into the. trunk
except by cutting It to pieces. From
the appearance of -the bones the Coroner
Is satisfied that the murderer, after
brutally killing his victim, cut , her body
and it In the trunk in order that
he would have- an opportunity to leave
the country. Clinging to the bones was
cloth which was at first thought to be a
remnant of a gunny sack. It was ob
served that the cloth was closely woven,
which leads the Coroner to believe that
the cloth was a blanket. '.There was hair
on the skull and there was evidence that
it had been abundant and ,of auburn or
reddish color. The hair was thickly
matted about the skull.
After ascertaining all possible facts in
the case Coroner Hoye destroyed the
trunk and the skull and larger bones of
the body were brought to the city. The
rest were buried not far from the race
track.
"There is not the least bit of doubt that
an awful crime was committed." said
Coroner Hoye. "The bones are those of
a young girl, I should say not over four
teen years of age. The trunk in which
they were found was so small that it
would be impossible to place the body
there without first cutting it to pieces*.
The body had evidently been buried about
four years.'!
Another' Body Found in the Buins.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 7. â Another
body was found to-day in the ruins of
Monday night's explosion in Locust street,
making a total of eight fatalities as a re
sult of the disaster. The body found to
day was that of an unknown negro about
50 years of age. His remains were found
sitting upright in a chair in the debris of
the Jones restaurant. It is believed that
all the victims have now been recovered.

Another clew wliich the detectives are
trying to run down has an Eastern color
to it and the men concerned are suppose!
to be fake Insurance solicitors. For some
days these men have been in the neigh
borhood, hanging around the barrooms.
This has gone on until Monday, since
which time they have disappeared. On
this also are the detectives Â¦ ruminating.
The theories of escape are Tailing back
gradually to the original opinion that
water furnished the medium. At first it
was generally thought that the gold
bricks left on the rocks was a ruse to in
dicate falsely that the hurried departure
was by boat. Now the conjecture prac
tlcers will have it that a double-cross was
intended by the robbers â that by leav.ng
the gold their pursuers would imagine
that they did this to divert the suspicion
of a water escape v.-V.
Then come all sorts of rumors'from the
smelting works. It is whispered about
that one high in authority is watched
carefully by the detectives and that he
has been called to San Francisco, but
Superintendent von der Ropp denies this.
He says that no suspicion Is cast upon
any of the employes occupying posirfcnis
of trust and confidence. Every day the
belief grows stronger and stronger that
some one who was close to the Inner
workings of the business at the works
was implicated in the crime. The exact
and precise knowledge of the underlying
conditions and circumstances connected
with the deposit of the gold in the vaults
has impressed many with an indelible be
lief In the guilt of some trusted employe.
The police are certainly keeping all under
a quiet, unnoticed surveillance. . .. â¢ Â¦

and had eight men in his service. He had
not been near the Selby works since he
left the penitentiary. He had purchased
a pump for his mine some time ago, but
found it 'was too small and he came to
the city to purchase a larger pump. Tha
first thing he knew about the robbery was
when he saw it in the papers yesterday
morning when he reached Port Costa on
the train coming to the city. He was
stopping at the Russ House and thought
that in Justice to himself his statement
should be made known. He was also in
censed that his name should have . been

A. B. Cummins has been a conspicuous

In 1892 he was made temporary chairman
of the Republican State Convention as an
assurance to the anti-prohibitionists that
Â¦ they would no longer be proscribed by the
'Republican party. Next year he was a
candidate for United States Senator, mak
ing .many friends, bufJohn H. Gear was
elected. -In 1896 he was made a member
pf the Republican National Committee. A
/very popular speaker, he has been con
spicuous In nearly every campaign and
: has. won numerous admirers, Â¦who follow
him â¢with intense devotion. His second
campaign for the Senatorshlp, two years
ago, in which he was again defeated by
John H. Gear, resulted in the formation
of a powerful organization in his interest.
Cummins is a successful lawyer. He was
born in Pennsylvania In 1850. His ulti

Cummins. 860: Trewln. 369V&; Harriman,
359%; Conger. 42; Herriott. 8; Mahon. 2.
The nomination of Cummins was made
unanimous.
The members of the steering commit
tee, who had decided to make their fight
with Haniman as their candidate, came
into the convention in bad political odor.
The morning break of the Herriott rem
nant had convinced them that they had
little chance. The first blow they received
was when the Cummins men took control
of the committee on permanent organiza
tion. The steering committee had counted
with confidence on organizing the conven
tion and had declared over and over again
that their best chance for -winning with
Harrlman lay in this direction. When
once they had the organization, they said,
they would proceed to name the nominees.
They failed utterly to place their men In
the make-up of the regular organization,
and when Permanent Chairman Byera,
who Is a strong Cummins man, took up
the official gavel his first blow drove homo
the last nail In the coffin of the commit
tee. They had previously been knocked
out of the report of the credentials com
mittee and from that time on It was sim-'
ply a question of waiting for the heasse
that would carry them away. The ballot
showed: . ..
In Bad Political Odor.
Cummins swept the board. He and his
followers took everything- that they went
for, and from the first rap of the gavel
to the putting out of the lights there was
no time when they did not have the sit
uation well In hand. They had a hard
fight before the committee on credentials
in the effort to save the delegations of
Jackson and Carroll counties and came
from the - committee-room beaten men.
They expected to have six out of eleven
members of the committee, but in the
morning caucus they fell one short of that
number and the vote in the committee
went against them in both cases by a
vote of five to f slx. This defeat was of no
particular consequence, however, as they
had the strengrth the floor of the con
vention to seat their men â¢whenever the
question came up. They won their light
on the first ballot taken In the conven
tion and from that time to the finish there
was sewr the slightest doubt of the ulti
mate result-
With the above ticket the Republicans
of Iowa will go into the next State cam

unknown. This action was upon the be

not confined in Jail. From their vacillat

UNIONS' ORDERS ADD SIK HUNDRED MORE MEN TO FORCES CAMPAIGNING
YESTERDAY the Democratjo
camp was thrown into a state of
agitation by a rumor that Chris
Buckley, an . old-time leader and
boss of the party, had arrived
in the city to manage the municipal cam
paign for the Democrats. The report rel
ative to Buckley's presence in the city is
true, but according to his own declaration
his sojourn has no political significance.
Speaking of the report that he was on the
ground to take a hand in the primary
election contest he said:
"I am here attending to business affairs
and have met many of my old friends. I
have no intention or desire to mix up
in "political affairs. In fact. I am out of
politics and it Is my purpose to stay out,
despite all reports to the contrary. I am
a Democrat and of course wish that party
success in the municipal election, but am
not advising it3 leaders how to manage
the campaign."
Saratoga Democratic Club.
The Saratoga Democratic Club, James
F. Ford president -and Jesse A. Galland
secretary, has issued the following proc
lamation to voters of the Thirty-ninth
Assembly District:
The Saratosra Democratic Club earnestly
urges upon every voter Ahe necessity of per
forming- hl3 duty as a citizen hy participating
in the primary election to be held Tuesday,
August 13, 190L Primary elections in the past
have been dominated by the bosses, so that
honest men have had but little chance against
the frauds practiced by them, but this year a
different condition prevails. The new primary
law assures a fair count of every vote polled,
therefore there is no excuse for any citizen
absenting himself from the polls.
The Saratoga Democratio Club respectfully
submits for your kind consideration and sup
port a carefully selected list of delegates. Said
delegates are not In any way directly or In
directly holding positions of any kind under
the municipal government, hence they are ab
solutely unpledged and In no way subject to
the dictation of the Phelan-McNab- machine.
If elected they will be free to fearlessly exer
cise their best judgment In ..the selection of
candidates that will correct and eradicate the
abuses that have sprung up under the so
called Democratic administration, to the grlev- "
ous disappointment of alt friends of good gov
ernment. They favor the municipal owner
ship of water, gas, etc., and the operation of
the same in the interests of the whole people;
the Issuance of bonds necessary to raise suffi
cient funds to purchase and construct gas and
water -works and to complete a modern sewer
system, modern school houses and well-paved
streets, etc., etc. The re-enactment of the
Chinese exclusion law, the selection of an in
dependent county committee in touch with the
sentiment of the party at large and not-ren
dered subservient to a clique of office-holders
through the distribution of public patronage,
contrary to the spirit of civil service. Civil
service honestly conducted may be a good
thing, but the spoils system, under the guise
of civil service, is the worst of all spoil sys
tems.
The list of delegates put forward by the.
Saratoga Democratic Club will have opposed
to them a set of delegates selected and backed
up by the City Hall crowd, with public pat
ronage and solitical assessments to assist them.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.â Judge A. H.
Humphreys of the First United States Cir
cuit Court, Hawaii; to-day had a confer
ence with. Attorney General Knox. Some
time ago the Bar Association of Hawaii
filed a complaint against Judge Humphreys
alleging, ; among other things, ; arbitrary
-and Â¦ unjust . treatment ' of . members of the
bar, and . specifying the arrest i of ,, three
well-known attorneys -upon a charge : of
contempt of court.* The sentence, ' how
ejver, -was not executed, and subsequently
the accused were pardoned by,, the ',- Gov
ernor. On .the other hand, it -'is- said a
large number of letters have been received
here testifying to the uprightness and in
tegrity.of Judge -Humphreys.; and other
testimony ! bearing I upon â¢ the case is # ex
pected, very "soon: * It is. expected that the
Bar Association "of 'Hawaii will .follow
their complaint 'Â¦ by formal charges, and
then the matter will "Â« be taken up i by - the
Department of Justice and disposed of.
It is . intimated by persons in : a position
to have knowledge on the subject that the
complaints against Judge Humphreys are
a result of "the antagonism that has ex
isted for some time between the new Fed
eral officials: and ,the=.old' regime. .Judge
Humphreys will remain' some days. r

HAVANA, Aug. 7.â The Union of To
bacco Buyers of Havana was recently
asked by the Merchants' Union to give an
opinion as to the. duties levied â¢ in the
United States upon Cuban tobacco. : The
reply was to the effect that the duty on
cigars should be reduced ;.to $2 50 per
pound in-espective of value and r that the
duties on . wrappers and^ fillers should \ be
reduced 20 and 30 cents, .respectively, per
pound. A long . preamble asserts ; that
Cuba, if she does not cbtain concessions
to which she has a perfect right, in view
of the fact that she is under th& economic
as well as the political protection of the
United States, should ask for/annexation.
"This the United. States would grant,",
the preamble goes on to say, "as it would
be in conformity with the desire'of a ma
jority of the American people. /Thus 5 the
successful opposition of the sugar and to
bacco interests of -the '.United; States to
granting concessions to Cuba . would not
only result in the ruin of these two inter
ests, since with annexation Cuba '.would
have free trade, and this would mean the
overthrow of the sugar, and - tobacco in
dustries in the States." - - - > -. - Â¦Â¦- .

Strikers Patrol the Bay With. Launch
; Movements of vessels and freight on the
water front are still at a standstill. There
was little accomplished yesterday by the
'shipowners, while the strikers were de
cidedly active. The men who are out on
strike have a., launch and a fleet of white
hall boats patrolling the bay. The owners
of vessels -for several days past have
been transferring non-union longshore
men from wharf to wharf by means of
tugs, thus practically rendering the ef
forts of the- shore pickets useless. The
launch William "VV. was hired yesterday
by the federation and manned with a
crew of union sailors. By means of the
launch they are able closely to observe
the movements of the men who are doing
their work and gain an intimate knowl
edge of the progress made by, the green i
hands injoading the ships.
Boatman Crowley was kept busy yes
terday landing non-union crews on ves
sels that had been tied up since the In
ception of the strike. He succeeded in
placing a number of men on the steamers
Robert Dollar and Enterprise and the
schooner Alexander. The Enterprise,
which was laid up in Oakland Creek for
some time, was hauled to the Oakland
long wharf yesterday and the work
of loading her commenced. In moving
her from her anchorage in the creek both
anchors and many fathoms of chain were
lost.
The unloading of the collier Tellus is
proceeding very slowly. Two full gangs
are at work in her holds but they do not

BY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY LEAGUE
EUREKA, Aug. 7.â Although the Long
shoremen's Union made desperate efforts
to tie up the steamship Pomona in this
port to-day that steamer, through the as
sistance of the butter shippers' of Eel
River Valley and a few millmen, succeed
ed in takiffg on a cargo of butter and cat
tle. It was not, however, until 5 p. m.
that the Pomona finished loading and was
able to continue her trip. Throughout the
day the members of the union were ex
tremely active. Their efforts were not
without success. The crew of the steamer
was first induced to quit work. A num
ber of creamery hands from the valley
were then put to work. These laborers
were also persuaded to throw up. their
jobs. At last the butter shippers them
selves and the officers of the boat took
off their coats and finished loading freight.
George B. Hall, the association's shipping
agent, one of the volunteer freight hand
lers, slipped and broke his leg. The
steamer Eureka will arrive to-morrow
and will receive the same reception from
the union that the Pomona experienced.

ps-npiHE Oceanic Steamship Company's
II Australia got away on ti'me yes
{ terday morning for Tahiti. The
JJL freight was all aboard Tuesday
afternoon and steam was raised
in the main boiler. A full non-union crew
Â¦was aboard, and the vessel could have
gone to sea Tuesday night. At 9:45 a. m.
yesterday the first signal was given, and
a quarter of an hour later the lines were
being cast off and then in a few minutes
the steamship was under ?/ay.
The mail boat did not take away many
passengers, and in consequence there was
not a big crowd down to see her away.
Among those who went out in the cabin
Trere: Mons. E. Tabanau. wife, son and
daughter; A. Roiand, F. Souls. J. Lamb
Doty, George Arsini and wife, S. Idles,
James May and Mons. Malarde. The Aus
tralia also took away eight steerage pas
sengers and a fair general cargo. The
work of loading the same company's Mar
iposa begins to-day, and she is expected
to sail on time Saturday.
STEAMSHIP FOR LUMBER TRAD2
Building in the East.
Steel Vessel for Tillamook Run Now
Swayne & Hoyt are about to try an in
novation in the coast trade. The opinion
has been general for years that an iron
or steel vessel was not suitable for the
coast lumber business, but there ha's al
ways been a few who contended that a
steel vessel would prove superior to a
wooden one whenever tested. Swayne &
Hoyt have ju:.t entered into a contract
with a Toledo. Ohio, firm that will settle
the dispute. The new boat is to be of
steel throughout, with a cellular bottom.
180 feet long. 38 feet beam. 14 feet deep
and to have water tanks to carry 3nO tons
of ballast. She will draw twelve feet
when loaded with Â£00,000 feet of lumber,
and will have a guaranteed speed of ten
knots. The new boat is to be ready for
the spring trade and will run between
here and Tillamootc, taking the place of
the steam schooner Tlllamook, that was
wrecked in Alaskan waters some months
ago. A name for the new boat has not
yet been decided upon, but the chances
are that It also will be christened Tilla
mook.
Loading the Enterprise.
The steamship Enterprise, purchased by
Captain William Matron a few days ago.
is now loading at Long Wharf, Oakland,
for Hilo. Her cargo is being rapidly put
aboard and the vessel probably v;ill get
away next Monday. Captain F. C. Miller,
who* brought the enterprise out here* from
New York, will remain in command, and
mans* of the old crew will remain by the
ehip. While the Enterprise was being
moved from the creek to the Long Wharf
she lost an anchor and chain, but both
will be recovered by a tug without any
trouble.
Water Front Notes.
The transport "Warren was scheduled to
arrive from Puget Sound yesterday, but
the chances are that it will be thret;
weeks before she reaches this port. Her
machtnerv requires overhauling, and just
as the vessel was ready to sail for San
Francisco a telegram came saying the of
fer of the Taeama machine shops to do
the work had been accepted. Consequent
ly the transport went to Tacoma Instead
of coming here. It will take about fifteen
days to overhaul her engines.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany's Aconcagua will sail to-day for
Central and South American ports. She
will not carry passengers, as she has no
American license.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company
Is going to establish a new line between
Panama and Acapulco as a feeder to the
Valparaiso-San Francisco line. The
steamship Toboga is lo be put on the
route this month. Hitherto the company's
boats have only gone as far north as
Ocos.

The judgments heretofore handed down
sustaining the :. constitutionality , of the
civil, service provisions of the charter
have been augmented by an opinion filed
yesterday 'by Judge Murasky. The court
holds thai the commission is not special
in its nature, hence is not within the con
stitutional provision prohibiting the dele
gation to any "special commission" the
power of performing municipal functions.
The point decided was raised in the ac
tion instituted by Al Lewald, a special
deputy in the office of the Tax Collector,
to compel Treasurer Brooks to audit his
demand on the treasury for compensation
for work performed for a period exceed
ing sixty days â the tenure of his appoint
ment. In a former decision Judge Mu
rasky held that as Lewald was appointed
under the provision of the charter author
izing the appointment of special deputies
"for. a term not exceeding sixty days" he
was only entitled to compensation for six
ty days' work, and even though he held
over, to await the appointment of his suc
cessor it must be held that the labor per
formed for a greater period than sixty
days was performed gratuitously. In his
opinion Judge Murasky says: Â¦
In addition to the points raised and disposed
of on the hearing: of the motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the petitioner now argues
that in creating the Civil Service Commission
and prescribing its duties the Legislature vio
lated section 13 of article XI of the constitu
tion, which provides, among other things, that
the Legislature shall not delegate to any "spe
cial commission" the power - to perform any
municipal function. But the Civil Service Com
mission is not a "SDecial" commission. It is
part of the municipal government, and no
more a special body, within the meaning of
the constitutional inhibition, than is the Board
of Public Works, or the Park or Police Com
mi%Mon. The context of section 13 makes it
evident that the purpose of the constitution is
to prevent the performance of any public duty
or function by a "private corporation, com
pany, association or individual," or by any
commission which would not be part of thÂ»
municipal eovernment. The power exercised
by the Civil Service Commission, however, is
power exercised by the municipal government
Itself, through one of its constituent parts, and
not power, delegated to a special body.
Shortly after her arrival at the Royal
House Sprague alleged that Turpin,
through promises of gold and favors, won
away the affections of "Mrs. Sprague."
The "wrong" done him. he said, could
only be atoned for by Turpin at an ex
pense to him of 560.000. After the filing of
the suit Sprague frequently made offers
for a compromise â in fact, Turpin avers,
demand was made upon him prior to the
filing of the suit.
While Turpin was pretending to con
sider the offers for a compromise the life
of the plaintiff and his "wife" was being
Investigated in the East at Turpin's di
rection. Affidavits were procured setting
forth that though it was true that
Sprague had married at the time and
place he stated and by the minister whom
he alleged in his complaint performed the
ceremony, the woman he married was not
the woman whose affections it was al
leged Turrin had alienated-
The affidavits set forth that he had
abandoned his wife, had taken up a sec
ond woman, abandoned her and was liv
ing, with the third woman, who was the
alleged Mrs. Sprague of fickle affections.
Sprague and "wife" became aware that
the investigation in the East had devel
oped the facts contained in the affidavits,
so they sought new fields of operation.
Turpin will forthwith take the case be
fore the Grand Jury and endeavor to se
cure Sprasue's indictment on a charge of
perjury, committed, it is alleged, when hs
verified the complaint which he thought
Â¦would bring a golden harvest from Tur
pin's coffers. Turpin refused to yield to
their demands, however. He was willing
that the facts in the case should becomo
public property, but Sprague and "wife"
departed v.hon the day of trial drew near.
Some months ago Spragxie filed suit. In
which his "wife" was joined as plaintiff,
against Turpin. He asserted that he mar
ried his "wife" in Maine in 1894 and came
to this city in 1835. where he obtaine'd em
ployment as a eoachmtin. Then he set
forth the details of his "cause for "action."
Ke said that his income was insufficient
to meet the home expenses. His "wife"
Â¦went out to seek employment and was
filially given a position by Turpin as a
maid in the Royal House.
Ernest E. Sprague and his "wife" have
abandoned the city and their suit against
F. L. Turpin. proprietor of the Royal
House, brought by Sprague to recover
JCO.000 damages for the alleged alienation
of "Mrs. Sprague's" affections. This suit
was dismissed yesterday on motion of H.
C. Firebaugh, plaintiff's attorney, who
stated that his clients had departed from
the jurisdiction of the court.

Catarrh is Inflammation of the mucous
membrane. It may be in the mucous
membrane lining the eyes or the pelvic
Professor Talfourd Smith, Principal Si-
loam High School, Siloam, Ga., writes: \
"With much pleasure 1 recommend Pe-
runa to all who may be suffering with
any trouble of the respiratory organs. I
have been using it in my family for the
past five or six years and find It to be
almost a household necessity. Peruna is
tru y a grand cztarrh remedy, and general
tonic and will do all that is claimed for it
by the manufacturers."â Prof, lalfourd
Smith.
organs, throat, stomach, liver, bowels or
kidneys.
Catarrh Is catarrh wherever located.
Peruna cures catarrh wherever located.
Pentna is an internal remedy, not a local
application.
Catarrh is a systemic disease, r.ot' a
local disease. If Peruna will cure ca-
tarrh in one place it will cure it in any
other place, because Peruna is a systemic
remedy. It reaches the disease through
the circulation in each organ. It eradi-
cates the disease* by eradicating it from
the system. â¢ . â¢ Â¦
Peruna eradicates catarrh from the sys-
tem in the same way that the practical
farmer eradicates weeds from his fields.
The sensible farmer does not think of cut-
ting- off the top of the weeds to kill them.
He pulls them up by the roots.
Dr. Hartman, the originator of Peruna,
has used this remedy for the last forty
years v/ith great success as a specific for
catarrh.
A free book, written by him will be sent
to any address. It contains the results of
his forty years' experience with Peruna
and will be found of great interest to
those afflicted with catarrh of any organ
of the body.
Mr. F. E. Brackett, Medford, Mass.,
writes:
"I have a bottle of Peruna and Mana-
lin in use in my house two-thirds cf tha
time. If I take it when feellrs a little in-
disposed it braces me rigrht up. and keeps
me" in such fine condition that I dorr't
catch cold, and that is life and happiness
to one of my business. I am a teamster
and when the membrane of my nose is
swollen at night after driving in our Cast
winds and foers. I take a dose of Peruna
on .fc'oing to bed at night and get up all
ris-ht in the mornlntr. Tt also makes the
blood circulate, and is sure death to rheu-
matism."â Mr. F. FJ. Brackett.
If you do not derive prompt and sat's-
factory results from the use cf Peruna
write at once to Dr. Hartman. giving 1 n
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratis.

In his letter. Mr. Reed says:. "I had great respect
for Mr. Wilson, because he had convictions and was
true to them. There^was something very pathetic in
his last struggle, death-struck as he was, with that
greatest of all human forces, popular feeling gone
wrong. That that feeling is doomed to revulsion does
not lessen its power. Human life is too short for the
vindication oHhe wise man while yet alive. Many

AMONG the appreciations which have been re
cently published concerning the late William
L. .Wilson is one in the publications of the
Southern History Association, to which is appended a
letter from Thomas B. Reed. During the, time Wil
son was the leader of the free traders in Congress he
had no opponent more forceful or more sarcastic
than the Republican, leader from Maine. They, were
not foes, however, but friends, and on many issues
held similar opinions. Consequently Mr. Reed's trib

Â¦>' . Editor San Francisco Call: So Governor Gage is coming
to San Francisco or has already arrived to settle the labor
strike! For years he has ridden the railroad wheel.' Now he
proposes to take a short trip, if he can only/steady himself, on
the labor Â¦ wheel. Of course this has nothing to do with the
primary election of next Tuesday!
' Yes! Gage is coming, or, in the terse language of the
announcement of Mose Gunst's arrival at New York, "has
came.". It is a wonder the gold In the pockets of local capital
ists or the brass in the 'faces of Kelly and Rainey doesn't melt
through the mere friction of his presence or intended presence.
, If ho "has came" at an opportune moment to wear Jimmy
Phelan's shoes and march the community to settlement nnd
peace it Is : the first time he has been " found where he was
wanted. During his administration he has been everywhere
except at his office. There the chief evidence of his official
existence has been letters from his secretaries informing
anxious correspondents that the Governor . was temporarily
absent, but that, on his return, his attention would be called
to matters of public business. Much of the time he has been
apparently sunk in luxurious apathy midst the soft and
languorous airs of the South. He has been heard from, how
ever, once in awhile, in the neighborhood of some mountainous
stream, where industrious anglers caught fish for his benefit.
He also popped into momentary view when the bubonic scare
was under headway. But on the average his appearances have
been usually noted when Burns or Kelly or some other political
boss pulled the string that, sets him in motion and. then, his
acrobatic feats have left the circus clowns out of sight.
The last place to look for Governor Gage is the State Capitol
at Sacramento, as a host of disgruntled citizens who labor
under the delusion that the chief executive of a State should
attend to business can gloomily attest. It is really gratifying
to know that the State Bird paused or Is about to pause in his
summer flight and is now temporarily perched or about to be
perched in San Francisco with his right claw on capital, his
left claw on labor and his hungry beak projected toward the
roxt municipal convention. From now . until next Tuesday
Scavenger Kelly and his aids will no .doubt work night and
day to prepare his nest.
I started the Governor on wheels and leave him on a perch.
Perhaps the wheels are now in his head.

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Comes to Town for the Purpose, but He Will Not Be So Deeply Engrossed
as to Neglect Boss Kelly and the "Push."
It must not be supposed that the professor is a pes
simist or an alarmist, or even a prophet of woe. . He
was careful to say that the extinction of the race will
not take place within any measurable time. Ages,
he says, must elapse before conditions become such
tha^ no animal life can survive on this sphere. That
much was said evidently by way of comfort, .but -the
professor concluded by saying: "The time is com
ing." That is what Chicago -got by asking outside
opinion about her weather. She would have done bet
ter to have consulted the oldest inhabitant.
The professor is quoted as saying: "The earth, of
course, is becoming old, and must, in the nature, of
things, reach the stage of decrepitude. ; The other ma
jor bodies in our solar systemâ Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune, the outer planets, and Mercury,
Venus and Mars, the inner planets â may have more
vitality remaining than we, and manage to keep within
their orbits, but we have no exact means of knowing
whether they do or not." . â¢ .
According to the. reports that come to us the pjo
fessor stated that the earth has slipped its trolley, so
to speak. It no longer holds to the old orbit. It
wobbles, and its course around the sun is becoming
more and more erratic, so that every summer â¢ it
approaches nearer the central orb than at the same
period of the previous year, and in the winter it gets
farther away. We are thus going'to have colder win
ters and hotter summers right along, until eventually
through a process of alternately baking and freezing
humanity will be eradicated from the planet and the
earth will have a rest. , â¢
PROFESSOR LUDWIG MARIENBURGER,
Pli. D., a graduate of the University of Berlin,
has been visiting Chicago. He wondered at
the tall buildings that rise about as high as he can see,
but when the thermometer went higher still he did
not wonder. In fact, he took the heat so coolly as
to excite attention. Knowing. him to be a wise and
learned man, the Chicago people concluded he had
some reason for his serenity under the 'scorching of
the hot wave, and a reporter sought him out in the
hope of. learning something that would please the
public. He was asked to give an explanation of the
weather, and he did so with great urbanity and scien
tific lore. Â¦

SETTLER OF THE LOCAL LABOR TROUBLES
MRS. DANE'S DEFENCE," at the
Columbia Theater, has so far
proven one of the most all-round
.successful engagements of this
or many seasons.- The play itself
is highly worthy, artistic in a high degree
and with strong Interests, both of tragic
and comic kind. The Empire Theater Com
pany, headed by Miss Margaret Anglin
.and Charles Rlchman, is a thoroughly
well-balanced organization and gives a
completely satisfactory interpretation of
the play. Miss-Anglin has added another
great success to her notable record in the
title role, showing a degree of emotional
power therein quite unsuspected, even by
her most ardent admirers. Mr. Richman
also is an eminently satisfactory figure,
delightfully voiced, one of the handsomest
leading men of the day and versed in all
the requirements of his art. Miss Hor
nlck, one of our own people, has delight
ed her many friends here by her good
work as Lady Eastney, and Margaret
Dale meets with the same favor as on her
previous appearance here with Mr. Mil
ler's company. The play will run for this
and next week and is' meeting with tho
heartiest appreciation. "Lady Hunt

Spong as Lady Huntworth, will follow.

The Tivoli's bills for this week are "II
Trovatore" and "Lucia," with admirable
performances of both the Verdi and Doni

makes one of the best gypsies ever heard
here and adds to her laurels in lavish
fashion. Salas3a, also in the "Trovatore"
cast, is heard to much advantage, and
Russo and Repetto as Edgardo and Lucia
do some of their best work. Russo in par
ticular is -singing admirably this season,
and the "Lucia" is certainly one of the
best things of the season so far. Next
week the new yrima donna soprano Linda
Montanari, and Agostlni, the new lyric
tenor, will be' heard in two. favorite op
eras, "La Favorita" â not given here be
fore for ten yearsâ and "Otello," with Sa

There remains Babcock's proposition. Mr. Bab
cock is himself a Republican, and therefore his fol
lowing is more formidable than it would otherwise
be. His demand for revision has something of the at
tractiveness of demagoguery about it because it is cal
culated to -appeal to those who are opposed to pro
tecting those industries which are largely under; the
control of trusts. It is of course well known that if any
tariff revision on an extensive scale should be under
taken the whole country would be once more har
assed by doubts as tc what industries would be af
fected and to what extent. The inevitable conse
quence would be a disturbance of business and an in
dustrial depression. To prevent that there should be
a resolute opposition tc Babcock's scheme. The one
phase of advice which American industries have to
give to Congress this winter will be, "Don't monkey
The plan of getting rid of protection by means of
reciprocity treaties is much more subtle than that of
making an open fight against it, and to that extent
is more formidable. Fortunately, the treaties now
before the Senate have been held up so long the peo
ple have had time to fairly understand them, and there
is good reason. to believe the Senate will refuse to
confirm them. Moreover, there have been repeated
declarations from industrial, commercial and agricul
tural bodies condemning not only these treaties but
the principle upon which they are founded, so that it
is not likely that much injury will be done to the pro
tective system in that way.
Of the three classes of assailants it is probable the
Babcock following is the most dangerous. The
avowed out-and-out free traders, notwithstanding their
revived vigor, are too utterly discredited to consti
tute much of a danger. Their league is said to be
increasing in numbers and their circulars are being
distributed far and wide; but the breaking down of
free trade even in Great Britain itself is too plain a
fact for them to overcome. The American people
will not vote for free trade if they know it, and con
sequently so long as the agitation is conducted under
that name it will not seriously disturb the country.
The new assault comes from three sources. First,
from the unteachable free traders, who have roused
themselves to fight the old battle over again in the
interests of the importers and others who make a
profit out of the importation of foreign goods, no
matter at what sacrifice to American industry. Sec
ond, from the supporters of the so-called reciprocity
treaties now before the Senate and which in their
nature are essentially different from the principle of
reciprocity as defined in the platforms of the Repub
lican party. Third, from the followers of Congress
man Babcock of Wisconsin, who are clamoring for
tariff revision this winter for the avowed purpose of
lowering in many instances the protective duties.
WHEN the people of the United States, under
the stress of the industrial depression caused
by the Democratic tariff, learned the value
of protection to American industries it was frequently
said there would not be a tariff agitation in this coun
try again during the life of this generation. The as
sertion seemed reasonable. With the enactment of
the Dingley tariff prosperity returned to the country
so promptly and in such abundant measure that hardly
any man could fail to note the significance of the
fact. Nevertheless, the protective principle is once
more assailed, and the assailants are sufficiently strong
to force the subject anew upon the minds of the
people.
FURTHER TARIFF AGITATION.
LEADING LADY AND THE LEADING MAN OF THE EMPIRE THEATER
COMPANY, NOW PRESENTING IN THIS CITY* HENRY ARTHUR
JONES' PLAY, "MRS. DANE'S DEFENCE."
If the daring robbers who operated with such
signal success at Vallejo Junction have done nothing
else they have given to the trade of the seller of gold
bricks in this State a tremendous boom. Anybody
who wants to sell a gold brick should have now an
excellent chance to find a purchaser.
Some one who knows the subject and is willing to
give to it his time and talents could probably con
vince the lawmakers that California is sacrificing her
climate, the fertility of her soil, the happiness of her
people and the opportunities of all the future by per
mitting the wanton destruction of her forests. Travel
ers who are crossing the Sierras by rail this month
look out upon the blue garment of smoke that covers
the entire range. It gives a charming tone to the
distance and blends the foreground scenery more
softly than the artist's brush can imitate. Many who
see it say, "How charming! What a beautiful blue
haze!" But the man who knows the mountains knows
the great cost at which that charming effect is secured.
He sees in the distance the relentless fire sweeping
down bosky canyons, putting to martyrdom hundreds
of thousands of fine trees, sparing none, and in its
great heat shriveling the green herbage and copse,
laying bare the little streams and licking up their
waters. He sees the fawn caught in the fiery furnace
and nesting birds killed while they brood their young,
and everything from the cooing dove to the crooked
snake wiped out of existence, to make the ineffable
lacework of this lovely, haze. â¢ He sees the splitting
rocks and baked earth, and the germs of future forests
roasted and destroyed. He sees the sun blazing down
on white ashes where lately rested the grateful shade,
and jn farther perspective he sees the perished rill
and stream and river and the blear desert encroaching
v)here vineyards purpled, and the grain billowed in
the wind. â¢ He sees '. destruction and drought, all \ to
make the fairy scene of a month. It is wasteful, piti
ful and wrong. That itfgoe's ,'o'n unchecked is but a
poor compliment to t ;the wisdom of our people. X.
WHILE men are quarreling and contending
about the distribution of the developed re
sources of the earth elements within man's
control and man himself are joined in stripping the
earth of its fertility. While the Sempervirens Club is
camping in thÂ£ redwoods of the Big Basin and con-,
certing measures to put a few hundred acres of tim-.
ber into public ownership, the fires in the vast forests
of the Sierra Nevada are destroying thousands of
acres of timber that is far more important to Califor
nia than that of the Big Basin.
So much other exciting matter has occupied pub
lic attention during the summer that it is not generally
understood that the forest fires in this State have been
more numerous, general and destructive than ever be
fore. It is an anomaly that as the economic uses of
timber increase and their demands grow larger, and
the commercial attack upon the forests is every year
greater, their destruction by fire outruns their use by
man. k
The forests of the Rocky Mountains have suffered
this year more than ever, and the arid West, that needs
forest protection for its water sources, is going far
ther from fertility every day.
The pulp mills are increasing and the consumption
of timber suitable for paper is making great strides.
The demand for railroad ties advances. No substitute
for timber has been found for ties. Stone and steel
have both been tried, and failed. The tie must have
some elasticity, and no bolt or. screw fastening the
steel riyl to a metal tic has been found equal to the
spike held by /wood fiber? r "
Railway statistics show the following. consumption
of ties: â¢ . - ' , . '
Ties, in use ..I.............. 780,000,000
Annual renewals ..., 112,000,000
Annual cost of ties â: JCO,000,000
Required for next twenty years ......... 3,000,000,000
Let 'any log sealer sit down and estimate the acre
age required for that supply of ties alone and then
reflect that instead of increasing to keep pace with the
demand our forest area is shrinking and shriveling in
the fire.
What seems, to be needed is some man in the Leg
islature who will make a specialty of forest legisla
tion.

THE RAILROAD IN POLITICS.
It is time for Mr. Hays to hold a heart-to-heart talk
with himself and decide whether he is going to en
force obedience to his orders or not. He knows that
the Post is the property of the Southern Pacific
Company. He knows that -the company makes
a monthly payment to the support of the
paper and directs its policy. The Southern
Pacific Company has, in fact, full authority and
control of the Post and can compel it to be decent
or suppress it or sell it, as seems best to the managers
of the road. With these facts the people of San Fran
cisco are iamiliar, and if Mr. Hays deems that he can
leave Herrin. and the Post free to combine with Kelly
in doing the dirty work of predatory politicians, and
at the same time persuade the public that his -order
requiring Southern Pacific officials to abstain from
partisan activity is valid, he will fool himself but he
will not fool the people.
If Mr. Hays has any regard for the reputation, he
is to bear in California it will be well for him to give
his attention to the serious discrepancy between his
statements and orders and the actions of W. F. Her
rin and the articles of the Post. The people are not
going to be deceived. They are aware that the Post
is owned by the railroad, that its utterances are dic
tated by the railroad, and that it would not now be
supporting Boss Kelly if orders from the railroad had
not been given for it to do so.
, Some time ago Mr. Hays assured the people of
California that the Southern Pacific Company was not'
to interfere in politics. A little later the assurance
was followed by the issue of an order forbidding rail
road officials to take part in politics. So far as the
public is aware that order has never been recalled, and
yet the Evening Post, which belongs to the railroad
company, is now as actively engaged in supporting
political bosses as ever in its history.
That the bosses should make use of these utterances
of the railroad organ is not strange. They are making
a desperate struggle to retain their power in muni
cipal politics and any aid that comes is welcome to
them. It is strange, however, that the Post should
have published such articles or have in any other way
openly manifested the activity of Herrin and the
Southern Pacific Company on the side of the dis
reputable bosses and predatory politicians.
|-v Y the Kelly, Gage and Herrin committee there
Iâ y has been printed and distributed throughout
*âJ- the city a dodger containing a number of edi
torials on municipal politics which originally appeared
in the Evening Post, the organ of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company. There are three of these
editorials, each and all of them being abusive of the
Republican Primary League . and of the efforts now
being made by genuine Republicans to drive the cor
rupt bosses out of politics and to give San Francisco
an honest and efficient administration.-
Wilson had the misfortune to have his name asso
ciated with a tariff bill which brought distress upon
the industries of his country, but in other respects he
was one of the statesmen of whom the nation has a
right to be proud. Certainly all true Americans, no
matter how stanch protectionists they may be, will
share Tom Reed's appreciation of the manliness of
Wilson's character. The republic needs in public life
men of that kind â men who can and do stand firm
when public feeling goes wrong. It would be better
if we had more men in all stations of life who agree
with Mr. Reed and act upon the principle that "doing
your duty and facing the consequences is success it
self." " . .. Â¦
In the phrase 'about public feeling gone wrong Mr.
Reed had doubtless in mind the revolt of the great
masses of the Democratic party from the principles
in which Mr. Wilson believed. The wild craze for
free silver and for what is generally known as Bryan
ism left Mr. Wilson without a party. He had the
courage to face the consequences, and his public life
was closed. There was; however, no failure in that
ending of his- career. The Democratic party is to
day abandoning "Bryan" as it once, abandoned Clever
land, and the course of the wiser leader is vindicated.
with clouds before the truth is ripened into fruitage.
He is happier who is wrong when.others are'wrorig;
but no Darwinian 'survival of the fittest, to survive'
will ever convince the manly man that there is not
something higher than happiness. Doing your duty,
and facing the consequences, is success itself."

The Board of Education made a dismal
attempt yesterday to prove that the at
tendance in some of the public schools is
not â¢ greater than it should be. Director
Denman read an elaborate statement,
based on principals' reports, in which it
was intended to show that the classifica
tion is less than provided for in the rule
governing it, but the very figures demon
strate that thirty classes have more than
fifty-five pupils enrolled, whereas the rule
provides for fifty-five only. Denman had
no. sooner read the statement than Sol
Schein of 631A Ivy avenue asked leave to
address the board. Schein stated that his
son had been refused admittance to the
Moulder and John Swett schools, on ac
count of . crowded classes, and- he was
comforted by the information that there
might be room in the Harrison School. '.
The statement' read by Denman shows
that In sixty-two schools, there being fif
teen yet to hear from, there is a total en
rollment of 31,073 pupils. The number of
classes is 670, making anaverage of forty
six pupils to a class. Twenty-eight classes
have under thirty pupils each, ninety
three classes under forty-one and 310
classes under fifty-one pupils, while thirty
classes have more than fifty-five pupils
enrolled. - , Â¦ . â¢
The statement shows that the Columbia
School has an average of fifty pupils to
each class, Cleveland 53, Dudley Stone 53,
Emerson 51. Franklin 52, Fremont 50,
Hearst 50, Humboldt 50, Jean Parker 54,
Jefferson 51, Joho Swett 53, Lafayette 50,
Longfellow 52, Lincoln 52, "Marshall 51,
Whittier 52, Adams 48, Agassiz 49. Cooper
49, Crocker 50, Denman 48, Golden Gate 49
and Horace Mann 49.
The figures hardly represent the actual
conditions, as many classes run consid
erably over! fifty-five, f and other classes
with a lower enrollment in the same
school would naturally bring the average
down to a much lower figure. For-exam
ple, the report of the principal of the
Sherman School shows an average of fifty
pupils. Three classes, however, have 55,
57 and 57 pupils, respectively, two have 54
each and four have 41, 43, 45 and 47 pupils
each. '
The board adopted a resolution estab
lishing a class for deaf mutes in. the de
partment provided that twelve pupils pre
sent themselves for admission. As this as
surance has already been .given by
parents the class will be a certainty after

Attorney Short tried to make the wit
ness state that if the cost of hauling
twenty-six oil cars from Bakersfleld to
Oakland was $206 and the freight on the
same was $1633, there must be a profit to
the carrier of $732. The witness, however,
explained that he was only "doing arith
metic" for Short, and would not admit
the accuracy of Snort's hypothetical ques
tions. The investigation will be resumed
this morning at 10 o'clock.
"The rate now charged for hauling a
ton of oil a mile," said the witness, "pro
duces a revenue of 8 mills only. The rate
charged for carrying oil from Bakersfleld
to Oakland does not allow of a profit of
more than a half-mill per ton a mile, if
the interest on the funded debt is elim
inated from the expenses."
The witness compared the freight
charges from Bakersfleld to Oakland and
the switching charges at Bakersfield to
those paid in Oregon l;y a lumber com-,
pany he was interested in, and declared
the Valley rates were absolutely fair to
the producer.
General Manager Kruttschnitt was re
called by Attorney Herrln and gave the
data as to the cost of hauling an oil car
on the round trip from Bakersfleld to
Oakland. The cost was stated to be 9 1-10
mills per mile. This cost was based on
the general average of hauling freight on
the entire system and the various charges
made by different departments and ac
counts. Eliminating "interest on funded
debt," the cost per mile was reduced to
7 6-10 mills.
G. X. Wend'.ing, late general manager
of the Producers' Oil Storage Association,
was the next witness for the railroad. The
witness told how his association sought
to combine the entire oil interests in order
to maintain rates. The Standard Oil Com
pany had, however, upset all calculations
and the association failed in its project.
Oil had been offered to consumers in this
city at 70 cents a barrel. This was done
in order to bring into the .field certain
producers who. held back. The witness
thought the pres*ent freight charges were
fair. The producers simply decided on
what price they wanted for their oil and
added that price to the rate of freight. A
reduction of the rate would not benefit
the producer.
A. J. Treadwell, a mining engineer and
oil expert for the Soufiern Pacific road,
told of his experience in the oil fields^ He
was positive that the j charge of 42 cents
per barrel for oil carried from Bakersfield
to this city was reasonable. The witness
stated that a reduction in the freight
would not benefit the producer or the con
sumer, as existing contracts. provided for
increase or decrease in freight â¢ charges.
The witness also thought the switching
charges of the railroad in the oil fields
were perfectly fair. A charge of 4 cents
a barrel is now made, while teamsters
formerly exacted 20 cents.
Captain Payson testified that â¢ in his
opinion the cost of equipping the cheap
est mile of the San Joaquin Valley road
was $12,000. This was due to the cheapness
of rails and material, which have since
the building of the road increased consid
erably.
The gist of Kruttschnitt's testimony
was that no railroad in the country could
figure on what it cost to haul freight over
a certain section of its property, but that
the cost must be computed on the aver
age of expense of the entire system. He
claimed that $2 31 a mile was the average
cost of moving freight trains.
To listen to Kruttschnitt's detail as to
how much it cost the road to haul a ton
of freight for a mile and just how many
"mills", of the amount must be charged
to "betterments," "maintenance of ways,"
"equipment," "operating expenses" >and
"legal services" reminded those present
of the days when the late Collis P. Hunt
ington appeared before the Railroad Com
missioners in the grain rate case.
The hearing of the oil rate case was re
sumed yesterday morning by the Railroad
Commissioners, and at the morning and
afternoon sessions elaborate data was
presented by General Manager Krutt
schnitt of the Southern Pacific. Railroad
to show that the rate charged for carry
ing oil between Bakersfield and Oakland
was not excessive, as alleged, but was in
fact very reasonable.
The five Chinese, including the under
taker, were arrested and placed on the
detinue book and the body was sent to
the Morgue. Detective Ed Gibson was
detailed on the case yesterday and he
was inclined to the belief that Chin Hong
committed suicide, but decided to detain
all the Chinese until after the inquest.
Chin Hong did not belong to any tong
and intended returning to Sacramento
next Saturday.
Yeong Jung, the proprietor, told the de
tectives that Chin Hong had come from
Sacramento and had been working for
him about two months. He went out
Tuesday night and returned about 1
o'clock yesterday' morning. Chin Hong
was left in the store while Yeong Jung
went into a room in the rear. He heard
a shot, and on entering the store found
Chin Hong dead. He sent for two of
Chin Hong's cousins and a Chinese un
dertaker was called in, but the under
taker said it would be better to notify the
police. , They were all. In the store when
the detectives came. In.
Shortly before 3 o'clock Special Officer
George Downey notified Detectives Dinan
and Crockett that there was trouble in
the store. The detectives went there and
discovered the dead body of Chin Hong
lying in a corner on the floor. Four other
Chinese were in the store at the time.
While the detectives were questioning the
men Leong Li came in with a Colt's re
volver in his hand, a piece of paper wrap
ped around it. One chamber was.emptyi
He explained that he was a cousin of the
dead man and had gone out with the re
volver to find an interpreter, so that he
could notify the police of the fact that
Chin Hong had committed suicide.
Chin Hongr, a Chinese employed in the
liquor/store of Yeong Jung at 1027 Dupont
street, was found dead in his employer's
store at an early hour yesterday morning,
with a bullet in his abdomen. Whether'
he died by his own hand or was mur
dered the police are as yet unable to say,
but circumstances so far as developed
point to suicide.
H. M. Snyder, timekeeper for Wass, pro
duced the- time book, which showed that
730 hours had been worked on the Senator
and 1747 hours on the City of Peking. The
bills paid by the Government for the work
called only for 710 hours and 1701 hours
respectively, leaving a difference unpaid
to Mr. Wass* credit of sixty-six hours.
Commissioner Heacock remarked that if
the prosecution could prove that Air.
Wass collected from the Government for
the work done on Captain Barneson's
house he would hold Mr. Wass to answer.
Captain J. H. Matthews, Government
Superintendent of Repairs in the trans
port service, was called by the prosecu
tion and vindicated the defendant. He
testified that in o-ses where bids were not
advertised for the contractor was obliged
to furnish the Government with the ma
terial at the lowest price quoted in the
open market. This Mr. Wass had done.
It was the custom for the contractor to
give a rough estimate as to the cost of
the work and to send in his bill when the
job was completed. At the time mentioned
in the -complaint the Government was In
a great hurry to get the transports ready
for sea and- was willing to allow * con
tractors to make 100 per cent profit on the
work of tluÂ«5r men. He regarded Mr.
Was3' bill correct as to the number of
hours, the witness having allowed him on
the contract twelve hours per day for
nine hours' work.
The examination will be resumed at 10
o'clock this morning.
Edward Smith testified that he worked
two days at Captain Barneson's house
with J. B. Neville and that Neville in
structed him to charge the time to the
transports.
Neville was called as a witness and
swore that Wass had directed him to
charge one day's time to the City of Pe
king and the other day's time to the Sen
ator of the work done on Barneson's
house. . .
The complaint charges VÂ» ass with hav
ing violated Section 543 of the Revised
Statutes of the United States, in that he
presented to Oscar F. Long, major and
quartermaster of United States volun
teers, a bill of $S50 50 for 1701 hours of
labor at 50 cents per hour for work done
on- the City of Peking froin^October 19 to
October 28, 1SS8, and that on October 28
he presented to John Barneson, marine
superintendent of the United States army
transport service at San' Francisco, a bill
for $353 for 710 hours' work upon the
transport Senator from October 2-i to No
vember 20.
First Assistant United States Attorney
Banning represented the Government. T.
C. Van Ness appeared for the defendant.
The chief point in the case was whether
the defendant charged as work done on
the transports work done at the house of
Captain John Barneson. On this point 11.
E. Helm, foreman for Mr. Wass, testilied
that he sent J. B. Neville and Edward
Smith to Captain Barneson's house to put
in two switcnes and that he had the work
charged to "Captain Barneson's -house."
The witness had charge of the men
working on the transport Flintshire and
he ordered them to enter twelve hours on
their time when they worked nine hours
per day. That order was given by direc
tion of Mr. Wass. The men demanded an
eight-hour day with ten hours' pay. One
hour extra that they worked in the morn
ing was counted as two hoursâ double
rates being allowed for overtime.

DANDRUFF WON'T WASH OTJT
The G-errn That Causes It Has to Be
Destroyed to Cure Dandruff.
Many a woman spends an hour twice a
week scouring her scalp, thinking scrub-
bing- off the scurf will cure the dandruff.
Two hours a week, at the age of 40 years,
she has spent 260 days of twelve hours
each, or two-thirds of a year of her life,
In that vain hope â vain, because you can't
cure dandruff without killing the dandruff
germ, and the only hair preparation on
earth that will do that Is Newbro's
"Herpicide"â also a delightful hair dress-
ing and thoroughly antiseptic against all
contagion from use of other's hair
brushes. i Â«

The stock market to-day was utterly stagnant,
although Investment shares were firm on the
general belief that the termination of the Boer
war Is close at hand. Other stocks than strict
ly Investment ones were inclined to sag and
American Issues oscillated fractionally. There
was' a: complete: lack of interest in that depart
ment, pending' the settlement of the steel
strike ana the receipt of the Government crop
report. New York sent hardly any prices.
Money rates are unchanged.

NEW YORK, Aug. 7.â Business to-day was
on a reduced scale and there was a more gen
eral disposition to curtail operations pending j
the settlement of tho steel strike. The an-
QOUneetnent over night of a general extension
of tho strike order caused some hesitancy at
the outfit In the general market, but aside
from a sharp dip at the end of the first hour
and again toward the close the tendency was
distinctly upward throughout. The final prices
were about the best for Atchison, St. Paul,
Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, which were
accounted the most active declines In the rail
road division. Reports have been current for
several days past of a fixed price at which
the United States Steel stocks would not be
allowed to break by the alleged pool behind,
the stock. This level was exceeded earlier In
the week and speculators were interested
in watching the opening In the stocks this
morning when 6W)0 shares of the common stock
came out on a scale down to 39% and a figure
was made of S9 for the preferred, representing
losses of % each. Support was immediately
forthcoming and a rumor gained currency that
the level for to-day was fixed at 33% and &3
respectively. Proiessional operators made but
feeble efforts to depress the stocks in the sub
frequent dealings and were more inclined to
bid up the general list on the theory that. the
backing to the steel issues would have a sus
taining effect on all ether properties. Whether'
this supposition was correct or not or because
the short interest had been unduly extended
in the railroad list the tact remains that all
of the grain-carrying roads shewed conspicuous
strength at various times. * No doubt the
grangers ware helped by the )rise of about a
cent in wheat, but Atchison's improvement
could not be directly traced consistently to
the fluctuations in corn, which was higher.
Business in the United States Steel stocks was
on c-ven a smaller srale than yesterday, but
they moved pretty steadily upward touching
4<>9Â» and SO respectively and ended at the high
est of the day. A number of minor railroads
made somewhat sensational advances,, the ex
treme rise in Lake Erie and Western common
and preferred 8 and 10, Iowa Central common
and preferred 3'Â£ and 5^i, St. Lawrence and
Adirondack 6%. No news attended the upward
movement in these stocks aside Irom the plac
ing of the latter on a 5 per cent dividend
basis. Industrial stocks, aside from Sugar,
were without any special change and the fluc
tuations in that stock were within compara
tively moderate limits. Some weakness de
veloped early in the coalers on talk of re
r.twed dissatisfaction among mine workers, but
their losses were canceled later on. except for
Lackawanna, which ended 7 points off. Mon
etary conditions were unchanged, but sterling
exchange was stronger. There are no pros
pects cf gold shipments this week to Germany.
In the closing dealings prices were on the up
turn again and the ending was very firm.
Railroad bonds were quiet and somewhat Ir
regular. Total sales, par value, $1,140,000. .
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

But within the past few years a new in
terest has been taken In that section of
Ponoma County near the Russian River.
Over 2<v) families have built inexpensive
summer homes there and the number la
constantly increasing. The future pros
pects for the road on that account war
rant the improvements for which prepara
tions are now under way. With the open
ing of next season the public may look
for improved service to Cazadero and all
way stations. The policy of the road is
tojnerease the facilities just as fast as
the public flfmand â¢warrants.
This section of country â¢when the road
was first built was a great freight pro
ducer, shipping large quantities of grain,
potatoes and other agricultural products
to the metropolis. But changes in crops
to dairying and the working out of the
great timber tracts deprived the road of
Its freight traffic, and. while in former
years it was customary to see loaded
freight trains moving Bouth and empty
cars northward every day in the week.
now the freight business has fallen off to
one freight train that goes up the road
one day and comes back the next.
For the past year the North Pacific
Coast Railroad nas been Improving its
roadbed between Sausalito and San Ra
fael and double-tracking the road between
Corte Madera and San Anselmo. On the
main line between San Anselmo and Caz
edero bridge builders have been employed
on all the high trestles and smaller
bridges. All old timbers have been re
moved and new ones substituted, so that
all crossings are now in first-class shape.
Only & few years ago the old rails, which
were of light weight, were taken up be

There is very strong feeling against the

will cause its repeal If they have to take
it to the Supreme Court. According to its
provisions everything is closed except liv

drugstores for the sale of drugs-only. No
milk, ice or bakery wagons are allowed

Tuttle is th? proprietor of the largest
drugstore in town, and was arrested to
day on a charge of selling other things
besides drugs on Sunday. He pleaded
guilty and paid his line â¢without demur.
According to Ms own statement a man
came into his store Sunday morning to
buy a hairbrush, saying that he and his

found they had forgotten a brush. Tut

the brush.
PACIFIC GROVE. Aug. 7.â There is
much excitement here over the breaking
of the recently enacted absolute Sunday

K. Tuttle. The fact that he was the
prime mover in the passage of the meas

more interest to the case.

First the captain tried to beach the ves
sel with assistance from shore, but the
wln.l drove the burnirg craft off shore.
Fmoke and flames were mounting high in
the rigging and soon the flames spread
below and the heat was so intense that
it was impossible to even stand on deck.
Finally the captain decided that the battle
was useless and the vessel was deserted,
all the crew rowing ashore.
The burning vessel with its furnace of
flame was a grand spectacle from shore
ar.d was seen Ly many people. The Em
pire was owned by J. J. Moore of San
Francisco.
Two days later It was discovered that
her cargo was on fire, and despite all ef
fors made lo que'.l it the bark
nurned to the water's edge a short dis
tance from shore and everything was
lost. The fire was first noticed in the
efterpart of the vessel, but burned so fast
that the captain and crew could not go
below to investigate. Captain Knack at
once sent his wife to another vessel at
anchor, and all hands began to fight to
put out the fire.

MARTINEZ, Aug. 7.â An Italian fisher
man whose name and whereabouts are
unknown shot and nearly killed Captain,
Olsen, the skipper of the schooner Nettie.
In Suisun Bay this afternoon. Although
the mariner will recover from the num
erous wounds he received, the sight oC
his left eye is endangered and one of his
arms is so riddled, with buckshot that ho
may not be able to use it again.
The shooting was the result of Olsen*3
unintentional interference with the Ital
ian's fishing net. The schooner became
entangled in it and the Italian rebuked
the skipper. For a few minutes there
were warm Â¦words between the men. Th.eÂ»
verbal controversy culminated when tho
Italian raised a shotgun and opened firÂ©
on the captain of the schooner. The first
charge of shot struck Olsen in the face.
A second charge of shot caught him in
the arm and disabled that member.
Satisfied that he had wrought sufficient
damage or possibly fearful that Olsen's
friends would retaliate with weapons, the>
Italian made off in his boat and has not
been eeen. since. Olsen was sent to San
Francisco to have hla wounds dressed.

its object the world's supply of windefw
glass by one corporation.
. The proposed combination Is to take in
all of the window glass manufactories of
the world, and if effected* the business
will be conducted from Pittsburg. as the
nucleus of the organization Is the Ameri

This company practically controls the
window glass business of the United

Belgium. f Â¦ .

There is another side to this reduction.
It is ths question of revenue. .
The city of Oakland Is always "hard
up " Holes begin to make their appear
ance in the financial garments of the city
about three or four months before the end
of each fiscal year. Then a great "to do"
is made about a deficit. and all salaries
are carried over Into the next year and
no deficit occurs. But under this system
Oakland always starts â¢ each fiscal year
with a deficit in the shape of three
months' salaries that have been carried
over.
Oakland started this year just as it al
ways does, with three months' salaries
to the bad. The City Council knows this.
It also knows that the annual revenue
of the city of Oakland is scarcely more
than eufflcient to maintain the city with
out an inheritance of debt from the year
Then Ihe specter of the high water
rates loomed up before them, for the
water bills of the city for municipal pur
poses will be nearly double those of last
year. The hydrant bills, which form the
A Question of Revenue.
Then the frost became evident, for with
five votes to reduce Councilman Wixson
declined to vote with his colleagues, ask
ing for more time to consider. But as he
would not vote for the resolution, he
would not vote against it. and so the res
olution failed for want of votes enough.
There "were 'mt three votes against it,
those of Dornin, Wallace and Fitzgerald,
and two were absent, Cuvellier and Ruch.
Cuvellier is sick and would have voted
with the minority. Ruch has been voting
with the majority of late when it is neces-
Bary and the course of his vote in this
matter is being watched with interest.
But tho possibilities of this reduction
are not dead yet. The reduction was once
refused by the Supervisors, but enough
votes \ftere afterward secured to cause a
reconsideration and the cut was made, so
that hope has not been abandoned as to
the Council. The matter will come up
again to-morrow night and it is confident
ly asserted that either Wixeon or Ruch
will vote with Bishop. Boyer, Bon. Court
ney and Schaffer to make the reduction.
Wixson Wanted Time.
President Louis Schaffer. who is wise
In his day and generation, saw that some
thing had gone wrong, and when Council
man Bon and Councilman Courtney want
ed to make motions to reduce the assess
ment he ruled them out of order. They
did not take the hint, and Councilman
Courtney rushed to the front with a reso
lution to reduce the assessment as had
been done by the County Supervisors.
This caused embarrassment in the Coun
cil, for City Attorney Johnson is the legal
adviser of that body. It is true that Emil
Nusbaumer, attorney for the Contra Cos
ta Water Company, did not agree with
Mr. Johnson, and said so in extenso, but
that did not help matters very much, for
Mr. Nusbaumer represented "the corpora
tion and Mr. Johnson represented the city,
and that is what is reputed to have
chilled Councilman Wlxson's feet.
talked right out in meeting and said that
the franchise of the Centra Costa Water
Company was a thing of value and that it
was assessabl3, and that it should be as
sessed in Oakland and not in San Fran
cisco. The City Attorney supported his
statements with a lot of law that was
very dry and which few understood, but
when It came to his final resume of "the
situation he said positively that his con
clusions were that the franchise of the
Contra Costa Water Company should be
assessed, and should be assessed right in
Oakland.

This list is composed of the following

Property-Owners Who Are Cited.
The first district comprises the property
owners on each ride of Washington street
from Seventh to Fourteenth street. The
property owners who are affected in this
district must appear to-morrow night be
fore the Council sitting as a Board of
Equalization.
The Council, for the purpose of this in
crease in the assessment roll, created
three districts in which it is proposed to
raise the value of the real estate, and one
district in which it is proposed to raise
the assessments upon mortgages to the
faces of the mortgages.
iUp to the present time it has been a
question that affected the people at large
and the people at large seldom protest,
for what is everybody's business is no
body's business. But when it becomes a
question that- involves individuals there
â¢will be a great, big, generous, whole
souled objection, and that objection will
be registered to-morrow night when the
property owners along Washington street
will have to come forward and show
cause why their assessments should not
be raised so that revenue sufficient to
supply the deficiency made by the pro
posed Contra Costa reduction can be met.
Water Company fixes water rates or the
City Council fixes revenue, or both. It
only becomes a question of how much
they have to pay the piper.
Judge Hart pave the water rates a. lift
on one side by his decision, and now- the
City Council is going to give the other
side a lift and give the taxes a boost.
These little matters of revenue and
rates all get right back to | the people,
who have to pay the piper no matter
whether it is because the Contra Costa
People Must Pay Piper.
Now it is "up to" the Council to do like
wise, and great surprise has been ex
pressed in many- quarters over the fact
that there should have been any hitch
last night. That hitch was due entirely
to the decided stand that City Attorney
James A. Johnson took, which rather
staggered the Council.
But between July 19 and July 23 Super
visors Horner and Rowe discovered that
it would be better to reduce^the assess
ment upon the franchise than to reduce
it upon the real property and took the
ground that the company would fight the
assessment and stood a better chance of
knocking out the assessment upon the
franchise than that* upon the- real prop
erty. So on July 23 things were, restored
to the harmony of their successful - way
and Supervisors Horner and Rowe voted
with Church and reduced the franchise
.valuations from $1,450,000 to $9000. .
It is true that there was threatened a
slight hitch before the Board of Supervi
sors. When it came to a vote upon tho
reduction of the assessment upon the
Contra Costa "Water Company's franchise
before that body on July 19. Supervisors
Horner, Rowe, Talcott and Mitchell voted
against reduction, while Supervisor
Church stood alone for cutting the valua
tion. -.-â¢-..
Supervisors Changed Minds.
The City Council has fixed water rates
based upon this decision of the Sacramen
to jurist.
Judge Hart fixed the valuation of the
Contra Costa Water Company at a most
satisfactory figure, and the burned books
could not be brought into court to show
what the plant 'cost. . :
Up to the present time it has been very
plain sailing for the City Council and the
Contra Costa Water Company.
Nothing remains of the burned books
but the smoke.
So it has been decided that the property
assessments in the center'of Oakland will
be increased about a million, and the
Council, sitting in its capacity as a Board
of Eawalization. has issued a series of
citations to property owners to come be
fore them and show why their assess
ments should not be raised. The first of
these citations are returnable to-morrow
evening, and then the troubles of the City
Equalizers â¢will begin.
It is argued, and this argument was ad
vanced last night by Councilman Boyer
at the meeting of the Council, sitting as a.
Board of Equalization, that the people
would have to pay the taxes of the Con
tra Costa Water Company anyway, under
Judge Hart's decision. While this is true
it becomes a question of revenue for the
city. It is money that is needed no mat
ter from what sources the money comes,
whether the people pay it through the
Contra Costa Water Company or whether
the property valuations are increased and
thev, are made to pay it in that way. So
if the Contra Costa Water Company's as
sessment is reduced a million of dollars
somewhere about the city that million will
have to be made up or Oakland will never
b*Â» ab1Â» to make both ends meet this year.
Must Make Up Deficit.
largest Item of municipal water expendi
ture, will be double those of last Â¦'â¢ear.
In the face of this the City Council Is
pledged to municipal improvements.
It Â¦was a gloomy outlook for the munic
ipal Improvements and those Jn the Coun
cil who could see into the future saw only
a struggle for revenue with which to keep
the city going and put on a few patches
where it was breaking: out at the elbows
and running down at the heel.
Then came the proposition to reduce the
assessment of the Contra Costa Water
Company. The financiers of the Council
s=aw that to do that would mean a decided
reduction in the revenues of the city that
were already too small. Something had
to be done to fill the vacancy that was to
be caused, and so the scheme of increas
ing the values of the property of the city
was advanced.

Andrew Ruch had been present, or if City
Attorney Johnson had not been so posi

of the Contra Costa Water Company
would have been made, and nothing would
have remained to be done except raise the

lost by the reduction of the assessment

Both Grape-Nuts and Postum contain
certain elements that arÂ« of great value
In rebuilding the human body.
The above is from a Pullman Palace
Car man who starts out by saying that
"Grape-Nuts are fine with cream, but let
me tell you what to do when the old cow
goes dry." We would further suggest
that persons who have trouble in digest-
Ing coffee, use Postum Food Coffee for
the morning meal and try the Grape-
Nuts with It Instead of with ordinary
coffee.
"In the morning:, when you don't have
very much of an appetite. Just fill your
coffee cup about one-third full of Grape-
Nuts, then fill up with hot coffee, sweeten
to taste, stir well and let settle. Now try
your coffee. Why. man. it will make your
hair curl. After drinking your coffee, add
a little more*sugar and eat your Grape-
Nuts with a spoon, and my word for it
you â¢will feel like a fighting: cock untif
dinner time. If you never have, and want
something: good, try It once."

DENVER, Aug. 7.â International com
plications have arisen between the United
States and Italy on account of the de
cision of a court that a non-resident
alien is not entitled to sue for damages
in the courts of Colorado. Several months
ago Fenlce Ferraor. an Italian woman
living in Italy, brought suit for $5000 dam
ages against the Auric Mining Company
in the courts of Hlnsdale County for the
violent death of her husband, Peter, in
the Ute and Ulay mine near Lake
City. ; The suit was transferred' to the
court of Pueblo County and there the" de
cision was rendered that a non-resident
alien had no right to sue for damages.
Mrs. Ferraor to-day took up the mat
ter with the Italian Consul, Joseph
Cuneo. He will bring the case at once
before, the Federal government at Wash
ington. Mr. Cuneo claims the decision
rendered in this case is in direct viola
tion of the treaty of 1S71 between Italy
and the United States.
I Commander McCalla's expedition estab
lished headquarters at Panama. Here the
revolutionary leader Aizpura- was in full
control and was erecting barricades, ex
pecting a battle with the Colombian army.
Commander McCalla acted energetically
and gathering his full ferret occupied Pan
ama on April 24. arrested Aizpura and
the other leaders and held them prisoners
until an agreement was signed that fight
ing should not take place within the city.
Three days later the Colombian army ar
rived, and at a conference between ~tbÂ«
Government, General Aizpura and Admir
al Jouett the insurgents capitulated. AM
of the United States forces were then
'withdrawn and were back in New York.
May 16. The Secretary of the Navy in
reporting the Incident pointed out that
the action of the navy was carefully con
fined to enforcing treaty stipulations for
free transit across the isthmus and that
our interference ceased the moment th ! n
object had been accomplished. President
Cleveland's message to Congress and the
correspondence of Secretary Bayard also
made clear that the sole purpose of the
United States in employing force was to
fulfill its guaranty under the treaty cf
184G to keep the transit open aeross tho
isthmus. The present trouble on the Isth
mus is far less . formidable than that of
1S85. but the procedure is made clear in
case the insurgents obstruct traffic. Ther*
is no present purpose of sending a ship
down from the Pacific side.
Free Transit Aross Isthmus.
The .position of the United States as to
maintaining free traffic across the Isth
mus of Panama was fully denned in 1SS5.
when extensive naval operations we'e
carried on there. An outbreak similar to
the present one occurred early in the year
and the Insurgents captured Panama airi
burned Aspinwall. When traffic became
effectually blocked the United States de
termined to act and the North Atlantic
squadron, under Rear Admiral Jouett,
was sent to the isthmus. At the same
time the Navy Department sent an expe
ditionary force from New York, consist
ing of 750 seamen and marines, command
ed by Commander McCalla. and including
three Gatling guns and three 3-inch rifles.
Admiral Jonett arrived at the isthmus
April 10. and at once landed the marines
and issued orders to open transit acroa*
the isthmus. Two armored cars fitted
with Howitzers, Gatling and Hotchkiss
guns were sent over the line, clearing the
way and making the entire transit. Gar
risons of marines were placed at Aspin
wall and Matachin. the latter place being
Â¦where the revolutionists have now held
up a train, according to Consul Gudger's
dispatch yesterday, :..â¢
The Machias is a gunboat of 1177 ton3
displacement, with twin screw3 and erood
steam capacity. She has eight four-inch
guns in her main battery, six rapid-nro
and one automatic gun. Her run to the
isthmus depends somewhat on the length
of her stay at Hampton Roads, but it is
believed she will be ready to proceed w'.th
little or no delay, in which case the trip
will take about ten davs or two weeks.
The order to the Machias followed a
conference held at the Navy Department
between- .acting secretary of State Adee
and acting Secretary of the Navy HaeK
ett. Adee had the dispatch received trum
Consul General GudgeV last night stating
that the revolutionists had held up a
train for an hour at Marachin, on the line
of the- railroad across the isthmus and
only about fifteen miles from Panama,
City. While this â¢was not regarded as
threatening an interruption of traffic or
giving any ground for intervention by the
United- States, yet it was deemed advis
able by the officials that one of our ships
should be there in order that suitable ob
servations could be made and steps taken
to meet any serious emergency that mtgnt
arise. For the â¢ present officials do not
believe there will be any need of landinÂ§
marines. The commander of the Machlaa.
Lieutenant Commander Mason Sergeant;
,is regarded as. an officer of tact and abil
ity and besides this he has had recent ex
perience in Wes.t Indian waters, having
been in command of the Scorpion when
she made her- recent trip to La Guayara
to keep watch on American interests in
Venezuela.
Machias Will Proceed Without Delay.
At the Navy Department It 13 explained
that this movement has been ordered with
a view of having the Machias take ob
servations In the vicinity of the Isthmuj.

ment it was officially stated that "it Is
deemed needful that a tfnlted States war
ship be in that vicinity at this time."

was sent from Truckee to repair the break
in the roadway.

pronounced out of danger.
The accident -was caused by a broken
wheel on a flat car loaded with rock from
Santee Quarries. The train, which was
due here at a little befcre 4 o'clock, con
sisted of three cars of rock, one freight
car and a passenger coach with about
twelve passengers. When the wheel broke
the train was coming up the Schulenberg

topoling into the ditch. The boxcar on
which Conductor Butler and the brake
man were riding, followed, but the men
landed on their feet without injury.
