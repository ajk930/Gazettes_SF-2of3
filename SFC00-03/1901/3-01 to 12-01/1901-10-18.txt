BISHOP DUDLEY OF KENTUCKY DELIVERING THE PASTORAL LETTER.
The pastoral letter follows:
In compliance with your request, dear
brethren of the clergy and of the laity,
end la accordance with our time-honored
custom,, your Bishops are come to speak
parting words . of exhortation and of
blessing. The session of the great synod
is ended. "We have taken counsel to
jrether cf the things concerning the king
dom of God; ire have made more nearly
perfect, es we trust, the organization for
the accoapllabjnent of Its work; we
have chosen new leaders of the militant
bost; ">e have devised, as we believe,
larger enterprise of future advance.
Surely we have gained new courage by
clasping the hands ' of brothers beloved,
and we go forth boldly Into the nijfht.
the night of trial and of battle, looking
for and waiting for the dawn of victory
and peace. But ere we part and set
forth, each to his appointed place in. the
great field of battle, we hear your voice
calling to us whom the king has eet as
watchmen upon his city's towers,
"Watchman, tell us of the night." And
the answer is returned now as in the old
time, "The morning: cometh and also the
night."
\u25a0We bid you first of all rejoice because
surely the morning beginneth to dawn.
tVe cry aloud. "Let no man's heart fail
him for fear," because eurely the signs of
the triumph are plain and unmistakable,
though the battle must still be long and
weary. Behold, our triennial assembly has
been Gathered In this queen city of our
furthest West, and thither the, tribes have
corae up, the organized tribes of our Is
rael, from every State and Territory of
our continental Inheritance. Think to-day
cf the meeting of that IHtle handful of
dispirited churchmen on that other Â«ea

one hundred years ago. They puzzled sore
how to keep alive the old church in the

gH ness of the session the House of
HH Deputies went to work yesterday
11 H ; morning with a rush. Long
\u25a0â¢ speeches were looked upon with
" disfavor, and motions abd reso
lutions were acted upon with a quickness
that- was surprising. An attempt was
made; to have the reading of the minutes
dispensed" with,' but as this was impossi

time had to be taken to tell of the doings

\u25a0 /Pwo'messages ( i were read from the
House of Bishops notifying! of Its concur

entered as candidates for that order, and
of its concurrence in amending title 1,

â¢Upon motion of Mr. Saunders resolution
on number 20 from the calendar, relative

to .the proviso to article 10 of the constl

shall be construed as restricting the au
thority of "the ' Bishops " of the church to
'take -such 'order' as may" be permitted by
the rubric of the Book of Common
Prayer, or by the canons of the General
Convention for the use of special forms
of worship. The committee reported that
the privilege already existed and no ac
tion was necessary, for which reason they
asked to. be discharged. r The matter was
placed on the calendar.
Rev. Dr. Duncan of Louisiana, chairman
of the committee on the state of the
church, reported that no further action
could be taken on the memorial from the
diocese of Indiana relative to certain

ordered^ ,
Rov. Dr. Mooie, chairman of the joint
committee on conference relative to se
cresy in the nomination of missionary
Bishcps, stated that there was a rule in
the House of Bishops which would make
such a course impossible. He therefore
asked for the di.-charge of the committee.
Thii y,a= so ordered.
QUrSTiCN O CHANGS
\u25a0 OF "NAM I OF CHURCH
' Mr. Lewis offered a resolution, asking 1
.that I the joint committee on proposed
change of name of the church publish
their report six' months before the session
of the next triennial convention and that
the. chairman of both houses be empow
ered to fill vacancies on the committee.
g Rev. Dr. Egar of Albany, from the com
mittee on conference in regard to the
.amendment of section 3, article I, of the
constitution, relative to the presldlns
curing from the mother In bonds to the
state the transmission of apostolic au
thcrity and ordinances, to the successful
rebels against that stated authority, and
the proposition was heard, to resort to the
use cf self-appointed ministry as justified
by providential necessity. But faithful
persistency did at last prevail and the
coveted rift was at last bestowed, and to
day every acre of our continent of free
dom Is under the supervision of apostollo
bishop and pastor. Grant, as must In
honesty bs granted, that in many vast re
gions the organization la but a skeleton;
grant that there are but few sheep tn.many""
a wide wilderness for the pastor's care;
grant, too, that the chief pastors look ana
look in vain for men. consecrated men, to
seek these widely separated wanderers,
and. worse still, that finding them, they
dare not In their penury bid the volunteers
to come, yet still may we rejoice and be
â¢ strong in the recognition that the flag has
been planted in every provincial division
of the great republic, and that in almost
every one of the ancient church Is stronger
to-day, stronger in all that makes for the
accomplishment of its purpose than was
the church in the whole country In tho
day when the Independent nation was
newborn into the world.
ENCOURAGEMENT IN
FIGURES OF CENSUS
The census taker may give but doubtful
testimony ae to the progress 'of the church, .
and now, as In the ancient days, it may be
foolishness unto.the.Lord. to_.be, numbering ...
his people lest our confidence shall be In
our multitude rather than in his spirit, yet -
may we be strengthened by the witness of '
the .Government of our . country.. that, the .-
proportionate gain of the ancient church of
our race has In the past decade been greater '<.
than that of any other organization for the
teaching of Christ's religion. And although %'
as already Intimated the company of ' the 'â¢
preacher* is not yet great, although the
young manhood of the church "in most of
our dioceses has apparently but little en
thusiasm for the work of its ministry; al- -
though this Is an alarming elgn of our '
time, an evil whose explanation we may
seek In our further consideration, yet we â¢
may and must thank God that a number
every year do offer themselves for tho self
denying service. And lastly, despite the
lugubrious recounts! of our parsimony
which one may hear on every hand, fie
splto the deficit in the receipts of our mis
sionary treasurer which has made us
afraid, despite the Tact that beyond all con
troversy our gifts to missions are as noth
ing whea reckoned by the rule of Christian
celf-surrender. by the proportion of the
wealth of churchmen, and by comparison
â¢with the magnificent donations of church
men to objects and Institutions not under
church control, yet even herein may we
not be made afraid, for without the shadow
of a doubt the progress in this particular,
the development of the recognition of this
Christian obligation, has been marvelous.
Go, read the records in the mission house.
You shall not be long employed in adding
the paltry columns which proclaim the
total of contributions to missions in these
years now long past. Until the day came
that the heroic utterance was made that
membership in the church is membership in
the missionary society, that- the necessary
obligation of every baptized disciple Is to
give to missions, till then the contributions
were, one may almost dare say, nothing.
But, since that day the progress has been
regular and marked; yes, we dare de
clare that enthusiasm for missions has
burned with an ever increasing flame. -
See the women of the church as organized
in the Women's Auxiliary to the Board of
Missions have this year laid upon the
altar of God the splendid united offering
of 1105,000 for the work of missions, while
but twelve years have passed since this
united offermg was first made, when J2000
was given. And remember that this is but
their way of celebrating our triennial fes-
tlval, and that vastly more than this j
amount, yes. ten times this amount. Is
given every year by our sisters in one way
and another to the work of missions, the
true work of missions, though not admin
istered by our board of managers. The
children of the church during the last
season of Lent gathered of their pennies an
â¢qual amount for this same cause. I And
Bishop of the church, presented a report
recommending that the house recede from
its proposed amendment and concur with
the Bishops. The report was adopted.
Rev. Dr. Bennett of Newark offered a
resolution, the House cf Bishops con
curring, that the joint commissions exist
ing at the close of the convention con
tinue until the next convention and the
chairman of the house be empowered to
fill all vacancies on such commissions.
It was adopted.
Rev. Dr. Alsop of Long Island offered
a resolution, which was adopted, author
izinz the committee on marginal readings
%o print as an appendix to the edition of
the Bible which they have been author
ized to print the readings marked *'C" in
their report.
Items on the calendar were next taken
up. Robert Treat Paine took the platform
to tell what the committee on new dio
ceses had done in relation to the memorial
of the diocese of Kansas, asking that a
certain portion of that State be set off as
a missionary district. He was opposed to
the resolution to make a permanent mis
sionary district out of that portion of
Kansas referred to In the majority report.
"If we make It a missionary district," he
said, 'It is so for years and years to come.
It Is taking off of the Eastern portion of
Kansas that responsibility that belongs
to the wealthier portion of a single com
monwealth."
In concluding hi3 speech Mr. Paine
moved to lay the entire matter on the ta
ble. His motion was overwhelmingly de
feated. '-S-'i
Deputy Talbot of West Missouri argued
for the adoption of the majority report,
intimating that the Bishop of Kansas
would soon work himself to death unless
relieved by the division of his territory.
Rev. Dr. Restarick of Los Angeles
spoke In favor of the majority report of
tke., committee. ; He. asked that , the casÂ«
be decided on its merits, no matter what
the House of Bishops did or did not do
in the matter. He said Kansas did not
want an archdeacon, as it already hai
an able one. What the State needed was
a missionary Bishop who would assist the
Bishop of the diocese in his work.
ST0TE OF KflNSfJS IS
ACCIDENTALLY DIVIDED
Upon motion of a clerical delegate a
map of the State under consideration wa3
presented to the convention 80 that tho
deputies could appreciate the extent r.f
its territory and the necessity of dividing
it into two sections. While the delegates
were putting up the big map it was acci
dentally torn in half and the convention
was convulsed with laughter. This wa3
aggravated by the chairman, who asked
that the next speaker should be allowed
to continue bis speech on the "division of
Kansas."
Deputy Lyman of Chicago spoke In fa
vor of the adoption of the majority re
port, which was favorable to the petition
for division. The fact that there were
but twenty-two churches in a. territory
which had 500,000 population showed the
necessity for some active work there.
Rev. Dr. Tayler of L.os Angeles said
that the arguments made in favor of the
minority report had convinced him of the
wisdom of adopting the majority report.
He believed that if the work of the church
was encouraged by the proposed division
the time would come when m Its growth
v.ould recuire four or five dioceses In
Kansas, instead of the two now asked for.
Lay Deputy Brown raised the point that
all the requirements of the constitution
had not been complied with. Deputy
Randall took the platform to show that
Mr. Brown was mistaken.
Lay Deputy Thomas "Withers followed
and told of the growth of the church.
He said It was a great country and the
Bishop of Eastern Kansas had more work
than he , could do. He therefore hoped
the convention would give that State an
other Bishop.
Charles Maxwell Clement of Pennsyl
vania, a majority member of the com
mittee, added something more In favor
of its report. At the conclusion of his
speech he asked that a vote be taken on
the subject in five minutes. This was
agreed upon.
Mr. Fairbanks followed and also spoke
In favor of the resolution. .
Robert Treat Paine, in support of the
minority rapport, argued that inasmuch as
all the railroads in Kansas ran east and
west the proposed division was on wrong
geographical lines. If the present propo
sit!on was defeated the next move, ha
thought, would be to get a more reason
able and practical division.
Rev. Dr. Short of Oregon answered tho
last speaker. He said the Bishop of Kan
sas had answered the question most sat
isfactorily to the majority of the commit
tee of wftich he had the honor of being a
member.' The Bishop of Kansas said he
would rather have nothing If the State
was to be divided east and west. There
were cries of '\u2666Why?' from the deputies.
Dr. Short said he considered the growth
of the State and the missionary work of
the church could be better carried on if
the division was made on north and west
lines.
There were further cries of "Why?"
and Archdeacon Watkins replied: ..

Ae a.t the opening eervice the church
\u25a0was Jar too small to accommodate thoee
\u25a0who desired to listen to the concluding

"was available to clear away the platform
that had been used in the proceedings of
the lower house* The desks were carried
away and chairs were arranged for the
Bishops who were to take part in the serv

The galleries of the church were crowd

dozens being accommodated with seats by
of the clerical and lay deputies*
A force of police was on hand to main
tain order outside the church and to
'watch over the safety of those gathered
in the building. ,

â¢a committee was appointed to notify the
House of Bishops that all was In readi

gation from Connecticut had voted to contrib
ute $3000. Several delegates objected that the

who had come prepared for It. The mover
disclaimed this. Baying that his resolution con

The vote disclosed a bare majority for the

or pledges toward making good'- the deficit of

Rev. Dr. Da.venport read a number of

Stevens, the Chamber of Commerce and
the rector, vestry .and congregation of St.
James Church, Fresno, for the kind Invi
tation extended to attend the consecration
of its church. â¢ While the -convention as a
body cannot attend, it is hoped â¢ that indi

were passed.
and for adoption to the General Convention at
its next triennial meeting In accordance with
Article II of the constitution,' and provided
further that nothing in this article shall be
construed as restricting the authority of- the
Bishops of this church to take such orders as
may be permitted by the canons of the Gen
eral Convention for the use of special forms of
worship.
"Resolved, the House of Deputies concurring.
That it is the sense of this convention that
a Bishop of this church has the right to take
under his spiritual oversight any congregation
of Christian people not In communion with
this church that may desire him bo to do.
and that it is the further sense of this con
vention that the use of the book of common
prayer is not obligatory under such circum
stances; provided no such congregation shall
be admitted into union with the diocesan con
vention until it has been organized as a parish
or congregation of this church in accordance
with all canonical requirements and until it
has been duly certified that the book of com
mon prayer is the use of such congregation."
Rev. Dr. Fulton took the platform and said:
"There are three points in the report of the
conference committee. In the first I fall to
find anything further than a stipulation that
nothing in Article X of the constitution de
prives the Bishops of certain rights.
; "After this proposed amendment we have a
resolution In two parts,' one of which is a
construction of the article. -Now the construc
tion of this article by this convention is not
worth the paper it is written on. It is a mere
expression of opinion.
"The third part of the report seems to me
to be most dangerous because It Is In effect
what every lawyer knows to be a dangerous
thingâ legislation by resolution. When legisla
tion Is carried it ought to be in the form of
a statute or in our own convention by canon."
Mr. Saunders, a member of the committee
on conference, followed and gave a clear out
line of the purport of the proposed amend
ments.
Rev. Dr. Hopkins of Chicago was the -next
speaker. In part he eald:
"I sincerely hope this convention will not
take action in this matter as it is not for
church unity. I hopo If will be defeated by
this house because it does not meet the in
tention of the Lambeth platform. I do not
think these two points have been brought out
In the discussion of this case as clearly as
they might be. I beg . to remind this house
that the Lambeth proposition was not ad
dressed to discontented individual congrega
tions. It was no . such approach to j sporadic
cases of dlsgruntlement. It v waa no such un
dignified premium upon the maintenance of- the
division of Christendom.". .
The vote was taken on the resolutions sep
arately by orders and dioceses. The- first pre
vailed by the following vote: :
Clericalâ Ayes, 80; noes, 19; divided, 5. \_

Rev. Dr. Davenoort proposed- a vote of
thanks to Major William B. Hooper, \u25a0 chairman
of the local committee, for his unwearied and
efficient labors for the comfort, convenience
and entertainment Of the members of the con
vention.- The motion was adopted with hearty
unanimity. Major Hooper made a feeling and
grateful speech of acknowledgment. He also
read the minutes of the first meeting of. a
Protestant Episcopal church in California.

of Bishops at this moment that created a tan

ton resigned his leadership in the fight he has
waged for ten years Is published in another

Dr. Huntington spoke slowly and clearly, but
It was noticed, by all who were In the church
that his voice trembled with emotion.
'After an adverse vote was taken on the
motion to reconsider Dr. Huntington left the
church and was not present to see his defeat

It was pointed out that parliamentary law did
not allow a report of a conference committee

"This convention," he said, "has created six
new missionary districts, making an additional
charge against its fund of $18,000 for the sup
port of the Missionary Bishops. $500 more in
each case for traveling expenses. A fixed
charge it has created of $21,000; yet there is a
deficit of $100,000. i ask, gentlemen of the con

Rev. -Dr. Clampett was the next speaker. He

Mr. Thomas followed and took umbrage at
the remark made by one of the speakers that
the Board of Missions was composed of a set
of dllletantes, who lived in a' clubhouse in
New York. Mr. Thomas said his worst enemy
would not call him a dllletante. He stated he
did not know what the word meant, but he
was not that. He said the State of Illinois
was rich enough to provide for Bishops coad
jutor and divisions of dioceses. He was* there

strike a month ago. It has always been
difficult to identify the strikers charged
with violence and the experiment of
equipping non-union employes with cam
eras is a novelty likely to prove of prac
tical use.
With shame be it confessed that but too
often the aspirant for missionary labors'
and sufferings has had his ardor quenched
by the chilling words of a Christian father
pointing out the greater opportunity to
gain influence and wealth, power and
happiness in some other calling; and,
stranger still, by the mother who bore him
who cannot endure that he shall leave
all these things to follow Christ. There
must be Christian homes from which shall
come forth Christian heroes. There must
be family altars from which must be taken
the live coals to touch the lips which shall
plead with men for God.
And in this connection we must call upon
our people to guard their homes from the
polluting and destroying Influences which
are ever ready to enter therein. And here
again our present laxity is perhaps due to
strained severity in the dfeys that are past.
The puritanic moroseness which denied
gratification to the healthy instincts de
manding recreation and amusement was
naturally and rightfully opposed by the
Catholic church, and here as elsewhere the
evil one, taking advantage of Inherent
human weakness, has turned our good into
evil, our liberty into license. Because th\
playhouse Is not as the Puritan declared,
the very gateway to the devil's abode, be
cause the delight derived from the artist's
impersonation of the artist's conception is
helpful and elevating to character, be
cause the indiscriminate condemnation of
all dramatic representation may not be
countenanced ' by the reasonable Christian;
alas, it has now come to pass that Indis
criminate approval has taken the place of
condemnation as sweeping, and Christians
are found looking upon mimic scenes
which are wholly depraving, whose art is
only their immorality and their attrac
tiveness only in their appeal to the basest
passions of our nature.
Many of us are old enough to remember
the Indignant refusal of the Christian to
suffer the game of cards to be played under
his roof. The association of the painted
cardboard, with dens of iniquity and their
almost universal use for purposes of gam
ing made them to be proscribed, and the
possibility of their employment for inno
cent recreation denied. We may smile
some of us at this absurd moral distinction
made by our fathers, but better far this
unreasoning arbitrary distinction than the
license of to-day which suffers the pastime
of friends to be polluted by the passion
of the gamester. Wasted hours,, dulled
consciences, careers to end in desoalr be
gun in ladies' drawing-rooms, the gam
bler's madness, degradation, ruin, all alike
are crying out that our freedom Is full
of danger. Oh, fathers, mothers, we
would call so loud that all may hear
throughout our broad landâ fathers, moth
ers arouse ye to the care of the children
whom God hath given you. Wide open are
the channels in which the devouring spirit
of unbelief and immorality is entering to
destroy your little ones. Close them, we
beseech you, and set the watch of your
love that the character of your children
be not blasted ere It come to maturity and
strength and beauty. Gather them about
you on their knees and teach them by word
and example to pray to the Father that
his spirit may be their light and strength.
lect are barred so fast against him? We
answer that first and chief among the fail
ures of our people in the development of
their own spiritual, life and that of their
children. Is the neplect of the cultivation of
religion in the home. We have forgotten in
the bustling pursuit of material prosperity,
in the perhaps overdevelopment of the value
of the individual, that God hath set the soli
tary in families: that the home was the
' germ of the church; that the father is con
secrated high priest of his household, *the
representative of the All Father to them
sprung from his loins; their leader and com
mander in approach to the throne of the
highest, and in pursuit of the paths which
he hath marked out.
How shall the holy one enter and dwell
in the heart of the boy to expel the evil
spirit of base desire, to quicken the pur
pose of self-devotion to the work of God
in the world, to enable the pursuit of only
the things that are pure and honorable
and good report, when the father, who is
to him the very image and representative
of all that is highest, is wholly immersed
in the cares of the world? I How shall the
maiden's heart be made strong by the ani
mating spirit of the holy one to answer to
\u25a0 the heaven-sent messenger come to tell of j
the glory of the Christ who shall be hers,
"Be it unto me according to thy word,"
when the mother who bore her and is right
ly her ideal of highest womanhood, hath a
name to live and is dead, and amid the
hurrying round of frivolity cannot find time
for prayer or holy Scripture? How shall our
children learn the habit of communion with
God in secret prayer when behold there is
no family altar around which they are
called to kneel at morning and at evening,
while the father-priest offers the sacrifice
of their lips, their united prayer and praise?
Ah. herein we believe we find the crying
. evil of our time, the ample explanation of
the church's deficiencies on every hand.
Let us none but one to which we have
already made reference, the unwillingness
of our young men to devote their lives to
the service of God and of man in the min
istry of his holy church. Not we believe
chiefly because of any unwillingness to en
dure hardness; not because of the supposed
cramping and stultification of a manly In
telligence necessary to the acceptance of
the ancient creeds, as has been asserted;
not because of the diminished influence of !
the ministry in our time as compared with .
that it exercised in the days of our fathers; ..
.no, our young men come not up to the helpâ
' of the Lord against the mighty, because",'
they are not trained from childhood to know
the holy Scriptures and thereby to t know
that there is a God, unseen yet omnipotent,
the only \u25a0 wise, the Savior of all men, who
demands the loving service of 'his sons that
all men everywhere may know him and his
salvation. . \u25a0 _

Testament, as that to attain personal holi

FREAChJ A CRUSADE
FOR. MISSION WORK'
Americans, we call upon you to rouse to
the protection of this palladium of our
liberties, our Government, our English
civilization.
And lastly, beloved in the Lord, we bid
you carry iway from our great synod as
the watchword of our battle for the time
to comeâ missions, missions, missions. The
Son of God has been born as man, and to
this end was he born that he miffht de
stroy the works of the devil. The Son of
man has been crucified that by his death
he might destroy death and deliver them
who all their lifetime have been in bond
age through fear of death. He hath spoiled
the strong man death and come forth from
hi3 house bearing the spoils of victory.
He Is gone away to the -Father's right
hand and thence hath sent the Comforter,
the life-giving Spirit, to quicken our spirits
into new life in him, and he hath builded
his church to be the habitation of this
Spirit, the home of the fathful, the wit
ness unto all men of him and his salva
tion. Of that church we are; we are mem
bers of his body; we are sharers of his
spirit, and thereforeâ mark itâ therefore,
we too as he must be busy in the procla
mation of his message of hope. In the min
istration of his gift of life to all men. Mark
that we say not may or ought, but must.
"We cannot but speak the things that we
have seen and heard." The man or woman
who has seen his face has hoard his voice
speaking pardon and blessing cannot but
tell to others the good things he hath done
for all who believe in him and will do for
all who confess his % name.
To one and all alike we appeal thsrt they,
labor and deny themselves to conserve the
sanctity of our American Sunday. It is,
perhaps, not too much to nay, as taught
by the 'specific commandment, embedded
in the very \u25a0 midst of man's moral ' law,
that, the- continuance of -the 'knowledge of
God and of his Son," Jesus Christ, among
men \u25a0 is '.dependent upon ,,onr obedience to
thaOcommaitfl. " "I .. was -tir'<t1Â»- spirit On
the Lord's' day," writes the aged seer- in
Patm'os : when to him came the vision of
the Sen of man. He \u25a0-' separates \u25a0 distinctly
between the Sabbath of the .Hebrew and
the Lord's day of the Christian, and Just
as distinctly between the slavish \u25a0 enact
ments to protect the one and the glorious
liberty of the redeemed by which that
which we guard should be made secure.
The Puritan, not recognizing that the old
had passed away because the new and the
better covenant had corns, sought to con
vert our Christian feast day into the old
Jewish Sabbath, and naturally his striv
ing was in vain. But, alas! again we must
note that our liberty has been enlarged
into license by the spirit of evil, and the
blessing of the rest day threatened by ex
cessive freedom. The church at even
song is almost empty. ' Our boys wander
about the streets and our daughters spend
the solemn hour in gossip or in novel
reading. Why? "Why? Because the father
and mother do not entreat or command
that with them they go up to the temple
at the hour of evening prayer. Fathers,
mothers, churchmen, we, your pastors,
entreat that you rally to the defense of
this mighty citadel of our religion.
One other matter your Bishops feel called
upon to mention in this- connection, and
that is the growing disregard ! of ! the sanc
tity of the Lord's day. That such disre
r rd is increasing among confessed disci
ples of the Lord we fear cannot be denied.
The luxurious Sunday evening banquet of
the rich and the pleasure-loving is a dis
honor to the risen Lord in whose honor the
church has set the day apart; and the^ap-.
proprlatlon of its sacred hours for the ac
complishment of a long journey by the
busy traveler because the week's hours
are all too few for his many engagements
is. a robbery of God, who from Sinai de
manded consecration of our time to his
remembrance and worship, and \u25a0 placed the â¢
â¢law- of the Sabbath In the midst of -the
moral commandments of perpetual obli
gation. Far less worthy of condemnation
in the eyes of the all wise and all merci
ful, we can but believe is the Sunday out
ing of the perhaps overworked ". artisan,
who from Monday morning till Saturday
night never sees his children save when
asleep, and. yet we are persuaded that he
may. be taught that fuller happiness shall
be his if he shall have led his children to
God's house and worship before he carries
them to green fields and romping holiday.
But it â¢ is a shame and only a shame, be
cause no excuse can be- found for it, in the
condition of our life, that golf grounds
shall be crowded on Sunday afternoons,
that servants shall be denied . their . due
and- well-earned rest day, that the beasts
in our stables shall know no Sabbath, be
cause the athletes, men and women, must
be driven in cushioned comfort to the
scene of their Sunday sports, and return
ing, have their wearied frames refreshed
and feasted.
So shall they go forth by and by to be
VBllant soldiers and diligent servants of the
risht.. \u25a0 â¢

in the misty atmosphere which surrounds

as trees walking": can see but the physical
and the material, and the intellectual as

and to-day the ideal of Christian manhood
as it shines through the. atmosphere of
which this time-spirit has surrounded it is

antly asserted, cair.i not to be ministered
onto but to minister, and he best follows
in his train who is thus busy witfi tlie sup
ply of human necessities and the soothing
of human rain. But the added words of
this same ScriDture are forgotten in the
ideals set up for admiration to-day con
tain not the feature of self-sacrifice, but
the deliverance of the many. The soldier
dying on a lonely battle-field, the 6allor
hÂ»Â»ro going down with his ship that others
msj- be saved, the physician hero adventur
ing himself fearlessly into the pestilence,
with the consecrated sister by his side â this
figure is dwarfed into nothingness by the
atmosphere of our time ic comparison with
the successful accumulator of a mountain
of wealth- ThÂ» ideal of our age is material,
if commercial, whereas the ideal set up by
Jes.us Christ Is spiritual, is essential, self
sacrifice, and the difficulties which con
fror.t us on every hand are due to this
contrariety, and to the constant and un
ccaeinff effort of The evil one to unite the
two in that which snail satisfy the dis
ciple and yet leave him to pursue his own
ends while he still calls himself Christian.
We mean not now to consider the origin
of this destructive philosophy \u25a0which has
seized possession of the minds ot our age.
Be it the great progress of natural science,
as is claimed by many, or be It the too
reckless handling of our sacred books, as
others assert; or be It the effect of these
two Influences, the one perhaps producing
the other, no matter, the condition exists,
and its effects are manifest in many dif
ferent directions, all alike hostile to the
faith which is in Jesus Christ, and to the
upbuilding of manhood by the power of
that faith. We would note some of these
effects, and would suggest some methods
of meeting these exhibitions of the spirit
of eviL
It rray not be amiss to premise that here
Â«ls elsewhere the overstrained interpreta
tion, of truth in any one direction is the
opportunity and the provocation of a con
sequent laxity, and of an equally false ex
oneration to the other extreme. The
church did teach from the beginning- that
the Holy Scripture Is the word of God; that
"holy men of old spake as they were moved
by the Holy Ghost." But the Scripture it
eelf furnished no theory of inspiration, and
the church declared none. The pryinr in
telligence of man was dissatisfied with such
undefined assurance of certainty, and one
theory' followed another with cumulating
assertion of the infallible accuracy of every
Â» statement, of every description, concerning
every subject in the sacred book, till at
' last it was affirmed that the human ele
ment in these writings was nothing and the
inspired writers were but as lifeless material
instruments through which the voice of the
Hplrit made itself audible. Then came the
natural and almost Inevitable denial of
statements scientific. numerical, geo
graphical, historical, upon the authority of
â¢ external witness almost incontrovertible.
The contradictions of the sacred authors of
one another, thoueh manifestly concerning 1
matter* or no moment and matters all
epart from the one purpose which Holy
Scripture was given to serve, and them
eelves the highest evidence of the individ
ual honesty of the historians, and of the
resulting value of their records, -were ex
ploited in the face of the world as flagrant
disproof of the asserted claim to infallible
accuracy, and so as proof of the worth
lecsness of the pretended revelation. Even
the differently recorded title upon the
\u25a0wondrous cross was flouted in our faces
as all-sufficient proof that the Gospel
story may not be received by well-tutored
reason, because forsooth the variation in
that record does show that every word
and every syllable of the Scripture cannot
be taken as the very utterance of the spirit
of truth. And the result is reached at last
when we are told that the Bible is but as
any other book, and to be treated by the
student in the same way; that the claim
for any rupernatural jruldance of its
writers in any degree is vain; that even
the historians of the New Testament In
making record of the story which they
heard of the doings of their time used only
the intellisrence and the diligence which
any reporter of great events would em
ploy; that the Apostles Paul. Peter and
John made inferences from these reported
facts, as any of us might do, and as every
nne of us is equally entitled to do. Because
the Bible must be no longer fetish, it
jt -nay be no longer a guide. This we be

have our life. Because that spirit changes,
because that enfolding atmosphere is dif
ferent now from any that before did en
compass Christian warriors, therefore It Is
that new dangers are apparent and new
methods of warfare must be employed.
The spirit of our age Is not one of aggres
sive, angry denial, but rather of one of lazy,
indifferent consent. It Is more than willing
to build and to decorate the sepulchres of
the old ideals of valorous righteousness,
for to it those ideal* are dead. It will re
cite with soul-Ftirring emphasis of choral
harmony the ancient symbol of all-conquer
ing truth, but to it this is but a form of
sound words beautiful and venerable, with
out relation to the conquest of self or of
the world, without expected or desired re
mit in the formation of character. So It
thinks, and speaks, and yet cannot let go
the one hope that has cheered and illumined
the climbing path of man's development ;
and so in some sense the old creed must be
confessed, and with some sort of devotion
the old sacraments received. The institu
tion of the catholic church must be de
fended and supported, that its voice of mys
tery may speak words of blessing, possible,
though uncertain, pleasing, though unwar
ranted, at the bridal and the burial, upon
the head of the infant new come to earth's
trials, and into the dull ear of the pilgrim
ready to depart. Rut such shadowy neces

of a man's life, and it shall be reasonably
given to the pursuit of ends which are
plainly visible, and as plainly possible of
attainment. Beneficence Is true religion.
as the wise man James did write, and all
the rest Is but mystery and vanity. The

But the night Is still round about us, and
we therefore pray you, brethren, to suffer
the word of exhortation, that we may tell
you the specially pressing dangers it en
folds, and our thought of the duties thence
specially arising for you and for us. that
"the King shall have ro damage."
Perhaps we may desr-ribe the chief hin

Alas, that part of the price is municipal
or national dishonor and degradation. The
citizen who first selfishly refuses to do his
civic duty, and then in natural descent along
the easy path becomes the giver of bribe
and the corrupter of his fellows is himself
degraded more and more in the process, and
the bottom is found when civic rights and
civic righteousness are alike forgotten, when
duty to his neighbor no longer demands per
formance, when protection to weakness, the
equality of freemen, the conservation of
honesty, are no longer the ends of the Gov
ernment, but only the securing of peculiar
privileges for a class, the comfortable en
joyment of a protected license: when duty to
man is forgotten because duty to God is
denied. Are not these exhibitions of the
spirit of lawlessness in plainest view
throughout our land? But the question
keeps repeating itself, how shall we, as a
church: how shall we, as Christian men and
Christian ministers, resist this onflowing
tide of lawless, godless materialism? How
shall we make the Christian faith again to
be the inspiration of victory, the efficient
motA-e of self-sacrifice, the artificer of no
blest character? By what power may the
spirit of commercial ambition, the spirit of
selflish aggrandizement, the spirit of devo
tion tp the seen and the temporal, be driven
from the chambers of our people's soul that
a nobler, higher spirit may enter in? The
answer is at once obvious and easy to be
learned from our sacred books, that God
the* Holy Ghost alone can work this mir
acle. Beyond all controversy the one su
preme need of human nature for its cleans
ing, its lnvigoratlon, its development to
higher, nobler manhood, is the indwelling
of the spirit of God. This is but a com
monplace of the teaching of our Master and
his apostles. But we ask in -view of the
peculiar difficulties of our time, what are
the special hindrances which prevent his
access to the souls of our children; what are
the closed doors and windows through which
he should enter in, but which by our neg-
But we must bid you note and strive
against the last and most evil result of our
age tendency in the reckless spirit of in
dividual license, the caricature and con
tradiction of that ideal of personal liberty
which the church has created and per
petuated among men. The fool who saith
in his heart there is no God is quick to
go forward is the natural corollary that
there is no human authority of right de
manding his recognition and obedience.
The man who derides the revealed foun
dation of all ethical obligation is the easy
victim of the devil's delusion that self-in
terest Is the sole motive of human action
and self-advancement the only test of
moral conduct. And finally the defiant
denial of the God who ordalneth finds
culmination in the assertion that there
shall be no longer powers or human gov
ernment to whom in superstitious faith
obedience has been rendered and anarchy
is born as the legitimate offspring of* un
belief. The crime at Buffalo, a month
arose, by which the head of our nation
was token away, was but the natural fruit
of this tree of- God-defying denial. The
great and good President was slain by the \u25a0;
spirit of our "age. \u25a0 But" we must recog-,
nlze that this awful crime, thrice repeat
ed within forty years, is the offspring of
the spirit of lawlessness, full grown to
maturity of malevolence, and that other
children of the same evil spirit are close
about us on every hand, themselves the
strength of the family of lawlessness, who
make possible and certain these giant mon
sters whose deeds of violence have
shocked our souls. The failure' of the
citiren of a republican government to do
his duty In the endeavor to elect honost
and true men as the officers of that eov
ernment is the earliest political manifes
tation of this pernicious life. The selfish
indifference which, governed by disgust,
is content that the city or the State -shall
be given up Into the hands of the least
reputable people in it rather than do
valiant and painful battle to preserve
the ballot's purity and the honesty of
official administration, this the tiny germ
which in due and well-ordered develop
ment grows into -the vigor which threat
ens our very social life. It is cheaper,
men think and even say, to let the Gov
ernment be in the hands of the corrupt
than to labor and to suffer to keep it in
the hands of the honest and upright. The
venial Legislature can be easily pur
chased and the ends good citizens are seek- \u25a0
ing easily secured. The rights of corpo
rations can be made safe by putting mon
ey Into the purse of the guardians of the
State; the privileges we desire can be ours
for a price, and that price is less than
must be paid for honest administration of
public affairs.

himself, and that, therefore, there can be
no contradiction of nature by revelation.
We are eager to deny the identity of
Christ's revelation with any man's under

set by man's theory as to the operation of
the Godhead by which is given the knowl

We entreat the recognition of the purpose
for which holy Scripture was given and of
the fact that nowhere is there promised
revelation of any truth which has not refer

until the beeinning of the afternoon session
to withhold the questions. This decision was
then rtathed, largely because it was believed
that the information intended to be elicited by
the questions could be secured in a more di
rect and certain way by Lieutenant McCau
ley's testimony regarding signals on July S.
The questions which had been formulated for
presentation previous to McCauley's taking the
stand related principally to the movements of
Admiral Sampson's flagship, the. New York, on
July 3. the day of the battle off Santiago, and
especially to the signals of that day directing
the fleet to disregard the flagship's movements.
It Is still the Intention to present other ques
tions Involving Admiral Sampsons relation to
the inquiry before the close of the case. It
seems probable that their presentation will be
deferred until a time shortly before the begin
ning, cf Admiral Schley's testimony. â¢
JUNIOR OFFICERS ARE HEARD
Ensigns and Others on the Brooklyn
Tell of Schley's Acts.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17-The
presentation of Admiral
Schley's side of the controver
sy was continued before the
rourt of Inquiry to-day, eight
witnesses . being examined. Of these live
wore ensigns, and the entire eight- bad
served on boar<3 Che Brooklyn with Admiral
(then commodre) Schley. The ilrst of the
day's witnesses was Lieutenant Charles
Webster. â¢ who had begun -his \u25a0 testimony
yesterday. He was followed by Lieuten
ant Commander T. D. Grlflln, who had
charge of the powder division of the
Brooklyn during the fight off Santiago,
and he was succeeded by Ensigns C. A.
Abele, John Halligan Jr.. Ulysses S.
Maoy. James M. Hand and Ralph N.
Marble. The last witness of the day was
Mcdlcnl Director Paul Fitzsimmons, who
v,-as chief surgeon of the flying scjuadrop.
While Kr.sicn HalllRan was on the stand
Raynor sought to bring out information
H8*to<1tiu American ships in sight at the
beginning of the battle of July 3, but
Judge Advocate Lemly objected on the
ground that the question was Intended to
show thÂ« absence of the New York, and
the interrogatory was withdrawn. Knsign
Marble stated that he had heard Captain
Sigsbee tell Commodore Schley when he
came aboard the Brooklyn on May 28 that
the Spaniards were not at Santiago.
There has been some inquiry as to Ad
miral Schley's standing in the navy since
he was placed on the retired list because
of age. but It appears that all questions
on this point have been settled by the
department having assigned the admiral
to "active duty" at the court of inquiry
while it is in progress. This action was
taken to prevent any questions as to the
effect the admiral's retirement . would
have on the action of the court.

July 3 from his standootnt. He had observer
the encasement from the gun deck of the

Schley After the Battle.
Dr. Fitzsimmons, In reply to a question from
Raynbr, said that he had not seen Commodore
Schley during the engagement, but that he
had met him about 1:30 o'clock, soon after
its close. Asked by Raynor what the com
modore's appearance was at that time, the
witness replied: '
"He was hardly able to talk, and complained
of an irritation. In his .throat from the effects
of the smoke. He appeared to be exultant
over the victory. He was so choked with
smoke he could hardly make himself under-
Taking the witness for cross-examination.
Hanna asked:
"Have you anything In your knowledge re

dore or anything else?" â¢
"I can onlv say this." was the reply, "unless
you ask me specific questions that I do not
know anything t& the commodore's discredit.
IÂ» think that the Brooklyn kept thÂ« Colon
from getting away."
"Was the Oregon there?"
"Yes: 1 made her out. She kept her position
until about the end of the run." .
Dr Fitzsimmons, in speaking of the voyage
to Santiago, said that the weather was rough
and that the commodore had thought of send
ing the Eagle away, but had hesitated. Thla
statement caused the court to ask the witness
if he knew the cause of the hesitation, and
he replied that he had heard the commodore
talking about it.
"He seemed to think the Eagle's speed was
lacking He said he wanted to keep the squad
ron intact if he could, but the Eagle kept the
fleet back."
Dr. Fitzsimmons was then excused and the
court adjourned for the day.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1901.
Raynor â It has been a very successful-recon
noitsance in developins you.
Judge advocateâ So far as we do it if the
court please, we would like to' have this mat
ter decided now and here.
Captain Parkerâ If we withdraw the question
there is nothing before the court.
Judge advocateâ I am before the court.
Captain Parkerâ But there is nothing before
the court in the question whether you are
there or not.
Judge advocateâ It is a part of these very
questions .that were submitted to me yesterday
and afterward withdrawn, but it was subse
quently brought in by the witness in the shape
of signals.
Mr. Raynor at this point requested permission
to withdraw for five minutes for a consultation
with Admiral Schley, which the court granted.
While proceeding to the consultation room the
judge advocate started to address the court,
whereupon Raynor . informed him that "he
could speak while they were gone."
Raynor. after his conference with Admiral
Sohley, announced to the court that they would
withdraw the question for the time being.
In reply to questions by the court Halligan
said that when the Viscaya turned toward the
Brooklyn "the Spanish ship bore on our star
board beam, a little forward, and was headed
toward us, distant from 2000 to 3000 yards."
He also said that there- were t three or four
guns heard at Cienfuegos and that these shots
were regular.
Cadet Saw the Signals,
"When Halligan retired he was succeeded by
Ensign U. S. Macy, who -was a naval cadet on
the Brooklyn during the Spanish war. He said
he had heard no guns at Clenfuegos, but had
seen the signal lights ashore.
Raynor asked the witness If he had .had any
conversation with Commodore Schley during the
night before the engagement of May: 31. He
replied that he had a conversation.
"I was on the signal bridge of the Brooklyn.
After dinner," he said, "when the commodore
came upon the bridge, and during the course
of the conversation stated to me 'To-morrow we
are going In with the ships not coaling to bom
bard at long range to develop the exact location
of batteries and to form an estimate of their
strength.' He said he was not going- in for a
regular bombardment, . as he had Instructions
from the department not to hazard the ships
against these batteries and that if he should
disable one of his ships during this boombard
ment his force would then be rendered Inferior
to the Spanish forces Inside the harbor; that he
was going in merely for a reconnolssance and
not to destroy the batteries or the Colon." \u25a0
The witness said that he had, been on the gun
deck during the battle of July 3. The Brook
lyn pursued a sinuous course, he said, at the
beginning of the engagement and then swung
rapidly to starboard with port helm. His least
range was 12C0 yards and his greatest 2300
yards.
Three Cheers for the Commander.
On cross-examination Captain '\u25a0 Lemly ques
tioned the witness especially about the latter's
conversation with Commodore Schley on the
night of May 30. Macy said that he did not
know from whom the commodore had received
his orders not to endanger the ships by ex
posing them to shore batteries, and that he
had never seen the order himself. He knew
of no other officer present when the conversa
tion occurred, but the signal officer and one or
twr> men were within hearing.
The next witness waa James A. Hand, also
an ensign, who had served on : the Brooklyn
as a naval cadet.. He testified that on the
day of the battle, of. July 3 he was at the
central station, and received from Commodore
Schley and Captain Cook encouraging mes
sages to the men, and that one of these from
the commodore was . received with a "three
cheers . for the commodore." *
Ensign Ralph N. Marble, who was a cadet
on the Brooklyn - during the war, said that on
the day of the battle of , Santiago he had had
charge of some of the after six-Inch guns.
His closest range was 1100 yards. The orderlies
had passed the. range of 900 yards to him,
but he had not Used that range. . .
Would Bam the Brooklyn.
"Did any Spanish ships show a disposition to
Marble related a conversation- he had heard
between- Captain Sigsbee and- Commodore
Schley - wh-en the . former came aboard the
Brooklyn, May 26, oft Santiago. r \u25a0 \u25a0
The commodore had asked the captain, the
\u25a0witness said: "Have we got them?"
To this Inquiry Captain Sigsbee replied:
"No; they are not there.. I have been here for
about a week. They could not have been
here unless I knew It."
: On cross-examination the witness-'- said he
had satisfied hlmseVf of the date of. 'the con
versation by referring to the Brooklyn's log.
He was not. .more than seven or. eight feet
from the two' officers at the time, and he
thought he had given their exact words. |
. The court then asked the following questions
of Ensign Marble: â¢ Â»
Raynorâ Of course, I: want "to state to my
friend that I will not press this question now,
but, there is a stage of the case where I,wlil
have to bring it up. I submitted questions to
my brother yesterday.; They were not ac
cepted.- j I will withdraw it now. â¢
Judge advocateâ We will have to .enter thla
on the record as another reconnoissanca.
"Wrangle Between Counsel.
Ensign John Halllgan Jr., who served on
the Brooklyn, was the first witness of the aft
ernoon session of the court. Referring to the
blockade of Cienfuegos he recalled on the 22d
the Brooklyn steamed past the entrance to
the -harbor, and that the ship had gone to
within about a mile of the harbor. He also
recalled that the Adula had reported that the
Spaniards had left Santiago. '
When the battle of July 3 occurred he was
In" the port turret. The shortest range used
by him during the engagement was, he said,
1200 yards.
Asked as to Commodore' Schlejrs bearing In
the battle the witness said it was "such as to
inspire enthusiasm." â¢ . \u25a0
"Do you know what vessels were In sight
at the beginning of the battler* asked Raynor.
\u25a0 "Hold on there'." exclaimed Captain Lemly,
before the witness could reply. "I object.'*
Captain Lemly stated that the precept did
not call for the position of ships except to
show whether they endangered the Brooklyn.
Replying, Raynor said that the question was
similar to other questions which had been ad
mitted. ' . '
\u25a0 "I believe that it "is an Invasion of the de
cision of the court already rendered with re
gard to going Mnto this matter of the positions
of vessels," said Captain Lemly. "Now, with
regard to the relative positions at the beginning
of the battle I have excepted from my ob
jection so much as relates to /the possibility
of collision, which is a distinct part of the
precept. The position of the Brooklyn at the
beginning of the battle is called for distinctly
and in terms â¢ but that of no other vessel.
Except, as I have stated. In so far as it in
volves the possibility of collision, this, I think,
is objectionable and I submit the matter to
ths court.'' . .
Inspires Enthusiasm.
Abele said there was a heavy surf at Cien
fuegos while the flying squadron lay oft that
place, and that when the start was made
toward Santiago the weather was rough and
unsettled, though It was not bad for large
ships. Morro Castle was in sight, he said,
upon the arrival off Santiago.
' "Do you recollect about the blockade of
May 29 in front of Santiago?"
"Yes. At night we steamed back and forth
in front of the harbor at a distance of five
or six miles. At night I saw signaling going
on between the harbor and the fort. . The sys
tem of signaling waa that used in the English
navy, blinking white light, and I judged It
was the Colon signaling to the fort. It hap
pened on two occasions."
"Could you see that plainly?"
"Very plainly indeed."
The witness in describing the battle of July
3 said that he had had charge of the port
battery on the main deck forward, and that
when the Spanish vessels first came out of
the harbor he could not train? his guns on
'them because of the distance. Later he
opened fire and he observed that the lead-
Ing Spanish ship held steadily on the Brook
lyn's port bow for some time anrt then turned
to the westward. His range then was 1400
yards, and the lowest range at which he fired
during the day was 1100 yards.
The court asked what were the relative po
sitions of the Viscaya, the Colon and the
Brooklyn when the starboard guns oC the
Brooklyn were flred by the witness at a range
of 1100 yards.
He replied that the two Spanish ships were
"well abaft the starboard beam of the Brook
lyn, the Viscaya being ahead of the Colon."
This, he said, was after the turn of the
Brooklyn. \u25a0 \u25a0 . \u25a0 . . â¢
Ensign, Abele then retired and the court
took a recess for luncheon.
Lieutenant Commander Griffln was excused
and Ensign C. A. Abele, who, as a naval ca
det, served as a Junior watch officer on the
Brooklyn in the Santiago campaign, was
called.
Told by an Ensign.
Raynorâ Isn't It a fact that the derrick beams
on the collier were too short, and were not
coaling breeches rigged on all of the ships in
order to coal?
"That is the case of the Brooklyn. I can
not say about the other ships."
By the courtâ What difficulties did the Brook
lyn have in coaling off Santiago, prior to
June l?
"I do not think there was any difficulty dur
ing those dates."
"I em not sure."
"Was It the roughness of the sea that made
it- difficult for the Yale 'to take the Merrlmac
in tow or that' caused the hawsers to part?"
The ' court asked
'Having said that when the fleet left Clen
fuegos it was the general understanding that
it was bound for Santiago, "the witness under
questions by Hanna stated that th.e fleet was
headed east when it stopped south of Santiago
May 26. He said in reply to a further question
that if the squadron had continued as then
headed it would have landed "anywhere to the
eastward."

"Then 'in your answer you except retro

Schley Sent the : Messages.

witness by stating that^lt did not appear that
Commodore Schley sent these messages, which

iage3 of encouragement to the men.
Commander Griffin said that when the Colon

:he Brooklyn's starboard quarter and that the
rexaa and Vixen were within sight astern, a
"Can you speaK of the- conduct, bearing and
manner of 'Commodore' Schley during the en
jagement in which you saw him?"
"He Impressed me as being remarkably cool,
:onsiderlng what had Just occurred. He was
perfectly natural in manner -and bearing."
On cross-examination Captain Lemly. ques
tioned the witness closely concerning the well-
Icnown trip to" Santiago, the sending away of
the Eagle for coal and the blockade at Cien
tuegos. Reading from the Brooklyn's log, he
?ald that at the time of the. Eagle's departure
the sea was recorded as moderate. He also,
at Captain Lemly's request,, again detailed the
position of the Oregon when the Colon sur
rendered, saying that vessel .was from 600. to
302 yards on the starboard qunrter of the
Brooklyn, slightly inshore. The two vessels
were headed In practically parallel lines.
Hanna"asked: ' .
"Did you hear Commodore Schley say any-'
thing about leaving Clenfuegos?"
"I did not." \u25a0 '
"Or coaling difficulties?"
"I do not remember. I know he was always
extremely anxious, and seemed to coal when
ever there wan an opportunity. I do not re
member any particujar conversation.. The con
versation about going to Guantanamo impressed
me â¢\u25a0â¢particularly because afterward I -thought
It was such a. wise decision.'.'-; \u25a0- \u25a0 -.
"Did you ever have any conversation with
Commodore Schley before July 3 relating to the
Brooklyn going to Guantanamo for coal?"
"In substance, I' mentioned the fact that
other ships of the squadorti were in the habit
of going to Guantanamo for coal. We had had
some difficulty in coaling in the open off San
tiago. The commodore replied that he had* been
asked on several occasions if he would like to
go -to Guantanamo, . where he could coal quick
ly and give the officers and men a rest from
the strain of the blockade. . . '
"He said that his answer was in each case
that he preferred to remain on the station until
the Spanish ships came out of the harbor."
Referring to the battle .of July 3, the wit
ness said, that he had been In charge of the
powder division and that it also was his duty
to look after the lower decks. â¢ Consequently he
had not seen a great deal of the flght.
He said that he had seen the Vlscaya going
ashore and that, looking abaft the Brooklyn's
beam, along the coast, he 'had seen two other
Spanish ships on fire, with the Colon some dis
tance ahead on the starboard side, and firing
occasionally. Then he went into the forecastle,
where Commodore Schley, :Captain Cook and
Commander Mason were standing, remaining
there until the Colon surrendered. The Ore
gon was. he said, then following very close to
the Brooklyn. â¢\u25a0â¢ ?
"Were any cheering or encouraging messages
sent among the men that you know of, by
whom and what were they?"
"I had a messenger who made frequent trips
to the gun deck and who reported to me what
was happening. I conveyed this Information
to the men of my division in the different
handling rooms."
"Were any. of these messages of sufficient
Importance tnat you would like to speak of
them?" â¢ --"*'
"One message which seemed to cheer the
men below very much was that there were
three Spanish ships ] on our starboard beam,
all firing at us."
\u25a0. "You do not know who sent these messages,
who gave them, do you?"/-- \u25a0
"I took it for grantedâ "
Conversations Concerning 1 Coal.
tenant Commander Griffin was called. He gave
details of the Clenfuegos campaign,- saying
that the distance of the blockading line there
varied from three to seven miles, being farther
out at niarht.
Speaking of the voyage from Cienfuegos to
Santiago the witness said the weather was
"heavy" and that there was a "short, choppy
sea." He also said that the heavy sea had
impeded the fleet by delaying the smaller ves
sels, especially the Eagle.
Asked by Raynor concerning a conversation
between 'Commodore Schley and the commander
of the Eagle, the -witness said: . : . - -
l ' "I was present when the -conversation toolc
place, although I cannot give the exact words.
When the Eagle came up astern' of the Brook
lyn the commodore hailed the commanding of
ficer of that vessel and told him in substance
that he could not delay the squadron any
longer on his account, and that he â¢wanted
him to proceed to Jamaica for coal. The com
manding officer of the Eagle seemed very, de
sirous of remaining with the squadron, and
expressed sincere regret at being obliged to
part company with the flying squadron.". .
"What kind of weather was the Eagle en
countering on Hay 26, when that conversation
took place?" ' . .
"As I expressed it, heavy weather, a short
choppy sea. and the Eagle and Vixen were
both pitching considerably."
"Did you hear the commanding officer of the
Eagle talk to the commodore about coal on that
occasion?"
"I do not remember."
"You heard the whole conversation?"
"I did, but I do n^t remember .that he asked
permission to coal. It would, not have been
possible; at least, it would not have been safe."
At Santiago, the witness said, the block
ading line was a mile or two closer in at night
than during the day, and on May 29 the fleet
stood out three or four miles. There were pick
et-boats Inside the lines, but ha did not see
them.

Rheumatism is the cause of half our aches and pains;
rheumatism comes quickly and remains a long time unless â¢
removed at once. *
The changeable weather which always comes at the be-
ginning of winter, is likely to bring out the rheumatism and
all rheumatic sufferers should be prepared â they should have
a bottle of Halprun'er's Rheumatism Cure at hand where \
1 they can take it instantly, where they can rub it on the ach-
ing parts and rub out the pain, so that- they may take it in-
ternally to remove the cause.
A few applications of Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine
will- cure a new case of rheumatism and a few applications
will relieve an* old one, and constant treatment will cure it
permanently.
Rheumatism of long duration requires persistent treat-
ment â you cannot scet well in a jlay and. you should not ex-
pect it, but keep on taking Halpruner's and you are sure to
get well, for it contains exactly the right ingredients to cure
, rheumatism.
All druggists should sell Halpruner's â some may not â
Iâ if you cannot get it of your druggist, telephone to Bush'
463, Halpruner Medical Manufacturing Co., 28 California
street, and a bottle will be delivered.

So much news that makes painful read-
Ing comes from Russia that it is always
a pleasure to learn of those noble or gen
erous acts which reveal the brighter side
of the Muscovite character and help us
to remember that the country is, after all,
a part of Europe. The latest is a very
munificent bequest for philanthropic pur
poses, which, had It been given In any
other civilized country but Russia, would
soon have become a topic of worldwide
comment. But a generous deed from a
Russian to Russia remains almost un
noticed outside 'the realms of the Czar.
Gawril Szlodownikow, who was a man of

to be devoted to the erection of high
schools In Moscow where girls will obtain
the necessary classical education to qual
ify them for a university career, while
the remainder is to be spent in equal parts,
on the establishment of schools for me

THE BANKRUPT LAW.
To repeal the law and return to uncertain depend
ence on State statutes would be a mistake, injurious
alike to insolvents and their creditors and to the busi
liess of the country.
It is claimed by the credit men of the country that
the Â«xisting bankrupt law passed in 1898 has put an"
end to chattel mortgage failures and fake confessions
of judgment, has made preferences rare if not impos
sible, has put the administration of bankrupt es
tates in the hands of trustees chosen by the creditors
and not by the debtor, has increased dividends and
reduced the cost of administration and without con
tracting credit has made the creditor more secure.
All these effects having appeared in the administra
tion of the law, it should not be repealed, but
should remain, as a permanent means of protecting
the rights of creditors, , giving them share and share
alike in a bankrupt estate, and as a means of dis
charging the insolvent debtor and enabling him by
enterprise to restore his lost fortune.
Without such general statute of bankruptcy the
varying statutes of the States must be appealed to,
and they are deficient in effectiveness. Our commerce
is so largely interstate that the credits necessary to
its operation become interstate credits. Foreseeing
these conditions, the makers of the constitution wisely
provided for an interstate bankrupt law.
THE constitution gives" Congress the power to
pass a general bankrupt law that shall have
equal application to all the States and safeguard
business by that very equality of operation. .

No one but his body attendant knows
where the Sultan may sleep during any
particular night. He has electric ~light3
and telephones in his own apartments
but forbids them in Constantinople Tele
phones might prove handy for conspira

cartridge could be sent over a wire into
the palace. He fears electric explosions
so Constantinople still gets alonjr -with

Once when the Prince of Samoa was re
tiring from an audience he stumbled in
his backward steps and fell. In a mo
ment the Sultan had pressed a spring be
hind him. The .wall' opened and he van
ished within, Bafe from the suspected at
tack. Abrupt gestures in his presence
often cost dear. Several victims are men
tioned, one a gardener in the royal park,
whom Abdul shot dead for rising too
quickly to an attitude of respect. Another

and he had her tortured In the hope of
revealing a plot.

there will be a strong effort made to bring it about
at the coming session of Congress. The subject is
not a new one, and the public is familiar with the
arguments for it. In fact the proposed department
was indorsed by the Republican National Convention
at Philadelphia, and accordingly it has a rightful
claim upon the attention of the Government.
While the arguments which the great commercial
States of the Union are thus putting forth for the
Department of Commerce are valid they' are not
more so than are those which have been repeatedly
urged by Western men in favor of creating a Depart
ment of Mines and Mining. The two movements
therefore might well be taken up together. If both
be supported by the friends of each the chances ,of
success will be much greater than if each be left to
stand alone.
The nation has been slow in establishing depart
ments for the better administration of its expanding
business. Under the Presidency of Washington there
were but four departments â those of the State,
the Treasury, War and Law. During the admin
istration of John Adams it was found necessary to
separate the management of the navy from that of
the army, and accordingly the Navy Department
was established. No further addition was made until
the Presidency of Jackson, when the Postmaster
General was raised to a seat in the Cabinet. The
Department of the Interior was found necessary dur
ing the administration of Tyler, the first Secretary of
that department being appointed in 1849; and it was
not until 1889 that the great and growing agricul
tural interests of the .country were given representa
tion in the executive branch of the Government by
the creation of the Department of Agriculture.
It requires no argument to show intelligent men
that as the nation advances in population and in
wealth and becomes more and more complex in its
industries there must arise from time to time the
need for further divisions of the vast work of admin
istration. Our commerce has now reached such pro
portions that it is absurd to leave its affairs divided
between the State Department, the Agricultural De
partment and the Treasury, holding a subordinate po
sition in each. If the work now done by the Bureau
of Statistics of the Treasury Department and that of
the similar bureau in the Agricultural Department
and the Bureau of Foreign Commerce in the State
Department were concentrated under one control
and expanded so as to meet the needs of the country
it would amply justify the placing of a Cabinet officer
at the head of it.
Governmental work in relation to mines and min
ing is at present even more scattered than the work
done for commerce. The mining men have repeated
ly pointed out that in order to get information which
the Government has to bestow they have at times to
run from bureau to bureau, only to find at last that
while one has authority in one thing and another in
something else there is no central authority to bring
all the mining affairs of the Government into har
mony and consistency: By reason of the confusion
that prevails there results not only something of in
efficiency in the Governmental supervision of mining
matters but an absolute waste and loss in many di
rections.
It is to be hoped the mining men will be able to
present their case at Washington as strongly as is
that of the commercial men. There is no reason
why the two departments should not be created at
the same time. The nation needs both of them and
should therefore have both of them.
NEW CABINET OFFICERS.
The residents of a New Jersey village are firmly
convinced that a ghost is enjoying itself running a
sawmill, much to their disgust. Perhaps a change in
the brand of the village whisky might work as a
remedy.
AN INDIGNANT CRITIC.
THE Warden of Auburn prison makes the state
ment that several thousand sympathetic letters
have been received there for the assassin,
Czolgos*,. and a large number of express packages
containing presents, of flowers and fruit. The War
den says it would be ;i matter of surprise if the names
of many of these correspondents and gift-senders
should be made public.
The publication of their action is sufficiently sur
prising to the country. No one objects to any effort
intended to rehumanize the assassin in his last days
by offering a chance to repent through tht softening
processes dictated by religion. But there is a great
distance between this and the sensual satisfactions
implied in the gifts of flowers and dainties. It is known;
that such attentions to a pervert like this assassin are
always misconstrued. They are taken as evidence of
his importance in the world and feed that vanity
which exhibits him to himself as a hero who has
done a great deed and made' for himself an immortal
famÂ«. Instead of having a rehumanizing effect they
produce its opposite, and rather than inducing a soft
and repentant mood they confirm the murderous dis
position which led to his crime.
We know of no instance in which such a degen
erate has been in any way reformed for a better life,
or prepared, in a Christian sense, for the death which
awaited him, by such misplaced sympathy. To a certain
order of minds crime seems to present itself as a rea
son for the bestowment of attentions which are not
given to the innocent, no matter how suffering nor
how worthy. The sympathetic people who are un
regulated by common sense immediately invest the
criminal with a glamour of romance and offer atten
tions which are almost invariably misconstrued. -It
is quite a shock that such people have gone to the
extent of trying to pander to the abnormal self
csteem and self-approval of the miserable murderer
of the President, and the country heartily approves
the action of the Auburn Warden in arresting their
misplaced attentions, -so that they are not bestowed
up6n their unworthy object.
In another view of it such exhibitions of addle
pated sympathy are extremely harmful. If they af
fected only the people who indulge them and the in
tended recipient public feeling might stop at mere ex
pressions of disapproval and disgust. But they go
far beyond this. They appeal to the perverted class
to which this assassin belongs. Every one who is
like him takes such things as an expression of ap
proval of the crime he committed, and an affirmation
of the principles that he attempted to promote by
murder. We do not hesitate to say that the thou
sands of maudlin letter writers and senders of dain
ties to the assassin have done as much thereby to
promote anarchy and murder as all of the' open
anarchist propaganda put together. They deserve
exposure. Their names should be published as a
proper punishment of their folly and to deter other
fools from repeating the exhibition.
We are aware that sentimentalists may accuse us
of decrying the carrying of consolation to the guilty,
who needs it the more in proportion to the great
ness of his guilt. But as we understand the plan and
teachings of religion these fleshly satisfactions are not
listed among the ways that are taken to minister to
that spiritual change which religion seeks to work in
the criminal and the guilty. These ways may be used
without offense by these who minister them, and
without in any way encouraging in others the crim
inal tendency which may inflict further wrongs upon
society;, .
: ;It seems to us that the distinction should be plain
to a- healthy mind, and that it is clear to a vast ma
jority of the American people is evidence that the
normal mind, the sober mind, prevails in this country
and makes up that wholesome public opinion which
condemns assassination and despises those who make
a business of coddling assassins. 5
Sir Thomas Lipton is not to be permitted to chal
lenge the America's cup with the same boat next
year. He has therefore ample time to get over his
disappointment and make up his mind whether he
will wait two years to give Shamrock II another
chance or build another boat.
A NEEDED REFORM.
Whitecaps near an Ohio village' are said to be
poisoning the fruit of orchards in order to purchase
the land cheaply. This ought to suggest to the fruit
growers an excellent opportunity to decorate their
trees and furnish food for the crows.
William Jennings Bryan has urged President
Roosevelt not to seek for the renomination to the
Presidency, as one term is enough for any one. This
is another piece of gratuitous advice on a subject
with which Mr. Bryan is as usual unfamiliar.
A literary anecdote is going .the rounds to the et
fect that the German novelist, Spielhagen, once told
a friend he could recollect vividly every one of the
thousands of persons he had met in his life and every
word spoken by casual acquaintances, together with
their gestures and the cut of their hair and clothes.
It would seem that Spielhagen deserves a monument
as the greatest liar of the century.
Here's a Texas story: Governor Hogg started
from his home to go to New York, but missed a
train at Beaumont and had to wait a day. While
\u25a0waiting he became interested in oil stock and gave up
his trip to attend to business. Having now made a
fortune he proposes to finish his trip. It is only in
Texas where you can' miss a train and make a mil
lion before you take the next train.
IT is well when one can be amused by criticism.
We are amused by the indignation of a critic
who writes in the Willows Journal.
We had occasion to call attention to the subjunctive
condemnation of anarchy indulged in by Mr. Bryan.
He sought for its cause in conditions in this Govern
ment and raised his usual voice of warning to. its
usual' height in demanding, that Such â¢ conditions be
changed and reformed as a means of getting rid of
anarchy. This position we deprecated. All who have
studied the principles of the anarchists know that they
find the justification for their crimes in the existence
of government itself. To them the Russian autoc
racj r and the American republic are equally offensive
and deserving of destruction. Indeed, the milder and
better the form of government and the more equal
its pressure upon all its people the more offensive is
it to anarchists, since it may be taken to prove that
government can exist in conformity to all human
rights.
Mr. Bryan, then, is obviously mistaken in assuming
that any existing social conditions, or any that can
exist, under this Government cause anarchy or are
needed to justify it to itself. Speaking not of par
ties in this country but of the whole people, we said
that Mr. Bryan's statement of conditions appeale.d
"only to the idle, thriftless and criminal minority,"
whereupon our Willows critic bursts into an eczema
of indignation and accuses us of being "a firebrand,"
of "hating the Ten Commandments," and going
a-raking "in the lowest hell."
The Willows man should not write when the north
wind blows â it makes him too nervous.. He should
keep his intellect in cold storage and not injure his
digestion by frothing away all of his saliva. That
the wind changed before he finished or a subscriber
paid up with a load of squashes is evident, for he
apologizes for using such incendiary parts of speech,
still insisting that he borrowed them from our
vocabulary! We really beg of him to correct this.
We do not keep "gangrene," "firebrand," "beslimes,"
"the lowest hell," "filthiest demons" and "slimy
vomit" in stock, arid so could not have loaned them
to him for use on that highly interesting occasion
when he sat down to express his opinion. We will
be greatly relieved if any one who has lost that job
lot of hard and off-color words and phrases will as
sert ownership and claim them, that ive may no
longer rest under the suspicion of having enlivened
Willows journalism by renting them out to this un
wise man who talks' vain knowledge and fills him
self with the north wind.
Â£-> ECRETARY GAGE in his address to the
American Bankers' Association at Milwaukee
* < -' reminded the country once more of the need of
reforming our monetary system. The Secretary is
reported to have said: "There is too close an inti
macy between the Government's finances and our
commercial affairs, though it is a comfort to note that
at the present moment the injurious effect of such an
intimacy appears to be at a minimum."
The time when an evil is at its minimum is the best
time in the world to remedy it. At the present time
the people are enjoying an unsurpassed prosperity
and the Government- has in its treasury more money
than it knows what to do. with. A recent report from
Washington says that including the redemption fund
of $150,060,000 there is now in the treasury a stock
of gold in excess of $350,000,000; that the surplus is
increasing at a rate which promises to show for the
year an excess of receipts over expenditures of more
than $70,000,000, notwithstanding the reduction of
the internal revenue taxes, and that upward of $100,
000,000 has been turned into. Government deposi
tories in order that it may be used in the channels of
trade instead of remaining locked up in the treasury.
Such amount of money on hand would enable the
Secretary to effect any well devised remedy for the
evils of our currency system without in any way dis
turbing business even for a moment.
â¢The Secretary in his address recommended that the
demand liabilities. of the Government, known as legal
tender notes, be retired and canceled; that the bank
note circulation be so modified as to make it respon
sive to commercial and industrial needs; that beyond
acting as the guardian for the people in relation to
national banks the Government guaranty to bank
note issues should cease; that public moneys in ex
cess of a reasonable working balance should be de
posited in national banks; that in periods of na
tional peace and prosperity the public revenue should
be in excess of expenditure, the surplus to be ap
plied to the reduction of the national debt.
That the Secretary will have strong support in his
efforts to bring about the desired improvements in
our monetary system is not to be doubted. There is
already a widespread sentiment in favor of the retire
ment of greenbacks. A short time ago 'Mr. Fowler
of New Jersey, who is expected to be chairman of the
Committee on Banking of the House, was reported
to have declaredMn favor of a plan to get rid of from
$50,000,000 to $100,000,000 of greenbacks outright
without replacing them by any otryer class of money/
As an alternative plan he suggested taking from the
available cash in the treasury about $100,000,000,
which he believes could be spared, place that amount
,in the reserve fund of the treasury, and then as a like
amount of United States notes came in cancel them
and issue gold certificates against the additional gold
placed in the reserve. He would continue. the policy
MISPLACED SYMPATHY.
While the financiers of the country are discussing
the best means of making use. of this favorable oppor
tunity to put our currency system on a sound basis
there is another set of statesmen who are meditating
quite other schemes concerning the public money.
They perceive nothing in the situation but a surplus,'
and are preparing to make an efTort to rake it with an
appropriation bill. It is certain that large expendi
tures will be advocated in all sorts of buncombe bills
this winter, for . the surplus is a great temptation.
The intelligence of the country, however, is on the
side of those who believe in acting now for the pur
pose of establishing a safe currency and ridding the
Government of its too close' relations with commerce.
As Secretary Gage said: "Looked at from the stand
point of true statesmanship it would appear that the
present is the most propitious hour in all our history,
and as favorable as any period we may : hope for in
the future, to enter upon reasonable and judicious
measures to eliminate all elements of financial weak
ness which experience has brought to light, and to
perfect our now faulty system of currency."
until there were no longer any- outstanding demand
obligations against the treasury.

After a year spent in touring Europe
the Rev. Father E. Caraher, returned to
this city yesterday to resume his duties
as pastor of St. Francis Church.
Father Caraher visited nearly every city
of any prominence in' Europe during his
absence, and being a close observer he has
a most interesting story to tell of his
travels. Last Easter Sunday morning he
had the honor and proud distinction of
celebrating mass at the Holy Sepulcher.
There were six masses celebrated there
that morning, and four of them were of
fered up by foreign priest3.
Oh Christmas eve Father Caraher was
in Rome and attended the grand and sol
emn service of the closing of the holy door.
During the service Pope Leo was carried
through St. Peter's in state and blessed
the faithful. Stopping at a confessional
that contained the ashes of Saint Peter
and Saint Paul, he knelt down In silent
prayer for several minutes. On reaching
the holy door he took a golden trowel and
with it laid the first brick that closed the
gateway for the next twenty-five years.
Father Caraher met President Kruger
while in Paris and was graciously re
ceived by him and his Cabinet. President
Kruger spoke most gratefully of'the many
kindly acts of the American people and of
the encouragement extended to the Boers
in their struggle for liberty.
A lecture entitled "Easter at the Holy
Sepulcher" will be given in the near fu
ture by Father Caraher. An interesting
feature of the lecture will be a graphic
description of the tomb of our Savior and
of how mass is celebrated there.

them out of existence. He paid a high
tribute to President Kruger. who, he said,
was an upright and just man.

Worthington Ames is the eldest son of

To the Editor of the Call, San Francisco,
Cal.â Dear Sir: At last a large portion of
the awards made at the Pan-American Kx
position have been announced, and there is
the usual amount ot kicking. According to i
my experience there is more than the u;.Ual
amount of kicking. There seems to be a
howl ffoing- up from all departments and
ail portions ot the ground.
California shared lairly well in the fact that
Its State exhibit was given the highest award j
and that it received as many gold medals ;
and silver medals, perhaps, as. any other!
State. Still we feel grieved because some of |
our notoriously good articles have been passed
over with bronze medals or honorable men
tion, while many others among our meritori
ous exhibits seem to have been ignored en
tirely. Some of our wines that .have won gold
medals at other expositions received no more
than bronze or silver medals here, while quite
a number of both wine and brandy entries
have been apparently ignored, as their names
do not appear. among the list of awards in.
their class. Among the omissions is a splen-t
did canned fruit palace provided by the Cali
fornia Canneries Association, which has' re
ceived more compliments, I believe, than any
other one single exhibit on the ground. Among
the points claimed in Its favor were *l2e.
uniqueness, artistic arrangement, beauty, qual
ity and quantity of goods. In these pointB it
has no equal at this exposition, and yet among
the list of awards in the food products it does
not appear. Several of our best olive oils,
C'-'gv.larly entered, do not appear as having
received even honorable mention. One of our
best paintings was similarly treated. A fine
display of California wild flowers, entitled to
distinguished consideration, was ignored en
tirely; a laree and beautiful exhibit of seed
ed raisins received no mention; a display of
elegantly packed and first quality ..California
asparagus was apparently overlooked; and so
on to the number of about forty entries that
might be mentioned, and all of more or less
merit, were either overlooked or Ignored by
the Jurors entirely.
The worst of the situation is that there is
no source of appeal, though there may be
some means of correction. They had a Supe
rior Jury here \vhlch is supposed to havo re
viewed the work of the subordinate juries, but
during their work the exhibitors were kept In i
profound ignorance as to what the subordi- ;
,nate Jurors had done or what the Superior
Jury was doing. Indeed, we had no intima
tion as to what awards were made on any ar
ticles until 'the announcement in the papers
yesterday morning, when results appeared ns
herein stated. I have been following the mat
ter up and have just learned that a commit
tee exists, made up of members of the late
Superior Jury, which has the authority to
correct clerical errors, and If it can be shown
that the omissions referred to were the re
sult of carelessness on the part of subordi
nate jurors or their clerks, or the result of
oversight, it is, barely possible that we may
yecure a review and obtain justice yet on the
articles and exhibits that have, been appar
ently overlooked. A review of the awards
granted to California suggests the idea that
the jurors passed on each article presented
up to the number of 30 or 40. and then, be
coming tired, concluded to give bronze med
als to 30 or 40 more; honorable mention to 40
or 50 others, and ignored- the rest, and this
regardless of quantity, quality or merit. I
do not say they did this, as I have no means
of knowing What they did, but I say the re
sult would seem to indicate such action."
When a first-class wine, a first-class oil, a
beautiful exhibit of photographs, or other ar
ticles of equal merit/" â¢ are ignored entirely;
when a whole house twenty odd feet square
built of a food product and In such an artistic
and unique way as to become the talk of all
visitors, is passed by a jury without being
seen, we must conclude that at least 1 1 ere
was some carelessness, if not actual indiffer
ence, on the part of the gentlemen who made
the awards.
I am going to follow up this matter, and
if the committee on clerical errors can do any
thing to remedy the oversight. I shall insist
that Justice shall yet be done to some of our
best exhibits.
In this connection I would say that the
awards In the line of fruits In Jars and fresh
fruits have not yet been announced; neither
has there been any announcement yet of the
awards in the dairy building. In both of
these departments California figures prom
inently. \
While individual exhibitors in many cases
will be sorely disappointed, as I am, our peo
ple as a whole will find consolation and sat
isfaction in the fact that their State is grant
ed the gold medal for the best State exhibit.
The fact that we secured this award . will
also serve to prove that those who have re
turned and spoken lightly of California's ex
hibit as a whole were either prejudiced or
predisposed to criticism. Very truly yours.

To Keep Their Digestion Perfect
Nothing Is so Safe and Picas-
ant as Stuart** Dyspep-
sia Tab!cts.
Thousands of men and women have
froind Stuart'-3 Dyspepsia Tablets the
eat'est and mopt reliable preparation for
Â£r.y form of indigestion or stomach trou-
bie.
Thousands of people who are not sick.
but are well and wish to keep well, take
Etnart's Tablets after every meal to in-
eure perfect digestion and avoid trouble.
But it is not generally known that the
Tablets are ftlst as pood and wholesome
fcr little folks ;i? for their elders.
LHtle children who are pale, thin and
have no appetite, or do not grow or thrive,
should use the taWets after eating and
will derive sreat benefit from them.
Mrs. G. H. Crotsley. 53$ Washington
street. Hobok n n. New Jersey, writes:
"Stuort's Dyspepsia Tablets just fill the
hill for children as well as for older folks.
I've had the best of lurk \rfth them. My
3-year-o'd pirl takes them as readily as
candy. I have only to say "tablets' and
she "drops everything else and runs for
them."
A Buffalo mother, a short time ago,
â¢who despaired of the life of her babe,
was so ocliphted whh the results from
giving the child these tablets that she
went before the notary public of Erie
County. N. Y., and made the following
affidavit:
Gentlcmpn : â Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
were rer-rmmerded to me for my 2-
months'-<Md ba'jy. which was sick and
puny, and the doctors said was suffering
from in digestion. I took the child to the
hospital, but there found no relief. A
friend mentioned the Stuart Tablets and I
procured a box from my druggist and
used oniy the htrrre sweet lozenges in the
box. and' ira? delighted to find they were
just the thing: fr.r my baby. I feel justi-
fied in saying that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets saved my child's life.

For babies, no matter how young or

George Harper made his first appear
ance In this city as an umpire yesterday
at Recreation "Park. The opposing teams
were Oakland and Sacramento. Two close
decisions which he gave against the
former lost them the game, as Sacramen
to won in the eleventh inning by a score
of 2 to L .
In the first decision he called Babbitt
out in an attempt to steal thiid. The
spectators did not ?ee the man from Oak
land tagged out.
In the .rinth inning Moskiman, the first
man up, lined the ball out to deep right
field for what looked like a three-bagger.
He made second easily and was called
cut for not touching first base. It was
a technical potnl at most, as he did not
cut the bag- and gained nothing by not
touching iu Baobitt struck out and Ham
ilton, a recruit from the amateur ranks,
madj a tase hit, which would have
scored Mofkiman had lie been called safe.
Sacramento scored its first run In the
fifth. Devereaux wag hit by the pitcher,
went to second on a passed ball, reached
third on McNeeley's hit and scored on an
other passed bail. In the ele\"enth Shee
han was safe on first, went to second on
Stanley's sacrifice and to third on Court
ney's hit. HoiTer flew to left field and
Sheehaii scorml on the throw in. The
game was a East one. Each team made
but one error. The score:
One mile, sellingâ D. O'Keefe's Lode Star,

Summaries: Â« - '
STOCKTON, Oct. 17.-A redhot favorite
was beaten In the free-for-all trot to T day.
and the talent received a severe jolting.
The wise ones were so anxious to play
Thomas R that they were willing to pay
almost anything to get a ticket. He
brought $10 to $6 for the field before the
horses were called. The books made him
even money and held out Alta Vela, as
he was believed to be a sure thing for the
opening heat. After he had won two
heats Thomas R tickets , were eagerly
sought at $10 to $5 for the field. Alta Vela
won the race after two killing drives with
the favorite. Lucy G fell in the last heat
and threw J. Albertson, who was not in
jured. Nora McKinney had everything
her own way in the 2:16 trot and was
barred in the betting. Ouiboul was made
a favorite and won out.

John O. Kasson of Iowa, \u25a0who practical

that all the treaties have been renewed

The question of who shall receive and
attend to applications of ministerial re
lief was settled by creating a special com
mittee for that duty. \u25a0 The afternoon ses
sion was devoted chiefly to papers.
The question of whether a minister
should refuse to' officiate at the marriage
of a person who has . been divorced was
brought up and briefly discussed and de
spite an attempt to indefinitely table it, it
was referred to a special committee with
instructions to report before the adjourn
ment of the council.
. A resolution favoring; the appointment
of a committee of seven to consider the
plan of publishing a systematic and grad
ed work for Sunday schools was adopted.

- MII/WATJKEE, WIs., Oct. 17.â The clos
ing: day's session of the American Bank
ers' Association Convention was devoted
to a, continuation of the discussion on
practical banking questions. P. C. Kauff
man of Tacoma, Wash., spoke on. "The
Financial and Commercial Future of the
Pacific Coast." He said: *
It is- admitted by all who give the subject the
slightest- investigation that In the struggle for
commercial supremacy the 'United States, by
reason of her great resources the fertility. of
her* soil' arid' the" vast, extent of her territory, is
destined to take a pre-eminent place.
The twentieth century opens for the, Unite<}
States with its industrial machinery adjusted
to the production of wealth on a scale of un
precedented magnitude. The nations of Europe
and the world at large are constantly becoming
more and more depenedent upon us, not only
for raw material but. also for manufactured
products, and it may be confidently asserted
that because of our central position between
the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, because of
our excellent transportation facilities, our va
ried and inexhaustible resources and the stead
ily increasing dependence of the world upon us
for the necessities and even many of the lux
uries of life,' the United States Is destined to be
the greatest commmercial power of the com
mercial age, the twentieth century. Our great
transcontinental railroads are fully awake to
the situation and are enlarging their facilities
to handle 'the great commerce of the future in
the construction of Immense \u25a0warehouses and
docks and the establishment of great steamship
lines, operated in close connection and under
their direct supervision.
To obtain this pre-eminence the United States
must enter this field of commercial activity
through her Pacific coast. With Hawaii the
key "to the commerce of the Pacific and the
Philippines the gateway to the Orient, both
in our hands, fate or a kind providence has
given us two most important y and valuable
aids for the attainment of this 'glorious goal.
The question of the wisdom of the policy
of expansion has been settled forever. -It is
no longer even a debatable one. Our flag has
been raised in the Philippines and, thank God,
It Is there to stay. It takes' no prophet to
state that if the people of the United States
will but awaken to a full realization of the
grandeur of their destiny and the greatness of
their opportunities they will' settle down to a
development of the commerce of the Orient
that will ere many years re-establish our mer
chant marine, cover the PacIBe with our white
winged birds of commerce, establish on the
Pacific Coast commercial emporiums that will
rival any in the world, and pour into our
treasuries the riches of Golconda.
The list of officers as reported by the
nominations committee was elected as fol
lows: .
President, \u25a0 Myron T. Herrick, Cleveland,
Ohio; vice president. Caldwell Hardy. Norfolk

After almost aTyear's absence in foreign
lands Mrs. Jane L. Stanford has returned
greatly improved in health and filled
with ideas for the expansion and
upbuilding of the Stanford Univer

to fulfill the intention of the late Senator
Stanford to make the great educational
institution complete in every detail that
caused her to return at this time.
Mrs. Stanford on her arrival at Palo
Alto will -make an inspection of - the

her ardent desire to have the university
so thorough in all its equipments that a

--The case of Abe Goldstone,' barber, 105
Fourth street, charged with assault to
murder, was dismissed by Judge Mogan
yesterday. On the night of August 3 a
crowd gathered - in ,front of Goldstone's
shop and began to throw rocks, yelling,
"Down with the Jews!" Goldstone fired
into the crowd and a bullet struck Emll
Beringer, who was passing, on the arm.
The Judge In dismissing . the case said
that 'Beringer was simply, a passerby and
there could have been, no intention to in

The college men cheered Mrs. Stanford
to the echo and joined repeatedly in the
varsity yell given with all the strength
of six hundred voices. The Glee and Man
dolin clubs and the band supplied music.'
One noticeable feature of the march to
Mrs. Stanford's residence was the, show
of reverence to the memory of the foun
der of the university, every man silently
baring his head as he passed the Stanford
tomb. From Mrs. Stanford's home the
students marched ; to j the baseball dia
mond and passed the .remainder of the
evening, in circling a monster bonfire with
the serpentine dance, giving the college
yells and hauling the freshmen football
players around in the old cart so often
used for that surooso.

All the theaters in town contributed of
the best on their bills. The Musicians"
Union supplied . the music free of charge
and the volunteer services of an able
army of stage mechanics did much to
make the benefit a success in keeping
with that of its predecessors.

calmly, hopefully. Who shall say that a braver
man ever lived than William McKinley as he
looked into the face of death? If there was
much of helpfulness in his life, certain it is
that in his death there was much- to lift up
the nation to higher things.

as to any consistent speculative sentiment.
Confusion and hesitation were the only feelings
revealed. Although prices covered a consid
erable range' and in ~6ome cases several times
the net changes of any consequence will be
found very few.. The same brokers, acting to
all appearances, for the same interests were
on different sides of the market at different
times of the day. This was especially true of
the operation* â¢ in the Southwestern railroad
rroup, in which heavy Belling, seemingly for
inside Interests, was followed by even heavier
buying from the same sources. The midday
weakness in this group interrupted ' a harden
ing tendency in the market, as it "did yes
terday. The feature of the morning dealings
was The marking up of a number of high
pi iced investment railroad stocks. This move
mrnt was prompted by the sales yesterday of
Lake Shore at 309, which were confined to two
transactions, and the alleged raising of the
bid for Chicago, Burlington and Quincy to 211.
which proved on investigation to be wholly
fictitious:.' On this rather slender ttasis there
were hung -various sapient dissertations upon
the 6ignificar.ee of the pressure of capital thus
revealed Into the high-class railroad stocks
and the example was taken up this morning,
possibly by Investors and possibly by the In
genious professional operators who have been
seeking to awaken speculative interest In
stocks. The movement had lost much of its
force by midday. Much more Impressive was
the sudden activity In Northern Pacific pre

W.. WASHINGTON, Octl 17.â President
Roosevelt shocked his recently acquired
Southern friends and admirers by enter
taining at dinner last evening Booker T.
Washington, the colored head of Tusko
gee Institute. Southern men generally
feel that the President should not, In the
face of his declarations of friendliness to
ward their section, have thus early shown
such marked courtesy to u colored man.
Th^re is but one similar Instance within
recollection when persons of colored blood
dined at the White House. That was when
Queen LJliuokalani visited this country to
resist the proposed annexation of the Ha
waiian \u25a0 Islands and was entertained at
dinner by President Cleveland.. I\>rmer
Presidents refrained from giving dinner
invitations to such negro leaders as Fred
erick Douglas B. K. Bruce, D. B. Elliott,
H. . B. / Spinchback and Bishop, Turner.
These "and other prominent members of
the colored race occupying official : posl-.
tions were invited to public receptions at
the White House and always went with
out exciting comment. â¢
What effect the dining of Booker Wash
ington by President Roosevelt will have
upon his Southern policy is uncertain, but
it Is predicted that it will drive from him
some of his new allies. When the South
ern delegation called upon him a few days
ago in connection with a Federal'appoint
ment he took occasion to remark that
"the color bf a man's skin should not op
erate to his advantage or disadvantage in
an appointment or; a removal from of
fice."". President Roosevelt apparently In
tends to apply the same rule at his din
ner table. - . . â¢
Dispatches received here from the South
to-night show that there is great excite
ment among the President's new political
friends over the fact that he had a black
man to dinner. Southern members of Con
gress who are here criticize the President,
but no one will permit the use of -his name
In connection with these criticisms, i One
of them, a Representative from? Louisiana,
said that this dinner incident would undo
all the good the President" \u25a0 had accom
plished In appointing v former Governor
Jones United. States Judge for Alabama.

therefore resolutely refused to pay any

ernment to arrest the chief Instigators of
the abduction. Several Influential mem
bers of the Macedonian committee" have
already been arrested.

news has bee.n received here from Messrs.

the first to appreciate and perpetuate the
new photographic idea. Since then It has

whose eyes the new fancy has found favor
see no reason why the young mother and
child of the present day should not pose
for the new art of the camera as they did
for the old art of the brush and colors
of the days of long ago. And s>o it has
come that no collection of treasured pho

addition cf the "madonna pose" of some'

Judge Hunt's Suspicions Aroused.
The suit for divorce instituted by' Mary
Jane Brrd against Joseph Byron Bird was
ordered off the calendar by Judge Hunt
yesterday for the 'reason that a letter
purporting to come from Bird, who is sup
posed to be in Tacoma, was not accomnn
nied by an affidavit showing that it had
been written by him. Judge Hunt stated
that he. feared there was collusion anH
that he would not hear the case 'until
evidence was submitted to prove that
Bird had been properly summoned and
was desirous of allowing his wife to ae

Mrs. Mary Jones Disputes Mrs. Lucy
Carter's Claim of Right to Run
the Palmerlee.
A temporary order restraining Mrs. Lucy
C. Carter from disposing of the Palmer
lee ledging-house at 133 Ellis street was
Issued by Judge Sloss yesterday. The or
der also restrains Mrs. Carter from, dis
bursing the receipts of the hotel until the
ownership thereof Is decided.
Mrs. Carter and F. King, upon a re
quest made by Mary O. Jones, who claims
to be the owner of the hotel, have been
cited to show cause on October 22 why a
receiver should not be appointed.
Mrs. Jones owes Mrs. Carter $2500 o/i a
chattel mortgage, tut claims that Mrs.
Carter, by threatening her with a pistol,
compelled her to execute a bill of gale
for the Palmerlee, promising when she
secured It not to record it, but simply to
hold the document as security for the
loan. - . -
Mrs. Jones now alleges that the promise
has not been kept and she further alleges
that Mrs. Carter executed a fraudulent
chattel mortgage on the property to King
with the intention to defraud her.
She alleges still further that she Is
ready to pay the $2500 and asks that a re
ceiver be appointed pending the suits to
determine ownership.

,The Southern Pacific Company filed
a petition yesterday for a rehearing
in the Le Blanc case, In which the Kail
road Commissioners decided that a re
duction should be made in the rate for
the transportation of oil from Bakersfield
to ihis city from 42 cents to 37.8 cents per
barrel. In the petition filed the railroad
company alleges that the evidence in the
Le Blanc case was insufficient to warrant
the finding that the cost to the railroad
company of transporting crude petroleum
from Bakersfleld to this city is 33 6 cents
per barrel, and that such cost is less on
its respective lines from points north of
Bakersfleld to San Francisco; secondly
that the evidence is insufficient to iustifv
the finding that the net profit on the
transportation of crude petroleum from
Bakersfield to this city af 42. cents ner
barrel Is 8.4 cents per barrel; third that
the evidence Is insufficient to warrant thp
finding that a rate of 37.8 cents per barrel
for transportation from Bakersfleld to this
city would be a reasonable, fair and just

then adjourned sine die.
The Morehouse wing of the Non-Parti
san Municipal League convention met at
B'nai B'rith Hall last night and com
pleted its work of indorsing a municipal
ticket. Inasmuch as it was announced
that there would be no meeting because
of a. factional split which prompted Na
than Bibo and Emanuel A. Lorenzo to call
a meeting at 1605 Polk 1 street for to-night,
some exciting developments were looked
for. With the exception of some severe
criticism of the course of the two gentle
men nampd and the Â«.xpulsion-of I*orenzo
for conduct unbecoming a gentleman and
a member of the convention the proceed
ings â¢were quite tame.
Chairman H. V. Morehouse said the con
vention would continue to do business at
the old stand notwithstanding the efforts
of Bibo and Lorenzo to the contrary. A.
B. .Treadwell followed, with a strong de
nunciation of Lorenzo's private and pub
lic character, the result being a motion
for his expulsion, which prevailed.- * â¢

"The manner in which candidates for
election to Government offices are spoken
of tends to weaken the Government. Nu
merous utterances of personal abuse have
been made that are far beyond all de
cency. Whoever recklessly, unjustly and
falsely accuses an honest man in public
office-is, in kind at least, as. much of a
wretch as the man. who took the life of
the President. I have jio pessimistic
views as to the future of our country."
"But I think that the sentiments of the
American \u25a0 people are all on the side of
preserving the Government and its au
thority. The task will be to keep alive
that love of government always. One of
the great difficulties is the disrespect that
is altogether too prevalent, and this dis
respect is not always confined to news
paper men who pander to that low taste
that wishes to hear evil of others. This
is followed by amateurs in other walks
of life. There is a serious lack of respect
for the Government.
At 8:30 o'clock Judge Shaw rapped for
order and introduced Supreme Court Jus
tice T.B.' McFarland, who, he said, would
address the meeting upon a subject of his
own choosing. Justice ; McFarland . was
greeted with loud applause, and said in
part:
"While I was not given any subject
upon which to speak, it has occurred to
me that recent events present a great
danger which our profession may do niuch:
toward avertingâ a danger which appears
to be. threatening- our Government, which
recognizes the political equality of the
people. The danger is in the exaggera
tion of freedom and equality.

rupting the court?" asked McLaughHn.
"I did not consider that any money de
rived from our firm would go to the cor
ruption of Judge Noyes. I gathered from
McKenzie that he had absolute control of
Noyes," was the reply.
"Did you believe Judge Noyes could be
corrupted by anybody?"
"I can say yes with an explanation.
b rom what McKenzie told me about the
payment of all Judge Noyes' expenses and
the expenditure of 160,000 on him and cer
tain protestations made by McKenzie
about a trifling with Justice by Judge
Noyes I did believe Judge Noyes could be
corrupted. :, It tvas not a favor, but sub
stantial .results in - litigation."
Continuing Hun/e said: "I will not say
that -I- paid' McKenzie any money or con
sideration for the corruption of Judge
Noyes. I was told that in two cases un
less we ; turned over our contingent inter
ests to the Alaska, Gold , Mining Company
we would not get the receivership. My
opinion ' of Noyes was formed on what
McKenzie â¢ stated, corroborated bv the
court's rulings." â¢
Then followed an examination into the
various rulings of the court which led
Hume tO'-his opinion about Judge Noves'
corruptibility, particularly the appoint
ment of receivers.. T
An adjournment ' until to-day at 10
o'clock was then taken.
court to be as lenient with him as possi
ble. The withholding of the keys to the
deposit vault was one of the most flag
rant violations of the Circuit Court's
writ.
Hume Takes the Stand.
Hume's story took almost two sessions
in the telling. By direct and cross ex
amination all the relations between Hume
and Noyes were exposed. Hume's ver
sion incriminates Noyes and McKenzie,
inculpating both to a like degree, but
making the latter the agent and inter
mediary in all the dealings that reflect
upon the court and the court's appointee.
The witness was a partner of . the law
firm of Hubbard, Beeman & Hume, and
came in direct contact with Judge Noyes
and McKenzie in their attempts to regu
late the justice of the country to suit
themselves.
Hume represented some claimants of
Anvil Creek property. . A l few days after
McKenzie's arrivalln Nome he paid- Hume
a visit, l The witness had contingent in
terests In some of these mining claims and
McKenzie knew;- it. Hume said in" course
of his testimony:- "\u25a0 . \ .-â¢' . .
â¢-"McKenzie 'represented" to â¢ myself that
he controlled the' Judge" and' District At
torney and it would be best to have'our
interests .transferred i to^ him, . as .it was
necessary for him to control that litiga
tion. : Otherwise we would not get a hear
ing." \u25a0 \u25a0 .- -; -\u25a0 .\u25a0â¢ '.
-The demand- made I by : McKenzie \u25a0 was
that Hubbard, Beeman and Hume should
turn over -a. one-fourth interest \u25a0" in the
claims. With McKenzie was- associated
United States District Attorney Wood. ..
,- Then' McKenzie insisted -that' Hume be
made "Deputy District Attorney and the
latter admitted that he accepted the po
sition after a discussion with his partners
as it .was ' the only way to save his clients'
interest. â¢ " , â¢
Continuing history Hume testified:
"McKenzie said he ' spent $60,000 in get
ting these appointmentsâ those of Noyes
and Wood. 'He came from New York to
organize a mining company and said that
unless we agreed, to his propositions we
would lose business and incur the en
mity of the court and himself." ,
McKenzie Steers Ship.
According to the terms' agreed upon Mc-
Kenzie was to become a silent and Wood
an active member of. the court. McKen
zie was to receive a one-fourth interest
in the firm's profits, which was to be de
voted to the "advantage of Judge Noyes."
- "Personally- 1 don't want- anything,"
Hume declared McKenssie ; to have said.
"This Judge,", said Hume, repeating Mc-
Kensiie's statement, "is weak and vacil
lating. ,1 have to hold him up. You must
give up half your business. Beeman and
myself. refused. , 'This must be done,', said
McKenzie. We thought it over until next
day and finally acquiesced, as we feared
McKenzie would crush us."
" So a partnership agreement was drawn
up and the firm . became Hume, Wood,
Hubbard, Beoman & McKenzie. The pa
pers were laid in a safe, but they disap
peared arid Hume said he never saw them
afte.r. Hubbard had access to the safe
besides* thfi' witness..'
"Then they began at once to prepare
papers which would give McKenzie the
receivership of - the claims on ' Anvil
Creek,". 'continued ' Hume. "McKenzie
wanted .to get them out hurriedly. Judge
Noyes was waiting to sign the orders, the
wagons with the 'Jumpers' aboard were
ready to do their work and In a trice the
Job was done." \u25a0 â¢
Something was wrong ! in the papers,
and Archie Wheeler, Judge Noyes' secre
tary, came to Hume with a draft copy
correcting the errors of the flrst. These
were the second orders of receivership. .
When the writs arrived there were
many consultations, particularly one in
McKenzio's. office, and the other in
Hume's. McKenzie suggested that Judge
Noyes should issue an â¢ order restraining
McKenzie from turning the gold dust over
to any one. Then came a discussion how
to avoid the disobedience of the writ.'
It seems that Noyes went back on Mc-
Kenzie for a time, and after his arrest
the Judge would 1 not issue a writ of ha
beas corpus. "Wood wanted Hume to -see
McKenzie then, and at this time Wood
said: "I have the keys in my pocket and
they will not get the gold dust."
\u25a0Senator 'Carter of Montana, was men
tioned for a moment, but only as a possi
ble influence in the Noyes camp.- When
the name of Gaylen came up Carter was
attached to it. Senator Carter is related
to Gaylen, and the latter was sent out to
engage an attorney for the defendants."
The cross examination brought out the
fact that Hume had met McKenzie in
Washington In May, 1900. The latter then
told the former that he had organized a
mining company for Nome, that Hubbard
Geary's answer is a denial of giving ad
vice to McKenzie to disouey the writ.
Geary admits, however, the writing of
an opinion in which he says Judge Mor
row did not command Noyes to-dellver
possession of any property to anybody or
that the possession of property should be
interfered with.
United States District Attorney Joseph
K. Wood's answer is quite a surprise.
Wood admits in it that at the time the
Circuit Court of Appeals sent Deputy
United States Marshals Moncton and
Burnham to Nome he â¢ had possession of
the keys to the safe deposit vault . of a
local bank where the' gold dust from the
Anvil Creek mines, which are in litiga
tion, was stored. He -further admits that
when the deputies arrived there with or
ders from the Circuit Court to' deliver the
dust to .the .Wild Goose and Pioneer Min
ing Company, from whose claim it had
been taken,. he still. had the keys and re
fused to give them up. Wood ends his
answer with a plea for mercy, asking the
Answers were filed. In the . contempt
cases yesterday morning at. the session of
the Circuit Court of Appeals. T, J.- Geary
came armed with a demurrer, which was
promptly overruled. . All answers try to
explain away the charges 'except that of
District Attorney Joseph- K. Wood for the
Nome district. He confesses, to the accu
sations made against him and throws him
self on the mercy of the court.
Judge Noyes' answer admits *a.' refusiil
on his. part to allow, an appeal from un
order appointing a 'receiver, but' avers
that in all hte acts in the premises he
acted judicially in the exercise' of Justice
and discretion. He also 'declares that At
torney Metson by an interruption of the
proceedings of the court at a busy timo
upset his decision. Judge Noyes believes
the writ of supersedeas precluded him
from making orders concerning the re
ceivership. He denies that he authorized
the United States Marshal to take posses
sion of the gold dust, und states that he
believes that it was his duty to restrain
the defendant, from removing the gold
dust from the jurisdiction of the court.
The" contempt cases,- four of them, are
the outgrowtnof a peculiar state or Judi
cial affairs that existed in the Nome coun
try, during Judge Noyes' regime. The
story- "of claim-jumping, the appointment
of receivers and McKenzie's connection
with the case has already, been told. The
worst was anticipated and that worst is
now receiving an airing in the Commis
sioner's: examination. Attorney PiUsDury
is sparing no one and by sweeping cuts is
going right to the bone of the case. â¢ =
The opening-was a Noyes day, not that
the testimony redounded to his honesty
or credit, but that it had him as the sub
ject matter of examination. Through these
contempt proceedings the Innermost facts
of the operations of the .so-called Federal
Nome .ring* will, be brought to light.
Hume's testimony as it stands Is. a reve
lation of corruption, chicanery and dis
honesty and discloses a state of affairs
that will end In disbarments and disgrace
for many. . ..â¢â¢,.....

E. S. Pillsbury, acting as amicus

Hume, a member of the Nome bar, that
far exceeded the expectations of sensa
tional developments in the case. Hume
was on the stand all day and will go on
again to-day, when P. J. McLaughHn,
Judge Noyes' attorney, will- finish his
cross-examination. . ; -;\u25a0 :^ : . '
Commissioner Heacock's room had nn
air of the Arctic about it yesterday. Out
side of a few attorneys from this city,
the men came from the far north, where
Justice seems to have been going a jerky
pace. First of all there was Judge Arthur
H. Noyes, who appears to show cause
why he should" not be punished for con
tempt of tlie United States Circuit Court
in not obeying 'it's writ, of supersedeas a
year ago last September. He'is represent

THE taking of testimony in the
Nome contempt cases has begun.
Before Commissioner Heacock
yesterday morning and afternoon
As soon as Black commenced .to strug
gle one' of the men seized him by the
throat with one hand and struck him sev
eral severe blows on the head. The other
of the pair of thieves searched the strug
gling man's pockets and took .a watch
and chain valued at $300. The jeweler
raised an outcry before his money was
reached and the thieves ran down Com
mercial street and disappeared.
John Black, a jeweler of Tucson, Ari
zona, was held up and robbed of a valu
able go'.d watch on Kearny street, near
Commercial, early yesterday morning.
The robbery was committed by . two
thieves, one of whom held the Arizona
man \u25a0 while the other went through his
pockets. A report of the matter was
made to the Central police station.
Black has been in San Francisco sev
eral days en route to Honolulu. Wednes
day night he was returning to: his hotel
and by mistake wandered down. Kearny

No sooner had the boat commenced to
pass through the bridge than it struck
bottom. Its impetus, although it was not
traveling at a high rate of speed, aided
by the soft, yielding slime, carried the
boat half way throug-h before it ftuck
fast. Despite all effort to dislodge it.
there the huge/, unwieldy vessel remained
tenaciously all afternoon and far into the
night. Every moment the lowering tide
caufed It to sink deeper- and deeper Into
the mud and rendered the efforts of the
crew more and more unavailing.
AH this time the street cars were being
stacked up on the track on either side of
the bridge. Hundreds of wagons were
forced to return and go to the Potrero
by way of Sixth street. The people who
reside in the Potrero were forced to take
a circuitous route in order to reach their
home.
The steamer Zinfandel lodged in the
mud and slime of Channel Creek directly
under the draw of the Fourth-street
bridge and caused an embarrassing ob
struction of traffic yesterday afternoon
and last night on lower Fourth street.. At
the time the boat became stalled it was
carrying a small load of shakes to a lum
ber yard west of the bridge. At all times,
even at flood tide, Channel Creek is but a
ehailow affair. At the time the captain
of the Zinfandel attempted passage the
tide was rapidly running out.

The candidates for Mayor are awaiting
with some Impatience the action of the
liquor associations In the Indorsement of
nominees. The venders of beer and other
liquids are by no means unanimous #i
the subject before them. The problem is
eo perplexing that the leaders In the scv
era) associations are advising that no in
dorsements for Mayor be made. For a
time Eugene K. Schmltz. the Union Labor
nominee, seemed to be the prime favorite
of the liquor dealers, but the advisability
of lending the stamp of approval to a
class candidate, whose prospects of suc
cess are not growing brighter, is begin
ning to be questioned by the conservative
men in the liquor trade.
The California Demokrat. 1 the German
newspaper, further complicates the situa
tion by republiahing from the flies of the
Alia California articles showing that Asa
R. Wells, as a member of the Society for
the Suppression of Vice, advocated the in
crease of the retail liquor license tax from
$84 to $1000 per annum. The Demokrat
publishes Mr. Wells* record in this recard
in English and German.
The contest between John Farnham

Farnham, in the event of his election will

McGowan. When Thomas , D. Riordan
chairman of the late Republican conven
tion, heard of- this arrangement he was
so embittered that he used campaign lan
guage of the hottest kind. It is now whis
pered that the chairman of the late con
vention Is picking out conspicuous places
for the display of Boland banners. It is
said in justification of his wrath that Ri
ordan had a candidate of his own selec
tion for the position of attorney for the

The politicians are making: guesses
about the unexpended $10,000 of the sum
of $30,000 collected from the corporations
to swing the primary election In favor of
the boss ticket. Abe Ruef believes that
every dollar was expended and that the
corporations may be called on to pro
vide for the deficiency. The notion that
Crimmlns could hold out anything to
which Martin Kelly was entitled to equal
division is not respected by campaigners
\u25a0who are familiar -with Kelly's rough-and
ready tactics in dealing- with Crimmins.
The fact that Crimmlns Is on the earth
is cited as proof that Kelly got at least
half the amount contained in the envel
ope. There were broad hints yesterday
ttat a further disbursement of $7500 had
just been ordered.

Therefore, the Building Trades Council desires
it to be distinctly understood that It Is not a
party to, has no candidates in, or affiliation
with, the -above mentioned Union Labor party,
and desires to Impress upon every trades union
man connected with the building industry that
this municipality. is best governed when public
servants are selected from the entire commu
nity, without regard to any particular class.
O. A. TVEITMOB,
Secretary Building Trades Council.
The above being true, does it not follow that
unionism, as it has been established, furthered
and conducted by the Building Trades Council,
having been instrumental in bringing about
these conditions, and these conditioons having
proven to be the best government ever experi
enced by the citizens of this city and county,
a continuance - of the same methods through
the same channels will ultimately bring about
the greatest success looked forward to by union
ism as enunciated In this, the Building Trades
Council?
Should Stay in Old Channel.
As the council has done In the past so it will
continue to do in the future, only with in
creased energy, to the end that what it has so
well begun may be carried along to a success
ful conclusion and that the masses may receive
the many benefits accruing from the above men
tioned laws giving to the citizens the control of
public utilities, some of which will, if proper
care be taken, come to the people within the
next two years.
The Building: Trades Council feels to-day as
it did then. It is opposed to unions, as unions,
entering the political field, and feels that any
political movement of an exclusive character
limited and restricted to any order, fraternity
or organization, or any other element or class
of society cannot be productive of the results
required by a well governed community.
It is only within the recent past that the
Building Trades Council, through the agency of
the members comprising the affiliated unions,
and by co-operating with the other citizens of
this community, has brought about laws such
as the eight-hour day, the minimum rate of
wages, the initiative and referendum and many
other important reforms benefiting alike the
citizens of tbis community, be they laboring,
mercantile, financial or professional.
Opposes Unions in Politics.
At Us regular meeting- held on June 13, 1901.
the Building Trades Council, having under
consideration the organization of a Union Labor
party, "after careful and serious consideration,
adopted a resolution presented by Delegate J.
B. Williams of Carpenters' Union No. 22 as the
sentiment of the Building Trades Council. The
said resolution deprecated the organization of
such a party as inimical to labor's interest and
one which, if pursued, would cause dissension
in labor's ranks and ultimately prove extremely
damaging to the cause of unionism because of
Its being diametrically opposed to strict trade
union principles.
The Building- Trades Council of San
Francisco officially issues the following'
clear and pointed declaration that it has
no affiliation or connection with the Un
ion Labor party:
The Building Trades Council desires it to be distinctly understood
that it is not a party to, has no candidates on the ticket or affiliation
with the Union Labor party, and desires to impress upon every trades
union man connected with the building industry that this municipality
is best governed when public servants are selected from the entire com
munity, without regard to any particular class.
