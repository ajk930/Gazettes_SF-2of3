TEDERAL GOVERNMENT
SUES SENATOR CLARX
HELENA. Mont., June ' 24.â United
States Attorney Rogers to-day began ac
tion in the Federal Court* against Senator
W. A. Clark, in which the Government
seeks to have set aside patents for about
10,000 acres of valuable land now under
control of the Senator. The Government
claims that the lands were taken up with
in the last three years under the timber
and Etone act by persons who, contrary
to law, filed on them for speculative pur
peses and knowing that. they expected to
dispose of them to Senator Clark or his
&Â£rente. The lands involved are all in Mls
eoula County.
The Secretary told Paymaster Martin
that he was guilty of a serious offense
committed In violation of law and regula
tion. "The acts charged," said the Sec
retary, "were, in fact, an appropriation
to your own use of public money held
by you In trust. It was not even a case
cf money due you, but not yet payable.
Had you died or otherwise left the service
there would have been a shortage. That
you had resources or funds elsewtiere at
your command to make it good Is of no
consequence." 'Â¦_ -Â¦

The Hanna men have never before been

that Senator Hanna would not get the

he secured both of the State committee

in the convention proper, but was in the
election of a State Central Committee,
when the delegates representing each of
the twenty-one Congressional districts
met separately and a committeeman ,was
named for each district. The result was
a decided victory for the so-called Hanna

BLUEFIELD, W. Va., June 24.â Details
of the fearful flood in the Pocahontas Ilat
top I region are slowly drifting Into this
town, which is situated twenty-five miles
south'of the scene of wrecked homes, and
fully bear out the fears early entertained
as to the havoc wrought by the storm.
Fifty dead bodies have been found. Thou
sands of people are homeless and it is
feared that many are without food, or at
the best with only food enough to last a
few days. The work of establishing rail
road communication is being pushed with
vigor. There is little hope of sending tha
sufferers succor until railroad connection
is restored. Men are at work clearing
away. the debris and recovering the bodies
of {he dead. The dead are being aug
mented hourly. Relief trains are running
between this city and the edge Â¦ of tha
stricken district and everything possible
is being done to relieve the suffering, and
destitution. The latest estimate is that It
will take ten days to repair the track. In
formation from the Tug River district is
to the effect that the damage to the coal
operations there is not great, but that the
lumber Interests have suffered consider
ably. . >'
Like the Johnstown Flood.
; Over a hundred miles of track belonging
to' the various coal operators are practi
cally .lost. The rails are bent and twisted
like wires. Even the heavy girders of the
collapsed railroad bridges were rendered
useless. The. force of the flood Is better
understood when it is explained that by
reason of a long fall and a low Iron bridge
i some distance up the valley the flood was
dammed and a monster body of water ac
cumulated, probably as large a volume as
was contained in the famous dam at
Johnstown. -When this obstruction gave
way it let down a great flood on the vil
lages and mining camps below.
It is reported that Dr. Hatfleld, a promi
nent physician and a kinsman of the fam
ous feudlsts of this section of Kentucky,
was 'compelled to shoot two negro plun
derers who were robbing defenseless flood
sufferers. The negroes were George Wade
and Alexander Watts, . both desperate
characters.
The % slowness of recovery of bodies is
because the corpses of the missing are
hidden In mammoth piles of debris. Some
of these piles are thirty feet high and
cover in some instances as much as a half
acre of ground, and it Istne work of days
to search through them.' It has beeÂ« sug-

MENRY C. â¢ CORBIN, : adjutant
general of the United States
army, arrived here yesterday
from Washington en route to'
Manila. on a tour of Inspection.
He expects to be gone three months and
sails on the transport Hancock to-day.'
In an interview last evening at the Pal
ace General Corbln said that- General
Chaffee would take command of the army
In the Philippines on July 4, and that
General MacArthur, whom he will relieve,
would then return to this country.
Upon General Corbin's arrival In Ma
nila he will confer with General Chaffee
and Judge .Taftl chief of ,the Philippine
Commission, and decide how many sol
diers will be needed in the Philippines.
"The policy of the Government is to cut
down expenses as much as possible," said
the general. "The campaign is now over
and only sufficient men will remain to
preserve order and police outside, dis
tricts. I cannot tell what regiments will
bo kept, buf those that are will be re
lieved as soon as possible.""
Regarding the alleged frauds that were
reported recently from Manila. General
Corbin did not show any great concern.
"The frauds that are supposed to have
occurred in* Manila are not known of offi
cially in Washington," he said, "and no
reports have been made of them. I think
that It was a" great stir over nothing. I
look upon them the same as I do upon
those alleged to have been perpetrated in
San Francisco. General Shatter wrote me
that there was absolutely nothing in
them, and his statement proved to be
correct."
United States Senator-elect C. H. Deit
rich. of Nebraska arrived at the Palace
yesterday and will also sail on the Han
cock as the special guest of General Cor-
far the highest and it is reported tha't for
a distance of over ten miles that road is
practically a wreck and several days will
be required ; to repair the great damage
which has been done. Along the coal re
gipns of the Elkhorn and the numerous
big plants lower down, box cars were
swept away in the - rushing flood and
lodged against the, rugged mountain sides
and in a few instances were carried down
the Tug River even as far as below the
falls. Many of the cars were loaded. All
the numerous lumber plants are great
losers, to an extent conservatively esti
mated at a million and a half.
All reports agree that betwen 200 and 300
houses were swept away in the Elkhorn
Valley, but, of course, not all the occu
pants were drowned.
At lager Station the river toss to thirty
one feet inside of three hours, deluging
every house in the little town and wash-
Ing away many of the outbuildings.
Higher up the river the destruction Is
said to be even greater. â¢ Not over 100
yards of the road between Vivian and
Ennis. a- distance of ten miles, appears to
be left Intact. All towns above there oc
cupying lowland were, submerged and
many houses were washed away. It is
ln,rossible to approximately estimate the
less of life. Early reports sent out indi
cated that it had been very great, but
each subsequent report has lowered the
number. It is safe to say that less than
ldO' have perished, and it need be no sur
prise to learn that no more than one-halt
or possibly one-fourth that number have
been lost. Early reports sent out have
proved to be grossly exaggerated, based
upon Imagination, as there was no means
of getting anything like reliable informa
tion. . -.
The Twelve Pole River is rising. and no
trains of any kind have been able to go
farther east than Dingess, and no wire
is in 'working order beyond that place, so
that all news by wire has had to come
through the Blucfleld and Roanoke offices.
Much- livestock .has been drowned.
Among the drift and debris which fills
the river are : numbers of horses, cattlo
and hogs. Several , horses with saddles
and bridles were seen to float by, thus
rendering it a certainty that the riders
had either been drowned or had been com
pelled to desert "them ' and flee to the
mountain side for safety.
It is reported that a number of box cars
had floated out at the mouth of the Big
Sandy which had come,, from the line of

the statement issued by Secretary Gage,
in explanation of the United States Treas
ury Department's action in imposing coun
tervailing duties on certain Russian prod
ucts, shows the question is not fully un
derstood by. Gage. M. de Witte says he
cannot imagine that Secretary Gage
would intentionally mislead the people of
tha United States, and therefore can only
conclude that Gage is not possessed of all
the facts in the case.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 24.â On com
,petent authority It Is reported that the
Russian Minister of Finance regards Sec
retary Gage's explanation of the petro
leum question to be beside the point.
Russia has adopted reprisals in the form
of Increased duties on American goods
lor the second time, not because a certain
shipment of petroleum was taxed at an
unduly high rate because it was not ac
companied with a certificate as to its ori
gin, | but because Russia does not admit
the correctness of Secretary Gage's inter
pretation of the tariff Iaw3 of the United
States. , Section 626 of these laws places
naphtha and the products of naphtha on
the â¢ free Â¦ list unless the country whence
they are exported charges duty on similar
articles from the United States. Russia
does not think that these laws authorize
the collection of a tax on paraffin made
from the product of Russian naphtha, as
decreed by Secretary Gage In his circular
of March last.
Explanation Will Be in Vain.
According to the Russian press thia cir
cular Is generally regarded as the answer
of the United States In the matter or the
Russian reprisals, and this opinion has
never been corrected. The impression has
been conveyed that the hope of Secretary
Gage that Secretary of State Hay will
succeed In explaining these matters to the
satisfaction of M. de Wltte will be In vain.
If further action against Russian trade is
taken by the United States, Russia's an
swer will follow in due season. Speaking
of these matters an official said:
"The entire trade of tha TJnlted States
with Russia can be lost while awaiti.i?
the decision of the court, unless the.
matter Is hastened. I understand the case
comes before the lower court next No
vember. -The Americans are apparently
not In a hurry to resume business, which
Is now falling into the hands of the Ger
mans."
When asked If there was any danger of
Russia Imposing further reprisals on
American goods as a hint to the Govern
ment of the United States to hasten the
settlement of the matter, .he said:
Danger to Commerce.
"Up to the present time your agricul
tural machinery has not been affected."
The informant of the cornespondent ex
pressed his opinion that action in the mat
ter was needed and that a revival of the
subject would cost American commerce
far more than the discriminating duties
â¢which are scarcely noticeable in the sell
ing price of light hardware, fine grade
machinery and tools. The majority of the
consumers of such articles have but re
cently heard of these discriminating: du
ties. i~-
Americans In St. Petersburg are of the
opinion that the affair will never be ter
minated to the satisfaction of American
exporters through Russian Initiative or
concessions. - ,

AGAINST THE ASSESSORS
Southern Pacific Company Questions
the Legality of a New Law
in Nevada.
CARSON, Nev., June 24.â William F.
Herrin of the Southern Pacific law de
partment filed a suit In the United States
Court In this city to-day, asking for an
Injunction against the County Assessors
of the State to prevent their levying and
collecting taxes against the corporation.
His ground is that they have no author
ity under the new revenue law and that
they, or a majority of them, entered into
a conspiracy to levy unjust and burden
some taxes against the company In order
that other classes of people should escape
their just burden of taxation.. Mr. Herrin
claims that railroads cannot be properly
classified under the new law; that the As
sessor of one county has no right to
say what taxes shall be levied upon prop
erty in another county, and that the coun
ties through which no road runs had no
right to vote upon the valuation of prop
erties in other counties.
The' Assessors . are cited to appear in
o*irt and will be called upon to answer
on July 15. The complaint alleges that
the valuation on , the property per mile
should be from $8000 to $12,000 on main
track and $3500 on side tracks.

Miss Florence Roberts repeated
"Sapho," her great success of last year,
last evening at the Alcazar Theater. Time
has not withered nor custom staled Miss
Roberts' excellent interpretation of the
star part. The Alcazar management has
staged the play with the same careful
attention to detail as they bestowed upon
it during its first production, and haye
also given the actress a splendid support.
Whittlesey is still the Jean of the cast,
and is an excellent foil for Miss Roberts'
subtle art. "Sapho" runs for this week

At the last Congress an appropriation

Some surprise Is expressed here that
th3 disease which appeared on the Car

have been plague. There was no physi

dead were thrown overboai 1â the last

By Blanche Partington.
PURE melodrama, hot and strong,
is Paul M. Potter's new play,
founded on Oulda's novel "Under
Two Flags" and given last night
at the Columbia Theater. The
chief element in the mixture of emotions
aroused by the play with me was. I blush
to say, a lively envy of the fortunate New
Yorker to whom such productions â the
Â¦word is used with due respectâ are an
every night happening. It betrays the
provincial to speak of the portrait's
frame, the gem's setting, but Miss
Blanche Bates shone none the less bright
ly last night In that the life drama of the
French vivandiere she plays so well was
mounted with a plcturesqueness and com
pleteness that have not been seen on the
local stage for many weary days. Mr.
Frohman has sent us this time the "whole
show," people and settings, and if a po
lite groveling at the Frohman knees will
persuade to further grace â why, then, one
feels inclined to grovel. The applause
that greeted each clever stage picture,
each clever bit of lighting, â¢was pathetic
enough to have touched even a harder
heart than Mr. Frohman is credited with
end to have aroused all the missionary
there is in him. At any rate, the stern
manager cannot but be pleased with the
reception accorded bis star and play. The
house was a record house and Miss Bates
Â¦was greeted with an enthusiasm that was
timpiy overpowering.
It was a little difficult last night to sub
tract the actors from the play, to judge
rightly Mr. Potter while Miss Bates as a
home product was drawing applause as
much patriotic as anything else for her
good work. But it seems the playwright
has made gcod use of his material and
produced a shapely, spanking, colorful,
thrilling melodrama. The first act, largely
explanatory, is scrappy and disappointing,
but the second act immediately grips the
interest and from that on the play goes
smoothly. The little French Carmen, Cig
arette, first appears in the second act, in
an Algerian wineshop amid a crowd of
more or less drunken soldiers and dancing
pirls, and one knows immediately why-
Mr. Belasco chose Miss Bates for the
part- Hfirs is both a strong and subtle
characterization of the part. Vivid and
magnetic, the California girl's conception
has all the brilliant, tigerish passion and
power that this child of the campâ of
thoss whose instincts are of sufficient
\ita!lty to make them Imperiousâ would
niurally possess. She is lithe and instant
In her emotions, fearless, loyal, frank and
entirely spontaneous. One Is with her in
all her moods, and it can be said that this
picture of a vivandiere Is the best thing
that Miss Bates has yet given us. Her
wild ride up the scenery was quite ac
cording to schedule and the charming lit
tle speech, .in which she "hoped her
friends were one-tenth as glad to see her
as she was to be here," was quite the
prettiest thing in the play.
Miss Bates' support Is good, not to for-

in the strike situation took place at 7
o'clock this forenoon, when the lathes
and machines in most, of the machine
shops of the city were put into action.
At first it appeared that the employers
had engaged a large number of workmen
and had their shops well supplied. How
ever, â¢ after a look through the shops it
could "Be seen that the noise was being
made by the machinery and not by the
men. Only about thirty-five men, includ
ing all branches of the metal trades, went
to work. The union machinists claim that
not one . of these was ever a member of
their union.
Although very few men began work,, the
employers wear a Â¦ satisfied air and de
clare they have accomplished what they
wanted. Â¦ Â¦- Â¦ *, ,"
Mr. Hulme, general manager of the Vul
can Iron Works and president of the local
branch of- the Metal Trades Association,

"The main object in starting . to-day
was simply to put ourselves on record as
having offered to take the metal workers
back at the same rate of pay and' same

no doubt that we can get men, if not
from Seattle, from other placesâ in fact,

union was organized here three months
ago, and two weeks ago the men in this
establishment passed resolutions demand
ing eight hours' work instead of nine, $3 50
a day for first-class and $2 50 a day for
second-class men, and time and a half for
Sunday and night work. .
Last week the men worked but eight
hours, and on Saturday night they re
ceived pay for but eight hours. They ac
cordingly went on a strike.
Mr. Barrett says that his firm will. hold
out against the strikers and will attempt
to replace them with men from San Fran
cisco. As the Fresno plumbers are x in the
Federated Trades they are confident that
no other men can be engaged. No other
establishment has been affected by the
strike as yet, but it Is possible that it may
become general.

COSTLY FE/0SECTTTI02T
OF YUKON MURDERER
Dominion Has Already Expended
More Than $100,000 in the
O'Brien Case.
DAWSON, June-14. via Seattle, June ?4.
âThe trial of George O'Brien, charged
with the murder of Lynne Wallace Rolfe
and Fred H. Clayson, both of Seattle, and
Ole Oleson, a Dawson-Skaguay telegraph
lineman, on Christmas day, 1899, -on the
winter trail near Minto, south of Dawson,
was begun here this week. It is the most
absorbing and sensational ever held in the
North. The magnitude of the case a3
prosecuted by the Government may be
gathered from the fact that the estimated
cost already of the prosecution Is more
than $100,000. Eighty witnesses have been
gathered here by the crown from all parts
of the Yukon and from the States and*
Lower Canada. Captain Scarth of the
Northwest Mounted Police, who has con
ducted the search for witnesses and evi
dence for eighteen months, has left not
the slightest clew upturned and thousands
after thousands of miles have been tra
versed in the Yukon and outside by Ms
big corps of assistants, notable among
them being Detective McGuire of Chicago.
The work of searching for O'Brien's
supposed accomplices and In gathering
clews to evidence has entailed the most
extraordinary detective work ever done
in the North. Much was done In the dead
of the Arctic winter. Men have trailed
the supposed accomplices the full length
of the Yukon and up tributary streams of
the river. Some of the special detectives
went down the Yukon and out by the way
of Nome and Seattle last fall.

â¢ - Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ' ' Â¦ . 'Â¦ X
Â¦ Tim Hegarty, the 'Australian boxer,
who traveled half way round the globe to.
display his prowess in the ring to local
fight-goera, will not be able to keep his
engagement with Tim Callahan on Friduy
evening rr%xt. .Hegarty broke his right
hand on the hard head of "Billy" J de
Coursey, his boxing partner, on Thursday
last, and although efforts were made to
conceal this fact because he might be
able to fulfill his contract, it developed
last night that he was positively unable
to go on.
Manager Gleason of the Twentieth Cen
tury Club, rather than disappoint the pub
lic, immediately engaged Joe Bernstein
to take Hegarty's place. He was ex
tremely fortunate in having such a clever,
well trained boxer on the scene, and he
quickly came to an agreement with the
New York featherweight. Bernstein has
Just returned from Los Angeles, where he
fought Solly Smith twenty fast rounds,
and is fit to enter the ring at a moment's
notice. He will devote the next four days
to preparation and believes he can enter
the arena in condition to give Callahan a
hard battle. X l : â¢ Â¦ ..,â¢
Hegarty is very much disheartened by
his tough luck. He counted on defeating
Callahan and then trying conclusions with
McGovern. He trained faithfully for the
battle, and at the- eleventh hour received
a setback. .He will ; be taken 1 to an X-ray
establishment this morning. and the ex
tent of . the injury, to, his hand will be
shown. Dr. Howard, who has attended
him, believes the- injury Is a slight one
and thinks Hegarty will soon be able to
use the member. It is the plan to match
him with the winner of the Bernsteln-
Callahan. bout. Â¦â¢Â¦.'Â¦Â¦
Bernstein and Callahan. have always ex
pressed a willingness to box each other,
but could never make a match. Both men
have met the best men in their class.
Cnllahan .has the, distinction of having
fought McGovern three times and In each
contest made a splendid showing against
the champion. Bernstein fought McGov
ern twice, and in one battle went twenty
live rounds to, a: draw. At their second
meeting Terrible Teddy scored a knock
out In seven rounds.' -
Bernstein and Callahan will fight
straight Marquis of Queensberry rules,
and as this permits hitting with one arm
free the men should put up some fast
fighting. Both like this style of boxing.
Jack Root and "Kid" Carter will appear
in the main event. They will box twenty
rounds to a decision. Carter has trained
at the Six Mile House and Root at Croli's
Gardens. Alameda. Both men are re
ported to be in first-class shape.
Phil Wand will act as referee in both
contests. The bouts will be brought off
at the Pavilion on Friday night and tick
ets will be sold at Corbett's, on Elite

The awards for coal and shoes for the

ticular brand of coal and against award
ing the contract to a firm whose shoes
are not of home manufacture were filed
The bid of the W. S. Merrill Co. for
drugs to be furnished the Almshouse was
rejected because the firm is an Eastern
concern.
The board also rejected the bid of the
Hayden Printing Company.
Attorney Costello, on behalf of ten
printing firms, petitioned that new- bids
be readvertised for. agreeing to bid $3000
less than the Hayden Company and give
a guarantee therefor. Costello said, his
clients had been misled by the notice In
the proposals to the effect that none but
those in the bookbinding business would
be allowed to bid,! and the city had lost
the benefit of much competitive bidding
thereby. A petition from the Bookbind
ers' Association, asking that- the bids be
rejected, was also read.

The Board of Supervisors followed the
example of the Fire Commissioners yes
terday by ordering the rejection of bids
for hay and forage to be furnished the
Jails and police department. The Police
Committee reported that in instances
where the bid for an article, upon invest
igation, was considered exorbitant and
much too high in comparison with mar
ket values and prices heretofore charged
the bid was recommended for rejection.
The committee's recommendation that
the same be readvertised in a supple
mental schedule, particularly hay and
for-age and surgical Instruments and
milk, was adopted.

RESTORED
"A Woman" Is as Old as She
â¢Looks, a Man as Old as
He Feels/'_ \
|~kLD AGE IS ONLY THE FREEZING OF
v^ the blood, through the lack of sufficient
animal heat to keep it warm. As long as you
can keep up the fire of vitality you will feel
young and your nerves will be full of vim and
energry.
Tho basis of animal heat Is Electricity. That
is why so many old men prize
Dp. McLaug-hlia's Electric Bel w ..
It has made them lively, vigorous and youth-
ful ; it has warmed their blood and restored
their animal spirits.
"Your Belt has made me feel like a new man.
[ am getting stronger every day. my ambition
is returning and 1 feel like a different person."

If you are setting- old too soon, and have lost

Remains of Little George Cain Are
' Brought Ashore on the Madrono.
The lighthouse tender Madrono returned
from the Farallones yesterday bringing
the remains of little George E. Cain, the
10- year-old son of the head lightkeeper,
who died several days ago of diphtheria.
An attempt was made to secure the ser
vices of a tug, but all the owners were
afraid of the Quarantine officer, so the
lighthouse Inspector took the matter up.
After permission had been received from
the quarantine authorities a metal casket
was secured and out at the island the
remains were placed in It.
Sunday it was blowing a living gale at
the Farallones and the Madrono had 10
stand out to sea. During-the night there
came a lull for an hour, and in that time
the bodv was got aboard the tender.
Lighthouse Keeper Cain and his wife
came ashore with the remains. The cas
ket was landed at the quarantine station
and after it has been examined and
sealed up will be given back to the par
ents for burial. " Â¦ - '
The Madrono had a very rough trip to
and "from tha islands, as it blew a gale
the whole time save for the hour's lull.
DIPHTHEBIA ON FAHALLONES.
THE United States army transport
Grant arrived from Manila via
Nagasaki with the Forty-eighth
and Forty-ninth infantry yester
day. She sailed from the Philip
pines on June 1 and from Japan on June
7, thus making the run across in twenty
three days. The Grant has made a record
round trip and Captain Bruguiere brings
her into port looking as though she had
just come off the dry dock.
The Grant left here the latter part of
April on "hurry up" orders. She made a
splendid run to Manila and v,-as held
there only long enough to discharge and
put the homeward bound regiments
aboard. Captain Bruguiere came home
by way of the Great Circle, going up be
yond the forty-ninth degree of latitude,
but there was not even, the sign of a cold
among the men on the ship, even, though
the weather was freezing.
The Logan left Nagasaki fifteen hours
and the Thomas seventy-three hours
ahead of the Grant, so both of them
should be along to-day.
The Grant brought up 73 cabin passen
gers, 1109 men of the Forty-eighth Infan
iry, 732 men of the Forty-nintn Infantry,
6 prisoners, 16 officers' servants, 6 stow
aways and 2 men from the Relief. Those

Vast Improvements to Bring
Road Up to Eastern
'y'\- Standard.,
CHICAGO. June 24.â Between $Â£9,000,000
and $40,000,000 is to bo spent by the South-
ern Pacific management Jn the . next few
years with the view of placing, the sys
tem in the best possible condition in
equipment and facilities. The problem of
bringing the road up to the standard in
these respects has been given to Presi
dent Hays' for solution, and most of, his
time will be devoted to it.- It was par
tially with a view to giving Hays every
opportunity of accomplishing the task in
the quickest possible time that Harriman
has given the traffic of the road exclu
sively into the charge of Stubbs.
Although the Southern Pacific in its
entirety is a fine property, there are few,
if any, great systems where there is need
of such an immense expenditure. Under
tne management of the late C. P. Hunt
ington very little money, comparatively
speaking, was expended yearly for Â¦ bet
terments. Now thousands of miles of
flf ty-two-pound rails - must be replaced
with those weighing eighty-five or ninety
pounds, so that engines weighing .between
one hundred and one hundred and twen
ty-five tons may safely be operated over
them at a high rate of speed. Official
recognition has been given to the fact
that the curves must be straightened
where possible, grades reduced, roadbeds
bettered and wooden bridges and trestles
displaced by structures of steel over the
entire line. Improvement work all along
the line will be done, in such a manner
as not to interfere with the traffic. .

Samuel Calloway lay down upon his bed
in the Sterling House yesterday fore
noon and shot himself through the brain.
Calloway kept a small cigar stand at
the corner of Third and Silver streets.
He was unable to pay his bills and was
obliged to pawn his watch to pay his room
rent. The body was discovered by L. L.
Ewing, a creditor who called at his room
to collect a bill for $19. Calloway was p
years old and a native of Missouri. He
was unmarried.

INHUMANITY TO CHZLD
Little Girl Is Bsaten Because She
Cannot Work With a Broken
Arm.
A case of neglect, most pathetic in Its
outcome, was investigated by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
yesterday. Lucy B. Cain, a 9-year-old
child, living at 1116 Mission street, suf
fered a fracturo of the upper bone of her
left arm more than a month ago, and al
though a free clinic la situated directly
across the street, from her father's house
no effort was made to relieve her agonies,
and the injured member was allowed to
heal without skilled attendance, Aa a re
Â»ult the bortea have knitted Irregularly
and the arm la almost useless,
Her father la Â»a)d to be an Idle, disao,
lute character and a victim of tha mor
phine habit. He nays he "thought the girl
would get nlong all right without fussing
with a doctor." The nlttle gtrl eame un

nneut a year npof when it was found that

Of late she ht\? often been brutally beat

the duties assigned her on aeeount of her
broken arm. She lÂ» umlerslsed for her age
and shows thu marks of hard treatment.
Her father has never allowed her to at-
Women called the vengeance of heaven
upon the marshals, and children hurled
stones at them. When nightfall came no
tice had been served on the strikers of
all the coal companies but one. and they
were to be served at Thacker. Fearing
an ambush, they waited until mornJng,
and early to-day set out for Thacker.
Some tirne before -noon they attempted to
serve the injunction. A mob followed,
enraged to desperation at the sweeping
character of the Injunction. One reckless
fellow fired the first shot, and almost In-
Etantly the mountain sides echoed the re
port th3t followed the crack ct twenty or
thirty rifles. The deputies fled, barely es
caping with thc-5r lives.
The Ftrike situation is assuming a most
serious stag*. Sheriff HatfieJd has with
drawn all his deputies because, it Is suid,
he does not believe in the police being
â¢used to put down the strike. The United
States Marshals have been alone, and aft
er being chased out of the field to-day it
la believed they will be strongly reln
fcreed and return to enforce the injunc
tion.
On their Journey from Bluefield the offi
cers were forced to travel twenty-five
miles on foot, owing to the destruction of
the railroad by flood. They reached Mat
tewan Sunday evening and immediately
began serving: notices of the injunction
which had been issued by Judge Jackson
of the Federal Court. A mob of strikers
followed, armed to the teeth with fire
arms. On all sides could be heard the
cry. "Down with government by injunc
tion!"
HTXTIKGTOK, W. Va., June 24.âTo
day a posse of Deputy United States Mar-
Ehals, led by A. C. Hufford of Bluefield,
were fired on by the strikers and forced
to flee from the coal fields at llattewan.

One of the most interesting contests in
the history of the Journeymen Barbers'
Union took place last night. At a late,
hour it was a close shave between Du
coyne and Mazriotto for representative to
the Labor Council. The officers whose
election was assured are as follows:
Reports of negotiations pending in
Eastern cities between the employers,
large manufacturers and others who con
trol the iron marts of the East and the
strikers seem to indicate an early ending
of the strike. Mutual concessions are be
ing made, according to telegrams received
at the headquarters in this city, but as to
the nature of their contents a .strict si
lence is maintained. Local strikers are
ready to resume work at once provided
their demand lor a nine-hour day with
ten hours' pay Is granted. The 12*Â£ per
cent advance over present wage schedules
originally asked has been withdrawn.
The striking Ironworkers were paid their
strike benefits yesterday at headquarters.
No decisive action has as yet been taken
by the Jobbing butchers in regard to the
supplying of meat to union eating-houses.
Restaurants that are being supplied by
them secured their meats as usual yester
day, but there was a feeling of unrest
manifest on both sides. It is said that un
less the union restaurant cards are re
moved decisive action will be taken. But
from whom tlv suggestion emanates and
â¢what moral or financial support the move
ment may have no one seems to be In a
position to predicate. Results are anx
iously awaited on both sides.

The above testimonials are only two
of 50,000 letters received touching the
merits of Peruna as a catarrhal tonic.
No more useful remedy to tone up the
system has ever been devised by the
medical profession.
A book on the catarrhal diseases of
summer will be mailed to any address,
upon request, by The Peruna Medlcina
Co.. Columbus. Ohio.
The only safe course to take is to keep
the blood pure, digestion good and sleep
regular. No remedy equals in all re-
spects Peruna fci these purposes. If the
system is run down and weakened by ca-
tarrh, Peruna renovates and rejuvenates
the nerves and brain.
Nervous Debility.
Every one who is In the least degree
subject to nervousness, sleeplessness,
prostration, mental fatigue or nervous
debility In any form finds the hot weath-
er of June, July and August very hard to
bear, If not dangerous..^.
.'.'It is . with pleasure I recommend Pe-
runa as a tcnic of unusual merit. Â¦ A
large number of prominent members of
the different orders . with which I have
been connected have been cured by the
use of Peruna of cases of catarrh of the
stomach and head; also in kidney com-
plaint and weakness of the pelvic organs.
'"It tones up the system, aids diges-
tion, induces sleep, and is well worthy
the confidence of sufferers of the above
complaints."â H. S. Emory. Â¦:.'Â¦ ".- ."
Catarrh of Stomach.
H. S. Emory, Vice Chancellor and Mas-
ter of Arms, K. P.'s, of Omaha, Nebr.,
writes from 213 North Sixteenth street,
the following words of praise for Peruna
as a tonic. He says:
"This is to certify that Peruna,
manufactured by the Peruna Medi-
cine Co., of Columbus, 0., has been
ussd in my family with success. It
is a fine tonic and will build up a de-
pleted system rapidly. I can recom-
mend it to those who need a sate
vegetable remedy for debility." â
W. F. Aldrich. .
Hon. W. F. Aldrich, Congressman
from Alabama, writes from Washington,

The rapid extirpation of these forests by fire is not
creditable to the State. Two sessions of the Legis
lature have passed since the subject of protection of
timber- was pointedly agitated and called to public
attention. Plans for prevention were formulated and
discussed fruitlessly. The State has commissions to
officially regulate the shaving of a man's chin and
the amputation of his hair. It has a board that regu
lates the men who pull teeth and administer emetics.
It has official oversight of architecture provided by
law. Commissions, boards and regencies abound,
sumptuously endowed with public authority to do
everything from pursuit of the white cushiony cotton
scale to the damming of slickens. But it has no
one charged with the duty of preventing the wicked
and wanton destruction of "the forests. The last
Legislature appropriated $250,000 to buy the redwood
forests of the Great Basin. That was proper and
praiseworthy. But that limited forest area lying near
the coast exerts but little influence upon the cli
mate and fertility of the State compared to the' vast
and disappearing forests of the Sierras. If the same
Legislature had given a. few thousands to secure for
est patrols under the guidance of experienced for
esters, with authority to, arrest and bring to swift
punishment the criminal and the careless who set, fire
or permit it to escape, the benefit to the State in the
long run would have been much' greater. All of this
work is left to such voluntary effort as can.be made
by the California and Sierra clubs* and the Waters
and Forest Society.: But all they can do is to urge
legislation and goad. public opinion into influencing
the law makers, for they have no official authority,
and it would be a waste of money for them to pro
vide an unofficial patrol, for wrongdoers would safely
defy it.
The destruction of our forests by fire has not even
the solace of present profit in it The present and
the future are both losers, and of the waste there is
no possible repair. The late rains in the mountains
this year produced an abundant crop of grass which
is now dry and ready to catch from the cigarette or
camp fire of the hunter and camper.. Already enough
timber is burning to obscure the view of the high
mountains from the foothills, and before the quench
ing rains of September the destruction of the forests
will probably exceed that of any past year. It is the
belief of observers familiar with the mountains that
the area- swept by fires is annually increasing, and the
timber destroyed thereby is five times greater than
the yearly cut for commercial purposes. The lum
berman has some excuse for hastening to get all his
timber into merchantable shape, in the certainty that
it will be burned unless he gathers it in.
THE FOREST FIRES.
THE commercial instinct was gratified and the
State was startled by the recent report of a cut
of nearly 700,000 feet of sugar pine lumber in
one week by one mill in the Sierras. It implies the
rapid disappearance of our forests of most valuable
timber, without any means being provided to secure
on the same land another crop. But, after all, it is
putting the present crop to economic use, and though
future generations will miss it, the present one gets
some money out of it.

While the league has thus rendered a service to the
community as a whole, it has not been neglectful of
its mission to advance Republicanism. Called into
existence for the purpose of ridding the party of any
danger of boss domination, and as far as possible
eliminating factions from the party ranks, it has ad
dressed itself to the party as a whole and has invited
to its membership all who stand for genuine Republi
canism. The character of the organization is attest
ed by the character of the men chosen to direct its
affairs, and by those selected to act as an advisory
committee. These gentlemen are known as the ex
emplars of a broad and comprehensive party loyalty.
The organization has no particular candidate to sup
port nor any to oppose. It seeks only to bring out
the full strength of the rank and file of the party at
the primaries so that the delegates elected to the nom
inating convention may be truly representative of the
party. A convention made up of such delegates can
be relied upon to nominate a ticket that all Republi
cans and independent dozens will be willing to sup
port
To such an organization there can be no objection
except on the part of men who have factional in
stincts, or who are desirous of playing the part of
leaders in order to gratify an uneasy vanity or to
promote the ambitions of some candidate who pre
fers to trust to intrigue rather than to make an open
canvass before the party as a whole. Such men are
naturally in opposition to the league, for the league
is in opposition to their schemes. It is hardly
credible, however, that any man who possesses a fair
amount of political sagacity will advertise himself as
a would-be boss^by setting up a faction and trying to
split the party on the very eve of the campaign.
It is now the duty of all Republicans to unite with
the league and co-operate in the work of making the
primary elections not only fair and honest as the
law designs, but a full and clear expression of the
will of that great body of good citizens who make up
the party strength. There may be here and there
some notoriety â¢seeker or office seeker who will
try to push himself to the front, and* who
will take to himself a high sounding title, parad
ing as chairman of this or president of that, assuming
to speak for some mythical committee or association
of the part)', but he will not seriously disturb the
harmony that prevails among the rank and file. This
is to be a campaign for victory. The way to accom
plish it has been pointed out by the Republican
JLeague and is summed up in three words: register
fpd unite. . ' . "â¢
REGISTER AND UNITE.
BY the Republican Primary League there has
been issued an earnest appeal upon the sub
ject of registration. The appeal points out
that "all citizens not registered at the last election
should register; all who came of age since the last
general election also, and all citizens not registered
who have secured a legal residence in the State and
county since the last general election; all foreign-born
citizens naturalized within ninety days next preceding
the last ger-ral election and prior to May 15, 1901;
all electors who have changed their residence from
another county in this State to this county since the
last general election and prior to May 15, 1901, should
register. The largest class who must register is where
a citizen was registered but has moved out of his
precinct All this class must register in order to
vote. All citizens who are on the register and who
have made no , change of residence since the last
general election need not register."
It will be noted that the appeal is not addressed to
Republicans only but to all citizens. It is in no sense
partisan. Its object is to arouse the voters to a con
sciousness of the importance of primary elections, so
that they may register and secure their right to take
part in them. The approaching primary election is
to be held on August 13, and registration so far as
that election is concerned will close on August 3.
Those facts should be impressed upon the minds of
business, working and professional men, who are so
apt to overlook political -duties and neglect the pri
maries.

PERSONAL MENTION.
THE most distinguished of the lay
men who are expected to attend the

Is probably Captain Alfred T. Mahan, who
has been elected from the ' rtfocese of
Washington, D. C. Captain Mahan.
though serving a long and active career
in the navy, seems to have lacked oppor
tunity for the performance of those con- !
spicuous actions which crown the naval
hero \with enduring fame. His record
from the time when he entered the navy
as a cadet in 1859, after graduating at An
napolis, until his retirement three years
ago, was that of a faithful and studious
officer who was held in supreme confi
dence by, his superiors. After serving in
Brazil until 1S61 he was assigned . to - the
frigate Congress and afterward to the
steamer Pocahontas, serving with the
blockading squadron until 1862. On Au
gust 31, 1861, he was commissioned as lieu
tenant. In 1862 and 1863 he was assigned
to the United States Naval Academy and
afterward successively to the steam sloop
Seminole, steamers Muscoota and Iro
quols, the last' with the Asiatic squadron.
In 1869 he was commander of the Aroos
took, then in China waters, and In 1870
and 1871 served at the navy yard. New
York. In 1871 he commanded the Worces
ter and received his commission as com
mander in .1872. In 1S73 and 1874 he com-
As soon as the seedlings bud they are
sent to different parts of the country to
be grafted on plants which have already
been started. Thu3 it is soon discovered
whether the plant. is sufficiently hardy,
and the only remaining question is as to
the quality of the fruit.
Â¦ When the ' stamen has been completely
removed pollen Is gathered from the blos
soms of the trees in the Government
greenhouses and shaken lightly upon tha
prepared flower. Then the bag is tied
tightly In place to make sure that no
pollen from the same tree becomes
mingled with that already used. After
the fruit has had time to begin forming
the bags are removed and the twig 13
marked with a tag giving the name of tha
other parent.
The paper bags are used to protect tha
flower -which has been fertilized with thÂ«
pollen of the sweet orange. The first step
in the operation of cross-fertilization is
the removal of the pollen-bearing stamen
from the blossom. This is done with
small scissors and pincers.. The petals
are also removed, leaving the stigma ex
posed. This is all done before the blos
soms are fully opened; for by that time
there is danger that bees or other insects
might have carried the pollen from some
open blossom and deposited It on the
stigma.
The 300 hybrid seedlings which Profes
sor "Webber has secured represent a deal
of patient labor. To cross varieties which
are closely related is a comparatively sim
ple matter, but the- Chinese orange and
the Florida, variety have been so Ions
separated, and have grown In such differ
ent environments, that they have almost
forgotten that they belong to the same
genus, and they do not take kindly to
each other. Consequently not more than
one blosom out of a hundred fertilized
with the foreign pollen bears fruit; and
then not more than seven out of fifteen
seeds in that fruit Â¦will germinate and pro
duce a plant.
Experiments with this end in view be
gran several years ago. At the present
time the department has about 300 hybrid
seedlings. It Is expected that some of
theje will bear their nrst fruit this fall,
though the majority of them will not bear
msich befora next year.
One plant . with these characteristics
would be worth more than a bonanza
gold mine. It would nerve as the parent
stock for thousands, of ** plants which,
would be grown throughout the Gulf
States, revolutionizing the agricultural In
dustries there and yielding millions to
the growers.
And this Is the explanation of the crop
of paper bags. The blossoms of the tree
have just been crossed with the St.
Michaels and 6aguina oranges. 1 which
are the standard varieties of sweet jHor-
Ida fruitl Professor "Webber is trying to
secure a hybrid which will retain tha
edible qualities of the sweet Florida cr
ange, and at tha same time preserve the.
hardiness of the Chinese mother tree.
The tree is the particular charge of Pro
fessor Herbert J. "Webber, who, with hl3
assistant, is responsible for its bagging.
It Is a species of orange tree, the variety
having: been brought to the United States
from China about ten years ago with the
idea of using it for hedges. It is ever
green, grows about fhlrty feet high and
has sharp thorns. The fruit is small and
runty, and quite unfit for food. But the
fact that it flourishes as . far north as
Maryland, Kentucky, Indiana and Mis
souri gives it a great value to the scien
tists, who are experimenting 1 with a view
to securing a more hardy breed of orange.
A large crop of paper bags seems to be
the yield of a little tree which stands In
the grounds of the Department of Agri
culture at "Washington says the New
York Sun. There ars about fifty of these
bags, each with the neck tied -firmly, as
close Inspection discloses, about one of
the terminal twigs. The effect is rather
grotesque.
GOVERNMENT
I SEARCHING FOR
HARDY ORANGE
The junction is now fairly made between the ir
rigators and the stockmen. The purpose .of each
class can be forwarded in one bill, and the greatest
step taken in the interest of the West since the rail
roads were. built can ; be accomplished. The country
will be relieved by this determination of the West
to use the public domain as a producing asset to pro
vide irrigation in preference to putting another load
on the sinful shoulders of the river and harbor bill.
The progress of aridity will be arrested by leasing the
stock ranges and making -it to the interest of the
leaseholders to renew their forage, thereby restoring
the vegetable protection to the moisture in the soil.
The deep springs that have been dried up by de
struction of the ranges will again become affluent, and
the run-off of streams will recover its regularity. So
this policy will not only get money for irrigation
works; but will also conserve the water to fill them.
The sale of lands in the , States nanxed will not
produce much revenue, 1 and when sold the revenue
ceases altogether; but the "disposal" of lands by
leasing the stock ranges will produce approximately
ten millions of dollars a year, and it will not cease
with the first year, but will be continuous and prob
ably increase as the "pasture is permitted to. recover
and the land carries more stock. That meeting of
irrigators might as well have. used, the phrase, "Sale
or lease," for leasing is the only other method of dis
posal of the public domain, and the Government is
already leasing the grazing lands in the Indian reser
vations, very .beneficially to the lands and to the In
dian funds. Not only does this irrigation plan cover
the land leasing, which The Call has so long advo
cated, but it covers the detail. of that plan which we
have suggested by making it optional with the States
and Territories concerned whether they will accept
such a law or not. The meeting proposed that any
of the States or Territories t desiring to avail them
selves of the provisions of 'the act shall enact laws
accepting its provisions and organize and maintain
a State engineer's office, with authority to plan and
make estimates for reservoirs, "to be paid for out
of the reclamation fund. As another important de
tail they propose that such works shall belong to the
State and may be sold only to' the actual consumers
of the water. This is to prevent their alienation to
speculators in drought and famine, and properly holds
them for the use of the .land irrigators and tillers for
whose benefit they are built. If so sold the proceeds
are to go back into the arid land fund, to be used
over again for reclamation purposes. That is an ex
cellent provision, for if honestly administered ; it
creates a revolving fund that may be used over and
over again to develop and store water.

The pity of pities in the whole sad business is the
harm wrought in Christendom itself by those who
rob, murder and oppress in its name. How can peo

of Christianity which cries out to mankind, Return
not evil for evil, but overcome evil with good; love
your enemies, and those who despitefully, use you;
let not the sun go down on your wrath, and let him
who is without sin cast the first stone? Who can

regretting that he was not able to steal more from
those he called his enemies? Then who can imagine
his followers sweeping the ' country bare with the
vile besom of greed and lust, and making a starving
people pay for being robbed?
The undoing of the wretched wrong must prob
ably be left to remote time and history. When
Europe has reached the period of decay that follows
all national excesses, out of Asia may be shot the
We do not impeach British public opinion nor
governmental policy with willing acquiescence in this
sordid tragedy, but unfortunately for humanity Eng
land is in no position to aid in the enforcement of
the American and Japanese view.
But turn where one will there seems no spark of
humanity or justice to encourage the hope of a more
humane policy. Our Government has fought the dip
lomatic fight for justice step by step, but could not
prevail alone or with the help of Japan only among
the nations.
An Americaa has the right to feel proud at the
moderation of our soldiers and the attitude of our
Government. We and Japafl present the only bright
spot in this bloody picture of murder, greed and re
pacity. The nations prate about trade with China
and at the same time propose to burden those people
with exactions that will leave them able to supply
only the most primitive wants, while what should go
into trade to keep pace with their rise to a higher
plane of existence, with its wants increasing with the
ability to supply them, will go to gorge ihe greed of
the worst band of robbers that ever made the vin
dication of religion a pretext for crimes unspeakable.
In all justice and common fairness China should
be c/edited with the millions stolen and destroyed,
and if the life of a Christian is appraised at a certain
sum, the life of an innocent Chinese murdered wan
tonly by a brutal soldiery should at least partly off
set that sum.
It is a grievous spectacle, but in all Christendom
there appears no man tall enough above the sordid
mass to sting the civilized conscience with the re
morse that should frighten it at contemplation of the"
crime.
THE , European powers are getting ready for
further and most outrageous exactions' from
China. Not content with- devastating a popu

cent people andleaving hundreds of thousands to die
of famine by cutting the grand canal and inundating
the country, they demand ian indemnity â¢ which gro
tesquely exceeds any proper compensation for in

The New Bicycle.
Bicycle manufacturers state that the bicycle
for this year will be practically the same model
as 1900, as improvement seems to be impossible.
Precisely the same Is true of' Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters. It represents the limits of
science, and it is impossible to make a better
medicine for the stomach, liver, kidneys and
blood. Try it for dyspepsia, lndlgrestlon. con
stipation, flatulency or . sour stomach and you
will be convinced. Never take a substitute.
Retail cigar dealers assembled at Py
thian Castle last night for the ostensible
purpose of enjoying themselves In a social
way, but tho real purpose was to take Ini
tial measures for the establishment of a
formidable association.
When the politicians ascertain the true
significance of the meeting they will learn
that a movement Is on foot to unite all
the men engaged in the business of selling
liquors and tobacco. The cigar dealers
huve resolved to form an association sim
ilar to that established by the retail liq
uor dealers, and then appoint a committee
to bring both associations together for the
purpose of protecting their common Inter
ests at the polls on election day. In fact,
the dealers in liquors and tobacco propose
to take an active part in municipal -and
State politics. The candidates placed In
nomination by the political conventions
will bo reviewed ana those who are re
garded as inimical to the Interests of the
combined association will be turned down
regardless of politics. A ticket made up
from the nominees will be Indorsed by the
joint association.
Tlils purpose was formed after due de
liberation and the committee will be se
lected at the next meeting of the cigar
dealers.
The Republican Primary League Is daily
growing in strength and influence. Lead
ing Republicans in every district of the
cuy commend the organization for its ex
cellent work. The league has already
awakened widespread interest in the ap
proaching primary election. Confidence
la the ability of Republicans to win a. vic
tory at the next municipal election Is in
creasing.
The idea of incorporating the league
was a good one, although some Repub
licans were at tirst inclined to object to
incorporation. The fact is recalled that
i he Progressive Union League Club of
this city tiled articles of incorporation
July lh, LSXS. It was incorporated to "as
sist in advancing the cause of
good and wise government and
the honest and patriotic adminis
tration thereof." The Republican
Primary League was incorporated to
mvakeii public interest in primary and
General elections, and to assist in advanc
ing the cause of Republican supremacy in
me municipal government.
The prospects for Republican success in
the municipal campaign of this year are
bright, anu are growing brighter every
day by reason of the increasing demorali
zation in Democratic ranks. Of late there
lists been a deal of talk about the organi
sation of Jefferson clubs to tight Phelan
ipm, but Phelan in the flesh seems to be
tretting the upjjer hold of Jefferson In the
spirit. McNab, McDonald and the regime
of Democratic officeholders are for Phe
lan. The programme is to force the nom
ination for Mayor on Phelan. Assessor
l>o<lge is regarded as the strongest avail
able man in the party, but his friends in
sist that he shall hold the office of Asses
sor ur.iil the four-year term for which he
was chosen shall have expired. Then iÂ£
will be time to present him as the ac
ceptable candidate of the * arty for
Mayor.
Phelan tells his close friends that he
has made his plans for travel in Europe
and will not accept renomination, but the
programme is to coax him. He will con
pent, according- to programme, and pose
before the public as one who sacrifices
his personal inclinations to serve the peo
ple.
The Republican League rooms at the
Baldwin Annex were crowded last even
ing. Sixty or seventy' Republicans from
the Forty-fourth Assembly District held
a conference there and exchanged views
on the subject of district organization.

of one Palmer, but which "demand the
Treasurer refused to recognize untilthe
same had been passed upon by the Au
ditor of the city and county. In his opin
ion Judge Seawell holds that "bail moneys
deposited with the Treasurer are, in con
templation of law, in custody of the
court and subject to its orders. The stat
utes which prescribe the means by which
they may be paid out are not laws direct
ing the payment of money out of i the i
treasury within the meaning of the
charter, but they are laws which regulate
proceedings in courts of criminal jurisdic
tion and prescribe the powers and duties
of the Judges thereof.
"Therefore, the demurrer is overruled
and a peremptory writ of mandate issued
as prayed." * â
Although Treasurer Brooks was at first
inclined to take an appeal from the de
cision, he later in the day made up his
mind to pay all bail money orders as aoon
as presented. This information was con
veyed in a note sent to the Auditor's of
fice shortly before closing hours. It was
stated by Cashier Perkins that since the
1st of April, when the Sullivan forgeries
resulted in the refusal of the Treasurer to
honor these orders, over $40,000 had ac
cumulated. As fast as presented, the de
mands will now be paid.
Of this amount County Clerk Deane
was charged with a large sum represent
ing forfeitures and fines. Chief Deputy
Goddard, who has had charge of this
matter, has been carrying the orders of
the Police Court Judges as cash in his
daily settlements, and a considerable por
tion of this amount will be turned at once
into the general fund.
Judsro Sea well lianded down a decision
yesterday to the , effect that bail moneys
l>Â£Jd into the treasury to secure the re
lease of- prisoners may be withdrawn
upon warrant without following the tire
come routine "for the payment of money
out of the treasury" established by the
provisions of the charter. . -

higher at 66%@-66 s /ic to 66%c. In sympathy with
corn prices, it dropped to 66%<g66%c, but on re
ports of damage .by excessive' rains in the

later and closing M@Mc lower at 66%@66%c.
Corn opened stronger on higher cables, . to
gether with reports of damage by excessive
heat in the West. Receipts continue light and

strength at the opening, when they were forced
up from Saturday's close. The feature of the
day was the big drop in July, caused by offer
ings of long July oats, which were apparent
throughout the session. Phillips bought Sep
tember. September closed l /Â»@Mc lower at

Salmon â An active demand is being experienced
from the country, the weather at the present
time being highly favorable for the consump
tion of this article. On the market there is
net a great amount of business passing, deal
ers being well supplied, while stocks in first
hands are limited. Values are steady. Fruits
â A considerable business has been, done in
Epricots during the week, and prices are again
firmer. Holders who succeeded in getting their
ehipments through before the imposition of
the duty have met thÂ» market, and eonsequent
lj- these goods are rapidly passing into con
sumption. Peaches and pears also "meet a
eteacty inquiry, the market showing a firmer
tendency. In Liverpool fruits continue very
strong, and apricots particularly are 6d to Is
per dozen dearer in consequence of the en
hanced value of stocks through the duties.
Pears and peaches also in sympathy are higher
in value. Pineapples, it is stated, are likely
to have a very strong advance, as shipments
are light, and it is very questionable whether
contracts that have been made will be filled.

â¢vertiser's London financial cablegram says;
Stocky Exchange brokers to-day were discussing
holidays instead of transacting business, with
the- result that trading was well-nigh dormant.
As there was no business to transact, or at
least no inclination to transact it. members
larked like school boys. It was a blank day
for American shares.

Three cars of Oranges were ' auctioned at
very low prices, as follows: Choice Navels,
35@40c; Australian Navels, 30@45c; Mediterran
ean Sweets, 25@S3c; Valencias, $1@1 55- st
Michaels, $1 40@l 50; Seedlings, 25@35c. Though
the offerings were generally In poor condition
this was not the only reason for the low prices'
The fact is the ijrange market is very dull
and retailers say that they are only selling one
box now where they sold ten a few weeks ago.
The demand at this season of the year is for
the summer fruits, and Oranges are according
ly neglected. Lemons and Limes are also dull
and weak.' ' .
Orchard Â¦ fruits remain about the same as at
the close of the week, the market being freely
supplied with all varieties. Some very small
and poor Apricots are selling In bulk down to
$10 per ton. The demand for Cherries shows a
falling off. There are plenty of Peaches arid
Apples coming in, but Pears are in light sup
ply. Â¦ \ , .
Berries are cheap, as will be seen. Arrivals
are ample for all needs.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. '
The weakness in Eggs continues, and prices
are off, both in' the open '. market and on the
Exchange.. Stocks are too heavy for the mid
summer demand, which !s always light, and
most dealers are overstocked. '
Receipts of Butter continue liberal, and cold
storing is still going on' to keep down the
surplus. Prices are unchanged.
Eastern Cheese is lower, . and receipts are
liberal, as will be seen. . The local product is
In free supply -and easy. ;
Receipts were 74,200 pounds and 519 tubs of

VERY FAST TRIAL RACES.
HENLEY, England. June 24.â Some fast
trials were accomplished here this after
noon, the Pennsylvania crew' doing the
best, covering the full course in 7 minutes
3 1-5 seconds, and half the course in 3
minutes 25 seconds. Starting at forty to
the minute, the Americans never fell be
low thirty-seven and sometimes spurted
to forty-two. A number of British oars
men who accompanied the Americans con
sidered the trial a remarkable one. The
Pennsylvanians were by no means rowed
out. They proceeded to their boathouse,
half a mile farther on, before stopping.
The conditions of wind and water were
not favorable to the oarsmen. The Lean
ders did the course in 7 minutes 35 sec

garded as srood.

DECLARES ERICKSON
WILL TO BE INVALID
Judge Troutt Commends Proponents
Thereof to the Consideration of
the District Attorney.
Judge Troutt decided yesterday that the
alleged last will of Larus Erickson, who
died December 31, 1900, at the Coso House
on Sansome street, leaving an estate val
ued at $10,000% was not the last will of the
deceased. Furthermore, the court com
mended Annie J. Armstrong, sole devisee
under the will, and Adrian Cabrol and
Frederic Delmaa. witnesses to the will to
the consideration of the District Attor
ney.
Shortly after Erlckson's death Annie J.
Armstrong- filed a will alleged to be the
last testament of the deceased, in which
she was named as sole devisee, for pro
bate. She averred, and her averments
were supported by the testimony of Cab
ro! and Delmas, that Erickson had dic
tated the will. Photographer Bacchus
ptrsed judgment upon the will contrary
to the allegations of Mrs. Armstrong and
the weight of evidence supported his opin
ion.
After denying the petition asking for the
probate of the will Judge Troutt said:'
"I. consider it my. official duty to refer
tho transcript of testimony taken in this
case to the District Attorney, that he may
take such action thereon as in his official
duty he may see fit and proper." ,
* The language of the court makes plain
his belief that the will, was forged and if
de,feat in the matter of "the will is the full
measure of trouble that comes to the pro
ponents tnereof it, will be solely due to the
leniency of the District Attorney, In
whose hands the decision of the court has
placed the matter for further investiga

TO GET INTO TROUBLE
Teamster McHugrh Has "Another Man
The suicide had made deliberate plans
for death. He had taken a four-foot
length of rubber tubing, fixed one end
over the gas burner, coiled the slack
around his neck, then turned on the key,
put the other end in his .mouth and lay
on the bed.
A note addressed to the Coroner was
found in the room. It read:
To the Coroner: Advise \V. F. Taylor. 314
Front street, Memphis. Tenn. My name is W.
F. Taylor Jr.; object of suicide, domestic
troubles of long standing.
The note was written with the evident
intent to turn the Investigation away
from what must prove to have been the
real cause of Taylor's despondent deed.
The clew was furnished by W. L. Fon
taine, a member of the tirm bv whom
Taylor had been employed until he was
discharged on June L Mr. Fontaine said:
"I know of no cause for the young
man's suicide save his distress over finan
cial troubles in which he was involved
with our firm. He had been the book
keeper since March, 1900, when he was
given a position through Mr. Thomason's
son, a friend of the young man. I'
"Mr. Taylor was discharged June 1 be
cause we had no further use for his ser
vices. . The financial matters were not
disclosed until after he left our employ.
We have reason to believe that he knew
what had been discovered and that pro
ceedings would shortly be taken by us
to recover his shortage. His people in
the East have not been apprised of the
situation. A letter from us will be sent
within a day or two.
"I do not care to say. at present how
much money is involved. That is the only
cause I know of that would lead to the
suicide. If any other existed it was un
known to me. Taylor was not married."
Taylor had resided in California six
years, coming here from Tennessee for
his health. He resided in rooms on Powell
street, near Geary, in San Francisco.
Among his OaKland friends was Edward
C. Edson. manager of the Gas Consum
ers' Association. Edson had an engage
ment to go to a theater last night with
Taylor, whom he met on the street near
his rooms. :-.,Â¦Â¦.
"He told me that he would have to
break the engagement." said. Mr. Edson
to-day, "because he had to go to Oakland
to' meet his late employers on business. I
cannot understand the note, because Tay
lor was unmarried and could have had no
domestic troubles. 1 had known him
: about a year."
Instead of meeting his employers Tay
lor came across the bay and went direct
ly to the hotel, where he registered at
9:30 o'clock and rertfed a room for the
night He wrote the note to the Coroner
upon a sheet of the hotel paper, and after
drinking a portion of the contents of a
flask of whisky made his preparations for
death.
Taylor was 32 .years oldâ the oldest. of
six sons. His family is one of the most
prominent In Tennessee, and the young
man was idolized by his parents. He was
a graduate of Vanderbilt University of
Tennessee.
So far as his difficulties with his former
employers are concerned, Fontaine- said
to-night that there was no fear that Tay
lor would be arrested, for nothing of that
sort had been contemplated.
The Coroner has taken charge of the
body. Taylor's parents have been notified
in accordance with the request found In
his room.

ages, W. F. Taylor Jr., a former book
keeper for Thomason & Fontaine, street
contractors of this city and Sanfran

The Courrier du Soir. in its issue of this
Â«-vening. predicts the acquittal of the
Marquis, and says the high court per
sists in its determination to punish only
the leading actors in the treasonable ac
tion against the state and to extend- its
disdainful indulgence to the supernum
eraries.
"I Fee in this high court of justice not
judges but political adversaries. You
can punish me by force, but not by
right."
M. Fallieres then begran his monologue,
in which he reviewed the charges against
the Marquis of L,ur-Sa luces in a series of
questions, to which the Marquis vouch
safed no word in reply. Finally M. Fal
iieres asked the Marquis when he fled
across the frontier. The Marquis re
mained silent at this question. The trial
was then adjourned until to-morrow, and
it is said the proceedings will be con
cluded Wednesday.
Ihe Marquis began by reading a long
statoment in the nature of a political in
dictment of the Government, in which he
spoke of the Fashoda incident; the nnan
cia! bankruptcy of France; the Dreyfus
trial, 3nd the campaign against the army.
M. Fallieres requested the speaker to
keep within the limits of the present trial.
The Marquis concluded his address in
these words:
The remainder of the session was occu
pied by two monologues, one by the Mar
quis of Lur-Saiuecs and the other by M
Fallieres.
After reading the plea made by the
counsel of the Marquis, to the effect that
the Senate was null because it was not
composed of all the members of the Sen
ate, rhe names of witnesses were cajied.
Among those who answered were M. Le
l>lne. Prefect of the Paris Police; General
Zurlinden; M. Trarieux, Senator from
G:ron<je: General Chamon and Major
culgnet. while M. de Freycinet, ex-TÂ»lm
iPter of Foreigrn Affairs, and others who
were summoned by the defense, sent
their excuses.
There wore a number of smartly dressed
women in the audience, including the
"White Lady" who followed the Dreyfus
tria!.
Although there was no crowd around
the PalaÂ«e of the Senate and it was evi
dent that the trial was not arousing the
excitement the Marquis anticipated when
he returned to Paris, great precautions
â¢were taken. Two companies of Republi
can Guards and large detachments of
police were stationed in the precincts of
the Palace.
PARIS, June 24.â The Senate assembled
this afternoon in its capacity of a high
court of justice to try the Marquis de
Lur-Saluces, the well-known Royalisf and
former member of the Chamber of Depu
ties, who returned unexpectedly to Paris
about the middle of May, after having
been condemned In January, 1900, in de
fault of appearance, to ten years' banish
ment from France for treason. The Pres
ident of the Senate, M. Fallieree, pre
sided. The Marquis, escorted by two
guards, appeared at the bar of the House
to answer the charge of complicity In the
crimes of high treason and attempts
against the safety of the state, for which
MM. L'eroulede, Buffet. Marcel-Habert and
Ouerin were condemned. There was no
excitement in the vicinity of the Palace,
where the Senate hoids its sittings, as
was the case in the earlier trial of the
Marquis and the others mentioned.

somewhat. James Dunsmulr, the deceased
lady's- brother-in-law, Is en route from
British Columbia, having been advised of
the death qx his deceased brother's wid
ow.. He is expected to arrive to-morrow. .
"As must have been expected,' Mrs.
Hopper is in a condition of nervous col
lapse. . She wag prostrated by the news of
her mother's death. Although she knew
that Mrs. Dunsmulr was seriously ill,
there was no anticipation on' the daugh
ter's-part that she would not arrive here
In time to be with her mother in the cri
sis." â¢ Â¦
Inquiry at the residence this evening
brought the following response from Dr.
Thorne: , :
Mrs. Hopper was driven directly to the
Souther farm, the country residence,
where Mrs. Dunsmulr passed away, and
the young actress is there under the close
attention of thÂ«i physician and the attend
ing nurses.
Upon her arrival she was met at the
Sixteenth-street station by Dr. W. S.
Thome of San Francisco, who was ac
companied by trained nurses.
Â¦ Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper, daughter of
the late Mrs. Josephine Dunsmulr, arrived
to-night from New York in a prostrated
condition. She had received en route the
unexpected news of her mother's demise,
and the shock was so severe that Mrs.
Hopper suffered greatly.

number of about 500, are to spend two
weeks in tents near the seashore. The

of the bathhouses and about 100 yards
from Monterey Bay. There are about J50
tents, 125 of which were loaned by the
State after having be<?n used at Camp
Gage. There are ten streets, each appro
priately namecS. Between the rows of
tents have been built eight brick and Iron
ovens.
The assembly tent has eight-foot walls
and has a seating capacity of 800. In. this
tent the night programmes and re
unions of the California Veterans' Re
union Association are to be held.
Fronting the entrance at the east end
of the camp are the headquarters tents.
The .first Is that of the Ella Carroll Circle.
Grand Army of the Republic, and the.la
dles of the Women's Relief Corps have
their headquarters adjoining.

went forth, and at 7:30 o'clock retreat was

the sunset gun was fired.
Shortly after the sunset gun Colonel

to the camp. A monster campflre had been
built and was blazing in front of the as
sembly tent, and as General Seamans, as
a representative of the National Guard of

was fired. During the evening an address,
was delivered by Judge LÂ«. F. Smith, who
was followed by General Seamans. Hast

< ryMWnMiWWi "v* the skin is most active and the pores well'
open, we are much more liable to be affected by Poison Oak and Ivy and other
dangerous plants. Â¦Workers in brass, copper, lead and zinc have their health im-
paired and the blood supply poisoned through the absorption of fine particles of
these metals arid the acids used in polishing and cleaning them. Inhaling the
fumes of lead give painters that pallid, waxy appearance of the skin. . Barber^ Itch
is another disease that reaches the blood through the skin, and is a most obstinate
one when it becomes firmly fixed in the system. After the poison has reached the
blood and Ijeen disseminated throughout the system it is too late to resort to local
applications. In many cases the blood is affected simultaneously with the appear
, ance of the rash or eruption on the skin, and all efforts should be directed to the
purification and building up of the blood. Ugly eruptions and sores will continue
' to break out in spite of salves, washes, soaps or other external treatment.
S. S. S. is especially recommended for poisons of this character. So com-
pletely does it destroy the effects of the Oak and Ivy that there is no possibility of
its reappearance, and it is equally as efficacious in brass or lead poisoning or Bar-
ber's Itch ; building up and purifying the blood and driving out of the circulation
impurities of every kind, and removing every blemish, sore or eruption from the
skin. There is no substitute for S.S. S. ; it is the only purely vegetable blood
purifier known, and the, safest and best in all constitutional or blood diseases.THE SAN FKANGISCQ CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 25, 1901.

Henry Bertleson, a lame boy, was ar
rtsted yesterday on complaint of the man
ager of the^ Pacific Employment Agency,
Clay street, on the charge of battery. Thp
boy said he had paid the agency |2 to se
cure a situation at Sebastopol, Sonoma
County. He went there and found that
there were no vacancies; He returned to
the" city and when he demanded the re
turn of the $2 it was refused and a fight
fcllowed. The manager returned him the
?2 lr. the City Prison.
Claims He "Was Swindled.
The good people of Mill Valley' think
they have effectually broken up the trade
of the Hlicit liquor purveyors in the; pret
ty little town, and the liquor 'confiscated
remains in the town lockup. There is a
wagonload of it. . . . â¢ : Â¦ .
It was at th's point the younger Land
graft, who is a Mill. Valley liveryman and
a young man of good standing In the
community, Interfered for- peace. Land
graft consented to go before the Recorder
and put up his bail, and allowed his
stock to be taken. Mrs. Landgraft was
not arrested. . .
Trouble was expected at the establish
ment of Joe" Landgraf t. and it came.
Landgraft himself was most abusive of
the officers, and Mrs. Landgraft sat on a
box of bottled beer and helped him. When
that was taken away she seized a demi
john of whisky and declared that it
should not go out of the place, while her
husband threatened to clear the house of
troublesome intruders.
Mrs. Landgxaft Defies Fosse.
John Buss was the next Illicit dealer
visited. He went quietly, gave up his
stock of liquor and put up his $100 also
without disturbance.
It was thought that two of the illicit
dealers would give no trouble, and they
did not. The posse was divided, and Fritz
Schlueter's restaurant was first visited.
He was peaceful. His .liquor was loaded
into the wagon and Schlueter himself was
taken to jail. Later he was released by
City Recorder Roberts on $100 cash ball.
The matter was planned by Mayor Bost
wipk, who is the treasurer of the H. S.
Crocker Company in this city, most quiet
ly. 1 In the first place warrants were se
cured for the arrest *of the men notorious
as breakers of the liquor. law, and search
warrants to cover their premises. Then
Town Marshal Magner of Mill Valley
swore in as deputies J. R. Wood, a teller
in the Crocker-Woolworth Bank of San
Francisco; John J. Newbegin, dealer in
books, with offices in the Flood building,
on Market street; L. L. Janes of the
Tamalpais Land and "Water . Com
pany; A. "W. Bush, a well-known designer
of this city, and L. Parker and O. C.
Capplemann of the Royal Insurance Com
pany. To this posse was joined Mayor
Bostwick, and a large van drawn by two
horses went along to gather in the spoil.
Mayor Plans the Raid.
.Now, Mill Valley is a peaceful settle
ment of home lovers, who have never,
wanted that class of travel that goes on
holidays where liquor is. Also, Mill Val
ley people saw the logic, inasmuch as
Herman Frese had taken out a license, of
protecting him: in his rights under the
town ordinance, and so it was determined
that the "blind pigs" should be raided.
Herman Frese upset the calculations of
the rigid temperance element by taking
out a license for his Mill Valley Tavern,
and it soon became notorious that several
other persons . were selling liquors of all
kinds without the troublesome formality
of taking out a license at all. '
Mill "Valley has always been a temper
ance settlement, but when Judge Angel
lottl of Marin decided that the Tamalpais
Company had no : right to, insert In deeds
to lots sold in the town a. provision for
bidding the sale of liquor the citizens In
corporated, an-1 by way of securing prac
tical prohibition fixed the liquor license at
$750 a year. ;
Mrs. Joe Landgraf t sat on a box of bot
tled beer over in Mill Valley, on Sunday
afternoon, and defied the law and its rep
resentatives in the, persons of Town Mar
shal John F. Magner, six deputies of the
very highest respectability and Mayor: F.
F. Bostwick. Mrs. Landgraf t was assist
ed, not In sitting upon the box of bottled
beer, but in her defiance, by her husband;
and her own son poured oil upon' the trou
bled waters.

shal to Make a Sunday

AND DEFIES LAW
In the evening . John McNaught of San
Francisco delivered the address. His sub
ject was "Patriotism, and Education." He
handled the subject In a scholarly man
ner and pleased his audience. Alvln J.
Purnell rendered a vocal solo, "Splrito
Gen til," by Donizetti. A class reunion and
promenade concert followed.
It is Interesting to note at this time that
this State Normal School is just thirty-nine
years old. The first meeting of the first board
of Â¦ trustees was held on May 23, 1S62. Gov
ernor Stanford presided at that meeting. If
the veil' of the future could have been lifted
at that time and they could have known that
in- less than forty years this school would have
over 3000 graduates and this State would have
five normal scohols with an enrollment of over
2000 students they would have felt more than
they did their tremendous responsibility as
well as opportunity. There were four graduates
In the first class sent out by this school. We
have graduated this year more than 150.
President Joseph E. -Hancock presided
over the meeting this afternoon. The
other officers are: Anna Nicholson, vice
president; Miss I_ Ara Gass, secretary:
Emila E. Newell. Robert A. Lee and E.
E.-Prownell, executive committee. Presi
dent Morris E. Dalley of the State Nor
mal School delivered the annual address.
He reviewed the history of the school and
said:
SAN JOSE, June 24.â The annual reun
ion of the Alumni Association of the
State Normal School opened this after
noon -with an attendance of about 500
graduates of the school. The meetings
will continue three days. To-morrow

and with her will come the ashes of her
husband, who died. in Japan only a few
weeks after the marriage.
The fact that the body of Hugh Tevis
has been cremated will cause a great deal
of surprise, for it was generally believed
that when it arrived there would be an
autopsy to satisfy the family and rela
tives of the real cause of death. Reports
from Japan as to the nature of the ill
ness that proved fatal have been so
meager that an autopsy was thought to
be advisable, but the cremation makes
any further investigation Impossible

was notified and Detectives Harper and

The burglar secured an entrance by bor
ing a number of holes in the door, making
an aperture large enough to admit his
hand, and then, enable him to pull back
the bolt.

glary recorded opposite . his
name.
Last Friday night Collins, it is claimed,
entered the wholesale cigar house of Ri
naldo Bros. & Co., Sacramento and Bat
tery streets, and stole about 32501 cigars.
The following day he; sold the cigars to
A. Berdy. who conducts a saloon at 123
Front street, for about one-half their
wholesale price.
Yesterday morning a private detective
who was working on the case found a
young man trying to dispose of a portion
of the stolen cigars. "When asked where
he had obtained the weeds he said that
they had been given him by Berdy, the
saloon-keeper, to sell. The detective sub

The final contest Letween the childre\i
of the late James G. Fair and the trustees
under his will for the possession of the
personal property left _by the deceased,
now valued at more than $6,000,000, will be
opened before Judge Troutt this morning.
A petition was filed yesterday afternoon
by James S.Â« Angus, Thomas G. Croth
ers and "W. S. Goodfellow, as executors
of the will of the late James G. Fair, in
which they ask judgment of the court de
claring their ninth account to be their final
account as executors, and that following
the settlement of the same "tfce court
issue a decree distributing the residue of
the estate remaining in the hands of the
executors to those entitled to the same
under the law." â¢ .
Charles L. Fair, Theresa A. Oelrichs and
Virginia Vanderbilt, children of the de
ceased, claim the right to the residue re
maining in the hands of the executors un
der the decision of the Supreme Court de
claring the trust provisions of decedent's
will invalid. On the other hand, Angus,
Crothers and Goodfellow, as trustees un
der decedent's will, contend that the deci
sion of the Supreme Court did not declare
null and void those trust provisions under
which they as trustees held the personal
property. Hence their petition for distri
bution as executors is to secure, if pos
sible, a distribution to them as trustees
In their petition the executors state that
on February 8, 1898, the value of the estate
was $12,228,998 07. but has Increased in
value to upward of $17,000,000. They ask
that In the settlement of the final account
the court allow \ them in addition to the
commissions allowed by law for- their
services as executors an increase on the
basis of one-half of the commissions al
lowed by law for extraordinary service.
The. matter of the settlement of the
account and" petition for. distribution will
be orgued before Judge Troutt this morn
ing. Counsel representing the children of
the deceased are confident that the court
will order the distribution of the residue
to decedent's heirs-at-law and are equally
confident that such a decision "will be fol
lowed by an appeal to the Supreme Court
on behalf of the executors which' will tie
the estate up for at least another year.

The merchants of Manila are trying very
hard to find. one Joseph J. Drummond. His
accounts are said to be shy to the extent
of over $12,000 and If he is caught his cred
itors will make it hot for him. Telling all
his friends he was going Into the country,
he slipped aboard the steamship Alrlie
and when last heard from was at Hong
kong and heading for San Francisco.
Drummond went to the Philippines In
1S98 as a member of the First California
Volunteers. He was mustered out in 189&
and opened a canteen. Later he- was man
ager of -the Reception saloon and grill
rooms and last December he went into the
canteen business again. . The largest sin
gle loss by his disappearance was $3500. '
Another firm lost $2000 and a third 5300.

was being 1 made to - stop Drummond at

Major Pickett* will remain in San Fran
cisco a few days and will then proceed
east. Â¦ . . .. *
Early In April last Lieutenant Walls of
the Forty-ninth Infantry captured one of
the Insurgents after a sharp skirmish.
The captured man proved to be a dispatch
bearer and had a number of very valuable
ordtrs on his person. One of the letters
stated that Major Pickett's party had
killed over fifty of the insurgents in the
fight of March 9, and said that had it not
been for the gallant stand made by the
Americans they would all' have been killed
and the money captured. It was the in
tention of the rebels to have waylaid the
major in a canyon two miles from where*
the fight took place, but owing to the es
cort being half an hour ahead of time the
Filipinos' plains were frustrated. In the
canyon the insurgents would have lined
the hills and occupied the treetops and
not one of the party would have been left
to tell the tale. ,
"While the fighting was fast and furious
Myrom M. Cody, of the Sixteenth Infantry
and William Cox,, one of the civilians,
volunteered to go and bring th.e mules
and the money back to camp. Permission
being granted, they crept down the slope
and on coming to the open made a rush
and secured the animals. Then in the
face of the entire rebel force they brought
the mules and the cash back into camp.
Major Pickett describes that as one of the
bravest feats he ever saw- performed
Finding that the handful of men com
manded 1 the situation, the Filipinos finally
withdrew and Major Pickett and his men
reached Cordon.
Major Pickett had $75, COO packed on the
back of mules and ten men under Corporal
Hocker to guard It. There were four men
to drive the mules and two civilians
named Burger and Cox were with the
party. The Filipinos knew that the money
was on the way and the 300 men lay in
ambush Â¦ to Intercept the Â¦ convoy. About
hakf the distance to Cordon had been trav
ersed when the ambush was sprung.
Corporal Hocker was shot in the throat
and died in Major Pickett's arms. Pay
Clerk Oliver was shot In the leg and sev
eral others were slightly wounded. The
mules were stampeded but took refuge
near a clump of trees, and the fire of the
Americans was so deadly that not a Fili
pino could ' get near the animals. A de
tachment of the enemy was sent to out
flank Major Pickett, but he got his men
on another eminence and still commanded
Â»the situation.
It was In March last that Major Plckett
had his closest call. He was on his way
from Solano to Cordon to pay off the Six
teenth, Twenty-fourth and Forty-ninth
infantry, when he was held up by 300 Fili
pinos and every one of the little band of
Americans nearly lost the number of his
mess. â¢
Among .those who came home from the
Philippines on thes transport Grant yester
day were Major George E. Plckett and his
clerk, John V. Oliver. The major is a son
of the famous General Pickett and a fight
er from the word go.' He went from New
York. to Manila by the way of Suez and
on his arrival was appointed paymaster of
the army. During his year of service he
has had to take many chances in "going
from post to post, but the Filipinos never
got a cent of his cash-
