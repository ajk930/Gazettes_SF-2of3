Dozen Taken to Homes.
* In addition to these a dozen or more of
the employes who suffered slight injuries
were taken directly to their homes. Eight
en men and boys have not as yet been
located. The five unidentified bodies ac
count for ten of these and the officers of
the company say they feel positive that
the majority of the remaining fifteen are
by to-night at their homes.
To-night a great force of men is search
ing the ruins and the work will not be
stopped until every foot of the debris has
been explored.
The Penberthy Injector- Company's
plant occupied half a square of ground. It
â¢was composed of two brick buildings, sep
arated by a sixteen-foot alley. The rear
building, in which the boiler was located
and which was destroyed, was three
stories in height, fifty-four feet in depth
and one hundred feet wide. The boiler
and engine room was located at the
northwest corner of the building on the
first floor. Also on the first floor was the
department for testing the output of the
plant. The finishing and brass manufac
turing department was located on the
second floor, and the third floor was de
voted to the foundry. It is impossible to
tell exactly how many men were at work
in the various departments of this rear
building when the explosion occurred, but
. the company officials insist that the num
ber was not over eighty-five. There were
four boilers in the plantâ horizontal
ones, which furnished steam for the en
gines, and two vertical boilers, which
were used solely to test Injectors. It was
the horizontal boilers that were in use
this morning which caused the awful loss
of life.
Awful Crash Comes.
The awful crash^cama without the
slightest warning. Those in the front
building said it seemed like the concus
sion of an immense cannon. The floors
and roof of the rear building bulged up
ward and then crashed down with their
heavy loads of machinery and foundry
apparatus. Walls, roof and all dropped
into a shapeless mass of ' debris. Win
dows in houses for a block around were
broken by , the concussion, and flying
bricks filled the neighborhood. A dense
cloud of dust arose and as it settled and
was succeeded by denser clouds of smoke
and steam agonized cries began to come
Â¦v from the heap of tangled wood, metal
Hind bricks. Those who were only partly
"buried frantically dug -themselves out

Barbacoas Bridge, Midway Between Panama and Colon, the Scene
of an Engagement in Which the Insurgents Are Compelled
to Retreat, After Heavy Losses and Exhausting Their Ammunition
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1901, by the Herald Publishing Company.
COLON, Nov. 26.â A battle between
the Government troops and the
revolutionists took place to-day at
Barbacoas bridge, which is near
the middle of the isthmus of Pan
ama. The insurgents were forced to re
treat toward this town because their am
munition was practically exhausted. The
retreat -was conducted ir. good order. Be
fore their ammunition out the revo
lutionists repulsed the Government troops
three times. The latter force lost a hun
dred men in killed and wounded. The in
surgents' loss was comparatively insig
nificant. Two were killed and seven
wounded on their side. The Government's
wounded were taken to Panama.
There was severe fighting. The battle
was begun at 7:30 o'clock in the morning
and ended at 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
The Barbacoas bridge crosses the Cha
gres River. Ir is a strategic point, and
the Government troops, it is admitted,
gained an important victory in obtaining
possession of it. Their march toward Co
lon will now be less difficult.
\ Fighting Delays Trains.
Owing to the fighting along the line of
the railroad the morning train from Pan
ama, due here at 11 o"clock, was delayed.
The train did not re=tc!i Colon until 4:30
o'clock this afternoon.
The revolutionists ur.der General Lugo
are now at Bohia Soldado, near the rail
road, while the Government force is oc
cupying Tabemllla, a few miles away. An
other battle is promised to-morrow.
General Alban did not leave Panama 10
day. The trains which crossed the istn
mus had United States marines as guards.
No further news -haa reached here con
cerning the revolutionary force under
command of General Domingo Diaz, who
Is supposed to be at 3<tr Pablo, near the
middle of the isthmus.
It is announced that the Government's
loss In killed and wounded at Culebra and
Empire station was eigJity-three and that
the insurgents' was sixty.
Troops Land From Pinzon.
The, Colombian warship General Pinzon
returned to this port this morning with
only one hundred soldiers on board. She
landed the other five hundred men at
Puento Bello, which is about twenty-five
miles from Colon. It Is said that the
force intends to march overland to join
the Government force marching toward
Colon,
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1901.
Another conference was held on board
the French cruiser Suchet at 10 o'clock
this morning. Among those present were
the commanders of the foreign warships,
the captain of the General Pinzon and a
representative of the Insurgents. The
General Pinzon left the harbor again this
evening.
There is considerable excitement in Co
lon, but the insurgents are confident that
they will hold the town.
About one hundred marines who were
to relieve others on the battleship lowa
arrived here this morning on the steam
ship Orizaba. They left for Panama in
the afternoon.
MAY BOMBARD COLON.
Colombian Gunboat May Defy the
Edict of the United States.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 *G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â 1s Colon
to be bombarded by the Colombian forces
despite the prohibition imposed by this
Government? This is a question admin
istration officials are asking as a result
of dispatches received by Secretary Long
late this afternoon from Captain Perry,
in command of the naval forces on the
isthmus of Panama, announcing that the
Colombian gunboat General Pinzon has re
turned to Colon. This vessel, after an
nouncing her purpose to bombard, mys
teriously disappeared yesterday. If she
attempts to fire upon Colon either the
Marietta or Machias will take station
between her and the city and thus pre
vent her from making an attack.
The return of the General Pinzon to
Colon Is the only alarming feature of an
otherwise peaceful situation. Consul Gen
eral Gudger wired the State Department
this afternoon that trains are running
between Colon and Panama without in
terruption.
Bluejackets on Guard.
Detachments of American bluejackets
are on the trains and other detachments
are stationed at various points where
stops are made. An Interesting question
has arisen In connection with the claim
of the Government forces to transporta
tion on the road. The presence of Gov
ernment troops might precipitate an al
tack upon the railroad, and on the gen
eral principle that it would lead to an
interruption of transit Captain Perry will
probably decline to permit either the
tJovernment or insurgent forces to use
the road.' The authorities say the situa
tion is quite satisfactory, and they do not
believe the insurgents have any intention
of taking action which will bring them
into conflict with the United States.
PREDICTS LIBERALS' DEFEAT.
General Castro of Colombia Believes
the Federal Forces Will Triumph.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â Consul General
de Brigard of Colombia said to-day that
he had received a cablegram from Gen
eral Alban describing the situation at the
isthmus. Alban, he said, denied that
Panama was full of Liberal sympa
thizers.
General Diejto Castro, who was at the
consulate, said that both Colon and Pan
ama were free ports, that the temporary
occupation by the rebels would not
amount to much, and that under existi ig
treaties the United States was bound to
preserve order in that Bection. He said
that at the present time Colombia had
32,000 trained soldiers in the field. Qf this
force 16,000 men were with General Valen
cia on the Venezuelan border, in the De
partment of Santander, and another
large force was protecting Bogota, the
capital. At Barranquilla, he said, there
were 1500 men; at Cartagena 2000, and at
Rio Hacha there were 3800 men. The
general said that this force of 7000. men
could be concentrated to support General
Alban on the isthmus, but the Govern
ment did not consider it necessary at the
present time to make an assault upon the
little rebel bands. General Castro said
that General Alban with his force of
100 men, sent to take Colon and now on
board the General Pinzon, would be able
to break up the Liberal bands.

BOGOTA, Colombia, Nov. 20.â The
Colombian Government has is
sued a decree declaring that dip
lomatic relations with Venezuela
have ceased and that the Colom
bian legation in Caracas has been with
drawn.
Senor Concha, Minister of War, says
that the Government has 80,000 men arm
ed for action.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.â Colombia's
severance of diplomatic relations with
Venezuela has created a sensation in offi
cial and diplomatic Washington.
Rather than that war should take place
the United States will undoubtedly again
tender the use of its good offices with a
view of effecting an amicable settlement
of the differences between the two repub
lics.
An intimation was given to the Caracas
and Bogota Governments in August last
that the President was disposed to peace
ably intervene. Colombia gracefully
acknowledged Secretary Hay's note and
expressed willingness that the United
States should act as mediator. President
Castro presented a reply which was a
practical rejection of the American pro
posal, and he subsequently showed that
his refusal was due to a feeling of en
mity entertained for the United States by
accepting the good offices of Chile.
Does Not Mean War.
â¢ Senor Herran, Colombian Charge
d' Affaires, said to-night that the rupture
in diplomatic relations did not necessarily
carry with it the inauguration of hostili
ties.
"To sever diplomatic relations," he
said, "is to give notice to an offending
nation that you do riot desire to be on
speaking terms. Such action does not
necessarily mean war. Relation's be
tween France and Venezuela were sev
ered for more than eight ' years. Italy
and Colombia to-day are without direct
diplomatic intercourse.
"It Is not surprising that Colombia has
been moved to action in view of the of
fensive charges made against her by
President Castro and the Invasions of her
territory by Venezuelan forces. President
Castro's treatment of the Colombian Min
ister at Caracas caused the latter to leave
Caracas in August. If war should take
place the Colombian troops will probably
be led by General Valencia, an able sol
dier. General Valencia was formerly Min
ister of War and Governor of the State of
Santanfier and is now in. command of 12,
00 troops on the Venezuelan frontier.
Colombia has a well-equipped army of
more than 65,000 men. The troops have
been trained in the field,, are courageous
and would give a good account of them
selves.
Expeditions Against Colombia.
"Venezuela has sent various expeditions
against Colombia, but they have been re
pulsed one after the other. Colombia did
not follow up her victories, because she
was sincerely desirous of peace."
Senor Puli*o, the Venezuelan Charge
d' Affaires, said to-night that he had not
heard officially that relations between h^s
Government and that of Ceiombia had
been broken.
"Venezuela was invaded last July by the
forces of Colombia," he said. "President
Castro asked tor an explanation. He de
sired peace, but Colombia has never satis
factorily explained her hostile action. In
case of an international war Venezuela
could put 100,000 men in the field. We have
now available a well trained force of 15,
00 men. " I am confident that war will be
averted and that a peaceful settlement
will be reached.'

REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 26.-But for thÂ«
tender-heartedness ot Miss Gertrude
Beeger of this city Burglar David Miller
might now be reclinins upon a slab in
the city morgue instead of being main
tained at the expense of the State. The
young lady, while the midnight prowler
was at her window and her brother was
scurrying for hi 3 revolver with which to
open fire upon Miller, decided that she
did not wish to be a party to the shed
ding of human blood.
"My brother is coming with a revolver
to kill you," she sa^d to the man at her
window. "You had better hurry away."
The fellow, without pausing to thank
her for the warning, made his escape, just
as the brother entered the room with a
cocked revolver in his hand.
Miller attempted to force an entrance
into the residence of Mrs. Henry Beeger
early Sunday morning. Miss Pauline
Beeger awakened her sister at about 1
o'clock, saying that she heard somebody
at the window. They listened and were
not mistaken. In a moment they saw a
man's face. The eldsr sister arose ard
WeUt to call her brother. Carl Beeger. Thi
two returned to the room, by which time
the burglar had forced up the window
and was about to enter. He saw the two
persons- in the room, but did not move.
Carl Beeger then left the room to set.
his revolver. The burglar remained at
the window gazing at Gertrude, and she
stood her ground and gazed at him. Fin
ally she asked him what he wanted, and
told him he would becter flee before her
brother returned. He accepted this ac
vice, descending the ladder he had used
to reach the window, and dashed away
just as the brother reappeared, revolver
in hand.
The Sheriff's office was notified by tele
phone, and two young men, George Botch
and Cnarles Cullen, hearing of the af
fair and being friends of the Beegers,
started out and captured the man within
three blocks of the scene of the attempted
burglary.
Miller's trip to the penitentiary by way
of the courts was a ra ; >id one. On Mor
day his preliminary examination for bur
glary was held, and he was committal
to answer to the Superior Court. Tliis
morning an information was filed against
him, to which he pleaded guilty. He
waived time for sentence, and Judge
Buck gave him a term of ten years ia
State prison.
KING GIVES HONOR
TO A DEAD DIPLOMAT
Remains of Germany's Late Embassa
dor Are Escorted by Troops
in London.
I.ONDON, Nov. 26.â Fu1l military hon
ors were paid to the remains of Count
yon Hatzfeld-Wildenburg, the late Ger
man Embassador to the Court of St.
James, who died here November 22, when
the body was removed from the embassy
here this evening and taken to the Vic
toria Railway station on its way to Ger
many.
* This exceptional step was entirely dvÂ«
to the initiative of King Edward, wh>
quite unexpectedly notified the relatives
of the deceased diplomat that he desired
to pay this unusual tribute to the Em
bassador, who had untiringly labored in
; the interests of the good relations be-
J tween the two nations.
Half a battalion of foot guards was
j stationed at the German embassy and
! half a battlion of the same troops was
! on duty at the railroad station. The eof
! fin was borne to Victoria station on a
i gun carriage and escorted by the First
; Life Guards. One battalion of the Cold
stream Guards and 100 of the First Gren
adiers formed a special guard of honor.
Representatives of the British Foreign
; Office and other departments were in the
funeral procession.
Much significance is attached here to
this unusual military tribute. It is ex
. plained that King Edward commanded
| that these honors be paid and it is un-
I derstood that the British Government in
! so doing desired to show that it was not
j affected by the anti-English tempest in
I Germany.

ONLY ONE JUROR
CHOSEN SO FAR
Modoc County Lynching
Case Proceeding
Slowly.
Affidavit by Defense Alleging
Prejudice of Court Is
Filed.
ALTURAS. Nov. 26.â The selection of a
3ury in the case of People vs. James W.
Brown, the alleged lyncher. progresses
Very slowly. Only one venireman was
examined during the entire day. Lee
Murphy, who was accepted as a juror
under objection of the defense. Murphy's
idea and understanding of circumstantial
and direct evidence was very hazy' and it
look the combined explanations of both
prosecution and defense to convince him
that he should believe facts adduced
through circumstantial evidence. At ad
journment at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon
the defense was just commencing the ex
amination of the second venireman.
Out of the venire of one hundred tales
men nineteen were reported absent or ex
cused, leaving only eighty-one to choose
from. It is probable that a special venire
â¢will be necessary before the jury can be
completed ,as the case has been so thor
oughly discussed, not only in this county,
but in all sections of the State, that a
man without an opinion as to the guilt
or innocence of the defendants is almost
Â» novelty.
When court was called to order this
morning an affidavit by the defense al
leging prejudice on the part of Judge J.
W. Harrington and a counter affidavit of
the prosecution were submitted. They
were denied admission as evidence. The
affidavit alleging prejudice was in sub
Â¦ cc as follows:
Jrhn A. Brown, being first duly sworn, de
and says that he is personally acquainted
*mh and knows the defendant James W.
Brown, said James W. Brown being af
fiant's nephew; that affiant is acquainted
With and knows the attorneys for de
fendants in this case, to wit, G. F. Harris,
Clarence A. Raker and Spencer & Raker; that
on or about the 15th day of October. 1901. af
fiant met and talked with Judge J. W. Har
riÃgton in the little back room of the saloon
of J. H. Derevan in the town of Alturas, and
that J. W. Harrington said that if he could
Set the case back for trial before him, J. W.
Harrington, he would rule favorably to de
fendants, James W. Brown. leom Eades and
K. E. L.evanton. and give them the benefit of
every legal doubt thaÂ» might arise; that if
he. Judge Harrington, could get the villains
Raker and Harris (meaning John E. Raker and
G. F. Harrisl removed from the case as at
torneys for the defendants it would be but a
phort time until all of the defendants would
got their liberty, as they had been held in Jail
: and only by reason of the actions of
their present attorneys.
Judge Harrington further 6tated at that time
that the defendants would have long since been
liberated but for the action of their attorneys
and that he ' 'hoped to God that affiant wouid
have them thrown out of the case."
Said J. W. Harrington has repeatedly stated
In substance to me the facts above stated since
the lath day of October. 1901. and repeatedly
urged upon affiant as uncle of said James W.
Brows that the attortieys be thrown out of
the case; that affiant being thus acquainted
with sai.l attorneys for said defendants, verily
believes that the discharge of said attorneys
Â¦would have been and would be a detriment and
an injury to said defendants and their case.
JOHN A. BROWN.
This affidavit was allowed to be filed,
but was not admitted in evidence by
Judge Harrington. John A. Brown, the
uncle of James W. Brown, the defendant,
is a lawyer â one of the head counsel for
the Northern Pacific Railroad In Idaho.
MEXICO IS WILLING
TO MAKE COMPROMISE
Case Growing Out of Detention ot
American Boys Reaches the
Diplomats.
SAN DIEGO. Nov. 26.â A sequel to the
detention of George Holmes and Brownie
Pitman, two American boys, by the Mexi
can officials at the line at Tia Juana last
July is told in offers made by the Mexi
can Government of a compromise. Holmes
and Pitman were taking a drive south
from National City, where Pitman re
sides. They secured permission to cross
the line into Mexican territory and were
to return with their horse and vehicle to
this side. They drove a little farther
than they expected, with the result that
they did not get back at the time ap
pointed.
The Mexican officials would take no ex
cuse, but placed the boys under arrest on
the charge of attempting to smuggle the
horse and carriage. Collector Bowers of
this port assured the officials that the
boys' story was correct, but they 'would
hear no explanation. Later the Collec
tor secured the boys' release, but could
not secure the return of the property.
Ho therefore took the matter up at Wash
ington and had his letters referred to the
American representative at the City of
Mexico, with the result that the boys
have received letters within the past few
days from the officials at Tia Juana say
ing that under orders from the City of
Mexico they are prepared to turn over
the proceeds of the sale of the horse and
vehicle. As the outfit was the family
horse and carriage of the Pitman family,
and as it had been sold for $20, less than
m. fifth of its value, the offer has been
refuseo. Meanwhile the Mexican Govern
ment has made no reply to the United
States Minister nor to the authorities at
"Washing-ton, and the case -rill be again
tliken up there.

TRIAL OF EX-POLICEMAN WILSON
ON CHARGE OF MURDER IS BEGUN
Bullet Taken From a Shipley-Street Fence Is Introduced in Evidence,
Presumably to Show That Little Maggie Hartwell Came to Her
Death From a Wound Ir.ficted by Some One Unknown
THE taking of testimony in the
case of Robert G. Wilson, an cx
policeman, charged with the mur
der of little Maggie Hartwell oi=
the evening of Jaly 4 last, began
in Judge Dunne's court, yesterday. With
the exception of the introduction in evi
dence of a bullet taken cut of a fence by
Corporal George W. Kussell the proceed
ings were devoid of gentral interest.
EX-POLICEMAN ROBERT G. WILSON. CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF LITTLE MAGGIE HARTWELL ON
THE EVENING OF JULY 4, AND HIS WIFE. AS THEY SAT IN SUPERIOR JUDGE DUNNE'S COURTROOM
ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE TRIAL.
At the time Wilson was arrested for the
crime of killing Maggie Hartwell he de
nied that he owned api jtol. Subsequent
ly he admitted he had a pistol and that
he fired a shot from it on July 4, but said
he had no intention of killing anybody.
The revolver contained three cartridges
and two shells, and one chamber was
empty. How to account for the sheik?
was Wilson's chief aim. He claimed one
was emptied months previous, and that
the other was fired into a fence in the
neighborhood. Be this as it may, the
bullet introduced in court Vill be alleged
to be the one fired on the evening of the
murder, the effort being to convince the
jury that murder was not intended by the
defendant on the evening in question.

Mrs. A. Cademartori, a neighbor, test!
fied that she saw Wilson fire the fatal
shot. She was standing before his resi
dence when he left his porch, walked to
the corner of a little al'eyway near nis
house and gazed at the frroup of children
who were playing about a bonfire. Pres
ently he drew Ms hands from his pockets,
and then came a flash, followed by a
scampering of the children and the report
that Maggie was shot. The witness was
closely cross-questioned by counsel for do
fendant, but her strry as to Wilson's
movements remained Unshaken.
George Hartwell, a brother of the mur
oered girl, said that ha saw Wilson leave
his porch and fire the shot. Immediately
afterward his sister exclaimed that she
had been shot by Wilson, and she begged
to be taken home to ruv mother. Wilson
had been annoyed by some of the chil
the County Hospital last week and yes
terday he succumbed. His body Is in the i
Morgue here at present and will be
shipped to his relatives in Poland for in
terment.
The Baron Mandausch, or, as he was
better known in this city, the "Count,"
has been a character around the Fresno
saloons for' several years. His real name
was George Mandausch, and he was a
native of Beuthen, Oberschlen. Every
few months he received a remittance from
the old country and then would follow a
protracted spree, always ending with the
Baron on the verge of delirium tremens.
After the spree the Baron would work at
anything he could get to 'do, often going
to the lumber camps in the mountains
above Fresno and sometimes doing ranch
work. He would remain sober for several
weeks and then all of his earnings would
go the way of his remittances.
Little is known here of the Baron's
story. From what has been gathered,
however. It appears that he was a Polish
nobleman and at one time was high in the
politics of his native country. Because of
alleged intrigues against the Russian Gov
ernment he was exiled. He went to Bra
zil and became a soldier of fortune. He
was noted for his daring and attained the
rank of colonel in the. Brazilian army.
Theme he came to California.
In Fresno the Baron became known be
cause of his ability to talk upon almost
any subject, even when he was under the
influence of liquor. He was said by those
knowing him best to have been possessed
of many excellent qualities. A short time
before his death he confided to a friend
that his exile would end next year and
that he then expected to return to Poland.
He claimed to have a son now being edu
cated in Germany.

Thief Who Bobbed Santa Rosa's Tax
Collector Sends Back Part of
His Loot.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 26.â City Marshal
and Tax Collector Charles H. Holmes Jr.,
whose office was robbed c. few nights ag-o
of $1599 40. tax collections, to-day received
an envelope from San Francisco through
the mail containing between $300 and $400
in checks, part of the paper stolen. There
was nothing about th^ envelope to give a
clew to the identity of the person who
mailed it. The checks were those drawn
by local taxpayers in settlement of taxes,
and, of course, were useless to the rob
bers.
dren, who threw firecrackers on his
porch. In his testimony before the Po
lice Court young Hartwell made state
ments which did not asree to those made
by him subsequently. He explained that
"he was tangled up ir. the Police Coun,
and that he did not then know fully what
he was saying." Hartwell's testimony
implicated the defendant as the slayer of
his sister. >
Corporal Russell, a member of the polica
force, testified that he had taken a bullel
out of a fence near the Wilson residence
at the request of the attorneys for t"ne
defense. The bullet vas introduced in
evidence, subject to objection by Prose
cuting Attorney Greaney. It is expected
that the testimony for the prosecution
will be completed to-day.
TEAM AND BOAT
VERSUS RAILWAY
Redding May Have Com
petitive Freight
Line.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Nov. 26.â Redding may have
a competing freight line through to San
Francisco. It is proposed to bring car
goes hither by boats and teams at a cost
less -than that charged by the Southern
Pacific Company. Several local merchants
were interviewed on the project to-day.
Captain J. H. Roberts of the Sacra
mento Transportation Company is the
man who would establish the rival line.
He has just retired from the presidency
of the steamboat line and is succeeded by
Major J. P. Harney, ex-Harbor Commis
sioner. Roberts and Harney spent the
day in town quietly advocating their
proposition. They propose to put on a line
of teams from Red Bluff to Redding. Be
fore they left town Major Harney inti
mated that they had received encourage
ment enough to warrant their going
ahead. His company proposes to deliver
freight at the merchants' door at a re
duced rate.
Considerable freight now comes to Red
Bluff by water and then to Redding by
rail. The saving is small. The railroad
rate on general merchandise from San
Francisco is about 60 cents and fr<yn Sac
ramento about 50 cents per hundred. It
will require close figuring to cut under
these rates.
Captain Roberts once applied to the Te
hama County Supervisors for a franchise
to widen the roads to run a traction en
gine line to Redding and was refused.

ON THE NEWPORT
Steamship Has Tempes
tuous Voyage From
Alaska.
Runs Short of Coal and Is
Compelled to Use Wood
on the Trip.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSEND, Nov. 28.â After a
tempestuous voyage of thirty days the
steamship Newport arrived here this
morning from Alaska with her coal sup
ply exhausted. During a portion of the
trip she used wood, which was gathered
at various places along the route. The
Newport for some yeara has been carry
ing mail from Juneau to the west coast
of Alaska and Captain Moore reports that
the recent storm along the Alaskan coast
has been the most terrific during his ex
perience. The Newport met the mail
steamer Discovery 400 miles west of
Juneau, battling with the elements and
at that time the Discovery was five days
behind schedule time.
The rigors of the Alaskan winter are
driving people from the interior points to
the coast and the steamer Dolphin, arriv
ing this morning, brought 200 passengers.
Joseph J. Rogers, newly appointed
United States Gold Commissioner for
Skagway, was sworn in on November 21
by Judge Brown of the United States
Court at that place. ,
SEATTLE, Nov. 26.â The steamer Dol
phin came in this morning from the
north with 200 passengers, of whom sixty
were transferred from the disabled
steamer Farallon, which anchored in Car
denas Bay, near Kennedy Island, Alaska.
The Dolphin also brought the largest
cargo of fresh halibut ever reaching port
on any single vessel.
The Dolphin left Skagway on Novem
ber n. She reports that the Yukon River
froze over entirely on November 19.
Preparations were being made to put sleds
and horses ,of the overland transporta
tion companies in readiness for service, al
though it was expected that the trip, couid
not be made over the ice until about the
middle of the month.
Last Saturday the Dolphin reached the
vicinity of Cardenas Bay, where the help
less steamer Farallon was hove to. Sig
nals of distress from, the vessel attracted
the attention of the Dolphin's officers and
she stopped. It was found that the Faral
lon could not continue the voyage under
her own steam and her sixty passengers
went aboard the Dolphin, which brought
them to this, city. Afterward telegrams of
distress were sent to the Seattle office
from Vancouver and the tug Pioneer was
dispatched from Port Townsend. It is ex
pected that the tug and her tow will reach
port on Wednesday or Thursday.
The Farallon's officers say that the
trouble on their vessel was due to a de
fective propeller blade, whioh, while re
volving at a high rate of speed, became
detached from the hub, striking the stuff
ing box near the stern with terrible force.
The blow broke the stuffing box and pre
vented any further use of her motive
power.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â Mrs. R. A.
Brown, wife of a deputy in the county
Tax Collector's office, was killed tc-da-y.
supposedly by Inhaling the fumes from a
gasoline stove. Mrs. Brown was alone at
home at the time. Neighbors saw flames
in the kitchen, and on entering the house
found the body of the woman lying across
the gasoline stove, with all her clothing
afire. It is supposed that Mrs. Brown,
who had recently been ill, fainted after
inhaling the gas from the generator of
the stove and died from the effects of the
gas and the subsequent burns. She never
regained consciousness. Four children
survive the unfortunate woman.
Shooting Follows Quarrel.
BAKERSFIELJD, Nov. 26.â As the re
sult of a row over real estate on Union
avenue near the cemetery, G. Romerez
lies in a critical condition at the County
Hospital with a bullet imbedded in his
body, and Juan Forres, his assailant, is
locked up at the County Jail. The wound
ed man and Forres are neighbors. Angry
words followed a dispute as to who owned
the land on which Romerez had his house
and Forres drew a revolver from his
pocket and fired. The bullet struck Ro
mtrez on the arm and glanced, presuma
bly into the pleural cavity. It is feared
that there is but little chance for the
wounded man's recovery.

SMOKES AFTER
THE SHOOTING
Salt Lake Youth Tries
to Kill a Traveling
Man.
Officers Arrest Him While
He Is Puffing at a
i Cigarette.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 26.â William S.
Haynes, a traveling man from Chicago,
was shot and probably fatally wounde-i
to-day by Roy Kaighn, the 19-year-old
son of Colonel M. M. Kaighn, who is
prominent in law and Urand Army circles
of this city^
The shooting occurred in the lobby of
the Knutsford Hotej shortly after 1
o'clock this afternoon and created a pin
ie among the guests and employes of the
hotel. Young Kaighr. was immediately
placed under arrest und the wounded
man* was conveyed to a hospital. The
surgeons after a carcfu> examination of
the wound said there was a slight hope
for recovery.
After firing the shot Kaighn coolly
lighted a cigarette, sat down and waitad
for the officers to arrest him. He posi
tively refuses to give any reason for the
shooting.
Much mystery surrounds the whole af
fair. Haynes, the wounded man. acted as
best man for Colonel Kaighn at the lat
ter"s wedding several months ago, and 't
is thought that che trouble is associated
in some way with that event.

i THE OLD WAY
Of Treating -Stomach. Trouble . and
":Â¦ Indigestion, a Barbarous and f
Useless One.
We say the old way, but really it is the
common and usual i one at Â¦ the . present
time, and : many dyspeptics, and physi-
cians as well, consider the first step in
attempting to cure indigestion is to diet,
either by selecting certain food and re-
jecting others or vto greatly diminish the
quantity of food usually taken. 30, \ â¢
"'? In â¢â¢ other words, the starvation J plan .!s
by many supposed, to be the first essential
in the cure of weak digestion. "" v .-,â¢ 'â¢:* . /
>Â¦ The ; almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure .for stomach trouble has been, j
proven time and again, but still the usual
advice, when dyspepsia makes its appear-
ance, is a co.urse of dieting.
"' All this is radically wrong. It Is fool-
ish and unscientific to recommend diet-
ing or starvation to a person suffering j
from dyspepsia, because indigestion itself
starves every organ and every nerve and
fiber in the body.
What is needed ,is abundant nutrition,
not less, and this means plenty of good,
wholesome, well cooked food and some
natural digestive to assist the weak
stomach to digest it.
, This is exactly the purpose for which
Stuart's j Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted,
and this Is the way they cure the worst
cases of stomach trouble. 'Â¦-.' V
' The patient eats plenty of wholesome
food, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets di-
gests it for him. :
And this is in accordance with nature
and common sense because in this way
â¢ the whole system is nourished and the
overworked stomach rested, because the
tablets will digest the food, whether the
stomach works or not. One of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will . digest 1800 grains
of meat, eggs and similar food.
Any druggist will tell you that Stuart's
Dyspepsia ' Tablets is a remedy of ex-
traordinary value and probably is the
purest â¢ and ' safest remedy for stomach
troubles. _ ' ... "
No person suffering from poor digestion
and lack of appetite can fail to be Im-
mediately and permanently benefited If
they would make it a practice to take
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each meal.

Lover Is Slain as He Endeav

a Cab.
PARIS, Nov. 26.â A tragedy character
istically Parisian was committed in the
heart of Paris to-day. At the corner of
the Boulevard dcs Capucins and the
Place de I' Opera, a husband shot his
faithless wife and her lover in full view
\ hundreds of people.
The opera square was filled with
promenaders at lunch time when a cab
drove across the square, followed by a
man running. A policeman, regulating
the traffic, stopped the cab in front of the
Cafe de la Baix, enabling the pursuer to
ko it, when the man drew a re
volver, thrust it through a window of the
vehicle and fired twice, killing the woman
who was inside.
The man in the cab. the lover, opened
the other door and tried to escape, but the
husband sprang after him and blew his
.brains out before the spectators could in
terfere. Then the husband approached
the policeman, handed him the weapon
and surrendered. All the actors to the
drama belonged to the working class.

in our own workshops, and is sold to the customer at ; but- one fair profit, which

CANADA FAILS
IN OBLIGATIONS
Secretary Wilson Talks
to the Cabinet About
Cattle.
President's Message Is Read
and the Verbiage Is
Altered.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â The time of
the Cabinet meeting to-day was largely
devoted to again going over the Presi
dent's message. Some changes were made
in the verbiage, but they were not im
portant.
Secretary Wilson talked to the Cabinet
for a short time about what he regards
as the failure of Canada to keep an agree
ment with the United States as to the
bringing of cattle to Canada and this
country from Great Britain, Scotland and
Ireland.
This agreement, made a number of years
ago, provides that an American and a
Canadian inspector of cattle should be
kept in Great Britain to inspect cattle
coming to Canada, destined either for
Canada or the United States. This was
to guard against cattle getting disease
into this country.
The information Secretary Wilson has is
that the Canadians have withdrawn their
inspector and permit the inspection to be
mafic by a citizen of Gfeat Britain, who
may be competent in , his knowledge of
cattle, but who would not have the same
interest as a Canadian in the examina
tion.
Ito May Go to Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 26.â The im
pression prevails here that the real ob
jective point of the Marquis Ito wheo he
left Japan was St. Petersburg. It is be
lieved that Japan is more disposed to
cultivate Russian friendship, or at least
seek an understanding with Russia, since
it became apparent r.'iat Great Brita'n
was unable or not disposed to suppjrt
Japan if the latter intended to oppose
Russian projects.
BERLIN. Nov. 26.â The increase of 91,000,000
marks in Government securities shown by the
statement of the Reichsbank is explained by
the assertion that this increase is caused by
the bank making advances to the imperial
treasury upon treasury notes against the loan
which was floated January 13 this year.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1901.
HIGHEST BIDDER
GETS THE ABBEY
Historic Estate in Eng
land Is Sold at an
Auction.
Name of the Purchaser of
the Property Is Not
Announced.
LONDON, Nov. 26.â The celebrated
Battle Abbey and the estate of 6000 acres
surrounding it were sold at public auc
tion to-day for Â£200,000.. A real estate
agent was the successful bidder, but he
refused to give out his client's name. All
that could be learned was that the buyer
was not an American and it does not ap
pear that any American was represented
at the sale.
The Duke of Norfolk and Lord Rose
bery have been mentioned as possible
purchasers of the property, which Can
tain Forester, grandson of the late Duke
of Cleveland, inherited, but declined to
keep.
Several hundred persons attended th<Â»
auction. The bidding started at Â£50,000
and went up by tens of thousands until
Â£190,000 was recorded. Then amid intense
excitement the bidding proceeded in thou
sands until the sale price was reached.
Among the bidders who dropped out in
the last stages of the auction was Sir
John B. Blake, the former Mayor of
A rumor is abroad that William "Wal
dorf Astor has secured the property.
Overdue Ship Roanoke Spoken.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â A cablegram
received to-day from London says that
the overdue ship Roanoke, Captain Ames
bury, from Norfolk June 12 for San Fran
cisco, was spoken September 25 in lati
tude 54 degrees south. longitude 79 degrees
west. The Roanoke is laden with coal for
the Mare Island Navy Yard. At one time
her reinsurance was quoted at 30 per cent,
after a report had been made that she
had been sighted on fire. The location
given in to-day's cablegram shows that
the ship had just rounded Cape Horn.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â John T. Hayden,
formerly treasurer of the Swift Beef Company,
who it is alleged absconded in July last with
several thousand dollars belonging to his em
ployers, was arrested to-day at Wilmington,
Del.
MILITIA MUST
BE REORGANIZED
Secretary of War Recom
mends a Number 01
Changes.
Generals Merritt, Brooke and
Otis May Soon Be
Honored.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â Elihu Root.
Secretary of War, to-day submitted to the
President his annual report of the opeia
' tions of his department. Speaking of thg
j mustering out of the volunteers at San
' Francisco in the first six months of l'JOl
: the Secretary says:
i Special care was taken to secure full de
scriptive lists and a thorough medical exam-
I ination with a view to aid in the settlement of
; future applications for pensions. The command
ing general of the department reported that the
muster-out was quiet, orderly and without In
cident. Ninety-seven per cent of the men mus
tered out proceeded without delay to their re
| spectlve homes.
The Secretary says regarding the army
[ canteen:
i The provisions of section 38 of the act of
February 2, 1901, prohibiting the sale of or deal
ing in beer, wine or any intoxicating liquors by
any person in any post exchange, or canteen,
or army transport, or upon any premises used
for military purposes by the United States,
have been carried into full force and effect,
pursuant to the directions of the statute. When
! the orders were issued for the enforcement of
this section of the law the commanding offi
cers of the various posts and military organi-
I zations were directed to report upon its effects.
! A great body of reports have been received,
which indicate that the effect of the law is un
fortunate. I think, however, that a sufficient
time has not elapsed to give the law a fair
trial, . and the observation and report of its
working will be continued during the ensuing
>ear.
The reports show that the food and clothing
furnished to the army during the year have
been satisfactory; that the health of our troops
has been good and the death rate low. The
death rate per thousand of troops in the United
States during the past yeac was 10.14; in Cuba,
9.72; in Porto Rico, 7.90, and among the troops
I serving in the Philippines and China it was re
duced from 19.31 during the previous year to
16.76 during the past year.
Transport Service Defective.
The ocean transport service has continued to
be inadequate and inefficient. The return of
: the volunteer force from the Philippines in the
; limited period allowed between the time when
they were required for active operations in the
early part of ISOI and the 30th of June in that
year was accomplished without accident, confu
sion or delay and was a very creditable per
formance.
Notwithstanding the faithful and zealous
service of the otilcers of the quartermaster's
department in charge of Government transpor
tation I became satisfied that with the reduc
tion of forces and consequent reduction of busi
ness in Cuba and Porto Rico the business could
be done more economically by commercial lines
and the department was not justified in longer
maintaining a separate transport fleet on the
Atlantic. The Atlantic transport service was
accordingly discontinued on the 30th of June
last.
It is not practicable now to discontinue the
transport service upon the Pacific, but I do
not think It desirable that the United States
should own and operate a fleet of passenger
and freight vessels in time of peace. It would
be gratifying if the American merchant marine
could furnish vessels to transport our men
and supplies as part of a regular commerce
between the United States and the Philippines
under contracts which would enable the Gov
ernment, in case of war, to put the vessels
under the control of regular officers of the army
or navy for transport purposes, upon reason
able compensation. It is desirable that author
ity be given by Congress to make such con
tracts in case opportunities for such an ar
rangement should be afforded in the future.
Most of our transports were boueht from
j foreign owners and upon being sold would
- necessarily come again under a foreign flag.
It will make a great difference in the prices
which can be obtained if an American register
.can be granted to these ships. I ask that this
be authorized by Congress. There would seem
-to be no objection on any public srround to
granting an American register to a ship which
has been for years flying the American flag
as a public vessel of the United States and
the money value of the privilege will go
into the public treasury.
Reorganization of Militia.
Of the militia ls,ws the report says:
The present provisions of law relating to the
militia and the raising of volunteer forces are
quite imperfect and unsatisfactory. The mili
tia law stands to-day practically as it was
enacted in 1792, and i 3 practically obsolete. It
is very desirable that Congress should now ex
ercise the r-ower conferred upon it by the con
stitution to provide for organizing, arming and
disciplining the mititia. The organization and
armament of the National Guards of the sev
eral States, which are treated as militia in the
appropriations made by Congress, should be
made the same as those provided by Congress
for the regular and volunteer forces. The re
lations of the National Guard organizations to
the national forces and the obligations and du
ties of those organizations in time of war
should be clearly defined, so that the confusion
and distress regarding their action which ac
companied the outbreak of the war with Spain
may not again occur.
The reliance of the country for the large
forces necessary in modern warfare must nec
essarily be chiefly upon volunteers. The method
and procedure of raising volunteer forces should
be prescribed in advance, so that instead of
waiting to devise plans for a volunteer army
until the excitement and haste of impending
war make perfection of design difficult and
satisfactory execution impossible. Congress will
have but to direct the execution of a well un
derstood plan by officers, each one of whom
has long been familiar with the part he is to
play. It is desirable that any plans adopted
should provide for utilizing, in the earlier vol
unteer organizations called out, the training of
those citizens who shall have served already in
the regular and volunteer forces. If the earlier
volunteer organizations can be constituted of
these trained men, much valuable time and
expense can be saved, and many dangers may
be averted during the period while the ordinary
volunteers are receiving the necessary training.
Provision should also be made for the selection
in advance of the officers of any volunteer force
which may be raised. Careful selection is im
possible at the outbreak of a war. It is en
tirely practicable in time of peace.
I recommend that the President be authorized
to convene boards of officers (including the
general service and staff college board) for the
examination of officers of the National Guard
and other citizens who may apply to be ex
amined, as to their qualifications to hold vol
unteer commissions; that the persons passing
such examinations shall receive certificates,
stating the office for which they are found to
be qualified, and upon the calling out of a
volunteer force shall be entitled to receive com
missions for such offices.
Arming of Guardsmen.
I recommend that the War Department be
authorized to arm the National Guard with the
present service small arms used by the rezu
lar army, navy and marine corps; that the
National Guard of the several States be treated
as a first reserve, to be called Into the ser
vice of the United States to execute the laws
of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel
invasions, the term of service under any call
to be limited to nine months; that the Presi
dent be authorized, on the request of the Gov
ernor of any State, to detail officers of the
regular army for Instruction, staff and inspec
tion duties with the National Guard of such
State; that the War Department be authorized
to furnish transportation, rations and tentage
to officers and men of the National Guard or
ganizations who shall take part with the
force of the regular army in annual encamp
ment and maneuvers at national military
camps; that the department be authorized to
allow travel pay. commutation of rations and
quarters, or commutation of quarters, to offi
cers of the NaHwial Guard attending and reg
ularly taking part in the courses of instruction
at the general service and staff college at Fort
Leavenworth. Both of these provisions shall
be within reasonable limits, proportional to the
numbers of National Guard organizations in
the several States.
I recommend that the President be now
empowered to organize the volunteer forces
whenever, called out, in the manner provided
for by the act of March 2, 1899. for the organi
sation of the volunteer force which has recent
ly returned from the Philippines, with such
modifications as shall ba necessary to give ef
fect to the views above expressed.
The chief of the signal corps again urges at
tention to the great Importance of an Ameri
can trans-Pacific cable. The requirements for
the use of such a cable by our own Govern
ment in Hawaii and in the Philippine Islands
are so great that either it should be construct
ed and owned by the Government, or if con
structed by a private corporation the landing
rights should be granted upon such conditions
that the owners shall always remain in fact
an American corporation, and shall -be sub
ject to such control and reerulation by Con
gress as will insure Government control when
, necessary, and commercial freedom in the use
j of the cable at all times.
The Secretary says that as veterans
of the Civil War who remain In the navy
| are permitted to retire at a grade higher
I than they have reached in the active list,
! he asks that similar provision be mad?
j for the veterans in the army.
The Secretary says Major General Wco

Brooke and Major General Elwell S. Oti3

FIRST INFORMS
THE BOARDER
Conduct of Mrs. Bonine
After Tragedy Is
Described.
Woman on Trial for Murder
Makes a Private Con
fession.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â The fact was
brought out to-day in the trial of Mrs.
Bonine for the killing of James S. Ayers
Jr. that she had madf> a private confes
sion of . her part in the tragedy on the
evening after the honucideâ several days
before she took the police officials into
her confidence. This recital was made to
George B. Gardner, an attorney employed
in the law department of the Interior De
partment, who was a boarder at the Ken
more Hotel and usually sat at the same
table at which Mrs. Bonine took her
meals.
Gardner was on the witness stand to
day and told his story for the first time.
He said that Mrs. Bomne had sought him
out and asked his advice as to whether
she should make a public statement, and
that he suggested to her that she should
delay her confession until the theory of
suicide, which was first entertained,
should be fully exploited.
.A number of other witnesses were heard
during the day, several of / them being
men who had taken Ayers to neighboring
saloons during the evening of May 14, and
one of whom had taken him to his room
after midnight, about two hours before
he met his death. The witness who took
Ayers to his room was a young man
named Burns, who stnted that when he
left Ayers the latter was perfectly sober.
These witnesses generally said that
Ayers had taken about two glasses of
beer and that he was not under the influ
ence of liquor. Burns said that on one
occasion he had seen Ayers treat Mrs
Bonine contemptuously. He said she had
nursed him (Burns) wnen sick, and bad
visited his room, botb day and night.
Other witnesses also testified that Mrs
Bonine had visited them when sick. Gard
ner's statement was us follows:
"Mrs. Bonine stated to me that she
knew more about the death of -Ayers than
had been given to the public. I think she
hesitated a moment at my manner or
something I said. I induced her to go on,
and she said she was present when it
happened, and told me that she had come
to me because she wanted my advice. She
told me that on the morning of Ayers'
death he came to her room and knocked
on her door and comoiained of being ill,
and asked If she could not do something
for him; that when she got into Ayers'
room he had assaulted her and had a pis
tol In his hand, and in the scuffle which
ensued he was killed.
"She said that she was feeling badly,
and that nothing was sustaining her ex
cept the consciousness of her innocence.
She added that she could not get it out,
and asked me if she had better destroy it.
By 'it' I understood her to mean that sha
referred to one of her garments, but I did
not know what. I told her to destroy
nothing, as she had not decided upon a
public confession."
TWENTY-SIX MEN MEET AWFUL FATE
Continued From Page One.
ging for their comrades who were buried
deeper. Flames broke out almost imme
diately and the horror of fire was added
to the sufferings of the imprisoned ones.
Resellers Fight the Fire.
Almost immediately after the fire alarm
was turned in calls were sent out for all.
the ambulances in the city and they were
hurried to the scene. Pending their ar
rival, neighboring houses were turned into
temporary hospitals and those physicians
who were in the vicinity eased the suffer
ing ones as much as they were able. .The
first ambulances on the scene were total
ly inadequate to carry those who had al
ready been extricated and express wagons
and similar vehicles were pressed into ser
vice.
As soon as the gravity of the accident
was realized calls for additional firemen
were sent in and the apparatus came fly
ing to the scene from all parts of the
city While part of the firemen directed
their efforts against the fire, which was
burning in the center of the ruins, the
greater number of them seized axes and
crowbars and began prying out the vic
tims who could be seen or whose faint
crie3 were audible.
The department of public works imme
diately sent all its available men and
horses to the scene.
In a comparatively short time all the
laborers who were able to work to advan
tage were hurriedly set to pulling the
debris out on Brooklyn avenue, where
it was loaded into wagons and carried
off.
Victims Burned to Death.
The floors and roof had fallen at an
angle and formed a sort of huge cover
under which the fire burned fiercely. Not
until the firemen had chopped through
this did their streams begin to have any
apparent effect on the flames. The suf
ferings of those who were buried beneath
were lately mutely testified to by their
charred and blackened bodies.
Gradually the rescuers worked their
way downward through the pile. By this
time there were no cries or groans to aid
them, for the flames had destroyed those
unfortunates who were not killed by the
explosion or the fall. But the work of
rescue continued. When a heavy beam or
piece of shafting was encountered horses
were driven in and the piece of wreckage
hauled to the street. Stretcher-bearers
stood beside the workers and bore away
the burned and blackened bodies. A va
cant house adjoining the factory was con
verted into a temporary morgue, where
the bodies were placed in coffins and
taken to the nearest Morgue. In several
cases the charred corpses were so hot
when recovered that they could scarcely
be handled by the undertakers and assist
ants. ,
Panic Among the Girls.
The hospitals were besieged by relatives
and friends of the injured men. An emer
gency hospital, which was only a short
distance from the scene and where many
of the injured were carried In wagons,
was crowded to overflowing, the floors of
the reception rooms and even the halls
being used as a temporary resting place
for the victims. Physicians were hastily
summoned and the work of relief expe
dited. Similar scenes were enacted at
Grace and Harper hospitals.
A number of girls were among the em
ployes on the four floors of the front of
the building and there was a panic among
them, but none of them was injured.
The property loss, according to Secre
tary George W. Childs, is about $180,000.
Nothing is known as yet about the cause
of the explosion. The boilers had been re
cently inspected, and the engineer was
known as a careful and capable man.
Censure for Mine Officials.
TELLURIDS, Colo., Nov. 26.â The Cor

Mrs. H. N. WheÂ«ler. of 117 High Rock rt.,
Lynn. Mass., writes on Nov. 2, 1900: "About It
months ago I had a very severe spell of sick-
ness. I was extremely sick for three weeks,
and when I finally was able to leave my bed
I was left with excrutiating pains in my back.
My water at times looked very like coffee. 1
could pass but little at a time, and then only
after suffering great pain. My physical condi-
tion was such that I had no strength and was
all run down. The doctors said my kidney*
were not affected, and while I
Did Not Know I Had
Kidney Trouble,
I somehow felt certain my kidneys were thÂ«
cause of my trouble. My sister. Mrs. C. B. Lit-
tlefleld of Lynn, advised me to give Dr. Kll-
mÂ»r's Swamp-Root a trial. I procured a bot-
tle and inside of three days commenced to get
relief I followed up that bottle with another,
and at the completion of this one found I was
completely cured. My strength returned, and
to-day I am as well as ever. My business is that
of canvasser, I am on my feet a great deal
of the time, and have to use much energy in
getting around. My cure is, therefore, all the
more remarkable, and is exceedingly gratify-
ing to me." MRg H WHEELER .

STRIKE HURTS
ONE RAILROAD
Switchmen at Pittsburg
Unable to Enlist
Sympathy.
New Men Obtain Places Va
cated by the Union
Members.
PITTSBURG, Nov. 26.â Judging by ap
parent conditions, the switchmen's strike
begun this morning has proved a failure.
The strike was ordered by the Switch
men's UnkÂ» of North America, and the
claim was made early in the day by the
union officers that every road in the city,
with the exception of the Pittsburg, Fort
Wayne & Chicago and the Pittsburg, Cin
cinnati, Chicago & St. Louis, would be
tied up completely.
The developments of the day, however,
demonstrate that only one road; the Lie
high Valley, was seriously affected. On
this road but one crew was at work and
the road is badly crippled. The company
officials, while admitting that Ireigtt traf
fic has been practically sunendtd. Â»ay that
within twenty-four hours thay will have
all the men they need and work will be
resumed as usual.
The other roads affected were the Balti
more and Ohio, twenty-five men out; the
Pittsburg and Lake Erie, four men out; the
Pennsylvania, fifteen men out. . One hun
dred and fifty would be a high estimate
of the total men who struck. None of
these roads suffered much inconvenience,
because new men were readily secured to
take the places of the strikers, and some
of the men, upon discovering that the
strike order had not been generally
obeyed, returned to their places.
A meeting of the union was held this
afternoon and the claim was made that
the strike was a success as far as it had
gone, and that within forty-eight hours
the members of the union, about 700,
would be out. The demands of the switch
men call for the enforcement of the
standard scale of wages.
It is claimed that the Monongahela con
necting lines signed the scale to-day, but
the officials of the other roads say they
are more determined than ever not to
sign. The strikers have not the sympathy
of the other trainmen's unions. W. G. Lee,
first vice grand master of the Brother
hood of Trainmen, is in the city, and says
the members of his organization will op
pose the present movement.
Should the condition in the Allegheny
Valley, as it existed to-day, be continued
longer than two days more, the mills and
factories along the Allegheny River de
pendent on it for raw material will be
compelled to close.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â John W.
Mackay, president v of the Postal Tele

nized Pacific Cable Company, will be here
to-morrow for a week's stay. While hero
he will look at available cable landings
and listen to any proposition that may be
advanced for bringing the Pacific cable
ashore here. The cab'.e company has
succeeded in getting land grants and tne
necessary' concessions in Hawaii, Guam
and Luzon for the cable, and the landing
place on the Pacific Coast is all that re
mains to be fixed.
The line of surrey frrnn San Francisco
to Honolulu and that from Los Angeles
form two sides of a triangle, with the
long side on the line of the northern sur
vey. The. saving in oxpense by running
the cable from Los Angeles would be
nearly $60,000.
Secretary Zeehandelaar of the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Association
said to-day:
"If the site for the station has not al
ready been selected we will make a de
termined effort to have the company
bring the cable to Los Angeles. Tne
necessary land can be had at a moment's
notice, and there are two or three good
places for the shoring of the submarine
telegraph line.''
General Manager Storrer was busy to
day getting data for President Mackay,

his investigations.

KISS SMALLEY SETTLES
WITH MURPHY ESTATE
Woman Who Sued for Services p.s
Nurse Accepts Small Sum
in Gold Coin.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 26.â Miss Bertha Smai
ley, for three years the sole companion of
the late capitalist James T. Murphy and
who sued his estate for $24,000 for ser
vices as nurse, has compromised with the
Union Trust Company, the trustee of the
estate. This afternoon Miss Smalley was
paid $1500 in gold in court. Her attorney
gave a receipt in full and dismissed the
case.
The suit of Miss Smalley, in which a
non-suit was given the estate a short
time ago, was sensational. An appeal was
pending. Miss gmalley. who is a niece of
"Lucky" Baldwin, had lived with Mur
phy for three years. She claimed that
Murphy, who was divorced from his wife,
had promised to marry her, and also had
declared that he intended to leave her a
good share of his property. When his
will was opened it was found, she had
been ignored., and the estate given to
nephews and nieces. Then Miss Smalley
brought suit for services as a nurse for
three years.
Murphy was a member of the well
known family of that name and a brother
of Bank Commissioner B. D. Murphy.

M'GOVERN READY

Feather- Weights Meet
To-Morrow Night at
Hartford.'
The Champion Rules Strong
Favorite Over the Den
ver Boxer.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â After eight days'
training for his battle with "Young Cor
bett" of Denver Thursday night at Hart
ford, Terry McGovern took a ten-mile run
in the vicinity of Jerome Park this after
noon. Despite the fact that it was freez
ing cold, with a strong wind blowing, he
covered the distance in ninety minutes.
When he reached his training quarters
he was examined by a physician, who de
clared the little champion in perfect trim
for the coming contest.
Several persons have informed him that
in "Young Corbett" he will meet the
toughest and most rugged opponent of
his ring career. He replied to several
questions as to how he felt:
"I nev^r felt .better in my. .life, and
while I have taken no chances and have
worked into the best condition I feel con,
fident of the result. They tell me Cor^
bett is a two-handed, swift, rushing fight
er of my own style, and I hope he is, for
then neither he nor I will have any ex
cuses to make when the end comes."
McGovern tipped the scales at 122
pounds to-day. With a road run to-mor
row he will finish his training and break
camp, leaving for Hartford to-morrow
afternoon. He expects to reach the ring
side weighing not more than 124 pounds.
Among the sporting men here very little
betting. is being done. McGovern back
ers are offering bets of 2 to 1 on their
man, with few takers. Among the sport
ing resortÃ on upper Broadway some of
the sports are making what they call
gambling bets on the result, taking odls
of 5 to 2, but the prevailing price is 2 to 1
on McGovern.
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 26.â "Young
Corbett," who has been working faith
fully four weeks to prepare for his bout
with Terry McGovern, put the finishing
touches to his training this afternoon be
hind cloÃed doors. Large crowds have
watched his daily practice and somewhat
handicapped him. He requested to-day
that all be excluded except his trainers.
He boxed several hard rounds with Char
ley Sieger and went through his usual
practice, which was preceded by an eight
mile run on the road. A physician again
examined Corbett to-night and pro
nounced him to be in fine condition. To
morrow he will take light exercise.

to knock out his man at any time, though
it was confidently predicted that he would
do so.

FIRST DEAD HEAT OF THE SEASON
BETWEEN DIDEROT AND DUNBLANE
Spencer, on Sugden, Wins a Race After Being Nearly Left at the
Postâ Favorites Divide Honors With Outsiders at Oakland.
Herculean Once More Fails to Get Away From the Barrier
NOTHING but a plain, everyday
card, one that bore all the ear
marks of one hard to beat, was
offered visitors tc Oakland track'
yesterday, but, notwithstanding,
it attracted a fair attendance. There was
nothing bordering on the miraculous to
chronicle. Probably tot dead heat finish
between Diderot and Dunblane at the
conclusion of the third event was the
most noteworthy occurrence. Diderot in
the betting ruled a 7 '.o 10 favorite, and
the first part of the race was clearly out
footed. Later on, though, while Ransom
astride Forkford was busily engaged
bumping and otherwise caressing O'Con
nor on Dunblane, Woods moved up sev
eral holes with the first choice. Forkford
drew out of the play not far from the
wire, and the judges de-: lared a dead heat
between Dunblane and Diderot. For his
plainly apparent rough riding tactics
Ransom was fined $50 by the officials in
the stand.
The track was heavy and almost hold
ing enough in places to pull the platea
from the feet of the equine racers. Her
culean, a 4 to 5 favorite, was again unfor
tunate in getting left at the post. St.
Sever and Mocorito, two other prominent
choices, proved disappointments.
By actual computation Sugden, favorite
for the first number, a seven-furlong sell
ing affair, must have been at least an
hour and fifteen minutes the better hors-i.
Spencer, who had the mount, was practi
cally left at the post, but caught the
bunch before three furlongs had been cov
ered and won almost easing up. Canejo
led Rlnaldo out for the place.
Seven two-year-olds started in the five
furlong sprint following 1 , and it looked an
open betting proposition. Â¦ Louwelsea
showed a trace of her old form, and with
Bullman in the saddle downed the favor
ite, St. Sever, with little to spare. The
winner closed at odds ot- 7 to 1.
Undoubtedly the smartest betting race
of the day was the mile and 100 yard run,
with Sea Lion, Horton, Goldone and Wyo
ming ac starters. Each of the quartet re
ceived more or less support, and at post
time there was no pronounced choice.
The going though suited Sea' Lion, and
after leading throughout he fairly barked
in two lengths before Horton. A dozen
lengths back Goldone disposed of Gaylon
Brown's old horse for tne show.
With Herculean again on his bad beha
vior and left at the post. Imperious had
nothing to beat for the mile and a six
teenth purse. At odds of 4 to 1, Birken
ruth had him in front from the start, win
ning but half-easy from Bob Palmer.
Spencer scored his second win of the
afternoon with Hohenlohe in the closing
seven-furlong jaunt. Mocorito, the favor
ite, died away to notning after a spell of
it out in the lead, and the Elmwood farm
horse then downed First Shot two lengths
ridden out.
Track Notes.
Gill Summers is again the owner of
Herculean. After the big chestnut was
claimed from a race on Monday by H. C.
Ahlers, Gill paid an advance on the price
and retained his horse.
Birkenruth and Spencer ' divided the
saddle honors, each piloting a pair of
winners.
Henry Shields, the well-known rider, ar
rived from New York on last evening's

COPYISTS MAKE
GRAVE CHARGES
Say They Were Removed
for Refusing to Pay
Assessments.
Mark Bartlett and Frank H. Urmy, for
merly copyists under Recorder Gqdchaux,
filed affidavits with the Civil ' Service
Commission yesterday alleging that they
were dismissed from their positions be
cause they refused to contribute $50 each
to Godchaux's campaign fund at the last
election.
Both men were appointed in April, 1900,
from the civil service eligible list of copy
ists. Urmy was discharged on the 9th
inst. and Bartlett lost his official head
yesterday morning. In his affidavit Bart
lett alleges that he was compelled to
contribute $1 each month to a charity
fund in the office and $2 50 monthly to pay
a messenger who was not provided for by
the Board of Supervisors. He also con
tributed $5 to pay the fees of an attor
ney to defend four copyists who were ap
pointed, but not from the civil service
list, after the Superior Court decided that
the Recorder's office was exempt from
civil service.
Bartlett further alleges that he was as
sessed $12 50 to pay the salary of a copy
ist, W. H. Garnett, whose demand was
held up. Bartlett swears that he saw a
copyist named Fleischman pay an install
ment of $12 50 on the campaign assess
ment.
Bartlett says he sent a communication
on Monday to Godchaux requesting the
return of $22 50 which he had contributed
to the various funds. Frank Urmy in his
affidavit corroborates the statements made
by Bartlett.
Recorder Godchaux says he knew noth
ing; of any campaign assessments being
collected among his men. So far as the
contributions for charity are concerned,
Godchaux says it was a voluntary matter
of the employes. This was also the case
with the other contributions.
The Civil Service Commission decided to
refer the complaints to Mayor Phelan,
with a recommendation that he exercise
the power conferred on him by the char
ter to remove municipal officers. The
charter provides:
"Any officer of the city and county who
shall, while in office, accept any dona
tion or gratuity in money or other valu
able thing either directly or indirectly
from any subordinate or employe or Trom
any candidate or applicant for any posi
tion as employe or subordinate under him
shall forfeit his office and be forever de
barred and disqualified from holding any
position in the service of the city and
county."
The Civil Service Commission will con
tinue the investigation of air the offices
and report its findings to the Mayor.

PAY BRIEF VISIT
TO PHILIPPINES
Congressman Games and
Party Return on the
Steamer Doric.
The Congressional party that visited the
Philippine Islands on a tour of investiga
tion returned here yesterday. The mem
bers, with the exception of Congressman
John W. Games of Tennessee, left last
evening for the East.
Congressman Games in an interview
said: "We left New York for the islands
July 10, and left Manila on our return on
the' transport Sherman October 16. "Wa
struck a rock off Moji, and after making
Yokohama took the Doric. I do not wish
to express an opinion on the question of
the Filipinos being capable of self-gov
ernment until after I read the civil and
military reports that are now on the
way to Washington. There are many in
telligent and educated Filipinos. They
were soldiers in the insurgent army, and
most of them are now holding high offi
cial positions under the civil government.
The military men are opposed to the civil
government, saying that it has been In
augurated too soon.
"Governor Taft is the right man in the
right place, and he is doing the very best
he can under the existing circumstances.
General Luke Wright is his able assist
ant. Slavery still exists in Jolo and I
called the attention of the military au
thorities to it. Slavery also exists in the
Hawaiian Islands, and we may expect
trouble from both quarters.
"The island of Palawoan. which was
recently bought by an American syndi
cate of which Prince Poniatowski is the
head, will also cause trouble for the
United States authorities in the near fu
ture."

HALF OF AN ESTATE EATEN
TJP BY FEES OF LAWTEB3
lirus Erickaen's Relatives Will Re
ceive Small Amount if All
Claims Are Allowed.
Out of an estate valued at $9696, left by
Lams Ericksen, who died at theCoso House
in December. 1900, hi 3 two brothers
and a half sister, who live in Germany,
will receive about $5000. The balance will
go to Attorney Martin Stevens, Public Ad
ministrator Boland and Attorney M
Hassett if their claims are allowed.
At the time of Krioksen's death MlsÂ«
Annie Armstrong, a seamstress, living aC â¢
the Coso House, presented a will in which
she was named as Ericksen's heir
Judge Troutt appointed Martin Stevens
attorney for the absent heirs and a con
test followed, the will being refused pro
bate. The estate was then turned over to>
the Public Administrator, who for hia
labor now claims $5Q4 87. while M. C. Has
sett, his attorney, asks to be allowed a
similar sum for advising Boland. Stevens
claims 11500 is a reasonable fee for his ser
vices.
The applications for these exorbitant
fees were filed in the office of the County-
Clerk on the 16th inst.. when the petition,
for distribution was presented. The papers
came to light only yesterday, however,
when Judge Troutt agreed to hear the pe
titions and pass on the claims to-day
CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACYâ William
Johnson was arrested for burglary yesterday
afternoon by Officer C. D. Staples on complaint
of William Cox, who pointed him out as the

Among- the passengers were Congress
men Mercer. Jack, Games and Green.
These gentlemen have been to the Phil
ippines and will report on the condition
of affairs there at the next meeting of
CongrreFP. They were on the Sheridan
when she got into trouble and were later
transferred to the Warren. "When that
vessel went ashore they thought the end
jof the world had come. Congressman
1 Mercer said:
The 'Warren was in charge of the pilot when
the accident happened and had It not been for
the presence of mind of Captain Baxneson I
don't know where we could have landed. As it
was the transport struck with a' force that
brought us ali up standing.
A Japanese Fteamship was making the pas
sage through the Inland Sea at the same time
we were. She kept crowding us and in spite of
danger signals and all kinds of blasts took no
notice, but held on Its way. Finally it came to
a quest'on cf going ashore or going full speed
ahead and making & rush to get through. Then
the captain took charjre of the ship and, accept
ing the chances, made a rush to get off lee
shore. He succeeded, but ahe vessel struck a
submerged rock and had a small hole knocked,
in the hull, besides having several plates loos
ened. The pilot wanted to take her to the
nearest port, but Captain Barneson knew his
ship and carried -her to Kobe, where repairs
could be made. The pumps were kept going
during the run, but at no time was there any
danger.
There was no trouble at all In the navigation
of the "Warren and I think both 'master and
pilot were blameless. Furthermore I think Cap
tain Barneson acted like a skilled seaman and I
don't think anybody in our merchant marine
wantF anything better than that said about
him. It was an unavoidable accident, due to the
crowding of the Japanese steamer, but never
theless we had a lucky escape.
Congressmen Weeks of Michigan and
De Armand of Missouri did not come
home on the Doric, but will arrive here
on the transport Hancock next week.
Charles Blydner. a stowaway, is caus
ing the captain of the Doric a lot of trou
ble. He managed to get aboard the ves
sel at Honolulu. The vessel being a for
eign bottom cannot carry passengers be
tween American ports. Blydner is classed
as a rjasseneer and the steamship com
pany will either have to pay a $200 fine
in order to land him or else carry the
unfortunate fellow back to Hawaii. 'Blyd
ner says he has wealthy relatives in the
States, but the officers of the steamship
take his story with a grain of salt.
The Doric brings up the remains of J.
W. McWilliams, who died in Japan. Ho
was the father of Fred J. McWilliams,
president of the Siebe Shoe Company.
WTLL RTJN TO SIUSLAW.
The new three-masted schooner C. A.

WITTMAN'S GOOD WORK.
CHIEF OF POLICE WITTMAN has begun
his career in his new office by taking ener
getic steps toward the suppression of pool
seliing. In doing so he has naturally aroused the an
tagonism of those who profit by gambling and also of
the yellow journal. He therefore merits and should
have the cordial support of all good citizens.
Concerning the attacks of the yellow journal little
need be said. That paper began by charging the
Chief with a neglect to suppress gambling, and now
that he is engaged in an effort to suppress it the
paper assails him more vigorously than ever. Fortu
nately, as the Chief has nothing to expect from the
favor of that paper, neither has he anything to fear.
Good men understand the situation, and bad men
would be opposed to any officer who sought to put
an end to their vicious practices.
It is well known that a good deal of pool-selling
is carried on secretly under the mask of cigar-selling.
To discover these secret offenders and to prevent
them from violating the law it has been found neces
sary to exercise a police supervision over the cigar
trade generally. The supervision is of course more or
less annoying to legitimate dealers, but they can well
afford to bear the slight annoyance for a time for the
sake of benefits which will accrue from it. For a long
time the legitimate trade has suffered from the com
petition of men who maintain cigar stands and shops
only as a mask for selling pools. As their profits
were derived from pool-selling they were able to
draw away much of the trade that should have gone
to honest and bona-fide dealers. The suppression of
the illegitimate branches of the trade will therefore
tend tp promote the welfare of the honest business.
While the supporters of gambling and pool-selling
are in many respects contemptible, it must not be
overlooked that they constitute a considerable force
in the community. Many a poor dupe who wastes in
pool-buying the earnings of his labor will still side
with the rascals who rob him rather than with the
law that seeks to save him. In order that the per
nicious influence of the sharpers and their dupes may
be counteracted the lesolute strength of rightful pub
lic opinion should be exerted. Chief Wittman should
not be left to make this fight alone. Every man who
respects law and morality, who knows anything of
the evils that flow Irom pool-selling, should stand
with the Chief and earnestly support him in his ef
forts to suppress the sources of the evil.
There is hardly any vice that is more destructive to
the morals of a community than gambling. It cor
rupts every faculty of heart and brain. It leads to
fctud, to drunkenness, to crime and to suicide. . Its
enticements appeal most strongly to the young, and
many of its unfortunate victims nave hardly arrived
at the age of manhood. The profits gained from the
nefarious trade by those who carry it on are enor
mous, and not infrequently they are gained from
money which the victim has stolen from his employer.
Over and over again San Francisco has had to
make a fight in the interests of morality against this
evil. Now we have at the head of the police force
a Chief who has gone about the work of suppression
in the right way. Let him have the public support
which he deserves and he will win, despite all the
pool-sellers may do or their yellow ally may publish.
The Empress Dowager of China lias issued an edict
ordering her subjects to promptly erect a memorial
to Li Hung Chang, and we shall now see whether
they will manage it any sooner than the United States
will manage to construct the national memorial to
McKinley. Of course we are a much swifter people
than the Chinese, but then sometimes an imperial
order starts a movement quicker than an appeal for
subscriptions.
Since women themselves have not been able to
bring about a dress reform in the direction of getting
rid of the long skirts that sweep the pavement, a New
Jersey statesman proposed to help them along by the
enactment of a law prohibiting any woman from
wearing on the street a skirt that does not clear the
ground by at least two inches.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1901.
TROUBLE FOR THE COMBINE.
THE Governor cf Minnesota is first in the field
against the Western railway combine. He an
nounces that if there is at present enough Min
nesota law to keep the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern cut of the combine he will at once invoke
it, and i,f there is not enough he will call the Legisla
ture in special session to make some more. It is an
interesting evidence of the uncertainty as to the law
felt by the engineers of the combination that their
stocks fell off largely as soon as this news came from
St. Paul. If the Governor proceed we may expect a
period of expensive litigation over the legal issue, for
what Minnesota may do other States may, and the
granger agitation of thirty years ago may have an
acute revival.
.The growth of American railways has been on
ward, not on the line of least resistance, but always on
that of the greatest. Beginning in 1828, when the
pioneer road, the Baltimore and Ohio, was started,
the first difficulty encountered was incident to secur
ing right of way. The present method of condemna
tion by use of the right of eminent domain was then
unthought of. The projectors of a railway could not
run their random lines across country, selecting grade
and way and terminal points, and condemning all
right of way for which they could not bargain. If
they came to the line of a stubborn land-owner who
would not sell their project must be abandoned or
changed. Had there been no alternative to the plan
of prurate purchase for right of way it is safe to say
that the system of American roads would never have
been created. One needs to go back to the political
and legal literature of the country from 1828 to 1851 to
learn that the "octopus" is not a new monster in
American politics and law. When it was proposed to
use the right of eminent domain and condemn right
of way the excitement was general and many good
people were convinced that liberty was at an end. In
New Hampshire and other States parties were dis
rupted by it, but everywhere a few enterprising citi
zens firmly stood by progress, and the condemnation
laws were passed by State after State and were firmly
embedded in American law by the decisions of the
courts.
From the beginning of construction in 1828 by 1835
there were in operation 1008 miles. Two years later
New York harbor and Philadelphia were connected
by rail. In 1841 Boston and Albany were put in rail
communication, and the next year Albany and Buf
rslo were connected, and Philadelphia reached the
coal fields by construction of the Reading line. The
panic of 1837 and lack of money for such investments
were seriously felt, and by 1845 there was a slacking
off. In 1848 to 1851 the settlement of the right of way
problem removed one great difficulty, and in 1848
Boston and New York were connected. In 1851 the
Hudson River line was built between New York and
Albany, and that year our total rail mileage was 9021.
In iB6O it was 36,625; in 1870, 52,922; in 1880, 93,262;
in 1890, 166,653: and by 1899 it had reached the grand
total of 191,310 miles, or nearly equal to the combined
rail mileage of all the rest of the world.
As the mileage increased rates of transportation
fell. During the .seventeen years ending 1898 the re
ductions in freight rates saved to the shippers on the
tonnage hauled the vast sum of $3,802,000,000, or one
third the value of all the stocks and bonds of the
roads. The rate reductions in one year, 1897-98,
amounted to a saving to the public of $44,267,874.
In the same period passenger rates fell 21 per
cent. From 1882 to 1898, inclusive, railway mileage
increased 92 per cent and passenger travel only 83
per cent. In that period the reduction in rates to the*
number of passengers hauled amounted to $645,624,
77. So in the seventeen-year period the savings to
the people on passengers and freight by reductions in
rates aggregated $4,447,624,777. During that period
the highest inte r est paid on the railway bonded debt
of the country was 7.77 per cent, and the highest divi
dend on railway stocks was 2.91 per cent.
We have not at hand the mileage of the roads in the
Western combine, nor their gross and net earnings
per mile, but they have been participants in the re
ductions of the seventeen-year period to the extent
of their operation during that time. Now they are to
pass through a period of violent antagonism before
they will be permitted to show that by virtue of the
economy of combination they can increase dividends
without raising rates. The people will never know
the virtue or the vice of the combination until oppor

THAT worthy guild the Women's Christian
Temperance Union has just been holding its an
nual conventicle at Fort Worth, Texas. Repre
sentatives were present from many countries, v and
the memory of the devoted founder of the order, Miss
Willard, was abundantly honored in the number, in
telligence and zeal of her followers who gathered
there.
On the Sunday that came during the sessions the
thirty-four pulpits of the city were filled by preach
ing ladies, whose sermons were heard with atten
tion by crowded congregations. Members of all sects
were in evidence. The Methodist Episcopal church
South was filled to listen to a Unitarian, and a Meth
odist filled a Presbyterian pulpit. Southern sentiment
was represented by Mrs. Hoge of Virginia and Miss
Belle Kearny of Mississippi, and the voice of England
was raised for righteousness, temperance and the
judgment to come by Miss Christine Tenling of Lon
don.
The star sermon of this great day seems to have
been preached by Miss Greenwood of New York in
the Christian tabernacle. Her subject was, "Preach
ing the Gospel," and she seems to have taken an
armed excursion into politics, a sort of punitive ex
pedition. To this there is no objection. Interest in
public affairs is one of the strong and strengthening
peculiarities of American women. They vote in four
States, and in one of these, Colorado, have taken up
office holding with an energy which makes the tyrant
man stand still with surprise, while they pass him in
the race. They carry into Colorado politics an in
fluence which will command respect, though at pres
ent their status is somewhat misunderstood. In the
last city convention in Denver they were present
as delegates, and manipulated things as skillfully and
as cleanly as they would dough on the kneading
board. In the same convention man was present in
all his variety, and among them was a ward boss,
who indulged in a freedom of off color expression
that was so offensive that one of the ladies said:
"You forget that we are ladies." The captain of
hundreds looked at her in surprise and replied: "
are yees ladies? I tought ye was diligates."
But to return to Fort Worth and Miss Greenwood.
She gave the American male politician a pickling that
he will not soon forget, and in the course of the
operation said: "Politicians strove to make Theodore
Roosevelt Vice President that they might remove
him as Governor of New York, in the hope that they
would no longer be hindered in their wicked work,
and behold, a' most signal and disastrous reversal of
their plans. Ro6sevelt, a man of destiny, becomes
President, while his successor, Governor Odell, de
velops ability to rise above aims and standards of
machine politicians. History emphasizes the exact
ness of God's justice."
Now, we suppose that this ought to be referred
to Senator Platt as a committee of the whole, but
comment may be made in advance of that parlia
mentary disposition of it. It has not heretofore been
thought that Providence takes such an interest in
New York politics as to secure the murder of Presi
dent McKinley in order to rebuke Senator Platt by
the elevation of the Vice President. We arefin doubt
that President Roosevelt takes that view of it. His
min^ perhaps is more finite than that of the inspired
Miss Greenwood, and being so, if impressed with
the wickedness 01 Senator Platt he would doubtless
drop a hint to Providence to get in and convert that
Senator from his wicked ways instead of killing Mc-
Kinley. Why it should be considered a more con
genial job for Providence to kill McKinley than to
soften the heart of Platt and the politicians is what
no man can explain.
Nor is it explained why Providence takes a hand
in New York politics and not in Pennsylvania. Why
should Senator Quay flourish like the bay tree and
Platt wither like the fig tree when attention was
called to its barrenness? Why also should the Rev.
Mr. Swallow, the head of Quay's foes and temperance
leader of bis State, be just turned out of the Meth
odist pulpit for falsehood? Perhaps it shows the
danger of having Providential politics in only one
State and leaving the other forty-four to shift for
themselves.
Miss Greenwood is of the opinion that this "Hiv
tory emphasizes the exactness of God's justice." Bui
still it is left greatly dark to the carnal mind why
McKinley was by that justice condemned to a crutl
death, in order to admonish Platt to the better selec
tion of fourth-class postmasters! If that infinite jus
tice works so indirectly, to the carnal mind again it
appears to be an inferior article to our ordinary brand
of domestic justice. The latter aims at the punishment
of the guilty and the protection of the innocent. It
would let McKinley, the good man, live out his days
in honor and peace, and would indict the wicked poli
ticians by the Grand Jury of the district and send
them to Sing Sing.
By the carnal analysis of this matter, both Presi
dent Roosevelt and Governor Odell need to sleep
with one eye open, foi are they not good men, and
do not the wicked still go up and down the earth
seeking whom they may devour? Is there not danger
that the further admonition of the bad may require
the killing of both President and Governor, in order
to emphasize the divine plan as divulged at Fort
Worth?
THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS.
AN Associated Press dispatch from Chicago,
published in The Call of yesterday, gave a re
port of statements made in that city by three
members of the Yukon Department of Public Works
concerning the conspiracy to capture Dawson, of
which the first information was given to the world by
The Call. Mr. Maynard, who acted as principal
spokesman for the Yukon party, stated: "We expect
to proceed to Ottawa at once and will have a consul
[ tation with the high Government authorities about
conditions in the territory. This trouble may assume
an international phase, because so many members of
the secret military order are Americans and we can
not try them for treason."
The dispatch stated that the Yukon officials had
stopped at Chicago for the purpose of consulting
with certain capitalists of that city who have large in
terests in Yukon Territory. The White Pass and
Yukon Railway is largely owned by American capital
and its main office is in Chicago. The owners of the
road, along with many other American capitalists,
are of course greatly interested in the conditions of
the country, and the reported conspiracy is a matter
of almost as much concern to them as to the Cana
dians themselves.
That important item of current news, affect
ing large financial as well as political interests, was
sent out by the Associated Press, the greatest news
gathering agency in the world, to all papers entitled
to its service. It was therefore received by our morn
ing contemporaries as well as by The Call, and yet
neithei of them published it. Despite the fact that
the report was furnished by the Associated Press, that
it gave ample authority for its statements, and that it
carried upon its face evidence of its value as a part of
the news of the day, it was deliberately suppressed.
Just what reasons induced our contemporaries to
ignore such statements made by Canadian officials
concerning the conspiracy must be left to conjecture.
It is not likely they will attempt to explain. The fact
that The Call had been first to publish the story may,
however, have had something to do with their desire
to suppress anything which confirmed it. It would
seem that in their judgment it is better to suppress
the news than to admit that another has been first to
oDtain it. /
It will be remembered that a similar practice of
suppression of news was practiced by the Examiner
with respect to wireless telegraphy after the great feat
of The Call in making use of it to report the arrival
of the transport bringing home the California Vol
unteers from Manila, and the success with which The
Call and the New York Herald used it in reporting
the international yacht race. For a time the Exam
iner ridiculed the idea that wireless telegraphy is a
possibility. When experiment after experiment at
last confirmed the new system of telegraphy beyond
any question, then the Examiner ignored the whole
thing. For a long time it would not publish Associ
ated Press dispatches giving reports of the results of
governmental experiments with it. At last, however,
the yellow journal had to admit wireless telegraphy
and publish information concerning progress in its
use.
Something of the same kind will happen in this
case. When The Call first published the great story
of the conspiracy one of our contemporaries ignored
it, while the other ridiculed it. Now they find them
selves compelled to enter upon a policy of suppressing
the news in order to avoid confirming the story.
Perhaps the alternative is not disagreeable to a fake
journal, but to a legitimate newspaper editor the
adoption of a policy which entails the suppression of
important news must be very annoying.
Mayor Tom Johnson of Cleveland, the great re
former who hopes to become President some day, has
made a new reform movement in Cleveland by pro
hibiting turkey raffles, which are so popular during
the holidays, and perhaps if he were President he
would try to prohibit Thanksgiving.
Congress has not yet assembled, but it is already
estimated that the river and harbor bill which will be
presented to it will carry appropriations amounting
to something like $60,000,000, so it would seem the
talk of a reduction of taxes is a little bit premature.

in the Role of
Siegmund.
All Artists Are Rewarded
by Volumes of
Applause.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON
THERE should be a regret for every
vacant seat last night at the Grand
Opera-house, and there were many,
for "Die Walkure" was riven in
noble pitch almost from end to end.
The performance was incomparably bet
ter than on Its first production during the
season and aroused an enthusiasm much
more general and genuine than on its first
hearing. The singers were in Inspired
mood, the orchestra to match, and the
Wagner served up last night Lad the
majesty and breadth of Its maker.
Perhaps because little was expected of
Reuss-Belce her Brunnhilde seemed more
nearly to approach the Nordica, concep
tion last night. Certainly the singer was
in better voice than she has been before
since her coming here and sang the part
much more than acceptably. She lacks
Etalellness, power and brilliance, but with
a mood to fit that of the other singers last
night she rose sometimes to a high. level
of accomplishment. Her voice sounded
sweeter and rounder and its quality of
sharp brightness, noted in her Venus,
served her in good stead as the warrior
maid.
Gadskl and Van Dyck shared honors last
night. Van Dyck took Dipple's place as
Siegmund. and particularly in the first act
did great things with the character. He
was at his best vocally and his brilliant
dramatic genius was never more in evi
dence than In that whole wonderful first
act last night. Siegmund's life story, the
growth of his love for Sieglinde, the sword
scene, the simple savagery and primitive
bigness of it all was given in Inspired
fashion, and Mr. Van Dyck's voice held
out to its last colossal necessity. There
was a large drop in quality in his second
act. but there is so little to do compara
tively that it did not much matter.
Gadski was in lovely form, more dra
matic than I have ever seen her and sing
ing at her sweetest. % She also excelled her
self and her voice had a satisfying large
ness and climax that was somewhat
wanting on the first "Walkure" night.
Gadski is an eminent artist and her Sieg
linde is not the least among the splendid
things she has done this season. The lit
tle scene where, in her flight from Hund
ing, she falls fainting into Siegmund"s
arms, was a small masterpiece of acting
arc throughout she has never been better
heard or seen. Schumann-Heink is never
anything but magnificent, and she was
simply immense last night in her all too
small opportunity as Frlcka.
As before Mr. Bispham was the Wotan
âpoor old god!â having the usual hard
time between his royal termagant of a
wife and his willful Walkyrie, Brunnhilde
and repeated his good work of last week'
Mr. Blass was an efficient Hunding and
the Walkyries of the evening, who gave
the "ride" with a meteoric brilliance, were
Schumann-Heink. Van Cauteren, Bauer

DIAMOND MAN
VISITING CITY
Gardner P. Williams of
Kimberley, South
Africa, Here.
Gardner F. Williams, the pioneer Cali
fornian, who handles more diamonds an
nually and wears less than any other man
la the world, arrived from Kimberley,
South Africa, on Sunday to visit his
mother and sisters, who live in Oakland,
is spending some of his time in San
Francisco. Mr. Williams Is general man
ager of the Kimberley diamond mines and
has under his control an army of 12,000
diamond seekers. He was a resident of
this city from ISSB to 1884, when he went
to Africa.
Mr. Williams was seen at the residence
of T. C. Van Ness, 2845 Fillmore street, by
a Call reporter last night. In the course
of an extended interview he said:
The Kimberley mines are exporting annually
about $25,000,000 worth of. precious stones. Dur
ing the Boer war the mines were shut down for
a long period. The siege of Kimberley was of
lour months' duration, and in that time 8000
shells were fired into the city, with only nine
casualties resulting therefrom. I regard the
war as being practically over. It certainly
would be to the beet lntereEts of the Boers to
submit to the inevitable. The English are
bound eventually to win the struggle, and pro
longed resistance to British authority will re
sult only in making matters worse. The Boers
are incapable of self-government by reason of
their apathy and lack of enterprise
The etatements in the press that Cecil Rhodes
is a dying man are untrue. 1 went shooting
with him in Scotland In September, and he was
able to endure more hardships than m-sclf
He Is a wonderful man. and his railway "tram
sea to sea will certainly be realized. He will
be a factor in the pacification of the Trans
vaal. The conditions of affairs there In conse
quence of the war are deplorable. The entire
country has been devastated and it will require
many years to bring matters to their normal
condition after the peace.
Mr. Williams will remain at the home
of his sister, Mrs. E. B. Clement, 1703
Telegraph avenue, Oakland, until Friday,
when he starts for Africa, via London.

Well-Known Local Advertising Man
Quietly Marries the Widow of
"Ducksey" Rosenbaum.
Mrs. Sarah Rosenbaum, widow of the
late "Ducksey" Rosenbaum, a wealthy
capitalist who committed suicide about a
year ago and over whose estate there
was considerable litigation, was married
yesterday afternoon to Harry A. Rodgers,
a local designer and advertising man. The
couple were introduced about a week ago
by a mutual friend and it was a case of
love at first sight. They left on their

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, jnuYEMBER 27, 1901.
NO CONSPIRACY,
SAYS HEYWOOD
Marine Corps Command
ant Testifies at Meade
Court.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â P. C. Adsersicn,
a civil engineer, was questioned to-day at
the trial by court-martial of Colonel
Meade of the United States marine corps.
He testified that in his opinion the cost
of the disputed repair work at the navy
yard was excessive. Major Theodore
Wood of the marine corps testified that
while the repair work was crude it ful
filled the specifications.
Brigadier General Charles H. Heywood,
commandant of the marine corps, testified
that he had not spoken to any one of re
tiring before he reached %he age limit,
which will be two years from now, and
that he could not afford to retire at an
earlier day. He denied having an under
standing with any one as to the succes
sion to the office. He stated that he had
not seen or heard anything to indicate a
conspiracy between Colonel Denny and
Major Lauchheimer against Colonel
Meade or any attempt to injure him a,t
headquarters.
"On the contrary," said General Hey
wood, "I think the action taken at head
quarters was such as to make Colenel
Meade a strong candidate for the office of
commandant of the marine corps."
General Heywood said he was perfectly
satisfied with the work done on the ma
rine barracks; the contractors had made
good all defects for which they were
properly responsible. He said that Col
onel Denny had told him that he had on
two occasions been embarrassed while in
specting by the fact that Colonel Meade
was under the influence of liquor, and a
written report on this point was then
made by Colonel Denny at his orders.
TURKISH DIPI/OMAT
MAKES AN EXPLANATION
Embassador to Great Britain Tells of
the Seizure of a
Convent.
LONDON, Nov. 26.â Costaki Anthopulo
Pasha, the Turkish Embassador to Great
Britain, has given out the Porte's expla
nation of the seizure of an Armenian con
vent in the neighborhood of Mush by
Armenian revolutionists and the subse
quent surrounding of the convent by the
Turkish troops. He says that bandits
hay& been ravaging the country and ex
torting money and goods from the Ar
menian population, murdering those who
refused to comply with their demands.
These bandits took about sixty women
and children as prisoners to the monas
tery and Andranik, the leader of the ban
dits, tried to obtain money by threats
from the Armenians of Mush.
Thereupon, in order to protect the wo
men and children, the imperial authorities
surrounded the monastery with Turkish
troops. Some fighting occurred, during
which two brigands and a Turkish cor
poral were killed. British and Russian
Consuls repaired to the scene and testified
to ' the correct attitude of the Turkish
soldiers. The brigands kept up a hot
fire from the monastery and being well
provisioned they were able to offer a stout
resistance.
This official statement from the Turkish
Embassador does not explain how the
affair ended, but a dispatch received sub
sequently from Constantinople says that
the brigands fled and the Turkish troops
were withdrawn.

THE large audience that was ex
pected to be present last night to
hear the second performance of
"Die Walkure" by the Grau com
pany at the Grand Opera-house
failed to materialize.
Just why society did not turn out in full
force for the superb presentation puzzled
the management and the Wagnerites.
Either grand opera is a social fad, as
Manager Grau himself has said, and the
novelty of gala nights has worn away, or
else the indisposition of Eames, Sander
son and Calve has created alarm and the
public fears to put up its dollars as it did
during the first two weeks of the season.
The Grand Opera-house was a little
more than half filled last night. There
was no elaborate display of dress and
promenading in the lobby and foyer was
confined to the men In the audience.
The artistic work of Gadski, Schumann-
Heink, Bispham, Reuss-Belce and Van
Dyck was rewarded with considerable ap
plause and the great "Valkyrie chorus"
elicited the heartiest approbation. The
work of Damrosch and the orchestra was
well worth a visit to the theater and the
conductor was called to the footlights
with the singers.
The management announced last night to
the press that it hoped to present Eamea,
Sanderson and Calve as per programme
and that seats for the rest of thi3 and next
week would be placed on sale at the box
office of the opera-house to-day.
Grau has arranged to present Calve
on Saturday night in "Carmen."
A representative of Manager Grau
stated last night that no word had been
received from Calva, but that there was
every hope that she would be back in
San Francisco to sing- on Saturday night.
A big house is expected to-night when
a double bill will be given, consisting
of "Don Pasquale" and "I Pagliacci."
Sembrich, Scotti, Tavecchia, Vanni and
Salignac are to sing in "Don Pasquale"
and Fritzi Scheff, De March!, Declery,
Relss and Campanari are to be heard In
the delightful composition of Leoncavallo.
The management announces- "Romeo et
Juliette," with Sybil Sanderson, for the
matinee to-morrow, to be given at popular
prices, while the bill for to-morrow even
ing is "Die Meistersinger," with its great
cast.
Eames la expected to sing on Friday
night in "Alda' and the Saturday matinee
is to be "II Barbiere di Siviglia," with
Sembrich in the cas^
BLAINE MARSHAL
FIRES INTO MOB
One Man Is Dying and
Another Seriously
Wounded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BLAINE, Wash., Nov. 26.â Strict atten
tion to duty nearly cost Night Marshal
Doane of Blame his life last night. While
arresting an Italian laborer he was set
upon by a number of the offender's ccmn
trymen, armed with knives and axes.
After warning them to desist Doane fi' ed,
emptying six chambers of his rev ever
into the mob. Two Italians were hit and
one of them will die. He was shot three
times, through the neck, lung and shoul
der. Another Italian was shot through
the leg. They were carried to the city
jail and to-day sent to the hospital fn
Whatcom. Doane was not badly injured.
For some time an attempt has been
made by the authorities to compel Italian
fishermen and loggers in this vicinity to
refrain from carrying concealed weapons.
Some Italians have obeyed, but others
have refused. Orders were accordingly is
sued to search all Italians when they
came to town and take their weapons
from them. The object was to prevent
their fighting among themselves. Doane's
life had been threatened because he made
strenuous efforts to disarm all Italians
found carrying weapons.
WOMAN DIRECTOR
IS NOT POPULAR
Teachers Are Opposed
to Mrs. Kincaid's
Reappointment.
Principal O'Connor Denies
Circulating Petition in
Her Behalf '
A choice morsel of gossip was tossed
about among the city's school teachers
yesterday. It was to the effect that a pe
tition would be circulated among the
pedagogues for signature, asking Mayor
elect Schmltz to reappoint Mrs. Mary
Kincaid as a member of the Board of
Education.
It was stated that Principal Joseph
O'Connor of the Mission High School
would take the petition around and "re
quest" the teachers to append their names
to it
A detail of the story was that O'Connor
would be backed up. in the affair by a yel
low morning journal that had sent him
around the world. Gossip reported that
the yellow journal, having aided Mayor
elect Schmitz in his campaign, would de
mand the reappointment of Mrs. Kincaid.
Teachers who were seen yesterday were
averse to talking for publication, but
Principal O'Connor was willing to be
quoted. He said:
" This story is made out of whole
cloth. There is not a word of truth in it.
I have had absolutely nothing to do with
the circulation of any petition asking for
the reappointment of Mrs. Kincaid. I
defy any one to come forward and say
that I am connected with any such propo
sition. It is against the rules of the de
partment and I do not know of any such
petition being circulated. I am glad of
this opportunity of making a statement
and wish to go on record in the mat
ter.'
The school teachers are awaiting
anxiously the time when Mayor-elect
Schmitz will assume office. The women
teachers are said to be almost unanimous
ly opposed to the reappointment of Mrs.
Kincaid.
SATISFIED MRS. STEPHENS.
ENDED HER OWN EXISTENCE
Captain Seymour, After Making a
Thorough Investigation, Props
the Case.
After making a thorough investigation
into the allegation made by Frank Spen
cer, brother of the late Mrs. Charles A.
Stephens, that she did not commit sui
cide, Captain Seymour is satisfied that
Spencer is wrong. Yesterday he h^ard
his statement, which was altogether based
on talk and suspicion, and also the state
ment of the dead woman's husband, who
characterizes the suspicions cast upon
his parents as a gross outrage. His
mother had not been in the city since a
week before last Sunday and his father
is a decrepit man, 70 years of age.
The stomach of the dead woman was
sent to the cicy chemist for anlyals after
the autopsy had shown acid poisoning,
probably hydrochloric acid. Meantime
Captain Seymour is satisfied that the ver
dict of the Coroner's jury Monday was
correct and will do nothing further in the
matter.
Police Officer Fined.
Ex-Police Officer Frank Green, who was
dropped from the force on June 25 last for
failing to report at a fire, applied to th*
Police Commissioners last night for rein
statement.
Officer 4 R. H. Beamer pleaded guilty to
falling asleep on duty In the White Star
laundry and was fined $10. The cases of
Officers Barry and RoDcrt Lean were con
tinued for a week.
For the fifth time the Commissioners
refused a license to open a grill and sa
loon at the corner of Beale and Market
streets. There were a number of peti
tions and protests filed by business men
in the neighborhood, the protests out
weighing the petitions.

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop service of
the weather bureau, ts as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The temperature has been slightly above
normal in all parts of the State during the
week. Heavy legs have prevailed along the
coast and in portions of the San Joaquin Val
ley, and rain has fallen from Fresno north
ward, the greatest precipitation having oc
curred in the counties about the bay. No
injurious frosts have been reported. .
Early town wheat is in excellent condition
and growing rapidly in all sections. Summer
lallowing is nearly completed in some localities
and larwers are preparing for. winter grain
planting. If the season continues lavorable
me acreage sown to grain will be largely in
creasea in many places. The heavy rain re
tarded plowing in some of the northern bay.
counties, but in most places this work is go
ing lorward rapidly. Grass. is making rapid
growth and sreen leed is more plentlrul man
lur several years at this date. Stock is in
excellent condition. Beans are nearly all
feathered and the crop has turned out remark
ably well, the loss from rain having been
much less than anticipated.
Orchards and vineyards continue in good con
dition ana tree pruning is in progress. The
orange crop is being gathered and shipped.
Oranges are 01 better quality than usual, and
11 some sections the yield will exceed that of
last season. Olive picking and pickling are
progressing.
&AÂ»_Â«.AaiÂ£NTO VALLEY.â weather dur
ing the week has been lavorable for farm work,
The temperature has been somewhat above the
normal and light rain has fallen in nearly all
sections. Plowing and seeding continue. Wheat
is making splendid growth and looks strong
ana heaitny. Summer-tallowing is nearly com
pleted in some places and farmers are prepar
ing for winter sowing. Grass is growing rap
idly and green feed is unusually abundant.
Stock is in good condition. Orchard work is
progressing. Oranges and olives are being
gathered. The bean crop has been harvested.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â Warm
weather has prevailed during the week, favor- '
able lor l&rm work and crowing crops. Rain
has fallen from San Francisco northward,
amounting to over two inches in Napa and
Sonoma counties, and heavy fogs have pre
vailed along the coast. Rain is needed In the.
southern coast counties, where the soil in some
places is too dry for plowing. Some cultivat
ing is being dene in tnese places and in other
sections plowing and seeding are progressing
rapidly. It the season continues favorable a
large acreage of wheat will be sown. Green
Seed is in excellent condition. Some orchardlsts*
in Napa County are wrapping prune trees with
paper saturated with "bug exterminator," hop
ing to prevent the ravages of the cankerworm.
SAN JAOQUIN VALLEY.â fogs have
prevailed in most sections during the nights
&nd mornings, clearing away about 10 o'clock.
Light rain has fallen from Fresno northward,
in some places having been sufficient to benefit
early grain and pasturage. Light frosts have
occurred in some sections. Early sown grain
is growing rapidly and looks well. The wheat
acreage will be materially increased in portions
of Tulare County. Plowing and seeding are in
progress except or. the very dry lands. Green
feed is plentiful and stock is in good condition.
Orchards and vineyards are looking well.
Orange picking and shipping continue.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â The tempera
ture has been nearly normal during the week
and no rain has fallen. Fogs have prevailed
along the coast. The bean crop is practically
all harvested; there have been some losses
through rain and fogs, but not so great .as
anticipated. Plowing and seeding are progress
ing in nearly all sections: a large acreage is
being sown to barley in the vicinity of Ana
heim, and there will be about the usual acre
age, of v.heat if conditions continue favorable.
Early sown grain and pasturage are in good
condition, but will need rain : soon. Oranges
art ripening rapidly; there will be a good crop.
A . few late raisins are on â¢ the trays in San
Diego County.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARYâ fine
growing week. Plowing and seeding progress
ing actively. Beans are nearly all thrashed
and are turning out better than was expected.
Hills and valleys are covered with green feed.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Nov. 26.â Amalgamated Copper
went through an exceedingly varied course of i
movements in to-day's stock market and fin- I
ished unchanged from last night. The course
of this stock was a pretty accurate index of
the general market to-day. The day's net
changes are seen to be very small, as a rule,
and considerably mixed, although the extreme
range of prices was considerable. A notable
fact in connection with the constantly changing
course of prices was the consistency of the
movements. Sometimes the course of the mar
ket would vary distinctly three times within
an hour, traversing each time an average range
of nearly a point. Yet the whole list moved
pretty much in unison, there being no appar
ent conflict in the tendency of the prominent
active stocks. The opening dealings reflected
a distinct effort at a bull demonstration for
an advance, the trunk lines being selected for
leadership. Amalgamated Copper was also sup
ported in the opening dealings, but the weak- |
ness which quickly developed in this stock was j
reflected In the whole market, and so with its
subsequent changes. The stock tell by succes
sive str.-.-es and very uncertainly Vp 78 and re- !
coverec vith frequent reactions to 80%, ending
at SO. There was an entire lack of news to !
account for the movements. The early weak- .
ness was in face of permission from a court to
the Boston and Montana Company to pay the i
dividend on that stock under bond. The with- j
holding of these dividends was officially in- ;
Terred as a cause for the reduction of the divi
dend on Amalgamated Copper. The recovery ;
In the stock was- in spite of the sharp break In
the price of raw copper in London, following
some recent speculative buying In that mar
ket. A striking feature of the check to the
recent advancing tendency of the market was j
the decided decrease in activity. To-day's
transactions were abcut half a million shares
less than those of yesterday. The unsettling
influence of the apparent demoralization in
Amalgamated Copper was supplemented to a
degree by a sharp recovery in foreign exchange, ;
which awakened some renewed questioning over j
the resources of the money market for the re- ,
mainder of the year. The lessened supply of I
exchange is doubtless due to the completion of
realizing on what might be called speculative
purchases of exchange which have been recent- |
ly made. An advance of seven points in Gen- [
eral Electric, the strength of Sugar and Man- j
hattan and the heaviness of Baltimore and
Ohio and St. Louis and San Francisco were '
notable.
Railroad bonds were Irregular; total sales,
$3,725,000. United states bonds were all un
changed on the last call.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market to-day was inactive and
depressed by the forced selling of mines and by
a fresh break in English rails.
The American department was dumb until
the afternoon and nominally under parity, save
in the case of Ontario and Western. The open
account is trifling. . NÂ«jÂ»r York came weak, then
caused a rally by ilbeftl purchases of Wabash.
The close was steady.
The market is waiting for ' President Roose
velt's message to Congress, particularly his
treatment of the tariff question. A leading ar
bitrageur considers the outlook dull, until the
Northern Securities Company stock is ready for
the market. Rio Tlntos touched 45 on the drop
in Amalgamated Copper. Silver sold at 25% on
New York realization.

done much to sustain prices recently, was of
a less urgent character on the advance, how
ever, and during the afternoon December fell
to 61% c and closed easy, %@%c under yester
day, at 61%Â«61%c. May was better supported
and while the price was reduced its premium

BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 26.â There has been
a fair amount of wool changing hands here
during the past week, and prices are practi
cally the same as la3t week. The market is in
a very healthy condition and the prospects are

London Wool Sales.
LONDON. Nov. 26.â The sixth series of the
1901 wool auction sales opened to-day with a
very large attendance. Competition was slow,
as the offerings, which numbered 10,755 bales,
were rather inferior. The offerings consisted
principally of cross-breds and faulty Merinos.
A few fine qualities were offered and caused
active bidding, finally selling at unchanged
rates. All lower grades were 5@7% per cent
lower.

Exchange and Bullion.
The banks auoted no rates for New York
Exchange yesterday, as the market was very
unsettled. Now that tax time has passed,
however, it is expected that rates will soon
get back to normal conditions. Silver continues
to ease off, Sterling Exchange is still weaker,
and Mexican dollars are quoted much lower.
The steamer Sierra from Sydney brought up
$486,860 in sovereigns, making a total from this
source thus far this year of $11,941,413, against
$17,104,364 for the same time last year.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ The market is active,
and considerable spot chartering has been done
during the past week at rates ranging from 34s
6 to 35s 9d, according to size of vessel, usual
options, greatly reducing the disengaged ton
nage In port. The chartered wheat fleet in port
now has a registered tonnage of 69,360, ftfainat
51,615 tons on the same date last year; disen
gaged, 6512 tons, against 12,653; on the way to
this port, 193,750, against 122,376.
WHEATâ The foreign markets were quieter
and the feeling at Liverpool was weaker. Brad
street's gave the following statement of sup
plies: East of the Rockies, an Increase of
6,541,000 bushels; Europe and afloat, an Increase
of 1,400,000; total increase. 6,941,000 bushels.
Chicago was weaker in sympathy with the re
actionary tendency in coarse grains,, chiefly
due to speculative realizing, and the larger in
terior movement in Oats. The bears were also
encouraged by the heavy movement in the
Northwest. Bradstreet's statement, published
above, coupled with the large increase in the
American visible supply during the past two
weeks, cave the bears expectations of a de
cline. Some long wheat came out on large re
ceipts In the Northwest, and trading was not
as heavy a? during the past few days.
Against these bearish conditions, however, St.
Louis was higher and Kansas City wired in
jury from dry weather in some parts of Kan
sas and Missouri. The other markets were rel
atively strong, and there were plenty of buying
orders. Minneapolis mills reported sales of
45,000 barrels Flour.^ Outside orders absorbed
all the wheat sold during the morning.

too high.

firm. There were no local receipts yesterday.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The whole street reports a very weak Butter
market and the general opinion is that prices
must soon get down to the level of packed
goods, as the retailers are largely running on
the latter. Stocks of all descriptions are lib
eral and the market is topbeavy.
Cheese remains as previously quoted.
Eggs developed sudden weakness yesterday,
as they seemed to come in from all directions,
which impelled dealers to sell. Some houses
quoted a decline, while others struggled to
maintain the market The feeling, however,
wÂ»s distinctly weak.
Receipts were 19,700 pounds of Butter,
pounds of Eastern Butter, 471 cases of Eggs,
cases of Eastern Eggs, 5500 pounds, of Cali

There is a good Thanksgiving demand for the
other fruits. Grapes are In slender receipt and

POSTXTM CEREAL.
COFFEE IMPORTER
Tells Some Plain Facts.
One of the heaviest importers of coffee
in America and who requests that his
urn* be kept from the public in connec-
tion with the following subject because of
the effect it would have on his business,
Bays : 'I have used coffee for over thirty-five
years, but about a year ago was compelled
to discontinue its use on account of its
effect on my health. Since that time I
have used nothing in its place but Postum
Cereal Food Coffee, and properly pre-
pared it Is simply delicious with cream
and sugar.
"In connection with this I have also
used Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food. - While
in Florida this winter I carried a pack-
age with me all the time, so if I was un-
able to get what I wanted for breakfast
I could rely on my own supply.
"Any one who could "have known of my
condition a year ago, and the very great
improvement now, would have no cause
to question the wisdom of my change
from the old-fashioned diet to the pres-
ent."
This man Is one of the best known cof-
fee experts in the world and his testimony
Â§ regarding the flavor of Postum Cereal
Food Coffee is noteworthy.
Now and then a person gets Postum
Food Coffee served under-boiled and con-
sequently almost tasteless. A chemical
change takes place in Postum after it has
been actively boiled for twelve or fifteen
minutes; this change brings out the food
value and the delicious taste. It does not
answer to simply leave it on the stove for
fifteen minutes, It must stand on the stove
until boiling commences, then be allowed
to bubble fifteen minutes.
A piece of butter twice the size of a pea
Khould be put in the pot to keep It from
boiling over.
" Many a man or woman continues in a
_ half sick state from month to month, not
w knowing hat the drug in the coffee they
use is the cause; try leaving off coffee and
using Postum Food Coffee. That change
has worked salvation for many skeptical
sick ones. -Â¦_
BRITAIN'S WAR
PLEASES EUROPE
Powers Have No Desire
for Attempt at In
tervention.
United States Not Likely to
Intercede for the
Eoers.
f pccial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.-Despite the
! apparent desire of the powers of con
i tinental Europe that the United States
I should intervene- to stop the war in South
! Africa, the administration officials ex
! press the opinion that those governments
! really prefer its continuance.
This belief is based upon the fact that
i the prolongation of the struggle weakens
Great Britain and makes the European
nations relatively stronger. It is true that
I unofficial suggestions have been advanced
,to the United States to interfere, but
these suggestions have always been met
, with the response that the scene of the
war is $000 miles away from this country
'Â¦ and there is no excuse for intervention.
Great Britain has been extremely
friendly to the United States. She has
without hesitation granted important con
cessions, notably in the matter of the
: isthmian canal treaty, and she has
promptly settled all questions which have
arisen in connection with the South
African war.
The latest case to which her attention
has been called is that of Ivenon Porter,
an American boy. who is serving in tho
British army. Young Porter's father
claimed that he had been employed as a
muleteer on a vessel transporting British
mules to South Africa ana that he was
practically forced to enlist in the British
army. An investigation made by the
State Department established that no
pressure was applied to young Porter and
that he enlisted of his own free will. It
is emphatically denied that Great Britain
has a recruiting station in this coun
try. The British Government is now in
quiring into the case of Porter. He will
probably be discharged from the British
army and returned to his parents.
HOLDS IT A VIOLATION
OF LAWS OF MONTANA
Governor Toole Makes a Statement
About the Northern Securities
Company Plan. _
HELENA. Mont.. Nov. 26.â Governor
Toole to-day replied to the request of
Governor Van Sant of Minnesota for his
views on the absorption of the stock of
the Northern Pacific, Great Northern and
Burlington railways by the Northern Se
curities Company. Governor Toole says
that according to the interpretation of
Governor Van Sant of the objects of the
Securities Company the absorption is a
plain violation of the constitution and
laws of Montana. He says he does not
now know what legal means can be taken
to defeat the objects of the consolidation,
but whatever they are they will be I
brought into operation. *
The Governor says the constitution of
Montana plainly forbids just what the at
torneys of the Northern Securities Com
pany have accomplished. He intimates
that the company is trying to do mdi- j
rectly what it could not under the Mon- i
tana law do directly, and he says that j
while the plan appears to be a successful
evasion of the law, it shall not be so taken
until the court of last resort has passed
upon the question. He promises the ac
tive aid of the Attorney General of the
State and says that later he will fix a
date for meeting and conferring with Gov
ernor Van Sant.

A pretty little girl and an Irish setter

SURVEYOR GENERAL. OF CALI
FORNIA, WHO PASSED AWAY
THIS MORNING.
coming the usual Democratic majority in
that district.
He took great interest in the rivers and
harbors of the State and became a recog
nized authority on the subject. He was
secretary of the California River and
Harbor Improvement Company. He was
sent to Washington in the interest of the
rivers and harbors of the State. While he
was on a trip East, President McKinley
appointed him Surveyor General of Cali
fornia. He assumed the duties of that
office on March 31. 1898, W. S. Green giving
way to him.
General Gleavas was made the president
of the Ohio Society of California last
year and helped entertain President Mc-
Kinley when he came to San Francisco in
May of this year.
It was feared for a time that General
Gleaves was suffering: from ptomaine poi
soning. A week ago last Sunday he ate
some broiled lobster and shortly after
ward was attacked by .severe pains in the
stomach. Dr. W. D. Clark was sum â¢
moned, and after a few days the patient
gave indications of recovering. So well,
in fact, had he become that he com
menced to make arrangements for return
ing to his office. Last Sunday he took a
drive through Golden Gate Park to enjoy
the fresh air and sunshine. Upon return
ing to his home the general experienced
no immediate HI effects from his recrea
tion, but during the evening he was taken
suddenly ill and complained of severe
pains in the abdomina' region.
On Monday he was removed to the Wal
deck Sanitarium, where an operation
for appendicitis was successfully per
formed, but no sign of that malady was
found.
CHIEF ROOMS
CHARGES FRAUD
Accuses Pound Officials
of Looting the City-
Treasury.
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â According to the
report made by Chief of Police Hodgkins
to-day to City Clerk Church, Poundmas
ter Swift and his deputies have been for
some time past successfully operating a
scheme for looting the city treasury by
means of false returns.
The law allows the poundmaster $1 50 a
head for all dead pigs picked up within
the city limits. The average harvest
prior to Poundmaster Swift's incumbency
was about fifty pigs per annum. In 1900,
however, the pound received $1 50 a head
for 349 dead pigs removed from the streets
and this year up to November 12 the total
is 878.
Police investigations, which are borne
out by the confession of Deputy Pound
master Frank McClelland, show that the
pound officials have been collecting infant
pigs in all directions, drawing largely on
the refuse of various slaughter houses.
The crop was at times too large for the
market and the police report tells how
the surplus was stored in pickle and
drawn on from time to time to keep up
with the financial requirements of the
pound management.
The City Council will take action on the
report at its next meeting.

TWO MERCHANTS
FACE COURT'S IRE
Contempt Proceedings
Sequel to Peculiar
Robbery.
Cayucos Business Men Are
Fighting for Their Liberty
and Honor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â From the lit
tle town of Cayucos. San Luis Obispo
County, comes a sensational legal case in
volving the â¢ honor and liberty of two
prominent business men. It is being heard
in the United States District Court of this
city, where Judge Olin Wellborn is trying
three persons for contempt. The story in
volves the sudden T^iilure of a supposedly
rich firm, the disappearance of many
thousands of dollars, the peculiar robbery
of a Â«afe which was not injured and a
mysterious woman who has exerted an
influence over one of the partners.
Natels de Gottardi and David E. Righ
etti for many years conducted a general
merchandise store in Cayucos, a town fit
about 400 inhabitants. Despite humble
surroundings, the firm, did a Dig business
and turnea over many hundreds of dol
lars each week. On April 30, 1901. it was
indebted to merchants and Danks in tbe
sum of $30,000. De Gottardi came to, Lcs
Angeles on April 27 and collected about
$60w in cash from Loeb. f .eishman & Co.
This amount he claims to have put into
the firm's safe in t.'ayucos, together with
$1500 of his own money, the same night.
On the morning of May 1 De Gottar li
and Righetti announced that their safe
had been robbed by burglars, who ha>!
secured entrance to the store by drilling
the rear door. The safe was not damage 1
in the least.
Creditors Take a Hand.
San Francisco creditors sent for t.io
partners, and they were examined in that
city before a referee. The result was that
the creditors attached the store and
stock. Bankruptcy proceedings were in -
stituted, and the partners were ordered
to appear before Referee Louis Lamy m
San Luis Obispo.
In that examination ;t; t was ascertained
that De Gottardi had disposed of a one
half interest to his brother-in-law; that
he had drawn from the firm's cash $<55"0
within six weeks prior to the so-called
robbery; that Righetti had sold his in
terest in a dairy business for a $2000 note.
which he claims to have given to his
wife; that he also drew $1200 out of the
firm's business and purchased with it a
house and lot, which he immediately
homesteaded; that the firm on May 1,
after the alleged robbery, had paid to F.
A. Dorn. a San Luis Obispo attorney.
$2000, which the partners claimed was in
payment of an $800 bill, the $2000 being a
retainer for the burglary case.
During the first examination before the
referee both De Gottardi and Righetti re
fused to answer vital and important in
quiries on the ground that "my answer
might tend to incriminate me and might
be made the foundation of a criminal ac
tion against me, and it might have a ten
dency to subject me to punishment for a
crime."
Refuse to Answer Questions.
The referee grew tired of an empty pro
ceeding and brought the affair to the ears
of Judge Wellborn, who decided that the
questions must be answered.
When the examination was taken up
again in October De Gottardi was asked
what disposition he had made of the $6500
drawn from the firm's funds. The witness
replied that he had given tc a woman $6000
and to a physician $425.
"Who are these persons?" he was asked.
De Gottardi refused to answer. When
pressed regarding the mysterious woman
the father of five children informed the
court that he had got into some trouble
with her. That was the reason he had
given her the $6000. The witness would
not reveal more on this score and his re
fusal is a cause of the contempt case
now on.
Mrs. Righetti, wife of the partner, is up
for contempt also. She claims to have re
ceived a $2000 note from her husband, but
refused to reveal anything more regard
ing it.
No Evidence of Robbery.
Referee Lemy, after taking all the tes
timony, found:
Firstâ That there had been no robbery.
Secondâ That there had been no affair
with a woman and the subsequent pay
ment to her of $6000 by De Gottardi.
Thirdâ That there had been no $425 pay
ment to a physician.
On October 17 the referee, therefore, or
dered the firm to pay to the trustee the
sum of $7500; De Gottardi to pay the sum
of $5000, making in all a total of $12,500.
The two were given twenty-four hours in
which to put up the money in favor of
the creditors.
The orders were not obeyed by either
De Gottardi or Righetti. consequently
both are in the United States District
Court upon contempt proceedings, fight
ing for liberty.
Attorney F. A. Dorn was notified by the
referee to return the $2800 which the firm
had paid to him. He immediately com
plied with the reauest.
The contempt proceedings will occupy
several days, as much testimony is to be
reviewed.
Dental Examiners Meet.
A meeting of the State Board of Den
tal Examiners was held last Monday in

Buero Would Not Prosecute.
The case of John J. Devlin, dairyman
on the Mission road, charged with as
sault with a deadly weapon, was dis
missed by Judge Mogan yesterday. Dev
lin was accused of attempting to stab J.
Buero, a carpenter, in a saloon at the
Six-Mile House. After leaving the saloon,
it is alleged, he got a shotgun, returned
and stood outside, firing it off occasion
ally and daring Buero to come out. Buero
said yesterday that he and Devlin were
old friends and for his mother's sake he
would not prosecute him.

CORONER STOPS
THE INTERMENT
Orders Thorough Invest
igation of Hessman
Suicide.
Inquest Postponed Because
Wife Fails to Appear
as Witness.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 2<?.-Mrsi. ' Clara T.
Hessman,- widow of the late Otto Hess
man. who committed suicide early Sun
day morning, failed to put in an appear
ance thi3 evening at the local branch
Morgue at 5 o'clock, the time set for an
inquest into the cause of her husband.*
death.
In explanation of her absence. Coroner
H. B. Mehrmann received a note written
oil a. scrap of foolscap paper, dated to
day, bearing the name George Adam,
Mf D.. 1196 Green street, San Francisco,
and certifying that Mrs. Hes3rnan was
suffering Â¦ from nervous prostration and
would be unable to be present at the in
quest. â¢ . . . . â¢
After reading the note and conferring
with City Marshal John Conrad and Drs>.
C. L. Tlsdale and A. A. Stafford, Coroner
Mehrmann announced to the jurymen and
witnesses that he would not go on with
the inquest without Mrs. Hessman's pres
ence, or until he was thoroughly satisfied
that she could not attend. He then post
poned the inquiry until Thursday next at
10 a. m.. and ordered Drs. Tisdale an- 1
Stafford to perform an autopsy on Hes3
man's body, which had already bee.i
placed in a coffin and prepared for burial.
Coroner Mehrmann said':
I know of no good reason why Mrs. Hessman
could not be here this evening. She was regu
larly supenaed and was well Â«hlÂ» to be around
yesterday and early last evening. Later shÂ«
â¢ went over to San Francisco,, and I am informed
is now stopping at 736 Bush street. She wanted
the remains of her husband burled yesterday,
but 1 refused to allow this. Then she wanted
them interred to-day. I refused again and no- . .
tified Deputy Coroner James Fowler to hold the S
body until after the iiwuest.
Mrs. Mary Dickson. Mrs. Hessman's sister. .
came to me and desired to know if she could
not appear as a witness in her sister's stead
I told her "No." I intend to question Mrs
Hessmarf, if it is possible for me to do so. Lo
cal appearances indicate that Hessman died,
from gas asphyxiation, but I have a witness
who will testify that he saw Arthur Stenblht I ,
Jump upon Hessman's stomach with both feÂ«t J- .
after he . had Â¦ knocked him down In the fight
Saturday afternoon. It may be possible that: 1 ;*
injuries thus Inflicted had more to do with ; "?
causing Hessman's death than the gas had. I
mean to investigate this affair from beginning Q
to end, so that It cannot be said that anything
was left undone to determine how Hessman's
life came to an end.
Drs. Tisdale and Stafford in the autopsy
found that the internal organs in the ab
dominal and chest cavities were in fairly
good order. The face was marked with
numerous contusions caused by blows, but
no trace of a skull fracture or brain con
cussion was revealed. The lungs held con
siderable gas.
Arthur Stenbiht. who was. named as co
respondent in a cross-complaint filed by.
Hessman in the suit for divorce brought
by the latter' 3 w (Â°, was released from,
the City Prison late last night on bail put
up by his mother. Stenbiht was arrested
on complaint of Detective George Brown
for the part he took In the brawl with
Hessman last Saturday and charged with
disturbing the peace. He will be given a
hearing to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
by Justice Morris. Stenbiht called at the
branch Morgue this morning to ascertain
whether he would be wanted as a wit
ness at the inquest. He will be subpo
naeds

OIL RATE CASES
BEING ARGUED
Attorney Sterry Makes
Opening Statement
for Railroad.
:--:'Â¦ :Â¦. ' â¢Â¦/â¢>Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦- .^- ; - v.t
He Claims That the Commis
sion Has Exceeded Its
- < â¢' â¢'â¢ Authority. Â¦
All the evidence in the oil rate cases
taken before Railroad Commissioners
Laumeister, Edson and Blackstock ha 3
been made a part of the record and the
arguments have begun. W. A. Worthing
ton testified yesterday afternoon, and
when his cross-examination was conclui
ed by Frank N. Short. Attorney Sterry
began his argument In behalf of the San
ta Fe road.
Worthlngton is the chief statistician of
the Southern Pacific operating depart
ment, and was armed with figures. Ac
cording to his testimony the company's
heaviest locomotive weighs twenty-six
tons and is capable of hauling 850 tons.
The smallest of the locomotives has a
weight of fifteen tons. Trains on the Val
ley division run from 400 to 800 tons, the
average of which was placed at 658 tons
on the line from Bakersfield to San Fran
Cisco. Out of this 658 tons 313 tons are
actual paying freight. Worthington's fig
ures showed a cost of $1 84 per ton
mile, minus interest, and $1 10 for return
ing the empties. Worthington concluded
with a lengthy statement on the grades
between Bakersfield a.id Oakland.
Sterry's argument v.-Â«is on the lines of
railroad justice and fairness in fixing the
rates. He claimed that the railroad com
panies, had a right to fix such rates as
would give them a raasonable profit on
the money invested, r.nTf that the Commis
sioners did not have the right to say that
8 cents a barrel on oil was too much u-\
less they compared '.t with every other
commodity. Sterry citod legal opinions
to support his contention. When he
reached the "fair-minded Commissioners"
he raised his voice on high against Tne
Call editorial of Tuesday morning.
~ The case went over until Saturday
morning.
GOES TO JAIL FOB.
HIS SISTES'S HONOR
Fred Scott Declares He Accepts Pun
ishment Because He Defended
His Family Name.
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â Fred Scott, the
young colored man who was convicted a
â¢week ago for assault with a deadly wea
pon with intent to kill Harry "Wilson, also
colored, was sentenced by Judge Melvin
to-day to serve two years in the County
Jail for the offense. Just before passing
sentence Judge Melvin, as is customary,
asked the prisoner if he had anything to
say for himself.
"Yes," said the prisoner, rising and
standing in the middle of the courtroom.
"I wish to say that I stand convicted of
a crime committed while I was trying to
protect the name and honor of my sister
and family, and under the circumstances
I will gladly go to prison."
Scott expressed a preference for tbe
County Jail rather than one of the State
prisons, and Judge Melvin granted his re
quest to be sent there. Since his incar
ceration in the County Jail Scott has
been constantly visited by his sister and
parents.
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
PEBFOBMS THE CEBEMONY
Miss Edna G. Karman and Louis Raf
fetto Jr. Are Quietly Married
by Judge Quinn.
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â A quiet wedding
took place this morning in the chambers
of Justice of the Peace Quinn, the prin
cipals being Miss Edna G. Karman and
Louis Raffetto Jr. The bride has been
a resident of Oakland but a short time,
coming to this city with her parents
about five months ago from Grand Rap
ids, Mich., but the time was long enough
for Mr. Raffetto â¢to woo and win her.
The groom is we'll known here, having
lived in Oakland nearly all his life. He
is a son of Louis" Raffetto St., a retired
capitalist.
After the ceremony a wedding break
fast was served at the residence of the
bride's parents, 950 Fifth street. A recep
tion followed and later the young people
took their departure for San Jose, where
they will spend the honeymoon. On their
return they will reside at 950 Fifth street,
where Mr. Raffetto has fitted up a home
for his bride.
CITY TAXES YET UNPAID
ARE NOW DELINQUENT
Large Sum Will Remain Outstanding
Until Courts Settle Assessment
Difficulties.
OAKLAND, Nov. 26.â The first Install
ment of city taxes unpaid is now delin
quent and from to-day on a penalty
charge will be exacted!* The amount due
the city under the first installemnt Is
$301,015 82. About $200,000 has been collect
ed, leaving a delinquency of about $100,000.
This is caused largely by refusals to
pay on the increased assessments on busi
ness property. The revenue from this in
crease would be about $15,000, but more
than four times that amount is tied up
pending the settlement of the legal points
upon which the refusals are based.

NO APPEAL FROM
THE COLLECTOR
Ruling in Transit Cases
Sustained by Treas
ury Department.
The Secretary of the Treasury has de
cided that the Collector of Customs has
a right to refuse to grant to Chinese in
transit the jM-ivilege of passing through
any part ot the United States when he
feels that the applicants intend to make
their way clandestinely into this country.
He has decided also upon the authority
of F. A. Reeves, acting Solicitor of the
Treasury, that there can be no appeal
under the present regulations from the
judgment of the Collector. Hence the de
partment has dismissed the . appeals in
the oases of eighty Chinese laborers who
asked permission of Collector Stratton to
pass through California on the way to
ioreien countries.
Reeves makes a singular mistake and
one that does an injustice to Judge de
Haven of the United States District
Court. In his written opinion to the Sec
retary of the Treasury he insinuates that
Judge de Haven is ignorant of the geog
raphy of the republic of Mexico, and then
vqry inconsistently refers to Judge de
Haven as "the learned Judge." The fact
le that Judge de Haven In deciding in fa
vor of Collector Stratton in the cases
which were appealed to the Treasury De
partment or, the agreed case of Fok
Yung Yo said that the applicant asked
permission to pass through the United
States on his way to "Guatemala, Mcx-
Jro." This was the fact, such being the

destination of Fok as mentioned in his
application. Whether there is a place in
Mexico known as Guatemala was not
made an issue in the case. Such was the
destination in the application, and Judge
de Haven referred to it as such, as he
was obliged to do under the pleadings.
Solicitor Reeves says:
My attention has been called to a recent de
cision of Judge de Haven, who suggests that
while this class of Chinese are not entitled
to the writ of habeas corpus, they have a
remedy by appeal to the Secretary if they are
denied landing by the Collector. The question
of the -right of appeal was not before the court,
and his remark may be taken as merely obiter
dicta and not authoritative. Besides, it is
but just to the learned Judge to assume that
the opinion to which my attention has been
called (In re Fok Yung Yo) has not been re
ported with the accuracy which should char
acterize the report of a decision of the court.
For instance. 'Judge de Haven, more than once,
inadvertently, of course, locates Guatemala In
the republic of Mexico; and quite as carelessly
he Is made to remark that the regulation of
the Treasury Department relating to Chinese
in transit, etc.. is authorized by the acts of
18SS (25 St., p. 475) and 1892 (27 St.. c. 25). The
first act prohibltsthe coming of Chinese to the
United States, and the second act prohibits the
coming of Chinese persons to this country, and
has no relation to Chinese passing in transit.
The power of the Secretary to make the regu
lation referred to Is given by article 111 of the
treaty of*lS94.
In my, opinion the right of appeal from the
decision of the Collector denying the landing
of Chinese who claim to be In transit is not
given *>y the act of 1894. Appeals in such cases
may be provided for by the Secretary under
the power given by the treaty if he should see
fit to exercise it. * . Â¦

REPUBLICANS
ARE VIGILANT
Congressional Delega
tion Looking Out for
Exclusion.
The selection of four Democrats and
only one Republican to comprise a com
mittee of five to visit rhc national capi
tal as representatives cf California's sen
timent in favor of the re-enactment of
the Chinese exclusion Jaw shows conclu
sively that Democratic politicians are
bent on making political capital ,out of
the agitation. The sceheme is so trans
parent that every one Â¦will see through it.
It is fortunate for the people that Califor
nia is represented in Congress by a dele
gation of nine Republicans. The mem
bers of this delegation will soon take the
size of the committee appointed by ex-
Corigressman Geary, anci also take proper
measures to prevent the committee from
obstructing the legislation which the
country demands. There is not the slight
est doubt that the agencies which dictated
the appointment of tha committee wpuld
readily engage in a scheme to defeat ex
clusion in order to score a few points for
the Democratic party in the next political

MOW AVENGES
FAMILY WRONGS
Chinese Crosses Ocean
in Pursuit of Mother's
Murderers.
With Knife and Cleaver
He Lays Two Brothers
Low.
Yuen Mow occupies a cell in the City
Prison, with two charges of murderous
assault against his name. A term of im
prisonment for a period of years stares
him in the face, and yot he is supremely
fcappy, because he has wreaked venge
ance upon two men who have wronged
him and his family, ne crossed the ocean
with intent to kill them. He knows that
the men he has followed from his home
in China to this distant country have
been made to suffer for the injuries they
are alleged to have infli-.ted upon his fam
ily. For ten years he has been on the
track of two brothers and within the
past month he laid them both low with
knife and^cleaver. That he may suffer
is nothing to him. That he may suffei
the death penalty if eitner of his victims
die gives him no worry. He has securei
his revenge and is willing to suffer the
consequences.
Six weeks ago Yuen Mow murderously
attacked Yuen Toy, a servant at the res
idence of Dr. George H. Palmer, if ester
day Yuen Ling, a brother of Toy, was at
tacked, and escaped instant death by
grappling with the murderer.
Toy was cut twelve times with a knife,
and the brother was struck repeated'y
with a cleaver. Both men are in a preca
rious condition.
Yuen Ling lives at 911 Clay street and is
a tailor. Yesterday morning about 6:30
o'clock he left his house to go to work,
and just as he stepped from the door
Yuen Mow, who had been watching for
him, attacked him with the cleavir.
After being struck three times on the
head Yuen Ling grapDled with his assail
ant and succeeded in wrenching the
weapon from him and striking him a blow
on the forehead with it. Yuen Mow ran,
pursued by Yuen Ling, and took refuge
in the building on the northeast corner of
Stockton and SacrameiÂ«to streets.
Policeman John Dougherty happened to
be on a Sacramento screet car on his way
to report for duty at the Hall of Jus
tice and saw Yuen Ling standing on the
street with blood running down his ne-^k
and face. The signalman at the corner
told him that a Chinese had run into the
building, and Dougherty went after him.
He found Mow crouched in a corner of
the top floor, and he showed fight, bvt
was quickly handcuffed. Yuen Ling iden
tified him as the man who had attempted
to murder him. He was taken to the City
Prison and locked up in the "tanks' 1
pending the result of Yuen Ling's inju
ries.
Yuen Ling was sent to the Receivjrg
Hospital, where Dr. Armistead found
three incised wounds of the scalp, a frac
ture of the skull and three incised
wounds on his right hand. It is thought
that the â¢wounds wii: not prove fatal.
Yuen Mow was later '.alren to the hos
pital by Detective E<\ Gibson and the
wound on his forehead was dressed.
Yuen Mow a' leges >.hat Yuen Toy and
Yuen Ling robbed him ot his farm in Chi
na and murdered his mother. They came
to this country about ten years ago and
he had followed them, waiting for a
chance to have his "avenge.

Solid Republican Delegation.
The Republicans at this time are mas
ters of tne situation, and the exclusion
act will be extended through Republican
agencies. The bill will probably be
passed by a Republican House and a Re
publican Senate and be approved by a
Republican President.
According to all accounts, there is a
general desire upon the part of all the
Republican State office-holders for renom
ination. There is some talk of asking
Controller Colgan to go higher. Attorney
General Ford is also on the list of those
entitled to promotion. Lieutenant Gover
nor Neff has been asked many times to
enter the contest for the first prize on the
ticket, but he has told his friends that
Harold T. Power and E. C. Voorheis are.
miners and available.
Republican leaders fancy that some
tiling is going to happen in Alameda
County that may result in a solid dele
gation behind some favorite son of that
county. Should Victor H. Metcalf go to
the State convention heading an undivid
ed delegation of Alamedans his prospects
of success would alarm other aspirants.
The likelihood of Metcalf entering the
race has suggested to Republicans tho
name of Alden Anderson for Congress.
It will be called to mind that the Gage-
Herrin machine made a special fight
against Mr. Anderson for the Speakership
of the last Assembly, and by the assist
ance of Boss Martin Kelly succeeded in
electing Corney Pendl<non.
Gage Force Not ( Strong.
If the primary election law is not
knocked out by the Supreme Court the
Herrin-Gage forces in the next State con
vention will not be formidable. Should
the law be overthrown Burns and Herrin
would probably order the Republican
County Committee to appoint delegates
favorable to Gage. Such a rank pro
gramme would disrupt the party in San
Francisco and stir up party strife else
where, because the Republican citizens
and taxpayers of the metropolis will not
accept a Herrin-Bums programme either
in State or local affairs. Since the recent
municipal election the stock of indepen
dent, anti-boss Republican aspirants for
Governor has advanced. E. F. Preston.
Thomas Flint, E. B. Edson, Harold
Power, Frank H. Short, George C. Pardee
and others have ah equal chance with
Gage in winning the favor of local Re
publicans.
COLORED NURSE
MIXES THE DATES
March Is the First Month
of the Year, Says
Mrs. Kennedy.
Some Interesting Testimony-
Given in the Kershow
Will Contest
Mrs. Alice Kennedy, a negress of Oak
land, who cared for the late Max Ker
show, whose will is being contested, testi
fied yesterday that from April 1 to April
24 of this year, the period covering the
time when the purported will was exe
cuted, neither J. Morgan Smith nor A. J.
Meadows, tne witnesses to the will, were
in Kershow's apslttments at Tortoni's.
She said that Smith called frequently to
inquire after Kershow's health, but never
entered the rooms.
In the direct examination the colored
woman was very positive as to the dates,
but when cross-examined by Attorney
Tauszky, who represents Rhea Gettings,
to whom Kershow left most of his prop
erty, it became evident that she was la
mentably ignorant where dates were con
cerned. When asked how old she was
she said she was 1896, and followed this
remarkable statement by saying that
March was the first month of the year.
When given a chance to make another
guess she said November. The attorneys
for Miss Gettings were not slow to see
that the woman was dense, except as to
the dates in which the contestants were
interested, and plied her with questions
concerning days, months and years, prac
tically destroying her evidence. It was
also discovered that the witness had a
number of dates written on a card which
she held in her Ipn. These dates, she
claimed, were written by her husband to
enable her to answer the questions which
he informed her wculd be asked her.
Mrs. Kennedy was a better witness
when describing Kershow's habits. She
said that she was with him from 6:30
a. m. to 11 p. m. every day and that be
tween those hours he drank a bottle and
a half of whisky. She said that from the
Ist of April of this year to the 24th he
never left his room and was so weak that
he could not walk without her aid. Her

"Helmet of Navarre" at 95c and "Quincy
Adams Sawyer" at 75c. The "Right of
Way" and "Graustark" at $1 05. Mr.

ROB COLEMAN
IN HIS SALOON
Three Footpads Strangle
Him and Take Money
and Watch.
The robbery in Joseph Coleman's sa
loon, 110 Second street, Monday evening
was one of the most daring that has ever
occurred in the city. Coleman was knock
ed down and kicked and robbed of his
gold watch and chain. The robbers also
took $42 out of the cash re'fister. Captain
Seymour has detailed Detectives Ryan
and ODea on the case, and as Coleman
was able to give a good description of the
men their arrest is expected soon.
Coleman's statement is that the three
men entered his saloon at the time men
tioned and called for three glasses of
beer. Coleman served them and one of
them put a 50-cent piece on the counter.
As Coleman turned around to get the
change from the cash register one of the
trio threw his arm around his neck and
pulled him backward against the bar.
Another grabbed his watch and chain out
of his pocket, while the third rifled the
cash register.
Coleman was unable to call for help,
as the robber's arm was strangling him.
He was thrown to the floor and kicked
on the jaw and body. The trio then ran
out of the saloon.
The police were also notified yesterday
that Saturday night, between 10 and 11
o'clock, two men entered the saloon of
A. Schoenitzer, Twenty-sixth and Bart
lett streets, and ordered two glasses of
beer. While one engaged him in conver
sation the other" succeeded in extracting
from the till a bag containing $20. He
missed the bag almost Immediately after
they had left.
The Overdue Fleet.
The American ship Edward Sewall, now
out 166 days from New York for Shanghai,
was posted as overdue yesterday. She is
laden with kerosine and 15 per cent was
paid on her by the underwriters yester
day.
The Roanoke, now out 168 days from
Norfolk, Va., took another tumble yes
terday. She was at 25 per cent, but ow
ing to the fact that she was spoken on
September 25 in latitude 54 degrees south,
longitude 79 degrees west, the rate drop
ped to 15 per cent. Soon after the Roa
noke left the coast of Virginia a vessel
was seen on fire by a passing steamer
and it was thought to be the American
ship. The underwriters paid 45 per cent
on her until it was discovered that the
Roanoke was safe and sound off the
Platte. Then a scare over her coal cargo
was gotten up and reinsurance was paid
on her until the rate again reached 35
per cent. This figure dropped to zero
when the ship was reported this side of
the Horn, but the underwriters again got
scared over the heated cargo of a vessel
that reached Honolulu and trie rate of
the Roanoke again went to 25 per cent.
Now comes the news of her having been
spoken again and the reinsurance takes
a corresponding tumble.

for ten years. He was formerly a deputy

regime expenditures have been materially
decreased with a corresponding increase
